50|$|An <b>antiozonant,</b> {{also known}} as anti-ozonant, is an organic {{compound}} that prevents or retards the degradation of material caused by ozone (ozone cracking). Antiozonants are used as additives to plastics and rubber, especially in tire manufacturing.|$|E

40|$|In this study, the {{efficiency}} of several potential long lasting <b>antiozonants</b> was studied by ozonolysis of model olefins. 2 -Methyl- 2 -pentene was selected {{as a model for}} natural rubber (NR) and 5 -phenyl- 2 -hexene as a model for styrene butadiene rubber (SBR). A comparison was made between {{the efficiency}} of conventional <b>antiozonants</b> like N-(1, 3 dimethylbutyl) -N-phenyl-p-phenylene diamine (6 PPD), N-isopropyl-N-phenyl-p-phenylene diamine (IPPD), and a mixture of diaryl p-phenylene diamines (Wingstay 100) and some newly synthesized <b>antiozonants.</b> The stearic acid salt of 6 PPD (PPD-C 18), 2, 4, 6 -tris(4 -(phenylamino) phenyl) - 1, 3 - 5 -triazinane (ADPAT), and 4 -pyrole diphenylamine (PDPA) showed a higher efficiency than the conventional <b>antiozonants</b> in both NR as well as SBR model system. Special attention was paid to the carboxylic acid salts of 6 PPD such as PPD-C 18, which has shown good long-term protection of passenger tire sidewall compounds. It was demonstrated that by varying the chain length, C 7, C 18, and C 22, of the carboxylic acid part of the 6 PPD salts, the ozone protection was not influenced under the selected test conditions. The 6 PPD salts made from strong acids like succinic acid (SA) and methyl sulfonic acid (MSA) appeared to be less efficient than PPD-C 18. It was also investigated whether the reactions between ozone and the double bonds of the model rubber could be measured online by a spectroscopic technique. It was demonstrated that near infrared spectroscopy is a suitable technique to study these reactions. FT Raman looked also a promising technique because of the high response factor of double bonds. However, the addition of p-phenylene diamines (PPDAs) to the sample solution resulted in a strong discoloration (dark brown) and therefore in a high fluorescence background signal. This technique can therefore not be used for the evaluation of staining <b>antiozonants...</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Antiozonant</b> agents: blends of {{paraffin}} and micro waxes {{are used}} in rubber compounds to prevent cracking of the rubber; the admixture of wax migrates {{to the surface of}} the product and forms a protective layer. The layer can also act as a release agent, helping the product separate from its mould.|$|E
5000|$|The {{problem can}} be {{prevented}} by adding antiozonants to the rubber before vulcanization. Ozone cracks were commonly seen in automobile tire sidewalls, but are now seen rarely thanks {{to the use of}} these additives. A common and low cost <b>antiozonant</b> is a wax which bleeds to the surface and forms a protective layer, but other specialist chemicals are also widely used.|$|E
50|$|Ethylene diurea (EDU) is a {{chemical}} compound with the formula C4H10N4O2. It has been analyzed by several groups {{to determine whether}} it is a successful <b>antiozonant.</b> If so, this substance would help crops by preventing the harmful effects on crops by ozone. In an experiment run in 2002 by a group called Alberta Environment (now known as Alberta Environment and Sustainable Resource Development, they determined that EDU did one of two things. The substance either prevented the harmful effects of ozone or it stimulated plant growth.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the investigations presented in this thesis is to develop new long-lasting antidegradants and {{to gain a better}} insight in the protection mechanism of these products. A better understanding of the mechanism can help {{to pave the way for}} new developments, providing longer-term protection of rubber compounds. Longlasting antioxidants are expected to remain longer active in rubber compounds compared to conventional antioxidants, both during processing and service. Developments in this field are based on high molecular weight and polymer bound antioxidants. Long-lasting <b>antiozonants</b> are meant to migrate slower to the surface of rubber compounds compared to conventional <b>antiozonants.</b> Developments in this field are based on high molecular weight products...|$|R

50|$|Sidewalls are non-reinforced {{extruded}} profiles with additives {{to give the}} sides of the tire good abrasion resistance and environmental resistance.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The current research on non-migratory <b>antiozonant</b> systems for natural rubber follows a tripartite study involving the formulation of a coating compound with static and dynamic ozone testing of the coatings, a review of some commercial in-mould coating techniques and analysis of diffusion of a commercial <b>antiozonant</b> through a coating. An outline of the mixing of Nipol 1312, a low molecular weight nitrile butadiene rubber grade produced by leon Chemicals Inc., with other ingredients to produce a coating composition is also given. Test pieces of the natural rubber substrate were placed in pre-coated mould cavities and cured under compression to achieve covulcanisation between the substrate and the coating. All ozone tests were carried out under standard ASTM DI 149 - 911 D 518 - 91 conditions. Results show that the formulated nitrile rubber coating compound is able to protect natural rubber from ozone attack with no migration of the <b>antiozonant</b> as in classical chemical <b>antiozonant</b> systems. An up to date patent search on in-mould coating techniques and systems was carried out and evaluated in conjunction with some current commercial coating methods. In this overview, more emphasis is laid {{on the nature of}} the coating material which subsequently determines the appropriate coating technique, than on the specific in-mould coating process applied. Post-mould coating work with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) on natural rubber substrate was also assessed. An experimental and theoretical study of the diffusion of the <b>antiozonant</b> N,Isopropyl N-phenyl-pphenylenediamine (IPPD) through a protective coating on a natural rubber substrate is made in the project. This study shows that the protective coating is able to reduce the loss of <b>antiozonant</b> through diffusion while giving the rubber adequate protection from ozone. The study also demonstrates that the combination of a commercial <b>antiozonant</b> and a protective coating gives enhanced product service life and provides protection to damaged regions of the coating...|$|E
40|$|The <b>antiozonant</b> {{ethylene}} diurea {{is proven}} to prevent growth reductions in forest trees induced by ozone. The community of mycorrhizal fungi could be useful indicator of environmental stress. In this study, response of mycorrhizal fungi and fine roots to a 4 -year exposure to ambient ozone and treatment with <b>antiozonant</b> was investigated in ozone-sensitive poplar clone under field conditions. The community of ectomycorrhizal fungi and root length colonization with ectomycorrhizal, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and root endophytic fungi was analyzed in antiozonant-treated poplar plants and in poplar plants irrigated with water. In general, plants protected by <b>antiozonant</b> showed higher total number of fine roots, number of ectomycorrhizal types, Shannonâ€“Weaver diversity index, and Species richness index compared to the plants treated with water. The ectomycorrhizal community shifted from contact exploration type in the trees irrigated with water to short-distance exploration type in ethylene diurea-treated trees. Ozone protectant may beneficially affect the belowground community of mycorrhizal fungi colonizing roots of ozone-sensitive poplar clone...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{study to}} {{evaluate}} the effects of ethylene diurea (EDU) as a protective <b>antiozonant</b> for beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) submitted to different ambient ozone concentrations was performed in three stations of the rural Network for Air Quality Monitoring (Catalonia, NE Spain). The highest ozone concentrations were accompanied by significant reductions in fruit yield, number of fruits and shoot biomass. These reductions were lower in plants treated with EDU. The results showed toxic ozone effects on sensitive species such as beans and a protective <b>antiozonant</b> effect of EDU. The intensity of the EDU protective effect differed among the different stations characterised by different meteorological conditions and O 3 concentrations...|$|E
50|$|Anti-degradants include {{antioxidants}} and <b>antiozonants.</b> Since {{the aging}} of rubber is caused largely by oxygen, materials that quickly react with oxygen {{can be used as}} anti-degradant {{depending on the type of}} rubber, although organic compounds that easily react with oxygen are recommended for use as anti-degradant (chemical antioxidant).|$|R
5000|$|The {{method was}} used to confirm the {{structural}} repeat unit in natural rubber as isoprene. It is also a serious problem, known as [...] "ozone cracking" [...] where traces of the gas in an atmosphere will cut double bonds in susceptible elastomers, including natural rubber, polybutadiene, Styrene-butadiene and Nitrile rubber. Ozone cracking creates small cracks {{at right angles to}} the load in the surfaces exposed to the gas, the cracks growing steadily as attack continues. The rubber product must be under tension for crack growth to occur.Ozone cracking is a form of stress corrosion cracking where active chemical species attack products of a susceptible material. Ozone cracking was once commonly seen in the sidewalls of tires but is now rare owing to the use of <b>antiozonants.</b> Other means of prevention include replacing susceptible rubbers with resistant elastomers such as polychloroprene, EPDM or Viton.|$|R
25|$|Ozone gas attacks any polymer {{possessing}} olefinic or double bonds {{within its}} chain structure, such as natural rubber, nitrile rubber, and styrene-butadiene rubber. Products made using these polymers are especially susceptible to attack, which causes cracks to grow longer and deeper with time, {{the rate of}} crack growth depending on the load carried by the rubber component and the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere. Such materials can be protected by adding <b>antiozonants,</b> such as waxes, which bond to the surface to create a protective film or blend with the material and provide long term protection. Ozone cracking {{used to be a}} serious problem in car tires for example, but the problem is now seen only in very old tires. On the other hand, many critical products, like gaskets and O-rings, may be attacked by ozone produced within compressed air systems. Fuel lines made of reinforced rubber are also susceptible to attack, especially within the engine compartment, where some ozone is produced by electrical components. Storing rubber products in close proximity to a DC electric motor can accelerate ozone cracking. The commutator of the motor generates sparks which in turn produce ozone.|$|R
40|$|The {{effluent}} of a rubber chemical antioxidant and <b>antiozonant</b> producer industry, with high content of organic material {{was subjected to}} electrolytic process. To evaluate the speed of stabilization of the eletroctrolyzed effluents, and to evaluate the biodegradation the respirometric test of Bartha and Pramer was used. The monitoring of the biodegradation of the effluent, after different periods of electrolysis show that the ideal time of electrolysis was 10 and 25 min. It was concluded that the eletrolytic process was viable to diminish the adaptation time of the microorganism to the effluent and consequently increased the biodegradation of effluent...|$|E
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the mode of action of ethylenediurea, a very effective <b>antiozonant,</b> is via {{an increase in the}} antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (EH Lee, JH Bennett [1982] Plant Physiol 69 : 1444 - 1449). Data presented here refute that hypothesis. No ethylenediurea-associated increases in Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase or Mn-superoxide dismutase activity, nor in steady-state Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase protein levels, were found in soluble extracts of bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L. cv Bush Blue Lake 290) leaves. However, the cytosolic Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase increased as a result of ozone fumigation and subsequent injury. Also noted was a developmentally related difference between chloroplastic and cytosolic Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, the latter declining during maturation of the leaf...|$|E
40|$|The NR/BR blend {{compound}} formulations for tire sidewall applications {{contain a}} set of stabilizers added to prevent degradation mainly due to oxygen, ozone, and heat. 6 PPD {{is the most effective}} and widely used <b>antiozonant</b> in tire compounds, but is a highly staining material causing a surface discoloration of the tire sidewall. Incorporation of 30 phr EPDM into blends of NR/BR improves the ozone resistance to the required level, without the need of 6 PPD. The first two parts of this series have described a reactive processing technique applied to enhance the covulcanization and blend homogeneity, together with their characterization. In the present article, the properties of the NR/BR/EPDM blends prepared by both reactive and straight mixing are tested in comparison with those of equivalent conventional NR/BR compounds. The reactive NR/BR/EPDM blend vulcanizates show excellent tensile strength, elongation at break, tear strength, fatigue-to-failure, and ozone resistance in both static and dynamic conditions. The properties are equivalent or even superior to those of the conventional NR/BR tire sidewall compounds. The simple straight mixed NR/BR/EPDM blend vulcanizates distinctively possess inferior mechanical properties compared to those of the reactive mix...|$|E
500|$|They {{are widely}} used to prevent the {{oxidative}} degradation of polymers such as rubbers, plastics and adhesives that causes a loss of strength and flexibility in these materials. Polymers containing double bonds in their main chains, such as natural rubber and polybutadiene, are especially susceptible to oxidation and ozonolysis. They can be protected by <b>antiozonants.</b> Solid polymer products start to crack on exposed surfaces as the material degrades and the chains break. The mode of cracking varies between oxygen and ozone attack, the former causing a [...] "crazy paving" [...] effect, while ozone attack produces deeper cracks aligned {{at right angles to}} the tensile strain in the product. [...] Oxidation and UV degradation are also frequently linked, mainly because UV radiation creates free radicals by bond breakage. The free radicals then react with oxygen to produce peroxy radicals which cause yet further damage, often in a chain reaction. Other polymers susceptible to oxidation include polypropylene and polyethylene. The former is more sensitive owing to the presence of secondary carbon atoms present in every repeat unit. Attack occurs at this point because the free radical formed is more stable than one formed on a primary carbon atom. Oxidation of polyethylene tends to occur at weak links in the chain, such as branch points in low-density polyethylene.|$|R
40|$|Ethylenediurea (EDU) is a {{synthetic}} chemical known to protect plants from the phytotoxic effects of tropospheric ozone (O 3). Although {{many studies have}} proposed the use of EDU for studying the O 3 effects under field conditions, its mechanism of action is not fully understood, and {{it is unclear whether}} it exerts a specific <b>antiozonant</b> action, or if it may also interact with other oxidative stresses. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of EDU on forest species in a Mediterranean environment where, during summer, vegetation is exposed to multiple oxidative stresses, such as O 3 and drought. The experiment was conducted on Fraxinus ornus L. (Manna ash) plants growing in six mesocosms, three maintained under full irrigation, while the other three were subjected to drought for 84 days. In each mesocosm, three plants were sprayed every 15 days with 450 ppm EDU. Gas exchange and chlorophyll "a" fluorescence measurements carried out through the experimental period highlighted that EDU did not affect stomatal conductance and had an ameliorative effect on the functionality of drought-stressed plants, thus suggesting that it may act as a generic antioxidant. The implications of these findings for the applicability of EDU in field studies are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The <b>antiozonant</b> chemical, ethylenediurea (N-[2 -(2 -oxo- 1 -imidazolidinyl) ethyl]-Nâ€²-phenylurea, {{abbreviated}} as EDU), {{was applied}} as stem injections or soil drenches to 5 -year-old containerized plants of olive (Olea europaea L. cultivar Kalamata) in growth chambers {{in order to}} assess its ameliorative effects against realistic ozone (O 3) stress. Visible injury symptoms were reduced greatly in individuals treated with EDU, with injection applications having greater protection than soil drenches. EDU application caused increases in the measured ecophysiological parameters compared to untreated individuals. In particular, the stem injection protected plants against photosynthetic impairment (unchanged net photosynthetic rates and intercellular CO 2 concentration, in comparison to plants grown in filtered air). EDU application increased the protection of PSII from ambient O 3 oxidative stress, although it did not retain the proportion of redox state of QA, pigment composition of photosynthetic apparatus and size of light-harvesting complex of PSII. However, the stem injection of plants with EDU induced lower non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) values in comparison to ambient air (âˆ’ 2 Â %), indicating a better photoprotection of PSII in comparison to soil drench application. EDU application caused increases in the morphological and biometric parameters compared to individuals exposed to ambient air. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study highlighting the protection of Kalamata olive trees due to EDU in terms of growth, yield, visible injury, and photosynthetic performance. Furthermore, this study proved that EDU could be a low-cost and a low-technology efficient tool for assessing O 3 effects on plant performances in the field in Saudi Arabia...|$|E
