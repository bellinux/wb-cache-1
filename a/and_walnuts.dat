Baklawa is a pastry made of thin sheets of unleavened flour dough (phyllo), filled with pistachios <b>and</b> <b>walnuts</b> sweetened by honey. Burma Til-Kadayif, or simply Burma, especially popular in East Jerusalem, has the same filling as baklawa, but is cylndrical in shape and made with kanafeh dough instead of phyllo. Halawa is a block confection of sweetened sesame flour served in sliced pieces. Muhalabiyeh is a rice pudding made with milk and topped with pistachios or almonds.|$|E

5000|$|Walnut soup is {{prepared}} using walnuts {{as a primary}} ingredient. The soup can be prepared as a broth-based or cream-based soup, and the latter {{can be referred to}} as [...] "cream of walnut soup." [...] Fresh or canned shelled walnuts can be used, and the soup can include puréed, chopped <b>and</b> whole <b>walnuts.</b> Toasted walnuts can be used to prepare the soup. Walnut soup is sometimes prepared in combinations using other ingredients, such as [...] "squash <b>and</b> <b>walnut</b> soup", [...] "pumpkin <b>and</b> <b>walnut</b> soup" [...] <b>and</b> [...] "cucumber <b>and</b> <b>walnut</b> soup", among others. Additional ingredients can include butter, oil, walnut oil, lemon juice, seasonings, salt and pepper.|$|R
5|$|A {{key part}} of the Recovery Plan is the {{supplementary}} feeding of females. The kakapo breeds only once every two to five years, when a certain type of plant species, primarily Dacrydium cupressinum (rimu), produces protein-rich fruit and seeds. Observations of the relationship between intermittent breeding and the plant's mast year help biologists choose which suitable supplementary foods to increase kakapo breeding frequency. In 1989, six preferred foods (apples, sweet potatoes, almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds <b>and</b> <b>walnuts)</b> were supplied ad libitum each night to 12 feeding stations. Males and females ate the supplied foods, and females nested on Little Barrier Island in the summers of 1989–91 {{for the first time since}} 1982, although nesting success was low.|$|E
5|$|The Australian magpie is omnivorous, eating various items {{located at}} or near ground level {{including}} invertebrates such as earthworms, millipedes, snails, spiders and scorpions {{as well as a}} wide variety of insects—cockroaches, ants, beetles, moths and caterpillars and other larvae. Insects, including large adult grasshoppers, may be seized mid-flight. Skinks, frogs, mice and other small animals as well as grain, tubers, figs <b>and</b> <b>walnuts</b> have also been noted as components of their diet. It has even learnt to safely eat the poisonous cane toad by flipping it over and consuming the underparts. Predominantly a ground feeder, the Australian magpie paces open areas methodically searching for insects and their larvae. One study showed birds were able to find scarab beetle larvae by sound or vibration. Birds use their bills to probe into the earth or otherwise overturn debris in search of food. Smaller prey are swallowed whole, although magpies rub off the stingers of bees and wasps before swallowing.|$|E

25|$|To the {{far south}} of the {{historic}} center is Parque Juárez or Juarez Park. This park was established {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century on the banks of a river in French style with fountains, decorative pools, wrought iron benches, old bridges and footpaths. There is an area for children with playground and basketball. The garden area is filled with plants and trees of the region, chirimoyos, various berries <b>and</b> <b>walnuts.</b> The water areas host a large number of herons. After dark on many days, it is possible to catch a impromptu concert by local amateur musicians. Nearby there is a small commercial center on Zacateros Street where typical of the area such as objects made of brass and glass can be found. Near here there is a fountain dedicated to Ignacio Allende.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the wild}} {{vegetation}} of the area is that of grassland with very little forest mostly due to {{a long history of}} agriculture in the area. One of the few forested areas is the Ayaquemetl mountain is near San Nicolás Tetelco with about ten hectares. There have been some efforts at reforestation. However, most of the plant life is the growing of crops, especially in the east and south growing corn, spinach, other leafy greens, alfalfa, figs, pears, <b>and</b> <b>walnuts.</b> There is also significant aquatic vegetation such as water lilies, chichicastle and ninfa. Most {{of the wild}}life of the area has been extinguished because of human encroachment but in the Santa Catarina mountains there are still badgers, cacomistle and bats as well as various kinds of rodents and birds found throughout the borough.|$|E

500|$|The most typical {{cooking method}} of the Quakers was boiling, a method brought from ancestral {{northern}} England. Boiled breakfast and dinner were standard fare, {{as well as}} [...] "pop-robbins", balls of batter made from flour and eggs boiled in milk. Boiled dumplings and puddings were so common in Quaker homes that they were referred to by outsiders as [...] "Quaker food". Travelers noted apple dumplings as an almost daily dish in the Delaware Valley and cookbooks specialized in puddings and dumplings. Food was mostly preserved through boiling, simmering or standing. A popular genre of dishes made from this favored method of food preparation was [...] "cheese" [...] (or [...] "butter"), a generic term for dishes prepared by slow boiling or pressing. They could be made from ingredients as varying as apples (i.e., apple butter), plums <b>and</b> <b>walnuts.</b> Cream cheese had its origins in Quaker cooking, but was in colonial times not true cheese made with rennet or curds, but rather cream that was warmed gently and then allowed to stand wrapped in cloth until it became semi-solid. Dried beef was widely popular in the Delaware Valley and was eaten along with puddings and dumplings to add flavor. The use of dried beef was so widespread that it was often called [...] "Quaker gravy" [...] in the 18th century. Though the Quaker influence from the northern Midlands was the most dominant, there was some influence from German immigrants during the 18th century. Scrapple, a pot pudding made from meat scraps and grain, became {{a staple of the}} regional cuisine for many generations.|$|E
2500|$|Buck Garden (500-1200 CE) were {{predominant}} throughout central Kanawha-New River Valley region {{following the}} upper Armstrong. They were first identified at the Buck Garden Creek site in Nicholas Co.. Buck Garden people were buried under Rock Mounds and cliffs. They lived in compact villages and began raising beans included within the Eastern Agricultural Complex method. Many illustrations of living activities in print through the decades have been suggested. These ideas {{have ranged from}} the bizarre to the probable. They grew or gathered root and ground vining foods, picked spring greens, berries [...] and ramp followed by gathering shellfish on creek flats, hickory <b>and</b> <b>walnuts.</b> Use of spice and Sassafras is presently speculative. With their fishing pike, they fished the spring run and in the following cooler leafless seasons they hunted game. Like their rock mound burial within the state's interior, their use of rocks is not clear: small fishing jetties and possible use of the curious game-herding stone walls. Dr. Otis K. Rice wrote, [...] "About 1000 A. D. the Buck Garden hill people began to occupy the Mount Carbon site." ...|$|E
2500|$|Until its {{identification}} {{in plants}} in 1987, melatonin was for decades {{thought to be}} primarily an animal neurohormone. [...] When melatonin was identified in coffee extracts in the 1970s, it {{was believed to be}} a byproduct of the extraction process. Subsequently, however, melatonin has been found in all plants that have been investigated. It is present in all the different parts of plants, including leaves, stems, roots, fruits, and seeds in varying proportions. Melatonin concentrations differ not only among plant species, but also between varieties of the same species depending on the agronomic growing conditions, varying from picograms to several micrograms per gram. Notably high melatonin concentrations have been measured in popular beverages such as coffee, tea, wine, and beer, and crops including corn, rice, wheat, barley, and oats. Melatonin is a poor direct antioxidant, it is, however, a highly efficient direct free radical scavenger and indirect antioxidant due to its ability to stimulate antioxidant enzymes. Thus, melatonin in the human diet is believed to confer a number of beneficial health-related effects. In some common foods and beverages, including coffee <b>and</b> <b>walnuts,</b> the concentration of melatonin has been estimated or measured to be sufficiently high to raise the blood level of melatonin above daytime baseline values.|$|E
