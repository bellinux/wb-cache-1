50|$|Today, the {{beverage}} is most associated with Tongan cuisine, although similar versions of otai {{were made and}} enjoyed in other archipelagoes, including Uvea, Samoa, Futuna, Tokelau, Hawaii, and Fiji. The original Samoan version as recorded by European colonists in the 1890s was made by mixing grated <b>ambarella</b> fruit (called vi in Samoan language and Tongan, wi in Hawaiian language) and young coconut meat with coconut milk and coconut water. The mixture was poured into large, empty coconut shells corked with coconut husk and allowed to chill in cold pools of water (or behind waterfalls) before serving.|$|E
50|$|Located in Dhadimagu {{ward of the}} island, with an area of 6.37 {{hectares}} and {{an average}} depth of 4 feet, it is the second-largest lake by volume in the Maldives, and larger in area than its counterpart Bandaara Kilhi, {{which is the largest}} lake by volume in the country. Bounded by dense vegetation of different kinds ranging from ferns to reeds used for weaving mats, taro fields and plant varieties such as Syzygium cumini (jambul), pond-apple, mango, pineapple, screwpine, tropical almond, cheese fruit, <b>ambarella</b> and banana fields as well, there is the continuation of a large marsh land area towards the south of the island associated with the lake.|$|E
5000|$|The modern Tongan recipe most {{well-known}} today {{is usually a}} blend of water, coconut cream, shredded coconut meat, and any variety of grated tropical fruits, most commonly watermelon, mango and pineapple, with watermelon being the most used in the Tongan Islands. Sugar is usually added to taste. Tongan historians have noted this version is a very modern take on the traditional Polynesian otai, especially since milk, refined sugar, watermelons, mangos, and pineapples are all introduced, foreign ingredients that were not native to Tonga. The original Tongan recipe {{was said to be}} identical to the Samoan recipe, except the preferred native fruit was not <b>ambarella</b> (vi), but the Tongan mountain apple, called fekika. In Samoa, this distinction of [...] "native" [...] and [...] "introduced" [...] recipes is differentiated as [...] "otai" [...] only refers to the drink prepared with vi fruit, while the otai made with European-introduced fruits are respectively called vai meleni (watermelon drink), vai mago (mango drink), or vai fala (pineapple drink).|$|E
40|$|The {{preparation}} of fibres from mango and <b>ambarella</b> peels {{can offer a}} way to upgrade by-products. Comparatively to lime, <b>ambarella</b> and mango fibres were prepared from their corresponding peels using ethanolic treatment (85 % at 70 A degrees C/ 5 min). The peels were characterised for their dry matter content, pH and apparent viscosity. The soluble dietary fibre (SDF) and insoluble dietary fibre (IDF) contents of the samples were determined. Hydration capacity of these fibres was evaluated. Results showed that the ethanolic treatment of the peels (85 % at 70 A degrees C/ 5 min) had significant (p < 0. 05) effects on the contents of neutral sugars and uronic acid (from 105 to even 203 mg/g in case of mango fibre). For <b>ambarella</b> fibres, the proportion of IDF (51 %) was highest and that of SDF (34 %) was lowest. Mango and lime fibres exhibited similar values of IDF (40 - 43 %) and SDF (50 - 57 %). Mango peel fibres had higher hydration capacities than <b>ambarella</b> and lime fibres. The best dietary fibres content and the high hydration capacities of mango peel fibres favour their exploitation in dietary fibre-rich foods preparation...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ambarella</b> and mango peels {{are good}} sources of pectins (15 – 20 %), with {{high degree of}} {{methylation}} (60 – 78 %) and high molar masses. <b>Ambarella</b> and mango (Ame´liore´e and Mango varieties) peel pectins wereextracted using HCl or oxalic acid ⁄ ammonium oxalate (OAAO). Puriﬁed pectins were analysed for their ﬂowbehaviour and phase diagrams were established at pH 3 as sucrose vs. pectin concentration. The gelationkinetics and mechanical spectra of these pectin gels were studied and compared to those of commercial citrus(lime) pectins. At a concentration of 1 % (w ⁄ v), all pectic solutions had a shear thinning behaviour but at 0. 6 % (w ⁄ v), only OAAO-extracted pectins exhibited such behaviour. Phase diagrams showed that at pH 3,gelation of OAAO mango extracted pectins was possible at low polymer concentration (0. 2 %; w ⁄ w) for asucrose concentration of 60 % (w ⁄ w). OAAO-extracted pectins exhibited a higher gelling ability than HCl-extracted ones. Sucrose (45 – 50 %) and pectin (0. 2 – 0. 6 %) concentration had a deep impact on the gelstrength. Our results enable {{to conclude that the}} OAAO extraction from mango and <b>ambarella</b> peels allowedthe recovery of pectins that exhibit high gelling properties...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: São Tomé and Príncipe has a {{wide variety}} of fruit trees, being most of the fruits {{consumed}} in fresh. In certain periods of the year, fruits are available at significant amounts; however, it is not common to use the surplus of those fruits.  Thus, this excess may be used in the preparation of other fruit based products (ex. jams), in order to increase product diversity and allow the annual consumption of these seasonal fruits. Objetives: Valorise fruits’ production in S. Tomé and Príncipe. Methods: Preparation of jams of banana, <b>ambarella,</b> guava (dark and light) and papaya, with two levels of sugar, and perform their physico-chemical characterization (color, pH, moisture and acidity). Furthermore, sensory analysis was also done, through preference and acceptability tests. Results: The jams prepared had different colours, acidity values, and moisture and ash contents, demonstrating the possibility of producing different products by changing the formulation. Regarding jams preference, 60 % of the consumers preferred the less sweet in the case of banana and guava (light), whereas, over 67 % of the panellists preferred the sweetest <b>ambarella</b> jam.  Concerning dark guava and papaya, the percentages were similar for both sugar contents. For all attributes analysed (appearance, colour, taste, acidity, sweetness and global evaluation), most of the panellists liked slightly all jams. Conclusion: Jams production in S. Tomé and Príncipe may be a promising activity...|$|E
40|$|The genetic {{diversity}} of 138 {{strains of the}} Xanthomonas pathovar mangiferaeindicae, which were isolated from three different hosts (mango, <b>ambarella,</b> and pepper tree) in 14 different countries, was assessed with {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} markers. An analysis of patterns obtained by hybridization with an hrp cluster probe from Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae separated 11 of the strains from all of the other strains, which suggested that these 11 strains may not be Xanthomonas pv. mangiferaeindicae strains. Hybridization with an avirulence gene from X. oryzae pv. oryzae and a repetitive DNA fragment from Xanthomonas pv. mangiferaeindicae separated the remaining 127 strains into four groups that were consistent with both geographic and host origins. The group with the greatest diversity consisted of strains from Southeast Asia, where mango originated. Other groups and subgroups contained strains that were either from widely separated countries, which suggested that wide dissemination from a single site occurred, or from localized areas, which suggested that evolution of separate lineages of strains occurred. One group of strains contained only strains isolated from pepper trees in Reunion, indicating that pepper tree may not be an alternate host for Xanthomonas pv. mangiferaeindicae strains...|$|E
