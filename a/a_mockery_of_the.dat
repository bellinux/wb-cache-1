5|$|The Virgin release {{had been}} timed to {{coincide}} with the height of Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee celebrations. By Jubilee weekend, {{a week and a half}} after the record's release, it had sold more than 150,000 copies—a massive success. On 7 June, McLaren and the record label arranged to charter a private boat and have the Sex Pistols perform while sailing down the River Thames, passing Westminster Pier and the Houses of Parliament. The event, <b>a</b> <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Queen's river procession planned for two days later, ended in chaos. Police launches forced the boat to dock, and constabulary surrounded the gangplanks at the pier. While the band members and their equipment were hustled down a side stairwell, McLaren, Westwood, and many of the band's entourage were arrested.|$|E

Earlier in the year Barrichello had been ordered to let Schumacher past on the final lap so he could win the 2002 Austrian Grand Prix. So many saw this result as Schumacher returning the favour.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the 1977 season, Finley {{attempted}} to trade Blue to the Reds for a player of lesser stature and cash, but Kuhn vetoed the deal, claiming that it was tantamount to a fire sale similar to the sales he voided a year earlier. He also claimed that adding Blue to the Reds' already formidable pitching staff would make <b>a</b> <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> National League West race. Later, the Commissioner approved a trade of relief pitcher Doug Bair to the Reds in a deal that resembled a true trade. At the same time, Blue was traded across the bay to the San Francisco Giants in a multi-player trade that likewise received the Commissioner's blessing.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} match against Ireland at R.Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, Watson opened the bowling and took 3–26 (the wickets of opener-captain William Porterfield, keeper-batsman Niall O'Brien and all-rounder Kevin O'Brien); he then scored 51 from 30 balls {{to help his}} side win the match in 15.1 overs. He was {{subsequently}} named as Man of the Match. In the next match against the West Indies he again opened the bowling and batting, taking 2–29 from 4 overs (the wickets of Chris Gayle & Kieron Pollard). He then scored 41 not out from 24 balls to win the Man of the Match award as his side won by 17 runs (by the Duckworth-Lewis method). Against India, he was used as second change bowler and took 3–34. It was he who had changed the game by taking the wickets of Yuvraj Singh and opener Irfan Pathan in the 11th over. He also dismissed Suresh Raina in the last over. He followed it up with 72 from 42 balls (7 sixes and 2 fours) making <b>a</b> <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> target 141. Against South Africa he took 2–29 (the wickets of Hashim Amla and AB de Villiers), following it up with 70 from 47 balls to win his fourth consecutive Man of the Match award. At {{the completion of the}} group stages and Super Eight stages, Watson had the most runs, wickets and sixes. His dominance with both bat and ball made him the unanimous choice of the experts to be named Player of the Tournament.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> diabolist {{elements}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> initiation ceremonies <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> Millers' Word and Horseman's Word {{might have}} been a deliberate parody of Presbyterianism, a form of Protestant Christianity that was then dominant in much of Scotland.

The historian Ronald Hutton suggested that these diabolical elements may have derived in part from folk stories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> witches' sabbath, which could have been absorbed either directly from Scottish folklore or from published accounts discussing witchcraft.|$|R

Backstage, Tracy shows Liz his gun, which she takes away from him. She fires it by {{accident}} and ends up shooting Steven in the buttocks. He thinks she shot him because he was going through her purse and calls her a racist. Following this, Ridikolous comes in and says that Jack has made <b>a</b> <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> award, adding: [...] "Wait until I tell Tupac about this!".

More than one Commonwealth member state hosted training facilities for black communist guerrillas, he said, which threatened all [...] "civilised states in Africa".

Zissu also requested {{a meeting with the}} communist General Secretary, Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej, asking him to approve of his emigration project. He followed up with displays of radical defiance: he made <b>a</b> public <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Stockholm Peace Appeal, which was being circulated in the Romanian intellectual community, refusing to sign it because he [...] "wanted war".

[...] "Premature Burial", [...] "ostensibly inspired" [...] by Edgar Allan Poe's short story of the same name, is the track from which the album title had been taken.

500|$|On February 19, Fox News {{and various}} right-wing {{commentators}} including Glenn Beck claimed that Swagger and Colter's characters were <b>a</b> <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tea Party movement meant to [...] "demonize" [...] the Tea Party. WWE {{responded to the}} criticism by stating that they were incorporating [...] "current events into [...] storylines" [...] to [...] "create compelling and relevant content for [...] audience" [...] and that [...] "this storyline in no way represents WWE’s political point of view". WWE followed by having Swagger and Colter break character during a video to invite Beck to appear on Raw while justifying that the storyline was designed to elicit a crowd response for the protagonist, Alberto Del Rio, and the antagonists, Swagger and Colter, while remaining within a PG rating, unlike several high-rated scripted dramas that use murder and rape in their storylines. Beck rejected the invitation. On the March 18 episode of Raw, Swagger broke the ankle of Del Rio's ring announcer Ricardo Rodriguez after Rodriguez tried to save Del Rio from Swagger's vicious assault.|$|E
500|$|If {{a concerted}} effort {{had been made by}} Birmingham's Anglican elite to attack the Dissenters, it was more than likely the work of Benjamin Spencer, a local minister, Joseph Carles, a Justice of the Peace and landowner, and John Brooke (1755-1802), an attorney, coroner, and under-sheriff. Although present at the riot's outbreak, Carles and Spencer made no attempt to stop the rioters, and Brooke seems to have led them to the New Meeting chapel. Witnesses agreed [...] "that the magistrates promised the rioters {{protection}} so long as they restricted their attacks to the meeting-houses and left persons and property alone". The magistrates also refused to arrest any of the rioters and released those that had been arrested. Instructed by the national government to prosecute the riot's instigators, these local officials dragged their heels. When finally forced to try the ringleaders, they intimidated witnesses and made <b>a</b> <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trial proceedings. Only seventeen of the fifty rioters who had been charged were ever brought to trial; four were convicted, of whom one was pardoned, two were hanged, and the fourth was transported to Botany Bay. But Priestley and others believed that these men were found guilty not because they were rioters but because [...] "they were infamous characters in other respects".|$|E

A decade after Jethro Tull defeated Metallica, Ulrich admitted: [...] "I'd be lying if I didn't tell you I was disappointed.

Vig added that [...] "'Only Happy When It Rains' was about what happened with grunge and the angst-filled thing which has dominated the American alternative rock scene. With us there's self-deprecation, we have to poke fun at ourselves because we're so incredibly obsessive about the songs and the lyrics, which makes us filled with self-loathing, hurhur." [...] Garbage said they referenced both the title of The Jesus and Mary Chain song [...] "Happy When It Rains" [...] (1987) and Manson's own Scottish psyche. Lyrically, Manson described [...] "Only Happy When It Rains" [...] as [...] "about wanting love but knowing life will always get in the way.... yet not being obliterated by that. It's a song for people that know {{what it is like to}} live on the dark side of life. It's about devotion but a different kind. A devotion to the truth and to freedom... and to hell with the consequences." ...|$|E
500|$|Harrison {{wrote the}} Hindustani {{classical}} music-inspired [...] "Within You Without You" [...] after {{the decision was}} made to abandon his composition [...] "Only a Northern Song", which the band had recorded earlier in the sessions. The lyrics reflect Harrison's immersion in the teachings of the Hindu Vedas while the song's musical form and Indian instrumentation, such as sitar, tabla, dilrubas and tamburas, recall the Hindu devotional tradition known as bhajan. The track features a tempo rubato that is without precedent in the Beatles' catalogue. The pitch is derived from the eastern Khamaj scale, which is akin to the Mixolydian mode in the West. MacDonald regards the song as [...] "the most distant departure from the staple Beatles sound in their discography", and a work that represents the [...] "conscience" [...] of the LP through the lyrics' rejection of Western materialism. Womack calls it [...] "quite arguably, the album's ethical soul" [...] as a concise reflection of the Beatles' and the counterculture's perspective during the Summer of Love era. The track ends with a burst of laughter that some listeners interpret as <b>a</b> <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> song, but Harrison explained: [...] "It's a release after five minutes of sad music... You were supposed to hear the audience anyway, as they listen to Sergeant Pepper's Show. That was the style of the album." [...] Martin used the moment of levity as a segue for what he describes as the album's [...] "jokey track" [...] – [...] "When I'm Sixty-Four".|$|E

Phoenix later declared that {{she was tired of}} the [...] "perky bimbos" [...] that comprised the rest of the Divas division, and was on a mission to make <b>a</b> <b>mockery</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other Divas, and was joined by Natalya to form The Divas of Doom.

Throughout September, The Divas of Doom feuded with Kelly and Eve Torres on Raw and The Chickbusters (AJ and Kaitlyn) on SmackDown. Phoenix challenged Kelly for the Divas Championship again at Night of Champions, but was unsuccessful. At Hell in a Cell in October, Phoenix defeated Kelly to win the Divas Championship for the first time, with help from Natalya. In a rematch on the October 14 episode of SmackDown, Phoenix successfully retained the championship. At Vengeance, Phoenix successfully defended the championship against Eve Torres, with both Natalya and Kelly banned from ringside.

2500|$|At World War 3 on November 23, 1997, Cain debuted {{under the}} ring name Lodi ("Idol" [...] spelled backwards, which came about {{due to his}} {{perceived}} resemblance to rock musician Billy Idol). Lodi was introduced {{as a member of}} Raven's Flock as an injury replacement for Stevie Richards. He accompanied his fellow Flock members to ringside carrying a variety of signs, which he displayed to the audience at intervals (a gimmick borrowed from ECW's Sign Guy Dudley). The signs were generally intended to be humorous and variously furthered storylines, antagonized the audience, promoted the Flock, and made inside jokes aimed at other wrestlers. Cain made his in-ring debut on the December 8 episode of Nitro, losing to Chris Benoit. Lodi disappeared from WCW television several months later after suffering a fractured ankle in a match against Psicosis. Upon his return, Lodi would become involved in the feud between Saturn and Raven. Lodi defeated Saturn in a match on WCW Thunder thanks to Kanyon, which then meant Saturn had to be Lodi's personal assistant till the PPV.
