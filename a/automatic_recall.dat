Perceptions of violence were measured using a modified version of the Violence Sensitivity Magnitude Estimation Scale (VSMES) which asks participants to rate a series of behaviors as to the severity of violence. Trait aggression was found to mediate the relationship between emotion and perceptions of violence. No significant differences were found between the two methods or the five emotion groups. However, significant differences between violence-sensitive and violence-tolerant groups were found, confirming findings from the previous literature. Future research and implications using the VSMES are discussed. ...|$|R

Soong is shocked to learn Lore was reassembled, and when Lore attempts to claim the emotion chip as his own, Soong acknowledges that the androids are identical apart from minor variations in programming, but that the emotion chip is still meant for Data alone. With Lore's revelation, Soong decides to rest before implanting the chip, leaving Data and Lore to talk. When he returns, he proceeds to implant the chip but discovers too late that Lore had managed to deactivate Data and switch clothing with him, such that he now possesses the emotion chip. Soong tries to warn Lore the chip is not meant for him, but Lore instead strikes Soong and transports off the planet.|$|E
5000|$|In 1966, the Government of The Bahamas, by an Act of Parliament, {{incorporated}} the Telecommunications Department as the Bahamas Telecommunications Corporation, a quasi-governmental corporation, known as Batelco. In 1967, the formerly expatriate-run Batelco got its first all-Bahamian Executive team, {{under the direction}} of R.E. Knowles, the first Bahamian General Manager. In 1971, direct distance dialing was introduced for Batelco operators and in 1972, under new General Manager Albury E. Curling, a $7 million submarine cable was installed from West Palm Beach to Eight Mile Rock through a joint venture agreement between AT & T and Batelco. Robert Bartlett took the reins of the Corporation on October 15, 1979, when he became General Manager. Under Mr. Bartlett’s administration, Batelco moved from its rented location in the Chase Building on Thompson Boulevard to its own offices on John F. Kennedy Drive, where the company’s headquarters is currently located. [...] In 1986 the Corporation joined the Caribbean Association of National Telecommunications Organizations (CANTO) and hosted its annual meeting and trade show, as well as acquiring the assets of The Grand Bahama Telephone Company. It was also in the late eighties that Cellular Telephone Service was inaugurated in The Bahamas. In 1990, Robert Bartlett retired and Barrett Russell succeeded him as General Manager. In February 1992, fibre optics became a part of the Batelco system, enabling system upgrades throughout the archipelago, including Inagua where service was introduced in March of that year. Sir Albert Miller took over as Executive Chairman of Batelco in 1995. The following year, on April 10, 1996, an agreement was signed for the engineering and installation of the Bahamas II Submarine Cable and, on August 26, Batelco entered the internet market with the introduction of Batelnet. The 1990s ended with the introduction of CLASS to residential customers, bringing them caller id, <b>automatic</b> <b>recall</b> {{and a number of other}} features. The end of the millennium also saw significant upgrades to its fiber optic system, including a 26 million dollar cable between Vero Beach, Florida and Eight Mile Rock owned by a consortium with Batelco and AT&T as the Terminal parties.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of students• Number Sense {{has become a}} recent focus in primary mathematics education. Students also often learn the multiplication tables by rote {{in order to develop}} <b>automatic</b> <b>recall</b> of multiplication facts. One view of mathematics learning suggests that <b>automatic</b> <b>recall</b> of number facts is an important step to developing number sense, while another view suggests that rote learning to develop <b>automatic</b> <b>recall</b> of multiplication facts may interfere with the constructivist learning environment that is required to develop number sense.

40|$|A b s t r a c t Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{construct}} automatically a knowledge base concerning the pharmacodynamic properties of antibiotics and a visualization tool. Design: The authors studied the various guidelines used to write the pharmacodynamics section of the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) for antibiotics and constructed a conceptual model of the information. Particular words, syntagms, and punctuation elements were marked in the SPC texts, and automatic extraction was then used to build a knowledge base. This base was used to create dynamic HTML tables displaying the activity spectra of the antibiotics. Measurements: The authors analyzed the performances of <b>automatic</b> extraction (<b>recall</b> and precision). Results: The conceptual pharmacodynamics model dealt with antibiotics, pathogens, susceptibility tests, and the prevalence of resistance. Automatic extraction had a recall rate of 97. 9 % and a precision of 96. 2 %. The tool displaying antibiotic spectra and resistance prevalences used color codes to identify differences in susceptibility.

40|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>recall</b> of all {{the basic}} number facts is a major {{objective}} in primary school mathematics. This is an objective that is not easily attained. Many students have problems acquiring the skills which lead to correct and immediate responses (<b>automatic</b> <b>recall)</b> for all the basic number facts. Knowledge of the basic number facts is essential for undertaking all computation efficiently. These basic facts are defined as 0 + 0 to 9 + 9 for addition and their subtractive opposites; and 0 x 0 to 9 x 9 for multiplication and their inverses in division. This is a total of 390 facts which must be learned, but {{the scope of the}} task can be reduced by an understanding of basic properties such as commutativity, and the properties of zero and one.

40|$|The tuning {{system of}} a {{keyboard}} instrument is chosen so that frequently used musical intervals sound as consonant as possible.

In this paper we develop a harpsichord-specific transcription system to analyse over 500 recordings of solo harpsichord music for which the temperament is specified on the CD sleeve notes. We compare the measured temperaments with the annotations and discuss the differences between temperament as a theoretical construct and as a practical issue for professional performers and tuners. The implications are that ground truth is not always scientific truth, and that content-based analysis has an important role in the study of historical performance practice. 1...|$|R
30|$|Based on {{collection}} samples, a semi-automatic {{approach for}} {{the estimation of}} recall and precision values for various similarity thresholds minimizes efforts involved by static similarity threshold definitions [28, 29]. It requires expert input only where the number of distinct objects contained in each sample is concerned and uses two techniques to reduce human interaction, namely (i) sample use and (ii) similarity cluster process. Hence, the formed groups are used for <b>automatic</b> calculation of <b>recall</b> and precision then that resultant groups contain only objects that represent singular real objects. These clusters identify relevant objects so that when a particular object cluster is used for search, all its remaining objects are labeled relevant. Consequently, this approach generates a table of estimated recall and precision values from which it becomes possible to determine the appropriate similarity threshold for the application. Despite significantly reducing heavy expert reliance (usual in classical approaches), the proposed approach depends on specialist intervention to indicate the number of distinct objects contained in each sample. This limits the size of generated samples and reduces the number of distinct objects, {{making it possible for}} specialists to quantify them.|$|R

40|$|Students with {{learning}} difficulties need {{different forms of}} help and sufficient opportunities {{in order to gain}} the knowledge and to reach the goals (Magajna et al., 2008). It has been shown that a cross-age assistance or a cross-age tutoring is one among successful methods of approaching the students {{with learning}} difficulties. The cross-age tutoring involves students of different age and needs, where older students provide help to the younger counterparts (hhtp://www. readingrockets. org/article/ 22029). A multiplication table is a part of a mathematical declarative knowledge. Mathematical facts stored in memory networks have different power which affect the speed of a recall (Snyder, 2005). Beside the ability of an <b>automatic</b> <b>recall</b> the children need to have an adequate conceptual knowledge of numbers and a sufficient counting strategy (Hopkins and Egeberg, 2009, Mrak, 2010). In order to achieve the automaticity of arithmetical facts and procedures, the children need to practice and mechanically exercise or directly learn the strategies. Many children, especially those with specific arithmetic difficulties have problems in recalling the basic arithmetic facts and procedures during the basic schooling, which means that they memorize less facts and less procedures than their counterparts. The former also forget the facts faster than the latter (Kavkler et al., 2004). The purpose of the diploma thesis is to find out whether the cross-age tutoring can increase motivation of the students with learning difficulties in learning multiplication table and whether it can influence the progression in the automaticity of multiplication facts. In the thesis I also intend to find out what opinion have students-tutors, students with learning difficulties, their teachers and parents toward the cross-age tutoring. A sample included 15 students from four different schools. Eight students out of fifteen have general learning difficulties in mathematics, seven students have a deficient knowledge in specific areas of learning and also specific learning difficulties in mathematics. In the research also participated their parents, students-tutors and teachers who teach the students with learning difficulties. As a method of research I used the opinion poll. Another opinion poll was used to measure the children's motivation in learning the multiplication table. Before and after the process of cross-age tutoring, all the the children were tested in the multiplication table knowledge and controlled whether they made a progression in the automaticity. The cross-age tutoring took place from the april 2015 to the june 2015, during the morning and afternoon day care and one school hour a week. The results of the research has shown that all the participants have a positive attitude toward the cross-age tutoring. The cross-age tutoring has also increased the children's with learning difficulties motivation in learning the multiplication table. The results of a final testing of the multiplication capacities have shown a progress in the automacity of multiplication table in the students with learning difficulties that were helped by the tutors. ...|$|E
40|$|Virtual {{environments that}} are {{inhabited}} by agents {{with a human}} like embodiment have many practical applications nowadays, {{in areas such as}} entertainment, education, psychotherapy, industrial training, or reconstitution of historical environments. These are examples of areas that may benefit from a flexible platform that supports the generation and rendering of animated scenes with intelligent virtual humans. The IViHumans platform is currently being built with this perspective in mind. The platform is divided in two layers: one for graphical processing and another for articial intelligence computation. It was projected to provide a set of features which automatically takes care of many issues that are common to applications integrating virtual humans and virtual environments. This document focuses on the conception and development of the Graphical Processing layer, which constitutes the ground for the Articial Intelligence layer. The connection between the two layers is also addressed. The layers were projected to run in diferent processes, communicating by means of a simple, yet efective and extensible client/server protocol that we idealized and implemented. The tasks of the graphical processing layer rely, first of all, on graphical representations. For that matter, we highlight the techniques used in 3 D object modeling. We also focus on our design and implementation and on how we applied the principles of object oriented design to confer flexibility to the platform. Reynolds' conception of movement is applied according to our own view, to make virtual humans and other objects steer autonomously in the world, while displaying consistent animations that are automatically chosen according to character specific rules. We expose our solution for facial expressions that can be mixed to transmit complex emotions and that are subject to automatic smooth transitions.
