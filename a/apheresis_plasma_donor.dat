40|$|Background and Objectives Plasma pools for the {{production}} of human plasma medicinal products are distinguished according to the collection method (recovered or <b>apheresis</b> <b>plasma)</b> and the <b>donor</b> remuneration status. National regulations and the physical status of the donor determine the donation frequency and plasma volume per session. Relevant protein contents of different types of pools have not fully been compared. Materials and Methods We compared the levels of total protein, 15 main relevant plasma protein markers, and anti-B 19 and anti-Streptococcus pneumoniae IgG in single-type pools of donations from different countries (Belgium, Finland, France, the Netherlands, Germany, United States). Both recovered <b>plasma</b> from non-remunerated <b>donors</b> and <b>apheresis</b> <b>plasma</b> from remunerated and non-remunerated donors were studied. Results Pools from paid US high-frequency, high-volume plasmapheresis donors showed significantly lower total protein () 9 %), albumin () 15 %), total IgG () 24 %), IgM () 28 %), hemopexin () 11 %) and retinol-binding protein () 10 %) but higher C 1 inhibitor, pre-albumin and C-reactive protein contents than pools from unpaid European Union (EU) or US whole-blood or plasmapheresis donors. In contrast to pools from compensated EU plasmapheresis donors, pools from unpaid whole-blood or plasmapheresis donors showed no significant differences, whatever the collection method or country. Reductions in specific protein contents correlated well with protein half-life. Conclusion These results should be taken into account with regard to donor health management and protein recovery.

40|$|Background and Aims:  Commercial plasma {{donation}} {{was introduced}} in China in the 1970 s. Cases of non‐A, non‐B hepatitis (hepatitis C) continued to occur, with multiple outbreaks among <b>plasma</b> <b>donors</b> in Guan county, Hebei province between 1972 and 1990. The outcomes of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in these paid <b>plasma</b> <b>donors</b> from six villages of Guan county were followed up for 12 – 19  years. Methods:  A total of 402 <b>plasma</b> <b>donors</b> with HCV infection were enrolled since anti‐HCV‐positive in 1991 or 1998. Follow up was maintained until death {{or the end of}} the observation period. No antiviral treatment was applied during the period of infection. Results:  Follow up was lost in 23 cases. After a 12 – 19 ‐year follow up, 31 donors died, with the cause of death directly related to liver disease in 15 cases, and an overall mortality of 8. 18 % (31 / 379). The incidence of liver cirrhosis was 10. 03 %, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) was 2. 90 %. The rate of viral spontaneous clearing was 20. 32 % (77 / 379), and 13. 69 % (23 / 168) in males and 25. 59 % (54 / 211) in females. In May 2010, detections were performed in 348 cases. Abnormality of liver function was related to HCV viremia. Sex and alcohol intake impacted the outcome of HCV infection. There was no correlation between the viral spontaneous clearance with age of infection and genotype. Conclusions:  This area has a high rate of chronicity in HCV infection due to plasma donation. Twenty‐five years after virus infection, liver cirrhosis or HCC developed in one‐tenth of patients, with an overall mortality of 8. 18 %...|$|R

40|$|HIV {{infection}} {{cannot be}} detected immediately after exposure because plasma viral loads {{are too small}} initially. The duration of this phase of infection (the “eclipse period”) is difficult to estimate because precise dates of exposure are rarely known. Therefore, the reliability of clinical HIV testing {{during the first few}} weeks of infection is unknown, creating anxiety among HIV-exposed individuals and their physicians. We address this by fitting stochastic models of early HIV infection to detailed viral load records for 78 <b>plasma</b> <b>donors,</b> taken during the period of exposure and infection. We first show that the classic stochastic birth-death model does not satisfactorily describe early infection. We therefore apply a different stochastic model that includes infected cells and virions separately. Since every <b>plasma</b> <b>donor</b> in our data eventually becomes infected, we must condition the model to reflect this bias, before fitting to the data. Applying our best estimates of unknown parameter values, we estimate the mean eclipse period to be 8 – 10 days. We further estimate the reliability of a negative test t days after potential exposure...|$|R

In 1996, the Southern Weekend newspaper ran a front-page story and devoted another two pages to AIDS in China. This coverage was the first time any comprehensive exposure of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in China had been published by the Chinese press. From 1999, the international and subsequently the national media reported on the thousands of infected <b>plasma</b> <b>donors</b> in Henan and neighbouring provinces who did not have access to services. Although the government had acted quickly when the tragedy became apparent in 1995 by shutting down collection stations and, later, introducing new laws and regulations on the collection and management of blood and blood products, provision of HIV testing, prevention, and care for donors in the local areas was slower. Progress was stimulated by the media's attention to the plight of the infected <b>plasma</b> <b>donors.</b> Since these initial reports, the HIV/AIDS situation in China has received much attention from the local and international media.|$|R
40|$|Background: Blood {{collection}} following nonstandard operations largely {{increases the}} risks of infectious diseases through cross-contamination. Commercial plasma donation and the resulting HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C epidemics in central China in the 1990 s killed {{more than one million}} people. Many blood banks have since moved to more remote southwest provinces, which have become new suppliers of blood plasma. Methods: Utilizing a primary longitudinal survey, this paper documents commercial plasma donation and estimates its negative health impacts in impoverished rural China using individual fixed effect models. Both the linear regression model and generalized linear models are utilized. Results: Attracted by the financial compensation, a majority of <b>plasma</b> <b>donors</b> are poor, and bear grave consequences of malnutrition and worse health status as a result of unhygienic and frequent donations. Donating plasma is associated with a. 83 standard deviation (SD) decline in self-rated health, a. 54 SD lower self-rated health relative to peers in their age group, a. 74 SD higher chance of being infected with hepatitis, lacking of strength to conduct farm work, and experiencing appetite loss, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting. Discussion: Results indicate an urgent need of more comprehensive and effective interventions on hepatitis screening, diagnosis, and treatment among <b>plasma</b> <b>donors</b> in less developed contexts to eliminate cross-infection of infectious diseases and possible widespread epidemic in the future. Besides, we should encourage voluntary plasma donation to gradually crowd out paid donation...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the influence of plasmapheresis on clinical and haematological recovery time of whole blood or <b>plasma</b> <b>donor</b> goats. For this, 20 clinically healthy adult goats were divided into two groups of ten animals each: control group (not-treated whole blood donor animals), and experimental group (donor animals which were treated with plasmapheresis). Goats were selected and evaluated through physical examination (vital functions) and complementary tests (complete blood counts, total proteins, albumin, globulin, albumin:globulin ratio, urea nitrogen, creatinine, and plasma free haemoglobin) were carried out at the following moments: immediately before and after blood donation, 12, 24, 72, 120, 240, 360, 480, and 720 hours after the procedures. Results were analysed comparing animals in and between both groups (at differents moments of the study). The clinical observations made during the period of 30 days after donation of 20 % of total blood volume, with or without plasmapheresis in the animals of studied groups, were not influenced by these procedures. The results revealed significant variation of eritrogram components, showing the experimental group to have better recovery rates according to time. Based on the results obtained in the present study, plasmapheresis technique application in goats showed to be efficient as a resource to optimize recovery time of blood cell values of <b>plasma</b> <b>donor</b> animals, and did not cause hemolisis during its procedure...|$|R
