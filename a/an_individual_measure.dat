30|$|The use of <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>measure</b> of {{technical}} change is crucial. First, {{we believe that}} the obsolescence of individual skills starts from the very entry of individuals into the labor market. Enduring into a certain industry is the product of pre-entry individual skills like the education level and on-the-job training and learning (which we do not observe). 11 Second, early retirement occurs because the working-life horizon elderly individuals face is short enough to make on-the-job training too costly to bear compared to the potential benefits of remaining in the labor market, net of all demographic, health, and socio-economic characteristics. However, the focus on the last years before retirement {{does not take into account}} the progressive depreciation of individual skills and the role that individual work trajectories play in the decision to retire early. In other words, our measure of working-life technical change allows us to reduce the individual unobserved heterogeneity that is not captured by, e.g., individual fixed effects. Third, <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>measure</b> generates the necessary heterogeneity in technical change across individuals that belong to the same sector that allows us to distinguish sectoral and time effects from the actual technical change faced by individuals.|$|E

For the research of location influence on energy consumption, I have selected ten locations in Slovenia that differ the most in terms of solar radiation (kWh/m 2) and the average air temperature (°C).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} a new (complete) axiomatization {{of quantum mechanics}} (QM) in which we add axioms describing {{the concept of an}} observation. We show that new axioms are clear and evident and based on common sense. Our approach is based on the idea of the observation of properties of <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>measuring</b> system. We distinguish two concepts of a state: the properties of <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>measuring</b> system and the state of an ensemble of systems. Then we prove that the ontic model of QM is inconsistent. This is our main result. This implies the necessity to consider “non-realistic” models for QM in which it is not true that each wave-function describes a possible state of <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> system. Our axiomatization is based on the postulate of the existence of definite outputs of an experiment. Thus the evident reality of the existence of definite outputs implies that our axiomatization is true and verifiable...|$|R

30|$|Our {{goal here}} is to explore in a {{quantitative}} manner the relationship between performance, <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>measure,</b> and success, a collective measure capturing the societal acknowledgement of a given level of performance.

30|$|It {{is clear}} from the wording of the NLES {{question}} that the instrument does not measure problem gambling prevalence or prevalence for any of the items.

Therefore, the NLES gambling problem item measures the reach or extent of gambling problems throughout peoples’ social and family networks and is not <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>measure</b> of problem gambling. This broader conceptualisation of gambling-related harm is consistent with the Australian definition of problem gambling which states that “problem gambling is characterised by difficulties in limiting money and/or time spent on gambling which leads to adverse consequences for the gambler, others, or for the communities” (Neal et al. 2005, p 126).|$|E

Additionally, several questions from the FIT-R that address the ability to make a guilty plea were assessed separately and constituted <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>measure</b> of competency to plead guilty (CoP).

40|$|Any {{measure of}} unobserved {{inflation}} uncertainty relies on specific assumptions which {{are most likely}} not fulfilled completely. This calls into question whether <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>measure</b> delivers a reliable signal. To reduce idiosyncratic measurement error, we propose using common information contained in different measures derived from survey data, a variety of forecast models, and volatility models. We show that all measures are driven by a common component which constitutes an indicator for inflation uncertainty. Moreover, the idiosyncratic component of survey disagreement contains systematic measurement error during economic downturns. Finally, we study the Friedman-Ball hypothesis. Using the indicator, {{it turns out that}} higher inflation is followed by higher uncertainty. By contrast, we obtain contradictory results for the individual measures. We also document that, after an inflationary shock, uncertainty decreases in the first two months which is traceable to the energy component in CPI inflation.

3000|$|The k-core {{value is}} <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>measure</b> of {{importance}} {{based on the}} core structure of the network. A k-core {{is defined as the}} largest subnetwork comprising nodes of degree at least k. Note that to compute this measure we consider the undirected network, i.e., we consider every link as if it was undirected, and therefore a node of degree k is a node whose total degree is k=k_in+k_out. The k-core decomposition method assigns an integer number to every node in the network, obtained by a recursive pruning of their links. The procedure starts with isolated nodes, which are assigned a k-core value k_c= 0. Then, nodes with degree k= 1 are removed along with their links, and assigned k_c= 1. If any of the remaining nodes is left with k= 1 connections it is also removed and contained in the k_c= 1 core. The process continues with k_c= 2, 3, [...]... until every node has been assigned to a k_c shell. This metric goes beyond degree, as it takes into account the centrality of the neighbors to define the centrality of a node.|$|E

40|$|Negative {{symptoms}} in schizophrenia have been grouped into the 2 factors of apathy and diminished expression, {{which might be}} caused by separable pathophysiological mechanisms. Recently, it has been proposed that apathy {{could be due to}} dysfunctional integration of reward and effort during decision making. We asked whether apathy in particular is associated with stronger devaluation ("discounting") of monetary rewards that require physical effort. Thirty-one patients with schizophrenia and 20 healthy control participants performed a computerized effort discounting task in which they could choose to exert physical effort on a handgrip to obtain monetary rewards. This procedure yields <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> <b>measure</b> for the strength of effort discounting. The degree of effort discounting was strongly correlated with apathy, but not with diminished expression. Importantly, the association between apathy and effort discounting was not driven by cognitive ability, antipsychotic medication, or other clinical and demographic variables. This study provides the first evidence for a highly specific association of apathy with effort-based decision making in patients with schizophrenia. Within a translational framework, the present effort discounting task could provide a bridge between apathy as a psychopathological phenomenon and established behavioral tasks to address similar states in animals...|$|E
