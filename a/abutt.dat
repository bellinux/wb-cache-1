50|$|The {{course of}} the old river acts as a {{boundary}} for Bishop Norton {{and all the other}} parishes that <b>abutt</b> it. This being the eastern boundary; the western boundary is Ermine Street. The fact that the majority of archaeology in the parish, as recorded in the HER that dates from after the construction of the Roman Road, tends to the western end of the parish close to the Roman road, and that from earlier periods tends to be closer to the river is suggestive that the River was a primary communications route as well as the provider of physical and economic need which was supplanted by the new road.|$|E

There are sports pitches at Greenway Centre to the South East, and at Charlton Mead to the East of the area. Filton Golf Course <b>abutts</b> Southmead to the North East. There is an excellent MUGA and Adventure Playground off Doncaster Road. There are also play areas off of Glencoyne Square, Charlton Mead and off Greystoke Avenue. To the South of Southmead, only a mile away, is Horfield Sports Centre with public access to 3G pitches, gym, sports Hall and an excellent swimming pool.|$|R

40|$|The {{marriage}} registers of 13 parishes in County Durham {{are considered}} {{in an attempt}} to establish rates of endogamy, exogamy and a spatial context of mobility. The 13 parishes fall into three broad geographic areas: four parishes are situated in the Pennine uplands, five lie in the centre of the county and four <b>abutt</b> the coast. The study commences with the earliest suitable marriage register available for each parish and concludes at the end of 1812. In addition in 11 of the parishes the marriage registers of 1795 - 1812 is annotated with the parish of nativity disclosed in the subsequent baptismal registers of 1798 - 1812 to enable comparisons to be drawn (in respect of endogamy, exogamy and mobility patterns) with the results obtained in the study from the marriage registers generally and specifically with the marriage register of 1795 - 1812. Similar comparisons are also made between the three groups of parishes...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Brasergasilus jaraquensis gen. et sp. nov. and B. anodus sp. nov. (Copepoda: Cyclopidea: Ergasilidae), gill parasites of Semaprochiiodus insignis (Schomburgk) and Anodus elongatus Spix, are {{described}} from the Amazon River. The new genus has only {{three pairs of}} swimming legs and in this respect is similar only to one species from New Zealand, Abergasilus amplexus Hewitt, 1978. The two genera also have in common a three-segmented prehensile antenna. Abergasilus, however, has {{the base of the}} second antennal segment developed into a massive spine which <b>abutts</b> against the claw-like third segment. The new genus completely lacks this fundamental structure. Aditionally, Abergasilus has six free thoracic segments while the new genus only has five. Abergasilinae Subfam. nov. is proposed for these two genera and their three species. Ergasilinae nom. nov. is provisionally defined and proposed to include the other 11 genera of the family. The type species of Brasergasilus gen. nov. is B. jaraquensis sp. nov. and it can be distinguished from B. anodus sp. nov. by the following characteristics: 1) The type species is larger and of a greenish coloration while B. anodus has fewer pigment granules that are of a bluish tint. 2) B. jaraquensis has a more slender second antenna and the most abrupt bend of the claw occurs distally; the second antenna of B. anodus is thicker and the abrupt bend Is found proximally. 3) The uropod of the type species has two setae and two small spines, while that of the other species has three setae and lacks spines. 4) The first leg of B. jaraquensis is laterally serrate while that of B. anodus is pectinate. The two species parasitize two different genera of host fish and are probably host specific...|$|R
40|$|In Australia {{the frog}} family Microhylidae is largely {{restricted}} to tropical rainforests of the Wet Tropics {{region in the}} northeast of the country, but in that region the family is diverse. Only one species, Cophixalus ornatus, is widespread in the Wet Tropics {{but there has been}} suspicion that it may comprise multiple species. A recent study (Hoskin et al. 2011) assessed genetic and phenotypic variation across the range of C. ornatus, finding three deeply divergent genetic lineages that differ in mating call and some aspects of morphology. Two of these lineages <b>abutt</b> in the central Wet Tropics and in that area hybridization was found to be very limited despite sympatry at high densities. Based on multiple lines of data, Hoskin et al. (2011) concluded that the three genetic lineages represent biological species. The taxonomy of these three lineages is resolved here. I describe two new species, Cophixalus australis sp. nov. and Cophixalus hinchinbrookensis sp. nov., and redescribe C. ornatus. The three species are not distinguishable based on any single morphological or call trait and are best identified by genetics or locality. The distributions of the three species are largely allopatric. Cophixalus ornatus is found in rainforest in the northern Wet Tropics, C. australis sp. nov. occurs in rainforest and adjacent wet sclerophyll forests in the central and southern Wet Tropics, and C. hinchinbrookensis sp. nov. inhabits rainforest and montane heath on Hinchinbrook Island. All three species are common. Cophixalus australis sp. nov. contains three genetic subgroups that are considered a single species based on phenotypic similarity and high levels of hybridization at contact zones. Th...|$|E
