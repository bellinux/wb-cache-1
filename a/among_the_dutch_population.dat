[...] made the first sortie of the flotilla on 9 April, and UB-10 departed on her first patrol soon after.

As a direct result of UB-10s sinking of Katwijk, and to avoid further provoking the Dutch or other neutrals (primarily the United States), the German government issued an order on 18 April that no neutral vessels were to be attacked. The German government later paid compensation for the sinking of Katwijk.|$|E
500|$|By {{the middle}} of August 1797, after six weeks of {{constant}} easterly winds that kept his ships trapped in their harbour, De Winter decided that an attempt to join the French at Brest as {{the first stage of}} an invasion of Ireland was impractical and he abandoned the plan. In part this decision was due to the strength of Duncan's reconstituted fleet, which had increased to 17 ships of the line with the addition of the vessels returned from the Nore. Duncan's men were also better trained and more experienced than their Dutch counterparts, having spent considerably longer at sea and having been taught to fire three rounds a minute to the Dutch two. In addition to his concerns about the proficiency of his men, De Winter was also worried about their loyalty: the dominion of France over the Batavian Republic and the country's enforced participation in distant theatres of warfare were unpopular among the Dutch people. Although De Winter was an avowed republican, who had fought in the French Army against the Netherlands between 1793 and 1795, support for the House of Orange remained strong <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> <b>population</b> and with the fleet's sailors.

The results from large-scale victimization survey data <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> general <b>population</b> (N 6, 201) reveal that people with low self-control run substantially higher victimization risk, as well as active online shoppers and people participating in online forums.

This suggests that, within similar situations, people with low self-control respond differently to deceptive online commercial offers...|$|R

Absolute incidence rates were calculated within each age-sex-period-country of birth group. Regardless of ethnic background, AMI incidence rates were higher in men than in women and increased with age. Incidence significantly declined over time <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> majority <b>population</b> (men: - 26. 8 %, women: - 26. 7 %), and among most migrant groups under study.

DESIGN: Retrospective. METHOD: Based on data from <b>the</b> 'Second <b>Dutch</b> national study into morbidity and interventions in general practice', we compared the prevalence of asthma and COPD in the different ethnic groups. In addition, we compared the use of various airway medications and the number of general practice contacts between these ethnic groups. RESULTS: We analysed data of 240, 067 indigenous Dutch, 2, 942 Turkish, 2, 416 Moroccan and 3, 320 Surinamese subjects. Asthma is more prevalent among Surinamese and seems less prevalent among Moroccans.

However, the extent to which national pride can be increased by national sporting success seems to be rather limited. The data show that national performances in international sport events may lead to small, short-term eruptions in feelings of national sporting pride and well-being, especially among athletes, men and non-immigrants. However, the results indicate that national pride is a rather stable characteristic of national identification that cannot easily be increased by improving national sporting success and winning more Olympic medals. © The Author(s) 2012...|$|R

Therefore, we studied the prevalence by age, awareness, treatment, and control of type 2 diabetes, among a multiethnic population. Methods.

The prevalence of diabetes was analysed by sex, ethnicity, and 10 -year age groups. Ethnic differences in the prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of diabetes were studied by logistic regression. Results. From the age of 31 - 40 years and older, the prevalence of diabetes was 3 to 12 times higher among ethnic minority groups than that <b>among</b> <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> host <b>population.</b> Awareness and medical treatment of diabetes were 2 to 5 times higher among ethnic minorities than that among Dutch.

Our results suggest that the age limit for case finding among ethnic minority groups should be lower than that for the general population. Importantly, despite higher awareness and treatment among ethnic minorities, glycemic control was low, suggesting a need for increased efforts to improve the effectiveness of treatment in these group...|$|R
40|$|Background: Our aim is {{to present}} average values and {{prevalence}} of electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities <b>among</b> <b>the</b> general <b>Dutch</b> <b>population</b> in <b>the</b> LifeLines Cohort. Hypothesis: The ECG values previously studied in the Caucasian population of smaller cohorts will be confirmed with ECG data from LifeLines. Methods:  ECG data of 152 180 individuals age 18 to 93 years were available. Individuals with cardiovascular risk factors were excluded to analyze the healthy population. Average values of the ECG for the healthy population were presented as means with 95 % and 99 % confidence intervals and as medians with first and 99 th percentiles. Results: Median heart rate was highest in the youngest and oldest individuals of the healthy population. Median duration of P wave, PQ interval, and QRS duration were longer in males compared with females. In contrast, median QT interval corrected for heart rate was higher in females. In general, the above-mentioned parameters increased with age. The prevalences of ECG abnormalities adjusted for <b>the</b> <b>Dutch</b> <b>population</b> were 0. 9 % for atrial fibrillation or flutter, 1. 4 % for premature atrial complexes, 0. 5 % for myocardial infarction, 2. 1 % for ventricular premature complexes, 1. 0 % for left ventricular hypertrophy, 8. 1 % for P-R interval > 200 ms, and 0. 8 % for bundle branch block. Conclusions: Our study {{provides an overview of}} average values and ECG abnormalities and confirms data of previous smaller studies. In addition, we evaluate the age- and sex-dependent normal limits of the P wave and QRS duration and confirm in detail the frontal plane QRS-T angle on the ECG...|$|R
