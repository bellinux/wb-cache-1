Stormwater management is one part of the concept sustainable development but traditional practices entail adverse effects on social-ecological systems and {{there is a need for}} increasing the resilience of urban stormwater systems.  The growing pressure from climate change and intensified urbanization increase the need for stormwater management. If poorly managed the security and functioning of societies will be negatively affected. Regulations are essential in the achievement of sustainable urban environments. However, national regulations concerning stormwater management are spread through different legal frameworks from different times and it has been recognized that the spread could challenge implementation of the regulations and climate change adaptation. <b>Administrative</b> <b>instruments</b> are important to support the social, economic and ecological value of green and blue structures. The thesis target to analyze relevant regulations and investigate their effectiveness for a sustainable stormwater management through combined interpretation methods based on the intention behind the law and their function in society. The thesis claims that consequences of poorly regulated sustainable stormwater management results in an inefficient use of resources and pose a risk for the environment. Sustainable development is not visible in any article in the Law on General Water Services and it therefore risk to be overlooked in practice. The issues of urban stormwater need to be more integrated in the municipal work and planning processes.

The Franks were clustered at Nicosia, what raises the question of the seigniorial domains' organization : in every case, a bailli, appointed by the lord, directly managed the exploitation, with the assistance of Greek or Syrian secretaries who paid the domain's tax to Nicosia. The economical structure thus perfectly reflects the hierarchical organization of the political and administrative powers : it highlights Nicosia as the main outlet for the products of the neighbouring areas which were redistributed and consumed there.

The existence of regional legislation is an important variable that needs to be evaluated and compared in the case study area, in order to analyses the situation and then adopt appropriate methods and local programs. Legislation is the basic <b>administrative</b> <b>instrument.</b> In the Indonesian government structure, each province can manage its regional system of heritage protection and enhancement. However, the effectiveness of the regional legislation in the case study area, Palembang is very reliant on the challenges and dominance of tourism benefits. Importantly, there is also low local public enforcement and awareness, and lack of funding and supervision. Thus, comprehensive legislations urgently required accommodating both historic preservation and conservation tourism management. In addition, the absence of regional legislation in Palembang is a catastrophe for local heritage sites, since it is vital to the improvement of local programs for their protection and enhancement. The results of the analysis lead to recommendations for legislative change and applicable methods for Palembang city.

In this paper, {{referring to a}} study about some hospitals in Lombardy, we formulate convenient correctives to a statistical model based on the translogarithmic function—the most widely used flexible functional form (Christensen et al., 1973, Rev. Econ. Stat., 55, 28 – 45). More specifically, {{in order to take}} into consideration the hierarchical structure of the data (as in Gori et al., 2002, Stat. Appl., 14, 247 – 275), we propose a multilevel model, ignoring for the moment the one-side error specification, typical of stochastic frontier analysis (Aigner et al., 1977, J. Econom., 6, 21 – 37). Given this simplification, however, we are easily able to take into account some typical econometric problems as, e. g. heteroscedasticity. The estimated production function can be used to identify the technical inefficiency of hospitals (as already seen in previous works), but also to draw some economic considerations about scale elasticity, scale efficiency and optimal resource allocation of the productive units. We will show, in fact, that for the translogarithmic specification it is possible to obtain the elasticity of the output (regarding an input) at hospital level as a weighted sum of elasticities at ward level. Analogous results can be achieved for scale elasticity, which measures how output changes in response to simultaneous inputs variation. In addition, referring to scale efficiency and to optimal resource allocation, we will consider the results of Ray (1998, J. Prod. Anal., 11, 183 – 194) to our context. The interpretation of the results is surely an interesting <b>administrative</b> <b>instrument</b> for decision makers in order to analyse the productive conditions of each hospital and its single wards and also to decide the preferable interventions...|$|E

40|$|Defence date: 27 May 2002 Examining Board: Daniel Verdier (Supervisor; European University Institute, San Domenico di Fiesole) Adrienne Héritier (Co-supervisor; Max-Planck Gesellschaft, Bonn) Petros Mavroidis (Université de Neuchâtel) Patrick Messerlin (Institut d’Etudes Politiques, Paris) First made {{available}} online in June 2012. In this PhD dissertation I explain how {{different forms of}} international trade institutions affect domestic coalition patterns. Negotiated trade policy instruments create incentives for sector-wide interest representation, while <b>administrative</b> <b>instruments</b> elicit interest aggregation on a more product-specific, intra-sectoral level. I provide a rationale why reciprocal trade negotiations foster sector-wide associations, whereas trade rule enforcement elicits intra-sectoral coalitions. In contrast to existing explanations, these propositions can account for coalition patterns during both the GATT 1947, which consisted {{of a series of}} trade negotiation rounds, and the WTO (1995 -), which combines negotiations with binding administrative enforcement in the form of international dispute settlement. Comprehensive evidence from EU trade policy lobbying confirms the explanatory force of the hypotheses. Sectoral peak associations co-ordinate interest representation during the GATT and WTO Rounds, whereas private interests predominantly organise on an intra-sectoral level when filing petitions for enforcement instruments administered by the European Commission. Exhaustive databases provide evidence about the predominantly intra-sectoral trade associations that lodge complaints with <b>administrative</b> <b>instruments</b> such as Anti-Dumping, market access investigations and WTO dispute settlement, while other sources reveal how sector-wide peak associations organise during negotiation Rounds. I provide supportive evidence from existing research on interest representation in American trade policy, and control for other factors such as industry concentration and non-trade regulation. The shift from negotiations-only to enforcement is further significant for interest representation in four selected sectors of European industry: chemicals, pharmaceuticals, steel and textiles. Although each of these industries {{has a long history of}} sector coherence, they all reorganised their membership and representation structure to accommodate for the increased importance of enforcement instruments. The adoption of direct company membership and/or the inclusion of product-specific trade associations accompany the decrease in importance of the sectorwide peak association in a world where the provision of detailed information for judicial enforcement is starting to weigh more than the political clout of sector-wide peak associations during negotiations...|$|R

In particular, we aim to shed light on the role of inflation in the conduct of monetary policy by the People’s Bank of China (PBC) in the New Millennium, when both the underlying economy and its monetary policy framework were transformed.

Second, the PBC appears to have built up a monetary policy framework similar to implicit flexible inflation targeting, with a hybrid reaction function, seemingly taking into account the forward-looking aspect of inflation.

We develop a new monetary policy index (MPI) in China by combining quantity, price and <b>administrative</b> <b>instruments</b> and estimate a hybrid (backward- and forward-looking), dynamic, discrete-choice model for the period 2002 – 13. Three main results arise from the paper. First, the Chinese monetary policy changes under PBC Governor Zhou from 2002 onwards have been relatively hawkish and smoothed. Second, the PBC appears to have built up a monetary policy framework similar to implicit flexible inflation targeting, with a hybrid reaction function, seemingly taking into account the forward-looking aspect of inflation. Third, the PBC’s behaviour post- 2002 resembles that of the post- 1979 anti-inflation policy of the G 3 central banks, albeit with a high output weight typical of emerging economies...|$|R
