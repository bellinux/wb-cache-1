The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit in the United States of 5mg/m3 (time-weighted average). In 1989, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) set a legal permissible exposure limit for aspirin of 5mg/m3, but this was vacated by the AFL-CIO v. OSHA decision in 1993.|$|E

25|$|The {{rules for}} {{unregistered}} land remained as before. But under the LRA 2002 Schedule 6, paragraphs 1 to 5, after 10 years the adverse possessor {{is entitled to}} apply to the registrar to become the new registered owner. The registrar then contacts the registered title holder and notifies him of the application. If no proceedings are launched for two years to eject the adverse possessor, only then would the registrar transfer title. Prior to the 2002 Act, a land owner could simply lose title without being aware of it or notified. This was the rule because it indicated the owner had never paid sufficient <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> the land was in fact being used, and therefore the former owner did not deserve to keep it. Before 2002, time was seen to cure everything. The rule's function was to ensure land was used efficiently.|$|E
25|$|Understanding a {{particular}} musical style's treatment of dissonance—what is considered dissonant and what rules or procedures govern how dissonant intervals, chords, or notes are treated—is key in understanding that particular style. For instance, harmony is generally governed by chords, which are collections of notes defined as tolerably consonant by the style. (There is likely, however, to be {{a hierarchy of}} chords, with some considered more consonant and some more dissonant.) Any note that does not fall within the prevailing harmony is considered dissonant. A given style typically pays <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> its musical structure approaches dissonance (in steps is less jarring, a leap is more jarring), and even more to how they resolve (almost always by step), to how they fit within the meter and rhythm (dissonances on strong beats are more emphatic, those on weaker beats less vital), and to how they lie within the phrase (dissonances tend to resolve at phrase's end).|$|E

25|$|Ernst Mayr's key {{contribution}} to the synthesis was Systematics and the Origin of Species, published in 1942. It asserted the importance of {{and set out to}} explain population variation in evolutionary processes including speciation. He analysed in particular the effects of polytypic species, geographic variation, and isolation by geographic and other means. Mayr emphasized the importance of allopatric speciation, where geographically isolated sub-populations diverge so far that reproductive isolation occurs. He was skeptical of the reality of sympatric speciation believing that geographical isolation was a prerequisite for building up intrinsic (reproductive) isolating mechanisms. Mayr also introduced the biological species concept that defined a species as a group of interbreeding or potentially interbreeding populations that were reproductively isolated from all other populations. Before he left Germany for the United States in 1930, Mayr had been influenced by the work of the German biologist Bernhard Rensch, who in the 1920s had analyzed the geographic distribution of polytypic species, paying particular <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> variations between populations correlated with factors such as differences in climate.|$|E

Continuing this thought, Kellman noted that Cole was [...] "breez through an easygoing set of covers". The BBC's Chris Rogers defined the album as [...] "an ultra smooth mix of standards both tasteful and obtuse". Jay S. Jacobs of PopEntertainment.com compared Leavin [...] to Cole's 1999 release, Snowfall on the Sahara, and viewed it as [...] "jazzy but decidedly more modern and surprisingly strong". Peoples Ralph Novak, Chuck Arnold, V. R. Peterson, and Monica Rizzo commended Cole's decision to [...] "ditch the evening-gown fare on her new CD" [...] by recording more contemporary songs. Gugu Mkhabela from News24 awarded the album three out of five stars, describing the material as [...] "pure old school with a modern twist", with Cole providing [...] "a touch of class and some depth to boot".|$|E

500|$|Master Chief Petty Officer John-117, {{commonly}} referred to as simply the Master Chief, is the main protagonist and main playable character in the Halo trilogy. The character is voiced by Steve Downes, a Chicago disc jockey. One of the last SPARTAN-II supersoldiers still in active service (one of the few survivors of the Fall of Reach), the Master Chief inspires awe and fear in the alien Covenant, who refer to him as (a) [...] "Demon". Assisted by the artificial intelligence Cortana, he prevents the firing of Installation 04 in Halo: Combat Evolved, an event which the player is told would have destroyed all sentient life in the galaxy. Bungie staff member Joseph Staten noted that until the Master Chief was created, Bungie had not paid any <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> to make people want to play in the world. [...] "Master Chief is really what kicked off the creativity," [...] he said, [...] "in terms of how people react to him. He's a space marine in really cool green armor." [...] The character has since become a gaming icon, the mascot of the Xbox, and was rated {{as one of the greatest}} videogame characters of all time by Electronic Gaming Monthly.|$|E
500|$|In {{his last}} year Whorf also {{published}} three articles in the MIT Technology Review titled [...] "Science and Linguistics", [...] "Linguistics as an Exact Science" [...] and [...] "Language and Logic". He was also invited to contribute an article to a theosophical journal, Theosophist, published in Madras, India, for which he wrote [...] "Language, Mind and Reality". In these final pieces he offered a critique of Western science in which he suggested that non-European languages often referred to physical phenomena in ways that more directly reflected aspects of reality than many European languages, and that science ought {{to pay attention to}} the effects of linguistic categorization in its efforts to describe the physical world. He particularly criticized the Indo-European languages for promoting a mistaken essentialist world view, which had been disproved by advances in the sciences, whereas he suggested that other languages dedicated more attention to processes and dynamics rather than stable essences. Whorf argued that paying <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> other physical phenomena are described in the study of linguistics could make valuable contributions to science by pointing out the ways in which certain assumptions about reality are implicit in the structure of language itself, and how language guides the attention of speakers towards certain phenomena in the world which risk becoming overemphasized while leaving other phenomena at risk of being overlooked.|$|E

2500|$|In addition, {{there were}} several sounds that Genie did not use as initial or final consonants. In particular, before 1973 Genie frequently, but not always, deleted final consonants without any {{discernible}} pattern. Researchers suspected this was the reason Genie did not usually use plural forms, possessive markers, and past tense or third person singular conjugations. If someone imitated her deletion of a final consonant she would laugh, reply, [...] "Silly", gesture, and then repeat her utterance with both the final consonant and any other sounds she had initially deleted, causing Curtiss to speculate that Genie simply was not paying <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>how</b> her speech sounded.|$|E
