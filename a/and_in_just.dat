5|$|After {{joining the}} III Battle Squadron in December 1913, Kaiserin {{participated in the}} routine fleet {{training}} exercises. Squadron exercises were conducted in February, followed by fleet maneuvers, both in the North Sea. The fleet trained again in May, in both the North and Baltic Seas. Kaiserin left Germany on 7 July for the annual summer cruise to Norway, but was recalled prematurely on 22 July because of rising international tensions following the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Upon returning to Germany, Kaiserin steamed to Brunsbüttel on 24 July, where {{she was the first}} battleship to traverse the recently deepened Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. The voyage required lightening, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> under twelve hours Kaiserin exited the locks at Holtenau in Kiel where she met the rest of her squadron. On 31 July, the entire squadron returned to the North Sea via the Canal. At midnight on 4 August, the United Kingdom, with its powerful Grand Fleet, declared war on Germany.|$|E
5|$|During the Anarchy, Scotland invaded Northern England {{and took}} {{much of the}} land north of Durham. In the 1139 peace treaty that followed, Prince Henry of Scotland was made Earl of Northumberland and kept the {{counties}} of Cumberland, Westmorland and Northumbria. These reverted to English control in 1157, establishing {{for the most part}} the modern England–Scotland border. The region also saw violence during the Wars of the Roses, including the decisive Battle of Wakefield, although the modern-day conception of the war as a conflict between Lancashire and Yorkshire is anachronistic – Lancastrians recruited from across Northern England, including Yorkshire, while the Yorkists drew most of their power from Southern England, Wales and Ireland. The Anglo-Scottish Wars also touched the region, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> 400 years, Berwick-upon-Tweed – now the northernmost town in England – changed hands more than a dozen times. The wars also saw thousands of Scots settle south of the border, chiefly in the border counties and Yorkshire.|$|E
5|$|The {{peppered}} moth exists in both {{light and dark}} colours in Great Britain, but during the industrial revolution, many of the trees on which the moths rested became blackened by soot, giving the dark-coloured moths an advantage in hiding from predators. This gave dark-coloured moths {{a better chance of}} surviving to produce dark-coloured offspring, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> fifty years from the first dark moth being caught, nearly all of the moths in industrial Manchester were dark. The balance was reversed by the effect of the Clean Air Act 1956, and the dark moths became rare again, demonstrating the influence of natural selection on {{peppered moth}} evolution.|$|E

Hawking's calculation fixed the constant of proportionality at 1/4; the entropy of a black hole is one quarter its horizon area in Planck units.|$|E

25|$|The {{industrialisation}} of Hong Kong was rapid from 1963 through 1970. Pre-existing industries {{continued to}} prosper, while new industries emerged and blossomed as well. The number of factories increased 1.67 {{times and the}} number of workers increased by 1.15 times. The number of factories and workers in 1970 were 16,507 and 549,000 respectively. The latter took up over 40% of the city's employment structure. The value of domestic exports continued to rise, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> two years, rose by 2.72 times to HK$12,347,000,000. Hong Kong was no longer reliant on re-exportation and became an industrialised city.|$|E

He had a good finals campaign, kicking three goals in Collingwood's drawn Semi Final with Essendon and two in the Preliminary Final loss to Melbourne. Lambert ended his career in 1947 with 27 games and 48 goals for Collingwood.|$|E

He was, however, selected for a second University Match and took seven wickets in the game. At the end of the university cricket season, he turned out in a single match for an East of England team against the New Zealand touring team <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> one game for Kent's first team, then playing for Kent's second team in the Minor Counties {{to the end of the}} 1927 season. In 1928, he was tried in several games for Cambridge University, but was badly out of form and failed to retain his place in the side. He did not appear in first-class cricket again.|$|E

25|$|On 22 August, the Spanish forces {{landed in}} Sardinia, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> two months reconquered the whole island, whose {{defenses}} were commanded by the Marquis of Rubi. The quick victory was mainly {{due to the}} psychological action of the Marquis of San Felipe, who toured the island by encouraging its inhabitants, who were {{not happy with the}} Austrian dominion, preferring to return under the Spanish rule. Only the strongholds of Alghero and Castellaragonese and the important city of Cagliari resisted. But soon the Austrian troops in Cagliari commanded by Rubi, in the absence of reinforcements, decided to flee {{to the north of the}} island, and on 4 October, the Spanish took the city. A few days later, on 19 October, Spanish troops led by Lede and the Duke of Montemar laid siege to Alghero, which capitulated on 25 October. Castellaragonese fell on 30 October, and the Spanish victory was complete.|$|E

25|$|The American Federation of Labor (AFL) began {{granting}} charters {{to police}} unions in June 1919 when pressed {{to do so}} by local groups, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> 5 months had recognized affiliate police unions in 37 cities. The Boston police rank and file went out on strike on September 9, 1919 in order to achieve recognition for their union and improvements in wages and working conditions. Police Commissioner Edwin Upton Curtis denied that police officers had any right to form a union, much less one affiliated with a larger organization like the AFL. During the strike, Boston experienced two nights of lawlessness until several thousand members of the State Guard supported by volunteers restored order, though not without causing several deaths. The public, fed by lurid press accounts and hyperbolic political observers, viewed the strike with a degree of alarm out of proportion to the events, which ultimately produced only about $35,000 of property damage.|$|E

500|$|For {{the first}} time since 1993's Vs., the band members did not go into the {{recording}} sessions with any completed songs, only guitar riffs.

[...] The band sat around playing music together and discussed the song arrangements, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> one week had completed ten songs. Ament described it as a [...] "real collaborative effort," [...] and Vedder described it as [...] "absolute democracy." [...] Guitarist Mike McCready stated that the band members were feeling [...] "fresh and energetic" [...] and [...] "were communicating better than ever." [...] Toward the end of the sessions it came down to Vedder to finish up the material, with Ament observing that [...] "the way the record started and the way that it finished is probably two different things." [...] Regarding his lyric writing process, Vedder said that he wrote at least four different sets of lyrics for each song, with many going as high as eight. Vedder described as a process that demands [...] "the patience of like a National Geographic photographer sitting underneath the bush in a tent", adding he would at times [...] "figure out after eight, nine or eleven drafts that the first one was actually the one". A total of 25 songs were written before coming down to the 13 on the final track listing.

500|$|Despite these doubts, the {{cornerstone}} of the new church was laid on July 16, 1899, by Archbishop Adélard Langevin of Saint Boniface. [...] Thomas Ennor Julian and H.J. Williams were hired to be the architects, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> 491 days, the construction was completed. [...] At the time it was finished, the building was praised as [...] "the finest piece of architecture west of Toronto and north of San Francisco." [...] The new Church of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary opened on December 8, 1900 – the Feast of the Immaculate Conception – and was blessed one day later by Archbishop Alexander Christie of Portland, Oregon. [...] By the end of the decade, it became [...] "the most financially important parish" [...] in the archdiocese, since it was the only church that not only could break-even, but could also churn out a surplus. [...] Because of this, Archbishop Timothy Casey wanted to make the church the cathedral for the metropolitan see. [...] The OMI were extremely reluctant to give up their church, and even attempted to give Casey money so that he could buy land elsewhere to build a new cathedral. [...] Nonetheless, the church was elevated to the status of cathedral in 1916, but the Oblates were permitted to remain. [...] The OMI – which administered the parish since 1893 – eventually left in 1927 after difficulties arose from the mortgage agreement that had helped pay for the construction of the cathedral. [...] This was coupled with the [...] "growing manpower shortage" [...] caused by a declining number of members joining the order.|$|E
500|$|The 1939 season {{took place}} under the looming shadow of the coming Second World War, and the {{schedule}} was only halted with the Invasion of Poland in September. The Championship season began with the Belgian Grand Prix in June. In heavy rain, Caracciola spun at La Source, got out and pushed his car off into {{the safety of the}} trees. Later in the race, Seaman left the track at the same corner, his car bursting into flames upon impact with the trees, where he was burnt alive in the cockpit. He died that night in hospital, after briefly regaining consciousness. The entire Mercedes team travelled to London for his burial. In the rest of the season, Caracciola won the German Grand Prix for the sixth and final time, again in the rain, after starting third on the grid. He finished second behind Lang at the Swiss and Tripoli Grands Prix. The latter race was seen as a major win for Mercedes-Benz. In an effort to halt German dominance at the event, the Italian organisers decided to limit engine sizes to 1.5litres (the German teams at the time ran 3-litre engines), and announce the change at the last moment. The change was, however, leaked to Mercedes-Benz well in advance, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>just</b> eight months the firm developed and built two W165s under the new restrictions; both of them beat the combined might of 28Italian cars, much to the disappointment of the organisers.
