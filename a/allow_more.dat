5|$|In 2005, NFF {{launched}} {{plans for}} a redevelopment of Ullevaal, including artificial turf, a retractable roof and redevelopment of the West Stand to increase total capacity to 30,500 spectators. The combination of the three would allow Ullevaal to become a multi-purpose venue and <b>allow</b> <b>more</b> matches to be played, grant the teams more practice time on their home pitch, make room for sponsor events, <b>allow</b> <b>more</b> concerts and potentially allow non-football sports, such as sprint skiing, to be held.|$|E

5|$|A second project, {{the full}} {{duplication}} of the Cronulla branch line, {{was completed in}} 2010. This increases {{the capacity of the}} branch line from four to eight trains per hour. The line between Oatley, Sutherland and Cronulla also received signalling upgrades to <b>allow</b> <b>more</b> services to run at shorter intervals. A new timetable with extra services was introduced on 10 October 2010.|$|E

50|$|The {{relatively}} slow metabolism of acetonitrile to {{hydrogen cyanide}} <b>allows</b> <b>more</b> of the cyanide produced to be detoxified {{within the body}} to thiocyanate (the rhodanese pathway). It also <b>allows</b> <b>more</b> of the acetonitrile to be excreted unchanged before it is metabolised. The main pathways of excretion are by exhalation and in the urine.|$|R

5|$|The {{journey was}} rich in {{scientific}} results. However, {{the relationship between}} the Forsters and Cook and his officers was often problematic, due to the elder Forster's fractious temperament as well as Cook's refusal to <b>allow</b> <b>more</b> time for botanical and other scientific observation. Cook refused scientists on his third journey after his experiences with the Forsters.|$|E
5|$|The probe was {{originally}} scheduled for launch on December 30, 2004, but NASA officials delayed its launch, {{in order to}} <b>allow</b> <b>more</b> time for testing the software.

50|$|The E3 2009 {{aimed to}} return E3 to its 'pre-E3 2007' state, by reopening it {{to a larger}} {{audience}} <b>allowing</b> <b>more</b> attendees. As well as having a larger venue and <b>allowing</b> <b>more</b> exhibitors, E3 2009 also reverted its name to Electronic Entertainment Expo. However, like pre-2007, the event was still not open to the general public.|$|R
5|$|Between 1930 and 1935 the {{through station}} was {{expanded}} {{under the direction}} of the GWR's chief architect P E Culverhouse, in art deco style, both eastwards over the old cattle market and southwards on a new wider bridge across Cattle Market Road and the New Cut of the River Avon. This made room for the addition of five through-platform faces, while the removal of the narrow island platforms in the middle of the train shed allowed the main Up and Down platforms to be both widened and lengthened. All the routes approaching Temple Meads were widened to four tracks to <b>allow</b> <b>more</b> flexibility.|$|E
5|$|During the 2009 session, Roberts {{sponsored}} several bills {{relating to}} juvenile criminal offenders, including legislation to <b>allow</b> <b>more</b> juveniles {{to have their}} criminal records expunged, and to allow young adults to serve sentences within the Youth Offender System instead of correctional facilities. Roberts also sponsored legislation to make minor adjustment to the statutes concerning the Colorado Youth Advisory Council, legislation to create a regional self-insurance plan within the San Luis Valley, and legislation revising statutes surrounding end-of-life care.|$|E
5|$|In April 2013, Disney {{announced}} the sequel Finding Dory, confirming that DeGeneres and Brooks would be reprising {{their roles as}} Dory and Marlin, respectively. It {{was scheduled to be}} released on November 25, 2015, but the film's ending was revised after Pixar executives viewed Blackfish. On September 18, 2013, it was announced that the film would be pushed back to a UK July 29, 2016 release. Pixar's The Good Dinosaur was moved to the November 25, 2015 slot to <b>allow</b> <b>more</b> time for production of the film.|$|E

5|$|In {{computer}} science, 2-satisfiability, 2-SAT or just 2SAT is a computational {{problem of}} assigning values to variables, {{each of which}} has two possible values, in order to satisfy a system of constraints on pairs of variables. It is a special case of the general Boolean satisfiability problem, which can involve constraints on more than two variables, and of constraint satisfaction problems, which can <b>allow</b> <b>more</b> than two choices for the value of each variable. But in contrast to those more general problems, which are NP-complete, 2-satisfiability can be solved in polynomial time.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} be able to move troops to the front in New Guinea more rapidly, to acclimatise them during the process, and to <b>allow</b> <b>more</b> {{realistic}} training of large formations in jungle and mountainous but malaria-free terrain, Blamey decided to establish a training and staging area on the Atherton Tableland in November 1942. Eventually, accommodation was provided there for 70,000 troops. As divisions returned from tours of duty in New Guinea in 1943 and 1944, they were sent to Atherton for anti-malaria treatment. The men then went on leave, after which they returned to Atherton where training was conducted before staging and departing again.|$|E
5|$|In {{the post-war}} years, archaeological {{interest}} in the castle grew. From 1951 onwards the Ministry of Works carried out a long-running research project into the Device Forts, the section on Camber being written by the historian Martin Biddle and finally published in 1982. Biddle carried out an exploratory archaeological survey of the site in 1962 and the following year the ruins were closed to <b>allow</b> <b>more</b> extensive archaeological excavation by the Ministry. These were initially carried out by Biddle and Alan Cook, with support from local school children and from young offenders from the Borstal institution in Dover.|$|E

5|$|Once food {{leaves the}} crop, it passes to the midgut (element 13 in {{numbered}} diagram), {{also known as}} the mesenteron, where the majority of digestion takes place. Microscopic projections from the midgut wall, called microvilli, increase the surface area of the wall and <b>allow</b> <b>more</b> nutrients to be absorbed; they tend to be close to the origin of the midgut. In some insects, the role of the microvilli and where they are located may vary. For example, specialized microvilli producing digestive enzymes may more likely be {{near the end of the}} midgut, and absorption near the origin or beginning of the midgut.|$|E
5|$|Several enzymes {{can work}} {{together}} in a specific order, creating metabolic pathways. In a metabolic pathway, one enzyme takes the product of another enzyme as a substrate. After the catalytic reaction, the product is then passed on to another enzyme. Sometimes more than one enzyme can catalyze the same reaction in parallel; this can <b>allow</b> <b>more</b> complex regulation: with, for example, a low constant activity provided by one enzyme but an inducible high activity from a second enzyme.|$|E
