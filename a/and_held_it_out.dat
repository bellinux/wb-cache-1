500|$|U2 {{found that}} they were neither {{prepared}} nor well-rehearsed, and that their ideas were not evolving into completed songs. The group were unable to reach consensus during their disagreements and {{felt that they were}} not making progress. Bono and Lanois, in particular, had an argument that almost came to blows during the writing of [...] "Mysterious Ways". During one tense session, Clayton removed his bass guitar <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> to Bono, saying, [...] "You tell me what to play and I'll play it. You want to play it yourself? Go ahead." [...] With a sense of going nowhere, the band considered breaking up. Eno visited for a few days, and understanding their attempts to deconstruct the band, he assured them that their progress was better than they thought. By adding unusual effects and sounds, he showed that the Edge's pursuit for new sonic territory was not incompatible with Mullen's and Lanois' [...] "desire to hold on to solid song structures". Ultimately, a breakthrough was achieved with the writing of the song [...] "One". While working on [...] "Sick Puppy"—an early version of [...] "Mysterious Ways"—The Edge played two separate chord progressions sequentially on guitar at Lanois' encouragement, and finding inspiration, the group quickly improvised a new song that became [...] "One". It provided reassurance and validated their long-standing [...] "blank page approach" [...] to writing and recording together.|$|E
60|$|Anne {{lifted the}} letter <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> calmly {{dramatic}} in a moment.|$|E
60|$|She drew a {{very small}} white hand from a very large leather mitten, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Isabel," [...] he said, [...] "I {{have brought}} {{with me that}} letter which you wrote to me. Will you take it back again?" [...] <b>And</b> he <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> in his hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "All ceremony," [...] he said, [...] "consists in the {{reversal}} of the obvious. Thus men, when they wish to be priests or judges, dress up like women. Kindly help me on with this coat." [...] <b>And</b> he <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "No; it is I who am foolish {{about my}} burnt hands," [...] {{answered}} Abby, in her frank, impetuous way. [...] "See how ugly it is!" [...] <b>And</b> she <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> {{as if to}} punish herself for the girlish feeling she despised.|$|R
60|$|A flicker passed {{across the}} vagrant's face; {{he drew the}} letter from his pocket <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E
60|$|Colonel Zane took a long, {{feathered}} arrow {{from where}} it lay on a bench, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> to Jonathan.|$|E
60|$|Eagerly {{watched by}} Mrs. Inchbare, she wrote {{an order to}} the poultry-woman, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> with a gracious smile.|$|E
60|$|He bent unsteadily over Quest. Suddenly {{the latter}} sprang up, seized {{him by the}} leg and sent him sprawling. The gun fell from his hand. Quest picked <b>it</b> up <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> firmly <b>out,</b> {{covering}} both men. Gallagher was on his knees, groping for his own weapon.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hold {{out your}} hand, dear," [...] he said, <b>and</b> when she <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> {{he placed the}} ring on her finger. Then he took her in his arms.|$|R
6000|$|... "Telegram," [...] was the laconic answer, <b>and</b> the lad <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> [...] "Sign here," [...] he added, {{bringing}} his receipt book into evidence. [...] "It's paid fer." ...|$|R
60|$|He drew a {{paper from}} his pocket book, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> It was the return half of a steamer ticket.|$|E
60|$|She {{slipped his}} ring from her finger <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> to him. He took it mechanically. He still felt dazed and unreal.|$|E
60|$|With that he doffed his hat, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> as a begging-box, a brazen grin at {{the same}} time {{crossing}} his countenance.|$|E
6000|$|... "See," [...] he said, [...] "how inscrutable are the Divine ways, and how truth must {{in the end}} prevail. Your innocence is established, after all, {{since the}} Holy Father himself has seen cause to {{intervene}} to save you. You are at liberty. You are free to depart and to go wheresoever you will. This bull concerns you." [...] <b>And</b> he <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> to me.|$|R
60|$|He {{had already}} stooped {{and picked up}} Stoutenburg's sword, and now was holding it with slender finger tips by the point of its blade, and smiling, urbane <b>and</b> mocking, he <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> at arm's length, bowing the while with courtly, ironical grace.|$|R
60|$|Glenn led {{her along}} {{the base of}} the wall to three other pens, in each of which was a fat old sow with a litter. And at the last enclosure, that owing to dry soil was not so dirty, Glenn picked up a little pig <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> {{squealing}} <b>out</b> to Carley as she leaned over the fence. It was fairly white and clean, a little pink and fuzzy, and certainly cute with its curled tall.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where's the fiddle?" [...] demanded Tobey, and Tim {{unhooked}} a calico {{bag from}} the saddlebow <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> A laugh greeted the gesture.|$|E
6000|$|Hester Dethridge came out, {{closing the}} door behind her. She looked attentively at Anne--then wrote on her slate, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out,</b> with these words on it: ...|$|E
60|$|He reeled {{a little}} in his chair. Wingate poured some brandy from his flask into the little metal cup <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out.</b> Phipps drank it greedily.|$|E
6000|$|... "He said, 'I'll pay {{you five}} pounds a week if I {{can have it}} on my own terms.' I'm a poor woman, sir, and Mr. Warren earns little, and the money meant much to me. He took out a ten-pound note, <b>and</b> he <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> to me then and there. 'You can have the same every {{fortnight}} {{for a long time to}} come if you keep the terms,' he said. 'If not, I'll have no more to do with you.' ...|$|R
60|$|Up to {{this point}} {{business}} had continued in the most promising manner, <b>and</b> if <b>it</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> as well {{there would be no}} difficulty in his paying all the money he owed, even although there might be no very large profit.|$|R
60|$|She {{broke off}} abruptly, {{and tried to}} read the other woman's face in the gloom. But Marguerite, who was taller than the Frenchwoman, was standing, very stiff and erect, giving the young actress neither discouragement nor confidence. She did not {{interrupt}} Candeille's long and voluble explanation: vaguely she wondered {{what it was all}} about, and even now when the Frenchwoman paused, Marguerite said nothing, but watched her quietly as she took a folded paper from the capacious pocked of her cloak <b>and</b> then <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> with a look of timidity towards Lady Blakeney.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was nothing--nothing," [...] stammered Jasper. His {{book had}} fallen {{on the ground at}} her feet, and she picked it up <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> to him.|$|E
60|$|He had {{tossed his}} purse upon the table. As {{he fell into}} this dim cogitation with himself, the student took it up, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> to him.|$|E
6000|$|I {{struck a}} match, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> to him, shaded by my hands. As the faint light illumined his face, I started back, {{and let the}} match fall:-- ...|$|E
60|$|The Vicomtesse {{closed the}} door, {{and without a}} glance at him went quickly {{to the table and}} began to write. She had no thought of {{consulting}} the man again, of asking his permission. Although she wrote rapidly, five minutes must have gone by before the note was finished and folded <b>and</b> sealed. She <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> to him.|$|R
50|$|On 25 August 1918 at Martinpuich, France, {{during a}} strong {{counter-attack}} Sergeant Colley's company was holding an advanced position with two platoons {{in advance and}} two in support. The forward platoons were ordered to hold on at all costs and Sergeant Colley went, without orders, to help these two platoons. He rallied the men, then formed a defensive flank <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it,</b> although <b>out</b> of the two platoons only three men remained unwounded and the sergeant himself was dangerously wounded and died the same day. It was entirely due to his action that the enemy was prevented from breaking through.|$|R
60|$|And his mount! How can earthly words {{describe}} it! It towered {{ten feet}} at the shoulder; had four legs on either side; a broad flat tail, larger at the tip than at the root, <b>and</b> which <b>it</b> <b>held</b> straight <b>out</b> behind while running; a gaping mouth which split its head from its snout to its long, massive neck.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Flint {{went to the}} lamp, {{unrolled}} {{the ball}} of telegrams, seized one and crossed the room quickly, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> to her. His hand shook a little.|$|E
6000|$|Sherikov {{reached into}} a drawer {{of the table}} before him. He {{carefully}} brought out a small square box <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> to Cole. [...] "You wired this, didn't you?" ...|$|E
60|$|Aquilar {{took out}} a cross from under his doublet, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> towards Roger, who, after looking {{at it for a}} moment, fell on his knees and kissed it.|$|E
60|$|Jethro {{rose and}} opened the rawhide trunk and handed the little {{rosewood}} box to his friend. Wetherell took it and lifted the lid reverently, with that same {{smile on his face}} and far-off look in his eyes, and drew out a small daguerreotype in a faded velvet frame. He gazed at the picture a long time, <b>and</b> then he <b>held</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> to Jethro; <b>and</b> Jethro looked at it, and his hand trembled.|$|R
6000|$|... "See, ladies," [...] and {{he turned}} to Jane, [...] "there is the chain you gave me. I have worn it, always, on my wrist. I and my squire were beaten down by, your father's followers; my squire grievously wounded and insensible, while I had been left for dead, though but stunned from a blow. I luckily {{recovered}} my senses, just as those employed in despatching the wounded came up; and, happily remembering your bracelet, I took <b>it</b> off <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>it</b> up, calling <b>out</b> your father's name.|$|R
5000|$|The {{revolution}} and downfall of the Hashemite dynasty in Iraq {{would not be}} the end of relations between Iraq and Jordan. In 1975 Jordan turned away from their economic relationship with Syria and instead looked to Iraq. Iraq offered Jordan a strong economy, oil money, a large market and strategic depth. With Iraq's financial aid, Jordan made some economic gains. In fact, by 1990 Iraq was [...] "Jordan's largest market, it was repaying trade credit debts in oil, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>held</b> <b>out</b> the hope of lucrative reconstruction contracts after the Iran-Iraq War." ...|$|R
