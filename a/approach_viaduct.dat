25|$|Seven years passed; {{pieces of}} the bridge's eastern <b>approach</b> <b>viaduct</b> over Poughkeepsie began falling onto U.S. Route 9 below, {{damaging}} passing vehicles. In response, the city sued Conrail and forced it to spend $300,000 in 1983 to remove the decking over the superstructure. Conrail then sought {{to dispose of the}} unused bridge and eventually abandoned and tore up its Maybrook Line between Hopewell Junction and Maybrook, New York in 1983–1984.|$|E
25|$|In 1951, {{twenty years}} after the bridge opened, the New Jersey tollbooth was re-landscaped by the Port Authority and the City of Bayonne, and in 1956, some land under the New Jersey <b>approach</b> <b>viaduct</b> was set aside to create the Juliette Street Playground. The Bergen Point Ferry, which paralleled the bridge, stayed in service until 1961. A new toll plaza in Staten Island was created in 1964 and made into one-way {{operation}} in 1970, with tolls only being collected for vehicles entering the island.|$|E

50|$|The {{approaches}} {{were built}} under separate contract and {{were to the}} design of the engineer James Carswell. The supports of the <b>approach</b> <b>viaducts</b> are tapered to prevent the impression of the columns widening as they approach the top, and an evaluation of the aesthetics of the Bridge in 2007, by A D Magee of the University of Bath, identified that order was present throughout, and this included in the <b>approach</b> <b>viaducts.</b> Magee points out that the masonry was carefully planned, and has neat block work even in areas not immediately visible from the ground.|$|R
25|$|The {{crossing}} {{passes over}} mudflats in the Severn Estuary {{with part of}} the eastern <b>approach</b> <b>viaduct</b> sited on the English Stones, a rocky outcrop uncovered at low tide. The estuary wetlands are home to migrating birds such as the ringed plover, redshank and whimbrel, while the Eurasian curlew, dunlin and grey plover winter in the area. The birds feed on ragworm, lugworm and other invertebrates. Saltmarsh is found along {{the fringes of the}} coast. Beds of eelgrass occur on the more sheltered mud- and sandbanks. In 1976, in recognition {{of the importance of the}} estuary as a wetland used by migrating birds, an area of 247 km2 (95 sq miles) was designated a Ramsar site. In 1988 the Severn Estuary was designated a Special Protection Area. The same year an area of 99 km2 (38 sq miles) was notified as a SSSI and designated as such the following year; in 1995, this was extended to cover the whole of the Ramsar site.|$|E

50|$|The <b>approach</b> <b>viaducts</b> on {{each side}} of the bridge both {{comprise}} three masonry arches. The height limit for vehicles using the bridge is 4.2 m, and taller vehicles have caused damage to the bridge.|$|R
2500|$|The final {{designs of}} the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, once finalized, were a sharp and drastic {{contrast}} from the design by Leon Moisseiff. Instead of a thin plate girder, an open-air stiffening truss with {{a depth of}} [...] would form the new road deck. Newer, larger towers that rose [...] higher and [...] wider than Gertie's towers, would support the bridge's main cables, now [...] in diameter versus Gertie's [...] Newer, larger anchor blocks would support a load that weighed 1.6 {{times as much as}} the original bridge. However, some elements of Galloping Gertie were incorporated into the 1950 span. The tower pedestals were enlarged and raised [...] On the west end stood a [...] long <b>approach</b> <b>viaduct</b> with the same [...] deep girders Gertie's main deck had. This <b>approach</b> <b>viaduct</b> used three support towers, two with thin support beams and one with the structural complexity and design of one of Gertie's main towers - each spaced [...] apart. The viaduct, after a structural examination, was kept and utilized as part of the 1950 bridge's design, with an additional box strut brace added to the tower closest the shoreline (officially known as Tower #3 in the design plans), and widening of the upper box strut for the new bridge's deck.|$|E
2500|$|In 1937, {{the islands}} were {{connected}} by a bridge over Little Hell Gate, obviating {{the need for a}} ferry to Wards Island. In fact, there were two bridges that appear to have been known as Little Hell Gate Bridge– an early 20th-century rail bridge on the approach to Hell Gate Bridge, and a later, lower steel arch road bridge across Little Hell Gate. The northern <b>approach</b> <b>viaduct</b> to the Hell Gate Bridge included an inverted bowstring truss bridge, with four [...] long spans, across Little Hell Gate. Although the majority of Little Hell Gate has been filled in, this bridge still exists. Some time after the rail bridge was built, a [...] long, 3 span, steel arch road bridge, designed by George Washington Bridge-engineer Othmar Ammann, was also built across Little Hell Gate, just a short distance to the north west of the rail bridge.|$|E

It was won by Quille, a subsidiary of Bouygues, {{in association with the}} Eiffel company, Eiffage and the Belgian firm Victor Buyck. The total cost of construction, including the approaches, was €137 million. The déclaration d'utilité publique passed in September 2001.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>approach</b> <b>viaduct,</b> {{originally}} {{constructed in}} timber and comprising 32 spans, was rebuilt in brick in 1909-1910 by Alexander Ross. The brick viaduct comprises 28 spans, eighteen are 24 ft 11 ins, and ten are 25 ft 7 ins.|$|E

50|$|The {{number of}} {{bearings}} has been minimized, particularly on the <b>approach</b> <b>viaduct,</b> {{through the use of}} continuous construction.

50|$|After many deliberations, {{taking into}} account aesthetics, economy, and {{availability}} of local expertise and construction materials, the Chenab Bridge {{was designed as a}} large span single arch steel bridge with <b>approach</b> <b>viaducts</b> on either side. The arch is two-ribbed, fabricated from large steel trusses.

It will have H-shape towers 120 m high, cast in situ concrete girder superstructure with a double-plane of cables in a semi-fan type configuration. It will have six lanes for traffic.|$|R
