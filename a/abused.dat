40|$|Background <b>Abuse</b> {{of women}} occurs in every {{society of the}} world. Increased {{information}} about the prevalence in industrialized countries, like Norway, is required to make strategies to prevent <b>abuse.</b> Our aim {{was to investigate the}} prevalence of self-reported sexual, physical and emotional <b>abuse</b> in a large obstetric population in Norway, and the associations between exposure to adult <b>abuse,</b> socio-demographics and other characteristics. Methods Our study is based on the Norwegian Mother and Child (MoBa) Cohort study, conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. The current study included 65, 393 women who responded to two extensive postal questionnaires during pregnancy. Any adult <b>abuse</b> is defined as being exposed to one or more types of adult <b>abuse,</b> any child <b>abuse</b> is defined as being exposed to one or more types of child <b>abuse,</b> and any lifetime <b>abuse</b> is defined as being exposed to <b>abuse</b> either as a child and/or as an adult. Perpetrators were categorized as known or stranger. Results Overall, 32 % of the women reported any lifetime <b>abuse,</b> 20 % reported any adult <b>abuse,</b> 19 % reported any child <b>abuse</b> and 6 % reported <b>abuse</b> both as adults and as children. Emotional <b>abuse</b> was the most frequently reported type of <b>abuse</b> both as adults (16 %) and children (14 %). Adult sexual <b>abuse</b> was reported by 5 % and child sexual <b>abuse</b> by 7 %. Physical <b>abuse</b> was reported by 6 % as adults and by 6 % as children. Approximately 30 % of those reporting adult or child <b>abuse</b> reported exposure to two or three types of <b>abuse.</b> Five percent of the women reported exposure to any <b>abuse</b> during the last 12 [*]months. For all types of <b>abuse,</b> a known perpetrator was more commonly reported. Logistic regression showed that being exposed to child <b>abuse,</b> smoking and drinking alcohol in the first trimester of pregnancy, living alone, and belonging to the eldest age group were significantly associated with being exposed to any adult <b>abuse.</b> Conclusion The reported prevalence of any lifetime <b>abuse</b> was substantial in our low-risk pregnant population.

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} by some {{within the field of}} attachment therapy that RAD may be quite prevalent because severe child maltreatment, which is known to increase risk for RAD, is prevalent and because children who are severely <b>abused</b> may exhibit behaviors similar to RAD behaviors. The APSAC Taskforce consider this inference to be flawed and questionable. Severely <b>abused</b> children may exhibit similar behaviors to RAD behaviors but there are several far more common and demonstrably treatable diagnoses which may better account for these difficulties. Further, many children experience severe maltreatment and do not develop clinical disorders. Resilience is a common and normal human characteristic. RAD does not underlie all or even most of the behavioral and emotional problems seen in foster children, adoptive children, or children who are maltreated and rates of child abuse and/or neglect or problem behaviors are not a benchmark for estimates of RAD.|$|E

40|$|<b>Abuse</b> {{in adult}} {{relationships}} as affected by stress, anxiety-proneness, {{and exposure to}} <b>abuse</b> as a child was examined using 579 North Texas State University undergraduates, Frequency and levels of <b>abuse</b> observed or received {{as a child and}} received or expressed as an adult were measured using a modification of Straus' Conflicts Tactics Scale (1979). Anxiety-proneness was determined by scores received on Spielberger's (1970) State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Current levels of stress {{for the past two years}} were measured using the Life Experiences Survey (Sarason, 1978). Overall frequencies for received and expressed <b>abuse</b> (including physical and verbal <b>abuse)</b> in adult relationships were quite high (62. 9 percent and 73. 8 percent respectively). Females reported expressing significantly more <b>abuse</b> than did males. No gender differences were found for the receipt of <b>abuse.</b> Gender differences in types of violence were also examined. In addition, multiple regression was used to determine predictor variables for the expression and receipt of <b>abuse.</b> For males, receiving <b>abuse</b> as a child, positive stress scores, higher levels of anxiety-proneness, and observing father's <b>abuse</b> of mother significantly predicted expressing <b>abuse</b> as an adult. Observing mother's <b>abuse</b> of father and positive stress scores significantly predicted receiving <b>abuse</b> as an adult. For females, having received <b>abuse</b> as a child and trait anxiety were significant predictors for the expression of adult <b>abuse.</b> Receiving <b>abuse</b> as a child was the only significant predictor for the receipt of adult <b>abuse.</b> The greater impact of observing <b>abuse</b> between parents on males was discussed. In addition, difficulties confronting researchers in this area and the possible explanations for more frequent reports of female expression of <b>abuse</b> were examined...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of child <b>abuse</b> among {{high school students in}} Curacao. Methods: A questionnaire survey among high school students up to 17 years of age was conducted. The questionnaire was based on existing literature and validated questionnaires. The questionnaire used was analysed and adapted to the situation in Curacao by a panel of experts on child <b>abuse.</b> The primary objective was to gain insight into the incidence, prevalence and various forms of child <b>abuse</b> among students in Curacao. Five forms of child <b>abuse</b> are distinguished in the literature: physical <b>abuse,</b> emotional <b>abuse,</b> sexual <b>abuse,</b> neglect and exploitation. Furthermore, the degree of confidence of the students in general practitioners (GPs) as care providers in the field of child <b>abuse</b> was explored. Results: Questionnaires from 545 of the 628 respondents were included. In total, 43 % of the respondents had ever-experienced an event which could be defined as (a form of) child <b>abuse.</b> More than one-third of the respondents reporting child <b>abuse</b> ever had an experience that could be interpreted as physical <b>abuse.</b> More than 15 % of the respondents reporting child <b>abuse</b> had experienced sexual <b>abuse.</b> Girls experienced significantly more sexual <b>abuse</b> than boys. Emotional <b>abuse</b> in the last year was experienced by 3 % of the respondents. One per cent of the respondents ever-experienced neglect. According to most respondents, GPs were not seen as care providers in cases of child abuse; they believed that GPs were mainly to be consulted for illnesses or physical symptoms and not for forms of child <b>abuse.</b> Conclusion: The prevalence of ever-having-experienced a form of child <b>abuse</b> is estimated at 431 per 1000 students. Child <b>abuse,</b> particularly physical <b>abuse,</b> is common in Curacao, and is probably comparable to other surrounding countries. General practitioners were not seen as care providers in identifying and reporting cases of child <b>abuse</b> according to most respondents...|$|R

Generation three (G 3) consisted of adult children (82 males and 98 females) while generation two (G 2) consisted of their parents (89 males and 161 females). Both groups served as the pivotal reporters responding to questionnaires regarding parental spouse <b>abuse</b> and child <b>abuse,</b> G 2 child <b>abuse,</b> <b>abuse</b> in their own intimate relationships, attachment, and social support. Regression analyses were conducted to assess the extent to which: child and spouse <b>abuse</b> in generation one (G 1) would predict partner <b>abuse</b> in G 3 and whether the inclusion of G 3 attachment and social support would add to this prediction; child and spouse <b>abuse</b> in G 1 would predict child and spouse <b>abuse</b> in G 2 and whether G 2 attachment and social support when included would contribute to this prediction; child and spouse <b>abuse</b> in G 2 would predict partner <b>abuse</b> in G 3 and whether G 2 and G 3 attachment and social support would add to the prediction; child and spouse <b>abuse</b> in G 1 and G 2 would predict partner <b>abuse</b> in G 3 and whether the inclusion of G 2 and G 3 attachment and social support would add to this prediction. For G 2 women, ability to feel comfortable with closeness and maternal child <b>abuse</b> predicted spouse <b>abuse</b> in their own intimate relationships. Additionally, G 2 women 2 ̆ 7 s anxiety about being abandoned and their ability to depend on others predicted <b>abuse</b> in their children 2 ̆ 7 s intimate relationships. Furthermore, the extent to which G 2 women felt they could depend on others solely predicted <b>abuse</b> in their offspring 2 ̆ 7 s intimate relationships when G 1 and G 2 variables were considered together. However, only paternal and maternal child <b>abuse</b> predicted child <b>abuse</b> for G 2 women. For G 2 men, paternal child <b>abuse</b> and parental spouse <b>abuse</b> predicted child <b>abuse</b> while parental spouse <b>abuse</b> predicted <b>abuse</b> in their own intimate relationships.
