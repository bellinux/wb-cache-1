5|$|Clumber Spaniels shed at {{a medium}} pace. Clumbers tend to drool {{because of their}} very droopy flews. Clumbers have minds of their own. Puppies <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> curious and playful. The breed has a trophy mentality and the dog has an incessant need to carry {{something}} most of the time; unfortunately {{this can lead to}} health issues as they may ingest the items.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are taken}} {{by a number of}} mammals, {{including}} American mink, striped skunk, otters, foxes and racoons, with the latter being responsible for nearly 40% of all nest failures. Birds such as herring gulls, northern ravens and American crows will eat unattended eggs. Because their nests are at the water's edge, common loon eggs <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> vulnerable if the adult is absent.|$|E
50|$|Deforestation {{resulting}} from logging <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> rampant in Olancho Department. The clearing {{of land for}} agriculture <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> prevalent in the largely undeveloped La Mosquitia region, causing land degradation and soil erosion.|$|R
50|$|Two of {{the most}} {{important}} RNA molecules are HA and PB1. HA creates a surface antigen that <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> important in transmissibility. PB1 creates a viral polymerase molecule that <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> important in virulence.|$|R

5|$|Goat Rocks {{obtained}} {{its name}} from a population of mountain goats that can be observed around the mountain. Other fauna include marmots and pikas at high elevations. Deer and elk can be found below the timberline, including mule deer, mule deer-black-tailed hybrids, Roosevelt elk, and Rocky Mountain elk that were introduced from Yellowstone National Park in 1913. Black-tailed deer <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> common.|$|E
5|$|It is the {{combination}} of warm humid air from the Gulf and dry air from the deserts of the Southwest that produce deadly storms. These conditions create an unstable severe storm creating arena. Although tornadoes occur on every continent except Antarctica they <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> common in North America, specifically the United States.|$|E
5|$|It {{is widely}} used for herbal remedies, with {{well-established}} emollient and astringent properties. Mullein remedies <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> recommended for coughs and related problems, but also used in topical applications against a variety of skin problems. The plant has also been used to make dyes and torches.|$|E
25|$|The term <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> applied {{historically}} to Spanish Jews who—outwardly—professed Catholicism, {{who were}} also known as Anusim or Marranos. The phenomenon <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> associated with renaissance Spain, following the June 6, 1391, Anti-Jewish pogroms and the expulsion of the Jews in 1492.|$|R

5|$|Linear {{combinations}} combine multiplication and summation; {{they are}} sums {{in which each}} term has a multiplier, usually a real or complex number. Linear combinations <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> useful in contexts where straightforward addition would violate some normalization rule, such as mixing of strategies in game theory or superposition of states in quantum mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Most tornadoes {{take on the}} {{appearance}} of a narrow funnel, a few hundred yards (meters) across, with a small cloud of debris near the ground. Tornadoes may be obscured completely by rain or dust. These tornadoes <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> dangerous, as even experienced meteorologists might not see them. Tornadoes can appear in many shapes and sizes.|$|E

50|$|Because of South America's ethnic mix, South American cuisine {{takes on}} African, American Indian, and European {{influences}}. Bahia, Brazil, <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> {{well known for}} its West African-influenced cuisine. Perú <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> well known for its ethnic mix influences like African, American Indian, European, Chinese, Japanese, and others.|$|R

5|$|Paints {{containing}} {{zinc oxide}} powder {{have long been}} utilized as anticorrosive coatings for metals. They <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> effective for galvanized iron. Iron is difficult to protect because its reactivity with organic coatings leads to brittleness and lack of adhesion. Zinc oxide paints retain their flexibility and adherence on such surfaces for many years.|$|E
5|$|Rumination {{syndrome}} {{in adults}} {{is a complicated}} disorder whose symptoms can mimic those of several other gastroesophogeal disorders and diseases. Bulimia nervosa and gastroparesis <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> prevalent among the misdiagnoses of rumination.|$|E
5|$|Sebrights {{are neither}} {{prolific}} egg layers, nor outstanding meat birds. They can {{prove to be}} particularly difficult to raise, especially for beginners. Hens rarely go broody and chicks usually have high mortality rates. Adults are generally hardy birds, but <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> susceptible to Marek's disease.|$|E

5|$|Shingouz {{have a high}} alcohol {{tolerance}} and preference for strong alcoholic beverages, which they consume in large quantities. The Shingouz society is capitalist to the extreme. Shingouz want a profit from everything they do. They <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> adept in trading important and sensitive information to interested parties. Valérian and Laureline have struck up {{a relationship with a}} group of three Shingouz who have a particularly useful network of contacts in all the major space communities. They <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> fond of Laureline, which she often uses to her advantage in striking favourable deals with them.|$|E
5|$|The golden swallow is {{victim to}} various {{mammalian}} nest predators, including the introduced Indian mongoose, feral cats, and multiple species of rats. These predators {{are thought to}} be linked to the extinction of the nominate subspecies. Nests on or near the ground in mines <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|The loggerhead {{sea turtle}} is omnivorous, feeding mainly on bottom-dwelling invertebrates. Its large and {{powerful}} jaws serve as an effective tool for dismantling its prey. Young loggerheads are exploited by numerous predators; the eggs <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> vulnerable to terrestrial organisms. Once the turtles reach adulthood, their formidable size limits predation to large marine animals, such as sharks.|$|E

25|$|However, {{systematic}} sampling <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> vulnerable to periodicities in the list. If periodicity is {{present and the}} period is a multiple or factor of the interval used, the sample <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> likely to <b>be</b> unrepresentative of the overall population, making the scheme less accurate than simple random sampling.|$|R
50|$|Dwadashi <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> {{suitable}} for the worship of the sacred Tulasi tree (Tulasi stava of srishti khanda of Padma Purana), much like Ekadashi <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> {{suitable for}} the worship of Vishnu.The saint poet Annamacharya died on Phalguna Bahula Dwadasi (12th day after full moon) in the year Dhundhubhi.|$|R
5|$|There are {{advanced}} protection patches, such as Suhosin and Hardening-Patch, that <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> {{designed for}} web hosting environments, {{primarily due to}} these environments being seen as places where carelessly written code may run.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors are {{involved}} in suppression of inflammation by erythromycin and other macrolides. They <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> effective at inhibiting the proliferation of neutrophils, by diminishing the ability of interleukin 8 and leukotriene B4 to attract them. Macrolides also reduce the efficiency of adhesion molecules that allow neutrophils to stick to bronchiolar tissue linings. Mucus production in the airways is a major culprit in the morbidity and mortality of DPB and other respiratory diseases. The significant reduction of inflammation in DPB attributed to erythromycin therapy also helps to inhibit the production of excess mucus.|$|E
5|$|All tiger sharks {{generally}} swim slowly, which, {{combined with}} cryptic coloration, may make them difficult for prey to detect in some habitats. They <b>are</b> <b>especially</b> well camouflaged against dark backgrounds. Despite their sluggish appearance, tiger sharks {{are one of}} the strongest swimmers of the carcharhinid sharks. Once the shark has come close, a speed burst allows it to reach the intended prey before it can escape.|$|E
50|$|However, {{systematic}} sampling <b>is</b> <b>especially</b> vulnerable to periodicities in the list.
