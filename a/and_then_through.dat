5|$|Heated-{{manifold}} direct-injection die casting, {{also known}} as direct-injection die casting or runnerless die casting, is a zinc die casting process where molten zinc is forced through a heated manifold <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>through</b> heated mini-nozzles, which lead into the molding cavity. This process has the advantages of lower cost per part, through the reduction of scrap (by the elimination of sprues, gates and runners) and energy conservation, and better surface quality through slower cooling cycles.|$|E

5|$|Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy (stylized as Goodbye, Galaxy!) is {{a two-part}} episodic side-scrolling {{platform}} video game developed by id Software {{and published by}} Apogee Software in 1991 for MS-DOS. It consists of the fifth and sixth episodes of the Commander Keen series, though they are numbered as the fourth and fifth, as Commander Keen in Keen Dreams is outside of the main continuity. The game follows the titular Commander Keen, an eight-year-old child genius, as he first journeys through the Shadowlands to rescue the Gnosticenes so they may ask the Oracle how the Shikadi plan to destroy the galaxy, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>through</b> the Shikadi's Armageddon Machine to stop them. The two episodes feature Keen running, jumping, and shooting through various levels while opposed by aliens, robots, and other hazards.|$|E
5|$|Dolan {{brought in}} Paul Tomlinson, Brian Mitchell and Lee Sinnott {{in a bid}} to help McCall and Hendrie realise their dreams with City. They mounted a {{promotion}} challenge in 1987–88 and were top for much of the season until they faltered in the New Year. When promotion was missed initially by one point {{on the last day of}} the season after a 3–2 defeat against Ipswich Town <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>through</b> play-off defeat to Middlesbrough, McCall left the club, signing for Everton for £850,000 in June 1988. He had played 238 league games for the club, scoring 37 goals, and in total played 285 games, scoring 46 goals. McCall was later outspoken in his autobiography, The Real McCall, about City's failure to strengthen the side to secure promotion.|$|E

When they entered Nablus on 15 July, no resistance was put up, and shortly afterward, {{the rest of}} Jabal Nablus submitted to Muhammad Ali's troops. For the most part, due to the loyalty of the Abd al-Hadi's to Muhammad Ali, and the neutrality of the powerful Nimr clan, {{the inhabitants of the}} city of Nablus had not participated in the revolt. From Nablus, Ibrahim Pasha dispatched his troops north to occupy Jenin and Nazareth, before arriving in Jerusalem on 20 July with 30,000 new conscripts.|$|E
5|$|Offa's ancestry {{is given}} in the Anglian collection, a set of genealogies that include lines of descent for four Mercian kings. All four lines descend from Pybba, who ruled Mercia early in the 7th century. Offa's line descends through Pybba's son Eowa <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>through</b> three more generations: Osmod, Eanwulf and Offa's father, Thingfrith. Æthelbald, who ruled Mercia {{for most of the}} forty years before Offa, was also descended from Eowa {{according}} to the genealogies: Offa's grandfather, Eanwulf, was Æthelbald's first cousin. Æthelbald granted land to Eanwulf in the territory of the Hwicce, and it is possible that Offa and Æthelbald were from the same branch of the family. In one charter Offa refers to Æthelbald as his kinsman, and Headbert, Æthelbald's brother, continued to witness charters after Offa rose to power.|$|E
5|$|One of Edward's {{persistent}} challenges {{through most}} of his reign was a shortage of money; of the debts he inherited from his father, around £60,000 was still owing in the 1320s. The King {{worked his way through}} many treasurers and other financial officials, few of whom stayed long, raising revenues through often unpopular taxes, and requisitioning goods using his right of prise. He also took out many loans, first through the Frescobaldi family, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>through</b> his banker Antonio Pessagno. Edward took a strong interest in financial matters towards the end of his reign, distrusting his own officials and attempting to increase revenues directly by cutting back on the expenses of his own household.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} individual {{training at}} Ingleburn, the battalion moved on foot to Bathurst to complete collective training. Following this, the 2/17th embarked for the Middle East from Sydney on 20 October 1940, {{on board the}} Queen Mary. Moving in convoy the Queen Mary briefly stopped in Fremantle, before continuing to Bombay in early November where the battalion was disembarked. Following {{a few days in}} camp ashore they were transferred to the Rohna for the next leg of the voyage. The convoy continued, sailing via the African coast into the Gulf of Aden <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>through</b> the Suez Canal, before finally berthing at El Kantara in Egypt. The battalion was assigned to the 20th Brigade, along with the 2/13th and 2/15th Battalions, which were initially allocated to the 7th Division; however, following its arrival in the Middle East in November 1940, the battalion was transferred {{along with the rest of}} the brigade to the 9th Division.|$|E
5|$|After {{the capture}} of Lae, the Japanese high command {{determined}} that a withdrawal to {{a new line of}} defence was required. A total of about 9,000 Japanese troops subsequently began withdrawing across the Busu River <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>through</b> the Saruwaged and Finisterre Ranges to the north-east coast, while efforts were made to reinforce the Huon Peninsula, with the 20th Division being transferred from Madang to Finschhafen. The Allies, who had captured a copy of Nakano's withdrawal order when troops from the 2/25th Infantry Battalion clashed with a Japanese force on 13 September, attempted to cut off the withdrawing troops and subsequently there were heavy clashes along the Markham Valley Road, with troops from the Australian 25th Infantry Brigade and 503rd PIR engaged. During the withdrawal many Japanese troops ran short of food and abandoned essential equipment, including artillery, small arms and load carriage equipment; they subsequently reached their objective in the middle of October, having lost a further 600 to 1,000 men on the march. Japanese strength returns indicated that the 51st Division had 6,417 men, of whom 1,271 were sick. The 9th Division lost 77 killed, 397 wounded and 73 missing.|$|E

5|$|Chaplin {{was born}} in London and began acting on stage {{at the age of}} nine. In 1913, while on tour in the United States with Fred Karno's comedy group, he {{accepted}} a contract to work for Mack Sennett's Keystone film company. During his time at Keystone, he began writing and directing some of the films in which he starred. Chaplin signed with the Essanay Film Manufacturing Company in 1915, and the year after with the Mutual Film Corporation. In 1918, Chaplin began producing his own films, initially releasing them through First National <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>through</b> United Artists, a corporation he co-founded with Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, and D. W. Griffith. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, Chaplin was accused of being a Communist sympathiser, which he denied. He remained a British subject and, while travelling to England in 1952 to attend the premiere of his film Limelight, his American re-entry permit was rescinded. Chaplin eventually settled in Switzerland, where he remained {{for the rest of his}} life. He made his last two films in England.|$|E
5|$|The Basingstoke Canal {{started at}} a canal basin, roughly where the cinema in Festival Place is located. From there the canal ran {{alongside}} the River Loddon following {{the line of}} Eastrop Way. The old canal route passes under the perimeter ring road and then follows a long loop partly on an embankment to pass over small streams and water meadows towards Old Basing, where the route goes around the now ruined palace of Basing House <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>through</b> and around {{the eastern edge of}} Old Basing. It followed another loop to go over small streams near the Hatch public house (a lot of this section was built over when constructing the M3) and headed across fields on an embankment towards Mapledurwell. The section of the canal from Up Nately to the western entrance of the Greywell Tunnel still exists and is a nature reserve; there is water in the canal and the canal towpath can be walked. A permissive footpath at the western entrance to the tunnel allows walkers to access public footpaths to get to the eastern entrance of the tunnel. The limit of navigation is about 500m east of the Greywell Tunnel. The renovated sections of the canal can then be navigated east towards West Byfleet where it joins the Wey Navigation, which itself can be navigated to the River Thames at Weybridge.|$|E
5|$|When the Chola Empire {{began to}} decline in the 13th century, the Pandyas from the south invaded and {{captured}} Thanjavur twice, first during 1218–19 and then during 1230. During the second invasion, the Chola king Rajaraja III (1216–56) was exiled and he sought {{the help of the}} Hoysala king Vira Narasimha II (1220–35) to regain Thanjavur. Thanjavur was eventually annexed {{along with the rest of}} the Chola kingdom by the Pandya king Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I (1268–1308) in 1279 and the Chola kings were forced to accept the suzerainty of the Pandyas. The Pandyas ruled Thanjavur from 1279 to 1311 when their kingdom was raided and annexed by the forces of Malik Kafur (1296–1306) and Delhi Sultanate. The Sultanate extended its authority directly over the conquered regions from 1311 to 1335 <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>through</b> the semi-independent Ma'bar Sultanate from 1335 to 1378. Starting from the 1350s, the Ma'bar Sultanate was steadily absorbed into the rising Vijayanagar Empire.|$|E
