5|$|Scholars cannot {{tell from}} records whether {{the writers of}} the time, when using the term Tonto <b>Apache,</b> were {{referring}} to Yavapai or <b>Apache,</b> or those mixed bands. In addition, the Europeans often referred to the Wi:pukba and Guwevkabaya incorrectly as the Yavapai <b>Apache</b> or Yuma <b>Apache.</b> The Europeans referred to the Ɖo:lkabaya, the southwestern group of Yavapai, and the Hualapai (who belonged to the Upland Yuma Peoples), as Yuma <b>Apache</b> or Mohave <b>Apache.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} U.S. {{military}} operations in Iraq in December 2011, several <b>Apache</b> helicopters had been shot down by enemy fire, and others lost in accidents. In 2006, an <b>Apache</b> was downed by a Soviet-made Strela 2 (SA-7) in Iraq, despite the <b>Apache</b> being typically able to avoid such missiles. In 2007, four <b>Apache</b> helicopters were destroyed on the ground by insurgent mortar fire using web-published geotagged photographs taken by soldiers. Several AH-64s were lost to accidents in Afghanistan as of 2012. Most Apaches that took heavy damage were able to continue their missions and return safely.|$|E
5|$|From 2006 to April 2014, British <b>Apache</b> {{helicopters}} flew 50,000 {{hours in}} Afghanistan, representing {{one-third of all}} UK <b>Apache</b> flying.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, President Grant's Indian peace policy, {{enforced}} {{and coordinated}} by Brig. Gen. George Stoneman in Arizona, required the <b>Apache</b> {{to be put}} on reservations where they would receive supplies and agriculture education. The <b>Apache</b> slipped out and occasionally raided white settlers. In one raid, believed to have been conducted by <b>Apache</b> warriors, settlers and mail runners were murdered near Tuscan, Arizona. The townspeople traced this raid to <b>Apache</b> reservation from Camp Grant. 500 <b>Apache</b> lived at the Camp Grant near Dudleyville. Angered over the murders, the Tuscan townspeople hired 92 Papago Indians, 42 Mexicans, and 6 whites to take revenge on the <b>Apache.</b> When the war party reached Camp Grant on April 30, they murdered 144 Apaches, mostly women and children, in {{what became known as the}} Camp Grant Massacre. Twenty-seven captured <b>Apache</b> children were sold into Mexican slavery. In May, an attempt was made by a small federal military party to capture <b>Apache</b> leader Cochise; during the chase they killed 13 <b>Apache.</b> Grant immediately removed Stoneman of his command in Arizona.|$|E
5|$|In October 2008 it was {{announced}} that Prince Harry had begun the process of qualifying to become an <b>Apache</b> pilot. In May 2010, the terrorist organisation Al Qaeda threatened to abduct the prince if he piloted an <b>Apache</b> in Afghanistan. In April 2011, Prince Harry was promoted to captain following his completion of <b>Apache</b> conversion training. In June 2011, sections of the media reported that Prince Harry was to deploy to Afghanistan as an <b>Apache</b> pilot in 2012. He subsequently deployed to Afghanistan as part of 662 Squadron in September 2012.|$|E
5|$|Portions of the <b>Apache</b> are {{produced}} by various aerospace firms. AgustaWestland has produced number of components for the <b>Apache,</b> both for the international market and for the British Army's AgustaWestland <b>Apache.</b> Since 2004, Korea Aerospace Industries has been the sole manufacturer of the Apache's fuselage. Fuselage production had previously been performed by Teledyne Ryan Aeronautical; the transfer of fuselage production led to a prolonged legal dispute between Teledyne Ryan and Boeing.|$|E
5|$|SR 88 {{begins at}} a diamond {{interchange}} with US 60, the Superstition Freeway, in southern <b>Apache</b> Junction. The route follows Idaho Road northward through a residential area with four lanes. Following a junction with Old West Highway, SR 88 turns northeast onto <b>Apache</b> Trail and narrows to two lanes. The route exits {{the city limits}} of <b>Apache</b> Junction, entering desert terrain. Passing a ghost town known as Goldfield, <b>Apache</b> Trail enters Tonto National Forest just northwest of Lost Dutchman State Park. SR 88 nears Canyon Lake south of the Mormon Flat Dam and follows {{a part of the}} southern coast of Canyon Lake. <b>Apache</b> Trail heads away from the Salt River. It passes through the town of Tortilla Flat, becoming an unpaved dirt trail winding eastward through the Superstition Mountains. SR 88 again turns northeast and nears <b>Apache</b> Lake. The route follows the Salt River northeast to the Theodore Roosevelt Dam, near which the route is again paved. SR 88 intersects with SR 188 along the coast of Theodore Roosevelt Lake.|$|E
5|$|Singapore {{purchased}} 20 AH-64Ds {{aircraft in}} two batches between 1999 and 2001; during October 2010 <b>Apache</b> training was suspended following the forced crash-landing of an <b>Apache.</b>|$|E
5|$|The UK {{currently}} {{operates a}} modified version of the <b>Apache</b> Longbow; initially called the Westland WAH-64 <b>Apache,</b> it is designated the <b>Apache</b> AH1 by the British Army. Westland built 67 WAH-64 Apaches under license from Boeing, following a competition between the Eurocopter Tiger and the <b>Apache</b> for the British Army's new Attack Helicopter in 1995. Important deviations made by AgustaWestland from the U.S. <b>Apache</b> variants include changing to more powerful Rolls-Royce engines, and the addition of a folding blade assembly for use on naval ships.|$|E
5|$|As of 2011, the U.S. Army <b>Apache</b> fleet had {{accumulated}} more than 3 million flight hours {{since the first}} prototype flew in 1975. A DOD audit released in May 2011, found that Boeing had significantly overcharged the U.S. Army on multiple occasions, ranging from 33.3 percent to 177,475 percent for routine spare parts in helicopters like the <b>Apache.</b>|$|E
5|$|By 21 June 2011, the Libyan {{government}} had dubiously {{claimed to have}} successfully shot down dozens of aircraft, including five Apaches; NATO denied these claims and no <b>Apache</b> losses have been acknowledged to date. On 8 July 2011, the MoD released information on {{the first month of}} <b>Apache</b> combat operations over Libya; noting that Apaches had engaged targets within Libya on 39 occasions. <b>Apache</b> operations over Libya have been heavily influenced and supported by NATO reconnaissance flights and intelligence missions; information is continually relayed to update target information, assess the threat of Surface to Air missiles (SAM), and the presence of civilians, enabling real time changes to mission profiles. On 6 August, Apaches struck a military communications facility and troops at Al Watiyah. Both the <b>Apache</b> and the Eurofighter Typhoon were withdrawn from Libyan operations in September 2011 as operational demands decreased.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, Boeing {{conceptualized}} an <b>Apache</b> upgrade {{prior to}} the introduction of the U.S. Army's anticipated attack version of the Future Vertical Lift aircraft, forecast to replace the <b>Apache</b> by 2040. The conceptual AH-64F would have greater speed via a new 3,000 shp turboshaft engine from the improved turbine engine program, retractable landing gear, stub wings to offload lift from the main rotor during cruise, and a tail rotor that can articulate 90 degrees to provide forward thrust. In October 2016, the Army revealed they would not pursue another <b>Apache</b> upgrade to focus on funding the FVL; the Army will continue buying the <b>Apache</b> through the 2020s until Boeing's production line ends in 2026, then FVL is slated to come online in 2030.|$|E
5|$|Like the US AH-64D <b>Apache</b> Longbow, the <b>Apache</b> AH1 {{carries a}} fire-control radar (FCR) and Radar Frequency Interferometer (RFI), {{providing}} an integrated surveillance and attack system. The 'Longbow’ radar is the bulbous unit over the rotor hub assembly; radar placement above the rotors allows the <b>Apache</b> to hover behind cover scanning for targets, {{with only the}} radar unit exposed. Additionally, the Longbow radar can monitor traffic in the Apache's airspace. The radar {{can also be used}} for surveillance and terrain profiling. A modem is interfaced into the Longbow radar and other sensor systems to relay information to other aircraft, this allows other Apaches to fire on targets identified by only a single helicopter.|$|E
5|$|Marvin was {{teamed up}} with Averno and Chessman, forming a new trio called Los OGT. Los OGT won the AAA World Trios Championship on November 4, 2016, as they {{defeated}} Los Xinetes ("The Horsemen"; El Zorro, Dark Cuervo and Dark Scoria). They lost the title to El <b>Apache,</b> Faby <b>Apache</b> and Mary <b>Apache</b> on March 5, 2017, when Marvin was defeated by Faby in a singles match. On October 30, 2017, Marvin left AAA.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Apache</b> Trail {{connected}} the Old Spanish Trail where <b>Apache</b> Junction is today and Roosevelt Lake with an unpaved road {{as early as}} 1925, following much of the modern route. By the next year, SR 66 followed the <b>Apache</b> Trail and the Old Spanish Trail was numbered as US 80. The number 88 {{was given to the}} route by 1927, but continued past its current terminus east to US 180 west of Globe. US 60 and US 89 became concurrent with US 80 at the western terminus by 1935, and the US 70 designation was added to the road by 1939. The section of the route from <b>Apache</b> Junction to Canyon Lake was paved in the late 1940s. By 1958, the section east of Roosevelt Dam was paved. The extra designations at SR 88's western terminus were removed by 1971, leaving only the US 60 designation. In 1999, the section east of Roosevelt Dam was renumbered as SR 188, cutting SR 88 back to its current terminus.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Apache</b> {{originally}} {{started as}} the Model 77 developed by Hughes Helicopters for the United States Army's Advanced Attack Helicopter program {{to replace the}} AH-1 Cobra. The prototype YAH-64 was first flown on 30 September 1975. The U.S. Army selected the YAH-64 over the Bell YAH-63 in 1976, and later approved full production in 1982. After purchasing Hughes Helicopters in 1984, McDonnell Douglas continued AH-64 production and development. The helicopter was introduced to U.S. Army service in April 1986. The first production AH-64D <b>Apache</b> Longbow, an upgraded <b>Apache</b> variant, was delivered to the Army in March 1997. Production has been continued by Boeing Defense, Space & Security; over 2,000 AH-64s have been produced to date.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Apache</b> was {{a valued}} form of {{close air support}} in the {{conflict}} in Afghanistan, being deployed to the region in 2006. The <b>Apache</b> has been an object of controversy over the fitting of some weapons, such as cluster munitions. Naval trials and temporary deployments at sea have proven the aircraft as an able platform to operate from the decks of ships, which is a unique application of the <b>Apache</b> amongst its operators. British Apaches served in the NATO 2011 military intervention in Libya operating from Royal Navy ships.|$|E
5|$|The Apache's first {{operational}} {{tour was}} {{as part of}} 16 Air Assault Brigade in Afghanistan; there were eight <b>Apache</b> AH1s deployed in Afghanistan in February 2007. These were drawn from No. 656 Squadron and No. 664 Squadron of 9 Regiment AAC, based at Dishforth Airfield. Unlike their American counterparts in Afghanistan, the <b>Apache</b> AH1 is deployed with its Longbow Fire Control Radar to enable the pilot to better manage traffic in their airspace. Initially pilots had to often fly for 16–18 {{hours at a time}} due to the low number of Apaches in the theatre; typically each <b>Apache</b> would be stationed in Afghanistan for eight weeks before returning to Britain for roughly eight weeks of maintenance. On 22 May 2006, a UK <b>Apache</b> operating in Afghanistan's Helmand province used a Hellfire missile to destroy an abandoned French vehicle to protect sensitive equipment.|$|E
5|$|The Sunrise Dance Ceremony is not {{an ancient}} Yavapai ceremony. <b>Apache</b> and Yavapai often intermarried and adopted {{elements}} of each other's cultures; these two tribes reside together on the Camp Verde and Fort McDowell reservations. The Sunrise Dance is a four-day rite-of-transition for young <b>Apache</b> girls, which typically takes place from March through October. The sunrise dance is an ancient practice, unique to the <b>Apache.</b> It {{is related to the}} myth of the Changing Woman, a powerful figure in <b>Apache</b> culture who is believed to grant longevity. The power of Changing Woman is transferred to the pubescent girl through songs sung by the Medicine Man. A medicine man is joined by other tribal members in singing a series of songs, up to 32 which are believed to have first been sung by Changing Woman.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is powered}} by a pair of uprated T700-GE-701C engines. The forward fuselage was expanded to accommodate new systems to improve survivability, navigation, and 'tactical internet' communications capabilities. In February 2003, the first Block II <b>Apache</b> was delivered to the U.S. Army, featuring digital communications upgrades. The Japanese <b>Apache</b> AH-64DJP variant is based on the AH-64D; it can be equipped with the AIM-92 Stinger air-to-air missiles for self-defense.|$|E
5|$|The {{requirement}} {{for a new}} attack helicopter was identified by the British government in the early 1990s. In 1993, invitations to bid were issued. Bids received included the Eurocopter Tiger, a modernised Bell AH-1 SuperCobra, the AH-64 <b>Apache,</b> the Boeing/Sikorsky RAH-66 Comanche, and the Agusta A129 Mangusta. Both the Tiger and Cobra variant were derided for requiring development, and thus risk, while the <b>Apache</b> was combat proven, however its performance in the First Gulf War was criticised by competitors. Westland and the <b>Apache</b> was selected in July 1995, a contract for 67 helicopters was signed in 1996.|$|E
5|$|The tribes traded freely, {{and soon}} many had {{acquired}} French guns, while others had traded for Spanish horses. Tribes {{without access to}} either resource were left at a disadvantage. The Lipan <b>Apache,</b> who had been seasonal farmers, were soon pressed by the Comanche, who had horses, and the Wichita, who had guns. The Apaches were bitter enemies of the Tejas of East Texas and had transferred their enmity to the Spanish as friends of the Tejas. After discovering San Antonio in 1720, the <b>Apache</b> began repeatedly raiding the area to steal livestock, especially horses. An average of 3Spaniards died each year in Texas {{as a result of}} <b>Apache</b> attacks, with approximately 100animals taken each year. In retaliation, the Spanish launched multiple attacks on the Apaches, capturing horses and mules, hides and other plunder, and taking <b>Apache</b> captives, whom the Spanish used as household servants. By 1731, however, the San Antonio garrison was begging the government for help in negotiating a peace with the tribes.|$|E
5|$|Watson uses IBM's DeepQA {{software}} and the <b>Apache</b> UIMA (Unstructured Information Management Architecture) framework.

5|$|Contracted by the French Navy, <b>Apache</b> {{is based}} at Istres in Provence, France, with {{frequent}} deployments to Lorient and Landivisiau in Brittany, other locations as required. Operates two single-seater and one two-seat Hunters. Operations are associated with Lortie Aviation.|$|E
5|$|Hostile native {{tribes and}} {{distance}} from nearby Spanish colonies discouraged settlers from {{moving to the}} area. It was one of New Spain's least populated provinces. In 1749, the Spanish peace treaty with the Lipan <b>Apache</b> angered many tribes, including the Comanche, Tonkawa, and Hasinai. The Comanche signed a treaty with Spain in 1785 and later helped to defeat the Lipan <b>Apache</b> and Karankawa tribes. With more numerous missions being established, priests led a peaceful conversion of most tribes. By {{the end of the}} 18th century only a few nomadic tribes had not converted to Christianity.|$|E
5|$|In 1762, missionaries {{established}} two unauthorized missions {{south of}} San Sabá, in the Nueces River valley. For several years the <b>Apache</b> {{lived in the}} missions most of the year, but left in winter to hunt buffalo. One of the missions closed in 1763, when the <b>Apache</b> never returned from their hunt. The surviving mission closed in January 1766, after a force of 400natives from the northern tribes attacked, killing 6Apaches and taking 25captives {{as well as all}} the livestock in the valley. Forty-one Spanish troops and their small cannon ambushed the northern tribes as they returned to East Texas. Before the Spanish were forced to retreat, over 200Indians and 12Spanish soldiers died. After the battle, the <b>Apache</b> refused to return to the mission and returned to raiding near San Antonio. Raids by the northern tribes decreased, however.|$|E
5|$|In 1886, many Yavapai {{joined in}} campaigns by the US Army, as scouts, against Geronimo and other Chiricahua <b>Apache.</b>|$|E
5|$|In August 2012, the Egyptian Armed Forces {{undertook}} a large-scale military operation {{to regain control}} of the Sinai Peninsula from armed militants. Air cover throughout the operation was provided by the Egyptian Air Force's <b>Apache</b> helicopters; reportedly the Apaches destroyed three vehicles and killed at least 20 militants. Up to five Egyptian Apaches were temporarily stationed in the Sinai following an agreement between Egypt and Israel. In September 2015, an Egyptian <b>Apache</b> attacked a group of foreign tourists in the Western Desert, killing 12 people and injuring 10, they were mistaken for Islamist militants, the Egyptian Interior Ministry stated that the group were in a restricted area.|$|E
5|$|In July 2012, Qatar {{requested}} {{the sale of}} 24 AH-64D <b>Apache</b> Block III helicopters, with associated equipment, training, and support. The sale was approved on 27 March 2014.|$|E
5|$|On 17 March 2017, an <b>Apache</b> {{helicopter}} was reportedly {{involved in the}} attack on a Somali refugee boat in which 42 refugees were killed. Saudi Arabia denied involvement though {{it is the only}} military in the Yemeni Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Apaches were {{deployed}} to Hamid Karzai International Airport, {{as part of}} the Netherlands contribution to ISAF, on 10 April 2004, a pair of Dutch Apaches came under light gunfire close to the Kabul. On 17 December 2007, an RNLAF <b>Apache</b> flew into power lines during a night flying exercise in the Netherlands, forcing an emergency landing and causing a lengthy blackout in the region. On 17 March 2015, a RNLAF <b>Apache</b> crashed during a training mission in Mali. Both pilots died. The Ministry of Defense opened an investigation into the cause of the crash.|$|E
5|$|The AH-64E <b>Apache</b> has {{the ability}} to control {{unmanned}} aerial vehicles (UAVs), used by the U.S. Army to perform aerial scouting missions previously performed by the OH-58 Kiowa. Apaches can request to take control of an RQ-7 Shadow or MQ-1C Grey Eagle from ground control stations to safely scout via datalink communications. There are four levels of UAV interoperability (LOI): LOI 1 indirectly receives payload data; LOI 2 receives payload data through direct communication; LOI 3 deploys the UAV's armaments; and LOI 4 takes over flight control. UAVs can search for enemies and, if equipped with a laser designator, target them for the <b>Apache</b> or other friendly aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The Comanches {{were willing}} to fight the enemies of their new friends, and soon {{attacked}} the Karankawa. Over the next several years, the Comanches killed many of the Karankawa {{in the area and}} drove the others into Mexico. By 1804, very few natives lived on the barrier islands, where the Karankawa had made their home. In January 1790, the Comanche also helped the Spanish fight a large battle against the Mescalero and Lipan Apaches at Soledad Creek west of San Antonio. Over 1000Comanche warriors participated in raids against the <b>Apache</b> in 1791 and 1792, and the <b>Apache</b> were forced to scatter into the mountains in Mexico. In 1796, Spanish officials began an attempt to have the <b>Apache</b> and Comanche coexist in peace, and {{over the next ten years}} the intertribal fighting declined.|$|E
