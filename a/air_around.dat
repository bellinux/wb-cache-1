5|$|The loud bang that {{is heard}} is the super heated <b>air</b> <b>around</b> the {{lightning}} bolt expanding {{at the speed}} of sound. Because sound travels much more slowly than light the flash is seen before the bang, although both occur at the same moment.|$|E
5|$|Dry air {{and land}} {{weakened}} the tropical wave, {{and when it}} entered {{the area of the}} Bay of Campeche, it merged with a stationary frontal boundary. Cool, dry <b>air</b> <b>around</b> the system caused the system to develop a cold core, and the area organized into an extratropical low on September 30. A large high pressure system over the northern Gulf of Mexico forced the system southward, where it developed significant convection. The system developed a warm core, and on October 1 the storm organized into Tropical Storm Larry while located 300mi (483km) east-southeast of Tampico, Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Most bats are homeothermic, the {{exception}} being the Vespertilionidae, the Rhinolophidae and the Miniopteridae which extensively use heterothermy. Compared to other mammals, bats {{have a high}} thermal conductivity. Body heat is mainly lost through the wings as they are filled with blood vessels, {{but they may be}} used as an insulator while resting. By wrapping their wings around themselves, they can trap a layer of still <b>air</b> <b>around</b> themselves. Smaller bats generally have a higher metabolic rate than larger bats, and so need to consume more food in order to maintain homeothermy.|$|E
5|$|Pilot {{control was}} entirely through a single side-mounted control stick. Pitch and roll were {{controlled}} through conventional fore-aft and side-to-side motions, while yaw {{could be controlled}} by twisting the stick. No mechanical linkages were used, the stick instead controlled the flow of high pressure <b>air</b> <b>around</b> the craft, which either directly attached to various control surfaces, or indirectly through local cable linkages to replace controls that were intended to be cable-actuated (like throttle controls on the engines).|$|E
5|$|Originally, MTV {{planned to}} air the show {{several times during}} April 1992, it was normal for MTV Unplugged {{sessions}} to <b>air</b> <b>around</b> six times {{during the month of}} release, before being archived. Carey's version was met with critical acclaim and extended popularity, leading to it being shown more often than usual. Fans from around the United States made multiple requests for the show to be aired on television, {{and by the end of}} April 1992, Carey's episode of MTV Unplugged had aired over three-times as much as an average episode would. The concert's success tempted Sony officials to use it as some form of an album. However, Carey and Afansieff were already making headway on a new album set tentatively for release in 1993. This being so, Sony decided to release it as an EP, selling for a reduced price due to its shorter length.|$|E

5|$|This was a storyline that Russell T Davies {{thought up}} {{as a final}} one-part special for David Tennant on Doctor Who, (this was going to <b>air</b> <b>around</b> Easter 2010, near the time Series 5 would be airing.). The plot would have been that the Doctor finds a {{spaceship}} with an alien family on board (Russell mockingly titled them 'The Proestix Family'.) where the ship was broken, in the special {{he would have to}} sacrifice his life to save this family. This was a choice of a plotline which was also brought up with a two part special that then became The End of Time that he told to Jane Tranter and Julie Gardner. The Proestex family was kept in the special but were changed to be the Vinvocci, Aaddams and Rossiter.|$|E
25|$|It was at {{this time}} that CTC ceased 24-hour {{broadcasting}} after only two years. CTC's branding no longer matched Network Ten, so rather than confuse Capital Television viewers with Channel 10 after midnight, the station would go off <b>air</b> <b>around</b> 1am.|$|E
25|$|Since sesame is a small, flat seed, it is {{difficult}} to dry it after harvest because the small seed makes movement of <b>air</b> <b>around</b> the seed difficult. Therefore, the seeds need to be harvested as dry as possible and stored at 6% moisture or less. If the seed is too moist, it can quickly heat up and become rancid.|$|E

25|$|The {{gun barrel}} {{was placed in}} a long, large-diameter tube located between the spar and the leading edge. The tube channeled cooling <b>air</b> <b>around</b> the barrel and breech, {{exhausting}} out of a slot {{at the rear of the}} wing. The installation was so cramped that parts of the MG 17's breech mechanism extended into an opening created in the flap structure.|$|E
25|$|Air within {{high-pressure}} systems rotates in {{a direction}} such that the Coriolis force is directed radially inwards, and nearly balanced by the outwardly radial pressure gradient. As a result, air travels clockwise around high pressure in the Northern Hemisphere and anticlockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. <b>Air</b> <b>around</b> low-pressure rotates in the opposite direction, so that the Coriolis force is directed radially outward and nearly balances an inwardly radial pressure gradient.|$|E
25|$|This organ allows {{labyrinth}} fish {{to take in}} oxygen {{directly from}} the air, instead of taking it from the water in which they reside through use of gills. The labyrinth organ helps the oxygen in the inhaled air to be absorbed into the bloodstream. As a result, labyrinth fish can survive {{for a short period}} of time out of water, as they can inhale the <b>air</b> <b>around</b> them, provided they stay moist.|$|E

25|$|Sometimes, modern beatboxers {{will use}} their hand or {{another part of}} their body to extend the {{spectrum}} of sound effects and rhythm. Some have developed a technique that involves blowing and sucking <b>air</b> <b>around</b> their fingers to produce a very realistic record scratching noise, which {{is commonly known as}} the 'crab scratch'. Another hand technique includes the 'throat tap' which involves the beatboxer tapping their fingers against their throat as they throat sing or hum.|$|E

Some of Rand's allies are inside the dome; Perrin and Loial are two such. The rest of his allies (e.g. several Wise Ones, Rhuarc) are outside of the dome, still fighting. The shield cannot be raised to admit his allies without letting the Shaido in.|$|E
25|$|Further {{investigation}} {{revealed that}} Victor {{was covered in}} acid, and {{there was so much}} of it in the car that it soaked the carpet and seats, making the <b>air</b> <b>around</b> the truck poisonous. Victor and Jorge were taken to separate hospitals for their injuries. A city hazmat team and the state Department of Environmental Protection arrived by the afternoon to decontaminate the area. At about 3:45pm, a DEP contractor sorting through tubs of chemicals in the bed of the truck found a black garbage bag. Inside were human remains.|$|E

25|$|The {{solution}} to this problem is the removal of the turbine. The ramjet engine consists mostly of a large tube, and is relatively easy to air-cool by forcing extra <b>air</b> <b>around</b> the engine. Experimental ramjet aircraft of the era, like the Lockheed X-7, were reaching speeds as high as Mach4. There are numerous problems with the ramjet engine, however. Fuel economy, or thrust specific fuel consumption in aircraft terms, is extremely poor. This makes general operations like flying from one airbase to another expensive propositions. More problematic is the fact that ramjets rely on forward speed to compress the incoming air, and become efficient above Mach1.|$|E
25|$|Mr. Mime {{are gifted}} {{with the art}} of miming at a young age, but as they mature, they gain {{the ability to make}} {{invisible}} objects by emitting energy from their fingers and minutely vibrating their fingertips to harden the <b>air</b> <b>around</b> them and form a wall. Barriers generated this way can repel harsh attacks, and its gestures and motions can convince watchers that something unseeable actually exists; once this is achieved, the perceived item will materialize. Mr. Mime are very prideful of their pantomime acts, and will heavily slap anyone that interrupts them while miming. Mr. Mime has a pre-evolution, Mime Jr., which evolves when mimicking other Pokémon.|$|E
25|$|To {{produce a}} shock wave, {{an object in}} a given medium (such as air or water) must travel faster than the local speed of sound. In {{the case of an}} {{aircraft}} travelling at high subsonic speed, regions of <b>air</b> <b>around</b> the aircraft may be travelling at exactly the speed of sound, so that the sound waves leaving the aircraft pile up on one another, similar to a traffic jam on a motorway. When a shock wave forms, the local air pressure increases and then spreads out sideways. Because of this amplification effect, a shock wave can be very intense, more like an explosion when heard at a distance (not coincidentally, since explosions create shock waves).|$|E
