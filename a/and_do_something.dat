5|$|Absolutely. There's a {{song called}} 'Army of Me,' {{which is sort of}} a 'Fighter 2.0.' There is a new {{generation}} of fans from a younger demographic that might not have been with me all the way but that watch me on the show now. I feel like every generation should be able to enjoy and have their piece of 'Fighter' within. This time, the way it musically came together it just felt right for this time and this generation. There's {{always going to be a}} fighter in me getting through some obstacle and some hurdle. All these 6-year-olds who know me from pushing my button and turning around in a big red chair who weren't around for the actual 'Fighter,' this is my chance to recharge it, rejuvenate it <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> modernized for them.|$|E
5|$|Developmental stages began for {{the film}} midway through the series' first season {{production}} in January 1998. Co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone signed a deal with Comedy Central in April 1998 that contracted the duo to producing South Park episodes until 1999, gave them {{a slice of the}} lucrative spinoff merchandising the show generated within its first year, as well as an unspecified seven-figure cash bonus to bring the show to the big screen, in theaters. A large part of Parker and Stone's conditions attached to any potential movie project was that it must at least be R-rated, {{to keep in touch with}} the series' humor and its roots, the short The Spirit of Christmas. Parker stated that their desire was to approach the film from a much more creative perspective <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> other than a simple movie-length version of a regular episode. Despite alleged pressure from Paramount Pictures officials to keep the movie toned down, the two won the battle for a more mature rating.|$|E

GCED can be taught from a critical and transformative perspective, whereby students are thinking, feeling, and doing. In this approach, GCED requires students to be politically critical and personally transformative. Teachers provide social issues in a neutral and grade-appropriate way for students to understand, grapple with, <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> about.|$|E
25|$|Moving into {{free space}} {{is one of}} the most {{critical}} skills that football players must develop. Attacking players must move off the ball into space to give an advance the maximum chance of success. Passes to space are feasible when there is intelligent movement of players to receive the ball <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> constructive with it. Skilled players are able to find seams between defenders, positioning themselves to receive a pass.|$|E

Schoolchildren are not afraid of “Foma”, as the P. E.

25|$|Maynard {{joined in}} the logging {{activity}} at New York-Alki (later Seattle), {{near the mouth of}} the Duwamish River on Puget Sound. Instead of selling his wood to shippers at $4 a cord, he leased a vessel from Captain Felker, using the wood itself as security, and sold the load in San Francisco at ten times the price. With that money, he bought the fixings for a general store and briefly set up in competition to the only other such store on Puget Sound, which was in Olympia and owned by Catherine's brother. Mike soon agreed to his sister marrying Maynard, apparently on condition that they move the store to Duwamps <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> about that prior marriage.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} year, Kaif was {{paired with}} Hrithik Roshan in Zoya Akhtar's coming-of-age dramedy Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara. The film narrates {{the story of}} three friends on a bachelor trip, and how the workaholism of one was overcome {{with the help of}} Laila (Kaif). The film was a critical and commercial success. Richard Kuipers of Variety commented that she is [...] "delightful as the sweet-natured girl who inspires everyone {{to look in the mirror}} <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> about it". Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara was one of the most awarded films of the year and received numerous Best Film accolades.|$|E

I think it's more mature and more brave all around; it's like the instruments actually go together, the piano and guitar and vocals, since they're written together -- they intertwine. It's definitely even more personal. At least for me, because I was there, it sounds more fun because I was having so much more fun." ...|$|E
500|$|I don't think it's {{important}} to take it too literally. I think the song, more than anything, is about having a sense of urgency; about how we are you know, living on borrowed time essentially and people are becoming much {{more aware of the}} environment and how we're destroying the planet.

500|$|Following {{his victory}} in the presidential election, John {{resigned}} from his seat as U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, but Ted was not eligible to fill the vacancy until February 22, 1962, when he would turn thirty years of age. Initially Ted wanted to stay out West <b>and</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> other than run for office right away; he said, [...] "The disadvantage of my position is being constantly compared with two brothers of such superior ability." [...] His brothers were {{not in favor of}} his running immediately either, but ultimately Ted coveted the Senate seat as an accomplishment to match his brothers' and their father overruled them. Therefore, John asked Massachusetts Governor Foster Furcolo to name Kennedy family friend Ben Smith as interim senator for John's unexpired term, which he did in December 1960. This kept the seat available for Ted.|$|E
