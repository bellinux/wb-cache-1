500|$|Like {{almost all}} members of the Felidae, cats have protractable and {{retractable}} claws. In their normal, relaxed position, the claws are sheathed with the skin and fur around the paw's toe pads. This keeps the claws sharp by preventing wear from contact with the ground and allows the silent stalking of prey. The claws on the fore feet are typically sharper than those on the hind feet. Cats can voluntarily extend their claws on one or more paws. They may extend their claws in hunting or self-defense, climbing, kneading, or for extra traction on soft surfaces. Most cats have five claws on their front paws, and four on their rear paws. The fifth front claw (the dewclaw) is proximal to the other claws. More proximally is a protrusion which appears to be a sixth [...] "finger". This special feature of the front paws, {{on the inside of the}} wrists, is the carpal pad, also found on the paws of big cats and dogs. It has no function in normal walking, but is thought to be an <b>antiskidding</b> device used while jumping. Some breeds of cats are prone to polydactyly (extra toes and claws).

5000|$|When {{launching}} the M24 Volga, GAZ envisioned an average, for the USSR, production run of a decade. The newer designs were produced by smaller numbers due to development of other {{projects in the}} Soviet automotive industry, in particular the coming about of the VAZ plant and a much bigger Moskvitch, the project 3-5, to replace the 408 and 412 series. The latter's being more economic would have proved a natural relieve the Volga of its traditional taxi role, leaving GAZ's new vehicle as a more exclusive personal luxury car for the mid-range Soviet nomenklatura. With this in mind, the vehicle's mock-up demonstrated in 1976was to grow in size, have the V6 powerplant as standard, and a perspective 4.2 litre V8 optional with many other features of the contemporary foreign cars of the 1970s. In 1976-7, the new GAZ-3101 appeared in prototype form, but it {{was little more than}} [...] "a cosmetic tart-up of the mainstream Volga", with new front door windows, door handles, and lights; it also got longer front overhang and longer trunk. This would be renamed the 3102 in time. A few were built with a [...] V8 as the 31011, but this never entered serial production, nor did the continuing GAZ-desired V6 model. (Among its standard features were a fire extinguisher.) It was powered by a twelve-valve version (ZMZ 402.10) of the venerable [...] inline four with electronic ignition, producing , enough for 94 mph.

5000|$|The Twin Otter {{incorporated}} [...] "flaperons" [...] that drooped the ailerons {{as part of}} the flaps, {{but these}} {{were not included in the}} Dash 7 due to weight and complexity. Instead, the ailerons were reduced in size to allow more flap area, and were augmented with two sets of roll spoilers, or [...] "spoilerons". The inboard roll spoilers operate at all speeds. while the outboard roll spoilers only operate at speeds less than 130 KIAS to allow for more roll control at slower speeds. Upon touchdown, both the inboard and outboard roll spoilers extend in unison to aid in destroying lift created by the wing. Each wing also includes two ground spoilers which only extend on touchdown. Most of the trailing edge is spanned by a complex, double Fowler flap arrangement for high lift at low speed. During a typical STOL landing, flaps are selected to the 45° position, generating more lift and drag, thus allowing for steeper descents and slower approach speeds. Depending on weight, the VREF speed with flaps at 45° is between 70 and 85 knots. On touchdown, through [...] "squat switches" [...] in the main gear, the flaps automatically retract to the 25° position, thus reducing lift once on the runway and producing better braking performance. The flaps also retract to 25° when engine power is increased during a go-around procedure. The four-engine layout aids lift at low speeds due to the wide span of the propellers blowing air over the wing ("propwash"). When reverse thrust is selected on landing, the props reverse pitch, push air forward, and slow the aircraft very effectively along with the <b>antiskid</b> wheel brakes. More importantly, if an engine fails, the asymmetric thrust is much less than on a twin-engine layout, thereby increasing safety and allowing for a lower minimum control speed with an engine inoperative [...]|$|E

40|$|Tar-containing <b>antiskid</b> surface layers are {{currently}} used on airfield runways. They {{have very good}} adhesion properties and an excellent fuel resistance, which make them outstanding compared to other surface layers with bitumen as binder. However, tar-containing products have a high Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) content. They are toxic and not environmental-friendly. Tar-containing products are not allowed in the Netherlands since 20 years ago, with one temporary exception for <b>antiskid</b> surfaces on runways. After 2010, {{it will not be}} allowed to apply such <b>antiskid</b> layers anymore. For this reason, alternatives to tar containing binders for <b>antiskid</b> runways are strongly required. Before looking into alternatives, the properties of tar-containing <b>antiskid</b> surface layers need to be evaluated and benchmarks should be developed. This paper focuses on the mechanical properties of tar-containing <b>antiskid</b> surface layers. A special Leutner shear test and an advanced pull test were designed to test the shear and tensile strength in the interface between the tar containing <b>antiskid</b> layer and the asphalt mixture layer below. Furthermore the <b>antiskid</b> binder was retrieved and DSR tests were performed to obtain the mechanical characteristics of the material.

40|$|Thin surfacings {{are widely}} used as surface layers to provide {{additional}} functions and to extend the service life of existing pavements. They can protect the treated road surfaces from external aggressive substances, the degeneration process of weather and the ageing caused by Ultraviolet light and oxygen. <b>Antiskid</b> surfacing is one type of thin surfacings. It refers to road surface treatment which includes high-friction aggregates and an adhesive binder to bond the aggregates to the road surface. <b>Antiskid</b> surfacing {{is designed to provide}} skid resistance, which means excellent adhesion property is then necessary for binding the aggregates together on the surface. So binders with high adhesion strength with aggregates are strongly required. In the Netherlands, most of the airfield runways used tar-containing binders for the <b>antiskid</b> surfacings. Unlike bitumen based materials, tar-containing surface layers, because of the unique chemical and molecular structure of refined tar, are inherently resistant to chemicals and can provide better adhesive property. However, tar-containing binder is toxic and carcinogenic because of its high Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) content. It cannot meet the Dutch environmental standards and hence will not be allowed for <b>antiskid</b> surfacing on the runways. Therefore, alternatives to tar-containing binders are urgently required. Research on this topic has been being under investigation for a number of years. This research mainly focuses on the definition of requirements for the alternatives, together with a design approach on thin surfacings. Firstly, specimens with tar-containing <b>antiskid</b> layers on the surface were collected from six airfields’ runways. Fourier Transform Infrared, surface characteristics, tensile adhesion and shear adhesion at the interface were investigated. The tar-containing <b>antiskid</b> layers have a minimum 1. 26 mm of texture depth and can keep this texture depth for a long service life. The improved pull test and shear test methods are suitable for evaluating the adhesive properties between thin <b>antiskid</b> surface layer and underlying asphalt mixture layer. The shear strength at the interface between tar-containing <b>antiskid</b> layer and underlying asphalt mixture layer is higher than the value at the interface between asphalt mixture layers. The conclusions from these test results are used as benchmarks for alternative <b>antiskid</b> surfacings. Secondly, newly designed binders, which are considered as potential binders for <b>antiskid</b> surfacings, were researched. Copolymer modified bitumen emulsion (MBE), 2 -component Modified Epoxy Resin (MER) and 2 -component Epoxy Modified Bitumen (EMB) were included. The curing behavior, direct tensile strength, high temperature resistance, weather resistance and low temperature relaxation properties were studied by means of Direct Tensile Test, oven ageing and weatherometer ageing, Dynamic Shear Rheometer test, Dynamic Mechanic Thermal Analysis and Relaxation test. Test results indicate that the investigated 2 -component epoxy modified bitumen can be designed as a suitable binder for <b>antiskid</b> surfacing, with good high temperature resistance, qualified relaxation behavior, sufficient tensile strength and enough failure strain. Thirdly, one of the researched 2 -component epoxy modified bitumen was then used to design <b>antiskid</b> surfacing in the lab. The surface characteristics, resistance to tensile stress and shear stress were then investigated. Noise-reducing thin surface layers were also included in this research. The results show that EMB based <b>antiskid</b> layer can provide better adhesion at the interface than tar-containing <b>antiskid</b> layer and polymer modified bitumen based <b>antiskid</b> layers. Fourthly, the Finite Element Models of <b>antiskid</b> surfacing were developed to simulate the loading condition in the <b>antiskid</b> surface layers. The viscoelastic properties of EMB and MBE were used as input. The calculation shows that the <b>antiskid</b> structure has huge influence on the resulting binder behaviors. The stresses generated in the EMB binder are slightly higher than in the MBE binder, while the MBE is subjected to much higher maximum principal strain and shear strain levels. Furthermore, the EMB binder has better ability to recover after loading. The aggregate skeleton has a higher influence on the stresses and strains in the soft MBE binder than on the stresses and strains in the EMB binder. At the end, some recommendations are given for further research. Trial sections in the field and fuel resistance are suggested. Fatigue property and failure mechanics are also recommended to investigate the damage mechanisms with FEM model. Structural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

This analysis was made possible by the quantitative test data provided by recently completed landing research programs using fully instrumented flight test airplanes and was further supported by tests performed at the Langley aircraft landing loads and traction facility. The <b>antiskid</b> system logic for brake control and for both touchdown and locked-wheel protection is described and its response behavior in adverse weather is discussed in detail with the aid of available data. The analysis indicates that the operational {{performance of}} the <b>antiskid</b> logic circuits is highly dependent upon wheel spin-up acceleration and can be adversely affected by certain pilot braking inputs when accelerations are low. Normal <b>antiskid</b> performance is assured if the tire-to-runway traction is sufficient to provide high wheel spin-up accelerations or if the system is provided a continuous, accurate ground speed reference.

In order to design and optimize a fuzzy controlled <b>antiskid</b> system for motorbikes a fuzzy model of the pilot was applied to a lumped-mass model of the motorcycle (two different models have been considered). The fuzzy pilot acts on the steering angle to control trajectory, yaw angle, yaw velocity and roll angle.

The silt loading data for paved roads have been divided into baseline contributions from ubiquitous sources and hot spot contributions from application of <b>antiskid</b> materials and from mud/dirt track-out. The baseline silt loading is found to be inversely proportional to the traffic volume on a paved road. The amount of <b>antiskid</b> material is related to the annual snowfall in a region. The hotspot contribution from mud/dirt track-out is dependent on the number of construction sites and the extent of industrial activities involving aggregate handling and transport. Fugitive dust emissions from unpaved roads depend on the silt content that in turn is related to whether native soil or road aggregate is utilized as the surface material. The moisture content of unpaved roads is related to climatic parameters that influence moisture accumulation and moisture loss in the top surface layer. Moisture loss also is dependent on the volume of vehicle traffic because of the enhanced evaporation rate. Unpaved road traffic volume can be predicted on the basis of rural road mileage and rural population density...|$|E
40|$|In {{northern}} latitudes mineral dust {{is formed}} when cars use studded tyres and roads are sanded to obtain more traction on the icy surfaces. Anti-skid and asphalt aggregates with different textural, mineralogical and mechanical properties were tested with an indoor road simulator fitted with studded and friction tyres. The {{particle size distribution}} and proportions of dust from pavement and anti-skid aggregate were analyzed using SEM-EDX. The wear on the road pavement depends on {{the properties of the}} anti-skid and asphalt aggregate (particle size distribution, mechanical/physical and textural properties). <b>Antiskid</b> aggregates, which contain mainly hard minerals (e. g. feldspars and quartz) and which have a low resistance to fragmentation, should be used with caution as they may break more easily into smaller particles and are likely to wear the pavement. By using high-quality anti-skid aggregates it is possible {{to reduce the amount of}} urban dust...|$|E
