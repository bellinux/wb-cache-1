5|$|Bill Wood, the Astros' general manager, {{said the}} team {{believed}} Nevin {{was close to}} <b>a</b> <b>major-league</b> level and would require little development in minor league baseball. As evidence for this, the Astros pointed to Nevin's training with the wooden bats used in professional baseball {{in an effort to}} prepare himself for the transition from metal bats. The Astros believed he would be a solid power hitter and have a strong work ethic. Nevin also did not intend to seek a signing bonus approaching those received by Van Poppel and Taylor. The Astros decided to employ Nevin as a third baseman. Not wanting to draw out his contract negotiations, Nevin signed with Houston in June, receiving a $700,000 bonus.|$|E

50|$|Normally, Johnson {{would have}} had to pay the Yankees an {{indemnity}} for moving to Kansas City, and also {{would have had}} to reimburse the Yankees for the costs they incurred for moving the Blues to Denver {{to make way for the}} <b>A's.</b> <b>Major-league</b> rules of the time gave the Yankees the major-league rights to Kansas City. However, the Yankees waived these payments as soon as the purchase was approved. This, combined with the Yankees' thinly concealed support for the sale, led to rumors of collusion between Johnson and the Yankees.|$|R

25|$|By this time, McLain {{had serious}} arm trouble, {{inadvertently}} {{made worse by}} numerous cortisone shots he took for his sore arm. As a result, he essentially stopped throwing fastballs midway through the 1971 season. Due to his arm troubles and his inability {{to get along with}} Williams, McLain went 10–22. He thus earned the dubious distinction of going from leading his league in wins (tied with Mike Cuellar with 24 wins in 1969) to two years later leading his league in losses. McLain's 22 defeats (a mark later tied by three pitchers, all in 1974) remains the most in <b>a</b> <b>major-league</b> season since Jack Fisher of the Mets lost 24 in 1965.|$|E

Following the 1971 season, he was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers with pitchers Jim Colborn and Earl Stephenson in exchange for outfielder José Cardenal. Davis batted [...]318 in 1972 in a utility role with the Brewers. His final game as <b>a</b> <b>major-leaguer</b> was on October 4, 1972.|$|R
5000|$|Christopher {{became the}} Mets’ fifth {{pick in the}} 1961 MLB Expansion Draft.

He had a career-best day on August 19, {{collecting}} two triples, a double, and a home run in an 8-6 victory over his former Pirates teammates. Then, on September 25 he broke up the no-hit bid of Cincinnati Reds pitcher Jim Maloney at Shea Stadium. His second-inning single was the only hit against Maloney, who {{had to settle for}} a 3-0 shutout.|$|R
25|$|Greenberg {{was again}} voted to the AL All-Star roster in 1938, {{but because he}} was not named to the 1935 AL All-Star roster and was benched in the 1937 game, he {{declined}} to accept a starting position on the 1938 AL team and did not play (NL won 4-1). He led the league in runs scored (144) and at-bats per home run (9.6), tied for the AL lead in walks (119), was second in RBIs (146), slugging percentage (.683), and total bases (380), and third in OBP (.438) and set a still-standing major league record of 39 homers in his home park, the newly reconfigured Briggs Stadium. He also set <b>a</b> <b>major-league</b> record with 11 multiple-home run games. He came in third in the vote for MVP.|$|E
25|$|At the time, {{players with}} {{one year of}} service {{in the minor leagues}} were subject to a draft if they were not called up to the major leagues. The White Sox left McLain in the minor leagues, and he was {{selected}} off waivers by the Detroit Tigers on April 8, 1963. He progressed swiftly through the Tigers' minor league system, and made his major-league debut with them on September 21, 1963 at the age of 19. His major-league debut, against the Chicago White Sox, was almost as impressive as his minor-league debut, holding the White Sox to one earned run on seven hits. He also picked off two baserunners and hit a home run, which was the only home run of his major-league career. McLain is one of only six teenaged pitchers to hit <b>a</b> <b>major-league</b> home run since 1920, a list that includes Hall-of-Famers Don Drysdale and Jim Palmer.|$|E
25|$|McLain {{began the}} 1964 {{season with the}} Syracuse Chiefs of the International League, but was called back to the major leagues in early June and ended {{the season with a}} won-loss record of 4-5. He then played for the Mayagüez Indians in the Puerto Rico Baseball League, where he posted a 13-2 record and helped the Indians win the league championship. He was called back to the majors in 1965 and {{continued}} to pitch well for the Tigers. On June 15, McLain set <b>a</b> <b>major-league</b> record for relief pitchers, when he struck out the first seven batters he faced after entering the game in the first inning to relieve starting pitcher Dave Wickersham. He ended the season with a 16-6 record, a 2.61 earned run average, and 192 strikeouts, the third-highest strikeout total in the American League behind Sam McDowell and teammate Mickey Lolich. Although he had a curveball and a changeup, he relied mostly on his fastball to get batters out.|$|E

25|$|In a 3–2 {{victory over}} the Tigers at Nationals Park on May 11, Max Scherzer struck out 20 {{in the course of}} {{pitching}} a six-hit complete game, tying the Major League Baseball record for strikeouts in a nine-inning game and becoming only the third player in Major League Baseball history to do so. Through six innings, he threw 77 pitches, 62 of which were strikes. He set a new Nationals Park record for strikeouts in single game when he struck out Detroit shortstop José Iglesias for his 16th strikeout, set a new personal record in the next at-bat when he struck out pinch-hitter Jarrod Saltalamacchia for his 17th, and in the at-bat after that he ended the inning by striking out second baseman Ian Kinsler for his 18th, tying the Montreal-Washington franchise′s single-game record. Scherzer entered the ninth inning having thrown 106 pitches. He gave up a solo home run to right fielder J. D. Martinez on the first pitch of the inning, but in the next at-bat he struck out third baseman Miguel Cabrera to set a new Montreal-Washington franchise record with 19 strikeouts. After giving up a single to first baseman Víctor Martinez – the only Tiger who made a plate appearance that he did not strike out during the game – he struck out left fielder Justin Upton on three pitches for his 20th and final strikeout. It was only the fourth time in Major League Baseball history that a pitcher had struck out 20 batters in a nine-inning game, and only the sixth time a pitcher had struck out at least 20 batters in any game. Although Scherzer gave up more hits and more runs than any previous pitcher who had struck out 20 batters in nine innings, he did not issue any walks, and of the 119 pitches he threw, 96 were strikes, the first time a pitcher had thrown 96 strikes in <b>a</b> <b>major-league</b> game since 2013; taking into account both the number of strikes thrown and the ratio of strikes to balls, it was the greatest number of strikes thrown in the fewest number of pitches in Major League Baseball history.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{playing in}} nine fewer games than the {{previous}} season, he drew 198 walks, <b>a</b> <b>major-league</b> record; 68 of them were intentional walks, surpassing Willie McCovey's 45 in 1969 for another Major League record. He slugged [...]799, then the fourth-highest total all time. Bonds broke Ted Williams' major league record for on-base average with [...]582. Bonds also hit his 600th home run, {{less than a year}} and a half after hitting his 500th. [...] The home run came on August 9 at home against Kip Wells of the Pirates.|$|E
500|$|Nominated to {{his fourth}} career All-Star Game, Bagwell {{to that point}} in the season had scored or driven in 28.6% of the Astros' runs, the highest portion of a team's offense for which any one player in MLB accounted. [...] He was {{stationed}} first in the NL in walks (83), runs scored (81) and OBP (.464), second in HR (28), RBI (78) and SLG (.648) and had 17 base thefts while Houston tenanted percentage points behind Cincinnati for first in the division.

Susan and Simon Veness described the ride section as thrilling, calling it [...] "one of the highlights" [...] of the attraction. Arthur Levine of About.com gave the ride three out of five stars. Levine gave this moderate rating because he felt conflicted: the animations themselves were good, but the overall storyline was sparse; the ride system was intriguing, yet it was underutilised. He concluded by applauding [...] "SeaWorld for taking the bold initiative to build <b>a</b> <b>major-league</b> attraction", but stated [...] "the ride feels rushed and too short".|$|E
500|$|Before the 2003 season Rodríguez {{signed with}} the Florida Marlins. By then <b>a</b> <b>major-league</b> veteran of over a decade, he helped lead the young team to victory in the World Series. During the 2003 regular season, he set many Marlins single season records for a catcher, such as batting average, at [...]297, and runs batted in, at 85. On March 31, Rodríguez became the tenth Marlins player ever to {{hit a home run}} in the team's first game of the season. On April 8, he set a Marlins single game record by drawing five walks in a game against the New York Mets. He had a nine-game hitting streak from June 24 to July 2, during which he batted [...]500 with seven doubles, two triples, and four home runs. From June 24 to July 1, he drove in a run in eight {{consecutive}} games, another single season record for the Florida Marlins.

500|$|Before {{joining the}} major leagues, Hogan played for minor league {{baseball}} teams in the northeastern United States, including the Akron (Ohio) Summits and Scranton (Pennsylvania) Miners. He {{began his career as}} a major league player with the Cincinnati Reds, on August 4, 1894, but played only six games before switching to the St. Louis Browns (later known as the Cardinals). By this time, St. Louis had been eliminated from league championship contention, after being tied with Cleveland and Boston for first place in April. Hogan participated in 29 games with St. Louis in the 1894 season. According to the 1895 edition of Spalding's Official Baseball Guide, he ranked tenth among league outfielders with a percentage of [...]941 for put-outs, assists, and errors. Among his teammates, Hogan held the second highest percentage of stolen bases for games played. [...] In March 1895, a reporter for Sporting Life praised the Browns' decision to retain Hogan in center field and emphasized the young outfielder's potential. [...] "On the bases and in the field the lad is a wonder", the paper stated. [...] "His only fault is weakness at the bat, but increasing confidence and familiarity with [...] League players will undoubtedly improve him in this respect". [...] Despite Hogan's physical speed, however, his overall performance with the Browns proved uneven, and his two-season batting average was just [...]241. On May 17, 1895, the Youngstown Daily Vindicator reported that Hogan had been [...] "farmed out" [...] as a center fielder to the Indianapolis Hoosiers, a club connected to the well-organized Western League, the predecessor of the American League. [...] The Vindicator added, [...] "At any time by giving a proper notification the St. Louis team, of which club Hogan is a member, can again secure his services". Yet, for reasons that are unclear, Hogan never returned to the St. Louis Browns. [...] He played his last game with the team on April 24, 1895, concluding <b>a</b> <b>major-league</b> career that comprised 40 games over two seasons.|$|E
