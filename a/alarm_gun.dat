60|$|In fact {{we reached}} the boat's side and were all aboard before the watch upon the battleship, aroused by the shots, {{detected}} us. Then an <b>alarm</b> <b>gun</b> bellowed from a ship's bow, its deep boom reverberating in deafening tones beneath the rocky dome of Omean.|$|E
60|$|Cornwallis {{arrived at}} Williamsburg on the 25th, and sent out Simcoe to destroy some boats and stores on the Chickahominy River, and to sweep off the cattle of the neighborhood. Lafayette {{heard of the}} ravage, and {{detached}} Lieutenant-colonel Butler, of the Pennsylvania line, with a corps of light troops, and a body of horse under Major McPherson, to intercept the marauders. As the infantry could not push on fast enough for the emergency, McPherson took up fifty of them behind fifty of his dragoons, and dashed on. He overtook a company of Simcoe's rangers under Captain Shank about six miles from Williamsburg, foraging at a farm; a sharp encounter took place; McPherson at the outset was unhorsed and severely hurt. The action continued. Simcoe with his infantry, {{who had been in}} the advance convoying a drove of cattle, now engaged in the fight. Butler's riflemen began to arrive, and supported the dragoons. Neither knew the strength of the force they were contending with; but supposed it the advance guard of the opposite army. An <b>alarm</b> <b>gun</b> was fired by the British on a neighboring hill. It was answered by alarm guns at Williamsburg. The Americans supposed the whole British force coming out to assail them, and began to retire. Simcoe, imagining Lafayette to be at hand, likewise drew off, and pursued his march to Williamsburg. The loss in killed and wounded on both sides was severe for the number engaged; but the statements vary, and were never reconciled.|$|E
5000|$|When {{news that}} Brunswick had {{captured}} Verdun reached the Convention, they ordered the <b>alarm</b> <b>guns</b> fired, which escalated {{the sense of}} panic. An army of 60,000 was to be enlisted at the Champ de Mars, the British ambassador reported: ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1950s Röhm GmbH of Sontheim/Brenz, which was {{traditionally}} {{focused on the}} production of chucking tools, diversified its product line and began to produce gas <b>alarm</b> <b>guns,</b> flare guns and handguns. Röhm's product line of firearms was primarily established under the brand name RG.|$|R
60|$|The drums beat to {{arms in the}} British camp. <b>Alarm</b> <b>guns</b> {{were fired}} from Mount Hope; General Fraser dashed into Ticonderoga with his pickets, giving orders for his brigade to arm in all haste and follow. By daybreak he had hoisted the British flag over the deserted fortress; before sunrise he had passed the bridge and was in full pursuit of the American rear-guard.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} morning hours of 17 August 2012, four guests refused to pay their bill at Artemis. One of them drew a gun and shot at the doormen, {{injuring}} three of them. The group then fled by car. The gun was a modified <b>alarm</b> <b>gun</b> that shot plastic bullets. A few weeks later, a Russian resident of Berlin was arrested as a suspect in the case.|$|E
5000|$|In 1950, Herbert Schmidt got {{the license}} to produce {{starting}} pistols and blank-firers, {{which were then}} made in a rented location. The first model was a single-shot <b>alarm</b> <b>gun</b> (for yachting purposes). In 1951, the production hall was completed, and the model range had been increased, to include a double-action revolver in [...]22 caliber. The production of own cartridges began at the same time. In 1959, a single-action revolver in the Western style, the 120, 121, 121 a and the 121 S, were born; they were first made in [...]22 magnum.|$|E
50|$|During the French and Indian War, the {{community}} was raided twice. The first attack was from the Abenaki just after sunrise on May 22, 1758. They killed and scalped Joshua and Hannah Bradford and their infant son Winslow. An original settler from Kingston, Massachusetts and great-grandson of Governor William Bradford, he had remained in his house, believing it {{close enough to the}} garrison that his family could flee there when necessary. But while pounding corn, the Bradfords missed hearing the garrison's <b>alarm</b> <b>gun.</b> Five of their children managed to escape their pursuers into the fort, but two of their sons Cornelius (21) and Joshua (12) were captured and carried to Canada.|$|E
60|$|In {{the mean}} time, Colonel Smith {{set out on}} his nocturnal march from Lechmere Point by an unfrequented path across marshes, where at times the troops had to wade through water. He had {{proceeded}} but a few miles when <b>alarm</b> <b>guns,</b> booming through the night air, and the clang of village bells, showed that the news of his approach was travelling before him, and the people were rising. He now sent back to General Gage for a reinforcement, while Major Pitcairne was detached with six companies to press forward, and secure the bridges at Concord.|$|R
50|$|<b>Alarm</b> <b>guns</b> {{were fired}} and expresses {{were sent to}} call in the {{neighboring}} militias. Most of the militia did not arrive in time to render assistance, however, {{by the end of}} the day, some 3,000 local militia had assembled but they did not engage. The British had been misinformed about the defenses of the harbor and assumed there was nothing to be feared in the way of ordnance. The force at that time in town was, besides the crew of Oneida, a regiment under Colonel Bellinger, a volunteer company of artillery under Captain Camp, and the militia.|$|R
5000|$|At about 4:15 a.m., Thaddeus Bowman came {{riding up}} at a full gallop. He {{had found the}} Regulars, but had been trapped on the road behind them, and unable {{to get back to}} warn the town earlier. [...] He {{reported}} to Capt. Parker that they were already past [...] "the Rocks," [...] a landmark which meant that they were less than half an hour away. [...] Capt. Parker instantly mustered his company, ordering his drummer, William Diamond, to beat [...] "To Arms," [...] a long roll. The town bell was sounded and <b>alarm</b> <b>guns</b> were fired.|$|R
5000|$|On 2 September the <b>alarm</b> <b>gun</b> {{was fired}} and drums beat the {{citizens}} to their Sections again. The walls of Paris were plastered with recruiting posters whose opening sentence, [...] "To arms, citizens, {{the enemy is}} at our gates!" [...] was taken literally by many readers. In the Assembly, Danton concluded {{the most famous of}} all his speeches: [...] "De l’audace, encore de l’audace, toujours de l’audace, et la France est sauvée!" [...] (Audacity, and yet more audacity, and always audacity, and France will be saved!) Once more the sans-culottes responded and in the next three weeks, 20,000 marched from Paris for the defence of the Revolution.|$|E
50|$|During the War of 1812, it was {{claimed that}} the British {{attacked}} the village on July 11, 1813, but were driven back. In reality, several open boats from the British squadron that dominated the Sound during the war entered the harbor at night without any advance planning because the young midshipman in command of these small boats was curious. That officer, C. Claxton R.N., later described his youthful misadventures years later as editor of The Naval Monitor. Upon landing on the wharf and planning some mischief they heard an <b>alarm</b> <b>gun</b> fired before they could {{set fire to the}} coasting vessel docked there and beat a hasty retreat. There were no injuries, and Claxton and his men made it safely back to HMS Ramillies (1785) anchored off Gardiners Island.|$|E
50|$|The mother {{intercepts}} and destroys {{letters from}} Julien's girlfriend {{and does not}} allow him to see her. He {{is not allowed to}} wear clothing he gets from his grandmother or buys with his own money. She rejects angrily a gift from the boy. She enters the bathroom while he is naked, when he covers his genitals she demands that he exposes them. She asks him to lie to his soccer trainer about why he can't come to a training session, in order that she and the boy can be together. Also she does not tell him about the death of his beloved grandmother until after the funeral. Julien's father is always busy with his work and supports his wife's behavior. Only Julien's elder sister is concerned about the negative effect of the mother's behavior on Julien's well-being, but the parents refuse to listen to her. Nevertheless the mother also sometimes shows some kind of love for Julien: she likes dancing with him in the living room, playing soccer with him, and going together to the swimming pool. She often comes to his school to discuss Julien's progress. However, Julien's school achievements deteriorate. At school the mother tells the teacher that she does not know what the problem is. Julien secretly goes to his girlfriend's party. His parents go the girl's house to take him home. Julien's sister phones him to warn him that they are on their way. Julien hurries back home on his bike. The parents meet him, grab him and put him in the car, leaving his bike on the road. At home Julien is beaten by his mother. He alarms the police and tells that he may commit suicide. Four police officers arrive at the house. Reluctantly the mother lets them talk with him in a separate room. Julien does not fully speak out. The police check his arms and trunk for physical harm but do not see anything. They leave. Julien is punished by the removal of most of his possessions from his room, and by giving him limited access to his room. Julien gets an <b>alarm</b> <b>gun</b> from his schoolmates and threatens his mother with it. However, she is not impressed. Then he threatens her with a small knife, and she dares him to kill her. At last he stabs his mother. A scene already shown in flash-forward {{at the start of the}} film is repeated, in which somebody is taken on a stretcher from the house to an ambulance; now it turns out that it is the mother. A voice-over tells that she survives and does not blame her son.|$|E
60|$|On the 2nd of September these slaughter-houses were as full as {{they could}} hold, and about a hundred ruffians, armed with axes and guns, were sent round to all the jails to do the bloody work. It was a Sunday, {{and some of the}} victims had tried to observe it religiously, though little {{divining}} that, it was to be their last. They first took alarm on perceiving that their jailer had removed his family, and then that he sent up their dinner earlier than usual, and removed all the knives and forks. By and by howls and shouts were heard, and the tocsin was heard, ringing, <b>alarm</b> <b>guns</b> firing, and reports came in to the prisoners of the Abbaye that the populace were breaking into the prisons.|$|R
50|$|On {{the evening}} of 26 February Hydra and Moselle were three leagues west of the Cadiz {{lighthouse}} when they sighted the French squadron, comprising the 40-gun frigates Cornélie, Rhin, Hortense and Hermione, and Furet. Mundy began firing rockets and <b>alarm</b> <b>guns</b> to alert Collingwood, while sailing parallel to the French squadron. Mundy then sent Carden in Moselle to try to locate the British fleet. On the morning of 27 February Moselle reached Collingwood, who despatched three frigates to try to catch the French. In the meantime, Hydra had managed to isolate Furet from her companions, and after a two-hour chase, captured her. The French frigates {{did not come to}} their brig's aid, and after firing a pro forma broadside, Furet surrendered. Furet was armed with eighteen 9-pounder guns, and had a crew of 130 men under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Demay. She was provisioned for a cruise of five months. Under the rules of prize-money, Moselle shared in the proceeds of the capture of Furet.|$|R
5000|$|After Admiral Lord Nelson {{defeated}} the Franco-Spanish fleet {{at the battle}} of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805, four French frigates and the brig Furet took refuge at Cadiz, where they remained into February 1806. To try to lure them out, Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood pulled his ships-of-the-line ten leagues out to sea, leaving only Hydra, under Captain George Mundy, and the brig-sloop [...] in close blockade. On 23 February a strong easterly wind drove the British off their station, which led the French commander, Captain Louis-Charles-Auguste Delamarre de Lamellerie, to seize the opportunity to escape. On the evening of 26 February Hydra and Moselle were three leagues west of the Cadiz lighthouse when they sighted the French vessels. Mundy began firing rockets and <b>alarm</b> <b>guns</b> to alert Collingwood, while sailing parallel to the escaping French squadron. Mundy then sent Carden in Moselle to try to locate the British fleet. On the morning of 27 February Moselle reached Collingwood, who despatched three frigates to try to catch the French.|$|R
6000|$|Fearing {{the enemy}} might take {{advantage}} of this outbreak, Wayne detached a Jersey brigade to Chatham, and ordered the militia to be called out there. Alarm fires were kindled upon the hills; <b>alarm</b> <b>guns</b> boomed from post to post; the country was soon on the alert. Wayne was not [...] "Mad Anthony" [...] on the present occasion. All his measures were taken with judgment and forecast. He sent provisions after the mutineers, lest they should supply their wants from the country people by force. Two officers of rank spurred to Philadelphia, to apprise Congress of the approach of the insurgents, and put it upon its guard. Wayne sent a despatch with news of the outbreak to Washington; he then mounted his horse, and accompanied by Colonels Butler and Stewart, two officers popular with the troops, set off after the mutineers, either to bring them to a halt, or to keep with them, and seek every occasion to exert a favorable influence over them.|$|R
60|$|As Lee {{approached}} Dorchester, Colonel Wade Hampton, {{with his}} cavalry, {{passed to the}} east of that place, to a bridge on Goose Creek, to cut off all communication between the garrison and Monk's Corner. His sudden appearance gave the alarm, the garrison abandoned its post, and when Lee arrived there he found it deserted. He proceeded to secure a number of horses and wagons, and some fixed ammunition, which the garrison had left behind, and to send them off to Hampton. Hampton, kept in suspense by this delay, lost patience. He feared that the alarm would spread through the country, and the dash into the vicinity of Charleston be prevented. Abandoning the bridge at Goose Creek, therefore, he set off with his cavalry, clattered down to the neighborhood of the lines, and threw the city into confusion. The bells rang, <b>alarm</b> <b>guns</b> were fired, the citizens turned out under arms. Hampton captured a patrol of dragoons and a guard, at the Quarter-house; and then retired, carrying off fifty prisoners, several of them officers.|$|R
500|$|The ride of Revere, Dawes, and Prescott {{triggered}} a flexible system of [...] "alarm and muster" [...] {{that had been}} carefully developed months before, {{in reaction to the}} colonists' impotent response to the Powder Alarm. This system was an improved version of an old notification network for use in times of emergency. The colonists had periodically used it {{during the early years of}} Indian wars in the colony, before it fell into disuse in the French and Indian War. In addition to other express riders delivering messages, bells, drums, <b>alarm</b> <b>guns,</b> bonfires and a trumpet were used for rapid communication from town to town, notifying the rebels in dozens of eastern Massachusetts villages that they should muster their militias because over 500 regulars were leaving Boston. [...] This system was so effective that people in towns [...] from Boston were aware of the army's movements while they were still unloading boats in Cambridge. These early warnings played a crucial role in assembling a sufficient number of colonial militia to inflict heavy damage on the British regulars later in the day. Adams and Hancock were eventually moved to safety, first to what is now Burlington and later to Billerica.|$|R
2500|$|The ride of {{the three}} men {{triggered}} a flexible system of [...] "alarm and muster" [...] that had been carefully developed months before, {{in reaction to the}} colonists' impotent response to the Powder Alarm of September 1774. This system was an improved version of an old network of widespread notification and fast deployment of local militia forces in times of emergency. The colonists had periodically used this system {{all the way back to}} the early years of Indian wars in the colony, before it fell into disuse in the French and Indian War. In addition to other express riders delivering messages, bells, drums, <b>alarm</b> <b>guns,</b> bonfires, and a trumpet were used for rapid communication from town to town, notifying the rebels in dozens of eastern Massachusetts villages that they should muster their militias because the regulars in numbers greater than 500 were leaving Boston with possible hostile intentions. This system was so effective that people in towns [...] from Boston were aware of the army's movements while they were still unloading boats in Cambridge. Unlike in the Powder Alarm, the alarm raised by the three riders successfully allowed the militia to confront the British troops in Concord, and then harry them all the way back to Boston.|$|R
60|$|In the {{meantime}} Knyphausen was pressing {{on with his}} main force towards Morristown. The booming of <b>alarm</b> <b>guns</b> had roused the country; every valley was pouring out its yeomanry. Two thousand {{were said to be}} already in arms below the mountains. Within half a mile of Springfield, Knyphausen halted to reconnoitre. That village, through which passes the road to Springfield, had been made the American rallying-point. It stands at the foot of what are called the Short Hills, {{on the west side of}} Rahway River, which runs in front of it. On the bank of the river, General Maxwell's Jersey brigade and the militia of the neighborhood were drawn up to dispute the passage. Washington had arrived and taken his position that afternoon, prepared to withstand an encounter though not to seek one. All night his camp fires lighted up the Short Hills, and he remained on the alert expecting to be assailed in the morning; but in the morning no enemy was to be seen. Knyphausen had experienced enough to convince him that he had been completely misinformed as to the disposition of the Jersey people and of the army. Disappointed as to the main objects of his enterprise, he had retreated under cover of the night.|$|R
50|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Trafalgar, four French frigates and the brig Furet took refuge at Cadiz, where they remained into February 1806.

During the next six months, Lamellerie's frigate squadron cruised the Atlantic, visiting Senegal, Cayenne and the West Indies, but failed significantly to disrupt British trade.|$|R
60|$|On the 18th of August, Lee {{set out on}} the expedition, at {{the head}} of three hundred men of Lord Stirling's division, and a troop of {{dismounted}} dragoons under Captain McLane. It was between two and three in the morning {{when he arrived at the}} creek. It happened, fortunately, that Major Sutherland, the British commander, had the day before detached a foraging party under a Major Buskirk to a part of the country called the English Neighborhood. As Lee and his men approached they were mistaken by the sentinel for this party on its return. The darkness of the night favored the mistake. They passed the creek and ditch, entered the works unmolested, and had made themselves masters of the post before the negligent garrison were well roused from sleep. Major Sutherland and about sixty Hessians threw themselves into a small block-house on the left of the fort and opened an irregular fire. To attempt to dislodge them would have cost too much time. <b>Alarm</b> <b>guns</b> from the ships in the river and the forts at New York threatened speedy reinforcements to the enemy. Having made one hundred and fifty-nine prisoners, among whom were three officers, Lee commenced his retreat, without tarrying to destroy either barracks or artillery. Few of the enemy were slain, for there was but little fighting and no massacre. His own loss was two men killed and three wounded.|$|R
6000|$|He bade me {{fetch the}} {{portfolio}} he carried, and with numbed fingers wrote the letter while his captains stared in admiration and amazement. What a stroke was this! There were six hundred {{men in the}} town and fort,--soldiers, inhabitants, and Indians,--while we had but 170, starved and weakened by their incredible march. But Clark {{was not to be}} daunted. Whipping out his field-glasses, he took a stand on a little mound under the trees and followed the fast-galloping messenger across the plain; saw him enter the town; saw the stir in the streets, knots of men riding out and gazing, hands on foreheads, towards the place where we were. But, as the minutes rolled into hours, there was no further <b>alarm.</b> No <b>gun,</b> no beat to quarters or bugle-call from Fort Sackville. What could it mean? ...|$|R
50|$|On 10 February, Von Steuben stood {{down the}} Delaware River with another convoy. She reached her destination, Brest, without {{incident}} on 24 February, unloaded her troops and cargo, {{and set out}} on the return voyage five days later. At about 16:20 on 5 March, a lookout spotted an object to port which resembled a submarine periscope. The <b>alarm</b> brought <b>gun</b> crews scurrying to their action stations, and they opened fire immediately. Before anyone realized that they were firing upon an innocuous piece of flotsam, a tragic accident occurred. The shell from one of her 5-inch guns exploded immediately upon leaving the barrel, and fragments struck three sailors. One died instantly, and the other two succumbed to their wounds later that night. Von Steuben coaled at Bermuda on 12-13 March and arrived at Norfolk on 16 March. After repairs and coaling, she moved on to Philadelphia to load troops and cargo for her third voyage to France.|$|R
5000|$|Arnold {{had long}} promised to visit New London and the {{neighbouring}} towns {{on the sea}} shore, and the enemy having frequently appeared in sight of the harbour, the <b>alarm</b> <b>guns</b> fired on the present occasion were considered by the country around us the salutes of prizes or other vessels belonging to the port. He however arrived the 6th inst. about five o, and at seven o’ landed about 2500 men, half {{on each side of}} the river. At 8 o’ the militia mustered in parties of 8 or 10, and annoyed the enemy until about 100 of them came up and disputed their way to Fort Trumbull; their great superiority obliged our people to yield to them the possession of the fort. Col. Ledyard, with about 76 other brave fellows, retreated to the fort on Groton side, which they determined resolutely to defend. The next assault was upon this fort, where they were repulsed several times by a bravery unequalled, for about three hours. A flag was then sent, demanding a surrender of the fort, accompanies by a threat of giving no quarters in case of refusal. The commandant consulted with his brave garrison, who refused to submit. The action was then renewed, when the flag staff was unfortunately shot away; notwithstanding which the defence was gallantly continued until about five or six hundred of the enemy having forced the pickets had entered through the breach. At this time there were but four of the garrison killed, and it was thought prudent to submit, to preserve the lives of the remainder. The officer who at this time commanded the assailants, (Major Montgomery being killed) enquired who commanded the garrison? Colonel Ledyard informed him that he had had that honour, but was unfortunate in being obliged to surrender it, at the same time delivered up to him his sword, and asked for quarter for himself and people; to which the infamous villain replied, [...] "ye rascals, I give you quarters," [...] and then plunged the sword into his body. The inhuman banditti, taking this as a signal, drove their bayonets up to the muzzles of their pieces into the breasts of all that were taken, except one or two who made their escape.|$|R

5000|$|The Tsar {{is dressed}} in a summer suit and {{accompanied}} only by an equerry. He wants an informal portrait rather than an official one. He is attracted by the False Angèle and asks to be left alone with her. She is keen to take the photograph (i.e. to [...] "shoot" [...] him), but he flirts with her and offers to take her photograph first. She manages to avoid being accidentally shot by the Tsar, and is finally about to press the bulb to shoot him when the equerry re-appears to report that the police have followed some assassins to the studio. The false Angèle, realising that the game is up, puts on a seductive gramophone record (the [...] "Tango Angèle") and asks the Tsar to avert his eyes while she undresses. She {{and the rest of the}} gang escape through the window just before the police arrive with the real Angèle and her assistants, who had previously themselves escaped and raised the <b>alarm.</b> The <b>gun</b> is removed from the camera, and the Tsar, though dismayed that the real Angèle is not as attractive as the false one, finally, as the chorus again says, [...] "has his photograph taken".|$|R

6000|$|The scenery, {{with its}} accompaniments, was most {{beautiful}} and interesting. The river, a narrow one, flowed through a dense and continuous forest; rich and lofty trees over-arched it, affording agreeable shade, {{and on the}} branches were to be seen great numbers of kingfishers, parrots, and other birds of rich plumage, which filled the air at least with sound, if not with melody. The concert was further swelled by the constant cries of wild beasts--such as the howl of a tiger or the scream of a monkey. But there is no pleasure without some alloy. On this river mosquitoes were the alloy! These tormenting creatures persecuted the hunters by night {{as well as by}} day, for they are amongst the few insects which indulge in the pernicious habit of never going to bed. We cannot indeed say, authoritatively, that mosquitoes never sleep, but we can and do say that they torment human beings, and rob them of their sleep, if possible, without intermission.
