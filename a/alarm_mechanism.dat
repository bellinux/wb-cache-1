5000|$|Both {{the form}} and the {{respective}} patented movement (in 1818) were invented by the clockmaker and this timekeeper was devised to offer an <b>alarm</b> <b>mechanism</b> in a high-style shelf clock. Originally known as the [...] "Patent Alarm Timepiece", S.

The design of the cases {{were based on the}} classical art then in vogue; Neoclassicism and Empire. Some of these clocks, however, are less formal and reflect the vernacular interest in painted furniture, particularly Windsor chairs. Therefore, the wood cases are quite varied in design, quality and workmanship, and they could be paint and stencil decorated or mahogany with decorative ormolu brass mounts.

Or, {{they might have been}} influenced by English and French skeletonized clocks as well; that is, clocks whose plates have been cut and exposed {{in such a way as}} to show the internal workings of the clock. Willard's clockworks were not skeletonized, but the mechanism was visible too. The alarm bell was mounted atop the clock brass movement. Clock mechanisms are driven by a weight concealed in the body of the lighthouse, though the <b>alarm</b> <b>mechanism</b> is sometimes driven by a separate weight raised by a pullcord. Regarding the movement, it is an 8-day weight driven, pendulum regulated clock and, as well as the cases, there were a considerable variety of mechanisms in terms of workmanship and design. Clocks with similar cases have significant differences in their movements, this could indicate there were many different makers or that some works were being imported from Europe. About the dial, period lighthouse clocks either had porcelain dials with brass backs or painted iron dials, bearing the inscription; [...] "Simon Willard" [...] or [...] "Willard Patent" [...] or [...] "Simon Willard's Patten" [...] or [...] "Simon Willard and Son's Pattent"; others have signed cases or tags with similar wording.

40|$|SummaryEpithelial tissues {{facing the}} {{external}} environment are essential to combating microbial infection. In addition to providing a physical barrier, epithelial tissues mount chemical defenses to prevent invasion of internal tissues by pathogens. Here, we describe that the melanization reaction implicated in host defense is activated in the respiratory system, the trachea, of Drosophila. Tracheal melanization can be activated {{by the presence of}} microorganisms but is normally blocked by Spn 77 Ba, a protease inhibitor in the serpin family. Spn 77 Ba inhibits a protease cascade involving the MP 1 and MP 2 proteases that activates phenol oxidase, a key enzyme in melanin biosynthesis. Unexpectedly, we found that tracheal melanization resulting from Spn 77 Ba disruption induces systemic expression of the antifungal peptide Drosomycin via the Toll pathway. Such signaling between local and systemic immune responses could represent an <b>alarm</b> <b>mechanism</b> that prepares the host in case a pathogen breaches epithelial defenses to invade internal tissues...|$|E

In this paper, we present an improved CoAP scheme based on 6 LoWPAN (IPv 6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Network) networks. The existing CoAP proxy mechanism requires a large cache space in proxy endpoints and is not optimized for large sensor networks. An enhanced proxy and cache mechanism of CoAP is designed to address this issue. The proposed mechanism uses query mode of discovery and significantly reduces the energy consumption and cache space usage. The cache is a two-dimensional array that stores resource information and identifiers with same structure at each line. Moreover, considering the alarm service widely used in the sensor networks, we also add a simple alarm method in CoAP to support the transmission of alarm information.

40|$|Our immune defense {{depends on}} two {{specialized}} armed forces. The innate force {{acts as an}} <b>alarm</b> <b>mechanism</b> that senses changes in the microenvironment through the recognition of common microbial patterns by Toll-like receptors (TLR) and NOD proteins.

The innate arm also communicates this message with more specialized adaptive forces represented by pathogen-specific B cells and T cells. Interestingly, B cells also express some innate sensors, like TLR 7 and TLR 9, and may respond to bacterial hypomethylated CpG motifs and single-stranded RNA viruses.

Despite the completion of numerous experimental studies on RAR, the underlying mechanism has remained unclear. In this study, we aimed to have a comprehensive investigation on the RAR induced in the AG 01522 human fibroblasts first exposed to 5 cGy (priming dose) and then followed by 2 Gy (challenge dose) of X-ray through comparisons to those cells that had only received a single 2 Gy dose. We studied how the priming dose affected the expression of gene transcripts, and to identify transcripts or pathways that {{were associated with the}} reduced chromosomal damages (in {{terms of the number of}} micronuclei) after application of the challenging dose. Through the mRNA and microRNA microarray analyses, the transcriptome alteration in AG 01522 cells was examined, and the significantly altered genes were identified for different irradiation procedures using bioinformatics approaches. We observed that a low-dose X-ray exposure produced an alert, triggering and altering cellular responses to defend against subsequent high dose-induced damages, and accelerating the cell repair process. Moreover, the p 53 signaling pathway was found to play critial roles in regulating DNA damage responses at the early stage after application of the challenging dose, particularly in the RAR group.

The different risk factors have fostered the development of stand-alone devices facilitating early detection of falls. We aimed at assessing performance of the Vigi’Fall® system, a cutting edge fall detector associating a “passive release” mechanism attached to the patient and including external sensors; {{in the event of a}} fall, the system automatically triggers an alarm, and it also incorporates embedded confirmation software. We have put it to the test under real-life conditions so as to evaluate not only its efficacy, but also and more particularly its acceptability and tolerability in elderly subjects. MethodThe study ran from March 2007 through December 2008 in a geriatric ward with 10 subjects over 75 years of age, all of whom presented with a risk of falling. ResultsFor eight patients wearing an accelerometric sensor, eight “falling” events and 30 “alarm release” events were recorded. Sensitivity and specificity of the device came to 62. 5 and 99. 5 % respectively. For the two patients wearing the complete device, no events were detected. Not a single adverse occurrence was noted. Local tolerance was excellent in all but one of the subjects. ConclusionOur results clearly show that the device may be worn by patients without discomfort over prolonged periods of time, and also demonstrate that the verification component will help to increase sensitivity in real-life conditions to a level comparable to the level attained in our laboratory studies...|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} chapters {{we considered}} combinational circuits where {{the value of}} each output depends solely on the values of signals applied to the inputs. There exists another class of logic circuits in which {{the values of the}} outputs depend not only on the present values of the inputs but also on the past behavior of the circuit. Such circuits include storage elements that store the values of logic signals. The contents of the storage elements are said to represent the state of the circuit. When the circuit’s inputs change values, the new input values either leave the circuit in the same state or cause it to change into a new state. Over time the circuit changes through a sequence of states as a result of changes in the inputs. Circuits that behave in this way are referred to as sequential circuits. In this chapter we will introduce circuits that can be used as storage elements. But first, we will motivate the need for such circuits by means of a simple example.

40|$|Thousands of {{radiation}} portal monitors {{have been deployed}} worldwide to detect and deter the smuggling of nuclear and radiological materials {{that could be used}} in nefarious acts. Radiation portal monitors are often installed at bottlenecks where large amounts of people or goods must traverse. Examples of use include scanning cargo containers at shipping ports, vehicles at border crossings, and people at high profile functions and events. 	Traditional radiation portal monitors contain separate detectors for passively measuring neutron and gamma ray count rates. 3 He tubes embedded in polyethylene and slabs of plastic scintillators are the most common detector materials used in radiation portal monitors. The radiation portal monitor <b>alarm</b> <b>mechanism</b> relies on measuring radiation count rates above user defined alarm thresholds. These alarm thresholds are set above natural background count rates. Minimizing false alarms caused by natural background and maximizing sensitivity to weakly emitting threat sources must be balanced when setting these alarm thresholds. 	Current radiation portal monitor designs suffer from frequent nuisance radiation alarms. These radiation nuisance alarms are most frequently caused by shipments of large quantities of naturally occurring radioactive material containing cargo, like kitty litter, as well as by humans who have recently undergone a nuclear medicine procedure, particularly 99 mTc treatments. Current radiation portal monitors typically lack spectroscopic capabilities, so nuisance alarms must be screened out in time-intensive secondary inspections with handheld radiation detectors. 	Radiation portal monitors using organic liquid scintillation detectors were designed, built, and tested. A number of algorithms were developed to perform on-the-fly radionuclide identification of single and combination radiation sources moving past the portal monitor at speeds up to 2. 2 m/s.
