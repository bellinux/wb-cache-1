Multicopper oxidase (MCO) is a family of enzymes including laccases, ferroxidases and <b>ascorbate</b> <b>oxidases</b> which are able to catalyze the oxidation of various aromatic organic compounds with the reduction of molecular oxygen to water.

Although the activity of laccase enzymes has previously been reported in many wood-rotting fungi, the diversity of laccase genes in Fonsecaea has not yet been assessed. In this study, we identified and characterized laccase-coding genes and determined their genomic location in five clinical and environmental Fonsecaea species.

50|$|Hephaestin is {{a member}} of the family of copper oxidases that {{includes}} mammalian ceruloplasmin, yeast fet3 and fet5, and bacterial <b>ascorbate</b> <b>oxidase,</b> among others. While hephaestin shares 50% amino acid sequence identity with its serum homologue ceruloplasmin, the hephaestin protein includes an additional 86 amino acids at the C-terminus, which code for a single transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic tail. While the structure and kinetic activity of ceruloplasmin have been studied extensively, hephaestin has yet to be investigated at a similar level. Comparative models of hephaestin's structure have been created using established crystallographic data from ceruloplasmin, and these studies suggest that many of the structural features important in the enzymatic function of the latter are also conserved in the former. In particular, these shared features include cysteine residues involved in disulfide bond formation, histidine residues involved in copper binding, and residues involved in the binding of the iron substrate.|$|E

His {{certificate}} of election reads: [...] Huber has built up, led and still leads the most productive protein crystallography laboratory in Europe. His own contributions to crystallography, made over a period of some 25 years, are prodigious. For his PhD thesis he solved the chemical formula of the important insect hormone edtyson which had eluded the chemists. He then demonstrated that the tertiary fold of the polypeptide chain in the haemoglobin of the fly larva chironomus closely resembled that in Kendrew's sperm whale myoglobin, indicating {{for the first time that}} this fold had been preserved throughout evolution.Huber's next achievement was the solution of the structure of trypsin inhibitor and the demonstration that in its complex with trypsin it mimicked the tetrahedral transition state of the enzyme's substrate. Since then he has determined the structures of many other proteinases, their inactive precursors and their inhibitors, and has established himself as the world authority in this field. Outstanding structures are those of procarboxypeptidase, which led to the discovery of the remarkable activation mechanism of this enzyme, and of the complex of thrombin with hirudin, which showed the molecular mechanism of inhibition of blood clotting by this leech toxin.In parallel with this work, Huber solved the structures of several immunoglobulin fragments. He was the first to determine the structure of the complement-activating F-fragment, which was also the first variable and the first constant domains in Fab-fragments.Huber's structure of citrate synthase revealed a striking example of a conformational change undergone by an enzyme on combination with its substrate by a process of induced fit.Huber shared the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1988 with Michel and Deisenhofer for their determination of the remarkable and supremely important structures of the photochemical reaction centre of Rhodopseudomonas viridis and of phycocyanin, the light harvesting protein of the blue-green alga Mastiglocadus laminosus. This protein binds linear tetrapyrroles in a tertiary fold reminiscent of the globins, which brought Huber back full circle to his first structure, erythrocruerin,Huber has also determined the structures of several copper-containing electron-transfer proteins, including that of <b>ascorbate</b> <b>oxidase,</b> and of other metallo-enzymes. These studies have thrown new light on electron-transfer systems and on zinc coordination in proteins. He has also solved the structure of an important class of calcium binding proteins - the annexins.

The specific activity and mRNA of <b>ascorbate</b> <b>oxidase</b> markedly increased after inoculation of pumpkin fruit tissues into Murashige and Skoog's culture medium in the presence of an auxin such as 2, 4 -dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2, 4 -D) but not in the absence of 2, 4 -D. In the presence of 10 mg/L of 2, 4 -D, <b>ascorbate</b> <b>oxidase</b> mRNA was the most abundant. Thus, <b>ascorbate</b> <b>oxidase</b> is induced by 2, 4 -D. These results indicate that <b>ascorbate</b> <b>oxidase</b> is involved in cell growth. In pumpkin callus, <b>ascorbate</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity could be markedly increased by adding copper.

40|$|Laccase {{is one of}} the few {{enzymes that}} have been the subject of study since the end of the last century. The enzyme is a type of copper-containing {{polyphenol}} oxidase that was discovered in the exudates of the Japanese lacquer tree Rhus verniczfera (Yoshida, 1883) and subsequently was demonstrated as a fungal enzyme as well (Bertrand, 1896; Laborde, 1896). At present, there is only one bacterium, A~ospirillum lipoferum, in which a laccasetype phenol oxidase has been demonstrated (Givaudan et al., 1993). Laccase is one of a small group of enzymes called the large blue copper proteins or blue copper oxidases. The other members of this group are the plant <b>ascorbate</b> <b>oxidases</b> and the mammalian plasma protein ceruloplasmin. It has very recently been shown, in addition, that phenoxazinone synthase from Streptomjces antibioticus has several features in common with the blue oxidases (Freeman et a/., 1993). The blue oxidases have been intensively studied not least because they share with the terminal oxidases of aerobic respiration the ability to reduce molecular oxygen to water. It is therefore paradoxical that our knowledge of these proteins is so incomplete. An attempt to tease apart what we do and do not know about the fungal laccases is the subject of this short, and selective, review.

Photoinactivation was always greater in non-pigmented than in pigmented membranes. 20 minutes' illumination caused reversible inactivation, while 60 minutes' illumination caused irreversible photoinactivation of malate oxidase activity in the non-pigraented membranes. 5 minutes' illumination at high light intensity, without exogenous photosensitizer, caused reversible photoinactivation of malate and succinate oxidases and malate s DCPIP and succinate : DCPIP reductions in pigmented membranes. Non-pigmented membranes showed irreversible photoinactivation of these enzyme activities. Photoinactivation of malate : vitamin K reductase was reversible in all membranes. 15 minutes illumination irreversibly photoinactivated malate and succinate oxidases, but reversibly photoinactivated malate and succinate : DCPIP reductions in the pigmented membranes. Non-oigmented membranes showed irreversible photoinactivation of these enzyme activities. Malate and succinate : vitamin K reductases of both strains showed reversible photoinactivation. 25 minutes illumination with ultraviolet-filtered light showed no photoinactivation of PMS or methylene blue reductions, but showed reversible photoinactivation of malate oxidase activity in the pigmented strain and irreversible photoinactivation in non-pigmented cells and membranes. There was irreversible photo-inactivation of raalate : DCPIP reduction in both strains. Permanent photoinactivation of NADH oxidase activity was observed in pigmented membranes, while NADH : DCPIP reduction showed no photoinactivation. Malate : vitamin K reductase activity in both strains showed reversible photoinoxtivation. The malate oxidase and malate : vitamin K redactase activities of two other non-pignented mutants showod identical properties.

40|$|Arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} (AM) fungi establish beneficial symbioses {{with the}} roots of the majority of land plants, including the most important food crops, from cereals to legumes, vegetables and fruit trees. AM fungi are the essential elements of soil fertility, plant nutrition and productivity, facilitating soil mineral nutrient uptake by means of an extensive extra-radical network of fungal hyphae spreading from colonized roots into the soil. Sunflower (Helianthus annuus) is a non-model, widely cultivated species whose mycorrhizal status was recently assessed in wild accessions, cultivars and inbred lines 1. Although previous transcriptome analyses on sunflower showed gene differential expression in response to biotic/abiotic stresses 2, no data are available on molecular changes induced by AM fungi. In this work we used an RNA-seq approach in order to evaluate gene expression variations at early and late stages of mycorrhizal establishment in sunflower roots colonized by the arbuscular fungus Rhizoglomus irregulare. Sunflower plantlets (inbred HA 412 -HO) were inoculated with the fungus and total RNA was isolated from roots 4 and 16 days since inoculation, then twelve cDNA libraries were built and sequenced by Illumina technology. A de novo transcriptome was established by assembling Illumina cDNA reads. This transcriptome and a recently released predicted transcriptome of sunflower (inbred XRQ) 3 were used as reference for quantitative analysis of gene expression. Overall 726 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between mycorrhizal and control plants were identified. The number of over-expressed DEGs was much higher than under-expressed ones and this difference increased in the late stage of colonization. Gene Ontology analyses showed that several DEGs were specifically involved in known mycorrhizal processes, such as membrane transport (ABC transporters, ammonium transporters), cell wall shaping (subtilisins, <b>ascorbate</b> <b>oxidases),</b> gene networking (DELLA, ERF) and defense response (germin-like protein, vinorine synthases). We also identified new mycorrhizal-induced putative transcripts, such as genes belonging to the BAHD-acyltransferase superfamily, involved in endogenous formation of specialized monoterpenoid. Our data add a valuable contribution for deciphering gene expression related to beneficial fungi and plant symbiosis, adding a new non-model species for future comparative functional genomics analyses...|$|R

Previous sunflower transcriptome analyses revealed gene differ-ential expression in response to biotic/abiotic stresses 2, while no data are available on changes induced by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. Here, for the first time, an RNAseq approach was used to investigate transcriptional changes in mycorrhizal versus nonmycorrhi-zal sunflower roots and gene differential expression at early and late stages of mycorrhizal establishment. Sunflower plantlets were inoculated with the AM symbiont Rhizoglomus irregulare and total RNA was isolated from roots 4 and 16 days after inoculation. Twelve cDNA libraries were built and sequenced by Illumina technology. A de novo transcriptome was established by assem-bling Illumina reads and annotating contigs. After quantitative analyses by mapping reads against the de novo assembled transcriptome 1, 037 differentially expressed putative tran-scripts (DEs) between mycorrhizal and control plants were identified. The number of over-expressed DEs was much higher than under-expressed ones, increasing over time. Gene On-tology analyses showed that several DEs were specifically involved in known mycorrhizal pro-cesses, such as membrane transport (ABC transporters, ammonium transporters), cell wall shaping (subtilisins, <b>ascorbate</b> <b>oxidases),</b> gene networking (DELLA, ERF) and defense response (germin-like protein, pathogen-related proteins).

The aim was to ascertain whether these enzymatic systems may regulate directly (in the case of APXs), or indirectly (in the case of AAOs), apoplastic H 2 O 2 levels in lignifying tissues, whose capacity to produce and to accumulate H 2 O 2 is demonstrated here. Although class I APXs are particularly found in the apoplastic fraction of P. alba (poplar), and class III APXs are particularly found in the apoplastic fraction of C. aurantium (bitter orange tree), {{the results showed that}} the universal presence of AAO in the extracellular cell wall matrix of these woody species provokes the partial or total dysfunction of apoplastic class I and class III APXs, and of the whole plethora of non-enzymatic redox shuttles in which ascorbic acid (ASC) is involved, by the competitive and effective removal of ASC. In fact, the redox state (ASC/ASC+DHA) in intercellular wash fluids (IWFs) of these woody species was zero, and thus strongly shifted towards DHA (dehydroascorbate), the oxidized product of ASC. This imbalance of the apoplastic antioxidant enzymatic system apparently results in the accumulation of H 2 O 2 in the apoplast of secondary wood-forming tissues, as can be experimentally observed. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that since AAO uses O 2 to remove ASC, it could regulate O 2 availability in the lignifying xylem and, thorough this mechanism, AAO could also control the activity of NADPH oxidase (the enzyme responsible for H 2 O 2 production in lignifying tissues) at substrate level, by controlling the tension of O 2. That is, the presence of AAO in the extracellular cell wall matrix appears to be essential for finely tuning the oxidative performance of secondary wood-forming tissues.

Immunological blotting method showed that mol wt of <b>ascorbate</b> <b>oxidase</b> subunit in pumpkin callus was the same as that of the purified preparation. Analysis with the single radial immunodiffusion method showed that the increase in <b>ascorbate</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity during the growth of pumpkin callus correlated with an increase in the enzyme protein. Furthermore, enzyme protein in the callus grown in the presence of 10 micromolar CuSO 4 for 2 weeks was about eight times that grown in the presence of 0. 1 micromolar CuSO 4. The synthesis of <b>ascorbate</b> <b>oxidase</b> in pumpkin callus may be induced by copper, a prosthetic metal of the enzyme, or copper may help stabilize the enzyme against proteolytic breakdown...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of one-electron reduced metronidazole (ArNO 2. -) with native and Type- 2 -copper-depleted <b>ascorbate</b> <b>oxidase</b> were studied in buffered aqueous solution at pH 6. 0 and 7. 4 {{by using the}} technique of pulse radiolysis. With ArNO 2. -, reduction of Type 1 copper of the native enzyme and of the Type- 2 -copper-depleted <b>ascorbate</b> <b>oxidase</b> occurs via a bimolecular step {{and at the same}} rate. Whereas the native protein accepts, in the absence of O 2, 6 - 7 reducing equivalents, Type- 2 -copper-depleted <b>ascorbate</b> <b>oxidase</b> accepts only 3 reducing equivalents with stoichiometric reduction of Type 1 copper. On reaction of O 2. - with <b>ascorbate</b> <b>oxidase</b> under conditions of [O 2. -] much greater than [ascorbate oxidase], removal of Type 2 copper results in reduction of all the Type 1 copper atoms, in contrast with reduction of the equivalent of only one Type 1 copper atom in the holoprotein. From observations at 610 nm, the rate of reduction of <b>ascorbate</b> <b>oxidase</b> by O 2. - is not dependent on the presence of Type 2 copper. For the holoprotein, no significant optical-absorption changes were observed at 330 nm. It is proposed that electrons enter the protein via Type 1 copper in a rate-determining step followed by a fast intramolecular transfer of electrons within the protein. For the Type- 2 -copper-depleted protein, intramolecular transfer within the protein, however, is slow or does not occur. In the presence of O 2, it is also suggested that re-oxidation of the partially reduced holoprotein occurs at steady state, as inferred from the observations at 330 nm and 610 nm. The role of Type 2 copper in <b>ascorbate</b> <b>oxidase</b> is discussed in terms of its involvement in redistribution of electrons within the protein or structural considerations...|$|E

Enzyme activities of peroxidase, polyphenol <b>oxidase,</b> <b>ascorbate</b> peroxidase, catalase and glutathione reductase were measured. The plants were grown in pots vermiculite. Before applying the salicylic acid treatments, plants filled with were irrigated with based nutrient solution (Hoagland solution) for 5 weeks. After 5 weeks, plants were sprayed with different concentrations (0, 0. 1, 1. 5, 3, 6 and 9 mM) of salicylic acid. Data were analyzed using SPSS software and means were compared by Duncan test. In each experiment 4 replicats were used. Concentrations of 1. 5, 3, 6 and 9 mM of SA caused significant increase in polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase enzyme activities in treated leaves. Concentrations of 0. 7, 1. 5 ad 3 mM of SA decreased in (catalase, ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase) activities, but concentrations of 6 and 9 Mm of SA increased enzyme activities. Different concentrations of salicylic acid had different effects on enzyme activities in Capsicum annuum L...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Although donor {{dopamine}} treatment {{reduces the}} requirement for post transplantation dialysis in renal transplant recipients, implementation of dopamine in donor management is hampered by its hemodynamic side-effects. Therefore novel dopamine derivatives lacking any hemodynamic actions and yet are more efficacious in protecting tissue from cold preservation injury are warranted. We hypothesized that variation of the molecular structure would yield more efficacious compounds avoid of any hemodynamic effects. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To this end, we assessed protection against cold preservation injury in HUVEC by the attenuation of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Modification of dopamine by an alkanoyl group increased cellular uptake and significantly improved efficacy of protection. Further variation revealed that only compounds bearing two hydroxy groups in ortho or para position at the benzene nucleus, i. e. strong reductants, were protective. However, other reducing agents like N-acetyl cysteine and <b>ascorbate,</b> or NADPH <b>oxidase</b> inhibition did not prevent cellular injury following cold storage. Unlike dopamine, a prototypic novel compound caused no hemodynamic side-effects. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In conclusion, we demonstrate that protection against cold preservation injury by catecholamines is exclusively governed by strong reducing capacity and sufficient lipophilicity. The novel dopamine derivatives might be of clinical relevance in donor pre-conditioning as they are completely devoid of hemodynamic action, their increased cellular uptake would reduce time of treatment and therefore also may have a potential use for non-heart beating donors...|$|R

In the g region of the spectrum of bleached <b>ascorbate</b> <b>oxidase,</b> a seven-line superhyperfine pattern is seen that is attributed {{to the presence of}} three nitrogen-donor ligands to a type 2 copper having tetragonal geometry. The superhyperfine splitting patterns in the g|| region of the EPR spectra of native and bleached <b>ascorbate</b> <b>oxidase</b> show that as many as two fluorides may bind to type 2 copper. Because fluoride inhibits the enzyme competitively with respect to ascorbic acid, it is proposed that the type 2 copper is part of the ascorbate binding site...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ascorbate</b> <b>oxidase</b> {{activity}} and ascorbic acid content were followed {{during the development}} of muskmelon {Cucumis melo L. var. reticulatus) fruits. The enzyme was highly expressed in ovaries and very young fruit tissues, followed by a decrease in 10 - and 20 -d-old fruits {{and an increase in}} 30 - and 35 -d-old fruits which coincided with early events of fruit ripening. Ascorbic acid content was negatively correlated with <b>ascorbate</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity. The enzyme was purified to homogen-eity following ion exchange, affinity and gel filtration chromatographic trials. The purified enzyme was a glycoprotein of molecular weight 137 000 composed of two subunits of molecular weight 68000, and formed by six isoenzymes with isoelectric points in the range of pH 7. 7 to 8. 3. Its electron paramagnetic res-onance and optical spectra were in agreement with other copper proteins and the enzyme contained eight copper atoms per dimeric molecule. The Km of the enzyme for ascorbic acid was 50 pM. Ascorbate oxid-ase activity was inhibited by azide and by EDTA, two inhibitors of copper proteins. Optimal conditions for enzyme activity was pH 5. 5, and a temperature of 37 °C. Polyclonal antibodies were produced against the purified protein and immunoprecipitated <b>ascorbate</b> <b>oxidase</b> activity.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} the optical {{features of the}} redox metal-dependent proteins cytochrome-c, horseradish peroxidase (HRP), and <b>ascorbate</b> <b>oxidase</b> embedded in a sol-gel-processed silica matrix {{as a function of}} gelation time. Circular dichroism, absorbance, and fluorescence spectroscopies revealed that the sol-gel process affects the complex structure of the dimeric <b>ascorbate</b> <b>oxidase</b> (although the prosthetic coppers still remain bound to the enzyme) but not that of monomeric cytochrome-e and HRP. Any modifications in <b>ascorbate</b> <b>oxidase</b> occurred in the initial gelation phase; the drying process induced no further alterations and the enzyme remained stable for months. Unfolding-refolding experiments on cytochrome-e revealed severely restricted motility in the protein moiety in the xerogel, the concentrated matrix that forms after drying. The diffusion time of the solvent within the matrix, which regulated the enzyme-substrate reaction rate, depended on the thickness of the monolith, not on the dryness of the specimen...|$|E
40|$|Colletotrichum coccodes strain DAOM 183088 is {{considered}} a potential bioherbicide for velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti), a devastating weed in North American corn and soybeans. Risk assessment studies have created a demand for an accurate and robust method to monitor this strain, and to distinguish it from indigenous background population of microorganisms present in the field. Safe biological control management of velvetleaf also requires comprehensive understanding of the pathogenicity determinants employed by this host-specific fungus to establish infection on velvetleaf, an aspect central to a safe biocontrol strategy task. In this study, molecular markers were designed that allow strain specific identification of the bioherbicide strain of C. coccodes and its identification within complex plant and soil matrices. An assay was developed to quantify C. coccodes from deliberate release field soil samples, in which biases caused by soil-originating PCR inhibitors were monitored on a sample per sample basis. The developed external control assay allowed for the estimation of target C. coccodes DNA quantities with normalization {{for the presence of}} PCR inhibitory compounds. Kinetic growth curves of disease development were performed for C. coccodes wild-type and T 20 -a (genetically engineered for hypervirulence with the NEP 1 (necrosis and ethylene inducing peptide) gene) strains on velvetleaf leaves over a period of 14 days after C. coccodes infection. The wild-type strain was more efficient at infecting velvetleaf than the transgenic T- 20 a strain, while expression of NEP 1 could not be detected suggesting that the introduced gene may not be transcriptionally active in the transformed strain, a result in conflict with previous observations. Velvetleaf and C. coccodes genes specifically upregulated at 12 and 24 h after fungal infection were cloned and differentially screened by microarrays. The resulting EST collection was sequenced and assigned to putative functions. Early gene up-regulation was confirmed by QRT-PCR analysis for type 3 metal lothionein, EREB, WRKY, and bZIP transcription factors, reticuline <b>oxidase,</b> <b>ascorbate</b> peroxidase, and ACC oxidase gene candidates. In addition, type 2, type 3 metallothionein, and bZIP gene expression profiles were investigated over a period of 14 days after C. coccodes infection, and the results indicated that C. coccodes altered the expression of all three gene analyzed...|$|R
40|$|Biocontrol using {{plant growth}} {{promoting}} rhizobacteria is an eco-friendly, sustainable alternative to chemical pesticides. The present investigation was aimed (i) to isolate and characterize the indigenous antagonistic rhizobacteria which inhibit the infection and proliferation of Fusarium moniliforme, the casual organism for stalk rot, (ii) {{to evaluate their}} potential as bio-inoculant in pot experiment under axenic condition as well as under natural conditions of field (iii) to determine the mechanism of action of the PGPR with particular emphasis on antibiotic production. In the first experiment, characterization of 117 rhizobacteria, isolated from the rhizosphere of non-infected and stalk rot infected maize plants grown from Jhang, Yousafwalla and Islamabad territory, were made. The antifungal potential of the PGPR were determined against Fusarium moniliforme, Helminthosporium sativum and Aspergillus flavus. Out of 117 rhizobacteria, 50 rhizobacteria have shown the potential to inhibit the growth of F. moniliforme, Helminthosporium sativum and Aspergillus flavus. These rhizobacteria were further tested {{for the production of}} siderophores, antimicrobial secondary metabolites (antibiotics and HCN), production of hydrolytic enzymes (chitinases, proteases, cellulases) and phytohormone production (IAA). On the basis of their efficacy, 18 rhizobacteria were selected as potent biocontrol agent. These selected rhizobacteria were also used as bio-inoculant on maize in an experiment conducted under axenic conditions. Out of these, six rhizobacteria codes as 4 nm, NDY, JYR, PTWz, Y 5 and Yio have shown higher survival efficiency in soil and significantly improved the growth of maize seedlings. These rhizobacteria were identified by 16 S rRNA gene sequencing and two antagonistic rhizobacteria JYR, 4 nm, NDY PTWz, Y 5 and Yio were identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas sp., Bacillus firmus, Bacillus endophyticus, and Bacillus pumilus, respectively. In the second experiment, the efficacy of antagonistic rhizobacteria was evaluated alone and in combination with fungicide against stalk rot in maize. The experiment was conducted under axenic conditions in pots. All the antagonistic rhizobacteria significantly reduced (up to 61 %) stalk rot disease in maize plants. The antioxidant enzymes like superoxidase dismutase, peroxidase, polyphenol <b>oxidase,</b> <b>ascorbate</b> peroxidase, proteases and chitinases were enhanced significantly in the rhizobacteria inoculated maize plants. The combined applications of B. endophyticus, P. aeruginosa JYR and P. aeruginosa 4 nm were at par with the full dose (0. 2 %) of chemical fungicide for controlling the growth of F. moniliforme in maize plants. In the third experiment, the selected rhizobacteria were evaluated as bio-inoculant on maize under natural conditions of field. Four antagonistic rhizobacteria including P. aeruginosa JYR, B. endophyticus Y 5, P. aeruginosa 4 m and Pseudomonas sp. NDY exhibited significant decrease (up to 56 %) against stalk rot in field. The percentage decrease in disease severity was higher under axenic conditions in pots as compared to that of the field experiment. There were significant increase in enzymes activities, PR proteins and endogenous IAA level in maize leaves. Low concentration (half dose, 0. 1 %) of fungicide applied in combination with antagonistic rhizobacteria augmented the effect of antagonistic rhizobacteria by 1. 36 folds. In fourth experiment, the antagonistic rhizobacteria were characterized for the production of antibiotics 2, 4, diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG), pyrrolnitrin (PRN), Phenazine (Phz), and Zwittermicin A and the genes involved in the biosynthesis of antibiotics were detected by PCR. The phenazine and pyrrolnitrin biosynthestic genes were found in three Pseudomonas strains P. aeruginosa JYR, P. aeruginosa 4 nm and Pseudomonas sp. NDY while, zwittermicin A biosynthetic gene was found in Bacillus endophyticus. The production of phenazine and the expression of its biosynthesis genes by Pseudomonas strains wee quantified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and RT-PCR, respectively. It is inferred from the results that P. aeruginosa JYR, B. endophyticus and P. aeruginosa 4 nm are the most efficient and consistent antagonist PGPR. Three Pseudomonas strains produce antibiotic and their expression of genes possibly correlate with their activity as biocontrol agent...|$|R
