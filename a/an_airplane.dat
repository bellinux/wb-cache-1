40|$|The basic {{aerodynamic}} {{characteristics of}} a 0. 04956 -scale model of the Convair TF- 102 <b>A</b> <b>airplane</b> with controls undeflected have been determined at Mach numbers from 0. 60 to 1. 135 for angles of attack up to approximately 22 deg in the Langley 8 -foot transonic tunnel. In addition, comparisons have been made with data obtained from a previous investigation of a 0. 04956 -scale model of the Convair F- 102 <b>A</b> <b>airplane.</b> The results indicated the TF- 102 <b>A</b> <b>airplane</b> was longitudinally stable for all conditions tested. An increase in lift-curve slope from 0. 045 to 0. 059 and an 11 -percent rearward shift in aerodynamic-center location occurred with increases in Mach number from 0. 60 to approximately 1. 05. The zero-lift drag coefficient for the TF- 102 <b>A</b> <b>airplane</b> increased 145 percent between the Mach numbers of 0. 85 and 1. 075; the maximum lift-drag ratio decreased from 9. 5 at a Mach number of 0. 60 to 5. 0 at Mach numbers above 1. 025. There was little difference in the lift and pitching-moment characteristics and drag due to life between the TF- 102 A and F- 102 A configurations. However, {{as compared with the}} F- 102 <b>A</b> <b>airplane,</b> the zero-lift drag-rise Mach number for the TF- 102 A was reduced by at least 0. 06, the zero-lift peak wave drag was increased 50 percent, and the maximum lift-drag ratio was reduced as much as 20 percent...|$|R

40|$|A {{modified}} Newton-Raphson {{method has}} been used to determine the parameters in equations describing the vortex flow to obtain a best match with flight measurements of the flow behind the C- 5 <b>A</b> <b>airplane.</b> The flight measurements were made using a specially instrumented T- 33 airplane which passed as closely as possible to the centers of the trailing vortices at several distances behind the C- 5 <b>A</b> <b>airplane.</b> The flight measurements were transformed to flow velocity relative to an inertial frame of reference. The assumed form of the flow consisted of the superposition of two counterrotating, finite core vortices. The positions of the vortex centers, their total circulation, the effective eddy viscosity and measurement bias were the parameters adjusted. The assumed form of vortex flow fit well the measured velocities for the numerous sets of data, both flaps up and down for the C- 5 <b>A</b> <b>airplane.</b> The resulting values of total circulation, however, were about two-thirds that expected of a wing with an elliptical loading. A partial explanation of the less than expected circulation is a dip in the spanwise lift distribution at the airplane's center line. The distance between the trailing vortices at the smallest times encountered is somewhat less than that expected for an elliptical wing loading...|$|R
