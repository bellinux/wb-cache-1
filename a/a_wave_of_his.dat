500|$|The second Milton Berle Show {{appearance}} came on June 5 at NBC's Hollywood studio, amid another hectic tour. Berle {{persuaded the}} singer {{to leave his}} guitar backstage, advising, [...] "Let 'em see you, son." [...] During the performance, Presley abruptly halted an uptempo rendition of [...] "Hound Dog" [...] with <b>a</b> <b>wave</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> arm and launched into a slow, grinding version accentuated with energetic, exaggerated body movements. Presley's gyrations created a storm of controversy. Newspaper critics were outraged: Jack Gould of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Mr. Presley has no discernible singing ability.... His phrasing, {{if it can be}} called that, consists of the stereotyped variations that go with a beginner's aria in a bathtub.... His one specialty is an accented movement of the body... primarily identified with the repertoire of the blond bombshells of the burlesque runway." [...] Ben Gross of the New York Daily News opined that popular music [...] "has reached its lowest depths in the 'grunt and groin' antics of one Elvis Presley.... Elvis, who rotates his pelvis... gave an exhibition that was suggestive and vulgar, tinged with the kind of animalism that should be confined to dives and bordellos". Ed Sullivan, whose own variety show was the nation's most popular, declared him [...] "unfit for family viewing". To Presley's displeasure, he soon found himself being referred to as [...] "Elvis the Pelvis", which he called [...] "one of the most childish expressions I ever heard, comin' from an adult." ...|$|E
