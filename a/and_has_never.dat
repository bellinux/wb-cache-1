Among the novel's major themes are the civilising effect of Christianity, 19th-century British imperialism in the South Pacific, and the importance of hierarchy and leadership. It was the inspiration for William Golding's dystopian novel Lord of the Flies (1954), which inverted the morality of The Coral Island; in Ballantyne's story the children encounter evil, but in Lord of the Flies evil is within them.|$|E

5|$|Zimbabwe's {{commercial}} farming {{sector was}} traditionally {{a source of}} exports and foreign exchange, and provided 400,000 jobs.

Work commenced on the south west tower in 1508, but it had not risen above the roofline {{at the time of the}} dissolution of the monasteries, <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> been completed. The central tower, rising to , is a “lantern tower” with large windows letting light into the crossing.

5|$|It {{keeps its}} {{distance}} from mass media and avoids publishing details about its activities and membership.

5|$|Kirchherr {{admits that}} she is not good at {{business}} as she is not organised enough, <b>and</b> <b>has</b> <b>never</b> really looked after the negatives of her photographs to prove ownership. Her business partner Ulf Krüger—a songwriter and record producer—successfully found many of Astrid's negatives and photographs and had them copyrighted, although he believes that Kirchherr has lost £500,000 over the years because of people using her photographs without permission. In July 2001 Kirchherr visited Liverpool to open an exhibition of her work at the Mathew Street art gallery, which is close to the former site of The Cavern Club. She appeared as a guest at the city's Beatles Week Festival during the August Bank Holiday. Kirchherr's work has been exhibited internationally in places, such as Hamburg, Bremen, London, Liverpool, New York City, Washington D.C., Tokyo, Vienna, and at the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame.|$|E
