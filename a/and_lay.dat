5|$|The Law Society asked Coopers & Lybrand {{to produce}} {{a report on the}} Law Society, which {{included}} its disciplinary topics among the areas to be reported on. The draft report, published in 1984, recommended that the Law Society should transfer its disciplinary processes to an independent Solicitor's Complaints Board, which would be made up of both solicitors <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> people (although with a majority of its members being solicitors). In 1985 the National Consumer Council published a survey showing that only 15% of respondents felt that the Law Society should be investigating complaints, and only 5% felt that if an independent body was created it should contain a solicitor majority, with 36% wanting equal representation of solicitors <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> people and 55% preferring a majority of lay people.|$|E

5|$|Ixodid ticks require three hosts, {{and their}} life cycle {{takes at least}} one year to complete. Up to 3,000 eggs are laid on the ground by an adult female tick. When the larvae emerge, they feed {{primarily}} on small mammals and birds. After feeding, they detach from their host and molt to nymphs on the ground, which then feed on larger hosts and molt to adults. Female adults attach to larger hosts, feed, <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> eggs, while males feed very little and occupy larger hosts primarily for mating.|$|E
5|$|Lungless {{salamanders}} in {{the family}} Plethodontidae are terrestrial <b>and</b> <b>lay</b> {{a small number of}} unpigmented eggs in a cluster among damp leaf litter. Each egg has a large yolk sac and the larva feeds on this while it develops inside the egg, emerging fully formed as a juvenile salamander. The female salamander often broods the eggs. In the genus Ensatinas, the female has been observed to coil around them and press her throat area against them, effectively massaging them with a mucous secretion.|$|E
