Operation of the <b>ammonia</b> <b>scrubber</b> during IDMS Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) and Slurry Mix Evaporator (SME) processing has been completed. The <b>ammonia</b> <b>scrubber</b> was successful in removing ammonia from the vapor stream to achieve NH 3 concentrations far below the 10 ppM vapor exist design basis during SRAT processing. However, during SME processing, vapor NH 3 concentrations as high as 450 ppM were measured exiting the scrubber. Problems during the SRAT and SME testing were vapor bypassing the scrubber and inefficient scrubbing of the ammonia {{at the end of}} the SME cycle (50 % removal efficiency; 99. 9 % is design basis efficiency) ...|$|E

40|$|The {{concentrations}} of mercury at the FAVC inlet and exit were measured during the BL 1 and PX 6 runs of the Integrated DWPF Melter System (IDMS) with the HEME bypassed {{and without the}} <b>ammonia</b> <b>scrubber.</b> The results showed that mercury {{concentrations of}} approximately 1. 02 - 12. 7 (mean 5. 74) times saturation occurred at the FAVC exit. The concentration of mercury at the FAVC inlet {{was found to be}} 0. 66 - 6. 2 times the saturation value (based on the SRAT condenser exit). In the PX 7 run, the <b>ammonia</b> <b>scrubber</b> was used and the FAVC HEME was not bypassed. The results from this run showed that the FAVC inlet concentrations again were above saturation (1. 45 - 15. 5 times saturation), but that the FAVC exit concentrations were only 0. 02 - 0. 41 times saturation (except for one data point at 1. 61 times saturation). Operation of the FAVC without the HEME could therefore result in FAVC exit mercury concentrations of greater than 5. 74 times saturation, which would result in DWPF emitting greater than 405 lb/yr of mercury at 100 percent attainment; this quantity is well in excess of the permit limit of 175 lb/yr (for all of DWPF). However, with the HEME in place, the emissions are predicted to be only about 40 lb/yr for an FAVC exit temperature of 10 degrees C. The experimental results also indicate that the ammonia scrubbers have little effect on the removal of mercury...|$|E
40|$|Modelling of SCR in {{diesel exhaust}} systems with {{injection}} of urea spray {{is complex and}} challenging but many models use only the conversion observed at the brick exit {{as a test of}} the model. In this study, the case modelled is simplified by injecting ammonia gas in nitrogen in place of urea, but the spatial conversion profiles along the SCR brick length at steady state are investigated. This is a more rigorous way of assessing the ability of the model to simulate observations made on a test exhaust system. The data have been collected by repeated engine tests on eight different brick lengths, all which were shorter than a standard sized SCR. The tests have been carried out for supplied NH 3 /NOx ratios of α 1. 5, excess ammonia, α 1. 0, balanced ammonia, and α 0. 5, deficient ammonia. Levels of NO, NO 2 and NH 3 have been measured both upstream and downstream of the SCR using a gas analyser fitted with <b>ammonia</b> <b>scrubbers</b> to give reliable NOx measurements. A CFD model based on the porous medium approach has incorporated a kinetic scheme available in the open literature. Comparison of CFD simulations with observed data is presented and the results are discussed. NOx conversion is significant in the first 30 mm of the brick for α 0. 5 and in the first 90 mm for α 1. 0 and 1. 5. The ammonia level influences NOx conversion, which is generally under-predicted by the current model for α 0. 5 and over-predicted for α 1. 5. Measurements show that NO 2 conversion exceeds NO conversion in the first section of the monolith, which the model fails to predict...|$|R
40|$|This report {{relates to}} the Defense Waste Processing Facility.) The {{concentrations}} of mercury at the FAFC inlet and exit were measured during the BL 1 and PX 6 runs of the Integrated DWPF Melter System (IDMS) with the HEME bypassed and without the <b>ammonia</b> <b>scrubber.</b> The results show that mercury concentrations of approximately 2. 6 - 12. 7 (mean = 6. 2) times saturation occur at the FAFC exit. The concentration of mercury at the SRAT condenser exit {{was found to be}} 10 times the saturation value. FAVC exit mercury concentrations of 6. 2 times saturation would result in DWPF emitting up to 438 lb/yr of mercury at 100 percent attainments, which is in excess of the permit limit of 175 lb/yr. However, operation of the FAVC with the HEME should reduce the mercury emissions. The addition of the ammonia scrubbers should also reduce the mercury emissions since the nitric acid used to scrub ammonia should also scrub mercury...|$|E
40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the results of}} the off-line testing the Integrated DWPF Melter System (IDMS) ammonia scrubbers using ammonia supplied from cylinders. Three additional tests with ammonia are planned to verify the data collected during off-line testing. Operation of the <b>ammonia</b> <b>scrubber</b> during IDMS SRAT and SME processing will be completed during the next IDMS run. The Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) and Slurry Mix Evaporator (SME) scrubbers were successful in removing ammonia from the vapor stream to achieve ammonia vapor concentrations far below the 10 ppM vapor exit design basis. In most of the tests, the ammonia concentration in the vapor exit was lower than the detection limit of the analyzers so results are generally reported as < 0. 05 parts per million (ppM). During SRAT scrubber testing, the ammonia concentration was no higher than 2 ppM and during SME testing the ammonia concentration was no higher than 0. 05 m...|$|E
40|$|This body of {{research}} aimed to prove microalgal potential to utilize environmental pollutants in an effective and economic way. Ammonia gas, carbon dioxide, and wastewater were targeted as pollutants to remove in three different technical papers. The first work, {{an extension of the}} previous paper, studied carbon dioxide effect on the microalgal <b>ammonia</b> <b>scrubber</b> system. Freshwater green algae Scenedesmus dimorphus, the same species as the previous study, were grown in a flat panel photobioreactor aerated with ammonia- and CO 2 -laden air. The ammonia mass loading was fixed at an optimal level found in the previous study and CO 2 mass loading rates was varied in a range found in typical concentrated animal feeding operations. The data showed high ammonia and CO 2 removal rate and removal efficiency and the biomass contained amino acid profiles close to the ideal protein profiles for typical animal feeds, with a high ratio of essential amino acids. Therefore, microalgae effectively mitigate ammonia and CO 2 emissions, with a potential for use as an animal feed additive. The second work was still about microalgal <b>ammonia</b> <b>scrubber</b> system using different species, Haematococcus pluvialis, known as the most productive astaxanthin producers, to enhance its economic feasibility. Currently, most H. pluvialis cultivation systems use two stage mode: optimal growth mode and stress mode to induce astaxanthin. In this study, it was hypothesized that ammonia gas can serve as both growth nutrient and stress to induce astaxanthin. Tapered bubble columns were used to avoid cell settlement because H. pluvialis cells gets bigger when they enter carotenogenesis. Before testing ammonia gas, pH and different nitrogen sources were tested because ammonia/ammonium form depends highly on pHs to compare growth performances between nitrogen sources. After confirming a good growth performance at pH 4, pH 5, and ammonium, ammonia gas was fed directly to the reactor at pH 4 and 5. Further efforts to increase astaxanthin content were made by feeding ammonia gas with different schedule or adding extra chemicals. Among all trials, only C/N ratio 1 was effective. The third work was about treating phosphorus in wastewater (synthetic BBM medium, wastewater streams A, B, and C) using Revolving Algal Biofilm (RAB) systems. The two keys of microalgal phosphorus removal are efficient cultivation system and efficient operation design. As to prove the efficiency of RAB cultivation system, cell growth and liquid nutrient removal performances in different growth media were compared with other cultivation systems. As to design the optimal operation of the systems, phosphorus uptake kinetics and mass balance were demonstrated by analyzing bound-P, acid-soluble P (ASP), and acid-insoluble P (AISP). In continuous culture, it was shown that harvest frequency and wastewater replacement rate can be optimized according to the cellular activities...|$|E
40|$|On March 18, 2009 a Defense Waste Processing Facility (DWPF) GC Line Filter Assembly was {{received}} at the Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL). This filter assembly {{was removed from}} operation following the completion of Sludge Batch 4 processing in the DWPF. Work on this sample was requested in a Technical Assistance Request. This document reports the pictures, observations, samples collected, and analytical results for the assembly. The assembly arrived at SRNL separated into its three component filters: high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) - 1, HEPA- 2, and a high efficiency mist evaporator (HEME). Each stage of the assembly's media was sampled and examined visually and by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Solids built up in the filter housing following the first stage HEME, were dissolved in dilute nitric acid and analyzed by ICP-AES and the undissolved white solids were analyzed by x-ray diffraction (XRD). The {{vast majority of the}} material {{in each of the three}} stages of the DWPF GC Line Filter Assembly appears to be contaminated with a Hg compound that is {approx} 59 wt% Hg on a total solids basis. The Hg species was identified by XRD analysis to contain a mixture of Hg{sub 4 }(OH) (NO{sub 3 }) {sub 3 } and Hg{sub 10 }(OH) {sub 4 }(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 6 }. Only in the core sample of the second stage HEPA, did this material appear to be completely covering portions of the filter media, possibly explaining the pressure drops observed by DWPF. The fact that the material migrates through the HEME filter and both HEPA filters, and that it was seen collecting on the outlet side of the HEME filter, would seem to indicate that these filters are not efficient at removing this material. Further SRAT off-gas system modeling should help determine the extent of Hg breakthrough past the Mercury Water Wash Tank (MWWT). The SRAT off-gas system has not been modeled since startup of the facility. Improvements to the efficiency of Hg stripping prior to the <b>ammonia</b> <b>scrubber</b> would seem to be the only way to prevent/mitigate the formation of the compounds found in the GC Line Filter Assembly filters and therefore prevent pluggage of this filter assembly...|$|E
40|$|Testing was {{completed}} {{to demonstrate the}} viability of the newly developed glycolic acid/formic acid flowsheet on processing in the Defense Waste Processing Facility's (DWPF) Chemical Process Cell (CPC). The Savannah River National Laboratory (SRNL) initiated a sludge matrix study to evaluate the impact of changing insoluble solid composition on the processing characteristics of slurries in DWPF. Four sludge simulants were prepared to cover two compositional ranges in the waste. The first was high iron/low aluminum versus low iron/high aluminum (referred to as HiFe or LoFe in this report). The second was high calcium-manganese/low nickel, chromium, and magnesium versus low calcium-manganese/high nickel, chromium, and magnesium (referred to as HiMn or LoMn in this report). These two options can be combined to form four distinct sludge compositions. The sludge matrix study called for testing each of these four simulants near the minimum acid required for nitrite destruction (100 % acid stoichiometry) and at a second acid level that produced significant hydrogen by noble metal catalyzed decomposition of formic acid (150 % acid stoichiometry). Four simulants were prepared based on the four possible combinations of the Al/Fe and Mn-Ca/Mg-Ni-Cr options. Preliminary simulant preparation work has already been documented. The four simulants were used for high and low acid testing. Eight planned experiments (GF 26 to GF 33) were completed to demonstrate {{the viability of the}} glycolic-formic flowsheet. Composition and physical property measurements were made on the SRAT product. Composition measurements were made on the condensate from the Mercury Water Wash Tank (MWWT), Formic Acid Vent Condenser (FAVC), <b>ammonia</b> <b>scrubber</b> and on SRAT samples pulled throughout the SRAT cycle. Updated values for formate loss and nitrite-tonitrate conversion were found {{that can be used in}} the acid calculations for future sludge matrix process simulations with the glycolic acid/formic acid flowsheet. Preliminary results of the initial testing indicate: (1) Hydrogen generation rate was very low throughout all SRAT cycles. (2) The mercury concentration of the SRAT product was below the 0. 8 wt% limit in all runs. (3) Nitrite in the SRAT product was < 100 mg/kg for all runs. (4) Foaminess was not an issue using the nominal antifoam addition strategy in these tests. (5) The high aluminum sludges (LoFe, HM type sludges) were much more viscous than the Hi Fe sludges. At 100 % acid stoichiometry, the SRAT products from the high aluminum sludges were very viscous but at 150 % acid stoichiometry, the SRAT products from the high aluminum sludges were very thin. This makes the glycolic acid/formic acid flowsheet an improvement for processing more viscous sludges. (6) The pH of the SRAT products was from 2. 7 - 3. 1 for the 150 % acid stoichiometry runs and 5. 1 - 6. 1 for the 100 % acid stoichiometry runs, significantly lower than is typical of the baseline nitric acid/formic acid flowsheet...|$|E
40|$|Phase III {{simulant}} flowsheet {{testing was}} completed using the latest composition estimates for SB 6 /Tank 40 feed to DWPF. The {{goals of the}} testing were to determine reasonable operating conditions and assumptions for the startup of SB 6 processing in the DWPF. Testing covered the region from 102 - 159 % of the current DWPF stoichiometric acid equation. Nitrite ion concentration was reduced to 90 mg/kg in the SRAT product of the lowest acid run. The 159 % acid run reached 60 % of the DWPF Sludge Receipt and Adjustment Tank (SRAT) limit of 0. 65 lb H 2 /hr, and then sporadically exceeded the DWPF Slurry Mix Evaporator (SME) limit of 0. 223 lb H 2 /hr. Hydrogen generation rates peaked at 112 % of the SME limit, but higher than targeted wt% total solids levels may have been partially responsible for rates seen. A stoichiometric factor of 120 % met both objectives. A processing window for SB 6 exists from 102 % to something close to 159 % based on the simulant results. An initial recommendation for SB 6 processing is at 115 - 120 % of the current DWPF stoichiometric acid equation. The addition of simulated Actinide Removal Process (ARP) and Modular Caustic Side Solvent Extraction Unit (MCU) streams to the SRAT cycle had no apparent impact on the preferred stoichiometric factor. Hydrogen generation occurred continuously after acid addition {{in three of the}} four tests. The three runs at 120 %, 118. 4 % with ARP/MCU, and 159 % stoichiometry were all still producing around 0. 1 lb hydrogen/hr at DWPF scale after 36 hours of boiling in the SRAT. The 120 % acid run reached 23 % of the SRAT limit and 37 % of the SME limit. Conversely, nitrous oxide generation was subdued compared to previous sludge batches, staying below 29 lb/hr in all four tests or about a fourth as much as in comparable SB 4 testing. Two processing issues, identified during SB 6 Phase II flowsheet testing and qualification simulant testing, were monitored during Phase III. Mercury material balance closure was impacted by acid stoichiometry, and significant mercury was not accounted for in the highest acid run. Coalescence of elemental mercury droplets in the mercury water wash tank (MWWT) appeared to degrade with increasing stoichiometry. Observations were made of mercury scale formation in the SRAT condenser and MWWT. A tacky mercury amalgam with Rh, Pd, and Cu, plus some Ru and Ca formed on the impeller at 159 % acid. It contained a significant fraction of the available Pd, Cu, and Rh as well as about 25 % of the total mercury charged. Free (elemental) mercury was found in all of the SME products. Ammonia scrubbers were used during the tests to capture off-gas ammonia for material balance purposes. Significant ammonium ion formation was again observed during the SRAT cycle, and ammonia gas entered the off-gas as the pH rose during boiling. Ammonium ion production was lower than in the SB 6 Phase II and the qualification simulant testing. Similar ammonium ion formation was seen in the ARP/MCU simulation as in the 120 % flowsheet run. A slightly higher pH caused most of the ammonium to vaporize and collect in the <b>ammonia</b> <b>scrubber</b> reflux solution. Two periods of foaminess were noted. Neither required additional antifoam to control the foam growth. A steady foam layer formed during reflux in the 120 % acid run. It was about an inch thick, but was 2 - 3 times more volume of bubbles than is typically seen during reflux. A similar foam layer also was seen during caustic boiling of the simulant during the ARP addition. While frequently seen with the radioactive sludge, foaminess during caustic boiling with simulants has been relatively rare. Two further flowsheet tests were performed and will be documented separately. One test was to evaluate the impact of process conditions that match current DWPF operation (lower rates). The second test was to evaluate the impact of SRAT/SME processing on the rheology of a modified Phase III simulant that had been made five times more viscous using ultrasonication...|$|E
