2500|$|Despite {{initially}} {{complying with}} ideological requirements, Baconsky was often subject to {{criticism in the}} official press. This occurred frequently after 1953, when Soviet politico Georgy Malenkov disavowed proletkult, criticizing its exponents for having authored a bland and distant form of literature (an accusation which Baconsky was regularly faced with from that moment on). Criticism was expressed early on by poet Veronica Porumbacu, who reproached him having published too little [...] "when the people is <b>asking</b> <b>us</b> to participate with all forces in the struggle." [...] Also in 1953, Paul Georgescu, literary columnist at Scînteia, the main Communist Party organ, reacted against the Steaua leadership, and argued that Baconsky personally had developed [...] "a high-flown style, designed to hide his unfamiliarity with life and lack of ideas." [...] Georgescu also claimed that Baconsky's travel accounts had failed to show [...] "how [...] people live, how this country looks today [...] ", and that his poems displayed various ideological mistakes. Writing for Viaţa Românească, critic Eugen Campus endorsed earlier pronouncements and added that, although Baconsky was a [...] "talented poet", he found his contributions showed [...] "a tendency to repeat oneself—for all the originality it covets". Literary historian Ana Selejan notes that, upon {{the end of the}} debates, the poet found himself was [...] "blacklisted" [...] by the official critics.|$|E
2500|$|Davis's case gained {{increasing}} {{public exposure}} {{and support from}} organizations and prominent individuals. Nobel Peace Prize winner Archbishop Desmond Tutu urged the courts to agree {{to hear the evidence}} of police coercion and recanted testimony. An appeal to Governor of Georgia Sonny Perdue urging him to spare Davis's life was sent on behalf of Pope Benedict XVI. Similar appeals were sent by singer Harry Belafonte, Sister Helen Prejean, author of Dead Man Walking, and actor Mike Farrell. Amnesty International published a report about Davis's case characterizing it as a miscarriage of justice and a [...] "catastrophic flaw in the U.S. death penalty machine." [...] The human rights group initiated a letter-writing campaign and delivered 4,000 letters to the clemency board. William S. Sessions, former FBI Director and federal judge, called on authorities to halt the execution process, writing that [...] "t would be intolerable to execute a man without his claims of innocence ever being considered by the courts or by the executive". Politicians and others such as Jesse Jackson, Jr. and Sheila Jackson Lee, and former Texas District Attorney Sam D. Millsap, Jr., and the organization Murder Victims Families for Reconciliation requested that the courts grant Davis a new trial. U.S. Congressman John Lewis spoke to the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles, suggesting that Coles – one of the witnesses who had not recanted – was the real killer. Representatives from the Council of Europe and European Parliament also spoke out on Davis's case, <b>asking</b> <b>U.S.</b> authorities to halt the planned execution and calling for a new trial.|$|E
