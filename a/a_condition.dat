50|$|A neutral {{stimulus}} is {{a stimulus}} which initially produces no specific response other than focusing attention. In classical conditioning, when used {{together with an}} unconditioned stimulus, the neutral stimulus becomes <b>a</b> <b>conditioned</b> stimulus. With repeated presentations of both the neutral stimulus and the unconditioned stimulus, the neutral stimulus will elicit a response as well, known as <b>a</b> <b>conditioned</b> response. Once the neutral stimulus elicits <b>a</b> <b>conditioned</b> response, the neutral stimulus becomes known as <b>a</b> <b>conditioned</b> stimulus. The conditioned response {{is the same as}} the unconditioned response, but occurs in the presence of the conditioned stimulus rather than the unconditioned stimulus.|$|R

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>conditioned</b> {{inhibitor}} {{is assumed}} to have a negative associative value. By presenting an inhibitor with a novel stimulus (i.e., its associative strength is zero), the model predicts that the novel cue should become <b>a</b> <b>conditioned</b> excitor. This {{is not the case}} in experimental situations. The predictions of the model stem from its basic term (lambda-V). Since the summed associative strength of all stimuli (V) present on the trial is negative (zero + inhibitory potential) and lambda is zero (no US present), the resulting change in the associative strength is positive, thus making the novel cue <b>a</b> <b>conditioned</b> excitor.|$|R
50|$|Extinction {{learning}} can also {{occur in a}} classical conditioning paradigm. In this model, a neutral cue or context can come to elicit <b>a</b> <b>conditioned</b> response when it is paired with an unconditioned stimulus. An unconditioned stimulus is one that naturally and automatically triggers a certain behavioral response. A certain stimulus or environment can become <b>a</b> <b>conditioned</b> cue or <b>a</b> <b>conditioned</b> context, respectively, when paired with an unconditioned stimulus. An example {{of this process is}} a fear conditioning paradigm using a mouse. In this instance, a tone paired with a mild footshock can become <b>a</b> <b>conditioned</b> cue, eliciting <b>a</b> fear response when presented alone in the future. In the same way, the context in which a footshock is received such as a chamber with certain dimensions and a certain odor can elicit the same fear response when the mouse is placed back in that chamber {{in the absence of the}} footshock.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{technological}} innovations {{and the need}} for increased safety on the world’s roads have led to the introduction of In-Vehicle Information Systems (IVIS). These systems will provide navigation and advisory information to drivers while they are driving. One aspect of these systems, In-vehicle Signing Information Systems (ISIS), would provide the warning, regulatory, and advisory information that is currently found on road signs. These systems may be of particular benefit when external elements such as rain, snow, or night driving reduce or eliminate the opportunity for drivers to detect road signs. This study attempts to determine what benefits, if any, are realized by drivers using this system. Fifty-eight drivers operated an instrumented Oldsmobile Aurora under eight conditions. The eight <b>conditions</b> consisted of <b>a</b> daylight-clear weather-ISIS <b>condition,</b> <b>a</b> daylight-clear weather-No ISIS <b>condition,</b> <b>a</b> daylight-rain-ISIS <b>condition,</b> <b>a</b> daylight-rain-No ISIS <b>condition,</b> <b>a</b> night-clear weather-ISIS <b>condition,</b> <b>a</b> night-clear weather-No ISIS <b>condition,</b> <b>a</b> night-rain-ISIS <b>condition,</b> and <b>a</b> night-rain-No ISIS <b>condition.</b> Younger drivers (18 - 30 years old) and older drivers (65 years or older) took part in this study.

40|$|In three {{experiments}} using rats as subjects, {{we investigated}} {{the degree to}} which <b>a</b> <b>conditioned</b> flavor aversion transfers from one context to another. Experiment 1, using a one-trial condition-ing procedure, found no effect of a change of context on <b>a</b> <b>conditioned</b> aversion. Experiment 2 employed a multitrial procedure and demonstrated that <b>a</b> <b>conditioned</b> aversion was extinguished more rapidly after a change of context. Experiment 3 showed that context change decreased the effectiveness with which <b>a</b> <b>conditioned</b> flavor could block acquisition of an aversion by a second flavor. It is argued that these data cannot be explained in associative terms, and that they con-stitute evidence of conditionality in a simple aversive conditioning procedure. It is well established that explicit discrimination train-ing can render the effects of simple conditioning context-dependent. Thus, an animal given pairings of a condi-tioned stimulus (CS) and an unconditioned stimulus (US) in one distinctive context, and presentations of the same CS along with some other outcome in a different context, will come to emit different conditioned responses (CRs...|$|R
