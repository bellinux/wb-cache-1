50|$|Management of {{most large}} farms was {{organized}} hierarchically on three levels. On large cooperative farms, an <b>assembly</b> <b>of</b> <b>members</b> or their elected representatives was legally responsible for farm operation, although a committee and its chairman carried out daily management of operation. In practice, the assembly functioned largely to ratify decisions already {{made by the}} chairman. As cooperative farms increased in size, {{the authority of the}} <b>assembly</b> <b>of</b> <b>members</b> declined. Boards of economic management, consisting of the chairman and a staff of experts on various operations, took over the most important management functions. The second echelon of management in large cooperatives or state farms had responsibility for smaller operations in either a specific area or a particular branch of production. The third level of management organized the labor force performing the farm work, such as the field brigades. The chairman of a cooperative or the director of a state farm held most of the power in the organization, and the subordinate levels were severely restricted in their decision making.|$|E
