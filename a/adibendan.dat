40|$|R 79595 (N-cyclohexyl-N-methyl- 2 -[[[phenyl (1, 2, 3, 5 -tetrahydro- 2 oxoimidazo [2, 1 -b]-quinazolin- 7 -yl) methylene] amin] oxy] acetamide) and its isomers {{represent}} a novel class of compounds with phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitory and cardiotonic (positive inotropic) actions. The cardiac {{effects of this}} class of compounds were investigated in the hexobarbital-depressed heart-lung preparation of the guinea-pig. After induction of heart failure (reduction of cardiac output to 25 % of the initial value) cumulative addition of R 79595 or its isomers R 80122 (E-isomer) and R 80123 (Z-isomer) concentration-dependently reversed the cardiac depressant effects of hexobarbitone-Na. With regard to reconstitution of contractility and cardiac function R 80122 (E-isomer) was 10 fold more potent than R 79595 (1 : 1 mixture of the isomers) and nearly 100 fold more potent than R 80123 (Z-isomer). Furthermore, the cardiotonic action of the most potent isomer (R 80122) was compared {{to the effects of}} several positive inotropic reference compounds. The order of cardiotonic potency was as follows: (-) -adrenaline > R 80122 = <b>adibendan</b> > digitoxin > milrinone = enoximone > theophylline. <b>Adibendan</b> (EC 50 value: 6. 7 +/- 1. 8 x 10. (- 8) mol/l), which showed cardiotonic effects in the same concentration range as R 80122 (EC 50 Value: 6. 1 +/- 1. 3 x 10 (- 8) mol/ 1), was significantly (p The cardiotonic effects of R 80122 could be observed in the low concentration range of 3 x 10 (- 8) to 1 x 10 (- 6) mol/l, whereas enoximone (EC 50 value: 1. 2 +/- 0. 1 x 10 (- 5) mol/ 1) and milrinone (EC 50 value: 8. 9 +/- 3. 5 x 10 (- 6) Mol/ 1) elicited positive inotropic effects at 100 fold higher concentrations. Digitoxin was 10 fold less and theophylline was 300 fold less potent than R 80122 with regard to reconstitution of heart function. The cardiotonic effects of R 80122 were not accompanied by an increase in heart rate as found with milrinone, theophylline or (-) -adrenaline in this model. Furthermore, the PDE inhibitory effect of R 79595 and its E-isomer R 80122 were investigated in partially purified isoenzymes from guinea-pig ventricles. The IC 50 values of R 79595 and R 80122 on PDE I - IV were compared to the IC 50 values of <b>adibendan,</b> milrinone, enoximone and theophylline. The selectivity of an inhibitor for PDE III was evaluated by division of its IC 50 values on PDE I, II and IV by the IC 50 value on PDE III. R 80122 was the most potent and selective PDE III inhibitor. The IC 50 value was 0. 017 +/- 0. 001 mumol/l. IC 50 ratios ranged from 2353 (ODE II/PDE III) to 7000 (PDE I/PDE III). The PDE IV/PDE III ratio for R 80122 (5118) was more than 10 times higher than the PDE IV/PDE III ratio calculated for <b>adibendan</b> (333) which displayed the highest PDE III selectivy and potency (IC 50 0. 36 +/- 0. 04 mumol/l) among the reference compounds. Milrinone and enoximone also preferentially inhibited PDE III, whereas theophylline inhibited all four isoenzymes in an unselective manner with low potency. Since the EC 50 values of R 80122 for cardiotonic effects and the IC 50 value for PDE III inhibition were of the same order of magnitude, it can be assumed that potent and selective PDE III inhibition may be in part responsible for the cardiotonic effects of R 80122 observed in the acute heart failure model. The potent cardiotonic properties and the absence of positive chronotropy revealed by this study suggest that R 80122 might exert a beneficial effect in the treatment of acute heart failure...|$|E
40|$|The cardiac {{in vitro}} effects of R 80122, a novel {{phosphodiesterase}} (PDE) inhibitor, were investigated and {{compared with those}} of the reference compound milrinone and of the calcium-sensitizer <b>adibendan.</b> In guinea pig left atria, both milrinone and R 80122 increased contractile force; 10 muM milrinone was equieffective to 1 muM R 80122. The rate of spontaneously beating atria was not altered by R 80122 in the concentration range of 0. 01 - 0. 3 muM. Higher concentrations (1 - 10 muM) led to a statistically insignificant increase of 20 %. Milrinone's effect on frequency was more pronounced and amounted to 21 % at 10 muM and to 40 % at 100 muM. <b>Adibendan</b> increased heart rate (HR) by 10 % at a concentration of only 0. 03 muM. This effect was not enhanced any further by increasing the concentration. In papillary muscle, the positive inotropic effects of both milrinone and R 80122 were inhibited by carbachol, indicating involvement of cyclic AMP. Further indications for a cyclic AMP-dependent action were obtained by induction of slow action potentials and synergism with isoprenaline. In electrophysiologic measurements, milrinone reduced action potential duration (APD) in a high concentration whereas R 80122 had no effect. Action potential changes elicited by a toxic concentration of ouabain were reduced by R 80122. Relaxation of rat aortic rings contracted by KCl and relaxation of guineapig aortic rings contracted by norepinephrine (NE) was comparable for both milrinone and R 80122. R 80122 also caused relaxation of canine coronary arteries constricted with prostaglandin F 2 alpha (PGF 2 alpha) both with and without endothelium. NE-induced contractions in canine gastrosplenic arteries were not affected by R 80122. Cardiac contractility that had been impaired to various degrees by pentobarbital or by aging was restored to control values by both milrinone and R 80122. R 80122 enhanced cardiac contractility at lower concentrations than milrinone with no concomitant increase in frequency or shortening of the action potential, which may be advantageous for treatment of heart failure...|$|E
