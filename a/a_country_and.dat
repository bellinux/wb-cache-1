5|$|A {{departure}} from the hip-hop and R sound of her previous studio albums, the track is <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>and</b> pop ballad revolving around body image and female empowerment. Media outlets had varying opinions of the song's genre, describing it as having soul, blues, gospel, and show tune influences. In the lyrics, Fantasia narrates a tragic story about a woman, while providing commentary on social class, marriage, and alcoholism. Inspired by her past, she recorded the single {{as a way to}} empower women and reconcile with her childhood insecurities.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} {{employs the}} Scout method, a programme of informal education {{with an emphasis}} on practical outdoor activities, including camping, woodcraft, aquatics, hiking, backpacking, and sports. Another widely recognized movement characteristic is the Scout uniform, by intent hiding all differences of social standing in <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>and</b> making for equality, with neckerchief and campaign hat or comparable headwear. Distinctive uniform insignia include the fleur-de-lis and the trefoil, as well as badges and other patches.|$|E
5|$|Yuri on Ice {{has raised}} {{discussion}} concerning its {{depiction of a}} same-sex relationship between its protagonists, with some critics praising it for covering homosexuality {{in a way that}} differs from most anime and manga such as yaoi, and for dealing with homosexuality in <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>and</b> sport that has present-day issues with homophobia; others criticised its depiction for being unrealistic and ambiguous. The series has also been praised for its depiction of anxiety, and also raised a brief controversy concerning a similar figure skating-based title to be released in the United States in 2017.|$|E

5|$|Early {{development}} of the women's game at the time colonial powers brought football to Sierra Leone and the continent was limited, as colonial powers in the region tended to take concepts of patriarchy and women's participation in sport with them to local cultures that already had similar concepts already embedded in them. Other factors on the continent impact the {{development of}} the game, including limited access to education, poverty among women in the wider society, and fundamental inequality present in the society that occasionally allows for female specific human rights abuses. When quality players are developed in Africa, they often leave for greater opportunities elsewhere Continent wide; most of the funding for women's football in <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>and</b> for the women's national team comes from FIFA, not the national football association. Future success for women's football in Africa is dependent on improved facilities and access by women to these facilities. Attempting to commercialise the game is not the solution, as demonstrated by the existence of many youth and women's football camps held on the continent that have resulted in improved national team performance as players progressed through the system.|$|E
5|$|In November 1959, Starkey joined Al Caldwell's Texans, a skiffle {{group who}} {{were looking for}} someone with a proper drum kit so that the group could {{transition}} from one of Liverpool's best-known skiffle acts to a full-fledged rock and roll band. They had begun playing local clubs as the Raging Texans, then Jet Storm and the Raging Texans before settling on Rory Storm and the Hurricanes soon before recruiting Starkey. About this time he adopted the stage name Ringo Starr; derived from the rings he wore and also because it implied <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>and</b> western influence. His drum solos were billed as Starr Time.|$|E
5|$|Matters {{came to a}} head in 1952, {{when the}} {{mainland}} NOC (the All-China Athletic Federation), considering itself a continuation of the pre-1949 committee, wrote to the IOC stating that it desired to participate in the Helsinki Olympics to be held that year. As the Taiwanese also proposed to send a team, this conflicted with IOC rules stating that only one committee could represent <b>a</b> <b>country,</b> <b>and</b> both Chinese groups were unwilling to negotiate with the other, or to send a joint team. After considerable deliberation, the IOC decided that if either committee was recognized by the ISF for a sport, the committee could send athletes to participate in events in that discipline. In protest, Taiwan withdrew from the Games; the PRC sent a team to Helsinki, though it arrived ten days after the start of the Games. Brundage, president-elect when {{the decision was made to}} allow PRC athletes to compete, argued against the decision to allow mainland participation before its NOC was recognized, but he was overruled by his colleagues.|$|E

5|$|The postcards used to {{introduce}} <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>and</b> their participants were shot {{in their respective}} countries and featured the artists using unique ways to create their country's flag, e.g. the postcard for the United Kingdom features Molly creating the Union Flag from AEC Routemaster buses, Royal Mail vans, and people wearing blue raincoats along with strips of red and white paper, and the postcard for Denmark featuring Basim and his singers using old furniture and red and white paint to paint the Danish flag. The postcards then ended with the act taking a picture on a camera or phone and a close up of the resulting artwork was shown onscreen. The flag created by the artist(s) is then captured into a diamond and it transitions to the official flag. It then swirls round for the before-hand details of the artist/composer. For example, the entry for San Marino features the painting of the flag that Valentina Monetta (the artist) created, transitioning into the official flag for San Marino.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, rock spawned several subgenres, {{beginning}} with surf. Surf was an instrumental guitar genre {{characterized by a}} distorted sound, associated with the Southern California surfing youth culture. Inspired by the lyrical focus of surf, The Beach Boys began recording in 1961 with an elaborate, pop-friendly, and harmonic sound. As their fame grew, The Beach Boys' songwriter Brian Wilson experimented with new studio techniques and became associated with the counterculture. The counterculture was a movement that embraced political activism, and was closely connected to the hippie subculture. The hippies were associated with folk rock, country rock, and psychedelic rock. Folk and country rock {{were associated with the}} rise of politicized folk music, led by Pete Seeger and others, especially at the Greenwich Village music scene in New York. Folk rock entered the mainstream {{in the middle of the}} 1960s, when the singer-songwriter Bob Dylan began his career. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine attributes The Beatles' shift toward introspective songwriting in the mid-1960s to Bob Dylan's influence at the time. He was followed by a number of country-rock bands and soft, folky singer-songwriters. Psychedelic rock was a hard-driving kind of guitar-based rock, closely associated with the city of San Francisco. Though Jefferson Airplane was the only local band to have a major national hit, the Grateful Dead, <b>a</b> <b>country</b> <b>and</b> bluegrass-flavored jam band, became an iconic part of the psychedelic counterculture, associated with hippies, LSD and other symbols of that era. Some say that the Grateful Dead were truly the most American patriotic rock band to have ever existed; forming and molding a culture that defines Americans today.|$|E
