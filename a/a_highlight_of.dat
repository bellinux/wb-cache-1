5|$|Branham {{regarded}} {{his series}} of sermons on the Seven Seals in 1963 as <b>a</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>of</b> his ministry. In reality, Branham's teaching {{on this subject}} revealed very little new doctrine and was essentially a laborious restatement of the dispensationalism espoused in the sermons on the seven church ages.|$|E
5|$|The show's monologues are sourced {{largely from}} Beckerman's book. The Ephrons wove {{together}} {{a collection of}} stories adapted from the book with recollections of friends, including Rosie O'Donnell.

5|$|A dance-oriented song, it lyrically {{portrays a}} scorned woman seeking revenge on her lover. Police sirens, whispered vocals, {{throbbing}} beats and a dubstep breakdown provide the song with a suspense-filled atmosphere. The song received critical acclaim, most calling it <b>a</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>of</b> the album {{and also the}} boldest track of the album. Some even hailed {{it as one of}} Madonna's best songs.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the year, Lindwall gained his Leaving Certificate. This {{made him}} {{eligible}} to study at university, but this clashed with his desire to play sport and earn money to help support his parentless family. He thus took an office job with Commercial Steel and Forge Company, which manufactured aeroplane parts and bomb fuses. During the 1939–40 season, Lindwall's bowling was only moderately successful, with 16 wickets at 34.93. <b>A</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>of</b> the season was an unbeaten 49 as St. George won the grade final.|$|E

Kyo Maru II had developed boiler problems while returning from the Antarctic and was drifting towards the Houtman Abrolhos Archipelago, where she {{was in danger of}} being wrecked by the reefs in the area. Centaur responded to the distress signal and towed Kyo Maru II to Geraldton.|$|E

5|$|In some {{countries}} <b>a</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>of</b> {{the year for}} Scouts is spending {{at least a week}} in the summer engaging in an outdoor activity. This can be a camping, hiking, sailing, or other trip with the unit, or a summer camp with broader participation (at the council, state, or provincial level). Scouts attending a summer camp work on Scout badges, advancement, and perfecting Scoutcraft skills. Summer camps can operate specialty programs for older Scouts, such as sailing, backpacking, canoeing and whitewater, caving, and fishing.|$|E

Jolie portrayed Wallace's second wife, Cornelia, a performance Lee Winfrey of The Philadelphia Inquirer considered <b>a</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>of</b> the film. George Wallace was very well received by critics and won, among other awards, the Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film.

5|$|The Round Church was {{unmatched}} in its ceramic decoration by any {{church in}} Preslav, {{and was the}} only known building {{in the city to}} rely heavily on polychrome ceramic tiles. Ceramic and mosaic icons were <b>a</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>of</b> the interior; they ranged in size from almost life-sized to miniature. While the ceramic images were constructed out of clay tiles, the mosaic icons were more varied in their material, which included clay, glass, and stone of various shades on a gold-coloured background. Among the portrayed saints and biblical figures are Charalampus and perhaps Joel. Some of the images were enclosed in ellipses.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{initially}} released for Microsoft Windows {{at the start}} of 2011 via Zachtronics' own website. Though it was initially rejected for sale on the Steam platform, Valve later offered to sell the game after it received high praise from game journalists; further attention came from the game's release alongside one of the Humble Indie Bundles. The game has since been ported to other computing platforms and mobile devices. Reviewers found the game's open-ended problem-solving nature as <b>a</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>of</b> the title. SpaceChem was incorporated into some academic institutions for teaching concepts related to both chemistry and programming.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>of</b> {{the series}} in 1959 {{was when the}} Russians allowed Moore {{to be the first}} Westerner to see the {{photographic}} results of the Luna 3 probe, and to show them live on air. Less successful was the transmission of the Luna 4 probe, which ran into technical difficulties and around this time Moore famously swallowed a large fly; both episodes were live and Moore had to continue regardless. He was invited to visit the Soviet Union, where he met Yuri Gagarin, the first man to journey into outer space. For the fiftieth episode of The Sky at Night, in September 1961, Moore's attempt {{to be the first to}} broadcast a live direct telescopic view of a planet resulted in another unintended 'comedy episode', as cloud obscured the sky.|$|E

5|$|After leaving Eton, {{he went to}} Magdalene College, Cambridge, on a music scholarship, and was {{expected}} to make music his career. <b>A</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>of</b> his undergraduate musical career was playing a two piano arrangement of Chabrier's España with Boris Ord, then organist of King's College, Cambridge. However, Chadwick chose to further his interest in Evangelical Christianity, which had existed from his school days. He graduated in 1941 and began his theological training in 1942, at Ridley Hall, Cambridge, being ordained deacon by the Archbishop of Canterbury, in Canterbury Cathedral, in 1943 and priest by the Bishop of Dover in 1944. He served a curacy at the Evangelical parish of Emmanuel, Croydon, arriving {{towards the end of}} the Second World War, as Croydon was attacked by German V-weapons, which provided a difficult pastoral challenge. From there, he became an assistant master at Wellington College. He married Peggy Browning in 1945, and they had three daughters.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 2000, Hi-5 have {{performed}} annually at Vision Australia's Carols by Candlelight in Melbourne, which are broadcast {{live by the}} Nine Network on Christmas Eve. The group perform a short selection of Christmas songs to entertain the younger viewers of the event, and are joined by Santa Claus, who was played for many years by Terry Gill, and Humphrey B. Bear. Several members have noted the shows as <b>a</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>of</b> {{their time in the}} group and over the years it became common for the performance to be the final concert of departing members. Hi-5 did not perform at the Carols between 2013 and 2015, and during this time, appeared at local Christmas events. Hi-5 returned to Carols by Candlelight in 2016 as part of their reestablished partnership with Nine.|$|E
5|$|Rare took greater liberties with {{violence}} and gore in Battletoads Arcade since {{the product was}} not destined for home consoles. It was Rare's first game to use the 3D graphics technology later popularized in Donkey Kong Country and Killer Instinct. Although the game playtested well {{and appeared to be}} financially viable, the publisher hesitated to release it. The game proved unsuccessful in the arcades and its in-production Super NES port was canceled. Retrospective reviews were more positive--Retro Gamer even declared it the best of the series. Battletoads Arcade received its console debut when it was emulated in the 2015 Rare Replay, a compilation of games from Rare's history for the Xbox One. Rare Replay reviewers were surprised by the quality of the arcade game and some considered it <b>a</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>of</b> the package. Battletoads Arcade remains the last entry in the Battletoads series.|$|E

5|$|The company's {{repertory}} in the 1960s {{combined the}} standard operatic works and less familiar pieces. The five composers whose works were given most frequently were Verdi, Puccini, Wagner, Mozart and Richard Strauss; {{the next most}} performed composer was Britten. Rarities performed in the 1960s included operas by Handel and Janáček (neither composer's works being as common in the opera house then as now), and works by Gluck (Iphigénie en Tauride), Poulenc (The Carmelites), Ravel (L'heure espagnole) and Tippett (King Priam). There was also a celebrated production of Schoenberg's Moses and Aaron in the 1965–66 and 1966–67 seasons. In the mainstream repertoire, <b>a</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>of</b> the decade was Franco Zeffirelli's production of Tosca in 1964 with Callas, Renato Cioni and Gobbi. Among the guest conductors who appeared at Covent Garden during the 1960s were Otto Klemperer, Pierre Boulez, Claudio Abbado and Colin Davis. Guest singers included Jussi Björling, Mirella Freni, Sena Jurinac, Irmgard Seefried and Astrid Varnay.|$|E
5|$|By 1929 Coward {{was one of}} the world's highest-earning writers, with {{an annual}} income of £50,000, more than £2,000,000 in terms of 2007 values. Coward thrived during the Great Depression, writing a {{succession}} of popular hits. They ranged from large-scale spectaculars to intimate comedies. Examples of the former were the operetta Bitter Sweet (1929), about a woman who elopes with her music teacher, and the historical extravaganza Cavalcade (1931) at Drury Lane, about thirty years in the lives of two families, which required a huge cast, gargantuan sets and a complex hydraulic stage. Its 1933 film adaptation won the Academy Award for best picture. Coward's intimate-scale hits of the period included Private Lives (1930) and Design for Living (1932). In Private Lives, Coward starred alongside his most famous stage partner, Gertrude Lawrence, together with the young Laurence Olivier. It was <b>a</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>of</b> both Coward's and Lawrence's career, selling out in both London and New York. Coward disliked long runs, and after this he made a rule of starring in a play for no more than three months at any venue. Design for Living, written for Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne, was so risqué, with its theme of bisexuality and a ménage à trois, that Coward premiered it in New York, knowing that it would not survive the censor in London.|$|E
5|$|During {{his rookie}} season, Kindt joined a backfield which {{contained}} quarterback Sid Luckman and George McAfee, the primary starter at halfback. That season Kindt rushed for 266 {{yards and two}} touchdowns on 61 carries. One of his touchdowns was a meaningless three-yard run while the game was out of reach, a 49–7 blowout against the Chicago Cardinals on November 23. The next season Kindt rushed for 189 yards on 54 carries and two touchdowns, as the Bears acquired former Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Lujack and Bobby Layne to join Kindt, Luckman and McAfee in the backfield. <b>A</b> <b>highlight</b> <b>of</b> the season happened against the Detroit Lions on October 17 when he had a 66-yard run for a touchdown in a 28–0 Bears victory. After running for 118 yards on 41 carries, an average of 2.9 yards per carry during the 1949 season, Kindt contributions to the offense were limited despite Layne getting traded to the New York Yanks, Lujack being injured and both McAfee and Luckman retiring. In his final six seasons, he only carried the ball 16 times for 13 yards and no touchdowns.|$|E
