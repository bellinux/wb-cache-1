The yield of the crude <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substances</b> and <b>antimicrobial</b> activity against the test microorganism also differed significantly when carbon and nitrogen sources in the fermentation media were changed. The antimicrobial activity was significantly high in yeast extract plus fructose [Pencillium expansum (46. 5 ± 2. 12 mm) and Escherichia coli (42 ± 1. 41 mm) ] and yeast extract plus maltose followed by meat peptone plus fructose.

50|$|The longest marine bivalve Kuphus polythalamia {{was found}} from a lagoon near Mindanao {{island in the}} southeastern part of the Philippines, which belongs to {{the same group of}} mussels and clams. The {{existence}} of huge mollusks was established for centuries and studied by the scientists, based on the shells they've left behind that were the size of baseball bats. The bivalve animal is a rare creature that spends its life inside an elephant tusk-like hard shell made of calcium carbonate. It has a protective cap over its head which it reabsorbs to burrow into the mud for food. The case of the shipworm is not just the home of the black slimy worm. Instead, it acts as the primary source of nourishment in a non-traditional way. The animal can reach a length of 1.5 meters (5 ft.) and a diameter of 6 cm (2.3 in.). It has the ability to reabsorb the shell when it needs to grow and burrow deeper into the mud. The K.polythalamia sifts mud and sediment with its gills. Most shipworms are relatively smaller and feed on rotten wood. Instead, the shipworm does not eat, they rely on a beneficial symbiotic bacteria living in its gills. The bacteria use the hydrogen sulfide as energy to produce organic carbons that feed the shipworms. The process is similar to the green plants' photosynthesis to convert the carbon dioxide in the air into simple carbon compounds during photosynthesis. Scientists found that K. polythalamia cooperates with different bacteria than other shipworms which could be the reason why it evolved from consuming rotten wood to living on hydrogen sulfide in the mud. The internal organs of the shipworm have shrunk from lack of use over the course of its evolution. The scientists are planning to study the microbes found in the single gill of the K.polythalamia to find a new possible <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substance.</b>|$|E
40|$|AbstractStreptomyces lunalinharesii strain 235 {{produces}} an <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substance</b> that is active against sulfate reducing bacteria, the major bacterial group responsible for biofilm formation and biocorrosion in petroleum reservoirs. The {{use of this}} <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substance</b> for sulfate reducing bacteria control is therefore a promising alternative to chemical biocides. In this study the <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substance</b> did {{not interfere with the}} biofilm stability, but the sulfate reducing bacteria biofilm formation was six-fold smaller in carbon steel coupons treated with the <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substance</b> when compared to the untreated control. A reduction in the most probable number counts of planktonic cells of sulfate reducing bacteria was observed after treatments with the sub-minimal inhibitory concentration, minimal inhibitory concentration, and supra-minimal inhibitory concentration of the <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substance.</b> Additionally, when the treated coupons were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, the biofilm formation was found to be substantially reduced when the supra-minimal inhibitory concentration of the <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substance</b> was used. The coupons used for the biofilm formation had a small weight loss after <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substance</b> treatment, but corrosion damage was not observed by scanning electron microscopy. The absence of the dsrA gene fragment in the scraped cell suspension after treatment with the supra-minimal inhibitory concentration of the <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substance</b> suggests that Desulfovibrio alaskensis was not able to adhere to the coupons. This is the first report on an <b>antimicrobial</b> <b>substance</b> produced by Streptomyces active against sulfate reducing bacteria biofilm formation.
