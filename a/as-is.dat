5|$|After {{delivery}} of the barium-lanthanum material to Los Alamos, it was stored in a dedicated building in the Bayo Canyon Site. At first, the mixture was used <b>as-is,</b> both barium and lanthanum together, but this led to unpleasant radioactive contamination that {{took a long time}} to disappear as the half-life of barium-140 is 12.5 days. Shortly after, the process was improved; barium was removed chemically, by double precipitation from a solution as barium sulfate.|$|E
5|$|Many beetles have {{beautiful}} and durable elytra {{that have been}} used as material in arts, with beetlewing the best example. Sometimes, they are incorporated into ritual objects for their religious significance. Whole beetles, either <b>as-is</b> or encased in clear plastic, are made into objects ranging from cheap souvenirs such as key chains to expensive fine-art jewellery. In parts of Mexico, beetles of the genus Zopherus are made into living brooches by attaching costume jewelry and golden chains, which is made possible by the incredibly hard elytra and sedentary habits of the genus.|$|E
5|$|During {{assembly}} of Collins bow section in Sweden, multiple defects in the hull welding were discovered. Different reasons were given by different parties for the problems: the steel alloy {{used for the}} hull required different welding techniques to those normally used by Kockums; the Swedish navy always requested partial penetration welds for their submarines, while the RAN wanted full penetration welding, but had not made this clear; delays in delivering the steel plates to Kockums resulted in rushed work and a resulting drop in quality. Kockums engineers proposed that the section be kept in Sweden for repairs, but to minimise delays it was accepted <b>as-is,</b> with repairs attempted at ASC during full {{assembly of}} the first boat.|$|E

25|$|In May 1960, the {{obsolete}} {{control tower}} at Eglin's Main base, a glass-enclosed cab, 15 feet square, supported by steel legs about 50 feet long, with steel cross-bracing, ladders and hand rails, was {{offered for sale}} to the highest bidder, announced by the U.S. Army District Engineer at Mobile, Alabama. The structure, offered on an <b>as-is,</b> where-is basis, was {{to be removed from}} the site not later than August 12.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1983, the MTA took {{a fresh look at}} the tunnel, {{considering}} every possibility between leaving it <b>as-is</b> (with its terminus in Long Island City), to the original 1960s plan, the cost of which was now estimated at $1 billion. Without some kind of connection {{to the rest of the}} Queens subway network, the line was expected to attract just 220 passengers per hour during the morning rush.|$|E
25|$|The {{section of}} what is now NY17C between Waverly and Owego was {{originally}} designated as part of Route4, an unsigned legislative route, by the New York State Legislature in 1908. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, most of legislative Route4—including from Waverly to Owego—became part of NY17. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY17 was left <b>as-is</b> from Waverly to Owego while NY17C was assigned to the portion of its current alignment east of Owego.|$|E
25|$|In the post-Reconstruction era South, lynching {{photographs}} were printed for various purposes, including postcards, newspapers and event mementos. Typically these images depicted an African-American lynching victim and {{all or part}} of the crowd in attendance. Spectators often included women and children. The perpetrators of lynchings were not identified. At one particular lynching, it is said that nearly 15,000 people were in attendance. Often lynchings were advertised in newspapers prior to the event in order to give photographers time to arrive early and prepare their camera equipment. After the lynching, photographers would sell their pictures <b>as-is</b> or as postcards, sometimes costing as much as fifty cents a piece, or $, as of 2016.|$|E

It was proposed that the section be kept by Kockums to repair the welds, but {{it was decided to}} accept the section <b>as-is</b> and repair the welds at ASC to minimise delays in the project.|$|E
25|$|<b>As-is</b> copying of the Borodino {{class was}} also deemed unsafe: Borodino {{and her sister}} ships, then nearing completion, turned out {{overloaded}} by at least six hundred tons. The NTC conservatively chose the middle road: enlarging the Borodino. NTC chairman Vice Admiral Fyodor Dubasov parted with ambitions and approved construction of a perfectly conventional battleship displacing 16,500 tonnes, armed with four 12-inch main guns and 8-inch secondary guns, {{at the cost of}} thinner armor. Nicholas II, determined to expand the Navy, endorsed Dubasov's choice without reviewing it in depth. Displacement of 16,500 tonnes effectively became a law, a universal constraint that ruled over any engineering and tactical considerations and that was never met in practice owing to poor design and project management.|$|E

The Brazilian government would only accept a monetary offer. Lacking this, the Ottomans were forced to find a loan. Fortunately for them, {{they were able to}} obtain one from French banker acting independent of his government, and the Ottoman Navy secured the Rio de Janeiro on 29 December 1913 for £1,200,000 <b>as-is.</b> As part of the purchase contract, the remainder of the ship was constructed with £2,340,000 in Ottoman money.

500|$|The library {{occupied}} {{a series of}} temporary locations during the 1920s–'40s. Construction began on Woodstock's permanent library building in 1959. It was dedicated on June 1 the following year, the fourth community library built by Multnomah County. Until the mid-1990s the library was maintained <b>as-is</b> with only regular maintenance, though capacity strained as public use grew and new technologies demanded additional shelf space. In 1995, the City of Portland's Bureau of Planning released the [...] "Adopted Woodstock Neighborhood Plan", which included a policy to improve the branch and its services. In 1996, the county adopted a $28 million bond measure to renovate some branches and upgrade technology throughout the system. Given multiple issues with the existing building, including structural problems and non-compliance with building codes, Multnomah County Library determined reconstruction was necessary. The library was demolished in January 1999.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of the Xbox One and {{transition}} of Phil Spencer {{to the head of the}} Xbox division in 2014, he and software engineering vice president Kareem Choudhry restarted the backwards compatibility program in relative secret within the company. Choudhry brought on previous engineers that worked on Trioxide, including Kevin La Chapelle, Jonathan Morrison, and Barry Bond, to restart the program. The team chose to start with Castle Crashers, which included Xbox networking features, to test backwards compatibility. Castle Crashers frequently crashed to a screen with alphanumeric codes, which La Chapelle was able to obtain from the game's developers, The Behemoth, which helped them to rapidly diagnose problems and fix the compatibility issues. Solving most of the major problems through Castle Crashers, the background compatibility team decided to let the program be announced at E3 2015 with plans to have one hundred titles available by the end of 2015. However, by E3, they still found problems with some games running at extremely low framerates. During the event, Morrison recognized that a fundamental difference between the Xbox 360 and Xbox One was its scheduling rate, and when they returned, Morrison's idea helped them to rapidly complete work to meet its promised goal by the end of that year. [...] Individual games still brought some difficulty, specifically Halo Reach, but this prompted the team to develop automatic tools that could be used to identify where Xbox 360 titles would be difficult to run <b>as-is</b> on the Xbox One and how to work around those; this further set up the potential to improve Xbox 360 games on the future iterations of the Xbox One, such as the Xbox One X to improve graphics support.|$|E

2500|$|Scorpions {{original}} [...] "full overhaul" [...] {{was reduced}} in scope. Long-overdue SUBSAFE work, {{such as a}} new central valve control system, was not performed. Crucially, her emergency system was not corrected for the same problems that destroyed Thresher. While Charleston Naval Ship Yard claimed the Emergency Main Ballast Tank Blow (EMBT) system worked <b>as-is,</b> SUBLANT claimed it did not, and their EMBT was [...] "tagged out" [...] or listed as unusable. Perceived problems with overhaul duration led to a delay on all SUBSAFE work in 1967.|$|E
2500|$|The trick {{would be}} to {{introduce}} a third color. For two colors one can aim at {{either side of the}} screen, but for three there is no [...] "third side" [...] that can be used. Baird's solution used a variation on his two-color system, using one side of the screen <b>as-is,</b> and patterning the other side with a series of horizontal triangular ridges. One gun, normally shown as red in most diagrams, fired onto the flat side of the screen, as in the two-color model. The other two guns were arranged above and below the ridged side of the screen, so they fired onto {{one side or the other}} of the ridges. These were colored green and blue. When all three guns fired, the image would be combined into a single display.|$|E
2500|$|Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com, despite {{generally}} {{liking the}} film (three {{out of four}} stars), had trouble with the film's central metaphor that conflicted with its message, stating that [...] " [...] is constantly asking its characters to look past species stereotypes, and not use species-ist language or repeat hurtful assumptions.... This all seems clever and noble until you realize that all the stereotypes about various animals are to some extent true, in particular the most basic one: carnivores eat herbivores because it's in their nature." [...] He ended his review pointing out that [...] "if [...] were a bit vaguer, or perhaps dumber and less pleased with itself, {{it might have been}} a classic, albeit of a very different, less reputable sort. <b>As-is,</b> it's a goodhearted, handsomely executed film that doesn't add up in the way it wants to." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{legislation}} {{to set up}} the referendums passed its first Parliament hearing on 12 March 2015 with a vote of 76 to 43.

During their public submission intake phase the RSA launched the [...] "Fight for the Flag" [...] campaign, also backed by New Zealand First, to reverse the question order and first ask if New Zealanders want a flag change. Labour MP Trevor Mallard presented a petition signed by 30,000 people to the Committee, asking for a keep/change question {{to be added to the}} first referendum, similar to the 2011 voting system referendum. During its second hearing in Parliament, MP Jacinda Ardern proposed an amendment so that the second referendum would only take place if turnout for the first referendum was at least 50%, as a way of ensuring majority rule and reducing costs if the public was apathetic. Ardern's proposal was voted down and the bill was passed <b>as-is</b> on 29 July 2015.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013 and 2014 the Navy {{conducted}} {{a review of}} various design alternatives for the LX(R), including: adopting the existing [...] design <b>as-is,</b> adopting a modified [...] version of the San Antonio-class design design with reduced capability and reduced cost, creating a brand new [...] "clean-sheet" [...] design, or adopting an existing foreign design. In early 2014, Huntington Ingalls Industries suggested {{a modified version of}} the San Antonio-class hull for the Navy's LX(R) amphibious warfare ship, which they designated as [...] "LPD Flight IIA". This design [...] modified the San Antonio-class by removing some of its higher-end capabilities, resulting in a design that had improved command and control features compared to the existing LSDs, half the medical spaces of the San Antonio-class, a smaller hangar for stowing two MV-22 tilt rotor aircraft, no composite masts, two main propulsion diesel engines instead of four, two spots for Landing Craft Air Cushion hovercraft or one Landing Craft Utility boat, and a reduced troop capacity.|$|E

2500|$|The underage {{depiction}} of Kasumi and a feature in Dead or Alive: Dimensions called Figure Modewhich allows players to capture {{images of the}} characters from all angles and store themwere linked to Nintendo's decision to not sell the game in Sweden, allegedly due to the country's strict child pornography laws. Hearing of the Nordic ban and that Dimensions was being sold in Australia with a PG classification, the Minister for Home Affairs Brendan O'Connor and the Australian Classification Board re-examined the game and revoked its classification, although Nintendo Australia assured the board that the game contained no material which could be considered child pornography. Upon re-submission, the game was awarded the stronger (but not age-restricted) M classification and was re-released shortly after. The game's cover art, which featured a high-kicking Kasumi, was slightly altered for the United States release. Reports indicating it was done to appease the ESRB appeared, but a Tecmo Koei spokesperson claimed that [...] "this whole thing is getting blown way out of proportion. The truth {{is that when we}} submitted the box art <b>as-is</b> from Japan, there were a few parties both internal and external who thought there might be some issue with the image. Nobody 'demanded' anything be changed, it was just pointed out. You have to pick your battles, and covering up that small bit of the image seemed to be harmless." ...|$|E
2500|$|Suzuki joined Sega in 1983 as a programmer. In {{his first}} year, {{he created a}} 2D boxing game called Champion Boxing for Sega's first home game console, the SG-1000. According to Suzuki, the {{executive}} staff at Sega found the game so impressive that they released it in arcades <b>as-is</b> by simply installing an SG-1000 into an arcade cabinet. He was promoted to project leader while still {{in his first year}} at the company. Then, Suzuki began working on another arcade game which would prove to be the big stepping-off point of his career. [...] "To develop this game," [...] Suzuki told G4TV, [...] "I rode on motorcycles a lot. [...] When we came up with the prototype (for the arcades), I would ride on that prototype bike for hours and hours every day." [...] His efforts culminated into the game Hang-On, released in 1985. Hang-On was a success as it broke new ground in arcade technology. It did not feature any traditional controls, as the movement of the on-screen avatar was dictated by the movements the player made with their body on the motorcycle cabinet. This began the [...] "Taikan" [...] trend, the use of motion-controlled hydraulic arcade cabinets in many arcade games of the late 1980s, two decades before motion controls became popular on video game consoles. Running on the Sega Space Harrier hardware, it was also the first of Sega's [...] "Super Scaler" [...] arcade system boards that allowed three-dimensional sprite/texture-scaling at high frame rates. The three-dimensional sprite/tile scaling was handled in a similar manner to textures in later texture-mapped polygonal 3D games of the 1990s. Suzuki stated that his [...] "designs were always 3D from the beginning. All the calculations in the system were 3D, even from Hang-On. I calculated the position, scale, and zoom rate in 3D and converted it backwards to 2D. So I was always thinking in 3D." ...|$|E
