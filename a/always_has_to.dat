25|$|The {{scope of}} {{practice}} of a German paramedic is not specifically {{defined by a}} decent law. Thus the allowed standard procedures largely depend on the local medical director and the employer. However, in life-threatening situations, a Rettungsassistent or Notfallsanitäter <b>always</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> perform autonomously first diagnosis/monitoring and all necessary ALS treatments until an emergency physician arrives. This includes airway management (clearing airway and oropharyngeal, subglottic and endotracheal intubation), intravenous cannulation and application of crystalloid solutions, basic medication (adrenaline, glucose, inhaled ß2 agonists/bronchodilators, rectal benzodiazepine, glyceryl trinitrate, analgetics) and resuscitation with an automated external defibrillator.|$|E
500|$|Alavés manager José Manuel Esnal praised {{his players}} despite their loss: [...] "Dortmund {{has seen a}} great final, and it was {{possibly}} the smallest team in the competition that made it great." [...] Esnal saluted his players for their character especially for equalising twice in the match: [...] "We played with pride and class to get the score back to 4–4 {{at the end of}} normal time, the result of that, however, was that we were half dead going into extra-time. But we're the same team as we were two hours ago. One side <b>always</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> lose a final, just as one wins." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{replace the}} [...] "Italian" [...] style of Trapattoni, Koeman wanted Benfica {{to have a}} [...] "Dutch" [...] approach; he said, [...] "A team like Benfica <b>always</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> play to win. In what I know of this team, we can {{perfectly}} play in a 4–3–3," [...] and that finding the right balance between offence and defence in the playing style mattered. Vital to his new formation, Koeman asked for more wingers, such as Andy van der Meyde, and Boudewijn Zenden, but Benfica did not sign them. Instead, he received attacking midfielders Diego Souza, Andrei Karyaka and Giorgos Karagounis. To improve Koeman's options up-front, composed of Nuno Gomes and Mantorras, Benfica tried but failed to sign Jon Dahl Tomasson. Koeman instead received Italian international Fabrizio Miccoli on loan from Juventus. In defence, Benfica added Brazilians Anderson, Léo, with Nélson [...] replacing Miguel, who moved to Valencia.|$|E

500|$|For {{over three}} decades, Victor has been romantically linked with Nikki Reed (Melody Thomas Scott). Nikki was {{originally}} {{from the lower}} walks of life, having been a stripper. After multiple failed relationships, she began a romance with Victor, who taught her about society. They {{fall in love and}} have a child, Victoria Newman (Amelia Heinle), and later a son, Nicholas Newman (Joshua Morrow). The couple are widely considered a supercouple within the soap opera media. The writers of The Young and the Restless detailed their characters to marry and divorce or depart from each other in some form or fashion in a continuous cycle, which is a take on the original supercouple formula. Soap Opera Digest relayed the beginning of the pairing's creation and their impact, described as an [...] "inspired decision", led to Victor and Nikki becoming the series' most successful supercouple. In an interview with Dose magazine, Scott said that the couple <b>always</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> get back together, but not without a challenge.|$|E
500|$|That night, at the Snakehole Lounge, Leslie is {{surprised}} and annoyed to find Ann partying {{on the dance}} floor instead of preparing for the job interview. Ann introduces Leslie to her latest boyfriend, local radio host [...] "The Douche" [...] (Nick Kroll). As Leslie and Ann become increasingly drunk from Snake Juice, Leslie insults Ann's current dating lifestyle. This prompts Ann to insult Leslie for moving too slow with Ben (Adam Scott), whom Leslie is attracted to. The fight escalates throughout the night, and Leslie ultimately claims she <b>always</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> keep Ann motivated or she would not go anywhere. Both declare it best that Ann not work with Leslie after all and they storm off. Meanwhile, the Snake Juice proves delicious and popular {{with the rest of the}} parks department employees, all of whom become extremely drunk, with the exception of Donna (Retta) who is the only one not drinking, claiming it's [...] "basically rat poison". Chris arrives to warn Tom that using government employees to promote his own personal ventures is a breach of ethics. He tells a disappointed Tom that he must sell his shares of the Snakehole Lounge if he wants to keep his job.|$|E

He reported as a correspondent to his Chinese readers that [...] "the average American is like a child; {{he has to have}} a new toy to play with, whether it is Radio City or a mahjong set, and like a child as well, he quickly tires of playing with it. The average American <b>always</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> have fun, and this fun is somewhat different from pleasure and even more different from true happiness".|$|E

[...] But I wouldn’t want to characterise this as a move to somehow just go along with society. [...] I think {{for those of us who}} believe in inclusion, that comes from a point of view that we really believe that Jesus was for inclusion; we believe that God is for inclusion; and we believe in a God of love. [...] And that’s fundamental to our faith and our understanding." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sir John {{was unable}} to get away during the Battle of Ypres to attend the Dunkirk conference (1 November) between Kitchener and Joffre, Foch and Millerand. [...] There Kitchener offered to replace French with Ian Hamilton, but Joffre declined, saying this would be bad for BEF morale and he worked [...] "well and cordially" [...] with Sir John. [...] Foch told Wilson of this (5 November). [...] French sent Captain Freddy Guest to {{complain}} to the Prime Minister, who refused to believe it, and both Asquith and Churchill wrote French reassuring letters. [...] French went to see Foch (6 November) {{to thank him for}} his [...] "comradeship and loyalty". This did not stop him writing to Kitchener (15 November) that [...] "au fond, they are a low lot, and one <b>always</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> remember the class these French generals come from".
