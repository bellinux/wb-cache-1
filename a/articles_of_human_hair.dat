The techniques for <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> modeling consist <b>of</b> explicit geometric models as well as volume density models. Recently, hybrid cluster models have also been successful in this subject. In this study, we present a novel three dimensional texture model called 3 D Fuzzy Textures and algorithms to generate them. Then, we use the developed model along with a cluster model to give <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> complex hairstyles such as curly and wavy styles. Our model requires little user effort to model curly and wavy hair styles. With this study, we aim at eliminating the drawbacks of the volume density model and the cluster hair model with 3 D fuzzy textures. A three dimensional cylindrical texture mapping function is introduced for mapping purposes. Current generation graphics hardware is utilized in the design of rendering system enabling high performance rendering. Aran, Medeni ErolM. S...|$|R

Engineered fiber, for example, glass, carbon and so on has high particular quality however their fields of requisition are restricted because of higher expense of creation. As of late there is an increment in enthusiasm toward common composites which are made by reinforcement <b>of</b> characteristic fiber. <b>Human</b> <b>hair</b> has solid malleable property; thus it could be utilized as a fiber reinforcement material. It gives great property at easier expense of generation. It additionally makes ecological issue for its deteriorations because of its non-degradable properties. To this end, an attempt {{has been made to}} study the potential utilization <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> which is economically and effortlessly found in India for making value added products. The objective of present work is to evaluate the mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> reinforced epoxy composites. The impact of fiber loading and length on mechanical properties like tensile strength, flexural strength, impact strength and hardness of composites is examined.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of curling hair {{is attributed to}} the fact that the mechanical properties of hair fibres depend on time, temperature and humidity. In this study the dependence of the viscoelastic behaviour <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> fibres on humidity is characterised in a bending deformation. An experimental set-up was used to perform bending relaxation measurements at different humidities. The relaxation data were fitted using a so-called ?stretched exponential equation?. The humidity dependence was incorporated by applying time-humidity superposition. Also, the influence of humidity on the initial E-modulus was found. The influence of humidity on the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> fibres could be modelled by using a general characterisation of the behaviour <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> fibres. The general characterisation is used to predict the recovery in a <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> fibre after curling.

40|$|<b>Human</b> <b>hair</b> is {{considered}} a waste material {{in most parts of}} the world and its accumulation in waste streams causes many environmental problems; however, it has many known uses. Preventing waste of such a material requires both addressing the problems in the current usage and developing its utilization systems at locations where they are missing. With focus on developing systematic utilization <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> waste, this paper first reviews the possible uses <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> gathered from large scale trades, local/traditional knowledge, upcoming innovations, and scientific research; along with the socioeconomic systems that have evolved around the known uses. Concerns and gaps in these systems are identified and possible directions to address these gaps are discussed. For expanding hair utilization to new contexts, important considerations such as knowledge, skill, and technology requirements and potential markets are discussed. Finally, a policy framework for socially and environmentally healthy utilization <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> is outlined. This study shows that <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> is a highly versatile material with significant potential in several critical areas such as agriculture, medical applications, construction materials, and pollution control. Moreover, these uses are diverse enough for entrepreneurs ranging from unskilled to highly technical individuals and for the wide variety <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> waste available in different locations...|$|R

40|$|Full Paper: A novel <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> protein hybrid fiber was {{developed}} by combining (i) the high-efficiency extraction technique for preparing <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> proteins and (ii) the watery hybridization spinning method using gellan and chitosan. The resulting <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> protein-gellan-chitosan hybrid fibers are conveniently produced with by simply mixing the 7 - 35 % <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> protein– 1. 0 wt-. % gellan aqueous solution and the 1. 0 wt-% chitosan– 0. 15 M acetic acid solution at 50 °C, followed by pulling out to spin the <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> protein-gellan-chitosan ternary complex thus formed at the aqueous solution interface. By use of this simple procedure and ambient spinning condition, the <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> proteins were successfully incorporated into the fiber matrix of gellan-chitosan, without any denature and degradation. The hybrid fiber can be also recognized as a new type <b>of</b> the regenerated <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> keratin fiber, because of its high purity and content <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> keratin types I and II. Mechanical strength <b>of</b> the <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> protein-gellan-chitosan fiber varies from 108 MPa to 153 MPa, depending on the contents <b>of</b> the <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> proteins.

40|$|The hair cycle {{represents}} a dynamic process during which a complex mini- organ, the hair follicle, rhythmically regresses and regenerates. The control mechanism that governs the hair cycle ('hair cycle clock') {{is thought to}} be an autonomous oscillator system, however, its exact nature is not known. This thesis aims to understand the <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> cycle as a systems biology problem using theoretical and experimental techniques in three distinct study approaches. Using mathematical modelling, a simple two-compartment model <b>of</b> the <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> cycle was developed. The model concentrates on the growth control of matrix keratinocytes, a key cell population responsible for hair growth, and bi-directional communication between these cells and the inductive fibroblasts of the dermal papilla. A bistable switch and feedback inhibition produces key characteristics <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> cycle dynamics. This study represents the first mathematically formulated theory of the 'hair cycle clock'. A second chronobiological approach was adopted to explore the molecular control <b>of</b> the <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> follicle by a peripheral clock mechanism. The hypothesis was tested that selected circadian clock genes regulate the <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> cycle, namely the clinically crucial follicle transformation from organ growth (anagen) to organ regression (catagen). This revealed that intra- follicular expression of core clock and clock-controlled genes display a circadian rhythm and is hair cycle-dependent. Knock-down of Period 1 and Clock promotes anagen maintenance, hair matrix keratinocyte proliferation and stimulates hair follicle pigmentation. This provides the first evidence that peripheral Period 1 and Clock gene activity is a component <b>of</b> the <b>human</b> 'hair cycle clock' mechanism. Lastly, an unbiased gene expression profiling approach was adopted to establish important genes and signalling pathways that regulate the <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> cycle. This revealed that similar genes and pathways previously shown to control the murine hair cycle in vivo, such as Sgk 3, Msx 2 and the BMP pathway, are also differentially regulated during the anagen-catagen transformation <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> follicles. In summary, by using a three-pronged systems biology approach, the thesis has shed new light on the control <b>of</b> <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> follicle cycling and has generated clinically relevant information: a) The hair cycle model may predict how hair cycle modulatory agents alter <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> growth. b) Period 1 and Clock are new therapeutic targets for <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> growth manipulation. c) Gene expression profiling points to additional key players in <b>human</b> <b>hair</b> cycle control with potential for future therapeutic targets.
