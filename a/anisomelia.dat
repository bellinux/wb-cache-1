50|$|<b>Anisomelia</b> is a genus of moth in {{the family}} Geometridae.|$|E
30|$|In 1947, Blount {{proposed}} the revolutionary concept of instrumented, reversible epiphysiodesis with staples; this was applicable for both angular correction and length inhibition [7]. Problems inherent to stapling include migration, bending, or breakage of the implants, {{a reflection of}} the power inherent in physeal growth. During the ensuing decades, sophisticated technology and refined techniques, both simple and complex, have expanded our armamentarium for dealing with <b>anisomelia.</b>|$|E
40|$|Vertical or {{circumferential}} periosteal incisions {{were made}} over one tibia of anaesthetized rats, supplemented by localized periosteal stripping {{in two of}} the experimental groups. The rats were killed 5 weeks later and tibial lengths measured. Circumferential periosteal division plus periosteal elevation produced the greatest ipsilateral increase in tibial length. In this group of rats the alignment of cortical blood vessels provided evidence that sliding of the periosteum and a release of periosteal tension are associated with the gain in length. However, <b>anisomelia,</b> though not seen following vertical periosteal division alone, did occur after vertical division and periosteal stripping. This supports suggestions that both growth plate decompression and vascular phenomena influence skeltal growth rates after trauma...|$|E
30|$|<b>Anisomelia</b> is a {{clinical}} {{problem that is}} frequently referred to the pediatric orthopedist for management. The etiology is varied, ranging from congenital to acquired, {{and it may be}} characterized as static or progressive. The discrepancy may be localized in the femur, tibia, or both. The ilium and foot may also contribute to the overall measured discrepancy. Historically, scanograms were relied upon to provide accurate measurement. Computed tomography (CT) scan scout films are more accurate, but not universally available. The standing teleroentgenogram has emerged as the most popular assessment tool [1, 2]. This includes the pelvis and foot and allows for determination of the mechanical axis. More recently, the EOS imaging system provides simultaneous anteroposterior and lateral projection of the limbs, and may illustrate some of the rotational components.|$|E
40|$|Background. Pediatric giant cell tumor (GCT) of bone is {{rare and}} {{the course of the}} disease in the {{immature}} skeleton is sparsely described. We performed a retrospective study addressing symptoms, treatment, and outcome in children with GCT. Methods. Review of medical records and images of patients with GCT. Patients were detected from our hospital prospective database and those with open epiphyseal cartilages were included. Results. 16 children (75 % girls) from 6 to 15 years old were identified. Eight lesions (50 %) were in long bones and 4 (25 %) in flat bones. One lesion appeared to be purely epiphyseal. All patients had pain as the initial symptom. Local recurrence developed in 2 patients. 14 of 16 patients returned to normal activity with no sequelae. One patient developed <b>anisomelia</b> after surgery. Conclusions. The biological tumor behavior in children does not seem to differ from what is reported in adults. Lesions in flat bones are very unusual, but our data alone do not provide enough evidence to conclude that this is more common in the immature skeleton. Literature review showed only one previous case report describing a purely epiphyseal GCT. Intralesional curettage is appropriate treatment and gives good functional results with acceptable recurrence rates...|$|E
40|$|To {{develop a}} {{standard}} growth {{curve of the}} lower extremity in Korean children from 3 to 16 yr of age, the lengths from a total of 2087 normal long bone segments (582 femurs and 645 tibias in boys, and 417 femurs and 443 tibias in girls) were measured. Children were grouped by years of bone age, which was determined by using the Korean specific bone age standard; TW 2 - 20 method. The growth spurt occurred in girls from eight to eleven years by bone age, and in boys from eleven to thirteen years. The mean tibial length relative to the mean femoral length was 0. 78 in boys and 0. 79 in girls. The overall growth pattern {{was similar to that}} observed in American children in the 1960 s. Korean children and adolescents appear to have a different tempo of skeletal maturation during pubertal growth from that of English and American children and adolescents. The Korean standard growth curve and the Korean bone age chart allow determination of the presence of any existent growth abnormalities and prediction of future remaining growth in lower extremities. These normative growth standards can be used for leg-length equalization purposes in children with <b>anisomelia...</b>|$|E
30|$|In {{parallel}} with the evolution of hardware and techniques, improved methods {{have been developed for}} assessing skeletal maturity and estimating the optimal timing of surgical intervention. The Greulich and Pyle atlas and the Green–Anderson charts have been succeeded by such tools as the Moseley straight-line graph and, more recently, the Diméglio graph, and the multiplier method [8]. Historically, length inhibition has been recommended during the adolescent growth spurt, with hopes that a single operative intervention will suffice. When calculating “definitive” timing, modern algorithms represent important advances, but are still not without a margin of error [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. Consequently, with permanent epiphysiodesis methods [Phemister, percutaneous drilling, and possibly percutaneous epiphysiodesis using transphyseal screws (PETS)], over- or under-correction of <b>anisomelia</b> may still occur. Furthermore, asymmetrical arrest may result in iatrogenic angular deformity that can only be resolved by osteotomy. The advent of tension band plating (2004), which is predictably reversible, has allowed us to intervene earlier than heretofore contemplated, because the physis can be untethered upon correction of the discrepancy [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. This may be repeated, as necessary, depending upon the etiology of the condition and the ultimate discrepancy predicted. The concept of serial guided growth may be applied for both the ipsilateral angular deformities and to decelerate growth in the contralateral, longer limb.|$|E
30|$|For decades, {{the classic}} {{indication}} for limb lengthening has been reserved for <b>anisomelia</b> that {{was expected to}} reach or exceed 5  cm at maturity. Epiphysiodesis was reserved for discrepancies in the 2 – 5 cm range. With the increasing sophistication of fixators, including rail, hexapod, and hybrid, complex deformities may be corrected simultaneously while moderate to extreme lengthening is achieved. More recently, iterations of telescoping intramedullary rods have further strengthened our armamentarium. Meanwhile, permanent epiphysiodesis techniques, both open and percutaneous, have yielded to more versatile and reversible tethering of one (angle) or both (length) sides of a physis. While the techniques of guided growth and callotasis seem to be diametrically opposed, they {{may be used in}} a tandem or complementary fashion, {{for the benefit of the}} patient. If treatment is undertaken during skeletal growth, one must be aware that issues remain regarding the accurate assessment of skeletal maturity and prediction of the ultimate outcome. Therefore, there is potential for over- or undercorrection. Reversible and serial guided growth now enable the surgeon to commence intervention at a comparatively young age, for the purpose of optimizing limb alignment and reducing the ultimate discrepancy. Frame application may be delayed or, in some cases, avoided altogether. With the limb properly aligned at the outset of lengthening, elective use of a telescoping intramedullary nail may now be favored over a frame accordingly.|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVO: Avaliar os resultados do tratamento cirúrgico da Displasia do Desenvolvimento do Quadril na idade da marcha. MÉTODOS: Avaliamos 33 quadris operados entre novembro de 1992 e setembro de 1997. A média de idade foi 4 anos e 5 meses na ocasião da cirurgia e 11 anos e 7 meses quando avaliamos os resultados. O seguimento médio foi de 10 anos e 2 meses. Realizamos o encurtamento femoral, redução cruenta e osteotomia pélvica (Salter ou Chiari). Radiograficamente avaliamos: grau da luxação, índice acetabular; ângulo acetabular; arco de Shenton; linha de Hilgenheiner; coeficientes c/b, c/h, centro-acetábulo e cabeça-acetábulo; largura da cartilagem trirradiada; relação cabeça trocânter; esfericidade da epífise femoral; ângulo de Wiberg; necrose {{avascular}} e <b>anisomelia.</b> Os parâmetros radiográficos foram avaliados nos períodos pré-operatório, pós-operatório imediato e tardio. RESULTADOS: Verificamos estatisticamente melhora significante destes no momento pré-operatório para o pós-operatório imediato (p= 0, 0001) porém não houve variação significante entre o pós-operatório imediato e o tardio (p= 0. 5958). CONCLUSÃO: Pela classificação utilizada para avaliação dos resultados observamos 23 (69, 70 %) bons, 5 (15, 15 %) regulares e 5 (15, 15 %) maus resultados. OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate the}} results of surgical treatment of Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH) treated in the walking age. METHODS: We evaluated 33 hips in 30 patients operated between November of 1992 and September of 1997. The mean age was 4 years and 5 months at surgical period and the mean age at the last evaluation was 11 years and 7 months. The mean follow up time was 10 years and 2 months. We performed femoral shortening, open reduction and pelvic osteotomy (Salter or Chiari). Radiographic assessment considered: acetabular index; acetabular angle; Shenton's line; Hilgenreiner's line; the c/b, c/h, acetabulum-center and acetabulum-head ratios; {{the width of the}} triradiate cartilage; the trochanter and femoral head relationship; femoral head sphericity; Wiberg angle; avascular necrosis and leg length discrepancy. These parameters were measured and compared in pre-operative, early and late post-operative period. RESULTS: After statistical analysis we observed a significant decrease in these parameters from pre-operative period to immediate post-operative period (p= 0. 0001) and those have not changed between the immediate post-operative period and late post-operative period (p= 0. 5958). CONCLUSION: By the classification used we observed 23 (69. 70 %) good, 5 (15. 15 %) regular and 5 (15. 15 %) bad results. None of these radiographic parameters were relevant to predicting final results...|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVO: Medir radiograficamente através de escanometria o hipercrescimento femoral em pacientes portadores de Displasia do Desenvolvimento do Quadril inveterada tratados cirurgicamente com encurtamento femoral, redução cruenta e acetabuloplastia. MÉTODOS: Avaliamos 30 crianças (33 quadris) submetidas à redução cruenta pela técnica de Scaglietti e Calandriello, ostectomia para encurtamento femoral e acetabuloplastia de Salter. Haviam 29 do sexo feminino e 1 do sexo masculino, com idade média de 4 anos e 5 meses na ocasião da cirurgia. De acordo com a classificação de Zionts e MacEwen, 23 (69, 6 %) quadris foram classificados como tipo III, 5 (15, 2 %) como tipo I e 5 (15, 2 %) como tipo II. O encurtamento femoral médio foi 45, 12 mm (variando de 30, 00 mm a 80, 00 mm). O tempo de seguimento médio foi de 10 anos e 2 meses. A discrepância femoral média mensurada nos escanogramas foi 13, 48 mm (variando de 0, 00 mm a 60, 00 mm) após acompanhamento mínimo de 2 anos e 3 meses. RESULTADOS: Todos os pacientes evoluíram com hipercrescimento sendo que em 18 (54, 6 %) casos a <b>anisomelia</b> observada foi 30 mm. CONCLUSÃO: Observamos diminuição significante na diferença entre os comprimentos femorais após tratamento cirúrgico comparando com as medidas obtidas durante o seguimento ambulatorial. OBJECTIVE: To measure femoral {{overgrowth}} using radiographic scanning {{in patients}} with long-established Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip treated with femoral shaft shortening, open reduction and acetabuloplasty. METHODS: We studied 30 children (33 hips) submitted to surgical treatment including femoral shaft shortening, open reduction according to Scaglietti & Calandriello's procedure and Salter acetabuloplasty without preliminary traction. There were 29 females and 1 male, with mean age = 4 years and 5 months {{at the time of}} operation. According to Zionts & MacEwen's classification, 23 hips were classified as type III (69. 6 %), 5 (15. 2 %) as type I and 5 (15. 2 %) as type II. The average femoral shortening was 45. 12 mm (range: 30. 00 mm to 80. 00 mm). The mean follow-up time was 10 years and 2 months (range: 2 years and 3 months to 18 years) and we noticed a mean femoral discrepancy of 13. 48 mm (range: 0. 00 mm to 60. 00 mm) using plain scanning images. RESULTS: All patients evolved to femoral overgrowth; in 18 cases (54. 6 %), the leg length discrepancy found was 30 mm. Conclusion: We noticed a significantly decreased discrepancy of femurs after surgical treatment when compared to the measurements obtained during outpatient follow-up...|$|E
40|$|CONTEXTUALIZAÇÃO: A avaliação {{postural}} bem como a mensuração da amplitude articular são instrumentos fundamentais para o diagnóstico, planejamento e acompanhamento da evolução e dos resultados de um tratamento fisioterapêutico. Elas podem ser realizadas tanto pela goniometria - método mais utilizado na clínica fisioterapêutica - como, com o avanço tecnológico, pela fotogrametria. OBJETIVOS: Verificar a confiabilidade paralela da fotogrametria computadorizada, utilizando dois softwares, o Corel Draw e o SAPo, em relação à goniometria para quatro ângulos nos membros inferiores. CASUÍSTICA E MÉTODOS:Foram estudados 26 voluntários de ambos os sexos, assintomáticos, com idade entre 18 e 45 anos, sem <b>anisomelia</b> de membros inferiores maior que 1 cm. Foram mensurados os ângulos tíbio-társico (TT), de flexo/extensão do joelho (flex/ext), ângulo Q (Q) e ângulo do retropé, inicialmente, com um goniômetro manual e, posteriormente, pela fotogrametria digital por meio dos softwares Corel Draw v. 12 e SAPo v. 0. 63. RESULTADOS: Os ângulos TT (p= 0, 9991), do retropé (p= 0, 2159) e de flexo/extensão do joelho (p= 0, 4027) não foram estatisticamente diferentes entre os 3 métodos de avaliação. Já o ângulo Q foi significativamente diferente entre a goniometria e os dois softwares usados na fotogrametria (p= 0, 0067), embora os valores obtidos pelos mesmos não tenham diferido entre si (p= 0, 9920), demonstrando que os resultados da fotogrametria não foram influenciados pelos softwares utilizados. CONCLUSÃO: Para os ângulos avaliados em sujeitos jovens assintomáticos, a fotogrametria computadorizada é confiável paralelamente à goniometria, exceto para o ângulo Q. Portanto, na clínica fisioterapêutica, deve-se ter cautela no uso de medidas de ângulo Q provenientes de diferentes métodos de avaliação postural. BACKGROUND: Postural {{assessment and}} joint range-of-motion measurements are fundamental in diagnosing, planning and following up the evolution and results from physical therapy treatment. These {{can be done}} with the aid of goniometry the most common method in physical therapy practice - and also, through technological advances, by means of photogrammetry. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the parallel reliability of computerized photogrammetry, using two software tools (Corel Draw and SAPo), in relation to goniometry, in four angles of the lower limbs. METHOD: Twenty-six asymptomatic volunteers of both sexes, aged between 18 and 45 years, were studied. None of them had leg length discrepancy greater than 1 cm. The tibiotarsal angle (TT), knee flexion/extension angle (F/E), quadriceps angle (Q) and subtalar angle (S) were measured. The measurement was done first with a manual goniometer and then with digital photogrammetry by means of the Corel Draw v. 12 and SAPo v. 0. 63 software. RESULTS: There were no statistical differences between the three evaluation methods for the TT (p= 0. 9991), S (p= 0. 2159) and F/E (p= 0. 4027) angles. However, for the Q angle {{there was a significant difference}} between goniometry and the software used in photogrammetry (p= 0. 0067), although there was no significant difference between two software tools (p= 0. 9920). This showed that the photogrammetry results were not influenced by the software used. CONCLUSION: In these healthy young subjects, computerized photogrammetry showed good parallel reliability in comparison with goniometry, for all the angles evaluated except for the Q angle. Therefore, in physical therapy practice, caution is needed in using Q angle measurements coming from different postural assessment methods...|$|E
