Most Bandwidth Brokers use simple <b>admission</b> <b>control</b> modules, although there are also proposals for more sophisticated <b>admission</b> <b>control</b> according to several metrics such as acceptance rate, network utilization, etc. The BB acts as a Policy Decision Point (PDP) in deciding whether to allow or reject a flow, whilst the edge routers acts as Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs) to police traffic (allowing and marking packets, or simply dropping them).|$|E

DESIGN [...] Matched case-control study of insulin treated diabetic patients admitted to hospital because of hypoglycaemia during 1984 - 7, the period when human insulin was introduced into treatment. SETTING [...] Case <b>admissions</b> and <b>control</b> <b>admissions</b> were obtained from eight public hospitals within the Swiss canton of Berne and a second control group comprised members of the Bernese section of the Swiss Diabetes Association. SUBJECTS [...] 94 patients with insulin treated diabetes with a total of 112 admissions for hypoglycaemia during 1984 - 7 (case admissions), 182 patients with insulin treated diabetes seen in the same hospitals for reasons other than hypoglycaemia with a total of 225 <b>admissions</b> (<b>control</b> <b>admissions),</b> and 86 insulin treated diabetic patients who were members of the Bernese section of the Swiss Diabetes Association. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Type of insulin used at time of <b>admission,</b> glycaemic <b>control</b> as measured by amount of glycated haemoglobin or glucose concentration; severity of hypoglycaemia. RESULTS [...] Treatment with human insulin at admission was more common in cases than controls (52 / 112 (46 %) admissions v 77 / 225 (34 %); p = 0. 003). 116 out of 129 (90 %) of admissions taking human insulin had been transferred from animal insulin, mainly because of non-availability of porcine insulins. The ratio of rate of hypoglycaemia in those taking human insulin to the rate in those taking animal insulin was 2. 4 (95 % confidence interval 1. 3 to 4. 4). Other risk factors for hypoglycaemia were a history of hypoglycaemic coma (rate ratio of history to no history 3. 8, 2. 3 to 6. 4) and good glycaemic control (rate ratio of good to poor control 3. 9, 1. 4 to 7. 5). With multivariate analysis the increase in rate ratio associated with use of human insulin rose to 3. 0 (1. 4 to 6. 4). Comparison with the diabetes association controls also showed an increased risk associated with use of human insulin (2. 2; 1. 1 to 4. 8). CONCLUSIONS [...] Transfer of treatment from animal insulin to human insulin was {{associated with an increased}} risk of severe hypoglycaemia. Caution should be exercised when transferring diabetic patients to human insulin. Further studies are required to elucidate why this effect occurs...|$|R
