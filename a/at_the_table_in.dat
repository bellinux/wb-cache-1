25|$|Since the 1990s {{food has}} become a more {{important}} part of a pub's trade, and today most pubs serve lunches and dinners <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> addition to (or instead of) snacks consumed at the bar. They may have a separate dining room. Some pubs serve meals to a higher standard, to match good restaurant standards; these are sometimes termed gastropubs.|$|E
25|$|The dealer {{is chosen}} by various means, either by {{throwing}} dice (the highest total takes the east wind), by placing {{one of each}} wind face down and having each player randomly select one of these tiles or other house rule variations. Each player sits down at their respective position (called the wind position) <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> positions of an inverted compass: East is dealer, {{the right of the}} dealer is South, across is West and the left is North. The order essentially is counter-clockwise.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "peacocking" [...] element was not {{included}} into the script, but added to the episode during filming after actor Aziz Ansari mentioned to show co-creator Greg Daniels that he believed the character {{would be interested in}} pickup artist tactics like those outlined in Neil Strauss' book [...] Ansari and Daniels asked the wardrobe for something silly for Ansari to wear in the bar, and they tried about a half-dozen items before Ansari himself settled on the orange hat, which is actually a woman's hat. The two women Mark and Tom talk to at the bar were meant to mirror Leslie and Ann from the banquet. Although they do not resemble Poehler and Jones, the two women had the same color hair (brown and blond) and were seated <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> the same spots in relation to Mark that Leslie and Ann were seated around him at the banquet.|$|E

2500|$|In August 2015, Google {{announced}} that devices in the Google Nexus series {{would begin to}} receive monthly security patches. Google also wrote that [...] "Nexus devices will continue to receive major updates {{for at least two}} years and security patches for the longer of three years from initial availability or 18 months from last sale of the device via the Google Store." [...] The following October, researchers at the University of Cambridge concluded that 87.7% of Android phones in use had known but unpatched security vulnerabilities due to lack of updates and support. Ron Amadeo of Ars Technica wrote also in August 2015 that [...] "Android was originally designed, above all else, to be widely adopted. Google was starting from scratch with zero percent market share, so it was happy to give up control and give everyone a seat <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> <b>in</b> exchange for adoption. [...] Now, though, Android has around 75–80 percent of the worldwide smartphone market—making it not just the world's most popular mobile operating system but arguably the most popular operating system, period. As such, security has become a big issue. Android still uses a software update chain-of-command designed back when the Android ecosystem had zero devices to update, and it just doesn't work". Following news of Google's monthly schedule, some manufacturers, including Samsung and LG, promised to issue monthly security updates, but, as noted by Jerry Hildenbrand in Android Central in February 2016, [...] "instead we got a few updates on specific versions of a small handful of models. And a bunch of broken promises".|$|E
