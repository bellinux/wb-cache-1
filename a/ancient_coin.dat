25|$|Another {{method to}} {{determine}} whether a coin was plated was listening to the sound produced by dropping the coin onto a hard surface since if the coin was solid silver it would have a distinctive ring. Although this was done by contemporary merchants, it is not recommended that this method be used on <b>ancient</b> <b>coin</b> since the coin could be damaged, especially since over time silver coins can become brittle, if the silver begins to recrystallize.|$|E

As a joke, they sat down and wrote the screenplay for The <b>Ancient</b> <b>Coin.</b> This led to the first Bulgarian musical film, a 1965 co-production with East Germany. The then-fashionable Bulgarian singer Liana Antonova and the East German film star Manfred Krug appeared in the film. The music was by Bulgarian composer Petar Stupel.|$|E

5000|$|Malter sought more <b>ancient</b> <b>coins</b> to collect, {{research}} and use in school to help educate his students. His strong passion for learning {{as much as}} he could about <b>ancient</b> <b>coins</b> and then teaching what he had learned to his students made his ancient-history class one of the most sought-after courses in the entire school. In a matter of a few years, <b>ancient</b> <b>coins</b> had consumed his teaching duties and had steered him towards a new career. He quit his teaching job in 1961 and became a full-time classical numismatist. At the time of this move only a handful of individuals in the entire United States dealt full-time in <b>ancient</b> <b>coins.</b> [...] more than one hundred - and perhaps double or even triple that amount - ancient-coin firms dealt mostly via the internet, a method of selling <b>ancient</b> <b>coins</b> first started by Malter's firm in the early 1990s. Malter's auction catalogues, articles published in COINage magazine in the 1970s and 1980s, and various other scholarly works on <b>ancient</b> <b>coins,</b> antiquities and collecting have become much sought-after and respected by collectors and worldwide dealers alike.|$|R

6000|$|Thomas of Erceldoune, {{during his}} retirement, has been supposed, {{from time to}} time, to be levying forces to take the field in some crisis of his country's fate. The story has often been told of a daring horse-jockey having sold a black horse to a man of venerable and antique appearance, who {{appointed}} the remarkable hillock upon Eildon hills, called the Lucken-hare, as the place where, at twelve o'clock at night, he should receive the price. He came, his money was paid in <b>ancient</b> <b>coin,</b> and he was invited by his customer to view his residence. The trader in horses followed his guide in the deepest astonishment through several long ranges of stalls, in each of which a horse stood motionless, while an armed warrior lay equally still at the charger's feet. [...] "All these men," [...] said the wizard in a whisper, [...] "will awaken {{at the battle of}} Sheriffmoor." [...] At the extremity of this extraordinary depot hung a sword and a horn, which the prophet pointed out to the horse-dealer as containing the means of dissolving the spell. The man in confusion took the horn, and attempted to wind it. The horses instantly started in their stalls, stamped, and shook their bridles, the men arose and clashed their armour, and the mortal, terrified at the tumult he had excited, dropped the horn from his hand. A voice like that of a giant, louder even than the tumult around, pronounced these words:-- ...|$|E
