25|$|Surge - is {{the point}} at which the {{compressor}} cannot add enough energy to overcome the system resistance or backpressure. This causes a rapid flow reversal (i.e., surge). As a result, high vibration, temperature increases, and rapid changes in <b>axial</b> <b>thrust</b> can occur. These occurrences can damage the rotor seals, rotor bearings, the compressor driver and cycle operation. Most turbomachines are designed to easily withstand occasional surging. However, if the machine is forced to surge repeatedly for a long period of time, or if it is poorly designed, repeated surges can result in a catastrophic failure. Of particular interest, is that while turbomachines may be very durable, the cycles/processes that they are used within can be far less robust.|$|E

40|$|Single-blade {{centrifugal}} impellers {{for sewage}} systems undergo both unsteady radial and <b>axial</b> <b>thrusts.</b> Therefore, {{it is extremely}} important {{for the improvement of}} pump reliability to quantitatively grasp these fluctuating hydrodynamic forces and determine the generation mechanism behind them. In this study, we conducted component analyses of radial and <b>axial</b> <b>thrusts</b> of closed, single-blade centrifugal pumps with different blade outlet angles by numerical analysis while considering leakage flow. The results revealed the effect of the blade outlet angle on the components of radial and <b>axial</b> <b>thrusts.</b> For increased flow rates, the time-averaged values of the pressure component were similar for all impellers, although its fluctuating components were higher for impellers with larger blade outlet angles. Moreover, the fluctuating inertia component of the impeller with a blade outlet angle of 8 ° decreased as the flow rate increased, whereas those with 16 ° and 24 ° angles increased. Therefore, the radial thrust on the hydraulic part was significantly higher for impellers with high blade outlet angles...|$|R
30|$|This {{criterion}} was automatically {{controlled by}} defining an elasto-plastic behavior for the conduit walls as beam elements for the 2 D FE analysis. As {{the dead and}} live loads in the 3 D FE analysis cause <b>axial</b> <b>thrusts</b> and bending moments at both the x-y plane (P 11 and M 11) and the x-z plane (P 22 and M 22) so Equation 2 should be controlled in both directions. More details of the buckling control in both planes are presented in the following sections. However, the initial investigations of the different 3 D models revealed that the <b>axial</b> <b>thrusts</b> and bending moments at the x-y plane (cross section) are dominant to the x-z plane values, so they control the buckling of the structures.|$|R

Ball and roller bearings can also be used in configurations that are required to carry both radial and <b>axial</b> <b>thrusts.</b> However, rolling-element bearings lack the beneficial damping and shock-load capability provided by fluid-film bearings, such as the Babbitt.|$|R

50|$|Growth and {{development}} of the neighbourhood and surrounding localities largely followed the construction of roads that opened up the area. Sutanuti had no roads, except the pilgrim path extending across it from Halisahar to Barisha. Chitpur Road (renamed Rabindra Sarani) was developed along this path. It passed through neighbouring Bagbazar and Chitpur. Road construction picked up in the early 19th century. The Lottery Commission (1817) and its successor the Lottery Committee (1836) opened up the native parts of old Kolkata.

40|$|The dynamic {{response}} to operational maneuvers of spinning symmetric spacecraft with radial and axial booms was analyzed {{as part of}} the prelaunch dynamic analysis of the ISEE- 3 spacecraft placed in a halo orbit around an Earth-Sun libration point, and later renamed ICE when it was directed to fly-by comet Giacobini-Zinner. The results presented use simple spacecraft models, and frequently give predictions that are good and easily obtained when the results from using a general purpose multibody dynamics program were very time consuming to obtain. Deployment of radial booms, spin-up after partial deployment, stationkeeping, and trajectory changes are analyzed.

50|$|For both {{possible}} rotational directions, {{there exist}} two possible {{arrangements for the}} oppositely-oriented helical gears or gear faces. One arrangement is stable, {{and the other is}} unstable. In a stable orientation, the helical gear faces are oriented so that each axial force is directed {{toward the center of the}} gear. In an unstable orientation, both axial forces are directed away from the center of the gear. In both arrangements, the total (or net) axial force on each gear is zero when the gears are aligned correctly. If the gears become misaligned in the axial direction, the unstable arrangement generates a net force that may lead to disassembly of the gear train, while the stable arrangement generates a net corrective force. If the direction of rotation is reversed, the direction of the <b>axial</b> <b>thrusts</b> is also reversed, so a stable configuration becomes unstable, and conversely.|$|R

40|$|The {{complexity}} {{and variety of}} turbomachinery flow circuits created {{a need for a}} general fluid system simulation program for test data anomaly resolution as well as design review. The objective of the paper is to present a computer program that has been developed to support Marshall Space Flight Center's turbomachinery internal flow analysis efforts. The computer program solves for the mass. energy and species conservation equation at each node and flow rate equation at each branch of the network by a novel numerical procedure which is a combination of both Newton-Ralphson and successive substitution method and uses a thermodynamic property program for computing real gas properties. A generalized, robust, modular, and 'user-friendly' computer program has been developed to model internal flow rates, pressures, temperatures, concentrations of gas mixtures and <b>axial</b> <b>thrusts.</b> The program can be used for any network for compressible and incompressible flows, choked flow, change of phase and gaseous mixturecs.

50|$|Double {{helical gears}} and {{herringbone}} gears are similar, {{but the difference}} is that herringbone gears do not have a groove in the middle like double helical gears do. Double helical gears overcome the problem of <b>axial</b> <b>thrust</b> presented by single helical gears by using two sets of teeth that are set in a V shape. A double helical gear {{can be thought of as}} two mirrored helical gears joined together. This arrangement cancels out the net <b>axial</b> <b>thrust,</b> since each half of the gear thrusts in the opposite direction, resulting in a net axial force of zero. This arrangement can remove the need for thrust bearings. However, double helical gears are more difficult to manufacture due to their more complicated shape.|$|E
50|$|The moving steam imparts both a {{tangential}} and <b>axial</b> <b>thrust</b> on {{the turbine}} shaft, but the <b>axial</b> <b>thrust</b> {{in a simple}} turbine is unopposed. To maintain the correct rotor position and balancing, this force must be counteracted by an opposing force. Thrust bearings {{can be used for}} the shaft bearings, the rotor can use dummy pistons, it can be double flow- the steam enters {{in the middle of the}} shaft and exits at both ends, or a combination of any of these. In a double flow rotor, the blades in each half face opposite ways, so that the axial forces negate each other but the tangential forces act together. This design of rotor is also called two-flow, double-axial-flow, or double-exhaust. This arrangement is common in low-pressure casings of a compound turbine.|$|E

The resulting thread form has the same low friction properties as a square thread form but at about twice the shear strength due to the long thread base. This thread form also is easy to machine on a thread milling machine, unlike the difficult to machine square thread form. It can also compensate for nut wear using a split nut, much like the Acme thread form.|$|E

40|$|During <b>axial</b> <b>thrusting</b> of a spin-stabilized {{spacecraft}} undergoing orbital injections {{or control}} maneuvers, misalignments and center-of-mass offset create undesired body-fixed torques. The {{effects of the}} body-fixed torques, which in turn cause velocity pointing errors, can be reduced by ramping up (and then ramping down) the thruster. The first topic discussed in this thesis derives closed-form solutions for the angular velocity, Euler angles, inertial velocity, and inertial displacement solutions with nonzero initial conditions. Using the closed-form solutions, the effect of variations in the spin-axis moment of inertia and spin-rate on the spacecraft velocity pointing error are shown. The analytical solutions closely match numerical simulations. The next topic considers various ramp-up profiles (including parabolic, cosine, logarithmic, exponential, and cubic) to heuristically find a suboptimal solution to reduce the velocity pointing error. Some of the considered cosine, logarithmic, exponential, parabolic, and cubic profiles drive the velocity pointing error to nearly zero and hence qualify as effective solutions. The third topic examines a large tethered spacecraft that produces artificial gravity with the propulsion system {{on one end of}} the tether. Instead of thrusting through the center of mass, the offset thrust occurs at an angle to the tether which is held in the desired direction by changing the spin rate to compensate for decreasing propellant mass. The dynamics and control laws of the system are derived for constant, time-varying, planar, and non-planar thrust as well as spin-up maneuvers. The final topic discusses how the Bodewadt solution of a self-excited rigid body is unable to accurately predict the motion compared to a numerical integration of the equations of motion. ...|$|R
