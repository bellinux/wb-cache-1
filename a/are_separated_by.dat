5|$|All erosion types took {{advantage}} of preexisting weaknesses in the rock such as rock type, amount of lithification, {{and the presence of}} cracks or joints in the rock. Basalt flows concentrated in valleys but subsequent erosion removed sedimentary rock that once stood at higher elevations. The resulting inverted relief consists of ridges capped by basalt which <b>are</b> <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> adjacent drainages.|$|E
5|$|Among the actinides, thorium and uranium are {{the easiest}} to isolate. Thorium is {{extracted}} mostly from monazite: thorium pyrophosphate (ThP2O7) is reacted with nitric acid, and the produced thorium nitrate treated with tributyl phosphate.

5|$|The {{constellation}} is home {{to several}} double stars, including Epsilon, Lambda, and Pi Arietis. ε Arietis is a binary star with two white components. The primary is of magnitude 5.2 and the secondary is of magnitude 5.5. The system is 290 light-years from Earth. Its overall magnitude is 4.63, and the primary has an absolute magnitude of 1.4. Its spectral class is A2. The two components <b>are</b> <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> 1.5 arcseconds. λ Arietis is a wide double star with a white-hued primary and a yellow-hued secondary. The primary is of magnitude 4.8 and the secondary is of magnitude 7.3. The primary is 129 light-years from Earth. It has an absolute magnitude of 1.7 and a spectral class of F0. The two components <b>are</b> <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> 36 arcseconds at an angle of 50°; the two stars are located 0.5° east of 7 Arietis. π Arietis is a close binary star with a blue-white primary and a white secondary. The primary is of magnitude 5.3 and the secondary is of magnitude 8.5. The primary is 776 light-years from Earth. The primary itself is a wide double star with a separation of 25.2 arcseconds; the tertiary has a magnitude of 10.8.

5|$|Alternatively, recent {{excavations}} {{have yielded}} seals of Neferhotep's brother Sobekhotep IV in proximity with seals {{of the powerful}} Hyksos king Khyan of the 15th Dynasty (c.16501550 BC) in a closed archaeological context, possibly indicating that the two were contemporary. If this is so, Neferhotep I would have been contemporary with either Khyan {{or one of his}} predecessors, such as Sakir-Har, and would not have reigned over the Nile Delta.

More recently, Bolton have developed an enmity with Wigan Athletic, whose fans generally regard Bolton as their main rivals. Bolton fans maintain a mutual dislike with the fans of Tranmere Rovers, Burnley, and Wolverhampton Wanderers.|$|E

More specifically, if X is a homogeneous continuum, then no single point separates X. If the nontrivial subcontinua of X with minimal boundary contain precisely two boundary points, then these subcontinua can <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> a single point. However, if these subcontinua have finite boundary containing more than two points, then like X itself, they cannot <b>be</b> <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> a single point...|$|R

5|$|Repetitive diving {{occurs when}} two dives <b>are</b> <b>separated</b> <b>by</b> a short surface interval, {{during which the}} diver has not {{completely}} outgassed from the first dive.
