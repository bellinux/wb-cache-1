5|$|The goal of Espejo's {{first three}} works was the {{intellectual}} improvement of Quito. El Nuevo Luciano de Quito ridiculed the outdated educational system {{maintained by the}} clergy. Espejo argued {{that the people of}} Quito were accustomed to adulation and that they admired any preacher who could quote the Bible in a pompous and insubstantial way. Marco Porcio Catón exposed the ignorance of the pseudointellectuals of Quito. La ciencia blancardina, in which Espejo claimed to be the author of the previous two works, condemned the results of the clergy's educational system: ignorance and <b>affectation.</b> All three works caused polemic.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the <b>affectation</b> of his hyphenated surname, Fleetwood-Smith usually listed his year of birth as 1910 (thus reducing his age by two years) and propagated a story among journalists that he became a left-arm bowler when he broke his right arm during his youth.|$|E
25|$|At sea, {{it used to}} be {{that the}} ensign was flown from the mizzen gaff. When Bermudian sails came into general use, some skippers started to fly the ensign from two-thirds the way up the main-sail leech. Many {{consider}} this an <b>affectation</b> with the past. Others have taken to flying the ensign from a backstay. These are not good locations because the flag does not fly out well when hoisted raked forward.|$|E

25|$|The Doctor dons {{a pair of}} dark tortoise-shell {{rectangular}} frame glasses, an <b>affectation</b> (along with his signature footwear) borrowed from the Fifth Doctor. He also occasionally sports a pair of Red-Cyan 3D glasses, both as a joke and for practical reasons. The Tenth Doctor's costume became so popular that it has spawned numerous recreations (including a BBC-licensed replica of the Tenth Doctor's overcoat by AbbyShot Clothiers and a white/red version worn by Tennant when he co-hosted Comic Relief), and has been cited by costume designer Louise Page as the costume she is most proud of from her time on Doctor Who.|$|E
25|$|Ranetti's literature, {{redolent of}} Caragiale and Anton Bacalbașa, was mostly ephemeral in nature, and often {{referenced}} {{the politics of}} his native Mizil. His articles, fables, sketch stories and plays, with their critique of Francization and <b>affectation,</b> earned him a following in the general public, but were regarded by critics and scholars as dated, overreaching, or overall inferior to the Caragiale model. His satire often had very precise targets, including King Carol I and his courtier Ioan Kalinderu, politician George D. Pallade, and actor Ion Brezeanu. In addition to putting out original texts, Ranetti was a noted translator and dramaturge, who adapted works by Georges Courteline and Paul Gavault.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} of his later works was his study of William Shakespeare (1897–1898), which was translated into English by William Archer and was highly acclaimed. It was, perhaps, history's most authoritative work on Shakespeare not principally intended for an English-speaking audience. He was afterwards engaged in writing a history of modern Scandinavian literature. In his critical work, which extended over a wider field than {{that of any other}} living writer, Brandes was aided by a singularly charming style, lucid and reasonable, enthusiastic but without extravagance, brilliant and colored without <b>affectation.</b> In 1900 he collected his works {{for the first time in}} a complete and popular edition and began to work on a German edition, completed in 1902.|$|E

50|$|Ciborra {{goes beyond}} the typical {{characterisation}} of improvisation as situated, pragmatic and contingent action by referring to the existential condition of the actor (his “moods feelings, <b>affectations</b> and fundamental attunement with the situation”). By eschewing {{the notion of the}} actor as a “robot” adapting to changing circumstances he reintroduces the personal human aspects that shape our encounters with the world and shows how our <b>affectations</b> define the situation at hand and so shape action.|$|R
25|$|Throughout {{his life}} Mark Finch was boyishly charming and often masked his private {{depression}} with public bonhomie. His gently camp <b>affectation</b> would occasionally dissolve into tantrum socially but such outbursts {{were not part}} of his professional life, which was characterised by lively industry, incisive wit and a passionate affability. He delighted in wordplay and inventive imagery; he never stopped writing absurd narratives, and sharp observations of his surroundings. Such commentaries were sent to friends in small packages with brief covering notes or topped and tailed with the greetings and codas of more formal letters. Soon after his birthday each year after his first arrival in London he would often create an inventive calendar collage for the coming year. Similar publications became commercial products in the mid-1990s but Finch's creations were obviously amateur and intensely personal. They were photocopied, spiral-bound and mailed to friends as pre-Christmas gifts.|$|E
25|$|As for the ultra-orthodox Cubists such as M. Gleizes, {{they are}} {{becoming}} very tiresome. Someone who knows M. Eugène Figuière assured me that he saw a strong resemblance in M. Gleizes's portrait of that eminent publisher, who must, in that case, be made of gun-metal or some similar substance. It may be my stupidity, but I cannot understand what {{this sort of thing}} means or what the artist is driving at. There are a few other paintings which may, presumably, be called Cubist in default of any better name, which are merely patterns in bright colours, such as M. Picabia's and M. Metzinger's. One of M. Metzinger's pictures is a puzzle made up of a leg, an arm, a hat, a parasol, and various other objects, and is called En Canot. These patterns have certain decorative qualities and might do for a carpet or a hanging, but they are absurd in frames, and it is a mere <b>affectation</b> to give them titles.|$|E
25|$|As every individual, therefore, {{endeavours}} {{as much as}} he {{can both}} to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry, and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value; every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can. He generally, indeed, neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. By preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry, he intends only his own security; and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value, he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. Nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it. I have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good. It is an <b>affectation,</b> indeed, not very common among merchants, and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it.|$|E

50|$|Ellis' {{writing is}} of the Stanley Weyman school. His romances were pithy and understated, artfully {{avoiding}} the <b>affectations</b> and pretensions {{of many of his}} contemporaries.|$|R

500|$|Hazlitt also {{reflects}} on several other characters. Portia, for example, was no favourite of his, and [...] "has {{a certain degree}} of <b>affectation</b> and pedantry about her". Gratiano he finds [...] "a very admirable subordinate character".|$|E
500|$|In Varieties of Nostalgia in Contemporary Travel Writing, Patrick Holland and Graham Huggan {{observe that}} [...] "travel writing, like travel itself, is {{generated}} by nostalgia". But the [...] "anachronistic gentleman" [...] can only exist, they note, quoting Simon Raven, [...] "in circumstances that are manifestly contrived or unreal". The resulting [...] "atmosphere of enhanced <b>affectation</b> is exploited to maximum comic effect" [...] in books like A Short Walk, which they call [...] "an acclaimed post-Byronic escapade in which gentlemanly theatrics come to assume the proportions of full-blown farce." ...|$|E
500|$|He died {{suddenly}} {{at his home}} in Chichester on 28 February 1819. His obituary reported that he had gone to bed [...] "in good health, and was seized by a spasmodic <b>affectation</b> in his chest, which terminated his existence at 8o'clock". The Naval Chronicle declared that Admiral Murray's [...] disposition is so gentle, and his manners are so mild, that but few men are equally well beloved in the navy; while few possess the facility of commanding with such ease, and, at the same time, with such energy and effect. His wife Ann outlived him by a considerable number of years. She died in Boulogne in 1859, at the age of 95.|$|E
40|$|La Guira is an {{important}} community in Arroyo Seco popular council. It is surrounded by many other small communities to which it offers commercial, gastronomical and health services. Its main economic productions are coffee, among other crops. Present population is lesser than it was eight years ago, and teenagers tend to abandon secondary school. This situation worsens unemployment and hinders environmental preservation. Generally, people link the environment only to nature, and, in this sense, they identify the main global <b>affectations,</b> but {{are not able to}} see the <b>affectations</b> of their own community...|$|R
60|$|He {{could not}} {{understand}} that Mrs. Clibborn, whose <b>affectations</b> were manifest, whose folly was notorious, should alone have guessed his secret. He was tired of perpetually concealing his thoughts.|$|R

500|$|Hazlitt was {{particularly}} interested in Caliban, in part because others thought the character vulgar or evil. Though he is a [...] "savage", [...] "half brute, half demon", and [...] "the essence of grossness", Caliban {{is not in the}} least [...] "vulgar". [...] "The character grows out of the soil where it is rooted, uncontrouled, uncouth and wild, uncramped by any of the meannesses of custom [...] Vulgarity is not natural coarseness, but conventional coarseness, learnt from others, contrary to, or without an entire conformity of natural power and disposition; as fashion is the common-place <b>affectation</b> of what is elegant and refined without any feeling of the essence of it." [...] Stephano and Trinculo are vulgar by comparison, and [...] "in conducting [...] to Prospero's cell", by understanding the [...] "nature" [...] by which it is surrounded, [...] "Caliban shews the superiority of natural capacity over greater knowledge and greater folly." ...|$|E
500|$|Huntley {{describes}} [...] "The Answer's at the End" [...] as [...] "the {{first of}} the piano songs" [...] on Extra Texture. While piano and other keyboard instrumentation was typically favoured throughout the album, the song also contains multiple guitar parts, {{in keeping with the}} sound more usually associated with Harrison. Credited to Harrison, these parts comprise 12-string acoustic guitar, electric guitar arpeggios over the choruses, and a brief solo. During the quieter, [...] "isn't it a pity how..." [...] codas, Huntley notes [...] "the merest veneer of the strings" [...] accompanying Harrison's vocal. In Leng's description, Harrison [...] "semi-scats" [...] over these [...] "smoochy" [...] sections, [...] "gospel style, over sundown jazz piano" [...] – a vocal <b>affectation</b> that reflected his immersion in the soul genre. Following the first coda, the full band returns for the short instrumental break, after which Harrison repeats the choruses, with his singing increasing in emotion.|$|E
500|$|Ambrose {{and two of}} his {{brothers}}, Robert and Christopher, were educated by Jesuits at Saint-Omer, then in Flanders. [...] Both brothers became priests (Ambrose's elder brother, Henry, {{became a}} Franciscan), and his half-sisters Dorothea and Susanna became nuns. [...] Ambrose married into the Tyrwhitts, a prominent family of Catholics from Kettleby in Lincolnshire, and with his wife Elizabeth (cousin to Robert Keyes) had at least two sons, Robert and Henry. [...] According to the Jesuit Oswald Tesimond, Rookwood was [...] "well-built and handsome, if somewhat short", which he compensated for by his taste in extravagant clothing. [...] In author Antonia Fraser's opinion, this <b>affectation</b> was somewhat inappropriate at a time when [...] "clothes were supposed to denote rank rather than money". [...] On his father's death in 1600, Rookwood inherited Coldham Hall, which subsequently became a refuge for priests. [...] The following year he joined the Earl of Essex's abortive rebellion against the government, for which he was captured and held at Newgate Prison.|$|E

5000|$|... "On the Road Again" [...] catalogs {{the absurd}} <b>affectations</b> and {{degenerate}} living conditions of bohemia. The song concludes: [...] "Then you ask why I don't live here / Honey, {{how come you}} don't move?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{story is}} a spoof of Lovecraft's {{antiquarian}} <b>affectations.</b> Littlewit, the narrator, is born August 20, 1690-200 {{years to the day}} before Lovecraft's birthdate—making him nearly 228 years old as he writes a memoir.|$|R
500|$|The series {{revolves}} around Dexter (voiced by Christine Cavanaugh in seasons 1–2; Candi Milo in seasons 3–4), a bespectacled boy-genius who possesses a secret laboratory {{hidden behind a}} bookcase in his bedroom. The laboratory is filled with Dexter's inventions and can be accessed by speaking various passwords or by activating hidden switches on Dexter's bookshelf (e.g. pulling out a specific book). Though highly intelligent, Dexter often fails at what he has {{set out to do}} when he becomes overexcited and makes careless choices. Although he comes from a typical all-American family, Dexter speaks with a thick accent of indeterminate origin. Christine Cavanaugh described it as [...] "an <b>affectation,</b> some kind of accent, we're not quite sure. A small Peter Lorre, but not. Perhaps he's Latino, perhaps he's French. He's a scientist; he knows he needs some kind of accent." [...] Genndy Tartakovsky explained, [...] "He considers himself a very serious scientist, and all well-known scientists have accents." ...|$|E
500|$|Like Albert Einstein and Edward Teller, Feynman was a late talker, and by {{his third}} {{birthday}} had yet to utter a single word. He retained a Brooklyn accent as an adult. That accent was thick enough {{to be perceived as}} an <b>affectation</b> or exaggeration – so much so that his good friends Wolfgang Pauli and Hans Bethe once commented that Feynman spoke like a [...] "bum". The young Feynman was heavily influenced by his father, who encouraged him to ask questions to challenge orthodox thinking, and who was always ready to teach Feynman something new. From his mother, he gained the sense of humor that he had throughout his life. As a child, he had a talent for engineering, maintained an experimental laboratory in his home, and delighted in repairing radios. When he was in grade school, he created a home burglar alarm system while his parents were out for the day running errands.|$|E
500|$|In The New York Times {{review of}} the 1986 Broadway cast {{recording}} of Song and Dance (titled Bernadette Peters in Andrew Lloyd Webber's 'Song & Dance), Stephen Holden wrote that the recording was [...] "a personal triumph for a singer and actress who is rapidly establishing herself as {{the first lady of}} the Broadway musical. Performing material whose music borders on kitsch and whose lyrics and story suggest a verbose soap opera, Miss Peters nevertheless projects an astounding emotional generosity and conviction. Almost singlehandedly she turns the inconsequential erotic misadventures of Emma ... into a touching romantic fable about love and its defenses and the loss of innocence. ... Miss Peters has always oozed a cuddlesome Shirley Temple-like sweetness and vulnerability. This quality, which used to seem more like an adorable child-star <b>affectation</b> than a deep-seated trait, has proved to be an essential ingredient of Miss Peters's personality. [...] A delivery that once seemed coy and cutesy has deepened and ripened into an honesty and compassion that pour out in singing that is childlike but also resilient." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{suppose he}} is rather alarming,' said Dick. 'He's {{difficult}} to know, and he's obviously impatient with other people's <b>affectations.</b> There's a certain grimness about him which disturbs you {{unless you know}} him intimately.' ...|$|R
50|$|Scudéry's swashbuckler <b>affectations</b> {{have been}} rather exaggerated by {{literary}} gossip and tradition. Although possibly not quite sane, {{he had some}} poetical power, a fervent love of literature, a high sense of honour and of friendship.|$|R
6000|$|... "Have I? I'm so glad!" [...] said Anna, {{as simply}} as a pleased child; for real love had banished all her small coquetries, vanities, and <b>affectations,</b> as {{sunshine}} absorbs the mists that hide a lovely landscape.|$|R
