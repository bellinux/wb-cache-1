5|$|He {{proposed}} that the population of Milton Keynes should double in the next 20 years. He appointed English Partnerships to do so, taking planning controls away from Milton Keynes Borough Council and making EP the statutory planning authority. In turn, EP established a subsidiary Milton Keynes Partnership to manage the programme locally. Their proposal for {{the next phase of}} expansion moves away from grid squares to large scale, mixed use, higher density developments which are more based on assumptions <b>about</b> <b>public</b> transport than private car usage.|$|E
5|$|Icke {{combines}} New Age philosophical {{discussion about}} the universe and consciousness with conspiracy theories <b>about</b> <b>public</b> figures being reptilian humanoids and paedophiles. He argues in favour of reincarnation; a collective consciousness that has intentionality; modal realism (that other possible worlds exist alongside ours); and the law of attraction (that good and bad thoughts can attract experiences).|$|E
5|$|He {{authored}} {{books and}} law journal articles, particularly <b>about</b> <b>public</b> law in Malaysia and Singapore; {{some of the}} latter were collected into two works, Essays in Malaysian Law (1991) and Essays in Singapore Law (1992). In 1995, in recognition of his reputation and standing in the legal profession, he was appointed adjunct {{professor of law at}} the Centre of South East Asian Law at Charles Darwin University in Darwin in the Northern Territory, Australia. Until 2006, Hickling continued travelling to the Far East and Australia, delivering lectures, reviewing examination papers and visiting friends, colleagues and students. Despite his many accolades, he lived simply and impressed staff and students with his disarming humility. In addition to his legal writings, Hickling wrote novels and short stories, mostly drawing on his experiences of life in different British colonies. Hickling was appointed a Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George (CMG) in 1968 and a Queen's Counsel (Gibraltar) in 1970.|$|E

Houston would occasionally hire out some of his labor force. The first child born in the Texas governor's mansion was also the last of the Houston children; Temple Lea Houston was delivered on August 12, 1860. This last birth left the 41-year-old Margaret debilitated for almost two weeks, with a watchful Houston constantly by her side.|$|E
5|$|The {{publicity}} from Sanger's trial generated immense {{enthusiasm for}} the cause, {{and by the end}} of 1917 there were over 30 birth control organizations in the United States.Engelman, p. 92. Sanger was always astute <b>about</b> <b>public</b> relations, and she seized on the publicity of the trial to advance her causes.Kennedy pp. 84, 181.Engelman, pp. 92–93. In her memoirs, Sanger often understated or entirely omitted the contributions of fellow activists. After her trial, she emerged as the movement's most visible leader. Other leaders, such as William J. Robinson, Mary Dennett, and Blanche Ames Ames, could not match Sanger's charisma, charm and fervor.|$|E
5|$|Groups {{are often}} based on a single European {{political}} party such as the socialist group (before 2009). However, they can, like the liberal group, include more than one European party as well as national parties and independents. For a group to be recognised, it needs 25 MEPs from seven different countries. Once recognised, groups receive financial subsidies from the parliament and guaranteed seats on committees, creating an incentive {{for the formation of}} groups. However, some controversy occurred with the establishment of the short-lived Identity, Tradition, Sovereignty (ITS) due to its ideology; the members of the group were far-right, so there were concerns <b>about</b> <b>public</b> funds going towards such a group. There were attempts to change the rules to block the formation of ITS, but they never came to fruition. The group was, however, blocked from gaining leading positions on committees— traditionally (by agreement, not a rule) shared among all parties. When this group engaged in infighting, leading to the withdrawal of some members, its size fell below the threshold for recognition causing its collapse.|$|E
