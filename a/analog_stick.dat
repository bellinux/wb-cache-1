5|$|Like its {{predecessors}} in the Tony Hawk's series, Underground {{is centered on}} skateboarding {{in a series of}} levels. The player performs tricks via combinations of <b>analog</b> <b>stick</b> and button inputs. For example, the player initiates an ollie (a jump trick) by holding and releasing the jump button. During an ollie, the player may change the position of the <b>analog</b> <b>stick</b> and press one of two buttons to perform either a flip trick (such as an impossible or kickflip) or a grab trick (such as a benihana or nosegrab). The player can grind on certain edges and rails; different tricks may be performed during a grind based on the position of the <b>analog</b> <b>stick.</b> On quarter pipes, the player may execute lip tricks. While skating on flat surfaces, the player may manual in multiple ways via button combinations. Miscellaneous tricks include acid drops and wall-rides.|$|E
5|$|The Wii port of {{the game}} offers three {{different}} control schemes: Standard, using the Wii Remote; Sharp Shooter, which uses the Nunchuk's analog control to place the ball; and Control Freak, using the Nunchuk's <b>analog</b> <b>stick</b> to control the player's position.|$|E
5|$|Monkey Golf: One to {{four players}} take turns {{competing}} across 18 holes {{in a game}} of golf with stroke play scoring, or two players compete using match play scoring. The direction and general rolling distance of each shot is arranged with the <b>analog</b> <b>stick,</b> and the shot's strength is set by the A button.|$|E
50|$|The Grip-It is {{a rubber}} overlay for the <b>analog</b> <b>sticks</b> of the Nunchuk and Classic Controller. These items {{increase}} the overall thumb {{grip on the}} <b>analog</b> <b>sticks</b> and give them added cushioning.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The originally-unveiled Wii U GamePad prototype, {{featuring}} circle pads {{instead of}} <b>analog</b> <b>sticks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Other {{controllers}} instead {{have the}} two <b>analog</b> <b>sticks</b> in a symmetrical configuration with a D-pad on the left thumb position and face buttons at the right thumb position, with <b>analog</b> <b>sticks</b> below {{and closer to the}} center on both sides. Sony's PlayStation-series analog controllers - the Dual Analog Controller, DualShock, DualShock 2, Sixaxis, DualShock 3 and DualShock 4 - all use this configuration, with the remainder of the controller layout closely resembling the original digital PlayStation controller. The Classic Controller for the Wii also uses this configuration. The original configuration of the Wii U GamePad controller had twin analog [...] "Circle Pads" [...] positioned symmetrically above the D-pad and face buttons, but was reconfigured to have twin clickable <b>analog</b> <b>sticks</b> in May 2012.|$|R
5|$|The basic close combat from {{previous}} installments has been heavily refined and expanded into the CQC system. When unarmed or using a one-handed weapon, Snake can grab opponents {{and put them}} in a chokehold, at which point a variety of actions can be performed, such as choking the enemy unconscious, slitting the enemy's throat, or interrogating them at knifepoint to obtain information. The context, pressure applied to the button, and movement of the <b>analog</b> <b>stick</b> determine the action performed.|$|E
5|$|Ape Escape {{was officially}} {{announced}} in the April 1999 issue of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine. Promotions for the game were held on Cartoon Network during Sony's winter holiday marketing campaign of 1999. A remake of the game, titled Ape Escape: On the Loose, was announced on May 11, 2004, during Sony's press conference at the Electronic Entertainment Expo. It was released as a launch title for the PlayStation Portable (PSP) on March 24, 2005. The remake features altered controls, {{due to the lack}} of a right <b>analog</b> <b>stick</b> on the PSP, as well as some slightly different graphics and mini-games.|$|E
5|$|Monkey Fight: One to {{four players}} {{simultaneously}} engage in combat by rolling {{in any direction}} with the <b>analog</b> <b>stick</b> and using the A button to punch opponents with a boxing glove attached to their monkey's ball. Points are awarded for knocking opponents {{off one of the}} three available arenas, with more points being awarded when the player currently in the lead is knocked off. The player with the most points is declared the winner of a round when the in-game timer reaches zero. Items can be used to extend the reach, size, and strength of one's boxing glove.|$|E
50|$|The <b>analog</b> <b>sticks</b> are concave {{and lack}} the {{rubberised}} coating {{that has been}} used on the DualShock and later controllers.|$|R
50|$|In 1999, Sony's Ape Escape {{became the}} first video game in history to {{require the use of}} two <b>analog</b> <b>sticks.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{controller}} {{features a}} total of six digital buttons, two <b>analog</b> <b>sticks,</b> a d-pad and two hybrid analog triggers/digital buttons.|$|R
5|$|Moving {{from the}} PlayStation Portable to the PlayStation 3 allowed the {{development}} team {{to add more}} details to the character designs, additional atmospheric sounds, as well as slightly tweak the gameplay system, now allowing camera control with the right <b>analog</b> <b>stick.</b> In addition, the Mirage Arena (a multiplayer component from the original game) has been reworked to only be a single-player experience. Yasue said enemy strengths and AI in the arena were adjusted to account for this. The inclusion of the Final Mix version in the collection {{marked the first time}} for this version to be released outside Japan.|$|E
5|$|Super Monkey Ball is a 2001 {{platform}} party {{video game}} developed by Amusement Vision {{and published by}} Sega. The game debuted in Japan at the 2001 Amusement Operators Union trade show as Monkey Ball, an arcade cabinet running on Sega's NAOMI hardware and controlled with a distinctive banana-shaped <b>analog</b> <b>stick.</b> Due {{to the failure of}} Sega's Dreamcast home console and the company's subsequent restructuring, an enhanced port dubbed Super Monkey Ball was released as a launch title for the GameCube in late 2001, garnering interest as Sega's first game published for Nintendo hardware.|$|E
5|$|The game {{progresses}} linearly {{from one}} story event to the next, usually {{presented as a}} cutscene, though there are numerous side quests available that provide benefits to the characters. Players may also choose {{the order in which}} they tackle some areas. Most of the gameplay occurs on interconnected field maps where battles take place. Combat in Kingdom Hearts occurs in real time and involves pressing buttons to initiate attacks by the on-screen character. An action menu, similar to those found in Final Fantasy games, found at the bottom left of the screen provides other combat options such as using magic and items, although players can also assign selected magic spells that can be instantly used whilst holding the shoulder button. As players progress through the game, they can receive certain Disney characters as summons, such as Dumbo and Tinker Bell, each with their own unique abilities. There is also a context-sensitive option {{at the bottom of the}} menu, usually used for interacting with the environment or performing special attacks. This menu is manipulated by using the right <b>analog</b> <b>stick</b> or digital pad, while movement is controlled by the left <b>analog</b> <b>stick,</b> allowing the player to navigate the menu while avoiding or approaching enemies.|$|E
50|$|The Dual Analog {{controller}} {{has three}} modes of operation: Digital, which disables the <b>Analog</b> <b>sticks,</b> <b>Analog</b> (as also found on DualShock/DualShock 2 controllers) and a unique Analog Flightstick mode {{that is not}} available on the DualShock or DualShock 2.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Xbox One Elite controller, {{featuring}} two unique {{pairs of}} <b>analog</b> <b>sticks,</b> a new D-pad, and two differently sized pairs of paddles ...|$|R
50|$|Black S {{controllers}} with a transforming d-pad, concave <b>analog</b> <b>sticks</b> and bundled with a {{play and}} charge kit were released in October 2012.|$|R
5|$|Vagrant Story is a solo action {{role-playing}} game, {{in which}} the player controls Ashley Riot from a third-person perspective while exploring Leá Monde and the catacombs underneath. The player may also switch into first-person perspective {{to allow for a}} 360° view using the START button or right <b>analog</b> <b>stick</b> on the game controller. Characters and sprites are proportionate with each other, and the player navigates Ashley on a three-dimensional field map. Navigation is in real-time, and areas accessed by the player are stored in an in-game map menu.|$|E
5|$|Videoball is {{a minimalist}} sports video game by Action Button Entertainment. Up to six human and {{computer-controlled}} players form two teams. Each uses an <b>analog</b> <b>stick</b> {{and a single}} button to control triangles that shoot charged projectiles at a ball and other players. The objective is to knock {{the ball into the}} opposing team's goal. Apart from exhibition matches, the game has a scenario challenge-based Arcade mode, and supports online team and ranked multiplayer matchmaking. Videoball has a simple visual style with bright colors, basic shapes, and many customization options.|$|E
5|$|Wakeley saw Blast Corps as {{a puzzle}} game at its core. He was {{influenced}} by the 1994 Donkey Kong, in which the player begins each level with all the tools they need to finish but must learn how to use them. Wakeley said this was Blast Corp core game mechanic. He was also inspired by the Super Mario 64 demo at the 1995 Space World, which introduced him to the 3D <b>analog</b> <b>stick</b> and spurred him achieve something similar. The team's technical accomplishments included character and environment models composed completely of polygons and the absence of distance fog to obscure the draw distance.|$|E
50|$|The DualShock, {{like its}} {{predecessor}} the Dual Analog controller, has two <b>analog</b> <b>sticks.</b> Unlike the earlier controller, the DualShock's sticks feature textured rubber grips {{other than the}} smooth plastic tips with recessed grooves found on the Dual Analog controller. The DualShock also features two additional buttons {{when compared to the}} Dual Analog, L3 and R3, which are triggered by depressing the <b>analog</b> <b>sticks.</b> Other differences between Dual Analog and the DualShock include the longer grips/handles and slightly different L2/R2 buttons.|$|R
500|$|Like the Dual Analog, the DualShock and DualShock 2 feature an [...] "Analog" [...] button {{between the}} <b>analog</b> <b>sticks</b> that toggles the <b>analog</b> <b>sticks</b> {{on and off}} (for use with games which support only the digital input of the {{original}} controller). On the PlayStation 3 Sixaxis and DualShock 3 controllers, the <b>analog</b> <b>sticks</b> are always enabled. Beginning with the Sixaxis, a 'PlayStation button' (which featured the incorporated PS logo and is similar in function to the Xbox 360 [...] "Guide" [...] button) was included on controllers. The PlayStation button replaces the [...] "Analog" [...] button of the DualShock and DualShock 2 controllers. Pressing the PS button on the PS3 brings up the XMB, while holding it down brings up system options (such as quit the game, change controller settings, turn off the system, and turn off the controller).|$|R
50|$|The game {{makes use}} of the DualShock 2's <b>analog</b> <b>sticks.</b> The left is used for {{movement}} and the right for locking on to surrounding enemies.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the limited}} {{interface}} of the 3DS, {{as well as to}} take advantage of the touch screen, 3D has vastly unique controls when compared to other games in the Metal Gear series. While the game has been heavily criticized for these control changes, use of the Circle Pad Pro peripheral has been cited to alleviate much of the control issues of the 3DS. This is done by restoring camera movement to the second <b>analog</b> <b>stick,</b> adding ZL and ZR buttons for aiming and attacking, and allowing the face buttons to be used in a manner more in line with all other releases in the Metal Gear series.|$|E
5|$|Halo Wars is a {{real-time}} strategy (RTS) {{video game}} developed {{exclusively for the}} Xbox 360 console, in which players command armies from a bird's-eye view of the battlefield. The game focuses on military combat, but contains streamlined resource management and base construction elements. It was designed with the Xbox 360 controller in mind; for example, the A button is used for selecting units. A single tap of the button selects one unit, while a double tap selects all units of the same type. The d-pad navigates to current battles and cycles through bases, while the right <b>analog</b> <b>stick</b> adjusts the camera angle. A radial menu is used for base construction.|$|E
5|$|The {{object of}} Silent Hill 2 is to guide player character, James Sunderland, through the monster-filled town of Silent Hill as he {{searches}} for his deceased wife. The game features a third-person view, with various camera angles. The default control for Silent Hill 2 has James {{moving in the}} direction that he is facing when the player tilts the <b>analog</b> <b>stick</b> upwards. Silent Hill 2 does not use a heads-up display; to check James' health, location, and items, the player must enter the pause-game menu to review his status. Throughout the game, James collects maps, which can only be read if there is sufficient light or when his flashlight is on. He also updates relevant maps to reflect locked doors, clues, and obstructions, and writes down the content of all documents for future reference.|$|E
5000|$|The {{standard}} Zeebo [...] "Z-Pad" [...] controller {{includes a}} total of 7 buttons, a D-Pad and two <b>analog</b> <b>sticks.</b> On the right side, there are four buttons (numbered 1-4); two shoulder buttons rest on the top, called ZL and ZR; at the center, there is a [...] "Home" [...] button, which takes the user back the start screen of the Zeebo interface, while functioning as a typical [...] "Pause" [...] button during games. Directly below this button are the two <b>analog</b> <b>sticks,</b> whereas the D-Pad {{is located at the}} leftmost side.|$|R
50|$|Sega's <b>analog</b> Mission <b>Stick</b> was {{released}} for the Saturn console on September 29, 1995. On April 26, 1996, Sony released a potentiometer-based analog joystick {{for use in}} Flight-Simulation games. The Sony Dual Analog FlightStick featured twin <b>analog</b> <b>sticks</b> and was used in games such as Descent to provide a much greater degree of freedom than the typical digital joysticks of the day.|$|R
50|$|Castlevania: Lords of Shadow (Xbox 360, PlayStation 3) - Entering it at {{the load}} screen of a level (with <b>analog</b> <b>sticks)</b> and the player gets a cheat menu at the extras point.|$|R
5|$|Videoball plays as a {{two-dimensional}} hybrid of air hockey and soccer {{on a single}} screen. Players form two teams of one to three players. Each player uses an <b>analog</b> <b>stick</b> to control a triangle-shaped avatar and presses a single button to shoot triangle-shaped projectiles. The object {{of the game is}} to knock one or more circular balls into the opposing team's goal. Players hold the button to charge a shot, which fires upon release. The projectile can propel the ball, block other projectiles, and incapacitate opponents. Since the shot is triangle-shaped, it can only drive the ball for some distance before the ball veers off-course.|$|E
5|$|In Journey, {{the player}} takes {{the role of}} a robed figure in a desert. After an {{introductory}} sequence, the player is shown the robed figure sitting in the sand, with a large mountain in the distance. The path towards this mountain, the ultimate destination of the game, is subdivided into several sections traveled through linearly. The player can walk in the levels, as well as control the camera, which typically follows behind the figure, either with the <b>analog</b> <b>stick</b> or by tilting the motion-sensitive controller. The player can jump with one button, or emit a wordless shout or musical note with another; the length and volume of the shout depends on how the button is pressed, and the note stays in tune with the background music. These controls are presented pictorially {{in the beginning of the}} game; at no point outside of the credits and title screen are any words shown or spoken.|$|E
5|$|Many {{aspects of}} the {{gameplay}} were reworked for this sequel. Some changes were made due to user feedback and others {{were meant to be}} included in previous games but were omitted either because of time or technological constraints. The camera was switched to the right <b>analog</b> <b>stick</b> of the DualShock controller instead of the shoulder buttons and the Gummi Ship travel was reworked. The combat system was completely redone and did not use any animations from the first game. Because Sora had matured, Nomura wanted his fighting style to reflect that. Other changes included more integration between exploration and battles. The variations in combat styles associated with each Drive Form and the introduction of the Reaction Command were added to give players more choices in battles. The inclusion of worlds based on live-action Disney films was aided by technology that generated the character models from live-action pictures.|$|E
5000|$|Ore no Ryouri (俺の料理 Ore no Ryouri, [...] "My Cooking") was {{developed}} by Argent and released by Sony for the original PlayStation. Players must successfully manage different types of restaurants, utilizing the DualShock's <b>analog</b> <b>sticks</b> to perform various tasks.|$|R
50|$|Gamers {{have created}} {{makeshift}} inventions {{to help them}} in completing this time consuming task, such as positioning the <b>analog</b> <b>sticks</b> of the DualShock controller in a fixed position with rubberbands in order to automate {{the collection of the}} million roses.|$|R
5000|$|The DualShock {{controller}} was hugely supported; {{shortly after}} its launch most new titles, including Crash Bandicoot: Warped, Spyro the Dragon, and Tekken 3 included {{support for the}} vibration feature and dual <b>analog</b> <b>sticks.</b> Some games designed for the Dual Analog's vibration capability, such as Porsche Challenge and Crash Bandicoot 2, also work. Many games {{took advantage of the}} presence of two motors to provide vibration effects in stereo including Gran Turismo and the PlayStation port of Quake II. Released in 1999, the PlayStation hit Ape Escape became the first game to explicitly require DualShock/Dual-Analog-type controllers, with its gameplay requiring the use of both <b>analog</b> <b>sticks.</b> In 2000, when the PSone slim was released with the slightly redesigned DualShock Controller (SCPH-110), similar to the first one, except its color is white instead of gray, {{in the middle of the}} controller has the [...] "PSone" [...] logo, instead of the [...] "PlayStation" [...] naming, most of the buttons, <b>analog</b> <b>sticks</b> and the cord are brighter than the previous one, and the connector is more of a semi-circle shape than having round edge, it also came in colors.|$|R
