5|$|A {{bill was}} {{introduced}} into the Maryland General Assembly in 2012 which would <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> casino in Prince George's County. The two likely spots were National Harbor or Rosecroft. The bill passed the Senate, but the House did not vote on it. The bill was passed and signed by the Governor in August 2012 to <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> casino in Prince George's County, which was passed via referendum in November 2012. After one season of live racing, Penn National and Cloverleaf reached an agreement to extend live racing at Rosecroft {{for the next two}} years. The only exception is if National Harbor becomes the location for the Prince George's County casino.|$|E
5|$|As it {{has very}} large wing and tail {{surfaces}} to <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> stretch {{and a high}} empty weight per seat, its cost-per-seat advantage eroded, and the A350-1000 and 777-9 will match it.|$|E
5|$|ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 – three-letter {{country codes}} which <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> better visual {{association}} between the codes and the country names than the alpha-2 codes.|$|E
50|$|RT-11 was {{distributed}} with utilities which <b>allowed</b> <b>a</b> user to perform many actions. The utilities DIR, DUP, PIP and FORMAT <b>allowed</b> <b>a</b> user {{to manage their}} disk volumes. TECO, EDIT, and the visual editors KED (for the DEC VT100) and K52 (for the DEC VT52) <b>allowed</b> <b>a</b> user to create and edit source and data files. MACRO, LINK, and LIBR <b>allowed</b> <b>a</b> user {{to build their own}} executables. ODT, VDT and the SD device <b>allowed</b> <b>a</b> user to debug programs. DEC's version of Runoff <b>allowed</b> <b>a</b> user to produce documents. Finally, VTCOM <b>allowed</b> <b>a</b> user to connect with and use (or transfer files to and from) another computer system over the phone using a modem.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ho-ho! With us {{they are}} <b>allowed</b> <b>a</b> hundred! With us any good {{mechanic}} is <b>allowed</b> <b>a</b> cent a day! I count out the tailor, {{but not the}} others--they are all <b>allowed</b> <b>a</b> cent a day, and in driving times they get more--yes, up to a hundred and ten and even fifteen milrays a day. I've paid a hundred and fifteen myself, within the week. 'Rah for protection--to Sheol with free-trade!" ...|$|R
50|$|For a third {{straight}} season, <b>a</b> Canadiens <b>allowed</b> <b>a</b> fewest {{goals in a}} NHL (218), were a least penalized team (326 short-handed situations) and <b>allowed</b> <b>a</b> fewest power-play goals (58).|$|R
5|$|In general, most field events <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> {{competitor}} to {{take their}} attempt individually, under theoretically the same conditions as the other competitors in the competition. Each attempt is measured to determine who achieved the longest distance.|$|E
5|$|Some moulds allow {{previously}} {{moulded parts}} to be reinserted to <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> new plastic layer to form {{around the first}} part. This {{is often referred to}} as overmoulding. This system can allow for production of one-piece tires and wheels.|$|E
5|$|The London and Southwestern Railway (LSWR) became {{interested}} in using Cannon Street as a terminus, as it would <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> connection between Waterloo and the City.|$|E
5000|$|In general, if {{the real}} support <b>allows</b> <b>a</b> slope, the {{conjugate}} support must develop shear; {{and if the}} real support <b>allows</b> <b>a</b> displacement, the conjugate support must develop a moment.|$|R
50|$|All models had {{a ladder}} frame with two axles on semi {{elliptical}} leaf springs. A set back front axle <b>allowed</b> <b>a</b> wheelbase of only 9 ft, <b>allowing</b> <b>a</b> very short turn radius.|$|R
50|$|Crampton {{realised}} {{that the}} locomotives of the GWR {{were better than}} the standard gauge locomotives {{for a number of}} reasons. The broad gauge <b>allowed</b> <b>a</b> larger boiler diameter and higher centre of gravity for the same stability. Broad gauge also <b>allowed</b> <b>a</b> bigger firebox and heating area. Larger driving wheels gave a lower piston speed, which <b>allowed</b> <b>a</b> higher speed for the locomotive before exhaust problems occurred.|$|R
5|$|A {{variant of}} the {{extended}} version used in desert border patrol makes use of a high-ceilinged canopy to <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> swivelling rear-facing heavy machine-gun mount, while the canopy can be extended to provide a mobile command post. An air conditioned hardtop version of the extended model is often used by officers, and a version developed for riot control has clear polycarbonate shielding along the rear sides and roof, as well as gunports for less-lethal weapons. The shielding allows for a wide field of view {{while at the same}} time protecting against firebombs and rock-throwing.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature of}} the ball is its rubber layer; it was {{designed}} to <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> better response while retaining the impact energy and releases it in the coup. Its support material of cross-linked nitrogen-expanded foam improves its retention and durability of its shape. Polyester support fabric enhances structure and stability. The asymmetrical high-contrast graphic around the ball creates an optimal flicker as the ball rotates for a more powerful visual signal, allowing the player to more easily identify and track the ball.|$|E
5|$|At {{a meeting}} of the Hanseatic League in Lübeck in 1499, they applied once more to the bishop for {{permission}} to build a beacon. On 20 April 1500 Bishop Johannes III Orgas (John Orgies) agreed to <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> massive stone pillar without any openings. To cover the building costs, Tallinn city council had to establish a special lighthouse tax until the sum was complete.|$|E
50|$|On June 15, , in a {{game against}} the Toronto Blue Jays, Eyre <b>allowed</b> <b>a</b> 1-out sac fly run, ending his streak of 33 {{consecutive}} appearances without <b>allowing</b> <b>a</b> run, a Cubs franchise record.|$|R
50|$|October 9: With the 1-0 shutout over Wayne State, the Gophers {{have not}} <b>allowed</b> <b>a</b> goal in 180 minutes. Dating {{back to the}} 2009-10 season, Minnesota has not <b>allowed</b> <b>a</b> goal in 200:45 minutes played.|$|R
30|$|The Teager-Kaiser energy {{detector}} <b>allows</b> <b>a</b> 2 dB detection gain {{compared to}} the energy detection, while the frequency domain energy detector <b>allows</b> <b>a</b> 5.5 dB detection gain and outperforms the autocorrelation detection as discussed in [43].|$|R
5|$|At first sight, frogs seem rather defenceless {{because of}} their small size, slow movement, thin skin, and lack of {{defensive}} structures, such as spines, claws or teeth. Many use camouflage to avoid detection, the skin often being spotted or streaked in neutral colours that <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> stationary frog to merge into its surroundings. Some can make prodigious leaps, often into water, that help them to evade potential attackers, while many have other defensive adaptations and strategies.|$|E
5|$|Between June 1990 and 1998, Highway401 and Interstate75 {{were used}} for a pilot project named Advantage I-75 to test the {{reliability}} and versatility of an automated tracking system for transport trucks. Termed MACS for Mainline Automated Clearance System, it would <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> truck to travel from Florida to Ontario without a second inspection.|$|E
5|$|Brax {{said that}} {{personal}} data protection legislation needed to be adjusted to <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> freer access to information among professionals. She said that this had impeded {{the investigation into the}} Jokela incident, and meant that people in the teaching profession were left unable to help students to some degree.|$|E
25|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{techniques}} have been developed. Some techniques are qualitative - <b>allowing</b> <b>an</b> investigator to approximately determine a cell's chemotacic affinity for an analyte - while others are quantitative, <b>allowing</b> <b>a</b> precise measurement of this affinity.|$|R
50|$|Early Tessar designs by Paul Rudolph <b>allowed</b> <b>a</b> maximum {{aperture}} of f/6.3. Later development <b>allowed</b> <b>an</b> aperture of f/4.5 by 1917. In 1930, Ernst Wanderslab and Willy Merté of Zeiss developed Tessar lenses with apertures of f/3.5 and f/2.8.|$|R

5|$|Different AtPeps may <b>allow</b> <b>A.</b> thaliana to {{distinguish}} between different pathogens. When inoculated with a fungus, oomycete and a bacterium, the increases in AtPep expression varied depending on the pathogen. A. thaliana overexpressing AtProPep1 was more resistant to the oomycete Phythium irregulare.|$|E
5|$|During the 11th century, {{political}} rivalries divided {{members of}} the court due to the ministers' differing approaches, opinions, and policies regarding the handling of the Song's complex society and thriving economy. The idealist Chancellor, Fan Zhongyan (989–1052), was the first to receive a heated political backlash when he attempted to institute the Qingli Reforms, which included measures such as improving the recruitment system of officials, increasing the salaries for minor officials, and establishing sponsorship programs to <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> wider range of people to be well educated and eligible for state service.|$|E
50|$|At common law, {{substantial}} performance {{is an alternative}} principle to the perfect tender rule. It <b>allows</b> <b>a</b> court to imply <b>a</b> term that <b>allows</b> <b>a</b> partial or substantially similar performance to stand in for the performance specified in the contract.|$|R
5000|$|Autodesk's AutoCAD Map 3D and AutoCAD Civil 3D (which {{includes}} most of AutoCAD Map 3D's functionality) <b>allows</b> <b>a</b> user to rubbersheet vector data, and Autodesk's Raster Design (an add-in {{product for}} AutoCAD-based products) <b>allows</b> <b>a</b> user to rubbersheet raster data.|$|R
50|$|The ITDMA {{access scheme}} <b>allows</b> <b>a</b> device to pre-announce {{transmission}} slots of non-repeatable character, ITDMA slots should be marked {{so that they}} are reserved for one additional frame.

5|$|In 1942, {{not long}} after the invasion, Prime Minister Pibulsonggram assumed the post of {{education}} minister himself, and appointed ML Pin as Director-General of the Department of General Education. Although resources were limited due to the war, ML Pin was able to manage the budget and personnel to <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> countrywide 12baht salary for rural local schoolteachers. During his term, every province was provided with at least one upper-secondary school. He also became involved in frequent school migrations due to both the war and changing policy.|$|E
5|$|In May 2010, a bug was {{discovered}} by İnci Sözlük that could <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> Twitter user to force others to follow them without the other users' consent or knowledge. For example, comedian Conan O'Brien's account, which had been set to follow only one person, was changed to receive nearly 200 malicious subscriptions.|$|E
5|$|In {{order for}} this scheme to be accurate, the time step must {{be large enough}} to cause the curve to move by at least one pixel even at points of low curvature, but small enough to cause the radius of {{blurring}} to be less than the minimum radius of curvature. Therefore, the size of a pixel must be , small enough to <b>allow</b> <b>a</b> suitable intermediate time step to be chosen.|$|E
