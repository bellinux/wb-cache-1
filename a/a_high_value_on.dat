Attorney Dalia Gavriely-Nur, a lecturer at Bar-Ilan University, said that the camp opposing the prisoners deal is holding onto a view of collectivist society, {{in which the individual}} was expected to sacrifice himself for the good of society; the camp supporting the prisoner release is expressing, however, <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>value</b> <b>on</b> the sanctity of life, that symbolizes a shift to a more privatized society.|$|E

Drawing on and modifying Bourdieu’s forms of capital theory, it highlights areas of commonality and difference.

Significant differences emerge within categories of cultural capital with Chinese respondents placing <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>value</b> <b>on</b> more technical and UK respondents placing <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> <b>value</b> <b>on</b> personal and interpersonal skill components.

25|$|English {{contract}} {{law is a}} body of law regulating contracts in England and Wales. With {{its roots in the}} lex mercatoria and the activism of the judiciary during the industrial revolution, it shares a heritage with countries across the Commonwealth (such as Australia, Canada, India), {{and to a lesser extent}} the United States. It is also experiencing gradual change because of the UK's membership of the European Union and international organisations like Unidroit. Any agreement that is enforceable in court is a contract. Because a contract is a voluntary obligation, in contrast to paying compensation for a tort and restitution to reverse unjust enrichment, English law places <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>value</b> <b>on</b> ensuring people have truly consented to the deals that bind them in court.|$|E
25|$|Hawking {{attended}} Radlett School, {{an independent}} {{school in the}} village of Radlett in Hertfordshire, for a year, and from September 1952, St Albans School, an independent school in the city of St Albans in Hertfordshire. The family placed <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>value</b> <b>on</b> education. Hawking's father wanted his son to attend the well-regarded Westminster School, but the 13-year-old Hawking was ill {{on the day of the}} scholarship examination. His family could not afford the school fees without the financial aid of a scholarship, so Hawking remained at St Albans. A positive consequence was that Hawking remained with a close group of friends with whom he enjoyed board games, the manufacture of fireworks, model aeroplanes and boats, and long discussions about Christianity and extrasensory perception. From 1958 on, with the help of the mathematics teacher Dikran Tahta, they built a computer from clock parts, an old telephone switchboard and other recycled components.|$|E
25|$|Current {{guidelines}} {{are based on}} data for OPC as a whole, so that patients are generally being treated regardless of HPV status, yet many clinicians and researchers are considering deintensification. It is likely that treatment of this condition will continue to evolve {{in the direction of}} deintensification, in order to minimize loss of function but maintain disease control. In the absence of specific clinical trials and guidelines, patient preferences need to be taken into consideration to minimise short and long term toxicity and functional loss and optimize quality of life, given the prolonged survival frequently seen. This may involve exploring patients' values regarding trade-offs of disease control against adverse effects of treatment. Patients who have received CRT as primary treatment for OPC place <b>a</b> <b>high</b> <b>value</b> <b>on</b> survival, and although agreeing that deintensification is desirable, were reluctant to trade off much survival advantage for lower toxicity, though {{would be more likely to}} forgo chemotherapy than accept reduced radiation.|$|E

[...] Estimates of the average literacy rate in the Empire range from 5 to 30 percent or higher, depending in part on the definition of [...] "literacy".

They were often included in the price paid for land and in bequests and other gifts, and kings' servants included horse-thegns, or marshals. Numerous horses and horse-breeding establishments were recorded in Domesday Book, though many more horses were probably omitted, given the need for horses for riding and pulling carts.

Initially, the Emperor planned to assist the younger of the two brothers, Stephen, as claimant to the throne. Bribed by Emperor Manuel's envoys, most Hungarian lords were willing to dethrone the young monarch but instead of Stephen, whom they viewed as a puppet of the Emperor, Ladislaus was chosen to be king.

Queen Victoria urged her daughter to act encouragingly rather than reproachfully towards Charlotte, believing that she could not expect the young princess to share Vicky's tastes.
