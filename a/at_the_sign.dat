25|$|Edward White (c. 1548 – c. 1612) was a London printer and {{stationer}} {{whose career}} spanned {{a period of}} over forty years. His shop in the booksellers' district of St Paul's Churchyard was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sign</b> of the Gun, where he sold many anonymous works as well as works by Thomas Kyd, Robert Greene, Anthony Munday and Christopher Marlowe. Between 1594 and 1611 he sold all three quartos of William Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus.|$|E
25|$|King {{notes that}} the {{eighteenth-century}} definition for “publisher” could also mean “bookseller.” King is uncertain whether Haywood produced the books and pamphlets that she sold (as Spedding indicates) or {{if she was a}} bookseller, especially for Haywood’s early productions. Haywood sometimes collaborated on publishing matters in order to share the costs, as she did when she collaborated with Cogan on the publication of The Virtuous Villager. In any case, Haywood was most certainly a bookseller {{due to the fact that}} there were a great number and variety of works “to be had” <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sign</b> of Fame that did not bare her imprint.|$|E

25|$|For {{potentials}} {{which are}} bounded below {{and are not}} infinite over a region, there is a ground state which minimizes the integral above. This lowest energy wavefunction is real and positive definite – meaning the wavefunction can increase and decrease, but is positive for all positions. It physically cannot be negative: if it were, smoothing out the bends <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> change (to minimize the wavefunction) rapidly reduces the gradient contribution to the integral and hence the kinetic energy, while the potential energy changes linearly and less quickly. The kinetic and potential energy are both changing at different rates, so the total energy is not constant, which can't happen (conservation). The solutions are consistent with Schrödinger equation if this wavefunction is positive definite.|$|E
25|$|In 1714, {{he moved}} {{to work at the}} new theatre at Lincoln's Inn Fields, managed by {{entrepreneur}} John Rich. Remaining there for most of his career, he returned to his English repertoire and a new form, the musical Afterpiece. These lightweight works were often comic, and in 1716 Leveridge produced his own afterpiece, Pyramus and Thisbe. For this comic parody of Italian opera, he wrote the music, adapting the words from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, and sang the role of Pyramus. He was apparently absent from the stage around 1720–24, during which time he was occupied with the coffee house in Tavistock Street near Covent Garden, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> of 'The Harlequin and Pierot', which he held by lease from 1714 to 1736. However Rich drew him back, and Leveridge scored a success in 1726 in Apollo and Daphne with Silenus's song Tho' envious old age seems in part to impair me, composed by Johann Ernst Galliard. From that time forth he became the leading bass at Lincoln's Inn Fields and then at Covent Garden.|$|E
500|$|Peake {{was born}} to a Lincolnshire family in about 1551. He began his {{training}} on 30 April 1565 under Laurence Woodham, who lived <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> of [...] "The Key" [...] in Goldsmith’s Row, Westcheap. He was apprenticed, {{three years after the}} miniaturist Nicholas Hilliard, to the Goldsmiths’ Company in London. He became a freeman of the company on 20 May 1576. His son William later followed in his father's footsteps as a freeman of the Goldsmiths' Company and a portrait painter. Peake’s training would have been similar to that of John de Critz and Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger, who may have been pupils of the Flemish artist Lucas de Heere.|$|E

A {{few weeks}} later, a {{creature}} bearing {{a symbol of}} a skull shows up: a Skull Bearer, one of the Warlock Lord's [...] "winged black destroyers", has arrived to search for Shea.

Menion decides to accompany the two, and he travels with them to Culhaven, to meet with Allanon. While at Culhaven, they are joined by a prince of Callahorn, Balinor Buckhannah, two elven brothers, Durin and Dayel Elessedil, and the dwarf Hendel.|$|E
500|$|Nixon gave {{a speech}} from the rear {{platform}} of the train. He praised {{the size of the}} crowd, stating, [...] "There are four times as many people here than live in the town and more than the number that were here in 1960." [...] The candidate asserted that though his opponent, Vice President Humphrey, claimed that Americans had never had it so good, he should tell that to the farmer. Nixon pledged that he would give special attention to agricultural issues and would make the Secretary of Agriculture a farmer's advocate to the White House. He promised to restore order: [...] "The most important civil right is the right to be free from [...] violence." [...] He noted the many youths in the crowd, stating, [...] "Young Americans know their future is at stake. They don't want four more years of the same." [...] He recalled that his father had hailed from Ohio: [...] "his roots are here and mine are too!" [...] As Nixon spoke, Cole observed him, and thought he was a good family man, looking warm and friendly and appearing much as she expected him to. She later stated that she did not even look <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> until she was teased about it by a classmate, who suggested the sign, [...] "Bring Us Together Again" [...] was about boys, not politics. She kept the dress, but told the media she threw away the sign.|$|E

[...] This he did on 11 August at the East India House, giving details of his voyage and plunder on board the Fancy. In 1699, Dann married Eliza Noble and the following year became a partner to John Coggs, a well-established goldsmith banker, creating Coggs & Dann <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> of the King's Head in the Strand, London. The bankers (particularly Dann) were duped by Thomas Brerewood, one of their clients, and in 1710 the bank became insolvent. Dann died in 1722.|$|E
