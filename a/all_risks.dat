5|$|The {{giant otter}} is very {{sensitive}} to human activity when rearing its young. No institution, for example, has successfully raised giant otter cubs unless parents were provided sufficient privacy measures; the stress caused by human visual and acoustic interference can lead to neglect, abuse and infanticide, as well as decreased lactation. In the wild, it has been suggested, although not systematically confirmed, that tourists cause similar stresses: disrupted lactation and denning, reduced hunting, and habitat abandonment are <b>all</b> <b>risks.</b> This sensitivity is matched by a strong protectiveness towards the young. All group members may aggressively charge intruders, including boats with humans in them.|$|E

25|$|Libya has {{attracted}} hydrocarbon exploration since 1956, {{when the first}} wildcat oil well was drilled onshore in the Sirte Basin. Libya granted multiple concessions to Esso, Mobil, Texas Gulf, and others, resulting in major oil discoveries by 1959. In 1969, the Idrissid monarchy was overthrown in a bloodless coup led by Muammar Gaddafi. He eventually elaborated a new theory {{of the state in}} which all productive units and workplaces were to be directly governed by popular congresses. As part of his vision, the National Oil Corporation was established on 12 November 1970. The company’s first Chairman was Salem Mohammed Amesh, who was later replaced by Omar Muntasir. Under its articles of incorporation, NOC was legally restricted to Production sharing agreements (PSA) with international oil companies (IOCs) where the latter assumed <b>all</b> <b>risks</b> associated with exploration. In July 1970, further legislation made NOC responsible for marketing all domestic oil products.|$|E

40|$|Background: Recently, {{there have}} been a number of studies on the {{association}} between XRCC 1 polymorphisms and childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (<b>ALL)</b> <b>risk.</b> However, the results of previous reports are inconsistent. Thus, we performed a meta-analysis to clarify the effects of XRCC 1 variants on childhood <b>ALL</b> <b>risk.</b> Methods: A meta-analysis was performed to examine the association between XRCC 1 polymorphisms (Arg 399 Gln, Arg 194 Trp, and Arg 280 His) and childhood <b>ALL</b> <b>risk.</b> We critically reviewed 7 studies with a total of 880 cases and 1311 controls for Arg 399 Gln polymorphism, 3 studies with a total of 345 cases and 554 controls for Arg 280 His polymorphism, and 6 studies with a total of 783 cases and 1180 controls for Arg 194 Trp polymorphism, respectively. Odds ratio (OR) and its 95 % confidence interval (CI) were used. Results: Significant association between XRCC 1 Arg 399 Gln polymorphism and childhood <b>ALL</b> <b>risk</b> was observed in total population analyses (OR additive model = 1. 501, 95 % CI 1. 112 – 2. 026, P OR = 0. 008; OR dominant model = 1. 316, 95 % CI = 1. 104 – 1. 569, POR = 0. 002) and Asian subgroup analyses (ORadditive model = 2. 338, 95 %CI = 1. 254 – 4. 359, POR = 0. 008; ORdominant model = 2. 108, 95 %CI = 1. 498 – 2. 967, POR = 0. 000). No association was detected in Caucasians, Metizo and mixed populations. Ethnicity was considered as a significant source of heterogeneity in the meta-regression model. For the other two XRCC 1 polymorphisms, no association with childhood <b>ALL</b> <b>risk</b> was found...|$|R

2500|$|The {{likelihood}} that a threat will use a vulnerability to cause harm creates a risk. When a threat does use a vulnerability to inflict harm, it has an impact. In the context of information security, the impact is a loss of availability, integrity, and confidentiality, and possibly other losses (lost income, loss of life, loss of real property). It {{should be pointed out}} that it is not possible to identify <b>all</b> <b>risks,</b> nor is it possible to eliminate all risk. The remaining risk is called [...] "residual risk".|$|E
2500|$|With {{the risk}} {{assessment}} complete, the IA practitioner then develops a risk management plan. This plan proposes countermeasures that involve mitigating, eliminating, accepting, or transferring the risks, and considers prevention, detection, {{and response to}} threats. A framework published by a standards organization, such as Risk IT, CobiT, PCI DSS or ISO/IEC 27002, may guide development. Countermeasures may include technical tools such as firewalls and anti-virus software, policies and procedures requiring such controls as regular backups and configuration hardening, employee training in security awareness, or organizing personnel into dedicated computer emergency response team (CERT) or computer security incident response team (CSIRT). [...] The cost and benefit of each countermeasure is carefully considered. Thus, the IA practitioner does not seek to eliminate <b>all</b> <b>risks,</b> were that possible, but to manage them in the most cost-effective way.|$|E

2500|$|Hazard {{identification}} or {{assessment is}} an important step in the overall risk assessment and risk management process. It is where individual work hazards are identified, assessed and controlled/eliminated as close to source (location of the hazard) as reasonably as possible. As technology, resources, social expectation or regulatory requirements change, hazard analysis focuses controls more closely toward the source of the hazard. Thus hazard control is a dynamic program of prevention. Hazard-based programs also have the advantage of not assigning or implying there are [...] "acceptable risks" [...] in the workplace. A hazard-based program {{may not be able to}} eliminate <b>all</b> <b>risks,</b> but neither does it accept [...] "satisfactory" [...] – but still risky – outcomes. And as those who calculate and manage the risk are usually managers while those exposed to the risks are a different group, workers, a hazard-based approach can by-pass conflict inherent in a risk-based approach.|$|E
