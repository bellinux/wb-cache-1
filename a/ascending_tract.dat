This study searched for early imaging predictors of aortopathy in patients with a bicuspid aortic valve with right-left coronary cusp fusion, the most common morphotype. MethodsTime-resolved magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 36 subjects with nonstenotic, nonregurgitant bicuspid aortic valves and nondilated aortas and in 10 healthy controls with tricuspid aortic valves. Sinus dimensions (diameter, width, and height), <b>ascending</b> <b>tract</b> diameters, and wall strain were measured for each sinus/leaflet unit and corresponding <b>ascending</b> <b>tract</b> area to account for asymmetries. A novel parameter, “cusp opening angle,” measured the degree of valve leaflet alignment to outflow axis in systole, quantifying cusp motility. Phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging and computational fluid dynamic models assessed flow patterns. Aortic growth rate was estimated over a follow-up period ranging from 9 to 84 months. ResultsThe expected restriction of bicuspid aortic valve opening (conjoint cusp opening angle, 62 ° ± 5 ° vs 76 ° ± 3 ° for nonfused leaflet and 75 ° ± 3 ° for tricuspid aortic valve cusps; P < . 001) was confirmed, and the introduced parameter reproducibly quantified this phenomenon. Phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated systolic flow deflection toward the right, affecting the right anterolateral ascending wall. Computational models confirmed that restricted cusp motion alone is sufficient to cause the observed flow pattern. <b>Ascending</b> <b>tract</b> wall strain was not circumferentially homogeneous in bicuspid aortic valves. In multivariable analyses, the conjoint cusp opening angle independently predicted ascending aorta diameters and growth rate (P < . 001).

BackgroundPhenotypic heterogeneity of BAV-related aortopathy has recently been widely recognized. However, few studies have addressed the determinants of aortic growth so far, not distinguishing among morphological phenotypes. MethodsSerial retrospective data on 133 adult outpatients with BAV undergoing echocardiographic follow-up were analyzed to search for factors associated with aortic diameter growth over time and with rapid aortic growth (fifth quintile of growth rate distribution), focusing {{on the impact of}} different valve morphotypes (i. e., cusp fusion pattern: right-left coronary [RL] and right-noncoronary [RN]) and previously defined aortic phenotypes (nondilated aorta, ascending dilation, root dilation). ResultsThe RL pattern was present in 69 % of patients with BAV and RN in 31 %. At baseline, an ascending dilation phenotype was observed in 57 % of patients and a root phenotype in 13. 5 %. No patient with RN-BAV had a root dilation phenotype at either baseline or last examination. Follow-up time averaged 4. 0 ± 2. 7 years (535 patient-years). The mean growth rate was 0. 3 mm/year at the sinuses and 0. 6 mm/year at the ascending level. Aortic regurgitation predicted an increase in ascending diameter over time (odds ratio [OR]: 2. 3; p = 0. 03). Root phenotype at presentation, not absolute baseline diameter, was an independent predictor of fast progression (> 0. 9 mm/year) for the <b>ascending</b> <b>tract</b> (OR: 14; p = 0. 001). Fast growth was rarely seen in patients with the RL morphotype and ascending phenotype (6 % at the root and 10 % at the ascending level). ConclusionsIn patients with BAV, the root phenotype (aortic dilation predominantly at the sinuses, with normal or less dilated <b>ascending</b> <b>tract)</b> may be a marker of more severe aortopathy, warranting closer surveillance and earlier treatment.

40|$|Although the {{vestibular}} complex {{represents an}} important component of the neural circuits crucial for the maintenance of truncal and postural stability, and it is integrated into specialized oculomotor circuits, knowledge regarding the extent of the involvement of its nuclei and associated fibre tracts in cases with spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA 3) is incomplete. Accordingly, we performed a pathoanatomical analysis of the vestibular complex and its associated fibre tracts in four clinically diagnosed and genetically confirmed SCA 3 patients with the aim of providing more exact information as to the involvement of the vestibular system in this disorder.

40|$|Serotonin and {{noradrenaline}} {{are known}} {{to play an important}} part in modulation of spinal neuronal networks. Group I muscle afferents mediate information on dynamic changes of muscle length and tension, and modulation of actions from these afferents could be of importance for the execution of movements. However, previous studies revealed inconsistent modulatory actions by monoamines on synaptic actions of these afferents. The main aim of this thesis was to reinvestigate this problem by first examining whether group I evoked activation of spinal interneurones and <b>ascending</b> <b>tract</b> neurones is modulated by serotonin and noradrenaline and, if so, to study what membrane receptors might be involved in mediating this effect. Thirdly, we compared modulatory effects on synaptic actions of different afferents to the same neurone, in order to examine if these effects are general or apply only to specific input. Finally, experiments were made to investigate if monoaminergic actions act on the target neurones are mediated only via volume transmission or if some actions may be mediated by direct synaptic action. The study focused on monosynaptic actions of group I afferents on individual neurones of four spinal neuronal populations, all of which were located in lumbar segments. They were recorded from in deeply anaesthetised cats. Effects of serotonin and noradrenaline as well as of receptor agonists applied locally by ionophoresis were studied by comparing changes in monosynaptic responses to afferent nerve stimulation before, during and after drug application. Transmission from group I afferents was facilitated by both serotonin and noradrenaline in all the investigated populations. Effects of different receptor agonists were tested on ventral spinocerebellar tract neurones and some agonists were found to have depressive actions, indicating that different receptors contribute to the modulation. In interneurones co-excited by group I and II afferents the effects on group I afferents were facilitatory whereas effects on group II afferents to these neurones were either facilitatory or depressive, resulting in opposite effects of serotonin and noradrenaline on some of these neurones. Neurones of one population, the ventral spinal spinocerebellar tract neurones, were labelled intracellularly with rhodamine dextran or horseradish-peroxidase. They were examined using confocal and electron microscopy for presence of contacts of immunoreactive monoaminergic fibres. The morphological analysis showed that both serotonin and noradrenaline fibres form close appositions with somata and dendrites of these neurones, and that some of the serotoninergic boutons make direct synapses with these neurones. The results of these studies show that group I evoked activation of spinal interneurones and <b>ascending</b> <b>tract</b> neurones is modulated in a highly selective manner, both as regards the type of afferent and the involvement of different membrane receptors. In addition, the evidence that serotoninergic varicosities make synaptic contacts with ventral spinocerebellar tract neurons indicates the possibility of modulation of information from primary afferents to the cerebellum and thereby adjusting the cerebellar integrating functions depending on the demands in a given situation...|$|E

Intracellular recordings were made from such interneurons in anesthetized cats under neuromuscular blockade and with the respiratory drive stimulated by inhaled CO 2. The majority of the interneurons were shown by antidromic activation to have axons descending {{for at least two}} to four segments, mostly contralateral to the soma. In all, 81 % of the neurons showed postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) to stimulation of intercostal or dorsal ramus nerves of the same segment for low-threshold (≤ 5 T) afferents.

40|$|It has {{previously}} been established that ventral spinocerebellar tract (VSCT) neurons and dorsal spinocerebellar tract neurons located in Clarke's column (CC DSCT neurons) forward information on actions of premotor interneurons in reflex pathways from muscle afferents on α-motoneurons. Whether DSCT neurons located in the dorsal horn (dh DSCT neurons) and spinocervical tract (SCT) neurons are involved in forwarding similar feedback information {{has not yet been}} investigated. The aim {{of the present study was}} therefore to examine the input from premotor interneurons to these neurons. Electrical stimuli were applied within major hindlimb motor nuclei to activate axon-collaterals of interneurons projecting to these nuclei, and intracellular records were obtained from dh DSCT and SCT neurons. Direct actions of the stimulated interneurons were differentiated from indirect actions by latencies of postsynaptic potentials evoked by intraspinal stimuli and by the absence or presence of temporal facilitation. Direct actions of premotor interneurons were found in a smaller proportion of dh DSCT than of CC DSCT neurons. However, they were evoked by both excitatory and inhibitory interneurons, whereas only inhibitory premotor interneurons were previously found to affect CC DSCT neurons [as indicated by monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in dh DSCT and only IPSPs in CC DSCT neurons]. No effects of premotor interneurons were found in SCT neurons, since monosynaptic EPSPs or IPSPs were only evoked in them by stimuli applied outside motor nuclei.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIM OF THE STUDY: Aortic {{wall stress}} {{has been shown}} to {{increase}} locally at the convex aspect of the <b>ascending</b> <b>tract</b> when axial root motion is increased, as occurs in aortic valve regurgitation. The study aim was to assess the expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins involved in stress-induced vascular remodeling in the convexity and the concavity of dilated ascending aortas with aortic valve regurgitation. METHODS: Aortic wall specimens, harvested at the convexity and concavity of eight dilated ascending aortas with severe aortic valve regurgitation underwent morphometry, Western blot, RT-PCR and confocal immunohistochemistry. Five patients (group A) had congenital bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), and three (group B) had Marfan's syndrome. Specimens from the aorta of three multi-organ donors served as controls. RESULTS: At morphometry, medial degeneration was more severe in the convexity than in the concavity, especially in group A. Western blot, RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry disclosed an asymmetric pattern in the expression of some ECM proteins (laminin, tenascin, fibronectin). Fibronectin was increased in the convexity of both groups compared to controls at Western blot. Immunohistochemistry confirmed this pattern only in BAV. Higher levels of tenascin were found in the convexity in group A. The laminin content was greater in the concavity than in the convexity of both groups, but in group B the type of laminin was different, with the beta 2 chain particularly expressed, and almost absent in non-Marfan patients. Type I and type III collagens were more markedly reduced in the convexity than in the concavity in BAV. In group B, type I collagen was decreased and type III increased, but without any significant difference between the two aspects of the aorta. CONCLUSION: A tissue remodeling response to valve disease-related wall stress may underlie aortic dilatation with BAV regurgitation. Although morphometry showed similar changes in Marfan aortas, molecular investigations differentiated this condition, qualitatively, from BAV...|$|E
50|$|At {{the level}} of the closed medulla in the {{posterior}} white column, two large nuclei namely the gracile nucleus and the cuneate nucleus can be found.
