40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine the effects of family support (<b>affective</b> <b>and</b> instrumental) <b>and</b> {{friendship}} (<b>affective</b> <b>and</b> instrumental) on the psychological well-being of older women in one district in Hong Kong. The study sample consisted of 60 older women aged 60 to 85. The results show that family support (<b>affective</b> <b>and</b> instrumental) <b>and</b> friendship (<b>affective</b> <b>and</b> instrumental) are all related positively significantly to psychological well-being (measures of positive affect include happiness, life satisfaction, and competency; and negative affect include stress, anxiety, and depression). A series of stepwise multiple regression analyses demonstrated that affective support for family and perceived importance of friendship were strong predictors of psychological well-being. Some recommendations with regard to informal support provision for older persons are discussed in the paper...|$|R

This latent structure analysis sought to delineate boundaries of BED given its comorbidity with <b>affective</b> <b>and</b> anxiety disorders. A population-based sample of 151 women with BED, 102 women with affective or anxiety disorders, and 259 women without psychiatric disorders was assessed with clinical interviews and self-report-questionnaires. Taxometric {{analyses were conducted}} using DSM-IV criteria of BED <b>and</b> of <b>affective</b> <b>and</b> anxiety disorders. The results showed a taxonic structure of BED <b>and</b> of <b>affective</b> <b>and</b> anxiety disorders. Both taxa co-occurred at an above-chance level, but also presented independently with twice-as-large probabilities. Within the BED taxon, diagnostic co-occurrence indicated greater general psychopathology, lower social adaptation, and greater premorbid exposure to parental mood and substance disorder, but not greater {{eating disorder}} psychopathology. Eating disorder psychopathology discriminated individuals in the BED taxon from individuals in the <b>affective</b> <b>and</b> anxiety disorders taxon. Diagnostic criteria of BED were more indicative of the BED taxon than were criteria of <b>affective</b> <b>and</b> anxiety disorders. The results show that at the latent level, BED was co-occurring with, yet distinct from, <b>affective</b> <b>and</b> anxiety disorders and was not characterized by an underlying affective or anxiety disorder...|$|R

Many studies have showed the efficacy of exercise in major depression and at depressed episode of bipolar patients, as well as, some authors shows the benefits of exercise in some anxiety disorders like Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic. Despite their efficacy, little is known concerning the main mechanisms related to the antidepressant and anxiolytic effects of exercise. Several studies in an animal model using Neurotrophic Factors, Oxidative Stress, Immunologic response and other biological markers reveal promising results.

25|$|The {{foundation}} for training programs is learning. Learning outcomes can be organized into three broad categories: cognitive, skill-based, <b>and</b> <b>affective</b> outcomes. Cognitive training {{is aimed at}} instilling declarative knowledge or the knowledge of rules, facts, and principles (e.g., police officer training covers laws and court procedures). Skill-based training aims to impart procedural knowledge (e.g., skills needed to use a special tool) or technical skills (e.g., understanding the workings of software program). Affective training concerns teaching individuals to develop specific attitudes or beliefs that predispose trainees to behave a certain way (e.g., show commitment to the organization, appreciate diversity).|$|E

25|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that using cannabis can produce temporary and usually mild psychotic <b>and</b> <b>affective</b> experiences. When it comes to persisting effects, {{there is a clear}} increase in incidence of psychotic outcomes in people who had used cannabis, even when they had used it only once. More frequent use of cannabis strongly augmented the risk for psychosis. The evidence for affective outcomes is less strong. However, this connection between cannabis and psychosis does not prove that cannabis causes psychotic disorders. The causality theory for cannabis has been challenged as despite explosive increases in cannabis consumption over the past 40 years in western society, the rate of schizophrenia (and psychosis in general) has remained relatively stable.|$|E

25|$|Open source {{software}} tools deploy machine learning, statistics, and {{natural language processing}} techniques to automate sentiment analysis on large collections of texts, including web pages, online news, internet discussion groups, online reviews, web blogs, and social media.

One of the first approach in this direction is SentiBank utilizing an adjective noun pair representation of visual content. In addition, {{the vast majority of}} sentiment classification approaches rely on the bag-of-words model, which disregards context, grammar and even word order.

25|$|According to the most-common analysis, the Otomi {{language}} has {{two kinds of}} bound morphemes, proclitics and affixes. Proclitics differ from affixes mainly in their phonological characteristics– they are marked for tone and block nasal harmony. Some authors consider proclitics to be better analyzed as prefixes. Orthographically, the standard orthography writes proclitics as separate words, whereas affixes are written joined to their host root. Most affixes are suffixes and with few exceptions occur only on verbs, whereas the proclitics occur both in nominal and verbal paradigms. Proclitics mark the categories of definiteness and number, person, negation, tense and aspect – often fused in a single proclitic. Suffixes mark direct and indirect objects, as well as clusivity (the distinction between inclusive and exclusive we), number, location <b>and</b> <b>affective</b> emphasis. Historically, as in other Oto-Manguean languages, the basic word order is verb–subject–object (VSO), but some dialects tend towards subject–verb–object (SVO) word order, probably under influence from Spanish. Possessive constructions use the order possessed-possessor but modificational constructions use modifier-head order.|$|E

25|$|Some {{laboratory}} research demonstrate correlations between psychopathy and atypical responses to aversive stimuli, including weak conditioning to painful stimuli and poor learning of avoiding responses that cause punishment, {{as well as}} low reactivity in the autonomic nervous system as measured with skin conductance while waiting for a painful stimulus but not when the stimulus occurs. While {{it has been argued}} that the reward system functions normally, some studies have also found reduced reactivity to pleasurable stimuli. According to the response modulation hypothesis, psychopathic individuals have also had difficulty switching from an ongoing action despite environmental cues signaling a need to do so. This may explain the difficulty responding to punishment, although it is unclear if it can explain findings such as deficient conditioning. There may be methodological issues regarding the research. While establishing a range of idiosyncrasies on average in linguistic <b>and</b> <b>affective</b> processing under certain conditions, this research program has not confirmed a common pathology of psychopathy.|$|E
