Thesis is in its practice part focused on companies Linea Nivnice, a. s., Slovácké strojírny. a. s. and Česká zbrojovka, a. s. In thesis are defined possible positives <b>and</b> <b>negatives</b> across sectors <b>and</b> types of regions. These positives <b>and</b> <b>negatives</b> are divided into groups of "economic," social "and" environmental "aspects. Thesis contains a complex description of selected companies and the region...|$|R

5|$|A {{direct method}} for {{producing}} an MSA uses the dynamic programming technique {{to identify the}} globally optimal alignment solution. For proteins, this method usually involves two sets of parameters: a gap penalty and a substitution matrix assigning scores or probabilities to the alignment of each possible pair of amino acids based on the similarity of the amino acids' chemical properties and the evolutionary probability of the mutation. For nucleotide sequences a similar gap penalty is used, but a much simpler substitution matrix, wherein only identical matches and mismatches are considered, is typical. The scores in the substitution matrix may be either all positive or a mix of positive <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> {{in the case of}} a global alignment, but must be both positive <b>and</b> <b>negative,</b> {{in the case of a}} local alignment.|$|E
5|$|Although pranks that {{involved}} public locations, figures, and organisations {{were always a}} feature of the series, the APEC pranks yielded unprecedented local and international publicity, both positive <b>and</b> <b>negative.</b> Some team members faced charges for breaching the APEC zone, but these were dropped because police had allowed their entry into the restricted zone. Other less controversial and less publicised stunts were also shown on The Chaser's War on Everything, with ratings peaking at almost three million Australian viewers for the APEC wrap-up episode.|$|E
5|$|At {{several points}} in the book, Bechdel {{questions}} whether her decision to come out as a lesbian {{was one of the}} triggers for her father's suicide. This question is never answered definitively, but Bechdel closely examines the connection between her father's closeted sexuality and her own open lesbianism, revealing her debt to her father in both positive <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> lights.|$|E

5|$|Cannon Fodder 3 was {{released}} in Russia in December 2011 and – via download service GamersGate – Europe and North America on 9 February 2012, receiving mixed reviews. Reviewers found the game to be enjoyable but limited and repetitive. The graphics and humour received both positive <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> criticism. Critics derided the poor English translations as well as technical problems.|$|E

5|$|For certain exponents {{there are}} special ways to compute x'y {{much faster than}} through generic exponentiation.

5|$|For {{practical}} purposes, it {{is useful}} to define a common reference point to which potentials may be expressed and compared. While this could be at infinity, a much more useful reference is the Earth itself, which is assumed to be at the same potential everywhere. This reference point naturally takes the name earth or ground. Earth is assumed to be an infinite source of equal amounts of positive <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> charge, and is therefore electrically uncharged—and unchargeable.|$|E
5|$|Former {{president}} Dmitry Medvedev of Russia {{stated that}} both the positive <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> experiences of the European Union will {{be taken into account}} and argued that the Eurasian Union will avoid the problems of economic gaps and disparity between countries, such as those found in the eurozone, since the member countries have a comparable level of economic development, as well as common history and values.|$|E
5|$|Further {{methods of}} {{identification}} are chemical tests. With {{the application of}} FeSO4 to the cap cuticle (pileipellis), it will turn a dark grey, almost black color and with the application of potassium hydroxide or NH4OH it has a negative coloration. The context stains a bluish grey to an olive green when FeSO4 is applied to it, a pale orange to a pale yellow with the application of KOH, <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> with the application of NH4OH.|$|E

5|$|In Japan, the Eyeshield 21 manga {{has sold}} over 20 million volumes. The manga and anime have been {{featured}} {{at various times}} in weekly top ten lists of best-selling in their respective media. The anime has been watched by {{a large number of}} television viewers in Japan, helping to raise American football's popularity in the country. Publications for manga, anime and others have commented on Eyeshield 21, which received positive comments for its artwork and characters, <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> responses to its non-football scenes.|$|E
5|$|Like the Tom Swift, Jr. series, {{the series}} portrays Tom as a {{scientist}} {{as well as an}} inventor whose inventions depend on a knowledge of theory. The series differs from previous versions of the character, however, in that Tom's inventive genius is portrayed as problematic and sometimes dangerous. As Robert Von der Osten argues, Tom's inventions for this series often have unexpected <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> repercussions.|$|E
5|$|Most ionic {{compounds}} {{are very}} brittle. Once {{they reach the}} limit of their strength, they cannot deform mealleably, because the strict alignment of positive <b>and</b> <b>negative</b> ions must be maintained. Instead the material undergoes fracture via cleavage. As the temperature is elevated (usually close to the melting point) a ductile–brittle transition occurs, and plastic flow becomes possible by the motion of dislocations.|$|E
