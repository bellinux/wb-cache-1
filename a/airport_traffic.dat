5|$|Originally {{signed as}} Business I-10, the Hohokam Expressway is a {{relatively}} short north–south freeway that runs east of Sky Harbor International Airport, between Loop 202 and Interstate 10. Its primary purpose is to distribute east side <b>airport</b> <b>traffic</b> from and to Eastbound Loop 202 and I-10 without utilizing stop-and-go surface streets.|$|E

The award recognizes BNA's remarkable 11.2 percent growth in passenger traffic in 2016 in the mid-sized airport category (5 million – 20 million annual passengers).|$|E
5|$|While the Silver Line was {{originally}} planned to terminate at Stadium-Armory, in 2012 {{the plan was}} changed for the line to end at Largo Town Center instead, because Stadium-Armory's pocket track is too short for trains to turn around. It follows the Blue and Orange Line tracks through DC, continuing through Arlington along the Orange Line and branching off immediately east of the West Falls Church station. The new tracks run in the median of the Dulles Connector Road to an elevated bridge, which takes them over Virginia Route 123. Two elevated stops along {{the west side of}} Route 123 serve the national headquarters of CapitalOne, SAIC and two enclosed Tysons Corner shopping malls. The tracks then enter a tunnel which emerges in the median of Virginia Route 7. Two elevated stations above Route 7 serve the western section of Tysons Corner. The elevated track then swings into the median of the Dulles Access Road until it reaches the airport. Along the way, five new stations would be built with platforms in the median of the access road and a faregate and pedestrian bridges to parking areas elevated above the highway. In anticipation of the Herndon station being built, in 1999 Fairfax County constructed a 1,750-space parking garage with ramps to the Dulles Access Road toll lanes and this facility is being used for bus commuters on an interim basis. The garage has drawn criticism because of alleged construction flaws. As originally planned, upon reaching the airport the track will enter a tunnel which will follow the path of the arrivals driveway of the airport terminal to a station located close to the terminal. The track would leave the tunnel near the airport hotel and economy parking lots and would head north parallel to the main runways. A storage yard and maintenance facility would branch off to the west occupying the airport's buffer zone north of the end of its major runways. The final two stops would be in the median of the Dulles Greenway, serving the Ashburn suburb. Hence, the line is expected to draw both <b>airport</b> <b>traffic</b> and commuters from the far western suburbs of Washington, DC. Buses currently provide these users with limited public transportation. In contrast, the Silver Line is expected to provide trains once every six minutes during rush hours and once every fourteen minutes during non-rush hours.|$|E

Planning halted in 1990 after the airport construction decision was shelved. By then only the Socialist Left Party in Hurum Municipal Council being opposed. Without the <b>airport</b> <b>traffic,</b> the profitability in the project fell through and the Public Roads Administration called to instead prioritize other investments. However, Minister of Transport and Communications Kjell Opseth was a staunch supporter of the Oslofjord Link, in part as a compensation {{for the loss of}} the airport after it in 1992 was decided to be built at Gardermoen.|$|E

25|$|In 1974, {{the debate}} over the {{waterfront}} airport intensified. That year, a joint committee of the Toronto, Metro, Ontario and Canadian governments, with representatives of the Toronto Board of Trade and the Ontario Aviation Council was set up to study the possible future of a STOL airport. It was revealed by Ontario Liberal Leader Bob Nixon, and admitted by Ontario government transport and communications minister John Rhodes, that the Ontario and Canadian governments were planning in secret to resurrect the second airport, on the location of the Outer Harbour headland. The proposed new airport was designed to separate the two types of <b>airport</b> <b>traffic,</b> that of the STOL planes and general aviation between the two airports, which landed at two different angles of descent. The secret plan infuriated Toronto committee member Dorothy Thomas and resurrected local residents' opposition. The City of Toronto Planning Board released a report critical of the STOL airport at the island, stating that the need was not justified.|$|E
