5|$|Acetic acid is {{produced}} industrially both synthetically and by bacterial fermentation. About 75% of acetic acid made {{for use in}} the chemical industry is made by the carbonylation of methanol, explained below. The biological route accounts for only about 10% of world production, but it remains important for the production of vinegar because many food purity laws require vinegar used in foods to be of biological origin. Other processes are methyl formate isomerization, conversion of syngas to acetic acid, and gas phase oxidation of ethylene and ethanol. Acetic acid is often a side product of different reactions, i.e. during heterogeneous catalytic acrylic acid synthesis or fermentative lactic acid production. As of 2003–2005, total worldwide production of virgin acetic acid was estimated at 5Mt/a (million tonnes per year), approximately half of which was produced in the United States. European production was approximately 1Mt/a <b>and</b> <b>declining,</b> while Japanese production was 0.7Mt/a. Another 1.5Mt were recycled each year, bringing the total world market to 6.5Mt/a. Since then the global production has increased to 10.7 Mt/a (in 2010), and further; however, a slowing in this increase in production is predicted. The two biggest producers of virgin acetic acid are Celanese and BP Chemicals. Other major producers include Millennium Chemicals, Sterling Chemicals, Samsung, Eastman, and Svensk Etanolkemi.|$|E
5|$|Carre's Grammar School is a {{selective}} secondary school for boys in Sleaford, a market town in Lincolnshire, England. Founded on 1 September 1604 by an indenture of Robert Carre, {{the school was}} funded by rents from farmland and run {{by a group of}} trustees. The indenture restricted the endowment to £20 without accounting for inflation, causing the school to decline during the 18th century and effectively close in 1816. Revived by a decree from the Court of Chancery in 1830, new buildings were constructed at its present site and the school re-opened in 1835. Faced with competition from cheaper commercial schools <b>and</b> <b>declining</b> rolls, Carre's eventually added technical and artistic instruction to its Classical curriculum by affiliating with Kesteven County Council in 1895. Following the Education Act 1944, school fees were abolished and Carre's became Voluntary Aided. New buildings were completed in 1966 to house the rising number of students. After plans for comprehensive education in Sleaford came to nothing in the 1970s and 1980s, Carre's converted to grant-maintained status in 1990. Foundation status followed and the school became an Academy in 2011; a multi-Academy trust with Kesteven and Sleaford High School was formed in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Classified as {{vulnerable}} by the IUCN due to ongoing habitat destruction and {{a decline in}} the quality of the remaining habitat, the long-tailed ground roller {{is believed to be the}} most threatened species of ground roller. Thirty percent of its already small habitat area was degraded between the mid-1970s and 2000. Slash-and-burn agriculture, charcoal production, logging, and cattle grazing have all contributed to the loss of habitat. As of 2012, no reserves protect any portion of its habitat, and as a result its habitat has been described as the area of Madagascar most in need of conservation efforts. It is also threatened by both hunting and egg-collecting. In addition to humans, dogs hunt this species, and the introduced black rat is a nest predator. This ground roller is capable of tolerating some habitat disturbance, but requires a suitable amount of shade and leaf litter to continue living in the area. Although it was fairly common at the beginning of the twentieth century, its population went into decline and it was considered rare by the 1960s. As of 2012, the estimated population of the long-tailed ground roller is between 9,500 and 32,700 birds <b>and</b> <b>declining.</b>|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{technical}} innovations of the railway {{and the large}} passenger demand, the C was not particularly profitable and the rapid series of extensions aimed at improving profits had placed a strain on the finances. The dividends were low <b>and</b> <b>declining</b> (2​18% in 1898, 1​78% in 1899 and 1​14% in 1900) and the company {{had been accused of}} extravagance for the abandonment of King William Street station. In an attempt to work around this poor reputation and make it easier to raise funds, the next bill for an extension of the line was submitted in November 1900 by a notionally separate company, the Islington and Euston Railway (I), albeit one that shared its chairman with the C The proposed railway was to run from the as yet unfinished C station at Angel to the main-line stations at King's Cross, St Pancras and Euston. The I bill coincided with a rash of other railway bills encouraged by the successful opening of the Central London Railway (CLR) in 1900 and was considered alongside these by another Parliamentary Joint Committee in 1901. The bill was approved, but the time taken for the committee's review meant {{that it had to be}} resubmitted for the 1902 Parliamentary session.|$|E
5|$|Henry IV {{was plagued}} with {{financial}} problems, the political need to reward his supporters, frequent rebellions <b>and</b> <b>declining</b> healthincluding leprosy and epilepsy. The Percy {{family had been}} some of Henry's leading supporters, defending the North from Scotland largely at their own expense, but revolted {{in the face of}} lack of reward and suspicion from Henry. Henry Percy (Hotspur) was defeated and killed at the Battle of Shrewsbury. In 1405, Hotspur's father Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, supported the Archbishop of York, Richard le Scrope, in another rebellion, after which the elder Percy fled to Scotland and his estates were confiscated. Henry had Scrope executed in an act comparable to the murder of another ArchbishopThomas Becket by men loyal to Henry II. This would probably have led to Henry's excommunication but the church {{was in the midst of}} the Western Schism, with competing popes keen on Henry's support; it protested but took no action. In 1408, Percy invaded England once more and was killed at the Battle of Bramham Moor. In Wales, Owain Glyndŵr's widespread rebellion was only suppressed with the recapture of Harlech Castle in 1409, although sporadic fighting continued until 1421.|$|E

5|$|In September 1740, as unrest rose {{among the}} Chinese population, spurred by {{government}} repression <b>and</b> <b>declining</b> sugar prices, Governor-General Adriaan Valckenier declared that any uprising would {{be met with}} deadly force. On 7October, hundreds of ethnic Chinese, many of them sugar mill workers, killed 50 Dutch soldiers, leading Dutch troops to confiscate all weapons from the Chinese populace and to place the Chinese under a curfew. Two days later, rumours of Chinese atrocities led other Batavian ethnic groups to burn Chinese houses along Besar Stream and Dutch soldiers to fire cannon at Chinese homes. The violence soon spread throughout Batavia, killing more Chinese. Although Valckenier declared an amnesty on 11October, gangs of irregulars continued to hunt and kill Chinese until 22October, when the governor-general called more forcefully for a cessation of hostilities. Outside the city walls, clashes continued between Dutch troops and rioting sugar mill workers. After several weeks of minor skirmishes, Dutch-led troops assaulted Chinese strongholds in sugar mills throughout the area.|$|E

5|$|In {{their work}} The Life and Death of Planet Earth, authors Peter D.

Ward and Brownlee use fossil evidence from the Burgess Shale in British Columbia, Canada, to determine the climate of the Cambrian Explosion, and use it to predict the climate of the future when rising global temperatures caused by a warming Sun <b>and</b> <b>declining</b> oxygen levels result in the final extinction of animal life. Initially, they expect that some insects, lizards, birds and small mammals may persist, along with sea life. However, without oxygen replenishment by plant life, they believe that animals would probably die off from asphyxiation within a few million years. Even if sufficient oxygen were to remain in the atmosphere through the persistence of some form of photosynthesis, the steady rise in global temperature would result in a gradual loss of biodiversity.|$|E
