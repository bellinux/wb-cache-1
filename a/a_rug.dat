5|$|Mikoyan {{was born}} to Armenian parents {{in the village of}} Sanahin, then a part of the Yelizavetpol Governorate of the Russian Empire (presently a part of Alaverdi in Armenia's Lori Province) in 1895. His father, Hovhannes, worked as a {{carpenter}} and his mother was <b>a</b> <b>rug</b> weaver. He had one younger brother, Artem Mikoyan, who would go on to become the co-founder of the MiG aviation design bureau which became one of the primary design bureaus of fast jets in Soviet military aviation.|$|E
5|$|In St. Louis, Anson Stokes, an apathetic {{employee}} at a self storage facility, is yelled at by his boss {{to clean out}} an old and dusty storage locker. To his surprise, he finds a woman wrapped in <b>a</b> <b>rug.</b> His boss comes to check on him; while he is yelling for Anson, his mouth disappears. FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) speak with the boss, Jay Gilmore, after surgery to fix his mouth, which has left him disfigured and with a speech impediment. They question Stokes' brother Leslie at their mobile home, which inexplicably has a large boat in its tiny front yard. The woman from the storage container is in the Stokes brothers' kitchen. Mulder and Scully search the container and find old antiques {{and a picture of}} the previous owner with the woman from the apartment.|$|E
5|$|Living {{quarters}} for the senior officers consisted of eight separate well-furnished cabins, each {{provided with a}} small oak table and chair, an oil lamp, shelves and drawers and a canvas floor covering covered with <b>a</b> <b>rug.</b> The entire crew were given goat-skin mats to sleep on. Lighting for each living area was provided by small skylights in the deck above, which were covered by an iron hatch during battle. The officer's wardroom was located forward of the berth deck where officers would eat their meals, hold meetings or socialize during what little spare time they had. It was well furnished with an oriental rug, a large oak table and other such items. Ericsson had personally paid for the costs of all the officer's furnishings.|$|E

5|$|July 9, 1861 {{was a hot}} day, and Fanny {{was putting}} locks of her children's hair into an {{envelope}} and attempting to seal it with hot sealing wax while Longfellow took a nap. Her dress suddenly caught fire, though it is unclear exactly how; burning wax or a lighted candle may have fallen onto it. Longfellow was awakened from his nap and rushed to help her, throwing <b>a</b> <b>rug</b> over her, though it was too small. He stifled the flames with his body as best he could, but she was already badly burned. Over half a century later, Longfellow's youngest daughter Annie explained the story differently, claiming {{that there had been}} no candle or wax but that the fire had started from a self-lighting match that had fallen on the floor. Both accounts state that Fanny was taken to her room to recover and a doctor was called. She {{was in and out of}} consciousness throughout the night and was administered ether. She died shortly after 10:00 the next morning, July 10, after requesting a cup of coffee. Longfellow, in trying to save her, had burned himself badly enough so that he was unable to attend her funeral. His facial injuries led him to stop shaving, and he wore a beard from then on that became his trademark.|$|E

25|$|Cunanan's {{killing spree}} began in Minneapolis on April 27, 1997, {{with the murder}} of San Diego {{acquaintance}} Jeffrey Trail, a former US naval officer and propane salesman.

25|$|Although {{the bodies}} of the other three grand dukes were thrown into a mass grave within the fortress, that of Dmitry Konstantinovich was {{secretly}} collected the next morning by his devoted former Adjutant, von Leiming, rolled up in <b>a</b> <b>rug</b> and taken away for a private burial in the garden of a house in Petrograd, where he remains to this day.|$|E
25|$|The current Rocky Mountains {{were raised}} in the Laramide orogeny from between 80 and 55 Ma. For the Canadian Rockies, the {{mountain}} building is analogous to <b>a</b> <b>rug</b> being pushed on a hardwood floor: the rug bunches up and forms wrinkles (mountains). In Canada, the terranes and subduction are the foot pushing the rug, the ancestral rocks are the rug, and the Canadian Shield {{in the middle of}} the continent is the hardwood floor.|$|E
2500|$|<b>A</b> hooked <b>rug</b> is <b>a</b> simple type of rug {{handmade}} {{by pulling}} strips of cloth such as wool or cotton through the meshes of a sturdy fabric such as burlap.

25|$|To begin making <b>a</b> <b>rug,</b> {{one needs}} a {{foundation}} consisting of warps and wefts: Warps are strong, thick threads of cotton, wool or silk which {{run through the}} length of the rug. Similar threads which pass under and over the warps {{from one side to the}} other are called wefts. The warps on either side of the rug are normally plied into one or more strings of varying thickness that are overcast to form the selvedge.|$|E
25|$|The caliph was {{captured}} {{and forced to}} watch as his citizens were murdered and his treasury was plundered. According to most accounts, the caliph was killed by trampling. The Mongols rolled the caliph up in <b>a</b> <b>rug,</b> and rode their horses over him, because {{they believed that the}} earth would be offended if it were ever touched by royal blood. All but one of his sons were killed, and the sole surviving son was sent to Mongolia.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} surviving examples of European quilting, the late 14th-century Sicilian Tristan Quilt, is also held by the collection. The collection has numerous examples of various types of textiles designed by William Morris, including, embroidery, woven fabrics, tapestries (Including 'The Forest' tapestry of 1887), rugs and carpets, as well as pattern books and paper designs. The art deco period is covered by rugs and fabrics designed by Marion Dorn. From the same period there is <b>a</b> <b>rug</b> designed by Serge Chermayeff.|$|E

25|$|The caliph Al-Musta'sim was {{captured}} {{and forced to}} watch as his citizens were murdered and his treasury plundered. According to most accounts, the caliph was killed by trampling. The Mongols rolled the caliph up in <b>a</b> <b>rug,</b> and rode their horses over him, as {{they believed that the}} earth would be offended if it were touched by royal blood. But the Venetian traveller Marco Polo claimed that Al-Musta'sim was locked in a tower with nothing to eat but gold and “died like a dog”.|$|E
25|$|After {{her plan}} {{to blow up}} police {{headquarters}} narrowly failed, her stronghold was raided; Cutolo escaped under <b>a</b> <b>rug</b> in a car driven boldly past checkpoints by the neighbourhood priest. She then went underground, remaining at liberty for the next 10 years. In 1993 she gave herself up and only was charged with mafia association: prosecutors alleged she had been running her brother's organisation. She was acquitted 9 times of murder. Rosetta had persuaded the authorities she was harmless, and her frumpy image definitely helped.|$|E
25|$|Claire, {{hoping to}} speed up Alex's {{negotiations}} for <b>a</b> <b>rug,</b> complained about being tired and wanting {{to return to the}} hotel, to pressure the seller into dropping the price faster. This idea backfired, as Alex was forced to buy it when the price was frozen instead. Sir Alan indicated that had Renaissance lost the task by a narrower margin, he would have fired Claire for this, while later stating that, despite his single mistake with the unbranded tajines, Alex had done far better {{than the rest of the}} team.|$|E

The Rug Suckers are a team of armed civilians who operate <b>a</b> <b>rug</b> cleaning company, but are available to help Banzai when called upon.|$|E
25|$|Another knot {{frequently}} used in Persian carpets is the Jufti knot, which is tied around four warps instead of two. A serviceable carpet {{can be made}} with jufti knots, and jufti knots are sometimes used in large single-colour areas of <b>a</b> <b>rug,</b> for example in the field, to save on material. However, as carpets woven wholly or partly with the jufti knot need only half the amount of pile yarn compared to traditionally woven carpets, their pile is less resistant to wear, and these rugs do not last as long.|$|E
25|$|The aim of {{the project}} is to advance methods of {{improvisation}} and active listening, proposing live audio soundscapes that mesh canine sounds with electroacoustic practice. In {{the process of developing}} this performance, a custom built theremin, that incorporates <b>a</b> <b>rug</b> as an interface, was created to allow Tom to use scratch and digging gestures to create sound, accompanied by a diverse range of vocalization. These studio performances are audio recorded for use later in the live performance where they are remixed into a new experimental improvisational soundscape. Andreyev accompanies Tom's vocals and rhythms with her own live theremin and software performance.|$|E
50|$|The Shãh Abbãsi floral design (motif) was {{commissioned}} by Shãh Abbãs the Great, originally to decorate the tiles of Esfahan's mosques. <b>As</b> <b>rug</b> weavers take inspiration from their surroundings, the design quickly {{found its way to}} Esfahan's rug weaving industry.
