5|$|Although Steinitz's play changed abruptly, he {{said had}} been {{thinking}} along such lines for some years: Some of the games which I saw Paulsen play during the London Congress of 1862 gave a still stronger start to the modification of my own opinions, which has since developed, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to recognize that Chess genius {{is not confined to}} the more or less deep and brilliant finishing strokes after the original balance of power and position has been overthrown, but that it also requires the exercise of still more extraordinary powers, though perhaps of a different kind to maintain that balance or respectively to disturb it at the proper time in one's own favor.|$|E
5|$|I {{realized}} {{that for a}} long time I had been holding onto this whole dogma of nonracism almost like a religion... But in the course of that debate I began to feel there was a lot lacking in the proponents of the nonracist idea... they had this problem, you know, of superiority, and they tended to take us for granted and wanted us to accept things that were second-class. They could not see why we could not consider staying in that church, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to feel that our understanding of our own situation in this country was not coincidental with that of these liberal whites.|$|E

It would have been a tribute to Hergé. Fanny Remi asked me to finish it, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> work on it, but after a few months she changed her mind. I didn't insist, but for me it was logical that there was a studio, there were artists in the studio, Casterman asked for it to be finished, there were twenty-three finished books, that one story was not finished; so I had to finish it." ...|$|E

500|$|Romney {{supported}} the American Civil Rights Movement while governor. [...] Although {{he belonged to}} a church that did not allow black people in its lay clergy, Romney's hardscrabble background and subsequent life experiences led him to support the movement. He reflected, [...] "It was only after I got to Detroit that I got to know Negroes and began {{to be able to}} evaluate them <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to recognize that some Negroes are better and more capable than lots of whites." [...] During his first State of the State address in January 1963, Romney declared that [...] "Michigan's most urgent human rights problem is racial discrimination—in housing, public accommodations, education, administration of justice, and employment." [...] Romney helped create the state's first civil rights commission.|$|E
500|$|Later authors {{appreciated}} Hebel's work too. Hermann Hesse once commented, [...] "As far as I know, in no {{literary history}} do we yet read that Hebel {{was the greatest}} German novelist, as great as Keller and more confident and purer and mightier in effect than Goethe." [...] Theodor W. Adorno lauded his essay Die Juden as [...] "one {{of the most beautiful}} German prose plays in defence of the Jews". In Die gerettete Zunge, Geschichte einer Jugend, Elias Canetti described the influence that Hebel's Schatzkästlein had on him: [...] "I never wrote a book, but that I did not secretly aspire to his style, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> by writing everything in shorthand, the knowledge of which I owe to him alone." [...] Marcel Reich-Ranicki wrote, [...] "Hebel's stories are among the most beautiful in the German language", and included the [...] "Schatzkästlein" [...] and [...] "Die Rose" [...] in his Kanon Deutscher Literatur. [...] The first was also listed in the ZEIT-Bibliothek der 100 Bücher.|$|E
500|$|Writing for The Scotsman, Andrea Mullaney articulated, [...] "Theroux {{really had}} found the {{ultimate}} in weirdness for his latest documentary – they're so beyond the point of reason, into a self-perpetuating psychosis, {{that no matter how}} he tried, he couldn't challenge their beamingly-delivered pronouncements, or trip them up. But he did manage to show them as human beings (more than the courtesy they extend to us sinners)." [...] Hilary Fannin of The Irish Times commented that the airing of the documentary, [...] "saw Louis Theroux, in The Most Hated Family in America, shatter another redneck American target, the Westboro Baptist Church". In a review of the documentary for The Sunday Times, Roland White discussed Theroux's stylistic technique, [...] "Theroux's usual technique [...] the friendly ingenue [...] made absolutely no impact on these people. It was like watching a youngster from a village cricket team trying to bowl out Geoff Boycott, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to wonder what Theroux was hoping to achieve. It is impossible to outargue the religious bigot. They have impeccable logic on their side: the word of God is the righteous truth; only they understand the true word of the Lord; therefore, they are right and everybody else is wrong." [...] Liverpool Daily Post recommended the film in its column, [...] "Sunday: What to Watch". Writing for the Birmingham Mail, Graham Young observed, [...] "The Most Hated Family in America is the best documentary from Louis since long before his Michael Jackson fiasco." [...] John Dugdale of The Sunday Times highlighted the film as his [...] "Pick of the day". Dugdale wrote favorably of the film, [...] "There are echoes of Theroux's film about a woman raising her daughters as neo-Nazis as he watches Phelps' daughter, Shirley, handing out placards to kids as young as seven. While tangling with her and her dad is pointless, the family's younger women are less inflexible, and his encounters with them are more rewarding." [...] A review in the Leicester Mercury noted of Theroux's interview techniques, [...] "His subtle interviewing style was perfect for showing off the crazy views of the members." ...|$|E

2500|$|Soon afterwards, Hyde Park was {{acquired}} by the Hallamshire Volunteer Rifle Corps as their drill ground. W. G. Grace played in the Colts v. AEE match as a guest player and captained the Colts XVIII. He recalled Hyde Park in his Recollections (published in 1899), saying: [...] "The ground stood {{on the top of}} a high hill, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to despair of the cab ever getting to the top".|$|E
2500|$|After {{his parents}} separated, his mother {{traveled}} seeking employment, and young Langston Hughes was raised mainly in Lawrence, Kansas by his maternal grandmother, Mary Patterson Langston. Through the black American oral tradition and drawing from the activist experiences of her generation, Mary Langston instilled in her grandson a lasting sense of racial pride. He {{spent most of}} his childhood in Lawrence. [...] In his 1940 autobiography The Big Sea he wrote: [...] "I was unhappy for a long time, and very lonesome, living with my grandmother. Then it was that books began to happen to me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to believe in nothing but books and the wonderful world in books — where if people suffered, they suffered in beautiful language, not in monosyllables, as we did in Kansas." ...|$|E

2500|$|I had polio, and I {{was totally}} paralyzed, and the {{inflammation}} {{was so great}} that I had a sensory paralysis too. I could move my eyes and my hearing was undisturbed. I got very lonesome lying in bed, unable to move anything except my eyeballs. I was quarantined on the farm with seven sisters, one brother, two parents, and a practical nurse. And how could I entertain myself? I started watching people and my environment. I soon learned that my sisters could say [...] "no" [...] when they meant [...] "yes." [...] And they could say [...] "yes" [...] and mean [...] "no" [...] at the same time. They could offer another sister an apple and hold it back. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> studying nonverbal language and body language.|$|E
2500|$|On December 28, 2001, he was {{prosecuted for}} the {{violation}} of Stimulant Drugs Control Law. He testified that, [...] "I used drugs {{to get rid of}} stress and tension before appearing on a TV program" [...] for the investigation by Tokyo District Prosecution Office. He also said, [...] "I lived confined to the house <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to worry. From about this April, I used it once every few days". According to an indictment, he warmed amphetamine over a fire and absorbed it in his home's video room. [...] His first trial for drug use and other crimes was in Tokyo District Court on February 1, 2002. Judgement was given on the case in the same court on February 8, 2002, where he was found guilty. However, he was given 3 years suspended sentence of 2 years imprisonment.|$|E
2500|$|In early June, {{while he}} was still only 17, Grace made his first visit to Sheffield, {{deputising}} for his brother E. M. Grace who was busy with his medical duties. The match was the last one recorded at the old Hyde Park Ground. As Grace later recalled, the ground [...] "stood {{on the top of a}} high hill, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to despair of the cab ever getting to the top". He captained eighteen Colts of Nottinghamshire and Sheffield against the All-England Eleven, his team losing by an innings. Grace scored 9 in the first innings and 36 (out of 91) in the second. He said in his memoir that [...] "the All-England team were anxious to catch the train to get away to some other part of the country and they begged me to get out", but he would not throw away his wicket. Simon Rae wrote that the game was [...] "an important test of character which he undoubtedly passed".|$|E

2500|$|McLure {{says that}} he was {{inspired}} to write the play by a vision that came to him of a poster advertising a boxing match between Jean Harlow and Billy the Kid. Before he began to write, {{he went to the}} printer that created boxing posters in San Francisco, and had the poster of his vision printed up. Then he says [...] "I put the poster up on fences, windows, and in liquor stores where boxing posters would be, and put one up behind my head in the room I worked in at the time, which overlooked the bridge and the ocean. I could feel the presence of Billy the Kid and Jean Harlow broadcasting from the beautiful poster to {{the back of my head}} out towards the ocean. They began enacting the play <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> typing it up. They'd say a few pages, I just typed it. I thought it was a nature poem about mammal sexuality and mammal love. It could have been a tantric ritual." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Williams {{composed}} {{and conducted}} the film's musical score, the second score composed {{the same year}} by Williams for Spielberg after The Adventures of Tintin. [...] Williams took inspiration by visiting a horse farm in California and observing horses and their behavior, elaborating that [...] "I got {{in the habit of}} watching the horses in the morning, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to see how they connect to each other and how they became curious about me. That's when I really began to get the sense that horses are very special creatures. They have been magnificent and trusted friends {{for such a long time}} and have done so much for us with such grace." [...] Williams was also influenced by the geographic scope of the film's story. In regards to that approach, Williams stated; [...] "This was a very rich opportunity musically because it is both about humans and animals and it takes place in three different countries. It starts out in a more intimate way, on the farm with the bonding of Joey and Albert. Then, the eruption of war changes the scale, and the music does a 180-degree turn. From this bucolic, gentle, even sentimental music, you move into the music of battle surges and gripping struggles. It's a musical journey full of dimension and emotional content, and I tried also to create an atmosphere reflective of that period, which was lyrical, poetic and tragic." [...] The score was recorded by a 90-piece orchestra, with Williams comparing the recording sessions more to a concert piece rather than a traditional film score, as it relied more on the individual performance of the musicians.|$|E
2500|$|In {{discussing}} {{adapting the}} Boris Pasternak novel for television, screenwriter Andrew Davies revealed {{the task was}} [...] "daunting because the book is reckoned to be a masterpiece and the film is a great movie and one that I admire very much. Robert Bolt is the king of epic screenplay writers in my book. But as I got further into the book I kept thinking that I didn't agree with Robert Bolt about how to tell the story... <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>began</b> to feel much more excited." [...] He added, [...] "It was also a relief to find {{so much in the}} book that hadn't found its way into the first movie and could make great drama.... I thought the film does the spectacle really well. Rather surprisingly, it also explains the politics very well, but I thought it could do a better job on the relationships. It's probably a bit controversial, but I thought we could say more about Lara and Yuri and how they get together; about Lara's extraordinary situation {{at the beginning of the}} story and Yuri having a dreadful start to his life with his parents dying. None of these things really came out in the movie, but they are there in the book. I think that if they look at both versions now, people will probably think that this version in a lot of ways works better for our time. It's more contemporary. I think they'll find the performances are more subtle yet speak to us in our time. Maybe my script will seem out of date in 20 years time because a lot of them do, but watching the original film, I think the central performances look stilted and dated now." ...|$|E
