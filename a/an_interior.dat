5|$|Although {{dating from}} 1195 to about 1400, Lichfield Cathedral has <b>an</b> <b>interior</b> which {{presents}} a harmonious appearance, {{much of which}} is due to its having undergone extensive restoration and refurnishing in the 19th century. The nave is very fine and the Lady Chapel is apsidal with very tall windows, giving a rather French impression. Lichfield {{is the only one of}} the cathedrals to have retained three spires.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this work}} is to {{introduce}} the concept of L-fuzzy interior systems and L-fuzzy interior operators. We start by establishing a connection between L-fuzzy interior systems and L-fuzzy interior operators. It is shown that <b>an</b> L-fuzzy <b>interior</b> system is precisely the fuzzy system {{in opposition to the}} crisp system, and <b>an</b> L-fuzzy <b>interior</b> operator is <b>a</b> suitable <b>interior</b> operator that has a close relation to <b>an</b> L-fuzzy <b>interior</b> system. It is also shown that there is a Galois correspondence between the category of L-fuzzy interior system spaces and that of L-fuzzy interior spaces...|$|R

However, in the practical implementation, we often select an arbitrary point {{as the starting point}} when it is difficult to find <b>a</b> feasible <b>interior</b> point for some large-scale (GLMP) problems.

5|$|After architects Mario Bellini and Rudy Ricciotti had won an {{international}} competition to create its new galleries for Islamic art, the new 3,000 sq m pavilion eventually opened in 2012, consisting of ground- and lower-ground-level interior spaces {{topped by a}} golden, undulating roof (fashioned from almost 9,000 steel tubes that form <b>an</b> <b>interior</b> web) that seems to float within the neo-Classical Visconti Courtyard {{in the middle of}} the Louvre's south wing.

5|$|An Administrator was {{assisted}} {{by one or}} several Commandants (Duwei 都尉) also known as Chief Commandant, who handled all local military affairs such as raising militias, suppressing bandit groups, and building beacon towers. The Commandants' salary-rank was Equivalent to 2,000-dan. After 30 AD, all Commandants who were not located in distant frontier commanderies were abolished, yet if the commandery was located along borders where raids and armed incursions by hostile nomadic groups were frequent, he was still appointed. A Commandant in <b>an</b> <b>interior</b> commandery could only be appointed temporarily to deal with crises as they arose. Each commandery also had secretaries, a treasurer, and an Official in Charge of Accounts who submitted annual reports to the imperial court on the Administrator's performance.|$|E
5|$|Behaviorism {{dominated}} {{philosophy of}} mind {{for much of}} the 20th century, especially the first half. In psychology, behaviorism developed as a reaction to the inadequacies of introspectionism. Introspective reports on one's own interior mental life are not subject to careful examination for accuracy and cannot be used to form predictive generalizations. Without generalizability and the possibility of third-person examination, the behaviorists argued, psychology cannot be scientific. The way out, therefore, was to eliminate the idea of <b>an</b> <b>interior</b> mental life (and hence an ontologically independent mind) altogether and focus instead on the description of observable behavior.|$|E

5|$|Cerebral veins drain deoxygenated {{blood from}} the brain. The brain has two main {{networks}} of veins: an exterior or superficial network, {{on the surface of}} the cerebrum that has three branches, and <b>an</b> <b>interior</b> network. These two networks communicate via anastomosing (joining) veins. The veins of the brain drain into larger cavities the dural venous sinuses usually situated between the dura mater and the covering of the skull. Blood from the cerebellum and midbrain drains into the great cerebral vein. Blood from the medulla and pons of the brainstem have a variable pattern of drainage, either into the spinal veins or into adjacent cerebral veins.|$|E
5|$|Garrick {{commissioned}} Robert Adam and {{his brother}} James to renovate the theatre's interior, which they did in 1775. Their additions included an ornate ceiling and a stucco facade facing Bridges Street. This facade {{was the first time}} any structure that might be considered part of the theatre proper actually abutted the street: the building, like the 1663 original, had been built in the centre of the block, hemmed in by other structures. The narrow passage from Bridges street to the theatre now became <b>an</b> <b>interior</b> hallway; some theatre office space also went up behind the new facade.|$|E
