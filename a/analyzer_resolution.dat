40|$|Ultrafast (femtosecond) {{interferometric}} pump/probe {{techniques can}} be used to measure rates of population and quantum phase decay in complicated media such as liquids and solids. However, the levels probed in such systems are often inhomogeneously broadened or are part of a continuum of states. The use of broadband ultrafast lasers thus results in multiple levels being excited and detected. The inherent averaging due to this effect can alter the measured coherent response, thus affecting the information that can be retrieved on the phase decay. The importance of these effects is considered for the representative case of two-photon photoemission from metals.

40|$|Recent all-digital {{spread-spectrum}} clock generators {{allow the}} synthesis of clock signals with frequency-discontinuous behavior. Following the electromagnetic interference (EMI) test guidelines, this paper investigates {{for the first time}} the peak-level reduction of the spectrum (modulation gain) achievable by using frequency-discontinuous modulated signals in spread-spectrum clocking applications. In the paper, the spectrum of frequency-discontinuous clock signals, measured by a spectrum analyzer in peak-hold mode, is computed analytically in closed-form. This expression is used to formulate the problem of finding the optimal frequency-discontinuous modulated waveform as the solution of a non-linear differential equation. A suboptimal modulation waveform, that can be computed in closed-form, is also derived in this paper. To verify the effectiveness of developed approach, the spectrum of frequency modulated clock signals with different modulation waveforms and different modulation parameters (frequency deviation, modulation frequency) has been calculated for two different spectrum <b>analyzer</b> <b>resolution</b> bandwidths (100 kHz, 1 MHz).

40|$|Contrast phase imaging at {{infrared}} wavelengths {{is achieved}} through an extrinsic Fabry-Perot cavity in optical fiber. The micro-cavity is realized by approaching a cleaved fiber to {{a distance of}} about few tens of microns from the surface under test. The probe is a single mode fiber and is fed by a low-coherence source. The information is extracted from the reflected spectrum, that starts to be modulated by the interference when the fiber begins to interact with the sample. The measurement of the reflected optical intensity provides a map of the sample reflectivity, whereas from the analysis of the spectrum in the time/spatial domain, it is possible to extract topography and refractive index variations. This information is entangled in the contrast phase image obtained. In this work we review the system proposed in [19] in order to extract topography and local surface permittivity of biological samples. The system displays tridimensional images with a transverse resolution that is not limited by the numerical aperture NA of the scanning probe (as suggested by the Rayleigh limit), but it is related to the transverse field behavior of the electromagnetic field inside the micro-cavity.

40|$|GEMS is a {{new type}} of {{time-of-flight}} mass spectrometer based on an electrostatic energy <b>analyzer.</b> Mass <b>resolution</b> equals the energy <b>analyzer</b> kinetic energy <b>resolution,</b> which is set by its slit size. In GEMS, monochromatic ions enter the entrance slit at random times, and the gated ion deflection produced by the electrostatic field in the analyzer rejects ions that are inside the analyzer at gate onset, detecting those entering the analyzer after gate onset. This provides mass separation while overcoming the temporal and spatial spread problems typical of TOF applications. Paradoxically, GEMS works because all ion masses follow identical trajectories. GEMS is easily multiplied into two-dimensional arrays to increase sensitivity in space applications, requires relatively low voltages, and uses only a few electrical connections. Thus, it is easy to package GEMS as a small, low-power instrument for applications in harsh environments. A disadvantage of GEMS is that its output is the integral of the TOF spectrum and the derivative of the raw data must be taken, a procedure that is likely to add noise. A version of GEMS detecting un-deflected ions (u-GEMS) has been tested to demonstrate the time-integrated feature of the raw data but without the benefit of energy analysis. This paper describes GEMS implemented with the small deflection energy analyzer (SDEA), a compact version of the parallel plate energy analyzer.

40|$|Many {{methods for}} EMI {{suppression}} {{have been developed}} in the last fifty years, most of them, showing a hardly change in its implementation. Traditional tools for EMI suppression {{are related to the}} use of filters, shielding techniques and new methods for layout improvement. These hardware techniques are normally supported with waveform shapes having themselves a lower spectral content. This kind of signals makes part of a different concept of EMI suppression that consists of limiting the spectral content in the signal itself. When possible, just waveforms with a lower spectral content should be used, this way making easier, simpler and cheaper the use of filters and other suppression means. In this line, EMI-reduction techniques such a Spread Spectrum Clock Generation (SSCG) are contributing to eliminate or limit the problem at the root, that is, at the signal itself. This thesis is developed in several parts, corresponding to different chapters. A summary of these chapters is presented onwards: After introduction in chapter 1, a wide theoretical development of the modulation and related concepts are presented in chapter 2. It is explained generically all aspects related to the modulation and particularly, to the frequency modulation. Main parameters of frequency modulation are presented and explained in detail and how practical considerations may affect to the theoretical behaviour of these parameters. Because the theoretical part of this thesis is completely based on the fundamentals of Fourier Transform, a sufficient explanation was thought to include for its right understanding. Finally, all this knowledge is summarized in a computational algorithm (MATLAB environment), capable of generating any frequency modulation of a sinusoidal carrier and the corresponding spectral components resulting from the modulation process. Chapter 3 takes profit of the results obtained in Chapter 2 where it is possible to obtain the theoretical behaviour of the different modulation profiles of interest: sinusoidal, triangular, exponential and mixed waveforms. This way, chapter 3 is intended to completely understand and analyze the theoretical behaviour of these modulation profiles and be quantified according to several significant measure parameters. Afterwards, a comparison of these modulation profiles is carried out by means of the measure parameters defined previously. A proposal of control for a real power converter and theoretical considerations to apply a certain SSCG method to switching power converters are also included in this chapter. After all aspects of frequency modulation by means of SSCG methods have been theoretically developed, it is mandatory the verification of the theoretical conclusions through an experimental test plant. Chapter 4 starts with the description, theoretical calculation and physical implementation of this test plant. Most practical considerations are here dealt with, like the influence of the Spectrum <b>Analyzer's</b> <b>Resolution</b> Bandwidth (RBW) on the measured EMI, a proposal of a practical method to select a valuable SSCG technique applied to Switching Power Converters, comparative measurements of conducted EMI within the range of conducted emissions (0 Hz 30 MHz) and a proposal about SSCG as a method to avoid interfering a certain signal.

In a LEF the restoring (reflecting) force that an ion experiences in the direction parallel to the field is proportional to the depth it travels into the LEF region, and its equation of motion in that direction is that of a simple harmonic oscillator. Consequently, an ion's travel time is independent of its initial angle and energy and is simply proportional to the square root of the ion's mass/charge (m/q). The measured m/q resolution, (m/q) /Delta(m/q), for a small LEF-based prototype that we have developed and tested is approximately 20. In addition, our laboratory measurements with the prototype instrument show that characteristic time-of-flight spectra allow the resolution of atomic and molecular species with nearly identical m/q values. The measured response of the prototype is in excellent agreement with computer simulations of the device. Advanced design work using this computer simulation indicates that three-dimensional plasma composition <b>analyzers</b> with m/q <b>resolutions</b> of at least 50 are readily achievable...|$|R
40|$|Emission {{inventories}} of elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) contain large uncertainties {{both in their}} spatial and temporal distributions for different source types. An inverse model {{was used to evaluate}} EC and OC emissions based on 1 year of hourly measurements from the St. Louis–Midwest supersite. The input to the model consisted of continuous measurements of EC and OC obtained for 2002 using two semicontinuous <b>analyzers.</b> High <b>resolution</b> meteorological simulations were performed for the entire time period using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF). These were used to simulate hourly back trajectories at the measurement site using a Lagrangian model (FLEXPART-WRF). In combination, an Eulerian model (CAMx: The Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions) was used to simulate the impacts at the measurement site using known emissions inventories for point and area sources from the Lake Michigan Directors Consortium (LADCO) as well as for open burning from the Fire Inventory from NCAR (FINN). By considering only passive transport of pollutants, the Bayesian inversion simplifies to a single least squares inversion. The inverse model combines forward Eulerian simulations with backward Lagrangian simulations to yield estimates of emissions from sources in current inventories as well as from emissions that might be missing in the inventories. The CAMx impacts were disaggregated into separate time chunks in order to determine improved diurnal, weekday and monthly temporal patterns of emissions. Because EC is a primary species, the inverse model estimates can be interpreted directly as emissions. In contrast, OC is both a primary and a secondary species. As the inverse model does not differentiate between direct emissions and formation in the plume of those direct emissions, the estimates need to be interpreted as contributions to measured concentrations. Emissions of EC and OC in the St. Louis region from on-road, non-road, marine/aircraft/railroad (MAR), "other" and point sources were revised slightly downwards on average. In particular, both MAR and point sources had a more pronounced diurnal variation than in the inventory. The winter peak in "other" emissions was not corroborated by the inverse model. On-road emissions have a larger difference between weekday and weekends in the inverse estimates than in the inventory, and appear to be poorly simulated or characterized in the winter months. The model suggests that open burning emissions are significantly underestimated in the inventory. Finally, contributions of unknown sources seems to be from areas to the south of St. Louis and from afternoon and nighttime emissions...|$|R
40|$|The {{design and}} {{performance}} of a new miniature cylindrical mirror analyzer (CMA) are presented. The CMA comprises outer and inner cylinders, an integral on-axis electron gun, and a detector system consisting of ring aperture and channeltron, all mounted on a single 2. 75 in. (70 mm o. d.) Conflat flange. Entrance angle, sample-to-detector distance, and polar cone angle were chosen, in consideration of second order focusing effects, which optimized <b>analyzer</b> transparency and <b>resolution.</b> Fringe field correction {{at the ends of}} the CMA is made by means of six rings precisely separated by sapphire insulators. The electron gun is a one-lens electrostatic system equipped with an x-y deflector for beam adjustment and scanning. A CeB 6 low temperature cathode operating at up to - 3. 0 keV delivers emission current up to 100 muA. The energy range of analyzed electrons can be varied between 0 eV and 3. 0 keV. The flange mounting also incorporates a high precision z-motion drive for optimization of the working distance. The control electronics and software permit operation of the instrument in pulse and analog phase sensitive detection modes. Results obtained with this new mini CMA for a W(100) surface demonstrate an energy resolution (DeltaE/E) of 0. 9 %, which is comparable to larger 6 in. (152 mm) flange-mounted instruments. The very small size of the mini CMA permits its use in small or crowded ultrahigh vacuum chambers or where only 2. 75 in. ports are available, thereby increasing flexibility in surface analysis.

40|$|Abstract. The energy {{resolution}} of a VUV isochromat spectrometer mploying the traditional energy selective Geiger counter can be significantly improved. The variance of the optical resolution function {{with the usual}} CaF 2 entrance window is (240 meV) 2. With SrF 2 we obtain (113 meV) 2 at room temperature and (73 meV) 2 at 70 ~ A direct confirmation of these data, which were derived from a moment analysis of the threshold behaviour of an Au isochromat is provided by a measurement of image potential states at Cu(001). PACS: 07. 65. Eh, 79. 60. -i Inverse photoemission experiments (IPE) employing the energy-selective G iger-Mfiller counter based on the transmission properties of CaF z and the molecular photoionization threshold of iodine offer simple design and excellent sensitivity [1 - 3]. Yet the limited {{energy resolution}} of such a setup has often been criticized. In fact, improved resolution is quite desirable for the precision measurement of image potential states and their dispersion [4, 5], dispersions of 4 f energy bands in rare earths [61 spin-split-energy bands in itinerant ferromagnets [7], etc. In regular photoemission energy resolutions as high as 40 meV have been achieved already ears ago. This has provided {{a number of new}} and interesting data [8, 9]. In regular photoemission employing rare-gas resonance lamps the total experimental resolution is identical to the resolution of the energy <b>analyzer.</b> The overall <b>resolution</b> of an inverse photoemission experi-ment, on the other hand, is limited by the optical resolution of the radiation detector and the energy spread of the incident electrons.

40|$|Deep proteomic {{analysis}} of mammalian cell lines would yield {{an inventory of}} {{the building blocks of}} the most commonly used systems in biological research. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics can identify and quantify proteins in a global and unbiased manner and can highlight the cellular processes that are altered between such systems. We analyzed 11 human cell lines using an LTQ-Orbitrap family mass spectrometer with a “high field” Orbitrap mass <b>analyzer</b> with improved <b>resolution</b> and sequencing speed. We identified a total of 11, 731 proteins, and on average 10, 361 ± 120 proteins in each cell line. This very high proteome coverage enabled {{analysis of}} a broad range of processes and functions. Despite the distinct origins of the cell lines, our quantitative results showed surprisingly high similarity in terms of expressed proteins. Nevertheless, this global similarity of the proteomes did not imply equal expression levels of individual proteins across the 11 cell lines, as we found significant differences in expression levels for an estimated two-third of them. The variability in cellular expression levels was similar for low and high abundance proteins, and even many of the most highly expressed proteins with household roles showed significant differences between cells. Metabolic pathways, which have high redundancy, exhibited variable expression, whereas basic cellular functions such as the basal transcription machinery varied much less. We harness knowledge of these cell line proteomes {{for the construction of a}} broad coverage “super-SILAC” quantification standard. Together with the accompanying paper (Schaab, C. MCP 2012, PMID: 22301388) (17) these data can be used to obtain reference expression profiles for proteins of interest both within and across cell line proteomes...|$|R
