6000|$|... ‘Mr. Crisparkle,’ {{returned}} the prudent Dean, ‘I claim no authority in your house. I merely confer with you, on the painful necessity {{you find yourself}} under, of depriving this young man of the great <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> counsel and instruction.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Tony," [...] says Mr. Guppy, {{taking his}} arm again and walking him slowly on, [...] "I {{should like to}} know, in a {{friendly}} way, whether you have yet thought over the many <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> continuing to live at that place?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'A {{somewhat}} strange business,' {{said the}} Doctor; 'and indeed I {{am not a}} little glad to have the <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> advice and assistance.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you must}} {{remember}} Beacon Street," [...] Mrs. Farrinder subjoined. [...] "You must take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> position--you must wake up the Back Bay!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{certainly}} take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> permission, Lady Cranston," [...] {{were the}} farewell words of this unusual visitor as he bowed himself out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Hartley," [...] {{she said}} hesitatingly, [...] "I hardly {{know what to}} say to you. I realize all the <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> offer, and {{sometimes}} I feel sure that I could be contented with you. But, again, I am doubtful. I was born a city girl, and I am afraid to bind myself to a quiet suburban life." ...|$|E
60|$|You {{know how}} hard I work for what I get, and I think you know that I never had money help from any human {{creature}} after I was a child. You {{know that you are}} one of many heavy charges on me, and that I trust to your so exercising your abilities and improving the <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> past expensive education, as soon to diminish this charge. I say no more on that head.|$|E
6000|$|... "You must lose {{no time in}} {{committing}} it to paper, young man," [...] said Bardo, {{with growing}} interest. [...] "Doubtless you remember much, if you aided in transcription; for when I was your age, words wrought themselves into my mind {{as if they had}} been fixed by the tool of the graver; wherefore I constantly marvel at the capriciousness of my daughter's memory, which grasps certain objects with tenacity, and lets fall all those minutiae whereon depends accuracy, the very soul of scholarship. But I apprehend no such danger with you, young man, if your will has seconded the <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> training." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] {{interrupted}} Mr Clearemout; [...] "I {{shall be}} {{very glad to}} take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> kind offer. Service, you say, begins at--" ...|$|R
6000|$|PROSERPINE (highly incensed). He'll be {{all right}} {{now that he has}} the <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>YOUR</b> {{polished}} conversation: that's one comfort, anyhow. (She begins to typewrite with clattering asperity.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If I {{were a great}} {{electrician}} I {{should know}} what to ask," [...] he said. [...] "But I am too ignorant to take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> kind offer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pardon me, sir," [...] {{said the}} captain, in his loftiest manner. [...] "If you have secrets to keep, {{you have only}} to say so, and I have done. I intrude on no man's secrets. At the same time, Mr. Vanstone, you must allow me to recall to your memory that I met you {{yesterday}} without any reserves on my side. I admitted you to my frankest and fullest confidence, sir--and, highly as I prize the <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> society, I can't consent to cultivate your friendship on any other than equal terms." [...] He threw open his respectable frock-coat and surveyed his visitor with a manly and virtuous severity.|$|E
60|$|Judge, my dear Sir, of our {{surprise}} at finding your censure directed against those whose only crime was in accusing the ministers {{of not having}} prevented your demands by our graces, of not having given you the natural <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> country in the most ample, the most early, and the most liberal manner, and for not having given away authority {{in such a manner}} as to insure friendship. That you should make the panegyric of the ministers is what I expected; because, in praising their bounty, you paid a just compliment to your own force. But that you should rail at us, either individually or collectively, is what I can scarcely think a natural proceeding. I can easily conceive that gentlemen might grow frightened at what they had done,--that they might imagine they had undertaken a business above their direction,--that, having obtained a state of independence for their country, they meant to take the deserted helm into their own hands, and supply by their very real abilities the total inefficacy of the nominal government. All these might be real, and might be very justifiable motives for their reconciling themselves cordially to the present court system. But I do not so well discover the reasons that could induce them, at the first feeble dawning of life in this country, to do all in their power to cast a cloud over it, and to prevent the least hope of our effecting the necessary reformations which are aimed at in our Constitution and in our national economy.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this note is to {{introduce}} you to today’s world of work and to outline the skills, strategies, and actions you will need to contribute to and to prosper in it. You will be some of the best-prepared young people in the world. You bring to work a world-class scientific, mathematical, and technical education, and you will now complement that with knowledge of the economic and social context of work and organizations. This is exactly the mix of technical and behavioral skills that employers look for in new recruits. With the <b>advantages</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> education come high expectations and considerable responsibilities. You will be expected to hit the ground running–to use your talents to improve the welfare of the organizations that employ you, the people you work with, the people whom you will eventually supervise and manage, and the communities and societies in which you will live. In short, as graduates of MIT, you are expected to be a leader in the economies and societies of the future. Realizing your potential requires an understanding of the changing nature of work. In contrast to most management writing, which looks at work from the top dow...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Nobody knows you, {{and it is}} {{unimportant}} how you look; and, as {{you have}} some very nice things here, I am going to take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> kindness and--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You see why I am {{inclined}} to push matters against our gentleman {{though he is}} your guest. It seems to me he has been taking <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> paternal--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{all know}} how good you are--how unselfish--how you {{sacrifice}} yourself to others. But you've been too unselfish, Katharine. You have made Cassandra happy, and she has taken <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> goodness." ...|$|R
6000|$|Though she did {{not draw}} back, her face flushed, and she thrilled as she had thrilled once before in her life. [...] "You take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> own goodness," [...] she rebuked him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let me not {{interrupt}} your praying, my liege," [...] {{said the}} Prince, lightly. [...] "Your Grace Was invoking Heaven {{in behalf of}} some one--an enemy doubtless, for these have the frequent <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> orisons." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have proved}} my courage too often," [...] he said, [...] "to {{be under the}} {{necessity}} of killing you for this blow. Since my honour is safe I will not take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> overwrought condition." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha!" [...] exclaimed the latter, {{suddenly}} {{throwing his}} knife {{on the ground}} within Rosco's reach, [...] "see, I scorn to take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> unarmed condition. Take that and defend yourself. I will content myself with this." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{thank you}} most heartily, sir," [...] Edgar said, [...] "and should the time come when, as you say, {{circumstances}} may occur {{in which we}} can take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> most generous offers, we will do so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Aurora," [...] {{he said in}} a faint voice, [...] "the rapture in {{my heart}} {{prevents}} my taking <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> sweet words. Forgive me, and let us go quietly in, with the vision I have seen, for I know my place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{are most}} generous, President," [...] he said, with some {{hesitation}} over the title, [...] "and I will take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> generosity {{to express the}} doubts which, I must confess, we moderns have about such things as--er--the Nicaraguan independence." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Monsieur," [...] that stern, proud man was saying, [...] "I cannot take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> ignorance. If {{these ladies}} can persuade you to save me, {{at least it}} is due {{to you that you}} shall know whom you are saving." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Bouncer, {{after another}} minute's consideration, {{said that he}} thought he would not do so.

6000|$|... "You {{are a very}} foolish person," [...] she said, {{a little}} more kindly. [...] "You do not know who I am, or {{anything}} about me. Some day or other you will be very glad that I did not take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> kindness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I regret {{you even}} imagine I could take an dishonorable <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> daughter. God forbid that I should ever bring sorrow upon Miss Savine. All I ask {{is a fair}} field {{and the right to}} help her {{according}} to her need." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "We {{are very}} much indebted to you for your thoughtfulness," [...] Ram Singh answered; [...] "but we will not take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> kind offer. Since Nature has driven us here we intend {{to have a look}} about us before we leave." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well," [...] I answered, [...] "it's not so {{much for}} my own sake as for a friend of mine. However, I don't suppose she will go out much for some little time after this. When she does I will take <b>advantage</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> offer." ...|$|R
