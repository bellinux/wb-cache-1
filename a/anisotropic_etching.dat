40|$|We {{investigate}} the etching of a pure hydrogen plasma on graphite samples and graphene flakes on SiO$_ 2 $ and hexagonal Boron-Nitride (hBN) substrates. The pressure and distance {{dependence of the}} graphite exposure experiments reveals the existence of two distinct plasma regimes: the direct and the remote plasma regime. Graphite surfaces exposed directly to the hydrogen plasma exhibit numerous etch pits of various size and depth, indicating continuous defect creation throughout the etching process. In contrast, <b>anisotropic</b> <b>etching</b> forming regular and symmetric hexagons starting only from preexisting defects and edges {{is seen in the}} remote plasma regime, where the sample is located downstream, outside of the glowing plasma. This regime is possible in a narrow window of parameters where essentially all ions have already recombined, yet a flux of H-radicals performing <b>anisotropic</b> <b>etching</b> is still present. At the required process pressures, the radicals can recombine only on surfaces, not in the gas itself. Thus, the tube material needs to exhibit a sufficiently low H radical recombination coefficient, such a found for quartz or pyrex. In the remote regime, we {{investigate the}} etching of single layer and bilayer graphene on SiO$_ 2 $ and hBN substrates. We find isotropic etching for single layer graphene on SiO$_ 2 $, whereas we observe highly <b>anisotropic</b> <b>etching</b> for graphene on a hBN substrate.
