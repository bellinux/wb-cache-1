40|$|Fallowing {{farmland}} {{is one of}} {{the ways}} of keeping soil excluded from agricultural pro-duction. A fallow field is not cultivated or cropped for many years. Proper management of fallow land can bring meaurable profits for both the producer and the soil environment. The purpose of this study has been to evaluate the abundance of soil in avialable forms of phosphorus, potassium and magnesium on farmland excluded from production. In 1996, an experiment was run, comprising five treatments: a bare fallow field, a field turfed with fodder galega (Galega orientalis Lam.), a classical fallow field, a fallow field covered with fodder galega (Galega orientalis Lam.) with <b>awnless</b> <b>bromegrass</b> (Bromus intermis) and a fallow field sown with <b>awnless</b> <b>bromegrass</b> (Bromus intermis). The only agritechnical tre-atment performed periodically was mechanical weeding of the bare fallow. The plant bio-mass grown on plant-covered treatments remained on field every year. Plant material was sampled only for tests. Once the growing season finished, soil samples were taken from each treatment in four replicates from the 0 - 25 cm and 25 - 50 cm deep layers. The soil samples were assayed in order to determine concentrations of available forms of phsopho...|$|E
