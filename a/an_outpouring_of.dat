5|$|Ghomeshi, in {{introducing}} the band, mentioned the acting credentials of Thornton, but never based his questions to Thornton about his show business career. Thornton {{went on to}} say that Canadian audiences were generally reserved and that the band was used to playing in places where people move around and throw things at each other. He then added, 'it's like mashed potatoes with no gravy.' This caused <b>an</b> <b>outpouring</b> <b>of</b> criticism from across Canada and around the world for the star's behavior.|$|E
5|$|Initial Vulcanian {{activity}} {{is characterized by}} a series of short-lived explosions, lasting a few minutes to a few hours and typified by the ejection of volcanic bombs and blocks. These eruptions wear down the lava dome holding the magma down, and it disintegrates, leading to much more quiet and continuous eruptions. Thus an early sign of future Vulcanian {{activity is}} lava dome growth, and its collapse generates <b>an</b> <b>outpouring</b> <b>of</b> pyroclastic material down the volcano's slope.|$|E
5|$|Lennon's murder {{triggered}} <b>an</b> <b>outpouring</b> <b>of</b> grief {{around the}} world on an unprecedented scale. Lennon's remains were cremated at Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, Westchester County, N.Y.; no funeral was held. Ono sent word to the chanting crowd outside the Dakota that their singing had kept her awake; she asked that they re-convene at Central Park's Naumburg Bandshell the following Sunday for ten minutes of silent prayer. On 14 December 1980, millions of people {{around the world}} responded to Ono's request to pause for ten minutes of silence to remember Lennon. Thirty thousand gathered in Liverpool, and the largest group—over 225,000—converged on New York's Central Park, close to the scene of the shooting. For those ten minutes, every radio station in New York City went off the air.|$|E

5|$|The {{deaths of}} the men {{galvanized}} the missionary effort in the United States, sparking <b>an</b> <b>outpouring</b> <b>of</b> funding for evangelization efforts around the world. Their work is still frequently remembered in evangelical publications, and in 2006 {{was the subject of}} the film production End of the Spear. Several years after the death of the men, the widow of Jim Elliot, Elisabeth, and the sister of Nate Saint, Rachel, returned to Ecuador as missionaries with the Summer Institute of Linguistics (now SIL International) to live among the Huaorani. This eventually led to the conversion of many, including some of those involved in the killing. While largely eliminating tribal violence, their efforts exposed the tribe to increased influence from the outside.|$|E
5|$|The {{first ten}} episodes were seen {{by an average}} of 1.55 million viewers in the United States, {{increasing}} to 2.2 million when time-shifted viewings were taken into account.

The introduction of the new character Kate Freelander (Darshi) was also met with mixed reactions, while there was <b>an</b> <b>outpouring</b> <b>of</b> fans against Ashley's demise. Season two won seven Leo Awards after its release. The season was released on a four-disc set on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on June 9, 2010 in Region 4, June 15 in Region 1, and October 4 in Region 2.|$|E
5|$|A Welsh shipbroker, W. J. Orders, {{organised}} {{a collection}} fund {{on the floor}} of the Cardiff Coal Exchange and floated a public testimonial of one shilling. The national response was considerable and within weeks the total was into hundreds of pounds. This drew the Welsh Football Union (WFU) into a confrontation with the IRFB, as rule 2 on professionalism stated that no player was allowed to receive money from his club, or any member of his club, for services rendered to football. The fund could have been seen as a professional fee to Gould, henceforth making him ineligible to play for his country. The WFU argued that the money raised was not given by the club, but rather <b>an</b> <b>outpouring</b> <b>of</b> thanks from the Welsh public to a national hero.|$|E

5|$|In mid-October, Rush’s son, Huey, was murdered, leading Obama {{to put his}} {{campaign}} on hold. Governor George Ryan called the Illinois Legislature to a special session to re-enact a package of gun-safety bills, a pet issue of Rush, which had been overturned by the Illinois Supreme Court. Obama supported the package, but the session dragged on towards Christmas. Obama annually spent the Christmas vacation in Hawaii with his family visiting his grandmother, who raised him. Obama left Illinois, expecting the session would continue into January. However, a crucial vote took place earlier than expected, failing by five votes with Obama and others absent. Obama came under fire for missing the vote though {{he said he would}} have flown back sooner, but his 18-month-old daughter was sick. Meanwhile, Rush received <b>an</b> <b>outpouring</b> <b>of</b> sympathy that aided {{his campaign}}.|$|E
5|$|Nasser's {{popularity}} in Egypt and the Arab world skyrocketed after his nationalization of the Suez Canal {{and his political}} victory in the subsequent Suez Crisis. Calls for pan-Arab unity under his leadership increased, culminating {{with the formation of}} the United Arab Republic with Syria (1958–1961). In 1962, Nasser began a series of major socialist measures and modernization reforms in Egypt. Despite setbacks to his pan-Arabist cause, by 1963 Nasser's supporters gained power in several Arab countries, but he became embroiled in the North Yemen Civil War. He began his second presidential term in March 1965 after his political opponents were banned from running. Following Egypt's defeat by Israel in the 1967 Six-Day War, Nasser resigned, but he returned to office after popular demonstrations called for his reinstatement. By 1968, Nasser had appointed himself prime minister, launched the War of Attrition to regain lost territory, began a process of depoliticizing the military, and issued a set of political liberalization reforms. After the conclusion of the 1970 Arab League summit, Nasser suffered a heart attack and died. His funeral in Cairo drew five million mourners and <b>an</b> <b>outpouring</b> <b>of</b> grief across the Arab world.|$|E
