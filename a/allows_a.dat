5|$|A {{downline}} is a rope {{leading from}} the surface down to the underwater workplace.

5|$|Although Fleming {{provided}} no dates within his novels, two writers have identified different timelines based on events and situations within the novel series as a whole. John Griswold and Henry Chancellor—both {{of whom have}} written books on behalf of Ian Fleming Publications—put the events of Casino Royale in 1951; Griswold <b>allows</b> <b>a</b> possible second timeframe and considers the story could {{have taken place in}} either May to July 1951, or May to July 1952.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimate}} of a horse's age {{can be made}} from looking at its teeth. The teeth continue to erupt throughout life and are worn down by grazing. Therefore, the incisors show changes as the horse ages; they develop a distinct wear pattern, changes in tooth shape, and changes in the angle at which the chewing surfaces meet. This <b>allows</b> <b>a</b> very rough {{estimate of}} a horse's age, although diet and veterinary care can also affect the rate of tooth wear.|$|E
5|$|Antibody genes also re-organize in {{a process}} called class {{switching}} that changes the one type of heavy chain Fc fragment to another, creating a different isotype of the antibody that retains the antigen-specific variable region. This <b>allows</b> <b>a</b> single antibody {{to be used by}} different types of Fc receptors, expressed on different parts of the immune system.|$|E

5|$|Chuck Klein, Pat Seerey, and Mike Schmidt each {{hit their}} {{four in a}} game that went into extra innings. Scooter Gennett and Mark Whiten hit a grand slam as one of their four homers.

5|$|Compliance {{with the}} law is checked when {{vehicles}} pass through a weigh station, often located at the borders between states or {{on the outskirts of}} major cities, where the vehicle may be weighed and measured. The one exception to the formula <b>allows</b> <b>a</b> standard five-axle semi-truck configuration to weigh the maximum legal gross weight. This exception was specifically requested by the American Trucking Associations to allow tank trucks to reach the maximum legal gross weight without violating the bridge formula law.|$|E
5|$|Cortana on Windows {{mobile and}} Android {{is capable of}} {{capturing}} device notifications and sending them to a Windows 10 device.

50|$|Crampton {{realised}} {{that the}} locomotives of the GWR {{were better than}} the standard gauge locomotives {{for a number of}} reasons. The broad gauge <b>allowed</b> <b>a</b> larger boiler diameter and higher centre of gravity for the same stability. Broad gauge also <b>allowed</b> <b>a</b> bigger firebox and heating area. Larger driving wheels gave a lower piston speed, which <b>allowed</b> <b>a</b> higher speed for the locomotive before exhaust problems occurred.|$|R
50|$|On June 15, , in a {{game against}} the Toronto Blue Jays, Eyre <b>allowed</b> <b>a</b> 1-out sac fly run, ending his streak of 33 {{consecutive}} appearances without <b>allowing</b> <b>a</b> run, a Cubs franchise record.|$|R
50|$|October 9: With the 1-0 shutout over Wayne State, the Gophers {{have not}} <b>allowed</b> <b>a</b> goal in 180 minutes. Dating {{back to the}} 2009-10 season, Minnesota has not <b>allowed</b> <b>a</b> goal in 200:45 minutes played.|$|R
5|$|DAB {{has also}} been marketed as having two major {{advantages}} over analogue radio broadcasting in that using MPEG-1 Audio Layer II lossy audio compression technology and more recently DAB+ using High-Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding, parts of the audio spectrum that cannot be heard by humans are discarded, meaning less data needs to be sent over the air. This, as well as multiplexing technology, <b>allows</b> <b>a</b> number of channels to be broadcast together on one frequency as opposed to one channel for analogue radio broadcasts.|$|E
5|$|If cancer growth blocks a short {{section of}} bronchus, {{brachytherapy}} (localized radiotherapy) {{may be given}} directly inside the airway to open the passage. Compared to external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy <b>allows</b> <b>a</b> reduction in treatment time and reduced radiation exposure to healthcare staff. Evidence for brachytherapy, however, is less than that for external beam radiotherapy.|$|E
5|$|In April 2006, Infinity Ward {{released}} the Call of Duty 2 Radiant, which <b>allows</b> <b>a</b> player {{to create their}} own multiplayer or single-player maps. Along with Radiant, the mapmaker includes Maya plug-in support, an effects editor, and an asset manager which allows custom models to be made and imported into the game, as well as custom effects.|$|E

50|$|All {{states that}} impose an {{individual}} income tax allow most business deductions. However, many states impose different limits on certain deductions, especially depreciation of business assets. Most {{of the states}} allow non-business deductions {{in a manner similar}} to federal rules.

5|$|In this episode, Q (John de Lancie) <b>allows</b> <b>a</b> {{supposedly}} deceased Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) to re-visit {{a pivotal}} event {{in his youth}} that he since regrets. Picard changes the past, but upon returning to the present he finds that it made him the man he became. He returns once more {{to the past and}} returns it to the way it originally took place. Picard wakes up in the present, unsure if the events took place or if it was {{as a result of his}} injury.|$|E
5|$|It {{can also}} be seen however that this simple 2-dimensional model, {{essentially}} an inverted pendulum on a turntable, predicts that the steady-state turn is unstable. If the bike is displaced slightly downwards from its equilibrium lean angle, the torque of gravity increases, that of centrifugal force decreases and the displacement gets amplified. A more-sophisticated model that <b>allows</b> <b>a</b> wheel to steer, adjust the path, and counter the torque of gravity, is necessary to capture the self-stability observed in real bikes.|$|E
5|$|Players can pan {{around a}} map {{as the camera}} focuses on areas of intense fighting, and the Ghost Cam <b>allows</b> <b>a</b> player to roam freely around a map. The ability to take {{photographs}} is also featured, which enables the player to take a photo, which can be uploaded to the Gears of War website and is rated {{on the quality of}} action in the shot.|$|E

5|$|Powers {{of search}} and seizure are covered by Section 3, which also {{repealed}} the Obscene Publications Act 1857. This section <b>allows</b> <b>a</b> Justice of the Peace, if satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe obscene publications are kept on certain premises for profit, to issue a warrant for that location. This warrant <b>allows</b> <b>a</b> police officer to enter the premises, search them and remove any suspect publications; if such publications are found, the officer can also take records relating to the businesses trade. The articles must then be brought before a magistrate and either forfeited by the owners or returned. The owner, author or publisher of the articles, or the person from whom they were seized, may appear before the magistrate to argue why {{they should not be}} forfeited.|$|E
5|$|Seventy-five-move rule: Similar to the fifty-move rule; however, if {{the final}} {{move in the}} {{sequence}} resulted in checkmate, this takes precedence. As with the fivefold-repetition rule, this applies independently of claims by the players, and <b>allows</b> <b>a</b> tournament director to intervene. This rule likewise is a recent addition to the FIDE rules.|$|E
