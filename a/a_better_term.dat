25|$|Males {{fertilize}} females only by traumatic insemination {{into the}} structure called the ectospermalege (the organ of Berlese, however the organ of Ribaga, {{as it was}} first named, was first designated as an organ of stridulation. These two names are not descriptive, so other terminologies are used). On fertilization, the female's ovaries finish developing, which suggests that sperm plays a role other than fertilizing the egg. Fertilization also allows for egg production through the corpus allatum. Sperm remains viable in a female's spermathecae (<b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>term</b> is conceptacle), a sperm-carrying sack, {{for a long period}} of time as long as body temperature is optimum. The female lays fertilized eggs until she depletes the sperm found in her conceptacle. After the depletion of sperm, she lays a few sterile eggs. The number of eggs a C. lectularius female produces does not depend on the sperm she harbors, but on the female's nutritional level.|$|E

2500|$|In 1988, {{the civil}} rights leader Jesse Jackson urged Americans to use instead the term [...] "African American" [...] because it had a {{historical}} cultural base and was a construction similar to terms used by European descendants, such as German American, Italian American, etc. Since then, African American and black have often had parallel status. However, controversy continues over which {{if any of the}} two terms is more appropriate. Maulana Karenga argues that the term African-American is more appropriate because it accurately articulates their geographical and historical origin. Others have argued that [...] "black" [...] is <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>term</b> because [...] "African" [...] suggests foreignness, although Black Americans helped found the United States. Still others believe that the term black is inaccurate because African Americans have a variety of skin tones.

2500|$|To {{counter the}} {{influence}} of Russian and English, government organizations (namely the Terminology Commission of the Latvian Academy of Science and the State Language Center) try to popularize the use of Latvian terms and linguistic purism. Purism is often observed in the coining of new terms, which are usually disputed by the public– although purists have invented some euphonic words, many neologisms are widely seen as alien and unnecessary, as preexisting words could be used instead [...] For example, a heated debate arose when the Terminology Commission suggested that eira, with its Latvianized ending, would be <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>term</b> for euro than the widely used eiro. Other new terms are calques or new loanwords. For example, Latvian has two words for [...] "telephone"– tālrunis and telefons, the former being a direct translation into Latvian of the latter international term. Still others are older or more euphonic loanwords rather than Latvian words. For example, [...] "computer" [...] can be either dators or kompjūters. Both are loanwords (the native Latvian word for [...] "computer" [...] is skaitļotājs). However, {{for some time now}} dators has been considered an appropriate translation.|$|E
