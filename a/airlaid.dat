5000|$|The Danish {{inventor}} Karl Krøyer {{is considered}} to be the first who commercialized air-formed paper in the early 1980s. Others developed different processes independently at about the same time. A Finnish company United Paper Mills(now UPM-Kymmene Oyj) was one of the companies developing <b>airlaid</b> technology in the 1980s. In the 1980s UPM formed a new company called Walkisoft Oy and also built an <b>airlaid</b> factory to Kotka Finland which started in 1985. Walkisoft built several plants around the world (including the worlds largest airlaid-factory in Mt Holly, NC, USA) in the following 14 years before being sold to Buckeye Technologies Inc. The Walkisoft engineering team, which was responsible for the engineering and R&D of the <b>airlaid</b> machines became known as Buckeye Engineering Finland and from 2002-> as Anpap Oy, a private owned Finnish company.|$|E
5000|$|Staple {{nonwovens}} {{are made}} in 4 steps. Fibers are first spun, cut to a few centimeters length, and put into bales. The staple fibers are then blended, [...] "opened" [...] in a multistep process, dispersed on a conveyor belt, and spread in a uniform web by a wetlaid, <b>airlaid,</b> or carding/crosslapping process. Wetlaid operations typically use 0.25 to 0.75 in long fibers, but sometimes longer if the fiber is stiff or thick. <b>Airlaid</b> processing generally uses 0.5 to 4.0 in fibers. Carding operations typically use ~1.5" [...] long fibers. Rayon {{used to be a}} common fiber in nonwovens, now greatly replaced by polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene. Fiberglass is wetlaid into mats for use in roofing and shingles. Synthetic fiber blends are wetlaid along with cellulose for single-use fabrics. Staple nonwovens are bonded either thermally or by using resin. Bonding can be throughout the web by resin saturation or overall thermal bonding or in a distinct pattern via resin printing or thermal spot bonding. Conforming with staple fibers usually refers to a combination with melt blowing, often used in high-end textile insulations.|$|E

The <b>airlaid</b> fibres were stacked randomly while woven fabricswere stacked crosswisely (90 °) and impregnation was done manually. The fibre/ resinratio was 60 % to 40 %...|$|E

Although processing of cellulosic fibres in airstream has been utilised for decades in <b>airlaid</b> processes, no attempts to fractionate fibres in dry state have been reported. Our main {{goal is to}} determine how fibre properties and fibre consistency affect fibre flocculation and thus the behaviour of fibres in fractionation. Also evaluations of quality and capacity of fractionation operation are made. Pulp flocculation behaviour is measured with digital imaging and image recognition technique {{before and after the}} fractionation device. A double-view, orthogonal imaging approach is applied obtaining statistics of three-dimensional shape, dimensions and coordinates of detected fibre flocs. Fraction and fibre properties are determined with Metso Fractionator and Metso Fiberlab. Results show that fibre behaviour in a given system strongly depends on the pulp properties. Flocculation was found to be strongly dependent on fibre consistency. Evaluation of fractionation operation was done with help of calculations of mass-reject rates and separation efficiencies. Calculations showed that highest separation efficiencies can be achieved with system when mass-reject rate is between 0. 30 an...|$|E
