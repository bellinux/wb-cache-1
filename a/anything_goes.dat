25|$|As the Great Depression set {{in during}} the post-Broadway {{national}} tour of Show Boat, the public turned back to mostly light, escapist song-and-dance entertainment.

The revue The Band Wagon (1931) starred dancing partners Fred Astaire and his sister Adele, while Porter's <b>Anything</b> <b>Goes</b> (1934) confirmed Ethel Merman's position as the First Lady of musical theatre, a title she maintained for many years. Coward and Novello continued to deliver old fashioned, sentimental musicals, such as The Dancing Years, while Rodgers and Hart returned from Hollywood to create a series of successful Broadway shows, including On Your Toes (1936, with Ray Bolger, the first Broadway musical to make dramatic use of classical dance), Babes In Arms (1937) and The Boys From Syracuse (1938). Porter added DuBarry Was a Lady (1939).
