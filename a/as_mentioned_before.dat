25|$|Around 14% of orally {{ingested}} losartan is metabolized to its 5-carboxylic acid metabolite EXP 3174. <b>As</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> candesartan cilexetil and {{olmesartan medoxomil}} are inactive ester prodrugs that are completely hydrolyzed to their active forms by esterases during absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. These three metabolites are more potent AT1 receptor antagonists than their prodrugs. The other ARBs {{do not have}} active metabolites.|$|E

The 1981 NBA Finals set the standard for futility, with an average rating of 6.7, the lowest in NBA history until the 2003 NBA Finals averaged a 6.5 on ABC.|$|E

25|$|<b>As</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before</b> universally {{the purpose}} of students' union or student {{government}} is to represent fellow students. Many times student's unions usually focusing on providing students with facilities, support, and services. Simple variations on just the name include the name differences between the United States (student government) and other countries (student's union). Depending on the country there are different methods of representation compulsory education to Higher education or tertiary.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> for the {{formation}} of the Fresnel fringes, the constraint on the spatial coherence of the used radiation is very strict, which limits the method to small or very distant sources, but in contrast to crystal interferometry and analyzer-based imaging the constraint on the temporal coherence, i.e. the polychromaticity is quite relaxed. Consequently, the method cannot only be used with synchrotron sources but also with polycromatic laboratory X-ray sources providing sufficient spatial coherence, such as microfocus X-ray tubes.|$|E
25|$|Rapalogs, {{which are}} the first {{generation}} mTOR inhibitors, have proven effective {{in a range of}} preclinical models. However, the success in clinical trials is limited to only a few rare cancers. Animal and clinical studies show that rapalogs are primarily cytostatic, and therefore effective as disease stabilizers rather than for regression. The response rate in solid tumors where rapalogs have been used as a single-agent therapy have been modest. Due to partial mTOR inhibition <b>as</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> rapalogs are not sufficient for achieving a broad and robust anticancer effect, at least when used as monotherapy.|$|E

In Gundam: Battle Assault, <b>as</b> previously <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> the mobile suits are piloted by their correct pilots with some exceptions.|$|R

25|$|The faculties {{are parts}} of the {{university}}. Only the university {{as a whole is}} a legal personality. Nevertheless, the internal affairs of faculties are run by their respective self-governing bodies, which have similar rules and functions as those at the university level. Each faculty therefore has a Faculty Senate (also with students' and lecturers' curia), which among other things nominates the Dean (appointed by the Rector). <b>As</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> disciplinary misdemeanours are tried by the Faculty Disciplinary Commissions, while issues concerning study programmes are dealt with by the Faculty Scientific Boards. Each faculty has a Secretary instead of a Bursar.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> one of {{the most}} notable synesthetes is Solomon Shereshevsky, a {{newspaper}} reporter turned celebrated mnemonist, who was discovered by Russian neuropsychologist, Alexander Luria, to have a rare fivefold form of synesthesia. Words and text were not only associated with highly vivid visuo-spatial imagery but also sound, taste, color, and sensation. Shereshevsky could recount endless details of many things without form, from lists of names to decades-old conversations, but he had great difficulty grasping abstract concepts. The automatic, and nearly permanent, retention of every little detail due to synesthesia greatly inhibited Shereshevsky from understanding much of what he read or heard.|$|E
25|$|He patronized natural {{philosophers}} {{such as the}} botanist Charles de l'Ecluse, and {{the astronomers}} Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler both attended his court. Tycho Brahe developed the Rudolphine Tables (finished by Kepler, after Brahe's death), the first comprehensive table of data of {{the movements of the}} planets. <b>As</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> Rudolf also attracted some of the best scientific instrument makers of the time, such as Jost Bürgi, Erasmus Habermel and Hans Christoph Schissler. They had direct contact with the court astronomers and, through the financial support of the court, they were economically independent to develop scientific instruments and manufacturing techniques.|$|E

30|$|If {{the loss}} rate is zero, cwnd is finally {{determined}} to the halved value ofssthresh at line 8. Otherwise, reduced_cwnd is calculatedaccording to Equation (5) <b>as</b> we <b>mentioned</b> <b>before.</b> Equation (5) is represented inlines from 5 to 6 of the algorithm. After computing reduced_cwnd,cwnd is readjusted to {{the minimum value}} between the halved value ofssthresh and reduced_cwnd at line 8. By taking the minimumvalue, it enables to avoid burst losses caused by insufficient bandwidth as well asthe high loss rate.|$|R
25|$|On a {{professional}} level many use educational or occupational titles such as Architect, Engineer, Doctor, Attorney (often abbreviated as Arch./Archt./Ar., Engr., Dr. , and Atty. respectively), even on an informal or social level. Despite this, {{some of their}} clients (especially non-Filipinos) would address them as simply Mr. or Mrs./Ms. followed by their surnames (or even Sir/Ma'am) in conversation. It is very rare, however, for a Filipino (especially those born and educated abroad) to address Filipino architects, engineers, and lawyers, even mentioning and referring to their names, the non-Philippine (i.e. standard) English way. <b>As</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> this is prevalent in TV and film depictions.|$|E
25|$|The most {{versatile}} among dialkylboranes is 9-BBN. It exists predominantly as a dimer. It can be distilled without decomposition at 195°C (12mm Hg). Such property allows 9-BBN to react at 60–80°C, and most alkenes react within one hour in such temperature range. Even tetrasubstituted alkenes undergo hydroboration with 9-BBN at elevated temperature. <b>As</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> 9-BBN has excellent regioselectivity in hydroboration of alkenes. It is {{more sensitive to}} subtle steric differences than Sia2BH, because the rigid hetereocyclic substituents prevent internal rotation to relieve steric hindrance in the transition state. Reflecting its greater sensitivity to electronic factors, 9-BBN is more reactive towards alkenes than alkynes.|$|E
25|$|Lock {{numbering}} {{changed over}} the years. <b>As</b> <b>mentioned</b> <b>before,</b> Guard Lock No. 2 was numbered Lock 24 for a time, which could cause confusion with Riley's Lock, No 24, upstream. For {{a period of time}} in the early days, the locks were called by letters but that was later changed to numbers. Oddly enough, many of the lock numbers correspond to the contour elevation, e.g. Lock 26 is at the 260 foot elevation line, and lock 30 is at the 300 foot mark, although it is doubted that things were planned that way, and many locks do not correspond to the elevation, e.g. Lock 72 is at the 580 foot mark.|$|E
30|$|The rapid {{oscillations}} of the IMF Bz and {{the corresponding}} variations of the IEF Ey, most likely, were the reason {{of the difference in}} the EEJ measurements between the satellites <b>as</b> was <b>mentioned</b> <b>before.</b> For instance, during the observations of large-amplitude negative EEJ (row II in Figs.  2, 3, 4), SWA and SWC measured the EEJ at ~ 19.4  UT, i.e., during the maximum of the IEF Ey excursion, while SWB crossed the equator at ~ 19.7  UT, i.e., when the IEF Ey decreased strongly.|$|R
