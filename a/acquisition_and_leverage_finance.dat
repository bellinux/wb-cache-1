25|$|Corporate finance is the {{traditional}} aspect of investment banks, which involves helping customers raise funds in capital markets and giving advice on mergers <b>and</b> <b>acquisitions</b> (M); this may involve subscribing investors to a security issuance, coordinating with bidders, or negotiating with a merger target. A pitch book of financial information is generated to market the bank to a potential M client; if the pitch is successful, the bank arranges the deal for the client. The investment banking division (IBD) is generally divided into industry coverage and product coverage groups. Industry coverage groups focus on a specific industry—such as healthcare, public finance (governments), FIG (financial institutions group), industrials, TMT (technology, media, and telecommunications), P (power & energy), consumer/retail, food & beverage, corporate defense and governance—and maintain relationships with corporations within the industry to bring in business for the bank. Product coverage groups focus on financial products—such as mergers <b>and</b> <b>acquisitions,</b> <b>leveraged</b> <b>finance,</b> public finance, asset finance and leasing, structured finance, restructuring, equity, and high-grade debt—and generally work and collaborate with industry groups on the more intricate and specialized needs of a client.|$|R

40|$|The {{credit market}} turmoil since mid- 2007 has {{substantially}} affected {{the terms and}} conditions of funding in <b>leveraged</b> <b>finance</b> markets. Rising investor risk aversion, growing pressure on bank balance sheets {{and a loss of}} confidence in structured credit products have sharply reduced demand for leveraged loans. The materialisation of warehouse risks from failed leveraged loan syndications contributed to unwanted expansion of bank balance sheets and has affected credit supply. The knock-on effects from deteriorating conditions in leveraged loan markets have also affected private equity financing. Against the background of these developments, the working group report on private equity <b>and</b> <b>leveraged</b> <b>finance</b> markets under the chairmanship of Henk Brouwer of the Netherlands Bank addresses two broad questions.

40|$|A {{conceptual}} framework examining {{the relationship between}} corporate restructuring and outsourcing of key value-adding activities to external suppliers and partners is presented. The model proposes that the restructuring process serves as a catalyst {{to a series of}} complex changes within thejirm that make outsourcing an attractive alternative to internal investments in the development of new skills and capabilities. High levels of merger <b>and</b> <b>acquisition</b> activity, as well as leveraged buy-outs (LBOs), are expected to produce a diminished resource base for organizational learning and technology develop-ment. Continued reliance on outsourcing, in turn, can potentially “lock out ” the firm from participating in future technologies and new industries. During the 1980 s and early 199 Os, corporate restructuring was a popular strategy. Some of the more popular types of restructuring included mergers <b>and</b> <b>acquisitions</b> <b>and</b> <b>leveraged</b> buy-outs (LBOs) that substitute large amounts of debt for equity financing.

Credit risk solutions are key part of capital market transactions, involving debt structuring, exit financing, loan amendment, project <b>finance,</b> <b>leveraged</b> buy-outs, <b>and</b> sometimes portfolio hedging. Front office market risk activities provide service to investors via derivative solutions, portfolio management, portfolio consulting, and risk advisory. Well-known risk groups in JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Barclays engage in revenue-generating activities involving debt structuring, restructuring, syndicated loans, and securitization for clients such as corporates, governments, and hedge funds. J.P.
