40|$|The {{purpose of}} this multicenter study was to {{determine}} the accuracy and clinical value of a dedicated breast biopsy system which allows for MR-guided vacuum biopsy (VB) of contrast-enhancing lesions. In five European centers, MR-guided 11 -gauge VB was performed on 341 lesions. In 7 cases VB was unsuccessful. This was immediately realized on postinterventional images or direct follow-up combined with histopathology-imaging correlation; thus, a false-negative diagnosis was avoided. Histology of 334 successful biopsies yielded 84 (25 %) malignancies, 17 (5 %) <b>atypical</b> <b>ductal</b> <b>hyperplasias,</b> and 233 (70 %) benign entities. Verification of malignant or borderline lesions included re-excision of the biopsy cavity.

Methods and results: In 4164 breast core needle biopsies (CNB), 291 showed a CCL and 21 <b>atypical</b> <b>ductal</b> <b>hyperplasias</b> originated in a CCL (ADH-CCL). Mucin production was present in 17 of 291 (5. 8 %) CCLs and 3 of 21 (14. 3 %) ADH-CCLs, together concerning 0. 5 % of all CNBs. The most common mucinous CCL pattern was a columnar cell change without atypia and almost all were detected with microcalcifications as abnormality at mammography. During a median follow-up of 3. 1 years, no invasive carcinoma or DCIS was detected. MUC 2 was expressed in intraluminal mucin in 12 of 15 (80 %) mucinous CCLs and showed cytoplasmic expression in 5 of 15 (33 %) mucinous CCLs seen in CNBs. Moreover, mucinous CCLs were significantly more present in 46 mucinous carcinomas than in 46 ductal carcinomas (28 % vs 9 %). Conclusion: Mucinous CCLs are rare lesions with an incidence of about 0. 5 % of breast CNB, usually presenting with microcalcifications.

40|$|A viral {{etiology}} of human breast cancer (HBC) has been postulated for decades since {{the identification of}} mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV). The detection of MMTV env-like exogenous sequences (MMTVels) in 30 % to 40 % of invasive HBCs increased attention to this hypothesis. Looking for MMTVels during cancer progression may contribute {{to a better understanding}} of their role in HBC. Herein, we analyzed HBC preinvasive lesions for the presence of MMTVels. Samples were obtained by laser microdissection of FFPE tissues: 20 usual-type <b>ductal</b> <b>hyperplasias,</b> 22 <b>atypical</b> <b>ductal</b> <b>hyperplasias</b> (ADHs), 49 <b>ductal</b> carcinomas in situ (DCISs), 20 infiltrating ductal carcinomas (IDCs), and 26 normal epithelial cells collateral to a DCIS or an IDC. Controls included reductive mammoplastic tissue, thyroid and colon carcinoma, and blood samples from healthy donors. MMTVels were detected by fluorescence-nested PCR. DNA samples from the tissues of nine patients were analyzed by real-time quantitative PCR, revealing a different viral load correlated with stage of progression. Furthermore, as never previously described, the presence of MMTVels was investigated by chromogenic in situ hybridization. MMTVels were found in 19 % of normal epithelial cells collateral to a DCIS or an IDC, 27 % of ADHs, 82 % of DCISs, and 35 % of IDCs. No MMTVels were found in the control samples.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-five patients with mammographic microcalcifications classified as BI-RADS categories 3, 4 or 5 underwent MRI and biopsy with stereotactic vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB). Our gold standard was microhistology in all cases and histology with histological grading in patients who underwent surgery. Patients with a microhistological diagnosis of benign lesions underwent mammographic follow-up for at least 12 months. MRI was performed with a 1. 5 -Tesla (T) unit, and T 1 coronal three-dimensional (3 D) fast low-angle shot sequences were acquired before and after injection of paramagnetic contrast agent (0. 1 mmol/kg). MRI findings, according to the Fisher score, were classified into BI-RADS classes.

Forty-four patients with bloody or serosanguineous nipple discharge and negative mammographic findings (35 / 44 cases) underwent MRI for evaluation of breast ducts. Ultrasonography, negative in 18 patients, identified 26 cases of ductal ectasia (12 simple, nine with solid intraductal echoes and wall thickening, five with inhomogeneous parenchyma). Galactography was negative in three patients and positive in nine. Nineteen patients were followed up by clinical examination, ultrasonography, and cytological evaluation of nipple discharge (6 - 12 months); three patients underwent excisional biopsy, ten core biopsy and 12 cytological biopsy (followed by excisional biopsy). MRI identified 25 enhancing lesions Breast Imaging Reporting and Data Systems (BI-RADS) 3 or 4) and confirmed the galactographic findings (ductal ectasia, intraluminal filling defects). Five papillomatoses appeared as patchy, homogeneous enhancing areas, 15 intraductal papillomas as areas with well-defined margins and type II time-intensity curves, and two <b>atypical</b> <b>ductal</b> <b>hyperplasias</b> as diffuse nodular enhancement.

The specimens were 35 florid <b>ductal</b> <b>hyperplasias</b> (FDHs), 8 <b>atypical</b> <b>ductal</b> <b>hyperplasias</b> (ADHs), 12 well-differentiated intraductal carcinomas (WDICs), 20 intermediately differentiated intraductal carcinomas (IDICs), 14 poorly differentiated intraductal carcinomas (PDICs), 12 atypical lobular hyperplasias (ALHs), 12 type-A lobular carcinomas in situ (LCIS), 150 normal small-size ducts and 365 lobules. All FDHs, ADHs, WDICs, and lobular lesions showed low proliferation (Ki- 67 /MIB- 1), bcl- 2 positivity, and p 53 negativity; all PDICs expressed high proliferation, while 85 per cent and 7 per cent were p 53 and bcl- 2 positive respectively; IDICs showed high proliferation (50 per cent), bcl- 2 expression (70 per cent), and p 53 positivity (30 per cent), but no correlation between the expression of these markers was observed. Independent of the type of collateral lesion and age of the patient, 90 per cent and 10 per cent of small ducts/lobules showed low and high proliferation and diffuse and low bcl- 2 expression respectively; no p 53 positivity was observed. The modulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis control in ductal lesions could be the expression of a progression from hyperplasia/WDIC to PDIC, in which IDICs represent the link, owing to their immunoprofile. An alternative purely speculative hypothesis is that the different immunoprofile of the preinvasive lesions reflects their different origin in normal breast parenchyma. Low proliferative or bcl- 2 positive lobules could be the site of origin of the lesions maintaining this phenotype, namely FDHs, ADHs, WDICs and lobular lesions, while highly proliferative or bcl- 2 negative lobules could be the site in which PDICs develop. Consequently, preinvasive breast lesions could express a different regulation of apoptosis control and proliferative activity from the very beginning, rather than a modulation during neoplastic progression...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{evaluate}} the prevalence of occult breast carcinoma in surgical breast biopsies performed on nonpalpable breast lesions diagnosed initially as <b>atypical</b> <b>ductal</b> <b>hyperplasia</b> (ADH) by core needle biopsy. BACKGROUND: <b>Atypical</b> <b>ductal</b> <b>hyperplasia</b> is a lesion with significant malignant potential. Some authors note that ADH and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) frequently coexist in the same lesion. The criterion for the diagnosis of DCIS requires involvement of at least two ducts; otherwise, a lesion that is qualitatively consistent with DCIS but quantitatively insufficient is described as <b>atypical</b> <b>ductal</b> <b>hyperplasia.</b> Thus, the finding of ADH in a core needle breast biopsy specimen actually may represent a sample of a true in situ carcinoma. METHODS: Between May 3, 1994, and June 12, 1996, image-guided core biopsies of 510 mammographically identified lesions were performed using a 14 -gauge automated device with an average of 7. 5 cores obtained per lesion. <b>Atypical</b> <b>ductal</b> <b>hyperplasia</b> was found in 23 (4. 5 %) of 510 lesions, and surgical excision subsequently was performed in 21 of these cases. In these 21 cases, histopathologic results from core needle and surgical biopsies were reviewed and correlated. RESULTS: Histopathologic study of the 21 surgically excised lesions having ADH in their core needle specimens showed seven (33. 3 %) with DCIS.

From February 2003 to September 2007, 525 stereotactic VABs were performed on 504 women using an 11 -gauge needle device. Of these, 201 lesions were treated surgically. The concordance between VAB results and final pathology report after surgical excision was evaluated. Also examined was the impact of VAB on the quality of the surgical treatment. ResultsStereotactic VABs performed with an 11 -gauge device showed an underestimation rate of 23. 8 % for <b>atypical</b> <b>ductal</b> or lobular <b>hyperplasia</b> (AH). For <b>ductal</b> carcinoma in situ (DCIS) the underestimation rate was 31 % and the underestimation rate for lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) was 14 %. Only 38. 2 % of the patients with non-palpable lesions (201 / 525) were treated surgically and only 4 % (20 / 504) of the patients underwent more than one surgical intervention. The VAB underestimation caused mistakes in the planning of the surgical therapy in only 9 out of 201 interventions (4. 4 %).

40|$|Victor G Vogel Cancer Institute, Geisinger Health System, Danville, PA, USA Abstract: Risk factors {{allow us}} to define women who are at {{increased}} lifetime risk for breast cancer, {{and the most important}} factor is age. Benign breast disease increases risk, and the most important histologies are <b>atypical</b> lobular or <b>ductal</b> <b>hyperplasia</b> and lobular carcinoma in situ. Family history of breast cancer among first-degree relatives (mother, sisters, daughters) also increases risk. Quantitative measures of risk give accurate predictions of breast cancer incidence for groups of women but not for individual subjects. Multiple published, randomized controlled trials, which employed selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulators (SERMs), have demonstrated consistent reductions of 35 % or greater in the risk of ER-positive invasive and noninvasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Professional organizations in the US now recommend the use of SERMs {{to reduce the risk of}} breast cancer in high-risk, postmenopausal women. Raloxifene and tamoxifen reduce the risk of ER-positive invasive breast cancer with equal efficacy, but raloxifene is associated with a lower risk of thromboembolic disease, benign uterine conditions, and cataracts than tamoxifen in postmenopausal women. No evidence exists establishing whether a reduction in breast cancer risk from either agent translates into reduced breast cancer mortality. Overall quality of life is similar with raloxifene or tamoxifen, but the incidence of dyspareunia, weight gain, and musculoskeletal complaints is higher with raloxifene use, whereas vasomotor symptoms, bladder incontinence, gynecologic symptoms, and leg cramps were higher with tamoxifen use.

We screened papillary breast neoplasms for activating point mutations in PIK 3 CA, AKT 1, and RAS protein-family members, which are common in invasive ductal carcinomas. DNA extracts were prepared from sections of 89 papillary lesions, including 61 benign papillomas (28 without significant hyperplasia; 33 with moderate to florid hyperplasia), 11 papillomas with <b>atypical</b> <b>ductal</b> <b>hyperplasia,</b> 7 papillomas with carcinoma in situ, and 10 papillary carcinomas. Extracts were screened for PIK 3 CA and AKT 1 mutations using mass spectrometry; cases that were negative were further screened fo...|$|E
40|$|The prevalence, distribution, and {{clinical}} associations of pancreatic <b>ductal</b> mucinous <b>hyperplasia</b> were studied in 102 non-malignant pancreases. <b>Ductal</b> mucinous <b>hyperplasia</b> {{was found in}} over 60 % of specimens and was frequently associated with increased fibrosis [...] occasionally resembling pancreatitis. Significantly more <b>ductal</b> mucinous <b>hyperplasia</b> was found in pancreas from patients who were receiving corticosteroid treatment. Neither a history of hypercalcaemia {{in the three months}} before death, diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, tobacco smoking, nor the presence of gall stones was associated with an increase in <b>ductal</b> mucinous <b>hyperplasia.</b> The age of maximum prevalence, and the distribution of <b>ductal</b> mucinous <b>hyperplasia</b> in the pancreas were similar to those of pancreatic carcinoma. These similarities may be because both <b>ductal</b> mucinous <b>hyperplasia</b> and pancreatic carcinoma are proliferative responses, rather than because <b>ductal</b> mucinous <b>hyperplasia</b> is a precursor of pancreatic carcinoma...|$|R
40|$|Breast {{carcinoma}} is {{the most}} frequent tumor in the female population. Many factors can influence {{the risk of breast}} cancer; some of them, such as old age and breast cancer 1 / 2 (BRCA 1 /BRCA 2) gene mutations, are associated with a fourfold increase in risk. A previous diagnosis of <b>atypical</b> <b>ductal</b> or lobular <b>hyperplasia</b> or having a first-degree relative with a carcinoma are factors associated with a two-to fourfold increase in risk. A relative risk between 1 and 2 is associated with longer exposure to endogenous hormones as a result of early menarche, late menopause and obesity, or with recent and prolonged use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or with behavioural factors such as high alcohol and fat intake. Is it possible to modify breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women? Risk factors related to lifestyle can be changed, even if {{it is not clear whether}} modifying these behavioural factors during the postmenopausal period will influence the overall breast cancer risk. For instance, the influence of exogenous hormones throughout life (both oral contraceptives and HRT) should be evaluated according to the individual risk–benefit ratio. The problem is even more complex for women who carry genetic mutations and for those who have close relatives with breast cancer, who may be candidates for risk reduction strategies. Prophylactic bilateral mastectomy is still controversial, but is frequently offered to or requested by this group of women and may be indicated in BRCA 1 /BRCA 2 carriers. Chemoprevention with tamoxifen and with the new selective estrogen receptor modulators, namely raloxifene, is very promising and deserves a thorough discussion for all high-risk women.

40|$|AIM: To examine {{surgical}} {{specimens of}} pancreas with either chronic pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer {{in order to}} study whether <b>ductal</b> <b>hyperplasia</b> and dysplasia in pancreas represent precursor lesions for pancreatic cancer. METHODS: We examined expression of Ki- 67, CEA, p 53, and K-ras, in the surgical specimens of pancreas with adenocarcinomas (n = 11) and chronic pancreatitis (n = 12). Cellular proliferation was assessed by Ki- 67 proliferation index using the proliferation marker Ki- 67. In specimens with pancreas cancer, we divided pancreas epithelium into normal (n = 7), <b>ductal</b> <b>hyperplasia</b> (n = 3), dysplasia (n = 4), and cancerous lesion (n = 11) after hematoxylin and eosin staining, Ki- 67, an...|$|R
