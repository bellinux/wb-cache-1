5|$|The {{climb up}} or down from the summit plateau onto Swirral Edge is another well known {{accident}} spot. In winter it involves climbing down another snow cornice onto steep icy ground. There {{have been a number}} of accidents at this spot in recent years, making it <b>as</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>as</b> Striding Edge.|$|E
5|$|As {{would be}} {{expected}} for a road crossing the Pennines, Snake Pass has several dangerous bends and blind summits. Like many roads in the North of England passing through similar terrain, Snake Pass has a poor safety record in comparison to other roads in the United Kingdom {{but it is not}} <b>as</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>as</b> other roads bisecting hilly terrain in this part of England. It was not among the top 10 in a list of the most dangerous roads published in July 2010, despite nine of the top ten being in Northern England.|$|E
5|$|Most of Demosthenes' major orations were {{directed}} against the growing power of King Philip II of Macedon. Since 357BC, when Philip seized Amphipolis and Pydna, Athens had been formally {{at war with the}} Macedonians. In 352BC, Demosthenes characterised Philip as the very worst enemy of his city; his speech presaged the fierce attacks that Demosthenes would launch against the Macedonian king over the ensuing years. A year later he criticised those dismissing Philip as a person of no account and warned that he was <b>as</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>as</b> the king of Persia.|$|E

5|$|Hansen soon finds Bakharev, {{who tells}} him that to disable the radio jammer around the rig so he can contact Bennett, he will need Anischenko to get him past a retinal scanner. Bakharev is then dragged into an air duct and killed. Hansen learns that Kamsky and Bakharev were under orders to make the exocels <b>as</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>as</b> possible, which they had succeeded in doing, but without any way to control the {{resulting}} creatures. Hansen finds and kills Anischenko, removing his eye and using it to deactivate the radio jammer. Once {{back in touch with}} Bennett, Hansen is told he must find Kamsky's laptop and transmit the exocel research. Meanwhile, Anna is rescued from the sea by a large creature and left in a lab, where she is infected by an exocel. Seeing this take place on a security monitor, Hansen races to the lab to give Anna the antidote.|$|E
5|$|Under normal conditions, the Sun is {{so bright}} {{that it is}} {{difficult}} to stare at it directly. However, during an eclipse, with so much of the Sun covered, it is easier and more tempting to stare at it. Looking at the Sun during an eclipse is <b>as</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>as</b> looking at it outside an eclipse, except during the brief period of totality, when the Sun's disk is completely covered (totality occurs only during a total eclipse and only very briefly; it does not occur during a partial or annular eclipse). Viewing the Sun's disk through any kind of optical aid (binoculars, a telescope, or even an optical camera viewfinder) is extremely hazardous and can cause irreversible eye damage within a fraction of a second.|$|E
25|$|Another {{danger was}} that the {{friction}} igniter was very sensitive, a powerful blow to the grenade with the detonator inserted could set it off. This made the No 6 almost <b>as</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>as</b> the percussion cap grenades that {{it was designed to}} replace.|$|E

25|$|As a night bomber {{training}} unit, crews from Hixon {{were often}} sent on missions to France {{and sometimes even}} Germany to drop propaganda leaflets (PsyOps). These missions were often called after their codename, 'Nickel Raids'. These night-time raids were just <b>as</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>as</b> actual bombing runs as the enemy {{had no way of}} determining that they were only dropping leaflets.|$|E
25|$|Rousseau {{continues}} {{to say that}} though Greek and Roman society functioned well with tragic and violent content in theatres because {{it was part of}} the traditions specific to the time and place, putting these plays in a French context would be far more dangerous. However, tragedies are not <b>as</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>as</b> comedies, because the characters more closely resemble French citizens.|$|E
25|$|The Napoleonic scheme {{threatened}} {{not only}} the Sultan, but also Britain, Austria and Prussia, which was almost powerless {{in the face of}} such a potent alliance. The alliance naturally proved accommodating to the Austrians, who hoped that a joint Franco-Russian attack, which would probably have utterly devastated the Ottoman Empire, could be prevented by diplomacy; but if diplomatic measures failed, the Austrian minister Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich decided that he would support the partition of the Ottoman Empire—a solution disadvantageous to Austria, but not <b>as</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>as</b> a complete Russian takeover of Southeastern Europe.|$|E

The case was then once again appealed, to the Court of Cassation (Corte di Cassazione). On 28 December 2004, this court {{ruled in favor of}} the Antimafia Commission. It argued that as Montenegro was not a sovereign state, Đukanović had no diplomatic immunity.|$|R
25|$|Lasers in {{this class}} may cause damage if the beam enters the eye directly. This {{generally}} applies to lasers powered from 5–500mW. Lasers in this category can cause permanent eye damage with exposures of 1/100th of a second or more depending {{on the strength of}} the laser. A diffuse reflection is generally not hazardous but specular reflections can be just <b>as</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>as</b> direct exposures. Protective eyewear is recommended when direct beam viewing of ClassIIIb lasers may occur. Lasers at the high power end of this class may also present a fire hazard and can lightly burn skin.|$|E
25|$|Clarke {{retired from}} {{first-class}} cricket in 1990 with 942 wickets at 19.52, including three hat-tricks. Returning to Barbados, {{he continued to}} play club cricket in Bridgetown {{and served as a}} net bowler for touring national sides, proving <b>as</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>as</b> anything the touring team had faced all tour. In November 1999 Clarke complained of feeling unwell and losing weight rapidly and saw a doctor, who could find nothing amiss. On 4 December, Clarke collapsed at his home and died suddenly of a heart attack. He was one week short of his 45th birthday and left his wife Peggy; his son Shakeem and four daughters; Sasha, Desiree, Dawn and Shelly.|$|E
25|$|The Buiston loch {{is famous}} {{as the site}} of the Dark Ages crannog (lake dwelling) {{discovered}} and excavated by Duncan McNaught. Another possibility is that the bridge was over the Garrier burn near its confluence with the Lochridge (Lochrig) Burn between Cranshaw (now Hillhead) Farm and Wheatrig Farm. Some Ordnance Survey maps confuse the Brakenburn, which is near Kilmaurs, with the Garrier. A bridge would be a significant feature in the 17th century, when a ford was the usual way in which rivers were crossed, <b>as</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>as</b> this was. See the note on Maid Morville's Mound commemorating the drowning of a De Morville daughter at a ford on the river Irvine near Dreghorn.|$|E

500|$|Hitler's regime persecuted homosexuals, {{sending an}} {{estimated}} 5,000 to 15,000 to concentration camps; some 2,500 to 7,500 of these died. After the Night of the Long Knives (1934), Hitler described the homosexuality of Ernst Röhm and other SA leaders as corrupt and immoral. In August 1941, Hitler declared that [...] "homosexuality is actually as infectious and <b>as</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>as</b> the plague", and supported Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler's efforts to remove gay {{men from the}} military and the SS. Male homosexuality was illegal, and offenders were sent to prison or directly to concentration camps.|$|E
500|$|After the United Kingdom general election, 1895, Rosebery and Fowler were {{replaced}} by Lord Salisbury and Lord George Hamilton respectively. Hamilton thought Karim was not <b>as</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>as</b> some supposed {{but that he was}} [...] "a stupid man, and on that account he may become a tool in the hands of other men." [...] In early 1896, Karim returned to India on six months' leave, and Hamilton and Elgin placed him under [...] "unobtrusive" [...] surveillance. They dared not be too obvious lest the Munshi notice and complain to the Queen. Despite fears that Karim might meet with hostile agents, his visit home appears to have been uneventful.|$|E
500|$|As {{its name}} implies, the sickener is inedible, though not <b>as</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>as</b> {{sometimes}} described in older mushroom guides. [...] The symptoms are mainly gastrointestinal in nature: nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, and colicky abdominal cramps. These symptoms typically begin {{half an hour}} to three hours after ingestion of the mushroom, and usually subside spontaneously, or shortly after the ingested material has been expelled from the intestinal tract. The active agents have not been identified but are thought to be sesquiterpenes, which have been isolated from the related genus Lactarius and from Russula sardonia. Sesquiterpenoids that have been identified from R.emetica include the previously known compounds lactarorufinA, furandiol, methoxyfuranalcohol, and an unnamed compound unique to this species.|$|E

[...] After the series was picked up, the apartment and the building's courtyard were re-created on a Warner Bros. soundstage.

You can see little coffins on their eyelids, leaving only one question: how will the fiend get whacked?" [...] Stone said that [...] "Todd was this close to being offed, but Howarth made that choice laughable. Rampaging through fictional Llanview, he injected ambiguity into the bluntest dialogue, his sneers averting cynicism to reveal depression and humor" [...] and [...] "transformed Todd into a soul-wrenched Lucifer, his rage ripped from abuse and bathed in vengeful glee, his sexiness rising off his instinct for survival and his outlaw impulse to disrupt." [...] She added, [...] "Even the ragged scar he acquired on one cheek only heightened his animal appeal. No soap would jettison such gold and electricity—a figure simultaneously furious, ironic, melancholy, and horny." ...|$|E
500|$|British singer, Rita Ora, plays Drake's distant love {{interest}} in the video. It begins with Drake dressed sitting in a room on a bed, reflecting on his new life. Several images including explosions and cityscapes are shown on him and on the wall before the performance begins. Drake is later shown throughout the video {{in front of a}} gray backdrop, as he seems to be thinking about two women in his visions, Ora, who seems to portray the good girl, and another woman, who remained yet to be seen fully, portrayed <b>as</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>as</b> she dances provocatively in the background. Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly called the video [...] "artistically contradictory", however said that the scenes of Drake sitting [...] "alone in his bedroom as flashing images of busy streets and crowds of strangers float around him, pensive and rebellious", and called them [...] "controlled chaos", but said that it worked in the video. Wete also pointed out that [...] "He chose not to go the cliche rap-video route and fill his four-minute flick with nearly naked women, Ciroc bottles, and Beamers", and that he stuck with [...] "one leading lady".|$|E
