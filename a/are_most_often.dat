5|$|Natural {{enemies of}} insect pests, {{also known as}} {{biological}} control agents, include predators, parasitoids, pathogens, and competitors. Biological control agents of plant diseases <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> referred to as antagonists. Biological control agents of weeds include seed predators, herbivores and plant pathogens.|$|E
5|$|Opposable thumbs {{allowing}} the grasping of objects <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> associated with primates, like humans, monkeys, apes, and lemurs.

5|$|A {{hybrid system}} {{combines}} (C)PV and CSP {{with one another}} or with other forms of generation such as diesel, wind and biogas. The combined form of generation may enable the system to modulate power output {{as a function of}} demand or at least reduce the fluctuating nature of solar power and the consumption of non renewable fuel. Hybrid systems <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> found on islands.|$|E
5|$|Air {{rises and}} rotates around a {{vertical}} axis, {{usually in the}} same direction as low-pressure systems in both northern and southern hemisphere. They <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> cyclonic, that is, associated with a localized low-pressure region within a supercell. Such storms can feature strong surface winds and severe hail. Mesocyclones often occur together with updrafts in supercells, where tornadoes may form. About 1700 mesocyclones form annually across the United States, but only half produce tornadoes.|$|E

5|$|As a {{saprobic}} mushroom, or decomposer {{of organic}} material, Ravenel's stinkhorn {{can be found}} in almost any habitat that includes decaying wood. They <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> found growing in groups, though occasionally singly, on wood chips, rotten tree stumps or sawdust. They are common in urban flowerbeds, parks and lawns, as well as in meadows, cultivated areas and woods. The foul odor of the gleba attracts insects that walk and feed on the spore-bearing surface, and later disseminate the sticky spores to other locales.|$|E
5|$|Being a key {{animal in}} the history of farming, sheep have a deeply entrenched place in human culture, and find {{representation}} in much modern language and symbology. As livestock, sheep <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> associated with pastoral, Arcadian imagery. Sheep figure in many mythologies—such as the Golden Fleece—and major religions, especially the Abrahamic traditions. In both ancient and modern religious ritual, sheep are used as sacrificial animals.|$|E
5|$|Brooding species <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> ahermatypic (not reef-building) {{in areas}} of high current or wave action. Brooders release only sperm, which is {{negatively}} buoyant, sinking on to the waiting egg carriers who harbor unfertilized eggs for weeks. Synchronous spawning events sometimes occurs even with these species. After fertilization, the corals release planula that are ready to settle.|$|E

5|$|Climate in {{a narrow}} sense is usually defined as the “average weather”, or more rigorously, as the {{statistical}} description {{in terms of the}} mean and variability of relevant quantities {{over a period of time}} ranging from months to thousands or millions of years. The classical period is 30 years, as defined by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). These quantities <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> surface variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical description, of the climate system.|$|E
5|$|In many East Asian cultures, salt is not {{traditionally}} {{used as a}} condiment. In its place, condiments such as soy sauce, {{fish sauce}} and oyster sauce {{tend to have a}} high sodium content and fill a similar role to table salt in western cultures. They <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> used for cooking rather than as table condiments.|$|E
5|$|Mast cells {{reside in}} {{connective}} tissues and mucous membranes, and regulate the inflammatory response. They <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> associated with allergy and anaphylaxis. Basophils and eosinophils {{are related to}} neutrophils. They secrete chemical mediators {{that are involved in}} defending against parasites and play a role in allergic reactions, such as asthma. Natural killer (NK cells) cells are leukocytes that attack and destroy tumor cells, or cells that have been infected by viruses.|$|E

5|$|Metal {{artefacts}} {{share the}} same geometric designs {{that are used in}} other forms of Islamic art. However, in the view of Hamilton Gibb, the emphasis differs: geometric patterns tend to be used for borders, and if they are in the main decorative area they <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> used in combination with other motifs such as floral designs, arabesques, animal motifs, or calligraphic script. Geometric designs in Islamic metalwork can form a grid decorated with these other motifs, or they can form the background pattern.|$|E
5|$|Mucinous carcinomas are a rare form of endometrial cancer, {{making up}} less than 1–2% of all {{diagnosed}} endometrial cancer. Mucinous endometrial carcinomas <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> stage I and grade I, giving them a good prognosis. They typically have well-differentiated columnar cells organized into glands with the characteristic mucin in the cytoplasm. Mucinous carcinomas must be differentiated from cervical adenocarcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Narrative {{tales and}} stories <b>are</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> found on papyri, but partial and {{sometimes}} complete texts are found on ostraca.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project was to examine representations of male characters and masculinity in Disney animated feature films. Social learning theory, gender and hegemonic masculinity were used to theoretically frame this study. Twenty-two movies were examined; a total of ninety-one characters {{were included in the}} analysis. The movies included in the sample were produced between 1930 and 2007. This study sought to examine the dimensions of character descriptions, physical descriptions, socioeconomic status, sexuality, family structures and practices, and aggression as well as to understand how constructions of masculinity in Disney films changed over time. The {{results of the present study}} regarding character role indicate that good characters <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> middle aged, slender and fit but not muscular, single, royalty, and had community as family. They <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> heterosexual, equally likely to be romantically involved as to be not romantically involved, were sexual in nature, and <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> the victims of physical aggression. Evil characters <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> middle aged, slender and fit but not muscular, single, royalty, had community as family, and were well dressed. Evil characters <b>were</b> <b>most</b> likely to trap other characters and to steal. Neutral characters <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> old/elderly, overweight and not muscular, and <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> employed as inventors, royalty, and diamond miners. They <b>were</b> also <b>most</b> <b>often</b> single and to have community as family. The results regarding character centrality indicated that central characters <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> white, slender and fit but not muscular, single, middle aged, showed physical strength, and were well dressed compared to peripheral characters. Central characters were heterosexual, romantically involved, sexual in nature, engaged in hand to hand fighting, and engaged in social isolation and name calling. Peripheral characters <b>were</b> <b>most</b> <b>often</b> white, slender and fit but not muscular, single, and also more likely than central characters to be old/elderly. For the analysis of masculinity across time, it was found that the types of masculinity shown in Disney films did not match with hegemonic masculinity historically. Overall, the most common theme of masculinity that was observed throughout all decades was the fatherhood movement...|$|R
