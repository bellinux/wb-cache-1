5|$|However, Heghnar Zeitlian Watenpaugh has presumed Sha'arawi's {{description}} to {{be partly}} <b>apocryphal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Arrian and Plutarch {{claimed that}} Alexander was {{speechless}} by this point, implying {{that this was}} an <b>apocryphal</b> story. Diodorus, Curtius and Justin offered the more plausible story that Alexander passed his signet ring to Perdiccas, a bodyguard and leader of the companion cavalry, in front of witnesses, thereby nominating him.|$|E
5|$|A famous story, {{possibly}} <b>apocryphal,</b> {{states that}} during the Battle of Princeton, when Alexander Hamilton, then the commander of an artillery battery, ordered his cannons to fire upon the British soldiers taking refuge in Nassau Hall, one of the cannonballs was shot through {{the head of the}} portrait of King George II that hung in the chapel, which was subsequently replaced with a portrait of George Washington.|$|E
5|$|According to John of Wallingford, King Edgar {{made this}} {{division}} during a council at York, {{in order to}} prevent the whole area becoming the inheritance of one man. The Historia Regum claims that such a division took place not in Oslac's time but Osulf's, and that the division line was the River Tyne rather than Tees; historian Dorothy Whitelock considered this to be <b>apocryphal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Herodotus' {{colorful}} {{account of}} the battle has provided history with many <b>apocryphal</b> incidents and conversations away from the main historical events. These accounts are obviously not verifiable, but they form {{an integral part of}} the legend of the battle and often demonstrate the laconic speech (and wit) of the Spartans to good effect.|$|E
5|$|Some early Christian {{groups had}} {{separate}} {{descriptions of the}} life and teachings of Jesus that {{are not included in}} the New Testament. These include the Gospels of Thomas, Peter, and Judas, the Apocryphon of James, and many other <b>apocryphal</b> writings. Most scholars conclude that these are written much later and are less reliable accounts than the canonical gospels.|$|E
5|$|Somewhat <b>apocryphal</b> stories tell of Augustus {{pleading}} with Tiberius to stay, even {{going so far}} as to stage a serious illness. Tiberius's response was to anchor off the shore of Ostia until word came that Augustus had survived, then sailing straightway for Rhodes. Tiberius reportedly regretted his departure and requested to return to Rome several times, but each time Augustus refused his requests.|$|E
5|$|The {{cross is}} thought to date from the tenth century, and {{exhibits}} distinctive Hiberno-Scottish mission influences, in common with several other monuments in the area. Tradition and folk etymology suggest that the cross marked the burial site of Camus, leader of the Norse army purportedly defeated by King Malcolm II at the <b>apocryphal</b> Battle of Barry. The name of the stone is likely to derive from the extinct village of Camuston, which has a Celtic toponymy.|$|E
5|$|Cordelia Chase is {{a fictional}} {{character}} created by Joss Whedon for the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer; she also appeared on Buffy's spin-off series, Angel. Portrayed by Charisma Carpenter, the character {{appears as a}} series regular {{in the first three}} seasons of Buffy, before exiting the show and becoming a series regular during the first four seasons of Angel. The character made her last television appearance in 2004, appearing as a special guest star in Angels one hundredth episode. Cordelia also appears in both canonical and <b>apocryphal</b> Buffy and Angel material such as comic books and novels.|$|E
5|$|Early Mormons {{understood}} the Book of Mormon to be a religious {{history of the}} indigenous peoples of the Americas. Smith's followers {{view it as a}} companion to the Bible and an additional witness of Christ, akin to a large <b>apocryphal</b> work. Modern historian Fawn Brodie has called the Book of Mormon a response to pressing cultural and environmental issues of Smith's times, saying that Smith composed the Book of Mormon drawing from scraps of information available to him. Dan Vogel, another historian, says that the work is autobiographical in nature.|$|E
5|$|Folk {{tales and}} myths {{sometimes}} contain mythological hybrids; the Minotaur was {{the offspring of}} a human, Pasiphaë, and a white bull. More often, they are composites of the physical attributes {{of two or more}} kinds of animals, mythical beasts, and humans, with no suggestion that they are the result of interbreeding, as in the centaur (man/horse), chimera (goat/lion/snake), hippocamp (fish/horse), and sphinx (woman/lion). The Old Testament mentions a first generation of half-human hybrid giants, the Nephilim, while the <b>apocryphal</b> Book of Enoch describes the Nephilim as the wicked sons of fallen angels and attractive women.|$|E
5|$|In 1760, {{one year}} after Voltaire {{published}} Candide, a sequel was published with the name Candide, ou l'optimisme, seconde partie. This work is attributed both to Thorel de Campigneulles, a writer unknown today, and Henri Joseph Du Laurens, who is suspected of having habitually plagiarised Voltaire. The story continues in this sequel with Candide having new adventures in the Ottoman Empire, Persia, and Denmark. Part II has potential use in studies of the popular and literary receptions of Candide, but is almost certainly <b>apocryphal.</b> In total, by the year 1803, at least ten imitations of Candide or continuations of its story were published by authors other than Voltaire.|$|E
5|$|Knight {{doubts that}} Clarence13X {{set out to}} build a {{movement}} or a culture, but after his death, the movement expanded and gained converts across the United States. Five Percenters have celebrated Clarence13X's birthday as a holiday, and minimized the descriptions of his flaws in their accounts of his life. Numerous <b>apocryphal</b> stories from his life have circulated among the group; some accounts have claimed that he gambled only {{as a means to}} reach others with his teachings. He did not leave behind a record of his teachings, and the group had few formalized tenets {{at the time of his}} death. In the following decades, the group's doctrine became more complicated.|$|E
5|$|Many prelates lived {{around the}} street during the Middle Ages, {{including}} the Bishops of Salisbury and St Davids and the Abbots of Faversham, Tewkesbury, Winchcombe and Cirencester. Tanning of animal hides became established on Fleet Street {{owing to the}} nearby river, though this increased pollution leading to a ban on dumping rubbish by the mid-14th century. Many taverns and brothels were established along Fleet Street and have been documented {{as early as the}} 14th century. Records show that Geoffrey Chaucer was fined two shillings for attacking a friar in Fleet Street, though modern historians believe this is <b>apocryphal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Max Guevara (X5-452) is {{a fictional}} {{character}} and the protagonist of the cyberpunk science fiction television program Dark Angel. During both seasons of the series Max was portrayed by Jessica Alba and by Geneva Locke during childhood flashbacks. Over one thousand actresses were considered for the part of Max before Alba was given the role. Max also appears in three canonical novels based on the series {{as well as an}} <b>apocryphal</b> video game adaptation. Created by James Cameron and Charles H. Eglee, Max followed a long line of strong female characters created by Cameron, including Sarah Connor and Ellen Ripley.|$|E
5|$|According to Ibn Kathir, Uzair lived {{between the}} times of King Solomon {{and the time of}} Zachariah, father of John the Baptist. Some Quranic {{commentators}} viewed Uzayr as a learned scholar who sought to teach the people the forgotten laws of God. He is sometimes identified as the protagonist in the Quranic story of the man who slept for a hundred years (2:259). Some Islamic scholars held Uzayr {{to be one of the}} prophets. However, Islamic tradition also reports that God expunged Uzayr from the list of prophets because he refused to believe in qadar (predestination). Ibn Hazm, al-Samaw'al and other scholars put forth the view that Uzair (or one of his disciples) falsified the Torah, and this claim became a common theme in Islamic polemics against the Bible. Many aspects of later Islamic narratives show similarity to Vision of Ezra, an <b>apocryphal</b> text which seems to have been partially known to Muslim readers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Apocryphal</b> and semi-legendary anecdotal stories {{surround}} {{the creation of}} Levski's Internal Revolutionary Organisation. Persecuted by the Ottoman authorities who offered 500 Turkish liras for his death and 1000 for his capture, Levski resorted to disguises to evade arrest during his travels. For example, he {{is known to have}} dyed his hair and to have worn a variety of national costumes. In the autumn of 1871, Levski and Angel Kanchev published the Instruction of the Workers for the Liberation of the Bulgarian People, a BRCC draft statute containing ideological, organisational and penal sections. It was sent out to the local committees and to the diasporic community for discussion. The political and organisational experience that Levski amassed is evident in his correspondence dating from 1871 to 1872; at the time, his views on the revolution had clearly matured.|$|E
5|$|Both Orkney and Shetland saw a {{significant}} influx of Norwegian settlers {{during the late}} 8th and early 9th centuries. Vikings made the islands the headquarters of their pirate expeditions carried out against Norway and the coasts of mainland Scotland. In response, Norwegian king Harald Fairhair (Harald Hårfagre) annexed the Northern Isles, comprising Orkney and Shetland, in 875. (It is clear that this story, which appears in the Orkneyinga Saga, {{is based on the}} later voyages of Magnus Barelegs and some scholars believe it to be <b>apocryphal.)</b> Rognvald Eysteinsson received Orkney and Shetland from Harald as an earldom as reparation for the death of his son in battle in Scotland, and then passed the earldom on to his brother Sigurd the Mighty.|$|E
5|$|By mid-July Wiesenthal {{and other}} Jewish {{residents}} had to register to do forced labour. Within six months, in November 1941 the Nazis {{had set up}} the Lwów Ghetto using Jewish forced labour. All Jews {{had to give up}} their homes and move there, a process completed in the following months. Several thousand Jews were murdered in Lvov by Ukrainian nationals and German Einsatzgruppen in June and July 1941. In his autobiographies, Wiesenthal tells how he was arrested on 6 July, but saved from execution by his former foreman, a man named Bodnar, who was now a member of the Ukrainian Auxiliary Police. There are several versions of the story, which may be <b>apocryphal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Formby {{began to}} develop his own stage act during the 1890s, and built a large fan base in Lancashire. He devised several {{characters}} with their own costumes, and composed a series of comic songs. By 1896 his assignment book records that he was buying and collecting comic songs and securing the singing rights. He was billed as J.H. Booth until 1897, when he changed his stage name to George Formby. Although rumoured to have picked his new surname after seeing it as a destination on a railway carriage, the main sources agree this story {{is likely to be}} <b>apocryphal.</b> The origin of the Formby name is {{more likely to have been}} a suggestion from Dennis Clarke, the manager of the Argyle Theatre in Birkenhead, while George was chosen in honour of the music hall star George Robey. Formby first used his new stage name in Birkenhead in 1897.|$|E
5|$|Harrison Clark left South Africa in 1887, but it {{is unclear}} why; {{according}} to a story that may be <b>apocryphal,</b> he fled the country as an outlaw soon after his revolver fired—by accident, so the story goes—and killed a man. Whatever the truth, he travelled to Mozambique, then a Portuguese territory, where {{he made his way}} upriver along the Zambezi until he reached Feira, a long-abandoned Portuguese settlement at the confluence of the Zambezi and Luangwa Rivers, in what is today southern Zambia. Feira was founded by missionaries from Portugal in about 1720, but by 1887 it was a ghost town. Its last inhabitants had fled amid a native rising about half a century before, and since then it had been deserted.|$|E
5|$|In October 1843, future California {{governor}} Peter H. Burnett recounted a {{story of}} an aboriginal American man who badly burned his foot and leg in lava or hot ash while hunting for deer. The likely <b>apocryphal</b> story went that the injured man sought treatment at Fort Vancouver, but the contemporary fort commissary steward, Napoleon McGilvery, disclaimed knowledge of the incident. British lieutenant Henry J. Warre sketched the eruption in 1845, {{and two years later}} Canadian painter Paul Kane created watercolors of the gently smoking mountain. Warre's work showed erupting material from a vent {{about a third of the}} way down from the summit on the mountain's west or northwest side (possibly at Goat Rocks), and one of Kane's field sketches shows smoke emanating from about the same location.|$|E
5|$|In the Augustan History, Zenobia {{is said to}} {{have been}} a {{descendant}} of Cleopatra and claimed descent from the Ptolemies. According to the Souda, a 10th-century Byzantine encyclopedia, after the Palmyrene conquest of Egypt, the Greek sophist Callinicus of Petra wrote a ten-volume history of Alexandria dedicated to Cleopatra. According to modern scholars, by Cleopatra Callinicus meant Zenobia. Apart from legend, there is no evidence in Egyptian coinage or papyri of a contemporary conflation of Zenobia with Cleopatra; it may have been invented by Zenobia's enemies to discredit her. Zenobia's alleged claim of a connection to Cleopatra seems to have been politically motivated, since it would have given her a connection with Egypt and made her a legitimate successor to the Ptolemies' throne. A relationship between Zenobia and the Ptolemies is unlikely, and attempts by classical sources to trace the queen's ancestry to the Ptolemies through the Seleucids are <b>apocryphal.</b>|$|E
5|$|Legend {{from the}} <b>apocryphal</b> Gospel of Thomas and other ancient {{documents}} suggests that Saint Thomas the Apostle preached in Bactria, which is today northern Afghanistan. The Nestorians planted Christianity in the area, {{and there have}} been nine bishops and dioceses in the region, including Herat (424-1310), Farah (544-1057), Kandahar, and Balkh. This early establishment of Christianity was overcome by Muslim invasions in the 7th century, though the territory was not substantially controlled by Muslims until the 9th and 10th centuries. In 1581 and 1582 respectively, the Jesuits Montesserat of Spain and Bento de Góis of Portugal were warmly welcomed by the Islamic Emperor Akbar, but there was no lasting Jesuit presence in the country.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the painted}} {{production}} of Verrocchio's workshop {{was done by}} his employees. According to Vasari, Leonardo collaborated with Verrocchio on his The Baptism of Christ, painting the young angel holding Jesus' robe {{in a manner that}} was so far superior to his master's that Verrocchio put down his brush and never painted again, although this is believed to be <b>apocryphal.</b> Close examination reveals areas that have been painted or touched-up over the tempera using the new technique of oil paint; the landscape, the rocks seen through the brown mountain stream and much of the figure of Jesus bearing witness to the hand of Leonardo. Leonardo may have been the model for two works by Verrocchio: the bronze statue of David in the Bargello and the Archangel Raphael in Tobias and the Angel.|$|E
5|$|The Gospel of the Hebrews is {{preserved}} in fragments quoted or summarized by various early Church Fathers. The {{full extent of}} the original gospel is unknown; according to a list of canonical and <b>apocryphal</b> works drawn up in the 9th century known as the Stichometry of Nicephorus, the gospel was 2200 lines, just 300 lines shorter than Matthew. Based on the surviving fragments, the overall structure of the gospel appears to have been similar to the canonical ones. It consisted of a narrative of the life of Jesus which included his baptism, temptation, transfiguration, last supper, crucifixion, and resurrection. The gospel also contained sayings of Jesus. The events in the life of Jesus have been interpreted in a way that reflects Jewish ideas present in a Hellenistic cultural environment.|$|E
5|$|The {{portion of}} the codex held by the British Library {{consists}} of 346½ folios, 694 pages (38.1cm x 34.5cm), constituting {{over half of the}} original work. Of these folios, 199 belong to the Old Testament, including the apocrypha (deuterocanonical), and 147½ belong to the New Testament, along with two other books, the Epistle of Barnabas and part of The Shepherd of Hermas. The <b>apocryphal</b> books present in the surviving part of the Septuagint are 2 Esdras, Tobit, Judith, 1 and 4 Maccabees, Wisdom, and Sirach. The books of the New Testament are arranged in this order: the four Gospels, the epistles of Paul (Hebrews follows 2 Thess.), the Acts of the Apostles, the General Epistles, and the Book of Revelation. The fact that some parts of the codex are preserved in good condition while others are in very poor condition implies they were separated and stored in several places.|$|E
5|$|The {{ruins of}} three Byzantine-era churches {{are located in}} Bayt Jibrin. A church on a {{northern}} hill of the town, later used as a private residence, had elaborate mosaics depicting the four seasons which were defaced in the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. A church south of the town, known as Khirbet Sandahanna, was dedicated to Saint Anne. The New Testament does not give any information about {{the mother of the}} Virgin Mary, but the widely circulated <b>apocryphal</b> Gospel of James gives her name as Anne, and her birthplace as Bethlehem. In another Christian tradition though, Bayt Jibrin is the birthplace of Saint Anne. The initial Byzantine church was rebuilt by Crusaders in the 12th century. Today, the apse with its three arched windows and half-dome ceiling are still intact.|$|E
5|$|There {{are fewer}} records of {{elephants}} {{being used as}} straightforward executioners for the civil population. One such example is mentioned by Josephus and the deuterocanonical book of 3 Maccabees {{in connection with the}} Egyptian Jews, though the story is likely <b>apocryphal.</b> 3 Maccabees describes an attempt by Ptolemy IV Philopator (ruled 221–204 BC) to enslave and brand Egypt's Jews with the symbol of Dionysus. When the majority of the Jews resisted, the king is said to have rounded them up and ordered them to be trampled on by elephants. The mass execution was ultimately thwarted, supposedly by the intervention of angels, following which Ptolemy took an altogether more forgiving attitude towards his Jewish subjects.|$|E
5|$|While {{scholars}} {{have proposed a}} number of hypotheses {{to explain why the}} poem was written, a definitive answer to this question remains elusive. But regardless of Proba's intent, there is evidence that the poem was widely circulated, and it eventually was used in schools to teach the tenets of Christianity, alongside Augustine of Hippo's De Doctrina Christiana. Critical reception to the poem, however, was more mixed. A pseudonymous work purportedly by Pope Gelasius I disparaged the poem, deeming it <b>apocryphal.</b> Many also believe that St. Jerome disliked the poem. At the same time, others like Isidore of Seville, Petrarch, and Giovanni Boccaccio wrote highly of Proba. During the 19th and 20th centuries the poem was criticized as being of poor quality, but recent {{scholars have}} written more positively about it.|$|E
5|$|After this, Baker {{appeared}} in the independent British-German film Station Six-Sahara (1962) {{as a woman who}} provokes tensions at an oil station in the Sahara Desert, as well as the blockbuster Western epic How the West Was Won (1962), opposite Debbie Reynolds and former co-stars Gregory Peck and Karl Malden. In addition to film acting, Baker also found time to appear again on Broadway, starring in the 1962 production of Garson Kanin's Come on Strong in the fall of that year. In 1963, Baker relocated permanently with then-husband Jack Garfein and their two children to Los Angeles, where she based herself for the next several years. She traveled to Kenya to film Mister Moses (1965), where publicized rumors spread that she and co-star Robert Mitchum were having an affair, which they both vehemently denied. Another story, now considered <b>apocryphal,</b> had it that a Maasai chief in Kenya offered 150 cows, 200 goats, sheep, and $750 for her hand in marriage. She subsequently appeared with Maasai warriors on the cover of Lifes July 1964 issue.|$|E
5|$|Louis Antoine de Saint-Just {{was born}} at Decize in the former Nivernais {{province}} of central France. He was the eldest child of Louis Jean de Saint-Just de Richebourg (1716–1777), a retired French cavalry officer, knight of the Order of Saint Louis, and of the 20-years younger Marie-Anne Robinot (1736–1811), {{the daughter of a}} notary. He had two younger sisters, born in 1768 and 1769. The family later moved north and in 1776 settled in the village of Blérancourt in the former Picardy province, establishing themselves as a countryside noble family living out of the rents from their land. A year after the move, Louis Antoine's father died leaving his mother with the three children. She saved diligently for her only son's education, and in 1779 he was sent to the Oratorian school at Soissons. After a promising start, Saint-Just acquired a reputation as a troublemaker, augmented by infamous stories (almost certainly <b>apocryphal)</b> of how he led a students' rebellion and tried to burn down the school. Nonetheless, he earned his graduation in 1786.|$|E
5|$|On {{the right}} side of the altar are two retablos. The larger altar on {{the right side}} {{currently}} houses the image of St. Francis Xavier as preacher on the topmost level. On the middle level of the same retablo are images of Saint Vincent Ferrer in the center, and Saint Augustine and Saint Monica on the left and right niches, respectively. The lowest level contains images of the Nuestra Señora de la Consolacion in the center, Saint Anne to the right and Saint Thérèse of Lisieux (originally St Joachim) on the left. The smaller altar has two levels of baroque and neoclassical style, respectively, with images of the crucified Christ on the lower level and the Holy Infant on the upper. The tomb of Father Aquilino Bon and other Recollect priests who served Loboc are also on this side of the church. The remains of Jesuit priest Alonso de Humanes were formerly interred in this area before the transfer of his remains to San Ignacio in Intramuros. An <b>apocryphal</b> account tells of a fire in a former Loboc church stopping at the foot of Humanes' tomb; this story spread across the people of the Loboc and nearby towns, which drew pilgrims to light candles in memory of Humanes.|$|E
5|$|The {{most famous}} {{of the very few}} chairs which have come down from a remote antiquity is the reputed Chair of Saint Peter in St Peter's Basilica at Rome. The wooden {{portions}} are much decayed, but it would appear to be Byzantine work of the 6th century, and to be really an ancient sedia gestatoria. It has ivory carvings representing the labours of Hercules. A few pieces of an earlier oaken chair have been let in; the existing one, Gregorovius says, is of acacia wood. The legend that this was the curile chair of the senator Pudens is necessarily <b>apocryphal.</b> It is not, as is popularly supposed, enclosed in Gian Lorenzo Bernini's bronze chair, but is kept under triple lock and exhibited only once in a century. Byzantium, like Greece and Rome, affected the curule form of chair, and in addition to lions’ heads and winged figures of Victory (or Nike) and dolphin-shaped arms used also the lyre-back which has been made familiar by the pseudo-classical revival {{of the end of the}} 18th century.|$|E
5|$|The third {{important}} {{work of this}} period is the Virgin of the Rocks, commissioned in Milan for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception. The painting, {{to be done with}} the assistance of the de Predis brothers, was to fill a large complex altarpiece. Leonardo chose to paint an <b>apocryphal</b> moment of the infancy of Christ when the infant John the Baptist, in protection of an angel, met the Holy Family on the road to Egypt. The painting demonstrates an eerie beauty as the graceful figures kneel in adoration around the infant Christ in a wild landscape of tumbling rock and whirling water. While the painting is quite large, about , it is not nearly as complex as the painting ordered by the monks of St Donato, having only four figures rather than about fifty and a rocky landscape rather than architectural details. The painting was eventually finished; in fact, two versions of the painting were finished: one remained at the chapel of the Confraternity, while Leonardo took the other to France. The Brothers did not get their painting, however, nor the de Predis their payment, until the next century.|$|E
5|$|To help {{maintain}} his dominance, Edward constructed {{a series of}} great stone castles: Beaumaris, Caernarfon and Conwy. His son, the future King Edward II of England, was born at Edward's new castle at Caernarfon in 1284. He became the first English Prince of Wales, not as an infant, but in 1301. The <b>apocryphal</b> story that Edward tricked the Welsh by offering them a Welsh-born Prince who could speak no English was first recorded in 1584. The title also provided an income from the north-west part of Wales known as the Principality of Wales, until the Act of Union (1536), after which the term principality, when used, {{was associated with the}} whole of Wales. After the failed revolt in 1294–95 of Madog ap Llywelyn – who styled himself Prince of Wales in the Penmachno Document – and the rising of Llywelyn Bren (1316), the next major uprising was that led by Owain Glyndŵr, against Henry IV of England. In 1404, Owain was reputedly crowned Prince of Wales in the presence of emissaries from France, Spain and Scotland. Glyndŵr went on to hold parliamentary assemblies at several Welsh towns, including Machynlleth. But the rebellion failed, and Owain went into hiding in 1412; peace was essentially restored in Wales by 1415. Although the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 provided the constitutional basis for post-conquest government of the Principality of north Wales from 1284 until 1536, there was no formal Union until 1536. Shortly afterwards Welsh law, which had continued to be used in Wales after the Norman conquest, was fully replaced by English law, under what would become known as the Act of Union.|$|E
