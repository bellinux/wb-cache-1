5|$|Prior to its Broadway debut, preview {{performances}} of the play were staged in several cities. The first was in Pittsburgh, where it began a scheduled one-week run on September 26, 1921. It was closed early {{on the last day}} by the local Director of Public Safety, who objected to some of the dialogue. Hopwood was upset by the censorship, but Woods was happy to have free publicity from press coverage of the closure. The tryouts then moved to Stamford, Connecticut and Atlantic City, New Jersey, where they proceeded without incident. The play's Broadway opening was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Times</b> Square Theatre on October 18, 1921. It ran there for a few weeks until Woods transferred it to his own Eltinge 42nd Street Theatre on November 7.|$|E
5|$|Shelley {{began writing}} fiction late in life, {{publishing}} {{his first novel}} The Shrimp People in 1991 {{at the age of}} sixty one.

The work won the National Book Development Council of Singapore Award for works in English the following year despite being up against books by established writers such as Gopal Baratham and Suchen Christine Lim. He wrote three more books, People of the Pear Tree (1993), Island in the Centre (1995) and A River of Roses (1998), on the same theme within a decade. The first two of these won National Book Development Council Highly Commended Awards in 1994 and 1996 respectively, while the last won the Dymocks Singapore Literature Prize (now known simply as the Singapore Literature Prize) in 2000.|$|E

5|$|The Bull's Head {{hotel on}} 44th Street, which refused to provide alcohol to the mob, was burned. The mayor's {{residence}} on Fifth Avenue, the Eighth and Fifth District police stations, and other buildings were attacked and set on fire. Other targets included {{the office of}} the New York Times. The mob was turned back <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Times</b> office by staff manning Gatling guns, including Times founder Henry Jarvis Raymond. Fire engine companies responded, but some firefighters were sympathetic to the rioters because they had also been drafted on Saturday. Later in the afternoon, authorities shot and killed a man as a crowd attacked the armory at Second Avenue and 21st Street. The mob broke all the windows with paving stones ripped from the street. The mob beat, tortured and/or killed numerous black people, including one man who was attacked by a crowd of 400 with clubs and paving stones, then lynched, hanged from a tree and set alight.|$|E
5|$|The {{honor of}} {{becoming}} an altar server, was, in the past, a privilege only available to boys but has since become coed. Altar servers wear long, white, plain robes and assist the priest in his duties during the Mass. At Mt. St. Peter Church, there are four altar servers at every Mass. One is the book bearer and {{is in charge of}} bringing the Bible to the priest <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> during which the priest reads from the Bible during the Mass. The cross bearer holds a large, wooded crucifix and commences the procession in which the priest enters the church. Also present in the procession are the acolytes, and the book bearer. He or she also leads the procession out of the church {{at the end of the}} Mass. The last two altar servers are acolytes and are in charge of lighting the candles in the church prior to the beginning of the Mass and extinguishing them after Mass.|$|E
5|$|The subway {{through which}} the shuttle runs was opened on October 27, 1904 by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT), {{the first day of}} subway service in Manhattan. The current shuttle line was part of the first IRT subway line, which ran north to 145th Street via Broadway and south to City Hall via Park Avenue and Lafayette Street. The 42nd Street section of the line {{connected}} Broadway at Times Square, on the west, to Park Avenue at Grand Central Terminal, on the east. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>Times</b> Square end of this segment, the line curved sharply to the north under One Times Square, swinging northeast under Seventh Avenue before shifting under Broadway. The platforms at Times Square are located on this curve. In 1910, the platforms at the two stations were extended.|$|E

5|$|Tracks 1 and 3 are {{connected}} {{to each other and}} to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line's southbound local track south of Grand Central station. Track 4 connects to the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line's northbound local track north of Times Square station. There is no connection between the two tracks that connect to the Lexington Avenue Line, Tracks 1 and 3, and the track that connects to the Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line, Track 4; therefore, it is now physically impossible for a train to go from the IRT Lexington Avenue Line through to the IRT Seventh Avenue Line or vice versa by using the shuttle tracks. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>Times</b> Square station, to provide a connection between the platform for Track 4 and the rest of the station complex, there is a pedestrian bridge over Track 4. The pedestrian bridge is temporary removed to allow the train on Track 4 to leave for maintenance.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, a joint {{study by}} Manhattan College and the New York State Water Resources Institute found {{high levels of}} human fecal {{bacteria}} in the water, likely due to municipal wastewater. All 12 sites exceeded the state maximum of a monthly median of 200 organisms per 100 milliliters (ml) over five months. Levels were, as {{with most of the}} river's other pollutants, generally the highest near the mouth. However, the uppermost sampling site in the study, at the Chappaqua Metro-North station recorded the greatest single reading of any site, 1.2 × 10 organisms per 100 ml, as well as the second-highest; the researchers speculated that this was due to sewer overflow in the area <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>times</b> of those readings. Most of the high coliform readings came after rainfall except at the two sites furthest downstream; the study theorized that some older buildings in this area of Yonkers may still discharge sewage directly to the river. Since most of the Saw Mill River flows under the shade of a forest canopy, the bacteria may be less likely to be inactivated by sunlight than in other streams.|$|E
