5|$|In 1972, Joseph Brady of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory studied {{irregularities}} in {{the motion of}} Halley's Comet. Brady claimed {{that they could have}} been caused by a Jupiter-sized planet beyond Neptune at 59 AU that is in a retrograde orbit around the Sun. However, both Marsden and PlanetX proponent P. Kenneth Seidelmann attacked the hypothesis, showing that Halley's Comet randomly and irregularly ejects jets of material, causing changes to its own orbital trajectory, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> a massive object as Brady's PlanetX would have severely affected the orbits of known outer planets.|$|E
5|$|The {{overarching}} methodological {{principle of}} positivism is to conduct sociology in broadly {{the same manner}} as natural science. An emphasis on empiricism and the scientific method is sought to provide a tested foundation for sociological research {{based on the assumption that}} the only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> knowledge can only arrive by positive affirmation through scientific methodology.|$|E
5|$|The {{suggestion}} that the entire amount of the purchase money was not paid, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> fact is {{in the way of}} supporting the claim to the Indian title, is not sustained. We are not called upon to consider the effect of default in payment of any portion of the purchase money. The treaty recites the payment of it, and as no such question seems ever before to have been raised, or full payment questioned, either by government or the Indians, it must at this late day be assumed, until the contrary is quite clearly made to appear, that the contract in that respect was performed.|$|E

5|$|Raj appealed {{before the}} court against the gag order imposed on him, stating {{that he had to}} move around {{different}} places in Maharashtra for propounding the philosophy of his party <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> an order was an infringement of his 'fundamental rights'. On 22 February, the court dismissed his appeal to re-track the extension of the gag order passed against him, following which MNS started a signature campaign to get support against the gag order. According to MNS, Maharashtrian actors Nana Patekar and Shreyas Talpade had shown support in opposing the gag order, along with actors Salman Khan and Suneil Shetty. Salman Khan and Suneil Shetty, however, later denied the MNS's claim. This move by MNS prompted the police to serve a show cause notice to Raj, asking him why the gag order should not be extended.|$|E
5|$|The British War Office's stated {{policy in}} October 1916 was to {{maintain}} offensive operations on the Western Front, while {{remaining on the}} defensive everywhere else. However, the battle of attrition on the Somme, coupled with a change of Britain's prime minister, with David Lloyd George succeeding H. H. Asquith on 7 December, destabilised the status quo sufficiently {{to bring about a}} policy reversal, making attacks on the Central Powers' weak points away from the Western Front desirable. The commander of the EEF, General Sir Archibald Murray, was encouraged to seek success on his eastern frontier, but without any reinforcements. He thought that an advance to El Arish was possible, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> an advance would threaten forces in the southern Ottoman Empire and, if not prevent, at least slow the transfer of German and Ottoman units to other theatres of war from the Levant.|$|E
5|$|Writing in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Michael Tooley {{rejected}} the Irenaean theodicy as unsatisfactory. He {{argued that the}} magnitude of suffering experienced by some people is excessive, supporting Eleanor Stump's view that the suffering endured by those with terminal illnesses cannot be for moral development, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>such</b> illnesses do not fall more often upon those seemingly immoral or in need of development. He also challenged the suffering both of animals and of young children. Neither of these instances of suffering serve any useful purpose, as they cannot lead to moral development. Finally, he questioned whether the current universe is the best possible world for the moral development of humans. Citing the examples of those who die young and those who experience too great a pain to learn from it, {{as well as people}} who suffer too little to learn anything, he suggested that this world is not ideally suited to human development.|$|E
