The collected data, and other accumulated evidence, finally substantiated the identification of the Commodore beyond <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt.</b>|$|E
5|$|If a {{defendant}} is convicted, the usual remedy for {{a violation of}} one of these provisions is reversal of the conviction or modification of the defendant's sentence. With the exception of structural errors (such as the total denial of counsel), constitutional errors are subject to harmless error analysis, although they must be harmless beyond <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt.</b> With the exception of a Double Jeopardy or Speedy Trial violation, the government will usually be permitted to retry the defendant. Pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), these provisions are the source of nearly all reviewable errors in federal habeas review of state convictions.|$|E

25|$|United States v. Booker, , is a United States Supreme Court {{decision}} concerning criminal sentencing. The Court {{ruled that}} the Sixth Amendment right to jury trial requires that, other than a prior conviction, only facts admitted by a defendant or proved beyond <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt</b> to a jury {{may be used to}} calculate a sentence exceeding the prescribed statutory maximum sentence, whether the defendant has pleaded guilty or been convicted at trial. The maximum sentence a judge may impose is a sentence based upon the facts admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt.</b>|$|E

5000|$|On August 19, 2008, Robert Mugabe {{announced}} {{his intention to}} open Parliament in the subsequent week, {{five months after the}} parliamentary election was held. Due to the ongoing negotiations, the MDC-T deemed this move to convene Parliament unacceptable, with MDC-T Secretary-General Biti stating that it would [...] "be a clear repudiation of the Memorandum of Understanding, and <b>an</b> indication beyond <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt</b> of ZANU-PF's unwillingness to continue {{to be part of the}} talks. In short convening parliament decapitates the dialogue".|$|R
40|$|The Scientific Method is {{the series}} of {{processes}} by which hypotheses, ideas and theories are shown to be true beyond <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> scientific <b>doubt.</b> Most science ‘fact’ is {{expressed in terms of}} probabilities rather than certainties. Thus, by means of statistical calculations, researchers aim to determine whether an observed association between two events or characteristics may have occurred by chance (coincidence), whether they frequently occur together (correlation) or whether they occur together because one causes the other (causative relationship). In this article we review the Scientific Method and consider the statistical tests that are applied. We then focus on the occasions when science changes its mind and review eight such occurrences...|$|R
25|$|Burden of production: P has to {{show some}} {{evidence}} that D had committed murder. The United States Supreme Court has ruled that the Constitution requires enough evidence to justify a rational trier of fact to find guilt beyond <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt.</b> If the judge rules that such burden has been met, then {{it is up to}} the jury itself to decide if they are, in fact, convinced of guilty beyond <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt.</b> If the judge finds there is not enough evidence under the standard, the case must be dismissed (or a subsequent guilty verdict must be vacated and the charges dismissed).|$|E

50|$|The play {{concerns}} the deliberations {{of the jury}} of a homicide trial. At the beginning, they have a nearly unanimous decision of guilty, with a single dissenter of not guilty, who throughout the play sows <b>a</b> seed of <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt.</b> This was first made as a 1954 teleplay by Reginald Rose for the Studio One anthology television series, and was aired as a live CBS Television production on 20 September 1954. The drama was later rewritten for the stage in 1955 under the same title.|$|R
50|$|Any {{party to}} the dispute can start the process of {{appointing}} arbitrator and if the other party does not cooperate, the party can approach the office of Chief Justice for appointment of an arbitrator. There are only two grounds upon which a party can challenge the appointment of <b>an</b> arbitrator - <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt</b> in the impartiality of the arbitrator and the lack of proper qualification of the arbitrator as required by the arbitration agreement. A sole arbitrator or a panel of arbitrators so appointed constitute the Arbitration Tribunal.|$|R
25|$|If the trier of {{fact has}} no doubt as to the defendant's guilt, or if their only doubts are {{unreasonable}} doubts, then the prosecutor has proved the defendant's guilt beyond <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt</b> and the defendant should be pronounced guilty.|$|E
25|$|In Southern Union Co. v.

25|$|In {{addition}} to different subjects, rationalists sometimes vary {{the strength of}} their claims by adjusting their understanding of the warrant.

50|$|In May 1937, as {{a result}} of an {{investigation}} by Districy Attorney Thomas E. Dewey into racketeering in the garment indstury, he and David Goldberg were convicted of filing false state income and franchise tax returns for Donnie Frock, Inc for the purposed of concealing $8,000 in unreported income. Although sentenced to an indeterminate sentence, <b>a</b> writ of <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt</b> was signed by Supreme Court Justice Salvatore A.

25|$|A hadith {{is said to}} be mutawatir if it was {{reported}} by a significant, though unspecified, number of narrators at each level in the chain of narration, thus reaching the succeeding generation through multiple chains of narration leading back to its source. This provides confirmation that the hadith is authentically attributed to its source at <b>a</b> level above <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt.</b> This is due to its being beyond historical possibility that narrators could have conspired to forge a narration. In contrast, an ahaad hadith is a narration the chain of which has not reached a number sufficient to qualify as mutawatir.|$|R

25|$|On May 19, 2015, it was {{announced}} that no charges would be filed against the off-duty police officer. St. Louis Circuit Attorney Jennifer Joyce's report says the officer shot and killed Myers in self-defense after Myers fired a gun at him, and thus a criminal violation could not be proven beyond <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt</b> in the resulting death.|$|E
25|$|Kirk {{continued}} acting {{through the}} late 1950s, with appearances in The Jackie Robinson Story (1950), the 1956 Bowery Boys comedy Hot Shots and Fritz Lang’s drama Beyond <b>a</b> <b>Reasonable</b> <b>Doubt</b> (1956). He also took small roles in television shows such as Adventures of Superman, Sheriff of Cochise and U.S. Marshal, before retiring from show business in 1958.|$|E
25|$|Supporters of Irvin {{appealed to}} the {{governor}} for clemency. After reviewing the material personally, newly elected Governor LeRoy Collins in 1955 commuted Irvin's sentence to life in prison, saying {{that he did not}} believe the State established guilt beyond <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt.</b> Greenlee, who did not appeal his case, was paroled in 1962, and Irvin in 1968. Irvin died in 1970 while visiting Lake County.|$|E
60|$|If Ovid (as {{his mother}} {{actually}} ventured to hope!) broke off his engagement, {{when he heard}} the scandalous story of Carmina's birth, there was surely a chance that she, like other girls of her sensitive temperament, might feel the calamity that had fallen on her so acutely as to condemn herself to a single life. Misled, partly by the hope of relief from her own vile anxieties; partly by the heartless incapability of appreciating generous feeling in others, developed by the pursuits of her later life, Mrs. Gallilee seriously contemplated her son's future decision as <b>a</b> matter of <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt.</b>|$|R

[...] "Mr. Watson has testified to the same thing. Each has sworn that the other struck the first blow; each has sworn that the other made an unprovoked assault on him. It is an axiom of the law that the defendant should be given the benefit of the <b>doubt.</b> <b>A</b> very <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt</b> exists. Therefore, {{in the case of the}} People Versus Carter Watson the benefit of the doubt is given to said Carter Watson and he is herewith ordered discharged from custody. The same reasoning applies to the case of the People Versus Patrick Horan. He is given the benefit of the doubt and discharged from custody. My recommendation is that both defendants shake hands and make up." ...|$|R
25|$|I {{began by}} {{describing}} the horrific {{nature of these}} cruel acts of terrorism, acts which cry out for justice. Justice is not achieved, however, if persons are convicted on anything less than the requisite standard of proof beyond <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt.</b> Despite what {{appear to have been}} the best and most earnest of efforts by the police and the Crown, the evidence has fallen markedly short of that standard.|$|E
25|$|On March 17, 2010, a Tom Green County, Texas {{jury found}} Merril Leroy Jessop guilty {{of sexual assault}} of a child after deliberating only one hour. Evidence {{admitted}} at the criminal trial proved beyond <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt</b> that Merril Leroy Jessop, 35, sexually assaulted a 15-year-old girl while living at the FLDS Ranch in Schleicher County, Texas. The jury sentenced Jessop to 75 {{years in prison and}} assessed a $10,000 fine.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court reversed, holding {{there is}} no principled {{distinction}} between criminal fines and imprisonment {{for the purpose of}} Apprendi because Apprendi requires that any fact other than a prior conviction that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum must be submitted to the jury and determined beyond <b>a</b> <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt.</b> The rule preserves the historic fact-finding function of the jury. Where a fine is sufficiently substantial to trigger the Sixth Amendment jury-trial guarantee, Apprendi applies.|$|E
50|$|Carbonell's first acting {{role was}} a guest {{starring}} part as Alberto Cordova in an episode of As the World Turns.

In 1995, he starred in a dual role, Roberto and {{one half of the}} Couple in Bar, in Stephen Sondheim and George Furth's play Getting Away with Murder. That same year, he appeared as a main cast member on the short-lived The WB sitcom Muscle.

Subsequent to the airing of the 1996 HBO documentary Mumia Abu-Jamal: <b>A</b> Case For <b>Reasonable</b> <b>Doubt?,</b> which included footage from visitation interviews conducted with him, the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections acted to ban outsiders from using any recording equipment in state prisons. In litigation before the US Court of Appeals, in 1998 he successfully established his right to write for financial gain in prison.

5000|$|The {{prosecution}} bears onus {{of showing}} admissibility, {{but only on}} a balance of probabilities. This {{is in contrast to}} the normal onus to show admissibility beyond <b>reasonable</b> <b>a</b> <b>doubt.</b> The statute, in other words, has lowered the onus. This onus is of doubtful constitutionality. In S v Kotzè, {{the facts of the case}} did not make it necessary to consider this issue, but the court said obiter that the onus ought to be beyond <b>reasonable</b> <b>doubt,</b> and also stressed need for compliance with section 252A(6). The accused must be given an indication of basis of challenge. See also S v Naidoo, where the court held that the onus is beyond reasonable doubt.Note that there is a duty on the accused to set out the grounds of objection.The method of determining admissibility is, generally, by way of a trial within a trial.Some cases dealing with section 252A include* S v Hammond;* S v Mkhonto; ...|$|R
