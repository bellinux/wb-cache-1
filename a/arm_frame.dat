2500|$|In 1950 {{the company}} went into {{liquidation}} and was acquired by Scott enthusiast Matt Holder's Aerco Jig and Tool Company in Birmingham. From his premises in St Mary's Row, Holder, who was an expert silversmith initially continued to build the same model from Shipley-made spare parts. These [...] "Birmingham Scotts" [...] remained available into the 1960s. In 1956 Holder began development of a 596cc model with a duplex frame and telescopic fork front. When Matt's son David Holder moved the remaining stock to the former Triumph Motorcycles 'Number 2' factory at Meriden he found {{that his father had}} accumulated a huge collection of original Scott parts, including Miller headlights and Burgess silencers. In 1958 the Birmingham Scott was updated by adding a swinging <b>arm</b> <b>frame</b> and the dynamo was replaced by an alternator. [...] A new 493cc motorcycle called the Scott Swift was announced but never went into production, although Holder continued to develop and produce one-off Scott motorcycles until 1978.|$|E

50|$|The {{production}} 650 cc Thunderbird (6T) was a low-compression tourer, and the 500 cc Tiger 100 was {{the performance}} motorcycle. That changed in 1954, {{with the change}} to swing <b>arm</b> <b>frames,</b> {{and the release of}} the alloy head 650 cc Tiger 110, eclipsing the 500 cc Tiger 100 as the performance model.|$|R
50|$|The D7 Super was {{introduced}} for 1959, {{had a similar}} 175cc engine to the D5 but had an entirely new swinging <b>arm</b> <b>frame</b> and hydraulically damped forks which incorporated a nacelle mounted headlamp. The D7 continued in production until 1966 with at least 3 different styles of tank and alterations to the Wipac powered electrical system including a change to battery powered external coil ignition.|$|E
50|$|The slave (the actual {{subject of}} dr.ir. Van den Bedem's thesis) is a robotic <b>arm</b> <b>frame</b> which can {{accommodate}} three independent manipulators (two for surgical tools, {{one for a}} camera). The frame for the manipulators is of the type used for pick-and-place robots, allowing the manipulators full freedom of motion in space. This means that the surgeon can also choose the optimal direction of approach for any organ, {{rather than having to}} move the patient to suit the machine. Of course the manipulators also provide force feedback through the overhead cable boom.|$|E
5000|$|In 1954 the Star Twin was redesignated the Shooting Star {{with a new}} {{swinging}} <b>arm</b> <b>frame</b> and {{the engine}} further developed by reducing the stroke to 72.6 mm and increasing the bore to 66 mm, giving {{a slight increase in}} capacity to 497 cc. [...] By the end of production in 1961 the BSA Shooting Star was the culmination of the development of the BSA A7, with a deep bottle green colour scheme with light green tank, mudguards and side panels, it had an alloy cylinder head, a duplex cradle frame with swinging arm rear suspension, full-width light alloy hubs and 8-inch drum brakes. Engine compression was upgraded from 6.6:1 to 7:1 and power was up to [...] at 5800 rpm, with a top speed of just under 90 mph.|$|E

5000|$|A {{live axle}} is {{probably}} the most common axle setup used on mini choppers. The [...] "live" [...] term indicates that the axle spins along with the wheel, sprocket, and other pieces anchored to the axle. Since the axle spins, bearings are mounted to the swing <b>arm</b> <b>frame.</b> This is a very simple axle setup, and components are relatively easy to change. Each piece, such as wheel hub, disc brake rotor, sprocket, etc., are slid onto the axle and are held in place by set screws or locking collars. The components can also be separated by bushings that are cut to the desired length. Since the axle spins, the wheel, brake, and sprocket components must be locked to the axle. This is accomplished by using a square key that fits into a groove on the axle and the components.|$|E
50|$|After the War FN built unit {{construction}} sv and ohv 249 cc, 344 cc, 444 cc, and 498 cc models, and two-stroke models from 49 cc singles, to 248 cc twins. The two-stroke models used German JLO engines. The semi-unit engined Tri-car was released for civilian commercial use as the Tri-car T-8, with a five-speed gearbox. In 1947 the M.XIII {{was available in}} 250 cc ohv, 350 cc ohv, 350 cc sv, 450 cc ohv, and 450 cc sv configurations. The first model used an unusual patented Swiss coil sprung girder front fork and a new rubber rear suspension.In 1948 the Swiss forks were replaced with an adaptation of the rubber rear suspension, which was itself replaced with an improved version. In 1951 the option of telescopic forks was introduced. In 1954 a swing <b>arm</b> <b>frame</b> was introduced. By 1958 the M.XIII toolbox {{was part of the}} fuel tank.|$|E
50|$|The first Dominator, the Model 7, had a 497 cc {{parallel}} twin engine with iron cylinders and cylinder {{head and a}} Lucas K2F magneto. The crankshaft was of 360-degree layout with two main bearings. A single camshaft {{at the front of}} the engine was driven by gears and chain. The rocker box was integral with the head, so there were fewer gasket faces to leak and less valve noise. The engine was a long stroke design with 66.0 x 72.6 mm bore and stroke and mild tuning, resulting in more torque low down. For the first few years a plunger frame was used, but in 1953 the Model 7 was upgraded with a single downtube swinging <b>arm</b> <b>frame,</b> 19-inch front wheel and 'pear shaped' silencers, still known as a Model 7.The Model 7 continued in production through to 1955 and was often used with a sidecar, which could not be fitted to the later Featherbed frame Dominators.|$|E

50|$|Lewis Pilcher was a {{professor}} of art at Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, New York. He subsequently was a state architect of New York. Through his connections at Vassar, Pilcher designed the nine-story North Residence (1907), renamed in 1915 as Jewett House. The structure is composed of a four-story U-shaped <b>arms</b> <b>framing</b> an quad-side court with the rear nine-story tower incorporating a 30,000 gallon water tank. The structure extensively used steel and concrete structural components faced with red brick and terracotta ornamentation. The high level of decorative work, including crenellations, grotesque terracotta faces and animals was incongruous to Vassar’s restrained Quad dormitories and was nicknamed “Pilcher’s Crime.” The structure failed to attract donors who would attach their name and it was renamed {{in honor of the}} college’s first president, Milo P.

50|$|The {{statues of}} the Tell Asmar Hoard range in height from 21 cm (8.2 in.) to 72 cm (28.3 in.). Of the twelve statues found ten are male and two are female. Eight {{of the figures}} are made from Gypsum, two from limestone, and one (the smallest) from alabaster. All the figures, with the {{exception}} of one that is kneeling, are rendered in a standing position. Thin circular bases were used as supports and large wedge shaped feet provided the larger statues with added durability. The males wear kilts with a patterned hem that covers the midsection and thighs. Their broad shoulders and thick, circular <b>arms</b> <b>frame</b> the bare chest, which is partially covered by a black, stylized beard. All the males, {{with the exception of}} one that is bald and clean shaven, have long hair rendered in two symmetrical halves that frames the smooth surfaces of the cheeks and forehead. The large eyes, which are undoubtedly the most striking stylistic feature that the statues share in common, are made from inlays of white shell and black limestone; one figure has pupils of lapis lazuli. These materials are secured to the head with bitumen, which was also used as a pigment to give the beard and hair its characteristic black color. Both the hair and the clothing, though abstracted, accurately reflect Sumerian styles of the Early Dynastic period.|$|R
