However, several new programming languages and platforms {{have been built}} to do general purpose computation on GPUs with both Nvidia and AMD releasing programming environments with CUDA and Stream SDK respectively. Other GPU programming languages include BrookGPU, PeakStream, and RapidMind. Nvidia has also released specific products for computation in their Tesla series. The technology consortium Khronos Group has released the OpenCL specification, which is a framework for writing programs that execute across platforms consisting of CPUs and GPUs.

Rush and Irina's parents, once found, reveal that their research at the academy had been to create tablets that can transform Remnants and it is through one of these that Wagram stole that the Conqueror is able to do so. When the party travels to the God-Emperor's city, Undelwalt, to try to determine why he is supporting the Conqueror, they find Wagram, who tells them that the Conqueror is a Remnant himself. Wagram and the God-Emperor <b>are</b> <b>supporting</b> him in his quest to destroy the people of the world, who are misusing Remnants and destroying the balance of the world.|$|E

25|$|The I/O {{interface}}, also a Rambus design, {{is known}} as FlexIO. The FlexIO interface is organized into 12 lanes, each lane being a unidirectional 8-bit wide point-to-point path. Five 8-bit wide point-to-point paths are inbound lanes to Cell, while the remaining seven are outbound. This provides a theoretical peak bandwidth of 62.4GB/s (36.4GB/s outbound, 26GB/s inbound) at 2.6GHz. The FlexIO interface can be clocked independently, typ. at 3.2GHz. 4 inbound + 4 outbound lanes <b>are</b> <b>supporting</b> memory coherency.|$|E

25|$|Infertility {{is often}} not seen (by the West) as being an issue outside industrialized countries. This is because of {{assumptions}} about overpopulation problems and hyper fertility in developing countries, and a perceived need for them to decrease their populations and birth rates. The lack {{of health care and}} high rates of life-threatening illness (such as HIV/AIDS) in developing countries, such as those in Africa, <b>are</b> <b>supporting</b> reasons for the inadequate supply of fertility treatment options. Fertility treatments, even simple ones such as treatment for STIs that cause infertility, are therefore not usually made available to individuals in these countries.|$|E
