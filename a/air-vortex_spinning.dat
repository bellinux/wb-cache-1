40|$|As {{reinforcements}} for composites, VLS SiC fibrils have attractive {{mechanical properties}} including high-strength, high modulus, and excellent creep resistance. To {{make use of}} their excellent mechanical properties in a composite, a significant volume fraction (> 10 %) of aligned, long fibrils (> 2 mm) needs to be consolidated in the ceramic matrix. The fibrils must be processed into an assembly that will allow for composite fabrication while maintaining fibril alignment and length. With Advanced Product Development (APD) as the yam fabrication subcontractor, Carborundum investigated several approaches to achieve this goaL including traditional yam-forming processes such as carding and <b>air-vortex</b> <b>spinning</b> and nontraditional processes such as tape forming and wet casting. Carborundum additionally performed an economic analysis for producing 500 and 10, 000 pounds of SiC fibrils annually using both conservative and more aggressive processing parameters. With the aggressive approach, the projected costs for SiC fibril production for 500 and 10, 000 pounds per year are $ 1, 340 /pound and $ 340 /pound, respectively...|$|E
