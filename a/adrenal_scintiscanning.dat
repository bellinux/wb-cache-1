40|$|This is a {{case report}} of a 14 -year-old girl with {{multiple}} endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2 b. The patient had mucosal neuromas, medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, bumpy lips, hypertrophied corneal nerves, absent flare response following intradermal histamine injection, high arched palate, oligodontia, pes cavus and polypoid lesions in the colon. Urinary catecholamines were normal and the patient's blood pressure did not rise abnormally after glucagon or histamine infusions. The left adrenal gland was not visualized on examination by <b>adrenal</b> <b>scintiscanning,</b> but by computed tomography it was enlarged. Nerve growth factor (NGF) was normal in the serum. Extensive studies failed to identify other family members with MEN. This patient {{seems to be a}} sporadic case...|$|E
40|$|Unilateral adrenal {{tuberculosis}} is a {{very rare}} disease. A 66 -year-old woman presented with epigastric discomfort and general fatigue. Abdominal CT scan revealed a homogeneous mass shadow in the right adrenal region. Findings of physical examination were normal except that the patient was obese. Hormonal data were in normal range. <b>Adrenal</b> <b>scintiscanning</b> demonstrated no RI uptake in the right adrenal gland. Right adrenalectomy was performed under the diagnosis of nonfunctioning tumor of the right adrenal gland. Histopathological examination, however, revealed typical tuberculosis with Langhans' type of giant cells and infiltrated lymphocytes. Of 322, 148 autopsies performed during the twelve years between 1970 and 1981 in Japan, 228 cases of adrenal tuberculosis were recognized. Furthermore, only 18 cases had tuberculous regions in the adrenal gland alone...|$|E
40|$|A 54 -year-old {{patient was}} found to have an aldosterone-producing microadenoma {{measuring}} 2. 5 mm in diameter. Although adrenal venography by selective catheterization had failed to demonstrate the tumour, <b>adrenal</b> <b>scintiscan</b> using 131 I- 19 -iodocholesterol accurately localized the functional tumour in the right adrenal gland; a dexamethasone-modified <b>adrenal</b> <b>scintiscan</b> revealed complete suppression of radioactivity in the right adrenal gland. These findings suggest that <b>adrenal</b> <b>scintiscan,</b> together with <b>adrenal</b> vein blood analysis, is capable of detecting a small adenoma before surgery, and that dexamethasone suppression of an <b>adrenal</b> <b>scintiscan</b> does not exclude an adenoma...|$|R
40|$|The <b>adrenal</b> <b>scintiscan</b> with 123 I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), a {{reliable}} morphofunctional technique to evaluate catecholamine turnover in adrenal tumors, {{can be a}} useful method to investigate adrenal incidentalomas with arterial hypertension. A male patient, 44 yr old with diabetes, unstable arterial hypertension, and sudden paroxysms of tachycardia is described. The presence of a disomogeneous right juxta-adrenal neoplasm with calcifications was evidenced with ultrasound tomography and confirmed by computerized tomography (CT) scan. <b>Adrenal</b> 123 I-MIBG <b>scintiscan</b> revealed a unilateral uptake at level of the right juxta-adrenal region, sized similarly to the neoplasm previously evidence by CT scan. Histological findings of the surgically removed neoplasm were consistent with an ancient schwannoma. Apart from pheochromocytomas, the MIBG uptake is commonly reported in neuroblastomas. In neuroblastoma, a bidirectional process of transdifferentiation has been previously reported in vitro between two coexistent cells: cells with specific uptake system for norepinephrine, with 123 I-MIBG uptake capability, and cells oriented toward schwann/melanocytic line. The evidence of in vivo MIBG uptake in our schwannoma {{may be caused by}} the same possible phenotypic interconversion of above mentioned cell types. In conclusion, the presence of adrenal tumors with MIBG uptake capability, apart from pheochromocytomas, neuroblastomas, ganglioneuroblastomas, and ganglioneuromas, must be considered in the diagnosis of adrenal tumors...|$|R
40|$|The {{diagnosis}} of primary aldosteronism (PA) {{is based on}} the finding of the combination of elevated urinary and/or plasma aldosterone and suppressed renin activity in patients with hypertension and hypokalemia. However, PA consists in a number of subsets, and diagnostic criteria for a correct identification of surgically remediable forms are of great interest. The methods and the results concerning our series of 113 patients with primary aldosteronism are presented in this review. Aldosterone producing adenoma (APA) and idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (IHA) were the most frequent forms, 51 % and 44 % respectively. They had similar BP levels, but hypokalemia was most frequently found in APA. Urinary and upright plasma aldosterone were similar, but supine plasma aldosterone was lower in IHA. Plasma aldosterone response to upright posture and angiotensin II infusion was absent in most cases of APA and present in IHA, but occasionally renin-responsive adenoma were found. Captopril failed to decrease plasma aldosterone in most patients with APA, and in a subgroup of patients with IHA. Patients with adenoma had also higher values of the aldosterone precursor 18 -OH-B, and of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), probably as a consequence of a greater degree of volume expansion. Among morphological studies, CT scan and <b>adrenal</b> radio-cholesterol <b>scintiscan</b> provided similar results (85 % accuracy) : adrenal vein catheterization clarified almost all the remaining cases. Among the subsets of PA, 3 familiar cases of dex-suppressible hyperaldosteronism were recognized, with characteristically high levels of aldo, 18 -OH-B, 18 -OH-cortisol and 18 -oxo-cortisol, due to the genetic abnormalities of the 11 - 18 hydroxylase system.
