40|$|In this study, <b>a</b> <b>purpose-built</b> <b>corpus,</b> {{containing}} both child-produced and child-directed speech, is used {{to conduct}} a longitudinal examination of antonym use among children {{from the age of}} two to five years old. Previous research has tended to approach antonym acquisition using either elicitation techniques or corpora of printed adult language. In contrast, this research focuses on the speech of preschool children in naturally-occurring interactions. The discourse functions of antonymy in child-produced and child-directed speech are quantified and compared with those identified in adult, written English (Jones 2002). Despite its complexity, Ancillary Antonymy is found to be most common in child-produced speech, even from the age of two, perhaps because of its particular usefulness in structuring ideas and discourse. This study presents a detailed inter-corpus comparison, assesses the discourse functions of antonymy at different stages of childhood, and discusses the correlation between antonym use in child-directed and child-produced speec...|$|E
40|$|TECMATE is {{a dynamic}} TEchnical Corpus for MAchine Translation Evaluation {{currently}} being compiled and used at the University of Leeds. <b>A</b> <b>purpose-built</b> <b>corpus</b> for machine translation (MT) evaluation differs in terms of size and content from corpora used for other kinds of linguistic analysis. For example, our research in automated MT evaluation requires source texts with human and machine translations {{as well as the}} scores for these translations given by human judges. These scores will allow us to test the reliability of experimental automated evaluation methods. Furthermore, a representative sample of machine translations annotated with fluency errors is also required to guide our research into automated error detection. In this paper, we summarise our rationale for corpus design and describe the different stages of corpus development. We provide an example of the content for one language pair and present findings from our recent evaluations of MT output using texts from the French-English sub-corpus. TECMATE will shortly be available online for research...|$|E
40|$|While corpus {{linguistics}} {{has existed}} since the 1960 s, Forensic Linguistics {{is a relatively}} new discipline, involving both linguistic evidence in court and wider applications of linguistics to legal texts and discourses. Computer corpora of natural language may be marked up in various ways, grammatically tagged, parsed, lemmatised and analysed with concordance, collocation and other specialist soft ware. In the relatively short history of forensic linguistics, its exponents have oft en employed corpus linguistics techniques in order to throw light on questions like disputed authorship. However, the corpora employed have been general ones such as the Cobuild “Bank of English”, rather than purpose-built databases of language used in legal contexts, with the result that such research sometimes raises more questions than it answers. Conversely, corpus linguists have from time to time incorporated data from legal settings into their collections; but they have tended to use these resources as the basis for sociolinguistic or historical linguistic research rather than as a means of exploring topics in language and law. This paper makes a plea for these two fi elds, which are both already cross-disciplinary, to join forces and create <b>a</b> <b>purpose-built</b> <b>corpus</b> for forensic linguistics. It illustrates how corpus techniques may be successfully applied to questions of disputed authorship, citing both hypothetical and actual examples. It ends with an outline of the kinds of texts which a proposed new corpus for Forensic Linguistics should contain and the tools required to exploit it effectively...|$|E
40|$|Autobiographies {{allow for}} the {{analysis}} of evidential stance in the production of immediate knowledge opposed to mediate knowledge provided by autobiography translation, differentiating the author/translator narrative persona. This article analyses “REMEMBER-constructions” as linguistic marker for evidential stance used by the narrator to define the source of the knowledge narrated. The investigation of <b>a</b> <b>purpose-built</b> electronic <b>corpus</b> of non-translated and translated autobiographies in English and Japanese between 1990 and 2010 shows a higher proportion of markers related to a non-experiential (or “mediative”) stance in translation. These preliminary results may suggest a non-coincidence of the author/translator persona in the texts analysed, where the translator becomes a biographer...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} Spanish nation-building from a social-constructionist perspective {{assuming that}} nations are historically evolving social constructs and that nationhood is a largely modern phenomenon with pre-modern antecedents. A theoretical model for studying nationhood is proposed {{based on a}} critique of nationalism theories, Giddens’s social structuration model (Giddens 1984) refined by Sewell (2005); modernisation theories and discourse analytical approaches. A discourse-oriented methodology is proposed: Spanish nation-building, conceptualised as semiotically-mediated social action situated across time-space, is analysed nomothetically and ideographically, both in its broad historical context and in connection with recent narratives extracted from <b>a</b> large <b>purpose-built</b> <b>corpus</b> of newspaper articles. Several factors behind Spain’s problematic nation-building are identified in the socio-historical analysis: an unyielding geography inhibiting communications, {{a long history of}} political and cultural fragmentation, a late and uneven modernisation and the lack of hegemonic national narratives {{in the context of a}} long history of confrontation between different identities. The corpus-based discourse analytical approach employed in the latter part of the analysis illustrates the potential offered by corpus-assisted discourse studies in social research, revealing that a widely-accepted Spanish identity discourse from the centre’s perspective has not yet emerged...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{was conducted}} within the project Language Toolkit, {{which has the}} aim of integrating the worlds of work and university. In particular, it consists of the translation into English of documents commissioned by the Italian company TR Turoni and its primary purpose is to demonstrate that, {{in the field of}} translation for companies, the existing translation support tools and software can optimise and facilitate the translation process. The work consists of five chapters. The first introduces the Language Toolkit project, the TR Turoni company and its relationship with the CERMAC export consortium. After outlining the current state of company internationalisation, the importance of professional translators in enhancing the competitiveness of companies that enter new international markets is highlighted. Chapter two provides an overview of the texts to be translated, focusing on the textual function and typology and on the addressees. After that, manual translation and the main software developed specifically for translators are described, with a focus on computer-assisted translation (CAT) and machine translation (MT). The third chapter presents the target texts and the corresponding translations. Chapter four is dedicated to the analysis of the translation process. The first two texts were translated manually, with the support of <b>a</b> <b>purpose-built</b> specialized <b>corpus.</b> The following two documents were translated with the software SDL Trados Studio 2011 and its applications. The last texts were submitted to the Google Translate service and to a process of pre and post-editing. Finally, in chapter five conclusions are drawn about the main limits and potentialities of the different translations techniques. In addition to this, the importance of an integrated use of all available instruments is underlined. ...|$|R
40|$|Appropriate {{reference}} to other texts {{is an essential}} feature of most academic writing, and we should expect courses in academic writing to sensitize students to the choices {{that are available to}} them when they decide to refer to other texts. A brief review of popular EAP writing textbooks finds, however, that attention is given mainly to surface features of citation, focusing on quotation, summary, and paraphrase. Analysis of <b>a</b> <b>purpose-built</b> <b>corpus</b> of academic text can reveal much about what writers actually do, and can also generate rich speculation on why writers do what they do. Extending Swales ' (1990) division of citation forms into integral or non-integral, we present a classification scheme and the results of applying this scheme to the coding of academic texts in a corpus. The texts are doctoral theses, written in two departments: Agricultural Botany and Agricultural Economics. The results lead into a comparison of the citation practices of writers in different disciplines and the different rhetorical practices of these disciplines. Comparison with Hyland (1999), which looks at citation types in research articles, also indicates differences between genres. We then look at examples of EAP student writing and apply the same analysis to these texts. The results show that the novice writers use a limited range of citation types, and we suggest that teaching should focus on extending the range of choices available to students. Lastly, we introduce a number of class activities in which students conduct their own analyses of citation practices in small corpora, to develop genre awareness, and we evaluate these activities...|$|E
40|$|This study uses <b>a</b> <b>purpose-built</b> <b>corpus</b> {{to explore}} the {{linguistic}} legacy of Britain’s maritime history found {{in the form of}} hundreds of specialised ‘Maritime Expressions’ (MEs), such as TAKEN ABACK, ANCHOR and ALOOF, that permeate modern English. Selecting just those expressions commencing with ’A’, it analyses 61 MEs in detail and describes the processes by which these technical expressions, from a highly specialised occupational discourse community, have made their way into modern English. The Maritime Text Corpus (MTC) comprises 8. 8 million words, encompassing a range of text types and registers, selected to provide a cross-section of ‘maritime’ writing. It is analysed using WordSmith analytical software (Scott, 2010), with the 100 million-word British National Corpus (BNC) as a reference corpus. Using the MTC, a list of keywords of specific salience within the maritime discourse has been compiled and, using frequency data, concordances and collocations, these MEs are described in detail and their use and form in the MTC and the BNC is compared. The study examines the transformation from ME to figurative use in the general discourse, in terms of form and metaphoricity. MEs are classified according to their metaphorical strength and their transference from maritime usage into new registers and domains such as those of business, politics, sports and reportage etc. A revised model of metaphoricity is developed and a new category of figurative expression, the ‘resonator’, is proposed. Additionally, developing the work of Lakov and Johnson, Kovesces and others on Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT), a number of Maritime Conceptual Metaphors are identified and their cultural significance is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Automatic {{classification}} of text documents into {{a set of}} categories {{has a lot of}} applications. Among those applications, the automatic {{classification of}} biomedical literature stands out as an important application for automatic document classification strategies. Biomedical staff and researchers have to deal with a lot of literature in their daily activities, so it would be useful a system that allows for accessing to documents of interest in a simple and effective way; thus, it is necessary that these documents are sorted based on some criteria—that is to say, they have to be classified. Documents to classify are usually represented following the bag-of-words (BoW) paradigm. Features are words in the text—thus suffering from synonymy and polysemy—and their weights are just based on their frequency of occurrence. This paper presents an empirical study of the efficiency of a classifier that leverages encyclopedic background knowledge—concretely Wikipedia—in order to create bag-of-concepts (BoC) representations of documents, understanding concept as “unit of meaning”, and thus tackling synonymy and polysemy. Besides, the weighting of concepts is based on their semantic relevance in the text. For the evaluation of the proposal, empirical experiments have been conducted with one of the commonly used corpora for evaluating classification and retrieval of biomedical information, OHSUMED, and also with <b>a</b> <b>purpose-built</b> <b>corpus</b> of MEDLINE biomedical abstracts, UVigoMED. Results obtained show that the Wikipedia-based bag-of-concepts representation outperforms the classical bag-of-words representation up to 157 % in the single-label classification problem and up to 100 % in the multi-label problem for OHSUMED corpus, and up to 122 % in the single-label classification problem and up to 155 % in the multi-label problem for UVigoMED corpus...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{identify}} and explore typical stylistic traits in the work of two translators, using a corpus-based, data-driven methodology. Following Halliday (1971), Leech and Short (1981) and Baker (2000), the translator’s style is seen here as involving a consistent pattern of choices that distinguishes the work of one translator from that of others. In the present study such patterns emerge from a data-driven analysis of <b>a</b> <b>purpose-built</b> parallel <b>corpus</b> containing works of Spanish and Portuguese fiction and their translations into English by Margaret Jull Costa and Peter Bush. Comparative dataare drawn from COMPARA, a bi-directional parallel corpus of English and Portuguese narrative. The quantitative analysis shows that Margaret Jull Costa makes greater use of italics for emphasis than does Peter Bush, or than would be expected on the basis of norms for translations from Portuguese. Peter Bush’s translations, on the other hand, are characterized by a comparatively high use of source language words. The qualitative analysis focuses on the communicative function of emphatic italics and source language words in context, drawing on the Hallidayan (1967) notion of information focus, on Hermans’ (1996) treatment of self-referentiality and Aixclâ 2 ̆ 7 s (1996) treatment of culture-specificity in translation. I argue that Margaret Jull Costa emphasises readability in her translations, which leads to a discussion of explicitation (Blum-Kulka 1986 / 2001, Klaudy and Kâroly 2005, House 2004), and to a further study, modelled on Olohan and Baker (2000), that compares patterns of omission and inclusion of the connective 2 ̆ 7 that 2 ̆ 7 after reporting verbs SAY and TELL. The findings are discussed in the light of the translators 2 ̆ 7 backgrounds and ideologies, as evidenced from their writings on translation and from interviews carried out by the researcher. I conclude that one of the motivating factors behind the translators 2 ̆ 7 strategies is how they see their role as translators in relation to their audiences...|$|R

40|$|This thesis, {{based on}} <b>a</b> <b>purpose-built</b> <b>corpus</b> of {{political}} discourse from the UK, US, and France, focuses on electoral discourse and, more specifically, on adversarial relations within electoral discourse. It draws on theories of politeness and adversariality to characterise what adversarial discourse is made of, that is, it defines the adversarial moves performed by politicians in an electoral context. I firstly ask {{how does one}} do adversariality, second, I consider the importance of individual style {{in the performance of}} adversarial moves, and third, I review the goals that politicians hope to achieve. To carry out this analysis, I consider the three traditional discourse subtypes featured in electoral discourse: debates, speeches, and manifestos. The claim of this research is that adversarial discourse does not exclusively occur in an interactional environment, as it is currently defined, but that the moves it is made of, facework, Face Threatening Acts (FTAs), evasion techniques, and stancetaking, can also be carried out {{in the absence of the}} adversary/opponent. I set out to define adversarial moves as found in interactional electoral discourse: election debates. I focus on the 2012 US presidential election debate series between the Democrat and Republican “tickets. ” Second, I consider the findings from the debate series and transpose them to campaign speeches, a context in which speech acts are still performed by individuals in front of an audience, thus, still in an interactional context. Finally, I ask whether the adversarial moves I have identified so far can be found in a monologic type of electoral discourse: manifestos. I conclude that the absence of direct interaction does not impair the performance of adversarial moves, that individual style as well as personality impact on that performance, and that different types of goals motivate adversarial moves...|$|E
40|$|The advent and the {{diffusion}} of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have dramatically changed the way Governments convey financial information {{to a wide range}} of stakeholders. Nowadays, the Internet in particular is universally deemed a powerful tool Governments and citizens have at their disposal to prove their accountability and to assess it. Nevertheless, whenever the every-day citizen finds some difficulties in understanding such sort of language smartly named “accounting-ese”- which is, by contrast, commonly and successfully used in professional, institutional and academic communication - specific contents of the information conveyed may be sometimes lost and, as a result, the underlying communication process adversely affected. With an eye towards such a perspective, the aim of the present paper is to test the effective role of the Internet technology in fulfilling the citizens’ information needs. Emphasis will be put on the user-orientation paradigm, specifically analysed with reference to two different governmental environments: the American one, which politically shows an old and strong federal tradition, and the Italian one, which is presently moving its first steps towards such a direction. The paper, which is part of an ongoing research project, will pragmatically focus on a content-analysis-based comparison. The study will be conducted on <b>a</b> <b>purpose-built</b> <b>corpus</b> encompassing a large variety of American and Italian official financial documents available on the two most significant “governmental” websites: the General Accounting Office (www. gao/gov) and the “Dipartimento della Ragioneria Generale dello Stato – National General Accounting Department”(www. rgs. mef. gov. it), respectively. Although the paradigm of the so-called user-orientation ranks as a key-concept in the American accounting realm, it does not seem to have reached a comparable standard in Italy, where financial statements and official documents have been witnessing both resistant formalism and sharp bureaucratic attitudes, despite the Italian progressive shift from cash to accrual basis of accounting...|$|E
