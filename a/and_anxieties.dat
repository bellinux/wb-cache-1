5|$|The game's plot {{describes}} {{a journey through}} a child's emotions <b>and</b> <b>anxieties.</b> After befriending the monster, the boy leaves Earth on the creature's back to look for life elsewhere in the galaxy. He hopes {{to find someone to}} relate to. The hollow planet Gravida's surface is patrolled by a creature that complains of stomach pains. This larger creature is followed by several tiny creatures, some of which ride on its back. One of these smaller inhabitants has fallen into the core of Gravida. Though it is isolated and lonely, the creature consoles itself that nobody can harm it. The planet Malaisus is composed of water, with a monster identical to the player's swimming around with a shoal of fish. The monster tells the player to leave. Planet Bibulon has two faces on opposite sides, one angry and one happy. A two-faced creature travels across the surface; one is happy and the other morose. Bibulon is orbited by four moons, each of which has differing opinions on an unnamed man or boy. When players find the planet Debasa, they discover that it is surrounded by a green fog. Gravity is very intense within the fog. Four orbiting satellites produce the fog, which has trapped two boys. Earth shrinks slightly after each planet has been completed. After restoring color to all the surrounding planets, the game is completed by returning to Earth. The Earth has shrunk until it is only slightly larger than the monster; it is destroyed when the boy and his monster land. Both fly upwards and land on the moon, where the boy is free to craft a future of his choosing.|$|E

40|$|Objective. To {{examine the}} effects of {{temperament}} and character profiles on state and trait depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety</b> in a Japanese youth population. Method. Japanese university students were solicited for participation in a two-wave study, with assessments performed at Time 1 (T 1) and Time 2 (T 2), separated by a five-month interval. A total of 184 students completed the Japanese version of the temperament and character inventory (TCI) at T 1 <b>and</b> the Hospital <b>Anxiety</b> <b>and</b> Depression Scale (HADS) at T 1 and T 2. We posited two latent variables, trait depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety,</b> composed of the T 1 and T 2 HADS depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety</b> scores, respectively. We also posited that temperament domain traits would predict character domain traits, and that all the personality traits would be linked to trait depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> also predict T 2 depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety.</b> Results. Structural regression modeling showed that (1) only high Novelty Seeking predicted T 2 Anxiety score, (2) trait depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety</b> were linked to high harm avoidance and low self-directedness, and (3) trait depression was linked to high self-transcendence whereas trait anxiety was linked to low reward dependence, persistence, and cooperativeness.

40|$|There is {{evidence}} that a relationship exists between adolescent peer relationships and both depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety.</b> Autonomy with peers and peer attachment are two important aspects of peer relationships. Overall, the literature on adolescent peer relationships includes support for the hypothesis that multiple aspects of peer relationships are related to symptoms of depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety.</b> Psychological adjustment, including depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety,</b> is related to peer conflict in adolescents. The current study provided evidence that adolescent peer relationships are likely predictive {{for the development of}} depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety.</b> Each variable studied in terms of relationships was significantly related to both depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety.</b> Conflict with peers was the most predictive of depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety</b> in adolescence. Furthermore, attachment and autonomy were also predictive of depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety.</b> Although individuals who have strong peer attachment experienced fewer symptoms of depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety</b> than those who do not, peer attachment {{does not appear to be}} a protective factor against peer conflict in prediction of depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety.</b> Furthermore, gender doesn 2 ̆ 7 t appear to impact this relation. Girls did not appear to experience more internalizing symptoms as a result of difficulties in relationships. Overall, 2 ̆ 7 results 2 ̆ 7 of the study indicated that adolescents who experience difficulties in peer relationships, particularly conflict with peers, are most likely to have symptoms of depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety.</b> These results suggest that mental health can be enhanced through addressing difficulties in peer relationships through intervention programs and increasing support groups...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The primary {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to assess the relationship between coping strategies, resilience <b>and</b> <b>anxiety</b> among older Australians. In particular the study aims to assess whether resilience mediates the relationship between coping <b>and</b> <b>anxiety.</b> Design: A survey was used to measure the variables of interest: Coping strategies, resilience <b>and</b> <b>anxiety.</b> Method: A total of 302 participants were recruited through clubs and community groups in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Townsville. Peason's correlations and bootstrapped multiple regression analyses was used to analyse the data. Results: Resilience was found to positively correlate with all forms of coping, apart from instrumental support seeking. Resilience was also found to negatively correlate with anxiety. Significant negative correlations were found between proactive coping <b>and</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> strategic planning <b>and</b> <b>anxiety.</b> Mediation analysis revealed resilience to be a very strong mediator of the relationship between proactive coping <b>and</b> <b>anxiety</b> among older Australians.

25|$|Sigmund Freud, who {{developed}} the psychological discipline of psychoanalysis, wrote extensively about dream theories and their interpretations in the early 1900s. He explained dreams as manifestations of one's deepest desires <b>and</b> <b>anxieties,</b> often relating to repressed childhood memories or obsessions. Furthermore, he believed that virtually every dream topic, regardless of its content, represented the release of sexual tension. In The Interpretation of Dreams (1899), Freud developed a psychological technique to interpret dreams and devised a series of guidelines to understand the symbols and motifs that appear in our dreams. In modern times, dreams {{have been seen as}} a connection to the unconscious mind. They range from normal and ordinary to overly surreal and bizarre. Dreams can have varying natures, such as being frightening, exciting, magical, melancholic, adventurous, or sexual. The events in dreams are generally outside the control of the dreamer, with the exception of lucid dreaming, where the dreamer is self-aware. Dreams can at times make a creative thought occur to the person or give a sense of inspiration.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety</b> {{are common}} in {{diabetic}} patients; however, {{in recent years the}} frequency of these symptoms has markedly increased worldwide. Therefore, it is necessary to establish the frequency and factors associated with depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety,</b> since they can be responsible for premature morbidity, mortality, risk of developing comorbidities, complications, suffering of patients, as well as escalation of costs. We studied the frequency of depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety</b> in Mexican outpatients with type 2 diabetes and identified the risk factors for depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety.</b> METHODS <b>AND</b> FINDINGS: We performed a study in 820 patients with type 2 diabetes. The prevalence of depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety</b> was estimated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale <b>and</b> the Hamilton <b>Anxiety</b> Rating Scale, respectively. We calculated the proportions for depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>and,</b> after adjusting for confounding variables, we performed multivariate analysis using multiple logistic regressions to evaluate the combined effect of the various factors associated with <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> depression among persons with type 2 diabetes. The rates for depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety</b> were 48. 27 % (95 % CI: 44. 48 - 52. 06) and 55. 10 % (95 % CI: 51. 44 - 58. 93), respectively. Occupation and complications in diabetes were the factors associated with anxiety, whereas glucose level and complications in diabetes were associated with depression. Complications in diabetes was a factor common to depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety</b> (p< 0. 0001; OR 1. 79, 95 % CI 1. 29 - 2. 4). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that a large proportion of diabetic patients present depression and/or anxiety. We also identified a significant association between complications in diabetes with depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety.</b> Interventions are necessary to hinder the appearance of complications in diabetes and in consequence prevent depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety...</b>|$|R

40|$|Background: Individuals {{experiencing}} psychosis {{can present}} with {{elevated levels of}} depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety.</b> Research suggests that aspects of depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety</b> may serve an avoidant function by limiting the processing of more distressing material. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy suggests that avoidance of aversive mental experiences contributes to psychological inflexibility. Depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety</b> occurring {{in the context of}} psychosis have a limiting effect on quality of life. No research to date has investigated how levels of psychological flexibility and mindfulness are associated with depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety</b> occurring following psychosis. Aims: This study investigated associations psychological flexibility and mindfulness had with depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety</b> following psychosis. Method: Thirty participants with psychosis were recruited by consecutive referral on the basis that they were experiencing emotional dysfunction following psychosis. The Hospital <b>Anxiety</b> <b>and</b> Depression Scale (HADS), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), Acceptance and Action Questionnaire (AAQ-II) and the Kentucky Inventory of Mindfulness Skills (KIMS) were used. A cross-sectional correlational design was used. Results: The depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety</b> subscales of the HADS both had significant correlations with psychological flexibility (as assessed by the AAQ-II) and aspects of mindfulness (as assessed by the KIMS). Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that psychological flexibility, but not mindfulness, contributed significantly to models predicting 46 % of variance in both depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety</b> scores. Conclusions: Although aspects of mindfulness are associated with depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety</b> following an episode of psychosis, psychological flexibility appears to account for a larger proportion of variance in depression <b>and</b> <b>anxiety</b> scores in this population...|$|R
