2500|$|In 1948, Oslo {{was awarded}} to host the 1952 Winter Olympics. This caused <b>a</b> <b>bonanza</b> of plans, one {{superseding}} the other. Until then, the grandstand {{on the sides of}} the hill had been temporary; prior to the Olympics these were rebuilt as permanent. A new grandstand was built, a jury tower was constructed, as was facilities for the delegates, the royal family and radio broadcasting. The in-run was rebuilt; while it previously had been a mess of open, wooden structures, it was shelled in, painted white and received an elevator. The hill had to be expanded, and to allow this, the landing slope needed to be lifted by being built as an artificial structure. Below the lifted part of the hill was built a three-story building, with the ski museum in the lower two floors and a restaurant in the top floor. The lake was dug [...] deep and made a swimming pool during the summer. The upgrades cost NOK1.5 million, paid for by Oslo Municipality. These upgrades resulted in an artificial lake being constructed in the off-run, which became a recreational and swimming venue for the city's residents. The lake was at the time [...] deep and had a typical temperature of [...] Oslo had a failed bid for the 1968 Winter Olympics.|$|E
2500|$|Buck {{comes to}} love and grow devoted to Thornton as he nurses him back to health. He saves Thornton when the man falls into a river. After Thornton takes him on trips to pan for gold, <b>a</b> <b>bonanza</b> king (someone who hit it rich in a certain area) wagers Thornton on the dog's {{strength}} and devotion. Buck wins by breaking a half-ton (...) sled free of the frozen ground, pulling it [...] and winning US$1,600 in gold dust. A king of the Skookum Benches offers a large sum to buy Buck, but Thornton has grown fond of him and declines. While Thornton and his friends continue their search for gold, Buck explores the wilderness and socializes with a timber wolf from a local pack. One night, he returns from a log hunt to find that his beloved master and {{the others in the}} camp have been killed by a group of Yeehat natives. Buck eventually kills the natives to avenge Thornton, and he then is attacked by an entire pack of wolves. Buck wins the fight, then finds that the same timber wolf he had socialized with is in the pack he fought. Buck then follows the wolf and its pack into the forest, and answers the call of the wild. At the end of the story, Buck returns each year as the Ghost Dog of the Northland Legend, to mourn at the site of Thornton's death.|$|E
2500|$|Oil {{development}} in the Channel and adjacent coastline was controversial even from the earliest days, as by the late 19th century the city was beginning to establish itself as a health resort and tourist destination with dramatic natural scenery, unspoiled beaches, and a perfect climate. [...] In the late 1890s, when the Summerland field began to expand {{much closer to the}} city of Santa Barbara, a crowd of midnight vigilantes headed by local newspaper publisher Reginald Fernald tore down one of the more unsightly rigs erected on Miramar Beach itself (in 2010 the location of a luxury hotel). [...] In 1927, the discovery of oil west of Santa Barbara {{led to the development of}} Ellwood Oil Field. This caused the city to be bracketed on east and west with oil fields, the new one <b>a</b> <b>bonanza</b> and the depleted Summerland field a largely abandoned, blighted waste. [...] In 1929, the Mesa Oil Field was discovered within the city itself, on the blufftop adjacent to present-day Santa Barbara City College. [...] Residential construction in the vicinity of the Mesa field halted, as oil presented easier and faster money to the land developers. [...] Oil derricks sprouted on the hilltop within easy view of the harbor, on narrow town lots intended originally for houses. [...] While local protests were vocal, they failed to shut down the oil development, as there was a city ordinance at the time specifically allowing drilling on the Mesa. [...] The oil derricks only went away when production on the small Mesa field abruptly declined and ended in the late 1930s.|$|E
