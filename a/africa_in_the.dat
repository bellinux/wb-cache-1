5|$|As the 5th century progressed, {{many of the}} Empire's {{original}} borders {{had been}} either wholly or partially denuded of troops to support the central field army.

5|$|Britain's {{fears of}} war with Germany were {{realised}} in 1914 with {{the outbreak of the}} First World War. Britain quickly invaded and occupied most of Germany's overseas colonies in <b>Africa.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Pacific, Australia and New Zealand occupied German New Guinea and Samoa respectively. Plans for a post-war division of the Ottoman Empire, which had joined the war on Germany's side, were secretly drawn up by Britain and France under the 1916 Sykes–Picot Agreement. This agreement was not divulged to the Sharif of Mecca, who the British had been encouraging to launch an Arab revolt against their Ottoman rulers, giving the impression that Britain was supporting the creation of an independent Arab state.|$|E

She was present in East Africa amid rising tensions with Britain during the Second Boer War in 1899, and frequently suppressed uprisings in Germany's Pacific island holdings in the decade before the outbreak of World War I. Badly worn out, she returned to Germany in March 1914 and was removed from service. In 1916, she was converted into a storage hulk for mines. After the end of World War I, she was discarded and broken up for scrap in 1921.|$|E

During that tour, Donald Currie donated the Currie Cup to be awarded to the team which performed best against the touring side; which was judged to be Kimberley. In other first-class matches during the 1889–90 season, Kimberley faced Natal twice, winning both matches. Transvaal did not play any first-class cricket prior to their Currie Cup contest with Kimberley.|$|E

5|$|For the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, {{the final}} tournament is rotated between confederations, {{allowing}} only countries from the chosen confederation (Africa in 2010, South America in 2014) to bid {{to host the}} tournament. The rotation policy was introduced after the controversy surrounding Germany's victory over South <b>Africa</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> vote to host the 2006 tournament. However, the policy of continental rotation will not continue beyond 2014, so any country, except those belonging to confederations that hosted the two preceding tournaments, can apply as hosts for World Cups starting from 2018. This is partly to avoid a similar scenario to the bidding process for the 2014 tournament, where Brazil was the only official bidder.|$|E
