500|$|.....of [...] that I have read, the {{negative}} ones often {{say something to}} the effect that the book is just like the game, so why read it? What those readers may not realize is that I was hired to novelize the game. That means taking the game and turning it into a book [...] or, put another way, I did what I was hired to do. ...there must be some folks who feel that I wrote the Chief out of character. That's news to me. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> is that the Bungie folks, who care deeply about the character and the universe never raised that issue, and approved the book as written. However, there's no doubt that every author is different, and will approach characters differently. So if Nylund's rendition of the Chief is different from my own in subtle ways that would be understandable.|$|E
2500|$|<b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{is that it}} {{completely}} and utterly changed my life. I was a white hippie boy and then I saw exit wounds from M1 rifles out of the backs of two people I knew.|$|E
60|$|LEVER. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> is: This {{is as far}} as we've got, and we {{want more}} money before we can get any farther.|$|E
6000|$|... “I shouldn’t be {{much the}} better for that, you see,” says <b>I.</b> “For <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell,</b> {{it might have been}} whole empty yesterday.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shouldn't be {{much the}} better for that, you see," [...] says <b>I.</b> [...] "For <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell,</b> {{it might have been}} whole empty yesterday." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is better}} not to understand," [...] he answered. [...] "It is even better for Joan to believe what she does. That is <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Alton gravely. [...] "He did, but he tacked {{a kind of}} {{condition}} on to it, and--well, that's about <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> Charley." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, that's <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{about the}} new religion," [...] went on Flambeau carelessly. [...] "It claims, of course, that it can cure all {{physical}} diseases." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{you have}} it still,' said Elizabeth; 'deliver it up, if you please; {{it is the best}} of <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> I had a cursory view of it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Anne sighed bitterly, {{and kissed}} her on the forehead. [...] "You shall know <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you--all <b>I</b> dare tell you," [...] she said, gently. [...] "Don't reproach me. It hurts me more than you think." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{know nothing}} of Miss Duge," [...] Littleson said, [...] "nor have we {{received}} the paper nor any news of it. If Miss Stella has stolen it, she has not brought it to us. That is <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|And {{suddenly}} it shot through his mind; like a sick man's fancy: What's he doing?--that fellow who haunts me, {{who was here}} this evening, who's {{in love with my}} wife--prowling out there, perhaps, looking for her as I know he was looking for her this afternoon; watching my house now, for <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell!</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have read}} the account of this--terrible thing, and you have heard <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> Doubtless you have formed some idea {{concerning}} it. Would you mind telling it to me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was the lonesomest and craziest sound I've ever heard," [...] {{declared}} Peter, [...] "and that is <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> It was crazier {{than the}} voice of Old Man Coyote." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> You must suppose {{an extreme}} case. You may {{take my word}} for it that under certain {{circumstances}} Lucille would have no power to deny them anything." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Fair damsel,' said Sir James, in a {{much more}} gentle tone, 'you forget that I am only a poor prisoner, who have only now and then viewed the lady Joan Beaufort with distant reverence, as destined to be my queen. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> is, that her walk and bearing mark her out for a throne.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Jess," [...] he said, [...] "I {{think that}} you might speak a little more kindly to me, considering--considering all things. There, don't cry, they are all right at Mooifontein, and I dare say that we shall win back there somehow some time or other. I had a nice {{business}} to get here at <b>all,</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{divorce was}} {{finalized}} in July 2014. Regarding his ex-wife's new memoirs, Dragon stated [...] "No, I haven't read it." [...] In {{an exclusive interview}} with Radar in his Arizona home on March 17, 2016, Dragon, responding to the book by his ex-wife, would comment only [...] "I was drugged (at the time of his divorce), that's <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] {{said the}} good-natured nun; [...] "surely you shall hear <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about it; but--" [...] she hesitated timidly, [...] "but I must ask the Mother Superior's leave first." ...|$|E
60|$|THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. Nothing {{seems to}} make sense here. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{is that she was}} the most impenetrably stupid woman I have ever met in the whole course of my life.|$|E
60|$|THE LADY. I {{never read}} the Radical papers. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> {{is that what}} we women admire in you is not the politician, but the man of action, the heroic warrior, the beau sabreur.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Sir James, still smiling, [...] "without prejudice, then, if I had a young sister {{forced to}} earn her living, I should {{not like to}} see her in Mrs. Vandemeyer's service. I felt it {{incumbent}} on me just to give you a hint. It is no place for a young and inexperienced girl. That is <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You pay it in," [...] said Mr. Lucas Holderness, [...] "if you've {{any doubts}} about it. Pay it in. I don't know the man or what he is. He may be a swindler for <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell.</b> <b>I</b> can't answer for him. Pay it in and see. Leave the change till then. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> wait. I'll call round in a few days' time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Had I {{come on the}} {{previous}} day, and had I been able then to <b>tell</b> her <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> her now, would it have made no difference?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know, but {{the natives}} call him Dario, {{and say that}} he is young, and has fair hair, and that she is in love with him. That's <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about the man." ...|$|E
6000|$|BURGE-LUBIN. You {{can do as}} you please. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> is that I don't {{believe your}} eyes if they cant see any {{difference}} between a live archbishop and two dead ones. [The apparatus rings, he holds the button down]. Yes? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't help that," [...] he said. [...] "I am with you, as I {{have always}} been, {{but there are}} affairs of mine I can't have anybody inquiring into. That is <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you.</b> You {{will have to take}} me on trust." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It came {{addressed}} in your hand," [...] replied Julia; [...] "we had nearly {{to pull the}} house down to get it in, that is <b>all</b> that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know that}} we are in {{possession}} of the village for the present," [...] retorted Captain Arnault, [...] "and I know no more. Here are the papers of the enemy." [...] He held them up and shook them impatiently as he spoke. [...] "They give me no information that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> rely on. For <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> to the contrary, {{the main body of the}} Germans, outnumbering us ten to one, may be nearer this cottage than the main body of the French. Draw your own conclusions. I have nothing more to say." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{asked me}} other things," [...] she {{answered}} calmly. [...] "So {{much of the}} truth you shall know, at any rate. I have {{pleaded not guilty to}} the material action of drawing that cord around the worthless neck of the man whom you knew as Morris Barnes. I plead guilty to knowing why he was murdered, even if I do not know the actual person who committed the deed, and I admit that I was in his rooms for the purpose of robbery. That is <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{first and}} {{afterwards}} elsewhere, {{but that is}} <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> now. The horses are ready, {{and there is not}} a moment to lose. We must get as far on our way as possible before nightfall, for the matter is an urgent one." ...|$|E
6000|$|Again I find {{my letter}} {{so long that}} I must cut it off now and go on [...] again to-night. So this must go as it stands. I shall not cause you [...] to wait to hear <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about our new home.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, written you or something, I suppose!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Trust an Englishman for bungling a love affair. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> is {{that she}} left Dorset House in a hansom without the others, and said some thing about having supper with some friends." ...|$|E
5000|$|In November 2010, it was {{reported}} that Peter would leave EastEnders {{at the end of the}} year, with a possible, yet unconfirmed, return for 2011. In storylines, Peter is accused of pushing Glenda Mitchell down her stairs. Law felt that Peter would not be strong enough to do it and it would not be in his character, though he feels backed into a corner. Peter made his final appearance on 24 December 2010. When asked if he could return, Law said, [...] "I don't know. They're leaving the door open. That's <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I know nothing, Philip. <b>All</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell</b> is that, as I {{have read}} that dogs and cattle scent an {{earthquake}} in the air, so man and {{women seem to}} breathe a sense of danger in this city. And to me the graciousness with which the Huguenots have been of late treated wears a strangely suspicious air. Sudden and secret is the blow like to be, and we cannot be too much on our guard. Therefore remember, my young friends both, that your danger or death would fall heavily on those ye love and honour at home.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{knew where}} it was put, sir," [...] I said, [...] "to begin with. Samuel, the footman, knew also--for he was present in the hall, when {{they were talking about}} where the Diamond was to be kept that night. My {{daughter}} knew, as she has already told you. She or Samuel may have mentioned the thing to the other servants--or the other servants may have heard the talk for themselves, through the side-door of the hall, which might have been open to the back staircase. For <b>all</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>tell,</b> everybody in the house may have known where the jewel was, last night." ...|$|R
