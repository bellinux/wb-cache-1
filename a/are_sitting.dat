5|$|A PPF (production {{possibility}} frontier) typically {{takes the}} form of the curve illustrated above. An economy that is operating on the PPF is said to be efficient, meaning that {{it would be impossible to}} produce more of one good without decreasing production of the other good. In contrast, if the economy is operating below the curve, it is said to be operating inefficiently because it could reallocate resources in order to produce more of both goods or some resources such as labor or capital <b>are</b> <b>sitting</b> idle and could be fully employed to produce more of both goods.|$|E

At the hall, large fires are kindled in long hearths running {{the length of the}} hall, while {{in the middle of the}} hall stands the great tree Barnstokkr. That evening, while those attending the feast <b>are</b> <b>sitting</b> by the flaming hearths, they are visited by a one-eyed, very tall man whom they do not recognize. The stranger is wearing a hooded, mottled cape, linen breeches tied around his legs, and is barefooted. Sword in hand, the man walks towards Barnstokkr and his hood hangs low over his head, gray with age. The man brandishes the sword and thrusts it into the trunk of the tree, and the blade sinks to its hilt. Words of welcome fail the crowd.|$|E
5|$|One day, Rachmat hears {{screaming}} and finds Atikah, who has fainted after seeing a snake. After she regains consciousness, Atikah thanks him for rescuing her.

5|$|The video cuts {{between two}} narratives. In the first, a hunter (uncredited actor) straps a 16-gauge shotgun around his shoulder, and tracks {{footsteps}} through the snow, eventually finding the Swamplord (the band's mascot, here as depicted {{on the covers}} of The Black Waltz and For the Revolution). In the second narrative, the band members, dressed warmly in heavy clothing, <b>are</b> <b>sitting</b> around a campfire, preparing a kettle of an unknown drink. As each person takes a sip, they begin convulsing. To simulate the drink's effects, the camera used shaking and rapid zooming. As the song finishes, Pekka pours himself a drink and is the only one immune to its effects.|$|E
5|$|Victorious Boxers {{does not}} use a damage or life meter. Instead, visible damage {{can be seen on}} a boxer's face, which is most {{noticeable}} between rounds when the characters <b>are</b> <b>sitting</b> in their corners. The amount of damage taken is reflected by bruises, swelling, and black eyes on the characters' faces. Another sign of damage is the characters' speed of movement throughout the fight. The characters begin to move slower and the controls become less responsive to simulate fatigue. The more a boxer is hit or uses special moves, the more their stamina is affected. Distance is a factor in determining a punch's damage. For example, a jab thrown while next to an opponent will not do as much damage as it would at arms length. Also, right hooks do not do as much damage if the character is positioned to the opponent's left and vice versa.|$|E

25|$|An {{automobile}} simulator {{provides an}} opportunity to reproduce the characteristics of real vehicles in a virtual environment. It replicates the external factors and conditions with which a vehicle interacts enabling a driver {{to feel as if}} they <b>are</b> <b>sitting</b> in the cab of their own vehicle.

Robot and Tom Servo, two of the show's main (and most iconic) characters, are puppets constructed from random household items.|$|E

25|$|The {{official}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} P. R. Brown, and released on November 7, 2016.

In {{the beginning of the}} video, Armstrong is shown as a solitary figure; his bandmates Mike Dirnt and Tre Cool <b>are</b> <b>sitting</b> lethargically in a different location. The video explores situations of various other characters as well, all starting out in a dejected state. The shots of Armstrong, Dirnt, and Cool are repeatedly seen interspersed with developments {{in the lives of the}} other characters. Eventually, all of them manage to find things that make them happy. As the video reaches its end, Armstrong is seen entering a warehouse and being happily reunited with his bandmates, who had begun to play their instruments.|$|E
25|$|The {{fountain}} {{consists of}} three bronze figures of mythological Tritons holding up a platter. Two of the Tritons <b>are</b> <b>sitting,</b> while the third one is kneeling, and they are balanced on a seaweed base. The face of each Triton is visible when viewed from City Gate. Their posture gives a sense of strength as well as spiral movement, which contribute to the monumentality of the fountain. The water jets were also designed in order to convey the sense of movement. The figures of the Tritons represent Malta's links with the sea, and their design {{was inspired by the}} Fontana delle Tartarughe in Rome. After the fountain's platter was damaged in the 1980s, a bronze pillar depicting a flight of seagulls was added to the fountain to support its weight. This will not be included once the current restoration is complete.|$|E
