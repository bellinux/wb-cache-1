5|$|Males {{make two}} calls that are {{directed}} at females, sometimes {{as a prelude}} to mating. One is a sequence of short squeaks; the other is made up of consecutive ah notes with 0.1 second between each note. These calls can be brief or last up to several minutes. Nestlings make a noisy grating begging call when seeking or expecting food. An adult female may <b>also</b> <b>make</b> the call while incubating the eggs. Immature birds <b>also</b> <b>make</b> a grating call not associated with begging that parents ignore.|$|E
5|$|The usual call is {{an eerie}} high-pitched wailing contact call, kee-ow... kee-ow... kee-ow, made while flying or roosting, {{and can be}} heard from afar. Birds may <b>also</b> <b>make</b> a harsh {{screeching}} alarm call. They <b>also</b> <b>make</b> a soft, chuckling call when searching for cossid moth larvae. Adults are normally quiet when feeding, while juveniles make frequent noisy begging calls. The superb lyrebird can mimic the adult yellow-tailed black cockatoo's contact call with some success.|$|E
5|$|Cavaliers {{are active}} and sporting. Cavaliers are {{successful}} in conformation shows, obedience and agility and they <b>also</b> <b>make</b> wonderful therapy dogs due to their sweet, gentle natures. The breed is adaptable in their need for exercise, happy with either sleeping on the couch or taking long walks.|$|E

Some species of ant are {{able to use the}} Earth's magnetic field for navigation. The compound eyes of ants have specialised cells that detect polarised light from the Sun, which is used to determine direction.|$|E
5|$|The Council may <b>also</b> <b>make</b> {{a report}} on any written law in force on 9 January 1970, {{but there is no}} {{constitutional}} provision that requires Parliament or the relevant Minister to act on it.|$|E
5|$|The F-20 would <b>also</b> <b>make</b> greater {{usage of}} {{composite}} materials in its construction. During its development, several areas using metal were re-designed to use fiberglass, {{and there were}} numerous upgrades to various mechanical parts.|$|E

5|$|The {{characters}} in Speed Buggy {{would also be}} featured in a 1973 Milton Bradley board game, where players would race Speed Buggy and other buggies in a fictionalized version of Baja California. Speedy would <b>also</b> <b>make</b> cameo appearances in later cartoons, including Johnny Bravo, My Life as a Teenage Robot, Invader Zim, Animaniacs, South Park, and Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law.|$|E
5|$|The episode's {{title is}} taken from the angels' song to the shepherds in Luke 2:14, announcing the birth of Jesus, and is in {{reference}} to the show's Christmas theme. The words <b>also</b> <b>make</b> up the beginning of the Great Doxology: Gloria in Excelsis Deo (Glory to God in the highest).|$|E
5|$|The green rosella has a {{repeated}} two-syllable contact call, {{which has been}} written as kussik kussik or cossack cossack and is heard in flight. When perched, it utters a rising kwik-kweek kwik-kweek contact call. Birds <b>also</b> <b>make</b> a chattering call during courtship. They can screech shrilly when alarmed.|$|E

5|$|Type I are {{squamous}} {{epithelial cells}} {{that make up}} the alveolar wall structure. They have extremely thin walls that enable an easy gas exchange. These type I cells <b>also</b> <b>make</b> up the alveolar septa which separate each alveolus. The septa consist of an epithelial lining and associated basement membranes. Type I cells are not able to divide, and consequently rely on differentiation from Type II cells.|$|E
5|$|A {{continuous}} map between two topological spaces induces a group homomorphism between the associated homotopy groups. In particular, if the map is a continuous bijection (a homeomorphism), {{so that the}} two spaces have the same topology, then their i-th homotopy groups are isomorphic for all i. However, the real plane has exactly the same homotopy groups as a solitary point (as does a Euclidean space of any dimension), and the real plane with a point removed has the same groups as a circle, so groups alone are not enough to distinguish spaces. Although the loss of discrimination power is unfortunate, it can <b>also</b> <b>make</b> certain computations easier.|$|E
5|$|Around 1830, Providence had {{manufacturing}} {{industries in}} metals, machinery, textiles, jewelry, and silverware. Manufacturing has declined since, {{but the city}} {{is still one of}} the largest centers for jewelry and silverware design and manufacturing. Services <b>also</b> <b>make</b> up a large portion of the city's economy, in particular education, healthcare, and finance. Providence also is the site of a sectional center facility (SCF), a regional hub for the U.S. Postal Service. It is the capital of Rhode Island, so the city's economy additionally consists of government services.|$|E

5|$|Carolina wrens {{spend the}} {{majority}} of their time on or near the ground searching for food, or in tangles of vegetation and vines. They also probe bark crevices on lower tree levels, or pick up leaf-litter in order to search for prey. Their diet consists of invertebrates, such as beetles, true bugs, grasshoppers, katydids, spiders, ants, bees, and wasps. Small lizards and tree frogs <b>also</b> <b>make</b> up the carnivorous portion of their diet. Vegetable matter makes up a small percentage of their diets, such as fruit pulp and various seeds. In the northern portion of their range, they frequent bird feeders.|$|E
5|$|Corpses {{thought to}} be vampires were {{generally}} described as having a healthier appearance than expected, plump and showing little or no signs of decomposition. In some cases, when suspected graves were opened, villagers even described the corpse as having fresh blood from a victim all over its face. Evidence that a vampire was active in a given locality included death of cattle, sheep, relatives or neighbours. Folkloric vampires could <b>also</b> <b>make</b> their presence felt by engaging in minor poltergeist-like activity, such as hurling stones on roofs or moving household objects, and pressing on people in their sleep.|$|E
