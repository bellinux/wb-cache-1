5|$|One {{piece of}} {{evidence}} for such a past resonance is Miranda's unusually high orbital inclination (4.34°) for a body {{so close to the}} planet. The largest Uranian moons may be internally differentiated, with rocky cores at their centers surrounded by ice mantles. Titania and Oberon may harbor liquid water oceans at the core/mantle boundary. The major moons of Uranus are <b>airless</b> bodies. For instance, Titania was shown to possess no atmosphere at a pressure larger than 10–20nanobar.|$|E
5|$|Among Uranus's {{five major}} moons, Ariel {{is the second}} closest to the planet, {{orbiting}} at the distance of about 190,000km. Its orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 2.5Earth days, coincident with its rotational period. This means that {{one side of the}} moon always faces the planet; a condition known as tidal lock. Ariel's orbit lies completely inside the Uranian magnetosphere. The trailing hemispheres (those facing away from their directions of orbit) of <b>airless</b> satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere like Ariel are struck by magnetospheric plasma co-rotating with the planet. This bombardment may lead to the darkening of the trailing hemispheres observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below). Ariel also captures magnetospheric charged particles, producing a pronounced dip in energetic particle count near the moon's orbit observed by Voyager 2 in 1986.|$|E
5|$|Umbriel orbits Uranus at the {{distance}} of about , being the third farthest from the planet among its five major moons. Umbriel's orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 4.1Earth days, coincident with its rotational period. In other words, Umbriel is a synchronous or tidally locked satellite, with one face always pointing toward its parent planet. Umbriel's orbit lies completely inside the Uranian magnetosphere. This is important, because the trailing hemispheres of <b>airless</b> satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere (like Umbriel) are struck by magnetospheric plasma, which co-rotates with the planet. This bombardment {{may lead to the}} darkening of the trailing hemispheres, which is actually observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below). Umbriel also serves as a sink of the magnetospheric charged particles, which creates a pronounced dip in energetic particle count near the moon's orbit as observed by Voyager 2 in 1986.|$|E
25|$|Some systems (notably the Swissmetro system) {{propose the}} use of vactrains—maglev train {{technology}} used in evacuated (<b>airless)</b> tubes, which removes air drag. This {{has the potential to}} increase speed and efficiency greatly, as most of the energy for conventional maglev trains is lost to aerodynamic drag.|$|E
25|$|For both {{solar thermal}} {{and nuclear power}} {{generation}} in <b>airless</b> environments, such as the Moon and space, {{and to a lesser}} extent the very thin Martian atmosphere, one of the main difficulties is dispersing the inevitable heat generated. This requires fairly large radiator areas.|$|E
25|$|For {{other large}} TNOs, diameters can be {{estimated}} by thermal measurements. The intensity of light illuminating the object is known (from its distance to the Sun), and one assumes that most of its surface is in thermal equilibrium (usually not a bad assumption for an <b>airless</b> body).|$|E
25|$|The overall albedo of the Moon is {{measured}} {{to be around}} 0.136, but it is strongly directional and non-Lambertian, displaying also a strong opposition effect. Although such reflectance properties {{are different from those}} of any terrestrial terrains, they are typical of the regolith surfaces of <b>airless</b> Solar System bodies.|$|E
25|$|As more {{immigrants}} came, {{both the}} houses and individual rooms were subdivided into a tiny dark <b>airless</b> cubicle holes. Many house designed for only a single family would end up with ten or more families living in them. There was little or no privacy or sunlight, with poor or absent sanitation and little room to cook or prepare and eat food.|$|E
25|$|Lightcurve {{analysis}} {{indicates a}} somewhat angular shape and that Iris's pole points towards the ecliptic coordinates (β, λ) = (10°, 20°) with a 10° uncertainty. This gives an axial tilt of 85°, so that on almost a whole hemisphere of Iris, the sun does not set during summer, {{and does not}} rise during winter. On an <b>airless</b> body this gives rise to very large temperature differences.|$|E
25|$|Rescuers {{entering}} the mine {{after the explosion}} found themselves suffocating on the afterdamp gas and {{had to return to}} the surface, often unconscious, carried by other rescuers, however the determination was such to find the bodies, and to find any survivors, that the rescuers – mostly miners from nearby mines – would insist on returning to the <b>airless</b> mine as soon as they had been revived on the surface.|$|E
25|$|During these years, {{the castle}} {{also served as}} a notorious prison. The castle's bottle dungeon is a dank and <b>airless</b> pit cut out of solid rock below the north-west tower. It housed local miscreants who fell under the Bishop's {{jurisdiction}} as well as several more prominent individuals such as David Stuart, Duke of Rothesay in 1402, Duke Murdoch in 1425, and Archbishop Patrick Graham, who was judged to be insane and imprisoned in his own castle in 1478.|$|E
25|$|That's why Pulp Fiction was so popular. Not {{because all}} audiences got all {{or any of}} its {{references}} to Scorsese and Kubrick, but because the narrative and spatial structure of the film never threatened to go beyond themselves into signification. The film's cycle of racist and homophobic jokes might threaten to break out into a quite nasty view of the world, but this nastiness keeps being laughed off— by the mock intensity of the action, the prowling, confronting, perverse, confined, and <b>airless</b> nastiness of the world Tarantino creates.|$|E
25|$|Eggleston's {{published}} {{books and}} portfolios, include Los Alamos (actually completed in 1974, before {{the publication of}} the Guide) the massive Election Eve (1976; a portfolio of photographs taken around Plains, Georgia before that year's presidential election); The Morals of Vision (1978); and Flowers (1978); Wedgwood Blue (1979); Seven (1979); Troubled Waters (1980); The Louisiana Project (1980). William Eggleston's Graceland (1984) is a series of commissioned photographs of Elvis Presley’s Graceland, depicting the singer’s home as an <b>airless,</b> windowless tomb in custom-made bad taste. Other series include The Democratic Forest (1989), Faulkner's Mississippi (1990), and Ancient and Modern (1992).|$|E
25|$|Compared {{with that}} of Earth, the Moon has only a very weak {{external}} magnetic field. Other major differences are that the Moon does not currently have a dipolar magnetic field (as would be generated by a geodynamo in its core), and the magnetizations that are present are almost entirely crustal in origin. One hypothesis holds that the crustal magnetizations were acquired early in lunar history when a geodynamo was still operating. The small size of the lunar core, however, is a potential obstacle to this hypothesis. Alternatively, {{it is possible that}} on <b>airless</b> bodies such as the Moon, transient magnetic fields could be generated during impact processes. In support of this, it has been noted that the largest crustal magnetizations appear to be located near the antipodes of the largest impact basins.|$|E
25|$|Remoni-Notra, of {{the planet}} Pandina, was chosen by the Zamarons to be their queen, an honor {{previously}} bequeathed upon Earth's Carol Ferris, but refused. Remoni-Notra was given {{one of the five}} star sapphire gems and was told of the existence of the other four. Using her powers, she came to Earth to locate and steal Carol Ferris' gem and joined the Secret Society of Super Villains as the new Star Sapphire in hopes of finding a clue to the gem. On Earth she took the name Deborah Camille Darnell and became a stewardess at Ferris Aircraft, in hopes of getting closer to Carol to take the Star Sapphire gem. As Star Sapphire, Darnell can use her gem of power to fly and to hurl blasts of force nearly equal to the power of a Green Lantern's ring. Moreover, the Sapphire bestows upon her a certain amount of invulnerability and allows her to survive in <b>airless</b> space.|$|E
500|$|Head VI is an oil-on-canvas {{painting}} by the Irish-born figurative artist Francis Bacon, {{the last of}} six panels making up his [...] "1949 Head" [...] series. It shows a bust view of a single figure, modeled on Diego Velázquez's Portrait of Innocent X. Bacon applies forceful, expressive brush strokes, and places the figure within a glass cage structure, behind curtain-like drapery. This gives {{the effect of a}} man trapped and suffocated by his surroundings, screaming into an <b>airless</b> void.|$|E
500|$|Opting {{to shoot}} using Mitchell cameras {{incorporating}} 35mm Eastman Kodak film and anamorphic lenses, Warren recalls that the produced footage boasted [...] "an incredibly sharp image and what I would term as the 'American' look." [...] He remembers that {{the setting of}} the Chislehurst Caves rendered the subterranean complex more realistic than a potential in-studio alternative given the modest budget of Inseminoid. However, the cold, damp, <b>airless</b> conditions, combined with the uneven surface of the cave floors, complicated the filming sessions and necessitated frequent repairs of equipment.|$|E
500|$|Little {{work was}} done on the score during 1897, which Puccini devoted mostly to {{performances}} of La bohème. The opening page of the autograph Tosca score, containing the motif that {{would be associated with}} Scarpia, is dated January 1898. At Puccini's request, Giacosa irritably provided new lyrics for the act 1 love duet. In August, Puccini removed several numbers from the opera, according to his biographer, Mary Jane Phillips-Matz, [...] "cut Tosca to the bone, leaving three strong characters trapped in an <b>airless,</b> violent, tightly wound melodrama that had little room for lyricism". At the end of the year, Puccini wrote that he was [...] "busting his balls" [...] on the opera.|$|E
500|$|Writing for The New York Times, Jon Pareles {{compared}} the album's concept to Pink Floyd's The Dark Side of the Moon (1973) and Guns N' Roses Appetite for Destruction (1987), referring {{to it as}} [...] "a cause without a rebellion." [...] However, Pareles commended its musicality and vocals, stating [...] "he tone of the music is <b>airless,</b> sealing out imprecision and reveling in crisp, machine-generated rhythms; Ms. Jackson's piping voice, layered upon itself in punchy unisons or lavish harmonies, never cracks or falters." [...] Robert Christgau wrote in his review for The Village Voice, [...] "Her voice is as unequal to her vaguely admonitory politics {{as it was to}} her declaration of sexual availability, but the music is the message." ...|$|E
500|$|Biographer David Buckley wrote, [...] "While {{the music}} {{moved away from}} Murmurs {{slightly}} <b>airless</b> feel, the subject matter was a little darker." [...] Buck noted in a 1988 interview that water imagery was abundant in the album. Buckley interpreted that imagery as representing the change presented by the band's increasing success, {{as well as the}} changing music scene of the group's Athens, Georgia hometown. The song [...] "Camera" [...] addressed the death of a friend from Athens who died in a car crash. Easter said, [...] " [...] vocal was so exposed on that track, and because of that, it could really show any technical imperfections with regard to pitch." [...] The producer tried to get Stipe to sing a better take, but the singer was more intent on getting the feeling of the song across, and at one point refused to record further. While many of the album's songs were new compositions, some had been in R.E.M.'s show setlists for years. In particular, [...] "Pretty Persuasion" [...] and [...] "(Don't Go Back to) Rockville" [...] had been played live as far back as October 1980. The band was reluctant to record [...] "Pretty Persuasion" [...] as the members considered it too old, but Dixon and Easter convinced the group to do so. R.E.M. originally intended to release [...] "(Don't Go Back to) Rockville" [...] as a non-album single between Reckoning and its next release. When the band recorded it for the album, the group rearranged the song from its live incarnation and gave it a country music feel in tribute to its lawyer Bertis Downs, IV, who was a country fan.|$|E
2500|$|Mercury (...) is {{the ruling}} planet of Gemini and is exalted in Virgo and/or Aquarius. In Roman mythology, Mercury is the {{messenger}} of the gods, noted for his speed and swiftness. Echoing this, the scorching, <b>airless</b> world Mercury circles the Sun on the fastest orbit of any planet. Mercury takes only 88 days to orbit the Sun, spending about 7.33 days in each {{sign of the}} zodiac. Mercury {{is so close to}} the Sun that only a brief period exists after the Sun has set where it can be seen with the naked eye, before following the Sun beyond the horizon.|$|E
2500|$|The Apollo program {{collected}} [...] of Moon rocks {{during the}} six manned missions. Analyses by scientists worldwide {{all agree that}} these rocks came from the Moon – no published accounts in peer-reviewed scientific journals exist that dispute this claim. The Apollo samples are easily distinguishable from both meteorites and Earth rocks in that they show a lack of hydrous alteration products, they show evidence of having undergone impact events on an <b>airless</b> body, and they have unique geochemical traits. Furthermore, most are more than 200 million years older than the oldest Earth rocks. The Moon rocks also share the same traits as Soviet samples.|$|E
2500|$|Across {{northern}} Europe, butter {{was sometimes}} {{treated in a}} manner unheard-of today: it was packed into barrels (...) and buried in peat bogs, perhaps for years. Such [...] "bog butter" [...] would develop a strong flavor as it aged, but remain edible, {{in large part because}} of the unique cool, <b>airless,</b> antiseptic and acidic environment of a peat bog. Firkins of such buried butter are a common archaeological find in Ireland; the National Museum of Ireland – Archaeology has some containing [...] "a grayish cheese-like substance, partially hardened, not much like butter, and quite free from putrefaction." [...] The practice was most common in Ireland in the 11th–14th centuries; it ended entirely before the 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|The {{outline of}} the {{original}} Hyperloop concept was made public in August 2013 by {{the release of a}} preliminary—or alpha level—design document by Elon Musk, with substantial design assistance from an informal group of engineers at both Tesla Motors and SpaceX who worked on the conceptual foundation and modelling of Hyperloop. The preliminary design called for a [...] steel tube, operating in partial vacuum (nearly <b>airless),</b> utilizing pressurized vehicle [...] "pods" [...] to carry passengers or cargo that would ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors. The alpha design included a notional route running from the Los Angeles region to the San Francisco Bay Area, paralleling the Interstate 5 corridor for most of its length, so that preliminary economic analysis might be done on the concept.|$|E
2500|$|Eventually, it {{was decided}} to {{standardise}} on a colour which became known as Rail Blue. Introduced in 1965, and also known as [...] "Monastral Blue", the colour was defined by British Standards BR28/6001 (<b>Airless</b> spray finish) and BR28/5321 (Brush finish). [...] It was a dark, greyish blue tone which hid the effects of dirt well. The colour often appears inaccurately in photographs, generally appearing brighter and bluer than the real colour. In the early years the colour faded quite badly, becoming lighter and paler with time although this problem had been overcome by the late 1970s. United Kingdom paint code RAL5020 ("Ocean Blue") is a good match to Rail Blue. There is also a British Standard paint colour BS381C 114 called Rail Blue which was introduced in 1964. The new British Rail [...] "double arrow" [...] symbol on locomotives (or leading vehicle as was the case on multiple unit stock) and the vehicle number and other ancillary markings written in the Rail Alphabet typeface were other integral parts of the livery.|$|E
2500|$|... "The Pit and the Pendulum" [...] is a {{study of}} the effect terror has on the narrator, {{starting}} with the opening line, which suggests that he is already suffering from death anxiety ("I was sick — sick unto death with that long agony"). However, there is an implicit irony in the reference to the black-robed judges having lips [...] "whiter than the sheet upon which I trace these words," [...] which shows that he has survived and is writing the story after the events. Unlike much of Poe's work, the story has no supernatural elements. The [...] "realism" [...] of the story is enhanced through Poe's focus on reporting : the dungeon is <b>airless</b> and unlit, the narrator is subject to thirst and starvation, he is swarmed by rats, the razor-sharp pendulum threatens to slice into him and the closing walls are red-hot. The narrator experiences the blade mostly through sound as it [...] "hissed" [...] while swinging. Poe emphasizes this element of sound with such words as [...] "surcingle," [...] "cessation," [...] "crescent," [...] and [...] "scimitar", and various forms of literary consonance.|$|E
2500|$|Belfast in {{the early}} 20th-century was a flourishing centre of {{industry}} with shipbuilding, engineering and linen-manufacturing the main sources of the city's economic lifeblood. Its skilled workforce of shipyard workers and engineers earned wages and enjoyed working conditions comparable {{with the rest of}} the United Kingdom. Additionally, they enjoyed the security of trade union membership. For the unskilled workers, such as dock labourers and carters, it was a completely different story. They worked up to 75 hours a week in conditions which were dangerous and unsanitary, without holidays. The pay was low and employment was erratic and uncertain. Unlike the skilled workers, these labourers had no trade union to look after their interests. The men who worked in the docks lived in Sailortown, a community adjacent to the Docks which had a population of 5,000, excluding the transient sailors [...] who swelled the numbers. This mixed Protestant and Catholic populace was packed into tiny streets of red-bricked terraced houses that were built between the docks and York Street. They were damp, <b>airless,</b> overcrowded and poorly lit. Poverty, hunger and disease was rife. Women and children were compelled to work long, arduous hours in the linen mills and cigarette factories. Most families in Sailortown had men who were merchant seamen; with boys as young as 14 going off to sea. The other men obtained unskilled work on the waterfront as dockers, carters and coal heavers.|$|E
2500|$|Monáe's {{signature}} {{style is}} her tuxedo wardrobe. [...] She said [...] "I bathe in it, I swim in it, and I could {{be buried in}} it. A tux is such a standard uniform, it's so classy and it's a lifestyle I enjoy. The tux keeps me balanced. I look at myself as a canvas. I don't want to cloud myself with too many colors or I'll go crazy. It's an experiment I'm doing. I think I {{want to be in}} the Guinness Book of World Records." [...] Monáe's signature look harkens back to dandyism. Citing Grace Jones and Josephine Baker as role models, Monáe takes the classical 18th century look in the classical white and black pattern. Monáe's signature look can also be attributed to the early days in her career when she was employed as a maid as she revealed in her 2012 Black Girls Rock! Young, Gifted, and Black award acceptance speech. Monáe has been known to distribute her Ten Droid Commandments which encourages her fans to be individuals. The Telegraph also commented on her image as an artist saying [...] "Sitting in a grey, <b>airless</b> record company office, this slight, stiff young woman delivers her speech in slow, deliberate tones, utterly expressionless. Dressed in her trademark starched shirt and tuxedo, hair immaculately coiffed, Monáe's face is an opaque mask of perfection: all silken smooth skin, button nose and glassy brown eyes." [...] She has described her tuxedos as being a uniform for her career. She also featured in the [...] "Style 100" [...] of InStyle magazine.|$|E
2500|$|While {{calculations}} of days, {{months and years}} are based on fixed hours equal to 1/24 of a day, {{the beginning of each}} halachic day is based on the local time of sunset. The end of the Shabbat and other Jewish holidays is based on nightfall (Tzeth haKochabim) which occurs some amount of time, typically 42 to 72 minutes, after sunset. According to Maimonides, nightfall occurs when three medium-sized stars become visible after sunset. By the 17th century, this had become three-second-magnitude stars. The modern definition is when the center of the sun is 7° below the geometric (<b>airless)</b> horizon, somewhat later than civil twilight at 6°. The beginning of the daytime portion of each day is determined both by dawn and sunrise. Most halachic times are based on some combination of these four times and vary from day to day throughout the year and also vary significantly depending on location. The daytime hours are often divided into Sha'oth Zemaniyoth or [...] "Halachic hours" [...] by taking the time between sunrise and sunset or between dawn and nightfall and dividing it into 12 equal hours. The nighttime hours are similarly divided into 12 equal portions, albeit a different amount of time than the [...] "hours" [...] of the daytime. The earliest and latest times for Jewish services, the latest time to eat chametz on the day before Passover and many other rules are based on Sha'oth Zemaniyoth. For convenience, the modern day using Sha'oth Zemaniyoth is often discussed as if sunset were at 6:00pm, sunrise at 6:00am and each hour were equal to a fixed hour. For example, halachic noon may be after 1:00pm in some areas during daylight saving time. Within the Mishnah, however, the numbering of the hours starts with the [...] "first" [...] hour after the start of the day.|$|E
