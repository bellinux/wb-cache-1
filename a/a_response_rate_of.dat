25|$|A non-representative {{survey on}} the sexual {{behaviour}} of American students published in 1997 and based on questionnaires had <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> about 8â€“9%. Its results showed 15% of homosexual and bisexual males, 21% of lesbian and female bisexual students, 11% of heterosexual males and 9% of female heterosexual students committed to BDSM related fantasies. In all groups the level of practical BDSM experiences were around 6%. Within the group of openly lesbian and bisexual females the quote was significantly higher, at 21%. Independent of their sexual orientation, about 12% of all questioned students, 16% of lesbians and female bisexuals and 8% of heterosexual males articulated an interest in spanking. Experience with this sexual behaviour was indicated by 30% of male heterosexuals, 33% of female bisexuals and lesbians, and 24% of the male gay and bisexual men and female heterosexual women. Even though this study was not considered representative, other surveys indicate similar dimensions in a differing target groups.|$|E

40|$|Caspofungin, {{the main}} {{representative}} of the echinocandin family has undergone a clinical experience that covers gradually the whole spectrum of the standard care of invasive aspergillosis (IA). Caspofungin salvage therapy in cases of previous therapy refractoriness or intolerance resulted in <b>a</b> 45 % <b>response</b> <b>rate.</b> Empiric therapy with caspofungin compared with L-AMB in neutropenic patients with persisting fever showed <b>an</b> overall <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> approximately 34 %, with less toxicity for caspofungin. Combination therapy of caspofungin with other antifungal drugs has been studied mainly retrospectively in open non randomized trials and in one prospective non comparative small study showing <b>an</b> encouraging <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> 55 % as salvage combined treatment. The clinical experience with caspofungin as first-line therapy in IA is limited to 32 patients with <b>an</b> overall <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> 56 %.

50|$|Although {{presence}} of the wild-type (or normal) KRAS gene does not guarantee that these drugs will work, a number of large {{studies have shown that}} cetuximab has significant efficacy in mCRC patients with KRAS wild-type tumors. In the Phase III CRYSTAL study, published in 2009, patients with the wild-type KRAS gene treated with Erbitux plus chemotherapy showed <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> up to 59% compared to those treated with chemotherapy alone. Patients with the KRAS wild-type gene also showed a 32% decreased risk of disease progression compared to patients receiving chemotherapy alone.|$|E
50|$|Studies have {{indicated}} that detection of KRAS gene mutations helps physicians identify patients that are unlikely to respond to treatment with targeted EGFR inhibitors, including cetuximab and panitumumab. Accordingly, genetic testing to confirm the absence of KRAS mutations (and so {{the presence of the}} KRAS wild-type gene), is now clinically routine before the start of treatment with EGFR inhibitors. mCRC patients with wild-type KRAS tumors have been shown to benefit from <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> over 60% and a decreased risk for progression of over 40% when treated with Erbitux as 1st-line therapy.

Of the 3,709 reported calls dealing with rape and attempted rape received by the 16 centers, 12 calls dealt with marital rape (0.3%).

50|$|T. suis ova therapy {{may produce}} {{significant}} and long lasting improvements in active Crohn's disease. In {{a study conducted}} at the University of Iowa, patients who had been administered with T. suis ova for 24 weeks had <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> nearly 80% and a remission rate of nearly 73%. Crohn's disease involves over reactive Th1 pathways and colonization with parasitic worms expands several immunoregulatory pathways that limit Th1-type inflammation. Parasitic worms generate production of interleukin 4 and interleukin 13, which are Th2 cytokines. This Th2 response restrains production of Th1 cytokines thereby reducing colitis severity. Parasitic worms also generate regulatory T cells and immune regulatory substances such as transforming growth factor Î², interleukin 10, and prostaglandin E2 that assist in sustaining host mucosal homeostasis.|$|E

50|$|The {{concern about}} these {{proposals}} caused {{a number of}} organizations to come together {{under the umbrella of}} the Mental Health Alliance to campaign in support of the protection of patientsâ€™ and carersâ€™ rights, and to minimise coercion. CPN joined the Allianceâ€™s campaign, but resigned in 2005 {{when it became clear that}} the Alliance would accept those aspects of the House of Commons Scrutiny Committeeâ€™s report that would result in the introduction of CTOs. Psychiatrists not identified with CPN shared the Networkâ€™s concern about the more coercive aspects of the governmentâ€™s proposals, so CPN carried out a questionnaire survey of over two and a half thousand (2,500) consultant psychiatrists working in England seeking their views of the proposed changes. The responses (<b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> 46%) indicated widespread concern in the profession about reviewable detention and CTOs.|$|E

5000|$|Currently, {{there has}} been little {{research}} and evaluation on the post-implementation of commercial electronic medical records (EMR). MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland, OH, has published an evaluation of the EpicCare EMR by Epic Systems five years after implementation. MetroHealthâ€™s methods included a web-based survey for primary care providers to measure their level of utilization of the EpicCare EMR. The physicians surveyed were those in the internal medicine, family medicine, and the pediatric units of the hospital. Prior to the survey, physicians were given eight hours of training by consultants on how to navigate the EMR system. The survey subsequently taken showed <b>a</b> <b>response</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> 35% or 59 of 154 providers. Questions included whether providers have a computer at home, whether they access EpicCare from home, and their level of expertise on using a computer.
