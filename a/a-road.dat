5|$|The road's name, {{along with}} the area, {{is derived from the}} {{original}} 14th century White Chapel. It follows the section of the Roman road between Londinium (London) and Camulodunum (Colchester), which connected to the Pye Road to Venta Icenorum (Caistor St Edmund near Norwich). The section of the Roman road that is now Whitechapel Road is a Primary <b>A-road,</b> the A11, and has bus lanes running along its length. Owing to the popularity of the market, parking is heavily restricted, limited to occasional parking metered spaces along the road.|$|E
25|$|Kennington Lane is an <b>A-road</b> (classified A3204) running {{between the}} Elephant & Castle {{to the east}} and Vauxhall to the west.|$|E
25|$|There are {{numerous}} junctions {{along the route}} of the A59, including motorway and other <b>A-road</b> junctions. Major junctions and landmarks are listed below.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{the other}} single digit <b>A-roads</b> in Great Britain, the A2 does not form a zone {{boundary}} (in this case between Zone 1 and Zone 2). The Zone 1/2 boundary is the River Thames.|$|R
5000|$|The {{village has}} {{a network of}} minor roads which are not heavily developed, for which reason it is {{described}} by the Victoria County History as [...] "it in a peaceful area of the county {{that has always been}} tucked away" [...] and has no <b>A-roads.</b>|$|R
50|$|The A374 is a {{main road}} in the United Kingdom, one of six <b>A-roads</b> making the border {{crossing}} between Devon and Cornwall. It is the most southerly of the A37x group of roads, starting and ending its journey with the A38 trunk road, from the outskirts of Plymouth in Devon to the Trerulefoot roundabout in Cornwall.|$|R
25|$|Parts of the route, at the {{northern}} end between Hackney Wick and Old Ford {{and south of the}} river between the Blackwall Tunnel and the Sun-in-the-Sands interchange, were previously classified as urban motorways and given the designation A102(M). The status was downgraded to a standard <b>A-road</b> in 2000 when responsibility for trunk roads in Greater London was transferred from the Highways Agency to the Greater London Authority.|$|E
25|$|The A9 is a {{major road}} running from the Falkirk council area in central Scotland to Scrabster Harbour, Thurso in the far north, via Stirling, Bridge of Allan, Perth and Inverness. At 273 miles (439km), it is the longest road in Scotland and the fifth-longest <b>A-road</b> in the United Kingdom. Historically it was the main road between Edinburgh and John o' Groats, and {{has been called the}} spine of Scotland.|$|E
500|$|The A215 was Britain's most crash-prone <b>A-road</b> between 1999-2010, {{having had}} 2,836 crashes over its 10 mile length.|$|E
50|$|Roads in Northern Ireland are {{classified}} as either Highways, motorways (shown by the letter M followed by a route number, e.g. M1), <b>A-roads</b> (shown by the letter A followed by a route number, e.g. A6), B-roads (shown by the letter B followed by a route number, e.g. B135) and other roads. There {{are two types of}} A-roads: primary and non-primary.|$|R
50|$|Two <b>A-roads</b> connect Southend with London and {{the rest}} of the country, the A127 (The Southend Arterial Road), via Basildon and Romford, and the A13, via Tilbury and London Docklands. Both are major routes, however, within the borough, the A13 is a single {{carriageway}} local route, whereas the A127 is entirely dual carriageway. Both connect to the M25 and eventually London.|$|R
25|$|Regionwide the {{principal}} road link is the M6, this enters the region (from Scotland) near Carlisle {{in the north}} and leaves it (for the English Midlands) near Crewe in the south. It connects such towns and cities as Penrith, Kendal, Lancaster, Preston, Warrington, Liverpool and Manchester. The M6 intersects many of the North West's motorways and <b>A-roads,</b> and carries almost 120,000 vehicles per day (41,975,000 per year).|$|R
500|$|At , the A82 is {{the second}} longest <b>A-road</b> in Scotland, after the A9, and has been {{described}} as the [...] "slower but more scenic route" [...] of the two. Initial sections of the road were built by General George Wade from 1724 onwards, though much of the current route was constructed by Thomas Telford in the 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|Edinburgh {{itself is}} {{the hub of the}} <b>A-road</b> {{numbering}} system within Scotland, and many radial routes lead {{in and out of the}} city. [...] Routes radiating from Edinburgh are as follows (in a clockwise direction): ...|$|E
2500|$|Sutton is centred [...] west of {{the town}} centre of Carshalton, its east-west central street can be {{considered}} a continuation of Carshalton's own main street, an almost straight <b>A-road</b> route to Orpington via Croydon, beginning in Ewell.|$|E
5000|$|Hersham is {{connected}} to London via the A3. The A3 also connects the village to Guildford, and Portsmouth, which gives rise to its main pseudonym, [...] "the Portsmouth Road". The M25 Junction 10 is 4 miles away and an <b>A-roads</b> and dual carriageway connect neighbouring (but not contiguous) Esher and Cobham and the almost bordering town of Weybridge, across a narrow strip of Walton on Thames.|$|R
50|$|The M25 {{motorway}} passes, without junctions {{for more}} than 3 miles, through {{the west of the}} village. The main north-south road, the A318 road in New Haw is one of few <b>A-roads</b> in the South East to have narrow sections for HGVs at the bridge crossing the Wey Navigation and with a sharp bend on the turn-off for Woodham. The route also has fixed and mobile speed cameras.|$|R
50|$|The Cotswolds lie {{between the}} M5, M40 and M4 motorways. The main <b>A-roads</b> {{through the area}} are the A46: Bath - Stroud - Cheltenham; the A419: Swindon - Cirencester - Stroud; the A429: Cirencester - Stow-on-the-Wold - Moreton-in-Marsh; and the A40: Oxford - Burford - Cheltenham. These all roughly follow the routes of ancient roads, some laid down by the Romans, such as Ermin Way and the Fosse Way.|$|R
2500|$|With the {{introduction}} of motorways in the late 1950s, a new classification M was introduced. In many cases the motorways duplicated existing stretches of <b>A-road,</b> which therefore lost much of their significance and were in some cases renumbered. There was no consistent approach to this renumbering â€“ some retained their existing number as non-primary A roads (e.g. the A40 running alongside the M40), others were given [...] "less significant" [...] numbers (e.g. the A34 in Warwickshire became the A3400 after the M40 was built) and the remainder were downgraded to B or unclassified roads (e.g. the A38, which {{has been replaced by}} the M5 between Tiverton and Exeter). Occasionally the new motorway would take the name of the old <b>A-road</b> rather than having its own number. The most notable example of this is the A1(M).|$|E
2500|$|Motorways {{first came}} to Britain over three decades after {{the advent of the}} <b>A-road</b> {{numbering}} event, and as a result required a new numbering system. They were given an M prefix, and in England and Wales a numbering system of their own not coterminous with that of the <b>A-road</b> network, though based on the same principle of zones. Running clockwise from the M1 the zones were defined for Zones 1 to 4 based on the proposed M2, M3 and M4 motorways. The M5 and M6 numbers were reserved for the other two planned long distance motorways. The Preston Bypass, the UK's first motorway section, should have been numbered A6(M) under the scheme decided upon, but it was decided to keep the number M6 as had already been applied. [...] The first full length motorway in the UK was the M1 motorway.|$|E
2500|$|Ilfracombe {{is at the}} {{southern}} end of the A361, the longest 3-digit <b>A-road</b> in England. The A361 finishes on the A5 at Kilsby on the Northamptonshire-Warwickshire border near Rugby. This road is the town's main connection with the South West England motorway, the M5, Golden Coast Amusements, 14-18 Belgrave Promenade, Wilder Road, Ilfracombe in 1999 and ...|$|E
50|$|The chain {{expanded}} rapidly {{throughout the}} 1970s and 1980s, largely organically, although in 1986 it acquired Happy Eater, its only major roadside competitor. It peaked in numbers in 1999 - 2000 with 439 restaurants, but restructuring has seen this reduced to 71. The Little Chef brand {{has been in}} decline for many years, largely {{due to a lack}} of investment, increased competition, and predominant use of motorways rather than <b>A-roads</b> for long-distance journeys.|$|R
5000|$|Station Road joins into {{surrounding}} <b>A-roads</b> in all directions, including non-principal [...] "Brighton Road" [...] {{which has}} since become superseded by the motorway network and other north-south roads, the A319 that links in towards routes to Berkshire and the A320 road that is convenient for closer areas of Thames Valley corridor, and the A318 to Brooklands with its museum, luxury hotel and retail park and the A3 road Painshill interchange between Hersham and Cobham towards London.|$|R
40|$|In {{the area}} of Drebkau, common ragweed has been known on {{agricultural}} land since the 1970 s. The structural changes in agriculture within eastern Germany {{in the wake of}} reunification facilitate common ragweed to become established on many other agricultural fields in Lower Lusatia. It was then presumably dispersed from the fields to the roadsides by agricultural machines. In 2006 it has already built up considerable roadside populations within the region. These populations were mapped annually in a 250 km road network for the period 2008 to 2012. The analysis for this period shows a significant increase in common ragweed populations along the roadsides by 57 % and it gives evidence that road traffic intensities probably have a decisive influence on the dispersal speed of common ragweed within the road network. In particular, the busy <b>A-roads</b> and state roads have high common ragweed growth rates, while district roads and other small roads recorded growth to a lower extent. It was also observed that small initial populations along busy <b>A-roads</b> and state roads merge quickly to larger populations or expand to linear and dominance populations...|$|R
2500|$|Cranleigh {{is a large}} {{village and}} civil parish, self-proclaimed the largest in England, almost [...] {{southeast}} of Guildford in Surrey. It lies east of the A281, which links Guildford with Horsham, on an alternative route {{that is not an}} <b>A-road.</b> It is in the north-west corner of the Weald (a large remnant forest) and immediately south-east of Winterfold Forest, a remaining area of forest on the Greensand Ridge.|$|E
2500|$|The {{motorway}} {{is usually}} {{referred to as}} the M74, but south of Abington it is the A74(M), as noted on each sign save for one erroneous [...] "M74" [...] sign at Gretna Green services. As the motorway is one continuous route and has a continuous junction numbering system, its entirety is usually erroneously referred to as M74. Typically, upgraded <b>A-road</b> designations like A74(M) are retained for short bypasses of existing road, whereas the M74/A74(M) is one continuous intercity route.|$|E
2500|$|The A25 {{road that}} runs from the county of Kent to Guildford via Reigate and Dorking skirts {{the north of the}} village centre. [...] From its {{roundabout}} on the A25, less major roads provide a cut-through towards Walton-on-the-Hill, via the notoriously steep Pebble Hill, a route towards Sutton, London, the M25's Reigate Hill junction or Leatherhead and minor routes to the south connect southern villages, including Leigh, Surrey. [...] <b>A-road</b> intersections of the A25 are in Dorking (A24) and at the foot of Reigate Hill in Reigate (A217).|$|E
50|$|The B3232 skirts {{the nucleus}} of the village, the main road between Great Torrington and Barnstaple though not from the town to points east and west of Barnstaple being served by <b>A-roads.</b> Its access is a little further than as the crow files, {{particularly}} along roads leading through or around Barnstaple's western suburb and parks; it is close to the direct distance of 4 mi in the opposite direction from Great Torrington, a town with a major Conservation Area relative to its size.|$|R
25|$|The A381 road is a non-trunk 'A'-class road in Devon, England {{which serves}} as an {{important}} link between the towns of Teignmouth, Kingsteignton, Newton Abbot, Totnes and Salcombe and many villages in between, with the busiest section (in Newton Abbot) having 6 lanes and carrying an average of over 40,000 vehicles per day. The route overlaps with other <b>A-roads</b> for several sections of its length. It is a faster route from Teignmouth to Salcombe than the A379 which meets it at both ends. It is {{under the control of}} Devon County Council as highway authority.|$|R
50|$|A further {{challenge}} to Little Chef was {{the rise of}} pub restaurants which catered both for the business and family markets. Recently refurbished service stations began to offer additional choices such as Marks & Spencer Simply Food and coffee chains such as Costa in place of Little Chef outlets, which appealed to people not wanting to spend a long time over a meal. Furthermore, {{the construction of the}} motorway network meant that <b>A-roads</b> (along which Little Chef outlets were usually situated) were no longer used for long-distance travel.|$|R
2500|$|The {{existing}} A628 {{trunk road}} connects the M67 from Manchester to the M1 in South Yorkshire. [...] A single-carriageway road through {{the villages of}} Mottram in Longdendale, Hollingworth and Tintwistle and through the Peak District National Park, it is used by a relatively large number of heavy goods vehicles. [...] Supporters of the scheme say that the A628 {{is one of the}} most congested <b>A-road</b> routes in the country, with high volumes of traffic (including HGVs) using a road which is totally unsuitable for the volume and nature of traffic it carries and that there is no viable alternative to a bypass. A survey in 2010 found that the junction of the A57 and M67 was the most congested in Manchester.|$|E
50|$|<b>A-road</b> spurs do {{not follow}} a {{noticeable}} numbering system; they {{would be impossible to}} assign due to the quantity of <b>A-road</b> numbers in use.|$|E
50|$|The A309 is a {{partially}} primary status <b>A-road</b> that runs in two sections, a short section in Twickenham and Teddington as a non-primary status <b>A-road,</b> {{as well as}} the much longer second section that runs from Hampton Court to Hook.|$|E

5|$|Electric trams were {{a common}} sight in early 20th century Salford, and had from 1901 {{replaced}} the earlier horse-drawn vehicles. A network of lines crossed the region, with coordinated services running through Salford, Manchester and the surrounding areas. Many served the new suburban housing and industrial developments built at the time, but in 1947 they were withdrawn in favour of more practical servicesâ€“ buses. The city is served by a complex road infrastructure, with connections from the M602 motorway to several major motorways, and <b>A-roads</b> including the A57 Regent Road and the A6042 Trinity Way. Salford City Council has also created both advisory and mandatory cycle lanes across the city.|$|R
50|$|Three {{primary routes}} {{are within the}} district. The A127 goes through its centre, the A13 goes through the {{south-east}} at Pitsea. Both these primary routes connect the district with Greater London and Southend-on-Sea. At Bowers Gifford at a terminus of the A13's primary status there is a junction {{with the beginning of}} primary status for the A130 with runs along a small section of the western boundary of the district. The A130 connects the district with Chelmsford. The A129 is the major road link between Billericay and Wickford, which are linked via <b>A-Roads</b> to the urban area of Basildon, Pitsea and Laindon by the A176 and the A132, respectively.|$|R
