5|$|M-157 was {{originally}} designated in 1931 as a connector route between M-55 and US27 (present-day M-18). Just a year later, that version was decommissioned, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> obliterated. A new alignment, the present-day routing of M-157, was then commissioned {{just to the}} east.|$|E
5|$|A mile east of Highway 133, {{the valley}} floor widens, filled with farms and subdivisions as the road gently trends to the south. Five miles (8km) east of Carbondale, Highway 82 crosses into Eagle County. Subdivisions begin to {{increase}} in the surrounding valley <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> soon turns to the south again as it passes a built-up area and then crosses the Roaring Fork. A {{mile and a half}} after that Highway 82 crosses the Roaring Fork and then enters Pitkin County at the small unincorporated community of Emma.|$|E
5|$|A short {{distance}} past the Street Road intersection, PA 232 passes into Solebury Township and crosses the Pidcock Creek. The road continues through {{a mix of}} farms and woods with some residential areas. As the route approaches Aquetong Road, the surroundings become more forested <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> parallels Dark Hollow Run, briefly passing through farm fields. The road enters the borough of New Hope, where it terminates at a junction with Main Street (PA 32).|$|E
50|$|The type of {{existing}} <b>roads</b> in <b>the</b> municipality is <b>the</b> National <b>Roads,</b> Provincial <b>Roads</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Municipal <b>Roads.</b> <b>The</b> National <b>Roads</b> are <b>the</b> San Enrique-San Rafael <b>Road,</b> <b>the</b> San Enrique-Garita <b>Road</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> San Enrique-Dingle <b>Road,</b> <b>the</b> San Enrique-Dueñas <b>Road</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> KABASAKA <b>Road.</b> <b>The</b> Municipal <b>Roads</b> consist of Municipal Streets <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Barangay <b>Roads.</b>|$|R

5|$|A short section from Well Hall Road to Eltham Road {{had been}} {{completed}} by 1930, aside from a bridge underneath the Hither Green – Dartford railway, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> had been built as far west as Burnt Ash Hill {{by the middle of}} the decade. Sir Charles Bressey's Highway Development Survey (also known as the Bressey Report), published in 1937, showed a -long South Circular that would have a new-build section near Wandsworth Bridge (then being rebuilt) but otherwise be a series of online improvements to existing roads.|$|E
5|$|Between Randville and {{the former}} {{community}} of Metropolitan, M-69 runs along the West Branch of the Sturgeon River through more hilly terrain. The trunkline continues east to the twin communities of Theodore and Felch. The river <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> part ways until meeting again at Foster City. This is also {{the location of a}} unique junction of highways. M-69 meets G-69, a County-Designated Highway that runs south to Loretto in southern Dickinson County. The intersection in unique because some states, such as California, do not allow two highways to share a common number.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{the morning}} on 8 August the Georgian 4th Brigade from Vaziani Military Base {{advanced}} on the left flank of Tskhinvali; the 3rd Brigade advanced on the right flank. The aim of the flank operations was to advance northward after capturing key positions. The Georgian troops would take the Gupta bridge <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> to the Roki Tunnel, barring the Russian troops from moving southward.|$|E

5|$|In 1924 Derbyshire County Council spent £2,000 {{installing}} underground {{telegraph wire}} cables beneath the road, as the above-ground installations were continually broken and disrupted following snowstorms.

5|$|Large {{amounts of}} {{radioactive}} lanthanum were dispersed by the explosions; 254 tests were performed between 1944 and 1961. In 1948 two workers received radiation burns there. The experiments were generally performed {{when the wind}} blew to the north, but occasionally the wind would change direction in the early morning. In 1949 and 1950 the nuclear fallout from the tests was blown over parts of the housing area and a road; the radiation levels on the road occasionally reached 5-10mR/h <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> had to be closed for a while.|$|E

5|$|Several travel guides have praised {{individual}} {{parts of}} the road, such as the section from Tyndrum to Glencoe across Rannoch Moor, as providing memorable driving experiences. Tourists find the A82 a popular route because of its scenery, and {{it serves as a}} main artery for commercial and heavy goods traffic. Transport Scotland have publicly declared a commitment to improve congestion and safety along the road. Parts of the A82 are occasionally closed for maintenance, which has resulted in strong protest from the local community, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> has been criticised for its poor accident record.|$|E

5|$|The {{bridge is}} {{at the mouth of}} Coal Mine Hollow, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> it was on was used by the lumber and coal {{industries}} that were active in Plunketts Creek Township during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Creeks in the township supplied water power to 14 mills in 1861, and by 1876 there were 19 sawmills, a shingle mill, a woolen factory, and a tannery.

Father Gabriel Richard, the first priest {{to serve in the}} U.S. House of Representatives, petitioned Congress to fund a highway between Detroit and Chicago in March 1824.

5|$|Travel to {{the area}} before it was a {{national}} park was rare due to its remote location, lack of accommodations, {{and the absence of}} real roads in southern Utah.
