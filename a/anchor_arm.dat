40|$|Abstract: In {{the late}} 19 th century, the {{transportation}} needs of Quebec led to proposals for bridging the St. Lawrence River. The Quebec Bridge {{was the longest}} cantilever structure attempted until that time. In its final design, the clear span was 548. 6 m (1, 800 ft) long. The bridge project was financially troubled from the beginning. This caused many setbacks {{in the design and}} construction. Construction finally began in October 1900. In August 1907, the bridge collapsed suddenly. Seventy five workers were killed in the accident, and there were only 11 survivors from the workers on the span. A distinguished panel was assembled to investigate the disaster. The panel’s report found that the main cause of the bridge’s failure was improper design of the latticing on the compression chords. The collapse was initiated by the buckling failure of Chord A 9 L, on the <b>anchor</b> <b>arm</b> near the pier, immediately followed by Chord A 9 R. Theodore Cooper had been the consulting engineer for the Quebec Bridge project, and most of the blame for the disaster fell on his shoulders. He mandated unusually high allowable stresses, and failed to require recalculation of the bridge dead load when the span was lengthened...|$|E
25|$|A common way to {{construct}} steel truss and prestressed concrete cantilever spans is to counterbalance each cantilever arm with another cantilever arm projecting the opposite direction, forming a balanced cantilever; when they attach to a solid foundation, the counterbalancing <b>arms</b> are called <b>anchor</b> <b>arms.</b> Thus, in a bridge built on two foundation piers, {{there are four}} cantilever arms: two which span the obstacle, and two <b>anchor</b> <b>arms</b> which extend away from the obstacle. Because {{of the need for}} more strength at the balanced cantilever's supports, the bridge superstructure often takes the form of towers above the foundation piers. The Commodore Barry Bridge is an example of this type of cantilever bridge.|$|R
50|$|Built in 1950, the Patton Bridge {{spans the}} Green River {{near the city}} of Auburn in King County, Washington. The bridge is a three-span {{cantilever}} with two <b>anchor</b> <b>arms,</b> two cantilever arms and a suspended section. It includes a combination of concrete and steel box girders. The bridge was designed by Homer M. Hadley, a consulting engineer from Washington State.The <b>anchor</b> <b>arms</b> and cantilever arms are multiple box, two-cell reinforced concrete box girders. The suspended section consists of two spread, welded steel box girders with reinforced concrete deck. The concrete deck is fixed to the top flange plate of the girders with steel shear developers. Utilization of this deck design allows the concrete deck and steel box girders to act in composite design; i.e., the bottom flange of the steel box resists tensile forces while the concrete deck resists compressive forces.The Patton Bridge's <b>anchor</b> <b>arms</b> are 115 ft feet long, the cantilever arms are 50 ft long, and the suspended span is 100 ft. The bridge has a total length of 430 ft. The center span of 200 ft is the longest box girder span constructed in the state during the 1940s.|$|R
40|$|This {{protocol}} describes mesh insertion {{into the}} rectovaginal septum in sheep using a single vaginal incision technique, {{with and without}} the trocar-guided insertion of <b>anchoring</b> <b>arms.</b> Parous sheep underwent the dissection of the rectovaginal septum, followed by the insertion of an implant with or without four <b>anchoring</b> <b>arms,</b> both designed to fit the ovine anatomy. The <b>anchoring</b> <b>arms</b> {{were put in place}} using a trocar and an "outside-in" technique. The cranial arms were passed through the obturator, gracilis, and adductor magnus muscles. The caudal arms were fixed near the sacrotuberous ligament, through the coccygeus muscles. This technique allows for the mimicking of surgical procedures performed in women suffering from pelvic organ prolapse. The anatomical spaces and elements are easily identified. The most critical part of the procedure is the insertion of the cranial trocar, which can easily penetrate the peritoneal cavity or the surrounding pelvic organs. This can be avoided by a more extensive retroperitoneal dissection and by guiding the trocar more laterally. This approach is designed only for experimental testing of novel implants in large animal models, as trocar-guided insertion is currently not used clinically. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|When {{commissioned}} in 1943, Howrah was the 3rd-longest {{cantilever bridge}} in the world, behind Pont de Québec (549 m) in Canada and Forth Bridge (521 m) in Scotland. It has since been surpassed by three bridges, making it the sixth-longest cantilever {{bridge in the}} world in 2013. It is a suspension type balanced cantilever bridge, with a central span 1,500 ft between centers of main towers and a suspended span of 564 ft. The main towers are 280 ft high above the monoliths and 76 ft apart at the top. The <b>anchor</b> <b>arms</b> are 325 ft each, while the cantilever arms are 468 ft each. The bridge deck hangs from panel points in the lower chord of the main trusses with 39 pairs of hangers. The roadways beyond the towers are supported from ground, leaving the <b>anchor</b> <b>arms</b> free from deck load. The deck system includes cross girders suspended between the pairs of hangers by a pinned connection. Six rows of longitudinal stringer girders are arranged between cross girders. Floor beams are supported transversally on top of the stringers, while themselves supporting a continuous pressed steel troughing system surfaced with concrete.|$|R

Between 1939 and 1958, a different coat of Arms and flag were used, which the population criticized; it consisted of a golden shield, covered by a red net, the sea and a black Poveiro boat; the flag was plain red. The population did not accept these new symbols and years later the old ones would be restored.|$|R

Vibrational fingerprints in the 2700 – 3100 cm− 1 spectral range showed the intercalation of Tris/EDTA (TE) buffer molecules within the HS-ssDNA self-assembled monolayer. Buffer contribution to SFG can be quenched either by using SFG inactive molecules like KH 2 PO 4 /K 2 HPO 4 /NaCl (PBS) or by repeated rinsing of the DNA layer with pure water.

40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{substituted}} ferrocenes {{have been investigated}} as active redox molecules, able to tune the response of a functionalized electrode (especially gold and silicon) on which they are adsorbed, due to their attractive electrochemical characteristics: fast electron-transfer rate, low oxidation potential, and two stable redox states [1]. Ferrocene derivatives present also {{the advantage of a}} facile tunability of their redox potential via substitution of one or more H atoms of the cyclopentadyenil (Cp) ring with distinct functional groups. We present the results of an experimental and theoretical investigation on pure ethyl-, vinyl and ethynylferrocene in the gas phase by means of NEXAFS at the C K-edge, and XPS of the C 1 s region, and by DFT calculations. Such a combination probes both the state of charge of the C atoms of the substituent group of the three molecules, and the extent of conjugation of the C-C arm with the Cp ring. A reliable assignment of the characteristic NEXAFS features associated to double and triple C-C bond of the lateral substituents of such closely related molecules may offer the fingerprint of the preservation or loss of the unsaturation in the <b>anchoring</b> <b>arm</b> upon its reaction with a surface, as well as shed light on the reaction mechanism for the surface anchoring on Si with different recipes, which is an actively investigated, yet still open, issue...|$|R
40|$|The {{electron}} transfer to self-assembled molecular monolayers carrying a ferrocene (Fc) center, grafted {{on a flat}} Si(100) surface, is a recent subject of experimental investigation. We report here the density functional theory (DFT) ab initio calculation of Fc-silicon hybrid redox potentials. The systems were modeled with a slab of H-terminated Si(100) 1 x 1 and 2 x 1 surfaces: geometries were optimized using the ONIOM method, and solute-solvent interactions were included through the polarizable continuum model (PCM) method. Two new routes for Si functionalization with ethyl- (EtFC) and ethynyl-Fc (EFC) differing only in the unsaturation degree of the <b>anchoring</b> <b>arm</b> have been successfully explored, and the redox potential of the resulting hybrids has been measured by cyclic voltammetry: 0. 675 and 0. 851 V versus NHE for the EtFC and EFC derivatives, respectively. These values, along with the previously measured potential (0. 700 V) for the mono-unsaturated derivative, vinyl-Fc, allow {{the relation between the}} unsaturation degree and the adduct redox potential to be studied. The comparison among the measured and computed potentials allows one to discriminate between different adduct isomers for the saturated species and more importantly provides strong indications that the carbon-carbon unsaturation initially present in the molecular <b>arm</b> used for <b>anchoring</b> to the surface is preserved upon addition, in contrast with the commonly accepted reaction mechanism...|$|R

Moreover, these antibodies decorated the undulating membrane in Trichomonas vaginalis, Trichomitus batrachorum, and Tritrichomonas foetus, and the cresta in Foaina. Centrin was not demonstrated in the dividing spindle and paradesmosis. Immunogold labeling, both in pre- and post-embedding, confirmed that centrin {{is associated with the}} basal body cylinder and is a component of the nine <b>anchoring</b> <b>arms</b> between the terminal plate of flagellar bases and the plasma-membrane. Centrin is also associated with the hook-shaped fibers attached to basal bodies (F 1, F 3), the X-fiber, and along sigmoid fibers (F 2) at the pelta-axostyle junction, which is the microtubule organizing center for pelta-axostyle microtubules. There was no labeling on the striated costa and parabasal fibers nor on microtubular pelta-axostyle, but the fibrous structure inside the undulating membrane was labeled in T. vaginalis. Two proteins of 22 - 20 kDa corresponding to the centrin molecular mass were recognized by immunoblotting using these antibodies in the three trichomonad species examined.
