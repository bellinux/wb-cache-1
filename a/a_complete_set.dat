5|$|A design {{competition}} {{was announced in}} July 1911, but there were not many contenders. The Naval Ministry favored the design from the Russud Works and gave preliminary orders for three ships on 2 September, even before the competition was concluded in November. Russud's design was unsurprisingly selected and the government transferred designers from the government-owned Baltic Works as well as <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> <b>set</b> of drawings for the Gangut-class {{to speed up the}} detailed design process.|$|E
5|$|A {{representative}} {{piece of}} Mycenaean armor is the Dendra panoply (c. 1450–1400 BC) {{which consisted of}} a cuirass of <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> <b>set</b> made up of several elements of bronze. It was flexible and comfortable enough {{to be used for}} fighting on foot, while the total weight of the armor is around 18kg (about 40lb). Important evidence of Mycenaean armor has also been found in Thebes (c. 1350–1250 BC), which include a pair of shoulder guards, smaller than to those from Dendra, with additional plates protecting the upper arms, attached to the lower edge of the shoulder guards.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFor an {{expanding}} matrix H∈Zk×k, a subset W⊂Zk is called <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> digit <b>set,</b> if all {{points of the}} integer lattice Zk can be uniquely represented as a finite sum x=∑i= 0 N(x) Hiri, with ri∈W and N(x) ∈N. We present a necessary and sufficient condition {{for the existence of}} <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> digit <b>set</b> in case det(H) = 2, implying that W is <b>a</b> binary <b>complete</b> digit <b>set.</b> This allows a characterization of the binary number systems (H,W) in Zk. It is shown that, when H has <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> digit <b>set,</b> all its <b>complete</b> digit <b>sets</b> form <b>a</b> finitely generated Abelian group.

5|$|After the war, the Mimoyecques site lay abandoned. Much of the {{equipment}} left by the Germans was disposed of as scrap metal. <b>A</b> <b>complete</b> <b>set</b> of four steel plates, weighing 60 tons, that were intended to protect the entrances to the drifts were bought by {{the manager of the}} Hidrequent-Rixent quarries to be cut up for use in rock-crushing machinery. Rediscovered by local historians in the 1990s, they remained at the quarries until 2010, when the surviving plates were returned to Mimoyecques, where they are now on display.|$|E
5|$|Despite German {{interest}} in the battlecruiser project, the two sides could not agree on terms. The German delegation insisted that orders placed in their country be guaranteed, with financial compensation {{to be paid to}} German companies if the Dutch did not construct the ships. They also refused to release <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> <b>set</b> of plans for the Scharnhorsts. Further complicating negotiations, the Dutch Cabinet, which would have to approve any deal, did not convene during the summer of 1939.|$|E
5|$|The 1806 waxwork of Lambert was {{exported}} to the United States {{and was on}} show in New Haven, Connecticut, by 1813. By 1828, the effigy was displayed in the Boston Vauxhall Gardens dressed in <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> <b>set</b> of Lambert's clothes. It was later bought by P.T. Barnum and displayed at Barnum's American Museum in New York, but the museum was destroyed by fire in 1865 and, although workmen endeavoured to save the waxwork, it melted in the heat and was destroyed.|$|E

5|$|The {{authenticity}} of the casket letters has {{been the source of}} much controversy among historians. It is impossible now to prove either way. The originals, written in French, were probably destroyed in 1584 by Mary's son. The surviving copies, in French or translated into English, do not form <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> <b>set.</b> There are incomplete printed transcriptions in English, Scots, French, and Latin from the 1570s. Other documents scrutinised included Bothwell's divorce from Jean Gordon. Moray had sent a messenger in September to Dunbar to get a copy of the proceedings from the town's registers.|$|E
5|$|The granite {{church was}} built in 1850 by local stonemasons and paid for {{primarily}} by Creighton and Meade, but also by Creighton's wealthy neighbors, including US Navy Commodore Matthew C. Perry, James Watson Webb, William Aspinwall, and Ambrose Kingsland. The first services there were held on September 21, 1851. The church is in near-original condition, with a design based on the 14th-century Gothic St. Mary's parish church in Scarborough, England {{and is the only}} church with <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> <b>set</b> of John Bolton (brother of William Jay Bolton) stained-glass windows.|$|E

5|$|As {{the summer}} of 1985 continued, sales of the C5 {{remained}} far below Sinclair's predictions; only 8,000 had been sold by July. In {{the middle of that}} month, the Advertising Standards Authority ordered Sinclair to amend or withdraw its advertisements for the C5 after finding that the company's claims about the safety and speed of the C5 either could not be proved or were not justified. Retailers attempted to deal with unsold stocks of C5s by drastically cutting the vehicle's price. Comet first reduced the price to £259.90 {{but by the end of}} the year was selling C5s with <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> <b>set</b> of accessories for only £139.99, 65% less than the initial price.|$|E
5|$|Saddles {{were made}} of wood and were {{designed}} as a standing platform for archers. They were not suited for riding long distances or at high speed. Early saddles of the Nara period were of Chinese style karagura and later modified for local tastes, resulting in Japanese style saddles from the Heian period onward. Artisans and carpenters {{became involved in the}} saddle production as saddles became more elaborate in the Kamakura period, with decorations in mother of pearl inlay, gold leaf and multiple coats of lacquer. Saddles ceased to be primarily utilitarian, instead serving as adornment showing the owner's status in processions. Three Japanese style lacquered wooden saddles and <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> <b>set</b> of a Chinese style ritual saddle, dating to the late Heian and Kamakura periods, have been designated as National Treasures.|$|E
5|$|The Museum of the Riverina was {{established}} in 1967 by the Wagga Wagga and District Historical Society. Wagga Wagga City Council took over its operations in the late 1990s and it now operates at two sites. The Historic Council Chambers site {{on the corner of}} Baylis and Morrow streets in central Wagga, hosts travelling exhibitions and the main site at the Botanic Gardens is home to the main collection including the Wagga Wagga Sporting Hall of Fame. The museum also has an important collection of memorabilia about the Tichborne Case, including a set of four rare plaster figurines depicting characters from the trial, <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> <b>set</b> of hard-bound court transcripts and a monumental painting entitled The Tichborne Trial painted in 1874 by Nathan Hughes, which hangs in the city's council chambers.|$|E

5|$|The cabin {{located on}} the main deck {{underneath}} the sterncastle {{is thought to have}} belonged to the barber-surgeon. He was a trained professional who saw to the health and welfare of the crew and acted as the medical expert on board. The most important of these finds were found in an intact wooden chest which contained over 60 objects relating to the barber-surgeon's medical practice: the wooden handles of <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> <b>set</b> of surgical tools and several shaving razors (although none of the steel blades had survived), a copper syringe for wound irrigation and treatment of gonorrhoea, and even a skilfully crafted feeding bottle for feeding incapacitated patients. More objects were found around the cabin, such as earscoops, shaving bowls and combs. With this wide selection of tools and medicaments the barber-surgeon, along with one or more assistants, could set bone fractures, perform amputations and deal with other acute injuries, treat a number of diseases and provide crew members with a minimal standard of personal hygiene.|$|E
5|$|The nine {{aircraft}} {{were ordered}} as the Kestrel FGA.1, which was essentially an improved {{version of the}} P.1127. On 7 March 1964, XS688 became the first Kestrel to conduct its maiden flight, flown by Bill Bedford. The Kestrel had fully swept wings and a larger tail than the early P.1127s, and the fuselage was modified to take the larger 15,000lbf (85kN) Pegasus 5 engine as in the P.1127/Kestrel prototype XP984, in addition to some other changes, such as addition of ultra high frequency (UHF) radio and assorted operational equipment in a bay house within the rear fuselage. Prior to {{the availability of the}} Kestrel for testing, a pair of NASA pilots visited Dunsfold to perform <b>a</b> <b>complete</b> <b>set</b> of handling trials using the earlier P.1127 in its place.|$|E
5|$|Armour {{has been}} {{employed}} in battles in Japan since the Yayoi period. Some {{of the oldest}} extant items from the 4th to the 7th centuries were excavated from kofun and have been designated as archaeological National Treasures. These ancient armours were of two types: a tight fitting solid plate cuirass (tankō) and a skirted lamellar type (keikō), both believed {{to be based on}} Chinese or Korean prototypes. This list includes more recent pieces of armour, developed as result of a trend toward (lamellar) scale armour that began in Japan in the 6th to the 7th centuries and matured in the mid-Heian period (9th to 10th centuries). Combining materials such as leather and silk with iron or steel parts, these armours had the advantage of being light, flexible, foldable and shock absorbent. They were generally lacquered to protect them from the humid climate and were used widely from the late Heian period to the mid-14th century. <b>A</b> <b>complete</b> <b>set</b> consisted of a helmet, mask, neck guard, throat protector, breastplate with shoulder guards, sleeve armour, skirt, greaves, shoes and a pennant attached to the back.|$|E
