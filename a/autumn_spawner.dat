40|$|Atlantic salmon {{exhibit a}} {{partially}} heritable polymorphism {{in which the}} morphs are distinguished by the duration and location of the sea-phase of their life-cycle. These morphs co-occur, albeit in characteristically different proportions, in most Scottish rivers and in both the spring and <b>autumn</b> <b>spawner</b> runs; early running fish being generally associated with upland spawning locations while late running fish are associated with lowland spawning. Thus, differences in riverine and marine environment appear {{to be linked to}} differences in the relative abundance of the morphs, rather than to the specific morph which is optimally adapted. In this paper, we report a model-based synthetic study aimed at understanding the key dynamic elements which determine the long-term stability of this polymorphism, and thus determine the relative abundance of the various sea-age morphs. Given the recent accumulation of evidence for a genetic basis for the polymorphism, we argue that the key dynamic mechanism which equalises the realized fitness of the sea-age morphs must be one or more morph-specific density dependencies in the riverine phase of the life-history. We explore a number of specific mechanisms, firmly based in known salmon biology, by which such morph-specific density dependence could occur and investigate the robustness of the co-existence which they imply. We conclude that the co-occurrence of multiple sea-age morphs of Atlantic salmon in Scottish rivers is a stable genetic polymorphism, maintained by some combination of physical separation and asymmetric competition between spawners of different morphs or the riverine stages of their offspring or both...|$|E
40|$|Herring, Clupea harengus, {{is one of}} the ecologically and commercially most {{important}} species in European northern seas, where two distinct ecotypes have been described based on spawning time; spring and autumn. To date, it is unknown if these spring and <b>autumn</b> <b>spawning</b> herring constitute genetically distinct units. We assessed levels of genetic divergence between spring and <b>autumn</b> <b>spawning</b> herring in the Baltic Sea using two types of DNA markers, microsatellites and Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms, and compared the results with data for <b>autumn</b> <b>spawning</b> North Sea herring. Temporally replicated analyses reveal clear genetic differences between ecotypes and hence support reproductive isolation. Loci showing non-neutral behaviour, so-called outlier loci, show convergence between <b>autumn</b> <b>spawning</b> herring from demographically disjoint populations, potentially reflecting selective processes associated with <b>autumn</b> <b>spawning</b> ecotypes. The abundance and exploitation of the two ecotypes have varied strongly over space and time in the Baltic Sea, where autumn spawners have faced strong depression for decades. The results therefore have practical implications by highlighting the need for specific management of these co-occurring ecotypes to meet requirements for sustainable exploitation and ensure optimal livelihood for coastal communitie...|$|R

40|$|In the Baltic Sea the <b>autumn</b> <b>spawning</b> herring forms {{a smaller}} number of groups than the spring herring does. This is {{probably}} connected with the different location of their spawning grounds. Spawning grounds of the spring herring are concentrated in favorable sites near the coast (in gulf, estuaries, etc.) while between such spawning centers gaps occur usually. Contrary to it, {{in most parts of the}} Baltic spawning places of the autumn herring form a continuous chain situated in the open sea. Therefore, differences in environment conditions between the <b>autumn</b> <b>spawning</b> grounds of neighboring areas are small and in large districts the characters of the autumn herring do not reveal essential differences. For instance, there is no significant difference between the autumn herrings caught on various grounds off the Polish coasts (2, 5). The autumn herring of the Swedish Baltic coasts can be divided into four groups (that of the Gulf of Bothnia, that of the Bothnia Sea, the herring of the Swedish east coast and that of the Swedish south coast), between which a gradual transition occurs [1].

40|$|Sub-stock {{components}} of highly exploited migratory fish species exhibit different life-history traits and can thus show variation in productivity and vulnerability to fishing pressure. Celtic Sea herring comprises both autumn and winter-spawners that are {{targeted by the}} same fishery. The current study investigated if the relative abundances of the two components in the Celtic Sea have changed over time, and whether this could explain marked long-term trends in size-at-age. The study utilized a remarkably long time-series of biological data from commercial landings (1959 – 2009). Based on the maturity state of the gonads {{at the time of}} sampling, herring were assigned to seasonal spawning components. Significant temporal variations in spawning component dominance were found, even after potential bias due to fishing history patterns were accounted for. Strong directional changes in the relative proportion of spawning components consisted of <b>autumn</b> <b>spawning</b> herring proportions reaching a peak in the 1990 s before drastically declining. Winter spawning herring had lower mean lengths- and weights-at-age than <b>autumn</b> <b>spawning</b> herring. The recent decline in the <b>autumn</b> <b>spawning</b> component did not fully explain the observed decline in size-at-age in the catches, with both spawning components showing similar decreases in mean-size parameters over time. Response of spawning components to environmental changes may have consequences for the fishery, {{especially in light of the}} observed influence of temperature on spawning components. Life-cycle diversity in herring stocks may confer resilience to potential climate-induced changes. Therefore, it is suggested that the relative proportions of spawning components should be monitored and diversity should be preserved as part of the management of fisheries for this species, which is characterized by stock complexity.

40|$|The year class {{strength}} of the Iberian sardine is regulated by hydroclimatic conditions in the North Atlantic.

Larval bloaters have a high mortality until they become large enough to avoid predation by other bloaters and alewives. It is slow-growing, because of the scarcity of food in its habitat.

40|$|The study {{object was}} an Odontesthes bonariensis (Valenciennes, 1835) {{population}} of a characteristically shallow lake from the pampasic region. Over one year, zooplankton and fish {{samples were collected}} monthly. As a function of time and gender, several indices were investigated (relative weight, mesentery fat index, gonadosomatic index, hepatosomatic index and somatic index) and were related to zooplanktonic community dynamics, the main energy food source for this species. The {{results indicate that the}} seasonal information contained in the weight compartments is most important in mesentery fat, gonads and liver. The zooplankton availability modulates reserves (fat) behaviour and physiologic activity (liver), determining spawn intensity.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, North Sea <b>autumn</b> <b>spawning</b> herring (Clupea harengus) {{has gone through}} {{consecutive}} years of lowrecruitment despite high spawning-stock biomass.

In this study, we analyse a long-term dataset of larval distribution, obtained during the International Bottom Trawl Survey, in relation to environmental conditions during winter and zooplankton abundances, obtained from the continuous plankton recorder. These analyses assessed the potential influence of these factors on the reduced survival of larval stages. Generalized additive mixed models on 30 years of data showed the abundance of Pseudocalanus sp. during winter to have a strong relationship with larval distribution and abundance, suggesting that predator-prey processes are behind the low recruitment in recent years.

40|$|The herring of the Baltic Sea shows a {{complicated}} population structure. Comparable to herring {{in other areas}} {{it can also be}} discriminated as spring and <b>autumn</b> <b>spawning</b> herring. <b>Autumn</b> <b>spawning</b> herring has been nearly vanished since the late 1960 ’s. Baltic Sea spring spawning herring show a broad variety as far as morphometric and other biological characteristics are concerned. It seems not very likely that all those differences are genetically based. The spawning sites of populations are, however, often clearly separated and such groups of herring are in most cases characterized by distinct differences in individual growth. Therefore for assessment purposes it is necessary to distinguish between as small as possible units in order to not endanger smaller populations to become extinct by overexploitation. On the other hand migrations and mixing of herring of different origin especially during the summer feeding period result in extreme difficulties of the discrimination of small units. For this reason only three herring assess ment units have been identified for the central and the northern Baltic Sea: herring in Sub-divisions 25 – 32 + 32, herring in Sub-division 30 and herring in Sub-division 31. The spring spawning herring of the western Baltic Sea has been combined with spring spawning herring in Division IIIa. Only the herring stock in Sub-division 30 shows a positive development in the past. The largest assessment unit in Sub-divisions 25 – 29 + 32 decreased continuously during the whole period 1974 – 1998. The western Baltic Spring spawning herring stock decreased from 1990 to 1996. There is an ongoing debate on scientific level whether the combination of small populations into large assessment units like the one in S-D’s 25 – 29 & 32 might include the danger of the extinction of small compartments of the unit. On the other hand the practice by the International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission of managing the Baltic Sea herring fisheries by dividing a yearly Total Allowable Catch for the whole area among fishery zones without taking care of any biological structure and any individual stock development is totally against the idea of sustainability of fisheries...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFrom 1991 to 1997 the gonadosomatic index (GSI) of pelagic {{spawning}} female whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus, {{local name}} “Blaufelchen”) in Lake Constance-Obersee was determined.

The coefficient of variation of GSI ranged from 14 – 35 % of the mean in summer and autumn and decreased to values between 9 and 16 % immediately before spawning. The seasonal increase in GSI was similar for all years investigated, except in 1995, when after an exceptionally mild <b>autumn</b> <b>spawning</b> took place at a water temperature of about 9. 4 °C. In this year, the post-August development of GSI was retarded compared to the other years of the investigation, but immediately before spawning GSI was at a value of about 24 % body weight, i. e. in the same range as in the other years of the study.

The initial slow-growing stocks of numerous small perch and moderate numbers of large pike were subjected to a heavy initial fishing pressure that was subsequently relaxed for perch but not for larger (> 550 mm) pike. The number of charr in the lake has increased 6 – 8 -fold during the study, {{probably due to the}} sustained reduction in the abundance of the larger pike that heavily predate the <b>autumn</b> <b>spawning</b> race of charr when it enters the shallow littoral areas to spawn. 3.

40|$|The {{duration}} of embryonic {{development and the}} planktonic stage of meroplanktonic species is highly temperature dependent and thus the seasonal temperature oscillations of temperate regions greatly affect the patterns of hatching and benthic settlement. Based on data from the literature on embryonic development and planktonic {{duration of}} Octopus vulgaris (common octopus) in relation to temperature, and on observed temperature patterns, several models of hatching and settlement patterns were created. There was a good fit between observed settlement patterns and model predictions. Based on these models we concluded that in temperate regions: (1) when temperature is increasing (from early spring to mid summer) the hatching and settlement periods tend to shorten, while when the temperature is decreasing (during autumn) the hatching and settlement periods tend to lengthen; (2) hatching and settlement peaks are narrower and more intense than a spring spawning peak but wider and less intense than an <b>autumn</b> <b>spawning</b> peak; (3) at lower latitudes, hatching and settlement patterns tend to follow the spawning pattern more closely, (4) the periodic temperature pattern of temperate areas {{has the potential to}} cause a convergence of hatching during spring...|$|R
40|$|Annual {{cycle of}} gonad {{development}} and spawning in pearl oyster, Pinctada ficata (Gould) in Nakhiloo, Northeast Persian Gulf, was investigated {{over two years}} from August 1994 to June 1996. Gonadal condition was assessed by staging criteria to describe gametogenic development from histological preparations of randomly collected individuals of all sizes. A bimodal gametogenic pattern with summer and <b>autumn</b> <b>spawning</b> periods was evident throughout the study. Gametogensis commenced in November-December which proceeded by major gonadal maturation during February-April. Summer spawning was observed from April to July with major spawning at the latter end. During spawning peak in July, low level of gametogensis was noticed. Gametogenic activity was picked up again in August-September which proceeded by <b>autumn</b> <b>spawning</b> from September to December. Towards the end of spawning season, incidence of gonadal inactivation increased. Minimum level of gonadal activity was observed in November. Temperature regime appears to have influential role in regulation of gametogenic and spawning processes. Gonadal development and spawning trends were similar in both sexes. P. radiaata {{was found to be}} protandrous hermaphrodite which matured as a male at shell height greater than 20 mm. Biseivality was uncommon and the sex ratio was about 1 : 1. Ultrastructure of gametes were investigated in the Pictada fucata (Gould). "Auxiliary cells" closely accociated with developing oocytes were observed. Each oocyte seems to be associated with only one secretory cell. which is characterized by an abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum at the onset of vitellogenesis. Contact between this cell and a developing oocytes is maintained by a desmosome-like junction which can be observed when the vitelline coat is formed. these "auxiliary or nursing cells" seem to play a tropic role in vitellogenesis, and may be involved {{in the formation of the}} vitelline coat of the oocytes. Oocytic degeneration is observed in this species, it is a continuous phenomenon of varing intensity throughout the year. The ultrastructural changes resulting in lysis of the oocyte are described. Mature spermatozoa consist of a broad, cap-shaped acrosomal vesicle, subacrosomal material, a round nucleus, two triplet substructure centrioles surrounded by four spherical mitochondria, and a flagellum anchored to the distal centriole and plasma membrane. Spermatozoa of Plucata closley resemble to those of other investigated Pteriidae. Changes in proximate composition of soft tissue and gonadal cycle of Pinctada fucata was studied.

Plasma levels of the gonadal steroids 17 h-estradiol (E 2) and testosterone (T), and vitellogenin (Vtg), as well as a range of indices of ovarian development, were measured. Somatic growth and gonadal development were consistent with the stock's growth and development as an austral <b>autumn</b> <b>spawning</b> stock.

40|$|Seasonal {{change in}} {{temperature}} has {{a profound effect}} on reproduction in fish. Increasing temperatures cue reproductive development in spring-spawning species, and falling temperatures stimulate reproduction in autumn-spawners. Elevated temperatures truncate spring <b>spawning,</b> and delay <b>autumn</b> <b>spawning.</b> Temperature increases will affect reproduction, but the nature of these effects will depend on the period and amplitude of the increase and range from phase-shifting of spawning to complete inhibition of reproduction. This latter effect will be most marked in species that are constrained in their capacity to shift geographic range. Studies from a range of taxa, habitats and temperature ranges all show inhibitory effects of elevated temperature albeit about different environmental set points. The effects are generated through the endocrine system, particularly through the inhibition of ovarian oestrogen production. Larval fishes are usually more sensitive than adults to environmental fluctuations, and might be especially vulnerable to climate change. In addition to direct effects on embryonic duration and egg survival, temperature also influences size at hatching, developmental rate, pelagic larval duration and survival. A companion effect of marine climate change is ocean acidification, which may pose a significant threat through its capacity to alter larval behaviour and impair sensory capabilities.

The {{traditional}} autumn herring fisheries by Belgian fishers on the Flemish banks around the spawning areas in the southern North Sea however, continued during WWII. Data presented here show a 10 -fold increase in the Belgian ‘autumn spawning herring’ catches and a 5 -fold increase in landings per unit of effort of Downs herring during WWII.

40|$|The North Sea <b>autumn</b> <b>spawning</b> herring stock {{consists}} of several substock components distributed {{along the east}} coast of Great Britain. In recent years, this stock, as a whole, has exhibited an unprecedented sequence of poor recruitment, despite simultaneously having a large adult population and historically low exploitation rates. The weak year classes arise as a consequence of poor survival through the larval overwintering period, between the end of the yolk-sack phase and metamorphosis. However, the mechanism responsible is, as yet, unclear. In this work, we reanalyse 25 years of extensive larval surveys through the use of an individual-based hydrographic advection model. We run the model in a backtracking mode to identify the most likely spatial and temporal origin of a particular larval observation, and then use this information to assign it to a component. By performing this exercise for every single larva observed in surveys performed both prior to and after the overwinter period, it is possible to build up a picture of the annual larval survival rates of each component, and thereby identify any potential spatial differentiation in these processes. When combined with integrated information along the reconstructed drift trajectory (e. g. temperature, modelled plankton abundance), the patterns identified give us insight into the processes that drive both the survival of individuals from each component and the fundamental mechanisms causing the recent recruitment failure.

40|$|The {{model of}} {{ecological}} speciation implies that habitat differences may split a species by strong selection and rapid adaptation even under sympatric conditions. Recent {{studies on the}} polychaete Scoloplos armiger in the Wadden Sea, North Sea, indicate sibling species existing in sympatry: the intertidal 'Type I' with holobenthic development out of egg cocoons and the subtidal 'Type S' shedding pelagic larvae into the open water. In the current study, Type I and S are compared in habitat-related traits of reproductive timing and physiological response to hypoxia and sulphide. Spawnings of Type I and Type S recorded over six years overlap in spring and both appear to be triggered by rise in sea temperature above 5 °C. Type S exhibits an additional <b>autumn</b> <b>spawning</b> (at water temperatures around 10 °C) which was unknown till now and is absent in Type I. High overall abundances of pelagic larvae in the Wadden Sea are shown. Since the pelagic dispersal mode has been neglected so far, reassessment of S. armiger population dynamics models is suggested. Tolerance against sulphide and hypoxia were both lower in Type S than in Type I. This correlates with a measured 5 to 10 -fold lower sulphide concentration in the subtidal compared to the intertidal habitat. Physiological tolerance and divergence in developmental mode appear as traits which may have ultimately led to reproductive isolation between Type I and Type S.

The thermal tolerance of development was determined in embryos and larvae reared at twelve temperatures. For A. placenta, the ambient water temperature near Townsville and experimental control were 24 °C and treatments ranged from 14 to 37 °C. For C. rodgersii, ambient Sydney water temperature and experimental control were 17 °C, and the treatment range was 9 – 31 °C. A. placentahad a broader developmental thermal envelope (14 °C range 17 – 31 °C) than C. rodgersii (9 °C range 13 – 22 °C). Both species developed successfully at temperatures well below ambient, suggesting that cooler water is not a barrier to poleward migration for either species. Both species presently live near the upper thermal limits for larval development, and future ocean warming could lead to contractions of their northern range limits. This study provides insights into the factors influencing the realized and potential distribution of planktonic life stages and changes to adult distribution in response to global change...|$|R
40|$|The {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} variability of the egg and larval abundance of Merluccius spp. in the Benguela Jet Current was analysed. The Cape hakes, occurring in waters off South Africa, are important for the commercial fisheries in the southern Benguela system, but information on their early life-history strategy is sparse. Data and samples, for this study, were collected during bimonthly cruises of the South African Sardine and Anchovy Recruitment Project (SARP) from August 1995 to July 2003. Samples were collected with a mini-bongo net (300  µm mesh) on a transect crossing the Benguela Current off the Cape Peninsula at 34. 15 °S, 18. 29 °E extending 58  nm offshore. Eggs and larvae were commonly found in currents with north-westerly flow, suggesting that the Benguela Jet Current transports eggs and larvae of Merluccius spp. to the northern nursery areas. Spawning grounds of Merluccius spp. appeared {{to be on the}} western Agulhas Bank during August 1996 to July 1998. Two possible spawning grounds in different water depths were identified, suggesting spawning by both Cape hake species, M. capensis and M. paradoxus. Peak abundances of eggs and larvae of Merluccius spp. were found from June to October, a time of reduced offshore transport. Abundances of eggs and larvae were low in austral summer and <b>autumn.</b> <b>Spawning</b> intensity was higher during times of reduced upwelling as shown by correlations of abundances of early life stages with the upwelling index. This leads to the assumption that the early life-history strategy of Merluccius spp. is well adapted to the variability in upwelling intensity...|$|R
40|$|Original ArticleTwo {{rainbow trout}} female populations (Wt- 01 y Wt- 02) were studied, which a {{percentage}} of individuals displayed a double annually reproductive cycle (DARC). This trait is characterized by an <b>autumn</b> <b>spawning</b> (normal reproductive cycle) and an additional one at spring (additional reproductive cycle). During seasons 2004 and 2005, the specimens that registered an additional spawning besides the normal, included 14. 4 % (Wt- 01) and 36. 2 % (Wt- 02) of the population. These females belong to double-cycler specimens, while those who spawn once a year are mono-cyclers. In both populations, the reproductive performance of normal reproductive cycle was comparatively evaluated {{in relation to the}} additional reproductive cycle, using seven biometricreproductive variables. The average weight of the spawning females (Wt- 01 : 1139 ± 116 g vs 1528 ± 105 g; Wt- 02 : 1195 ± 217 vs 1512 ± 176), the total fecundity (Wt- 01 : 2. 310 ± 214 vs 3388 ± 299; Wt- 02 : 2. 691 ± 600 vs 3. 680 ± 509) and the relative fecundity (Wt- 01 : 2. 051 ± 278 vs 2. 226 ± 299; Wt- 02 : 2271 ± 420 vs 2461 ± 354), exhibited significant differences in favour of the additional reproductive cycle (p < 0. 05). Nevertheless, the eggs diameter (Wt- 01 : 5. 03 ± 0. 09 mm vs. 4. 70 ± 0. 18 mm; Wt- 02 : 4. 89 ± 0. 16 mm vs 4. 58 ± 0. 23 mm), the fertility rate (Wt- 01 : 86. 6 ± 15. 0 vs. 80. 8 ± 11. 9; Wt- 02 : 94. 5 ± 7. 5 vs 77. 8 ± 24. 9) and the eyed eggs stage survival rate (Wt- 01 : 83. 89 % ± 7. 70 vs 77. 62 % ± 9. 45; Wt- 02 : 84. 73 % ± 11. 80 vs 68. 84 % ± 15. 95), were significantly higher in the normal reproductive cycle. The quality of the eggs obtained during the additional cycle, was acceptable and compatible with it productive utilization. Analysis of additional reproductive cycle length (RCLa), the period time from <b>autumn</b> <b>spawning</b> date to spring spawning date, increases according to the spring spawning season progresses. First spawning females Wt- 01 and Wt- 02 had a RCLa average of 134 days (30 / 09 / 04) and 149 days (14 / 10 / 05) respectively, while the last spawners had a RCLa average of 187 days (29 / 11 / 04) and 217 days (03 / 02 / 06), respectively. In the same way, an eggs diameter increment was observed in relation with the spawning date progress during the additional reproductive cycle in Wt- 01 as well as in Wt- 02, showing high correlation values (r = 0, 973 y r = 0, 850, respectively). Additionally, the normal reproductive cycle length (RCLn) studied in a third population (Wt- 03), shows a decrease tendency in relation to the progresses of the date of spawning in previous spring spawning. The RCL dynamic of normal and additional reproductive cycles in double-cycler females could be associated to an energetic compensation that supports the high cost for a female to ovulate twice in a year. A greater dispersion or asynchrony is observed in the spawning date distribution over the additional cycle in regard to the normal cycle, which could be a consequence of the heterogeneity observed in RLC...|$|R
50|$|Adult male Nephrops norvegicus moult once {{or twice}} a year (usually in late winter or spring) and adult females moult up to once a year (in late winter or spring, after {{hatching}} of the eggs). In annual breeding cycles, mating takes place in the spring or winter, when the females are in the soft, post-moult state. The ovaries mature throughout the spring and summer months, and egg-laying takes place in late summer or early <b>autumn.</b> After <b>spawning,</b> the berried (egg-carrying) females return to their burrows and remain there until the end of the incubation period. Hatching takes place in late winter or early spring. Soon after hatching, the females moult and mate again.|$|R
40|$|Migrating salmon can {{increase}} productivity in Pacific Northwestern streams and lakes through the deposition of nutrients from their decomposing carcasses after spawning. Several studies also report simultaneous biotransport of {{persistent organic pollutants}} that have contaminated lake food webs, although no similar effect has been shown conclusively in rivers. We tested the prediction that salmon enhance contaminants in river food webs using the American dipper (Cinclus mexicanus), an aquatic songbird and a recognized indicator of stream quality. Over 3 years, we analyzed 29 dipper eggs and aquatic invertebrate samples from 14 different rivers in 10 catchments in southern British Columbia, Canada to assess whether variations in <b>autumn</b> <b>spawning</b> density of Pacific salmon were reflected in dipper egg contamination or stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes. δ 13 C isotope signatures, but not δ 15 N, in aquatic invertebrates and dipper eggs increased among catchments {{in proportion to the}} average density of spawning salmon. Concentrations of brominated flame retardants (PBDEs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane metabolites (DDTs), and chlordane compounds were related in part to the δ 13 C measure of salmon density, but mercury, chlorobenzenes, and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were explained better by dipper trophic level. We conclude that spawning Pacific salmon result in the increased availability of salmon fry as dipper prey and salmon are a significant source of PBDEs, DDTs, and chlordanes to river ecosystems. However, contrary to lake studies, postspawn concentrations of legacy PCBs in river birds, even in salmon-rich rivers, were not significantly higher than would be expected from atmospheric deposition alone. We recommend using δ 13 C isotopes to trace salmon-derived lipids which may persist over winter particularly in rivers, and are potentially a better reflection of lipophilic contaminant transfer...|$|R
