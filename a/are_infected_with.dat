5|$|A 2002 study {{conducted}} by CARE International across three districts in the Central Region of Malawi considers how HIV/AIDS has affected economic well-being in rural Malawi. When skilled laborers <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> HIV, they are usually unable to work; therefore, they often shift agricultural production on their land to less labor-intensive crops, sacrificing the opportunity to grow more profitable, labor-intensive crops such as tobacco. When family members fall ill with HIV/AIDS, their relatives invest time in their treatment and care, further reducing household productivity. In addition, when family members <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> HIV, households often use the money they would normally invest in agriculture to cover medical expenses, further decreasing economic stability at the household level. Finally, when adults contract HIV, their children often remain home from school {{to work in the}} fields, threatening long-term productivity and economic advancement in Malawi.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors make people more {{susceptible}} to TB infections. The most important risk factor globally is HIV; 13% of all people with TB are infected by the virus. This is a particular problem in sub-Saharan Africa, where rates of HIV are high. Of people without HIV who <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> tuberculosis, about 5–10% develop active disease during their lifetimes; in contrast, 30% of those coinfected with HIV develop the active disease.|$|E
40|$|Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) was {{isolated}} from 11 % of 148 Hmong children under 1 year old with diarrhea at {{a refugee camp}} in northern Thailand. Of 16 children with EPEC-associated diarrhea, 11 <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> EPEC that adhered to HeLa cells in a diffuse pattern, 3 <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> EPEC that adhered to HeLa cells in a localized adherence (LA) pattern, and 2 <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> EPEC that <b>were</b> nonadherent. In Bangkok, EPEC {{was isolated}} from 6 % of 64 children under 1 year old with diarrhea and 7 % of 56 children {{of the same age}} without diarrhea. Of four children <b>with</b> diarrhea, two <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> EPEC with an LA pattern, and two <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> nonadherent EPEC. Of four children without diarrhea, one <b>was</b> <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> EPEC with an LA pattern, one <b>was</b> <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> EPEC that adhered in a diffuse pattern, and two <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> nonadherent EPEC. The 21 EPEC isolates with an LA pattern hybridized with the EPEC adherence factor DNA probe. EPEC was the only enteric pathogen identified in 16 (80 %) of 20 children with EPEC-associated diarrhea. EPEC was as frequently isolated from children under 1 year old as were other bacterial enteric pathogens. The problem of identifying EPEC with pools of polyvalent antisera are described, and the need to identify additional enteropathogenic determinants of EPEC is discussed...|$|R

5|$|Many HIV-positive {{people are}} unaware that they <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> the virus. For example, in 2001 less than 1% of the sexually active urban {{population}} in Africa had been tested, and this proportion is even lower in rural populations. Furthermore, in 2001 only 0.5% {{of pregnant women}} attending urban health facilities were counselled, tested or receive their test results. Again, this proportion is even lower in rural health facilities. Since donors may therefore be unaware of their infection, donor blood and blood products used in medicine and medical research are routinely screened for HIV.|$|E
5|$|Not all ticks in an infective area <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> pathogens, {{and both}} {{attachment}} of the tick and a long-feeding session {{seem to be}} necessary for transmission of these diseases to take place. Thus tick bites often do not lead to infection, especially if the ticks are removed within 36 hours. Adult ticks can be removed with fine-tipped tweezers or proprietary tick removal tools, disinfecting the wound. It is also possible to freeze them off with a medical wart remover. If the tick's head and mouthparts break off during removal, they can be removed with tweezers like a splinter.|$|E

5|$|Cestodes (tapeworms) and digeneans (flukes) cause {{important}} {{diseases in}} humans and their livestock, and monogeneans can cause serious losses of stocks in fish farms. Schistosomiasis, {{also known as}} bilharzia or snail fever, is the second-most devastating parasitic disease in tropical countries, behind malaria. The Carter Center estimated 200million people in 74 countries <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> the disease, and half the victims live in Africa. The condition has a low mortality rate, but often is a chronic illness that can damage internal organs. It can impair the growth and cognitive development of children, and {{increase the risk of}} bladder cancer in adults. The disease is caused by several flukes of the genus Schistosoma, which can bore through human skin. The people most at risk are those who use infected bodies of water for recreation or laundry.|$|E
5|$|Whirling {{disease was}} first {{detected}} in fish in Johnson Lake in Banff National Park in May, 2016. CFIA Labs confirmed in August and Parks Canada announced the outbreak August 23, 2016. Although {{it was first}} discovered in Banff, {{it is not necessarily}} where the disease originated and spread. The Government of Alberta is currently sampling and testing fish in 6 different watersheds (Peace River, Athabasca, North Saskatchewan, Red Deer, Bow and Oldman) to see where the disease has spread. Initial sample fish were collected in 2016, and are currently being processed by the Government of Alberta and CFIA labs. Since testing began, it has been detected in the Upper Bow River, and in May 2017 it was confirmed that whirling disease had also been detected in the Oldman River Basin. The declaration does not mean that every susceptible finfish population within the Bow and Oldman River watersheds <b>are</b> <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> the disease.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{large-scale}} {{survey was}} conducted to investigate the infection status of fresh water fishes with Clonorchis sinensis metacercariae (CsMc) in 3 wide regions, which were tentatively divided by latitudinal levels of the Korean peninsula. A total of 4, 071 freshwater fishes were collected from 3 regions, i. e., northern (Gangwon-do: 1, 543 fish), middle (Chungcheongbuk-do and Gyeongsangbuk-do: 1, 167 fish), and southern areas (Jeollanam-do, Ulsan-si, and Gyeongsangnamdo: 1, 361 fish). Each fish was examined by the artificial digestion method from 2003 to 2010. In northern areas, only 11 (0. 7 %) fish of 2 species, Pungtungia herzi and Squalidus japonicus coreanus from Hantan-gang, Cheolwon-gun, Gangwon-do <b>were</b> <b>infected</b> <b>with</b> av. 2. 6 CsMc.
