5|$|R.C. MacLeod {{considered}} the above 'fairy lover' tradition {{to be connected}} to another about <b>a</b> <b>lullaby.</b> This tradition originated with Neil MacLeod, who was the clan bard in {{the last half of the}} 19th century; he obtained the tradition from several old women in 'MacLeod country'. This lullaby-tradition related how on an autumn night, a beautiful fairy visited Dunvegan Castle. She passed through several closed doors and entered the nursery where the infant heir to the chief was lying in his cradle. The nursemaid, who was within the room as well, was rendered powerless by a spell and could only watch as the fairy took the infant on her knee and sang him <b>a</b> <b>lullaby.</b> This song was so remarkable that it was imprinted upon the nursemaid's memory, and later she lulled the baby asleep by singing the same song. R.C. MacLeod stated that, over time it was believed that any infant of the chiefly family, to whom this lullaby was sung, would be protected by the power of the fairies. For a while, no nurse was employed by the family who could not sing this song. A period of 200 years then passed before any chief had been born within the castle, and the custom of singing the fairy's lullaby ceased to be followed—but according to R.C. MacLeod, not completely forgotten. R.C. MacLeod claimed that a nursemaid sang this lullaby at the castle in the year 1847, for his infant elder brother, who would later become Sir Reginald MacLeod of MacLeod (1847–1935), 27th chief of the clan. An English translation of the lullaby is shown to the right.|$|E
5|$|Code: Veronicas story, setting, {{and artistic}} design strayed {{away from the}} series standard. While {{previous}} games are set in the United States and have a corresponding American feel to them, Code: Veronica {{is set in the}} Southern Ocean and Antarctica and carries a European gothic horror inspired design. This is made clear in the environments which features gothic architecture and art in addition to central European carvings and German-style weaponry. In addition, the gothic feel is emphasized through the story. The horror in Code: Veronica is driven by this story which follows a crazed man and the fate of his noble bloodline. The story is told partly through <b>a</b> <b>lullaby,</b> and this method of story telling is intended to bring out European operatic undertones. This contrasts to previous games in the series which were driven by the panic elements from American horror films, such as monsters and zombies. With regards to managing the art staff, Mikami split them up depending on their interests. Those interested in guns worked solely on gun designs while those interested in environments were sent to photograph houses and castles for research.|$|E

25|$|It is daytime {{again and}} Vladimir begins singing a {{recursive}} round {{about the death}} of a dog, but twice forgets the lyrics as he sings. Again, Estragon claims to have been beaten last night, despite no apparent injury. Vladimir comments that the formerly bare tree now has leaves and tries to confirm his recollections of yesterday against Estragon's extremely vague, unreliable memory. Vladimir then triumphantly produces evidence of the previous day's events by showing Estragon the wound from when Lucky kicked him. Noticing Estragon's barefootedness, they also discover his previously forsaken boots nearby, which Estragon insists are not his, although they fit him perfectly. With no carrots left, Vladimir is turned down in offering Estragon a turnip or a radish. He then sings Estragon to sleep with <b>a</b> <b>lullaby</b> before noticing further evidence to confirm his memory: Lucky's hat still lies on the ground. This leads to his waking Estragon and involving him in a frenetic hat-swapping scene. The two then wait again for Godot, while distracting themselves by playfully imitating Pozzo and Lucky, firing insults at each other and then making up, and attempting some fitness routinesall of which fail miserably and end quickly.|$|E

Aly Barchi of Complete Music Update described the genre of the song as [...] " [...] pastel-shaded take on UK garage, trappy beats and bon-bon dance-pop", and the lyrics as [...] "‘girl-boy’ lyrics so super-sticky-kitsch". Barchi has also described the song as a [...] "universal story of ‘a love unrequited', told in the most basic ABC rhymes at top pitch over a ‘Shanks & Bigfoot go to Disneyland’-style beat".

Klinkenberg also noted that Diamond had slightly pitched-up vocals in the song. Maurice Marion of Rare Candy has described [...] "Pink and Blue" [...] as subtly addressing the cultural issue of sexualizing and infantilizing pop stars to market music, citing perceived sexual lyrics such as [...] "hey, why don’t you hit me up?", Diamond’s [...] "baby-talk vocals", and the song's [...] "sugary production" [...] as pushing the aforementioned issue to a [...] "self-conscious extreme".|$|E
500|$|Like many of Orbison's songs, [...] "In Dreams" [...] {{rejects the}} verse-chorus-verse-bridge-chorus {{structure}} {{of the majority of}} rock and roll fare.

[...] The sandman puts him to sleep, where he begins singing about dreams of his lover. Drums pick up the rhythm to follow Orbison's lyrics further into subconsciousness, and a piano joins as the lyrics recount how Orbison spends time with her, accompanied by breathy backup singers.
