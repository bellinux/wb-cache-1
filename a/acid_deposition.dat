It enlarged a network of monitoring sites to determine how acidic the precipitation actually was, and to determine long-term trends, and established a network for dry deposition. It looked at the effects of acid rain and funded research on the effects of acid precipitation on freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems, historical buildings, monuments, and building materials.

40|$|The bulk of <b>acid</b> <b>depositions,</b> {{which have}} harmful {{effects on the}} environment, are caused by foreign {{emissions}} in many European countries. Therefore, if some countries emit more acids, one cannot be sure that countries that emit less will benefit from reduced <b>acid</b> <b>depositions.</b> However, numerical simulations with the RAINS model indicate that differences in costs and <b>acid</b> <b>depositions</b> are negatively correlated when equally expensive cost-effective scenarios for Europe are compared, and scenarios only differ {{with respect to the}} constraints on depositions at various locations. The negative correlation is twofold: both the signs of changes for individual countries and the magnitude of changes between countries are negatively correlated. The novelty {{of this paper is to}} explain these findings. It is shown how the structure of atmospheric transport coefficients must be accounted for in order to understand the numerical findings. Since the atmospheric transport coefficients are constant, the hypothesis is that the two types of correlation will exist for all targets on acidification in Europe. This insight can help policymakers to agree upon a methodology for calculating targets for acidification, and maybe it also can help them to find a consensus upon more ambitious policies towards acidification.

The intensive vegetated roof is also a sink of total nitrogen in contrast to the extensive roof. Phosphorus release is observed from the extensive vegetated roof but not from the intensive vegetated roof;, release of dissolved organic carbon and potassium is observed from both roofs. The vegetated roofs, if not retaining the metal pollutants, were generally not a significant source.

They also indicate the selective deposition of 18 : 1 n- 9 compared with linoleic acid (LLA) and linolenic acid (LNA).
