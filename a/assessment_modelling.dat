50|$|Integrated <b>assessment</b> <b>modelling</b> (IAM) or {{integrated}} modelling (IM) {{is a type}} {{of scientific}} modelling often used by the environmental sciences and environmental policy analysis. The modelling is integrated because environmental problems do not respect the borders between academic disciplines. Integrated assessment models therefore integrate knowledge from two or more domains into a single framework. Integrated modelling is referred to as assessment because the activity aims to generate useful information for policy making, rather than to advance knowledge for knowledge's sake. Integrated <b>assessment</b> <b>modelling</b> is that part of integrated assessment that relies on the use of numerical models.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThere is {{a current}} need for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) systems {{architecture}} generation and <b>assessment</b> <b>models.</b> Architecture <b>assessment</b> <b>models</b> that presently exist {{tend to be}} fractional and do not account for all dynamic attributes {{that should be considered}} in the architecture assessment. There are infinite possibilities of architecture <b>assessment</b> <b>modeling</b> methods {{that can be used to}} assess conceptual systems architecture. Developing a good architecture <b>assessment</b> <b>model</b> for evaluating the functional and systems architecture reduces system ambiguity while increasing the tangibility of the system. This paper will present an <b>assessment</b> <b>model</b> specifically for UAV systems and this model can also be adapted to virtually any type of complex adaptive system. On new complex UAV systems it is essential evaluate the appropriate Level of Autonomy (LOA) required to satisfy customer and mission requirements. The <b>assessment</b> <b>model</b> detailed in this paper combines known design heuristics with quantitative, qualitative, and visual representations that assess the probability that the generated architecture will meet performance and capability requirements. The architecture <b>assessment</b> <b>model</b> will assess and generate a combined score that will indicate if the architecture is acceptable or unacceptable. Future UAV systems may reach a LOA that would be considered as Artificial Intelligence (AI); and this pursuit will increase the need for advanced LOA architecture <b>modeling</b> and <b>assessment...</b>|$|R
30|$|Since {{the advent}} of the first OSS quality model in 2003 (Adewumi et al. 2013), a number of other models have since been derived leading to an {{increasing}} collection of OSS quality models. Quality models in general can be classified into three broad categories namely: definition, <b>assessment</b> and prediction <b>models</b> (Ouhbi et al. 2014, 2015; Deissenboeck et al. 2009). Generally, OSS quality <b>assessment</b> <b>models</b> outline specific attributes that guide the selection of OSS. The <b>assessment</b> <b>models</b> are very significant because they can help software evaluators to select suitable OSS in the midst of alternatives (Kuwata et al. 2014). However, despite the numerous quality <b>assessment</b> <b>models</b> proposed, there is still little or no adoption of these models in practice (Hauge et al. 2009; Ali Babar 2010). In order to guide the formulation of newer models, there is need {{to understand the nature of}} the existing OSS quality <b>assessment</b> <b>models.</b> The aim of this study is to investigate the nature of the existing OSS quality <b>assessment</b> <b>models</b> by classifying them with respect to their quality characteristics, the methodology they use for assessment, and their domain of application so as to guide the formulation and development of newer models. Existing studies on OSS quality <b>assessment</b> <b>models</b> (Miguel et al. 2014; Adewumi et al. 2013) are largely descriptive reviews that did not seek to classify OSS quality <b>assessment</b> <b>models</b> along specific dimensions, or answer specific research questions. In contrast, this paper employs a methodical, structured, and rigorous analysis of existing literature in order to classify existing OSS quality <b>assessment</b> <b>models</b> and establish a template guide for model developers when they come up with new models. Thus, this study is a systematic literature review that investigates three research questions, namely: (1) what are the key quality characteristics possessed by the OSS <b>assessment</b> <b>models?</b> (2) What selection methods are employed for use in these <b>assessment</b> <b>models?</b> (3) What is the domain of application? In order to conduct this systematic review, the original guidelines proposed by Kitchenham (2004) have been followed.|$|R

5000|$|The UN-Energy {{corporation}} {{was formed}} {{at the request}} of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD), and released a report which argues that today's climate-changing-world [...] "entrenches poverty, constrains the delivery of social services, limits opportunities for women, and erodes environmental sustainability at the local, national and global levels" [...] (UN 2005). According to the report, 2.4 billion individuals rely on biomass for cooking, while 1.6 billion people worldwide are without electricity. Consequently, there is an explicit connection between energy access and poverty reduction, often referred to energy poverty (UN 2005). Services such as heating, lighting, cooking, and transportation facilitate socioeconomic development, for they yield social benefits as well as employment and income (UN 2005). Integrated <b>assessment</b> <b>modelling</b> (IAMs) is utilized to quantify the current socioeconomic dimensions of climate change, and further predict future effects on nations (Skoufias 2012).|$|E
