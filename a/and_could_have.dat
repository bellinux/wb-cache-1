5|$|Any {{extended}} ocean voyage without {{fresh water}} or food would prove {{difficult for a}} large, warm-blooded (homeothermic) mammal, but today many small, nocturnal species of lemur exhibit heterothermy, which allows them to lower their metabolism and become dormant while living off fat reserves. Such a trait in a small, nocturnal lemur ancestor would have facilitated the ocean voyage <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been passed on to its descendants. However, this trait has not been observed in the closely related lorisoids studied to date, <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> evolved on Madagascar {{in response to the}} island's harsh environmental conditions.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{southern}} right whales are seen with rolls of fats behind blowholes that northern species often lack, {{and these are}} regarded {{as a sign of}} better health condition due to sufficient nutrition supply, <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> contributed in vast differences in recovery status between right whales in southern and northern hemisphere, other than direct impacts by mankind.|$|E
5|$|A {{research}} paper published {{ten years after}} the storm suggested that Gay could have been stronger than Typhoon Tip, which attained the lowest barometric pressure ever recorded. While at its peak intensity, Gay registered a rating of 8.0 for nine consecutive hours using the Dvorak technique, indicating sustained wind speeds of at least (315km/h) 195mph. In addition, the cyclone had a significantly colder band of clouds around the eye. Typhoon Angela in 1995 presented similar features <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been stronger than Gay. Neither of the two had direct observations into their eyes, however, making it impossible to confirm such intensity.|$|E

5|$|At {{the north}} end of the small {{courtyard}} is a chapel and at the southern end is an esplanade. The esplanade is raised above the rest of the courtyard; the vaulted area beneath it would have provided storage <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> acted as stabling and shelter from missiles. Lining the west of the courtyard is the hall of the Knights. Though probably first built in the 12thcentury, the interior dates from the 13th-century remodelling. The tracery and delicate decoration is a sophisticated example of Gothic architecture, probably dating from the 1230s.|$|E
5|$|Carol L. Valenzuela, 20, {{was last}} seen hitchhiking near Vancouver, Washington, on August 2, 1974. Her remains were {{discovered}} two months later in a shallow grave south of Olympia, {{along with those of}} another female later identified as Martha Morrison, 17 (last seen in Eugene, Oregon on September 1, 1974). Both victims had long hair parted in the middle. In August 1974 Bundy drove from Seattle to Salt Lake City <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> passed through Vancouver and Eugene en route, but {{there is no evidence that}} he did. Both cases remain open.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{summarised}} his speculation in {{his essay}} on the Elevation of Patagonia. Though tentative, it challenged Lyell's ideas. Darwin drew on measurements by the Beagles officers {{as well as his}} own measurements to propose that the plains had been raised in successive stages by forces acting over a wide area, rather than smaller scale actions in a continuous movement. However, he supported Lyell in finding evidence to dismiss a sudden deluge when normal processes were suddenly speeded. Seashells he had found far inland still showing their colour suggested to him that the process had been relatively recent, <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> affected human history.|$|E

5|$|He was {{described}} by sportswriters of the time {{as one of the}} fastest pitchers in the league, comparable to Amos Rusie and Ted Breitenstein. Kid Nichols remarked in 1902 that Stivetts' speed was as fast as Rusie, <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> extended his career much longer had he taken better care of his body. Baseball writer O. P. Caylor wrote that Stivetts' issues were entirely his own, blaming his hard-drinking lifestyle and his inability to remain in good condition.|$|E
5|$|It {{must seem}} {{to the reader}} that this Colonel Beriah Norton was a traitor to his own people, but {{what could he do}} but give in to Grey's command! Grey had the force and the power <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> {{destroyed}} the towns on the island in half a day, and would have done so if they had resisted in any way. In the diary, September 12th and 13th are omitted. Those were the days when the British troops were ravaging the island from Edgartown to Gay Head.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the design of the first castle at Rochester as it has since vanished, and even the exact site is uncertain. It most likely took the form of a motte-and-bailey castle, with a mound and an outer {{enclosure}} defended by a timber palisade and earthen banks. Boley Hill has been suggested as the site of the first castle, an outwork reinforcing the castle's defences, or an abandoned siege castle like those documented in the 1088 siege. Boley Hill is a natural outcrop of rock, <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> acted as a motte.|$|E

The idea of the horse pleased her more than anything she had yet thought of in connection with her wealth.|$|R

5|$|Meanwhile, {{a lasting}} peace with France {{was made in}} 1558 and the initial {{invasion}} threat passed. The Spanish threat to the south-west of England became more serious, however, and war broke out in 1569. As a result, a defensive earthwork was constructed north-west of the castle to protect it against an attack from the land, and an additional gun battery facing upriver was installed alongside the blockhouse. The levels of the garrison varied considerably during the period. Pendennis had a garrison of 100 men in 1578, <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> mustered around 500 men in 1596, while in 1599 it was reportedly guarded by 200 soldiers.|$|E
5|$|On 7 January 1915, at Spina Khaisora (Tochi Valley) During {{operations}} against the Khostwal tribesmen, Captain Jotham, who was commanding {{a party of}} about a dozen of the North Waziristan Militia, was attacked in a nullah and almost surrounded by an overwhelming force of some 1,500 tribesmen. He gave the order to retire, <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> himself escaped, but most gallantly sacrificed his own life by attempting to effect the rescue of one of his men who had lost his horse.|$|E
5|$|The AIF relinquished {{control over}} the men and {{responsibility}} for them while {{they were part of}} the NRRF, but undertook to repatriate them to Australia after they returned from Russia. Their motivations for joining were diverse, although few seemed have been political. Some had arrived in Britain as reinforcements too late to see any fighting during the war, and wanted to experience active service before returning to Australia. Others were decorated veterans and may have been motivated by a desire to see Russia, whilst some may have been unable to settle down after their wartime experiences, <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> viewed service as a means of postponing their return to civilian life.|$|E

5|$|The quatrefoil gunports in {{the lower}} levels {{could have been used}} for both hand cannons and crossbows, with {{overlapping}} fields of fire. The roof was reinforced with large timber joints, <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> supported heavier bombards, possibly on wheeled carriages; the tower's considerable height would have allowed the bombards to reach across the river onto the higher ground overlooking the city. Getting the bombards onto the roof may have required them to be hoisted up on a winch; one such hoist formed part of the accounts for the tower's construction in 1398 and 1399.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower was}} closed in 1914 {{following}} {{the outbreak of}} the First World War, for the duration of which the steel structure was not maintained and consequently became rusty. During the war the government made unsuccessful attempts to buy the tower for its metal. Controversy still surrounds the decision to dismantle the tower after the war ended; some still believe the structure was safe <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been repaired. Demolition began in 1919 and by 1921 only the ballroom remained. The metal was sold to scrap dealers.|$|E
5|$|Wright told Lee {{that it was}} {{relatively}} easy {{to get to the}} crest, but it was difficult to stay there. A significant reason Wright could not stay was his lack of support. Two brigades were on Wright's left <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> reinforced his success. Carnot Posey's brigade made slow progress and never crossed the Emmitsburg Road, despite protestations from Wright. William Mahone's brigade inexplicably never moved at all. Gen. Anderson sent a messenger with orders to Mahone to advance, but Mahone refused. Part of the blame for the failure of Wright's assault must lie with Anderson, who took little active part in directing his division in battle.|$|E

5|$|After {{acquiring}} Hansen, the Phillies assigned {{him to the}} Triple-A Baltimore Orioles. He {{was called}} up to the major league club in July after posting a 1â1 record with a 5.45 ERA and 14 strikeouts, working exclusively from Baltimore's bullpen. Hansen's first appearance with Philadelphia came on July 6; he pitched two innings in relief of Russ Meyer, who allowed three runs without recording an out. Three straight appearances in doubleheader openers followed Hansen's Phillies debut: he faced two Cardinals batters without a putout on July 15; pitched two scoreless innings against Cincinnati two days later; <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> earned his first victory of the season on July 22 had Konstantyâthe closer and 1950's National League Most Valuable Playerânot collected his fifth blown save of the year. Hansen pitched in three more games that month, recording his first decision of the season on July's final day: he defeated the Reds, 7â5, pitching one inning and allowing two runs.|$|E
5|$|After the SovietâLithuanian Peace Treaty was {{ratified}} in 1920, the Russian SFSR recognized Lithuanian {{claims to}} the Vilnius Region and continued to support them. In its responses to the 1938 ultimatum, the Soviet Union expressed concerns over Lithuania's independence and threatened to abrogate the SovietâPolish Non-Aggression Pact of 1932. It made it clear, though, {{that it did not}} wish to be drawn into an armed conflict. This stance has been attributed to the growth of a threat from Japan; armed assistance to Lithuania would have required the Red Army to invade either Poland or Latvia <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> resulted in a war on two fronts. The Soviets urged France, a major ally of Poland at the time, to de-escalate the conflict and encourage a more moderate version of the ultimatum. France and the United Kingdom, preoccupied with the Anschluss, pressured Lithuania to normalize the relationship with Poland as soon as possible. They feared that the ultimatum had been approved by Nazi Germany.|$|E

Rather than go to jail, and ignoring Jared's screams of protest, he jumps to his death. In the weeks that follow, Jared's life collapses. Despite learning of Diane's illness, he moves out of her house, choosing instead to be homeless. Jared returns home one day to collect his belongings; after arguing with Diane, he confesses that he witnessed Tracy's rape <b>and</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> saved her life if he had intervened or helped her afterwards. Later that day, Jared joins Diane and Cherie in cleaning graffiti from Tracy's grave.|$|E
