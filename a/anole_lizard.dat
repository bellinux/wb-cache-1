2500|$|Anolis oculatus, the Dominican anole or eyed anole, is {{a species}} of <b>anole</b> <b>lizard.</b> It is endemic to the Caribbean island of Dominica, where it is found in most environments. [...] It is {{distributed}} in four main population groups on the island, which were initially described as subspecies and now are recognized as ecotypes. It has a very diverse morphology between these populations, with a ground color that ranges from pale tan or yellow to deep green or brown. It also has patterned markings that range from light-colored speckling to complex marbled patterns, and some populations also have large black-ringed [...] "eye" [...] spots on their flanks. This diversity {{is the product of}} adaptation to different ecological conditions found within Dominica, which has made it the subject of numerous studies.|$|E

These <b>anole</b> <b>lizards</b> {{are thought}} to have the same structural niche and have similarities in their size and shape.

40|$|This work gives a {{proof of}} {{convergence}} for a randomized learning algorithm that describes how <b>anoles</b> (<b>lizards</b> {{found in the}} Carribean) learn a foraging threshold distance.

This learning algorithm was proposed by the biologist Roughgarden and his colleagues.

Our analysis provides an analytic confirmation that the learning algorithm converges to this optimal foraging threshold with high probability. 1. Introduction The model proposed by Roughgarden ([3], see also [1, 4]) models the behavior of <b>anoles,</b> which are <b>lizards</b> found in the Carribean. Anoles usually perch at a spot in their territory scanning the ground for prey. If an anole sees a prey that it considers worth pursuing, it leaves its perch and returns after the prey has been c [...] ...|$|R
