5|$|West made a {{conscious}} decision to abstain from the widespread recording practice of excessive rap albums saturated with skits and filler and instead comprised Graduation with significantly fewer tracks. He also chose to scale back on the guest appearances, limiting himself to just one single guest rap verse on the entire studio album. The stylistic divergence and desire for a leaner, more economical studio album was a creative reaction that was brought on by the alternative rock and indie-rock that West had been listening to {{around the time of the}} recording of his third studio album. West cites the rock bands The Killers, Keane, Modest Mouse, and indie-pop singer-songwriter Feist, whom he also looked towards for songwriting inspiration, for being among his favorite musicians and having considerably profound influence on the sound of Graduation. Largely due to <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> the inclusion of the layered electronic synthesizers, West believed that his record took hip-hop in a different direction. But he also acknowledged the fact that the differences did not right away and without a doubt make Graduation a good album. However, he felt it was a representation of the music he was listening to at that time.|$|E

25|$|In {{contrast}} to his glamorous image, Boyer began losing his hair early, had a pronounced paunch, and was noticeably shorter than leading ladies like Ingrid Bergman. When Bette Davis first saw him {{on the set of}} <b>All</b> <b>This,</b> <b>and</b> Heaven Too, she did not recognize him and tried to have him removed.|$|E
25|$|In 1938, Rachel Field {{published}} her <b>All</b> <b>This</b> <b>and</b> Heaven Too, a novel which {{centers on}} the killing of Sébastiani's daughter. The 1940 drama film of the same starred Barbara O'Neil as Fanny, Charles Boyer as De Choiseul-Praslin, and Bette Davis as Henriette Deluzy-Desportes, the governess. Sébastiani is portrayed by Montagu Love.|$|E
25|$|By this time, Davis was Warner Bros.' most {{profitable}} star, {{and she was}} given {{the most important of}} their female leading roles. Her image was considered with more care; although she continued to play character roles, she was often filmed in close-ups that emphasizes her distinctive eyes. <b>All</b> <b>This</b> <b>and</b> Heaven Too (1940) was the most financially successful film of Davis' career to that point.|$|E

25|$|He was a prelate {{of great}} learning, a patron of studies, {{enriching}} with parchments the library at Caesarea founded by Eusebius.

25|$|The country {{used to be}} one of Africa's richest and is now one of its poorest. Many {{observers}} now {{view the}} country as a 'failed state'. The settlement of the Second Congo War brought back Zimbabwe's substantial military commitment, although some troops remain to secure the mining assets under their control. The government lacks the resources or machinery to deal with the ravages of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, which affects 25% of the population. With <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> the forced and violent removal of white farmers in a brutal land redistribution program, Mugabe has earned himself widespread scorn from the international arena.|$|E

In contrast to <b>all</b> <b>this</b> (<b>and</b> due to a variety of factors, including a pre-war policy that strove for a peaceful resolution and an international arms embargo), the central government under Alija Izetbegović and its formal army was relatively unorganized and unprepared. Because of this, the assistance of well-armed groups such as Prazina's private army in the city's defense was welcomed, and their pre-war criminality overlooked in light of their apparent willingness to fight for a united and sovereign Bosnia and Herzegovina.|$|E
25|$|I helped him. If I'd opposed him, he wouldn't {{have been}} on the radar screen. I'd have been {{opposing}} Michael Heseltine. I had to make the decision quickly. I didn't want to go back on my word to my wife that I'd retired from front-line politics. How would it all work? Was No 10 suitable for someone in a wheelchair? All these things go through one's mind. Then if Michael had won...he would have had to ask me to join his government, and I didn't want that. I asked myself: why am I risking <b>all</b> <b>this?</b> <b>And</b> I made my decision...I might have been an absolute disaster in the job. It's possible. So I am left there. You can't rewrite it. You can't rerun it.|$|E
25|$|I find it {{very hard}} to say this truth. I am to blame for {{everything}} I did at that time. I am trying to erase <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> to be what I was not at that time. I am also to blame for what I did not do, for not trying to protect those prisoners. Regardless of the temporary nature of my then-post. I ask myself again and again, what could I have done that I didn't do? Thousands of innocent victims perished. Graves remain behind, refugees, destruction and misfortune and misery. I bear general part of the responsibility for this. There is misfortune on all sides that stays behind as a warning that this should never happen again. My testimony and admission of guilt will also remove blame from my nation because it is individual guilt, the guilt of a man named Dragan Obrenović. I stand by this. I am responsible for this. The guilt for which I feel remorse and for which I apologise to the victims and to their shadows. I will be happy if this contributed to reconciliation in Bosnia, if neighbours can again shake hands, if our children can again play games together, and if {{they have the right to}} a chance. I will be happy if my testimony helps the families of victims, if I can spare them having to testify again and thus relive the horrors and the pain during their testimony. It is my wish that my testimony should help prevent this ever happening again, not just in Bosnia, but anywhere in the world. It is too late for me now, but for the children living in Bosnia now, it's not too late and I hope that this will be a good warning to them.|$|E

Britney is aware of <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> she's extremely upset by it. She's a human being.

500|$|In his 1980 {{commentary}} on the story, Dick also suggested that his reasoning for making Bors sympathetic {{was a result of}} a form of trust he advanced towards robots, as opposed to androids. [...] "Perhaps", he suggested, [...] "it's because a robot does not try to deceive you as to what it is". One of the themes that runs throughout all of Dick's fiction is the [...] "power of empathy" [...] and he uses it as the [...] "key element defining the authentic human being". For example, when Silvia meets the robot that runs the government, she exclaims [...] "My God, you have no understanding of us. You run <b>all</b> <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> you're incapable of empathy.

500|$|In {{the second}} half of 1976, thanks to the success of both Rock 'n' Roll Music and McCartney's world tour with his band Wings, the public's nostalgia for the Beatles was at a peak. Examples of this {{heightened}} interest included the increasingly generous offers from rival promoters Bill Sargent and Sid Bernstein for a one-off Beatles reunion concert; 20th Century Fox's musical documentary <b>All</b> <b>This</b> <b>and</b> World War II, for which, as with the 1974 stage play John, Paul, George, Ringo … and Bert, Harrison would refuse permission for any of his songs to appear; and Steve Harley & Cockney Rebel having a top-ten hit in the UK with a cover of Harrison's composition [...] "Here Comes the Sun". The planned Harrison greatest-hits compilation then became an experiment by Capitol whereby Beatles tracks were mixed with solo hits on the one album. Harrison immediately disavowed the venture, he being the least attached to the band's legacy of all the former Beatles.|$|E
500|$|Rossio and Marsilii {{believe that}} many of the {{negative}} reviews of Déjà Vu are a direct result of Scott's direction of the film, and have stated that [...] "Tony Scott added nothing to Déjà Vu and made several hundred small mistakes and about eight or nine deadly mistakes", which makes the film seem like it has many unforgivable plot holes, when it should not have had any. [...] "here are no plot holes at all, and scrutiny reveals the plot to be air tight." [...] says Rossio. [...] "We had years to think of <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>and</b> work it out." [...] It was felt there were many misunderstandings that Scott's take on the plot introduced into the film. In his own defense, Scott cited in an interview with Iain Blair of BNET that only nineteen weeks were provided for the production of the film, which [...] "isn't a lot for a film like Déjà Vu." ...|$|E

Vanilla Fudge, the debut album by American rock band Vanilla Fudge, also contains a brief homage to [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever" [...] {{at the end of their}} cover of [...] "Eleanor Rigby" [...] (the homage is entitled [...] "ELDS" [...] on CD versions of the album, and CD versions of the album in fact additionally spell out an acrostic of the song as an homage, with portions of preceding tracks entitled [...] "STRA", [...] "WBER" [...] and [...] "RYFI"). Todd Rundgren's version of the song was released on his 1976 album Faithful. The song was also covered by Jim Sturgess and Joe Anderson for the 2007 movie Across the Universe. Los Fabulosos Cadillacs recorded a ska version of the song featuring Debbie Harry for their album Rey Azúcar, which was a hit throughout Latin America.|$|E
