There {{are to be found}} the finest analysis on the different relationships that can be established between the constituants of the sentence, which are very difficult to deal with {{in the context of the}} traditionnal grammar taught at school, and wich contemporary linguistic theories have merely enlightened. This chapter also sheds light on a number of conveying points with the theoretical hypotheses which have been developped in the past few years at the university of Paris III (EA 1483 "Recherches sur le francais contemporain" under my supervision, JE "Acquisition et contrastivite" under the supervision of L.

50|$|Top {{fermentation}} is {{a process}} that is difficult to control, because unwanted bacteria might contaminate the brew due to the high <b>ambiant</b> temperature. The final result of a brew might vary quite drmamtically. After the first fermentation the beer is tasted and for certain beers fermented again. This second fermentation can be done in an open tub or in the bottle. In the latter case the beer is bottled with added extra sugar and yeast.|$|E
50|$|In the {{presence}} of water or simply <b>ambiant</b> moisture, the strong bases, NaOH or KOH, readily dissolve in their hydration water (hygroscopic substances, deliquescence phenomenon) and this greatly facilitates the catalysis process because the reaction in aqueous solution occurs much faster than in the dry solid phase. The moist NaOH impregnates the surface and the porosity of calcium hydroxide grains with a high specific surface area. Soda lime is commonly used in closed-circuit diving rebreathers and in anesthesia systems.|$|E

Before the hyperbaric experiment, an intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of phosphate saline-buffered solution (PBS) or adenosine deaminase (ADA, 100 U. ml- 1) in PBS was performed. Throughout the hyperbaric experiment carotid blood flow increased with <b>ambiant</b> pressure in PBS-treated rats. Conversely, the increase in carotid blood flow was attenuated by ADA treatment.

40|$|We {{define the}} notion of special Lagrangian curvature, showing how it may be {{interpreted}} as an alternative higher dimensional generalisation of two dimensional Gaussian curvature. We obtain first a local rigidity result for this curvature when the <b>ambiant</b> manifold has negative sectional curvature. We then show how this curvature relates to the canonical special Legendrian structure of spherical subbundles of the tangent bundle of the <b>ambiant</b> manifold. This allows us to establish a strong compactness result. In the case where the special Lagrangian angle equals (n- 1) π/ 2, we obtain compactness modulo a unique mode of degeneration, where a sequence of hypersurfaces wraps ever tighter round a geodesic.

When fed ad libitum. the shrews cannot be forced into torpor by a sudden decrease of the <b>ambiant</b> temperature (from 22 °C to 3 °C). At 22 °C, a progressive restriction of the daily food ration, to below 3 g of mealworms, induces torpors of increasing duration, a reduction of the daily activity and a reduction of the body weight. The minimal daily food ration required for survivals is 1 to 1, 5 G. At low <b>ambiant</b> temperature (e. g. 5 °C), torpor can be induced at higher food levels (4 - 5 g) ...|$|E

In 1974, the males were submitted to three different temperature regimes : group I : <b>ambiant</b> temperature; group II : <b>ambiant</b> temperature + 3 °C; group III : <b>ambiant</b> temperature + 6 °C. The experiment was repeated in 1975, but only using groups I and Ill.

Spermatogenesis in the tench was a discontinuous process, starting in the spring and finishing in the summer. It began earlier in heated water in which the spawning period was also considerably longer (3 months in group III against 1 month in group I). At the beginning of spermatogenesis, pituitary and plasma GTH was low, but rose rapidly when spermatogenesis was initiated (appearance of type B spermatogonial cysts and meiosis). The highest GTH levels in the blood were recorded during the spawning period, with important fluctuations probably due to discharges from the pituitary...|$|E

Its oxidization takes place very quickly in the presence of <b>ambiant</b> oxygen. However the accumulated action of the two factors weakens to the highest degree pumpkin seed oil and this results in polymerization.

The <b>ambiant</b> sounds she uses, have a special meaning in her work, particularly when they act poetically and aesthetically as designators, functionalized as aspects of silence. And even more so when they demon-strate a culturological, archaeological dimension of silence. This text examines the inter-ference of the silence of a historical and cultural ambiance with the inner, perceptional silence of a personal artistic meditation, which is pointed out by Ivana Stefanović’s radio-phonic epic poem Metropola tišine / Stari Ras (1992) ...|$|E

The location of injection varies from 1. 5 D to 15 D while the other parameters remain fixed to their optimum values. One notices better overall noise level reductions by injecting close to the nozzle exit. Moreover spectra analysis emphasizes that attenuation in high and low frequencies depends on the location of injection. Finally, the jet temperature doesn't greatly affect the efficiency of this method as the measured attenuation is similar to that encountered with supersonic jets with <b>ambiant</b> temperature...|$|E
