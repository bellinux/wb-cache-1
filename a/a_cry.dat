Participants reported they would give more emotional support to and express less negative affect toward <b>a</b> <b>crying</b> person than <b>a</b> noncrying person. However, regression analyses revealed that participants judged <b>a</b> <b>crying</b> person less positively than a noncrying person and felt more negative feelings {{in the presence of}} <b>a</b> <b>crying</b> person than <b>a</b> noncrying person.

40|$|Studied the {{autonomic}} {{regulation of}} 37 infants with <b>a</b> typical <b>cry</b> threshold and 17 infants with <b>a</b> high <b>cry</b> threshold (typical {{of problems in}} nervous system function). Infants with <b>a</b> high <b>cry</b> threshold had <b>a</b> longer latency to <b>cry,</b> <b>a</b> shorter first <b>cry</b> sound, and <b>a</b> shorter overall bout of crying. Spectrum analysis of 2 hours of heart rale variability showed that <b>a</b> high <b>cry</b> threshold was predictive of fewer reliable rhythms and a lower power of the basic 40 -min rhythm in heart rate. High cry threshold infants also showed fewer startles and changes in behavioral state. Results suggest <b>a</b> high <b>cry</b> threshold predicts disrupted autonomic regula-tion and poor coordination among rhythmic systems affecting cardiac activity. KEY WORDS: newborn infants; crying; heart rate; rhythms; assessment.
