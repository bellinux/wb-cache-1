Fingernail clubbing is not specific to COPD and should prompt investigations for an underlying lung cancer.|$|E

5|$|Concussions are {{particularly}} concerning, as repeated concussions may increase a person's risk {{in later life}} for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) and mental health issues such as dementia, Parkinson's disease, <b>and</b> <b>depression.</b> Concussions are often caused by helmet-to-helmet collisions, impact against the ground or other players' knees, and upper-body contact between opposing players. However, helmets have prevented more serious injuries such as skull fractures. Cervical spine injuries can be catastrophic, but have sharply declined since the mid-1970s due to rule changes and improved workout regimes, equipment, and coaching.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{motion is}} {{classified}} {{according to the}} anatomical plane it occurs in. Flexion and extension are examples of angular motions, in which two axes of a joint are brought closer together or moved further apart. Rotational motion may occur at other joints, for example the shoulder, and are described as internal or external. Other terms, such as elevation <b>and</b> <b>depression,</b> describe movement above or below the horizontal plane. Many anatomical terms derive from Latin terms with the same meaning.|$|E

Concussed individuals are advised not to use alcohol or other drugs that have not been approved by a doctor as they can impede healing. Activation database-guided EEG biofeedback has been shown to return the memory abilities of the concussed individual to levels better than the control group.|$|E

40|$|Background: Expressed emotion (EE) <b>and</b> {{maternal}} <b>depression</b> {{are important}} {{risk factors for}} youth <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> functioning. The present study examined these two risk-factors, both concurrently and longitudinally, within a sample of adolescents who were at risk for developing a depressive disorder {{as a function of}} elevated depression symptoms. Methods: Fifty-seven adolescents and their mothers were drawn from a randomized trial of Interpersonal Psychotherapy-Adolescent Skills Training (IPT-AST). Assessments were conducted at baseline, post-intervention, and at 6 -, 12 -, and 18 -month follow up. First, rates of critical EE were examined in this subclinical sample. Second, an ANCOVA framework was used {{to examine the relationship between}} EE, maternal <b>depression,</b> <b>and</b> adolescent <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> functioning. Results: Rates of critical EE in our sample were comparable to rates of critical EE in other at-risk and clinical samples. At baseline and post-intervention, no significant relationships were found between critical EE <b>and</b> adolescent <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> functioning. Maternal <b>depression</b> was related to one of the two measures of adolescent depression at baseline, but not to functioning. Both maternal <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> critical EE predicted adolescent <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> functioning at the 6 - and 12 -month follow up, however maternal depression was a more enduring risk factor in the longer term. Conclusions: Results suggest that although critical EE remains an important predictor of later adolescent <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> functioning, maternal <b>depression</b> may be a stronger risk-factor beyond the one year follow-up. ii...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveThe goal of {{this study}} was to examine the effect of {{clinical}} depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, <b>and</b> comorbid <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> posttraumatic stress disorder on in-hospital mortality after a coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. It is hypothesized that depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, <b>and</b> comorbid <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> posttraumatic stress disorder will independently contribute to an increased risk for in-hospital mortality rates after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. MethodsWe performed a retrospective analysis of the 2006 Nationwide Inpatient Sample database. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database provides information on approximately 8 million US inpatient stays from about 1000 hospitals. We performed χ 2 and unpaired t tests to evaluate potential confounding group demographic and medical variables. Hierarchic logistic regression was used with forced order entry of depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, <b>and</b> comorbid <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> posttraumatic stress disorder. ResultsDeceased patients were more likely to have had depression (alive, 24. 8 %; deceased, 60. 3 %; P <. 001), posttraumatic stress disorder (alive, 13. 4 %; deceased, 56. 1 %; P <. 001), <b>and</b> cormorbid <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> posttraumatic stress disorder (alive, 7. 8 %; deceased, 48. 5 %; P <. 001). After adjusting for potential confounding factors, patients with depression (odds ratio, 1. 24; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 02 – 1. 50), posttraumatic stress disorder (odds ratio, 2. 09; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 65 – 2. 64), <b>and</b> comorbid <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> posttraumatic stress disorder (odds ratio, 4. 66; 95 % confidence interval, 3. 46 – 6. 26) had an increased likelihood of in-hospital mortality compared with that seen in patients who were alive. ConclusionsTwo findings were noteworthy. First, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, <b>and</b> comorbid <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> posttraumatic stress disorder are prevalent in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting procedures. Second, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, <b>and</b> comorbid <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> posttraumatic stress disorder increase the risk of death by magnitudes comparable with well-established physical health risk factors after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. The implications for clinical practice and future directions are discussed...|$|R
