A VFR airport is modeled where each aircraft is an intelligent agent that communicates with other aircraft in order to decide when to enter the <b>approach</b> <b>corridor.</b> The control problem to be solved in this general aviation VFR airport is the variation in aircraft speed, which results in faster aircraft overtaking slower aircraft in the <b>approach</b> <b>corridor.</b> A graphical simulation library called Operational Evaluation Modeling for Context-Sensitive Systems (OpEMCSS) has been developed to simulate complex systems, including CAS. This simulation library includes a Classifier Event Action block that is a forward chaining, expert system controller used in intelligent agent decision-making. The Classifier Event Action block can implement both crisp and fuzzy rules. In one version of the model an equation is used to predict how long an aircraft is required to wait to enter the <b>approach</b> <b>corridor</b> {{in order to achieve}} the proper time and distance separation at final approach. Comparison of the required and actual performance is used to guide rule learning in the Classifier Event Action block.

The method requires {{the definition of a}} scalar potential function that represents the constrained operating environment. The potential function has a minimum at the desired goal position and has regions of high potential at path constraints. The spacecraft controls are chosen such that the rate of descent of the potential function is rendered negative definite. This ensures that the spacecraft state converges to the desired goal point without violating path constraints, such as keep-out zones and <b>approach</b> <b>corridors.</b> It is demonstrated that complex path planning with both V-bar and R-bar approaches can be achieved using a minimum of computational effort. Furthermore, since the method may be mathematically validated it is attractive for safety critical applications such as ATV and HTV proximity operations...|$|E

Although fundamental manipulator design, control systems, and strategies for autonomous versus manual control vary greatly between the systems, commonality in the design of workstation controls and displays is considered essential to enhance operator performance and reduce the possibility of errors. Principal human factors opportunities are associated with workstation layout, human-computer interface considerations, adequacy of alignment cues for maintenance of safe <b>approach</b> <b>corridors</b> during mating tasks, spatial awareness challenges, integration of supplemental computer graphic displays to enhance operator global situational awareness, and training methodologies for preservation of critical skills during long-duration missions...|$|E

Major challenges in these missions are posed by uncertainties in atmospheric properties like density and winds. A guidance algorithm based on optimal control theory and integrated with a nonlinear Structured Adaptive Model Inversion con-troller is developed, implemented and evaluated in this paper. The guidance algorithm uses B-spline parametrization of states to generate dynamically feasible optimal trajecto-ries which steer the vehicle from entry interface conditions to a Final <b>Approach</b> <b>Corridor,</b> while simultaneously satisfying terminal conditions.

The authority was formed in early 1952, and by 1955 it had issued the required bonds needed to construct a 123 mi highway from the New York-Massachusetts border to the recently completed route 128 in Weston.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a new minimum-fuel glideslope guidance algorithm for approaching autonomously a target evolving on an elliptic orbit. In {{addition to the}} usual rectilinear profile to follow as in Hablani's seminal paper, two new features are requested for the new algorithm. The first one imposes bounds on the guidance error inherent to chemical propulsion glideslope guidance, such that the chaser's trajectory does not escape from an admissible domain. The second one minimizes the consumption during rendezvous. Indeed, unlike the classical glideslope algorithm {{for which there is}} no direct control on the fuel consumption, additional degrees of freedom and relevant decision variables may be identified. By combining a useful parametrization of the Tschauner-Hempel relative equations of motion and results from polynomial optimization, a semidefinite formulation of the constraints on the maximal guidance error is obtained. For a fixed-time glideslope rendezvous with a pre-assigned number of maneuvers, a fuel-optimal solution with a bounded guidance error is obtained by solving a semidefinite programming problem.

40|$|It is {{well-known}} that onboard, real-time, optimal trajectory generation for reusable launch vehicles can substantially increase safety while reducing cost. Arguably, {{this is one}} of the most challenging problems in optimal control theory. In recent years, pseudospectral (PS) methods have shown considerable promise in solving such problems. In this paper, we investigate the utility of a PS guidance algorithm for solving this problem. Based on the X- 33, a generic vehicle model is constructed for analysis. It is shown that the PS guidance algorithm is capable of compensating for large uncertainties and disturbances that include greater than Category 5 -level hurricane-force wind gusts (Hurricane Katrina was Cat 4). A single algorithm is used to guide the vehicle from its entry condition to a final <b>approach</b> <b>corridor</b> of about 2000 ft away from the landing site. Despite that much research is still necessary, results so far suggest that PS guidance methods can enhance safety considerably. Computational times for unoptimized codes range from about a second to 10 seconds under a MATLAB environment running on legacy computer hardware. This suggests that real-time trajectory reshaping, and even abort guidance, are well within the reach of modern methods and existing computational capabilities...|$|R
