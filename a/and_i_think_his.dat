500|$|Kruger was by {{this time}} widely {{perceived}} as a personification of Afrikanerdom {{both at home and}} abroad. When he stopped going to the government offices at the Raadsaal by foot and began to be conveyed there by a presidential carriage, his coming and going became a public spectacle not unlike the Changing of the Guard in Britain. [...] "Once seen, he is not easily forgotten", wrote Lady Phillips. [...] "His greasy frock coat and antiquated tall hat have been portrayed times without number... <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> character is clearly to be read in his face—strength of character and cunning." ...|$|E
500|$|Waxy first {{stood at}} Lewes {{for a fee}} of 10 guineas per mare and a groom fee of 10 shillings. In September 1803, Sir Ferdinando Poole offered to sell Waxy for 700 guineas to William Lightfoot, an agent sent to buy horses for Virginian turfman John Tayloe. Lightfoot refused to buy Waxy, writing to Tayloe, [...] "he has lost an eye, and is {{thirteen}} years old, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> health bad." [...] Instead Lightfoot purchased Waxy's half-sister Keren Happuch who was covered by Waxy that year. It is unclear how Waxy lost his eye, its loss occurring sometime between 1797 and 1803. Sir Ferdinando Poole died on 8 June 1804, and Waxy was then acquired by the Duke of Grafton and relocated to the Euston Hall stud near Newmarket. Under the Duke's ownership, his fee increased to 25 guineas per mare and he covered 40 mares per season.|$|E
500|$|Upon its {{publication}} in English in early 2009, The Kindly Ones received mixed reviews. The New Republics literary critic Ruth Franklin called it [...] "one {{of the most}} repugnant books I have ever read [...] if getting under {{the skin of a}} murderer were sufficient to produce a masterpiece, then Thomas Harris would be Tolstoy." [...] Michiko Kakutani, the principal book critic of The New York Times, called the novel [...] "illfully sensationalistic and deliberately repellent" [...] and went on to question the [...] "perversity" [...] of the French literary establishment for praising the novel. In a reply to Kakutani, writer and novelist Michael Korda wrote, [...] "You want to read about Hell, here it is. If you don’t have the strength to read it, tough shit. It’s a dreadful, compelling, brilliantly researched, and imagined masterpiece, a terrifying literary achievement, and perhaps the first work of fiction {{to come out of the}} Holocaust that places us in its very heart, and keeps us there." [...] Writing for Time, American writer and journalist Lev Grossman compared it to Roberto Bolaño's 2666, similar in [...] "their seriousness of purpose, their wild overestimation of the reader's attention span and their interest in physical violence that makes Saw look like Dora the Explorer," [...] but added that while far from perfect, The Kindly Ones [...] "is unmistakably the work of a profoundly gifted writer, if not an especially disciplined one." [...] In her review for Los Angeles Times, novelist and essayist Laila Lalami wrote: [...] "Jonathan Littell has undertaken a very ambitious project in The Kindly Ones, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> boldness deserves to be commended. In the end, however, his highly problematic characterization and awkward handling of point of view make this book far more successful as a dramatized historical document than as a novel." [...] British historian Antony Beevor, author of Stalingrad and The Fall of Berlin 1945, reviewing The Kindly Ones in The Times, called it [...] "a great work of literary fiction, to which readers and scholars will turn for decades to come," [...] and listed it as one of the top five books of World War II fiction.|$|E
50|$|He was a {{great life}} force, full of spunk, courage <b>and</b> wit. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> {{willingness}} to defy authority for constructive purposes will be missed. Up to the end, he was defying authority.|$|R
2500|$|You can't {{categorize}} him. He's one {{of those}} singers that's not in one track.

6000|$|... "Well, Atherstone has {{improved}} a great deal," [...] Sybil answered, thoughtfully. [...] "There {{are a great}} many things about him which I like very much. He is always well dressed and fresh and nice. He enjoys himself without being dissipated, and he is perfectly natural. He is rather boyish perhaps, but then he is young. He {{is not afraid to}} laugh, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> like the way he enters into everything. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> like <b>his</b> persistence." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It's {{possible}} {{my views}} are not important," [...] he agreed. [...] "All the same, when I {{told the man}} he had better go he saw the force of my arguments.

"I {{liked him}} very much in London," [...] said Meta; [...] "he is {{pleasant}} enough to talk to, but somehow, he is not congruous here--if you understand me. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> coming oppresses Flora--she turned quite pale when he was announced, and her voice was lower than ever when she spoke to him." ...|$|E

60|$|Your Venetian is simpatico, {{if he is}} any thing. He {{is always}} ready to feel and to express the deepest concern, and I rather think he likes to have his {{sensibilities}} appealed to, as a pleasant and healthful exercise for them. His sympathy begins at home, and he generously pities himself as {{the victim of a}} combination of misfortunes, which leave him citizen of a country without liberty, without commerce, without money, without hope. He next pities his fellow-citizens, who are as desperately situated as himself. Then he pities the degradation, corruption, and despair into which the city has fallen. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> compassion is the most hopeless thing in his character. That alone is touched; that alone is moved; and when its impulse ceases he and every thing about him remain just as before.|$|E

Suddenly the object rushed at us. There was no noise of footsteps--only a muffled sound and a faint hissing. I stood still, unable to move. So did Jeff. I felt the hair of my head rising. Stumps gasped again--then turned and fled. The creature, whatever it was, brushed past us with a hideous laugh. I guessed at once that it was Jim Slagg, but evidently Stumps didn't, for he uttered an awful yell that would have roused the whole ship if she had been of an ordinary size; at the same moment he tripped and fell on the thing that had upset me, and the ghost, leaping over him, vanished from our sight.|$|E
6000|$|But if {{they pulled}} like mad, I wonder how our {{progress}} can be described? We fairly flew. So frightful was {{the speed with}} which we displaced the water, that a wave rose up on either side our bow and foamed aft in a series of three stiff, up-standing waves, while astern a great crested billow pursued us hungrily, as though at each moment it would fall aboard and destroy us. The Streak was pulsing and vibrating and roaring like a thing alive. The wind of our progress was like a gale--a forty-five-mile gale. We could not face it and draw breath without choking and strangling. It blew the smoke straight back from the mouths of the smoke-stacks at a direct right angle to the perpendicular. In fact, we were travelling as fast as an express train. [...] "We just STREAKED it," [...] was the way Charley told it afterward, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> description comes nearer than any I can give.|$|E

"He is with them," [...] Cneius said, [...] "but he is a chief, and if {{the tribe}} are in arms he is in arms also, and cannot, without risking the forfeit of his life for treachery, send hither a message that would put us on our guard. I believe in the lad. Four years <b>I</b> taught him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> know <b>his</b> nature. He is honest and true. He {{is one of the}} Iceni and must go with his countrymen; but I am sure he is {{grateful}} for the kindness he received here, and has a real affection for you, therefore I believe, that should my worst fears be verified, and the Iceni attack Camalodunum, he will do his utmost to save you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} Charles speak of him, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> much in <b>his</b> favour," [...] said Lady Deloraine; [...] "if he were here, {{he would tell}} us more about it.

6000|$|... "That {{suggests}} to me a consideration which seems overlooked," [...] said he. [...] "The interest of our client goes certainly before all, {{but the world}} does not {{come to an end}} with James Stewart." [...] Whereat he cocked his eye. [...] "I might condescend, exempli gratia, upon a Mr. George Brown, a Mr. Thomas Miller, and a Mr. David Balfour.

6000|$|... (M21) If we probe {{his fame}} as {{financier}} {{to the core}} and marrow, {{it was not his}} power as orator, it was not his ingenuity in device and expedient, it was his unswerving faith in certain fixed aims, and his steadfast and insistent zeal in pursuing them, that built up the splendid edifice. Pitt performed striking financial feats, especially in the consolidation of duties, in reformed administration, and in the French treaty of 1786. But ill-fortune dragged him into the vortex of European war, and finance sank into the place of a secondary instrument, an art for devising aliments, some of them desperate enough, for feeding the war-chest of the nation. Sir Robert Walpole, Mr. Gladstone wrote, “had not to contend with like difficulties, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> administration should be compared with the early years of Pitt, in which way of judging he would come off second, though a man of cool and sagacious judgment, while morally he stood low.”(40) ...|$|E
6000|$|My course {{about the}} Emperor {{has been a}} very simple one. It is not [...] for me to pass {{gratuitous}} opinions upon his character or that of [...] French institutions, or on his dealings with them. I believe him [...] to be firmly attached to the English alliance, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> [...] course towards us has been, on almost every occasion, marked by a [...] friendliness perhaps greater and more conspicuous than we have [...] always deserved at his hands. It is most painful to me to witness [...] his conduct with regard to Italy.... He conferred upon her in 1859 [...] an immense, an inestimable boon. He marred this boon in a way [...] which to me seemed little worthy of France by the paltry but [...] unkind appropriation of Nice in particular. But in the matter of [...] Rome he inflicts upon Italy a fearful injury. And I do not know by [...] what law of ethics any one is entitled to plead the having [...] conferred an unexpected boon, as giving a right to inflict a gross [...] and enduring wrong.(78) ...|$|E

"However, he's a good-natured old gentleman," [...] said John, [...] "and pays as a gentleman, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>his</b> word is to {{be relied}} upon, like a gentleman's.

I gave him information about my having two beats, you know, in my business; one day to the right from our house and back again; another day to the left from our house and back again (for he's a stranger, and don't know the names of places about here); and he seemed quite pleased. 'Why, then I shall be returning home to-night your way,' he says, 'when I thought you'd be coming in an exactly opposite direction. That's capital! I may trouble you for another lift, perhaps, but I'll engage not to fall so sound asleep again.' He was sound asleep, sure-ly!--Dot! what are you thinking of?" ...|$|E
