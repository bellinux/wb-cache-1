5|$|Although in the English {{language}} borscht refers <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> to a beet-based soup, in some culinary cultures {{there exist}} soups {{with the same}} or similar names where beetroots are absent or merely optional. The principal common trait among them is a tart flavor obtained by adding various sour-tasting ingredients.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the medieval}} Germanic languages, elf {{was one of}} the nouns that was used in {{personal}} names, <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> as a first element. These names may have been influenced by Celtic names beginning in Albio- such as Albiorix.|$|E
5|$|Except for {{the iron}} or steel {{included}} in the bridges and the water tower, the structures are built in brick or stone. The stone is <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> red sandstone, obtained from local quarries in the Runcorn, Weston, and Halton areas. Unless stated otherwise, the buildings (except the bridges and the water tower) are constructed in local red sandstone with slate roofs. Their locations {{can be found on}} the map of all coordinates.|$|E
5|$|My {{object in}} the present work is to paint the rich Jew in his true colors, as the enemy of society; {{to show that the}} Jew who steals millions, can, in Europe, at any rate, defy the laws with impunity, and that he <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> escapes {{punishment}} owing to improper occult influences, and the mighty power of Israelitish gold.|$|E
5|$|Eggs are <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> laid on plants. Each {{species of}} {{butterfly}} {{has its own}} host plant range and while some species of butterfly are restricted to just one species of plant, others use a range of plant species, often including members of a common family. In some species, such as the great spangled fritillary, the eggs are deposited close to {{but not on the}} food plant. This most likely happens when the egg overwinters before hatching and where the host plant loses its leaves in winter, as do violets in this example.|$|E
5|$|Medieval {{construction}} was seasonal, work on site being undertaken {{only in the}} spring and summer, when the light was good and the weather more reliable. Each autumn, all exposed surfaces were covered and lagged against frost damage. The architects worked over winter in the tracing house (that of York has both a fireplace and a privy) to prepare designs for the next season's campaign. They translated the designs into sets of planed oak cross-sectional templates, which were given to the stone-cutters. Construction of cathedrals and major churches <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> started at the eastern arm, and then proceeded westwards, with towers erected last.|$|E
5|$|After {{the virus}} enters the body {{there is a}} period of rapid viral replication, leading to an {{abundance}} of virus in the peripheral blood. During primary infection, the level of HIV may reach several million virus particles per milliliter of blood. This response is accompanied by a marked drop in the number of circulating CD4+ T cells. The acute viremia is <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> associated with activation of CD8+ T cells, which kill HIV-infected cells, and subsequently with antibody production, or seroconversion. The CD8+ T cell response is thought to be important in controlling virus levels, which peak and then decline, as the CD4+ T cell counts recover. A good CD8+ T cell response has been linked to slower disease progression and a better prognosis, though it does not eliminate the virus.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, the {{evidence}} suggests that Domitian did make concessions toward senatorial opinion. Whereas his father and brother had concentrated consular power largely {{in the hands of the}} Flavian family, Domitian admitted a surprisingly large number of provincials and potential opponents to the consulship, allowing them to head the official calendar by opening the year as an ordinary consul. Whether this was a genuine attempt to reconcile with hostile factions in the Senate cannot be ascertained. By offering the consulship to potential opponents, Domitian may have wanted to compromise these senators in the eyes of their supporters. When their conduct proved unsatisfactory, they were <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> brought to trial and exiled or executed, and their property was confiscated.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} fiction in Galaxy had dipped {{towards the end}} of Gold's editorship, and Pohl worked hard to restore the magazine's high standards. Gold's {{difficult}} editorial personality had driven away some of his contributors, but Pohl, who had worked as an agent in the 1950s, was a central figure in the sf community and was able to attract submissions from the star writers of his day. In the case of one of these stars, he offered an unusual arrangement: Robert Silverberg could write whatever he wished and Pohl promised that he would <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> buy it. Silverberg, who had been a high-volume producer of competent but unremarkable science fiction, began writing more ambitious work as a result, much of which was published in Galaxy throughout the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 8th century, sceattas were the primary {{circulating}} coinage. These were small silver pennies, which often did not bear the name of either the moneyer or the king for whom they were produced. To contemporaries these were probably known as pennies, and are the coins referred to in the laws of Ine of Wessex. This light coinage (in contrast to the heavier coins minted later in Offa's reign) can probably be dated to the late 760s and early 770s. A second, medium-weight coinage can be identified before the early 790s. These new medium-weight coins were heavier, broader and thinner than the pennies they replaced, and were prompted by the contemporary Carolingian currency reforms. The new pennies <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> carried both Offa's name {{and the name of the}} moneyer from whose mint the coins came. The reform in the coinage appears to have extended beyond Offa's own mints: the kings of East Anglia, Kent and Wessex all produced coins of the new heavier weight in this period.|$|E
5|$|World-class {{match play}} (i.e., {{a series of}} games between the same two opponents) often {{involves}} one or both players preparing one or two openings very deeply, and playing them repeatedly during the match. Preparation for such a match also involves analysis of those opening lines known to be played by the opponent. Fischer had been famous for his unusually narrow opening repertoire: for example, <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> playing 1. as White, and almost always playing the Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defence as Black against 1.e4. He surprised Spassky by repeatedly switching openings, and by playing openings that he had never, or only rarely, played before (such as 1. as White, and Alekhine's Defence, the Pirc Defence, and the Paulsen Sicilian as Black). Even in openings that Fischer had played before in the match, he continually deviated from the variations he had previously played, almost never repeating the same line twice in the match.|$|E
5|$|The {{geographical}} {{range of the}} quagga {{does not appear to}} extend to the northward of the river Vaal. The animal was formerly extremely common within the colony; but, vanishing before the strides of civilisation, is now to be found in very limited numbers and on the borders only. Beyond, on those sultry plains which are completely taken possession of by wild beasts, and may with strict propriety be termed the domains of savage nature, it occurs in interminable herds; and, although never intermixing with its more elegant congeners, it is <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> to be found ranging with the white-tailed gnu and with the ostrich, for the society of which bird especially it evinces the most singular predilection. Moving slowly across the profile of the ocean-like horizon, uttering a shrill, barking neigh, of which its name forms a correct imitation, long files of quaggas continually remind the early traveller of a rival caravan on its march. Bands of many hundreds are thus frequently seen doing their migration from the dreary and desolate plains of some portion of the interior, which has formed their secluded abode, seeking for those more luxuriant pastures where, during the summer months, various herbs thrust forth their leaves and flowers to form a green carpet, spangled with hues the most brilliant and diversified.|$|E
25|$|It {{is easy to}} {{tell who}} the bad guys are – they are <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> white, male, and middle-class or better, while the good guys are <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> non-white, non-male, or non-middle class.... Anglo-American civilization....is {{represented}} as patriarchal, racist, genocidal, and destructive of the environment, in addition to hypocritically betrayed the ideals on which it supposedly is built.|$|E
25|$|Whereas seated Olmec figures <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> {{have a broad}} base, this figure's base is {{narrow in}} {{proportion}} to its torso.|$|E
25|$|Although sucrose is <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> {{isolated}} from natural sources, its chemical synthesis was first achieved in 1953 by Raymond Lemieux.|$|E
25|$|Bone {{stocks for}} ramen are also often made with chicken stock, {{and it is}} <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> used in the less common kotteri variety.|$|E
25|$|There is <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> a {{secondary}} uveitis present with corneal ulceration, {{and signs of}} this may also be seen: miosis, corneal oedema, aqueous flare, hypopyon, IOP changes.|$|E
25|$|Class Jackets (Beer Jackets) – Each {{graduating class}} designs a Class Jacket that {{features}} its class year. The artwork is <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> {{dominated by the}} school colors and tiger motifs.|$|E
25|$|The global {{governing}} body of diving is FINA, which also governs swimming, synchronized swimming, water polo and open water swimming. <b>Almost</b> <b>invariably,</b> at national level, diving shares a {{governing body}} with the other aquatic sports.|$|E
25|$|When used to inflect an {{adjective}} or verb, okurigana can indicate aspect (perfective versus imperfective), affirmative {{or negative}} meaning, or grammatical politeness, {{among many other}} functions. In modern usage, okurigana are <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> written with hiragana; katakana were also commonly used in the past.|$|E
25|$|Endothelial {{injury is}} <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> {{involved}} {{in the formation of}} thrombi in arteries, as high rates of blood flow normally hinder clot formation. In addition, arterial and cardiac clots are normally rich in platelets–which are required for clot formation in areas under high stress due to blood flow.|$|E
25|$|Within {{the fictional}} {{universe}} of Star Trek, Klingon {{is derived from}} the original language spoken by the messianic figure Kahless the Unforgettable, who united the Klingon home-world of Qo’noS under one empire more than 1500 years ago. Many dialects exist, but the standardized dialect of prestige is <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> that of the sitting emperor.|$|E
25|$|Moynihan's {{research}} of Labor Department data demonstrated {{that even as}} fewer people were unemployed, more people were joining the welfare rolls. These recipients were families with children but only one parent (<b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> the mother). The laws at that time permitted such families to receive welfare payments {{in certain parts of}} the United States.|$|E
25|$|Other {{characteristics}} developed or transmuted {{in different}} contexts. From the earliest times, our sources associated wild men with hairiness; by the 12th century they were <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> {{described as having}} a coat of hair covering their entire bodies except for their hands, feet, faces above their long beards, and the breasts and chins of the females.|$|E
25|$|Every {{manufacturer}} published long {{lists of}} testimonials that described their product curing {{all sorts of}} human ailments. Fortunately for both makers and users, the illnesses they claimed were cured were <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> self-diagnosed – and {{the claims of the}} writers to have been healed of cancer or tuberculosis by the nostrum should be considered in this light.|$|E
25|$|The fell {{is usually}} climbed from New Dungeon Ghyll Hotel in Great Langdale, {{and there are}} a number of {{possible}} routes up. The simplest first follows Stickle Beck to Stickle Tarn; a path then leads up the western side of Pavey Ark to reach the summit. The fell is <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> combined with other nearby peaks to make a longer circular walk.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{most other}} {{particles}} in Arabic, al- is always prefixed to another word {{and it never}} stands alone. Consequently, most dictionaries will not list it as a separate word, and it is <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> ignored in collation. Similarly, al- is not a permanent component of the word {{to which it is}} prefixed. It is added and removed to toggle between the definiteness and indefiniteness of the word.|$|E
25|$|The age {{at which}} the disease most {{commonly}} starts is in women between 40 and 50 years of age, and for men somewhat later. RA is a chronic disease, and although rarely, a spontaneous remission may occur, the natural course is <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> one of the persistent symptoms, waxing and waning in intensity, and a progressive deterioration of joint structures leading to deformations and disability.|$|E
25|$|Canto-pop, {{also called}} HK-pop (Jyutping: Jyut6 jyu5 lau4 hang4 kuk1; Traditional Chinese: 粵語流行曲), is a genre of Cantonese music made {{primarily}} in Hong Kong. It is a pop subgenre, with influences from jazz, rock and roll, R, electronic music, dance music and others. It is <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> sung in Cantonese, boasting an international fanbase across Gwongdung, Gwongsai, Southeast Asia and (to a lesser extent) Korea and Japan.|$|E
25|$|The shell <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> has a {{circular}} opening {{over which the}} drumhead is stretched, but {{the shape of the}} remainder of the shell varies widely. In the western musical tradition, the most usual shape is a cylinder, although timpani, for example, use bowl-shaped shells. Other shapes include a frame design (tar, Bodhrán), truncated cones (bongo drums, Ashiko), goblet shaped (djembe), and joined truncated cones (talking drum).|$|E
25|$|Also, {{there exists}} a {{negative}} form for the word Mā (ما النافية). This Mā is a particle used to negate the perfect (past tense) verb. It <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> comes before such verbs. This Mā is sometimes followed by an imperfect verb. This has minor rhetorical considerations and is somewhat rare. Therefore, in most cases, one can interchangeably use Lā and Mā to convey negativness.|$|E
25|$|Insulin coma {{therapy was}} a {{labour-intensive}} treatment that required trained staff {{and a special}} unit. Patients, who were <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> diagnosed with schizophrenia, were {{selected on the basis}} of having a good prognosis and the physical strength to withstand an arduous treatment. There were no standard guidelines for treatment. Different hospitals and psychiatrists developed their own protocols. Typically, injections were administered six days a week for about two months.|$|E
25|$|Direct climbs of Rossett Pike are <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> made via {{one of the}} {{neighbouring}} passes. Rossett Gill provides the shorter route from Great Langdale, but the Stake is also perfectly practicable. From Stonethwaite in Borrowdale, Stake Pass is the primary means of ascent although Angle Tarn can also be reached. Rossett Pike is also popular as an indirect climb when taken as a top in the round of Great Langale, a long but glorious ridge walk.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the biblical text Vulgate editions <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> print 17 prologues, 16 of which were written by Jerome. Jerome's prologues were written {{not so much as}} prologues than as cover letters to specific individuals to accompany copies of his translations. Because they were not intended for a general audience, some of his comments in them are quite cryptic. These prologues are to the Pentateuch, to Joshua, and to Kings, which is also called the Prologus Galeatus.|$|E
25|$|Small populations {{winter in}} southeastern Florida {{and along the}} Texas coast, {{probably}} having failed to find the way south around the Gulf of Mexico. Individuals reported north of these areas in winter (for example, on Christmas Bird Counts) are <b>almost</b> <b>invariably</b> misidentified buteos of other species. Immature Swainson's hawks winter on the pampas of South America in Argentina, Uruguay, and southern Brazil. It is not known with certainty {{where most of the}} adults spend the winter.|$|E
