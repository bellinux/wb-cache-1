40|$|We {{explore the}} laser spot {{position}} (LSP) dependent photothermal mode cooling of a micro-cantilever in a Fabry-Pérot (FP) cavity. Depending on the LSP along the lever, photothermal coupling {{to the first}} two mechanical modes can be either parallel or anti-parallel. This LSP dependent behavior is analyzed theoretically by a simple model, which is in quantitatively agreement with our experimental observation. From simulation, the parallel and <b>anti-parallel</b> <b>coupling</b> region is identified along the lever. We conclude that a more efficient mode cooling may be achieved in the parallel coupling region. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract─A novel internally-coupled {{asymmetric}} stepped-impedance-resonator (SIR) filter {{is proposed}} in this paper. The asymmetric SIR structure not only effectively reduces the circuit size but also provides two transmission zeros near the lower and upper passband edges. The first transmission zero {{is due to}} the series resonance of the quarter-wavelength open stepped-impedance stub, and the second one is produced by <b>anti-parallel</b> <b>coupling</b> between adjacent SIRs. The filter response was simulated using the commercial software HFSS, and agreement between the measured and the simulated results was observed. A 0. 9 -dB insertion loss was achieved in the passband, thus indicating that the proposed filter structure is of practical value...|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{carried out}} {{measurements}} of domain wall (DW) velocities driven by magnetic field pulses in symmetric Pt/Co/Pt and asymmetric Pt/Co/AlOx, Pt/Co/GdOx and Pt/Co/Gd trilayers with ultrathin Co layers and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. In agreement with theoretical models, the maximum observed velocity {{is much larger}} in the asymmetric samples, where the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) stabilises chiral Néel walls, than in the symmetric stack. In addition, in Pt/Co/Gd very large DW speeds (up to 600 m/s) are obtained, 2. 5 times larger than in samples with oxidised Gd. Magnetic measurements reveal {{that this may be}} explained by the <b>anti-parallel</b> <b>coupling</b> between the magnetic moments of Gd and Co at the Gd/Co interface, leading to a decrease of the total magnetisation. In quantitative agreement with analytical models, in all samples the maximum observed DW speed scales as D/Ms, where D is the strength of the DMI and Ms the spontaneous magnetisation...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a two-level system coupled {{to a highly}} non-Markovian environment when the coupling axis rotates with time. The environment may be quantum (for example a bosonic bath or a spin bath) or classical (such as classical noise). We show that an Anderson orthogonality catastrophe suppresses transitions, so that the system's instantaneous eigenstates (parallel and <b>anti-parallel</b> to the <b>coupling</b> axis) can adiabatically follow the rotation. These states thereby acquire Berry phases; geometric phases given by the area enclosed by the coupling axis. Unlike in earlier proposals for environment-induced Berry phases, here there is little decoherence, so one does not need a decoherence-free subspace. Indeed we show that this Berry phase should be much easier to observe than a conventional one, {{because it is not}} masked by either the dynamic phase or the leading non-adiabatic phase. The effects that we discuss should be observable in any qubit device where one can drive three parameters in the Hamiltonian with strong man-made noise.

40|$|Spontaneous phase {{separation}} instabilities with {{the formation of}} various types of charge and spin pairing (pseudo) gaps in U> 0 Hubbard model including the next nearest neighbor coupling are calculated with the emphasis on the two-dimensional (square) lattices generated by 8 - and 10 -site Betts unit cells. The exact theory yields insights into the nature of quantum critical points, continuous transitions, dramatic {{phase separation}} instabilities and electron condensation in spatially inhomogeneous systems. The picture of <b>coupled</b> <b>anti-parallel</b> (singlet) spins and paired charged holes suggests full Bose condensation and coherent pairing in real space at zero temperature of electrons complied with the Bose-Einstein statistics. Separate pairing of charge and spin degrees at distinct condensation temperatures offers a new route to superconductivity different from the BCS scenario. The conditions for spin liquid behavior coexisting with unsaturated and saturated Nagaoka ferromagnetism due to spin-charge separation are established. The phase separation critical points and classical criticality found at zero and finite temperatures resemble a number of inhomogeneous, coherent and incoherent nanoscale phases seen near optimally doped high-T_c cuprates, pnictides and CMR nanomaterials...|$|R
40|$|A Mössbauer {{study of}} the three spin states of the reduced selenium-substituted 2 [4 Fe- 4 Se]+ {{ferredoxin}} from Clostridium pasteurianum was carried out at T = 1. 6 K, in perpendicular and parallel applied magnetic fields of up to 10 T. In low (0. 1 T) applied fields, the spectra of the classical S = 1 / 2 state exhibit magnetic hyperfine patterns arising from two pairs of iron atoms with opposite hyperfine fields. The S = 7 / 2 state is in the slow relaxation limit at T {{less than or equal}} to 4 K in the absence of applied field. The corresponding Mössbauer spectrum can be understood in terms of <b>anti-parallel</b> <b>coupling</b> between one high-spin Fe 3 + ion (Hhf = + 21. 2 T) and three high-spin Fe 2 + ions (Hhf,xy = - 25. 5 T, Hhf,z = - 28. 5 T). For the S = 3 / 2 spin state, the use of high (8 - 10 T) applied fields was necessary to ensure the validity of the high-field approximation and overcome the intercluster spin-spin interaction. The spectral data obtained under such conditions allowed the determination of the hyperfine field (- 4. 2 T) and a tentative estimation of the zero-field splitting (D approximately less than 3 cm- 1) ...|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{magnetic}} behaviour of thin film elements is of major importance for {{the magnetic}} sensor and storage industries, but also for fundamental micromagnetics. To store digital information, each memory element must support two distinct remanent magnetisation configurations that can be switched between using an applied field. In magnetoresistive random access memory (MRAM), a low switching field and reproducible reversal behaviour are desirable properties. The low field keeps the power consumption to a minimum and the reproducility enables efficient writing and read back of data. However, simple geometric structures are able to support a variety of metastable remanent configurations which can be problematic for device applications. For example, with rectangular elements, the switching fields are history dependent, {{and there is the}} possibility of flux-closure formation on repeated switching. This means different field strengths may be required to reverse the magnetisation of the same bit (binary digit) during different field cycles, and the information stored in a cell could be accidentally lost. In addition, the miniaturisation of these elements faces the problem that the coercivity is inversely proportional to element width for a given thickness; a factor which limits their use in high density arrays. The optimum geometry for supporting the stored information is therefore an important issue. In this thesis, different element shapes designed to tackle these problems have been investigated using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) backed by micromagnetic simulations. It has been found that variations in element geometry and symmetry can lead to a greater control of the states that can be formed. Alongside this work on patterned elements, continuous film multilayer samples in the form of magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) have also been studied. These multilayer structures serve as storage cells in MRAM devices so their successful operation is of the utmost importance to the development of this technology. At the most basic level, MTJs comprise two ferromagnetic layers separated by a layer of electrical insulator. Whilst one magnetic layer is fixed (pinned layer), the other is free to switch direction when an external field is applied (free layer). Ideally the free layer hysteresis loop would be centred at zero field, but because of magnetostatic interactions caused by layer roughness, the ferromagnets couple to one another and the hysteresis loop is offset. This shift means that the fields required to switch the cell in opposite directions are different. In collaboration with Philips Research in Eindhoven, the magnetic and physical structure of new MTJ stacks incorporating an artifical antiferromagnet (AAF) in the free layer were studied using TEM. An AAF consists of two ferromagnetic layers <b>coupled</b> <b>anti-parallel</b> through a thin layer of non-magnetic metal, typically Ru. These samples were found to reduce the offset field by up to 36 % when compared to the basic MTJ stack. Whilst this research is valuable to the magnetic storage industry, the information it provides on these complicated magnetic systems is equally beneficial for solid state physics.

40|$|Electronic {{structure}} of transition metal oxides {{has been a}} subject of intense research since decades due to the wide spectrum of properties that they exhibit, like high temperature superconductivity, metal-insulator transitions (MIT), phase separation etc. Among these, colossal magnetoresistance (CMR), i. e. {{a sharp drop in}} the electrical resistance by the application of an external magnetic field, is a property of fundamental and technological importance. In the present study we investigate several of these interesting properties ranging from colossal magnetoresistance, metal-insulator transitions and phase separation phenomena {{on a wide range of}} magnetoresistive systems. All these properties originate in transition metal oxides due to a competition between the strong inter-atomic Coulomb interaction strength within the transition metal d electrons and a large hopping interaction strength between the metal d and oxygen 2 p states. In this thesis we report the investigation of the electronic and magnetic structures of some magnetoresistive oxides, including various double perovskites and manganites, using various high energy spectroscopies in conjunction with various theoretical approaches. The samples for the present experimental investigation were prepared by different synthetic routes, such as solid state reaction, nitrate method, d. c arc melting and float zone method, and were characterized by x-ray diffraction, four probe resistivity, magnetic susceptibility, optical absorption and energy dispersive analysis of x-rays while some of the samples were supplied by our collaborators. Various spectroscopic techniques like x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy (UPS), bremsstrahlung isochromat spectroscopy (BIS), x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), x-ray magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy (XMCD), electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), spatially resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and M¨ ossbauer spectroscopy were used to probe the samples. Theoretical methods include configuration interaction cluster approach to ﬁt the XAS and XMCD spectra while ab initio band structure calculations along with the least-square fitting procedure was used to fit some of the valence and conduction bands. Following a general introduction in Chapter 1, the details of various experimental and theoretical techniques are discussed in Chapter 2 of this thesis. Recently, a double perovskite, Sr 2 FeMoO 6, belonging to a general family of halfmetallic ferromagnetic oxides, has shown a spectacularly large magnetoresistance even at the room temperature and at relatively small applied magnetic ﬁelds compared to the extensively investigated class of magnetoresistive manganites. Physical properties of this compound is strongly influenced by the Fe -Mo ordering. We hence synthesized Sr 2 FeMoO 6 sample, both with high and low degree of Fe/Mo ordering. Spectroscopic investigations of these samples suggest the presence of Fe rich and Mo rich domains of the type Sr 2 Fe 1 +xMo 1 −xO 6 in disordered Sr 2 FeMoO 6 at times. This prompted us to prepare bulk samples of Sr 2 Fe 1 +xMo 1 −xO 6. In Chapter 3 we address various issues related to Fe/Mo ordering like saturation magnetization, variation of TC, and CMR as well as oxidation state of Fe and Mo in Sr 2 FeMoO 6 using this new series, ”Sr 2 Fe 1 +xMo 1 −xO 6 ” as it offers a better control on the Fe/Mo bonds by controlling x. On the basis of the electron spectroscopic studies in conjunction with a configuration interaction cluster calculation model coupled with the conduction band, we claim that Fe remains in 3 +oxidation state throughout the series, where as Mo changes its valency to maintain the charge neutrality. An analysis of the magnetic momentas a function of x suggests that Fe at the ”wrong” crystallographic site is <b>coupled</b> <b>anti-parallel</b> to the Fe moments at the ”correct” site. Additionally, Mo depolarizes to the extend proportional to the number of Mo sites in the near-neighbor co-ordination shell. Continuing with the double perovskites in Chapter 4 we investigate the electronic and magnetic {{structure of}} Sr 2 FeMoO 6, Ca 2 FeMoO 6 and Ba 2 FeMoO 6 using XAS and XMCD studies. We find that the conventional XAS and XMCD calculations based on configuration interaction of a typical fragment, FeO 6 in this case, is insufficient to reproduce the experimental spectrum as the compounds considered here are metallic. In order to include the non local charge transfer, we coupled FeO 6 octahedra to a conduction band which mimics the Mo band. Within this model we obtained a good fit to the experimental spectrum. Chapter 5 deals with another series of double perovskite (Sr 1 −yCay) 2 FeReO 6 which exhibits a rich phase diagram since it undergoes a metal insulator transition (MIT) with composition at low temperatures. This system becomes more interesting due to the presence of a temperature driven MIT for higher y compositions. We find that the MIT is not related to the change in valency of Fe and Re. Analysis of the near Fermi edge valence band spectra suggests opening up of a soft gap. The main reason for MIT in this system is most likely the presence of strong electron-electron correlation between multiple electrons at the Re site, which is caused by the mismatch of the Re ionic radius and change in the crystal structure across MIT. Another issue which has been extensively investigated in this thesis is phase separation in manganites presented in Chapter 6. We use a spatially resolved, direct spectroscopic probe for electronic structure with an additional unique sensitivity to chemical compositions, to investigate high quality single crystal samples of La 1 / 4 Pr 3 / 8 Ca 3 / 8 MnO 3 in the first section. This unique probe establishes the formation of distinct insulating domains embedded in the metallic host at low temperatures, significantly in the absence of any perceptible chemical inhomogeneity, with the domain-size at least an order of magnitude larger than the previous largest estimate. We also provide compelling evidence of memory effects in such domain formation and morphology, suggesting an intimate connection between these electronic domains and long-range strains, often thought to be an important ingredient in the physics of doped manganites. In second part of this chapter we discuss another system namely Eu 0. 5 Y 0. 5 MnO 3 which undergoes a chemical phase separation forming alternate stripes of Eu rich (Y deficient) orthorhombic phase and Y rich (Eu deficient) hexagonal phases. These stripes are amazingly straight and run parallel over millimeters. One more system that we investigated is a mixture of ferromagnetic La 5 / 8 Sr 3 / 8 MnO 3 and insulating ferroelectric LuMnO 3 taken in ratio 3 : 7, here too the attempt to make a single crystal resulted into a chemical phase separation forming strips of metallic La 5 / 8 Sr 3 / 8 MnO 3 and insulating LuMnO 3 throughout the sample surface. Preliminary studies suggests that strain between the chemically and crystallographically different species may result into such interesting morphology. In Chapter 7 we study pseudo-one dimensional compounds Sr 3 CuIrO 6 and Sr 3 ZnIrO 6 using photo electron spectroscopy. The experimental results were fitted using band structure calculations with Full Potential Linearized Augmented Plane Wave (FP-LAPW) method...|$|R
