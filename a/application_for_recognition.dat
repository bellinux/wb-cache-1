50|$|After Fry {{founded the}} Omega Workshops in 1913, Grant became co-director with Vanessa Bell, {{who was then}} {{involved}} with Fry. Although Grant had always been actively homosexual, a relationship with Vanessa blossomed, which was both creative and personal, and he eventually {{moved in with her}} and her two sons by her husband Clive Bell. In 1916, in support of his <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>recognition</b> as a conscientious objector, Grant joined his new lover, David Garnett, in setting up as fruit farmers in Suffolk. Both their applications were initially unsuccessful, but eventually the Central Tribunal agreed to recognise them on condition of their finding more appropriate premises. Vanessa Bell found the house named Charleston near Firle in Sussex. Relationships with Clive Bell remained amicable, and Bell stayed with them for long periods fairly often - sometimes accompanied by his own mistress, Mary Hutchinson.|$|E

He had to repeat two school years, which put him in a class with Michael Breitkopf, with whom he founded Die Toten Hosen. Both finished secondary school in 1983. Campino did eight months military service in the Bundeswehr while his <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>recognition</b> as a conscientious objector was being processed, after which he was transferred to civilian duties within a psychiatric ward in Düsseldorf, together with friend Michael Breitkopf. From 1978 to 1982 he was the singer for the band ZK, and later founded Die Toten Hosen with Andreas von Holst, Michael Breitkopf, Andreas Meurer, Trini Trimpop and Walter November.

50|$|The NUJ {{contended that}} its <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>recognition</b> at the Racing Post {{newspaper}} was not inadmissible under the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, Schedule A1, paragraph 35. This prescribes that where a collective agreement is ‘already in force’ the procedure cannot take place. The Central Arbitration Committee had decided {{this was the}} situation since the Mirror News Group already had a recognition agreement with the British Association of Journalists. The BAJ formed in the early 1990s as a breakaway from the NUJ, but is independent and not affiliated to the Trades Union Congress. It signed an agreement for the Sports Division of the Mirror in 2003, shutting out the NUJ. They only had one member in the Sports Division. A {{majority of people in}} the bargaining unit were in favour of statutory recognition of the NUJ. The NUJ argued an agreement should not be considered ‘already in force’ for the purpose of paragraph 35, and in any case the CAC decision breached Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights and Article 14.|$|E
