40|$|Abstract. A {{low carbon}} steel is austenitized and isothermally held at 680 C to form <b>allotriomorphic</b> ferrite and {{followed}} by a holding at lower temperature to form bainite. The morphology of <b>allotriomorphic</b> ferrite/bainite interfaces is studied using optical microscope. Three kinds of combination are observed: Type I: interface on one side is clear while on the other side, unclear; Type II: unclear on both sides; Type III: clear on both sides. Clear interface indicates a large difference in the orientation between the bainite and the ferrite, and unclear interface, a very small difference. The statistical counting shows that the ratio of Type I is about 80 - 82 %, and that of Type II, 7 - 8 %, and Type III, 9 - 11 %. It is observed that this ratio does not change with the austenite grain size and bainite forming temperature. And the clear and unclear side of <b>allotriomorphic</b> ferrite may have different influence on the nucleation rate of bainite at allotriomorhic ferrite/prior austenite interface...|$|E

40|$|The present {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the theoretical and experimental study of the growth kinetics of <b>allotriomorphic</b> ferrite in medium carbon vanadium-titanium microalloyed steel. A theoretical model is presented in this work to calculate the evolution of austenite-to-allotriomorphic ferrite transformation with time at a very wide temperature range. At temperatures above eutectoid temperature, where <b>allotriomorphic</b> ferrite is the only austenite transformation product, the soft-impingement effect should be taken into account in the modeling. In that case, the Gilmour et al. analysis reliably predicts the progress of austenite-to-allotriomorphic ferrite transformation in this steel. By contrast, since pearlite acts as a carbon sink, the carbon enrichment of austenite due to the previous ferrite formation is avoided, and carbon concentration in austenite far from the α/γ interface remains the same as the overall carbon content of the steel. Hence, the soft-impingement effect should be neglected, and <b>allotriomorphic</b> ferrite is considered to grow under a parabolic law. Therefore, assumption of a semi-infinite extent austenite with constant boundary conditions is suitable for the kinetics of the isothermal decomposition of austenite. An excellent agreement (higher than 93 pct in R 2) has been obtained between the experimental and predicted values of the volume fraction of ferrite in all of the ranges of temperature studied.

40|$|Non-metallic {{inclusions}} {{are known}} to influence the properties of low alloy steel weld metal by altering the microstructure development. Isothermal transformation kinetics of austenite to acicular ferrite and <b>allotriomorphic</b> ferrite were measured in reheated low alloy steel weld deposits with similar weld compositions and austenite grain size but different inclusion characteristics. Accelerated kinetics of the transformation to acicular ferrite were observed in the weld metal containing coarser titanium-rich inclusions. The results are also discussed {{in relation to the}} predictions of inclusion model. The kinetics of the transformation to <b>allotriomorphic</b> ferrite were not influenced by a change in the inclusion characteristics, but, rather, by a change in austenite grain size. A theoretical analysis of austenite grain development during weld cooling is considered in this work.

40|$|Steels with yield {{strengths}} {{in excess of}} 1000 MPa are important in certain applications, but the biggest commercial markets are for lower strength varieties, where the total alloy content rarely exceeds 2 wt%. The alloy design therefore {{has to be careful}} with a proper balance of hardenability in the context of large scale steel production technologies. Lean steels tend to transform into mixtures of <b>allotriomorphic</b> ferrite and bainite, whereas any attempt to improve hardenability usually leads to partly martensitic microstructures. The solution therefore lies in low-alloy, low-carbon steels, containing small amounts of boron and molybdenum to suppress <b>allotriomorphic</b> ferrite formation, principles established originally by Irvine and Pickering. Boron increases the bainitic hardenability. Other solute additions can, in the presence of boron, be kept at suf®ciently low concentrations to avoid the formation of martensite. Steels like these (Alloy 1, Table 13. 1), when normalised, are found to transform almost completely into bainite with only small fractions of martensite or other residual phases...|$|E

Hence, the soft-impingement effect should be neglected, and <b>allotriomorphic</b> and idiomorphic ferrite is considered to grow under a parabolic law. The nature, size and distribution of the inclusions which are responsible of the intra-granular nucleation of idiomorphic ferrite have been considered in this study.

40|$|We {{have used}} {{transmission}} electron microscopy (TEM) and nanoindentation to characterize the dominant phases present in the weld zone of a diode-laser-welded transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) steel, examining the unaffected base metal as a baseline. The microstructure of the base metal consists predominantly of ferrite, retained austenite, martensite, and occasional large carbide particles. The dominant microstructure of the weld zone is of differently oriented packets having a bainitic morphology. The weld also contains <b>allotriomorphic</b> ferrite, idio-morphic ferrite, as well some twinned martensite that is surrounded by austenite. The TEM analysis of the bainitic-morphology packets indicates that they consist of a lath ferrite phase separated by an interlath carbon-enriched retained austenite. In most cases, the orientation relationship (OR) between the lath ferrite and the interlath retained austenite can be approxi-mated as Nishiyama–Wasserman (N-W). We used site-specific nanoindentation to further characterize the packets and the <b>allotriomorphic</b> ferrite, confirming through the hardness values the conclusions reached by TEM.

In the Ni-based alloy 625, the thermo-mechanically affected zone (TMAZ) showed deformed grains and redistribution of precipitates. In the SZ, the high deformation and temperature produced a recrystallised microstructure, as well as fracture and redistribution of MC precipitates.

40|$|A {{hypoeutectoid}} alloy (carbon composition {{less than}} eutectoid). The first phase formed upon cooling from the austenite phase field is proeutectoid ferrite. Due {{to the lower}} solubility of carbon in ferrite, carbon is partitioned into the remaining austenite. At the eutectoid point the remaining carbon enriched austenite transforms to pearlite (a mixture of ferrite and cementite) which is the darker region of the micrograph. The proportion of pearlite is dependent upon the overall composition. The ferrite (light areas) {{is a good example}} of an <b>allotriomorphic</b> ferrite. This means that its shape does not reflect its internal crystalline symmetry as it nucleates on the austenite grain boundaries and hence follows the shape of the boundaries, the remaining austenite within the ferrite then transforms to pearlite, and is surrounded by the ferrite. ...|$|E

In this sense, the isothermal decomposition of austenite in <b>allotriomorphic</b> and idiomorphic ferrite for two medium carbon steels microalloyed with vanadium and titanium have been studied.

40|$|This is a {{hypoeutectoid}} alloy, {{which has}} been air cooled from the austenite phase field at 950 °C. The first solid to form is proeutectoid ferrite, its morphology being determined by the cooling rate. At slow cooling rates (furnace cooling) there is sufficient time for the carbon rejected from the austenite to diffuse and equilibrium solidification occurs. With faster cooling the microstructure also depends on the original austenite grain size. Fast cooling and large grain size favours ferrite forming as Widmanstätten side plates from the grain boundaries. Small grain sizes imply {{a high number of}} nuclei and hence the ferrite grows as grain boundary allotriomorphs. In this case air cooling is sufficiently slow to produce <b>allotriomorphic</b> ferrite. The majority of the austenite has changed to ferrite leaving only a small amount to be transformed to pearlite, therefore the microstructure shows large ferrite grains with small islands of pearlite. ...|$|E

Such a procedure can be made easier by the availability of a good method for calculating the transformation characteristics of a steel as a function of its chemical composition, austenite grain structure and cooling conditions. We present here a method for doing so using simultaneous transformation theory and mechanistic models for <b>allotriomorphic</b> and idiomorphic ferrite, Widmanstätten ferrite, pearlite, bainite, martensite and retained austenite.
