5|$|The most {{frequent}} {{mode of transmission}} of HIV is through sexual contact with an infected person. Globally, the most common mode of HIV transmission is via sexual contacts between people of the opposite sex; however, the pattern of transmission varies among countries. As of 2014, most HIV transmission in the United States occurred among men who had sex with men (83% of new HIV diagnoses among males aged 13 and older and 67% of total new diagnoses). In the US, gay <b>and</b> <b>bisexual</b> men aged 13 to 24 accounted for an estimated 92% of new HIV diagnoses among all men in their age group and 27% of new diagnoses among all gay <b>and</b> <b>bisexual</b> men. About 15% of gay <b>and</b> <b>bisexual</b> men have HIV while 28 percent of transgender women test positive in the US.|$|E

5|$|Anxiety {{disorders}} and depression {{are the most}} common mental health issues for women. Depression is reported among lesbians at a rate similar to heterosexual women, although generalized anxiety disorder is more likely to appear among lesbian <b>and</b> <b>bisexual</b> women than heterosexual women. Depression is a more significant problem among women who feel they must hide their sexual orientation from friends and family, or experience compounded ethnic or religious discrimination, or endure relationship difficulties with no support system. Men's shaping of women's sexuality has proven to have an effect on how lesbians see their own bodies. Studies have shown that heterosexual men and lesbians have different standards for what they consider attractive in women. Lesbians who view themselves with male standards of female beauty may experience lower self-esteem, eating disorders, and higher incidence of depression. More than half the respondents to a 1994 survey of health issues in lesbians reported they had suicidal thoughts, and 18% had attempted suicide.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{views on}} {{sexuality}} vary, and have differed by historical period and by cultural context. Feminist attitudes to female sexuality {{have taken a}} few different directions. Matters such as the sex industry, sexual representation in the media, and issues regarding consent to sex under conditions of male dominance have been particularly controversial among feminists. This debate has culminated in the late 1970s and the 1980s, in {{what came to be}} known as the feminist sex wars, which pitted anti-pornography feminism against sex-positive feminism, and parts of the feminist movement were deeply divided by these debates. Feminists have taken a variety of positions on different aspects of the sexual revolution from the 1960s and 70s. Over the course of the 1970s, a large number of influential women accepted lesbian <b>and</b> <b>bisexual</b> women as part of feminism.|$|E
5|$|The {{result of}} the lack of medical {{information}} on WSW is that medical professionals and some lesbians perceive lesbians as having lower risks of acquiring sexually transmitted diseases or types of cancer. When women do seek medical attention, medical professionals often fail to take a complete medical history. In a recent study of 2,345 lesbian <b>and</b> <b>bisexual</b> women, only 9.3% had claimed they had ever been asked their sexual orientation by a physician. A third of the respondents believed disclosing their sexual history would result in a negative reaction, and 30% had received a negative reaction from a medical professional after identifying themselves as lesbian or bisexual. A patient's complete history helps medical professionals identify higher risk areas and corrects assumptions about the personal histories of women. In a similar survey of 6,935 lesbians, 77% had had sexual contact with one or more male partners, and 6% had that contact within the previous year.|$|E

In a survey conducted in the USA in 1985, about half of the men considered bondage erotic, but according to the 1993 publication Janus Report on Sexual Behavior, only 11% of the representatives had had practical experiences of bondage.|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} on attitudes toward lesbians, gays, <b>and</b> <b>bisexuals</b> {{has focused on}} the role of various demographic factors in predicting attitudes. At the same time, much of the {{literature on}} sexual socialization has attempted to document the contribution of formative communications and experiences to individuals’ current sexual attitudes. This dissertation bridges both bodies of literature by examining the contribution of the early messages that individuals received regarding homosexuality to their current attitudes toward lesbians, gays, <b>and</b> <b>bisexuals.</b> Study 1 was based on semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 21 emerging adults (ages 18 - 24) from a large public Midwestern university. The primary goal {{of the study was to}} explore the content of the messages that participants received from multiple sources (parents, peers, community members) about homosexuality and bisexuality. Findings revealed that participants received few messages about bisexuality but numerous messages regarding the nature of homosexuality, and concerning the acceptance or disapproval of homosexuality within their close social networks (peers and family) and within the broader society. Study 2 was quantitative study based on 429 emerging adults (55 % female) from a large public Midwestern university. The study assessed emerging adults’ exposure to messages about homosexuality from their parents and peers. Male sources provided more negative messages about homosexuality than did female sources, and female sources provided more positive messages than did male sources. The study also found that multiple demographic factors, such as gender, age, race, religious service attendance, country of upbringing, and parent education level, were correlated with levels and types of messages communicated. Study 3 assessed the contribution of early messages about homosexuality to current attitudes about lesbians, gays, <b>and</b> <b>bisexuals</b> among heterosexual emerging adults. The study was based on data from 410 heterosexual participants from Study 2. Positive peer messages were a key factor in emerging adults’ later attitudes. Exposure to positive messages from peers was associated with greater comfort with lesbians, gays, <b>and</b> <b>bisexuals</b> <b>and</b> stronger endorsement of equal rights for lesbians, gays, <b>and</b> <b>bisexuals.</b> Positive peer messages were also associated with less hostility toward lesbians, gays, <b>and</b> <b>bisexuals...</b>|$|R

The present study examines sexual orientation by sexual behaviors, attractions, identity, fantasies, and an omnibus item. The study consisted of 863 college students. Half of the measures assessed hypersexuality and the other half-assessed psychopathologies. A series of multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) assessed the relationship between sexual orientation, hypersexuality, and psychopathologies. The present study found no differences between male heterosexuals <b>and</b> male <b>bisexuals</b> across any of the measures; however, differences were found between female heterosexuals <b>and</b> female <b>bisexuals.</b> Honors College"PSYSC 499.
