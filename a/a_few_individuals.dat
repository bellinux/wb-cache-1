5|$|Both {{resident}} and transient orangutans aggregate on large fruiting trees to feed. The fruits {{tend to be}} abundant, so competition is low and individuals may engage in social interactions. Orangutans will also form travelling groups with members moving between different food sources. These groups tend {{to be made of}} only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>individuals.</b> They also tend to be consortships between an adult male and female.|$|E
5|$|In {{a school}} of Pacific blue-eyes that is threatened, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>individuals</b> {{accelerate}} and change direction, which initiates an escape wave that spreads through the whole cohort. Animals are known to dart in random directions and speeds as an escape response when threatened. Pacific blue-eyes on their own dart in this manner for up to ten seconds after being faced with a threat at close range. This period is briefer when faced with more distant threats or for fish in schools.|$|E
5|$|If {{used as a}} {{space for}} rituals, the Hampton Down circle would have only been able to {{accommodate}} <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>individuals</b> standing within it at any given time. It was also not the site of any cremation deposits, unlike some stone circles in Northern Britain. Burl suggested that the Hampton Down Stone Circle may never {{have been part of}} the prehistoric stone circle tradition, but that the stones were actually once the kerbstones of a round barrow. To support this suggestion, he noted that round barrows were known at Poole, around 20 miles (32 kilometres) to the east of the site.|$|E

5|$|Mírzá Husayn `Alí Núrí {{was one of}} {{the early}} {{followers}} of the Báb, and later took the title of Bahá'u'lláh. Bábís faced a period of persecution that peaked in 1852-53 after <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>individuals</b> made a failed attempt to assassinate the Shah. Although they acted alone, the government responded with collective punishment, killing many Bábís. Bahá'u'lláh was put in prison. He claimed that in 1853, while incarcerated in the dungeon of the Síyáh-Chál in Tehran, he received the first intimations that he was the one anticipated by the Báb when he received a visit from the Maid of Heaven.|$|E
5|$|Smeerenburg {{was one of}} {{the first}} settlements, {{established}} by the Dutch in 1619. Smaller bases were also built by the English, Danish and French. At first the outposts were merely summer camps, but from the early 1630s, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>individuals</b> started to overwinter. Whaling at Spitsbergen lasted until the 1820s, when the Dutch, British and Danish whalers moved elsewhere in the Arctic. By the late 17th century, Russian hunters arrived; they overwintered to a greater extent and hunted land mammals such as the polar bear and fox. After British raids into the Barents Sea in 1809, Russian activity on Svalbard diminished, and ceased by the 1820s. Norwegian hunting—mostly for walrus—started in the 1790s. The first Norwegian citizens to reach Spitsbergen proper were a number of Coast Sámi people from the Hammerfest region, who were hired as part of a Russian crew for an expedition in 1795. Norwegian whaling was abandoned about the same time as the Russians left, but whaling continued around Spitsbergen until the 1830s, and around Bjørnøya until the 1860s.|$|E
5|$|The ribs were {{connected}} to the dorsal (trunk) vertebrae with two joints, acting together as a simple hinge joint, which has allowed researchers to reconstruct the inhaled and exhaled positions of the ribcage. The difference in volume between these two positions defines the air exchange volume (the amount of air moved with each breath), determined to be approximately 20L for a P.engelhardti individual estimated to have weighed690kg, or 29mL/kg bodyweight. This is a typical value for birds, but not for mammals, and indicates that Plateosaurus probably had an avian-style flow-through lung, although indicators for postcranial pneumaticity (air sacs of the lung invading the bones to reduce weight) {{can be found on}} the bones of only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>individuals,</b> and were only recognized in 2010. Combined with evidence from bone histology this indicates that Plateosaurus was endothermic.|$|E

25|$|In 1973 and 1974, the Soviet media {{campaign}} continued, targeting both Sakharov and Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. While Sakharov disagreed with Solzhenitsyn's vision of Russian revival, he deeply respected {{him for his}} courage. Only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>individuals</b> in the Soviet Union were willing to defend 'traitors' like Sakharov and Solzhenitsyn, {{and those who had}} dared were inevitably punished.|$|E

25|$|Amur Valley Ainu (probably none remain): <b>A</b> <b>few</b> <b>individuals</b> {{married to}} ethnic Russians and ethnic Ulchi {{reported}} by Bronisław Piłsudski {{in the early}} 20th century. Only 26 pure-blooded individuals were recorded during the 1926 Russian Census in Nikolaevski Okrug (present-day Николаевский район Nikolaevskij Region/District). Probably assimilated into the Slavic rural population. Although no one identifies as Ainu nowadays in Khabarovsk Krai, there are {{a large number of}} ethnic Ulch with partial Ainu ancestry.|$|E
25|$|P. sericea colonies {{can range}} from <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>individuals,</b> to a few thousand, but are {{typically}} made up of several hundred workers. The number of queens in a nest {{can range from}} one to several queens. New colonies are founded by swarming emigration, where the entire colony travels to a new nest site. This may happen when a nest becomes unsuitable for living or when a predator attacks the nest and forces the colony to leave.|$|E
25|$|The species often forms {{schools of}} {{variable}} sizes ranging from <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>individuals</b> to several hundred. The species is also highly migratory, and biochemical {{studies on the}} species {{have shown that the}} muscles contain unusually high levels of a fatty acid called DHA. The reason for this is probably that the muscle is also low in lipids due to accumulation of these in other organs. Other migratory fishes such as tuna also have this adaptation, suggesting it is a convergent trait.|$|E

25|$|Huddling: Prolonged {{physical}} contact or huddling also serves social integration. Huddling promotes heat exchange, {{together with the}} transfer of olfactory or tactile information. Some organisms live in constant contact in a colony, for example colonial corals. When individuals are linked tightly in this way an entire colony can react on the aversive or alarm movements made by only <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>individuals.</b> In several herbivorous insect nymphs and larvae, aggregations where there is prolonged contact {{play a major role}} in group coordination. These aggregations may take the form of a procession or a rosette.|$|E
25|$|By Biblical law, Jews who {{own land}} are {{required}} to make their land available during the Shmita to anyone who wishes {{to come in and}} harvest. If the land is fenced etc., gates must be left open to enable entrance. These rules apply to all outdoor agriculture, including private gardens and even outdoor potted plants. Plants inside a building are exempt. However, the Rabbis of the Mishna and Jerusalem Talmud imposed rabbinic ordinances on harvesters to ensure an orderly and equitable process and to prevent <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>individuals</b> from taking everything. Harvesters on others' land are permitted to take only enough to feed themselves and their families.|$|E
