25|$|Simply put, {{the test}} is that one must universalize the maxim (imagine that all people acted in this way) <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>see</b> if {{it would still be}} {{possible}} to perform the maxim in the world without contradiction. In Groundwork, Kant gives the example of a person who seeks to borrow money without intending to pay it back. This is a contradiction because if it were a universal action, no person would lend money anymore as he knows that he will never be paid back. The maxim of this action, says Kant, results in a contradiction in conceivability (and thus contradicts perfect duty).|$|E

Rabbi Berekiah said in Rabbi Abba's name that God told Noah to take that back, because the world would need ravens in the future. Noah asked God when the world would need ravens.

But Rabbi Nehemiah insisted that [...] literally meant ravens, and the ravens brought Elijah food from King Jehoshaphat's table.|$|E
