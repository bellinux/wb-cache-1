5|$|Pearl {{returns to}} her {{penthouse}} apartment. She is visited by Captain Steel, {{who says he has}} been thinking about her recently and regrets their breakup. When he says that he still loves her and {{would like to have a}} relationship with her again, Pearl declines. The next night, she goes to a nightclub with Olivia and Jennifer. They have fun joking about the fortunes, and Pearl admits she is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>sad</b> hers did not come true. Pearl goes to a coffee house and cries when the fortune's deadline passes without anyone talking to her. Friday morning, Pearl is leaving for work when she meets a man who is about to knock on her door. He says he works at the coffee house she visited, and that she left her wallet behind. After a conversation, Pearl and the man arrange a date.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Zack Handlen gave [...] "Family" [...] {{a rating}} of A for The A.V. Club. He said it was [...] "one of the best hours TNG has ever done", saying that the Picard scenes were the highlights. He called the scenes where Picard confesses his {{feelings}} about the Borg to Robert his favourite of [...] "all Stewart's amazing acting moments on the show so far". He summed up [...] "Family", saying [...] "It's also a remarkable episode, thoughtful, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>sad,</b> {{but in the end}} full of hope. The final shot shows Picard's nephew dreaming under the stars. Like much of this episode, it could've been corny. And like all of this episode, it isn't." [...] "Family" [...] was included in a top ten list of the non-typical best episodes of the series by Carol Pinchefsky for Forbes; she called the scene where Picard admits his feelings towards the Borg as the highlight of the episode.|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{were unhappy}} {{with most of}} the {{marriage}} storyline that involved Will, though they seemed satisfied with Emma's portion of it. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club said Will acted like a [...] "jackass" [...] throughout and called the storyline [...] "so pathetic and sad", words echoed by Entertainment Weekly Joseph Brannigan Lynch, who wrote, [...] "When Schue told New Directions, 'You guys are my family,' I was <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>sad</b> for him and a lotta sad for his parents." [...] John Kubicek of BuddyTV proclaimed, [...] "Will desperately needs to make some grown-up friends", a sentiment echoed by HuffPost TV Crystal Bell. Lynch was critical of the scene where Will tells Emma they cannot marry because of her illness: he felt [...] "using the phrase 'it's hopeless' in reference to her mental disorder" [...] was too extreme. To James Poniewozik of Time, the episode showed [...] "how the series has squandered the opportunity to make Will into a person".|$|E

They had never spoken of it since, it was such <b>a</b> <b>sad</b> <b>little</b> ring. <b>Sad!</b> It {{was not in the}} least <b>little</b> bit <b>sad.</b> Grizel {{wondered}} as she looked at it now how she could ever have thought it sad.|$|R

500|$|... "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] has {{received}} generally positive reviews from critics. The Daily Mail {{cited as a}} [...] "superb" [...] and [...] "hilarious" [...] episode, and James Plath of DVD Town thought it had strong writing. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "a terrific episode, full of wit and sly digs at our expectations of Homer's abilities. The fact that he invents things that other people find useful (and steal the credit for) is both amusing and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>sad.</b> Poor Homer." [...] Writing for DVD Movie Guide, Colin Jacobson commented that [...] "though 'Wizard' borders on 'Homer’s wacky scheme' territory, his attempts {{to come up with}} something significant offer amusement. At no point does 'Wizard' threaten to become a particularly strong episode, but it entertains to a reasonable degree. I do like the 'Everything’s Okay Alarm' and the makeup gun, though." ...|$|E
500|$|Emerson saw a kindred {{spirit in}} Very and defended his sanity. As {{he wrote to}} Margaret Fuller, [...] "Such a mind cannot be lost". Emerson was {{sympathetic}} with Very's plight because he himself had recently been ostracized after his controversial lecture, the [...] "Divinity School Address". He helped Very publish a small volume, Essays and Poems in 1839. The poems collected in this volume were chiefly Shakespearean sonnets. Very also published several poems in the Western Messenger between 1838 and 1840 {{as well as in}} The Dial, the journal of the Transcendentalists. He was disappointed, however, that Emerson, serving as editor of the journal, altered his poems. Very wrote to Emerson in July 1842, [...] "Perhaps they were all improvements but I preferred my own lines. I do not know but I ought to submit to such changes as done by the rightful authority of an Editor but I felt <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>sad</b> at the aspect of the piece." [...] He was never widely read, and was largely forgotten {{by the end of the}} nineteenth century, but in the 1830s and 1840s the Transcendentalists, including Emerson, as well as William Cullen Bryant, praised his work.|$|E
500|$|In May 2007 Time {{magazine}} ran {{an article}} by James Poniewozik titled [...] "Is Shrek Bad for Kids?" [...] which considered the negative effects on children of being raised with fairy tale satires, instead of the original stories. Poniewozik mentioned Hoodwinked! writing, [...] "I thought Hoodwinked! {{and most of the}} Shrek series were hilarious... But even if you ultimately reject their messages, old-school fairy tales are part of our cultural vocabulary. There's something <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>sad</b> about kids growing up in a culture where their fairy tales come pre-satirized, the skepticism, critique and revision having been done for them by the mama birds of Hollywood." [...] Cory Edwards wrote into the magazine, expressing his similar sentiments and writing, [...] "As the writer-director of Hoodwinked, it may surprise you that I couldn't agree more with James Poniewozik's article. Even as I was making the film, I asked myself the same question: Are we parodying something that kids should have the chance to experience first, 'un-parodied?' We {{went to great lengths to}} distance our film from Shreks humor (and no, I don't think Shrek considers kids). I would hope that Hoodwinked and its sequels will be seen as trying to do something genuine with its characters, rather than look for the next joke at the expense of innocence. We ALL need the real folklore of fairytales, whether we admit it or not." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Louboutins" [...] {{received}} mixed reception from critics. Elana Gorgan of Softpedia {{focused on}} the single cover and concept of the song. She said [...] "While {{the idea of the}} track is original, critics and fans alike say, the artwork is lackluster at best... There is a certain old vibe to the cover, what with the font of the writing and the shot in itself, but it's not helping the singer in any way garner much interest in the release." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly said [...] " [...] does for the ultra high-end shoe brand what Crocs do for sexy." [...] She pointed out how the song was not as good as Lopez's previous material and at one point even called the song [...] "Poo". Further to this, Peter Gicas of E! Online was also critical of the song, suggesting that the song leaked online before its official debut to warn fans of what Lopez was about to inflict on them. [...] "The track begins with the singer insisting, [...] "I'm taking back my love." [...] Personally, we wish we could take back the last three minutes and 49 seconds." [...] Tom Stacks of Entertainment Weekly was less than impressed saying [...] "J. Lo needs to move on from her recording career. She had some fun, catchy songs ('If You Had My Love,' 'Love Don't Cost a Thing'), but trying to regain musical relevance by singing about pricey high-heels just seems <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>sad.</b> I say focus on getting the movie career back on track..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Richard Corliss {{also notes}} that the song was even more {{significant}} having been released soon after America entered World War II: [...] "connected with... GIs in their first winter away from home. To them it voiced the ache of separation and the wistfulness they felt for the girl back home, for the innocence of youth...." [...] Poet Carl Sandburg wrote, [...] "We have learned to be <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>sad</b> and a little lonesome without being sickly about it. This feeling is caught in the song of a thousand jukeboxes and tune whistled in streets and homes. [...] "I'm Dreaming of a White Christmas'. When we sing that we don't hate anybody. And {{there are things we}} love that we're going to have sometimes if the breaks are not too bad against us. Way down under this latest hit of his, Irving Berlin catches us where we love peace." ...|$|E
2500|$|As Fox greenlit {{the show}} in 2011 and ordered an initial 13 episodes, Meriwether {{approached}} Jake Kasdan, whom she admired {{for his work on}} Freaks and Geeks blending comedy and emotion, to shoot the pilot and subsequent episodes. 30 Rock Brett Baer and Dave Finkel became co-showrunners, although Meriwether is still regarded as the voice behind New Girl. According to The New Republic, Kasdan [...] "helped develop the feel of the show, which is lit more darkly and cinematically than the average sitcom", and Meriwether found the show working best [...] "when you're laughing, but you're <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>sad</b> about it". The show attempts to combine [...] "comedy and drama as the five characters explore the difficulties of the decade between 30 and 40, which is when many people take their biggest steps toward maturity" [...] in regards to relationships and careers, which, unlike Friends, is giving the show a [...] "built-in biological clock". Kasdan said that [...] "Their lives are moving forward, [...] they're still trying to hang on to some kind of crazy youth" [...] although he does not [...] "want them ever to seem pathetic." ...|$|E
