Over 198 tonnes, however, had been entrusted to the Banque de France before the war, <b>and</b> <b>shipped</b> <b>to</b> Dakar in French West Africa. Under the pro-German Vichy régime, the gold was seized by the Germans, who used it to buy munitions from neutral Switzerland and Sweden.|$|E

Florida State University faculty members collaborated in the design, construction and operation of the LHC, with some components assembled at Florida State <b>and</b> <b>shipped</b> <b>to</b> CERN for installation.

5|$|In 2002, in {{the lead}} up to Manchester hosting the Commonwealth Games, a {{requirement}} to increase capacity on for the event led to Metrolink investigating the purchase of redundant second-hand USSLRV vehicles from the Muni Metro system in San Francisco.

5|$|Individual quaggas {{were also}} {{captured}} <b>and</b> <b>shipped</b> <b>to</b> Europe, {{where they were}} displayed in zoos. Lord Morton tried to save the animal from extinction by starting a captive breeding program. He was only able to obtain a single male which, in desperation, he bred with a female horse. This produced a female hybrid with zebra stripes on its back and legs. Lord Morton's mare was sold and was subsequently bred with a black stallion, resulting in offspring that again had zebra stripes. An account of this was published in 1820 by the Royal Society. This led to new ideas on telegony, referred to as pan-genesis by Charles Darwin.|$|E

The farm was progressive, with sterile conditions, numerous employee benefits, good living conditions for livestock, and regular veterinary inspections to maintain a healthy herd. The farm also made use of tenant farming, established working blacksmith, wheelwright, and harness shops on-site, was located around Walter Law's manor house, and constructed numerous buildings in the Tudor Revival architectural style.|$|E
5|$|U-17 {{was ordered}} by the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 1 April 1915 and laid down at AG Weser in Bremen later that month.

After completing the four-day journey, the sections were riveted together. Though there is no specific mention of {{how long it took}} for U-17s sections to be assembled, a sister boat, the German Type UB I submarine UB-3, shipped to Pola from Germany in mid-April 1915, was assembled in about two weeks. U-17 was delivered to the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 30 September.|$|E

5|$|New {{industry}} {{came from}} iron ore, {{discovered in the}} north, mined relatively easily from open pits, <b>and</b> <b>shipped</b> <b>to</b> Great Lakes steel mills from the ports at Duluth and Two Harbors. Economic development and social changes led to an expanded role for state government and a population shift from rural areas to cities. The Great Depression brought layoffs in mining and tension in labor relations but New Deal programs helped the state. After World War II, Minnesota became known for technology, fueled by early computer companies Sperry Rand, Control Data and Cray.

SAO Krajina forces captured Hrvatska Dubica the same day, and Topusko fell on 14 September.
