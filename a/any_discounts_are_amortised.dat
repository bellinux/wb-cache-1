40|$|A {{well-known}} {{common agreement}} in decision {{theory is that}} only exponential decision makers are time consistent i. e. with the mere passage of time, future choices must not contradict the initial choice. Building on this result, a large range of works has studied time inconsistency as a direct application of hyperbolic discounting. These articles share the common objective time assumption under which decision makers have a perfect perception of future periods. This paper firstly highlights that, when no further condition than separability <b>is</b> mentioned, <b>any</b> <b>discount</b> mechanism <b>is</b> compatible with time consistency. Then, we investigate time consistency assuming that individual time perception may be submitted to time distortion. In particular, an axiomatic discounting model called Subjective <b>Discounted</b> Utility (SDU) <b>is</b> provided to illustrate how hyperbolic decision makers may be time consistent...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The paper {{studied and}} {{discussed}} The Faustmann Method (Land Expected Value- LEV) comparing it with The Net Discounted Value project evaluation criterion, in an infinite horizon (NDV). The method {{was applied for}} determining land value, envisaging eucalyptus plantation in savannah area (cerrado) in Brazil, {{for the purpose of}} charcoal production. For the same situation the Net <b>Discounted</b> Value <b>was</b> applied and compared. The costs considered were establishment, maintenance and harvesting and that the forest was managed with the substitution being done after cutting the original establishment at seven years of age, that is, there is no coppicing transport. The substitution cost was considered equal to that of establishment. The only income considered was the sale of the wood produced for energy (250 st/ha) at the price of US $ 7. 10 /st in the cutting age. The main conclusions were: For <b>any</b> <b>discount</b> rate, LEV <b>is</b> always a larger value than NDV because NDV considers land in the relationship of costs; the assumption that land only has value for wood production, implied by Faustmann methodology, doesn t have theoretical nor practical support; if there is no alternative for land use, then its opportunity cost is zero {{and there would be no}} reason to determine its value; land productive value is not the only value that enters in the formation of its price. The Faustmann methodology doesn t capture the other factors that affect land price, for instance, the speculative effects, cultural values, land protective value, protection against inflation and of statu...|$|R

The rival makes only product, number 10, which it can sell to the customer for $9, but then the customer {{will have to pay}} $90 for the other 9 products from the dominant firm, for a total of $99[...] [...] [...] Indeed, in this particular example <b>any</b> <b>discount</b> above 1% will exclude the rival from the trade of those customers who want the entire package; but such trivial <b>discounts</b> <b>are</b> almost certainly justified by cost savings in contracting or delivery, if not in production.|$|R
40|$|The {{last few}} years have {{witnessed}} important advances {{in our understanding of}} time preference and social discounting. In particular, several rationales for the use of time-varying social discount rates have emerged. These rationales range from the ad hoc to the formal, with some founded solely in economic theory while others reflect principles of intergenerational equity. While these advances are to be applauded, the practitioner is left with a confusing array of rationales and the sense that almost <b>any</b> <b>discount</b> rate can <b>be</b> justified. This paper draws together these different strands and provides a critical review of past and present contributions to this literature. In addition to this we highlight some of the problems with employing DDRs in the decision-making process, the most pressing of which may be time inconsistency. We clarify their practical implications, and potential pitfalls, of the more credible rationales and argue that some approaches popular in environmental economics literature are ill-conceived. Finally, we illustrate the impact of different approaches by examining global warming and nuclear power investment.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to specify and {{summarize}} assumptions and proofs for new approaches to discounting proposed inour catastrophic risk management studies. The main issue is concerned with justification of investments, which may turn into benefits over long and uncertain time horizon. For example, how can we justify mitigation efforts for expected 300 -year flood that can occur also next year. The <b>discounting</b> <b>is</b> supposed to impose time preferences to resolve this issue, but this view may be dramatically misleading. We show that <b>any</b> <b>discounted</b> infinite horizon sum of values can be equivalently replaced by undiscounted sum of the same values with random finite time horizon. The expected duration of this stopping time horizon for standard discount rates obtained from capital markets does not exceed a few decades and therefore such rates may significantly underestimate the net benefits of long-term decisions. The alternative undiscounted random stopping time criterion allows to induce social stopping time discounting focusing on arrival times of potential extreme events rather then horizons of market interests. In general, induced <b>discount</b> rates <b>are</b> conditional on the degree of social commitment to mitigate risk. Random extreme events affect these rates, which alter the optimal mitigation efforts that, in turn, change events This endogeneity of the induced discounting restricts exact evaluations necessary for using traditional deterministic methods and it calls for stochastic optimisation methods. The paper provides insights in the nature of <b>discounting</b> that <b>are</b> critically important for developing robust long-term risk management strategies...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{consists}} of four essays on bargaining and repeated games. The first essay studies whether allowing players to sign binding contracts governing future play leads to reputation effects in repeated games with long-run players. Given any prior over behavioral types, a modified prior is constructed with the same total weight on behavioral types and a larger support under which almost all efficient, feasible, and individually rational payoffs are attainable in perfect Bayesian equilibrium. Thus, whether reputation effects emerge in repeated games with contracts depends on details of the prior distribution over behavioral types other than its support. The second essay studies reputational bargaining under the assumption of first-order knowledge of rationality. The share of the surplus that a player can guarantee herself is determined, as is the bargaining posture that she must announce in order to guarantee herself this much. It is shown that this maxmin share of the surplus is large relative to the player's initial reputation, and that the corresponding bargaining posture simply demands this share plus compensation for any delay in reaching agreement. The third essay studies the maximum level of cooperation that can be sustained in sequential equilibrium in repeated games with network monitoring. The foundational {{result is that the}} maximum level of cooperation can be sustained in grim trigger strategies. Comparative statics on the maximum level of cooperation are shown to be highly tractable. For the case of fixed monitoring networks, a new notion of network centrality is introduced, which characterizes which players have greater capacities for cooperation and which networks can support more cooperation. The fourth essay studies the price-setting problem of a monopoly that in each time period has the option of failing to deliver its good after receiving payment. Optimal equilibrium pricing and profits are characterized. For durable goods, a lower bound on optimal profit for <b>any</b> <b>discount</b> factor <b>is</b> provided. The bound converges to the optimal static monopoly profit as the discount factor converges to one, in contrast to the Coase conjecture. by Alexander G. Wolitzky. Thesis (Ph. D.)
