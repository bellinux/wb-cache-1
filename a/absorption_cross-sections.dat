The method is optimized for simultaneous rapid and accurate determination of average <b>absorption</b> <b>cross-section</b> over the frequency range 1 – 15 [*]GHz, making it suitable for use in human absorption and exposure studies. The typical measurement time of the subject is about 8 [*]min with a corresponding statistical uncertainty of about 3 % in the measured <b>absorption</b> <b>cross-section.</b> The method is validated by comparing measurements on a spherical phantom with Mie series calculations.

Recently, Lucirin TPO-L {{was shown to}} be a photoinitiator with several advantageous properties for two-photon induced polymerization. Here we measure the two-photon <b>absorption</b> <b>cross-section</b> spectrum of Lucirin TPO-L, which presents a maximum of 1. 2 GM at 610 nm. Despite its small two-photon <b>absorption</b> <b>cross-section,</b> it is possible to fabricate excellent microstructures by two-photon polymerization due to the high polymerization quantum yield of Lucirin TPO-L. These results indicate that optimization of the two-photon <b>absorption</b> <b>cross-section</b> is not the only material parameter to be considered when searching for new photoinitiators for microfabrication via two-photon absorption...|$|R

50|$|MSOT {{can resolve}} various optoacoustic {{moieties}} {{based on their}} absorption spectrum, including nanoparticles, dyes and fluorochromes. Most fluorochromes are optimized for fluorescence emission and are sub-optimal for optoacoustic detection, because after absorbing the illuminating energy, they tend to emit fluorescence rather than convert it to heat and generate a photoecho.

Therefore, much research has been directed at providing chromophores with high two-photon <b>absorption</b> <b>cross-sections.</b>|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{spectral}} <b>absorption</b> <b>cross-section</b> of microalgae is {{an essential}} parameter in modeling the microalgae metabolism and growth kinetics {{as well as in}} estimating the productivity and efficiency of photo-bioreactors. This paper presents a simple experimental procedure for retrieving the average spectral <b>absorption</b> <b>cross-section</b> of concentrated microalgal suspensions. The method combines experimental measurements of the normal–hemispherical transmittance and reflectance of the suspensions in conventional cuvettes with an inverse method and analytical expressions obtained from the modified two-flux approximation accounting for absorption and multiple scattering. The method was validated with direct measurements of the scattering phase function and of the <b>absorption</b> and scattering <b>cross-sections</b> of freshwater microalgae Chlorella vulgaris. It was able to retrieve the <b>absorption</b> <b>cross-section</b> with acceptable accuracy. The latter was then used to estimate successfully the fluence rate using a simplified light transfer model, the local rate of photon absorption, and the biomass productivity in flat plate PBRs...|$|R
5000|$|The {{mechanism}} is that heavier elements have large photon <b>absorption</b> <b>cross-sections</b> when partially ionized (see opacity), so efficiently absorb photons from the radiation {{coming from the}} core of the star, and some of the energy of the photons gets converted to outward momentum, effectively 'kicking' the heavy atom towards the photosphere. The effect is strong enough that very hot white dwarfs are significantly less bright in the EUV and X-ray bands than would be expected from a black-body model.|$|E
50|$|The {{molecular}} two-photon cross-section {{is usually}} {{quoted in the}} units of Goeppert-Mayer (GM) (after its discoverer, Nobel laureate Maria Goeppert-Mayer), where 1 GM is 10−50 cm4 s photon−1. Considering the reason for these units, one {{can see that it}} results from the product of two areas (one for each photon, each in cm2) and a time (within which the two photons must arrive to be able to act together). The large scaling factor is introduced in order that 2-photon <b>absorption</b> <b>cross-sections</b> of common dyes will have convenient values.|$|E
50|$|A mass may {{be exactly}} {{critical}} {{at a particular}} temperature. Fission and <b>absorption</b> <b>cross-sections</b> increase as the relative neutron velocity decreases. As fuel temperature increases, neutrons of a given energy appear faster and thus fission/absorption is less likely. This is not unrelated to Doppler broadening of the U238 resonances but is common to all fuels/absorbers/configurations. Neglecting the very important resonances, the total neutron cross section of every material exhibits an inverse relationship with relative neutron velocity. Hot fuel is always less reactive than cold fuel (over/under moderation in LWR is a different topic). Thermal expansion associated with temperature increase also contributes a negative coefficient of reactivity since fuel atoms are moving farther apart. A mass that is exactly critical at room temperature would be sub-critical in an environment anywhere above room temperature due to thermal expansion alone.|$|E

[...] The absorption band is relatively narrow and so wavelength stabilised laser sources are typically needed. [...] The 1480nbsp&nm band has a lower, but broader, <b>absorption</b> <b>cross-section</b> and is generally used for higher power amplifiers.

40|$|Average <b>absorption</b> <b>cross-section</b> can be {{measured}} in a reverberation chamber with an uncertainty estimated from the number of independent samples of the chamber transfer function taken during the measurement. However the current uncertainty model does not account the loading effect of the object being measured or the presence of non-stochastic energy in the chamber, as characterized by the Rician K-factor. Here the uncertainty model for the <b>absorption</b> <b>cross-section</b> measurements has been extended to include both of these effects for the case of stepped mechanical tuning with a paddle and frequency tuning. The extended uncertainty formula has been applied to predicting the range over which <b>absorption</b> <b>cross-section</b> measurements can be made with a defined relative uncertainty in a chamber of given geometry, using both simple models for the reverberation chamber and the measured quality-factor and K-factor. The model has been validated using measurements on a set of absorbing cubes of different sizes compared to Mie Series calculation on sphere of equivalent surface area. The extended error model is particularly utile for the design of reverberation chambers and experiments for <b>absorption</b> <b>cross-section</b> measurements across a wide range of application areas...|$|R

50|$|Gold {{nanorods}} {{are being}} investigated as photothermal agents for in-vivo applications. Gold nanorods are rod-shaped gold nanoparticles whose aspect ratios tune the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) band from the visible to near-infrared wavelength. The total extinction of {{light at the}} SPR {{is made up of}} both absorption and scattering. For the smaller axial diameter nanorods (~10 nm), absorption dominates, whereas for the larger axial diameter nanorods (>35 nm) scattering can dominate. As a consequence, for in-vivo applications, small diameter gold nanorods are being used as photothermal converters of near-infrared light due to their high <b>absorption</b> <b>cross-sections.</b> Since near-infrared light transmits readily through human skin and tissue, these nanorods can be used as ablation components for cancer, and other targets. When coated with polymers, gold nanorods have been observed to circulate in-vivo with half-lives longer than 6 hours, bodily residence times around 72 hours, and little to no uptake in any internal organs except the liver.Apart from rod-like gold nanoparticles, also spherical colloidal gold nanoparticles are recently used as markers in combination with photothermal single particle microscopy.|$|E
40|$|Mid-IR <b>absorption</b> <b>cross-sections</b> are {{measured}} for methane, ethane, ethylene and methanol over 2800 - 3400 cm- 1 (2. 9 - 3. 6 μm) spectral region. Measurements {{are carried out}} using a Fourier-Transform-Infrared (FTIR) spectrometer with temperatures ranging 296 - 1100 K and pressures near atmospheric.

Integrated band intensity is also calculated over the measured spectral region and is found to be a very weak function of temperature. The <b>absorption</b> <b>cross-sections</b> of the relatively small fuels studied here show dependence on the bath gas. This effect is investigated by studying the variation of <b>absorption</b> <b>cross-sections</b> at 3. 392 μm using a HeNe laser in mixtures of fuel and nitrogen, argon, or helium. Mixtures of fuel with He have the highest value of <b>absorption</b> <b>cross-sections</b> followed by Ar and N 2.
