5|$|A {{teaspoon}} of seawater contains about 50 million viruses. Most {{of these are}} bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals, and are in fact essential to the regulation of marine and freshwater ecosystems; however, they are also important mortality agents of phytoplankton, {{the base of the}} foodchain in aquatic environments. They infect and destroy bacteria in aquatic microbial communities, and {{are one of the most}} important mechanisms of recycling carbon and nutrient cycling in marine environments. The organic molecules released from the dead bacterial cells stimulate fresh bacterial and <b>algal</b> <b>growth,</b> in a process known as the viral shunt. Viral activity may also affect the biological pump, the process whereby carbon is sequestered in the deep ocean.|$|E
5|$|The {{biocidal}} {{effects of}} some heavy metals {{have been known}} since antiquity. Platinum, osmium, copper, ruthenium, and other heavy metals, including arsenic, are used in anti-cancer treatments, or have shown potential. Antimony (anti-protozoal), bismuth (anti-ulcer), gold (anti-arthritic), and iron (anti-malarial) are also important in medicine. Copper, zinc, silver, gold, or mercury are used in antiseptic formulations; small amounts of some heavy metals are used to control <b>algal</b> <b>growth</b> in, for example, cooling towers. Depending on their intended use as fertilisers or biocides, agrochemicals may contain heavy metals such as chromium, cobalt, nickel, copper, zinc, arsenic, cadmium, mercury, or lead.|$|E

50|$|The west Indian top {{shell is}} known to be an herbivore, feeding on a large variety of algae, and {{sometimes}} also on detritus. They actively scrape the <b>algal</b> <b>growths</b> off rocks, and this tends to cause erosion over time. Feeding commonly occurs during the nocturnal period, when the snails are most active.|$|R
5|$|Sterol lipids, such as {{cholesterol}} and its derivatives, {{are an important}} component of membrane lipids, along with the glycerophospholipids and sphingomyelins. The steroids, all derived from the same fused four-ring core structure, have different biological roles as hormones and signaling molecules. The eighteen-carbon (C18) steroids include the estrogen family whereas the C19 steroids comprise the androgens such as testosterone and androsterone. The C21 subclass includes the progestogens as well as the glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. The secosteroids, comprising various forms of vitamin D, are characterized by cleavage of the B ring of the core structure. Other examples of sterols are the bile acids and their conjugates, which in mammals are oxidized derivatives of {{cholesterol and}} are synthesized in the liver. The plant equivalents are the phytosterols, such as β-sitosterol, stigmasterol, and brassicasterol; the latter compound is also used as a biomarker for <b>algal</b> <b>growth.</b> The predominant sterol in fungal cell membranes is ergosterol.|$|E
25|$|As {{an example}} of the adaptations made by reef fish, the yellow tang is a {{herbivore}} which feeds on benthic turf algae. They also provide cleaner services to marine turtles, by removing <b>algal</b> <b>growth</b> from their shells. They do not tolerate other fish with the same colour or shape. When alarmed, the usually placid yellow tang can erect spines in its tail and slash at its opponent with rapid sideways movements.|$|E
25|$|Another {{issue is}} the risk of algal blooms. When temperatures, {{nutrient}} supply, and available sunlight are optimal for <b>algal</b> <b>growth,</b> algae multiply at an exponential rate, eventually exhausting nutrients and causing a subsequent die-off in fish. The decaying algal biomass depletes the oxygen in the pond water because it blocks out the sun and pollutes it with organic and inorganic solutes (such as ammonium ions), which can (and frequently do) lead to massive loss of fish.|$|E
25|$|The {{metal oxides}} (Fe2O3) can leach out of {{activated}} carbon resulting in discoloration. Acid/water-soluble ash content is {{more significant than}} total ash content.

5000|$|The {{unsustainable}} overfishing of keystone species, {{such as the}} Giant Triton and sharks, {{can cause}} disruption to food chains vital to life on the reef. Fishing also impacts the reef through increased pollution from boats, by-catch of unwanted species (such as dolphins and turtles) and reef habitat destruction from trawling, anchors and nets. Overfishing of herbivore populations can cause <b>algal</b> <b>growths</b> on reefs. The Batfish Platax pinnatus has been observed to significantly reduce <b>algal</b> <b>growths</b> in studies simulating overfishing. Sharks are fished for their meat, {{and when they are}} part of bycatch, it is common to kill the shark and throw it overboard, as there is a belief that they interfere with fishing. As of 1 July 2004, approximately one-third of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is protected from species removal of any kind, including fishing, without written permission. However, illegal poaching is not unknown in these no-take zones. [...] A 2015 study into coral trout on the Great Barrier Reef found that the no-take zones had more coral trout and more coral trout larvae after tropical cyclone events, which helped replenish those areas sooner.|$|R
25|$|Barley straw, in England, {{is placed}} in mesh bags and floated in fish ponds or water gardens to help prevent <b>algal</b> <b>growth</b> without harming pond plants and animals. Barley straw has not been {{approved}} by the EPA for use as a pesticide and its effectiveness as an algae regulator in ponds has produced mixed results, with either more efficacy against phytoplankton algae versus mat-forming algae, or no significant change, during university testing in the US and the UK.|$|E
25|$|Coral reefs deliver {{ecosystem}} services to tourism, fisheries and shoreline protection. The annual global economic value of coral reefs is estimated between US$30–375 billion. However, coral reefs are fragile ecosystems, {{partly because they}} {{are very sensitive to}} water temperature. They are under threat from climate change, oceanic acidification, blast fishing, cyanide fishing for aquarium fish, sunscreen use, overuse of reef resources, and harmful land-use practices, including urban and agricultural runoff and water pollution, which can harm reefs by encouraging excess <b>algal</b> <b>growth.</b>|$|E

This is a symbiotic relationship. The fish benefit by having access to an easy meal, while the turtles get groomed of the algae growths on their shells, which can increase drag in the water when growth becomes too dense.|$|R
40|$|Models {{addressing}} excessive nutrient loading in {{the environment}} originated over fifty {{years ago with the}} simple nutrient concentration thresholds proposed by Sawyer. Since then, models have improved due to progress in modeling techniques and technology as well as enhancements in scientific knowledge. Several of these advances are examined here. Among the recent approaches in modeling techniques we review are error propagation, model confirmation, generalized sensitivity analysis, and Bayesian analysis. In the scientific arena and process characterization, we focus on advances in surface water modeling, discussing enhanced modeling of organic carbon, improved hydrodynamics, and refined characterization of sediment diagenesis. We conclude with some observations on future needs and anticipated developments.

25|$|Regular {{cyclical}} {{lighting is}} used in aquariums to simulate day and night. This is beneficial for fish and invertebrates since it establishes a routine, enables them to rest, and makes them feel more secure. Aside from establishing a routine, high output lighting is required for many invertebrates such as corals and anemones to survive. Lighting in marine tanks that contain only fish and live rock is not an important issue. In aquariums containing invertebrates, however, where <b>algal</b> <b>growth</b> (of both free-living and symbiotic algae) is desired, more intense lighting is required. Various light sources include {{but are not limited}} to: natural sunlight, fluorescent, VHO fluorescent (Very High Output), T-5 fluorescent, compact fluorescent, LED and metal halide. Each type of lighting has its own advantages and disadvantages. They all vary in initial cost, maintenance cost, spectrum obtainable, longevity, efficiency, and power.|$|E
500|$|Adult Cuvier's dwarf caiman {{are usually}} found singly or in pairs. The {{breeding}} {{of this species}} has been little studied {{but it does not}} appear to be seasonal in nature. The female builds a mound nest out of vegetation and mud somewhere in a concealed location and lays a clutch of from 10 to 25 eggs, hiding them under further vegetation. The incubation period is around 90 days and the sex of the hatchlings depends on the temperature of the nest during that time. When the eggs begin to hatch, the female opens the nest in response to the calls made by the young. Newly emerged juveniles have a coating of mucus and may delay entering the water for a few days until this has dried. Its continuing presence on their skin is believed to reduce <b>algal</b> <b>growth.</b> The female stays with the young for a few weeks after which time the hatchlings disperse. The young grow at the rate of about [...] per year and reach sexual maturity at around eight years.|$|E

30|$|Nuisance <b>algal</b> <b>growths</b> pose a {{significant}} threat to irrigation canals for water conveyance and flood control. Copper algaecides are routinely {{used to control}} algae in moving water. In this research, we monitored an application of a new use pattern of a chelated copper algaecide to a flowing canal and evaluated efficacy using controlled bench-scale study of the field-realized exposure using an alga commonly found in flowing water (Oedogonium sp.). The highest peak copper concentration (3.17  ppm) was measured 0.80  km from the application site though it decreased significantly at each sampling interval to the 9.66  km sampling point and remained at or below 0.2  ppm at 9.66 – 19.31  km from the application site. Copper mass dissipated with an exponential curve (R 2 [*]=[*] 0.9558), and less than 10 % of applied copper was recovered at or beyond 9.66  km from application. Peak concentration dissipated by exponential decay (R 2 =[*] 0.9922) and was predicted to achieve background concentrations by 20.9  km from application. Scaled laboratory experiments showed control at exposure achieved through 6.44  km from application. This research demonstrates a method to improve operational efficiency of copper use in flowing water to achieve desired algal control, while decreasing overall copper use and complying with applicable discharge levels.|$|R
40|$|Part 1 of {{this series}} {{summarized}} the early development of scientific {{understanding of the role}} of microorganisms in water distribution systems. The earliest concerns were for the transmission of disease by organisms which penetrated the distribution system. By mid-century, an understanding of need for the maintenance of a bacteriostatic disinfectant residual in the distribution system was well established. Part 2 {{of this series}} deals with efforts to understand and control tastes-and-odors as well as the role of microorganisms in the corrosion of distribution mains. It also summarizes studies directed at understanding the sources of microorganisms found within the distribution system. Aesthetic Concerns: Tastes and Odors Commonly, consumer dissatisfaction with water quality is expressed in terms of unpleasant taste-and-odor. The results of a comprehensive survey of taste-and-odor problems related to <b>algal</b> <b>growths</b> were reported by Lendall (1946). He proposed activated carbon treatment, breakpoint chlorination and chlorine dioxide as remedial measures. The significance of algae and other interference organisms in water supplies was further detailed and illustrated in a series of reviews by Palmer and Tarzwell (1955) and Palmer (1960, 1961). In addition to algae of importance in water supplies, these reviews depicted iron bacteria and protozoans associated with water quality deterioration in distribution systems.

The results showed that blue-green <b>algal</b> <b>growths</b> significantly reduced the amount of suspended soil material in runoff water as compared with bare soils. Differences in runoff suspended sediments were also related to differences in soil type and simulated rainfall intensity. An analysis of variance of the effects of these 3 factors and their interactions showed that the smaller differences in suspended sediment production on the Anthony soil due to the microvegetation treatment was verified by a highly significant soils-microvegetation interaction, probably because the finer pima soils wash away more easily without stabilizing microvegetation. Also, less vegetation seems to grow on the Anthony soil. Differences in runoff and infiltration volumes and in settleable sediment amounts were not detected...|$|R

30|$|Water {{conveyance}} through canal {{systems is}} critical for delivery to irrigated crops as well as flood control (Getsinger et al. 2014). There are over 62, 000 miles of irrigation canals throughout the 17 conterminous Western USA (Sytsma and Parker 1999) that are the primary water source to support over 40 million acres of irrigated crops (Maupin et al. 2014). Nuisance <b>algal</b> <b>growths</b> commonly impede water flow through canal systems as well as clog discharge devices, gate valves, and irrigation intakes (Getsinger et al. 2014). Copper algaecides {{are one of the}} few USEPA registered chemistries that have been widely used in canals for decades to control algae and pose no irrigation restrictions (USEPA 2009). Recent label language on a 28.2 % active copper ethanolamine complex algaecide (SePRO 2014) has specific allowable use instructions for a pulse (i.e., slug) copper application method to flowing canals. This allows for ease of application (decreased application time and equipment needs) compared with continuous drip or injection applications as well as potential increased effectiveness. Limited data exist on copper exposures achieved in moving water following pulse applications. By modeling copper concentrations down canal systems, improved predictions of distance of target algal control can be made based on the exposure, and subsequently guide application sites along a canal system to achieve desired control. Additionally, modeling the dissipation of maximum copper concentrations or peak concentration can inform water resource managers of predicted copper discharge levels at downstream sites in order to comply with regulatory standards (if applicable) to receiving waters (example: WADOE 2016).|$|R

40|$|Iranian flat breads {{generally}} have short shelf life. The {{result of this}} situation is usually enormous bread wastage. Among {{the most important factors}} involved are lack of proper packing and storage methods. In this study, the best temperature for bread packing was determined and the effects of three types of plastic wrapping on Taftoon bread baked of the typical flour were investigated after 72 hours of storage. These wrappings included a two-layer wrapping of oriented polypropylene and polyethylene (OPP/PE) with a thickness of 60 µ, a three-layer wrapping of PP/PE/PE with a thickness of 70 µ, and a two-layer polyethylene with a thickness of 70 µ together with cardboard and plastic. Bread packing was carried out at two different temperature ranges (20 - 25 oC and 45 - 50 oC). Results from moisture measurements and water activity test indicated that the characteristics of breads packed in different wrappings showed significant differences (p&lt; 0. 01). Moisture percentage and water activity (aw) were lower in layers with higher permeability to moisture and water vapor and, consequently, <b>algal</b> <b>growths</b> reduced in these wrappings. Reduced moisture content, however, reduced the final bread quality score. It was also found that employing cardboard covered in polyethylene had no significant effect on bread shelf life during 72 hours of bread storage.
