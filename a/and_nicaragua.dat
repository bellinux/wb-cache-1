5|$|Goldman united populations {{ranging from}} {{northern}} Veracruz through eastern Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras, <b>and</b> <b>Nicaragua</b> south to far northwestern Costa Rica in the nominate subspecies, Oryzomys couesi couesi.

According to Goldman, individual variation within the subspecies is large, {{which has led to}} the large number of published synonyms, but populations from all parts of its range are essentially similar.|$|E

5|$|The {{black vulture}} {{appears in a}} variety of Maya hieroglyphics in Mayan codices. It is {{normally}} connected with either death or as a bird of prey. The vulture's glyph is often shown attacking humans. This species lacks the religious connections that the king vulture has. While some of the glyphs clearly show the black vulture's open nostril and hooked beak, some are assumed to be this species because they are vulture-like but lack the king vulture's knob and are painted black. This vulture has appeared on two stamps: those of Guyana in 1990 <b>and</b> <b>Nicaragua</b> in 1994.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Aletta was a weak but {{destructive}} {{tropical storm}} that killed 308people while meandering {{off the coast}} of Central America in May 1982. An area of disturbed weather developed into a tropical depression on May20, and into a tropical storm around noon on May21. The cyclone turned northeast, reaching its peak as a strong tropical storm on May23. Aletta meandered and gradually weakened, dissipating a few hundred miles southwest of Acapulco on May29. Moisture from the tropical system spread over Honduras <b>and</b> <b>Nicaragua,</b> causing flooding. Throughout the two countries, 308people were killed and total damage was at $457million (1982USD). In the aftermath of the storm, many programs provided relief to the victims of Aletta.|$|E

5|$|As a {{tropical}} storm, Beta produced heavy rains over northern Panama, amounting up to 3inches (76mm), which caused several mudslides {{as well as}} three fatalities. On October29, the storm passed over Providencia Island, caused significant damage to structures, and injured 30 people. In Honduras <b>and</b> <b>Nicaragua,</b> over 1,000 structures were damaged by the storm, hundreds of which were destroyed. Ten people were initially feared dead after their boat went adrift during the storm. However, a Panamanian vessel rescued the men after drifting in the water for several hours. Rains in Honduras totaled to 21.82in (554mm) and 6.39in (162mm) in Nicaragua. Six {{people were killed in}} Nicaragua {{as a result of the}} storm and the cost to repair damages exceeded 300million córdoba ($14.5million USD). Overall, Beta was responsible for nine fatalities and more than $15.5million in damage across four countries.|$|E
5|$|Cortés {{was troubled}} by news that his enemies in New Spain were gaining control of Mexico; when Cortés {{received}} news that Pedro Moreno would soon be arriving in Honduras with many colonists, and official documents from the Audiencia of Santo Domingo, he decided against further exploration and instead returned to Mexico, leaving on 26 April 1526. He took Pizacura to Mexico with him, where he died not long afterwards of a fatal illness. Gonzalo de Sandoval also returned to Mexico, marching overland via Guatemala. Cortés installed his cousin Hernando de Saavedra as governor of the new territory, and left Saavedra with instructions to treat the natives fairly; however Saavedra's actions reopened underlying divisions between rival groups of colonists. Saavedra rapidly established rule over {{what is now the}} department of Olancho; he sent Bartolomé de Celada inland to find a good location for a new Spanish town. He founded Frontera de Cáceras upon the savannah of the Olancho valley, near the Indian towns of Telica and Escamilpa, within the disputed territory between Honduras <b>and</b> <b>Nicaragua.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1980s, civil wars {{broke out in}} Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, <b>and</b> <b>Nicaragua.</b> U.S. arms {{shipments}} to the area increased dramatically as a result, as did drug smuggling to the U.S., particularly of cocaine. In the 1980s Noriega's involvement with drug smuggling grew as well. Dinges wrote that Noriega frequently received large payments, sometimes as high as $100,000 per shipment, {{in return for the}} smugglers receiving immunity from prosecution. A report by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency stated that Noriega held firm control over drug-related activities and money laundering through a group of close associates within the military. On June 12, 1986, investigative journalist Seymour Hersh published an article in The New York Times describing Noriega's involvement in drug smuggling and money laundering. Hersh recorded a U.S. White House official as saying that reducing Noriega's activities could greatly reduce international drug trafficking.|$|E

5|$|El Salvador {{returned}} {{to participate in}} the 1961 CCCF Championship, hosted in Costa Rica, alongside nine other national teams. Due to the larger number of teams the CCCF Championship shifted to a two-round format with two round-robin group stages. In the first round, there were two groups, one with five teams and one with four. The top two teams from both groups advanced to the second stage. El Salvador was placed in the four team group Honduras, the Netherlands Antilles, <b>and</b> <b>Nicaragua,</b> which they topped with two wins and one draw. In the decisive round they finished in second place behind Costa Rica, who won their seventh CCCF Championship. Afterward the tournament was dissolved and replaced with the CONCACAF Championship.|$|E
5|$|Gil González Dávila set {{out from}} Santo Domingo early in 1524, with the {{intention}} of exploring the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua. His course took him to the north coast of Honduras, where he was beset by a storm. In order to lighten the load of his ships, he ordered that a number of horses be thrown overboard. This event resulted in the place being named Puerto de Caballos ("Port of Horses"). González Dávila landed on the north coast, with authorisation to conquer Honduras from the king, after having sent the royal fifth of his proceeds from campaigns in Panama <b>and</b> <b>Nicaragua,</b> a sum totalling 112,524 gold castellanos. Puerto de Caballos later developed into an important staging point for the colonisation of the region.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Mitch {{formed on}} October22 {{in the southwestern}} Caribbean Sea, and it {{eventually}} intensified into a Category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale by October26. By that time, the hurricane was {{just north of the}} coast of Honduras, and was expected by the National Hurricane Center (NHC) and various tropical cyclone forecast models to turn to the north. When the track was more westward than expected, the NHC recommended early on October26 for a hurricane warning to be issued for the northeastern Honduran coast, although difficulties in communications prevented their immediate implementation. Within a few hours, a hurricane warning was in place between Limón to the Honduras <b>and</b> <b>Nicaragua</b> border, including the offshore Swan Island. When Mitch still failed to turn to the north, the government of Honduras issued a hurricane warning for the remainder of their coastline. The hurricane weakened while turning to the south, and made landfall in Honduras 134km (83mi) east of La Ceiba, with estimated winds of 130km/h (80mph). Mitch continued to weaken while moving slowly westward across the country.|$|E
