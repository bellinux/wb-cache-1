50|$|For {{spectral}} discrimination, STX employed wide-band filters {{installed on}} a filter wheel. There were five usable filter positions: 1265 Å-thick Al filter (2.5 Å-36 Å pass band), Al/Mg/Mn filter (2.4 Å-32 Å), 2.52 μm Mg filter (2.4 Å-23 Å), 11.6 μm Al filter (2.4 Å-13 Å), 119 μm Be filter (2.3 Å-10 Å). Before the entrance filter failure in November 1992 three more filter positions were available: no <b>analysis</b> <b>filter</b> (2.5 Å-46 Å), Wide band optical filter (4600 Å-4800 Å), Narrow band optical filter (4290 Å-4320 Å).|$|E
50|$|For {{any given}} subband <b>analysis</b> <b>filter</b> bank, we can split it into further subbands {{as shown in}} figure 8. By repeating this {{operation}} we can actually build a tree structured analysis bank. Example of a 1D tree structured filter bank is the one that results in an octave stacking of the passbands. In the 2D case, tree structures based on simple two-channel modules can offer sophisticated band-splitting schemes, especially if we combine the various configurations shown above.The directional filter bank which will be discussed below is one such example.|$|E

50|$|Synthesis (i.e. {{recombining}} {{the outputs}} of multiple receivers) {{is basically a}} matter of upsampling each one at a rate commensurate with the total bandwidth to be created, translating each channel to its new center frequency, and summing the streams of samples. In that context, the interpolation filter associated with upsampling is called synthesis filter. The net frequency response of each channel {{is the product of}} the synthesis filter with the frequency response of the filter bank (<b>analysis</b> <b>filter).</b> Ideally, the frequency responses of adjacent channels sum to a constant value at every frequency between the channel centers. That condition is known as perfect reconstruction.|$|E
5000|$|A {{complete}} filter bank {{consists of the}} analysis and synthesis sides.The <b>analysis</b> <b>filter</b> bank divides an input signal to different subbands with different frequency spectra.The synthesis part reassembles the different subband signals and generates a reconstructed signal.Two of the basic building blocks are the decimator and expander.As illustrated in Figure 6, the input gets divided into four directional sub bands that each of them covers one of the wedge-shaped frequency regions. In 1D systems, M-fold decimators keep only those samples that are multiples of M and discard the rest. while in multi-dimensional systems the decimators are D X D nonsingular integer matrix. it considers only those samples {{that are on the}} lattice generated by the decimator. Commonly used decimator is the quincunx decimator whose lattice is generated from the Quincunx matrix which is defined by [...] A quincunx lattice that is generated by this matrix is shown in figure.|$|E
50|$|To {{understand}} the working of 2-Channel Multidimensional filter banks {{we must first}} {{understand the}} design process of a simple 2D two-channel filter banks. In particular the diamond filter banks are of special interest in some image coding applications. The decimation matrix M for the diamond filter bank is usually the quincunx matrix which is briefly discussed in the above sections. For a two-channel system, there are only four filters, two analysis filters and two synthesis filters. So in some designs, two or three filters are chosen {{so that there is}} no aliasing and the remaining filters are then optimized to achieve approximate reconstruction. Design of 2D filters are more complex than 1D filters. So we usually use appropriate mapping techniques to achieve perfect reconstruction.. A polyphase mapping method is proposed to design an IIR <b>analysis</b> <b>filter.</b> For filter banks with FIR filter types, several 1D to 2D trasformations have been considered. For example, the McClellan transformation is used to achieve the FIR filter banks.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{consider}} the degree elevation and reduction of Bézier curves as the filter bank process.

40|$|A {{technique}} is {{developed for the}} design of <b>analysis</b> <b>filters</b> in an M-channel maximally decimated, perfect reconstruction, finite-impulse-response quadrature mirror filter (FIR QMF) bank that has a lossless polyphase-component matrix E(z). The aim is to optimize the parameters characterizing E(z) until the sum of the stopband energies of the <b>analysis</b> <b>filters</b> is minimized. There are four novel elements in the procedure reported here. The first is a technique for efficient initialization of one of the M <b>analysis</b> <b>filters,</b> as a spectral factor of an Mth band filter. The factorization itself is done in an efficient manner using the eigenfilters approach, without the need for root-finding techniques. The second element is the initialization of the internal parameters which characterize E(z), based on the above spectral factor. The third element is a modified characterization, mostly free from rotation angles, of the FIR E(z). The fourth is the incorporation of symmetry among the <b>analysis</b> <b>filters,</b> so as to minimize the number of unknown parameters being optimized. The resulting design procedure always gives better filter responses than earlier ones (for a given filter length) and converges much faste...|$|R

Then, through applying the lifting scheme to the other <b>analysis</b> <b>filter</b> bank, its response can be greatly improved to meet the desired design specifications without impairing either the perfect construction property or the other <b>analysis</b> <b>filter</b> bank.

40|$|In this paper, {{we define}} {{a concept of}} signal matched multirate {{whitening}} filter bank which provides an optimum coding gain.

We also present a fast time and order recursive least squares algorithm to obtain the vector output of the proposed <b>analysis</b> <b>filter</b> bank.

Since the proposed signal matched <b>analysis</b> <b>filter</b> bank coefficients are not available directly, an order recursive algorithm is also presented for estimating these from the lattice parameters.

This approach can be used to design I-D two-channel filter banks, as well as multidimensional nonseparable two-channel filter banks. Our method consists of first designing the low-pass <b>analysis</b> <b>filter.</b> Given the low-pass <b>analysis</b> <b>filter,</b> the PR conditions can be expressed as a set of linear constraints on the complementary-synthesis low-pass filter. We design the complementary-synthesis filter by using the eigenfilter design method with linear constraints. We show that, by an appropriate choice of the length of the filters, we can ensure the existence of a solution to the constrained eigenfilter design problem for the complementary-synthesis filter. Thus, our approach gives an eigenfilter-based method of designing the complementary filter, given a "predesigned" <b>analysis</b> <b>filter,</b> with the filter lengths satisfying certain conditions.

For wideband high frequency applications, parallel multi-rate conversion systems such as time-interleaved or hybrid filter bank analog-to-digital converters (resp.
