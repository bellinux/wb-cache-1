50|$|Ambiguous {{interactions}} between ethnic communities in America: Yamamoto depicts America {{as a complex}} network of different ethnicities, made even more complicated by the prejudices and hierarchies created by each ethnic group. Her stories present various {{interactions between}} <b>Japanese</b> <b>and</b> Anglo-American, <b>Japanese</b> <b>and</b> Mexican, <b>Japanese</b> <b>and</b> Chinese, <b>Japanese</b> <b>and</b> Filipino, <b>Japanese</b> <b>and</b> African-American, even between <b>Japanese</b> <b>and</b> Eskimo. Several of these interactions emphasize cultural misunderstanding and hostility, for example American hostility towards the Japanese after World War II. Other stories portray ethnic interaction as positive, productive, and meaningful to the parties involved. “The Eskimo Connection” tracks the unusual friendship between a <b>Japanese</b> author <b>and</b> an aspiring Eskimo writer corresponding from prison. Sometimes Yamamoto creates surprising twists based on unexpected moments of empathy or misunderstanding between two groups. In “The Brown House,” a black man’s interaction with a Japanese family is an occasion for cooperation and gratitude, but also for prejudice (“a kurombo!”).|$|R
