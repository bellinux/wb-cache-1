40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the perceptions of}} administrators, teachers, parents, and students on the integration of {{social and emotional learning}} in the middle school and its relationship to <b>adequate</b> <b>yearly</b> student <b>progress.</b> The independent variables included perceptions on the integration of social and emotional learning in the middle school based on 5 categories, a school 2 ̆ 7 s socioeconomic index, and overall cognitive skills index (CSI). The dependent variable was <b>adequate</b> <b>yearly</b> student <b>progress</b> as measured by Indiana 2 ̆ 7 s ISTEP+ examination. ^ An existing survey, School As A Caring Community Profile-II (SCCP-II) (Lickona 2 ̆ 6 Davidson, 2003), was used to gather data on five subscales related to social and emotional learning in the middle school including perceptions of student respect, student friendship and belonging, student shaping of environment, support and care by and for faculty/staff, and support and care by and for parents. Separate surveys were used to gather information from adult and student participants in twelve schools serving grades 6 – 8. Responses were compared among students, parents, teachers, and administrators. One school from each of 12 Indiana Middle Level Education Association regions was included in the study. ^ Three statistical procedures were used to answer seven research questions and seven hypotheses. A two-way factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) procedure and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) were used to analyze data. Scheffe 2 ̆ 7 s post hoc test was used in general linear model calculations. Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient determined corollary relationships. ^ Perceptions of social and emotional learning were different in four of the six combinations of population groups. Differences existed between students and administrators, parents, and teachers as well as between parents and teachers. Differences could not be detected in perceived social and emotional learning among teachers or parents and administrators. A relationship could not be detected between perceptions of social and emotional learning and <b>adequate</b> <b>yearly</b> student <b>progress.</b> ...|$|R

I interviewed a purposeful sample of teachers of gifted students as well as administrators from these schools.

To conclude the data collection, I conducted focus group interviews with select participants.

40|$|Much {{research}} has been conducted on effective schools and school reform efforts. However, many schools are failing to meet the NCLB demands and an increasing number of schools are falling under the "in needs of improvement" sanctions, especially in the corrective action phase. The schools in the corrective action phase are those that have not met <b>Yearly</b> <b>Adequate</b> <b>Progress</b> (AYP) for three consecutive years. Current research suggests there may be more to school reform than intellectual and human capital investment. Reform efforts may require a shift in the way that change strategies are conceptualized and enacted within schools and the districts in which they reside. This shift would involve a move from a spotlight on individualized segments of the organization to engaging the entire system in a connected network. Therefore, {{the purpose of this study}} was to examine the processes school staff used to diagnose problems, define solutions, and access effective strategies in corrective action schools. It also investigated how these schools implemented these reforms; determined in what ways and to what extent these reform efforts were diffused through the schools using the social networks of information, innovation, trust, knowledge, and communication; and the district's role in supporting reform. The study utilized a mixed methods case study design and analyzed results through the lens of organizational learning and social network analysis theories.
