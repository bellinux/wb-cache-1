25|$|Wakka {{lost his}} younger brother Chappu to Sin {{a year before the}} events of Final Fantasy X, and he never fully {{recovered}} from it. He forms a close brotherly relationship with Tidus, partially fueled by his resemblance to Chappu, though Lulu constantly has to remind him that Tidus is not Chappu. As a devout follower of Yevon's teachings, Wakka believes that anyone who does not believe in Yevon, like the Al Bhed, <b>are</b> <b>evil</b> heathens, and is staunchly against the use of machina. However, he begins to question both his faith by the time Yevon's true colors are exposed to the world. Near the game's ending, Wakka denounces his prior beliefs entirely.|$|E

25|$|The wild {{worship of}} {{lawlessness}} and the materialist worship of law {{end in the}} same void. Nietzsche scales staggering mountains, but he turns up ultimately in Tibet. He sits down beside Tolstoy {{in the land of}} nothing and Nirvana. They are both helpless – one because he must not grasp anything, and the other because he must not let go of anything. The Tolstoyan's will is frozen by a Buddhist instinct that all special actions <b>are</b> <b>evil.</b> But the Nietzscheite's will is quite equally frozen by his view that all special actions are good; for if all special actions are good, none of them are special. They stand at the crossroads, and one hates all the roads and the other likes all the roads. The result is – well, some things are not hard to calculate. They stand at the cross-roads.|$|E
500|$|The story arc's {{primary purpose}} was to {{introduce}} the main characters, six children who discover their parents <b>are</b> <b>evil</b> after seeing them murder {{a girl in a}} sacrificial ceremony. It centers upon the children's relationships with their parents as the children learn that they themselves have inherited their parents' powers. Once The Pride realizes their offspring have disappeared, they begin to use their considerable influence to track down their sons and daughters. [...] "Pride & Joy" [...] sets up the main concept of the series, which involves children versus their parents.|$|E

Gevisser {{writes that the}} law's passage allowed the Russian government to find [...] "common ground" [...] with the nationalist far right, and also appeal to the many Russians who view [...] "homosexuality as a sign of encroaching decadence in a globalized era." [...] He writes: [...] "Many Russians feel they can steady themselves against this cultural tsunami by laying claim to 'traditional values,' of which rejection of homosexuality is the easiest shorthand. This message plays particularly well for a government wishing to mobilize against demographic decline (childless homosexuals <b>are</b> <b>evil)</b> and cozy up to the Russian Orthodox Church (homosexuals with children are evil)." ...|$|E

The same year, Chicago-based RedEye ranked it the fifth greatest South Park episode. In 2007, Lorne Chan of the San Antonio Express-News declared it the second best sport-themed South Park, behind [...] "Up the Down Steroid", praising its satire of gambling on elementary schools and sports events. Also in 2007, Travis Fickett of IGN gave the episode an 8.4 out of 10 rating and identified several [...] "great moments". In particular, he praised closeted-homosexual Mr. Garrison's claim that gay people <b>are</b> <b>evil</b> and have a [...] "black vomitous fluid" [...] running through their veins, and the moment when Jesus was about to explain his feelings regarding homosexuality only to be cut off by [...] "Marty's Movie Reviews".|$|E
500|$|In Tolkien's view, {{the poem}} is {{essentially}} about a [...] "man {{at war with the}} hostile world, and his inevitable overthrow in Time". The underlying tragedy is man's brief mortal life. Grendel and the dragon are identified as enemies of a Christian God, unlike the monsters encountered by Odysseus on his travels. What had happened is that Northern courage, exultant, defiant in the face of inevitable defeat by [...] "Chaos and Unreason" [...] (Tolkien cites Ker's words), fuses with a Christian faith and outlook. The Beowulf poet uses both what he knew to be the old heroic tradition, darkened by distance in time, along with the newly acquired Christian tradition. The Christian, Tolkien notes, is [...] "hemmed in a hostile world", and the monsters <b>are</b> <b>evil</b> spirits: but as the transition was incomplete in the poem, the monsters remain real and the focus remains [...] "an ancient theme: that man, each man and all men, and all their works shall die".|$|E
500|$|Since Huffs {{conclusion}} in 2006, Azaria {{has continued to}} make multiple film appearances. He played the smooth-talking Whit in David Schwimmer's directorial debut Run Fatboy Run (2007). During production he became good friends with co-star Simon Pegg, performing The Simpsons voices on request, frequently distracting Pegg when {{he was supposed to}} be filming. He worked with Stiller again on 2009's [...] in which Azaria played the villainous pharaoh Kah Mun Rah, utilizing a Boris Karloff accent. Although the film received mixed reviews, critics praised Azaria's performance. Perry Seibert of TV Guide wrote that [...] "thanks to Azaria, a master of comic timing. His grandiose, yet slightly fey bad guy is equally funny when he's chewing out minions as he is when deliberating if Oscar the Grouch and Darth Vader <b>are</b> <b>evil</b> enough to join his team." [...] He appeared as Abraham in Year One (2009), Dr. Knight in 2010's Love & Other Drugs, and played Deep Throat director Gerard Damiano in Lovelace (2013).|$|E

500|$|Head writer Chris Chibnall had {{originally}} conceived {{the idea of}} a [...] "rogue Time Agent" [...] character during the production of Torchwood series 1, but the idea never made it to TV screens. After watching episodes of executive producer Russell T Davies' revival of Torchwoods parent series Doctor Who, Marsters and his agent got in touch with Davies about appearing in the series. Davies vetoed the idea, but suggested that Marsters be part of Torchwoods second series instead. After Marsters expressed interest in Torchwood, Chibnall and Davies felt that he would be perfect for the role of the Time Agent character. Chibnall immediately produced the script for [...] "Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang", which introduced the character. He sent it off to Marsters [...] "and essentially got agreement straight away". Masters accepted the role {{on the basis of a}} [...] "really good script" [...] and [...] "a really fun character" [...] stating that as an actor he is attracted to [...] "playing people who <b>are</b> <b>evil,</b> don't care, and have no guilt." [...] In an interview published to the BBC online news website in July 2007, Marsters indicated that he was [...] "really" [...] excited about his character, who he revealed would be [...] "naughty" [...] and [...] "a bit of a psychopath." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviews for {{the episode}} ranged from mixed to negative. TV Squad writer Jane Boursaw noted that Broyles [...] "is surely {{one of the}} most intense guys on TV", and also enjoyed Walter's scenes. Josie Kafka from Open Salon thought the fringe cases each week were [...] "an odd way to build a mythology: the Big Secret seems to be that people in {{positions}} of power <b>are</b> <b>evil</b> and do evil things, often for money. But if Peter's right, and all these stand-alones are also detailing a series of steps taken by the Big Bads in preparation for something... well, that's an exciting idea." [...] She gave it [...] "two out of four Expendable Gerbils." [...] io9's Annalee Newitz praised the episode, declaring it made her [...] "officially a watcher of Fringe, rather than a sampler". She continued, [...] "It {{was the first time that}} the show really gelled... I think Fringe hit its stride last night because it finally showed us our main characters' true strengths... More importantly, Fringe has finally gotten into its main groove: human experimentation. That's what links all the scooby gang's investigations together into the Pattern, and that's what makes this show particularly timely in an age when people are scared of how biotechnology will change humanity." ...|$|E

2500|$|Regarding emotion (used synonymously {{with the}} word [...] "passion" [...] in this context), which, {{following}} John Damascene, Aquinas defines as [...] "a movement of the sensitive appetite when we imagine good or evil," [...] Thomism repudiates both the Epicurean view that happiness consists in pleasure (sensual experiences that invoke positive emotion), and the Stoic view that emotions are vices by nature. Aquinas takes a moderate view of emotion, quoting Augustine: [...] "They <b>are</b> <b>evil</b> if our love is evil; good if our love is good." [...] While most emotions are morally neutral, some are inherently virtuous (e.g. pity) and some are inherently vicious (e.g. envy).|$|E
