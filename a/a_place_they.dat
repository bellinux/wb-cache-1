5|$|Kunivas' {{condition}} worsens, and Korris, Konmel, and Worf {{are present}} when he dies, {{and the three}} let out a fierce roar as per Klingon custom. As they return to the Klingons' quarters, Konmel is disappointed that Kunivas was not killed by an enemy, leading Worf to question {{the nature of the}} attack on the freighter; Korris and Konmel quickly change the subject. Worf forces Korris to reveal the truth: the three had commandeered the freighter, in order to seek out <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>they</b> could live as true Klingons, and the damage to the freighter was a result of a battle with a Klingon ship. When the two are seen near the ship's battle bridge, hoping to steal the drive section and escape the crew on the saucer, they are placed in the brig.|$|E

In 2012, Florida State was victorious with a 49–37 comeback win over the Tigers in Tallahassee en route to an Atlantic Division title and an ACC Championship. Florida State last {{traveled to}} Death Valley in 2011, a game the Seminoles lost 35–30, furthering their win drought in Clemson, <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>they</b> have not won at since 2001.

25|$|The {{feeling that}} the early 20th century was an era of {{economic}} growth due to technological advances contrasted dramatically with {{the standard of living}} of lower social classes. The growth of the previous decades led to an unprecedented population explosion starting in 1929. The Great Depression caused the collapse of the nitrate industry in the north, leaving 60,000 unemployed, which added to the decline in agricultural exports, resulting in a total number for the unemployed to be about 300,000 nationwide. These unemployed workers saw Santiago and its booming industry as the only chance to survive. Many migrants arrived in Santiago with nothing and thousands had to survive on the streets due to the great difficulty in finding <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>they</b> could rent. Widespread disease, including tuberculosis, claimed the lives of hundreds of the homeless. Unemployment and living costs increased dramatically whilst the salaries of the population of Santiago fell.|$|E
25|$|In 1576, the {{governor}} of a province in Northern Argentina commissioned the military {{to search for a}} huge mass of iron, which he had heard that Natives used for their weapons. The Natives claimed that the mass had fallen from the sky in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>they</b> called Piguem Nonralta which the Spanish translated as Campo del Cielo ("Field of Heaven"). The expedition found a large mass of metal protruding out of the soil. They assumed it was an iron mine and brought back a few samples, which were described as being of unusual purity. The governor documented the expedition and deposited the report in the Archivo General de Indias in Seville, but it was quickly forgotten and later reports on that area merely repeated the Native legends. Following the legends, in 1774 Don Bartolomé Francisco de Maguna rediscovered the iron mass which he called el Meson de Fierro ("the Table of Iron"). Maguna thought the mass was the tip of an iron vein. The next expedition, led by Rubin de Celis in 1783, used explosives to clear the ground around the mass and found that it was probably a single stone. Celis estimated its mass as 15 tonnes and abandoned it as worthless. He himself did not believe that the stone had fallen from the sky and assumed that it had formed by a volcanic eruption. However, he sent the samples to the Royal Society of London and published his report in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. Those samples were later analyzed and found to contain 90% iron and 10% nickel and assigned to a meteoritic origin.|$|E

His mother, Davinia, was unable to work for three months after Parker's funeral and came close to {{attempting}} suicide on a number of occasions. Parker's room was left largely untouched for three years after the incident because his parents were reluctant to tidy it. They described the room as <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>they</b> [...] "feel close to Ross".|$|E
500|$|According to Schneider, Jonathan is [...] "perfectly {{willing to}} go to jail, or worse, to protect his son". The actor characterizes Jonathan as fast to lose his temper, which Schneider views as being a {{development}} of his protective nature over his family. Schneider believes that the season two episode [...] "Suspect"—where Jonathan is arrested, but his sole concern is protecting Clark's secret—summarizes the character well, and shows that the [...] "least important person in Jonathan's life is Jonathan". Schneider admits that occasionally he and Annette O'Toole have to [...] "police" [...] the creative team {{when it comes to the}} relationship between Martha, Jonathan, and Clark. According to Schneider, there are moments where they have to make sure that the characters are not taken to <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>they</b> would not normally go, specifically where the parents are useless without the [...] "innate intelligence of [...] teenager".|$|E
500|$|The {{clearing}} party {{made it to}} the top of a ridge, {{now known}} as Barlow Pass, where they were effectively lost. [...] Barlow, Palmer, and a man named Lock hiked the south face of Mount Hood west of Palmer Glacier to scout a westward route off the mountain. Palmer, in better physical condition than his companions, climbed high on the glacier (likely Zigzag Glacier), and took detailed notes on the surrounding ridges and rivers. They returned to the group, arranged for guards for their wagons at <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>they</b> named Fort Deposit. Several families in wagons ill-suited for travel through the wilderness remained at Fort Deposit, while the remainder returned to The Dalles. [...] Barlow's group followed the Sandy River west on foot. [...] Palmer noted an intersection with a trail coming from The Dalles by way of Lolo Pass, around the north side of Mount Hood, which had previously been the only overland trail traversed by pioneers. Near the present-day city of Sandy, they turned southwest to reach Eagle Creek and Philip Foster's farm near present-day Clackamas.|$|E

2500|$|Although the Lewis and Clark Expedition {{encountered}} the Shoshone in 1805-06 {{they did not}} pass through the Shoshone Falls area. The 1811 Wilson Price Hunt Expedition, whose goal was to scout routes for the growing fur trade, traveled down the Snake River {{at least as far}} as present-day American Falls, but most likely did not make it to Shoshone Falls due to the increasingly dangerous river conditions downstream, ultimately turning back at <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>they</b> called [...] "Devil's Scuttle Hole". However, the route they pioneered would become part of the Oregon Trail, which would later bring many emigrants from the eastern United States to the Shoshone Falls area. The falls were also called [...] "Canadian Falls" [...] by some early explorers, though the origin of this name is not certain.|$|E

2500|$|Besides {{exploring}} and working as scientists, women have also played supportive roles as wives, fund-raisers, publicists, historians, curators and administrators of organizations {{and services that}} support Antarctic operations. Many early women on Antarctica were the wives of explorers. Some women worked with Antarctica from afar, crafting policies for <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>they</b> had never seen. Women who wished to have larger roles in Antarctica and on the continent itself had to [...] "overcome gendered assumptions about the ice and surmount bureaucratic inertia. As women began to break into fields in Antarctica, they found {{that it could be}} difficult to compete against men who already had the [...] "expeditioner experience" [...] needed for permanent science positions.

2500|$|To {{extend their}} food supply, they ate portulaca. Gray also caught an [...] Python (probably Aspidites melanocephalus, a black-headed python), which they ate. Both Burke and Gray {{immediately}} {{came down with}} dysentery. Gray was ill, but Burke thought he was [...] "gammoning" [...] (pretending). On 25 March on the Burke River (just south {{of what is now}} the town of Boulia), Gray was caught stealing skilligolee (a type of watery porridge) and Burke beat him. By 8 April Gray could not walk; he died on 17 April of dysentery at <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>they</b> called Polygonum Swamp. The location of Gray's death is unknown, although it is generally believed to be Lake Massacre in South Australia. While the possibility that Burke killed Gray has been discounted, the severity of the beating Burke gave has been widely debated. The three surviving men stopped for a day to bury Gray, and to recover their strength—they were by this stage very weak from hunger and exhaustion. They finally reached Cooper Creek on 21 April, only to find that the camp had been abandoned several hours earlier.|$|E
