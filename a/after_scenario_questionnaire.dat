40|$|A major {{learning}} difficulty of Japanese foreign language (JFL) learners is the complex composition of two syllabaries, hiragana and katakana, and kanji characters adopted from logographic Chinese ones. As {{the number of}} Japanese language learners increases, computer-assisted Japanese language education gradually gains more attention. This study aimed to adopt a Japanese word segmentation system to help JFL learners overcome literacy problems. This study adopted MeCab, a Japanese morphological analyzer and part-of-speech (POS) tagger, to segment Japanese texts into separate morphemes by adding spaces and to attach POS tags to each morpheme for beginners. The {{participants were asked to}} participate in three experimental activities involvingwatching two Japanese videos with general or segmented Japanese captions and complete the Nielsen’s Attributes of Usability (NAU) survey and the <b>After</b> <b>Scenario</b> <b>Questionnaire</b> (ASQ) to evaluate the usability of the learning activities. The results of the system evaluation showed that the videos with the segmented captions could increase the participants’ learning motivation and willingness to adopt the word segmentation system to learn Japanese...|$|E

The <b>scenario</b> <b>questionnaire,</b> which included eight items, asked respondents to role-play {{the victim of a}} sexual harassment incident and indicate their perceptions of the situation. They also responded to a 19 -item generalized measure of attitudes toward sexual harassment (Mazer and Percival, 1989). Both measures were scored using a 7 -point Likert scale. Results are interpreted in the context of perceptual differences of sexual harassment across respondent race and sex. Implications for workplace intervention are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{sources of}} influences connecting mothers' and their children's anxious cognitions, 65 children (aged 10 to 11 years) completed self-report measures of anxiety. Children and mothers responded to an ambiguous <b>scenario</b> <b>questionnaire</b> {{and measures of}} parenting style and life events. Mothers also reported expectations about their child's reaction to ambiguous situations. Mothers' and children's threat cognitions were significantly correlated (r =. 31), and partially mediated by mothers' expectations about their child. Mothers' anticipated distress was associated with expectations for their child's distress, which {{was associated with the}} child's own anticipated distress. Parenting and life events were significantly associated with children's interpretative bias, but did not mediate the intergenerational association in interpretative bias. The results suggest influences on children's 'anxious cognitive style' and potential targets for preventing and reducing maladaptive cognitions in children...|$|R

40|$|While risk {{behavior}} {{has been studied}} intensely {{and a large number}} of risk perception studies are available, far less research exists regarding people's mind-sets towards risk-taking, i. e., risk attitudes, such as, risk propensity and risk aversion. These can be conceptualized as two poles of a one-dimensional attitude towards risk-taking but also as two separate concepts. It is widely assumed that people differ considerably in their attitude towards risks, ranging from cautiousness to risk-seeking and even pleasure in risk-taking. However, there is no convincing evidence that this presumed dimension is a general trait (rather than a state, or a domain-specific attitude, e. g., distinct for physical, financial, or social risks people may encounter). Furthermore, basically no established measurement tools exist. In this contribution, the conceptualization of risk attitudes will be outlined, several new instruments (Risk Orientations Questionnaire, Risk Propensity <b>Questionnaire,</b> Risk <b>Scenarios</b> <b>Questionnaire,</b> Risk Motivations Questionnaire) presented and empirical finding...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is to develop a novel {{approach}} to e-participation, which is based on “passive crowdsourcing ” by government agencies, exploiting the extensive political content continuously created in numerous Web 2. 0 social media (e. g. political blogs and microblogs, news sharing sites and online forums) by citizens without government stimulation, to understand better their needs, issues, opinions, proposals and arguments concerning a particular domain of government activity or public policy. Design/methodology/approach – This approach is developed and elaborated through cooperation withpotential users experienced in the design of public policies from three countries (Austria,Greece and the UK), using a combination of quantitative and qualitative techniques: co-operative development of application <b>scenarios,</b> <b>questionnaire</b> surveys, focus groups andworkshops and, finally, in-depth interviews. Findings – A process model for the application of the proposed passive crowdsourcing approach has been developed, which is quite different from the one of the usual active crowdsourcing. Based on it, the functional architecture of the required supporting information and communication technologies (ICT) infrastructure has been formulated, and then its technological architecture has been designed...|$|R
40|$|The {{goals of}} the present study were: 1) to {{describe}} and provide initial support for the validity of the Future <b>Scenarios</b> <b>Questionnaire</b> (FSQ), a new self-report questionnaire designed to measure parental responding to anticipated children’s negative emotions; and 2) to examine how maternal responses on the FSQ related to young children’s aggressive, asocial, and prosocial behaviors with peers. Further, this study examined whether the temperamental trait of negative affect moderated the relation between maternal responses on the FSQ and children’s social adjustment outcomes. Participants were 92 mothers of preschool-age children (43 boys and 49 girls; M age 61. 5 months). Mothers provided ratings on the FSQ and child temperament ratings on the Child Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ; Rothbart, Ahadi, & Hershey, 1994). They also completed a range of measures which were included to assess the construct validity of the FSQ. These included measures of attachment representations, maternal mind-mindedness, perceived control, and alexithymia. Sixty-nine teachers provided ratings on the Child Behavior Scale (CBS; Ladd & Profilet, 1996) for children’s aggressive, asocial, and prosocial behaviors in the peer context...|$|R
40|$|Searching for {{images is}} an {{everyday}} activity. Nevertheless, even a highly skilled searcher often struggles {{to find what}} they are looking for. This article studies the factors that affect users&# 039; online web image search behaviour, investigating (1) the use of criteria in making image relevance judgements and (2) the effect of familiarity, difficulty and satisfaction. The study includes 48 users who performed four online image search tasks using Google Images. Simulated work <b>scenarios,</b> <b>questionnaires</b> and screen capture recordings were used to collect data of their image search behaviour. The results show in judging image relevance, users may apply similar criterion, however, {{the importance of these}} criteria depends on the type of image search. Similarly, ratings of users&# 039; perception on subjective aspects of performing image search shows they were task dependent. Users&# 039; perception on subjective aspects of performing image search did not always correspond with their actual search behaviour. Correlation analysis shows that subjective factors cannot be definitively measured by using only one component of search behaviour. Future work includes further analysis on the effects of topic familiarity and satisfaction...|$|R

Informally speaking also, individuals {{carry out this}} planning function {{on a day-to-day basis}} whether consciously or unconsciously, however, it is apparent to be the only means through which inadequate human and material resources can be thoughtfully and efficiently distributed to meet varying needs and wants of the community. Planning precedes other functions of management process such as organizing, staffing, leading and controlling. This study seeks to investigate the relationship that is inherent between these two terminologies “Strategic Planning and Marketing Operations ” and how they reflect on the performance of government owned and managed companies especially in Power Holding Company of Nigeria (PHCN) as a case <b>scenario.</b> <b>Questionnaires</b> were distributed to staff of PHCN and the data was analyzed using mean score analysis and correlation. The research findings revealed that strategic planning contributes substantially to the effectiveness of marketing operations in public corporations.

40|$|The revised-Reinforcement Sensitivity Theory (r-RST; Gray & McNaughton, 2000) proposes three neurologically-based systems {{underlie}} behaviour, the Behavioural Approach System (BAS), the Fight-Flight-Freeze System (FFFS), and the Behavioural Inhibition System (BIS). Central to {{the revision}} of RST is the parsing of fear (FFFS) and Anxiety (BIS). Based {{on the findings}} of Blanchard and Blanchard (1989), Gray and McNaughton (2000) predict that fear is associated with orientation away from threat, while anxiety is associated with orientation toward threat. Perkins and Corr (2006) demonstrated support for this hypothesis using trait measures of anxiety and fear that were not specifically developed to measure RST. In a sample of 197 participants, the current thesis attempted to replicate and extend the Perkins and Corr (2006) study with the use of two newly developed measures of the RST, namely the Jackson- 5 (Jackson, 2009) and the RST-PQ (Corr & Cooper, in prep). The Threat <b>Scenario</b> <b>Questionnaire,</b> developed by Blanchard et al. (2001) was used to measure defensive reactions. Contrary to expectations, the BIS and FFFS failed to predict orientation towards threat and orientation away from threat respectively. These findings suggest further refinement of the measures is necessary to test the predictions of RST...|$|R
40|$|The {{extent to}} which {{cognitive}} models of development and maintenance of depression apply to adolescents is largely untested, despite the widespread application of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) for depressed adolescents. Cognitive models suggest that negative cognitions, including interpretation bias, {{play a role in}} etiology and maintenance of depression. Given that cognitive development is incomplete by the teenage years and that CBT is not superior to non-cognitive treatments in the treatment of adolescent depression, it is important to test the underlying model. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} test the hypothesis that interpretation biases are exhibited by depressed adolescents. Four groups of adolescents were recruited: clinically-referred depressed (n = 27), clinically-referred non-depressed (n = 24), community with elevated depression symptoms (n = 42) and healthy community (n = 150). Participants completed a 20 item ambiguous <b>scenarios</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> Clinically-referred depressed adolescents made significantly more negative interpretations and rated scenarios as less pleasant than all other groups. The results suggest that this element of the cognitive model of depression is applicable to adolescents. Other aspects of the model should be tested so that cognitive treatment can be modified or adapted if necessary...|$|R
40|$|The intergenerational {{transmission}} of anxious cognitions and behaviors {{may be a}} possible mechanism underlying concordance between maternal and child anxieties. By disambiguating ambiguous situations for their child in a threatening manner, anxious mothers may `train their children towards a general tendency to also interpret ambiguity in a threatening way. Ninety-two children and their mothers completed trait anxiety measures. Children completed two ambiguous <b>scenario</b> <b>questionnaires,</b> to measure their own interpretations of ambiguous situations (ASQ-C) and to measure their expectations of their mother's interpretation and behavior in response to ambiguous situations involving them (ASQ-EM). Maternal and child anxiety were significantly correlated. Children who made threat interpretations also anticipated that their mother would disambiguate situations for them in a threatening way. The relationship between maternal anxiety and child threat cognitions was mediated by children's expectations of how their mother would disambiguate situations for them when taken together with children's trait anxiety. The present findings provide preliminary support for the suggestion that children of anxious mothers may learn to interpret and respond to ambiguous situations based on how their mothers have interpreted ambiguous situations {{for them in the}} past...|$|R

We aimed to determine the proportion of home care workers and older people receiving care in a Romanian home care service who correctly identified elder abuse in a vignette, and who had detected elder abuse at work. Methods: In 2009, care workers and clients of a non-government home care organization serving four areas in Romania completed the Caregiver <b>Scenario</b> <b>Questionnaire</b> to measure ability to identify abuse. We asked the professionals whether they had detected a case of abuse. Results: 35 (100 %) professionals and 79 (65. 8 %) older people took part. Four (11. 4 %) professionals had encountered a case of elder abuse, two (5. 7 %) in the last year. No staff and only one older person correctly identified all four abusive strategies in a vignette. Staff with more professional caregiving experience recognized fewer abusive strategies (r = − 0. 46, p = 0. 007). Conclusion: Rates of identification were worryingly low among all professionals, and this was more marked if they had worked longer, suggesting their experiences may have reduced their ability to detect it. Mandatory abuse training for care professionals, and strategies to support reporters of suspected abuse, could help improve the management of elder abuse in all countries.
