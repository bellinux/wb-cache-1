500|$|Ray Banks {{was born}} in Kirkcaldy, Scotland, and spent two years {{studying}} performance art and theatre at Warwick University. Banks {{said in an interview}} with the Newcastle Evening Chronicle that leaving Warwick University led him to become a published writer. Banks said, [...] "If I'd stayed on, I probably would have gone down the acting route instead of writing. University isn't for everyone <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> that the other writers I know didn't finish their courses either. It was certainly the best thing that happened to me." ...|$|E
500|$|Tittle {{threw the}} ball from a sidearm, almost underhand position, {{something}} novel at those times, though it was common practice in earlier decades. It was this seemingly underhand style that drew the curiosity and admiration of many fans. In tandem with his baldness—for which he was frequently {{referred to as the}} [...] "Bald Eagle"—he made for a very striking personality. Despite his throwing motion, he had a very strong and accurate arm with a quick release. It was because of his quick release and ability to read defenses that {{he became one of the}} best screen passers in the NFL. He was a perfectionist and highly competitive, and he expected the same of his teammates. He possessed rare leadership and game-planning skills, and played with great enthusiasm even in his later years. [...] "Tittle has the attitude of a high school kid, with the brain of a computer," [...] said Giants teammate Frank Gifford. Baltimore Colts halfback Lenny Moore, when asked in 1963 to compare Tittle and Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas, said:I played with Tittle in the Pro Bowl two years ago, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> he's quite a guy... He and John, however, are entirely different types... Tittle is a sort of 'con man' with his players... he comes into a huddle and 'suggests' that maybe this or that will work on account of something he saw happen on a previous play... The way he puts it, you're convinced it's a good idea and maybe it will work. John, now, he's a take-charge guy... you what the other guy's going to do, what he's going to do, and what he wants you to do.|$|E
2500|$|The study Holy Feast and Holy Fast, my most {{influential}} book, arose almost seamlessly from [...] "Jesus as Mother." [...] Having explored the pressures and opportunities that led certain groups of religious men to use explicitly gendered images {{for themselves and}} for the divine, I was curious about whether religious women did so. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>discovered,</b> again to put it a bit simply, that what seemed distinctive about woman-authored texts and male accounts of women was not awareness of gender or complex and self-conscious use of gendered language, but food images and food practices. Although misunderstood by some critics as [...] "essentializing" [...] (this was a nasty charge in the 1990s) or as a glorification of female masochism, {{it was in fact}} neither. The argument that women’s texts were characterized by specific metaphors and their lives by specific behaviors was not the imposition of modern assumptions about [...] "woman." [...] It was empirical, based on a careful comparison of female-authored texts about the divine, female-authored texts about women, and male-authored texts about women, with texts about men by religious men, such as St. Francis of Assisi or Heinrich Suso, who appeared to be closest in their spirituality to that of women.|$|E

60|$|Don Ant. Yes, I loved her, till I {{found she}} wouldn't love me, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> that she hadn't a good feature in her face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then if I {{get out of}} my depth you mustn't blame me. By <b>and</b> by <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> that charm wasn't {{the right}} word--the place was {{permeated}} with a narcotic spell." ...|$|R
2500|$|I {{think it}} was the first summer I was at Harvard as a student, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> a {{wonderful}} bookstore there where I could get modern poetry – which I'd never been able to lay my hands on very much until then – and they had the original edition of The Darkening Ecliptic with the Sidney Nolan cover. [...] I always had a taste for sort of wild experimental poetry – of which there really wasn't very much in English in America at the time – and this poet suited me very well. [...] I am obliged to give a final examination in my poetry writing course , which I'm always rather hard put to do, since we haven't really studied anything. The students have been writing poems of varying degrees of merit, and though I give them reading lists they tend to ignore them, after first demanding them. And the way the course is set up {{there is no way of}} examining them on their reading. And anyway they shouldn't have to pass an examination because they're poets who are writing poetry, and I don't like the idea of grading poems. So in order to pass the examination time I had to think of various subterfuges, and one of them is to use one of Malley's poems and another forbiddingly modern poem – frequently one of Geoffrey Hill's 'Mercian Hymns'. And asking them if they can guess which one is the real poem by a respected contemporary poet, and which one is a put-on intended to ridicule modern poetry, and what are their reasons. And I think they are right about fifty per cent of the time, identifying the fraud... fraudulent poem.|$|E
6000|$|... "Precisely," [...] {{answered}} Madame la Vicomtesse. [...] "When I reached {{home last}} night I questioned Antoinette, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> that by a singular chance {{a message from}} Auguste had already reached her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Say, I've fixed them," [...] whispered Giles Faswig, {{with a wink}} at Lemon. [...] "I'll {{tell you}} about it later. I took a walk late last night, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> they were camping not far from this spot." ...|$|E
5000|$|Moggi {{has spoken}} out against gay footballers, saying that: [...] "A {{homosexual}} can't fulfil {{the job of}} a footballer. I wouldn't put one under contract <b>and</b> if <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>I</b> had one, he would fly immediately." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Miss Anneke Mordaunt!" [...] {{was echoed}} round the table, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> soon <b>discovered</b> that Anneke {{was a general}} favourite, and a very common toast already at Albany.|$|R
60|$|At times, {{my memory}} reverts to Helena Gracedieu, <b>and</b> to what <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> when <b>I</b> {{had seen her}} diary.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} him bobbing and sidling {{at me that}} delightful afternoon when--what {{do you think of}} it, Susan?--Poppet <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> in each other an unfashionable taste for the truth!

6000|$|... "It is she {{who insists}} {{that it is}} always the same person," [...] he said. [...] "She thinks he will make himself known to me if {{anything}} happens to her."

6000|$|The tone of {{his words}} somehow made his ugly face beautiful, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> at this moment how much I really liked him. None the less, at the same time, perversely and rudely, I felt the droll side of our {{discussion}} of such alternatives. It made me laugh out and say to him while I laughed: [...] "You'd take her even with those things of Mrs. Meldrum's?" ...|$|E
60|$|We {{found nothing}} {{until we had}} reached a point a few miles above the spot where I had first seen the launch {{drifting}} down toward us, <b>and</b> there <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> {{the remnants of a}} recent camp fire.|$|R
5000|$|Nancy Alexander, {{director}} of the Rehoboth Art League, described the artist in these terms: [...] "Criss is an amazingly flexible artist.

6000|$|I {{had kept}} {{my eyes open}} for him from the beginning, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> {{that he was not}} at school, I had felt alarmed. Had Cynthia sent me down here, to work as I had never worked before, on a wild-goose chase? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Madam," [...] he said, [...] "I {{have told}} you everything, partly from respect for those who only by a grim {{sacrifice}} did what they could for me, and that you may realize the difference between myself and the rest at Silverdale. I want to be honest now at least, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>discovered,</b> not without bitterness at the time, that the barriers between our castes are strong in the old country." ...|$|E
60|$|He had {{a hundred}} virtues, {{including}} the capital virtue of good humour, {{and we had}} no difficulty in changing the subject and forgetting the disagreement. He talked about society, his town friends and his country sports, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> in the course of it that he was a county magistrate, a Member of Parliament, and a director of several important companies. He was also that other thing, which I did not tell him.|$|E
60|$|It {{was during}} the sixth winter in our cave that Lop-Ear <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> that we were really growing up. From the first {{it had been a}} squeeze to get in through the entrance-crevice. This had had its advantages, however. It had {{prevented}} the larger Folk from taking our cave away from us. And it was a most desirable cave, the highest on the bluff, the safest, and in winter the smallest and warmest.|$|E
6000|$|So {{we began}} to talk about school <b>and</b> lessons, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> soon <b>discovered</b> that the girl was a clever scholar, whose only {{drawback}} was, as she confided to me, a [...] "love of fun." ...|$|R

40|$|Abridged basic {{dictionaries}} {{are rarely}} plumbed by serious word-watchers.

6000|$|... 'O, Nichola, that IS too bad! To {{let him go}} in that shabby way, when I {{would have}} given {{anything}} to know him! I have wanted to know him ever since I found out how much his experiences had dictated his statuary, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> them by seeing in a Jersey paper of the marriage of a person supposed to be his wife, who ran off with him many years ago, don't you know, and then wouldn't marry him, in obedience to some novel social principles she had invented for herself.' ...|$|E
60|$|Dick galloped {{off through}} the forest, and Hiram went down the slope in almost the {{opposite}} direction. Left alone, I turned my horse and drove the pack-ponies along our back-trail. Thus engaged, I began to recover somewhat from the terror that had stupefied me. Still, I kept looking back. I found {{the mouth of the}} canyon and the trail, and in what I thought a very short time I reached the bare, rocky spot where we had last camped. The horses all drank thirstily, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> that I was hot and dry.|$|E
60|$|The street rang {{with the}} cheer that followed, and when Dixon seized his hat {{the action was}} infectious. The next minute we were moving forward amid {{the ranks of the}} {{enthusiastic}} crowd behind the vehicle, which jolted slowly towards the station; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> later that the uncomfortable sensation {{at the back of my}} neck was caused by the hot oil from a torch, which dripped upon it. In the meantime I noticed nothing but the sea of faces, the tramp of feet, and the final burst of cheering at the station, in which Mackay, holding aloft his forage cap, joined vociferously.|$|E
40|$|Financial {{analysis}} of company {{is very important}} instrument of corporate affairs. My work deals with complex financial {{analysis of}} company Matex HK s. r. o. since 2004 till 2008. I primarily focus on horizontal and vertical analysis, ration and distance indicators analysis, EVA analysis, ROE analysis <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>discover</b> by the help of models of bankruptcy if company is threatened by bankrupt. I judge too, if company is run by some recommended rules, example by gold balance rules. Next I accentuate on compare with branches. End of my work answers on questions about total status of company <b>and</b> <b>I</b> here put forward my suggestions, which should improve financial health of company...|$|R
60|$|I {{never had}} more than one {{conversation}} with either Neb or his wife, on the subject of wages, <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> how tender a thing it was, with the fellow, to place him on a level with the other hired people of my farm and household.|$|R
40|$|Mathematical Pedagogical Content Knowledge(MPCK) is the {{knowledge}} {{about how to}} express, represent and interpret the mathematics knowledge {{in order to make}} students easily accept and understand. As the core of {{the knowledge}} structure, MPCK is the key characteristics of mathematics teachers, which make them different from mathematicians and the teachers of other projects, it is also the important reflection of mathematics teachers' professional development. This directly relates to their level and ability of mathematics teaching in the future. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>discover</b> it still has some shortage, based on this analysis conclusion, I propose some advice for developing MPCK...|$|R
6000|$|His brother disdained reply, or was {{too much}} absorbed in his tale to think of any. [...] "When the girl opened the door <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> my fix I burst out, 'Good Lord!' and I stuck the bunch of flowers at her, and turned and ran. I suppose I must have had some notion of {{overtaking}} the car with my picture in it. But the best I could do was to let the next one overtake me several blocks down Marlborough Street, and carry me to the little jumping-off station on Westchester Park, {{as we used to}} call it in those days, {{at the end of the}} Back Bay line.|$|E
60|$|Sure enough, in but {{a little}} while after, he fell into a sleep as gentle as an infant's, which insensibly changed into the sleep of death. I had my arm about his body {{at the time and}} remarked nothing, unless it were that he once {{stretched}} himself a little, so kindly the end came to that disastrous life. It was only at our evening halt that the Major <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> we were travelling alone with the poor clay. That night we stole a spade from a field--I think near Market Bosworth--and a little farther on, in a wood of young oak trees, and by the light of King's lantern, we buried the old soldier of the Empire with both prayers and tears.|$|E
60|$|When {{they had}} left the street I {{examined}} the house leisurely, and a droll house it is. Seen from the front it appears to consist of a door and a window, though above them the trained eye may detect another window, the air-hole of some apartment which {{it would be just}} like Mary's grandiloquence to call her bedroom. The houses on each side of this bandbox are tall, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> later that it had once been an open passage to the back gardens. The story and a half of which it consists had been knocked up cheaply, by carpenters I should say rather than masons, and the general effect is of a brightly coloured van that has stuck for ever on its way through the passage.|$|E

60|$|Instantly {{her white}} lids veiled her eyes, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>discovered</b> a {{delicate}} flush tingeing her cheek. Evidently she was embarrassed at having been {{detected in the}} act of staring at a lesser creature, I thought.|$|R
