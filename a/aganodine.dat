40|$|In {{segments}} of human right atrial appendages and pulmonary arteries preincubated with [3 H]-noradrenaline and superfused with physiological salt solution containing desipramine and corticosterone, {{the involvement of}} imidazoline receptors in the modulation of [3 H]-noradrenaline release was investigated. In human atrial appendages, the guanidines <b>aganodine</b> and DTG (1, 3 -di(2 -tolyl) guanidine) which activate presynaptic imidazoline receptors, inhibited electrically-evoked [3 H]-noradrenaline release. The inhibition was not affected by blockade of α 2 -adrenoceptors with 1 [*]μM rauwolscine, but antagonized by extremely high concentrations of this drug (10 and/or 30 [*]μM; apparent pA 2 against <b>aganodine</b> and DTG: 5. 55 and 5. 21, respectively). In the presence of 1 [*]μM rauwolscine, [3 H]-noradrenaline release in human atrial appendages was also inhibited by the imidazolines idazoxan and cirazoline, but not by agmatine and noradrenaline. The inhibitory effects of 100 [*]μM idazoxan and 30 [*]μM cirazoline were abolished by 30 [*]μM rauwolscine. In the atrial appendages, the rank order of potency of all guanidines and imidazolines for their inhibitory effect on electrically-evoked [3 H]-noradrenaline release {{in the presence of}} 1 [*]μM rauwolscine was: aganodine⩾BDF[*] 6143 [4 -chloro- 2 -(2 -imidazolin- 2 -yl-amino) -isoindoline]>DTG⩾clonidine>cirazoline>idazoxan (BDF[*] 6143 and clonidine were previously studied under identical conditions). This potency order corresponded to that previously determined at the presynaptic imidazoline receptors in the rabbit aorta. When, in the experiments in the human pulmonary artery, rauwolscine was absent from the superfusion fluid, the concentration-response curve for BDF[*] 6143 (a mixed α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist/imidazoline receptor agonist) for its facilitatory effect on electrically-evoked [3 H]-noradrenaline release was bell-shaped. In the presence of 1 [*]μM rauwolscine, BDF[*] 6143 and cirazoline concentration-dependently inhibited the evoked [3 H]-noradrenaline release. In human atrial appendages, non-adrenoceptor [3 H]-idazoxan binding sites were identified and characterized. The binding of [3 H]-idazoxan was specific, reversible, saturable and of high affinity (KD: 25. 5 [*]nM). The specific binding of [3 H]-idazoxan (defined by cirazoline 0. 1 [*]mM) to membranes of human atrial appendages was concentration-dependently inhibited by several imidazolines and guanidines, but not by rauwolscine and agmatine. In most cases, the competition curves were best fitted to a two-site model. The rank order of affinity for the high affinity site (in a few cases for the only detectable site; cirazoline=idazoxan>BDF[*] 6143 >DTG⩾clonidine) is compatible with the pharmacological properties of I 2 -imidazoline binding sites, but is clearly different from the rank order of potency for inhibiting evoked noradrenaline release from sympathetic nerves in the same tissue. It is concluded that noradrenaline release in the human atrium and, less well established, in the pulmonary artery is inhibited via presynaptic imidazoline receptors. These presynaptic imidazoline receptors appear to be related to those previously characterized in rabbit aorta and pulmonary artery, but differ clearly from I 1 and I 2 imidazoline binding sites...|$|E
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{receptor}} acted upon by imidazoline compounds in the modulation of morphine analgesia. The effects of highly selective imidazoline ligands on the supraspinal antinociception induced by morphine in mice were determined. Intracerebroventricular (i. c. v.) or subcutaneous (s. c.) administration of ligands selective for the I 2 -imidazoline receptor, 2 -BFI, LSL 60101, LSL 61122 and <b>aganodine,</b> and the non selective ligand agmatine, increased morphine antinociception in a dose-dependent manner. Neither moxonidine, a mixed I 1 -imidazoline and α 2 -adrenoceptor agonist, RX 821002, a potent α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist that displays low affinity at I 2 -imidazoline receptors, nor the selective non-imidazoline α 2 -adrenoceptor antagonist RS- 15385 - 197, modified the analgesic responses to morphine. Administration of pertussis toxin (0. 25 [*]μg per mouse, i. c. v.) 6 {{days before the}} analgesic test blocked {{the ability of the}} I 2 -imidazoline ligands to potentiate morphine antinociception. The increased effect of morphine induced by I 2 -imidazoline ligands (agonists) was completely reversed by idazoxan and BU 224. Identical results were obtained with IBI, which alkylates I 2 -imidazoline binding sites. Thus, both agonist and antagonist properties of imidazoline ligands at the I 2 -imidazoline receptors were observed. Pre-treatment (30 [*]min) with deprenyl, an irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase B (IMAO-B), produced an increase of morphine antinociception. Clorgyline, an irreversible IMAO-A, given 30 [*]min before morphine did not alter the effect of the opioid. At longer intervals (24 [*]h) a single dose of either clorgyline or deprenyl reduced the density of I 2 -imidazoline receptors and prevented the I 2 -mediated potentiation of morphine analgesia. These results demonstrate functional interaction between I 2 -imidazoline and opioid receptors. The involvement of Gi-Go transducer proteins in this modulatory effect is also suggested...|$|E
