5|$|The <b>articular</b> cartilage's {{capacity}} for repair is limited: partial-thickness defects in the <b>articular</b> cartilage do not heal spontaneously, and injuries of the <b>articular</b> cartilage which fail to penetrate subchondral bone tend {{to lead to}} deterioration of the <b>articular</b> surface. As a result, surgery is often required in even moderate cases where the osteochondral fragment has not detached from the bone (Anderson StageII, III).|$|E
5|$|Another {{transitional}} {{feature of}} Dimetrodon is a ridge {{in the back}} of the jaw called the reflected lamina. The reflected lamina is found on the <b>articular</b> bone, which connects to the quadrate bone of the skull to form the jaw joint. In later mammal ancestors, the <b>articular</b> and quadrate separated from the jaw joint while the <b>articular</b> developed into the malleus bone of the middle ear. The reflected lamina became part of a ring called the tympanic annulus that supports the ear drum in all living mammals.|$|E
5|$|Continuous passive motion (CPM) {{has been}} used to improve healing of the <b>articular</b> surface during the {{postoperative}} period for people with full-thickness lesions. It has been shown to promote <b>articular</b> cartilage healing for small (< 3 mm in diameter) lesions in rabbits. Similarly, Rodrigo and Steadman reported that CPM for six hours per day for eight weeks produced an improved clinical outcome in humans.|$|E
5|$|If non-surgical {{measures}} are unsuccessful, drilling {{may be considered}} to stimulate healing of the subchondral bone. Arthroscopic drilling may be performed by using an antegrade (from the front) approach from the joint space through the <b>articular</b> cartilage, or by using a retrograde (from behind) approach through the bone outside of the joint to avoid penetration of the <b>articular</b> cartilage. This has proven successful with positive results at one-year follow-up with antegrade drilling in nine out of eleven teenagers with the juvenile form of OCD, and in 18 of 20 skeletally immature people (follow-up of five years) who had failed prior conservative programs.|$|E
5|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) {{is useful for}} staging OCD lesions, evaluating {{the integrity of the}} joint surface, and distinguishing normal variants of bone formation from OCD by showing bone and cartilage edema {{in the area of the}} irregularity. MRI provides information regarding features of the <b>articular</b> cartilage and bone under the cartilage, including edema, fractures, fluid interfaces, <b>articular</b> surface integrity, and fragment displacement. A low T1 and high T2 signal at the fragment interface is seen in active lesions. This indicates an unstable lesion or recent microfractures. While MRI and arthroscopy have a close correlation, X-ray films tend to be less inductive of similar MRI results.|$|E
5|$|Similar to OATS, arthroscopic <b>articular</b> {{cartilage}} paste grafting is {{a surgical}} procedure offering cost-effective, long-lasting results for stage IV lesions. A bone and cartilage paste derived from crushed plugs of the non-weight-bearing intercondylar notch can achieve pain relief, repair damaged tissue, and restore function.|$|E
5|$|Hadrocodium, whose fossils {{date from}} {{approximately}} 195 million years ago, {{in the early}} Jurassic, provides the first clear evidence of a jaw joint formed solely by the squamosal and dentary bones; there is no space in the jaw for the <b>articular,</b> a bone involved in the jaws of all early synapsids.|$|E
5|$|In {{attempts}} {{to address the}} weaker structure of the reparative fibrocartilage, new techniques {{have been designed to}} fill the defect with tissue that more closely simulates normal hyaline <b>articular</b> cartilage. One such technique is autologous chondrocyte implantation (ACI), which is useful for large, isolated femoral defects in younger people. In this surgery, chondrocytes are arthroscopically extracted from the intercondylar notch of the <b>articular</b> surface. The chondrocytes are grown and injected into the defect under a periosteal patch. ACI surgery has reported good to excellent results for reduced swelling, pain and locking in clinical follow-up examinations. However, some physicians have preferred to use undifferentiated pluripotential cells, such as periosteal cells and bone marrow stem cells, as opposed to chondrocytes. These too have demonstrated the ability to regenerate both the cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone.|$|E
5|$|In general, teleosts {{tend to be}} {{quicker and}} more {{flexible}} than more basal bony fishes. Their skeletal structure has evolved towards greater lightness. While teleost bones are well calcified, they are constructed from a scaffolding of struts, rather than the dense cancellous bones of holostean fish. In addition, the lower jaw of the teleost is reduced to just three bones; the dentary, the angular bone and the <b>articular</b> bone.|$|E
5|$|Jaw joint - The dentary (the {{lower jaw}} bone, which carries the teeth) and the squamosal (a small cranial bone) meet {{to form the}} joint. In most gnathostomes, {{including}} early therapsids, the joint consists of the <b>articular</b> (a small bone {{at the back of}} the lower jaw) and quadrate (a small bone {{at the back of the}} upper jaw).|$|E
5|$|Like Equijubus, Probactrosaurus, Gongpoquansaurus, {{and other}} styracosternans, Eolambia has {{cervical}} vertebrae {{which are very}} opisthocoelous, meaning that their front ends are strongly convex while their back ends are strongly concave. Unusually, {{the front end of}} the third cervical is set slightly higher than the back end, which is not seen in any other cervical vertebrae. Vertebrae from further back in the neck have a greater angle between the elongate <b>articular</b> processes known as the postzygapophyses, and also more elongate transverse processes. On the transverse processes, there are further <b>articular</b> processes – the rounded parapophyses and rod-like diapophyses – are located. In the rearmost cervicals, there is also a deep depression separating the postzygapophyses, and the neural spines have steeply-angled front margins, which has the effect of creating prominent spike-like projections.|$|E
5|$|Middle ear - In crown-group mammals, {{sound is}} carried from the eardrum by {{a chain of}} three bones, the malleus, the incus and the stapes. Ancestrally, the malleus and the incus are derived from the <b>articular</b> and the {{quadrate}} bones that constituted the jaw joint of early therapsids.|$|E
5|$|Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD or OD) {{is a joint}} {{disorder}} in which cracks form in the <b>articular</b> cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone. OCD usually causes pain and swelling of the affected joint which catches and locks during movement. Physical examination typically reveals an effusion, tenderness, and a crackling sound with joint movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{three small}} {{bones in the}} middle ear of mammals {{including}} humans, the malleus, incus, and stapes, are today used to transmit sound from the eardrum to the inner ear. The malleus and incus develop in the embryo from structures that form jaw bones (the quadrate and the <b>articular)</b> in lizards, and in fossils of lizard-like ancestors of mammals. Both lines of evidence show that these bones are homologous, sharing a common ancestor.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{features}} of the cervical vertebrae which distinguish Dinocephalosaurus from other protorosaurs include the low and keel-like neural spines, and the anterior and posterior (rear) <b>articular</b> surfaces of the vertebrae both being concave (amphicoelous). In the first ten vertebrae, the bottom margin is also concave. The long, slender cervical ribs bear frontal projections free of the vertebral bodies, which are also unique to Dinocephalosaurus. These ribs are aligned along the neck and bridge multiple consecutive vertebral joints, from two or three consecutive joints in the anterior the neck to five or six in the posterior neck. There appear to be no distinct processes on the vertebrae for articulation with the ribs.|$|E
5|$|However, {{he was a}} late scratch from a game on September 28 {{because of}} soreness in his ankle. An MRI the {{following}} day revealed major swelling in a weight-bearing bone in his ankle. Kemp was told that if he kept playing his ankle could break and leave him with chronic problems {{for the rest of}} his career. He was shut down, and the team announced he would not be available for the playoffs and would have surgery to repair the problem. Kemp suffered an <b>articular</b> talar injury requiring microfracture surgery to his talus bone.|$|E
5|$|Interestingly, {{although}} the centrum of Hatzegopteryx {{is much more}} robust than Arambourgiania, their ratios of bone radius to bone thickness (R/t) are roughly the same (9.45 for Hatzegopteryx and 9.9 for Arambourgiania). This may represent a compromise between increasing bending strength and buckling strength; higher R/t ratios lead to improved bending strength, but weaker buckling strength. To compensate for this, Hatzegopteryx shows {{a number of other}} adaptations to improve buckling strength, namely the distinctive internal structures of the bones and the large <b>articular</b> joints of the vertebrae, the latter of which helps to distribute stress.|$|E
5|$|OCD {{is caused}} by blood {{deprivation}} in the subchondral bone. This loss of blood flow causes the subchondral bone {{to die in a}} process called avascular necrosis. The bone is then reabsorbed by the body, leaving the <b>articular</b> cartilage it supported prone to damage. The result is fragmentation (dissection) of both cartilage and bone, and the free movement of these bone and cartilage fragments within the joint space, causing pain and further damage. OCD can be difficult to diagnose because these symptoms are found with other diseases. However, the disease can be confirmed by X-rays, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans.|$|E
5|$|The {{triggers}} for precipitation of {{uric acid}} {{are not well}} understood. While it may crystallize at normal levels, {{it is more likely}} to do so as levels increase. Other triggers believed to be important in acute episodes of arthritis include cool temperatures, rapid changes in uric acid levels, acidosis, <b>articular</b> hydration and extracellular matrix proteins, such as proteoglycans, collagens and chondroitin sulfate. The increased precipitation at low temperatures partly explains why the joints in the feet are most commonly affected. Rapid changes in uric acid may occur due to factors including trauma, surgery, chemotherapy, diuretics and stopping or starting allopurinol. Calcium channel blockers and losartan are associated with a lower risk of gout compared to other medications for hypertension.|$|E
5|$|A {{rehabilitation}} program often involves {{protection of the}} compromised <b>articular</b> surface and underlying subchondral bone combined with maintenance of strength and range of motion. Post-operative analgesics, namely a mix of opioids and NSAIDs, are usually required to control pain, inflammation and swelling. Straight leg raising and other isometric exercises are encouraged during the post-operative or immobilization period. A six to eight-week home or formal physical therapy program is usually instituted once the immobilization period has ended, incorporating range of motion, stretching, progressive strengthening, and functional or sport-specific training. During this time, patients are advised to avoid running and jumping, but are permitted to perform low impact activities, such as walking or swimming. If patients return to activity before the cartilage has become firm, they will typically complain of pain during maneuvers such as squatting or jumping.|$|E
5|$|Huene {{felt the}} {{vertebrae}} of BMNH R3078 had proportions different enough from Cetiosaurus to warrant its own genus. Also, {{the fusion of}} centra with minimal osseous proliferation is manifest in the caudal vertebrae of Cetiosauriscus. The Cetiosaurus specimen OUMNH J13695 has a low horizontal ridge on each of its lateral surfaces, creating a slightly subhexagonal transverse cross-section, and is also seen on Cetiosauriscus, {{as well as the}} anterior caudals of Haplocanthosaurus, and caudals 15 to 30 of Omeisaurus. Also, the area around the periphery of each <b>articular</b> face is flattened, creating a 'bevelled' appearance, and also occurs in Cetiosaurus and Haplocanthosaurus. A whiplash tail was apparently found in the same deposits but it is not certain it belongs to the same individual. Since there is no overlapping material, this assignment to Cetiosauriscus should be treated with caution.|$|E
5|$|Non-surgical {{treatment}} is rarely an option {{as the ability}} for <b>articular</b> cartilage to heal is limited. As a result, even moderate cases require some form of surgery. When possible, non-operative forms of management such as protected reduced or non-weight bearing and immobilization are used. Surgical treatment includes arthroscopic drilling of intact lesions, securing of cartilage flap lesions with pins or screws, drilling and replacement of cartilage plugs, stem cell transplantation, and joint replacement. After surgery rehabilitation is usually a two-stage process of immobilization and physical therapy. Most rehabilitation programs combine efforts to protect the joint with muscle strengthening and range of motion. During the immobilization period, isometric exercises, such as straight leg raises, are commonly used to restore muscle loss without disturbing the cartilage of the affected joint. Once the immobilization period has ended, physical therapy involves continuous passive motion (CPM) and/or low impact activities, such as walking or swimming.|$|E
5|$|OCD is a {{relatively}} rare disorder, with an estimated incidence of 15 to 30 cases per 100,000 persons per year. Widuchowski W et al. found OCD to {{be the cause of}} <b>articular</b> cartilage defects in 2% of cases in a study of 25,124 knee arthroscopies. Although rare, OCD is noted as an important cause of joint pain in active adolescents. The juvenile form of the disease occurs in children with open growth plates, usually between the ages 5 and 15 years and occurs more commonly in males than females, with a ratio between 2:1 and 3:1. However, OCD has become more common among adolescent females as they become more active in sports. The adult form, which occurs in those who have reached skeletal maturity, is most commonly found in people 16 to 50 years old.|$|E
5|$|Osborn and Mook, in 1921, {{provisionally}} synonymized {{the three}} species, sinking A. latus into Camarasaurus supremus, and suggesting also that A. fragillimus {{is just a}} very large individual of A. altus, a position which most subsequent studies, including McIntosh 1998, Foster (2007), and Woodruff and Foster (2015) have agreed with. Carpenter (2006) disagreed about the synonymy of A. altus and A. fragillimus, however, citing numerous differences {{in the construction of}} the vertebra also noted by Cope, and suggested these differences are enough to warrant a separate species or even a separate genus for A. fragillimus. However, he went on to caution that the validity of A. fragillimus as a separate species is nearly impossible to determine without the original specimen to study. Although Amphicoelias latus is clearly not Amphicoelias, it is probably synonymous with Camarasaurus grandis rather than C. supremus because it was found lower in the Morrison Formation and the deeply concave <b>articular</b> faces on the caudal vertebrae are more consistent with C. grandis.|$|E
5|$|The 19 dorsal {{vertebrae}} {{are similar}} to the pectoral vertebrae, being weakly concave and taller than long, but the neural spines are proportionally taller than the centra. The single-headed dorsal ribs are rounded but slightly flattened in cross-section, and some have a prong-like projection at the top end; their <b>articular</b> surfaces are slightly concave. Underneath, there are at least ten pairs of gastralia, each of which tapers to the sides and has a central groove on the bottom surface. The three sacral vertebrae are similar, but have much smaller, blunter, more oval-shaped ribs. The comparatively smaller first sacral rib is directed further outwards and backwards than the other two ribs. There initially were 25 caudal vertebrae preserved, with 22 still being accounted for. The last several caudal vertebrae are partially fused into a pygostyle-like structure. The preserved caudal ribs are flattened, triangular, and taper towards the tip of the tail.|$|E
5|$|The {{first few}} dorsal {{vertebrae}} {{are similar to}} the cervical vertebrae, but have taller and more prong-like neural spines. The rest are amphiplatyan, meaning that they are flat at both ends. They also have postzygapophyses which are less elongate and more pedestal-like, in addition to taller and more rectangular neural spines. The parapophyses, which are depressions instead of projections, have moved off from the transverse processes to the neural arch, between the transverse processes and the <b>articular</b> processes known as the prezygapophyses {{at the front of the}} vertebrae. However, they move back onto the base of the transverse processes in the last few dorsals. In the third or fourth dorsal, the parapophysis is located very close to the suture between the neural spine and the centrum, which is unlike the other dorsals but similar to the first few dorsals in Edmontosaurus. Also like Edmontosaurus, the median ridge separating the prezygapophyses become more pronounced in the rear dorsals.|$|E
5|$|The ilium of {{the pelvis}} had a convex upper border, a low postacetabular blade (behind the acetabulum), and a narrow brevis-shelf (a {{projection}} where tail muscles attached). The pubic foot was pronounced and shorter {{at the front}} than behind. The ischium was straight and expanded hindwards, ending in a lobe-shape. The femur was sigmoid-shaped, and had a very robust, upwards pointing head, with a deep sulcus (groove). The lesser trochanter of the femoral head was wing-like, and placed below the greater trochanter, which was short. The fourth trochanter was large and projected backwards. The tibia of the lower leg was expanded at the upper end, its <b>articular</b> facet (where it articulated with the femur) was wide, and its shaft was compressed from front to back.|$|E
5|$|The long, strenuous {{walk from}} Pelotas to Porto Alegre and the hardships endured in the presiganga ruined Marques de Sousa's health, {{and he was}} afflicted with <b>articular</b> {{rheumatism}} {{for the rest of}} his life. With Porto Alegre safe, he was granted a leave of absence to recover. In the middle of 1837, he traveled to Europe for medical treatment. After a year away, and still feeling ill, Marques de Sousa secluded himself in Porto Alegre. He was brevetted lieutenant colonel on 20 August 1838. He only returned to active duty in early 1840 after he was made permanent lieutenant colonel on 2 December 1839 and given the command of the 2nd Regiment of Light Cavalry. However, the war against the Ragamuffins was still being waged, and Marques de Sousa met and defeated a rebel force in the Battle of the Várzea do Varejão on 16 September 1841. A new promotion came on 27 March 1842, when he was given the rank of colonel.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians are a {{class of}} animals {{comprising}} frogs, salamanders and caecilians. They are tetrapods, but the caecilians and a few species of salamander have either no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock {{with each other and}} have <b>articular</b> processes. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales, but contains many mucous glands and in some species, poison glands. The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two atria and one ventricle. They have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea. Amphibians breathe by means of buccal pumping, a pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils. These are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat. They supplement this with gas exchange through the skin which needs to be kept moist.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians are ectothermic (cold-blooded) {{vertebrates}} that do {{not maintain}} their body temperature through internal physiological processes. Their metabolic rate is low and as a result, their food and energy requirements are limited. In the adult state, they have tear ducts and movable eyelids, and most species have ears that can detect airborne or ground vibrations. They have muscular tongues, which in many species can be protruded. Modern amphibians have fully ossified vertebrae with <b>articular</b> processes. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales, apart from a few fish-like scales in certain caecilians. The skin contains many mucous glands and in some species, poison glands (a type of granular gland). The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two atria and one ventricle. They have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea. Most amphibians lay their eggs in water and have aquatic larvae that undergo metamorphosis to become terrestrial adults. Amphibians breathe {{by means of a}} pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils. These are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat. They supplement this with gas exchange through the skin.|$|E
5|$|The {{cervical}} vertebrae of {{the neck}} had broad neural spines that increased in height towards the body. The front part of the neural spines had well developed entheses, which was common among adult dinosaurs, and indicates the presence of large ligaments which helped support the massive head. The dorsal vertebrae of the back had centra (or bodies) that were short relative to their width, and their neural spines were short and narrow. The dorsal vertebrae were tightly spaced, which limited the downwards movement of the back. The neural spines had ossified (turned to bone) tendons, which also overlapped some of the vertebrae. The ribs {{of the last four}} back vertebrae were fused to them, and the ribcage was very broad {{in this part of the}} body. The ribs had scars that show where muscles attached to them. The caudal vertebrae of the tail had centra that were slightly amphicoelous, meaning they were concave on both sides. The interlocked zygapophyses (<b>articular</b> processes) of the caudal vertebrae formed a U-shape when seen from above, instead of the more usual V-shape.|$|E
5|$|The third {{axillary}} sclerite (3Ax) lies in {{the posterior}} part of the <b>articular</b> region of the wing. Its form is highly variable and often irregular, but the third axillary is the sclerite on which is inserted the flexor muscle of the wing (D). Mesally it articulates anteriorly (f) with the posterior {{end of the second}} axillary, and posteriorly (b) with the posterior wing process of the tergum (PNP), or with a small fourth axillary when the latter is present. Distally the third axillary is prolonged in a process which is always associated with the bases of the group of veins in the anal region of the wing here termed the vannal veins (V). The third axillary, therefore, is usually the posterior hinge plate of the wing base and is the active sclerite of the flexor mechanism, which directly manipulates the vannal veins. The contraction of the flexor muscle (D) revolves the third axillary on its mesal articulations (b, f) and thereby lifts its distal arm; this movement produces the flexion of the wing. The Fourth Axillary sclerite is not a constant element of the wing base. When present it is usually a small plate intervening between the third axillary and the posterior notal wing process and is probably a detached piece of the latter.|$|E
25|$|The capsule is a dense fibrous {{membrane}} {{that surrounds}} the joint and incorporates the <b>articular</b> eminence. It attaches to the <b>articular</b> eminence, the <b>articular</b> disc and {{the neck of the}} mandibular condyle.|$|E
25|$|The main {{components}} are the joint capsule, <b>articular</b> disc, mandibular condyles, <b>articular</b> {{surface of the}} temporal bone, temporomandibular ligament, stylomandibular ligament, sphenomandibular ligament, and lateral pterygoid muscle.|$|E
25|$|A facet {{refers to}} a small, {{flattened}} <b>articular</b> surface.|$|E
25|$|The lower joint {{compartment}} {{formed by}} the mandible and the <b>articular</b> disc is involved in rotational movement—this is the initial movement of the jaw when the mouth opens. The upper joint compartment {{formed by the}} <b>articular</b> disc and the temporal bone is involved in translational movement—this is the secondary gliding motion of the jaw as it is opened widely. The part of the mandible which mates to the under-surface of the disc is the condyle and {{the part of the}} temporal bone which mates to the upper surface of the disk is the <b>articular</b> fossa or glenoid fossa or mandibular fossa.|$|E
