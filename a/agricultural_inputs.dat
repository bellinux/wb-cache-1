5|$|In 2006, in {{response}} to disastrously low agricultural harvests, Malawi began a programme of fertiliser subsidies, the Fertiliser Input Subsidy Program (FISP) that were designed to re-energise the land and boost crop production. It {{has been reported that}} this program, championed by the country's president, is radically improving Malawi's agriculture, and causing Malawi to become a net exporter of food to nearby countries. The FISP fertiliser subsidy programs ended with President Bingu wa Mutharika's death; the country quickly faced food shortages again, and farmers developed reluctance to purchase fertilisers and other <b>agricultural</b> <b>inputs</b> on the open markets that remained.|$|E

Unfortunately, these farmers face a number of constraints, due to high transport costs, unavailability of <b>agricultural</b> <b>inputs,</b> and underdeveloped agricultural extension services. Instead of investing resources into developing the kind of agricultural extension services that could help smallholder production, however, the government has chosen to focus on large-scale, private sector-led industrial agricultural schemes {{as a way to}} boost food production.|$|E

In 2009, the International Food Policy Research Institute and the International Fertilizer Development Center jointly conducted a census of <b>agricultural</b> <b>input</b> dealers in Ghana to fill a critical data gap {{on the nature of the}} country’s <b>agricultural</b> <b>input</b> sector. This paper presents a detailed description of the sector’s structure, market practices, and supply chain. It also assesses the sector’s response to recently implemented fertilizer subsidies, and findings show that, despite the government’s goal of making the subsidy program supportive of the private market, the majority of fertilizer retailers were excluded from participating. <b>agricultural</b> <b>input</b> sector, fertilizer, agro-dealers network, vouchers, subsidies,...|$|R

25|$|These {{information}} and transportation problems highlight inefficiencies {{in the market}} mechanisms between farmers and end consumers, impeding farmers from {{taking advantage of the}} fast development {{of the rest of the}} Chinese economy. The resulting small profit margin does not allow them to invest in the necessary <b>agricultural</b> <b>inputs</b> (machinery, seeds, fertilizers, etc.) to raise productivity and improve their standards of living, from which the whole of the Chinese economy would benefit. This in turn increases the exodus of people from the countryside to the cities, which already face urbanization issues.|$|E
25|$|Industrial goods used in {{agricultural}} production {{were sold to}} agricultural units in the 1980s. Local cooperatives or state supply and marketing bureaus sold most agricultural producer goods, including chemical fertilizers and insecticides, to households at set prices. The state also offered preferential prices for <b>agricultural</b> <b>inputs</b> to grain farmers to encourage grain production. Households were permitted to purchase agricultural machinery and vehicles to transport goods to market. In {{order to ensure that}} rural units could cover the costs of the increasing quantities of industrial inputs required for higher yields, the government periodically reduced the prices of the industrial goods sold to farmers, while raising the procurement prices for agricultural products. In the mid-1980s, however, the price gap between agricultural and industrial products was widening to the disadvantage of farmers.|$|E
25|$|Local food {{shortages}} {{can be caused}} by a lack of arable land, adverse weather, lower farming skills such as crop rotation, or by a lack of technology or resources needed for the higher yields found in modern agriculture, such as fertilizers, pesticides, irrigation, machinery and storage facilities. As a result of widespread poverty, farmers cannot afford or governments cannot provide the resources necessary to improve local yields. The World Bank and some wealthy donor countries also press nations that depend on aid to cut or eliminate subsidized <b>agricultural</b> <b>inputs</b> such as fertilizer, in the name of free market policies even as the United States and Europe extensively subsidized their own farmers. Many, if not most, farmers cannot afford fertilizer at market prices, leading to low agricultural production and wages and high, unaffordable food prices.|$|E

40|$|Recently, {{land use}} and land cover change have {{received}} increased attention, and an approach is required that can assess agricultural land use intensity on a general basis. This study demonstrated the usefulness of a tool for characterizing and assessing agricultural land use intensity in Beijing mountainous region. An emergy analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) were adopted to obtain <b>agricultural</b> <b>input</b> and output intensity data. Correlation and regression analyses were used to study the relationship among land capability, <b>agricultural</b> <b>input,</b> output intensity, and agricultural system sustainability. Ultimately, the agricultural land use intensity types in the Beijing mountainous region were identified through a cluster analysis. The results produced five indices of <b>agricultural</b> <b>input</b> intensity and five indices of output intensity. Non-renewable energy was the overwhelming input, and grain, meat, eggs, and vegetables were the major outputs of the agricultural system. The results also showed that there was better natural land quality, higher input intensity, greater output intensity, and lower agricultural system sustainability.

40|$|<b>Agricultural</b> <b>input</b> {{distribution}} channels incorporate {{a number of}} complexities that make communication of prices and availability murky, and create inefficiencies in input markets. The Internet provides the potential for realizing significant efficiency gains in the agricul-tural inputs industry through the continued consolidation and vertical integration made possible by improving communications networks. Innovative firms {{have the opportunity to}} profit from the changes wrought and encouraged by the Internet. <b>Agricultural</b> <b>input</b> industries are uniquely affected by international compe-tition and falling prices in agricultural commodity markets. As receipts to agricultural production decline, growers have increased incentives to reduce costs to remain competitive, including the costs of employing inputs. Yet prices paid for inputs by American growers continue to stay steady or rise even as prices received by farmers have plunged (figure 1). If efficiencies can be gained in <b>agricultural</b> <b>input</b> marketing, and all or some are passed on to input buyers, the gap between prices paid and received might lessen, making U. S. agriculture more competitive. E-commerce offers substantial promise in achieving efficiency in <b>agricultural</b> <b>input</b> industrial chains. Background: The Agricultural-Chemical Distribution Channel Figure 2 provides an analysis of the agricultural-chemical distribution channel. The cost of distributing product from input manufacturers to growers is approx-imately $ 3 billion.

The {{aim is to}} assess the sustainability of donor funded <b>agricultural</b> <b>input</b> supply scheme. Since 2008 local NGOs unrolled <b>agricultural</b> <b>input</b> supply schemes, giving vulnerable households free packs of maize seed and fertilizers. Qualitative and quantitative approaches {{were used in the}} study, questionnaires were administered to a sample of sixty respondents, key informants were interviewed and documentary information was collected. The study found high prevalence of diseases, ill health and high rate of school drop outs as poverty indicators in Caledonia. Land is either state or communally owned which hampers development of long term agricultural projects, following the expansion of the city of Harare and Ruwa. The scheme has improved availability of fertilizers, maize seeds and improved crop productivity to disadvantaged households. However, it covered few residents and only supported maize production which has poor market price. Smallholder farmers still lack access to vital livelihoods assets such as large piece of land and draught power. Thus, the donor community should aim at reducing vulnerability and empower rural communities through facilitating access to livelihood assets, not just providing a short-term relief to poverty challenges...|$|R
