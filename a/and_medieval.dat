5|$|Ancient <b>and</b> <b>medieval</b> Christian writers treated {{this as a}} miracle, and {{believed}} it {{to be one of}} the few episodes from the New Testament which were confirmed by non-Christian sources; modern scholars, however, have found no contemporary references to it outside the New Testament.|$|E

5|$|The {{concept of}} the conatus, as used in Baruch Spinoza's psychology, is derived from sources both ancient <b>and</b> <b>medieval.</b> Spinoza reformulates {{principles}} that the Stoics, Cicero, Laertius, and especially Hobbes and Descartes developed. One significant change he makes to Hobbes' theory is his belief that the conatus ad motum, (conatus to motion), is not mental, but material.|$|E
5|$|According to Atlury Murali, Indian Congress in the 1920s {{appealed to}} Andhra Pradesh peasants by {{creating}} Telugu language plays that combined Indian mythology and legends, linked them to Gandhi's ideas, and portrayed Gandhi as a messiah, a reincarnation of ancient <b>and</b> <b>medieval</b> Indian nationalist leaders and saints. The plays built support among peasants steeped in traditional Hindu culture, according to Murali, and this effort made Gandhi a folk hero in Telugu speaking villages, a sacred messiah-like figure.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{historian}} Stevan K. Pavlowitch, {{the bombing of}} Belgrade lasted three days. Other sources state the air battle over Belgrade lasted only two days owing to poor flying conditions on 8 April. The most important cultural institution that was destroyed was the National Library of Serbia, which was hit by bombs and gutted by fire. Hundreds of thousands of volumes, rare books, maps, <b>and</b> <b>medieval</b> manuscripts were destroyed. Also struck was the Belgrade Zoo, sending frightened animals running through the streets.|$|E
5|$|An {{excavation}} of Southcote Manor in the 1960s uncovered many Roman, Romano-British <b>and</b> <b>medieval</b> artefacts such as sherds and pottery; {{a sample of}} the latter was discovered to have originated in Oxford in the 2nd century.

5|$|Famous among Vaishnava {{writers and}} the first brahmin writer (of the Smartha sect) of repute, Rudrabhatta wrote Jagannatha Vijaya (1180) in a style {{considered}} a transition between ancient <b>and</b> <b>medieval</b> Kannada. Chandramouli, a minister {{in the court of}} King Veera BallalaII, was his patron. The writing, in champu metre, is about the life of the god Krishna. Leading to the god's fight with Banasura, it is based on an earlier writing, Vishnupurana.|$|E

5|$|Halley's {{returns to}} the inner Solar System have been {{observed}} and recorded by astronomers since at least 240 BC.

The comet's periodicity was first determined in 1705 by English astronomer Edmond Halley, after whom it is now named.|$|E
5|$|Historical {{parallelism}} and {{the tradition}} of drawing inspiration from the Middle Ages have become keystones of Islamic ideology. Secular Arab Nationalism concentrates {{on the idea of}} Western Imperialism. Gamal Abdel Nasser likened himself to Saladin and imperialism to the Crusades. In his History of the Crusades Sa'id Ashur emphasised the similarity between the modern <b>and</b> <b>medieval</b> situation facing Muslims and the need to study the Crusades in depth. Sayyid Qutb declared there was an international Crusader conspiracy. The ideas of Jihad and a long struggle have developed some currency.|$|E
5|$|In 1722 Sir Thomas Webster {{bought the}} castle. For over a century, Bodiam Castle and its {{associated}} manor descended through the Webster family. It was in this period that the site became popular as an early kind of tourist attraction because of its connection with the medieval period. The first drawings of Bodiam Castle date from the mid-18th century, when it was depicted as a ruin overgrown with ivy. Ruins <b>and</b> <b>medieval</b> buildings such as Bodiam Castle served as an inspiration for the revival in Gothic architecture and the renovation of old structures.|$|E

5|$|In 1950 Merrifield took a post as {{assistant}} {{keeper of the}} Guildhall Museum in London, a job that he would retain until 1975. At the time the museum lacked premises, and Merrifield assisted its keeper, Norman Cook, in establishing an exhibit at the Royal Exchange in 1954. During these post-war years the city's archaeological community was largely preoccupied with salvaging Roman <b>and</b> <b>medieval</b> structures damaged in the Blitz, and by subsequent urban redevelopment.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{restoration}} {{began in}} Mdina, Birgu and the Cittadella. In Mdina, {{some of the}} bastions had started to slip down the clay slopes, and steel rods were inserted in the walls to reinforce them. Throughout the course of restoration, a number of archaeological remains have been found, including remains of Mdina's Punic-Roman <b>and</b> <b>medieval</b> walls, a bastion and a caponier in Birgu, the Cittadella's original entrance, {{and a number of}} other features.|$|E
5|$|In later {{editions of}} the book, Darwin traced {{evolutionary}} ideas {{as far back as}} Aristotle; the text he cites is a summary by Aristotle of the ideas of the earlier Greek philosopher Empedocles. Early Christian Church Fathers <b>and</b> <b>Medieval</b> European scholars interpreted the Genesis creation narrative allegorically rather than as a literal historical account; organisms were described by their mythological and heraldic significance as well as by their physical form. Nature was widely believed to be unstable and capricious, with monstrous births from union between species, and spontaneous generation of life.|$|E
