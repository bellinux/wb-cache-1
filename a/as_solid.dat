2500|$|Fertilizers {{are applied}} to crops both <b>as</b> <b>solids</b> and <b>as</b> liquid. About 90% of {{fertilizers}} are applied <b>as</b> <b>solids.</b> Solid fertilizer is typically granulated or powdered. [...] Often <b>solids</b> are available <b>as</b> prills, a <b>solid</b> globule. [...] Liquid fertilizers comprise anhydrous ammonia, aqueous solutions of ammonia, aqueous solutions of ammonium nitrate or urea. [...] These concentrated products may be diluted with water to form a concentrated liquid fertilizer (e.g., UAN). Advantages of liquid fertilizer are its more rapid effect and easier coverage. [...] The addition of fertilizer to irrigation water is called [...] "fertigation".|$|R

5|$|James Gilbert {{had seen}} film actor Bill Owen playing {{northern}} {{characters in the}} Royal Court Theatre and proposed to cast him as Compo Simmonite. Clarke, who initially saw Owen as an archetypal cockney who could not play <b>as</b> <b>solid</b> a northern character as Compo was meant to be, recognised Owen's potential only after going to London for a read-through with him.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} month, Doll and King reunited {{to win the}} WWC World Tag Team Championship from Doug Masters and Ron Starr. On August 1, {{the title}} was vacated due to a controversial finish in a match against a tag team known <b>as</b> <b>Solid</b> Gold. King replaced Doll with Ray González to win the vacant title. The team got back together again in the USWA, where they defeated The Moondogs to win the tag team belts for a fourth time together.|$|E
5|$|The most {{distinctive}} feature of Saurolophus is its cranial crest, which {{is present in}} young individuals, but is smaller. It is long and spike-like and projects upward and backward at about a 45° angle, starting from over the eyes. This crest is often described <b>as</b> <b>solid,</b> but appears to be solid only at the point, with internal chambers that {{may have had a}} respiratory and/or heat-regulation function.|$|E

5000|$|For {{incompressible}} substances, CP,m and CV,m are identical. Also for {{substances that}} are nearly incompressible, such <b>as</b> <b>solids</b> and liquids, {{the difference between}} the two specific heats is negligible.|$|R
5|$|A surface weather {{analysis}} {{is a type}} of weather map that depicts positions for high and low-pressure areas, as well as various types of synoptic scale systems such as frontal zones. Isotherms can be drawn on these maps, which are lines of equal temperature. Isotherms are drawn normally <b>as</b> <b>solid</b> lines at a preferred temperature interval. They show temperature gradients, which can be useful in finding fronts, which are on the warm side of large temperature gradients. By plotting the freezing line, isotherms can be useful in determination of precipitation type. Mesoscale boundaries such as tropical cyclones, outflow boundaries and squall lines also are analyzed on surface weather analyses.|$|E
5|$|Sure, it's not a Sepultura reunion, {{but having}} Max and Igor {{performing}} on {{record for the}} first time in a dozen years is as close as we'll ever get, and not only does Cavalera Conspiracy's Inflikted revisit the post-thrash sounds of 1993's Chaos A.D., but it manages to outshine anything Sepultura has put out in the last dozen years. Rounded out by Soulfly lead guitarist Marc Rizzo and, most impressively, Gojira frontman Joe Duplantier on bass and rhythm guitar, the band is <b>as</b> <b>solid</b> a metal supergroup as you'll ever come across, and the album's eleven tracks benefit hugely from the chemistry between the four musicians.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 {{fiscal year}} budget was $199.2million, an {{increase}} of $35million from 2009. The city's general fund receives the largest amount of funds from property taxes, followed by service fees such <b>as</b> <b>solid</b> waste collection and swimming pool or golf course admission and 80% of its expenses go to personnel costs. The city has given a few surveys for citizens to rate {{the quality of life}} and city services. The largest department in the city is the public works department with a budget of $36.7million. The police department is second with a budget of $22.4million, while the fire department has a budget of $15million. The parks department has $6.1million, and the Davenport Public Library has a $3.8million budget.|$|E
50|$|UF {{systems can}} either operate with {{cross-flow}} or dead-end flow. In dead-end filtration {{the flow of}} the feed solution is perpendicular to the membrane surface. On the other hand in cross flow systems the flow passes parallel to the membrane surface. Dead-end configurations are more suited to batch processes with low suspended <b>solids</b> <b>as</b> <b>solids</b> accumulate at the membrane surface therefore requiring frequent backflushes and cleaning to maintain high flux. Cross-flow configurations are preferred in continuous operations <b>as</b> <b>solids</b> are continuously flushed from the membrane surface resulting in a thinner cake layer and lower resistance to permeation.|$|R

5|$|These fossils {{have been}} {{preserved}} in a distinctive style known as Burgess shale type preservation, which preserves fairly tough tissues such as cuticle as thin films, and soft tissues <b>as</b> <b>solid</b> shapes, quickly enough that decay has not destroyed them. Moderately soft tissues, such as muscles, are lost. Scientists are still unsure about {{the processes that}} created these fossils. While {{there is little doubt}} that the animals were buried under catastrophic flows of sediment, it is uncertain whether they were transported by the flows from other locations, or lived in the area where they were buried, or were a mixture of local and transported specimens. This issue is closely related to whether conditions around the burial sites were anoxic or had a moderate supply of oxygen. Anoxic conditions are generally thought the most favourable for fossilization, but imply that the animals could not have lived where they were buried.|$|E
