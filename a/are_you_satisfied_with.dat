[...] "One {{would imagine that}} the most important matter is that you were driven out of a calling you liked and were sent here, ruined in repute and fortune. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> your lot?

40|$|Freshman {{international}} students with intermediate Japanese level need prepare for their academic {{life in the}} first semester. In this course we introduced the learning-support system (Jenzabar), and implemented 3 complementary points as follows: I inter-face reading lessons (classroom), II individual readings in class (computer room), III individual readings outside class (home). As a result, both reading classes received above average class evaluations, especially on the following points: 'How much time did you spend preparing for this class?', 'Did the instructor listen to students' comments and questions?', 'Was this class easy to understand?', and 'Overall <b>were</b> <b>you</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> this class?'. 'Blended learning' combines interface learning {{in the classroom and}} E-learning from home. In this research, we used computer rooms for linking the classroom and home. We consider this system of 'transitional blended learning' especially effective for teaching {{international students}}...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{have been}} wondering, I suppose, {{like all the}} rest of the world," [...] he began, [...] "why I sent for you here. I am going to tell you. But first of all let me know this. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> what I have done for you, and for your people?

6000|$|... "Clear your head, child, of the {{nonsense}} {{that has}} got into it--I can't think how. Rich Mr. Dunboyne has taught his heir to despise the base act of marrying for money. He knows that Philip will meet young ladies at my house; {{and he has}} written {{to me on the}} subject of his son's choice of a wife. 'Let Philip find good principles, good temper, and good looks; and I promise beforehand to find the money.'

Well, here also is a letter from the divine--or rather the half divine--Domitian to yourself, Demetrius of Alexandria, also witnessed by myself and sealed. It promises to you that if you give evidence enabling him to arrest that miscreant who dared to bid against him--no, do not be alarmed, the lady was not knocked down to you--you shall be allowed to take possession of her or to buy her at a reasonable valuation, not to exceed fifteen sestertia.

6000|$|... "Depend upon it, Robert," [...] said my wife,--she always {{calls him}} Robert on Sunday evenings,--"depend upon it, {{we are not}} so very much wiser than our fathers were, that we need depart from their good old ways. Of course I would have {{religion}} in the heart, and spreading quietly through the life; but does this interfere with those outward, daily acts of respect and duty which we owe to our Creator? It is too much the slang of our day to decry forms, and to exalt the excellency {{of the spirit in}} opposition to them; but tell me, <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> friendship that has none of the outward forms of friendship, or love that has none of the outward forms of love? Are you satisfied of the existence of a sentiment that has no outward mode of expression? Even the old heathen had their pieties; they would not begin a feast without a libation to their divinities, and there was a shrine in every well-regulated house for household gods." ...|$|E

Now then. Here is a lovely little chick, fluffy with yellow down. He is active enough, but I shall quiet him. One tap, and {{now what do you}} see? A poor, feeble chicken, {{scarcely}} able to stand, with his down all packed close to him {{as if he had been}} out in the rain. Ah, little chick, I will take the two halves of the egg-shell from which you came, and put them on each side of you. Come, now get in! I close them up. You are lost to view. There is nothing to be seen but a crack around the shell! Now it has gone! There, my friends; as I hold it on high, behold the magic egg, exactly as it was when I first took it out of the box, into which I will place it again, with the cloth and the wand and the little red bag, and shut it up with a snap. I will let you take one more look at this box before I put it away behind the scenes. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> what I have shown you?

60|$|As a Christian preacher your {{business}} is with man as an immortal being. Let us imagine {{you to be}} addressing those, and those only, who would gladly co-operate with you in any course of education which {{is most likely to}} ensure to men a happy immortality. <b>Are</b> <b>you</b> <b>satisfied</b> <b>with</b> that course which the most active of this class are bent upon? Clearly not, as I remember from your conversation, which is confirmed by your last letter. Great principles, you hold, are sacrificed to shifts and expedients. I agree with you. What more sacred law of nature, for instance, than that the mother should educate her child? yet we felicitate ourselves upon the establishment of infant-schools, which is in direct opposition to it. Nay, we interfere with the maternal instinct before the child is born, by furnishing, in cases where there is no necessity, the mother with baby-linen for her unborn child. Now, that in too many instances a lamentable necessity may exist for this, I allow; but why should such charity be obtruded? Why should so many excellent ladies form themselves into committees, and rush into an almost indiscriminate benevolence, which precludes the poor mother from the strongest motive human nature can be actuated by for industry, for forethought, and self-denial? When the stream has thus been poisoned at its fountain-head, we proceed, by separating, through infant-schools, the mother from the child, and {{from the rest of the}} family, disburthening them of all care of the little-one for perhaps eight hours of the day. To those who think this an evil, but a necessary one, much might be said, in order to qualify unreasonable expectations. But there are thousands of stirring people now in England, who are so far misled as to deem these schools good in themselves, and to wish that, even in the smallest villages, the children of the poor should have what they call 'a good education' in this way. Now, these people (and no error is at present more common) confound education with tuition.|$|E

Your excellency's liberality, {{answered}} I, seems out of all proportion with its object; so that I receive it with fear and trembling. Why so? replied he. Can I be too lavish of distinction to a man whom the king has committed to my care, and for whose interests he especially commanded me to provide? No, that is impossible; and I {{do no more than}} my duty in placing you on a footing of respectability and consequence. No longer, therefore, let what I do for you he a subject of surprise; but rely on it that splendour {{in the eye of the}} world, and the solid advantages of accumulating wealth, are equally with in your grasp, if you do but attach yourself as faithfully to me as you did to the Duke of Lerma.|$|E
30|$|The {{questionnaire}} was structured with categorized questions (yes or no) and variables of interest, including questions about self-perception, appearance satisfaction, and orthodontic treatment need.
