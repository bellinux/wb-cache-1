5|$|Jan Pinkava came up {{with the}} concept in 2000, {{creating}} the original design, sets and characters and core storyline, but he was never formally named the director of the film. Lacking confidence in Pinkava's story development, Pixar management replaced him with Bird in 2005. Bird was attracted to the film because of the outlandishness of the concept and the conflict that drove it: that rats feared kitchens, yet <b>a</b> <b>rat</b> wanted to work in one. Bird was also delighted that the film could be made a highly physical comedy, with the character of Linguini providing endless fun for the animators. Bird rewrote the story, with a change in emphasis. He killed off Gusteau, gave larger roles to Skinner and Colette, and also changed the appearance of the rats to be less anthropomorphic.|$|E

5|$|Rain World is a 2017 {{survival}} platformer {{video game}} in which the player controls a part-slug, part-cat creature searching a hostile, derelict world for its family. The Slugcat uses debris as weapons to escape randomized enemies, forage for food, and reach safe hibernation rooms before a deadly torrential rain arrives. The player is given little explicit guidance on how to survive, which was {{the intention of the}} developers, who wanted players to feel like <b>a</b> <b>rat</b> living on subway tracks, in which they learn to survive in an environment without grasping its higher-level function. Rain World was developed by Videocult, a small indie team, over six years and published by Adult Swim Games for PlayStation 4 and Windows in March 2017. It received mixed reviews from critics, who praised its art design and fluid animations, but disliked its brutal difficulty and imprecise controls.|$|E

40|$|Mutation in the ubiquitously {{expressed}} cytoplasmic {{superoxide dismutase}} (SOD 1) causes an inherited form of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). Mutant synthesis in motor neurons drives disease onset and early disease progression. Previous experimental {{studies have shown}} that spinal grafting of human fetal spinal neural stem cells (hNSCs) into the lumbar spinal cord of SOD 1 (G 93 <b>A)</b> <b>rats</b> leads to <b>a</b> moderate therapeutical effect as evidenced by local α-motoneuron sparing and extension of lifespan. The aim {{of the present study was}} to analyze the degree of therapeutical effect of hNSCs once grafted into the lumbar spinal ventral horn in presymptomatic immunosuppressed SOD 1 (G 93 <b>A)</b> <b>rats</b> and to assess the presence and functional integrity of the descending motor system in symptomatic SOD 1 (G 93 A) animals. Presymptomatic SOD 1 (G 93 <b>A)</b> <b>rats</b> (60 - 65 days old) received spinal lumbar injections of hNSCs. After cell grafting, disease onset, disease progression and lifespan were analyzed. In separate symptomatic SOD 1 (G 93 <b>A)</b> <b>rats,</b> the presence and functional conductivity of descending motor tracts (corticospinal and rubrospinal) was analyzed by spinal surface recording electrodes after electrical stimulation of the motor cortex. Silver impregnation of lumbar spinal cord sections and descending motor axon counting in plastic spinal cord sections were used to validate morphologically the integrity of descending motor tracts. Grafting of hNSCs into the lumbar spinal cord of SOD 1 (G 93 <b>A)</b> <b>rats</b> protected α-motoneurons in the vicinity of grafted cells, provided transient functional improvement, but offered no protection to α-motoneuron pools distant from grafted lumbar segments. Analysis of motor-evoked potentials recorded from the thoracic spinal cord of symptomatic SOD 1 (G 93 <b>A)</b> <b>rats</b> showed <b>a</b> near complete loss of descending motor tract conduction, corresponding to a significant (50 - 65 %) loss of large caliber descending motor axons. These data demonstrate that in order to achieve a more clinically-adequate treatment, cell-replacement/gene therapy strategies will likely require both spinal and supraspinal targets...|$|R

5|$|Similarly, Susumu Tonegawa {{demonstrated}} in 1996 that the CA1 {{area of the}} hippocampus {{is crucial to the}} formation of spatial memories in living mice. So-called place cells located in this region become active only when the rat is in a particular location — called a place field — in the environment. Since these place fields are distributed throughout the environment, one interpretation is that groups of place cells form maps in the hippocampus. The accuracy of these maps determines how well <b>a</b> <b>rat</b> learns about its environment and thus how well it can navigate it. Tonegawa found that by impairing the NMDA receptor, specifically by genetically removing the NR1 subunit in the CA1 region, the place fields generated were substantially less specific than those of controls. That is, mice produced faulty spatial maps when their NMDA receptors were impaired. As expected, these mice performed very poorly on spatial tasks compared to controls, further supporting the role of LTP in spatial learning.|$|E

40|$|Charcot-Marie-Tooth 1 A (CMT 1 A) is a demyelinating {{hereditary}} neuropathy {{for which}} pharmacological treatments {{are not yet}} available. An abnormally high intracellular Ca 2 + concentration was observed in Schwann cells (SC) from CMT 1 <b>A</b> <b>rats,</b> caused by the PMP 22 -mediated overexpression of the P 2 X 7 purinoceptor. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the tolerability and therapeutic potential of a pharmacological antagonist of the P 2 X 7 receptor (A 438079) in CMT 1 A. A 438079 ameliorated in vitro myelination of organotypic DRG cultures from CMT 1 <b>A</b> <b>rats.</b> Furthermore, we performed an experimental therapeutic trial in PMP 22 transgenic and in wild-type <b>rats.</b> <b>A</b> preliminary dose-escalation trial showed that 3  mg/kg A 438079 administered via intraperitoneal injection every 24  h for four weeks was well tolerated by wild type and CMT 1 <b>A</b> <b>rats.</b> Affected rats treated with 3  mg/kg A 438079 revealed a significant improvement of the muscle strength, when compared to placebo controls. Importantly, histologic analysis revealed a significant increase of the total number of myelinated axons in tibial nerves. Moreover, a significant decrease of the hypermyelination of small caliber axons and a significant increase of the frequency and diameter of large caliber myelinated axons was highlighted. An improved distal motor latencies was recorded, whereas compound muscle action potentials (CMAP) remained unaltered. A 438079 reduced the SC differentiation defect in CMT 1 <b>A</b> <b>rats.</b> These results show that pharmacological inhibition of the P 2 X 7 receptor is well tolerated in CMT 1 <b>A</b> <b>rats</b> and represents <b>a</b> proof-of-principle that antagonizing this pathway may correct the molecular derangements and improve the clinical phenotype in the CMT 1 A neuropathy...|$|R
