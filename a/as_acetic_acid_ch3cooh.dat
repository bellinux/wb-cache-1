25|$|In contrast, a {{weak acid}} only {{partially}} dissociates. Examples in water include carbonic <b>acid</b> (H2CO3) and <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> (<b>CH3COOH).</b> At equilibrium, both the acid and the conjugate base {{are present in}} solution.|$|R
50|$|Copper(II) acetate is soluble {{in alcohol}} {{and water and}} {{slightly}} soluble in ether and glycerol. It melts at 115 C and decomposes at 240 C. It can be prepared by reacting copper(II) oxide, CuO, or copper(II) carbonate, CuCO3, with <b>acetic</b> <b>acid,</b> <b>CH3COOH.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Acetic</b> <b>acid,</b> <b>CH3COOH,</b> is an <b>acid</b> {{because it}} donates a proton to water (H2O) and becomes its {{conjugate}} base, the acetate ion (CH3COO−). H2O is a base because it accepts a proton from CH3COOH and becomes its conjugate acid, the hydronium ion, (H3O+).|$|R
5000|$|Weak salts or [...] "weak {{electrolyte}} salts" [...] are, as {{the name}} suggests, composed of weak electrolytes. They are generally more volatile than strong salts. They may be similar in odor to the acid or base they are derived from. For example, sodium acetate, NaCH3COO, smells similar to <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>CH3COOH.</b>|$|R
50|$|Common {{examples}} of monoprotic acids in mineral acids include hydrochloric acid (HCl) and nitric acid (HNO3). On the other hand, for organic acids the term mainly indicates {{the presence of}} one carboxylic acid group and sometimes these acids are known as monocarboxylic acid. Examples in organic acids include formic <b>acid</b> (HCOOH), <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> (<b>CH3COOH)</b> and benzoic <b>acid</b> (C6H5COOH).|$|R
50|$|Vinegar is {{a liquid}} {{consisting}} of about 5-20% <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> (<b>CH3COOH),</b> water, and other trace chemicals, which may include flavorings. The <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> {{is produced by}} the fermentation of ethanol by <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> bacteria. Vinegar is now mainly used as a cooking ingredient, or in pickling. As the most easily manufactured mild acid, it has historically had {{a great variety of}} industrial, medical, and domestic uses, some of which (such as its use as a general household cleaner) are still commonly practiced today.|$|R
25|$|Most acids {{are weak}} acids. A weak acid is an acid that dissociates incompletely, {{releasing}} {{only some of}} its hydrogen atoms into the solution. Thus, it is less capable than a strong acid at donating protons. These acids have higher pKa than strong acids, which release all of their hydrogen atoms when dissolved in water. Examples of weak <b>acids</b> include <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> (<b>CH3COOH),</b> phosphoric <b>acid</b> (H3PO4), hydrofluoric acid (HF) and oxalic acid (H2C2O4).|$|R
25|$|Two of {{the first}} {{synthetic}} pigments were white lead (basic lead carbonate, (PbCO3)2Pb(OH)2) and blue frit (Egyptian Blue). White lead is made by combining lead with vinegar (<b>acetic</b> <b>acid,</b> <b>CH3COOH)</b> {{in the presence of}} CO2. Blue frit is calcium copper silicate and was made from glass colored with a copper ore, such as malachite. These pigments were used as early as the second millennium BCE Later premodern additions to the range of synthetic pigments included vermillion, verdigris and lead-tin-yellow.|$|R
5000|$|While the Arrhenius {{concept is}} useful for {{describing}} many reactions, it is also quite limited in its scope. In 1923 chemists Johannes Nicolaus Brønsted and Thomas Martin Lowry independently recognized that acid-base reactions involve the transfer of a proton. A Brønsted-Lowry acid (or simply Brønsted acid) is a species that donates a proton to a Brønsted-Lowry base. Brønsted-Lowry acid-base theory has several advantages over Arrhenius theory. Consider the following reactions of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> (<b>CH3COOH),</b> the organic <b>acid</b> that gives vinegar its characteristic taste: ...|$|R
5000|$|A weak {{electrolyte}} is a substance whose solute exists in solution {{mostly in the}} form of molecules (which are said to be [...] "undissociated"), with only a small fraction {{in the form of}} ions. Simply because a substance does not readily dissolve does not make it a {{weak electrolyte}}. <b>Acetic</b> <b>acid</b> (<b>CH3COOH)</b> and ammonium (NH4+) are good examples. <b>Acetic</b> <b>acid</b> is extremely soluble in water, but most of the compound dissolves into molecules, rendering it a weak electrolyte. Weak bases and weak acids are generally weak electrolytes. In an aqueous solution there will be some CH3COOH and some CH3COO− and H+.|$|R

50|$|In organic compounds, {{the weight}} percent of {{hydrocarbon}} chain often determines the compound's miscibility with water. For example, among the alcohols, ethanol has two carbon atoms and is miscible with water, whereas 1-octanol with eight carbons is not. Octanol's immiscibility leads {{it to be}} used as a standard for partition equilibria. This is also the case with lipids; the very long carbon chains of lipids cause them almost always to be immiscible with water. Analogous situations occur for other functional groups. <b>Acetic</b> <b>acid</b> (<b>CH3COOH)</b> is miscible with water, whereas valeric acid (C4H9COOH) is not. Simple aldehydes and ketones tend to be miscible with water, because a hydrogen bond can form between the hydrogen atom of a water molecule and the unbonded (lone) pair of electrons on the carbonyl oxygen atom.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Hydrolysis of {{the aquatic}} {{vegetables}} waste {{would lead to}} the generation of some toxic components and by-products, such as weak acids, aldehydes and phenols. The toxic effect of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> on ethanol fermentation by ethanologenic Escherichia coli SZ 470 was investigated. The growth curve of Escherichia coli SZ 470, specific growth rate (µ), the ethanol yield and consumption of glucose were compared among different concentrations of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> addition in the fermentation medium. Specific growth rate increased <b>as</b> <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> concentration lower than 0. 6 g/L, but decreased <b>as</b> <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> concentrations exceeded 0. 6 g/L. When concentration of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> exceeded 0. 8 g/L, the exponential growth phase of Escherichia coli SZ 470 expanded from 10 h to above 12 h, moreover, the ethanol yield and consumption of glucose drastically decreased. This result indicates that minor amounts of <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> might be helpful with the growth of Escherichia coli SZ 470...|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} of black tar heroin results in {{significant amounts of}} 6-MAM in the final product. 6-MAM is approximately 30 percent more active than diacetylmorphine itself, This is why despite lower heroin content, black tar heroin may be more potent than some other forms of heroin. 6-MAM can be synthesized from morphine using glacial <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> with an organic base as a catalyst. The <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> must be of a high purity (97-99 per cent) for the acid to properly acetylate the morphine at the 6th position effectively creating 6-MAM. <b>Acetic</b> <b>acid</b> is used rather than <b>acetic</b> anhydride, <b>as</b> <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> is {{not strong enough to}} acetylate the phenolic 3-hydroxy group but is able to acetylate the 6-hydroxy group, thus selectively producing 6-MAM rather than heroin. <b>Acetic</b> <b>acid</b> is a convenient way to produce 6-MAM, <b>as</b> <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> also is not a watched chemical as it is the main component of vinegar.|$|R
50|$|Though {{the smell}} of kusaya is strong, its taste is quite mellow. Kusaya is often eaten with Japanese sake or shōchū, {{particularly}} a local drink called Shima Jiman (literally island pride). The brine used to make kusaya, which includes many vitamins and organic <b>acids</b> such <b>as</b> <b>acetic</b> <b>acid,</b> propionic acid and amino acids, contributes much nutritional value to the resulting dried fish.|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} salt of the {{bicarbonate}} ion is sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3, which is {{commonly known as}} baking soda. When heated or exposed to an <b>acid</b> such <b>as</b> <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> (vinegar), sodium bicarbonate releases carbon dioxide. This is used as a leavening agent in baking.|$|R
5|$|Lead metal resists sulfuric and {{phosphoric acid}} but not {{hydrochloric}} or nitric acid; the outcome depends on insolubility and subsequent passivation {{of the product}} salt. Organic <b>acids,</b> such <b>as</b> <b>acetic</b> <b>acid,</b> dissolve lead {{in the presence of}} oxygen. Concentrated alkalis will dissolve lead and form plumbites.|$|R
50|$|The lack of acetic {{anhydride}} has caused clandestine chemists {{in some countries}} to substitute it for lower quality precursors such <b>as</b> <b>acetic</b> <b>acid</b> and results {{in the formation of}} impure black tar heroin that contains a mixture of drugs not found in heroin made with pure chemicals.|$|R
