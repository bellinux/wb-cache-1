40|$|Abstract. The {{corrosion}} inhibitor modified with acid <b>activated</b> <b>attapulgite</b> (CIATP) was prepared with acid <b>activated</b> <b>attapulgite</b> (HATP), styrene sulfonic sodium (SSS), maleic anhydride (MA) as monomers, water as solvent and ammonium persulfate as initiator. The effects of mass ratio of monomer, reaction temperature, {{the content of}} initiator and reaction time of preparing CIATP were investigated. The influences of the prepared CIATP concentration, time, pH and temperature of the system on the dispersing ferric oxide efficiency were also investigated. The obtained {{results showed that the}} prepared CIATP had excellent efficiency of dispersing ferric oxide, and nearly 98. 98 % of dispersing ferric oxide efficiency was obtained. The experimental results indicate the {{corrosion inhibitor}} CIATP could be used in the corrosion inhibitor of high temperature water...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Sorbent of CuO {{loaded on}} the support of powder <b>activated</b> carbon and <b>attapulgite</b> for flue gas {{desulfurization}} was prepared by impregnation method and characterized by BET, SEM and XRD. The results of BET and SEM showed that the sorbent had a high structural porosity, while sorbent with 20 % CuO loading had the best desulfurization performance although CuO was dispersed at the surface of carrier in a way of multilayer according to XRD patterns...|$|R
40|$|Attapulgite {{calcined}} at 973. 15 K {{was characterized}} and utilized as an adsorbent {{for the removal}} of heavy metals and neutralization of acid mine drainage (AMD) from a gold mine. Batch adsorption experiments were carried out using a thermostatic shaker. <b>Activated</b> <b>attapulgite</b> showed that it can neutralize AMD as it raised the pH from 2. 6 to 7. 3 after a residence time of 2 h. Metal ion removal after 2 h was 100 % for Cu (II), 99. 46 % for Fe (II), 96. 20 % for Co (II), 86. 92 % for Ni (II) and 71. 52 % for Mn (II) using a 2. 5 % w/v <b>activated</b> <b>attapulgite</b> loading. The adsorption best fit the Langmuir isotherm; however, Cu (II), Co (II), and Fe (II) data fit the Freundlich isotherm as well. Calcination at 973. 15 K resulted in the reduction of the equilibrium residence time from 4 to 2 h, solid loading reduction from 10 to 2. 5 % m/v and an increase in maximum adsorption capacity compared with unactivated attapulgite...|$|E
40|$|Esta pesquisa apresenta um estudo {{experimental}} com o intuito de avaliar a eficiência da recuperação de argilas adsorventes atapulgitas in natura de origem brasileira e a ativada de origem americana, utilizadas na purificação de óleo de soja bruto. O estudo visa o uso sustentável da matéria-prima, ou seja, das argilas adsorventes, reduzindo a geração do passivo ambiental. Apresenta uma abordagem teórica aplicada na fase experimental. Foi verificado decaimento da eficiência de clarificação da primeira para a última purificação, evidenciando a perda de capacidade de adsorção das argilas caracterizada pela diminuição dos compostos minoritários presentes no óleo bruto, após a 1 ª purificação, subindo gradativamente alcançando concentrações significativas após a 3 ª purificação. As purificações dos óleos apresentaram resultados similares para as duas argilas, no entanto, as Atapulgitas Ativadas apresentaram melhor performance. This research {{presents an}} experimental study {{in order to}} evaluate the efficiency of recovery of in natura attapulgite adsorbent clays from Brazil and the activated form from United States of America, used in the purification of the crude soybean oil. The study aims the sustainable use of the raw material, in other words, the adsorbent clays, reducing the generation of environmental liabilities. It also presents a technical approach applied in the experimental phase. It was verified a decay in the clarification efficiency from the first to the last purification, what shows loss of the adsorption capability of the clays, which {{is characterized by the}} diminution of the minority compounds of the crude oil after the first purification, rising gradually and reaching significant concentrations after the third purification. The purification of the oils showed similar results for both clays, however, the <b>activated</b> <b>attapulgite</b> showed a best performance...|$|E
