25|$|On 22 June 2015, {{few days}} after the {{legislative}} vote on the 2015 Hong Kong electoral reform over the electoral method of the 2017 Chief Executive election, moderate democrat Ronny Tong Ka-wah, who had campaigned for his mid-way reform proposal, announced that he would quit the Civic party that he co-founded and would also resign from the Legislative Council <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was inappropriate for him to retain his seat in the legislature because he stood for election as a Civic Party member which was effective on 1 October 2015.|$|E
25|$|In the Abhijñānaśākuntalam, {{written by}} Kalidasa, when the maiden Shakuntala ignored Durvasa's demands to be welcomed {{as a guest}} because she was daydreaming about her lover, Dushyanta, he cursed her that her lover would forget her. Horrified, Shakuntala's companions managed to mollify Durvasa, who {{softened}} the curse, saying that Dushyanta would remember Shakuntala {{when he saw the}} ring that he gave her as a token of their love. The sage's curse came true of course and was eventually lifted, just <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> would be. By the end of the play, the two lovers are reconciled and are happy to be together again, along with their son, Bharata.|$|E
25|$|To get an {{audience}} with the casino's CEO Jay Sarno, Knievel created a fictitious corporation called Evel Knievel Enterprises and three fictitious lawyers to make phone calls to Sarno. Knievel also placed phone calls to Sarno claiming to be from American Broadcasting Company and Sports Illustrated inquiring about the jump. Sarno finally agreed to meet Knievel and arranged for Knievel to jump the fountains on December 31, 1967. After the deal was set, Knievel tried to get ABC to air the event live on Wide World of Sports. ABC declined, but said that if Knievel had the jump filmed {{and it was as}} spectacular <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> would be, they would consider using it later.|$|E
6000|$|He {{started looking}} there and then, {{and for the}} next two or three days George Barstow and Joe Clark see ’im walking up and down with his ’ands in ’is pockets looking over garden fences and calling [...] "Puss." [...] He asked {{everybody}} ’e see whether they ’ad seen a white cat with one blue eye and one yaller one, and every time ’e came into the Cauliflower he put his ’ead over the bar and called [...] "Puss," [...] ’cos, <b>as</b> <b>’e</b> <b>said,</b> <b>it</b> was <b>as</b> likely to be there as anywhere else.|$|R
6000|$|... “We haven’t heard Dolores recite,” said Rollo desperately; <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had <b>said</b> <b>it</b> <b>he</b> {{realised}} his mistake. Confronted {{with the}} alternative of “Locksley Hall,” public opinion declared unanimously {{for the history}} game.|$|R

25|$|Seilern {{returned}} to London {{at the end}} of the war to live in a great gloomy house he had acquired at 56 Princes Gate, South Kensington, where he rarely opened the blinds and electric light was largely eschewed <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> distorted colours in pictures. At Princes Gate the ground floor was devoted to his enormous art library, and therefore pictures were hung mainly on the first floor, well-spaced, as in a museum. Other rooms in the house, of course, also held pictures: for example, on the second floor there was a charmingly decorated room called the card-room, which was apparently rarely shown to visitors but in which, eventually, he hung his Tiepolos, and behind this was a private study, hung with a group of Impressionist pictures including a fine late Cézanne.|$|E
500|$|Canadian Online Explorer writer Jason Clevett {{rated the}} entire event 7 out of 10 stars, {{which was the}} same rating as the 2006 event. The Iron Man match for the TNA X Division Championship was rated 9 out of 10 stars. The main event match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship was rated a 7 out of 10 stars, the lesser of the two. When Clevett spoke of the Iron Man match, he said it [...] "met expectations". His {{comments}} on the main event were a bit different <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was [...] "entertaining" [...] and a [...] "decent match" [...] overall. The event was released on DVD on November 15, 2005 by TNA Home Video.|$|E
500|$|Looking back in 2004, Holloway's biographer Eric Midwinter wrote, [...] "With his cockney authenticity, his splendid {{baritone}} voice, and {{his wealth}} of comedy experience, {{he made a}} great success of this role, and, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> <b>it</b> put him 'bang {{on top of the}} heap, in demand' again at a time when, in his mid-sixties, his career was beginning to wane". His performances earned him a Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Musical and an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor in a Supporting Role. Following his success on Broadway, Holloway played Pooh-Bah in a 1960 US television Bell Telephone Hour production of The Mikado, produced by the veteran Gilbert and Sullivan performer Martyn Green. Holloway appeared with Groucho Marx and Helen Traubel of the Metropolitan Opera. [...] His notable films around this time included Alive and Kicking in 1959, co-starring Sybil Thorndike and Kathleen Harrison, and No Love for Johnnie in 1961 opposite Peter Finch. In 1962, Holloway took part in a studio recording of Oliver! with Alma Cogan and Violet Carson, in which he played Fagin.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{tried to}} get up <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> but <b>it</b> wasn't so easy for me on account of my not bein' such a high stepper as Jone, an' I was a good while a-gettin' a good footin' on the board.|$|R

2500|$|On 22 March, Rory O'Connor held {{what was}} to become an infamous press conference and {{declared}} that the IRA would no longer obey the Dáil <b>as</b> (<b>he</b> <b>said)</b> <b>it</b> had violated its Oath to uphold the Irish Republic. He {{went on to say that}} [...] "we repudiate the Dáil ... We will set up an Executive which will issue orders to the IRA all over the country." [...] In reply to the question on whether this meant they intended to create a military dictatorship, O'Connor said: [...] "You can take it that way if you like." ...|$|E
2500|$|Russian Chief Director for Human Rights Vladimir Lukin {{stated that}} the attempt to ban Bhagavad Gita As It Is {{amounted}} to “infringement on the constitutional right to the freedom of consciousness" [...] {{and that it was}} [...] "unacceptable" [...] to ban the Bhagavad Gita As It Is written by ISKCON founder Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, in Russia, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was a [...] "globally respected book". As the Ombudsman for Russia, Vladimir Lukun took the Bhagavad Gita court case under his special control and will testify in the court on December 28 asking to dismiss the charges.|$|E
60|$|The colour flushed {{into his}} cheeks <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> 'True! <b>It</b> {{may have a}} {{considerable}} effect in my favour.

2500|$|Journalist Steve Coll, who {{has written}} on foreign policy, {{national}} security and the bin Laden family, criticized the filmmakers for saying the film was [...] "journalistic", which implies that it is based in fact. At the same time, they claimed artistic license, which he described [...] "as an excuse for shoddy reporting about a subject as important as whether torture had a vital part {{in the search for}} bin Laden". Coll wrote that [...] "arguably, the film's degree of emphasis on torture's significance goes beyond what even the most die-hard defenders of the CIA interrogation regime [...] have argued", <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was shown as critical at several points.|$|E
2500|$|... "Run" [...] {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from music critics. Claire Simpson highlighted the track, Adrienne Day called the song [...] "brilliant", and Jacky McCarthy, from Billboard, {{described it as}} [...] "memorable", due to the band displays [...] "a lush melody, soaring chorus and [...] brooding vocals." [...] Andrew Beaujon added it to Spin playlist of [...] "songs you need to know", and wrote it is [...] "the year's most fantastically overblown Britpop power ballad." [...] Mikael Wood from the same magazine compared [...] "Run" [...] to British band Coldplay song [...] "Yellow", <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> is a [...] "pro-smoking epic [...] challenges the cell-phone-waving majesty of 'Yellow'", a feeling Douglas Wolk of Rolling Stone had as well. Josh Modell of The A.V. Club commented it grabs the baton from [...] "Yellow" [...] and [...] "takes it for a weepy, grandiose jog". John Murphy considered its [...] "slow burning delights" [...] replaced the piano chords of Coldplay's [...] "Clocks", which, according to him, started to sound [...] "annoying".|$|E
2500|$|This {{agreement}} was {{ratified by the}} Roman Senate and Viriatus was declared [...] "amicus populi Romani", (...) , an ally of the Roman people. However, the peace brought by the treaty [...] displeased Quintus Servilius Caepio, who got himself appointed [...] successor of his brother, Q. Fabius Maximus Servilianus, in the command {{of the army and}} administration of affairs in Iberia. In his reports to the Roman Senate he sustained that the treaty was in the highest degree dishonorable to Rome. Livy seemed to have a different opinion <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> was a stain in Servilianus' military career but comments that the treaty was, aequis, fair. [...] The senate authorized Q. Servilius Caepio, on his request, to distress Viriatus {{as long as it was}} done secretly. The treaty was in effect for one year. During that time Q. Servilius Caepio harassed Viriatus and kept making pressure with his reports until he was authorized to publicly declare war.|$|E
6000|$|... 'A {{boy that}} would be a boy all his life, like Sir Thomas More's son!' said Louis, coolly and simply, but with a twinkle {{in the corner of his}} eye, <b>as</b> if <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> on purpose to be provoking; and Mrs. Frost {{interposed}} by asking where the cousins had met, and whether they had known each other.|$|R

2500|$|Lee also {{received}} various other titles: in 1776, {{he was named}} commander of the so-called Canadian Department, although he never got to serve in this capacity. He was appointed as the first commander of the Southern Department. He served in this post for six months, until he was recalled to the main army. During {{his time in the}} South, the British sent an expedition under Henry Clinton to recover Charleston, South Carolina. Lee oversaw the fortification of the city. Fort Sullivan was a fortification built out of palmetto logs, later named for commander Col. William Moultrie. Lee ordered the army to evacuate the fort because <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it</b> would only last thirty minutes and all soldiers would be killed. Governor John Rutledge forbade Moultrie to evacuate and the fort held. The spongy palmetto logs repelled the cannonball from the British ships. The assault on Sullivan's Island was driven off, and Clinton abandoned his attempts to capture the city. Although the credit of the defense was not Lee's, he was called [...] "hero of Charleston".|$|E

My flesh and blood'--he looked at Mrs. Creakle <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> this--'when <b>it</b> rises against me, {{is not my}} flesh and blood. I discard it. Has that fellow'--to {{the man with the}} wooden leg--'been here again?' ...|$|R
6000|$|Hearing this, I {{told them}} both unreservedly what I {{had said to}} Eustace, and how he had {{received}} it. To my unspeakable disappointment, they both sided with my husband, treating my view of his position as a mere dream. They <b>said</b> <b>it,</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had <b>said</b> <b>it,</b> [...] "You have not read the Trial." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That settles it. I {{have got}} all I want of that {{particular}} sex for the time being." [...] Mavering wore a very bitter air <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> this; <b>it</b> {{seemed to him that}} he would always be cynical; he rose, and arranged to leave his bag with the restaurateur, who put it under the counter, and then he went out with his friend.|$|R
60|$|But <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it,</b> {{he pressed}} her {{closer to his}} side, and his tone was {{pleasant}} to her.|$|E
60|$|<b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it,</b> {{he glanced}} from the cod-fish to the oyster-barrels, and chuckled joyously. He was fatter than ever.|$|E
60|$|He half {{filled the}} tumbler <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> <b>it,</b> and drank off the {{contents}} {{when he had}} done saying it.|$|E
60|$|So he {{put one of}} {{the needles}} upon the float, and then brought {{the eye of the}} other down very near to its eye. It was repelled, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had <b>said</b> <b>it</b> would be. <b>He</b> then brought the two points together, and they were repelled. But if he brought an eye towards a point, or a point towards an eye, they were attracted.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not so; {{it is our}} son {{who told}} you, and, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>said,</b> so <b>it</b> must be. If you need food, or clothes, or a house, tell the ring and it will find them for you. And if you are unhappy or in danger, tell the casket and it will set things right.' Then they both gave her their blessing, and {{she picked up her}} baby and went her way.|$|R
60|$|On a knowe which {{commanded}} the castle, {{in a manner}} that would have pained Sir Dugald Dalgetty, Mr. Macrae had erected, not a 'sconce,' but an observatory, with a telescope that 'licked the Lick thing,' <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>said.</b> Indeed <b>it</b> was his foible 'to see the Americans and go one better,' and he spoke without tolerance of the late boss American millionaire, the celebrated J. P. van Huytens, recently deceased.|$|R
