5000|$|Electronic brakeforce {{distribution}} (EBD or EBFD) or electronic brakeforce limitation (EBL) is an automobile brake technology that automatically varies {{the amount of}} force applied to each of a vehicle's wheels, based on road conditions, speed, loading, etc. Always coupled with <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> <b>systems</b> (<b>ABS),</b> EBD can apply more or less braking pressure to each wheel {{in order to maximize}} stopping power whilst maintaining vehicular control. [...] Typically, the front end carries the most weight and EBD distributes less braking pressure to the rear brakes so the rear brakes do not lock up and cause a skid. In some systems, EBD distributes more braking pressure at the rear brakes during initial brake application before the effects of weight transfer become apparent.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In road vehicles, {{wheel locking}} can be {{prevented}} by means of closed-loop <b>Anti-lock</b> <b>Braking</b> <b>Systems</b> (<b>ABS).</b> Two output measured variables are usually considered for regulation: wheel- deceleration and wheel longitudinal slip. The traditional controlled variable used in ABS is the wheel deceleration, since it can be easily measured with a simple wheel encoder; however, it can be dynamically critical if the road-surface rapidly changes. On the other hand, the regulation of the longitudinal slip is much robust from the dynamical point of view, but the slip measurement is critical, since it requires the estimation of the longitudinal vehicle speed. In this work a control strategy is proposed, where the regulated variable {{is a combination of}} wheel deceleration and longitudinal slip...|$|E
40|$|Abstract <b>Anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> <b>systems</b> (<b>ABS)</b> {{have been}} {{developed}} to reduce tendency for wheel lock and improve vehicle control during sudden braking especially on slippery road surfaces. The objective of such control is to increase wheel tractive force in the desired direction while maintaining adequate vehicle stability and steerability and also reducing the vehicle stopping distance. In this paper, a genetic-fuzzy ABS controller is designed. The objective function is defined to maintain wheel slip to a desired level so that maximum wheel tractive force and maximum vehicle deceleration are obtained. All parameters of membership functions and rules of the fuzzy system that is Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) type are obtained using a genetic algorithm.

In lock-up conditions on loose gravel surfaces, the non- ABS vehicle formed a 'wedge' of loose material in front of each wheel, which increased the braking force. With the increasing number of vehicles equipped with ABS on the roads, coupled with the high proportion of unsealed road surfaces worldwide, a system capable of detecting changes in the road surface from sealed to gravel which would provide a signal to disengage the ABS, could provide a significant advance in vehicle safety...|$|E

40|$|The {{brake system}} {{is one of}} the most {{critical}} car sub-systems for what concerns safety issues. Modern automobiles are equipped with <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> <b>systems</b> (<b>ABS),</b> which have improved passengers and driver security by automatically adjusting the braking force during braking in potentially dangerous conditions. For model-based control design techniques of ABS algorithms, satisfactory improvements may be achieved if a sufficiently accurate mathematical model of the brake system is available. Nevertheless, the control synthesis may become prohibitive for such techniques if the model is too detailed. In this paper a realistic, but simple, car brake system model for longitudinal control design purposes is illustrated. The model is built starting from the modeling of the individual components characteristic dynamics.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the design of an {{innovative}} active braking control system for two-wheeled vehicles which can handle panic braking on curves. In the field of two-wheeled vehicles the spread of electronic control systems its still in its infancy, as today only a few commercial motorbikes are equipped with <b>Anti-lock</b> <b>Braking</b> <b>Systems</b> (<b>ABS).</b> Moreover, the few ABS systems available are certified to work only when panic braking occurs on straight road. As will be shown, to guarantee safety when braking on curves, the designed controller needs to rely on an online measure of the vehicle roll angle. Thus, to prove the industrial applicability of the proposed control algorithm, we also describe how such quantity can be effectively estimated via a suitable algorithm based on a low-cost sensors configuration, whose effectiveness is assessed in simulation and also on an instrumented test vehicle.

The proposed peak slip value estimation strategy is analysed and tested both in simulation and on data collected on an instrumented test vehicle. In the latter case, the vehicle speed estimation algorithm is used, and the estimated vehicle speed provided as input for friction estimation.

40|$|English When {{developing}} modern {{control systems}} like <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> <b>systems</b> (<b>ABS),</b> traction control (TC), brake assistant (BAS) and electronic stability programs (ESP) to increase safety and comfort in vehi-cles, accurate tyre models are very important.

Testing facilities like the tyre measurement tower are needed to provide the necessary experimental data to validate these tyre models. The tyre measurement tower of the Dynamics and Control section of the TU Eindhoven, is already capable of simulating different situations, but it needs hydraulic actuators to subject the wheel to vertical vibra-tions and alternating steer angles. This report discusses {{the design of a}} vertical hydraulic actuator for the tyre measurement tower. A theoretical model of the hydraulic actuator and the measurement tower is developed, to determine what size of hydraulic cylinder is needed to fulfill the demands for good tyre measurement. This is done for a-symmetrical and symmetrical cylinder types. The size of these hydraulic cylinders limit the choice between servo valves, and this choice has a substantial effect on the dynamics of the total system.

40|$|Rapid {{advances}} {{have been made}} in the field of vehicle dynamics in terms of improving the ride, handling and safety using actuators and control systems. Optimising a vehicle’s ride comfort or handling has led to the development of semi-active suspension systems. <b>Anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> <b>systems</b> (<b>ABS)</b> have resulted in significant improvements in vehicle braking whilst maintaining directional control over the vehicle. These {{advances have}} improved vehicle and occupant safety in general, but there are often some trade-offs. For example, the stopping distance of a vehicle fitted with ABS on an undulating road is significantly increased compared to braking without ABS. This has severe implications, especially in the off-road vehicle industry. The effects of spring and damper characteristics on the braking performance of a sports-utility-vehicle (SUV) on hard rough terrain are investigated. The approach is simulation based, using an experimentally validated full vehicle model of the SUV, built in Adams in co-simulation with MATLAB and Simulink. The simulations were performed on measured road profiles of a Belgian paving and parallel corrugations (or a washboard road). The results indicate that the suspension system has a significant impact on the braking performance, resulting in differences in stopping distances of up to 9 m.

These systems have been evolving since their origin, always keeping the same objective, by using increasingly sophisticated algorithms and complex brake and torque control architectures. The aim of this work is to develop and implement a new control model of a traction control system to be installed on a motorcycle, regulating the slip in traction and improving dynamic performance of two-wheeled vehicles. This paper presents a novel traction control algorithm based on the use of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Fuzzy Logic. An ANN is used to estimate the optimal slip of the surface the vehicle is moving on. A fuzzy logic control block, which makes use of the optimal slip provided by the ANN, is developed to control the throttle position. Two control blocks have been tuned. The first control block has been tuned according to the experience of an expert operator. The second one has been optimized using Evolutionary Computation (EC). Simulation shows that the use of EC can improve the fuzzy logic based control algorithm, obtaining better results than those produced with the control tuned only by experience. Universidad de Málaga.
