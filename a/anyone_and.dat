5|$|Baeyertz's {{husband died}} on 6 March 1871 {{at the age}} of 28, two days after a {{shooting}} accident. She turned to the Anglican church to help her and she experienced a full conversion to the religion. She put her children into boarding school and became an evangelist, visiting jails and hospitals to spread the religion, as well as door-to-door preaching to the Jewish areas of Melbourne. She did not manage to convert <b>anyone,</b> <b>and</b> ended up with her life threatened.|$|E
5|$|Rain started falling {{again and}} heavy fog {{closed in on}} the {{mountain}} top and severely reduced visibility there. Again the North Koreans attacked the 2nd Platoon and the adjacent E Company infantrymen. One of the engineers was shot through the neck and Vandygriff {{sent him to the}} company command post, only to have the man return to report that there was no longer a command post, that he could not find <b>anyone</b> <b>and</b> had seen only North Korean dead. Vandygriff now went to the noncommissioned officer who was in command of the E Company platoon and inform him. The two decided to withdraw.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} {{is named after}} Richard Appel's wife, who is the novelist Mona Simpson. The inspiration for the character comes from Bernardine Dohrn of the Weather Underground, although the writers acknowledge that several people fit her description. Her crime was intentionally the least violent crime the writers could think of, as she did not harm <b>anyone</b> <b>and</b> was only caught because {{she came back to}} help Mr. Burns.|$|E
5|$|Vorazun {{had accused}} Zeratul of treasion against the Nerazim {{for his role}} in the death of her mother.

It wasn't until following Zeratul's prophecy's that lead to Ulnar, she admitted that he was closer to the truth than <b>anyone</b> <b>and</b> after finally realizing that Zeratul's dedication to the Xel'naga prophecy's gave the protoss hope, she vowed to honor him with Artanis.|$|E
5|$|As a {{reflection}} of categories of sexuality so sharply defined {{by the government and}} society at large, lesbian subculture developed extremely rigid gender roles between women, particularly among the working class in the U.S. and Canada. Although many municipalities had enacted laws against cross-dressing, some women would socialize in bars as butches: dressed in men's clothing and mirroring traditional masculine behavior. Others wore traditionally feminine clothing and assumed a more diminutive role as femmes. Butch and femme modes of socialization were so integral within lesbian bars that women who refused to choose between the two would be ignored, or at least unable to date <b>anyone,</b> <b>and</b> butch women becoming romantically involved with other butch women or femmes with other femmes was unacceptable.|$|E

5|$|In {{the opener}} of the 2017 NLDS against the Arizona Diamondbacks, he allowed four solo {{home runs in}} 6 innings but still picked up the win. The four home runs were tied for the most allowed in a postseason game. He made two starts in the 2017 NLCS against the Chicago Cubs, both Dodgers wins, {{including}} the clinching game five. He allowed three runs in 11 innings in the two games with nine strikeouts and only two walks. Kershaw started the opening game of the 2017 World Series for the Dodgers against the Houston Astros. He struckout 11 batters in the game without walking <b>anyone</b> <b>and</b> only allowed one run (a solo homer) on three hits {{to pick up the}} win. His 11 strikeouts were the third most ever by a Dodgers pitcher in a World Series game, after Sandy Koufax (15 in 1963) and Carl Erskine (14 in 1953).|$|E
5|$|Mengele and the Stammers {{bought a}} house {{on a farm in}} Caieiras in 1969, with Mengele as half owner. When Wolfgang Gerhard {{returned}} to Germany in 1971 to seek medical treatment for his seriously ill wife and son, he gave his identity card to Mengele. The Stammers had a falling out with Mengele in late 1974 and {{bought a house}} in São Paulo; Mengele was not invited. The Stammers bought a bungalow in the Eldorado neighbourhood of São Paulo, which they rented out to Mengele. Rolf, who had not seen his father since the ski holiday in 1956, visited him there in 1977 and found an unrepentant Nazi who claimed he had never personally harmed <b>anyone</b> <b>and</b> had only done his duty.|$|E
5|$|Not {{yet ready}} to confront the United States directly, Tecumseh {{found that he was}} opposed by those Native American leaders who had signed the treaty. He {{threatened}} to kill <b>anyone</b> <b>and</b> their followers who carried out the terms of the treaty. Tecumseh began to travel widely, urging warriors to abandon the accommodationist chiefs and to join his resistance at Prophetstown. Tecumseh insisted that the Fort Wayne treaty was illegitimate. In an 1810 meeting with Governor Harrison, he demanded that Harrison nullify the treaty and warned that settlers should not attempt to settle the lands sold in the treaty. Harrison rejected his demands and insisted that the tribes could have individual relations with the United States.|$|E

5|$|The Upanishad {{asserts that}} anyone can renounce – this choice is entirely up to the individual, {{regardless}} of which Ashrama (stage of life) he is in. The Jabala Upanishad seems to justify suicide as an individual choice in certain circumstances, a view opposed by earlier Vedic texts and Principal Upanishads. Those too sick may renounce the worldly life in their mind. The Jabala Upanishad presents the Vedanta philosophy view that one who truly renounces lives an ethical life, which includes not injuring anyone in thought, word or deed. Such a sannyasi (renunciate) abandons all rituals, is without attachments to anything or <b>anyone,</b> <b>and</b> is one who {{is devoted to the}} oneness of Atman and Brahman.|$|E
5|$|The {{claim that}} all humans are due {{dignity and respect}} as {{autonomous}} agents means that medical professionals should be happy for their treatments to be performed on <b>anyone</b> <b>and</b> that patients must never be treated merely as useful for society. Kant's approach to sexual ethics emerged from his view that humans should never be used merely {{as a means to}} an end, leading him to regard sexual activity as degrading and to condemn certain specific sexual practices - for example, extramarital sex. Feminist philosophers have used Kantian ethics to condemn practices such as prostitution and pornography because they treat women as ends. Kant also believed that, because animals do not possess rationality, we cannot have duties to them except indirect duties not to develop immoral dispositions through cruelty towards them. Kant used the example of lying as an application of his ethics: because there is a perfect duty to tell the truth, we must never lie, even if it seems that lying would bring about better consequences than telling the truth.|$|E
5|$|The trial adjourned on 14 August, and {{the verdict}} was read on 12 December. The judges {{declared}} him not guilty of personally killing <b>anyone</b> <b>and</b> not guilty of overseeing and controlling {{the activities of the}} Einsatzgruppen. He was deemed responsible for the dreadful conditions on board the deportation trains and for obtaining Jews to fill those trains. He was found guilty of crimes against humanity, war crimes, and crimes against Poles, Slovenes and Gypsies. He was also found guilty of membership in three organisations that had been deemed criminal at the Nuremberg trials: the Gestapo, the SD, and the SS. When considering the sentence, the judges concluded that Eichmann had not merely been following orders, but believed in the Nazi cause wholeheartedly and had been a key perpetrator of the genocide. On 15 December 1961, Eichmann was sentenced to death by hanging.|$|E

5|$|Benjamin {{worked to}} deny Douglas the 1860 Democratic presidential nomination, feeling {{he had turned}} against the South. Douglas contended that {{although}} the Supreme Court, in Dred Scott v. Sandford, had stated Congress could not restrict slavery in the territories, the people of each territory could pass legislation to bar it. This position was anathema to the South. Benjamin praised Douglas's opponent in his re-election bid, former congressman Abraham Lincoln, for at least being true to his principles as an opponent of the expansion of slavery, whereas the senator considered Douglas to be a hypocrite. Benjamin was joined in his opposition to Douglas by Senator Davis; the two were so successful that the 1860 convention {{was not able to}} nominate <b>anyone</b> <b>and</b> split into Northern and Southern factions. The Northerners backed Douglas while Southern delegates chose Vice President John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky. Despite their agreement in opposing Douglas, Benjamin and Davis differed on some race issues: in May, Benjamin voted for a bill to aid Africans liberated by U.S. naval vessels from illegal slave ships, in order to return them to their native continent from Key West. Davis and many other Southerners opposed the bill.|$|E
5|$|Final Destination 3 was {{originally}} {{the last part}} of a trilogy and had been in development since the release of Final Destination 2. Jeffrey Reddick, creator of the franchise and one of the co-writers of the first two films, did not return for the third installment. According to director James Wong, unlike the second film, which was closely tied to the first, Final Destination 3 was envisioned as a stand-alone sequel featuring new characters from the beginning, stating:e really felt that the idea of Final Destination, or the fact that Death can visit you and you can cheat death, that that could happen to <b>anyone.</b> <b>And</b> so we wanted to divorce from the first film character wise. We didn't want to follow that same thread. Part of the difficulty in that is when a character understands what happened to them before; it's a whole different way in which they react to what's happening now. We felt the franchise could exist with a new group of people, instead of following those older characters all the way through. We wanted to see if this could work.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} at the tavern, Morrison meets Brown's wife (Agi Szirtes), and tells her that Brown is under {{suspicion}} for the theft and for the murder at the quayside. He asks for her help in finding him and repeats to her Mitchell's offer to Brown, but she remains silent. At home, Henriette tells Maloin she found a man in their hut at the seaside, and in fear locked the door and ran home. An agitated Maloin tells her not to tell <b>anyone,</b> <b>and</b> leaves for the hut. He unlocks the door, and receiving no response to his calling Brown's name, steps inside, closing the door behind. Minutes later he re-emerges, breathing heavily. After pausing to compose himself, he locks the door and leaves. In the next scene, Maloin presents the briefcase to Morrison in the tavern, and asks him to arrest him, confessing to having killed Brown an hour ago. Morrison leaves with Maloin for the hut, dismissing the frenzied inquiries of Brown's wife about her husband and handing the briefcase to the barkeep on the way out. Brown's wife follows the men to the hut, and emerges weeping with Morrison moments later. Back at the tavern, Morrison prepares two envelopes with {{a small portion of}} the recovered money in each. One he leaves with the grieving widow to whom he apologizes and wishes well, while the other he gives to Maloin, telling him that his case was one of self-defense. As he is preparing to leave, Morrison advises Maloin to go home and forget the whole affair. The camera focuses on the expressionless face of Brown's wife momentarily before fading to white.|$|E
