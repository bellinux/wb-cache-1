5|$|After {{the death}} of Theophilos in 842, new {{measures}} to confront the Cretan threat were undertaken by the new Byzantine regime: in 843 a new maritime theme, that of the Aegean Sea, was established to better deal with the Arabs raids, and another expedition to recover Crete was launched under the personal leadership of the powerful logothetes and regent Theoktistos. Although it succeeded in occupying much of the island, Theoktistos had to abandon the army due to political intrigues in Constantinople, and the troops left behind were slaughtered by the <b>Arabs.</b> <b>In</b> an effort to weaken the <b>Arabs</b> <b>in</b> 853, several Byzantine fleets engaged in coordinated operations in the Eastern Mediterranean, attacking the Egyptian naval base of Damietta and capturing weapons intended for Crete. Despite some Byzantine successes against the <b>Arabs</b> <b>in</b> the following years, the Cretans resumed their raids in the early 860s, attacking the Peloponnese, the Cyclades, and Athos. In 866, the Byzantine Caesar Bardas assembled another large-scale expeditionary force to subdue Crete, but his murder by Basil the Macedonian only {{two weeks after the}} fleet set sail from the capital spelled the end of the undertaking.|$|E

5|$|Cubeb reached Africa {{by way of}} the <b>Arabs.</b> <b>In</b> Moroccan cuisine, cubeb is used in savory {{dishes and}} in {{pastries}} like markouts, little diamonds of semolina with honey and dates. It also appears occasionally in the list of ingredients for the famed spice mixture Ras el hanout. In Indonesian cuisine, especially in Indonesian gulés (curries), cubeb is frequently used.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not easy}} to assess the {{importance}} of the Byzantine navy to the Empire's history. On one hand, the Empire, throughout its life, had to defend a long coastline, often with little hinterland. In addition, shipping was always the quickest and cheapest way of transport, and the Empire's major urban and commercial centres, as well as most of its fertile areas, lay close to the sea. Coupled with the threat posed by the <b>Arabs</b> <b>in</b> the 7th to 10th centuries, this necessitated the maintenance of a strong fleet. The navy was perhaps at its most significant in the successful defence of Constantinople from the two Arab sieges, which ultimately saved the Empire. Throughout the period however, naval operations were {{an essential part of the}} Byzantine effort against the <b>Arabs</b> <b>in</b> a game of raids and counter-raids that continued up to the late 10th century.|$|E
5|$|The {{city walls}} were rebuilt {{a number of}} times, {{including}} by the Byzantine Empire in around the 8th century AD, the <b>Arabs</b> <b>in</b> around the 11th century, and the Kingdom of Sicily in the medieval period until the 15th century. Most of the extant fortifications were built by the Order of Saint John between the 16th and 18th centuries.|$|E

5|$|According to Ottoman {{statistics}} {{studied by}} Justin McCarthy, {{the population of}} Palestine in the early 19th century was 350,000, in 1860 it was 411,000 and in 1900 about 600,000 of whom 94% were <b>Arabs.</b> <b>In</b> 1914 Palestine had a population of 657,000 Muslim Arabs, 81,000 Christian Arabs, and 59,000 Jews. McCarthy estimates the non-Jewish population of Palestine at 452,789 in 1882; 737,389 in 1914; 725,507 in 1922; 880,746 in 1931; and 1,339,763 in 1946.|$|E
5|$|After {{putting an}} end to the {{internal}} strife, Basil II launched a counter-campaign against the <b>Arabs</b> <b>in</b> 995. The Byzantine civil wars had weakened the Empire's position in the east, and the gains of Nikephoros II Phokas and John I Tzimiskes came close to being lost, with Aleppo besieged and Antioch under threat. Basil won several battles in Syria, relieving Aleppo, taking over the Orontes valley, and raiding further south. Although {{he did not have the}} force to drive into Palestine and reclaim Jerusalem, his victories did restore much of Syria to the empire — including the larger city of Antioch which was the seat of its eponymous Patriarch.|$|E
5|$|All three named commanders were slain {{during the}} battle, and Khalid was {{selected}} as the commander. He was able to maintain his heavily outnumbered army of 3,000 men against an army of 10,000 of the Byzantine Empire and Ghassanid <b>Arabs</b> <b>in</b> what would be known as the Battle of Mu'tah. Khalid assumed command of the Muslim army at the crucial moment, and defeated the Byzantine forces even when another 10,000 soldiers had arrived as reinforcements for the Byzantines.|$|E

5|$|Arab historians {{argue that}} Israel {{had entered the}} Battle of Karameh with too much confidence, since it took place just after Israel had {{defeated}} the <b>Arabs</b> <b>in</b> the 1967 Six-Day War. The size of the Israeli forces entering Karameh made the Jordanians assume that Israel was also planning to occupy the eastern bank of the Jordan River, including the Balqa Governorate, {{in order to create}} a Golan Heights similar situation so as to be used a bargaining chip. Jordanians claim that Moshe Dayan invited Israeli journalists on the previous day for lunch in western Jordan after occupying it.|$|E
5|$|As an {{industrial}} port city, Haifa {{has traditionally been}} a Labor party stronghold. The strong presence of dock workers and trade unions earned it the nickname 'Red Haifa.' In addition, many prominent <b>Arabs</b> <b>in</b> the Israeli Communist Party, among them Tawfik Toubi, Emile Habibi, Zahi Karkabi, Bulus Farah and Emile Toma, were from Haifa. In recent years, {{there has been a}} drift toward the center. This was best signified by, in the 2006 legislative elections, the Kadima party receiving about 28.9% of the votes in Haifa, and Labor lagging behind with 16.9%.|$|E
5|$|In 965 or 966, a Bulgarian embassy {{visited the}} Byzantine emperor Nikephoros II Phokas (r. 963–969) at Constantinople {{to receive the}} annual tribute that had been agreed by the two powers {{as the price of}} peace in 927. Phokas, flush and self-confident from a series of {{victories}} against the <b>Arabs</b> <b>in</b> the East that had led to the recovery of Crete, Cyprus and Cilicia, refused to comply, and even had the envoys beaten up. He followed this up with a show of military strength, by sending a small force to raze a number of Bulgarian border posts in Thrace.|$|E

5|$|In {{the middle}} of May, the {{situation}} for the 50,000 Arab inhabitants {{of the city and}} the 30,000–40,000 in the outlying neighbourhoods was no better. After the massacre at Deir Yassin and the Jewish offensive of April that triggered the large-scale exodus of the Palestinian <b>Arabs</b> <b>in</b> other mixed cities, the Arab population of Jerusalem was frightened and feared for its fate. With the departure of the British on 14 May, the Haganah launched several operations to take control {{of the city and the}} local Arab leadership requested King Abdullah of Jordan to deploy his army to come to their aid.|$|E
5|$|The British {{camp was}} {{targeted}} for {{attack by the}} Irgun on two occasions. On 27 June 1939, the paramilitary group placed a letter bomb in the mailbox attached to the outside wall; the subsequent explosion collapsed part of the wall and injured five <b>Arabs</b> <b>in</b> the vicinity. On 12 March 1947, the Irgun penetrated the camp itself in a pre-dawn operation and detonated explosives {{in one of the}} buildings to protest the imposition of martial law on Jerusalem. One British soldier was killed and eight injured in the blasts; martial law was lifted four days later.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine Empire's {{military}} {{position in}} the Balkans collapsed in the early 7th century {{as a result of}} disastrous military ventures against the Persians and then the <b>Arabs</b> <b>in</b> the East, which forced the effective abandonment of the Danube limes and opened the way for large-scale penetration and settlement of the Balkan hinterland by various Slavic tribes. The Slavs raided as far as southern Greece and the coasts of Asia Minor. Most of the region's cities were sacked or abandoned and only a few, including Thessalonica, remained occupied and in imperial hands.|$|E

5|$|The {{first such}} campaign, an {{attempted}} reconquest of the Emirate of Crete led by Theoktistos in person, made initial gains, but ultimately ended in disaster. After scoring {{a victory over}} the <b>Arabs</b> <b>in</b> Crete, Theoktistos learned of a rumour that Theodora intended to name a new emperor, possibly her brother Bardas. Theoktistos hurried back to Constantinople, where he discovered that the rumour was false, but in his absence, the Byzantine army in Crete was routed by the Arabs.|$|E
5|$|The {{withdrawal}} {{of large numbers}} of troops from the Balkans to combat the Persians and then the <b>Arabs</b> <b>in</b> the east opened the door for the gradual southward expansion of Slavic peoples into the peninsula, and, as in Asia Minor, many cities shrank to small fortified settlements. In the 670s, the Bulgars were pushed south of the Danube by the arrival of the Khazars. In 680, Byzantine forces sent to disperse these new settlements were defeated.|$|E
5|$|Under Basil's son and successor, Leo VI the Wise, {{the gains}} in the east against the now-weak Abbasid Caliphate continued. However, Sicily was lost to the <b>Arabs</b> <b>in</b> 902, and in 904 Thessaloniki, the Empire's second city, was sacked by an Arab fleet. The naval {{weakness}} of the Empire was rectified. Despite this revenge the Byzantines were still unable to strike a decisive blow against the Muslims, who inflicted a crushing defeat on the imperial forces when they attempted to regain Crete in 911.|$|E
