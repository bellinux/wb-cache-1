5|$|We've Come for You <b>All</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> ninth studio album by American thrash metal band Anthrax. It was {{released}} on May 6, 2003 through Nuclear Blast in Europe and Sanctuary Records in North America. This was the first Anthrax record to feature Rob Caggiano on lead guitar and their final studio album with John Bush on vocals. The album was recorded over one-year span at the BearTracks Recording Studio in Suffern, New York. The cover art was designed by comic book artist Alex Ross, while the production was handed by Scrap 60 Productions team. The Who vocalist Roger Daltrey and Pantera guitarist Dimebag Darrell made guest appearances on the album.|$|E

25|$|But {{the most}} geometrically {{symmetrical}} version of <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> original Sudanese Möbius {{band in the}} three-sphere S3, where its full group of symmetries is isomorphic to the Lie group O(2). Having an infinite cardinality (that of the continuum), this is far larger than the symmetry group of any possible embedding of the Möbius band in R3.|$|E
25|$|Verbs whose stems end in i (bri- 'have', wi- 'tell', pi- 'eat', di- 'drink', swi- 'allow') {{vary from}} the above {{paradigm}} in a few minor points. Bal-aia 'come' and w-aia 'go', have an irregular Present I tense. The verb yabaia 'give' is anomalous {{in a different way}} by having irregularly derived non-third-person object-indexing forms. Finally, the most irregular verb of <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> defective and irregular kaia 'to be'.|$|E
25|$|Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (<b>ALL)</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{most common}} type of leukemia in young children. It also affects adults, {{especially}} those 65 and older. Standard treatments involve chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The survival rates vary by age: 85% in children and 50% in adults. Subtypes include precursor B acute lymphoblastic leukemia, precursor T acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Burkitt's leukemia, and acute biphenotypic leukemia.|$|E

50|$|In general, a mid-riser or mid-tread {{quantizer}} may {{not actually}} be a uniform quantizer - i.e., {{the size of the}} quantizer's classification intervals may not <b>all</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> same, or the spacing between its possible output values may not <b>all</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> same. The distinguishing characteristic of a mid-riser quantizer is that it has a classification threshold value that is exactly zero, and the distinguishing characteristic of a mid-tread quantizer is that is it has a reconstruction value that is exactly zero.|$|R

25|$|One for <b>All</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{debut album}} by American hip hop group Brand Nubian. It was {{released}} by Elektra Records on December 4, 1990. The album was highly acclaimed for its politically charged and socially conscious content. Sales never matched the wide acclaim — the album has only sold 350,000 copies as of May 2013 — but it has remained in print since its 1990 release.|$|E
25|$|Other {{important}} complexity classes include BPP, ZPP and RP, {{which are}} defined using probabilistic Turing machines; AC and NC, which are defined using Boolean circuits; and BQP and QMA, which are defined using quantum Turing machines. #P {{is an important}} complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems). Classes like IP and AM are defined using Interactive proof systems. <b>ALL</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> class of all decision problems.|$|E

25|$|On 24 August 2012, 33-year-old Norwegian Anders Behring Breivik {{was found}} guilty by the Oslo District Court of having perpetrated by himself both {{terrorist}} attacks, {{the bombing of the}} prime minister's office and the shooting spree on Utøya island, and was convicted to containment, a special form of prison sentence that can be extended indefinitely—with a time frame of 21 years and a minimum time of 10 years, which, in <b>all,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> maximum penalty in Norway.|$|E
25|$|Partly due also to {{the variety}} of climates in Japan and the {{millennium}} encompassed between the first cultural import and the last, the result is extremely heterogeneous, but several practically universal features can nonetheless be found. First of <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> choice of materials, always wood in various forms (planks, straw, tree bark, etc.) for almost all structures. Unlike both Western and some Chinese architecture, the use of stone is avoided except for certain specific uses, for example temple podia and pagoda foundations.|$|E

25|$|Most of the climbs {{are located}} in a {{relatively}} small area, causing the roads to turn constantly and often abruptly, which explains the winding and irregular trajectory of the finale. The Oude Kwaremont is the longest climb at 2.2km: an atypical hill {{because it is not}} very steep, but {{considered one of the most}} arduous climbs in Flanders because of its length and cobbled surface. The steepest of <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> fully cobbled Koppenberg, 600meters in length with grueling stretches of 22% over a poorly paved narrow road.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} novel's three female protagonists, {{and the three}} {{symbiotic}} storylines that they appear in, there are other examples in the novel where Cunningham patterns his story on groups of three. Most conspicuous of <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> threeway relationship that once existed between Clarissa, Richard and Louis when they were three students on holiday together. In the 'Mrs. Woolf' storyline there is another grouping of three (biographically factual) in Vanessa's three children, Quentin, Julian, and Angelica, who come with their mother to visit Virginia. Then there is the nuclear family of three we find in Laura Brown, her husband Dan, and their son Richie.|$|E
25|$|Herring often move {{in large}} schools around fishing banks {{and near the}} coast. The most {{abundant}} and commercially important species belong to the genus Clupea, found particularly in shallow, temperate waters of the North Pacific and the North Atlantic Oceans, including the Baltic Sea, as well as off {{the west coast of}} South America. Three species of Clupea are recognised, and provide about 90% of all herrings captured in fisheries. Most abundant of <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic herring, providing over half of all herring capture. Fishes called herring are also found in the Arabian Sea, Indian Ocean, and Bay of Bengal.|$|E

The World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalization was established by the ILO's governing body in February 2002 at the initiative of the director-general {{in response to the}} fact that there did not appear to be a space within the multilateral system that would cover adequately and comprehensively the social dimension of the various aspects of globalization. The World Commission Report, A Fair Globalization: Creating Opportunities for <b>All,</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> first attempt at structured dialogue among representatives of constituencies with different interests and opinions on the social dimension of globalization, aimed at finding common ground on one of the most controversial and divisive subjects of our time.|$|E
25|$|The age of {{the various}} {{elements}} in synagogal song may be traced from {{the order in which}} the passages of the text were first introduced into the liturgy and were in turn regarded as so important as to demand special vocalization. This order closely agrees with that in which the successive tones and styles still preserved for these elements came into use among the Gentile neighbors of the Jews who utilized them. Earliest of <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> cantillation of the Scriptures, in which the traditions of the various rites differ only as much and in the same manner from one another as their particular interpretations according to the text and occasion differ among themselves. This indeed was to be anticipated if the differentiation itself preserves a peculiarity of the music of the Temple (see Jew. Encyc. iii. 539a, s.v. Cantillation).|$|E
25|$|The {{architecture}} of Denmark has {{its origins in}} the Viking age but became recognizable in the Middle Ages when first Romanesque, then Gothic churches and cathedrals sprang up throughout the country. Inspired by French castles and {{with the assistance of}} Dutch designers, architecture during the Renaissance flourished with magnificent royal palaces. Neoclassicism came to Denmark from France and, in the 19th century, slowly merged into the National Romantic style when Danish designers came into their own. It was, however, not until {{the last half of the}} 20th century that Danish architects entered the world scene with their highly successful Functionalism. This, in turn, has evolved into more recent world-class designers such as Johann Otto von Spreckelsen who designed the Grande Arche in Paris. Internationally, perhaps the most celebrated of <b>all</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> architect who designed the iconic Sydney Opera House, Jørn Utzon, but within Danish borders, it is the architect Arne Jacobsen who is perhaps held in highest esteem for developing the 'Danish Modern' style and furniture/interior design, such as the now world-famous and much sought-after Swan and Egg chairs. A new wave of young Danish architects are rising into international prominence, like Bjarke Ingels with works such as the Danish National Pavilion at the Shanghai 2010 Expo.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{consider}} a street where <b>the</b> odd-numbered houses <b>are</b> <b>all</b> on <b>the</b> north (expensive) {{side of the}} road, and <b>the</b> even-numbered houses <b>are</b> <b>all</b> on <b>the</b> south (cheap) side. Under the sampling scheme given above, {{it is impossible to}} get a representative sample; either the houses sampled will <b>all</b> <b>be</b> from <b>the</b> odd-numbered, expensive side, or they will <b>all</b> <b>be</b> from <b>the</b> even-numbered, cheap side, unless the researcher has previous knowledge of this bias and avoids it by a using a skip which ensures jumping between the two sides (any odd-numbered skip).|$|R
