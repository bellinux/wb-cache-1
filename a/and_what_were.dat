25|$|When the Netherlands toured Pakistan in April 2001, Rambaldo {{featured}} {{in six of}} their seven ODIs against the Pakistani national team, and finished the tournament behind only Pauline te Beest and Carolien Salomons for runs scored. In the sixth game, as the ninth player brought on to bowl, she finished 2/13 from five overs – her first ODI wickets <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>were</b> to be her best bowling figures. In 2003, Rambaldo moved to South Africa to study sport science at Western Cape's Stellenbosch University. She continued {{to play for the}} Netherlands throughout her degree, but also played cricket for her university and for Boland in the South African provincial set-up, until graduating in 2006.|$|E
25|$|Those who {{believed}} Dean and Angeli were deeply in love claim {{a number of}} forces led them apart. Angeli's mother disapproved of Dean's casual dress <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>were,</b> for her at least, radical behavior traits: his T-shirt attire, late dates, fast cars, {{and the fact that}} he was not a Catholic. Her mother said that such behavior was not acceptable in Italy. In addition, Warner Bros., where he worked, tried to talk him out of marrying and he himself told Angeli that he didn't want to get married. Richard Davalos, Dean's East of Eden co-star, claimed that Dean wanted to marry Angeli and was willing to allow their children to be brought up Catholic.|$|E
25|$|The ruling dynastic {{family of}} the Han dynasty was the Liu family, founded by Liu Bang, whose career ranged from being a minor {{official}} (sort of like a local sheriff during the rapid disintegration and chaos of {{the final years of}} the Qin dynasty) to being an outlaw and a rebel hiding out in the hills, to being the King of Chu during the Division of Qin into 18 states, or kingdoms. He was posthumously honored as Han High Founder or Han Great Ancestor (Gaozu) Emperor. Despite his folksy background, general lack of literacy, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>were</b> considered generally vulgar ways, Liu Bang had a great regard for literature and learning. His patronage of literature and the arts, as well as his connections with the unique culture of Chu would set a precedent {{for the rest of the}} dynasty which he founded, and which managed to keep much of the political power in the hands of the Liu family: often this was implemented by allowing Liu family princes a great deal of autonomy in their local areas, thus encouraging the development of subsidiary royal courts, besides the main imperial court; and, in some cases, this encouraged princely patronage of literature and the arts, with some greater diversity and cross-fertilization of artistic genres and styles. Other important features of the Han era include the location of the capital in Chang'an during Western Han, and its move to Luoyang in Eastern Han, the extension of the Han empire into new regions, and contact with new peoples and cultures, a development which was extended by the further explorations by people such as Zhang Qian of the Silk Roads fame who in the 2nd century BC got as far as Bactria and Dayuan (Ferghana, in modern eastern Uzbekistan), and among other things brought back alfalfa and grapes to China. Also important in the history of the Han dynasty is the method of recording words, such as poems. Brushing characters with ink is archeologically attested to during the Han period, including on silk, hemp paper, and bamboo slips. The bamboo (or wood) slips were tied together carefully with delicate string cords. When these rotted and broke, the individual slips would become mixed up, and the text which was written upon them thus have often become scrambled. Methods such as stamping or marking on clay or engraving on stone were also used; and, though relatively durable required fairly elaborate craftsmanship to produce. Little poetry from the Han dynasty survives as originally recorded or published, instead most of the preserved poems exist as passed on to the future by the Six Dynasties poetry era anthologies.|$|E

5000|$|For Aristotle, logos is {{something}} more refined than the capacity to make private feelings public: it enables the human being to perform as no other animal can; it {{makes it possible for}} him to perceive and make clear to others through reasoned discourse the difference between <b>what</b> <b>is</b> advantageous <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> harmful, between <b>what</b> <b>is</b> just <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> unjust, <b>and</b> between <b>what</b> <b>is</b> good <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> evil.|$|R
500|$|It was in November 1878 that MCC defined amateur status. Their dictum {{was that}} [...] "a gentleman {{ought not to}} make any profit from playing cricket". This was {{carefully}} worded so that an amateur was allowed to claim reasonable expenses, but controversy persisted about what were [...] "reasonable expenses" [...] <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>were</b> actually [...] "fees". Fred Grace fell foul of this by claiming a fee for representing the USEE and was subsequently banned from representing the Gentlemen in matches at Lord's. W. G. Grace got around his USEE fee by having it classed as a salary {{for his work in}} organising the matches.|$|E

But the book itself is a reminder of how opaque Pakistan-US security relations have been and perhaps continue to be." [...] The editorial also noted that Davis' account of his exit suggested [...] "a range of Pakistani officials bent over backwards to ensure his release" [...] which appeared plausible in light of the U.S. government's public position. However, what could not be ascertained is [...] "whether Pakistani military and government officials were arm-twisted <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>were</b> the parameters of the debate surrounding Mr Davis’s possible release inside Pakistani policymaking circles." ...|$|E
50|$|In its {{exposition}} of progressive meditation for Self-knowledge, the Chandogya Upanishad starts {{by referring to}} the outer worldly knowledges as name. Deeper than this name, is speech asserts verse 7.2.1, because speech <b>is</b> <b>what</b> communicates all outer worldly knowledge as well as <b>what</b> <b>is</b> right <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> wrong, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> true <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> false, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> good <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> bad, <b>what</b> <b>is</b> pleasant <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> unpleasant.

2500|$|The Commission opened {{negotiations}} with the Kiowa, Comanche and Apache at Fort Sill on September 26, 1892. Jerome made an opening presentation, and Quanah Parker asked specifically how much money per acre, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>were</b> the terms offered. Jerome stalled {{on the details of}} money. Other tribal members preferred to defer the negotiations until the Treaty of Medicine Lodge expired. [...] At the next day's session, Parker continued to press Jerome for financial details, as Jerome avoided discussing the money. Sayre detailed the overall offer of $2,000,000 and per capita distribution. Parker once again asked how much per acre. Sayre didn't have an answer, and Parker asked him how he arrived at $2,000,000. To that, Sayre replied, [...] "...we just guess at it." [...] Parker stated that he had heard about price per acre differential between the various tribal agreements. Lone Wolf added that many wanted to defer until the expiration of the Medicine Lodge treaty.|$|E
2500|$|I made a {{whole series}} of studies to prepare this portrait. Drawings and washes in china ink. I {{analysed}} the architecture of the head in monumentally sized enlargements, two or three times the natural size, I made a certain number of drawings of the hands, I studied the organisation and the overall effect, volumes and the relations of the formal elements between themselves. Finally, I reduced the colour to a harmony of blacks and greys supported by some flashes of light red which set up a contrast, at once breaking with and supporting the interplay of harmonious colour relations. Nayral came regularly to the studio, I worked directly on him, naturally, {{but more often than not}} the work consisted in friendly conversation, in walks in the garden, during which I studied him, watching what was his natural way of walking <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>were</b> his usual gestures, above all arming my memory with essential characteristics, trying to isolate his true likeness from the accumulation of details and picturesque superfluities which always interfere with the permanent reality of a being. The portrait was executed without turning to the model, it was finished some weeks before the Automne and I decided to show it... if the jury would be willing to accept it, as I was not yet a member.
