The said tubes failed when exposed to corrosive environment(s). Tubes located at the bottom row of the <b>air</b> <b>fin</b> cooler were corroded as a result of exposure to rain water, brought in by induced air when the wind blows. The tube material is A 179 Carbon steel. Two tubes, namely Tube A and Tube B along with an aluminum fin in each tube were investigated. A leak was observed on tube A, probably due to Corrosion Under Deposit mechanism. A general corrosion attack was observed at tube B, and macroscopic analysis showed that the corrosion occurred along the grain boundaries, which consist of ferrite and pearlite. Microanalysis showed that the corrosion product on the outer surface of the tube {{consists of}} Fe, O, S and Cl elements. It is concluded that the humid environment contains corrosive elements such as S and Cl. EDAX analysis on the fin showed that the material is pure aluminum.

In normal operation the engine is sealed and no gas enters or leaves the engine. No valves are required, unlike other types of piston engines. The Stirling engine, like most heat engines, cycles through four main processes: cooling, compression, heating and expansion. This is accomplished by moving the gas {{back and forth between}} hot and cold heat exchangers, often with a regenerator between the heater and cooler. The hot heat exchanger is in thermal contact with an external heat source, such as a fuel burner, and the cold heat exchanger is in thermal contact with an external heat sink, such as <b>air</b> <b>fins.</b> A change in gas temperature causes a corresponding change in gas pressure, while the motion of the piston causes the gas to be alternately expanded and compressed.|$|R

50|$|To {{cool down}} the engine, a coolant is {{passed through the}} engine block, where it absorbs heat from the engine. The hot coolant is then fed into the inlet tank of the {{radiator}} (located either {{on the top of}} the radiator, or along one side), from which it is distributed across the radiator core through tubes to another tank on the opposite end of the radiator. As the coolant passes through the radiator tubes on its way to the opposite tank, it transfers much of its heat to the tubes which, in turn, transfer the heat to the fins that are lodged between each row of tubes. The fins then release the heat to the ambient <b>air.</b> <b>Fins</b> are used to greatly increase the contact surface of the tubes to the air, thus increasing the exchange efficiency. The cooled coolant is fed back to the engine, and the cycle repeats. Normally, the radiator does not reduce the temperature of the coolant back to ambient air temperature, but it is still sufficiently cooled to keep the engine from overheating.|$|R

40|$|The final {{publication}} {{is available}} at Springer via [URL] reduction of the thermal resistances of the heat exchangers of a thermoelectric generation system (TEG), leads to {{a significant increase in}} the TEG efficiency. For the cold side of a thermoelectric module (TEM), a wide range of heat exchangers has been studied, form simple finned dissipators to more complex water (water-glycol) heat exchangers. As Nusselt numbers are much higher in water heat exchangers than in conventional <b>air</b> <b>finned</b> dissipators, convective thermal resistances are better. However, to conclude which heat exchanger leads to higher efficiencies, it is necessary to include the whole system involved in the heat dissipation, that is, TEM-to-water heat exchanger, water-to-ambient heat exchanger, as well as the required pumps and fans. This paper presents a dynamic computational model able to simulate the complete behavior of a TEG, including both heat exchangers. The model uses the heat transfer and hydraulic equations to compute TEM-to-water and water-to-ambient thermal resistances, along with the resistance of the hot side heat exchanger at different operating conditions. Likewise, the model includes all the thermoelectric effect with temperature-dependent properties. The model calculates the net power generation at different configurations, providing a methodology to design and optimize the heat exchange in order to maximize the net power generation for a whole variety of TEGs.
