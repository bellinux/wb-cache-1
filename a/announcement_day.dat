In the years after her marriage and subsequently her divorce, Diana grew more confident in her choices, and her style underwent a change, with her new choices consisting of blazers, one-shoulder and off-shoulder dresses, two-tone themed suits, military-styled suits, and nude-colored outfits. White shirt and jeans, plaid dresses, jumpsuits and sheath dresses were among the other fashion trends that she tried. After her separation and subsequent divorce, Diana began to take influence from other celebrities in her dressing manners including Cindy Crawford, Madonna, Elizabeth Taylor, {{as well as many}} others.

40|$|This study {{provides}} new {{evidence on the}} effects of macroeconomic news announcements and their impact on the yen/US$ exchange rate. Trading days are divided into 4 groups: (1) major US <b>announcement</b> <b>days,</b> (2) minor US <b>announcement</b> <b>days,</b> (3) Japanese <b>announcement</b> <b>days,</b> and (4) Non-announcement days. These groups are examined to determine the effects they have upon the volatility of intraday (five-minute) returns of yen futures contracts. Both Japanese and US announcements are also examined in order to determine which specific announcements have the greatest affect upon the exchange rate. Both US and Japanese announcements are found to have significant impacts on the volatility of intraday returns of yen futures contracts. Major US announcements were found to have the greatest affect upon the exchange rate, with Japanese announcements having the second largest affect. The increased volatility, due to the release of the announcements continues to affect volatility throughout the day, however the major impact disappears quite rapidl...|$|R

40|$|On {{days when}} {{macroeconomic}} news in Norway {{is scheduled to}} be announced, we find a significant and linear relationship between the market beta and average daily excess return. Using Fama-Macbeth regressions, we estimate a negative market risk premium of - 1. 02 % per month (- 11. 68 % annualized). During our sample period from 2001 - 2015, the realized market risk premium is negative, amounting to - 0. 20 % per month (- 2. 46 % annualized). As a consequence, stocks with higher sensitivity to the market, measured by beta, will earn negative excess return. Hence, our estimate of the implied risk premium turns negative. Using ten beta-sorted portfolios and individual stocks as test assets, we provide empirical evidence of market beta as an important determinant of average excess return in the Norwegian stock market. This risk-return relationship holds on <b>announcement</b> <b>days,</b> while there is no significant relationship on all other trading days. In addition, we test this relationship on different types of <b>announcement</b> <b>days</b> separately, and find no significance. This indicates that it is the aggregated effect of all announcements that cause the significant relationship between market beta and average excess return. Further, we find that our test assets are more affected by Norwegian announcements than announcements from the US, as market beta does not relate significantly to average excess return on US <b>announcement</b> <b>days...</b>|$|R

Using data from January 2005 until July 2007, we investigate whether the surprise created by the EIA announcement, i. e. the difference between the numbers released and what was expected by a group of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, also has an influence on the volatility of natural gas futures prices. We also investigate whether the variance of the survey estimates has a significant influence on the futures price volatility. We find that volatility is higher on <b>announcement</b> <b>days,</b> especially when gas inventories are lower than expected. The magnitude of the surprise also has a significant impact on volatility on <b>announcement</b> <b>days.</b> The variance of the survey estimates, on the other hand, is rarely significant. derivatives; futures; volatility; estimates; surprises; maturity effect; storage announcements; natural gas. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} impact of {{macroeconomic}} announcements on the U. S.

We investigate how macroeconomic announcements affect the return predictability of trade imbalance for the 2 -year, 5 -year, IO-year U. S. Treasury notes and 30 -year U. S. Treasury bonds. The goal of this thesis is to develop a methodology to identify informed trades and estimate the trade imbalance based on informed trades. We use the daily order book slope as a proxy for dispersion of beliefs among investors. Regression results in this thesis indicate that, on <b>announcement</b> <b>days</b> with a high dispersion of beliefs, daily trade imbalance estimated by informed trades significantly predicts returns on the following day. In addition, we develop a trade-imbalance based trading strategy conditional on dispersion of beliefs, informed trades, and <b>announcement</b> <b>days.</b> The trading strategy yields significantly positive net returns for the 2 -year T-notes...|$|R

We propose to employ an extented version of the Constant Conditional Correlations framework of Bollerslev (1990) to describe {{the evolution of the}} first difference of the slope of the term structure. Our main empirical findings can be summarized as follow: (a) The credit spread and the level of the term structure are uncorrelated on macroeconomic <b>announcement</b> <b>days.</b> (b) The credit spread and the level of the term structure are negatively correlated. (c) The credit spread and the slope of the term structure are negatively correlated. (d) The process for the conditional variance of the credit spread is highly persistent. (e) The conditional variance of the credit spread is smaller on macroeconomic <b>announcement</b> <b>days</b> than on other days.

The empirical evidence from a sample of 85 Spin-offs shows positive and affirmative announcement effects on stock prices. The parent of the Spin-off companies encounters positive abnormal returns for the two days before and after the <b>announcement</b> <b>day</b> while the Spin-off companies experience comparable effect after the listing date. The analysis is done over a period of 100 days prior and 50 days subsequent to the <b>announcement</b> <b>day.</b> Three different approaches incorporating non-synchronous _ adjustment, i. e.

It is evidenced that during the announcement period from one day before until the day M&A announcements are actually made, shareholders of acquirers will receive significant positive abnormal returns. In addition, this thesis also examines different determinants, which may affect the abnormal returns of acquirers to identify their relationships. They are cross-border/domestic M&As, methods of payment and directions of mergers.

40|$|The views stated {{here are}} those of the authors and do not {{necessarily}} reflect the views of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, or the Federal Reserve System. We are responsible for all errors. We study the effect of macroeconomic announcements on the 30 Year U. S. Treasury Bond futures. Virtually all trading in the 30 Year Treasury is concentrated in the futures (rather than the spot) market. Consistent with earlier studies, we find that (i) the announcement surprise has a significant contemporaneous effect on yields and (ii) customer order flow is significantly more informative on <b>announcement</b> <b>days</b> than on non-announcement days. Based on a unique feature of the data, we identify futures brokers who execute customer trades but do not trade for their personal accounts (brokers) and futures traders who trade both for customers and their personal accounts in the same day (dual traders). We find that the customer order flow of dual traders is significantly more informative on announcement than on non-announcement days, but customer order flow of brokers is not. Moreover, dual traders make relatively more profits from personal trading on <b>announcement</b> <b>days</b> compared to traders who only observe the aggregate order flow. These results imply that, in the aggregate, some customers have superior information about announcements (e. g. from superior interpretation skills) and that this information is profitable to floor traders who observe the order flow...|$|R

40|$|We {{document}} that earnings announcement-day premia persist beyond the sample period of earlier studies, over different disclosure environments and remain robust to the refinement {{of using the}} expected <b>announcement</b> <b>day</b> rather than the actual <b>announcement</b> <b>day.</b> A portfolio of announcing firms yields returns {{in excess of the}} corresponding risk. Excluding announcers from a well-diversified portfolio, while reducing the standard deviation of that portfolio, also reduces its Sharpe ratio, indicating that this strategy results in a less favorable risk-return trade-off. Finally, we provide evidence that the premia are dramatically reduced when the announcement risk is reduced through preannouncements. In addition, we {{document that}} the continued presence of this premia is likely to result from limits to arbitrage. These findings are consistent with the view that the announcement period returns are likely to represent compensation for announcement risk. ...|$|E
