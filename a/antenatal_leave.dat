40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} the effect of working conditions, occupational stress, and <b>antenatal</b> <b>leave</b> on risk of small-for-gestational age and premature births in Mexico City. METHODS: Over a 3 -month period, 2663 (96. 2 %) of 2767 women who gave birth at three major hospitals and worked at least 3 months during pregnancy were interviewed shortly after delivery. After the exclusion of multiple gestations and birth defects, 261 (10. 0 %) small-for-gestational-age and 288 (11. 0 %) preterm births were identified. RESULTS: For small-for-gestational-age births, working more than 50 hours a week (odds ratio [OR] = 1. 59), standing more than 7 hours a day (OR = 1. 40), and no <b>antenatal</b> <b>leave</b> (OR = 1. 55) were {{associated with an increased}} risk. Women with no <b>antenatal</b> <b>leave</b> were also much more likely to give birth prematurely (OR = 3. 04). CONCLUSIONS: In this study, arduous working conditions and lack of <b>antenatal</b> <b>leave</b> benefits were found to increase the risk of poor birth outcome in Mexican women. Enforcement of existing <b>antenatal</b> <b>leave</b> laws and provision of comparable benefits for the uninsured may reduce the incidence of small-for-gestational-age births and prematurity...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Most {{women in}} the U. S. are {{employed}} during pregnancy and work until the month of childbirth. For many, working throughout pregnancy poses little threat to their health; however, women experiencing difficult pregnancies and/or working in strenuous or inflexible jobs may benefit from taking time from work as they approach childbirth, but almost no empirical evidence examines <b>antenatal</b> <b>leave</b> (ANL). Methods: Using {{a national survey of}} English-speaking women, this paper offers the first national description of ANL and examines state policy predictors of uptake. Results: Thirty-seven percent of employed women worked until the week their baby was due. After controlling for characteristics of women and their jobs, living in a state with any or multiple leave laws increased the probability of ANL by 14 and 23 % points, respectively. Women living in states with multiple leave laws stopped work almost 2 weeks earlier than women in states without a policy. Discussion: Paid leave policies currently being considered at the federal, state, and local levels should consider the potential impact on <b>antenatal</b> <b>leave,</b> in addition to postnatal leave, and how they influence population health...|$|E
40|$|Cumulative {{evidence}} shows that women who experience high stress levels may be at increased risk of early parturition and other adverse pregnancy outcomes. 1 - 11 While recent {{studies suggest that the}} effects of stress on preterm delivery (PTD) may be mediated by increases in placental secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone, (CRH) 4, 7 - 8, 12 - 15 no studies have looked at this relationship among working women specifically. The majority of women work during pregnancy (63 %) most work full-time. 16 - 17 While the gender composition of the workforce has diversified, employer policies and federal employment laws often fail to recognize the shared financial responsibilities or reproductive realities of women. 18 - 19 Our case-control study Juggling Life and Work During Pregnancy conducted in Southern California provided the unique opportunity to: 1) examine occupational, socio-demographic, family and lifestyle stressors, maternal perceived stress, CRH levels, and their relationship to PTD/LBW (low birthweight); and 2) investigate whether <b>antenatal</b> <b>leave</b> may be a beneficial intervention for reducing adverse pregnancy outcomes, particularly in higher-risk subgroups...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} examines {{maternity leave}} policies, utilization and consequences in three separate, but related, papers. In the Introduction, I describe the ways state-level leave policies influence, {{but do not}} perfectly predict, utilization and then discuss the heterogeneity of women’s experiences during pregnancy and post-partum, and how that heterogeneity informs interpretation of results in this field. In Chapter 2 (“Laboring until labor: the prevalence and correlates of antenatal maternity leave in the United States”), I use {{a national survey of}} English-speaking women to examine maternity leave taken in the final weeks of pregnancy. I describe individual-, employer-, and policy-level correlates of <b>antenatal</b> <b>leave</b> (ANL), focusing in particular on variation in state temporary disability insurance (TDI) laws. I find that two-thirds of women in this sample stopped working more than a week before their due date, and that state policies significantly influenced leave-taking, even after controlling for characteristics of women and their jobs. While certain individual-level characteristics of women’s work were important, employer policies were not significantly associated with ANL use or duration. The literature does not yet include a national analysis of <b>antenatal</b> <b>leave</b> and its correlates. This paper fills that gap and sets up the following chapter on the consequences of taking ANL. In Chapter 3 (“Antenatal maternity leave and childbirth using the First Baby Study: a propensity score analysis”), I use survey data from a prospective cohort in Pennsylvania to test whether women who take maternity leave at the end of pregnancy have better labor and delivery outcomes. In this sample of women giving birth for the first time, fully half of the sample did not stop working before delivery. Using propensity score matching, I find that women who did stop working at least two days prior to delivery experienced more negative delivery outcomes, including an increased likelihood of unplanned Cesarean section. This paper highlights the strong selection into leave-taking, particularly in a context of limited leave availability. In Chapter 4 (“The impact of California’s Paid Family Leave law on maternal time use”), I shift focus to postnatal maternity leave and use the American Time Use Survey, a nationally-representative dataset collected by the U. S. Census Bureau, to examine whether the country’s first paid family leave (PFL) law increased the amount of time exposed women spent on childcare and decreased their time in paid work. Using a difference-in-difference-in-difference approach with variation in state, time, and age of youngest child, I find that after PFL, women in California significantly increased the time they spent with children in their care and slightly reduced their time spent working. Exploiting a natural experiment, I am able to avoid some of the selection concerns present in the previous chapter, but the daily diary nature of the data do not illuminate whether time use changed due to leave-taking, schedule changes, or some other factor. The results of these studies will inform future research on maternity leave and maternal health, and guide policymaking with regards to targeting and promoting maternity leave policies...|$|E
