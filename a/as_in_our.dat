25|$|Pope John Paul II {{died in the}} Vatican at {{the time}} of the Change, instead of {{surviving}} until 2005, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> timeline, but Cardinal Ratzinger fled to Umbria, where connections with the worldwide Roman Catholic church were reestablished and he was still elected Pope, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> timeline – and his pontificate lasts until 2022. Perhaps the greatest post-Change success of the Roman Catholic Church was reunification with the Church of England, which led to the crowning of the British monarch (William V) as Emperor of the West.|$|E

25|$|Babylonian {{mathematics}} (also {{known as}} Assyro-Babylonian mathematics) was any mathematics developed or {{practiced by the}} people of Mesopotamia, from the days of the early Sumerians to the fall of Babylon in 539 BC. Babylonian mathematical texts are plentiful and well edited. The Babylonians were able to make great advances in mathematics for two reasons. Firstly, the number 60 is a superior highly composite number, having factors of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60 (including those that are themselves composite), facilitating calculations with fractions. Additionally, unlike the Egyptians and Romans, the Babylonians had a true place-value system, where digits written in the left column represented larger values (much <b>as,</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> base ten system, 734 = 7×100 + 3×10 + 4×1).|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Kevin Davis of New Release Tuesday, lead singer Bart Millard said the idea behind the song {{was related to the}} theme of the album The Generous Mr. Lovewell. Millard stated, [...] "The entire album deals with three main aspects of love. The theme of the record is to 'love well' as Jesus commands us in the greatest commandment. There are songs about inward love such <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> song 'Beautiful.' There are songs based on 'we love because He first loved us,' which is the basis of this first single, 'All of Creation'." [...] Millard also said, [...] "I set out to write a song that was confessional and refers to the birth, death and resurrection of Jesus in each verse. It was my intent to mention every stage of Christ’s condescension and atoning sacrifice throughout the song." ...|$|E
500|$|Because {{he began}} as a writer of short stories, Baker {{believes}} Hemingway learned to [...] "get the most from the least, how to prune language, how to multiply intensities and how to tell {{nothing but the truth}} in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth." [...] Hemingway called his style the Iceberg Theory: the facts float above water; the supporting structure and symbolism operate out of sight. The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the [...] "theory of omission". Hemingway believed the writer could describe one thing (such as Nick Adams fishing in [...] "The Big Two-Hearted River") though an entirely different thing occurs below the surface (Nick Adams concentrating on fishing {{to the extent that he}} does not have to think about anything else). [...] Paul Smith writes that Hemingway's first stories, collected <b>as</b> <b>In</b> <b>Our</b> Time, showed he was still experimenting with his writing style. He avoided complicated syntax. About 70 percent of the sentences are simple sentences—a childlike syntax without subordination.|$|E

2500|$|If {{there are}} only two CMGs in the cluster, <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> first example, then anti-parallel {{alignment}} will inevitably occur if the total stored angular momentum reaches zero. [...] The remedy is to keep it away from zero, possibly by using RCS firings. [...] This is not very satisfactory, and in practice all spacecraft using CMGs are fitted with at least three. [...] However it sometimes happens that after malfunctions a cluster is left with only two working CMGs, and the control program must {{be able to deal with}} this situation.|$|E

In the same interview, Stephen Fry noted that just as Harry met Malfoy, he found out that there is also racism in the wizarding world and that many characters in power can be [...] "as nasty and corrupt <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> world". Fry also noted that while [...] "Malfoy, Goyle and Crabbe are almost irredeemably bad", Malfoy, unlike his companions, [...] "is reasonably stylish". IGN listed Malfoy as their ninth top Harry Potter character.|$|E

2500|$|From the {{earliest}} days of Zionist settlement, Jewish immigrants wrote popular folk music. At first, songs were based on borrowed melodies from German, Russian, or traditional Jewish folk music with new lyrics written in Hebrew. Starting in the early 1920s, however, Jewish settlers made a conscious effort to create a new Hebrew style of music, a style that would tie them to their earliest Hebrew origins and that would differentiate them from the style of the Jewish diaspora of Eastern Europe, which they viewed as weak. This new style borrowed elements from Arabic and, to a lesser extent, traditional Yemenite and eastern Jewish styles: the songs were often homophonic (that is, without clear harmonic character), modal, and limited in range. [...] "The huge change in our lives demands new modes of expression," [...] wrote composer and music critic Menashe Ravina in 1943. [...] "... and, just <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> language we returned to our historical past, so has our ear turned to the music of the east ... as an expression of our innermost feelings." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sussex lawyer John Baker, {{a regular}} spectator at Georgian matches, {{described}} {{some of them}} in his diary. One is the All-England v Hampshire game in July 1772 which Baker attended with his parson friend, John Woodward. He writes that Hambledon was already batting when they arrived. It was a cheerful scene and [...] "the Basin on Merrow Down" [...] was ringed by a big crowd of spectators, most of them standing. Indeed, contemporary paintings of matches show no sign of seating accommodation for the ordinary folk. The local publicans were doing good business in their booths, some of them rented by the local nobility and thus the equivalent of the present-day sponsors’ tents or boxes. <b>As</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> own times, the occupants were often more interested in the food and drink than in the cricket. Guildford had fixed up a small grandstand [...] "with benches above one another over his booth below", but it was already full. Baker then talks about [...] "finding a small booth where we had a good cold dinner and good cider and ale". He says this was better and cheaper than the one they had on the following day in the White Hart booth.|$|E

President Nazarbayev and Afghan President Khamid Karzai signed an {{agreement}} on Treaty on Foundations of Relations and Cooperation earlier that day in Astana. The meeting was Karzai's first official visit to Kazakhstan. Nazarbayev told {{a news conference in}} Astana, [...] "Kazakhstan is absolutely interested in developing trade, economic and political relations with Afghanistan, as well <b>as</b> <b>in</b> <b>our</b> joint fight against terrorism and drug trafficking." [...] He continued by saying the entire world was eager to see peace and economic restoration in Afghanistan, and [...] "we are in this coalition. We are grateful to President Karzai for inviting Kazakh bankers and businesspeople to come and work in Afghanistan. Today's visit of the Afghan President is historic, because we meet {{here for the first time}} since the statehood of Afghanistan has been restored and the documents we signed are a good foundation for further cooperation." [...] The President continued by offering to provide Kazakh experts [...] "ready to work in Afghanistan in geology, building roads and installations, helping with medical professional, and continue to assist in any way we can, because we are interested in stability in Afghanistan. We want to trade and to use Afghan territory to build links to the south." [...] Karzai said, [...] "I believe Kazakhstan is an example of a country that was given an opportunity and used it. We intend to continue working with Kazakhstan to develop transit potential and bilateral trade." ...|$|E
