40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this article is to show how one can {{integrate}} statistical evidence from <b>attribute</b> <b>sampling</b> with non-statistical evidence within the Dempster-Shafer belief function framework. In particular, the article shows: (1) how to determine the sample size in <b>attribute</b> <b>sampling</b> to obtain a desired level of belief that the true attribute occurrence rate of the population lies in a given interval; (2) what level of belief is obtained for a specified interval given the sample result; and (3) how to integrate non-statistical evidence with the statistical evidence arising from the <b>attribute</b> <b>sampling.</b> These issues are important to the auditor and therefore we use auditing examples to illustrate the process. As intuitively expected, we find that the sample size increases as the desired level of belief in the interval increases. In evaluating the sample results, we again find results that are intuitively appealing. For example, provided the sample occurrence rate falls in the interval B for a given number of occurrences of the attribute, we find that the belief in B, Bel(B), increases as the sample size increases. However, if the sample occurrence rate falls outside of the interval then Bel(B) is zero. Note that, in general, both Bel(B) and Bel(notB) are zero when the sample occurrence rate falls at the end points of the interval. These results extend similar results already available for variables sampling. However, the auditor faces an additiona...|$|E

30|$|To {{achieve the}} high quality of the product, an {{inspection}} of the product from raw material to the final product {{is an essential part}} of the manufacturing process. The inspection of a lot of the product through the sampling plan ensures not accepting the bad lot or rejecting a good lot of the product. For the final submitted lot of the product, the supplier is often interested to know the lot acceptance probability. In the traditional acceptance sampling plan, a random sample from a lot of the product is selected and inspected for the purpose of the lot sentencing. A lot of the product is either rejected or accepted on the basis of sample information. The decision of acceptance or rejection is made under the assumption that there is no indeterminate in the data.

The model involves a two-stage decision: (1) determining the optimal sample size, and (2) after obtaining sampling information, taking an action that is between no more inspection and 100 percent inspection. The model assumes that the quality characteristic of the key component is exponentially distributed with an unknown mean. Using gamma distribution as the conjugate prior, a closed form decision criterion for the second stage can be derived, and the computational complexity will be greatly reduced. The <b>attribute</b> <b>sampling</b> model under the same probability distribution and cost structure is also derived and analyzed.

40|$|HYPERSAMP is a {{demonstration}} of an <b>attribute</b> <b>sampling</b> system developed to determine the minimum sample size required for any preselected value for consumer's risk and fraction of nonconforming. This statistical method {{can be used in}} place of MIL-STD- 105 E sampling plans when a minimum sample size is desirable, such as when tests are destructive or expensive. HYPERSAMP utilizes the Hypergeometric Distribution and can be used for any fraction nonconforming. The program employs an iterative technique that circumvents the obstacle presented by the factorial of a non-whole number. HYPERSAMP provides the required Hypergeometric sample size for any equivalent real number of nonconformances in the lot or batch under evaluation. Many currently used sampling systems, such as the MIL-STD- 105 E, utilize the Binomial or the Poisson equations as an estimate of the Hypergeometric when performing inspection by attributes. However, this is primarily because of the difficulty in calculation of the factorials required by the Hypergeometric. Sampling plans based on the Binomial or Poisson equations will result in the maximum sample size possible with the Hypergeometric. The difference in the sample sizes between the Poisson or Binomial and the Hypergeometric can be significant. For example, a lot size of 400 devices with an error rate of 1. 0 % and a confidence of 99 % would require a sample size of 400 (all units would need to be inspected) for the Binomial sampling plan and only 273 for a Hypergeometric sampling plan. The Hypergeometric results in a savings of 127 units, a significant reduction in the required sample size. HYPERSAMP is {{a demonstration}} program and is limited to sampling plans with zero defectives in the sample (acceptance number of zero). Since it is only a demonstration program, the sample size determination is limited to sample sizes of 1500 or less.

30|$|Nowadays, {{quality is}} one of the most {{important}} consumer decision factors. It has become one of the main strategies to increase the productivity of industries and service organizations. Therefore, the companies are trying to enhance the quality of their products by using various statistical techniques and tools. Acceptance sampling plans are important tools that have been widely used for lot sentencing in the industries. The inspection of the final product is always done on the basis of acceptance sampling scheme. There are two major types of acceptance sampling plans: <b>attribute</b> <b>sampling</b> plans and variable sampling plans. The major advantage of a variable sampling plan is that it has the same protection as an attribute acceptance sampling plan with a smaller sample size. When destructive testing is employed, variables sampling is particularly useful in reducing the costs of inspection. For more detail about the applications of the acceptance sampling plan can be found in Wu (2012), Liu et al. (2014), Kurniati et al. (2015), Yen and Chang (2009), and Sheu et al. (2014).|$|E

The MID regulation today prescribes conformance assessment of electrical energy meters based on ISO standards for <b>attribute</b> <b>sampling</b> where decision rules are purely statistical decision rules and economic consequences are not explicitly taken into account. The risk analysis we introduce calculates the risks involved for erroneous decisions, either rejecting a conforming batch of meters (the producer risk) or accepting a non-conforming batch (the consumer risk). The consumer risk is sensitive to the period until the next test which becomes a quality characteristic of each batch. This time interval can be optimized by balancing the consumer risk against the producer risk. When the quality drops, the period until the next test will need to become shorter. But at a certain level of quality, the energy net supplier would rather replace the complete batch, than continue testing at such short intervals...|$|E

A computer program is presented which will provide minimum sample size for single sample <b>attribute</b> <b>sampling</b> plans.

The search is conducted over an interval, for the variable representing the acceptance number, known to contain the optimal solution.

It is shown how an initial feasible solution could provide the values needed to establish the search intervals. An algorithm already developed to produce integral solutions is used to determine the initial feasible solution. The algorithm developed in this paper is tested to determine its performance. The testing is to illustrate the accuracy of the proposed method. Use of the program also highlights accuracy problems existing with the previous minimum sample size method.

40|$|AbstractThe {{microbiological}} criteria {{established in the}} EC 2073 / 2005 for Cronobacter in powder infant formula (PIF) are based on two-class <b>attribute</b> <b>sampling</b> plans, where the sample results are qualitative (sample indicates presence or absence) and the lot is rejected if any sample is positive. The performance of a sampling plan is revealed by its Operating Characteristic (OC) curve which plots the probability of acceptance against possible values of proportion defective. The objective {{of this study is}} to generate several OC curves for single, double and multiple sampling plans assuming different statistical distributions of Cronobacter in PIF in order to determine and compare the probabilities of rejecting/accepting the lot and the respective level of contamination. In this study, the microbial distribution of Cronobacter in the PIF is described by assuming to be Poisson-lognormal (PLN), Poisson-gamma (PG), Zero- inflated Poisson-lognormal (ZIPLN) and Zero-inflated Poisson-gamma (ZIPG). For each distribution the proportion defective of the population is estimated in order to determine the probability of acceptance for single, double and multiple sampling plans. Furthermore, the effect of clustering of the bacteria on the probability of acceptance of the lot was assessed through a Poisson-logarithmic (PLOG) and a PLogn distribution. Probabilities of accepting the lot at a given level of contamination change drastically according to the statistical distribution assumed and by changing the values of its own parameters. In addition, a procedure of multiple sampling plan based on resampling reveals that the producer's risk (α risk) can be reduced without affecting the consumer's risk (β risk) ...|$|E
