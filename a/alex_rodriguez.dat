He {{was also the}} Brewers' all-time leader in career batting average (.312), slugging percentage, and OPS (.933), and fourth in on-base percentage (.371).|$|E
5|$|At 6ft 4 in, 225lb (1.93m, 102kg), Ripken was a {{departure}} from the prototypical shortstop of the time—small, fleet-of-foot players who played a defensively difficult position but often did not post the home run and batting average totals that an outfielder might. Power hitting shortstops such as <b>Alex</b> <b>Rodriguez,</b> Nomar Garciaparra and Miguel Tejada are often seen by fans to be part of Ripken's legacy.|$|E
5|$|On June 3, 2017, Pujols {{became the}} ninth player in Major League history to hit at least 600 home runs {{when he hit}} a grand slam against the Minnesota Twins. He is the fourth-youngest player to achieve the feat (behind <b>Alex</b> <b>Rodriguez,</b> Babe Ruth, and Hank Aaron), {{and the first to}} hit a grand slam for his 600th home run.|$|E
50|$|Venters {{struggled}} {{throughout the}} first half of the 2012 season. During a game against the New York Yankees on June 12, 2012, he allowed <b>Alex</b> <b>Rodriguez's</b> 23rd career grand slam.|$|R
50|$|The Yankees {{tied the}} game {{in the top of the}} fourth inning, as Curtis Granderson doubled, {{advanced}} to third base on Mark Teixeira's single, then scored on <b>Alex</b> <b>Rodriguez's</b> sacrifice fly.|$|R
25|$|In November 2007, the MLB Players' Union raised {{concerns}} that owners collusively shared information about free agents and possibly conspired {{to keep the}} final price of <b>Alex</b> <b>Rodriguez's</b> new free agent contract down.|$|R
5|$|On September 16, Braun hit his 200th career {{home run}} in his 867th game, against the New York Mets, faster than all but four active players in the Majors (Ryan Howard, Albert Pujols, Adam Dunn, and <b>Alex</b> <b>Rodriguez).</b> In his {{following}} at bat, Braun hit another home run, his 40th of the year, {{the first time he}} had reached the 40-home-run mark.|$|E
5|$|After the season, Kershaw and the Dodgers {{agreed on}} a seven-year, $215 million, {{contract}} extension. The deal was the richest in MLB history for a pitcher, eclipsing the seven-year, $180 million, contract signed by Justin Verlander the previous year. The average annual value of $30.7 million was also the largest ever for a baseball player, beating the $28 million Roger Clemens received in 2007 and the 10-year, $275 million contract that <b>Alex</b> <b>Rodriguez</b> signed that same year.|$|E
5|$|Bonds is {{the lone}} {{member of the}} 500–500 club, which means he has hit at least 500 home runs (762) and stolen at least 500 bases (514). He {{is also one of}} only four {{baseball}} players all-time to be in the 40–40 club (1996), which means he hit 40 home runs (42) and stole 40 bases (40) in the same season; the other members are José Canseco, <b>Alex</b> <b>Rodriguez,</b> and Alfonso Soriano.|$|E
5000|$|High fly ball, deep right, Martinez's back, track, WALL! SEE YA!! He {{did it in}} style! He joins 3000th hit {{club with}} a home run! <b>Alex</b> <b>Rodriguez's</b> 3000th hit off of Tigers' pitcher Justin Verlander on June 19, 2015 ...|$|R

5|$|Fox {{broadcast}} the {{series in the}} United States, with play-by-play announcer Joe Buck calling the action along with color analysts Harold Reynolds and Tom Verducci and field reporters Ken Rosenthal and Erin Andrews. The pregame and postgame show featured host Kevin Burkhardt with analysts Frank Thomas, Raul Ibanez, Pete Rose, and <b>Alex</b> <b>Rodriguez.</b> Fox Deportes offered a Spanish telecast of the series in the United States. The MLB International feed featured Matt Vasgersian and John Smoltz with play-by-play and analysis, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Hank Greenberg, Stan Musial, <b>Alex</b> <b>Rodriguez,</b> and Robin Yount {{have won}} at {{different}} positions, while Rodriguez {{is the only}} player who has won the award with two different teams at two different positions. Barry Bonds has won the most often(seven times) and the most consecutively(2001–04). Jimmie Foxx was {{the first player to}} win multiple times; 9players have won three times, and 19 have won twice. Frank Robinson is the only player to win the award in both the American and National Leagues.|$|E
5|$|The first {{winners of}} the award were Manny Ramirez and Sammy Sosa in 1999, while the most recent winners are Jose Altuve and Giancarlo Stanton. <b>Alex</b> <b>Rodriguez</b> has won the award four times, {{the most of any}} player. The winner with the most hits is Todd Helton, who won as a Colorado Rockies in 2000. The winner with the most home runs is Barry Bonds from 2001, and Manny Ramírez in 1999 has the most RBIs.|$|E

500|$|The Red Sox went on {{to sweep}} the Colorado Rockies in the World Series. Series MVP Mike Lowell remarks, upon {{receiving}} his trophy, that [...] "the Red Sox are expected to win." [...] Controversy erupted during the eighth inning of the final game when <b>Alex</b> <b>Rodriguez's</b> agent Scott Boras announced that Rodriguez had decided {{to opt out of}} his contract, in what was seen by many as an attempt by Boras to overshadow the series.|$|R
50|$|When the new Strat-O-Matic {{baseball}} cards are released {{each year on}} the last Friday in January—an event that hundreds of players commemorate by showing up in the cold at the company's headquarters—controversy soon follows over the deservedness of such statistics. One such instance occurred in January 2008 when a David Alan Tieche filibustered outside of the Glen Head headquarters for 42-hours in protest over <b>Alex</b> <b>Rodriguez's</b> card rankings being inflated due to steroid use.|$|R
5|$|With {{one year}} {{remaining}} until {{he would become}} eligible for free agency, Jeter signed a ten-year, $189million contract before the 2001 season to remain with the Yankees. <b>Alex</b> <b>Rodriguez</b> had signed a ten-year, $252million contract with the Texas Rangers earlier in the offseason, setting the market for Jeter's negotiations. Jeter became the second-highest-paid athlete across all team sports and auto racing, trailing only Rodriguez. The $18.9million average annual value of Jeter's contract was the third-highest in baseball, behind only Rodriguez ($25.2million) and Manny Ramirez ($20million).|$|E
5|$|On September 16, 2007, Thome {{joined the}} 500 home run club by hitting a walk-off home run against Los Angeles Angels pitcher Dustin Moseley. Thome became the 23rd major leaguer {{to reach the}} {{milestone}} and the third in the 2007 MLB season (the others were Frank Thomas and <b>Alex</b> <b>Rodriguez),</b> {{as well as the}} first ever to do it with a walk-off home run. Several family members including his father were on hand to witness the accomplishment, which occurred at a game during which the White Sox distributed free Thome bobbleheads to fans. Thome celebrated by pointing upward in homage to his late mother as he rounded the bases.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees scored {{first with}} an <b>Alex</b> <b>Rodriguez</b> walk opening {{the bottom of}} the second inning {{followed}} by a two-run home run by designated hitter Hideki Matsui. The Phillies quickly responded with a triple by Carlos Ruiz who then scored on a sacrifice fly from Jimmy Rollins {{in the top of the}} third. Matsui answered back, adding to the Yankees lead again with a single with the bases loaded in {{the bottom of the}} third, scoring Derek Jeter and Johnny Damon. Damon, injured running the bases while scoring, was replaced defensively in the top of the fourth by Jerry Hairston, Jr.|$|E
5000|$|The Red Sox went on {{to sweep}} the Colorado Rockies in the World Series. Series MVP Mike Lowell remarks, upon {{receiving}} his trophy, that [...] "the Red Sox are expected to win."

50|$|Gardner {{started the}} 2011 season hitting leadoff for the Yankees. He {{struggled}} {{in that role}} and was demoted to the bottom third of the order. However, after Jeter {{was put on the}} disabled list for a calf injury, Gardner was returned {{to the top of the}} order, alternating with Nick Swisher. After Jeter's return and <b>Alex</b> <b>Rodriguez's</b> stint on the DL for knee surgery, Gardner and Jeter periodically shared the top of the order, with Gardner at lead-off and Jeter batting second.|$|R
50|$|On March 22, Marcum {{was named}} the Opening Day starter for the 2010 season, {{succeeding}} Roy Halladay for that role, who had seven consecutive opening day starts for the team from 2003 to 2009. On May 2, Marcum got his first win against the Oakland Athletics, {{it was his first}} win since September 11, 2008 before going through Tommy John surgery. On August 4, 2010, Marcum gave up <b>Alex</b> <b>Rodriguez's</b> 600th career home run. Marcum ended the season with a 13-8 win-loss record, 3.64 ERA, and 165 strikeouts in 195 innings pitched.|$|R
5|$|The {{start of}} the game was {{postponed}} 80 minutes due to a rain delay, pushing the start time to 9:17p.m. The cast of the television series Glee (with Amber Riley singing lead) performed the national anthem prior to the game {{as part of a}} ceremony featuring a large American flag and several members of the armed services. The Phillies scored first with Jayson Werth's lead-off solo home run, which was followed by a bases-loaded walk and a sacrifice fly to make the score 3–0 {{in the bottom of the}} second inning. Following Mark Teixeira's walk in the top of the fourth inning, <b>Alex</b> <b>Rodriguez</b> hit a deep ball down the right field line. It was originally ruled a double and Teixeira held at third base. The play was reviewed using MLB instant replay, which revealed that the ball had struck a camera sticking over the top of the wall, and the ball was ruled a two-run home run, giving Rodriguez his first World Series hit. This was the first home run reviewed by instant replay in postseason play. Specifically, the ball hit a camera owned by Fox and MLB which extended slightly over the right field wall. The camera was moved back for Game4 such that its lens was in line with the wall. Coincidentally, <b>Alex</b> <b>Rodriguez</b> also had the first regular season home run reviewed by replay.|$|E
5|$|Thome hit 47 {{home runs}} {{in his first season}} with the Phillies, {{finishing}} one behind Mike Schmidt's single-season team record of 48 in 1980, and tied with <b>Alex</b> <b>Rodriguez</b> for the MLB lead in 2003. On June 14, 2004 at Citizens Bank Park, Thome hit his 400th career home run, surpassing Al Kaline for 37th on the all-time home run list. He ended the 2004 Phillies season with 42 home runs. In 2004, Thome won the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award, which is given to players who best exemplify Gehrig's character and integrity {{both on and off the}} field.|$|E
5|$|Among shortstops, Barry Larkin is {{the leader}} in Silver Slugger Awards, with nine wins between 1988 and 1999, {{including}} five consecutive awards (1988–1992). Larkin is fourth all-time in Silver Slugger wins among all positions, behind outfielder Barry Bonds, catcher Mike Piazza and third baseman <b>Alex</b> <b>Rodriguez,</b> who won his first seven awards at shortstop before a position change. Hall of Famer Cal Ripken, Jr. won eight Silver Sluggers as a shortstop from 1983 to 1993. Other multiple awardees include three-time winners Alan Trammell (1987–1988, 1990), Derek Jeter (2006–2008) and Édgar Rentería (2000; 2002–2003), along with two-time champions Troy Tulowitzki (2010–2011), Hanley Ramírez (2008–2009), Miguel Tejada (2004–2005), Robin Yount (1980, 1982), Hubie Brooks (1985–1986), Dave Concepción (1981–1982), Garry Templeton (1980, 1984) and Xander Bogaerts (2015-2016).|$|E
5000|$|Despite the evidence, though, {{most people}} in {{baseball}} steadfastly cling {{to the idea of}} the clutch hitter. In an interview with Sports Illustrated, Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter criticized analysts who deny clutch hitting as a skill, stating: [...] "You can take those stat guys and throw them out the window." [...] While many do not believe clutch hitting actually exists, supporters of it cite <b>Alex</b> <b>Rodriguez's</b> perceived struggles in clutch situations as proof that even great statistical hitters like A-Rod (who was the 2003, 2005, and 2007 AL MVP) are different players in the clutch.|$|R
25|$|On January 24, 2012, Boras {{secured a}} nine-year, $214 million {{contract}} for Prince Fielder with the Detroit Tigers, the fourth-largest contract ever for a baseball player. The deal surprised {{many in the}} industry with its length, its size, and {{the identity of the}} signing team, as it appeared that Boras might be boxed in by a lukewarm market for Fielder. With the Fielder deal, Boras became responsible for three of the four $200 million-plus deals {{in the history of the}} game (the other two being <b>Alex</b> <b>Rodriguez's</b> deals with the Texas Rangers and New York Yankees).|$|R
50|$|Some {{have pointed}} out that only the third-base umpire, Australian Neil Poulton, was not from the U.S., as well as the fact that it {{appeared}} that the home plate umpire was persuaded to make the call by USA manager Buck Martinez. Some argued that the call did not end the game, only the inning, and some will argue that <b>Alex</b> <b>Rodriguez's</b> single in the ninth inning would have scored two runs in any case (had the next run mattered). However, others countered that had Japan scored that run by Nishioka, they would have deployed their closer Akinori Otsuka to pitch the ninth inning.|$|R
