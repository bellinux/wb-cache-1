5|$|SCSFLS afflicts 5 out {{of every}} 100,000 people. On average, the {{condition}} is developed {{at the age of}} 42, and women are twice <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> men to develop the condition. Some people with SCSFLS chronically leak cerebrospinal fluid despite repeated attempts at patching, leading to long-term disability due to pain. SCSFLS was first described by German neurologist Georg Schaltenbrand in 1938 and by American physician Henry Woltman of the Mayo Clinic in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{combined}} {{data from}} SAMHSA's 2004–2005 National Surveys on Drug Use & Health, {{the rate of}} past-year alcohol dependence or abuse among persons aged 12 or older varied by level of alcohol use: 44.7% of past month heavy drinkers, 18.5% binge drinkers, 3.8% past month non-binge drinkers, and 1.3% {{of those who did}} not drink alcohol in the past month met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year. Males had higher rates than females for all measures of drinking in the past month: any alcohol use (57.5% vs. 45%), binge drinking (30.8% vs. 15.1%), and heavy alcohol use (10.5% vs. 3.3%), and males were twice <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> females to have met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year (10.5% vs. 5.1%).|$|E
5|$|Further complicating {{this picture}} are {{repetition}} patterns. There {{are two types}} of repetition in Rapanui words: double syllables within roots, as in mamari, and grammatical reduplication of disyllables, as seen in rongorongo. In the Rapanui lexicon, double syllables as in mamari are 50% more likely than chance can explain. However, in the rongorongo texts, analogous double AA glyphs are only 8% more likely than chance. Similarly, in the Rapanui lexicon reduplicated disyllables such as rongorongo are seven times as common as chance, constituting a quarter of the vocabulary, whereas, in rongorongo texts, ABAB sequences are only twice <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> chance, and 10% of the vocabulary. If rongorongo is a phonetic script, therefore, this discrepancy needs to be explained. Pozdniakov suggests that perhaps there was a 'reduplicator' glyph, or that modifications of glyphs, such as facing heads to the left rather than to the right, may have indicated repetition.|$|E

5|$|In the 20th century, Kurt Atterberg's Stormen premiered in 1948 and Frank Martin's Der Sturm in 1955. Michael Tippett's 1971 opera The Knot Garden {{contains}} various {{allusions to}} The Tempest. In Act 3, a psychoanalyst, Mangus, {{pretends to be}} Prospero and uses situations from Shakespeare's play in his therapy sessions. John Eaton, in 1985, produced a fusion of live jazz with pre-recorded electronic music, with a libretto by Andrew Porter. Michael Nyman's 1991 opera Noises, Sounds & Sweet Airs was first performed as an opera-ballet by Karine Saporta. This opera is unique in that the three vocalists, a soprano, contralto, and tenor, are voices rather than individual characters, with the tenor just <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> the soprano to sing Miranda, or all three sing as one character.|$|E
5|$|Rotavirus A, which {{accounts}} for more than 90% of rotavirus gastroenteritis in humans, is endemic worldwide. Each year rotavirus causes millions of cases of diarrhoea in developing countries, almost 2million of which result in hospitalisation. In 2013, an estimated 215,000 children younger than five died from rotavirus, 90 percent of whom were in developing countries. Almost every child has been infected with rotavirus by age five. Rotavirus is the leading single cause of severe diarrhoea among infants and children, is responsible for {{about a third of the}} cases requiring hospitalisation, and causes 37% of deaths attributable to diarrhoea and 5% of all deaths in children younger than five. Boys are twice <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> girls to be admitted to hospital for rotavirus.|$|E
5|$|The {{probability}} {{of the creation}} of strangelets decreases at higher energies. As the LHC operates at higher energies than the RHIC or the heavy ion programs of the 1980s and 1990s, the LHC is less likely to produce strangelets than its predecessors. Furthermore, models indicate that strangelets are only stable or long-lived at low temperatures. Strangelets are bound at low energies (in the range of 1–10MeV), while the collisions in the LHC release energies in the range of 7–14TeV. Thermodynamics very strongly disfavors the formation of a cold condensate that is an order of magnitude cooler than the surrounding medium. As an example, it is about <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> producing an icecube in a furnace.|$|E

25|$|Social class {{differences}} in educational achievement {{are much more}} marked in Germany's big cities {{than they are in}} the rural parts of Germany.

25|$|The {{influence}} of social class on educational achievement {{is much greater}} in western Germany {{than it is in}} eastern Germany (former GDR). An analysis of PISA data on Gymnasium pupils for the year 2000 showed that, while in western Germany the child of an academic was 7.26 times <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> that of a skilled worker to attend, in eastern Germany a child from an academic family was only 2.78 times <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> <b>as</b> a working class child to attend. The reasons for this were unclear. Some people believed that immigrants were responsible, because more uneducated immigrant families lived in western than in eastern Germany. This assumption however could not be confirmed. The difference between east and west was even stronger when only ethnic German children were studied.|$|E
