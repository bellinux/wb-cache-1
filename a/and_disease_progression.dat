2500|$|These tests {{suggest the}} Staphylococcus strains use staphyloxanthin as a defence against the normal human immune system. [...] Drugs {{designed}} to inhibit {{the production of}} staphyloxanthin may weaken the bacterium and renew its susceptibility to antibiotics. [...] In fact, because of similarities in the pathways for biosynthesis of staphyloxanthin and human cholesterol, a drug developed {{in the context of}} cholesterol-lowering therapy was shown to block S. aureus pigmentation <b>and</b> <b>disease</b> <b>progression</b> in a mouse infection model.|$|E
2500|$|Molecular {{pathology}} {{is focused}} upon {{the study and}} diagnosis of disease through the examination of molecules within organs, tissues or bodily fluids. [...] Molecular pathology is multidisciplinary by nature and shares some aspects of practice with both anatomic pathology and clinical pathology, molecular biology, biochemistry, proteomics and genetics. [...] It is often applied in a context that is as much scientific as directly medical and encompasses the development of molecular and genetic approaches to the diagnosis and classification of human diseases, the design and validation of predictive biomarkers for treatment response <b>and</b> <b>disease</b> <b>progression,</b> and the susceptibility of individuals of different genetic constitution to particular disorders. [...] The crossover between molecular pathology and epidemiology is represented by a related field [...] "molecular pathological epidemiology".|$|E

40|$|Abnormal {{repeat length}} has been {{associated}} with an earlier age of onset <b>and</b> more severe <b>disease</b> <b>progression</b> in the rare neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia 17 (SCA 17). To determine whether specific structural brain degeneration <b>and</b> rate of <b>disease</b> <b>progression</b> in SCA 17 might be associated with the CAG repeat size, observer-independent voxel-based morphometry was applied to high-resolution magnetic resonance images of 16 patients with SCA 17 and 16 age-matched healthy controls. The main finding contrasting SCA 17 patients with healthy controls demonstrated atrophy in the cerebellum bilaterally. Multiple regression analyses with available genetic data and also post-hoc correlations revealed an inverse relationship again with cerebellar atrophy. Moreover, we found an inverse relationship between the CAG repeat length <b>and</b> rate of <b>disease</b> <b>progression.</b> Our results highlight the fundamental role of the cerebellum in this neurodegenerative <b>disease</b> <b>and</b> support the genotype-phenotype relationship in SCA 17 patients.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. The {{biological}} {{correlates of}} protection against HIV infection remain poorly characterized, hindering {{the development of}} an effective prevention strategy. Studies of individuals who resist HIV infection or progress more slowly after being infected are important for the conception of appropriate approaches for mimicking the effective responses against HIV infection or progression. The role of immune activation and chronic inflammation in the modulation of HIV acquisition risk and/or rate of HIV <b>disease</b> <b>progression</b> has been proposed {{as one of the most}} important mechanisms determining risk and pathogenesis but is not fully understood.

50|$|Like RCC, GIST {{does not}} {{generally}} respond to standard chemotherapy or radiation. Imatinib {{was the first}} cancer agent proven effective for metastatic GIST and represented a major development {{in the treatment of}} this rare but challenging disease. However, approximately 20% of patients do not respond to imatinib (early or primary resistance), and among those who do respond initially, 50% develop secondary imatinib resistance <b>and</b> <b>disease</b> <b>progression</b> within two years.

50|$|One of the {{long-term}} goals ChIP-on-chip was designed for {{is to establish a}} catalogue of (selected) organisms that lists all protein-DNA interactions under various physiological conditions.

50|$|Multiple {{factors have}} been shown to be {{significant}} in predicting the outcome and overall survival. Age greater than 60 at surgery, more overall disease burden (defined as a PCI greater than 15), complete cytoreduction (no visible disease), and epitheliod subtype pathology have all been shown to be predictors of both mortality <b>and</b> <b>disease</b> <b>progression.</b> These known predictors notwithstanding, many patients with advanced peritoneal mesothelioma are still surgical candidates, and even patients with the highest possible score on the peritoneal carcinomatosis index (39) can be completely reduced to a PCI of 0 with adequate surgery.|$|E
50|$|WNT16B {{expression}} is regulated by nuclear factor of κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells 1 (NF-κB) after DNA damage, as can occur to normal cels during radiation or chemotherapy. Subsequently WNT16B signals in a paracrine manner {{to activate the}} Wnt expression program in tumor cells. The expression of WNT16B in the tumor microenvironment attenuates the effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy in vivo, promoting tumor cell survival <b>and</b> <b>disease</b> <b>progression.</b> This implies a mechanism by which cycles of genotoxic therapy might enhance subsequent treatment resistance in the tumor microenvironment.|$|E
