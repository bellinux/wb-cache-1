5|$|Another {{classification}} scheme considers genetic and demographic factors.

40|$|We {{studied the}} {{accuracy}} of reported <b>family</b> <b>histories</b> of essential tremor (ET) by questioning the patients in our clinic and subsequently by mail and phone. For individuals who continued to report <b>a</b> negative <b>family</b> <b>history,</b> we mailed <b>a</b> screening questionnaire to their first-degree relatives to further ascertain the presence of ET. On initial assessment, 67. 7 % of patients reported <b>a</b> positive <b>family</b> <b>history</b> of ET, but following all assessments, 96. 0 % of patients had <b>a</b> positive <b>family</b> <b>history.</b> We conclude that <b>a</b> negative <b>family</b> <b>history</b> of ET is often inaccurate, and that ET is primarily a hereditary disease.

5|$|Until the {{discovery}} of a genetic test, statistics could only include clinical diagnosis based on physical symptoms and <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>history</b> of HD, excluding those who died of other causes before diagnosis.

5|$|Spontaneous pneumothoraces {{are divided}} into two types: primary, which occurs {{in the absence of}} known lung disease, and secondary, which occurs in someone with {{underlying}} lung disease.

Smoking either cannabis or tobacco increases the risk. The various suspected underlying mechanisms are discussed below.|$|E
5|$|The risk of VTE is {{increased}} in pregnancy by {{about five times}} because of a more hypercoagulable state, a likely adaptation against fatal postpartum hemorrhage. Additionally, pregnant women with genetic risk factors are subject to a roughly three to 30 times increased risk for VTE. Preventative treatments for pregnancy-related VTE in hypercoagulable women were suggested by the ACCP. Homozygous carriers of factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A with <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>history</b> of VTE were suggested for antepartum LMWH and either LMWH or a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for the six weeks following childbirth. Those with another thrombophilia and <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>history</b> but no previous VTE were suggested for watchful waiting during pregnancy and LMWH or—for those without protein C or S deficiency—a VKA. Homozygous carriers of factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A with no personal or family history of VTE were suggested for watchful waiting during pregnancy and LMWH or a VKA for six weeks after childbirth. Those with another thrombophilia but no family or personal history of VTE were suggested for watchful waiting only. Warfarin, a common VKA, can cause harm to the fetus and is not used for VTE prevention during pregnancy.|$|E

5|$|Women with <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>history</b> of {{endometrial cancer}} are at higher risk. Two genes most {{commonly}} associated with some other women's cancers, BRCA1 and BRCA2, do not cause endometrial cancer. There is an apparent link with these genes but it is attributable {{to the use of}} tamoxifen, a drug that itself can cause endometrial cancer, in breast and ovarian cancers. The inherited genetic condition Cowden syndrome can also cause endometrial cancer. Women with this disorder have a 5–10%lifetime risk of developing endometrial cancer, compared to the 2–3%risk for unaffected women.|$|E
5|$|A complex {{mixture of}} genetic and {{environmental}} factors influences {{the risk of the}} development of alcoholism. Genes that influence the metabolism of alcohol also influence the risk of alcoholism, and may be indicated by <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>history</b> of alcoholism. One paper has found that alcohol use at an early age may influence the expression of genes which increase the risk of alcohol dependence. Individuals who have a genetic disposition to alcoholism {{are also more likely to}} begin drinking at an earlier age than average. Also, a younger age of onset of drinking is associated with an increased risk of the development of alcoholism, and about 40 percent of alcoholics will drink excessively by their late adolescence. It is not entirely clear whether this association is causal, and some researchers have been known to disagree with this view.|$|E
5|$|About 99% of HD diagnoses {{based on}} the typical {{symptoms}} and <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>history</b> of the disease are confirmed by genetic testing to have the expanded trinucleotide repeat that causes HD. Most of the remaining are called HD-like (HDL) syndromes. The cause of most HDL diseases is unknown, but those with known causes are due to mutations in the prion protein gene (HDL1), the junctophilin 3 gene (HDL2), a recessively inherited unknown gene (HDL3—only found in two families and poorly understood), and the gene encoding the TATA box-binding protein (SCA17, sometimes called HDL4). Other autosomal dominant diseases that can be misdiagnosed as HD are dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy and neuroferritinopathy. There are also autosomal recessive disorders that resemble sporadic cases of HD. These include chorea acanthocytosis and pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration. One X-linked disorder of this type is McLeod syndrome.|$|E

5|$|Epilepsy cannot {{usually be}} cured, but {{medication}} can control seizures effectively in about 70% of cases. Of those with generalized seizures, more than 80% can be well controlled with medications {{while this is}} true in only 50% of people with focal seizures. One predictor of long-term outcome {{is the number of}} seizures that occur in the first six months. Other factors increasing the risk of a poor outcome include little response to the initial treatment, generalized seizures, <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>history</b> of epilepsy, psychiatric problems, and waves on the EEG representing generalized epileptiform activity. In the developing world, 75% of people are either untreated or not appropriately treated. In Africa, 90% do not get treatment. This is partly related to appropriate medications not being available or being too expensive.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{requirement}} that other comorbid conditions (such as ADHD or OCD) be present, {{but if a}} physician believes {{that there may be}} another condition present that could explain tics, tests may be ordered as necessary to rule out that condition. An example of this is when diagnostic confusion between tics and seizure activity exists, which would call for an EEG, or if there are symptoms that indicate an MRI to rule out brain abnormalities. TSH levels can be measured to rule out hypothyroidism, which can be a cause of tics. Brain imaging studies are not usually warranted. In teenagers and adults presenting with a sudden onset of tics and other behavioral symptoms, a urine drug screen for cocaine and stimulants might be necessary. If <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>history</b> of liver disease is present, serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels can rule out Wilson's disease. Most cases are diagnosed by merely observing a history of tics.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: in {{patients}} with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), the propensity towards atherosclerosis may vary considerably. In the general population, <b>a</b> positive <b>family</b> <b>history</b> is {{associated with an increased}} risk for cardiovascular events. Since endothelial dysfunction is predictive for future cardiovascular events, we evaluated whether FH-children with <b>a</b> positive <b>family</b> <b>history</b> of premature cardiovascular disease have more pronounced endothelial dysfunction compared to children with <b>a</b> negative <b>family</b> <b>history.</b> Study design: 50 FH children, 10 - 18 years, participated in this Study. Thirty-one children had <b>a</b> positive <b>family</b> <b>history</b> for cardiovascular events (fh(+)) and 19 children had no events in the family (fh(-)). Nineteen matched siblings participated as controls. Endothelial function was assessed by testing the flow mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery. Results: baseline characteristics were comparable for fh(+), fh(-) and controls. Lipid levels were significantly higher in FH children. In FH, FMD was impaired compared to controls (11. 7 +/- 4. 4 vs. 15. 6 +/- 6. 8 %, P < 0. 03). In addition, FMD was significantly lower in fh(+) compared to fh(-) (10. 7 +/- 9. 9 vs. 13. 3 +/- 4. 6 %, P < 0. 05). Conclusion: In FH-children, endothelial function is impaired compared to matched controls. This impairment is most pronounced in FH children with <b>a</b> positive <b>family</b> <b>history</b> of premature cardiovascular disease. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.
