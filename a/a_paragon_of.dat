5|$|During {{his life}} and those of his sons, Constantine was {{presented}} as <b>a</b> <b>paragon</b> <b>of</b> virtue. Pagans such as Praxagoras of Athens and Libanius showered him with praise. When {{the last of his}} sons died in 361, however, his nephew (and son-in-law) Julian the Apostate wrote the satire Symposium, or the Saturnalia, which denigrated Constantine, calling him inferior to the great pagan emperors, and given over to luxury and greed. Following Julian, Eunapius began—and Zosimus continued—a historiographic tradition that blamed Constantine for weakening the Empire through his indulgence to the Christians.|$|E

5|$|As {{with many}} of his novels, Balzac {{analyzes}} the influence of history and social status in La Cousine Bette. The book takes places between 1838 and 1846, when the reign of Louis-Philippe reflected and directed {{significant changes in the}} social structure. Balzac was a legitimist favoring the House of Bourbon, and idolized Napoleon Bonaparte as <b>a</b> <b>paragon</b> <b>of</b> effective absolutist power. Balzac felt that French society under the House of Orléans lacked strong leadership, and was fragmented by the demands of parliament. He also believed that Catholicism provided guidance for the nation, and that its absence heralded moral decay.|$|E
5|$|In Western European {{medieval and}} Renaissance {{versions}} of the legend, Troilus is the youngest of Priam's five legitimate sons by Hecuba. Despite his youth {{he is one of}} the main Trojan war leaders. He dies in battle at Achilles' hands. In a popular addition to the story, originating in the 12th century, Troilus falls in love with Cressida, whose father has defected to the Greeks. Cressida pledges her love to Troilus but she soon switches her affections to the Greek hero Diomedes when sent to her father in a hostage exchange. Chaucer and Shakespeare are among the authors who wrote works telling the story of Troilus and Cressida. Within the medieval tradition, Troilus was regarded as <b>a</b> <b>paragon</b> <b>of</b> the faithful courtly lover and also of the virtuous pagan knight. Once the custom of courtly love had faded, his fate was regarded less sympathetically.|$|E
5|$|In What Starts Wars: Intentional Delusions Stratton {{presented}} nations, themselves {{collections of}} people, as triggering war from several delusions. Three of those delusions held by citizens were {{that their own}} country was <b>a</b> <b>paragon</b> <b>of</b> peace, that its arms were only to defend the land, and that when it fought, it fought only for what was right. Blaming the enemy rounded out this list justifying war. Stratton believed and stated people could be freed of these delusions {{and that there was}} no will to war integral to human nature. He saw both the need for and the ways to eliminate war in individuals and in their ways, and not in abstract or innate traits. Florence Finch Kelly, reviewing the book for the New York Times, saw Stratton's placing of both the blame and the responsibility on persons, of identifying the roots of war in the psyches of the men and women his readers, as an action likely to discomfit those readers.|$|E

25|$|Naples {{was greatly}} {{respected}} by the Romans as <b>a</b> <b>paragon</b> <b>of</b> Hellenistic culture. During the Roman era, {{the people of}} Naples maintained their Greek language and customs, while the city was expanded with elegant Roman villas, aqueducts, and public baths. Landmarks such as the Temple of Dioscures were built, and many emperors chose to holiday in the city, including Claudius and Tiberius.

All of these economic changes encouraged suburbanization {{and the formation of}} a new generation of well-assimilated and educated middle-class workers. At the same time, suburbanization and urban decay highlighted differences between various social groups, leading to a renewal of racial tension. Boston, <b>a</b> <b>paragon</b> <b>of</b> the problems in Massachusetts cities, experienced numerous challenges that led to racial problems. The problems facing urban centers included declining population, middle-class flight, departure of industry, high unemployment, rising taxes, low property values, and competition among ethnic groups.|$|E

His travels and public preaching were instrumental in spreading the religion throughout Persia, allowing him to come into contact with many prominent clerics and government officials, including Bahá'u'lláh and Mohammad Shah Qajar. He is often mentioned in Bahá'í literature as <b>a</b> <b>paragon</b> <b>of</b> courage and spiritual excellence. He led the Bábí combatants at the Battle of Fort Shaykh Tabarsi, and was killed in that battle on February 2, 1849. Mullá Husayn is regarded as a significant martyr in Bábism and the Bahá'í Faith and accorded a high spiritual station in both religions as the first to believe in the Báb and a prominent participant in the perceived fulfillment of many elements of Islamic eschatology.|$|E
25|$|In service, the Airtrans {{system had}} a number of {{unexpected}} problems. The system was originally designed for typical Dallas weather, which rarely sees snow, and it was expected that the normal operations would keep the guideway clear when snow did fall. In operation, snow and ice proved to be a serious problem, but a detailed study on ways to keep the system clear demonstrated it would be less expensive to provide truck services during those rare periods. Additionally, maintaining the vehicles proved more difficult than expected, but DFW's transportation department kept updating the system, one piece at a time. Wiring and electronic components were moved inside the Airtrans cars; they had been exposed to weather under the cars. Circuit boards were replaced with microchips. After fifteen years of continual improvement, the system emerged as <b>a</b> <b>paragon</b> <b>of</b> reliability. At its peak in 1987, the system carried 23,000 passengers a day. In 1988, now operating 24 hours, the system achieved a 99.8% in-service record. In 1989 the vehicles were refurbished to improve maintenance and cleaning operations. When Airtrans made its debut, it used eight-track cartridges for its announcements; the audio system was later upgraded to a cassette system, and still later to a digital voice synthesizer.|$|E
500|$|In his {{lifetime}} and immediately following his death, Du Fu was not greatly appreciated. In part {{this can be}} attributed to his stylistic and formal innovations, some of which are still [...] "considered extremely daring and bizarre by Chinese critics." [...] There are few contemporary references to him—only eleven poems from six writers—and these describe him in terms of affection, but not as <b>a</b> <b>paragon</b> <b>of</b> poetic or moral ideals.

500|$|The triangular-shaped {{lobby is}} {{regarded}} as <b>a</b> <b>paragon</b> <b>of</b> the Art Deco style, with clear influences of German Expressionism. Chrysler wanted the design to impress other architects and automobile magnates, so he imported various materials without giving consideration to the extra costs incurred. He covered the walls with huge slabs of African red granite. On the floor, he marked a path from the entrances to the elevators using travertine from Siena. Originally, Van Alen's plans for the lobby included four large supporting columns, but they were removed after Chrysler objected {{on the grounds that}} the columns made the lobby appear [...] "cramped".|$|E

500|$|As a student, Grainger {{had learned}} to {{appreciate}} the music of Grieg, and came to regard the Norwegian as <b>a</b> <b>paragon</b> <b>of</b> Nordic beauty and greatness. Grieg in turn described Grainger as a new way forward for English composition, [...] "quite different from Elgar, very original". After a lifetime interpreting Grieg's works, in 1944 Grainger began adapting the Norwegian's E minor Piano Sonata, Op. 7 as a [...] "Grieg-Grainger Symphony", but abandoned the project after writing 16 bars of music. By this time, Grainger acknowledged {{that he had not}} fulfilled Grieg's high expectations of him, either as a composer or as a pianist. He also reflected on whether it would have been better, {{from the point of view}} of his development as a composer, had he never met the Griegs, [...] "sweet and dear though they were to me".|$|E
500|$|Opinions on Eystein {{have been}} {{strongly}} favourable.

[...] Snorri Sturluson later wrote that Eystein [...] "was wise, intelligent, and acquainted with the laws and history. He had much knowledge of mankind, was quick in counsel, prudent in words, and very eloquent and very generous. He was very merry, yet modest; and was liked and beloved, indeed, by all the people." [...] The view of Eystein as a peaceful and domestically active king has been supported by modern historians such as Claus Krag, although noting that the literary embellishments should be disregarded.|$|E
