40|$|Publicación ISIObjective The use of gonyautoxin {{has been}} {{reported}} to be safe and effective in healing acute and chronic anal fissures. This study was designed to show better efficacy in healing patients with chronic anal fissure by increasing the frequency of toxin injection. Method Twenty-three chronic anal fissure patients were treated with doses of 100 units of gonyautoxin, which was intrasphincteric, infiltrated. The frequency of injection was every 4 days. <b>Anorectal</b> <b>manometries</b> were performed before and 4 min after infiltration. Results Total remissions were achieved within 7 - 14 days. The patients healed with a mean time of 8. 2 +/- 2. 4 days. No relapsed were observed during the 10 -month follow up. Neither faecal incontinence nor other side effects were observed. All patients showed immediate sphincter relaxation detected by clinical examination. The maximum anal resting pressures, recorded 4 min after injections decreased to 62. 9 +/- 27. 7 mmHg, being 65. 3 +/- 29. 6 % of baseline. Immediately after infiltration, patients reported anaesthetic effect with a fall down of the postdefecatory pain. Conclusion Although, gonyautoxin anal fissures treatment recently published proved to be safe and effective, this study shows a better protocol for anal fissure treatment, showing better efficacy by shorting the healing time with better perception of healing by patients. Gonyautoxin anal sphincter infiltration proves to be safe and effective, reducing discomfort and healing time, advantageously comparing with alternative therapeutic approaches for chronic anal fissure...|$|R
40|$|Background: To {{investigate}} {{the relevance of}} two-dimensional (2 D) endoanal ultrasonic (EAUS) assessment of anal sphincter and puborectalis morphology by comparison to functional measures derived from patient symptoms and anorectal physiology. Methods: Thirty women (mean age 44 years, mean parity 2) with anal incontinence underwent 2 D EAUS, <b>anorectal</b> pull-through <b>manometry,</b> <b>anorectal</b> electosensitivity and sensation to rectal distension, pelvic floor dynamometry, and completed Wexner incontinence scores. EAUS images were reported blind to physiological assessments by a single experienced observer. The external and internal sphincters, and puborectalis were measured and scored for integrity and atrophy, and correlated with symptom load (Wexner score) and physiological data. Results: The mean Wexner score was 10 (range 1 – 20). The puborectalis could not be accurately measured in 12 patients (44 %) on EAUS. Anal squeeze pressure correlated with integrity of the external sphincter (r = − 0. 4, p =  0. 02) but not integrity or atrophy of the puborectalis. There were no other significant correlations between EAUS features and patient symptom load or anorectal physiology (r range, − 0. 42 – 0. 26, p >  0. 05).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} colonic motility in the pathogenesis of anorectal symptoms and dysfunction after radiotherapy (RT) for carcinoma of the prostate. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-eight patients, median age 71 (range, 50 – 81) years with localized prostate carcinoma randomized {{to one of two}} radiation dose schedules underwent colonic transit scintigraphy and assessment of anorectal symptoms (questionnaire), <b>anorectal</b> function (<b>manometry),</b> and anal sphincteric morphology (endoanal ultrasound) before and at 1 month and 1 year after RT. RESULTS: Whole and distal colonic transit increased 1 month after RT, with faster distal colonic transit only persisting at 1 year. Frequency and urgency of defecation, fecal incontinence, and rectal bleeding increased 1 month after RT and persisted at 1 year. Basal anal pressures remained unchanged, but progressive reductions occurred in anal squeeze pressures and responses to increased intra-abdominal pressure. Rectal compliance decreased progressively in the patients, although no changes in anorectal sensory function ensued. Radiotherapy had no effect on the morphology of the internal and external anal sphincters. Distal colonic retention was weakly related to rectal compliance at 1 month, but both faster colonic transit and reduced rectal compliance were more frequent with increased fecal urgency. At 1 year, a weak inverse relationship existed between colonic half-clearance time and frequency of defecation, although both faster whole-colonic transit and reduced rectal compliance occurred more often with increased stool frequency. CONCLUSION: Colonic dysmotility contributes to anorectal dysfunction after RT for carcinoma of the prostate. This has implications for improving the management of anorectal radiation sequelae.

40|$|Aims: To {{evaluate}} children {{referred for}} defecation disorders using the child behavioural checklist (CBCL). Methods: A total of 215 patients {{were divided into}} three groups: 135 (5 - 14 years of age) with paediatric constipation (PC), 56 (5 - 17 years) with functional non-retentive faecal soiling (FNRFS), and 24 (5 - 16 years) with recurrent abdominal pain (RAP). Behavioural scores were correlated with colonic transit time (CTT) and <b>anorectal</b> function parameters (<b>manometry</b> and EMG). Results: No {{significant differences in the}} mean CBCL scores were found among the three patient groups. However, children with PC and FNRFS had significantly more behavioural problems than the Dutch normative sample, while children with RAP had scores within the normal range. No {{significant differences were found between}} CTT in the patient groups, with respect to the CBCL. Similarly, no significant difference existed between children able or unable to relax their pelvic floor muscles during defecation attempts and their behaviour profiles. Conclusion: There seems to be no relation between colonic/anorectal function and specific behavioural profiles.

40|$|Purpose: {{the authors}} {{describe}} a modified technique of primary transanal rectosigmoidectomy for Hirschsprung's disease (HD), using a Swenson like procedure {{to perform the}} anastomosis between the colon and the rectum, and the preliminary results from this in children. Methods: Twenty children, of whom, 90 % were boys and 10 % girls, 50 % white and 50 % nonwhite, aged 15 days to 10 years and with HD proven via biopsy, underwent a transanal pull-through procedure over a 29 -month period. Postoperative follow-up ranged from 29 to 5 months. the proximal cut edge of the mucosal and submucosal cuff was tagged with multiple polypropylene 4 - 0 sutures, which were used for traction of the intestinal layers outside. the rectal mucosa was incised circumferentially using cautery, to perform rectal dissection approximately 1. 5 cm from the dentate line, except in newborn case, in which the proximal cut edge was 0. 5 cm from the dentate line. the dissection extended in an upward direction around the entire rectal circumference {{as far as the}} opening of the peritoneal reflection. the full thickness of rectum and sigmoid were mobilized outside through the anus, with division and coagulation of the rectal and sigmoid vessels using cautery or ligatures with cotton 4 - 0. the dissected colon then was divided above the transition zone, which was confirmed via full-thickness biopsy sections and with frozen section confirmation of ganglion cell presence. the authors performed a modified Swenson anastomosis technique, using a seromuscular polyglactin 4 - 0 separate-stitch suture. No drains were used. Results: Normal bowel movements were displayed by all patients at the follow-up. All patients underwent a defecogram and <b>anorectal</b> computerized <b>manometry</b> at 3 months after surgery that showed an absence of stenosis and good anorectal sphincter muscle complex function. the incidence of complications in our series was 10 %.

40|$|Autonomic {{neuropathy}} {{is thought}} {{to play a role}} in the pathogenesis of slow-transit constipation, but other gastrointestinal organs may also be involved, even if they are symptom-free. We investigated whether motility in gastrointestinal organs other than the colon was impaired in patients with slow-transit constipation and whether the autonomic nervous system was involved. METHODS: Twenty-one consecutive patients (18 females; median age, 46 years) with severe chronic constipation (< or = 2 defecations/week and delayed colonic transit time) were studied. Autonomic neuropathy function was tested with esophageal manometry, gastric and gallbladder emptying (fasting and postprandial motility) by ultrasonography, orocecal transit time (H 2 -breath test), colonic transit time (radiopaque markers), and <b>anorectal</b> volumetric <b>manometry.</b> The integrity of the autonomic nervous system was assessed by a quantitative sweat-spot test for preganglionic and postganglionic fibers, tilt-table test, and Valsalva electrocardiogram R-R ratio. RESULTS: Esophageal manometry showed gastroesophageal reflux or absence of peristalsis in five of the seven patients examined. Gallbladder dysmotility (i. e., increased fasting, postprandial residual volume, or both) was observed in 6 of 14 (43 percent) patients. Gastric emptying was decreased in 13 of 17 (76 percent) patients. Orocecal transit time was delayed in 18 of 20 (90 percent) patients; median transit time was 160 (range, 90 - 200) minutes. Median colonic transit time was 97 (range, 64 - 140) hours. Anorectal function showed abnormal rectoanal inhibitory reflex and decreased rectal sensitivity in 11 of 19 (58 percent) patients. Signs of autonomic neuropathy of the sympathetic cholinergic system were found in 14 of 18 (78 percent) patients. Only one of nine patients had vagal abnormalities detected with the Valsalva test and four of five patients with a history of orthostatic hypotension had a positive tilt-table test. CONCLUSIONS: Slow-transit constipation may be associated with impaired function of other gastrointestinal organs. More than 70 percent of patients with slow-transit constipation present some degree of autonomic neuropathy. Severe constipation may be the main complaint in patients with a systemic disease involving several organs and possibly involving the autonomic nervous system.

50|$|Some {{researchers}} {{have suggested that}} anismus is an over-diagnosed condition, since the standard investigations or digital rectal examination and <b>anorectal</b> <b>manometry</b> were shown to cause paradoxical sphincter contraction in healthy controls, {{who did not have}} constipation or incontinence. Due to the invasive and perhaps uncomfortable nature of these investigations, the pelvic floor musculature is thought to behave differently than under normal circumstances. These researchers went on to conclude that paradoxical pelvic floor contraction is a common finding in healthy people as well as in people with chronic constipation and stool incontinence, and it represents a non-specific finding or laboratory artifact related to untoward conditions during examination, and that true anismus is actually rare.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anorectal</b> <b>manometry</b> {{involves}} {{two separate}} tests: the balloon expulsion test and anal sphincter electromyography (EMG). These tests are performed {{in order to}} properly identify and diagnose dyssynergia. In order to prepare for these tests, a patient must fast and perform specific enemas recommended by their doctor two hours before their tests. When undergoing the balloon expulsion test, the patient has a small balloon inserted into their rectum, which is then inflated and filled with water. The patient is then instructed {{to go to the}} nearest bathroom and to attempt to defecate the balloon, where the time it takes is recorded by the doctors. An abnormal or prolonged time of expulsion of the balloon is seen as a problem in the anorectum region of the body and may lead to the diagnosis of dyssynergia, since the patient has a lack of control over their anorectal muscle contractions. Another technique used by doctors to test for dyssynergia is the anal sphincter EMG. This test involves the insertion of an electrode into the patient’s anal cavity, where they are asked to relax and push, as if they are trying to defecate. The electrical activity and contractile pressures of the patient’s anorectal contractions are recorded on a computer monitor and examined by the doctor. If the electrical activity of the contractions appear normal, but the patient still results in constipation, it would indicate {{that there is a problem}} in the muscle activity or that there might be a tear in the muscle. This can help lead to a diagnosis of dyssynergia or an alternative surgical cure.|$|E

50|$|Biofeedback {{is a major}} {{treatment}} for anismus (paradoxical contraction of puborectalis during defecation). This therapy directly evolved from the investigation <b>anorectal</b> <b>manometry</b> where a probe that can record pressure {{is placed in the}} anal canal. Biofeedback therapy is also a commonly used and researched therapy for fecal incontinence, but the benefits are uncertain. Biofeedback therapy varies in the way it is delivered. It is also unknown if one type has benefits over another. The aims have been described as to enhance either the rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR), rectal sensitivity (by discrimination of progressively smaller volumes of a rectal balloon and promptly contracting the external anal sphincter (EAS)), or the strength and endurance of the EAS contraction. Three general types of biofeedback have been described, though they are not mutually exclusive, with many protocols combining these elements. Similarly there is variance of the length of both the individual sessions and the overall length of the training, and if home exercises are performed in addition and how. In rectal sensitivity training, a balloon is placed in the rectum, and is gradually distended until there is a sensation of rectal filling. Successively smaller volume reinflations of the balloon aim to help the person detect rectal distension at a lower threshold, giving more time to contract the EAS and prevent incontinence, or to journey to the toilet. Alternatively, in those with urge incontinence/ rectal hypersensitivity, training is aimed at teaching the person to tolerate progressively larger volumes. Strength training may involve electromyography (EMG) skin electrodes, manometric pressures, intra-anal EMG, or endoanal ultrasound. One of these measures are used to relay the muscular activity or anal canal pressure during anal sphincter exercise. Performance and progress can be monitored in this manner. Co-ordination training involves the placing of 3 balloons, in the rectum and in the upper and lower anal canal. The rectal balloon is inflated to trigger the RAIR, an event often followed by incontinence. Co-ordination training aims to teach voluntary contraction of EAS when the RAIR occurs (i.e. when there is rectal distension).|$|E

40|$|Background/Aim: Hirschsprung&#x 2032;s disease (HD) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes {{resulting}} in lower intestinal obstruction in children with atypical clinical symptoms and inconspicuous morphological findings by barium enema X-ray. Recently, this situation has been largely ameliorated by improvement of instrument for measurement of anorectal pressure. By now, <b>anorectal</b> <b>manometry</b> has been regarded as a routine means for functional assessment and diagnosis of HD. It is accurate in nearly all cases of HD with characteristic absence of rectoanal inhibitory reflex.

We aimed to evaluate functional results after Swenson&#x 2032;s operation for HD using <b>anorectal</b> <b>manometry.</b> Patients and Methods: Between 1996 and 2005, 52 patients were diagnosed with HD and operated upon by Swenson&#x 2032;s operation in Gastroenterology Center, Mansoura University.

Results: All of the 52 patients showed absent rectoanal inhibitory reflex on manometric study with relatively higher resting anal canal pressure and within normal squeeze pressure. Postoperatively, there were 35 continent patients (67. 31 &#x 0025;) with 11 patients (21. 15 &#x 0025;) showing minor incontinence and six (11. 54 &#x 0025;) with major incontinence. On the other side, there were five patients (9. 62 &#x 0025;) with persistent constipation after operation (three due to anal stricture and two due to residual aganglionosis). Postoperative manometric study showed some improvement in anal sensation with the rectoanal inhibitory reflex becoming intact in six patients (11. 54 &#x 0025;) four years after operation. Conclusion: <b>Anorectal</b> <b>manometry</b> is a more reliable method for diagnosis of HD than barium enema X-ray but for final diagnosis, it is reasonable to combine <b>anorectal</b> <b>manometry</b> with tissue biopsy. Functional outcome after Swenson&#x 2032;s operation for HD may improve in some patients complaining of incontinence or constipation. <b>Anorectal</b> <b>manometry</b> may show improvement of the parameters after Swenson&#x 2032;s operation...|$|E
40|$|Objective Anorectal {{function}} {{tests are}} often performed {{in patients with}} faecal incontinence who have failed conservative treatment. This study was aimed to establish the additive value of performing anorectal function tests in these patients in selecting them for surgery. Patients and methods Between 2003 and 2009, all referred patients with faecal incontinence were assessed by a questionnaire, <b>anorectal</b> <b>manometry</b> and anal endosonography. Patients with diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease, pouches or rectal carcinoma were excluded. Results In total, 218 patients were evaluated. Of these, 107 (49 %) patients had no sphincter defects, 71 (33 %) had small defects and 40 (18 %) had large defects. <b>Anorectal</b> <b>manometry</b> could not differentiate between patients with and without sphincter defects. Patients with sphincter defects were only {{found to have a}} significantly shorter sphincter length and reduced rectal capacity compared to patients without sphincter defects. Forty-three patients (20 %) had a normal anal pressures ≥ 40 mmHg. Seventeen patients (8 %) had also a dyssynergic pelvic floor both on clinical examination and <b>anorectal</b> <b>manometry.</b> Fifteen patients (7 %) had a reduced rectal capacity between 65 and 100 ml. There was no difference in anal pressures or the presence of sphincter defects in these patients compared to patients with a rectal capacity > 150 ml. There was no correlation between <b>anorectal</b> <b>manometry,</b> endosonography and faecal incontinence severity scores. Conclusion In patients with faecal incontinence who have failed conservative treatment, only anal endosonography can reveal sphincter defects. <b>Anorectal</b> <b>manometry</b> should be reserved for patients eligible for surgery to exclude those with suspected dyssynergic floor or reduced rectal capacity. © Springer-Verlag 2012...|$|E
40|$|Constipation is {{a common}} problem in children. It can be a symptom of {{functional}} disorder in majority of cases, but sometimes a serious organic disease is a cause of constipation. <b>Anorectal</b> <b>manometry</b> {{plays an important role}} in the diagnostic procedure. It can be presumed that some values of manometric parameters can predict unsatisfactory outcome after conventional treatment of constipation. The aim of this study was to confirm or exclude such limits in manometric finding, to make a plan of the therapy more accurate. Therefore the group of 81 constipated children was investigated. There were 58 patients suffering from functional constipation and 23 with organic disorders. The age of the patients was 3 to 15 years. Scoring system was applied to estimate severitiy of constipation and <b>anorectal</b> <b>manometry</b> was performed before and after treatment. Treatment included behaviour and nutritional modification, laxatives and biofeedback training. Results of analysis show that most patients expirienced significant benefit from therapy. No manometric finding could predict unsatisfactory outcome, as correlation between most clinical and manometric parameters could indicate. Children with stronger deviation from normal finding in <b>anorectal</b> <b>manometry</b> responded even better to therapy. Therefore, the conclusion is that <b>anorectal</b> <b>manometry</b> is important in diagnostic procedure of constipated children, but can not be used to exclude some children from conventional therapy. Scoring system which was not described before was applied, and further investigations are necessary to improve it. ...|$|E
