5|$|The stone tool {{technology}} in {{use during the}} Middle Stone Age shows a mosaic of techniques. Beginning approximately 300 kya, the large cutting tools of the Achuelian are gradually displaced by Levallois prepared core technologies, also widely used by Neanderthals during the European Middle Palaeolithic. As the MSA progresses, highly varied technocomplexes become common throughout Africa and include pointed artifacts, blades, retouched flakes, end and side scrapers, grinding stones, and even bone tools. However, the use of blades (<b>associated</b> <b>mainly</b> with the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe) is seen at many sites as well. In Africa, blades {{may have been used}} during the transition from the Early Stone Age to the Middle Stone Age onwards. Finally, during the later part of the Middle Stone Age, microlithic technologies aimed at producing replaceable components of composite hafted tools are seen from at least 70 ka at sites such as Pinnacle Point and Diepkloof Rock Shelter in South Africa.|$|E

25|$|Many {{instruments}} {{that in the}} 2010s are associated with popular music filled important roles in early music, such as bagpipes, theorbos, vihuelas, hurdy-gurdies (hand-cranked string instruments), accordions, alphorns, hydraulises, calliopes, sistrums, and some woodwind instruments such as tin whistles, panpipes, shawms and crumhorns. On the other hand, instruments such as the acoustic guitar, once <b>associated</b> <b>mainly</b> with popular music, gained prominence in classical music in the 19th and 20th centuries {{in the form of}} the classical guitar and banjo. While equal temperament gradually accepted as the dominant musical temperament during the 19th century, different historical temperaments are often used for music from earlier periods. For instance, music of the English Renaissance is often performed in meantone temperament. As well, while professional orchestras and pop bands all around the world have tuned to an A fixed at 440Hz since the late 19th century, there was historically a great variety in the tuning pitch, as attested to in historical pipe organs that still exist.|$|E

25|$|Most bird pollinated {{flowers are}} red {{and have a}} lot of nectar. They also tend to be unscented. Flowers with generalist pollinators tend to have dilute nectar but those that have {{specialist}} pollinators such as hummingbirds or sunbirds tend to have more concentrated nectar. The nectar of ornithophilous flowers vary in the sugar composition, with hexoses being high in passerine pollinated species while those that are insect pollinated tend to be sucrose rich. Hummingbird pollinated flowers however tend to be sucrose rich. Many plants of the family Loranthaceae have explosive flowers that shower pollen on a bird that forages near it. They are <b>associated</b> <b>mainly</b> with flowerpeckers in the Dicaeidae family. In Australia, some species of Banksia have flowers that open in response to bird actions thereby reducing the wastage of pollen. In tropical dry forests in southern India, ornithophilous flowers were found to bloom mainly in the hot dry season. As many as 129 species of North American plants have evolved ornithophilous associations. Nearly a fourth of the 900 species of the genus Salvia are bird pollinated in the South African region. Tropical China and the adjacent Indochinese countries harbor relatively few bird-pollinated flowers, among them is Rhodoleia championii, a member of the Hamamelidaceae family, which at any one site can be visited and pollinated by up to seven species of nectar-foraging birds, including Japanese white-eyes (Zosterops japonicus, Zosteropidae) and fork-tailed sunbirds (Aethopyga christinae, Nectariniidae).|$|E
2500|$|The City Beautiful Movement was {{a reform}} {{philosophy}} of North American architecture and urban planning that flourished during the 1890s and 1900s {{with the intent}} of introducing beautification and monumental grandeur in cities. The movement, which was originally <b>associated</b> <b>mainly</b> with Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, and Washington, D.C., promoted beauty not only for its own sake, but also to create moral and civic virtue among urban populations. Advocates of the philosophy believed that such beautification could promote a harmonious social order that would increase the quality of life, while critics would complain that the movement was overly concerned with aesthetics at the expense of social reform; Jane Jacobs referred to the movement as an [...] "architectural design cult." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{group of}} {{accessory}} clouds comprise formations that are <b>associated</b> <b>mainly</b> with upward-growing cumuliform and cumulonimbiform clouds of free convection. Pileus is a cap cloud that can form over a cumulonimbus or large cumulus cloud, whereas a velum feature {{is a thin}} horizontal sheet that sometimes forms like an apron around the middle or {{in front of the}} parent cloud. [...] An accessory cloud recently officially recognized the World meteorological Organization is the flumen, also known more informally as the beaver's tail. It is formed by the warm, humid inflow of a super-cell thunderstorm, and can be mistaken for a tornado. Although the flumen can indicate a tornado risk, it is similar in appearance to pannus or scud clouds and does not rotate.|$|E

2500|$|In {{syntactic}} analysis, {{a constituent}} {{is a word}} {{or a group of}} words that function(s) as a single unit within a hierarchical structure. [...] The analysis of constituent structure is <b>associated</b> <b>mainly</b> with phrase structure grammars, although dependency grammars also allow sentence structure to be broken down into constituent parts. The constituent structure of sentences is identified using constituency tests. These tests manipulate some portion of a sentence and based on the result, clues are delivered about the immediate constituent structure of the sentence. Many constituents are phrases. A phrase is a sequence of one or more words (in some theories two or more) built around a head lexical item and working as a unit within a sentence. A word sequence is shown to be a phrase/constituent if it exhibits {{one or more of the}} behaviors discussed below.|$|E
