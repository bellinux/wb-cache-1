At {{the beginning of her}} career, she was often described by the press as having a vivacious personality and a bubbly, outgoing persona, an image she had confessed to disliking. According to film critic Sukanya Verma, Zinta's energetic nature extends from her real life into her appearances in films and {{is an integral part of}} her technique. In an article discussing Hindi film actresses and their flair for comedy, Verma wrote, [...] "What can you say about an actress who giggles non-stop in a tone that is anything but prim and propah? She is carefree. She is animated. She talks non-stop. She laughs all the time. She has a chilled out sense of humour. And a tomboyish streak too.

On {{the night}} of the video's premiere, Rap-Up complimented Beyoncé on starting a [...] "dance revolution", her [...] "heavily-choreographed visuals" [...] and [...] "menagerie of wild animals, outrageous fashion, and epic dance sequences". Eric Henderson of Slant Magazine wrote that Beyoncé comes off like [...] "barely sentient" [...] but added that she remains cohesive and rational as a human being in real life. He further wrote: [...] "Her reserve of crazy is far from bottomless, and she seems to save it all for her music videos, and I love her for that [...] awesome in distressingly fragmented ways." [...] Gina Serpe of E! Online wrote that [...] "for anyone still laboring under the illusion that Beyoncé does not mean business, well, just watch this video. Described by B herself as 'futuristic', 'electronic' and 'African', the 29-year-old fused <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>more</b> into a still remarkably cohesive music video." [...] CBS News wrote the [...] "smoking hot video [...] blowing up on the web". The Huffington Post wrote that Beyoncé largely brings back the elements that made [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)"'s video a hit, citing women's empowerment and a brand new dance. Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post complimented Beyoncé's wardrobe and dancing in the video, and wrote that the choreography ensures the lyrics, [...] "my persuasion can build a nation".|$|E

60|$|It {{is really}} {{impossible}} to say where or how we breakfasted, but it was somehow managed, and then search {{was made by the}} swiftest conveyance for the hotel which we had heard of outside the city, as helping make Leghorn the watering-place it is for Italians in the summer, and in the winter as being steam-heated and appointed with every modern comfort for the passing or sojourning stranger. It was <b>all</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> <b>more,</b> and only for the fear that I should seem to join it in advertising its merits I should like to celebrate it by name. But perhaps it is as well not; if I did, all my readers would swarm upon that hotel, {{and there would be no}} room for me, who hope some day to go back there and spend an old age of luxurious leisure. There was not only steam-heat in the public rooms of the ground floor, but there was furnace heat in all the corridors, and there were fireplaces in certain chambers, which also looked out on the sea, to Corsica and Elba and other isles of it, and would be full of sun as soon as the cold rain closed a fortnight's activity. That which diffused a blander atmosphere than steam or radiator, register and hearth, however, was the kind will, the benevolent intelligence, which imagined us, and which would not then let us go. We had become not only agnostic as respected the possibility of warmth in Leghorn, we were open sceptics, aggressive infidels. But the landlord himself followed us from one room to another, lighting fires here and there on the hearth, making us feel the warm air rising from the furnace, calling us to witness by palpation the heat of the radiators, soothing our fears, and coaxing our unfaith. His wife joined him in Italian and his son in English, and, if I do not say that these amiable people were worthy all the prosperity which was not then apparent in their establishment, may I never be comfortably lodged or fed again. Our daily return for what we got was a poor twelve francs each; but fancy a haughty American landlord caressing us with such sweet and reassuring civility for any sum of money! Those gentle people made themselves our friends; there was nothing they would not do, or try to do, for us, in the vast, pink palace where we were never twenty guests together, and mostly eight or ten, with the run of a reading-room where there were the latest papers and periodicals from London and Paris, and with a kitchen whence we were served the best luncheons and dinners we ate in Europe.|$|E
