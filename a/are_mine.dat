25|$|In Congress, {{there are}} tough {{questions}} to be asked of the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA). Is enforcement of coal mining regulations tough enough? Are the regulations on the books today current enough to handle the challenges posed by 21st century coal mining? <b>Are</b> <b>mine</b> hazards being minimized? These and other issues demand scrutiny, and the miners’ families deserve the answers.|$|E
25|$|The Bedok-class <b>are</b> <b>mine</b> {{countermeasures}} vessels (MCMVs) of the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN). They play {{an important}} role in the maritime security of Singapore, ensuring that the Singapore Strait and the sea lanes surrounding Singapore remain mine-free and open to international shipping. It is estimated that closure of Singapore's ports would result in direct trade losses amounting to more than US$1.2 billion daily, posing a serious threat to Singapore's economy. The four ships form the 194 Squadron of the RSN.|$|E
25|$|Historically, {{coal mining}} {{has been a}} very {{dangerous}} activity, and the list of historical coal mining disasters is long. The principal hazards <b>are</b> <b>mine</b> wall failures and vehicle collisions; underground mining hazards include suffocation, gas poisoning, roof collapse and gas explosions. Chronic lung diseases, such as pneumoconiosis (black lung) were once common in miners, leading to reduced life expectancy. In some mining countries black lung is still common, with 4,000 new cases of black lung every year in the US (4 percent of workers annually) and 10,000 new cases every year in China (0.2 percent of workers). Rates may be higher than reported in some regions.|$|E

2500|$|On {{the morning}} after Erroll's body was discovered, de Janzé went to the morgue with a friend to see his body. According to eyewitnesses, Alice stunned those in {{attendance}} by leaving a tree branch on Erroll's corpse, and whispering the words: [...] "Now you <b>are</b> <b>mine</b> forever". Eyewitness and close friend Julian Lezzard suspected that Alice was the murderer, since it fitted with her morbid preoccupations; it was even rumoured that Alice herself had admitted to the killing. [...] In his investigative book, White Mischief, journalist James Fox mentions a suspicious incident regarding Alice and her possible connection to the crime. A {{few months after the}} murder, Alice went away for a few days and asked a neighbour to look after her house. In her absence, one of Alice's houseboys came to the neighbour, and produced a revolver, which he claimed he had found by a bridge, under a pile of stones on Alice's land.|$|E

2500|$|Urkesh was {{an ally of}} the Akkadian Empire {{through what}} is {{believed}} to have been a dynastic marriage tradition. Tar'am-Agade the daughter of the Akkadian king, Naram-Sin, {{is believed to have}} been married to the king of Urkesh. During the early second millennium BC the city passed into the hands of the rulers of Mari, a city a few hundred miles to the south. The king of Urkesh became a vassal (and apparently an appointed puppet) of Mari. The people of Urkesh evidently resented this, as the royal archives at Mari provide evidence of their strong resistance; in one letter, the king of Mari tells his Urkesh counterpart that [...] "I did not know that the sons of your city hate you on my account. But you <b>are</b> <b>mine,</b> even if the city of Urkesh is not." [...] In the middle of the millennium, Tell Mozan was the location of a Mitanni religious site. The city appears to have been largely abandoned circa 1350 BC, although the reason for this is unknown to archaeologists at this time.|$|E
