5|$|Granada's sale of {{the series}} package to American cable network Bravo in 2000 {{included}} this pilot. Bravo hired agency G WhiZ to design a series of print and media advertisements for the series to run in such publications as The New York Times. G WhiZ based their campaign on the shot of Adam's buttocks, which led to many publications either <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> alternative or refusing to carry the promotion outright.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{contacted}} Beshear, <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> {{executive order}} to protect clerks who have moral objections against personally issuing such marriage licenses, as Kentucky law requires county clerks to issue marriage licenses in their names. She began turning away gay couples from her county office who were seeking marriage licenses. David Ermold and David Moore, a same-sex couple from Morehead, Kentucky and alumni of Morehead State University, released video footage on July 7, 2015 of Davis refusing to issue them a marriage license and requesting that they turn off their camera. The video went viral overnight.|$|E
5|$|In 1898 the Westbury and Hagley Water Act was passed, {{providing}} {{for construction of}} a reticulated water scheme using water from the Meander River and other streams. Hagley was connected to mains water via the Westbury-Hagley water scheme in 1902. By 1923 residents of Hagley were <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> upgrade of the system, as it was seen as inadequate by then. The Westbury Council took out loans in 1952 to extend the system, and work on this extension continued into 1954, still connected to Westbury although with larger diameter pipes.|$|E
5000|$|In {{some rules}} of Marjapussi, {{the options for}} declaring marriages are ordered: Self-declaring comes first, <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> whole comes second, and <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> half comes last. In your first opportunity, you are allowed to choose freely which {{alternative}} you use, {{but you are not}} allowed to self-declare after you have <b>asked</b> either <b>for</b> <b>a</b> whole or a half, and you are not allowed to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> whole after you have <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> half. The restrictions apply only per hand, and start of a new hand nullifies the restrictions. In some variants, a team that has not <b>asked</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> whole is not allowed to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> half.|$|R

If the husband <b>asks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> divorce and intercourse has occurred, he pays full mahr; if the husband <b>asks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> divorce and the intercourse has not occurred, the husband pays half the dower; if the wife <b>asks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> divorce and intercourse has occurred, the husband pays half the mahr; and if the wife <b>asks</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> divorce and is still an intercourse has not occurred, then no mahr is required to be paid by the husband.|$|R
5|$|By the late-19th century, Charing Cross {{was seen}} as being inconveniently placed. In 1889, the newly-formed London County Council's John Burns {{proposed}} that the station and its approach should be demolished, with a road bridge put in place. The idea gained support with in the council as it would allow the Strand to be widened and put a road crossing over the Thames that could bypass Whitehall. When the SECR went to Parliament <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> act to strengthen the bridge in 1916, Burns suggested the station {{was in the wrong}} place and should be rebuilt {{on the south side of}} the Thames. The following year, an act was passed to reconstruct the bridge, with strict conditions about its appearance and a ban on enlarging the station building itself.|$|E
5|$|Katherine {{continues}} to pursue Mike, believing {{that he is}} {{still in love with}} her. Mike warns her to leave his family alone and claims he never truly loved her. After he leaves, Katherine calls 9-1-1 <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> ambulance, and then stabs herself with a knife with Mike's fingerprints on it. Katherine frames Mike for her wound. Susan, realizing that Katherine has suffered a total nervous breakdown, calls Katherine's daughter, Dylan (Lyndsy Fonseca), who comes to town and has her mother committed for psychiatric observation. Susan later forgives Katherine once she recovers from her breakdown. Soon after, Mike reveals that he has accumulated an immense debt in the past year. Unable to balance their debt, Susan and Mike decide to move off Wisteria Lane and rent their house out temporarily. They move into an apartment across town while Paul Young rents their house on Wisteria Lane.|$|E
5|$|The music {{industry}} {{was in a}} period of transition at the time the song was published as new technologies allowed music to be recorded. U.S. copyright laws at the time did not allow music composers to control the distribution of phonograph cylinders or music rolls for player pianos. Edison Records paid popular singers like Harry Macdonough to sing the songs and then sold the recordings without paying any royalties to the composer or publisher of the music. Dresser joined with other prominent composers to seek a change in U.S. copyright laws. In 1902 Dresser met with U.S. senators and the Secretary of State in Washington, D.C. He also submitted papers with the U.S. State Department <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> extension of copyright protection outside the United States, especially in Canada and England.|$|E

5|$|Subsequently, the {{legislature}} and local press started questioning {{the actions of the}} Puerto Rico Police, the Puerto Rico Justice Department, the U.S. Justice Department, and the FBI actions during the first investigation, alleging corruption within the agencies and a conspiracy to cover-up evidence. Letters were sent by various community and political leaders to then Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Senator Edward M. Kennedy, <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> inquiry into the conduct of the Federal investigations. Several letters even accused former US Attorney General Benjamin R. Civiletti of providing aid to Gov. Romero Barceló during the investigations. Two leaders from the opposing parties, the Popular Democratic Party and the Puerto Rican Independence Party, charged that after a December 1979 meeting between the two, the Governor, then considered as a lifelong Republican, began campaigning to deliver the 41 Democratic Party convention votes of the island for President Jimmy Carter's (D) nomination for the presidency (ironically, Carter’s opponent for the nomination was Senator Kennedy). Almost 45 days after President Carter won the nomination by only one delegate, the U.S. Justice Department announced that due to lack of evidence it was bringing its investigation of the case to an end. A Justice Department internal memorandum that was issued the same month of Romero Barceló’s and Civiletti’s meeting later proved that the investigations were closed even when agents were still investigating important evidence of the case that could potentially incriminate the officers, including “several unexplained contusions” on a victim's face and the fact that one of the police officers recanted his original story, stating that there was in fact “two bursts of firing”.|$|E
5|$|Under {{increasingly}} immense {{pressure to}} resign, Agnew took {{the position that}} a sitting vice president could not be indicted and met with Speaker of the House Carl Albert on September 25, <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> investigation. He cited as precedent an 1826 House investigation of Vice President John C. Calhoun, who was alleged to have taken improper payments while a cabinet member. Albert, second in line to the presidency under Agnew, responded {{that it would be}} improper for the House to act in a matter before the courts. Agnew also filed a motion to block any indictment on the grounds that he had been prejudiced by improper leaks from the Justice Department, and tried to rally public opinion, giving a speech before a friendly audience in Los Angeles asserting his innocence and attacking the prosecution. Nevertheless, Agnew entered into negotiations for a plea bargain, and wrote in his memoirs that he did so because he was worn out from the extended crisis, to protect his family, and because he feared he could not get a fair trial. He made his decision on October 5, and plea negotiations took place over the following days. On October 9, Agnew visited Nixon at the White House and informed the President of his impending resignation.|$|E

50|$|Both legs in {{a neutral}} {{position}} (neither forward nor back), applying equal pressure against the horse's sides, generally <b>asks</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> increase in speed or an upward transition (such as walk to trot). Depending {{on the level of}} restraining aids (seat and hands), the leg can also <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> increase in impulsion, for collection, or even for the rein back. To ask a horse to back up, a rider simultaneously uses soft rein aids to keep the horse from stepping forward, but uses the legs to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> movement, so the horse moves backwards. It is incorrect to <b>ask</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> rein back by pulling or jerking on the reins.|$|R

25|$|The Packers were {{scheduled}} to retire Favre's #4 jersey in a ceremony {{during the first week}} of the season.

On July 11, 2008, Favre sent a letter to the Packers management <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> unconditional release which will allow him to play for another team. The Packers did not give it to him, but they were unwilling to release him for fear that he would sign with division rival Minnesota Vikings (Favre's choice for an alternate team). Also, the Packers would not start him as quarterback if he came back to the team, and named the other Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers as the starting quarterback and Favre as the backup.|$|E
25|$|Although, {{according}} to textual scholars, {{the only source}} texts among those comprising the Torah which mention the shewbread are the Holiness Code and later additions to the priestly source, the antiquity of the practice is shown by its mention in the Books of Samuel which textual scholars generally view as predating the priestly source. In the Books of Samuel, Ahimelek is described as <b>asking</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> assurance that David's men were in a ritually pure state, namely {{that they had not}} been involved in sexual activity with women, before handing over the old shewbread; biblical scholars view this as suggesting that the showbread was originally a sacrificial meal which was viewed as being shared with the deity, hence the need to be ritually pure, and the bread not being burnt but instead consumed.|$|E
