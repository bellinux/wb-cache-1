Power and Glory's team won the match, during which Roma eliminated Michaels after performing a PowerPlex with Hercules.|$|E
5|$|Pliny's {{purpose in}} writing the Natural History was to cover all {{learning}} and art so far as they are connected with nature or draw their materials from nature. He says:My subject is a barren one – the world of nature, or in other words life; and that subject in its least elevated department, and employing either rustic terms or foreign, nay barbarian words that <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be introduced with an apology. Moreover, the path is not a beaten highway of authorship, nor {{one in which the}} mind is eager to range: there is not one of us who has made the same venture, nor yet one among the Greeks who has tackled single-handed all departments of the subject.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the court {{vacation}} in August 1904, Hastings decided that {{it would be best to}} find a tenancy in a more prestigious set of chambers; Corbet only dealt with two or three cases a year, and solicitors were unlikely to give briefs to a barrister of whom they had never heard. The set of chambers below Corbet's was run by Charles Gill, a well-respected barrister. Hastings would be able to improve his career through an association with Gill, but Gill did not actually know Hastings and had no reason to offer him a place in his chambers. Hastings decided he would spend the court vacation writing a law book, and introduce himself to Gill by asking if he would mind having the book dedicated to him. Hastings wrote the book on the subject of the law relating to money-lending, something he knew very little about. He got around this by including large extracts from the judgements in cases related to money-lending, which increased the size of the book and reduced how much he would <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> write.|$|E

When he learned {{that he would have}} to serve under Joe Hooker, Slocum, who had disliked Hooker since Chancellorsville, wrote to President Lincoln saying that he would rather resign from the Army. Lincoln assured him that he would not <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> serve under Hooker and a compromise was reached whereby one division of the corps, under Slocum, was assigned to protect the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad while the other division served directly under Hooker.|$|E
25|$|A Kaldor–Hicks improvement, {{named for}} Nicholas Kaldor and John Hicks, {{also known as}} the Kaldor–Hicks criterion, is a way of judging {{economic}} re-allocations of resources among people that captures some of the intuitive appeal of Pareto efficiencies, but has less stringent criteria and is hence applicable to more circumstances. A re-allocation is a Kaldor–Hicks improvement if those that are made better off could hypothetically compensate those that are made worse off and lead to a Pareto-improving outcome. The compensation does not <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> occur (there is no presumption in favor of status-quo) and thus, a Kaldor–Hicks improvement can in fact leave some people worse off.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} species of fungus that grow alongside the domatia where the ants live. In fact, when the founding queen first starts laying eggs in the domatia of a new H. physophora, the hyphae of multiple different species of fungi will entirely cover {{the entrance to the}} domatia. When the worker ants mature, they <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> dig their way through the fungal covering to get to the outside of the plant. However, almost even more remarkably, out of all of these fungal species, A. decemarticulatus will only cultivate one specific species. This fungus is a sooty mold which, according to one study by Mario X. Ruiz-Gonzalez et al. (2010), is characterized by closely related haplotypes (genetic markers) in the order Chaetothyriales. The ants use this mold to construct their traps.|$|E

25|$|After {{the death}} of Queen Elizabeth I, in 1603 King James I assumed the throne of England. After years of war, England was {{strapped}} for funds, so he granted responsibility for England's New World colonization to the Virginia Company, which became incorporated as a joint stock company by a proprietary charter drawn up in 1606. There were two competing branches of the Virginia Company and each hoped to establish a colony in Virginia in order to exploit gold (which the region did not <b>actually</b> <b>have),</b> <b>to</b> establish a base of support for English privateering against Spanish ships, and to spread Protestantism to the New World in competition with Spain's spread of Catholicism. Within the Virginia Company, the Plymouth Company branch was assigned a northern portion of the area known as Virginia, and the London Company area to the south.|$|E
500|$|In a February 4, 2008 {{appearance}} on the G4 television program Attack of the Show!, Mark Ebner, journalist {{and author of the}} book Hollywood, Interrupted, and Nick Douglas of Gawker.com commented on Project Chanology. Ebner stated that [...] "Hacking their site is not really the best way to go about taking them (the Church of Scientology) down. Most critics you talk to want the Scientology site to be up there so that people who are interested can see the stupidity they have on the web and at the same time they can go - they are a few keystrokes from getting a thousand other opinions." [...] Nick Douglas explained that the group decided to shift their strategy away from the attacks to Scientology websites: [...] "Anonymous even decided that they were going to stop that attack, that it was a bad idea. It's the usual thing they used to do when they really hadn't had a thought out plan, and here they're realizing they <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> figure out some real plan against a real enemy." ...|$|E
500|$|Plumer {{discovered}} that the line near Passchendaele had hardly changed and that {{the main reason for}} the failure on 9 October was uncut barbed wire [...] deep, in front of the pillboxes at the hamlet of Bellevue on the Wallemolen spur.

Duckboard tracks had been extended to the line held on 9 October, which allowed infantry to move up on the night of 11 October in time for the attack, despite rain and a German gas bombardment on Gravenstafel spur. High winds and heavy rain began about zero hour (...) and lasted all day.|$|E

2500|$|Duck stance: Useful for tricks by {{removing}} the forward bias altogether, the feet are angled outwards in opposite directions, such as 15° for the front foot and -6° for the back foot. This stance is becoming increasingly popular, and is the most resilient of the three. The feet do not <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> be angled equally outwards to be considered duck stance. [...] The back foot simply has to be angled less than zero degrees. These angles give the rider a dominant front foot angle at all times which {{makes it easier for}} a rider to change the board direction mid-run. This change in board direction mid-run is called riding [...] "Switch" [...] or [...] "Fakie". Duck stance is also very popular for park riders because it gives them the versatility to move their board in all directions. It is easier to spin, balance on rails and boxes, and land [...] "switch" [...] when one's feet are both angled outward. The degree of the angle depends on the individual.|$|E

2500|$|In aviation, {{instrument}} pilots use {{radio navigation}} aids. To {{ensure that the}} stations the pilots are using are serviceable, the stations all transmit a short set of identification letters (usually a two-to-five-letter version of the station name) in Morse code. Station identification letters are shown on air navigation charts. For example, the VOR based at Manchester Airport in England is abbreviated as [...] "MCT", and MCT in Morse code is transmitted on its radio frequency. In some countries, during periods of maintenance, the facility may radiate a T-E-S-T code (...) or the code may be removed which tells pilots and navigators that the station is unreliable. [...] In Canada, the identification is removed entirely to signify the navigation aid {{is not to be}} used. [...] In the aviation service, Morse is typically sent at a very slow speed of about 5 words per minute. [...] In the U.S., pilots do not <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> know Morse to identify the transmitter because the dot/dash sequence is written out next to the transmitter's symbol on aeronautical charts. [...] Some modern navigation receivers automatically translate the code into displayed letters.|$|E

[...] USA Today gave the film {{three and a half}} stars out of four, saying of the screenplay, [...] "It appears as if screenwriters Brian Helgeland and Curtis Hanson have pulled off a miracle in keeping multiple stories straight. Have they ever. Ellroy's novel has four extra layers of plot and three times as many characters ... the writers have trimmed unwieldy muscle, not just fat, and gotten away with it." [...] In his review for Newsweek, David Ansen wrote, [...] "L.A. Confidential asks the audience to raise its level a bit, too—you <b>actually</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> pay attention to follow the double-crossing intricacies of the plot. The reward for your work is dark and dirty fun." [...] Richard Schickel, in his review for Time, wrote, [...] "It's a movie of shadows and half lights, the best approximation of the old black-and-white noir look anyone has yet managed on color stock. But it's no idle exercise in style. The film's look suggests how deep the tradition of police corruption runs." ...|$|E
