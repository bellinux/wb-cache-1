Adequate air entrainment is in practice usually checked by measuring total air content of fresh concrete. However, characteristics of air pore system, above all their number and distribution by size, rather than total air content are responsible for adequate {{frost resistance}} of concrete. Therefore <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> carried out in framework of my diploma was to analyze characteristics of air bubbles in hardened concrete with help of linear microscopical analyses (LMA) in accordance with SIST EN 480 - 11 : 2005. Main influencing parameters that were studied were consistency and total air content of fresh concrete. Also the comparison between spacing factor of air bubbles and amount of materials scaled from surface at salt-frost scaling test according to SIST 1026 have been made for particular concrete mix...|$|E
40|$|Bonded joint {{is a very}} {{exacting}} system. Its {{quality and}} failure rate depends on many factors. Basic failures of bonded joints divide in adhesive and cohesive ones. When the breakaway between adhesive lay and bonded material occurs, it is adhesive failure. The presence of oxides and of not quite suitable wetted surface geometry is the reason. By a suitable mechanical pretreatment of a bonded surface the adhesive failure can be hindered. For tests two groups of materials were chosen, namely steel and aluminum alloys. The <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>tests</b> was the evaluation of roughness parameters change of steel, aluminum and duralumin surfaces using different grit of the abrasive cloth. Thanks to different material structure {{it was possible to}} determine the different effect of the same abrasives on the integrity of the grinded surface. Comparing the reached strength values the hypothesis was confirmed that the bonded surface mechanical pretreatment is one of key influences on the bonded joint primary strength. The analysis of reached data makes possible the formulation of optimum roughness parameters values with contemporary defining the abrasive cloth type. Lepený spoj je velmi náročný systém a jeho kvalita či poruchovost závisí na mnoha faktorech. Základní poruchy lepených spojů se dělí na adhezní a kohezní. Dojde-li k odtržení spoje mezi vrstvou lepidla a lepeným materiálem, jedná se o adhezní poruchu. Důvodem je přítomnost vrstvy oxidů a rovněž ne zcela vhodná geometrie smáčeného povrchu. Vhodnou mechanickou úpravou lepeného povrchu bývá zabráněno vzniku adhezívního porušení. V testu byly využity dvě skupiny materiálů, ocel a hliníkové slitiny. V článku je hodnocena závislost parametrů drsnosti ocelového, duralového a hliníkového povrchu na změně brusného plátna.
