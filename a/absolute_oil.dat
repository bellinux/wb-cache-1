40|$|Jasminum samabac {{is one of}} {{the ancient}} {{fragrant}} flowers cultivated globally. In spite of ornamental purpose it is also cultivated for extraction of essential oil which is accredited as king of fragrance. As it contributes in beautification of any garden or public place extraction of valuable products so a tremendous potential for the development of essential oil industry based on this plant. The current investigation were conducted to evaluate the effect of 24 -Epibrassinolide (EBL) on morphological, physiological, biochemical and reproductive behavior along with essential oil contents of Jasminum sambac. EBL was exogenically applied (foliar spray) in four concentrations i. e. 1, 2, 3 and 4 Ã¬M. 24 -Epibrassinolide (EBL) having concentration 2 Ã¬M performed better in almost all attributes including essential oil contents as compared to rest of treatments. On the other hand, SCFE optimization experiment, T 3 = 40 oC/ 100 Bar gave excellent results. Physio-chemical, yield attributes and chemical components identification through GCMS was exhibited promising outcomes. Comparative efficacy of different essential oil extraction techniques was also assessed. Essential oil was extracted by Supercritical Fluid extraction (SCFE) and hydro distillation. An optimized protocol was established for the extraction of essential oil from Jasminum sambac through supercritical fluid extraction (SCFE) technique. This technique performed better as compared to hydro distillation. In Supercritical Fluid extraction (SCFE), CO 2 was used as solvent for getting concrete oil. The concrete was processed to convert it to <b>absolute</b> <b>oil.</b> Jasminum sambac had concrete oil yield of 0. 334 %, whereas it had <b>absolute</b> <b>oil</b> yield of 0. 021 %. Physio-chemical studies of <b>absolute</b> <b>oil</b> were also conducted which indicated color as clear yellow to light brown, refractive index as 1. 49, specific gravity as 0. 964 and congealing point of the concrete as 20 Â°C. Different chemical components contained in the essential oil were identified by GC-MS analysis. The maximum number of chemical components identified from single essential oil sample was 35. The present studies revealed that Jasminum sambac can be successfully cultivated on commercial scale in the country for the extraction of essential oil with promising results...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{demand for}} fossil fuel for instance, {{oil and gas}} has been {{dramatic}} in recent decades. Therefore, many oil and gas companies are attempting to find out new technics for enhancing oil recovery for example, secondary and tertiary methods. Indeed, {{in recent years the}} interest in water alternating gas (WAG) has been increased as tertiary recovery method. Moreover, this method has been applied successfully in several fields around the world. In fact, the (WAG) injection method results in three-phase flow zones. Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} and well describing the multi-phase flow properties. This study investigated the uncertainty in multi-phase flow between pore-scale network modelling and empirical methods. Network models are being used as alternative for empirical methods to describe the multi-phase flow properties, since the former are physically-based tools which integrate the relevant pore-scale mechanisms while the latter often have little physical basis. The reservoir simulation has been employed to study the effect of rock heterogeneity on the <b>absolute</b> <b>oil</b> recovery obtained by empirical methods and pore network model during WAG injection in heterogeneous reservoirs. The results showed that rock heterogeneity could increase the three phase flow uncertainty between empirical methods and pore network modelling. Moreover; the investigation showed significant effect of rock heterogeneity (different relative permeability models) on overall WAG performance...|$|E
40|$|Against a {{backdrop}} of growing interest {{in the development of}} low carbon alternatives to petroleum derived liquid fuels, this paper provides an analysis of earlier experiences of the emergence and evolution of alternative liquid fuels. We argue such analyses can provide useful insights for future energy transitions and in particular the governance of such transitions. This paper focusses on two alternatives to petrol manufactured in the UK during the inter-war period (1918 - 1938). The two fuels were power alcohol, made by the Distillers Company Ltd. (DCL) and sold as Discol between 1921 and 1973, and a petrol-from-coal made by Imperial Chemical Industries Ltd. (ICI), which was blended with petroleum derived petrol and sold between 1935 and 1958. Here we examine the background to the emergence of these fuels, the actors involved and their combined roles. We find both fuels received government support during a time of rapid growth in the motor industry, fluctuating economic conditions, fears of <b>absolute</b> <b>oil</b> shortages, and the desire to develop the UK’s chemical industry. Both fuels were considerably affected by changing political thinking around energy security and oil major hegemony; governance of fuel distribution in particular had significant effects on both fuels. We discuss how changing modes of governance, between market and state logics, created hybrid governance conditions. These conditions reflected state intervention to support new fuels and a failure to regulate the market for fuel distribution. Therefore, whilst hybrid governance provided government with the flexibility to respond quickly to changing circumstances, unresolved tensions between policies made it more difficult for alternative fuels to thrive...|$|E

40|$|Different {{processing}} methods {{are required to}} extract essential oils from different plants. Most oils are extracted using steam distillation, during which the plant tissues break down, the essential oils and water vapor are released, then collected and cooled. The volatile essential oil condenses, separates and is easily isolated. In this process the steam is prepared in a separate chamber and piped into the tank. This is especially good for plant materials with high boiling point oils. Essential oils can be extracted using solvents. Hydro-distillation is not suitable for various products like delicately odored oils. There are three main ways {{that this can be}} performed. Solvent extraction is used when the odorous properties of delicate flower and plant material would be altered or destroyed by steam or water distillation or when a plant, for instance rose absolute and jasmine contains very little oil, making steam or water distillation impractical. Solvent extraction produces a concrete which in turn is refined into an absolute. The solvent dissolves the plants constituents including essential oils, fatty acids and waxes. The essential oil is extracted from the other constituents with alcohol. The fatty acids and waxes are not alcohol soluble so they are left behind. A secondary distillation then removes the alcohol, leaving the <b>absolute</b> <b>oil</b> behind. Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction uses carbon dioxide under extremely high pressure to extract essential oils. In the future, many botanicals that are not now available may possibly be obtained through carbon dioxide extraction. A fundamental study to design new types of extraction systems for essential oils and a trial steam distillation systems was made. After leaves of alpinia were harvested, steam distilled essential oils were analyzed. Heat transfer of the system were also discussed. Good extraction results and performance were observed with this apparatus.

40|$|As {{aircraft}} {{are designed to}} a greater extent on computers, the need for accurate and fast CFD algorithms has never been greater. The development of CFD algorithms requires experimental data against which CFD output can be validated and from which insight about flow physics can be acquired. Skin friction, in particular, is an important quantity to predict with CFD, and experimental skin friction data sets aid not only with the validation of the CFD predictions, but also in tuning the CFD models to predict specific flow fields. However, a practical experimental technique for collecting spatially and temporally resolved skin friction data on complex models does not yet exist. This dissertation develops and demonstrates a new luminescent oil film skin friction meter which can produce spatially-resolved quantitative steady and unsteady skin friction data on models with complex curvature. ^ The skin friction acting on the surface of a thin film of oil can be approximated by the expression τw =μ ouh/h, where μ o is the dynamic viscosity of the oil, uh is the velocity of the surface of the oil film, and h is the thickness of the oil film. The new skin friction meter determines skin friction by measuring h and uh. The oil film thickness h is determined by ratioing the intensity of the fluorescent emissions from the oil film with the intensity of the incident light which is scattered {{from the surface of the}} model. When properly calibrated, that ratio provides an <b>absolute</b> <b>oil</b> film thickness value. This oil film thickness meter is therefore referred as the Ratioed-Image Film-Thickness (RIFT) Meter. The oil film velocity uh is determined by monitoring the evolution of tagged molecules within the oil film: Photochromic molecules are dissolved into the fluorescent oil and a pattern is written into the oil film using an ultraviolet laser. The evolution of the pattern is recorded, and standard cross-correlation techniques are applied to the resulting sequence of images. This newly developed skin friction meter is therefore called the Luminescent Oil Film Flow-Tagging skin friction meter, or the LOFFT skin friction meter. The LOFFT skin friction meter is demonstrated by collecting time-averaged skin friction measurements on NASA 2 ̆ 7 s FAITH model and by collecting unsteady skin friction measurements with a frequency response of 600 Hz. Higher frequency response is possible and is dependent on the experimental setup. ^ This dissertation also contributes to the work done on the Global Luminescent Oil Film Skin Friction Meter (GLOFSFM) by noting that the technique could be influenced by ripples at the oil-air interface. An experiment studying the evolution of ripples at the oil-air interface was conducted to determine under what oil film conditions the GLOFSFM can be appropriately applied. The RIFT meter was crucial for this experiment, as it facilitated quantitative distributed oil film thickness measurements during the wind-tunnel run. The resulting data set is rich in content, permitting the computation of mean wavelengths, peak-to-trough ripple heights, wave speeds, and mean thicknesses. In addition to determining under what oil film conditions the GLOFSFM may be applied, this experiment directly determined the oil film conditions under which the velocity of the ripples may be used to proxy the velocity of the oil film surface. The RIFT meter and the ability to determine oil film surface velocity by monitoring ripple velocities admit yet another time-averaged skin friction meter, the Fluorescent-Oil Ripple-Velocity (FORV) skin friction meter. The FORV skin friction meter recovers skin friction as τ w = μovrip/H, where vrip is the velocity of the ripples, and H is the oil film thickness averaged over the thickness fluctuations due to the ripples. The FORV skin friction meter is demonstrated on NASA 2 ̆ 7 s FAITH model. ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the degree Master of Technology: Chemical Engineering In the Faculty of Engineering At the CAPE PENINSULA UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY 2013 A number of foods, pharmaceutical and industrial products are formulated as emulsions. The immiscibility of oil and water makes emulsions thermodynamically unstable, thus requiring emulsifiers. Natural and synthetic substances {{have been used as}} emulsifiers with preference for the former for safety, cost and availability purposes. Bambara groundnut (BGN) is an important source of nutrient in many African communities. Similar to soybean, flaxseed, and other leguminous products, the important blend of high protein and carbohydrate composition of BGN makes it a potential candidate as an emulsifier where, it can serve additional nutritional role in such emulsions. No literature evidence exists to support any earlier study on the potential emulsifying property of BGN. It is therefore of interest to investigate the potential of BGN flour (BGNF) and starch (BGNS) in stabilizing oil-in-water emulsions. The current study aimed to investigate the emulsifying properties of Bambara groundnut flour and starch. A batch of BGN was milled to produce the BGNF. BGNS was extracted from the BGNF. Emulsions were prepared using a wide range of flour-oil-water and starch-oil-water composition as generated through computational modelling. Emulsions were physically observed for stability, and then subjected to various stability studies using the Turbiscan® (which gives kinetic information on the process leading to phase separation; and allows for the detection of two kinds of destabilisation phenomena (particle migration) : creaming and sedimentation) and optical microscope (which helps to detect particle size variation or aggregation in order to measure coalescence and/or flocculation). The most stable emulsions (one BGNF-stabilized and the other BGNS-stabilzed) were determined and subjected to same stability studies in the presence of varying physicochemical and physic-mechanical environmental conditions: effects of homogenization speed (9, 000 – 21, 000 rpm), pH (2 - 10), the presence of salt (2 – 10 % w/v NaCl) and vinegar (2 – 10 % v/v). Results were expressed in terms of relative stability (using creaming/sedimentation rate) and <b>absolute</b> <b>oil</b> droplet growth (coalescence and flocculation). The emulsifier-oil compositions (emulsifier and water make 100 mL gelatinized mixture before the addition of oil) that gave the most stable emulsions were 9 g BGNF- 39 g oil and 5 g BGNS- 30 g oil. The two emulsions had only 15 % and 30 % growth in oil droplet diameter respectively by day 5, compared to over 3000 % in the unstable ones. The emulsions were generally observed physically to be stable till day 5 with minimal creaming. Emulsions prepared with BGNS were physically observed to have increasing viscosity with time. There was microbial growth on the emulsions after 3 days. This might have been encouraged because of the rich nutritional composition of BGN. The stability of the emulsions increased significantly (p < 0. 05) with the speed of homogenization (up to 15, 000 rpm beyond which the difference in stability was not significant). Compared to control (pH 7), emulsion stability decreased significantly (p < 0. 05) with decreasing (up to 16 % instability by Day- 5 at pH 2) and increasing pH (10 % instability at pH 10) with corresponding increase in droplet size. Emulsion stability increased significantly (p < 0. 05) with increasing NaCl concentration (35 % instability at 2 % NaCl compared to 18 % instability at 10 % NaCl). Stability however decreased sharply with increasing concentration of vinegar (55 % instability at 10 % vinegar compared to 19 % instability at 2 % vinegar). The BGNF-stabilized emulsions were more stable (ordinarily and {{in the presence of the}} additives) than the BGNS-stabilized ones. Instability values in the BGNS emulsions, in most cases, double those for BGNF. Emulsions were successfully stabilized with BGNF and BGNS. The emulsions were optimal when prepared at a homogenization speed of 15, 000 rpm and at neutral pH. The higher the concentration of salt, the more stable the emulsions. Increasing concentration of vinegar however, destabilized the emulsions...|$|E

In our case the direct puncture of haemangioma and sclerotherapy with ethanol proved to be a safe and effective method to achieve preoperative devascularization of the lesion. Direct puncture of the lesion is not limited by the anatomy of the vessels or vasospasm, which can occur during the intra-arterial approach...|$|R
40|$|Definitions {{of fossil}} fuel {{reserves}} and resources and assessed stock data are reviewed and clarified. Semantics explain a large stake {{of conflict between}} advocate and critical voices on peak oil. From a holistic sources-sinks perspective, limited carrying capacity of atmospheric sinks, not <b>absolute</b> scarcity in <b>oil</b> resources, will impose tight constraints on oil use. Eventually observed peaks in oil production in nearby years will result from politically imposed limits on carbon emissions, and not be caused by physical lack of oil resources. Peak-oil belief induces passive climate policy attitudes when suggesting carbon dioxide emissions will peak naturally linked to dwindling oil supplies. Active policies for reducing emissions and use of fossil fuels will also encompass higher energy end-use prices. Revenues obtained from higher levies on oil use can support financing energy efficiency and renewable energy options. But when oil producers charge the higher prices they can pump new oil for many decades, postponing peak oil to occur while extending carbon lock-in.

40|$|In {{order to}} offer {{scientific}} bases {{for the application}} of oil bodies from peanut in food, this research was undertaken to study the size and charge stability of oil bodies from five peanut varieties. It showed that the mean diameter of oil bodies from yuhua 9719 and yuhua 9830 is obviously larger than yuhua 23, yuhua 27, and yuhua 9502 in the peanut cell. Moreover, the analysis of diameter distribution of oil bodies also showed that the median diameter of oil bodies increased dramatically in the order of yuhua 9719 > yuhua 9830 > yuhua 23 > yuhua 27 > yuhua 9502 after aqueous extraction. The charge stability of oil bodies from peanut was observed with zeta (ζ) potential measurements, which indicated that charge properties and the <b>absolute</b> value of <b>oil</b> bodies from five peanut varieties were significantly affected by pH and salt concentration, but the degree of influence is different. Of the five peanut varieties, yuhua 27 and yuhua 9830 possessed excellent charge stability (ζ-potential > 35 [*]mV) in neutral microenvironment without salt concentration...|$|R
40|$|Biomarkers {{extracted}} from oil-bearing fluid inclusions provide a novel tracer of biological evolution through Earth’s history. We present {{case studies of}} Palaeoproterozoic conglomeratic sandstones that straddle the “Great Oxidation Event” from the ca. 2. 45 Ga uraniferous Matinenda Formation at Elliot Lake, Canada, and the ca. 2. 1 Ga FA Formation from the Franceville Basin, Gabon, which is famous for hosting the Oklo natural nuclear fission reactors. In both cases oil was trapped together with aqueous and carbonic fluids in inclusions in cements and in microfractures within framework quartz grains. In the Matinenda Formation entrapment occurred during diagenesis and early metamorphism. In the FA Formation the oil was trapped during diagenesis and also after cementation at temperatures of and above 250 °C possibly linked to reactor functioning. Inclusion oil from the Matinenda Formation contains typical hydrocarbons of oils, including isoprenoids, hopanes, 2 α-methylhopanes and sterane biomarkers at levels well above outside rinses and system blanks. The FA Formation analyte also contains these biomarkers, but by comparison with a solid bitumen extract is interpreted to be a mixture of recalcitrant solid bitumen and fluid inclusion oil. The hydrocarbons were likely sourced locally from organic-rich horizons, such as the black shales of the Francevillian FB Formation and the organic-rich Huronian McKim Formation, within the host sequences. The 2 α-methylhopanes indicate oxygen-producing cyanobacteria, and the steranes indicate a significant contribution from eukaryotes. The Matinenda data suggest that some aquatic settings were sufficiently oxygenated to support sterol synthesis before the “Great Oxidation Event”. Furthermore, prokaryotes and eukaryotes flourished {{to such an extent}} that they produced one of the world’s earliest large sedimentary accumulations of organic matter within the FB Formation shortly after the “Great Oxidation Event”. When constrained by relative and <b>absolute</b> dating, <b>oil</b> trapped inside fluid inclusions has the potential to provide a pristine record of Earth’s early ecosystems. 1 page(s...|$|R
