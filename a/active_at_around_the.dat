50|$|Some 1.8 {{billion years}} of {{weathering}} and deformation {{made it difficult}} to prove that a meteor was the cause of the Sudbury geological structures. A further difficulty in proving that the Sudbury complex was formed by meteor impact rather than by ordinary igneous processes was that the region was volcanically <b>active</b> <b>at</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> same time as the impact, and some weathered volcanic structures can look like meteor collision structures. Since its discovery, a layer of breccia has been found associated with the impact event and stressed rock formations have been fully mapped.|$|E

40|$|The {{workplace}} {{is an ideal}} setting to promote physical activity. The {{purpose of this study}} is to examine associations with physical activity <b>at</b> and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> workplace. Participants were recruited from a random sample of employed adults (n = 1; 107) in capital cities and major regional centres in Australia. Self-reported barriers and participation in physical activity <b>at</b> and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> workplace were assessed. A multivariable logistic regression model adjusting for age, sex, occupational status, and overall physical activity assessed the odds of being active in this setting. Of participants, 61 percent perceived being active in the workplace. Those who perceived their work colleagues and managers to be physically active, and those who indicated that their workplace provides facilities to support them being active had higher odds of being physically <b>active</b> <b>at</b> or <b>around</b> <b>the</b> workplace. A poor response rate, physically active sample and cross-sectional analysis prevent inferences about the causality of the findings. The paper provides evidence of the potential for the multiple levels of influence on physical activity <b>at</b> and <b>around</b> <b>the</b> workplace...|$|R

40|$|The former {{occurrence}} of the North Atlantic right whale Eubalaena glacialis on the Portuguese coast may be inferred from the historical range of that species in Europe and in NW Africa. It is generally accepted {{that it was the}} main prey of coastal whaling in the Middle Ages and in the pre-modern period, but this assumption still needs firming up based on biological and archaeological evidence. We describe the skeletal remains of right whales excavated at Peniche in 2001 - 2002, in association with archaeological artefacts. The whale bones were covered by sandy sediments on the old seashore and they have been tentatively dated <b>around</b> <b>the</b> 16 th to 17 th centuries. This study contributes material evidence to the former {{occurrence of}} E. glacialis in Portugal (West Iberia). Some whale bones show unequivocal man-made scars. These are associated to wounds from instruments with a sharp-cutting blade. This evidence for past human interaction may suggest that whaling for that species was <b>active</b> <b>at</b> Peniche <b>around</b> <b>the</b> early 17 th century...|$|R

Since the ship was assigned non-rotational deployment, that is, permanently assigned to support operations in Vietnam, the individual crew members were assigned and transferred on a 12-14 month deployment although it is known that some received assignments much longer. It is also known that some of the crew members requested back-to-back tours on Annapolis.|$|R
50|$|However, {{the case}} {{was the subject of}} intense {{international}} media attention because it shined a spotlight on the cloning issue and the emerging and enormously promising field of stem cell research. It was also the catalyst for Siegel to trade in his 30-year courtroom career to found the Genetics Policy Institute (now called the Regenerative Medicine Foundation). The Regenerative Medicine Foundation is now a world leader in supporting the global cause of stem cell research by promoting sound, ethical research within a framework of supportive public policy. The institute does this through public education initiatives, meetings among experts and activists, its comprehensive website and published information, and sponsorship of the Student Society for Stem Cell Research. In only thee years’ time, the SSSCR has grown into an education and advocacy organization having a presence in 15 countries, 35 states, 100 institutions and more than 25 <b>active</b> chapters <b>at</b> universities <b>around</b> <b>the</b> country.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{observed}} Higgs boson mass poses a new puzzle {{in addition}} to the longstanding problem of the origin of the electroweak scale; the shallowness of the Higgs potential. The Higgs quartic coupling even seems to vanish <b>at</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Planck scale within the uncertainties of the top quark mass and the strong gauge coupling. We show that the shallowness of the Higgs potential might be an outcome of supersymmetry breaking <b>at</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> Planck scale.
