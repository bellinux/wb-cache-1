40|$|International audienceSources, {{pathways}} and reservoirs of microplastics, plastic particles {{smaller than}} 5 mm, remain poorly documented {{in an urban}} context. While some studies pointed out wastewater treatment plants as a potential pathway of microplastics, none {{have focused on the}} <b>atmospheric</b> <b>compartment.</b> In this work, the atmospheric fallout of microplastics was investigated in two different urban and sub-urban sites. Microplastics were collected continuously with a stainless steel funnel. Samples were then filtered and observed with a stereomicroscope. Fibers accounted for almost all the microplastics collected. An atmospheric fallout between 2 and 355 particles/m 2 /day was highlighted. Registered fluxes were systematically higher at the urban than at the sub-urban site. Chemical characterization allowed to estimate at 29 % the proportion of these fibers being all synthetic (made with petrochemicals), or a mixture of natural and synthetic material. Extrapolation using weight and volume estimates of the collected fibers, allowed a rough estimation showing that between 3 and 10 tons of fibers are deposited by atmospheric fallout at the scale of the Parisian agglomeration every year (2500 km²). These results could serve the scientific community working on the different sources of microplastic in both continental and marine environments...|$|E

Airborne high {{resolution}} in situ measurements {{of a large}} set of trace gases including ozone (O 3) and total water (H 2 O) in the upper troposphere and the lowermost stratosphere (UT/LMS) have been performed above Europe within the SPURT project. SPURT provides an extensive data coverage of the UT/LMS in each season within the time period between November 2001 and July 2003. In the LMS a distinct spring maximum and autumn minimum is observed in O 3, whereas its annual cycle in the UT is shifted by 2 – 3 months later {{towards the end of}} the year.

A lumped conceptual model, incorporating a dormant season NO 3 -N flush, was proposed that explains forest response to decreased deposition and sheds light on the hydrologic processes that govern the storage/release of NO 3 -N among years.

40|$|International audienceDifferent {{transformation}} {{processes for}} nitrophenols in the atmospheric aqueous phase {{were considered to}} assess their relative importance, {{and their ability to}} account for the higher occurrence of 4 -nitrophenol (4 NP) compared to 2 -nitrophenol (2 NP) in the atmosphere. The importance of the different processes was in the order •OH >•NO 3 > direct photolysis > nitration to 2, 4 -dinitrophenol. 2 NP is more reactive than 4 NP with the hydroxyl radical, but the difference is low. Accordingly, such a process could account for the higher atmospheric occurrence of 4 NP only if the observed atmospheric nitrophenols were what was left of an almost complete degradation by •OH. This would imply the unlikely scenario that the known nitrophenol sources to the atmosphere were only a limited fraction of the actual ones. A more likely, tentative possibility would be connected with the higher occurrence of 4 NP on particles. If the reactivity order of nitrophenols in the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>compartments</b> was water droplets > gas phase > particles, particulate matter could act as a reservoir of 4 NP. 2 NP would undergo degradation in gas phase or solution at a higher rate than 4 NP on particles, which could decrease the atmospheric levels of 2 NP below those of 4 NP...|$|R

The goal {{of this study was}} to identify the importance of atmospheric fluxes to occurence of PAHs in the estuary, and to estimate the major pathways of their transport and accumulation within this ecosystem. The annual atmospheric inputs in the estuary ranged from 2. 5 to 16 kg for the first sampling year, which is high when compared to those calculated for other European locations. In parallel, PAH transport from the atmosphere to the watershed outlet was investigated for two rural and urban small experimental watersheds within the Seine Estuary. In rural areas, atmospheric inputs are higher than exported loads by surface water and PAHs are accumulating in soils. The inverse occurs in urban areas, where the contribution of atmospheric deposition is negligible ompared with PAH exported loads by runoff. These results allowed us to establish a mass balance for PAHs on the scale of the Seine Estuary, and to determine the dynamics of PAH transport. This study highlights the role of the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>compartment</b> in the transfer of contaminants and the importance of the local PAH inputs within the Seine Estuary...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} 25 years, {{research}} in atmospheric chemistry and physics {{has been marked}} by the evolution of stratospheric ozone and by the impact of increasing levels of greenhouse gases on climate.

Located in the south-western part of the Indian Ocean at 20. 8 °S and 55. 5 °E, Reunion Island is well located to produce data to improve our knowledge of these atmospheric processes in the subtropics. Lidar observations detailed in this paper are Raman water vapor lidar and tropospheric ozone DIAL systems, which produce water vapor and ozone profiles over the whole free troposphere. In order to increase the number, range and quality of observations, the instruments will be modified and transferred to the Maïdo Facility at 2200 m above the sea level in 2012.

40|$|International audienceThe coastal {{ocean is}} a crucial link between land, the open ocean and the atmosphere. The shallowness of the water column permits close {{interactions}} between the sedimentary, aquatic and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>compartments,</b> which otherwise are decoupled at long time scales (congruent to 1000 yr) in the open oceans. Despite the prominent role of the coastal oceans in absorbing atmospheric CO(2) and transferring it into the deep oceans via the continental shelf pump, the underlying mechanisms remain only partly understood. Evaluating observations from the North Sea, a NW European shelf sea, we provide evidence that anaerobic degradation of organic matter, fuelled from land and ocean, generates total alkalinity (AT) and increases the CO(2) buffer capacity of seawater. At both the basin wide and annual scales anaerobic AT generation in the North Sea's tidal mud flat area irreversibly facilitates 7 - 10 %, or taking into consideration benthic denitrification in the North Sea, 20 - 25 % of the North Sea's overall CO(2) uptake. At the global scale, anaerobic AT generation could be accountable {{for as much as}} 60 % of the uptake of CO(2) in shelf and marginal seas, making this process, the anaerobic pump, a key player in the biological carbon pump.

SPURT provides an extensive data coverage of the UT/LMS in each season within the time period between November 2001 and July 2003.

The more variable H 2 O measurements reveal a maximum during summer and a minimum during autumn/winter with no phase shift between the two <b>atmospheric</b> <b>compartments.</b> For a comprehensive insight into trace gas composition and variability in the UT/LMS several statistical methods are applied using chemical, thermal and dynamical vertical coordinates. In particular, 2 -dimensional probability distribution functions serve as a tool to transform localised aircraft data to a more comprehensive view of the probed atmospheric region. It appears that both trace gases, O 3 and H 2 O, reveal the most compact arrangement and are best correlated in the view of potential vorticity (PV) and distance to the local tropopause, indicating an advanced mixing state on these surfaces. Thus, strong gradients of PV seem to act as a transport barrier both in the vertical and the horizontal direction. The alignment of trace gas isopleths reflects the existence of a year-round extra-tropical tropopause transition layer. The SPURT measurements reveal that this layer is mainly affected by stratospheric air during winter/spring and by tropospheric air during autumn/summer. Normalised mixing entropy values for O 3 and H 2 O in the LMS appear to be maximal during spring and summer, respectively, indicating highest variability of these trace gases during the respective seasons...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe plastic {{production}} has increased rapidly from 1. 7 to 288 million tons annually {{within the last}} 60 years (PlasticsEurope 2013). In the early 70 ’s, the presence of millimetric plastic debris in marine environment has been highlighted and more recently the term microplastics was used to describe millimetric and inframillimetric particles. Since 2008, plastic particles smaller than 5 mm have been defined as microplastics (Barnes et al. 2009). These microplastics cover a large and continuous spectrum of sizes and shapes including 1 D-fibers (with one larger dimension), 2 D-fragments (flat particles), and 3 D-spherules. While numerous studies were published on microplastic in marine environment, only few are dealing with these pollutants in continental environments. Moreover most of these studies are dealing with lakes and rivers, but none focused on the contamination of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>compartment</b> by microplastics. In addition to experimentations on total atmospheric fallout (Dris et al. 2015 a), this study aims at investigating the contamination of indoor and outdoor air by microplastics. Indoor air concentrations of microplastics (number of particles/m 3) were measured in 2 private apartments and 1 office at the Paris-Est University. Volumes about 5 m 3 over a 24 h-period were pumped using a Deltanova pump (8 L/min) on glass fiber GF/A Whatman® filters (1. 6 µm). In addition, household dust was also sampled using conventional vacuum cleaner and collected in the vacuum cleaner bag. Outdoor air samples were collected on the University roof located in an urbanized area (about 10 km from Paris center) and about 10 m 3 were pumped over a same period. In both cases, the total dust sampling modes were considered. Filters were then observed with a stereomicroscope Leica MZ 12 coupled with a software for image analyzing to account microplastics. For methodological reasons, the minimal microplastic particle size considered {{in this study is}} about 50 µm. For dust, a densimetric separation coupled with an enzymatic digestion was performed. Microplastics observed in indoor and outdoor air are exclusively fibrous with a size distribution. Fibers are mainly sub-millimetric (50 - 80 % between 100 and 500 µm) {{and to a lesser extent}} millimetric (10 - 30 % between 500 and 1 000 µm or between 1 000 and 5 000 µm). First campaigns indicate that indoor concentrations are in the 3 - 15 particles/m 3 range. A gradient of indoor concentrations according to the sampling height (30, 125 and 250 cm) was also observed suggesting that the microplastics are mainly re suspended from the floor probably due to human activity and movement. Finally, a significant amount of fibers is observed in dust. Outdoor concentrations are lower than those observed for indoor and are in the 0. 2 - 0. 8 particles/m 3 range. Due to their size, a high deposition velocity of microplastics may be expected and could explain the low concentrations observed. Parallel to that, a significant amount of particles is also observed in total atmospheric fallout (29 - 280 particles/m 2 /d), confirming the contamination of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>compartment</b> by microplastics. The time-variation of this flux seems to be strongly influenced by rain events suggesting that the microplastic wash out could be a major route of deposition. The chemical identification of the microplastics is in progress using Raman micro spectroscopy...|$|E
40|$|Persistent {{bioaccumulative}} {{contaminants in}} pristine, remote regions like the Arctic are {{of great concern}} due to the hazard they pose to the ecosystems. These substances have been transported to the Arctic via atmosphere, ocean currents, rivers or biota (migratory birds or mammals). At least for semivolatile organic compounds on global to medium scales, long-range transport is most efficient in the atmosphere. For the first time, a three dimensional atmosphere global general circulation model (ECHAM 4 and ECHAM 5), is used, to study the long-range transport of persistent organic pollutants, and their fate in the multimedia environment. ECHAM 4 used a horizontal resolution of 3. 75 ° x 3. 75 °, and ECHAM 5 2. 8 ° x 2. 8 °. Both of them use a terrain following 19 level vertical resolution, 1000 - 10 hPa. The models comprise a fully developed <b>atmospheric</b> <b>compartment,</b> soil with a 'bucket model' hydrology, two-dimensional vegetation surface and a mixed layer ocean. The transport and fate of two persistent organic pollutants, DDT and γ-HCH, which are subject to regulations, were studied. These two agrochemicals differ considerably in their physico-chemical properties. DDT is more lipophilic while γ-HCH is more hydrophilic. Similar trends of multicompartmental behaviour were predicted by both versions of the model. Model experiments show that, while the strongest emission occurs in the tropics, the Arctic is contaminated. This long-range transport was quantified. The long-range transport potential of γ-HCH is {{higher than that of}} DDT.

Although no risks are indicated using the freshwater and marine PNEC for any scenario, there are still some uncertainties over the potential effects of bisphenol-A on snails, despite the thorough testing undertaken as part of the conclusion (i) programme. The human health risk assessment for Bisphenol-A concludes that there is concern forworkers. This conclusion is reached in relation to repeated dose systemic effects and for reproductive toxicity during the manufacture of BPA and the manufacture of epoxy resins. In addition, there are concerns for skin sensitisation in all occupational exposure scenarios where there is the potential for skin contact with high concentrations (> 30 %) of BPA.

40|$|In {{this chapter}} {{our goal is}} to {{highlight}} some of the many ways that urbanization affects the water budget and water cycle. A water budget describes the stores or volumes of water in the surface, subsurface and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>compartments</b> of the environment over a chosen increment of time. The water cycle has to do with char-acterizing the flow paths and flow rates of water from one store to another. Under-standing how urbanization affects the water budget and water cycle first requires an appreciation of how conditions work in a natural system. The sun drives the hydrologic cycle, whereby water is evaporated by solar radia-tion from oceans, inland water bodies and soil, condenses and falls on land as precip-itation, and returns to receiving water bodies by either surface runoff or groundwater discharge (Fig. 2. 1). There are many critical sub cycles within the overall hydrologic cycle. For example, a portion of precipitation is returned to the atmosphere by evap-oration before it reaches the ground. A portion of precipitation that is stored on veg-etation (interception storage), on the land surface in puddles (depression storage), or in shallow soil pores, also evaporates rather than moving downward to ground-water or running off to surface water channels. Precipitation infiltrating the soil that is not lost to evaporation can flow downward to recharge groundwater, contributing to a rise in the water table, or flow shallowly in a lateral direction and discharge to streams. Flow in streams that is not due to surface or shallow subsurface runoff from the land is termed base flow; base flow in natural systems arises from deep and shallow groundwater discharging to streams during both storm and non-storm periods. A water budget or water mass balance can be calculated for any time increment for a chosen control volume, wher...|$|R

Riverine waters are important input pathways of water-soluble organic compounds that potentially {{contribute to the}} dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool. Here, we report the first ever measurements of bi-functional carboxylic acids such as α, ω -dicarboxylic acids (or diacids) and related polar compounds ω -oxoacids (or ketoacids) (BCAs = α, ω-dicarboxylic acids + ω -oxoacids), along with the DOC levels in Rhone River waters. Surface water samples were collected from February 2006 to June 2009 approximately 50 km above the Rhone River mouth, which is the main supplier of freshwater to the Mediterranean Sea. The BCA concentrations averaged 32. 4 ± 15. 3 µg l− 1, and exhibited {{a wide range of}} values from 13. 2 µg l− 1 (Spring 2008) to 71. 2 µg l− 1 (winter 2007). The contribution of carbon from BCAs to the DOC pool (BCA-C) accounted for 0. 28 to 1. 42 % of the DOC. Although no seasonal trend was evident in the studied period, our results showed that the highest BCA concentrations did not always follow high water discharges. α,ω -dicarboxylic acids are the most abundant compound class (20. 7 ± 10. 6 µg l− 1), which is followed by ω -oxoacids (11. 7 ± 6. 2 µg l− 1). The Rhone River was estimated to deliver between 1. 37 and 16. 4 t d− 1 of BCA to the Gulf of Lions. Assuming a mean water discharge of ∼ 1790 m 3 s− 1, a broad estimate suggests a loading of 750 – 4000 t yr− 1 BCAs to the northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Our results indicated that glyoxylic acid (ωC 2) was the most abundant BCA followed by oxalic acid (C 2 di) and fumaric acid (trans configuration of unsaturated C 4 diacid). This result indicates that there is a different molecular distribution between the aquatic and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>compartments,</b> including rainwaters and aerosols, for which previous studies highlighted a predominance of oxalic acid, which was followed by malonic and/or succinic acid. Runoff and riverine biological process (rather than photochemical oxidation reactions) are hypothesized to control the BCA occurrence and molecular distribution in the Rhone River and thus their inputs to the coastal NW Mediterranean Sea, although the environmental implications of this stock of BCA are still unknown.

40|$|Modeling {{plant growth}} and {{development}} underwent considerable development with strong incentives from various consortia. It emerged as an efficient tool in ecology and genetics to face new challenges raised by competition for resources and to benefit from breakthroughs in biotechnology. In this presentation, we propose a classification of approaches used in modeling plants based on our experience at the Laboratoire d'Ecophysiologie des Plantes sous Stress Environnementaux (Montpellier, France). We present 5 types of models and discuss how they participate in a general workflow aimed at designing plant ideotypes for future climates. Type 1 are frameworks for spatiotemporal analysis of {{growth and development}}. They consist in quantitative description of when and where growth occurs in a specific organ, or how growth is synchronized between organs at whole plant level or, more generally, how development occurs. They are developed almost systematically when a novel species or organ are to be studied in the lab, as they are critical to set up experimental designs (what to measure, when, [...] .) or to reason the sampling of tissues for omics studies (which part of the organ should be taken, when). Type 2 are data-driven (statistical) representations of {{the responses to the}} environment and of determinant of growth. Often based on specialized statistical methods (multivariate analysis, structural equation models, mixed models, [...] .), they allow us to formalize responses, reveal linkages and hierarchies between processes or multiple factors affecting growth, and demonstrate causalities between them. They are used as such to produce synthetic representations of growth processes or decipher between genetic and environmental effects. They are also used as bases for building other types of models. Type 3 are empirical models of response to environmental factors specially designed for parameterizations in high throughput phenotyping. This entails parsimony in the parameterization (hence in input variables), high heritability of parameters (traits) and compatibility with high throughput measurements. Such models have proved to be very efficient in genetic studies, for characterizing allelic diversity or finding QTLs. They also are ready to use and genetically well parameterized components for more integrative models. Type 4 are computer-assisted simulation models, used to make predictions a priori. They are based on hypothetical frames of integration of biological processes within the plant, and on physical models for the interactions with soil and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>compartments.</b> They allow simulation of complex system (cropmodels). They are used in the lab to simulate the behavior of plants in different climatic scenarios and thus to assess the relevance of a given set of traits for a given location. They are also produced to help reasoning agricultural practices, and especially irrigation. Type 5 are computer simulation models, used to reconstruct or interpret experiments a posteriori. Such models are designed to be fitted to experimental data, either to compute hidden variables (like sink strengths, radiation interception and efficiency), interpolate variables of interest from fragmental inputs in time or space (e. g. LAI time course) or interpret a macroscopic response by extracting meaningful parameters (e. g. hydraulic characteristics from difference in growth kinetics). During this presentation, new challenges are proposed to modelers in each type of models. They consist in bottlenecks which currently hamper plant scientists from achieving multiple goals in biology, ecology, agronomy or breeding...|$|R

40|$|POPs are a {{group of}} {{chemicals}} which share some specific characterictics, that make them of high international concern. Due to their semivolatility, POPs present a widespread distribution being able to reach remote locations and areas after traveling long distances in the atmosphere where {{they have never been}} produced nor used. Different chemical families are considered as POPs, such as PCBs, OCPs, PCDD/Fs, PAHs, and, PCNs. In addition, some emerging contaminants are currently considered as candidate POPs, like PBDEs and PFCs. POPs exist in the atmosphere as gases and bound to particles depending on their physico-chemical properties. This affinity to gas or particulate phase is of relevant importance in the processes of POP atmospheric global transport and degradation. POPs are delivered to aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems by atmospheric deposition, air-water interchanges and direct discharges. The general hydrophobic nature of POPs results in high affinity to organic matter and biota tissues. Consequently, organisms and sediments become final sinks of POPs, due to low metabolic activity for these compounds and slow degradation processes in the environment. A number of national and international actions have been promoted to reduce or ban their production and control their emissions to the environment. The UNEP Stockholm Convention adopted in May 2001. The Artic Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) is measuring atmospheric concentrations of POPs in the artic region since it was established in 1991. At a European scale a big effort is being carried out combining the update of existing monitoring programmes with the generation of new legislations. Such is the case of the largest monitoring network across Europe gathering concentrations of POPs in air and deposition (EMEP). On the political side, the brand new European legislation on chemicals, REACH, will regulate the production of chemicals at a European scale. In addition, other POPs monitoring programmes exist at regional or national scales and a large number of;independent; sites measuring atmospheric concentrations of POPs are spread out in the European geography. Considering such a scenario it seems obvious that a strong effort in harmonization and communication of results and monitoring and research strategies needs to be achieved. A step to facilitate this needed interaction was the workshop on;Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) in the European Atmosphere; Concentration, Deposition and Sources in Europe; organized by the European Commission Joint Research Center held in October 17 - 19 th, 2005 in Stresa (Italy). It was one of the objectives of the workshop to gather top experts from Europe and North America to share their expertise on POP monitoring and research in the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>compartment</b> in order to evaluate their current status in Europe. Invited experts develop their professional activities either in the existing POPs monitoring networks or in research institutions closely linked to POPs research. Other objectives of the workshop were to explore future research lines on the topic and to establish links with the existing science and new policies in Europe regarding chemicals. Twenty oral communications were presented covering relevant key issues on POPs: In this report a compilation of the extended abstracts submitted by the participants is presented, whereas the working result output of the workshop will be submitted as an article to a peer-reviewed scientific journal.

40|$|Soils play an {{important}} role in the biogeochemical cycle of mercury as a sink for and source of this metallic species to <b>atmospheric</b> and hydrological <b>compartments.</b> In the study reported here, various types of soil were evaluated to ascertain the influence of parameters such as pH, organic matter content, Fe, Al, sand, silt, clay, C/H, C/N, C/O atomic ratios, and cation exchange capacity on the distribution of Hg in Amazonia's mid-Negro River basin. The data obtained were interpreted by multivariate exploratory analyses (hierarchical cluster analysis and principal component analysis), which indicated that organic matter plays {{an important}} role in mercury uptake in the various soils studied. The soils in floodable areas were found to contain 1. 5 to 2. 8 -fold higher Hg concentrations than those in non-floodable areas. Since these soils are flooded almost year-round, they are less available to participate in redox processes at the soil/atmosphere interface. Hence, floodable areas, which comprise humic-rich soils, accumulate more mercury than non-floodable soils, thus playing an important role in the biogeochemical cycle of Hg in Amazonia's mid-Negro River basin...|$|R
40|$|Die vorliegende Arbeit befasst sich mit der analytischen Untersuchung von leichtflüchtigen organischen Verbindungen (VOCs) mittels gekoppelter Gaschromatographie–Isotopenverhältnismassenspektrometrie (GC–C–IRMS) und der numerischen Auswertung der gemessenen Chromatogramme. Besonderes Augenmerk wird hierbei auf das Verhältnis der stabilen Kohlenstoffisotope 13 C/ 12 C (abgekürzt δ 13 C) gelegt. Der an einem Ort gemessene δ 13 C–Wert eines VOCs ermöglicht Rückschlüsse auf die Ausbreitung atmosphärischer Spurengase und liefert einen Einblick in atmosphärische Mischungsvorgänge und photochemische Abbaureaktionen. Für das GC–C–IRMS/MS Instrument wurde die Entwicklung einer Messmethode zur Analyse großvolumiger Luftproben mit VOC Mischungsverhältnissen im Bereich weniger pptV bis ppbV vorangetrieben. Erstmals wurden die Auswirkungen der verschiedenen Möglichkeiten der Probenübergabe vom thermischen Desorptionssystem auf das Kaltaufgabesystem untersucht. Weiterhin wird beschrieben, wie durch einen Umbau am thermischen Desorptionssystem der sich negativ auf die Chromatographie auswirkende Einfluss des in der Probe enthaltenden Wassers vermindert werden kann. Ein Verfahren für die Bestimmung der in der Probe enthaltenden VOC Volumenmischungsverhältnisse aus den Signalen des IRMS wurde unter Zuhilfenahme eines dynamischen Gasmischsystems umgesetzt. Die Entwicklung der arbeitsgruppeninternen Software Peaks hinsichtlich der automatisierten Analyse chromatographischer Daten wurde fortgeführt. Verbesserungen der bestehenden Algorithmen konnten in Bereichen der Datenglättung, Einzelpeakerkennung und Normpeakerzeugung mittels Hauptkomponentenanalyse erzielt werden. Neu implementiert wurde die Berechnung der δ 13 C Isotopenverhältnisse aus den Chromatogrammdaten heraus. Die entwickelten und verbesserten Analysemethoden fanden bei der Auswertung von Luftproben der dt. –span. Flugzeugkampagne VERDRILLT (VERtical Distribution of Radicals In the Lower Layers of the Troposphere) Anwendung. Die zwischen dem 26. 08. und 28. 08. 2010 in Spanien mit SilcoCan™ Behältern gewonnenen 28 Luftproben mit jeweils etwa 24   l n Probenvolumen wurden im Labor der Atmosphärenphysik in Wuppertal analysiert. Aus den identifizierten 36 VOC Komponenten stachen insbesondere sauerstoffhaltige Spezies der Aldehyde, Alkohole und Ketone hervor, von denen angenommen wird, sie haben ihren Ursprung in den Emissionen von Biokraftstoffen und deren Verbrennungsprodukten. Eine detaillierte Diskussion der δ 13 C Ergebnisse und, wenn verfügbar, der bestimmten Mischungsverhältnisse wird für Acetaldehyd (- 44, 5  ±  1, 3)  ‰, Methanol (- 44, 2  ±  3, 0)  ‰, Aceton (- 29, 2  ±  1, 7)  ‰, Kohlenstoffdisulfid mit Häufungspunkten bei (- 33, 3  ±  3, 3)  ‰ und (- 11, 3  ±  2, 5)  ‰, 2, 3 –Butandion (- 27, 5  ±  3, 0)  ‰, n–Butanal (- 39, 5  ±  3, 2)  ‰ und Toluol (- 28, 4  ±  4, 5)  ‰ vorgenommen. In dieser Arbeit werden zum ersten Mal atmosphärische δ 13 C Messwerte von n–Butanal, 2, 3 –Butandion, Isopropanol (- 22, 8  ±  3, 8)  ‰, Kohlenstoffdisulfid und Methylacetat (- 32, 2  ±  3, 2)  ‰ präsentiert. Für die Substanzen Fluortrichlormethan (- 36, 7  ±  4, 2)  ‰, n–Hexanal (- 28, 9  ±  4, 8)  ‰, Methylethylketon (36, 9  ±  2, 5)  ‰, n–Pentanal (- 31, 3  ±  4, 9)  ‰ und β–Pinen (- 29, 3  ±  3, 1)  ‰ werden die zweiten verfügbaren δ 13 C Datensätze aufgeführt. Auffallend ist, dass die in dieser Arbeit vorgestellten δ 13 C–Isotopenverhältnisse für Acetaldehyd, Fluortrichlormethan, n–Pentan, Methylethylketon und β–Pinen kleiner sind als die bisher bekannten Daten. Die Daten für n–Butan (- 36, 8  ±  4, 6)  ‰ schließen eine Lücke in den bekannten Literaturwerten. Die hier gefundenen Ergebnisse für n–Hexanal und n–Pentanal tendieren im Vergleich zu den bereits bekannten Literaturdaten zu etwas höheren Werten. The present work {{deals with}} the {{analytical}} study of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by means of coupled gas chromatography isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC–C–IRMS) and the numerical analysis of the measured chromatograms. Particular attention {{is given to the}} ratio of the stable carbon isotopes 13 C/ 12 C (δ 13 C abbreviated). The measured δ 13 C value of a VOC at a place allows conclusions about the spread of atmospheric trace gases and provides insight into atmospheric mixing processes and photochemical degradation. For the given GC–C–IRMS/MS instrument the development of a measuring method for the analysis of large volume air samples with VOC mixing ratios in the range of a few pptv to some ppbv was promoted. For the first time the impact of various options for sample transfer from the thermal desorption system on to the cold injection system were investigated. Furthermore a description is given of how to modificate the thermal desorption system to reduce the influence of water contained inside the sample to the chromatography. A method for determining VOC volume mixing ratios contained inside the sample out of the signals of the IRMS was implemented {{with the aid of a}} dynamic gas mixing system. The development of the working group's intern software Peaks in terms of automated software analysis of chromatographic data was continued. Improvements of existing algorithms were achieved in the areas of data smoothing, peak detection and single standard peak production using principal component analysis. Newly implemented was the calculation of δ 13 C isotope ratios out of the chromatogram data itself. The developed and improved methods of analysis were used in the evaluation of air samples taken from the german–spanish airborne campaign VERDRILLT (VERtical Distribution of Radicals In the Lower Layers of the Troposphere). The 28 whole air samples gained between 08 / 26 and 08 / 28 / 2010 in Spain and stored inside SilcoCan™ canisters each filled with 24   l n sample volume where analysed in the laboratory of the <b>atmospheric</b> physics <b>compartment</b> in Wuppertal. From the identified 36 VOC components oxygen-containing species of aldehydes, alcohols, and ketones stood out in particular. It is assumed that they have their origins in the emissions of biofuels and succeeding combustion products. A more detailed discussion of the δ 13 C results and if obtainable of corresponding volume mixing ratios is given for acetaldehyde (- 44, 5  ±  1, 3)  ‰, methanol (- 44, 2  ±  3, 0)  ‰, acetone (- 29, 2  ±  1, 7)  ‰, carbon disulfide with two accumulation points (- 33, 3  ±  3, 3)  ‰ and (- 11, 3  ±  2, 5)  ‰, 2, 3 –butanedione (- 27, 5  ±  3, 0)  ‰, n–butanal (- 39, 5  ±  3, 2)  ‰ and toluene (- 28, 4  ±  4, 5)  ‰. In this work, for the first time atmospheric δ 13 C values ​​of n–butanal, 2, 3 –butanedione, isopropanol (- 22. 8  ±  3. 8)  ‰, carbon disulfide and methyl acetate (- 32. 2  ±  3. 2)  ‰ are presented. The second known data sets of δ 13 C were given for fluorotrichloromethane (- 36, 7  ±  4, 2)  ‰, n–hexanal (- 28, 9  ±  4, 8)  ‰, methyl ethyl ketone (36, 9  ±  2, 5)  ‰, n–pentanal (- 31, 3  ±  4, 9)  ‰ and β–pinene (- 29, 3  ±  3, 1)  ‰. It is notable that the δ 13 C isotope ratios of acetaldehyde, fluorotrichloromethane, n-pentane, methyl ethyl ketone and β–pinene presented in this work are smaller than previously obtained data. The values for n–butane (- 36, 8  ±  4, 6)  ‰ close a gap in data known from literature. The results obtained here for n-hexanal and n-pentanal tend to slightly higher values compared to the already known literature data...|$|R
