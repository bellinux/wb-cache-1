40|$|Chronic pain is a {{major health}} issue and most {{patients}} suffer from spontaneous pain. Previous studies suggest that Huperzine A (Hup A), an alkaloid isolated from the Chinese herb Huperzia serrata, is a potent analgesic with few side effects. However, whether it alleviates spontaneous pain is unclear. We evaluated the effects of Hup A on spontaneous pain in mice using the conditioned place preference (CPP) behavioral assay and found that application of Hup A attenuated the mechanical allodynia induced by peripheral nerve injury or inflammation. This effect was blocked by atropine. However, clonidine but not Hup A induced preference for the drug-paired chamber in CPP. The same effects occurred when Hup A was infused into the anterior cingulate cortex. Furthermore, <b>ambenonium</b> <b>chloride,</b> a competitive inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, also increased the paw-withdrawal threshold but failed to induce place preference in CPP. Therefore, our data suggest that acetylcholinesterase in both the peripheral and central nervous systems {{is involved in the}} regulation of mechanical allodynia but not the spontaneous pain...|$|E
40|$|A case of pure {{red cell}} aplasia (PRCA), {{myasthenia}} gravis (MG) and thymoma is reported. A 70 -year-old woman presented withsevere anemia. Shehadbeen {{diagnosed as having}} MG 8 years earlierandhersymptoms wereadequately controlled with <b>ambenonium</b> <b>chloride.</b> When shevisited our hospital, her hematocrit was 13. 7 % with a hemoglobin concentration of 4. 7 g/dl and her reticulocyte counts werepersistently abnormal at 0. 1 %. Although both directand indirect Coombs' testswerepositive, there wasnoevidence ofhemolysis. Routine screening testsforotheretiologies of anemia were negative. Serological tests for anti-DNA and anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies gavepositive results. A bonemarrow examination revealed severe erythroid hypoplasia. PRCA was diagnosed and the patient was treated with periodic transfusions. A lateral view chest roentgenogram anda computed tomography scanof thethorax showed thepresence of ananterior mediastinal mass which wassuspected to be thymoma. Thepatient underwent thymothymectomy and the tumorwas diagnosed as a thymoma. Although the patient received no treatment for MG and PRCA aftersurgery, her hematological test results rapidly improved and she was discharged from the hospital on the 29 th postoperative day. At that time, her hematocrit was 33. 2 %, her hemoglobin concentration was 10. 0 g/dl, her peripheral reticulocyte level was 1. 8 % and her left partial ptosis had improved. She is doing well, 9 months aftersurgery. For a patient to remain in remission without treatment for PRCA and MG after thymothymectomy is extremely rare.
