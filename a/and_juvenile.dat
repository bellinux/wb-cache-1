5|$|Following the 2007 session, Roberts {{was named}} by House Republican {{leadership}} {{to the newly}} formed Criminal <b>and</b> <b>Juvenile</b> Justice Commission.

At Rangiroa Atoll in French Polynesia, great hammerheads (Sphyrna mokarran) feed opportunistically on grey reef sharks that are {{exhausted}} from pursuing mates. Known parasites of this species include the nematode Huffmanela lata and several copepod species that attach to the sharks' skin, <b>and</b> <b>juvenile</b> stages of the isopods Gnathia trimaculata and G. grandilaris that attach to the gill filaments and septa (the dividers between each gill).|$|E

5|$|The {{popularity}} and circulation of comic books about superheroes declined following World War II, and comic books about horror, crime and romance took larger {{shares of the}} market.

In 1954, publishers implemented the Comics Code Authority to regulate comic content.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 51 species of {{parasitic}} worm {{have been recovered}} from the American white ibis, predominantly from the gastrointestinal system and particularly the small intestine. These include Cestoda (tapeworms), Acanthocephala (thorny headed worms), Nematoda (roundworms), Digenea and Spirurida. Several roundworm and spirurid species {{have been found in}} the lining of the gizzard. Nematodes are more prevalent in American white ibis from freshwater habitats, and cestodes more frequent in those from saltwater areas. One nematode found in adult birds, Skrjabinoclavia thapari, is borne in the fiddler crab as an intermediate host, while the thorny headed worm species Southwellina dimorpha is carried in crayfish and infests both adult <b>and</b> <b>juvenile</b> ibis.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{that are}} {{important}} to the marsh rice rat's diet include insects, fiddler crabs, and snails, but the species is known to eat many other animals, including fish, clams, <b>and</b> <b>juvenile</b> Graptemys and Chrysemys turtles. They scavenge on carcasses of muskrats, deermice, and sparrows, and {{may be the most important}} predator on eggs and young of the marsh wren. Rice rats also eat eggs and young of the seaside sparrow (Ammodramus maritimus) and are aggressive towards the sparrow, apparently leading it to avoid nesting in Juncus in a seaside salt marsh in Florida. On islands in North Carolina, rice rats consume eggs of Forster's tern (Sterna forsteri). They have been observed preying on alligator eggs in Georgia.|$|E

50|$|Their {{preferred}} habitat temperature {{ranges from}} 12-18˚C, with larvae <b>and</b> <b>juveniles</b> preferring a higher temperature and adults preferring a lower temperature, especially during their breeding season. As flounder mature, they change their habitat {{depending on their}} life-stage. Larvae <b>and</b> <b>juveniles</b> <5 cm long tend to favour the warm, shallow waters of mud/sandflats that are heated by the sun.|$|R
5|$|Fish {{hatcheries}} provide larval <b>and</b> <b>juvenile</b> fish, crustaceans and shellfish, {{for use in}} aquaculture systems. When {{large enough}} these are transferred to growing-on tanks and sold to fish farms to reach harvest size. Some species that are commonly raised in hatcheries include shrimps, prawns, salmon, tilapia, oysters and scallops. Similar facilities {{can be used to}} raise species with conservation needs to be released into the wild, or game fish for restocking waterways. Important aspects of husbandry at these early stages include selection of breeding stock, control of water quality and nutrition. In the wild, there is a massive amount of mortality at the nursery stage; farmers seek to minimise this {{while at the same time}} maximising growth rates.|$|E
5|$|Like other newts, Triturus species {{develop in}} the water as larvae, and return to it each year for breeding. Adults spend one half to three {{quarters}} of the year on land, depending on the species, and thus depend on both suitable aquatic breeding sites and terrestrial habitats. After larval development in the first year, juveniles pass another year or two before reaching maturity; in the north and at higher elevations, this can take longer. The larval <b>and</b> <b>juvenile</b> stages are the riskiest for the newts, while survival is higher in adults. Once the risky stages passed, adult newts usually attain an age of seven to nine years, although individuals of the northern crested newts have reached 17 years in the wild.|$|E
5|$|Males, {{females and}} juveniles each form {{separate}} social groups. The male groups are the smallest; the members stay together {{and search for}} food or water sources. The female group is much larger and covers greater areas. They travel the grassy plains in wet periods and prefer bushy areas in dry periods. Females have a complex linear hierarchy. The nursery <b>and</b> <b>juvenile</b> group is naturally formed when females give birth to calves. After about 24 hours of the delivery, the mother and calf join this group. The calves start befriending each other and stay back in the nursery group while the mother returns to the female group. The calves leave the nursery group when they {{are at least two}} years old and join a male or female group.|$|E

5|$|Superficially, the smoothtooth blacktip shark {{resembles the}} {{blacktip reef shark}} (C. melanopterus). It is rather robust in build, with a short and blunt snout. The large {{nostrils}} are preceded by well-developed, triangular flaps of skin. The small, circular eyes are equipped with nictitating membranes. The mouth forms a wide arch and has very short furrows at the corners. There are 16 upper and 14–15 lower tooth rows on either side, along with two to three small teeth at the symphysis (center) of either jaw. The teeth are distinctive in shape, having narrow, upright cusps without serrations; finetooth sharks <b>and</b> <b>juvenile</b> spinner sharks are the only other members of Carcharhinus with similar teeth. The five pairs of gill slits are long.|$|E
5|$|There {{has been}} a slight decline in numbers in Europe since 1980, {{although}} the Scandinavian population is growing. Climate change appears to be affecting the migration pattern of the garden warbler and blackcap. Both are arriving in Europe earlier than previously, and blackcaps <b>and</b> <b>juvenile</b> (but not adult) garden warblers are departing nearly two weeks later than in the 1980s. Birds of both species are longer-winged and lighter than in the past, suggesting a longer migration as the breeding range expands northwards.|$|E
50|$|The South Island robin {{is a small}} passerine, 10-18 cm {{in length}} and {{weighing}} around 35 g. North Island robins do resemble both females <b>and</b> <b>juveniles</b> of the South Island robins, {{as well as all}} the Stewart Island robins, which can sometimes make it difficult to distinguish between the three. The females <b>and</b> <b>juveniles</b> within a particular group of robins look similar to each other, although newly independent juveniles may not yet have the more lightly colored breast patch. However, North Island males are almost black with a white spot just above the beak as well as the grayish-white lower breast. Females <b>and</b> <b>juveniles</b> are grayer with more variable pale patches on their breasts and throats. South Island males are dark gray except for the distinct yellowish white lower chest, while females <b>and</b> <b>juveniles</b> are again lighter gray with a less distinct breast. Finally, Stewart Island robins look similar to North Island robins (males and females).|$|R
