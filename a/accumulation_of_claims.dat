40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{rules governing}} accumulation of subsequent alternative claims in {{domestic and foreign}} procedural literature. We {{have pointed out that}} subsequent alternative claims are not genuine alternative claims since the court decides on secondary claim only after rejecting primary claim. Consequently, subsequent alternative claims are not equal as they are in the case of genuine <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>claims,</b> because the court decides only on one claim, either on primary claim or on secondary, alternative claim. In case of subsequent alternative claims the subsequent alternative claim depends on the primary claim and if the primary claim is granted, the court shall not decide on the subsequent, secondary claim. The claimant decides on the order in which the court shall decide upon the claims as it is within the claimant's disposition...|$|E
40|$|We {{establish}} rigorously {{the existence}} and properties of the stationary probability distribution which characterizes the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> non-contingent financial <b>claims</b> by a risk averse individual who confronts random wage fluctuations and incomplete insurance markets. We show that there exists a unique, almost-everywhere continuous stationary cumulative distribution function which characterizes the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> non-contingent financial <b>claims</b> in a stochastic steady-state. This distribution is shown to possess a single mass point coinciding with the non-negative, finite borrowing limit faced by the individual. We establish that the stationary distribution which characterizes the asset <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> low time preference individuals {{is at least as}} large, in the sense of first-degree stochastic dominance, as that of individuals with higher rates of time preference. We prove that, so long as individuals are allowed to borrow in amounts which can be repayed with probability one, additive differences in the probability distribution governing random wage earnings imply inversely proportional additive differences in the stationary probability distributions which govern the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> non-contingent financial <b>claims.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|When {{a country}} {{experiences}} deep economic depression the losses in credit (surety) insurance may reach catastrophic dimensions for several years. During {{that time the}} number <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> can be extraordinary large and, what is more important, the proportion <b>of</b> excessive <b>claims</b> can be much higher than usual. This kind of phenomenon is difficult to capture with the standard methods of risk theory. In this paper we study credit risk modelling in the economic cycle point of view. First we discuss the usefulness of economic forecasts to actuaries. Then we propose a model that utilises a modification of a well-known Markov process description of an economic business cycle. The states of the used Markov process represent economic expansion, recession and deep depression. The Markov model fits well into the <b>accumulation</b> process <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> in consecutive years. When a simple description of {{the states of the}} Markov process is found, this approach leads to parsimonious modelling. The proposed actuarial model is used for simulating purposes in order to study the effect of the economic cycle on the needed pure premium and initial risk reserve. The choice of parameters for the model is motivated by empirical observations...|$|R

We argue that these claims are unfounded. They also lead to unnecessary fears in Germany that make a solution of the eurozone crisis more difficult.

6000|$|Let us {{suppose a}} {{national}} store of wealth, real or imaginary (that is to say, composed of material things either useful, or {{believed to be}} so), presided over by a Government,[74] and that every workman, having produced any article involving labour in its production, and for which he has no immediate use, brings it to add to this store, receiving, from the Government, in exchange an order either {{for the return of}} the thing itself, or of its equivalent in other things,[75] such as he may choose out of the store at any time when he needs them. Now, supposing that the labourer speedily uses this general order, or, in common language, [...] "spends the money," [...] he has neither changed the circumstances of the nation nor his own, except in so far as he may have produced useful and consumed useless articles, or vice versa. But if he does not use, or uses in part only, the order he receives, and lays aside some portion of it; and thus every day bringing his contribution to the national store, lays by some percentage of the order received in exchange for it, he increases the national wealth daily by as much as he does not use of the received order, and to the same amount accumulates a monetary claim on the Government.

40|$|We {{develop a}} class of {{non-life}} reserving models using a stable- 1 / 2 random bridge to simulate the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> paid <b>claims,</b> allowing for an essentially arbitrary choice of a priori distribution for the ultimate loss. Taking an information-based approach to the reserving problem, we derive {{the process of the}} conditional distribution of the ultimate loss. The "best-estimate ultimate loss process" is given by the conditional expectation of the ultimate loss. We derive explicit expressions for the best-estimate ultimate loss process, and for expected recoveries arising from aggregate excess-of-loss reinsurance treaties. Use of a deterministic time change allows for the matching of any initial (increasing) development pattern for the paid claims. We show that these methods are well-suited to the modelling <b>of</b> <b>claims</b> where there is a non-trivial probability of catastrophic loss. The generalized inverse-Gaussian (GIG) distribution is shown to be a natural choice for the a priori ultimate loss distribution. For particular GIG parameter choices, the best-estimate ultimate loss process can be written as a rational function of the paid-claims process. We extend the model to include a second paid-claims process, and allow the two processes to be dependent. The results obtained {{can be applied to the}} modelling of multiple lines of business or multiple origin years. The multi-dimensional model has the property that the dimensionality of calculations remains low, regardless of the number of paid-claims processes. An algorithm is provided for the simulation of the paid-claims processes. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the implications}} of a continued divergence of TARGET 2 balances for monetary policy in the euro area. The <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> TARGET 2 <b>claims</b> (liabilities) would make ECB’s liquidity management asymmetric once the TARGET 2 claims in core countries have crowded out central bank credit in those regions. Then while providing scarce liquidity to banks in countries with TARGET 2 liabilities, the ECB will need to absorb excess liquidity in countries with TARGET 2 claims. We discuss three alternatives and its implications to absorb excess liquidity in core regions: (1) Using market based measures might accelerate the capital flight from periphery to core countries and would add to the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> risky assets by the ECB. (2) Conducting non-market based measures such as imposing differential (unremunerated) reserve requirements would distort banking markets and would support the development of shadow banking. (3) Staying passive would lead to decreasing interest rates in core Europe entailing inflationary pressure and overinvestment in those regions and possibly future instability of the banking system. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{economic}} {{emergence of}} a fixed exchange rate periphery in Asia has reestablished the United States as the center country in the Bretton Woods international monetary system.

The success of this strategy in fostering economic growth allows the periphery to graduate to the center. Financial liberalization, in turn, requires floating exchange rates among the center countries.

40|$|During {{the fifteen}} years since 1970, {{the theory of}} exchange-rate {{determination}} has been completely transformed. In the late 1960 s, the standard model of the foreign exchange market had supply and demand as stable functions of exports and imports, with the expection that a floating rate would move gradually with relative price changes. However,the period of floating rates {{that began in the}} early 1970 s has revealed that exchange rates exhibit the volatility of financial market prices. This experience, coupled with development of theory, led first to the"monetary" approach to exchange rate determination and then to the "asset market" approach. The monetary approach to exchange rate determination had essentially one-way causation from money to exchange rates, sometimes via purchasing power parity. The broader asset market approach assumes two-way causation. The exchange rate, in the asset-market view, is proximately determined by financial-market equilibrium conditions. It, in turn, influences the trade balance and the current account. The latter, in its turn, is the rate <b>of</b> <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> national <b>claims</b> on foreigners, and this feeds back into financial market equilibrium. Thus the asset market approach contains a dynamic feedback mechanism in foreign assets and exchange rates. This approach is called here a "fundamentals" model of exchange rate dynamics. Recent work on rational expectations adds a layer of expectations to the model. It is assumed that following an unexpected disturbance the market can anticipate where the fundamentals will move the system, and move the exchange rate in anticipation of that fundamentals path. This paper integrates the traditional elasticities and absorption approaches into the general equilibrium fundamentals model, and then add the expectations layer. The model is used to interpret recent shifts in U. S. fiscal policy and portfolio preferences for the dollar. ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Owing to adverse pharmacokinetics, {{azathioprine}} {{treatment may}} fail to induce a satisfactory clinical response in systemic connective tissue diseases. The major intracellular cytotoxic metabolites of azathioprine are 6 -thioguanine nucleotides (6 TGNs). METHODS: To assess whether the erythrocyte <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> 6 TGN is a clinically applicable index for monitoring azathioprine treatment, erythrocyte <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> 6 TGN was measured in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (n = 12), systemic lupus erythematosus (n = 7), polyarteritis nodosa (n = 2), myositis (n = 1), or leukocytoclastic vasculitis (n = 1). Ages ranged from 28 to 75 (median 58) years. RESULTS: Erythrocyte <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> 6 TGN varied among the patients from 20 to 303 (median value 95) nmol/mmol haemoglobin. No significant correlation was found between erythrocyte <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> 6 TGN and the dose of azathioprine/kg body weight, {{the age of the}} patients, the duration of treatment, or the presence of myelotoxicity or hepatotoxicity. The interindividual coefficient of variation (CV) in the erythrocyte <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> 6 TGN/mg azathioprine/kg body weight was 0. 65. The median intraindividual CV in erythrocyte <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> 6 TGN at an unchanged dose of azathioprine was 0. 09 (19 patients; range 0. 03 - 0. 27). CONCLUSIONS: The low intraindividual variation compared with the high interpatient variation in erythrocyte <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> 6 TGN implies that erythrocyte <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> 6 TGN may be clinically applicable for monitoring azathioprine treatment. Prospective studies are needed to clarify the relation between the erythrocyte <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> 6 TGN and the clinical response to treatment, and to establish recommendations for dose modifications...|$|R
