5|$|The {{relative}} ages of {{the different}} surface units on Callisto can be determined from the density of impact craters on them. The older the surface, the denser the crater population. <b>Absolute</b> <b>dating</b> has not been carried out, but based on theoretical considerations, the cratered plains {{are thought to be}} ~4.5billion years old, dating back almost to the formation of the Solar System. The ages of multi-ring structures and impact craters depend on chosen background cratering rates and are estimated by different authors to vary between 1 and 4billion years.|$|E
25|$|While {{evidence}} such as {{size and}} scale of site and of individual structures (e.g., El Tigre at El Mirador) is compelling, {{developments in the}} Southern area remain resilient against conclusive consensus. The temporal priority of plentiful as opposed to scant evidence of stelae and writing in the Preclassic south compared to the Mirador Basin must be based principally on <b>absolute</b> <b>dating,</b> although this problem, itself, becomes difficult to resolve when events are dated by 14C (“calibrated” or “uncalibrated”) – still {{the most widely used}} <b>absolute</b> <b>dating</b> method in Mesoamerica – and which cannot be rendered more fine-grained than ca. 100 years and often is less precise. Accordingly, the debate about temporal priority will remain unresolved unless and until other <b>absolute</b> <b>dating</b> methods such as archaeomagnetics and luminescence (hitherto, thermoluminescence), are applied more widely, or Long Count-dated texts, e.g., Cycle 6, are found earlier than those found thus far, which are Cycle 7. While relative dating methods – principally ceramic – are highly reliable, having been cross-referenced from many sites, and with sophisticated statistics available, unless anchored to absolute dates, these remain uncertain especially when the scholar’s focus is on the early periods of development in Mesoamerica.|$|E
25|$|The three-age {{system is}} a {{relative}} chronology. The explosion of archaeological data acquired in the 20th century was intended to elucidate the relative chronology in detail.

25|$|Because of {{uncertainty}} regarding the establishment {{date of the}} Satavahana kingdom, {{it is difficult to}} give <b>absolute</b> <b>dates</b> for the reigns of the Satavahana kings.

25|$|Since {{the early}} years of the twentieth century, <b>absolute</b> <b>dating</b> methods, such as radiometric dating (including potassium/argon, argon/argon, uranium series, and, for very recent fossils, {{radiocarbon}} dating) have been used to verify the relative ages obtained by fossils and to provide absolute ages for many fossils. Radiometric dating has shown that the earliest known stromatolites are over 3.4billion years old.|$|E
25|$|Creation {{science has}} its roots in the work of young Earth creationist George McCready Price disputing modern science's account of natural history, {{focusing}} particularly on geology and its concept of uniformitarianism, and his efforts instead to furnish an alternative empirical explanation of observable phenomena which was compatible with strict Biblical literalism. Price's work was later discovered by civil engineer Henry M. Morris, who is now considered to be the father of creation science. Morris and later creationists expanded the scope with attacks against the broad spectrum scientific findings that point to the antiquity of the Universe and common ancestry among species, including growing body of evidence from the fossil record, <b>absolute</b> <b>dating</b> techniques, and cosmogony.|$|E
25|$|Otto Schoetensack had {{the site}} {{at the bottom}} of the sand mine marked with a {{commemorative}} stone on which a horizontal line represented the level of the find. Whether his wish had been granted - namely that the stone may remain in its place, even if the sand mine will one day be re-filled - is unknown. In fact, the part of the mine, in which the lower jaw came to light, was filled with overburden in the 1930s, later re-natured as arable land and declared a nature reserve in 1982. The actual site is therefore not accessible for research at the present time. <b>Absolute</b> <b>dating</b> of the strata using contemporary scientific methods proved to be not possible.

2500|$|Two {{types of}} chronologies can be distinguished: a {{relative}} chronology and an absolute chronology. The former establishes {{the order of}} phases, periods, cultures and reigns, whereas the latter establishes their absolute age expressed in years. In archaeology, relative chronologies are established by carefully excavating archaeological sites and reconstructing their stratigraphy – {{the order in which}} layers were deposited. In general, newer remains are deposited on top of older material. Absolute chronologies are established by dating remains, or the layers in which they are found, through <b>absolute</b> <b>dating</b> methods. These methods include radiocarbon dating and the written record that can provide year names or calendar dates.|$|E
2500|$|At the 100th {{anniversary of}} the {{discovery}} in 2007 a scientific commemorative publication complained that there [...] "still existed no satisfactory exact data for {{the determination of the}} geological age of the lower jaw of Homo heidelbergensis". After all, in 1995 the age of the sands of Mauer 1 could approximately be determined on the basis of small fossils. Additionally, attempts were made to perform an <b>absolute</b> <b>dating</b> in yet accessible, adjacent sand mines. However, to date researchers could not agree on which of the several possible layers that belong to the Cromer-warm period is identical with the layer of the Grafenrain mine. So it happens that the commune of Mauer dates the fossil to an age [...] "of more than 600,000 years" [...] on its website, whereas the memorial stone called an age of 500,000 years. A range from 474,000 to 621,000 years is currently considered to be the established age of [...] "layer 4", in which the actual fossil either originates from the lower (around 600,000) or the upper (around 500,000) spectrum.|$|E

This changed the understanding of geologic time. Previously, geologists could only use fossils and stratigraphic correlation to date sections of rock relative to one another. With isotopic dates, it became possible to assign absolute ages to rock units, and these <b>absolute</b> <b>dates</b> could be applied to fossil sequences in which there was datable material, converting the old relative ages into new absolute ages.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Absolute</b> <b>dating</b> is {{the process}} of {{determining}} an age on a specified chronology in archaeology and geology. Some scientists prefer the terms chronometric or calendar dating, as use of the word [...] "absolute" [...] implies an unwarranted certainty of accuracy.

30|$|A {{key issue}} in the {{reconstruction}} of human peopling history is dating the events related to past human migrations. Population genetics is rather limited in this field compared to archaeology and paleoanthropology which can provide direct <b>absolute</b> <b>dates</b> of human settlements, although with large confidence intervals. However, the genetic literature is full of <b>absolute</b> <b>dates</b> for human prehistory. The main reason is that geneticists use the molecular clock theory to infer the time {{to the most recent}} common ancestor (TMRCA) of each set of haplotypes clustered together (i.e., each haplogroup) in the molecular phylogenies obtained for uniparentally inherited mtDNA and Y chromosome genetic markers. Depending on differences in frequencies or molecular diversity, a geographic origin and a geographic spread are also often inferred for each lineage (hence the term “phylogeography” for this kind of approach).|$|R
