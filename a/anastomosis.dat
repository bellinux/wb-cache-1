5|$|Besides regular sexual {{reproduction}} with meiosis, certain fungi, {{such as those}} in the genera Penicillium and Aspergillus, may exchange genetic material via parasexual processes, initiated by <b>anastomosis</b> between hyphae and plasmogamy of fungal cells. The frequency and relative importance of parasexual events is unclear and may be lower than other sexual processes. It is known {{to play a role in}} intraspecific hybridization and is likely required for hybridization between species, which has been associated with major events in fungal evolution.|$|E
5|$|He {{was known}} for the {{following}} eponyms: Murphy’s button (a mechanical device used for intestinal <b>anastomosis),</b> Murphy’s punch (a punch tenderness at the costo-vertebral angle in cases of perinephric abscess), Murphy's sign (a sign of inflammation of the gallbladder), Murphy’s test (a test for deep-seated tenderness and muscular rigidity in cases of perinephric abscess), Murphy drip for administration of fluids by proctoclysis in patients with peritonitis, and Murphy-Lane bone skid (a common commercial steel instrument used for femoral head procedures).|$|E
5|$|Most fungi {{have both}} a haploid and a diploid stage {{in their life}} cycles. In sexually {{reproducing}} fungi, compatible individuals may combine by fusing their hyphae together into an interconnected network; this process, <b>anastomosis,</b> {{is required for the}} initiation of the sexual cycle. Many ascomycetes and basidiomycetes go through a dikaryotic stage, in which the nuclei inherited from the two parents do not combine immediately after cell fusion, but remain separate in the hyphal cells (see heterokaryosis).|$|E
5|$|Murphy {{developed}} his eponymous anastomotic button for a sutureless <b>anastomosis</b> of the gallbladder to the duodenum (his preferred treatment for acute cholecystitis), {{but it was}} equally suitable for intestinal anastomoses. He developed it in the experimental animal laboratory in a barn behind his house and first used it {{less than a week}} after developing it on a dog. The Murphy button can be credited as the forerunner of the modern end-to-end stapling instrument after having become the method of choice for operations at the Mayo Clinic and elsewhere in the United States for over twenty years.|$|E
25|$|In circulatory anastomoses, many arteries {{naturally}} anastomose {{with each}} other; for example, the inferior epigastric artery and superior epigastric artery, or the anterior and/or posterior communicating arteries in the Circle of Willis in the brain. The circulatory <b>anastomosis</b> is further divided into arterial and venous <b>anastomosis.</b> Arterial <b>anastomosis</b> includes actual arterial <b>anastomosis</b> (e.g., palmar arch, plantar arch) and potential arterial <b>anastomosis</b> (e.g. coronary arteries and cortical branch of cerebral arteries). Anastomoses also form alternative routes around capillary beds {{in areas that}} don't need a large blood supply, thus helping regulate systemic blood flow.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} {{surgical}} <b>anastomosis</b> {{occurs when a}} segment of intestine is resected and the two remaining ends are sewn or stapled together (anastomosed). The procedure {{is referred to as}} intestinal <b>anastomosis.</b> Other examples include Roux-en-Y <b>anastomosis</b> or ureteroureterostomy.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{surgical}} approaches to treat megacolon, {{such as a}} colectomy (removal of the entire colon) with ileorectal <b>anastomosis</b> (ligation of the remaining ileum and rectum segments), or a total proctocolectomy (removal of colon, sigmoid and rectum) followed by ileostomy or followed by ileoanal <b>anastomosis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Pathological <b>anastomosis</b> {{results from}} trauma or disease and may involve veins, arteries, or intestines. These are usually {{referred}} to as fistulas. In the cases of veins or arteries, traumatic fistulas usually occur between artery and vein. Traumatic intestinal fistulas usually occur between two loops of intestine (entero-enteric fistula) or intestine and skin (enterocutaneous fistula). Portacaval <b>anastomosis,</b> by contrast, is an <b>anastomosis</b> between a vein of the portal circulation and a vein of the systemic circulation, which allows blood to bypass the liver in patients with portal hypertension, often resulting in hemorrhoids, esophageal varices, or caput medusae.|$|E
25|$|An <b>anastomosis</b> (plural anastomoses) is a {{connection}} or opening between two things (especially cavities or passages) that are normally diverging or branching, such as between blood vessels, leaf veins, or streams. Such {{a connection}} may be normal (such as the foramen ovale in a fetus's heart) or abnormal (such as the patent foramen ovale in an adult's heart); it may be acquired (such as an arteriovenous fistula) or innate (such as the arteriovenous shunt of a metarteriole); {{and it may be}} natural (such as the aforementioned examples) or artificial (such as a surgical <b>anastomosis).</b> The reestablishment of an <b>anastomosis</b> that had become blocked is called a reanastomosis. Anastomoses that are abnormal, whether congenital or acquired, are often called fistulas.|$|E
25|$|Soviet cardiac surgeon, Vasilii Kolesov, {{performed}} {{the first successful}} internal mammary artery–coronary artery <b>anastomosis</b> in 1964. However, Goetz has been cited by others, including Kolesov, as the first successful human coronary artery bypass. Goetz's case has frequently been overlooked. Confusion has persisted for over 40 years {{and seems to be}} due to the absence of a full report and to misunderstanding about the type of <b>anastomosis</b> that was created. The <b>anastomosis</b> was intima-to-intima, with the vessels held together with circumferential ligatures over a specially designed metal ring. Kolesov did the first successful coronary bypass using a standard suture technique in 1964, and {{over the next five years}} he performed 33 sutured and mechanically stapled anastomoses in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg), USSR.|$|E
25|$|In geology, <b>anastomosis</b> {{refers to}} quartz (or other) veins {{displaying}} this property, {{which is often}} related to shearing in metamorphic regions.|$|E
25|$|Conidia are asexual {{reproductive}} (reproduction {{without the}} fusing of gametes) spores of fungi which germinate under specific conditions. A variety of cells can be formed from the germinating conidia. The most common are germ tubes which grow and develop into hyphae. Another type of cell is a conidial <b>anastomosis</b> tube (CAT); these differ from germ tubes {{in that they}} are thinner, shorter, lack branches, exhibit determinate growth and home toward each other. Each cell is of a tubular shape, but the conidial <b>anastomosis</b> tube forms a bridge that allows fusion between conidia.|$|E
25|$|An <b>anastomosis</b> is the {{connection}} of two normally divergent structures. It refers to connections between blood vessels or between other tubular structures such as loops of intestine.|$|E
25|$|Replacement of {{the damaged}} section of aorta with a sutureless {{vascular}} ring connector-reinforced Dacron graft: The vascular ring connector is a titanic ring {{used as a}} stent in the vascular graft to achieve a quick, blood-sealed, and sutureless <b>anastomosis.</b> Two furrows {{on the surface of}} the ring are for fixation of the vascular graft and the aorta. The tapes used to tie against the ring provide a larger contact surface area than the traditional stitches, thus it provides stronger <b>anastomosis</b> and better surgical results.|$|E
25|$|Vascular malformation, {{including}} aorto-enteric fistulae. Fistulae {{are usually}} secondary to prior vascular surgery and usually {{occur at the}} proximal <b>anastomosis</b> at {{the third or fourth}} portion of the duodenum where it is retroperitoneal and near the aorta.|$|E
25|$|In mycology, <b>anastomosis</b> is {{the fusion}} between {{branches}} of the same or different hyphae. Hence the bifurcating fungal hyphae can form true reticulating networks. By sharing materials {{in the form of}} dissolved ions, hormones, and nucleotides, the fungus maintains bidirectional communication with itself. The fungal network might begin from several origins; several spores (i.e. by means of conidial <b>anastomosis</b> tubes), several points of penetration, each a spreading circumference of absorption and assimilation. Once encountering the tip of another expanding, exploring self, the tips press against each other in pheromonal recognition or by an unknown recognition system, fusing to form a genetic singular clonal colony that can cover hectares called a genet or just microscopical areas.|$|E
25|$|Lymphaticovenous <b>anastomosis</b> (LVA) uses supermicrosurgery {{to connect}} the {{affected}} lymphatic channels directly to tiny veins located nearby. The lymphatics are tiny, typically 0.1mm to 0.8mm in diameter. The procedure {{requires the use of}} specialized techniques with superfine surgical suture and an adapted, high-power microscope.|$|E
25|$|Esophageal varices {{result from}} {{collateral}} portal blood flow through {{vessels in the}} stomach and esophagus (a process called portacaval <b>anastomosis).</b> When these blood vessels become enlarged, they are called varices {{and are more likely}} to rupture. Variceal rupture often leads to severe bleeding, which can be fatal.|$|E
25|$|Two main veins drain {{blood from}} the vagina, {{one on the left}} and one on the right. These form a network of smaller veins (an <b>anastomosis)</b> {{on the sides of the}} vagina, {{connecting}} with similar networks of the uterine, vesical and rectal networks. These ultimately drain into the internal iliac veins.|$|E
25|$|When the testis {{is in the}} abdomen, {{the first}} stage of surgery is {{exploration}} to locate it, assess its viability, and determine the safest way to maintain or establish the blood supply. Multi-stage surgeries, or autotransplantation and <b>anastomosis,</b> are more often necessary in these situations. Just as often, intra-abdominal exploration discovers that the testis is non-existent ("vanished"), or dysplastic and not salvageable.|$|E
25|$|Lymphaticovenous <b>anastomosis</b> was {{introduced}} by B. M. O'Brien and colleagues {{for the treatment of}} obstructive lymphedema in the extremities. In 2003, supermicrosurgery pioneer Isao Koshima and colleagues improved the surgery with supermicrosurgical techniques and established the new standard in reconstructive microsurgery. Studies involving long-term follow-up after LVA for lymphedema indicated patients showed remarkable improvement compared to conservative treatment using continuous elastic stocking and occasional pumping.|$|E
25|$|For fungi, <b>anastomosis</b> {{is also a}} {{component}} of reproduction. In some fungi, two different haploid mating types – if compatible – merge. Somatically, they form a morphologically similar mycelial wave front that continues to grow and explore. The significant difference, is that each septated unit is binucleate, containing two unfused nuclei, i.e., one from each parent that eventually undergoes karyogamy and meiosis to complete the sexual cycle.|$|E
25|$|An <b>anastomosis</b> is a {{surgical}} {{connection between the}} stomach and bowel, or between {{two parts of the}} bowel. The surgeon attempts to create a water-tight connection by connecting the two organs with either staples or sutures, either of which actually makes a hole in the bowel wall. The surgeon will rely on the body's natural healing abilities and its ability to create a seal, like a self-sealing tire, to succeed with the surgery. If that seal fails to form for any reason, fluid from within the gastrointestinal tract can leak into the sterile abdominal cavity and give rise to infection and abscess formation. Leakage of an <b>anastomosis</b> can occur in about 2% of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and less than 1% in mini gastric bypass. Leaks usually occur at the stomach-intestine connection (gastro-jejunostomy). There is a change in the drain fluid contents from serous (before the leak) to fecal/bilious (after the leak). Usually significant leaks need urgent re-operation. Sometimes a minor leakage can be treated with antibiotics only. It is usually safer to re-operate if an infection cannot be definitely controlled immediately.|$|E
25|$|Sporidiobolus salmonicolor is a heterothallic species; two mating {{types are}} known. Induction {{of the sexual}} stage begins with <b>anastomosis</b> of {{compatible}} yeast cells to form dikaryotic hyphae with clamp connections. Hyphae have “simple” septal pores that allow continuity of the cytoplasm between cells. At the terminal end of the hypha, thick-walled, resting spores called teliospores form. These germinate to form a transversely-septate basidia that bears two large basidiospores.|$|E
25|$|Ileal {{hypertrophy}} {{occurs when}} the circular and longitudinal layers of the ileal intestinal wall hypertrophy, and can also occur with jejunal hypertrophy. The mucosa remains normal, so malabsorption {{is not expected to}} occur in this disease. Ileal hypertrophy may be idiopathic, with current theories for such cases including neural dysfunction within the intestinal wall secondary to parasite migration, and increased tone of the ileocecal valve which leads to hypertrophy of the ileum as it tries to push contents into the cecum. Hypertrophy may also occur secondary to obstruction, especially those that have had surgery for an obstruction that required an <b>anastomosis.</b> Hypertrophy gradually decreases the size of the lumen, resulting in intermittent colic, and in approximately 45% of cases includes weight loss of 1–6 month duration and anorexia. Although rectal examination may display a thickened ileal wall, usually the diagnosis is made at surgery, and an ileocecal or jejunocecal <b>anastomosis</b> is made to allow intestinal contents to bypass the affected area. If surgery and bypass is not performed, there is a risk of rupture, but prognosis is fair with surgical treatment.|$|E
25|$|The first {{surgical}} approach {{consists in}} the resection and primary <b>anastomosis.</b> This {{first stage of}} surgery is performed on patients with a well vascularized, nonedematous and tension-free bowel. The proximal margin should be an area of pliable colon without hypertrophy or inflammation. The distal margin should extend to the upper third of the rectum where the taenia coalesces. Not all of the diverticula-bearing colon must be removed, since diverticula proximal to the descending or sigmoid colon are unlikely to result in further symptoms.|$|E
25|$|DPI {{usually is}} managed {{medically}} with nasogastric intubation every 1–2 hours to relieve gastric pressure secondary to reflux, and aggressive fluid support to maintain hydration and correct electrolyte imbalances. Horses are often withheld food for several days. Use of anti-inflammatory, anti-endotoxin, anti-microbial, and prokinetic drugs are common with this disease. Surgery {{may be needed}} to rule out obstruction or strangulation, and in cases that are long-standing to perform a resection and <b>anastomosis</b> of the diseased bowel. Survival rates for DPJ are 25-94%, and horses in the southeast United States appear to be more severely affected.|$|E
25|$|The Deep Circumflex Iliac Artery Free flap is {{technically}} {{more difficult than}} the TRAM flap, and shaping the new breast seems more challenging than with the TRAM or gluteal flap because of its fusiform shape. Asymmetrical donor site after unilateral breast reconstruction. The blood supply to the flap is less robust and sometimes the deep circumflex iliac vein is small, making venous <b>anastomosis</b> required to transfer the flap more difficult. Part of the donor site scar may be visible in swimsuit. Improper reinsertion of donor site muscles on the iliac crest can cause postoperative complications, like a hernia. Also, nerve paresthesias are possible.|$|E
25|$|Surgery poses {{significant}} {{expense and}} risks, including peritonitis, {{the formation of}} adhesions, complications secondary to general anesthesia, injury upon recovery of the horse which may require euthanasia, dehiscence, or infection of the incisional site. Additionally, surgical cases may develop post-operative ileus which requires further medical management. However, surgery {{may be required to}} save the life of the horse, and 1–2% of all colics require surgical intervention. If a section of intestine is significantly damaged, it may need to be removed (resection) and the healthy parts reattached together (<b>anastomosis).</b> Horses may have up to 80% of their intestines removed and still function normally, without needing a special diet.|$|E
25|$|Fly larvae and fly {{eggs are}} used {{to aid in the}} {{determination}} of a PMI. In order for the data to be useful the larvae and eggs must be identified down to a species level to get an accurate estimate for the PMI. There are many techniques currently being developed to differentiate between the various species of forensically important insects. A study in 2007 demonstrates a technique that can use scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to identify key morphological features of eggs and maggots. Some of the morphological differences that can help identify the different species are the presence/absence of <b>anastomosis,</b> the presence/absence of holes, and the shape and length of the median area.|$|E
25|$|Surgery is {{normally}} reserved for complications of Crohn's disease or when disease that resists treatment with drugs {{is confined to}} one location that can be removed. Surgery {{is often used to}} manage complications of Crohn's disease, including fistulae, small bowel obstruction, colon cancer, small intestine cancer and fibrostenotic strictures, when strictureplasty (expansion of the stricture) is sometimes performed. Otherwise, and for other complications, resection and <b>anastomosis</b> – the removal of the affected section of intestine and the rejoining of the healthy sections – is the surgery usually performed for Crohn's disease (e.g., ileocolonic resection). None of these surgeries cure or eliminate Crohn's disease, as the disease eventually comes back in healthy segments of the intestine, although when Crohn's disease recurs after surgery, it usually comes back {{at the site of the}} surgery.|$|E
25|$|For aneurysms in the aorta, arms, legs, or head, the {{weakened}} {{section of}} the vessel may {{be replaced by a}} bypass graft that is sutured at the vascular stumps. Instead of sewing, the graft tube ends, made rigid and expandable by nitinol wireframe, can be easily inserted in its reduced diameter into the vascular stumps and then expanded up to the most appropriate diameter and permanently fixed there by external ligature. New devices were recently developed to substitute the external ligature by expandable ring allowing use in acute ascending aorta dissection, providing airtight (i.e. not dependent on the coagulation integrity), easy and quick <b>anastomosis</b> extended to the arch concavity Less invasive endovascular techniques allow covered metallic stent grafts to be inserted through the arteries of the leg and deployed across the aneurysm.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of colics {{requiring}} surgery, survival rates are best improved by quick recognition of colic and immediate surgical referral, rather than {{waiting to see if}} the horse improves, which only increases the extent of intestinal compromise. Survival rates are higher in surgical cases that do not require resection and <b>anastomosis.</b> 90% of large intestinal colic surgeries that are not due to volvulus, and 20–80% of large colon volvuluses, are discharged; while 85–90% of non strangulating small intestinal lesions, and 65–75% of strangulating intestinal lesions are discharged. 10–20% of small intestinal surgical cases require a second surgery, while only 5% of large intestinal cases do so. Horses that survive colic surgery have a high rate of return to athletic function. According to one study, approximately 86% of horses discharged returned to work, and 83.5% returned to same or better performance.|$|E
25|$|Adhesions, or {{scar tissue}} between various organs {{that are not}} {{normally}} attached within the abdomen, may occur whenever an abdominal surgery is performed. It is often seen secondary to reperfusion injury where there is ischemic bowel or after intestinal distention. This injury causes neutrophils {{to move into the}} serosa and mesothelium to be lost, which the body then attempts to repair using fibrin and collagen, leading to adhesion formation between adjacent tissues with either fibrinous or fibrous material. Adhesions may encourage a volvulus, as the attachment provides a pivot point, or force a tight turn between two adjacent loops that are now attached, leading to partial obstruction. For this reason, clinical signs vary from silent lesions to acute obstruction, encouraging future colics including intestinal obstruction or strangulation, and requiring further surgery and risk of adhesion. Generally, adhesions form within the first two months following surgery. Adhesions occur most commonly in horses with small intestinal disease (22% of all surgical colics), foals (17%), those requiring enterotomy or a resection and <b>anastomosis,</b> or those that develop septic peritonitis.|$|E
25|$|Small {{amounts of}} food is usually {{introduced}} {{as soon as}} possible after surgery, usually within 18–36 hours, to encourage motility and reduce the risk of ileus and the formation of adhesions. Often horses are stall rested with short bouts of hand walking to encourage intestinal motility. The incision site is carefully monitored for dehiscence, or complete failure of the incision leading to spillage of the abdominal contents out of the incision site, and the horse is not allowed turn-out until the incision has healed, usually after 30 days of stall rest. Abdominal bandages are sometimes used to help prevent the risk of dehiscence. Incisional infection doubles the time required for postoperative care, and dehiscence may lead to intestinal herniation, which reduces the likelihood of return to athletic function. Therefore, antibiotics are given 2–3 days after surgery, and temperature is constantly monitored, to help assess if an infection is present. Antibiotics are not used long-term due to the risk of antimicrobial resistance. The incision usually takes 6 months to reach 80% strength, while intestinal healing following resection and <b>anastomosis</b> is much faster, at a rate to 100% strength in 3 weeks. After the incision has healed adequately, the horse is turned out in a small area for another 2–3 months, and light exercise is added to improve the tone and strength of the abdominal musculature.|$|E
25|$|Thyroid {{transplantation}} {{became the}} model for a whole new therapeutic strategy: organ transplantation. After {{the example of the}} thyroid, other organs were transplanted in the decades around 1900. Some of these transplants were done in animals for purposes of research, where organ removal and transplantation became a successful strategy of investigating the function of organs. Kocher was awarded his Nobel Prize in 1909 for the discovery of the function of the thyroid gland. At the same time, organs were also transplanted for treating diseases in humans. The thyroid gland became {{the model for}} transplants of adrenal and parathyroid glands, pancreas, ovary, testicles and kidney. By 1900, the idea that one can successfully treat internal diseases by replacing a failed organ through transplantation had been generally accepted. Pioneering work in the surgical technique of transplantation was made in the early 1900s by the French surgeon Alexis Carrel, with Charles Guthrie, with the transplantation of arteries or veins. Their skillful <b>anastomosis</b> operations and the new suturing techniques laid the groundwork for later transplant surgery and won Carrel the 1912 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. From 1902, Carrel performed transplant experiments on dogs. Surgically successful in moving kidneys, hearts, and spleens, {{he was one of the}} first to identify the problem of rejection, which remained insurmountable for decades. The discovery of transplant immunity by the German surgeon Georg Schöne, various strategies of matching donor and recipient, and the use of different agents for immune suppression did not result in substantial improvement so that organ transplantation was largely abandoned after WWI.|$|E
