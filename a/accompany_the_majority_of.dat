40|$|Sharp {{weapons have}} been one of the most common deadly tools in cases of {{homicide}} and suicide for a long time. Tentative incisions <b>accompany</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> suicides by sharp force and the absence of hesitation marks provokes questions about the manner of death. We present the bizarre fatality of a 41 -year-old male with an isolated circumscribed incision on the right neck, where the body was found lying in a pool of blood in the shower of his apartment. The internal examination revealed a 4 -cm-long channel-like defect running inwardly and downwardly along the right sternocleidomastoid region. The cause of death was external bleeding from an injured right carotid artery and internal jugular vein. The wound had clean non-contused margins without any conspicuous hesitation injuries. A fragment of a razor blade, found in blood splatters, was identified as the only potential injuring tool. The case was classified as a suicide...|$|E

40|$|Lymphatic filarial {{nematodes}} {{are able}} to down-regulate parasite-specific and nonspecific responses of lymphocytes and APC. Lymphatic filariae are reliant on Wolbachia endosymbiotic bacteria for development and survival. We tested the hypothesis that repeated exposure to Wolbachia endosymbionts would drive macrophage tolerance in vitro and in vivo. We pre-exposed murine peritoneal-elicited macrophages to soluble extracts of Brugia malayi female worms (BMFE) before restimulating with BMFE or TLR agonists. BMFE tolerized macrophages (in terms of IFN-beta, IL- 1 beta, IL- 6, IL- 12 p 40, and TNF-alpha inflammatory cytokine production) in a dose-dependent manner toward self, LPS, MyD 88 -dependent TLR 2 or TLR 9 ligands (peptidoglycan, triacyl lipopeptide, CpG DNA) and the MyD 88 -independent/TRIF-dependent TLR 3 ligand, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid. This was accompanied with down-regulation in surface expression of TLR 4 and up-regulation of CD 14, CD 40, and TLR 2. BMFE tolerance extended to CD 40 activation in vitro and systemic inflammation following lethal challenge in an in vivo model of endotoxin shock. The mechanism of BMFE-mediated macrophage tolerance was dependent on MyD 88 and TLR 2 but not TLR 4. Evidence that desensitization was driven by Wolbachia-specific ligands was determined by use of extracts from Wolbachia-depleted B. malayi, aposymbiotic filarial species, and a cell line stably infected with Wolbachia pipientis. Our data promote a role for Wolbachia in contributing toward the dysregulated and tolerized immunological phenotype that <b>accompanies</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> human filarial infections...|$|R
40|$|Using a naturalistic video database, we {{examined}} whether gestures scaffolded the symbolic {{development of a}} language-enculturated chimpanzee, a language-enculturated bonobo, and a human child during {{the second year of}} life. These three species constitute a complete clade: species possessing a common immediate ancestor. A basic finding was the functional and formal similarity of many gestures between chimpanzee, bonobo, and human child. The child’s symbols were spoken words; the apes’ symbols were lexigrams, noniconic visual signifiers. A developmental pattern in which gestural representation of a referent preceded symbolic representation of the same referent appeared in all three species (but was statistically significant only for the child). Nonetheless, across species, the ratio of symbol to gesture increased significantly with age. But even though their symbol production increased, the apes continued to communicate more frequently by gesture than by symbol. In contrast, by 15 - 18 months of age, the child used symbols more frequently than gestures. This ontogenetic sequence from gesture to symbol, present across the clade but more pronounced in child than ape, provides support for the role of gesture in language evolution. In all three species, <b>the</b> overwhelming <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> gestures were communicative (paired with eye-contact, vocalization, and/or persistence). However, vocalization was rare for <b>the</b> apes, but <b>accompanied</b> <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> child’s communicative gestures. This finding suggests the co-evolution of speech and gesture after the evolutionary divergence of the hominid line. Multimodal expressions of communicative intent (e. g., vocalization plus persistence) were normative for the child, but less common for the apes. This finding suggests that multimodal expression of communicative intent was also strengthened after hominids diverged from apes...|$|R

In this study, the basic needs of children on haemodialysis were determined {{in order to improve}} the conditions of their therapy environment. Methods. The requirements of 20 children and 40 adults, who were on haemodialysis therapy for a minimum of five sessions, were recorded by means of a questionnaire. Results. <b>The</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> children and adults preferred to be treated in separate units. All children and adults stated that they needed a constant transportation facility to be provided by the dialysis unit. All children wanted their par-ents/relatives to be with them during the dialysis sessions while only a minority of adults required an <b>accompanying</b> relative. <b>The</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> both paediatric and adult patients preferred daytime sessions. <b>The</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> children pre-ferred to have the same nurse to needle their fistula and supervise their therapy session.

The main clinical symptom was difficulty in breathing, <b>accompanied</b> in <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> cases by attacks of asphyxia, cough with mucous phlegm, and haemoptysis. The following operations were performed: circular resection of the trachea with end-to-end anastomosis, thoracic tracheotomy with enucleation of the tumour, fenestral resection with auto-alloplasty of the ensuing defect, piecemeal removal of the tumour through the lumen of the trachea, and intrathoracic tracheotomy with biopsy of the tumour. All patients were discharged after the operation. When giving an anaesthetic during an operation on the thoracic portion of the trachea it is expedient to introduce a tube into the left main bronchus from the right pleural cavity and to exclude the right lung from ventilation. These measures ensure convenience of manipulation of the trachea, unhampered {{by the presence of}} a tube.

40|$|Phosphatidylinositol 4, 5 -biphosphate (PIP 2) {{has been}} implicated {{in a variety of}} {{cellular}} processes, including synaptic vesicle recycling. However, {{little is known about the}} spatial distribution of this phospholipid in neurons and its dynamics. In this study, we have focused on these questions by transiently expressing the phospholipase C (PLC) -δ 1 pleckstrin homology (PH) domain fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) in cultured hippocampal neurons. This PH domain binds specifically and with high affinity to PIP 2. Live confocal imaging revealed that in resting cells, PH-GFP is localized predominantly on the plasma membrane. Interestingly, no association of PH-GFP with synaptic vesicles in quiescent neurons was observed, indicating the absence of detectable PIP 2 on mature synaptic vesicles. Electrical stimulation of hippocampal neurons resulted in a decrease of the PH-GFP signal at the plasma membrane, most probably due to a PLC-mediated hydrolysis of PIP 2. This was <b>accompanied</b> in <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> presynaptic terminals by a marked increase in the cytoplasmic PH-GFP signal, localized most probably on freshly endocytosed membranes. Further investigation revealed that the increase in PH-GFP signal was dependent on the activation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and the consequent production of nitric oxide (NO). Thus, PIP 2 in the presynaptic terminal appears to be regulated by postsynaptic activity via a retrograde action of NO...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — As {{the yearly}} {{electric}} energy demand grows, {{there is a}} significant increase in the penetration of distributed generation (DG) to fulfil this increase in demand. Interconnecting DG to an existing distribution system provides various benefits to several entities. DG provides an enhanced power quality, higher reliability of the distribution system and can peak shaves and fill valleys. However, the integration of DG into existing networks has associated several technical, economical and regulatory questions. Distribution system design and planning are key features for determining the best expansion strategies to provide reliable and economic services to the customer. Transfer of electric energy from the source of generation to the customer via the transmission and distribution networks is <b>accompanied</b> by losses. <b>The</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> these losses occur on the distribution system. Placement of distributed generators on the distribution system can lead to a reduction in power losses.

40|$|Cadmium is an oligoelement {{which is}} not {{essential}} for biological systems but is toxic to most organisms. It is widely distributed in the environment at relatively low concentrations (Dunnick et al. 1988). It is {{not found in the}} free state but <b>accompanies</b> Zn in <b>the</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> its minerals. It is used almost exclusively to form alloys, metal for ball bearings, for soldering, in batteries and electric accumulators and as an anticorrosive. Its resi-dues have contaminated the environment and its presence in sedimentation sludges used to manufacture fertilizers has given rise to an increase in the content of this metal in trophic chains. The inhalation of industrial powders and smoke represents the principal form of occupational exposure. For the general population the major route of exposure is food, because vegetables absorb it from contaminated soil and water. Tobacco is an even more important source, as absorption of inhaled particles ranges from 10 to 60 %, depending on their size and solubility (Nordberg et al. 1985). The literature indicates great variability in the concentrations of this element in foods in different countries, but in general the concentration ranges between 0. 005 - 0. 1 mg/kg wet weight (Friberg et al. 1986). The lowest concentrations in foods are found in milk and dairy products (a few ~g/Kg), followed by meat, fish and fruit, (1 - 50 ~g/Kg), vegetables and cereals (0. 01 - 0. 15 mg/Kg).

40|$|A {{growing trend}} of {{overweight}} and obesity {{in children and}} consequently a rise in modern civilization diseases in adulthood, contributed {{to the formation of}} the programmes encouraging children and adolescents to obtain healthy eating habits. The School Fruit and Vegetable Scheme {{is a measure of the}} European agricultural policy, which encourages an increase in consumption of fruit and vegetable in children. In order to make the impact of the measure long-term, it is essential to also inform families about the measure, and to encourage them to support the activities related to the measure. In the master´s thesis, we have studied knowledge and attitude of parents of primary school children in the 3 rd, 6 th, and 8 th grade toward the School Fruit and Vegetable Scheme, their observations regarding the influence of the measure on eating habits, and eating knowledge of children and family. The research was based on descriptive and causal-non-experimental method of empirical research. A questionnaire, designed based on the data obtained from professional and science literature, was used as a research instrument. Sampling took place at two primary schools participating in the School Fruit and Vegetable Scheme, and the sample encompassed 224 parents. We have established that in general parents are poorly informed about the School Fruit and Vegetable Scheme measure, and many of them do not even know the measure. An important establishment is that there are differences among the schools regarding informing the parents about the measure, which is also reflected in knowledge about the measure among the parents. Parents, whom the measure have already been introduced, had a more positive point of view on the scheme compared to those who were not introduced to the measure. It has turned out that there are differences among the schools in regard to implementation of the measure. The differences are in the frequency and constancy of distributing fruit and vegetable. One school distributes only fruit, and the other one distributes fruit as well as vegetable. Accompanying activities are not organized at one school, while the other school organizes science days and farm visits, but neither of the schools have included parents in <b>the</b> <b>accompanying</b> activities. <b>The</b> <b>majority</b> <b>of</b> parents have a positive attitude toward free distribution of fruit and vegetable at school, but they do not observe a significant impact on eating habits of children. The results of the research revealed that parents need to be more systematically informed about the School Fruit and Vegetable Scheme, and it is also necessary to establish a better communication among them and school and actively involve them in activities. In regard to the imperfections in implementation of the measure, a control over its implementation should be improved. ...|$|R
