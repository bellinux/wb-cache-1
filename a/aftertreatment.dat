This process avoided harsh reaction conditions or complicated <b>aftertreatments</b> and thus owned the merits of green synthesis, handy operation, low cost, and easy purification. The ESM-templated MnO 2 nanoparticles (MnO 2 NPs/ESM) were characterized, {{and the content of}} nanomaterials on the template was tested. MnO 2 NPs/ESM showed a good capacity for decontamination of tetracycline hydrochloride (TCH). The macroscopical materials can be separated easily by taking the membrane out to stop the degradation instead of centrifugation or filtration. It was studied that 72.27 % of TCH (50  mg/L) was decontaminated in 20  min by 0.1920  g/L MnO 2 nanoparticles, and removal efficiency could reach 83.10 % after 60  min under buffered condition. The kinetics was studied with or without buffer, and it was concluded that the degradation process followed a pseudo-second-order model. The facile synthesis of materials and effective degradation would facilitate the nano-MnO 2 -based decontamination applications.|$|R

Fourteensubjects completed the study. The VRT group was exposedto the virtual reality public speaking scene while thecomparison group was exposed to a trivial virtual realityscene and guided by the experimenters to manage theirphobia either by using visualization techniques or selfexposureto the situation they feared. The VRT andcomparison group sessions were conducted on an individualbasis over a five week period. Two assessment measureswere used in this study.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this econometric {{analysis}} is to model the concentration of particle number emissions from a hybrid diesel-electric bus in terms of operating characteristics. Important aspects {{of this study are}} that particle number concentrations are modeled instead of particle mass, and the emissions are recorded using on-board instrumentation in real-world driving conditions. The operating characteristics included in the final models are two engine parameters: fuel rate and engine speed and two vehicle parameters: velocity and acceleration. The emissions data possess properties that frequently cause problems in regression analysis: nonstationarity, multicollinearity, heteroscedasticity, and autocorrelation. Methods for overcoming and/or minimizing the effects of these properties are implemented. The Newey-West autocorrelation consistent covariance estimator is implemented using ordinary least squares (OLS) to produce a model that accounts for heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation, without requiring assumptions to be made about the structure of the model disturbances. A first-order autoregressive process is used with feasible generalized least squares as a comparative model. Both models have similar coefficients, fit and predictive capability. However the models are specific in scope to typical freeway driving conditions. In future studies, the researchers anticipate applying econometric analysis to model particle number emissions among different routes, bus technologies, <b>aftertreatments,</b> and atmospheric conditions.

40|$|N the 1980 s vat dyes, bearing {{about 60}} 1 C. I. Names (I), were {{available}} in the U. S. under about 260 different trade names. This collection of dyes has not changed much in recent years. About 60 % of them have C. I. Numbers-i. e., ihe chemical structure of the principle color component is known; 85 % are derivatives of anthraquinone, and of these almost 50 % fall into only five chemical structure subgroups; indigo derivatives and the related thioindigo derivatives account for about 10 % of the list. As a class, vat dyes are expensive, although they share this characteristic with some fiber reactive dyes. One shouid not overlook the 10 % of so-called sulfurized vat dyes, which are more economical hybrids of sulfur and vat dyes. The practical details of using vat dyes in both batch and continuous processes are covered in this second and final part of Chapter 3. Vat dyes generally offer superior fastness properties. Potential drawbacks to selecting vat dyes include a tendency for phototendering and a limited color gamut. Based on the substantivities of leuco-vat anions, the traditional classification system for vat dyes offers batch dyers a better means for selecting vat dyes to be used successfully in combination. Leuco-vat dyeing, prepigmentation, semipigmentation and batch <b>aftertreatments</b> are covered.

40|$|In {{the urban}} {{environment}} road traffic {{is the dominant}} source of aerosol particles while in coastal and harbour areas shipping is also a significant source. For shipping there are no direct regulations regarding particle emissions. For road traffic the emissions of particle mass has been regulated for over two decades but only {{during the last few}} years particle number has been included in emission regulations. Generally, nanoparticles are better described by their number rather than mass since they contribute insignificantly to the total particle mass of urban particles. Furthermore, particle number is believed to be a better metric for describing health effects than particle mass. Particle number and mass of the nanoparticles is however more difficult to measure both because of their small size but also because {{they are part of a}} highly dynamic system with constant exchange with the gas phase. The studies described in this thesis were conducted with the aim of increasing the knowledge on the emissions of nanoparticles from shipping and city transit buses. The focus has been on size resolved particle number emissions. The evolution of nanoparticles was studied by conducting measurements by extractions from the inside of the exhaust system and from the exhaust plume. Emissions of nanoparticles depend on combustion conditions, exhaust <b>aftertreatments,</b> the fuel and ship/vehicle variations. In this study engine load and engine speed was found to be the most important factors studying individual vehicles or ships. For example, manoeuvring of a ship in the port areas was found to contribute to up to a factor of 64 times higher particle number emissions than during stable engine load at open sea. It was found the variation between vehicles or ships was the most important factor when studying a fleet of vehicles or ships operating on different fuels and/or exhaust <b>aftertreatments.</b> For example, from a selection of 35 buses a few diesel fuelled buses were responsible for most of the particle mass emissions while a few buses fuelled with compressed natural gas were responsible for most of the particle number emissions. Controlling these extreme emitting individuals or specific operating conditions could be an effective way of reducing the total emission of nanoparticles. Nanoparticles extracted from the exhaust system are different compared to the nanoparticles found in the exhaust plume. In the ship exhaust system a soot mode was often found together with a volatile nucleation mode. In the ship exhaust plume the volatile nucleation mode coagulated quickly leaving soot covered with volatile material. Soot emissions were lower for the studied buses which supress condensation and the lower total number concentrations in the bus emissions reduce the rate of coagulation. Nucleation mode particles for the studied buses were found both in the exhaust system and in the exhaust plume. Nucleation versus condensation of volatile material has implications for the measured particle number and in addition, soot covered with volatile material has a denser structure than soot without condensable material. Non-volatile particles with a diameter of ~ 10 nm were found in the ship plume measurements which were not present in the on-board measurements. A hypothesis of organo-sulphates being formed in the exhaust plume was presented which could explain the formation of these particles. This emphasis that processes in the atmosphere can be of importance but they will not be covered in on-board or laboratory measurements...|$|R
40|$|Environmental {{pollutant}} exposures {{are major}} {{risk factors for}} adverse health outcomes, with increased morbidity and mortality in humans. Diesel exhaust (DE) {{is one of the}} major harmful components of traffic-related air pollution. Exposure to DE affects several physiological systems, including the airways, and pulmonary diseases are increased in highly populated urban areas. Hence, there are urgent needs to (1) create newer and lesser polluting fuels, (2) improve exhaust <b>aftertreatments</b> and reduce emissions, and (3) understand mechanisms of actions for toxic effects of both conventional and cleaner diesel fuels on the lungs. These steps could aid the development of diagnostics and interventions to prevent the negative impact of traffic-related air pollution on the pulmonary system. Exhaust from conventional, and to a lesser extent, clean fuels, contains particulate matter (PM) and more than 400 additional chemical constituents. The major toxic constituents are nitrogen oxides (NOx) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PM and PAHs could potentially act via transient receptor potential (TRP) channels. In this review, we will first discuss the associations between DE from conventional as well as clean fuel technologies and acute and chronic airway inflammation. We will then review possible activation and/or potentiation of TRP vanilloid type 1 (TRPV 1) and ankyrin 1 (TRPA 1) channels by PM and PAHs. Finally, we will discuss and summarize recent findings on the mechanisms whereby TRPs could control the link between DE and airway inflammation, which is a primary determinant leading to pulmonary disease.

40|$|An {{independent}} controller {{was proposed}} to perform real-time diagnosis and modeling based control for diesel <b>aftertreatment</b> devices, {{such as the}} diesel particulate filters (DPF) and the lean NOx traps (LNT). The diesel <b>aftertreatment</b> devices for this research were in active flow control configuration. As opposed to passive <b>aftertreatment</b> control where the engine tailors the raw exhaust conditions, in active <b>aftertreatment</b> configuration, the raw exhaust conditions were modified with independent controls, such as <b>aftertreatment</b> temperature control, exhaust flow control, and <b>aftertreatment</b> excess air/fuel ratio (A) control. The determination of the diesel engine transient exhaust gas temperature is essential for effective active flow <b>aftertreatment</b> control schemes. To overcome the slow response of the high-inertia thermocouples used in the harsh diesel exhaust environment, a temperature response model was developed {{as part of this}} research. The temperature response model was verified by tests conducted on a Yanmar NFD 170 single cylinder diesel engine setup.

Formaldehyde is toxic and carcinogenic. According to the worldwide standards, acceptable limit of free formaldehyde release, for the fabrics that have skin contact, is only 75 ppm (measured by water extraction method). In this research, a cotton fabric flame retardant finished in an industrial plant in Pakistan is used. Fabric is finished by the application of THPC urea precondensate and ammonia cured, oxidized and washed. After finishing, it is not aftertreated with sodium metabisulfite that is a commonly used <b>aftertreatment</b> method for the reduction of free formaldehyde release. <b>Aftertreatment</b> with sodium metabisulfite has various problems that include large number of hot washings {{and there is an}} increase in the formaldehyde release during fabric storage. If the fabric has 75 ppm of free formaldehyde, there is often an increase in free formaldehyde release during fabric storage. There is a very limited research on the <b>aftertreatment</b> methods and few reports of application of these aftertreatments on flame retardant fabrics have been published. In this research, two methods of aftertreatments are developed to reduce the free formaldehyde contents to 75 ppm or less. One is the <b>aftertreatment</b> with a combination of resorcinol 1 % and diethylene glycol 4 %. The other is the combination of resorcinol 1 % and boric acid 6 %.
