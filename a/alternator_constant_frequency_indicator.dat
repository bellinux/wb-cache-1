This dissertation {{covers the}} commissioning {{and testing of}} an aircraft's <b>constant</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>alternator</b> as the power supply for the Blue Parrot radar. The Blue Parrot is an X-band radar which forms part of the navigation and weapon-aiming system onboard the Buccaneer S- 50 SAAF aircraft. The radar set uses a source of three-phase power at 400 Hz, which the <b>constant</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>alternator</b> can supply {{with the aid of}} certain auxiliary systems. The auxiliary systems include a prime mover, blower fan and a telemetering system. The prime mover has high starting currents which were reduced significantly by the use of a soft-starter. During testing, the <b>constant</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>alternator</b> started overheating and a blower fan was selected based on its thermal requirements. Significant cooling of the <b>constant</b> <b>frequency</b> <b>alternator's</b> case temperature was achieved by the use of a blower fan and shroud.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the results of}} NMR relaxation studies of fast ion glasses {{in the light of}} variable frequency electrical conductivity measurements. We show that the low activation energy observed for relaxation processes studied at <b>constant</b> <b>frequency</b> below the temperature of the T 1 minimum is reproduced by the corresponding <b>constant</b> <b>frequency</b> conductivity measurements. Other characteristics of the <b>constant</b> <b>frequency</b> conductivity in this low activation energy regime, such as the unphysically low pre-exponent, match with the corresponding observations for NMR measurements. Since the activation energy observed at <b>constant</b> <b>frequency</b> in the frequency-dependent regime for conductivity depends on the characteristic departure from exponential relaxation for the conductivity process, we conclude that the NMR activation energy is likewise a simple consequence of the nonexponential character of ionic relaxation in the glass. In this case, the low activation energy attributed to processes probed by NMR relaxation is simply a misinterpretation since it is found, in the wide frequency range studies available to admittance bridge measurements, that all elements of the relaxation spectrum have essentially equal activation energies...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} a {{comparative}} study {{of the features of}} <b>constant</b> <b>frequency</b> and variable frequency current control schemes for power factor correction in AC-DC converter circuits. [...] Various current control schemes for achieving nearly unity power factor at the input and to minimize the total harmonic distortion (THD) are in use in various applications such as television, radio receivers, AC-motor drives, DC-motor drives and uninterruptible power supplies (UPS). [...] Analytical models of <b>Constant</b> <b>Frequency</b> Continuous Current (CFCC), <b>Constant</b> <b>Frequency</b> Discontinuous Current (CFDC), Zero-Current Zero-Voltage Switching (ZCS-ZVS) and Variable Current Hysteresis Control (VCHC) are developed and used to evaluate the performance of the power factor correction circuit. The main features of these control schemes are highlighted and the performance characteristics are obtained through computer simulation for the same circuit conditions. Design examples of each control scheme, and power loss calculation associated with the active switching device are also provided. It is shown that active current waveshaping through <b>constant</b> and variable <b>frequency</b> control schemes posseses many attractive features...|$|R

Induction generators for stand-alone applications have the advantage of being rugged and cheap, but to make full use of the wind resource without an elaborate control system a <b>constant</b> <b>frequency</b> output is not easily or economically attained. The use of a direct-drive, axial-airgap induction generator is proposed, capable of local manufacture - in full or in part - which will deliver variable frequency and voltage for low quality loads, but have the capability for a more <b>constant</b> <b>frequency</b> and voltage output for high quality loads.

40|$|The {{origin and}} {{maintenance}} of intraspecific variation in vocal signals is important for population divergence and speciation. Where vocalizations are transmitted by vertical cultural inheritance, similarity will reflect co-ancestry, and thus vocal divergence should reflect genetic structure. Horseshoe bats are characterized by echolocation calls dominated by a <b>constant</b> <b>frequency</b> component that is partly determined by maternal imprinting. Although previous studies showed that <b>constant</b> <b>frequency</b> calls are also influenced by some non-genetic factors, {{it is not known}} how frequency relates to genetic structure. To test this, we related <b>constant</b> <b>frequency</b> variation to genetic and non-genetic variables in the Formosan lesser horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus monoceros). Recordings of bats from across Taiwan revealed that females called at higher frequencies than males; however, we found no effect of environmental or morphological factors on call frequency. By comparison, variation showed clear population structure, with frequencies lower in the centre and east, and higher in the north and south. Within these regions, frequency divergence was directional and correlated with geographical distance, suggesting that call frequencies are subject to cultural drift. However, microsatellite clustering analysis showed that broad differences in <b>constant</b> <b>frequency</b> among populations corresponded to discontinuities in allele frequencies resulting from vicariant events. Our results provide evidence that the processes shaping genetic subdivision have concomitant consequences for divergence in echolocation call frequency...|$|R
