Besides the three negroes who had been hired, there were seven volunteers--some big <b>and</b> <b>some</b> little--who <b>were</b> very {{willing to work for}} nothing, if they might have a ride on the sled. The harness was not the best in the world; <b>some</b> of it <b>was</b> leather, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>was</b> rope <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>was</b> chain. It was gathered together from various quarters, like the team--nobody seemed anxious to lend good harness.|$|R
5|$|Crickets {{are found}} in many habitats. Members of several subfamilies {{are found in}} the upper tree canopy, in bushes, and among grasses and herbs. They also occur on the ground and in caves, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>are</b> subterranean, {{excavating}} shallow or deep burrows. Some make galleries in rotting wood, and certain beach-dwelling species can run and jump over the surface of pools.|$|E

5|$|A gene is a {{sequence}} of DNA or RNA which codes for a molecule that has a function. The DNA is first copied into RNA. The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function. The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring {{is the basis of}} the inheritance of phenotypic traits. These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes. Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be. Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as geneâ€“environment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye color or number of limbs, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>are</b> not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life.|$|E
5|$|All {{that is left}} of Missouri Row is a four-sided {{concrete}} fireplace {{surrounded by}} pieces of foundation, a few sets of stairs, metal plumbing, and a retaining wall. East of that, surrounding {{what is now the}} Monte Ne boat launch, are remnants of limestone structures. Some of these are foundations from the broad wooden staircase built in front of Hotel Monte Ne; some are structural components for the twin stone bridges that crossed the lagoon <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>are</b> simply low retaining walls. The amphitheater and the retaining wall built for the Pyramid are underwater. Occasionally, when water levels drop in summer, they can be seen.|$|E
5|$|Although slight {{changes in}} water level affect many species, {{the system as}} a whole also cycles and pulses with each change. Some transformations to the {{diversity}} of plant and animal life are natural, caused by fire or storms, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>are</b> induced by humans, such as urban encroachment, the introduction of exotic species, and rapid global warming. Environmental conditions in the Everglades favor no particular species. Some species, such as snail kites and apple snails, do well in wet conditions, but wood storks and Cape Sable seaside sparrows (Ammodramus maritimus mirabilis) do well in dryer circumstances.|$|E

5|$|At {{the base}} of the {{bacterial}} flagellum, where it enters the cell membrane, a motor protein acts as a rotary engine. The engine is powered by proton motive force, i.e. by the flow of protons (hydrogen ions) across the bacterial cell membrane due to a concentration gradient set up by the cell's metabolism. (In species of the genus Vibrio, {{there are two kinds of}} flagella, lateral and polar, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>are</b> driven by a sodium ion pump rather than a proton pump.) Flagella are quite efficient, allowing bacteria to move at speeds of up to 60cell lengths per second. The rotary motor at {{the base of}} the flagellum is similar in structure to ATP synthase. Spirillum bacteria have helical bodies with flagella at either end, and they spin about the central axis of their bodies as they move through the water.|$|E
5|$|Chicago Landmark is a {{designation}} of the Mayor of Chicago and the Chicago City Council for historic buildings and other sites in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Listed sites are selected after meeting {{a combination of}} criteria, including historical, economic, architectural, artistic, cultural, and social values. Once a site is designated as a landmark, it {{is subject to the}} Chicago Landmarks Ordinance, which requires that any alterations beyond routine maintenance, up to and including demolition, must have their permit reviewed by the Landmarks Commission. Many Chicago Landmarks are also listed on the National Register of Historic Places, providing federal tax support for preservation, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>are</b> further designated National Historic Landmarks, providing additional federal oversight.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilians are large, low-slung aquatic {{reptiles}} {{with long}} snouts and {{large numbers of}} teeth. The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed. It undulates {{from side to side}} to force the animal through the water when swimming. The tough keratinized scales provide body armour <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>are</b> fused to the skull. The nostrils, eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above {{the surface of the water}} when the animal is floating. Valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged. Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.|$|E

5|$|Macrolepiota clelandii, {{commonly}} known as the slender parasol or graceful parasol, is a species of mushroom-forming fungus in the family Lepiotaceae. The species is found in Australia and New Zealand, where it fruits singly or in small groups on the ground in eucalypt woodlands, parks, and roadsides. It is a tall mushroom up to roughly , with a broad cap covered with distinctive rings of dark brown scales. The whitish gills on the cap underside are closely spaced and free from attachment to the slender stipe, which has a loose ring on its upper half, and a bulbous base. The edibility of the mushroom is not known with certainty, but closely related parasol mushrooms are edible <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>are</b> very sought after.|$|E
5|$|Mainly {{active at}} night, the sharptooth houndshark feeds mostly on crustaceans, bony fishes, and cephalopods. It has been {{observed}} gathering in groups in shallow water during summertime, possibly for reproductive purposes. This species is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the unborn young are sustained mainly by yolk. Females give birth to 6â€“12 pups between late May and August, on a two- or three-year cycle. The sharptooth houndshark is often hooked by recreational anglers, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>are</b> also captured on commercial bottom longlines. Because of its small range, its low growth and reproductive rates, it is very vulnerable to overfishing. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has therefore listed this species as Near Threatened.|$|E
5|$|Malaysians {{observe a}} number of {{holidays}} and festivities throughout the year. Some are federally gazetted public holidays <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>are</b> observed by individual states. Other festivals are observed by particular ethnic or religion groups, and the main holiday of each major group has been declared a public holiday. The most observed national holiday is Hari Merdeka (Independence Day) on 31 August, commemorating {{the independence of the}} Federation of Malaya in 1957. Malaysia Day on 16 September commemorates federation in 1963. Other notable national holidays are Labour Day (1 May) and the King's birthday (first week of June).|$|E

5|$|Many notable {{people have}} either lived or {{stayed in the}} Royal Crescent since it was first built over 240 years ago, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>are</b> commemorated on special plaques {{attached}} to the relevant buildings. Of the Royal Crescent's 30 townhouses, 10 are still full-size townhouses; 18 have been split into flats of various sizes; 1 is the No. 1 Royal Crescent museum and the large central house at number 16 is the Royal Crescent Hotel.|$|E
5|$|Many unwelcome animals visit or {{make their}} home in {{residential}} buildings, industrial sites and urban areas. Some contaminate foodstuffs, damage structural timbers, chew through fabrics or infest stored dry goods. Some inflict great economic loss, others carry diseases or cause fire hazards, <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>are</b> just a nuisance. Control of these pests has been attempted by improving sanitation and garbage control, modifying the habitat, and using repellents, growth regulators, traps, baits and pesticides.|$|E
5|$|Most {{crustaceans}} are free-living aquatic animals, {{but some}} are terrestrial (e.g. woodlice), some are parasitic (e.g. Rhizocephala, fish lice, tongue worms) <b>and</b> <b>some</b> <b>are</b> sessile (e.g. barnacles). The group has an extensive fossil record, reaching back to the Cambrian, and includes living fossils such as Triops cancriformis, which has existed apparently unchanged since the Triassic period. More than 10 million tons of crustaceans are produced by fishery or farming for human consumption, the majority of it being shrimp and prawns. Krill and copepods are not as widely fished, but may be the animals with the greatest biomass on the planet, and form {{a vital part of}} the food chain. The scientific study of crustaceans is known as carcinology (alternatively, malacostracology, crustaceology or crustalogy), and a scientist who works in carcinology is a carcinologist.|$|E
