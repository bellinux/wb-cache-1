5|$|Morris died in 1896, and {{the health}} of the devastated Burne-Jones {{declined}} substantially. In 1898 he suffered an attack of influenza, and had apparently recovered when he was again taken suddenly ill, and died on 17June 1898. Six days later, at the intervention of the Prince of Wales, a memorial service was held at Westminster Abbey. It was the first time an artist had been so honoured. Burne-Jones was buried in the churchyard at St Margaret's Church, Rottingdean, <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>he</b> knew through summer family holidays.|$|E
5|$|A {{few days}} after this first encounter, on 14 August 1502, Columbus arrived on the {{mainland}} of Honduras. He dropped anchor at <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>he</b> named as Punta Caxinas, afterwards generally known as the Cape of Honduras, near the modern town of Trujillo. He claimed possession of the territory for the king of Spain, and the coastal inhabitants greeted him in a friendly manner. After this he sailed eastward along the coast, struggling against gales and storms for a month, until the coast turned southward along {{what is now the}} east coast of Honduras, and he entered calmer waters. The Spanish named this point Cabo Gracias a Dios, giving thanks for their liberation from the storms. Colombus sailed on southwards as far as Panama, before turning back into the Caribbean Sea to be wrecked off Jamaica, before being rescued and taken to Hispaniola, and from there returning to Spain.|$|E
5|$|Religions {{outside the}} Judeo-Christian {{mainstream}} {{also have a}} home in the city. During the mid-to-late 1950s, members of the Nation of Islam created a temple in north Minneapolis, and the first mosque was built in 1967. In 1972 a relief agency resettled the first Shi'a Muslim family from Uganda. By 2004, between 20,000 and 30,000 Somali Muslims made the city their home. In 1972, Dainin Katagiri was invited from California to Minneapolis—by one account, <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>he</b> thought nobody else would want to go—where he founded a lineage which today includes three Sōtō Zen centers among the city's nearly 20 Buddhist and meditation centers. Atheists For Human Rights has its headquarters in the Shingle Creek neighborhood in a geodesic dome. Minneapolis has had a chartered local body of Ordo Templi Orientis since 1994.|$|E

25|$|Kailasam's {{life was}} {{dedicated}} to local theater and his contributions revolutionised it. His humor left an impression on Kannadigas. He opposed the company theatre's obsession with mythology and stories of royalty and shied away from loading his plays with music. Instead, he introduced simple, realistic sets. Kailasam chaired the Kannada Sahitya Sammelana held at Madras in 1945. He spent almost 10 years in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>he</b> called 'NOOK'. It was a very dirty place, yet he loved it and wrote many dramas in there. He dictated his stories to his students at the 'NOOK', usually starting after 10 pm. He was a chain smoker.|$|E

25|$|Iceland {{was first}} settled around 870. The first {{permanent}} settler in Iceland is usually {{considered to have}} been a Norwegian chieftain named Ingólfr Arnarson. According to the story, he threw two carved pillars overboard as he neared land, vowing to settle wherever they landed. He then sailed along the coast until the pillars were found in the southwestern peninsula, now known as Reykjanesskagi. There he settled with his family around 874, in <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>he</b> named Reykjavík (Bay of Smokes) due to the geothermal steam rising from the earth. It is recognized, however, that Ingólfur Arnarson {{may not have been the}} first one to settle permanently in Iceland— that may have been Náttfari, a slave of Garðar Svavarsson who stayed behind when his master returned to Scandinavia.|$|E
25|$|From 1152 to 1154 Nicholas was in Scandinavia as papal legate, {{establishing}} an independent archepiscopal see for Norway at Trondheim, <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>he</b> chose chiefly {{in honour of}} St Olaf. This led him to create the Diocese at Hamar, and, according to tradition, to form cathedral schools in Norway's bishopric cities. These schools were to have a lasting effect on education and Catholic spirituality in Norway (even after the Reformation in Norway). (Norway's cathedral schools persisted, although they later lost their formal ties to the church.) Nicholas made arrangements {{which resulted in the}} recognition of Gamla Uppsala (Old Uppsala) as seat of the Swedish metropolitan in 1164 (later moved to Uppsala). As compensation for territory thus withdrawn, the Danish archbishop of Lund was made legate and perpetual vicar and given the title of primate of Denmark and Sweden. Nicholas was accompanied to Scandinavia by another English-born priest, Henry, Bishop of Finland (d. 1156), who would later be venerated by Catholics, Lutherans and Anglicans as Saint Henry of Uppsala.|$|E
25|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the battle Sulla erected a trophy which he dedicated to the Roman gods Mars, for delivering victory to Rome, and also to Venus, in the spirit of fortune for the luck granted to the Romans. Further, he held victory games at Thebes, during which he may have been made aware of the approach of Valerius Flaccus who had recently landed in Epirus. Flaccus and Sulla met in Thessaly, though neither army made a move, both armies set up camp and waited for the other to attack. No attack came, and after some time Flaccus' soldiers began to desert in favour of Sulla, at first slowly but with time in increasing numbers, eventually Flaccus had to break camp or lose his entire army. During this time, Archelaus, who had wintered on the Island of Euboea, was reinforced by a large army of Mithridates at Chalcis and decided to move back into Boeotia. Both Sulla and Flaccus were aware of these developments, so, rather than waste Roman troops to fight each other, Flaccus took his soldiers and headed for Asia Minor while Sulla turned back to face Archelaus once again. Sulla moved his army a few miles to the east of Chaeronea and into position near Orchomenos, <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>he</b> chose for its natural entrenchment. Here, Sulla once more, and once again outnumbered, faced off against Archelaus at the Battle of Orchomenus.|$|E

25|$|Hobbs {{was left}} out of the team for the fourth Test; he had {{declined}} an invitation to tour Australia with the MCC in the coming winter, and the selectors wished to try players who might tour. Hobbs' official reason for refusing a place was his uncertain health. Part of the reason, though, was the MCC's position that the wives of professionals could not accompany a touring team; when Hobbs later accepted a place on a privately organised tour of South Africa, on which his wife would accompany him, the MCC and its treasurer, Lord Harris, agreed to change their rules and approached Hobbs again to offer him and his wife <b>a</b> <b>place.</b> <b>He</b> agreed to tour, but only as an extra player so that no other professional was deprived of his place. With the matter concluded, Hobbs returned to the England team for the fifth Test and scored 30. In the series, he scored 355 runs at an average of 71.00, while in all first-class matches he totalled 2,094 runs at 58.16. He finished second in the national averages, and the cricket press noted that, although Hobbs scored more slowly and in less spectacular fashion than previously, he batted in a safer, more secure style which was more successful in terms of run-scoring. R. C. Robertson-Glasgow also noted that Hobbs had transformed his technique to suit the modern style of batting with the batsman's weight on the back foot.|$|E
