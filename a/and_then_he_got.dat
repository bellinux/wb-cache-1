[...] To reflect his transition into adulthood and the changes in his music, Songz changed his appearance by cutting off his trademark braids. Songz also began dressing in more sophisticated attire, trading in sneakers and T-shirts for vests, tailored pants, and [...] "tasteful" [...] shoes. On the appearance change, Songz's mentor, producer, {{and the head of}} Songbook Entertainment, Troy Taylor said, [...] "Trey's from the streets, he's a hood kid. He wasn't glamorous and (didn't have) the finer things in life growing up, [...] He didn't want to lose his street-ism, [...] As he grew into it I think he began to realize, 'Wait a minute, this ain't that bad after all,' <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> the ladies' opinions." ...|$|E
2500|$|At Oslo, Skaat {{explained}} to the press that [...] "Milim" [...] is about loss, such as in a break-up, but that for him, it has a deeper meaning. Skaat said, [...] "this song touches me deeply. My grandfather died {{just days before the}} selections in Israel, and this gives me a very deep feeling, I feel that I'm really singing this song for him. He wanted me to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest for five years, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> to hear that I was going {{to take part in the}} national selection before he passed away." ...|$|E
60|$|For a {{few moments}} Jernyngham looked irresolute, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> up.|$|E

60|$|George Crofts felt {{as though}} he'd burst, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>'e</b> <b>got</b> his breath, <b>and</b> the things 'e said about Uncle Joe was so awful that Mrs. Mitchell told the boys to go away.|$|R
60|$|He {{sat there}} holding 'is breath and not daring to move until the cabman 'ad shut {{the gate and}} was driving off up the road, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>'e</b> <b>got</b> up on the seat and lolled back out of sight. The shops were just opening, the sun was shining, and Sam felt so well that 'e was thankful that <b>'e</b> hadn't <b>got</b> to the horsepittle arter all.|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} me for a minute, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> into the chair, and I shut him up.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> it--suddenly, when he wasn't {{set for the}} punch; and {{he rocked}} back on his heels.|$|E

60|$|Ginger--who was minding Sam's {{money for}} 'im because there wasn't a pocket in the counterpane--paid 'im, and the cab started. It jolted and rattled over the stones, but Sam said {{the air was}} doing 'im good. He kept 'is pluck up until they got close to the horsepittle, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>'e</b> <b>got</b> nervous. <b>And</b> <b>'e</b> <b>got</b> more nervous when the cabman got down off 'is box and put his 'ed in at the winder and spoke to 'im.|$|R
6000|$|... "Here I am, Captain Putnam!" [...] <b>he</b> called out. <b>And</b> <b>then,</b> as <b>he</b> <b>got</b> no reply, <b>he</b> called again. By {{this time}} the captain was awake, and coming to the flap, he peered out.|$|R
6000|$|... "Feel that tinglin'?" [...] asked. Whitwell, and Jackson made yes with silent lips.

Writin' steady enough now, Jackson!" [...] he cried, joyously. [...] "Let's see." [...] He leaned over and read, [...] "Thomas Jefferson--" [...] The planchette stopped, [...] "My, I didn't go to do that," [...] said Whitwell, apologetically.

60|$|George {{told the}} cabman, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> {{in and sat}} on Ted's knee, partly on Gerty's umbrella, and mostly on nothing.|$|E
6000|$|... "You may {{be right}} about that," [...] {{admitted}} Fogerty; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> up to answer the door-bell, which once more rang violently.|$|E
6000|$|... "A bit," [...] {{she replied}} slowly. [...] "And then he {{seemed as if}} he couldn't get AT me, really. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> brutal--he WAS brutal!" ...|$|E

60|$|I {{gathered}} from this fellow's exclamation {{that he was}} divided between amaze <b>and</b> mirth. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> up from the steps {{and went into the}} restaurant and was followed by the man called Jim. Before the door was closed he made another remark, but it was unintelligible to me.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>got</b> {{his early}} {{education}} from his uncle Shams-ul-Ulma (Grand Scholar) Syed Mir Hassan, Professor of Arabic <b>and</b> Persian language. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> his education from Maulana Aslam Jairajpuri.|$|R
60|$|All Jackson's impositions, {{according}} to him, were given him for doing practically nothing. Now <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> them for doing literally nothing--when {{he ought to}} have been doing form-work.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{to think}} you got so close to {{capturing}} him <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> away!" [...] was the sad comment of the senator's son. [...] "It does beat all how slippery some of those rascals are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{stayed in}} bed for another 'arf-hour, {{listening}} to Peter and Ginger telling each other in loud whispers 'ow hungry they was, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> up and put 'is things on {{and went to the}} door.|$|E
60|$|He put the piglets safely away in {{his pocket}} again <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Zeb <b>got</b> into the buggy and sat expectantly upon the seat.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hi! {{get off of}} me, you rascal!" [...] spluttered the professor, and thrashed around wildly. [...] "Get off of me! Who are you, anyway?"

6000|$|... "Oh no, {{of course}} not," [...] said Aaron, joyously, {{and his face}} became radiant and happy. [...] "And I do beg your pardon for burning it; and the young ladies' pardon too." [...] <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> rapidly <b>got</b> out his cardboard, and set himself to work about another bridge.

6000|$|At last he {{said that}} he would think of it, and consult his partner; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> up to take his leave. [...] "For myself," [...] said Miss Stanbury, [...] "I would wish that all animosities might be buried." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps. But we didn't do it, I {{can assure}} you of that. If Mr. Sparr has us arrested, he'll get in hot water," [...] {{answered}} our hero; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> out of the wagon and Andy Prime drove on.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why? I {{was sick}} of him--ain't that enough? <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> mixed up with a Glendale trolley and smashed his radiator, and the Wizard people sacked him. I always {{told him he was}} too fly. It's lucky for him I wasn't in the car." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I winna," [...] he {{answered}} miserably, [...] "no, I winna. Forgive me, Grizel; I think I'll be stepping"; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> when <b>he</b> <b>got</b> {{as far as}} the door he would say, [...] "I canna do 't, Grizel; I'm just terrible wae for the woman (if sic a woman there be), but I canna think ill o' him; you mauna speir it o' me." ...|$|R
50|$|He {{struggled}} doing {{odd jobs}} and addiction by taking acting lessons from coaches like David Gideon <b>and</b> Ed Kovens. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> {{a role in}} the 2002 film Skins, which then lead to Dreamkeeper, and Into the West.|$|R
60|$|How came he to stay? Sally {{told him}} every other minute to go; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> when <b>he</b> had <b>got</b> fairly {{out of the}} door, called him back {{to tell him that}} there was {{something}} she had heard about him. And Moses of course came back; wanted to know what it was; and couldn't be told, it was a secret; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> would be ordered off, and reminded that he promised to go straight home; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> when <b>he</b> <b>got</b> a little farther off she called after him a second time, to tell him that he would be very much surprised if he knew how she found it out, etc., etc.,--till at last tea being ready, there was no reason why he shouldn't have a cup.

6000|$|... "Job swore honour bright he would, {{but nobody}} {{believed}} ’im, {{and at last}} he called for pen and ink and wrote it all down on a sheet o’ paper and signed it, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> two other chaps to sign it as witnesses.|$|E
60|$|I did my best. After that we didn't {{speak for}} a fortnight. Whenever he {{approached}} me I frowned and motioned him away, and he respected our compact, {{but at the}} end of a fortnight he was as fat as ever. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> a word in.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm not sick!" [...] cried Tom. [...] "I'm sorry I {{played the}} trick, but I don't {{see any reason}} for Stanley and Spud to cut up about it." [...] <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> up as {{suddenly}} as he had sat down and stalked on once more.|$|E

6000|$|... "I think <b>he's</b> <b>got</b> {{a career}} before him," [...] said Serena; [...] "the House always fills when he's speaking, and that's a good sign. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>he's</b> young <b>and</b> <b>got</b> rather an {{attractive}} personality, {{which is always}} something in the political world." ...|$|R
