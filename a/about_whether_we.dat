5000|$|By mid April Defence Minister MacKay {{had taken}} the {{approach}} that the Auditor General and his department merely disagreed as to what {{should be included in}} the aircraft's life cycle costs. The National Post's Andrew Coyne pointed out that DND had agreed with the Auditor General in 2010, after a similar disagreement about the Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone costing, that all life cycle costs be included in future reports. Coyne explained [...] "once that claim is knocked down — that this was all just a dispute over accounting — there is no escape. The government knowingly misrepresented the true costs of the F-35 in its public statements. It knew how it was supposed to account for these, under Treasury Board rules, under the Auditor-General’s recommendation, and by its own publicly stated agreement with both. And it knew how it was doing so in its own internal documents, going back to 2010. It simply chose to tell a different story to Parliament and the public." [...] Like many journalists Coyne saw this as a much bigger issue than an aircraft purchase. [...] "This isn’t about the planes, in other words, or costs, or accounting. This is about accountability. This is about whether departments are answerable to their ministers, and whether ministers are answerable to Parliament — or whether billions of public dollars can be appropriated without the informed consent of either Parliament or the public. It is about whether ministers speak for their departments, or can disown them when it suits them. And it is <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> <b>we,</b> as citizens, are prepared to pay attention, and hold people in power to account when they lie to us.
