5|$|The fusion rate in {{the core}} is in a self-correcting equilibrium: a {{slightly}} higher rate of fusion would cause the core to heat up more <b>and</b> expand <b>slightly</b> against {{the weight of the}} outer layers, reducing the density and hence the fusion rate and correcting the perturbation; <b>and</b> a <b>slightly</b> lower rate would cause the core to cool <b>and</b> shrink <b>slightly,</b> increasing the density and increasing the fusion rate and again reverting it to its present rate.|$|R

5|$|Catawissa Creek {{starts in}} Luzerne County, {{not far from}} Hazleton. It flows west <b>and</b> <b>slightly</b> south into Schuylkill County before flowing north into Columbia County and then west to the Susquehanna River, which it flows into at Catawissa.

5|$|Einar Jolin (7 August 189029 August 1976) was a Swedish painter {{best known}} for his {{decorative}} <b>and</b> <b>slightly</b> naïve Expressionist style. After studying at Konstfack, Stockholm in 1906 and at the Konstnärsförbundet målarskola (the Artists Association Art School), Jolin and his friend Isaac Grünewald went to Paris for further studies at Henri Matisse's academy from 1908 to 1914.|$|E
50|$|The rate {{of nuclear}} fusion depends {{strongly}} on density. Therefore, the fusion {{rate in the}} core is in a self-correcting equilibrium: a slightly higher rate of fusion would cause the core to heat up more <b>and</b> expand <b>slightly</b> against {{the weight of the}} outer layers. This would reduce the fusion rate and correct the perturbation; <b>and</b> a <b>slightly</b> lower rate would cause the core to cool <b>and</b> shrink <b>slightly,</b> increasing the fusion rate and again reverting it to its present level.|$|R

It is freely soluble in methanol and acetone; soluble in water, ethanol, 0.01 M hydrochloric acid, and 0.01 M sodium hydroxide; sparingly soluble in isopropyl alcohol <b>and</b> acetonitrile; <b>slightly</b> soluble in diethyl ether; <b>and</b> very <b>slightly</b> soluble in isopropyl ether.|$|R

5|$|In Australia, {{particularly}} the Margaret River region, the grape is often blended with Sémillon. Varietal styles, made from only the Sauvignon blanc grape, from Adelaide Hills and Padthaway have a style distinctive from their New Zealand neighbors {{that tend to}} be more ripe in flavor with white peach and lime notes <b>and</b> <b>slightly</b> higher acidity.|$|E
5|$|In {{regards to}} the 6 Plus, Engadget panned its design for being uncomfortable to hold and harder to grip in {{comparison}} to other devices such as the Galaxy Note 3 and LG G3, but praised its inclusion of optical image stabilization <b>and</b> <b>slightly</b> better battery life than the 6.|$|E
5|$|Kepler-9c is a gas giant that {{is smaller}} <b>and</b> <b>slightly</b> less massive than planet Saturn. It is {{approximately}} 0.171 MJ, or 17% {{the mass of}} planet Jupiter. It also has a radius of 0.823 RJ, which makes it slightly smaller (1.5%) than Saturn. The planet is, on average, situated 0.225 AU from the star.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-9d's {{name comes}} from it being the third planet {{discovered}} in the orbit of Kepler-9. Kepler-9 was named for the Kepler spacecraft, a NASA satellite that aims to discover terrestrial planets in transit around, or crossing in front of, their host stars as seen from Earth. This transit causes a regular interval in which the star briefly <b>and</b> <b>slightly</b> dims as the planet crosses it.|$|E
5|$|P. l. fossilis, P. fossilis or P. spelaea fossilis, {{known as}} the Middle Pleistocene European cave lion, flourished about 500,000 years ago; fossils have been {{recovered}} from Germany and Italy. It was larger than today's African lions, reaching sizes comparable to the American cave lion <b>and</b> <b>slightly</b> larger than the Upper Pleistocene European cave lion.|$|E
5|$|P. p. erythropthalmus, {{described}} by Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1817 as Coracia erythrorhamphos, {{occurs in the}} red-billed chough's continental European range, excluding Greece. It is larger <b>and</b> <b>slightly</b> greener than the nominate race.|$|E

5|$|The {{bottom end}} {{of the body is}} an ampulla (a flask-like swelling), which anchors the animal in the tube and enables it to retract its body very quickly when threatened. When the lophophore is {{extended}} {{at the top of the}} body, cilia (little hairs) on the sides of the tentacles draw food particles to the mouth, which is inside <b>and</b> <b>slightly</b> to one side of the base of the lophophore. Unwanted material can be excluded by closing a lid above the mouth or be rejected by the tentacles, whose cilia can switch into reverse. The food then moves down to the stomach, which is in the ampulla. Solid wastes are moved up the intestine and out through the anus, which is outside <b>and</b> <b>slightly</b> below the lophophore.|$|E

5|$|The gastral {{segments}} {{have small}} constrictions {{between the first}} and second segments. The stinger is long but largely internalized, and it is also stout <b>and</b> <b>slightly</b> upcurved apically. The external parts are enclosed by the gonostyli, and the sting bulb is large. The integument (a protective outer layer) is rugose throughout except on the legs and gaster. The dorsofrontal area of the head (the back of an insect), and the dorsal surfaces of the gaster, mesosoma and petiole are covered by erect hairs, <b>and</b> <b>slightly</b> longer hairs are present on the ventral regions of the mesosoma and gaster. The apical segments of the gaster have a greater density of setose (bristles) with longer decumbent hairs (meaning that these hairs are lying down).|$|E

5|$|The synagogue {{occupied}} {{the greater part}} of the plot, facing west. It receded from the street regulation-line in accordance with the rule then still enforced in Austria–Hungary, prohibiting non-Catholic places of worship from having a public entrance from the street. The synagogue had a wider <b>and</b> <b>slightly</b> higher central nave and two narrower naves; unlike Förster's synagogue in Vienna, it did not have a basilical plan.|$|E
5|$|While {{individual}} dogs may vary, {{in general}} show-bred Labradors are heavier built, slightly shorter-bodied, {{and have a}} thicker coat and tail. Field Labradors are generally longer-legged, lighter, and more lithe in build, making them agile. In the head, show Labradors tend to have broader heads, better defined stops, and more powerful necks, while field Labradors have lighter <b>and</b> <b>slightly</b> narrower heads with longer muzzles.|$|E
