2500|$|Some {{authors have}} begun {{extending}} discussions of insect welfare beyond the laboratory to {{the domain of}} raising insects for food. A new Dutch <b>Animal</b> <b>Act</b> that went into effect on 1 January 2013 creates a regulatory framework for farm-animal welfare based on the five freedoms, and the law specifically lists a number of insect species as [...] "production animals" [...] whose wellbeing needs to be respected. Dutch politician Marianne Thieme asked {{a series of questions}} suggesting concern that insect farming would multiply the number of animals farmed and killed for human consumption. Robert Nathan Allen of the pro-entomophagy organization Little Herds feels that the welfare of insects is important, though he believes well managed farms can maintain high standards of care. Some entomophagy suppliers highlight the importance of humane insect treatment. For instance, World Ento uses the name [...] "Good Karma Killing" [...] to describe its process of freezing insects into a statis state. A 2013 FAO report on [...] "Edible insects" [...] includes a section encouraging high standards of welfare in entomophagy operations, despite uncertainty about whether insects can suffer.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why impute {{reason to}} an animal if its {{behaviour}} {{can be explained}} on the theory of instinct?" [...] Remember these words, for they will be referred to later. [...] "A goodly number of persons seem to have persuaded themselves that animals do reason." [...] "But instinct suffices for the animals [...] . they get along very well without reason." [...] "Darwin tried hard to convince himself that animals do at times reason in a rudimentary way; but Darwin was also a much greater naturalist than psychologist." [...] The preceding quotation is tantamount, on Mr. Burroughs's part, to a flat denial that animals reason even in a rudimentary way. And when Mr. Burrough denies that animals reason even in a rudimentary way, it is equivalent to affirming, {{in accord with the}} first quotation in this paragraph, that instinct will explain every <b>animal</b> <b>act</b> that might be confounded with reason by the unskilled or careless observer.|$|E

25|$|The Protection of <b>Animals</b> <b>Act</b> 1911 {{has since}} been largely {{superseded}} by the <b>Animal</b> Welfare <b>Act</b> 2006, which also superseded and consolidated more than 20 other pieces of legislation, including the Protection of <b>Animals</b> <b>Act</b> 1934 and the Abandonment of <b>Animals</b> <b>Act</b> 1960.

5000|$|Mr. Peepers {{was first}} {{introduced}} as an <b>animal</b> <b>act</b> brought out by John Barbary (played by Tom Hanks) on a parody of The Tonight Show (with Darrell Hammond as Jay Leno). In an episode in the 25th season, [...] "Papa Peepers" [...] (played by The Rock) was revealed to be Mr. Peepers's father.

[...] In India, animals are protected by the [...] "Prevention of Cruelty to <b>Animals</b> <b>Act,</b> 1960".|$|R
2500|$|Prior to ASPA, the use {{of animals}} in the UK was {{regulated}} by the Cruelty to <b>Animals</b> <b>Act</b> 1876, which enforced a licensing and inspection system for vivisection.

Some dolls perform a tarantella for the guests, followed by other dolls dressed as playing cards who dance a mazurka. Then two dolls come in and perform another routine involving a snob and a melon vendor. New customers arrive, a Russian family, and everyone welcomes them.

5000|$|Passed in 2001, the Illinois Humane Care for <b>Animal</b> <b>Act</b> was {{amended to}} include a {{definition}} a companion animal hoarder and mandated psychological counseling for animal hoarders who violate Section 3. A person convicted of violating section 3 of the Act (which requires the provision of food and water, adequate shelter and protection from the weather, veterinary care, and humane care and treatment) is guilty of a misdemeanor with a second or subsequent violation raising the offense to a Class 4 felony. One commentator, Victoria Hayes, JD, believed that although Illinois’ legal definition of a “companion animal hoarder” {{is a step in}} the direction, the definition does not provide any extra tools to a prosecutor. [...] Animal hoarding itself is not prohibited by the statute, she said, the prosecutor must still show a violation of Section 3 of the Humane Care for Animals Act. It is important to note that animal hoarding itself is not prohibited by the Illinois statute.|$|E

40|$|By {{referring}} to several wild animal acts presented in Australia in the 1890 s at the high-status circuses of Frank Fillis and the FitzGerald Brothers, this essay explores the complex cultural interactions {{that occurred in}} the relationship between these major circuses and their late-colonial public. The author matches the circus’s wild <b>animal</b> <b>act</b> to nation-building tropes and examines the narratives of identity, patriotism, allegiance, and power that were articulated through these popular and unusual performances...|$|E
40|$|Summary. All {{possible}} crosses {{were made}} between European wild pigs with either 36 or 37 chromosomes and domestic swine with 38. The 36 =x 6 cross produced only pigs with 36; the 36 =x 7 and 37 =x 8 crosses yielded the parent numbers in about {{equal numbers of}} pigs. All pigs resulting from the 36 =x 8 cross had 37, while crossing 37 =x 7 gave progeny with 36, 37 or 38 in about a 1 : 2 : 1 ratio. It is surmised that the three unpaired members in the 37 -chromosome <b>animal</b> <b>act</b> as a trivalent during meiosis with two telocentric chromosomes behaving as a unit. No firm evidence indicated reduced fertility {{in any of the}} animals nor were any physical changes evident which could be associated with different chromosome forms...|$|E

The Act introduced the new welfare offence. This means that animal owners have a positive duty of care, and outlaws neglecting {{to provide for their}} animals' basic needs, such as access to adequate nutrition and veterinary care.

50|$|Gerry Cottle’s Circus {{originally}} toured with {{a variety}} of animals including horses, zebras, elephants, lions, tigers, monkeys, and llamas. The 1980s saw an increase in public opinion against <b>animal</b> <b>acts.</b> Cottle sold his last elephant and in 1993 had a non-animal circus. In 2012 he said that he now reluctantly supports the ban on circus <b>animal</b> <b>acts,</b> which he says will improve the image of circuses in Britain.|$|R
