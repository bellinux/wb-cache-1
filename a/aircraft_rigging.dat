50|$|On 20 December 1917, the 50th {{transferred}} from Kelly Field and ordered for overseas duty. It {{moved to the}} Aviation Concentration Center, Camp Mills, Garden City, New York and arrived on 3 January 1918. Departed from the United States on transport #508 (RMS Carmania on 9 January, arriving Liverpool, England on 24 January. Once in England, the 50th was moved to RFC Harlaxton, Lincolnshire and began advance training prior to being sent to France. Instruction was received in <b>aircraft</b> <b>rigging</b> and engine repair, along with gunnery, radio, photography and aerial bombing.|$|E
50|$|Bentine {{was born}} in Watford, Hertfordshire, to a Peruvian father, Adam Bentin, and a British mother, Florence Dawkins, {{and grew up in}} Folkestone, Kent. He was educated at Eton College. With the help of speech trainer, Harry Burgess, he overcame a stammer and {{subsequently}} developed an interest in amateur theatricals, along with the Tomlinson family, including the young David Tomlinson. He spoke fluent Spanish and French. His father was an early aeronautical engineer for the Sopwith Aviation Company during and after World War I and invented a tensometer for setting the tension on <b>aircraft</b> <b>rigging</b> wires.|$|E
5000|$|The {{organizational}} structure included three main groups: Airplane Operations; Engineering, and Post Operations, which were, in turn, sub-divided into various Divisions and Sections. A parts Depot (Air Depot No. 4), was never developed as such, {{and was used}} basically for parts storage to support the internal operations of Orly Field. The Post Operations group was concerned with {{the administration of the}} facility, such as security, provost, fire marshal, quartermaster department, the post office (APO 702) and other miscellaneous offices. During 1918, construction was an ongoing process at Orly and the war ended before it was fully completed. [...] The Engineering Department was responsible for the various shops needed to repair aircraft. <b>Aircraft</b> <b>rigging,</b> installing aircraft engines, overhauling engines, sheet metal fabrication, electronics, carpentry, fuselage and wing repairs, rubber and tire vulcanizing and the like were performed by the unit.|$|E
5000|$|The Respect was {{designed}} {{to comply with the}} US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles rules as well as European regulations. It features a paraglider-style wing, single-place accommodation and a single [...] Solo 210 or [...] Hirth F33 engine, depending on the model in pusher configuration with a reduction drive and a 122 cm diameter two-bladed composite propeller. The fuel tank capacity is 10 L. The aircraft propeller cage can be folded into four parts and the <b>aircraft</b> <b>rigged</b> with low or high hang points.|$|R

5000|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Al's plans of {{attending}} the Colorado School of Mines were changed by an encounter with a Swallow biplane that flew over an area where he was working. Following the aircraft to the local airfield, Al noticed several mistakes in the <b>aircraft</b> <b>rigging</b> which he gladly offered to help fix. After rerigging the plane, which was flown by J. Don Alexander, he was offered {{a job at the}} Alexander Aircraft Company. [...] At the age of 19, Al took the job as an assistant to the chief engineer and draftsman at the Alexander Company in Denver. [...] His early years proved unfruitful with his assistance on an eventually failing design. Finally, Al got the chance to build the M-1, also known as the Long Wing Eaglerock, a plane of his own design. While the airplane had some success as a trainer, its success was not enough to keep him at the Alexander company. In 1926, after spending some time working for Montague, where he designed his M-2, Al started taking his first flying lessons. Eventually, after the financial demise of Montegue, Al returned to Alexander. [...] In 1928, he became the chief engineer at Alexander. [...] During the time as chief engineer, he was responsible for several advances in the field of aircraft design, primarily through design of the Bullet, which was a low-wing airplane with relatively high speeds and a patented retractable landing gear.|$|E
5000|$|Pokryshkin {{started the}} war flying the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-3 fighter, {{in which he}} scored almost twenty victories. The unit was given the honor [...] "16th Guards Fighter Regiment" [...] in March 1942. At this time or soon after, the unit {{received}} some Yak-1s, in which Pokryshkin also scored victories, but which are neither identified, nor illustrated, in any known way. In January 1943, his regiment converted to Lend-Lease Bell P-39 Airacobras. Soviet pilots liked this aircraft, and found it quite competitive with the Messerschmitt Bf-109 and superior to the Focke-Wulf FW-190 at the low air combat altitudes common on the Eastern Front. Pokryshkin enjoyed the 37 mm cannon's destructive firepower, {{as well as the}} two upper nose-mounted [...]50 caliber machine guns, synchronized to fire through the propellor (airscrew), in addition to the pair of [...]30 caliber machine guns mounted in each wing, outside the propeller arc and therefore unsynchronized. He claimed that the cannon's trigger, positioned {{at the top of the}} joystick, was impossible to push without moving the pilot's hand, which made the aircraft deviate from the gunsight, so finally he had his regiment's <b>aircraft</b> <b>rigged</b> so that a single button simultaneously fired cannon and machine guns. In his memoirs he describes many enemy aircraft immediately disintegrating upon being hit by a salvo. Pokryshkin and his regiment were repeatedly asked to convert to new Soviet fighters such as the La-5 and Yak-3. However, Pokryshkin found Yak-3's firepower insufficient, and personally disliked Yakovlev, so the squadron remained with the P-39's.|$|R

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of reducing interior noise caused by advanced turbo propellers by controlling the vibration of aircraft fuselages was investigated by performing experiments in an anechoic chamber with an <b>aircraft</b> model test <b>rig</b> and apparatus. It {{was found that}} active vibration control provides reasonable global attenuation of interior noise levels for the cases of resonant (at 576 Hz) and forced (at 708 Hz) system response. The controlling mechanism behind the effect is structural-acoustic coupling between the shell and the contained field, termed interface modal filtering...|$|R

50|$|In 1914 Wilton {{enlisted in}} the South African Army {{to serve in the}} South-West Africa Campaign. He was posted to an {{engineering}} unit, and was disappointed in that he never saw any combat. In 1915 he took a ship to England to enlist in the Royal Flying Corps. Serving as a sergeant, he applied for a commission as a pilot. His first application was rejected, but was successful on his second attempt in mid-1917. The first part of his training was in a classroom, at the No. 2 School of Military Aeronautics in Oxford, learning about <b>aircraft</b> engineering, <b>rigging,</b> armaments, aerial navigation and artillery spotting. He was commissioned from cadet to temporary second lieutenant (on probation) on 5 January 1918, and was then posted to RAF Catterick for flight training. After only two hours and forty minutes of dual instruction he was flying solo. He was then trained to use his machine guns, in bombing, and aerial photography.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to explore}} the {{analytical}} issues surrounding the graphical representation of causation in accident scenarios. Two types of graphical renderings, Petri Nets and Why-Because Graphs, are introduced and the {{different ways in which}} they denote accident causation are explored. The second part reports an experiment undertaken to explore whether graphical renderings of causality have any benefits over text, and if one of the two graphs is superior to the other. In so doing, this paper aims to draw out our visual understanding of graphical renderings and how these map from the original representation, the accident scenario, to the secondary representation. 1. Introduction Safety and the improvement of safety is an emotive issue in today's society. This is especially the case with respect to failures in safety critical systems such as <b>aircraft,</b> oil <b>rigs,</b> nuclear power plants and ambulance services.

2500|$|The Camel soon {{gained an}} unfortunate {{reputation}} with pilots. Some inexperienced pilots crashed on take-off when the {{full fuel load}} pushed the aircraft's centre of gravity beyond the rearmost safe limits. When in level flight, the Camel was markedly tail-heavy. Unlike the Sopwith Triplane, the Camel lacked a variable incidence tailplane, so that the pilot had to apply constant forward pressure on the control stick to maintain a level attitude at low altitude. The <b>aircraft</b> could be <b>rigged</b> so that at higher altitudes it could be flown [...] "hands off". A stall immediately resulted in a dangerous spin.|$|R

40|$|Fault {{diagnosis}} typically {{consists of}} fault detection, isolation and identification. Fault detection and isolation determine {{the presence of}} a fault in a system and the location of the fault. Fault identification then aims at determining the severity level of the fault. In a practical sense, a fault is a conditional interruption of the system ability to achieve a required function under specified operating condition; degradation is the deviation of one or more characteristic parameters of the component from acceptable conditions and is often a main cause for fault generation. A fault occurs when the degradation exceeds an allowable threshold. From the point a new aircraft takes off for the first time all of its components start to degrade, and yet in almost all studies it is presumed that we can identify a single fault in isolation, i. e. without considering multi-component degradation in the system. This paper proposes a probabilistic framework to identify a single fault in an aircraft fuel system with consideration of multi-component degradation. Based on the conditional probabilities of sensor readings for a specific fault, a Bayesian method is presented to integrate distributed sensory information and calculate the likelihood of all possible fault severity levels. The proposed framework is implemented on an experimental <b>aircraft</b> fuel <b>rig</b> which illustrates the applicability of the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|An {{adaptive}} controls {{method for}} instability suppression in {{gas turbine engine}} combustors has been developed and successfully tested with a realistic <b>aircraft</b> engine combustor <b>rig.</b> This testing {{was part of a}} program that demonstrated, for the first time, successful active combustor instability control in an aircraft gas turbine engine-like environment. The controls method is called Adaptive Sliding Phasor Averaged Control. Testing of the control method has been conducted in an experimental rig with different configurations designed to simulate combustors with instabilities of about 530 and 315 Hz. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in suppressing combustor instabilities. In addition, a dramatic improvement in suppression of the instability was achieved by focusing control on the second harmonic of the instability. This is believed to be due to a phenomena discovered and reported earlier, the so called Intra-Harmonic Coupling. These results may have implications for future research in combustor instability control...|$|R
40|$|Two {{differential}} mobility spectrometers (DMS 500) {{were used}} to measure particulate size distributions and particulate matter losses in the exhaust of a simulated gas turbine combustor test rig. The rig is a stable gas turbine combustor simulator providing particles of physicochemical properties analogous to real <b>aircraft</b> engines. The <b>rig</b> ran at three operating conditions, giving a range of organic to elemental carbon distributions, allowing different aerosol compositions to be formed for comparison and analysis of transport losses. Smoke number from a recognised filter stain method and gas analysis of the exhaust were also taken to prove representative engine conditions. The two instruments were separated by 10 m of heated stainless steel sample line {{and a range of}} transitional to turbulent flow rates from 19 L/min to 64 L/min were utilised for the comparative analysis. The aerosols showed measureable transport losses dependant on organic fraction, while flow rate showed substantial effects dependent on the flow state within the line. Comparisons made to the particle transport loss model from United Technologies Research Center show agreement in trend losses relative to size distribution of the particulate matter, but with losses being higher than predicted...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} much recent {{research}} on the control of complex sound fields in enclosed vibrating structures via active control techniques. Active Structural Acoustic Control (ASAC) has shown much promise for reducing interior cabin noise in aircraft by applying control forces directly to the fuselage structure. Optimal positioning of force actuators for ASAC presents a challenging problem however, because a detailed knowledge of the structural-acoustic coupling in the fuselage is required. This work {{is concerned with the}} development of a novel experimental technique for examining the forced harmonic vibrations of an aircraft fuselage and isolating the acoustically well-coupled motions that cause significant interior noise. The developed system identification technique is itself based upon an active control system, which is used to approximate the disturbance noise field in the cabin and apply an inverse excitation to the fuselage structure. The resulting shell vibrations are recorded and used to optimally locate piezoelectric (PZT) actuators on the fuselage for ASAC testing. Experiments for this project made use of a Cessna Citation III <b>aircraft</b> fuselage test <b>rig.</b> Tests were performed at three harmonic disturbance frequencies, including an acousti...|$|R
500|$|Sydney {{began her}} third patrol on 5 November, {{operating}} {{on the west coast}} of Korea and escorted by the Canadian destroyers , , and , and American destroyers [...] and [...] On the same day, the first RAN casualty of the war occurred, when a Sea Fury pilot failed to pull up from a strafing run and crashed. Despite foul weather, the carrier's aircraft continued to attack lines of supply and communication, and provide support to United Nations ships: the 1000th combat sortie was flown on 12 November, a day before the patrol's end. On 18 November, after replenishing in Sasebo, Sydney, Tobruk, and the British light cruiser [...] sailed to Hŭngnam, where they joined Task Force 95.8 to aid a USN bombardment of Hŭngnam during 20–22 November. On that day, Sydney was being refuelled by [...] when there was an accident that resulted in a large spill of fuel and damage to Wave Chiefs refuelling <b>rig.</b> <b>Aircraft</b> from Sydney performed strikes against coastal artillery batteries, barracks, industrial areas, and railway lines, and provided a combat air patrol for the ships. At the conclusion of the operation, Sydney returned to the west coast, but was unable to resume operations because of snow and high winds until 27 November, a day before being relieved.|$|R
40|$|An <b>aircraft</b> {{fatigue test}} <b>rig</b> {{consists}} {{of a number of}} vertically mounted hydraulic jacks which are connected to the underside of an aircraft and are used to apply to the aircraft a prescribed loading pattern. Each jack is fitted with a pressure-ratio valve which is used to amplify or attenuate the input pressure signal generated from a common source. Part 1 dealt with the derivation of the static characteristics and equations of motion for the system. Part 2 is concerned with the results of (1) analogue computer investigations using these equations of motion and (2) practical experiments carried out on a hydraulic test rig to verify and to complement the results of the com-putations. The value of simultaneously undertaking the computer and test-rig investigations is demonstrated. The valve, in its basic form, is shown to give rise to transient oscillations even when the load has negligible inertia. When inertia loads are introduced, there is a further tendency to oscillate because of the compressibility of the oil. Both oscillations may be damped by the use of valve-spool centring springs and valve-damping ori-fices. The frequency response characteristics of the system over the normal working frequency range are shown to be quite sensitive to changes in the stiffness coefficients of the centring springs and the orifice-damping co-efficients. Recommended values for these parameters are derived and the effects of varying other parameters are considered...|$|R
40|$|It is {{hypothesized}} that the spatial structure of a turbulent diffusion flame {{plays an important role}} in determining the emissions of radiative energy, soot and NO, from a combustor. This structure, manifested in the two point statistics, is influenced by buoyancy. Radiation, soot and NOx emissions are the cumulative result of processes that occur throughout a flame. For example, radiation fluxes along a line of sight can be found from summing up the contributions from sources in individual pockets of hot soot that emit, and from sinks in cold soot that absorb. Soot and NOx are both the results of slow chemistry and are not equilibrium products. The time that is available for production and burnout is crucial in determining the eventual emissions of these pollutants. Turbulence models generally rely on a single point closure of the appropriate time averaged equations. Hence, spatial information is lost and needs to be modeled using solution variables such as turbulence kinetic energy and dissipation rate, often with the assumption of isotropy. However, buoyancy can affect the physical structure of turbulent flames and can change the spatial extent of soot bearing regions. Theoretical comparisons with models are best done in the limit of infinite Froude number because the inclusion of buoyancy in flow models introduces significant uncertainties. Hence, LII measurements of soot, measurements of radiation fluxes from soot, Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) of the flow field and measurements of post flame NOX will be carried out on the NASA Lewis 2. 2 sec drop tower and eventually on the parabolic flight <b>aircraft.</b> The drop <b>rig</b> will be a modified version of a unit that has been successfully used at Lewis in the past...|$|R
