You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where I thought it was going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E

[...] Waddle personally directed the maneuvers. [...] According to Waddle, the DVs [...] "were loving it." [...] Waddle adds, [...] "I could barely suppress a smile <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> expressions of joy and amazement {{on the faces of}} our distinguished visitors." [...] During the maneuvers, several civilians in the sonar room conversed with the sonar technicians, who were at the same time trying to keep track of any sonar contacts in the vicinity.|$|E
2500|$|In October 1980, Julia Cave and a {{team from}} the BBC arrived in Abydos to film the {{documentary}} Omm Sety and Her Egypt. Featuring interviews with Egyptologists T. G. H. James and Rosalie David, it described Abydos and the excavations that had been undertaken. It had extensive input from Omm Sety, who used crutches due to her deteriorating health. The documentary was broadcast on BBC 2 in May 1981. The Times wrote of the documentary: [...] "An incredulous smile froze on my lips <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> Chronicle film Omm Sety and Her Egypt. Could I be absolutely positive {{it was all a}} lot of eyewash? Of course I couldn't. And neither will you be able to. In any case, it makes marvellous television." [...] At the time the BBC were recording their documentary, the American producer Miriam Birch asked Omm Sety to appear, along with Egyptologists Kent Weeks and Lanny Bell, in a documentary that National Geographic Channel was filming, Egypt: Quest for Eternity. It concentrated on Rameses II, the son of Seti I. Shooting took place in March 1981, coinciding with Omm Sety's seventy-seventh birthday party at Chicago House, which was filmed. She was {{in a lot of pain}} but full of good cheer, and the film crew carried her up to the Temple of Seti for filming. This was to be her last visit to the shrine in which she believed she had served as a priestess 3,000 years before.|$|E

60|$|This {{conviction}} that the world kingdom of God is the only true method of human service, is so clear and final in my own mind, it seems so inevitably the conviction to which all right-thinking men must ultimately come, that I feel almost like a looker-on at a game of blind-man's bluff <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> discussion of synthetic political ideas.

You live in the houses, and when wearied of this, walk across the road and drop into the sea, {{if you can find a}} square foot of {{unencumbered}} water. So vast is the accumulation of country shipping, and such is its dirtiness as it rubs against the bund, that the superior inhabitants are compelled to hang their boats from davits above the common craft, who are greatly disturbed by a multitude of steam-launches. These ply for amusement and the pleasure of whistling, and are held in such small esteem that every hotel owns one, and the others are masterless. Beyond the launches lie more steamers than the eye can count, and four out of five of these belong to Us. I was proud when I saw the shipping at Singapur, but I swell with patriotism <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>watch</b> <b>the</b> fleets of Hong-Kong from the balcony of the Victoria Hotel.

And it was as still and steady <b>as</b> dreaming. <b>I</b> <b>watched</b> <b>the</b> widening distance between our floats and the waves.
