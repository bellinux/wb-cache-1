5|$|On Sunday, February 25, 1917, Danebod Folk School {{burned to}} the grown. Fortunately, the fire burned slowly. The {{students}} and the quickly summoned neighbors had time to rescue much of the furniture and other items of high value. Nearby buildings were saved, but the Folk School was beyond rescue. In the fall of 1917, nine months after the disastrous fire, a new and larger Folk School was dedicated. Speakers at the dedicatory exercises were Pastor Knudsen, C.P. Højbjerg, Aage Møller, P.Rasmussen, and Kristian Østergaard. Meanwhile, a terrible epidemic of influenza swept the county, and all churches and schools were temporarily closed {{in an effort to}} halt the deadly disease; but many people died. Another catastrophe followed on August21, 1918, when a devastating tornado tore through Lincoln County. It was the fourth most deadly tornado in Minnesota history and took the lives of 36 people and injured <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>more.</b>|$|E
5|$|One {{young man}} kicked and smashed {{the window of}} a police car, lit a pack of matches, and set the {{upholstery}} on fire. After burning for a short time, the fuel tank exploded; <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>more</b> police cars and eight other automobiles would be destroyed in a similar fashion. The photo on the front cover of the Dead Kennedys 1980 album Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables, which shows several police cars on fire, was taken that night. Several crowd members threw tear gas, which they had stolen from police vehicles. Riots began to break out, with one mob disrupting traffic. Electric trollies were disabled when their overhead wires were pulled down, and violence broke out against the police officers, who were outnumbered. Police Chief Charles Gain, standing inside City Hall, ordered officers not to attack and to simply stand their ground.|$|E

5|$|García sent captain Pedro de Zubiaur, {{his senior}} officer, on towards the lake. He arrived at Lake Petén Itza with 60 musketeers, friar San Buenaventura and another Franciscan and allied Yucatec Maya warriors. They were also {{accompanied}} by about 40 Maya porters. On 2 February the expedition {{was approached by}} two Itza warriors who told them of a recent battle between a Guatemalan expedition and the Itza; these two Itzas guided the party to a nearby Itza settlement, and the letter from Avendaño was shown to captain Zubiaur, convincing {{him that he could}} advance safely. The port town of Ch'ich' was abandoned but a large number of canoes approached, judged to be as many as 300 by the Spanish captain, bearing perhaps 2,000 Itza warriors. The warriors began to mingle freely with the Spanish party and began to load the Spanish supplies into the canoes with a promise of transporting the expedition across to Nojpetén, with one soldier in each canoe. The Franciscans readily boarded the canoes, with two soldiers as an escort. A scuffle then broke out; <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>more</b> of the Spanish party were forced into canoes, and two porters were beaten to death. One of the captured Spanish soldiers was immediately decapitated. At this point the Spanish soldiers opened fire with their muskets, and the Itza retreated across the lake with their prisoners.|$|E

25|$|In 1812 he {{was sitting}} in his rooms in the Analytical Society looking at a table of logarithms, which he knew to be full of mistakes, when the idea {{occurred}} to him of computing all tabular functions by machinery. The French government had produced several tables by a new method. Three or four of their mathematicians decided how to compute the tables, half <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>more</b> broke down the operations into simple stages, and the work itself, which was restricted to addition and subtraction, was done by eighty computers who knew only these two arithmetical processes. Here, for the first time, mass production was applied to arithmetic, and Babbage was seized by the idea that the labours of the unskilled computers could be taken over completely by machinery which would be quicker and more reliable.|$|E
25|$|H. pomatia eggs measure about 3mm in {{diameter}} and have a calcareous shell and a high yolk content. H. pomatia lays the eggs in July or August, 2 to 8 weeks after mating, in holes dug out in the ground. (Data varies widely on how long after mating snails lay eggs.) The snail puts its head into the hole or may crawl in until only {{the top of the}} shell is visible; then it deposits eggs from the genital opening just behind the head. It takes the snail 1 to 2 days to lay 30 to 50 eggs. Occasionally, the snail will lay about <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>more</b> a few weeks later. The snail covers the hole with a mixture of the slime it excretes and dirt. This slime, which the snail excretes to help it crawl and to help preserve the moisture in its soft body, is glycoprotein similar to eggwhite.|$|E
25|$|At WrestleMania 21, Venis {{competed in}} a 30-man Interpromotional battle royal which was won by Booker T. In {{the summer of}} 2005 he formed another team, V-Squared, with Viscera.

On the December 5 episode of Raw, V-Squared participated in a fatal four way match for the World Tag Team Championship, including the champions Big Show and Kane, The Heart Throbs, and Snitsky and Tyson Tomko but were defeated. Venis and Viscera continued to team in 2006, getting another shot at Big Show and Kane's titles, while occasionally having solo matches. In March 2006, Venis suffered a kayfabe injury {{at the hands of the}} Spirit Squad which allowed him to take time off for legitimate elbow surgery, during which about <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>more</b> bone spurs were removed, six others were shaved down, and a nerve was transplanted.|$|E

25|$|The first, in the 20th century Russia, was the Kishinev pogrom of 1903 {{in which}} 47 Jews were killed, {{hundreds}} wounded, 700 homes destroyed and 600 businesses pillaged. In the same year, pogroms {{took place in}} Gomel (Belarus), Smela, Feodosiya and Melitopol (Ukraine). Extreme savagery was demonstrated with mutilations of the wounded. They were followed by the Zhitomir pogrom (with 29 killed), and the Kiev pogrom of October 1905 resulting in a massacre of approximately 100 Jews. In three years between 1903 and 1906, about 660 pogroms were recorded in Ukraine and in Bessarabia; half <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>more</b> in Belorussia, carried out with the Russian government's complicity. There were no anti-Jewish pogroms recorded in Poland. At about that time, the Jewish Labour Bund began organizing armed self-defence units ready to shoot, and the pogroms subsided {{for a number of}} years. According to professor Colin Tatz, between 1881 and 1920, there were 1,326 pogroms in Ukraine (see: Southwestern Krai parts of the Pale) which took the lives of 70,000 to 250,000 civilian Jews, leaving half a million homeless.|$|E
25|$|Smith {{would face}} the MCC once more that year, in August at Brighton, before waiting {{a whole year}} for his next {{first-class}} match. He played, again for Sussex, on 29 August 1842 against an England XI where he was dismissed by William Hillyer for ten. Smith's activities {{for the next two}} years are unrecorded, and he does not feature on a cricket scorecard until June 1844, where he played three matches against East sussex and the Gentlemen of Hampshire. He joined Henfield Cricket Club and featured for them against Brighton that year also. In May 1845 he played for Petworth Cricket Club against the MCC, followed by Hampshire and then the MCC once more - all first-class games. He played a Gentlemen v Players game in September 1845, an early County cricket matches in 1851 between Sussex and Kent, and faced the All England XI in 1852 followed by two more outings against Kent. He then played <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>more</b> games against various Gentlemen's XIs including his final match in 1866. He died in 1892 in Wantley.|$|E
25|$|New Mexico {{state health}} {{officials}} notified the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Within a week, {{a task force}} had formed in Albuquerque that included Bruce Tempest, chief {{of medicine at the}} Indian Medical Center. Tempest quickly discovered that five people, including the young man’s fiancée, as well as an Arizona resident, all had experienced the same symptoms and all had died within a six-month period. Tempest learned from the young man's family members that his fiancée had the same symptoms and died on the Navajo Reservation five days earlier. Deaths on the reservations are not reported to the state health department because they are sovereign nations. Tempest had considered plague as the cause because it is endemic to the region. But that had already been ruled out by tests on all the victims. Within a short time, <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> <b>more</b> people contracted the illness, most of them young Navajos in New Mexico. This included two relatives of the young couple who had died within a week of each other.|$|E
