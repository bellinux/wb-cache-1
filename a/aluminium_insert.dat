40|$|Al-enriched layer {{was formed}} on a {{magnesium}} substrate {{with use of}} casting. The magnesium melt was cast into a steel mould with an <b>aluminium</b> <b>insert</b> placed inside. Different conditions of the casting process were applied. The reaction between the molten magnesium and the aluminium piece during casting {{led to the formation}} of an Al-enriched surface layer on the magnesium substrate. The thickness of the layer was dependent on the casting conditions. In all fabricated layers the following phases were detected: a solid solution of Mg in Al, Al 3 Mg 2, Mg 17 Al 12 and a solid solution of Mg in Al. When the temperature of the melt and the mould was lower (variant 1 – 670 °C and 310 °; variant 2 – 680 °C and 310 °C, respectively) the unreacted thin layer of aluminium was observed in the outer zone. Applying higher temperatures of the melt (685 °C) and the mould (325 °C) resulted in deep penetration of aluminium into the magnesium substrate. Areas enriched in aluminium were locally observed. The Al-enriched layers composed mainly of Mg-Al intermetallic phases have hardness from 187 - 256 HV 0. 1...|$|E

Carbon fibre composite tubing is bonded with <b>aluminium</b> <b>inserts</b> to achieve a low mass and high stiffness alternative to conventional half-shaft design. The drive line system was validated using a number of techniques including; finite element analysis (FEA) and torsional tensile testing.

40|$|The {{influence}} of tube voltage (kV) and current (mA) on the resulting relationship of computed tomography number to electron density (CT-ED) was investigated for a wide-bore GE scanner. The {{influence of}} kV and mA scan settings {{were examined in}} combination with a 16 -bit image reconstruction algorithm made available via the scanner software and which allowed resolution of CT numbers for high density materials. By using titanium and stainless steel inserts in an electron density phantom, mA variation {{was found to have}} minimal impact on the CT-ED relationship, whereas variation in kV led to significant differences in CT number for the high density materials. The scanner is also equipped with automatic tubecurrent modulation capabilities. The influence of automatic tube-current modulation on CT number was investigated for a range of materials in a phantom geometry. It was found that tube current modulation has negligible effect on CT number, though the changing dimension of the phantom did influence CT number of an <b>aluminium</b> <b>insert</b> for scans undertaken with both fixed and modulated tube currents. In light of evidence from other studies examining the influence of CT number on dose calculation, it is recommended that scanner settings and specific CT-ED look-up tables be considered when calculations will be required with high-density materials present...|$|E

50|$|Soft touch {{materials}} were {{used throughout the}} passenger cabin, such as the dashboard, doors (arm rests), steering wheel, and shift levers. Subtle grained interior panels and bright metal work was used on the inside with high-quality materials also used on the outside, like chrome, aluminium, and polished stainless steel, particularly on top-of-the-line luxury Silverado or Sierra Classic trim levels. Custom Vinyl vinyl or soft Custom Cloth cloth and velour seating surfaces were used along with fabric headliners, door inserts, and plush carpeting, depending on the trim level. Upper class trim levels also used acoustic deadening materials for quieter ride comfort. From model years 1973 to 1977, chestnut wood grain inserts were used on the dashboard and doors for further visual enhancement. The wood grain inserts were replaced by bright brushed <b>aluminium</b> <b>inserts</b> for model years 1978 to 1987.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the preparation, thermo-hydraulic characterisation, and {{performance}} analysis of silica gel coated highly conductive surface enhancing structures {{to be used as}} tube inserts in a prototype of an innovative water-cooled sorption rotor. The candidate inserts under investigation comprise highly porous <b>aluminium</b> foam <b>inserts,</b> twisted-in wire brushes, and flocked structures, that are investigated for their flow impedance, heat transfer performance, and cyclic dehumidification performance. The conducted analysis comprises experimental testing of insert specific pressure drop and heat transfer performance in a purpose built test rig, that led to the preselection of the foam structures and a twisted-in <b>aluminium</b> wire brush <b>insert</b> for desiccant coating and further investigation. Cyclic heat and mass transfer tests were performed in a purpose-built small-scale test rig, that simulated the dehumidification process of a desiccant rotor with and without employing water-cooling. The experimental analysis is complemented by a numerical investigation of the cyclic heat and mass transfer performance of the brush and metal foam type structures, modelled as two-dimensionally axis-symmetric porous media. The geometry based functions of the insert specific flow characteristics are derived from two- and three-dimensional pore scale computational fluid dynamics models, that are calibrated against experimental data. The validity of fundamental modelling assumptions was confirmed by a decent agreement between numerical and experimental steady-state heat transfer results. The heat and mass transfer investigation showed that the investigated structures were capable of eﬀectively removing heat during the dehumidification half-cycle. The thermal mass was shown to be a critical design parameter in achieving acceptable dehumidification performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of Caco- 2 monolayers were compared on aluminium oxide and nitrocellulose permeable-supports. On nitrocellulose, Caco- 2 cells displayed {{a higher rate}} of taurocholic acid transport than those cultured on <b>aluminium</b> oxide <b>inserts.</b> In addition, Caco- 2 cells grown on these two inserts were not comparable with respect to cell morphology, cell numbers and transepithelial electrical resistance. The low adsorption potential of the <b>aluminium</b> oxide <b>inserts,</b> particularly for high molecular weight or lipophilic ligands, offers a distinct advantage over nitrocellulose inserts for drug transport studies. The carrier-mediated uptake and transport of the imino acid (L-proline) and the acidic amino acids (L-aspartate and L-glutamate) have been studied. At pH 7. 4, L-proline uptake is mediated via an A-system carrier. Elevated uptake and transport under acidic conditions occurs by activation of a distinct carrier population. Acidic amino acid transport is mediated via a X-AG system. The flux of baclofen, CGP 40116 andCGP 40117 across Caco- 2 monolayers was described by passive transport. The transport of three peptides, thyrotrophin-releasing hormone, SQ 29852 and cyclosporin were investigated. Thyrotrophin-releasing hormone transport acrossCaco- 2 monolayers was characterised by a minor saturable (carrier-mediated,approximately 25 %) pathway, superimposed onto a major non-saturable (diffusional) pathway. SQ 29852 uptake into Caco- 2 monolayers is described by a major saturable mechanism (Km = 0. 91 mM) superimposed onto a minor passive component. However, the initial-rate of SQ 29852 transport is consistent with a passive transepithelial transport mechanism. These data highlight the possibility that itsbasolateral efflux is severely retarded such that the passive paracellular transportdictates the overall transepithelial transport characteristics. In addition, modelsuitable for investigating the transepithelial transport of cyclosporin A has been developed. A modification of the conventional Caco- 2 model has been developed which has a calcium-free Ap donor-solution and a Bl receiver-solution containing the minimumcalcium concentration required to maintain monolayer integrity (100 μM). The influence of calcium and magnesium on the absorption of [14 C]pamidronate was evaluated by comparing its transport across the conventional and minimum calciumCaco- 2 models. Ap calcium and magnesium ions retard the Ap-to-Bl flux of pamidronate across Caco- 2 monolayers. The effect of self-emulsifying oleic acid-Tween 80 formulations on Caco- 2 monolayer integrity has been investigated. Oleic acid-Tween 80 (1 0 : 1) formulations produced a dose-dependent disruption of Caco- 2 monolayer integrity. This disruption was related to the oleic acid content of the formulation...|$|R
40|$|V diplomski nalogi sem raziskoval in ugotavljal potek razvijanja nove prikolice prestižnega razreda Alpine. Cilj projekta je bil zahtevnemu trgu predstaviti in v uporabo ponuditi prikolico, ki bo na potovanjih in oddihih ponujala vso dostopnost in razkošje doma. Da bi se kar se da približali temu, je bila ekipa, zadolžena za razvoj (razvojniki, tehnologi, nabavniki in prodajniki), pred številnimi izzivi, ki so ovirali razvoj. Iskali smo možnosti za izboljšavo stare serije modela Alpine ter uvajali nove elemente in karoserijske materiale ob upoštevanju dizajna izdelka. Sodobni končni kupci so vse bolj zahtevni in pričakujejo vse več dodatne opreme, zato je bila poseben izziv majhna dovoljena skupna teža. Naloga je bila vse prej kot preprosta, a na koncu smo zadostili vsem potrebam in tudi predpisom. Pri vgrajevanju novih sestavin smo naleteli na številne ovire. Vseh želja in smernic, začrtanih na začetku, ni bilo moč izpolniti. Ključno vlogo pri trdnosti karoserije so prevzeli elementi, s katerimi smo zamenjali zdaj vgrajeni smrekov les. Pri načrtovanju razvoja smo upoštevali dejavnike krčenja gozda, zato smo les nadomestili s poliuretanom in aluminijastimi vložki. S tem se je spremenila tudi sestava oz. montaža karoserije v celoto. Poiskati je bilo treba nova orodja in elemente za sestavo. Zamenjali smo lepila, vijake, materiale, ki zagotavljajo tesnjenje, ter način izdelave. In {{the thesis}} I {{researched}} and established course of {{development for the}} new luxury class caravans, Alpine. The aim {{of the project was}} to present to the contemporary demanding market a trailer, which can offer the all-embracing accessibility and luxury of the home to the modern traveller. In order to make this possible, the development team (developers, technologists, purchasers and salespeople) got exposed to a number of challenges, which were impeding the progress. We were looking for alternatives to improve the old model Alpine, {{and at the same time}} we have introduced new elements, as well as new bodywork material, with the focus on the product design. Since the demands the modern consumers are increasing, and they request more accessories, we were faced with the shortage of the total available weight. The problems were anything but simple, but we managed to fulfil all the needs and requirements. When installing new component materials we have encountered certain resistance and obstacles. In the beginning, the guidelines and desires were set, of which not all could be accepted and carried out. A key role in the strength of the body has taken elements that have replaced the currently installed spruce. When planning the progress we took into account deforestation factors, so we replaced the wood with polyurethane and <b>aluminium</b> <b>inserts,</b> thus also changing the composition and assembling of the body into a whole unit. It was necessary to find new tools and composition elements. We replaced the adhesive, screws, materials that provide sealing and the method of manufacture itself...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} project {{is to improve the}} thermal performance of passive flat plate solar collectors using a novel cost effective enhanced heat transfer technique. The project work focuses on the process of energy conversion from the collector to the working fluid. This is accomplished by employing an aluminium grid placed in the channels of a collector to induce a gradient of heat capacitance. This novel technique is tested both theoretically by means of simplistic designs using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and experimentally using two unglazed collectors. One collector has the <b>aluminium</b> net <b>inserted</b> in its channels and it is tested against an identical conventional collector {{in order to have a}} direct comparison at the same time. The obtained CFD data and the experimental findings are coupled and show a good agreement. All the obtained results are validated with the literature. The results both theoretical and experimental demonstrate an enhancement in the heat transfer coefficient by 9 % resulting to an increase in the output temperature of the working fluid in the collector with the metallic insertion. Other parameters such as the Nusselt and Raleigh numbers supported these findings. Three novel expressions that correlate the Nusselt and the Rayleigh number, for different heat fluxes, were developed using data from CFD and experimental results. These correlations can be applied on any flat plate collector with an aluminium grid in its pipes, in order to predict its performance. Furthermore an existing lumped parameters model that predicts the output temperature of a collector was simplified and improved. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The spatial {{distribution}} of the polarization in polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) films was measured at room temperature with the PPS (piezoelectric pressure step) method. In order to investigate the time development under external fields, a thin insulation polyethylene terephthalate (PET) film covering an evaporated <b>aluminium</b> electrode was <b>inserted</b> between the sample and the measuring electrode. The observed development of inhomogeneous and internal polarization zones is attributed to charge injection and charge trapping at the polarization zone boundaries. The polarization zone develops at a position where the critical field strength for dipole orientation in the crystallites is exceeded by the approach of injected homocharges (or without injection by the depletion of internal homocharges and the excess of heterocharges). The critical field for &# 945;-crystallites corresponds to an electric field phase transition at 1. 2 MV/cm. The development of central polarization zones in PVDF containing &# 946;-crystallites indicates injection of charges with both signs and almost equal mobility.

5000|$|Built {{around an}} all-new tubular space frame, the Disco Volante used {{lightened}} components from the Alfa Romeo 1900. As on the 1900, {{the engine was}} a inline-four with double chain-driven overhead camshafts, but used an <b>aluminium</b> block and <b>inserted</b> sleeves instead of the 1900's cast iron one. While the 1900's 88 mm stroke was retained, cylinder bore had grown from 82.55 mm to 85 mm, bringing total displacement to 1,997.4 cubic centimetres; compression ratio was raised to 8.73:1. So configured, fed by two twin-choke sidedraught carburettors, the engine produced [...] at 6,500 rpm. The transmission was 4-speed gearbox with synchronised forwards speeds and a multi plate dry clutch. Suspension was, as on other Alfa Romeos of the time, by double wishbones at the front and solid axle linked to the chassis by an upper triangle and two lower longitudinal reaction arms.

40|$|Joining {{processes}} or {{connecting elements}} of structural components are generally used for {{integration into the}} automotive body structure. Joining operations cause a locally increased tension profile due to local punctual loads. Thus, a continous and homogenous load path of components to be joines is preferred. Therefore, glass fibre fabrics were imbedded in aluminium-polyamide 6 components by various moulding processes. Along the process chain of aluminium casting and injection moulding, integral endless fibre- reinforced aluminium-polyamide- 6 vcomposites were manufactured. Tensile tests of Al-PA 6 Test specimens with glass fibres were performed. For the aluminium casting process, {{low pressure die casting}} (LPDC) was used. The aluminium melt is moved, against gravity by pressurized nitrogen inducing high quality casting with low porosity, depressions and szhrinkage defects. The grip at the aluminium fibre interface results from microscopic undercuts between metal and fibre. In a second process step, glass fibres and <b>aluminium</b> parts were <b>inserted</b> into the injection moulding machine in which the glass fibres were infiltraded with PA 6. Present investigations address non-destructive testing by microcomputer tomography (yCT) to investigate the infiltration of the glass fibres.
