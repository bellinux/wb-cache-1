Subjects performed 20 -breath MBNW at tidal volumes of approximately 700 ml and 12 -breath MBNW at tidal volumes of approximately 1, 250 ml. Six indexes of ventilatory inhomogeneity were derived from data from (1) distribution of specific ventilation (SV) from mixed-expired and (2) end-tidal N 2, (3) change of slope of N 2 washout (semilog plot) with time, (4) change of slope of normalized phase III of successive breaths, (5) <b>anatomic</b> lead <b>dead</b> <b>space,</b> and (6) Bohr <b>dead</b> <b>space.</b> Significant ventilatory inhomogeneity {{was seen in the}} standing position at normal gravity (1 G). When we compared standing 1 G with microgravity, the distributions of SV became slightly narrower, but the difference was not significant. Also, there were no significant changes in the change of slope of the N 2 washout, change of normalized phase III slopes, or the <b>anatomic</b> and Bohr <b>dead</b> <b>spaces.</b> By contrast, transition from the standing to supine position in 1 G resulted in significantly broader distributions of SV and significantly greater changes in the changes in slope of the N 2 washouts, indicating more ventilatory inhomogeneity in that posture. Thus these techniques can detect relatively small changes in ventilatory inhomogeneity. We conclude that the primary determinants of ventilatory inhomogeneity during tidal breathing in the upright posture are not gravitational in origin...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Anatomic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> (also called airway or {{tracheal}} dead space) is {{the part}} of the tidal volume that does not participate in gas exchange. Some contemporary ventilation protocols, such as the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Network protocol, call for smaller tidal volumes than were traditionally delivered. With smaller tidal volumes, the percentage of each delivered breath that is wasted in the <b>anatomic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> is greater than it is with larger tidal volumes. Many respiratory and medical textbooks state that <b>anatomic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> can be estimated from the patient’s weight by assuming there is approximately 1 mL of dead space for every pound of body weight. With a volumetric capnography monitor that measures on-airway flow and CO 2, the <b>anatomic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> can be automatically and directly measured with the Fowler method, in which dead space equals the exhaled volume up to the point when CO 2 rises above a threshold. METH-ODS: We analyzed data from 58 patients (43 male, 15 female) to assess the accuracy of 5 <b>anatomic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> estimation methods. <b>Anatomic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> was measured during the first 10 min of monitoring and compared to the estimates. RESULTS: The coefficient of determination (r 2) be-tween the <b>anatomic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> estimate based on body weight and the measured <b>anatomic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> was r 2 0. 0002. The mean SD error between the body weight estimate and the measured dead space was 60 54 mL. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that the <b>anatomic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> estimate methods were sufficient when used (as originally intended) together with other assumptions to identify a starting point in a ventilation algorithm, but the poor agreement between an individual patient’s measured and estimated <b>anatomic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> contradicts the assumption that dead space can be predicted from actual or ideal weight alone.

Therefore, the aim {{of the study was to}} investigate these effects. METHODS: 37 healthy subjects (44 +/- 14 years) and 27 patients with lung cancer (60 +/- 10 years) participated in the study. After deep inhalation through a volatile organic compound filter, subjects exhaled at two different flow rates (50 ml/sec and 75 ml/sec) into Teflon-coated bags. The effect of breath hold was analysed after 10 seconds of deep inhalation. We also studied the effect of <b>anatomic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> by excluding this fraction and comparing alveolar air to mixed (alveolar + <b>anatomic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space)</b> air samples. Exhaled air samples were processed with Cyranose 320 electronic nose. RESULTS: Expiratory flow rate, breath hold and the inclusion of <b>anatomic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> significantly altered "breathprints" in healthy individuals (p 0. 05). These factors also influenced the discrimination ability of the electronic nose to detect lung cancer significantly. CONCLUSIONS: We have shown that expiratory flow, breath hold and dead space influence exhaled volatile compound pattern assessed with electronic nose. These findings suggest critical methodological recommendations to standardise sample collections for electronic nose measurements...|$|E
40|$|The {{volumes of}} the dead space (anatomic and alveolar) play an {{important}} role in the physiology of external respiration and information on these volumes makes the diagnosis of different respiratory disorders easier. The volume of the <b>anatomic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> (the last inspiratory portions) is uninvolved in the mixing with the gas of functional residual capacity (FRC) and leaves the airways unchanged in the gas composition on expiration. Mixing of the other portion of the tidal volume with FRC gas should be regarded as preparation for an alveolar gas exchange process. The increased partial value of the <b>anatomic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> in the tidal volume with its decrease (tachypnea) and, accordingly, reduced alveolar ventilation volume may result in ventilation respiratory failure. The time course of changes in the volume of the alveolar dead space is easily detectable from the decrease in expiratory CO 2 concentrations as compared with PaCO 2. The increased alveolar dead space volume suggests impaired local blood flow (thromboembolism, acute respiratory distress syndrome) in the lesser circulation and gives grounds to diagnose shunting and venous mixing.

Status asthmaticus (SA) is a severe, acute exacerbation of asthma that is refractory to traditional therapies using standard bronchodilators such as β-agonists and corticosteroids. Inhaled volatile anesthetics are currently used as a rescue therapy for SA due to their potent bronchodilator effects. However, it is unclear whether these agents act in vivo via 1) direct action on airway smooth muscle (ASM); 2) systemic re-circulation; or 3) autonomic reflexes from the central nervous system. Treatment with these agents can also lead to negative side effects, notably hypotension and arrhythmias, especially during prolonged pediatric use. The goals of this thesis were to compare direct versus systemic effects of these inhaled anesthetic agents, and to determine whether sufficient bronchodilation can be achieved via direct diffusion from the airway lumen to the ASM. We designed and developed a computer-actuated, ventilator-valve system to control the serial composition of the inspired gas. Using this system, we delivered inhaled anesthetic agents either a) to the <b>anatomic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> selectively (direct), or b) continuously throughout inspiration (systemic) in three mongrel canines (20 - 25 kg) with methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction. Measurements of lung resistance (RL), elastance (EL), and <b>anatomic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space</b> (VD) demonstrated that isoflurane and sevoflurane result in bronchodilation for both delivery regimes. This suggests that the mechanism of action for these agents is at least partly via direct effects. Fluctuations in VD were not directly coupled with those for RL or EL. Furthermore, there may exist a limit to maximal bronchodilation using inhaled anesthetics, with isoflurane being more potent. In summary, this study illustrates the feasibility of using a targeted anesthetic delivery to treat severe, acute bronchoconstriction. Such a delivery system has the potential to define a rapidly translatable treatment paradigm for SA while increasing patient safety. 2031 - 01 - 0...|$|E

40|$|It has {{recently}} been shown that strategies aimed at preventing ventilator-induced lung injury, such as ventilating with low tidal volumes, can reduce mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). High-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) seems ideally suited as a lung-protective strategy for these patients. HFOV provides both active inspiration and expiration at frequencies generally between 3 and 10 Hz in adults. The amount of gas that enters and exits the lung with each oscillation is frequently below the <b>anatomic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space.</b> Despite this, gas exchange occurs and potential adverse effects of conventional ventilation, such as overdistension and the repetitive opening and closing of collapsed lung units, are arguably mitigated.

A recent multicenter, randomized, controlled trial has shown that HFOV, when used early in ARDS, is at least equivalent to conventional ventilation and may have beneficial effects on mortality.

[...] Injection of barium sulfate microemboli {{into the right}} side of the heart of paralyzed, artificially ventilated cats increased pulmonary resistance, decreased pulmonary compliance and functional residual capacity, and increased end-expiratory transpulmonary pressure and <b>anatomic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space.</b> These effects could be due to constriction of terminal respiratory units without significant narrowing of the large airways, which may actually enlarge. Anatomic studies, performed after rapid freezing of the lungs in the open thorax, showed that the principal site of constriction was the alveolar ducts. Intra-venous isoproterenol partially or completely prevented the changes following microembolism, suggesting that they were due to smooth muscle contraction. Vagotomy, injection of heparin or atropine or guanethedine, or inhalation of 6 % carbon dioxide did not prevent the changes; prior injections of 48 / 80 decreased the changes. These studies suggest that the embolism-induced changes depend on histamine release. The varied manifestations of barium sulfate microembolism, including the shift of ventilation to the unaffected areas, atelectasis of embolized areas, anoxemia, and abnormal breathing pattern may depend on the presence and extent of contraction of peripheral respiratory units induced by libera-tion of histamine. terminal airway constriction histamine release lung compliance pulmonary resistance airway anatomy alveolar duct muscl...|$|E

Volumetric capnography simultaneously measures expired CO 2 and tidal volume and allows identification of CO 2 from 3 sequential lung compartments: apparatus and <b>anatomic</b> <b>dead</b> <b>space,</b> from progressive emptying of alveoli and alveolar gas. Lung heterogeneity creates regional differences in CO 2 concentration and sequential emptying contributes {{to the rise of}} the alveolar plateau and to the steeper the expired CO 2 slope. The concept of dead space accounts for those lung areas that are ventilated but not perfused. In patients with sudden pulmonary vascular occlusion due to pulmonary embolism, the resultant high V/Q mismatch produces an increase in alveolar dead space. Calculations derived from volumetric capnography are useful to suspect pulmonary embolism at the bedside. Alveolar dead space is large in acute lung injury and when the effect of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) is to recruit collapsed lung units resulting in an improvement of oxygenation, alveolar dead space may decrease, whereas PEEP-induced overdistension tends to increase alveolar dead space. Finally, measurement of physiologic dead space and alveolar ejection volume at admission or the trend during the first 48 hours of mechanical ventilation might provide useful information on outcome of critically ill patients with acute lung injury or acute respiratory distress syndrome...|$|E
