40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the inflammatory response of potentially infected wounds treated with isotonic saline solution, chlorhexidine and PVP-I, seven days after surgery. METHODS: Thirty-two male rats were used, divided into 4 groups. All <b>animals</b> <b>had</b> their surgical wounds infected {{with a standard}} bacterial inoculum. Control group (A) : <b>animals</b> <b>had</b> their surgical wounds sutured without any kind of cleaning. Saline solution group (B) : <b>animals</b> <b>had</b> their wounds cleaned with saline solution. Chlorhexidine group (C) : <b>animals</b> <b>had</b> their wounds cleaned with chlorhexidine. PVP-I group (D) : <b>animals</b> <b>had</b> their wounds cleaned with PVP-I. Seven days after surgery, all the <b>animals</b> <b>had</b> their skin submitted to microscopic and macroscopic evaluation. RESULTS: Edema was found on all histological slices analyzed, as well as vascular proliferation and congestion. Groups A and D showed presence of mild neutrophilic infiltrate, and moderate lymphocytic and macrophage infiltrate. Group B showed severe neutrophilic, macrophage, and lymphocytic infiltrate. Group C showed moderate neutrophilic, macrophage, and lymphocytic infiltrate. CONCLUSION: Group D was the group which showed inflammatory infiltrate most similar to the group that was not submitted to treatment...|$|R

5|$|Balaenids are {{the right}} whales. These <b>animals</b> <b>have</b> very large heads, which can make {{up as much as}} 40% of their body mass, and much of the head is the mouth. This allows them to take in large amounts of water into their mouths, letting them feed more effectively.|$|E
5|$|Ethicist Tom Regan {{rejected}} Kant's {{assessment of}} the moral worth of animals on three main points: First, he rejected Kant's claim that animals are not self-conscious. He then challenged Kant's claim that <b>animals</b> <b>have</b> no intrinsic moral worth because they cannot make a moral judgment. Regan argued that, if a being's moral worth is determined by its ability to make a moral judgment, then we must regard humans who are incapable of moral thought as being equally undue moral consideration. Regan finally argued that Kant's assertion that animals exist merely {{as a means to}} an end is unsupported; the fact that <b>animals</b> <b>have</b> a life that can go well or badly suggests that, like humans, they have their own ends.|$|E

5|$|Four orthopoxviruses cause {{infection}} in humans: variola, vaccinia, cowpox, and monkeypox. Variola virus infects only humans in nature, although primates and other <b>animals</b> <b>have</b> been infected {{in a laboratory}} setting. Vaccinia, cowpox, and monkeypox viruses can infect both humans and other animals in nature.|$|E
5|$|Other animals, {{including}} {{whales and}} elephants have larger brains than humans. However, when the brain-to-body mass ratio is taken into account, {{the human brain}} is almost {{twice as large as}} that of a bottlenose dolphin, and three times as large as that of a chimpanzee. However, a high ratio does not of itself demonstrate intelligence: very small <b>animals</b> <b>have</b> high ratios and the treeshrew has the largest quotient of any mammal.|$|E
5|$|The Horse Project has an {{official}} website, which encourages participation, and offers instructions for tethering. The project accepts donations and volunteer support. Participants considered selling kits for consumers interested in tethering horses. One Portland resident has reportedly installed more than 150 horses.

5|$|A {{wide variety}} of flora grow in the Cluj-Napoca Botanical Garden; some <b>animals</b> <b>have</b> also found refuge there. The city {{has a number of}} other parks, of which the largest is the Central Park. This park was founded during the 19th century and {{includes}} an artificial lake with an island, as well as the largest casino in the city, Chios. Other notable parks in the city are the Iuliu Hațieganu Park of the Babeș-Bolyai University, which features some sport facilities, the Hașdeu Park, within the eponymous student housing district, the high-elevation Cetățuia, and the Opera Park, behind the building of the Cluj-Napoca Romanian Opera.|$|E
5|$|Arias-Maldonado {{argues that}} {{traditional}} {{appeals to the}} value of nonhuman <b>animals</b> <b>have</b> failed to be sufficiently motivating, and that, instead, human/nonhuman relationships are appropriately grounded upon the ideas of human exceptionalism and human domination. These notions, he claims, can be the basis of political transformation for nonhuman animals. He argues that once these ideas are properly understood, they can ground an idea of human sympathy for nonhuman animals, which is just one part of a caring and sustainable Anthropocene. Even if an alternative politics might ultimately be preferable, Arias-Maldonado argues, a change to a focus on sympathy might be useful and realistic as a political strategy.|$|E

5|$|Because Kant viewed {{rationality}} as {{the basis}} for being a moral patient—one due moral consideration—he believed that <b>animals</b> <b>have</b> no moral rights. Animals, according to Kant, are not rational, thus one cannot behave immorally towards them. Although he did not believe we have any duties towards animals, Kant did believe being cruel to them was wrong because our behaviour might influence our attitudes toward human beings: if we become accustomed to harming animals, then we are more likely to see harming humans as acceptable.|$|E
5|$|California {{sea lions}} {{are used in}} {{military}} applications by the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program, including detecting naval mines and enemy divers. In the Persian Gulf, the <b>animals</b> <b>have</b> been trained to swim behind divers approaching a U.S. naval ship and attach a clamp with a rope to the diver's leg. Navy officials say that the sea lions can do this in seconds, before the enemy realizes what happened. Organizations like PETA believe that such operations put the animals in danger. The Navy insists that the sea lions are removed once their mission is complete.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of a {{range of}} <b>animals</b> <b>have</b> been found {{including}} the Pleistocene lion (Felis leo spelæ), Cave hyena (Crocuta crocuta spelaea) and Badger (Meles meles). Wookey Hole was occupied by humans in the Iron Age, possibly around 250-300 BC, while nearby Hyena Cave was occupied by Stone Age hunters. Badger Hole and Rhinoceros Hole are two dry caves on the slopes above the Wookey ravine near the Wookey Hole resurgence and contain in situ cave sediments laid down during the Ice Age. Just outside the cave the foundations of a 1st-century hut have been identified. These had been built on during the Roman era up {{to the end of the}} 4th century.|$|E

5|$|Genetic {{modification}} of animals to study disease. Transgenic <b>animals</b> <b>have</b> specific genes inserted, modified or removed, to mimic specific {{conditions such as}} single gene disorders, such as Huntington's disease. Other models mimic complex, multifactorial diseases with genetic components, such as diabetes, or even transgenic mice that carry the same mutations that occur during the development of cancer. These models allow investigations on {{how and why the}} disease develops, as well as providing ways to develop and test new treatments. The vast majority of these transgenic models of human disease are lines of mice, the mammalian species in which genetic modification is most efficient. Smaller numbers of other animals are also used, including rats, pigs, sheep, fish, birds, and amphibians.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas with}} {{wet and dry}} seasons, soil {{nutrients}} diminish and erosion increases during the wet season. <b>Animals</b> <b>have</b> adaptation and survival strategies for the wetter regime. The previous dry season leads to food shortages into the wet season, as the crops have yet to mature. Developing countries have noted that their populations show seasonal weight fluctuations due to food shortages seen before the first harvest, which occurs late in the wet season. Rain may be harvested {{through the use of}} rainwater tanks; treated to potable use or for non-potable use indoors or for irrigation. Excessive rain during short periods of time can cause flash floods.|$|E
5|$|Like sponges and cnidarians, ctenophores {{have two}} main layers of cells that {{sandwich}} a middle layer of jelly-like material, {{which is called}} the mesoglea in cnidarians and ctenophores; more complex <b>animals</b> <b>have</b> three main cell layers and no intermediate jelly-like layer. Hence ctenophores and cnidarians have traditionally been labelled diploblastic, along with sponges. Both ctenophores and cnidarians have a type of muscle that, in more complex animals, arises from the middle cell layer, {{and as a result}} some recent text books classify ctenophores as triploblastic, while others still regard them as diploblastic.|$|E
