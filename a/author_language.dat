For example, TUTOR has powerful answer-parsing and answer-judging commands, graphics, and features to simplify handling student records and statistics by instructors. TUTOR's flexibility, in combination with PLATO's computational power (running on what was considered a supercomputer in 1972), also made it suitable {{for the creation of}} many non-educational lessons—that is, games—including flight simulators, war games, dungeon style multiplayer role-playing games, card games, word games, and medical lesson games such as Bugs and Drugs (BND).|$|E

40|$|The use of {{computers}} for teaching in Chemistry has attracted widespread interest since computers became relatively common. However, despite considerable effort, no clear direction for their use as teaching tools has emerged. The advent of the microcomputer has recently brought the computer within the reach of all Chemists, and {{has resulted in a}} corresponding increase in the amount of software offered as teaching material. However, the apparent lack of direction available for new authors of software threatens both the credibility and effectiveness of the microcomputer in teaching. There was therefore a need firstly to investigate and secondly to evaluate techniques and strategies for the use of microcomputers in Chemistry. To perform such an investigation, a stand-alone teaching package based on a microcomputer was constructed, with NMR chosen as its subject. The first part of the package was the inclusion of programs to present the background theory of NMR. Allowing students the opportunity to experiment and practise with newly-learnt skills was the next stage of the development. Exercises allowed students to analyse and to generate 1 H NMR spectra. Further exercises were needed to engage students in limited dialogue to further develop understanding. Analysis of the needs for the inclusion of such exercises indicated that an <b>Author</b> <b>language</b> would be useful. After consideration of the available software, a limited <b>Author</b> <b>language</b> was written. A variety of exercises were included in the package using this language. Evaluation of the package indicated that those students willing to use it did indeed derive considerable benefit from it. Analysis of student attitudes towards the package supported the view that it was successful. These attitudes also revealed a large potential for the use of similar packages in Chemistry. An effective package was created, with its elements using a variety of styles of presentation to students. The strengths and advantages of each style were noted {{in the construction of the}} package, and are embodied in the teaching package. A number of useful software tools were also created. Important guidelines for the formal inclusion of CAL as a style of teaching in Chemistry were developed...|$|E
40|$|Bibliographic {{documents}} are basically associated with many entities including authors, venues, affiliations, etc. While bibliographic search engines addressed mainly relevant doc-ument ranking {{according to a}} query topic, ranking other re-lated relevant bibliographic entities is still challenging. In-deed, document relevance is the primary level that allows inferring {{the relevance of the}} other entities regardless of the query topic. In this paper, we propose a novel inte-grated ranking model, called BibRank, that aims at rank-ing both document and author entities in bibliographic net-works. The underlying algorithm propagates entity scores through the network by means of citation and authorship links. Moreover, we propose to weight these relationships using content-based indicators that estimate the topical re-latedness between entities. In particular, we estimate the common similarity between homogeneous entities by ana-lyzing marginal citations. We also compare document and <b>author</b> <b>language</b> models in order to evaluate the level of author’s knowledge on the document topic and the docu-ment representativeness of author’s knowledge. Experiment results on the representative CiteSeerX dataset show that BibRank model outperforms baseline ranking models with a significant improvement...|$|E

40|$|The way {{we speak}} can reveal {{much about what}} we intend to communicate, but the words we use often only {{indirectly}} relate to the meanings we wish to convey. Verbal irony is a commonly studied form of indirect speech in which a speaker produces an explicit evaluative utterance that implicates an unstated, opposing evaluation. Producing and understanding ironic language, {{as well as many}} other types of indirect speech, requires the ability to recognize mental states in others, sometimes described as a capacity for metarepresentation. This article aims to connect common elements between the major theoretical approaches to verbal irony to recent psycholinguistic, developmental, and neuropsychological research demonstrating the necessity for metarepresentation in the effective use of verbal irony in social interaction. Here I will argue that verbal irony is one emergent, strategic possibility given the interface between people's ability to infer mental states, and use language. Rather than think of ironic communication as a specialized cognitive ability, I will claim that it arises from the same set of abilities that underlie a wide range of inferential communicative behaviors. © 2012 The <b>Author.</b> <b>Language</b> and Linguistics Compass © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|E
40|$|This year {{marks the}} fifteenth {{edition of the}} highly {{successful}} EURALEX congresses. In honour of this crystal jubilee, all major protagonists and topics of the fifteen congresses to date are reviewed, cross-compared with one another, and plotted through time.

The language of each paper (English, French, Russian, …) as well as its congress status (keynote, demo session, poster, …) were also noted. From these data various paper, <b>author,</b> <b>language</b> and country trends are derived. Second, a EURALEX citation database was constructed, in which each paper is linked with the citation data for that paper as found in Google Scholar. Various crosschecks were run, to improve on the search engine’s suggestions.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{distribution}} of word length in short native mythological and historical Eskimo narrative texts. To my knowledge, no Eskimo‐Aleut data have been the object of quantitative linguistic investigation so far. Due to the strong linguistic and Stylistic homogeneity of the examined texts {{it was assumed that}} these texts can be subsumed under a single law of word length distribution, if word length distribution of a text is considered as a function of certain of its properties, such as <b>author,</b> <b>language,</b> and genre. So far, word length distribution in texts {{of a wide variety of}} languages and genres has been demonstrated to follow distributions of the compound Poisson family of discrete probability distributions. In view of the morphological idiosyncrasies of the Eskimo language in general, which are responsible for an unusually high mean word length of about 4. 5 to 5. 2 syllables per word in the texts, it is interesting to see whether Eskimo texts show a significantly different behaviour with respect to word length. The results demonstrate that the Eskimo data employed in this study can be fitted well by the Hyperpoisson distribution. Two further discrete probability distributions will be deduced from certain morphology‐based assumptions about Eskimo. It turns out that most of the Eskimo data can be fitted by these two distributions. The question to what extent these results point to a more grammar‐oriented theory of word length is also discussed...|$|E
