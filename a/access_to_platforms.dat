Platform 14 can only be reached indirectly via the north-western end of platform 12. A footbridge crosses the north-western end of the station and gives <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>platforms</b> 1–12 and 14. There are ticket barriers to platforms 2–5 and 10–16.|$|E
5|$|To {{resolve the}} problem of overcrowding, the station began upgrade works in 2017. This {{includes}} a new northern exit/entrance on the north-west corner of Victoria Street, accessible via a new additional ticket office under Bressenden Place leading to both the Victoria line and the Circle and District line platforms. This upgrade is due to be finished by 2018, and tunnelling for the project was completed in September 2015. The work involved enlarging the existing Victoria line ticket hall serving the railway station and add a new relief bank of escalators there, which opened in January 2017. The redevelopment has been criticised, as <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>platforms</b> from the new escalators will be long and indirect compared to the direct access using the existing escalators.|$|E

2500|$|The {{mainline}} {{station is}} still {{covered by the}} vast iron and glass roofs dating from the 1870s. Platforms 1 to 6 are shorter than 7 to 9, the latter dealing mainly with long-distance services to London, Birmingham, Leeds, Sheffield and Norwich. <b>Access</b> <b>to</b> <b>platforms</b> 1–6 is through a ticket inspection barrier similar to airport passport control, while platform 7 is now gated {{with the creation of}} new shops and facilities. Platforms 8 and 9 are still [...] "open".|$|E
2500|$|Passengers {{can connect}} with GO Transit {{services}} through the [...] York Concourse, which opened on April 27, 2015, west of Union Station.

50|$|In 2014 {{the station}} {{received}} £4.6 million of government grants {{as part of}} the Access for All initiative to replace the footbridge at Brockenhurst with a new bridge complete with lift shafts.
