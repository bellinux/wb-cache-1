5|$|According {{to their}} {{eugenics}} policy, the Nazis {{believed that the}} disabled were a burden to society because they needed care and were considered an <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> their notion of a society composed of a perfect race. About 375,000 people were sterilized against their will due to their disabilities.|$|E
5|$|The victory proved short-lived, however: {{as early}} in 86 Fuscus {{embarked}} on an ill-fated expedition into Dacia, {{which resulted in the}} complete destruction of the fifth legion, Legio V Alaudae, in the First Battle of Tapae. Fuscus was killed, and the battle standard of the Praetorian Guard was lost. The loss of the battle standard, or aquila, was indicative of a crushing defeat and a serious <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> Roman national pride.|$|E
5|$|Lumumba's speech, {{broadcast}} {{live on the}} radio across the world, denounced colonialism and was interpreted as an <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> Belgium and Baudouin personally. While it was well-received within the Congo, it was widely condemned internationally as unnecessarily confrontational and for showing ingratitude {{at a time when}} Belgium had granted independence to the state. The speech nearly provoked a diplomatic incident between the Congo and Belgium and Lumumba later gave further speeches attempting to adopt a more conciliatory tone.|$|E
5000|$|... the {{turtleneck}} was the boldest {{of all the}} <b>affronts</b> <b>to</b> {{the status}} quo. It was the picture of masculine poise and arrogance, redolent of athletes, sportsmen, even U-boat commanders. The simplicity of its design made neckties seem fussy and superfluous by comparison ...|$|R
5000|$|Levant {{launched}} a website [...] "Stand With Ezra" [...] {{to support and}} fundraise for his defence, claiming that this and other lawsuits against him are <b>affronts</b> <b>to</b> Charter rights to free expression, describing them as [...] "nuisance” suits and politically motivated attempt to silence him which “add {{to the price of}} freedom in Canada.” ...|$|R
50|$|Katsu, a {{young man}} who has spent five years {{drifting}} around Japan, returns to his coastal village hometown hoping to restart his life. Though the villagers recognize him, he refuses to admit to his past identity. He sets about disrupting social conventions and engaging in sexual and violent <b>affronts</b> <b>to</b> decorum. A local girl befriends him.|$|R
5|$|The lavish banquet {{was certain}} to be an <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> those {{suffering}} {{in a time of}} severe austerity, but it was reported in the L'Ami du peuple and other firebrand newspapers as nothing short of a gluttonous orgy. Worst of all, the papers all dwelt scornfully on the reputed desecration of the tricolor cockade; drunken officers were said to have stamped upon this symbol of the nation and professed their allegiance solely to the white cockade of the House of Bourbon. This embellished tale of the royal banquet became the source of intense public outrage.|$|E
5|$|Under Islamic tradition, burial at sea is {{considered}} inappropriate when other, preferred forms of burial are available, and several prominent Islamic clerics criticized the decision. Mohamed Ahmed el-Tayeb, {{the head of}} Al-Azhar University, Egypt's seat of Sunni Muslim learning, said the disposal of the body at sea was an <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> religious and human values. Scholars like el-Tayeb hold that sea burials can only be allowed in special cases where the death occurred aboard a ship, and that the regular practice should have occurred in this case—the body buried in {{the ground with the}} head pointing to Islam's holy city of Mecca.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the end of}} the year, Gaveston had {{returned}} to England, and civil war appeared imminent. In May 1312, Gaveston was taken captive by the Earl of Pembroke, but Warwick and Lancaster had him abducted and executed after a mock trial. This <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> Pembroke’s honour drove him irrevocably into the camp of the king, and thereby split the opposition. The brutality of the act initially drove Lancaster and his adherents away from the centre of power, but the Battle of Bannockburn, in June 1314, returned the initiative. Edward was humiliated by his disastrous defeat, while Lancaster and Warwick had not taken part in the campaign, claiming that it was carried out without the consent of the baronage, and as such in defiance of the Ordinances.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{pressure}} from the city government against recruiting unemployed people due to the Depression, Parson continued doing so throughout the 1930s. But many of the migrants did not like life in the South End. There were bars, brothels and gambling houses in the neighborhood, <b>affronts</b> <b>to</b> their religious values. Having come from rural areas, they found northern city life hard to adjust to. Some returned to Mississippi.|$|R
50|$|According to the Nihon Kōki, Nakanari {{was a man}} {{of strong}} desires, and some of his actions were taken under the {{influence}} of alcohol. He was heedless of his personal position among his relatives, and could not be dissuaded of anything. As his sister Kusuko's influence grew, he rode higher and higher on the wave of her power, causing deep <b>affronts</b> <b>to</b> the royalty and to virtuous men.|$|R
5000|$|On September 2, 2015, it was {{announced}} that the lawsuit was settled with $125,000 being awarded to Daniel. The Jefferson Center for the Protection of Free Expression gave Ardis one of its annual Jefferson Muzzle Awards for [...] "the past year’s most outrageous and ridiculous <b>affronts</b> <b>to</b> free speech and press", declaring that he had [...] "abused the power of his office to intimidate and silence a harmless parodist".|$|R
5|$|Infuriated by {{what was}} {{perceived}} as yet another <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> British prestige after the recent landings at Pontian and Labis by Indonesian volunteers in southwestern Malaysia, members of the British Cabinet, particularly Peter Thorneycroft and Louis Mountbatten, favoured sending the carrier back through the Strait in spite of the Indonesian ban. Though British naval commanders in the Far East had grave concerns that the Victorious would be indefensible while in passage, the prevailing opinion was that not to send the ship would result in an immense political defeat on both a domestic and international scale as well as the loss of rights to an important waterway. Tension mounted as the British and Indonesians each refused to bend, and as the carrier's time to sail came, war became increasingly likely.|$|E
5|$|When Gaveston without {{permission}} returned from exile later the same year, a Baronial council entrusted Pembroke and The Earl of Surrey, {{with the task}} of taking him into custody. This they did on 19 May 1312, but not long after Thomas of Lancaster, acting with the Earls of Warwick, Hereford and Arundel, seized Gaveston and executed him on 19 June. This criminal act had the effect of garnering support for the King, and marginalising the rebellious earls. As far as Pembroke is concerned, the seizing and execution of a prisoner in his custody was a breach of the most fundamental chivalric codes, and a serious <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> his honour. The event must therefore be seen as pivotal in turning his sympathies away from the rebels and towards the King.|$|E
5|$|Edward's initial {{reaction}} to the news of Gaveston's execution was rage; according to the Vita Edwardi he swore to avenge the act. Circumstances, however, prevented him from taking immediate action against the executioners. During the previous raid on Newcastle, the King and Gaveston had to flee quickly, leaving behind horses and jewels worth {{a great amount of}} money. At the same time, the barons' extralegal action had alienated many of their former associates; the Earl of Pembroke in particular became strongly tied to the King's cause after the <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> his honour. Through the arbitration of the Earl of Gloucester and others, a settlement was finally reached on 14 October 1313, whereby the barons were given a pardon and the horses and jewels were returned to the King. The following years were marked by a constant power struggle between Edward and Lancaster, centred on the maintenance of the Ordinances. The matter was not finally settled until 1322, when Lancaster was defeated at the Battle of Boroughbridge, and executed.|$|E
5000|$|The South had its {{own version}} of the Social Gospel, {{focusing}} especially on prohibition. Other reforms included outlawing public swearing, boxing and dogfights and similar <b>affronts</b> <b>to</b> their moral sensibilities. By 1900, says Edward Ayers, the white Baptists, although they were the most conservative of all the denominations in the South, became steadily more concerned with social issues, taking stands on [...] "temperance, gambling, illegal corruption, public morality, orphans and the elderly." ...|$|R

It opposeth the righteousness of Christ, {{in that it}} seeketh {{itself to}} stand where should the righteousness of Christ--to wit, in God's affection for the {{justification}} of thy person; {{and this is one}} of the highest <b>affronts</b> <b>to</b> Christ that poor man is capable to give him: right worthily, therefore, doth the doctrine of the gospel damn the righteousness of men, and promiseth the kingdom of God to publicans and harlots rather.|$|R
5000|$|Reasons for unpopularity have {{included}} cultural issues and US foreign policy actions. Cultural grievances have been perceived <b>affronts</b> <b>to</b> Islam by US citizens. Unpopular foreign policy actions {{have included}} U.S. military actions on Pakistani soil such as drone attacks, the operation to kill Osama Bin Ladenand the 2011 NATO attack in Pakistan, as well CIA {{activities such as}} the Raymond Allen Davis incident, and the perceived inadequate US response to the humanitarian crisis of the 2010 Pakistan floods.|$|R
5|$|France and Austria {{signed a}} truce on 4 December and the Treaty of Pressburg 22 days later took the latter {{out of the}} war. Austria agreed to {{recognize}} French territory captured by the treaties of Campo Formio (1797) and Lunéville (1801), cede land to Bavaria, Wurttemberg, and Baden, which were Napoleon's German allies, and pay 40 million francs in war indemnities, and Venice {{was given to the}} Kingdom of Italy. It was a harsh end for Austria, but certainly not a catastrophic peace. The Russian army was allowed to withdraw to home territory and the French ensconced themselves in Southern Germany. The Holy Roman Empire was effectively wiped out, 1806 being seen as its final year. Napoleon created the Confederation of the Rhine, a string of German states meant to serve as a buffer between France and Prussia. Prussia saw these and other moves as an <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> its status as the main power of Central Europe and it went to war with France in 1806.|$|E
5|$|Sihanouk, who by now had {{tired of}} the {{political}} squabbling, dissolved the assembly in September 1949, but opted to rule by decree {{for the next two}} years before general elections were held, which the Democrats won. In October 1951 Thanh returned to Cambodia and was received by 100,000 supporters, a spectacle which Sihanouk saw as an <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> his regal authority. Thanh disappeared six months later, presumably to join the Khmer Issarak. Sihanouk ordered the Democrat-led government to arrest Thanh but was ignored. Subsequently, civil demonstrations rallying against the monarchy and the French broke out in the countryside, alarming Sihanouk, who began to suspect that the Democrats had played a complicit role in them. In June 1952 Sihanouk dismissed the Democrat nominee Huy Kanthoul and made himself prime minister. A few days later, Sihanouk privately confided in exasperation to the US chargé d'affaires, Thomas Gardiner Corcoran, that parliamentary democracy was unsuitable for Cambodia.|$|E
5|$|The nature {{artist and}} the fantasy artist in Potter are at odds: the mouse, the toad, and the insects share the same habitat but there seems no logical reason for the mouse and the toad to be {{humanised}} while the insects remain their natural selves. Logically, they should be humanised, too. While the toad is an invader like the insects, he does Mrs. Tittlemouse the service of ridding her house of the bees yet is inexplicably excluded from the party, an <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> the reader's sense of social right and wrong. It is possible Potter's carelessness {{in the details of}} Mrs. Tittlemouse can be attributed to a desire on her part to simply display her ability to draw from nature or to her interest in book production being supplanted by a growing interest in farming and local life and politics in Sawrey.|$|E
60|$|Willansborough {{was in a}} {{state of}} commotion. That new Vicar had not only filled the place with curates, multiplied {{services}} in the iron church, and carried on the building of St. Nicholas in a style of beauty that was quite <b>affronting</b> <b>to</b> those who were never asked to contribute to it, but he gave people no peace in their easy conventional sins, pricked them in their hearts with personal individual stings, and, worse than all, protested against the races, as conducted at Wil'sbro'.|$|R
50|$|These direct <b>affronts</b> <b>to</b> {{military}} prestige {{were too}} much for the army grandees to bear and set in motion the final split between the civilian-dominated Parliament and the army, which would culminate in the dissolution of Parliament and Cromwell's ultimate fall from power. When Cromwell refused a demand by the army to dissolve Parliament, troops were assembled at St. James's Palace. Cromwell eventually gave in to their demands and on 22 April, Parliament was dissolved and the Rump Parliament recalled on 7 May 1659.|$|R
5000|$|Catholics oppose acts {{considered}} {{attacks and}} <b>affronts</b> <b>to</b> human life, including abortion, fornication (including contraception), euthanasia, genocide, torture, {{the direct and}} intentional targeting of noncombatants in war, and every deliberate taking of innocent human life. In the Second Vatican Council's Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, Gaudium et spes (Latin for [...] "Joy and Hope"), it is written that “from the moment of its conception life must be guarded with the greatest care." [...] The Church does not oppose war in all circumstances. The Church's moral theology has generally emphasised just war theory.|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} of the Salisbury parliament, Hereford was {{accompanying}} two of the king's daughters to Brabant, and could not be present. On his return, however, as Constable of England, he joined Bigod in July in refusing to perform feudal service. The two earls were joined in their opposition by the earls of Arundel and Warwick. The main reasons for the magnates' defiance was the heavy burden of taxation caused by Edward's continuous warfare in Wales, France and Scotland. In this they were also joined by Robert Winchelsey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who {{was in the midst of}} an ongoing dispute with the king over clerical taxation. At one point Bohun and Bigod turned up in person at the Exchequer to protest a tax they claimed did not have the consent of the community of the realm. For Hereford there was also a personal element in the opposition to the king, after the humiliation and the <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> his liberties he had suffered over the dispute in the Marches. At a meeting just outside London, Bohun gave an impassioned speech objecting to the king's abuse of power and demanding the restoration of ancient liberties. The grievances were summarised in a document known as the Remonstrances.|$|E
5|$|During the 1840s and 1850s, {{a flurry}} of railroad-building {{activity}} led to the completion of four separate railroads converging in Erie. A break of gauge between the the Erie and North East Railroad and the Franklin Canal Companyensured that the citizens of Erie profited from the delays necessary to transfer cargo between the lines. When it was proposed in 1853 to standardize the track gauge to allow through traffic, a conflict that {{became known as the}} Erie Gauge War ensued. The residents of Erie, who saw it as an <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> their desire that the city become a major lake port, dismantled railroad bridges and tore up railroad tracks in the city in an effort to prevent the impending standardization. As part of the dispute's settlement, both railroads provided financial support for the construction of the Erie and Pittsburgh and Sunbury and Erie railroads. The Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad acquired the Franklin Canal Company in 1854, and the Erie and North East was merged with the Buffalo and State Line to form the Buffalo and Erie Railroad a few years later. The Sunbury and Erie was renamed the Philadelphia and Erie Railroad in 1861. The Pennsylvania Railroad soon acquired the Sunbury and Erie through a 999-year lease and funded completion of the line by 1864.|$|E
25|$|In the 1830s, some {{scholars}} {{claimed that the}} mounds were pure natural formations and not barrows.

60|$|I dreaded {{the sight}} of all of them; and yet if I did not engage them, I was sure of having the public {{clamorous}} against me. They drew full houses, {{and appeared to be}} making my fortune; but they swallowed up all the profits by their insatiable demands. They were absolute tape-worms to my little theatre; the more it took in, the poorer it grew. They were sure to leave me with an exhausted public, empty benches, and a score or two of <b>affronts</b> <b>to</b> settle among the townsfolk, in consequence of misunderstandings about the taking of places.|$|R

5000|$|In Offense to Others, {{the second}} volume of The Moral Limits of the Criminal Law, Feinberg offers {{one of the}} most famous thought-experiments in recent philosophy: a series of {{imaginary}} scenarios he calls [...] "a ride on the bus." [...] Feinberg invites us to imagine a bus ride in which you, a passenger rushing to an important appointment, are confronted by a series of deeply offensive but harmless acts. Some of the acts involve <b>affronts</b> <b>to</b> the senses (e.g., a man scratching his fingernails across a slate). Others involve acts that are deeply disgusting or revolting (e.g., eating various kinds of nauseatingly repulsive things). Still others involve <b>affronts</b> <b>to</b> our religious, moral, or patriotic sensibilities (e.g., overt acts of flag desecration); shocks to our sense of shame or embarrassment (such as acts of public sex); and a wide range of offensive conduct based on fear, anger, humiliation, boredom or frustration. The thought experiment is designed to test the limits of our tolerance for harmless but deeply offensive forms of behavior. More precisely, it raises the question [...] "whether there are any human experiences that are harmless in themselves yet so unpleasant that we can rightly demand legal protection from them even at the cost of other persons' liberties." [...] Feinberg argues that even left-leaning, highly tolerant liberals must recognize that some forms of harmless but profoundly offensive conduct can properly be criminalized.|$|R
25|$|There is {{controversy}} {{around the}} devices; {{much of the}} strongest objection to cochlear implants {{has come from the}} Deaf community.

25|$|Though the {{conventions}} of both major parties had just affirmed the finality of every provision of the Compromise of 1850, including the Fugitive Slave Act, Sumner called for the Act's repeal. For {{more than three hours}} he denounced it as a violation of the Constitution, an <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> the public conscience, and an offense against divine law.|$|E
25|$|Manuel Noriega became {{politically}} active at this time, {{and joined the}} Socialist party's youth wing. He did not stand out {{as a leader in}} the movement, preferring instead to stick to his books. But he wrote and published nationalist poems and articles attacking the US presence in Panama as an <b>affront</b> <b>to</b> attacking to Panamanian sovereignty.|$|E
5000|$|Howard had two {{brushes with}} stardom. First he {{appeared}} on the [...] "Colonel Tims Talent Time" [...] television show performing his stand-up comedy act, which consisted of personal <b>affronts</b> <b>to</b> his neighbors and [...] "one-horse" [...] jokes about Mayberry, causing him to be temporarily snubbed by the townsfolk (TAGS, [...] "Howard The Comedian", episode #216). Mayberry city council once sent him with Emmett Clark to a New York City TV station to promote traditional, small town values. Howard soon did a backspin and became an unabashed New Yorker, replete with a loud, paisley Nehru suit and hair bangs (Mayberry RFD, [...] "The Panel", episode 6).|$|R
60|$|Because of {{this she}} felt angered now with every one quite indiscriminately. A {{few years ago}} her sense of justice would have caused her to sift this matter through, to test for herself the rights or wrongs of an {{obviously}} bitter quarrel; but lately this sense of justice had become blunted, through many <b>affronts</b> <b>to</b> her personal dignity as a Queen and as a wife. It had left her with a morbid egotistical regard for the majesty of her Court: this she felt had been attainted; and now she only longed to get away, and leave behind her all this vulgarity, these passions, these petty quarrels, which she so cordially abhorred.|$|R
60|$|Elizabeth, having rather {{expected}} <b>to</b> <b>affront</b> him, {{was amazed}} at his gallantry; {{but there was a}} mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her <b>to</b> <b>affront</b> anybody; and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her.
