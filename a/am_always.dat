25|$|During {{training}}, conscripts woke {{up between}} 5-6 am and training lasted for 10-12 {{six days of}} the week. Much of the training was done by rote and consisted of instruction. Before 1941 training had lasted for six months, but after the war, training was shorted to a few weeks. After finishing training, all men {{had to take the}} Oath of the Red Army which read: I______, a citizen of the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics, entering into the ranks of the Red Army of the Workers and Peasants', take this oath and solemnly promise to be a honest, brave, disciplined, vigilant fighter, staunchly to protect military and state secrets, and unquestioningly to obey all military regulations and orders of commanders and superiors.I promise conscientiously to study military affairs, in every way to protect state secrets and state property, and to my last breath to be faithful to the people, the Soviet Motherland, and the Workers-Peasants' Government.I <b>am</b> <b>always</b> prepared on order of the Workers and Peasants Government to rise to the defense of my Motherland, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; and as a fighting man of the Red Army of Workers and Peasants', I promise to defend it bravely, skillfully, with dignity and honor, sparing neither my blood nor my life itself for the achievement of total victory over our enemies.If by evil intent I should violate this, my solemn oath, then let the severe punishment of Soviet law and the total hatred and contempt of the working classes befall me. Tactics were based on the 1936 training manual and the revised edition of 1942. Small unit movements and how to build defensive positions were laid out in a manner that was easy to understand and memorize. The manuals had the force of law and violations of the manuals were legal offenses. Soviet tactics always had the platoons attacking in the same way with the platoons usually broke into four sections occupying about 100 yards on average. The only complex formation was the diamond formation with one section advancing, two behind and one in the rear. Unlike the Wehrmacht, the Red Army did not engage in leap-frogging of sections with one section providing fire support to the sections that were advancing, and instead all of the sections and platoons attacked en masse. The other only variation was for the sections to “seep” into a position by infiltration.|$|E

With her neatly-set hair, comfortable, bustling manner, and brilliant smile, she has been dispensing homespun advice – and, of course, those celebrated hotpots – at the Rovers Return for more than a generation." [...] Commenting on her 30th anniversary with the show, Betty Driver said, [...] "It is just amazing that I've been here for 30 years. I suppose I have never really counted up the time I've been with the show, because I still enjoy it so much and <b>am</b> <b>always</b> looking forward rather than back.

Although Powell was scared of Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but {{when she said that}} she was engaged, he screamed out, [...] "I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?" [...] She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive and often terrified Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song Getting Better told his own story, [...] "I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically—any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit.

500|$|Susan B. Anthony, Stanton's {{best and}} most {{faithful}} collaborator, concluded after years of working for women's rights that the concentration on one issue—votes for women—was the key to bringing success to the movement. The women's organizations had too varied a membership to agree on anything more complex. Stanton insisted, however, that the women's rights conventions were too narrowly focused; she brought forward a variety of challenging concepts {{in the form of}} essays for Anthony to read to the audiences. When Stanton made known her interest in completing The Woman's Bible, Anthony was unhappy at the futility of the effort, a harmful digression from the focused path which led to woman suffrage. Anthony wrote to Clara Bewick Colby to say of Stanton [...] "of all her great speeches, I <b>am</b> <b>always</b> proud—but of her Bible commentaries, I am not proud—either of their spirit or letter... But I shall love and honor her to the end—whether her Bible please me or not. So I hope she will do for me." ...|$|E

Rodgers {{enlisted the help}} of his former Chic bandmates Edwards, who was the bassist, and Tony Thompson, who played the drums; they appeared on several tracks of the album. Rodgers decided to be the guitarist, when Edwards requested him to do so, in exchange for their help. The recording sessions did not start until the afternoon as Rodgers, who attended late-night parties, was not accustomed to work in early mornings. The schedule was also difficult for Madonna, who recalled that she used to [...] "go to the swim club on the Upper West Side and go swimming and walk from there to the recording studio. It was impossible for me to reach there at morning." [...] Rodgers recalled that Madonna was a real hard worker and incredibly tenacious. He commented: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>always</b> amazed by Madonna's incredible judgement {{when it comes to making}} pop records. I've never seen anyone do it better, and that's the truth. When we did that album, it was the perfect union, and I knew it from the first day in the studio.

500|$|Soon {{after writing}} these letters, Prince Albert died on 14 December 1861. His death helped Ernest repair his {{relationship}} with his sister-in-law, as Victoria had been becoming increasingly angrier over Ernest's objections to the Danish match. The two brothers had always been close, whatever their disagreements, and Albert's death left Ernest [...] "wretched", noted Victoria in a letter to her eldest daughter. The death did not solve their argument however; seeing that his direct involvement had failed to persuade Victoria, Ernest tried a new tactic. He began to spread gossip about Alexandra and her family, in which her mother Princess Louise [...] "had had illegitimate children and Alexandra had had flirtations with young officers"; he also wrote to Louise herself, warning that Bertie would be an unfortunate choice for a husband. Additionally, Ernest met with his nephew at Thebes, most likely attempting to discourage him from the match in person. In an 11 April letter, Victoria unhappily noted to her eldest daughter [...] "You did not tell me that Bertie had met Uncle Ernest at Thebes...I <b>am</b> <b>always</b> alarmed when I think of Uncle Ernest and Bertie being together as I know the former will do all he can to set Bertie against the marriage with Princess Alix". Despite Ernest's disapproval, Bertie was duly married to Alexandra on 10 March 1863.|$|E
500|$|Having been {{released}} by Stevenage {{at the end}} of the 2010–11 season, Odubade signed for Conference National side Gateshead on 7 June 2011. He joined Gateshead on a free transfer, signing for the club alongside Eddie Odhiambo; the two had previously played alongside each other at Oxford United, Stevenage, and Newport County. On joining Gateshead, Odubade said [...] "I have parted company with Stevenage on good terms and this is now a new chapter for me. Gateshead is a good club that is moving in the right direction and I'm sure we can kick on next season. I don't look back with any regrets as things happen for a reason. I <b>am</b> <b>always</b> looking forward. Gateshead is a new challenge for me and I can only see good things coming from it". He made his Gateshead debut on 13 August 2011 in the club's 3–2 away win against Kidderminster Harriers at Aggborough, assisting Kris Gate's goal in the 80th minute. Odubade scored his first goal for Gateshead three days later at Gateshead International Stadium in Gateshead's 3–0 win against Mansfield Town, which was voted Goal of the Season in the club's end of season awards. His first season at Gateshead was disrupted by two-foot injuries midway through the campaign, with Odubade breaking his metatarsal bone on two occasions, subsequently missing a total of 18 games. Despite the injuries, he made 34 appearances throughout the season, scoring seven times. He signed a one-year contract extension with Gateshead in May 2012.|$|E
