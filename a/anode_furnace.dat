Capacity is 450,000 tonnes p.a. concentrate to produce 110,000 tonnes copper annually. Off gasses go to a Hugo Petersen sulphuric acid plant. [...] The refinery produces cathode copper, and gold, silver and selenium are produced from the anode slime {{left over from the}} refining process.|$|E
50|$|From 1973, the CSIRO {{scientists}} began {{a series}} of trials using the Sirosmelt lance to recover metals from industrial slags in Australia, including lead softener slag at the Broken Hill Associated Smelters in Port Pirie (1973), tin slag from Associated Tin Smelters in Sydney (1974), copper converter slag at the Electrolytic Refining and Smelting ("ER&S") Port Kembla plant (1975) and copper <b>anode</b> <b>furnace</b> slag at Copper Refineries Limited (another subsidiary of MIM Holdings) in Townsville (1976) and of copper converter slag in Mount Isa (1977). The work then proceeded to smelting tin concentrates (1975) and then sulfidic tin concentrates (1977).|$|E
50|$|The {{blister copper}} {{is put into}} an <b>anode</b> <b>furnace,</b> a furnace that refines the blister copper to anode-grade copper in two stages by {{removing}} {{most of the remaining}} sulfur and iron, and then removing oxygen introduced during the first stage. This second stage, often referred to as poling is done by blowing natural gas, or some other reducing agent, through the molten copper oxide. When this flame burns green, indicating the copper oxidation spectrum, the oxygen has mostly been burned off. This creates copper at about 99% pure. The anodes produced from this are fed to the electrorefinery.|$|E
50|$|The smelter smelts {{the copper}} {{concentrate}} mixed with silica in the Isasmelt furnace. The product from the ISA furnace is matte and slag which {{goes to the}} Matte Settling Electric Furnace. Slag is tapped out and discarded. Matte is tapped out and taken to the PS converters for further processing to blister copper. The blister copper is then further processed in <b>Anode</b> <b>furnaces</b> and, thereafter, the copper is cast into anodes in a twin casting wheel. The anodes are then sent to the refinery for electro-refining.|$|R
5000|$|From its inception, {{the copper}} smelter had been {{producing}} blister copper, originally {{for sale and}} then for refining at MIM's copper refinery in Townsville. This changed in June 1979, when two 320 tonne capacity rotary [...] "anode furnaces" [...] and a Mitsui-design anode casting wheel were commissioned in the Mount Isa smelter. The move to end exporting cold blister copper from the Mount Isa smelter resulted in substantial energy savings, because the <b>anode</b> <b>furnaces</b> received molten blister copper from the converters, meaning that cold blister copper {{did not have to}} be reheated and melted before being cast into anodes for electrolytic refining.|$|R
5000|$|The present mine is a {{conventional}} truck and shovel operation, {{with a large}} proportion of the ore crushed in-pit and transported by underground conveyors to the mill bins. The 182,000 tonnes p.a. concentrator is also conventional and is primary crushing followed by SAG mills and ball mills with cyclone classification. The flotation section produces both copper and molybdenum concentrates. [...] The 1.65 million tonnes p.a. of concentrate are smelted in one Outokumpu flash smelter and one Teniente converter with electric furnace and cylindrical slag cleaning followed by four Pierce Smith converters. The blister copper goes to six <b>anode</b> <b>furnaces</b> which feed three anode casting wheels. The anodes go on to the 855,000 tonnes p.a. electrolytic refinery.|$|R
5000|$|Poling is a {{metallurgical}} method {{employed in}} the purification of copper which contains cuprous oxide as an impurity {{and also in the}} purification of tin ("Sn") which contains tin oxide (stannic oxide or [...] "SnO2") as an impurity. The impure metal, usually in the form of molten blister copper, is placed in an <b>anode</b> <b>furnace</b> for two stages of refining. [...] In the first stage, sulfur and iron are removed by gently blowing air through the molten metal to form iron oxides and sulfur dioxide. The iron oxides are skimmed or poured {{off the top of the}} copper and the gaseous sulfur dioxide exits the furnace via the off-gas system. Once the first oxidation stage is complete, the second stage (reduction or poling) begins. This involves using a reducing agent, normally natural gas or diesel (but ammonia, liquid petroleum gas, and naphtha [...] can also be used), to react with the oxygen in the copper oxide to form copper metal. In the past, freshly cut ("green") trees were used as wooden poles. The sap in these poles acted as the reducing agent. The heat of the copper makes the pole emit a gas that reduces the cuprous oxide to copper.|$|E
40|$|There are {{presents}} the internal recycling in <b>anode</b> <b>furnace,</b> {{in addition to}} mainly blister copper and converter copper. During the process there arise {{the two types of}} semi-finished products intended for further pyro metallurgical processing: anode copper and anode slag. The stream of liquid blister copper enters into the <b>anode</b> <b>furnace</b> treatment, in which the losses are recovered, e. g. copper, resulting from oxidation and reduction of sulfides, oxides and the oxidation of metallic compounds of lead, zinc and iron. In the liquid phase there are still gaseous states, which gives the inverse relationship relating to the solid phase, wherein the gases found an outlet in waste gas or steam. The results of chemical analysis apparently differ from each other, because crystallite placement, the matrix structure and the presence of other phases and earth elements are not compared, which can be regained in the process of electrorefining. One should not interpret negatively smaller proportion of copper in the alloy, since during the later part of the production more elements can be obtained, for example from sludge, such as platinum group metals and lanthanides. According to the research the quality of blister copper, to a large extent, present in the alloy phase to many other elements, which can be recovered...|$|E
40|$|Copper {{reduction}} {{represents one}} of the steps in the process of fire refining of blister copper. Process of copper reduction with natural gas as performed in the <b>anode</b> <b>furnace</b> was modeled. Numerical analysis was conducted using the IPSA (Inter- Phase-Slip Algorithm) module of PHOENICS package and standard turbulent model k - ε. The model takes into account the liquid phase - slag and phase of natural gas which is supplied through the tuyere {{from the bottom of the}} charge. Calculations were made for two different diameters of tuyeres for supply of reducer. Based on the calculations and analysis, it was found out that the gas flow which causes strong movement in the bath guarantees homogeneous composition of the liquid copper in each process stage. Application of a tuyere with a larger diameter results in a greater intensity of the reduction process and better use of the reducer...|$|E

Capacity is now 130,000 tonnes daily, split equally between SAG and conventional milling, followed by flotation, thickening and filtration. The recent increase in mill capacity has been necessary {{to compensate for the}} gradual move of mining into the lower grade primary ore zone. The concentrate goes to the Caletones smelter further down the valley. This is equipped with two Teniente converters with slag furnaces, three Pierce Smith converters and six <b>anode</b> <b>furnaces</b> feeding two <b>anode</b> and one fire refined casting wheels.

Spent {{refractory lining}} from an <b>anode</b> baking <b>furnace</b> after 4000 days in operation was investigated. Variation in the density and porosity across the bricks revealed that carbon build up in pores had taken place towards the anode side. The spent refractory bricks were investigated with respect to chemical and mineralogical composition by X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy. No {{significant change in the}} mineralogical composition across the brick could be detected by X-ray diffraction.

40|$|A 1 / 12 scale {{tank was}} {{constructed}} to physically simulate the metallurgical skimming process {{in order to}} gain a better insight of the skimming of fluid slag from copper <b>anode</b> <b>furnaces.</b> 1 -decanol and water were used to represent the slag and the underlying liquid metal respectively. It was observed that slag skimming was comprised of two steps, a transportation step to carry slag to the skimming lip, and a removal step to move the slag across the lip. The efficiency of the transportation by bath surface circulation was strongly affected by the method of creation of the surface movement. Submerged gas injection failed to carry slag to the lip effectively because of the uncontrollable circulation pattern generated on the bath surface. On the other hand, three impinging gas jets in glancing contact with the bath surface were able to carry slag to the lip effectively. The Re of the jets (I. D. 0. 01 m) inclined 50 ° to the horizontal was 6100. The jet configuration was two of the jets were placed close and parallel to the rear wall of the model and faced each other. The third jet was parallel to the model short axis and was directed at the skimming mouth. With the same amount of time, 70 % of the slag originally charged to the tank was skimmed with the assistance from the impinging gas jets in comparison to 20 % when no jet was used. Detailed analysis of the skimming process revealed that the underlying liquid bath level continuously decreased as the slag was skimmed and resulted in continuous reduction of the skimming rate. In order to compensate the reduction of skimming rate due to bath level reduction, a control strategy was proposed for rotating the furnace continuously to maximize the skimming effectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{penetration}} and {{corrosion resistance}} to copper and anode slag of six magnesia-chromite and six chrome-free refractory brick types were tested using static finger tests at a typical copper-refining temperature (1300 degrees C). The microstructures of the as-delivered and tested refractory types were investigated {{by means of}} electron-probe micro-analysis (EPMA) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. The {{results showed that the}} overall wear rate of the fingers was very low, {{with the exception of the}} alumina-based brick made of fused corundum and magnesia-alumina spinel. and the magnesia-based brick made of sintered magnesia and zircon addition. In all refractory types new phases were formed as a result of slag-refractory interactions. Apart from the samples recovered from the copper zone of the latest generation of direct-bonded magnesia-chromite bricks, all the rest were completely infiltrated by copper and slag components (copper oxide, iron oxide, alumina and silica). However, the amount of infiltrated liquid in the chrome-free types was higher than in the magnesia-chromite bricks. Explanations are provided for the distinct infiltration behaviour. The results show that economically viable chrome-free refractory alternatives are still elusive for <b>anode</b> <b>furnace</b> linings. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Aluminum is {{produced}} by the electrolytic reduction of alumina dissolved in molten cryolite. This process requires carbon anodes which are consumed during the electrolysis. The anodes contribute roughly with 15 % to the total aluminum production cost. If the anode quality is poor the share can as well reach 25 %. It is known that the anode behavior during aluminum electrolysis is significantly influenced by the anode baking process. However, {{there is a lack}} of knowledge to predict the anode behavior through given baking parameters. In addition, process control of industrial furnaces is still to a large degree empirical. Often the emission of industrial furnaces causes problems as deposits can accumulate in the exhaust system which leads to fire incidents. This investigation has three major goals: The prediction of the anode behavior during electrolysis for a given heat treatment. The understanding of the process control of industrial scale open-top <b>anode</b> baking <b>furnaces.</b> The emission control of the open-top <b>anode</b> baking <b>furnace.</b> The baking parameters are defined in this thesis as the anode heat-up rate and the baking level. Through pilot baking it is shown that the baking level is basically determined by the final baking temperature although the soaking duration has some influence too. The anode baking level can be estimated with a calculation for any given baking curve. Therefore the impact of the temperature and soaking duration on the real density anode property needs to be determined through a pilot study. The optimum baking parameters regarding the anode behavior during electrolysis depend on the material. Some anode materials react more sensitive to the heat treatment than others do and are therfore more difficult to handle in the industrial baking process. Through pilot scale anode baking it is shown how to predict the anode behavior during electrolysis. Process control of the anode baking in industrial open-top furnaces is complex since the anode baking is indirectly controlled by the combustion process inside the flues. Through measurements the combustion process is analyzed in this thesis. The results show that a furnace operated at its physical limits is difficult to control regarding to emissions. However, the gained knowledge allows to optimize existing furnace process control systems. The furnace emissions are mainly caused by insufficient combustion of the pitch fumes formed during the pyrolysis of the anode binder pitch. It is shown that emission problems cannot always be solved by a well chosen control system setup. In such a situation combustion control is required in addition to temperature control. A technology has been developed to measure online the combustion situation of each flue. For this purpose 2 -color pyrometers, together with an intelligent signal processing, are required. This technology is integrated since 10 months in an industrial baking furnace control system. The results are promising. The developed technology is an important step for furnace operation at maximum productivity and minimum emission.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this program is to investigate the production of electrode binder pitch, valued at $ 250 [...] $ 300 /ton, from mild gasification liquids. In the IGT MILDGAS process, the 400 C+ distillation residue (crude pitch) comprises up to 20 wt% of maf feed coal. The largest market for pitch made from coal liquids is the aluminum industry, which uses it to make carbon <b>anodes</b> for electrolytic <b>furnaces.</b> In this project, crude MILDGAS pitch is being modified by flash thermocracking to achieve binder pitch specifications.

In general, thermocracking at 750 [...] 850 C in N{sub 2 } resulted in a pitch which meets binder pitch requirements for QI, TI, softening point, and C:H ratio. Further improvements in density and sulfur content are required. Test anodes were prepared by Alcoa using the upgraded mild gasification pitch.
