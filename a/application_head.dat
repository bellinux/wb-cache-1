40|$|Most {{surveillance}} cameras have a wide-angle {{field of view}} and are situated unobtrusively in overhead positions. For this type of <b>application,</b> <b>head</b> pose estimation is very challenging because {{of the limitations of}} the quality and resolution of the incoming data. In addition, as a person moves, their pose relative to the camera changes, but the desired pose is the absolute pose with respect to the room or space. In this paper, we present a solution to estimate absolute coarse head pose for wide-angle overhead cameras by integrating 3 D head position and pose information. The work involves image-based learning, pose correction based on 3 D position, and real-time multi-camera integration of low-resolution imagery. The system can be applied to an active face cataloguer to obtain the best view of the face for surveillance, to customer relationship management to record behavior in retail stores or to virtual reality as an input device...|$|E
40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} nitrogen rate and bio-fertilizer application on grain, milling, and head rice yields, a field experiment was conducted at Rice Research Station of Tonekabon, Iran, in 2013. The experimental design was a factorial treatment arrangement in a randomized complete block with three replicates. Factors were three N rates (0, 75, and 150 kg ha - 1) and two bio-fertilizer applications (inoculation and uninoculation with Nitroxin, a liquid bio-fertilizer containing Azospirillum spp. and Azotobacter spp. bacteria). Analysis of variance showed that rice grain yield, panicle number per m 2, grain number per panicle, flag leaves area, biological yield, grains N concentration and uptake, grain protein concentration, and head rice yield were significantly affected by N rate, while bio-fertilizer application had significant effect on rice grain yield, grain number per panicle, flag leaves area, biological yield, harvest index, grains N concentration and uptake, and grain protein concentration. Results showed that regardless of bio-fertilizer application, rice grain and biological yields were significantly increased as N application rate increased from 0 to 75 kg ha - 1, but did not significantly increase at the higher N rate (150 kg ha - 1). Grain yield was significantly increased following bio-fertilizer application when averaged across N rates. Grains N concentration and uptake were significantly increased as N rate increased up to 75 kg ha - 1, but further increases in N rate had no significant effect on these traits. Bio-fertilizer application increased significantly grains N concentration and uptake, when averaged across N rates. Regardless of bio-fertilizer <b>application,</b> <b>head</b> rice yield was significantly increased from 56  % to 60  % when N rate increased from 0 to 150 kg ha - 1. Therefore, this experiment illustrated that rice grain and head yields increased with increasing N rate, while bio-fertilizer application increased only rice grain yield. </p...|$|E

The extension requires a novel differential geometry approach, in which covariances are projected on a unique tangent space, where standard machine learning techniques can be applied. In particular, we adopt the Campbell-Baker-Hausdorff expansion as a means to approximate on the tangent space the genuine (geodesic) distances on the manifold, in a very efficient way. We test our methodology on multiple benchmark datasets, and also propose new testing sets, getting convincing results in all the cases...|$|R

Comparison of the conventional nonetched and surface emitting edge emitter light outputs demonstrates an improvement in the outcoupling efficiency by a factor of 4 at 620 V. Additionally, a Gaussian angular distribution with a FWHM ∼ 40 deg has been measured from each edge, being the Gaussian maximum coincident with the microstructure wall side angle.
