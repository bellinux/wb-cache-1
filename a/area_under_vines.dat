50|$|The {{period from}} the end of the 18th century to the mid 19th century was one of {{expansion}} for the area. Wines and spirits were exported to northern Europe and to the Americas and grapes became the dominant crop. In this period terraces were built on the mountainsides to increase the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>vines</b> as much as possible. The railway connecting Montblanc to Reus on the coast was built in order to transport wine more rapidly and efficiently.|$|E
25|$|Because of a wine glut (wine lake) in {{the generic}} production, the price squeeze induced by an {{increasingly}} strong international competition, and vine pull schemes, {{the number of}} growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>vine</b> has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the viticulture in Romania, analysing the <b>areas</b> <b>under</b> <b>vine,</b> in a structural approach, and the yields and the production of grapes. The data regarding the lands <b>under</b> <b>vines,</b> yields and productions of grapes have been collected from the National Institute of Statistics. The main results show that Romania has high potential for wine production; 1. 3 % of the agricultural areas are cultivated with vineyards, but it has structural problems. Among the 189, 000 ha of vines, 48 % are hybrids, which produce wines forbidden to be traded on the market. Those areas belong to small exploitations that produce for self-consumption, while bigger exploitations cultivate grafted vineyards that produce noble assortments of wine...|$|R
50|$|Tarragona {{has been}} {{renowned for its}} sweet red wines since the times of the ancient Romans, when it was {{exported}} to Rome. The <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>vines</b> expanded constantly over the centuries {{to the point that}} in 1900 over 50% of the province was covered by vineyards. It was badly affected by the outbreak of the phylloxera plague at that time. In 1932 the wines from the area were given a form of legal protection, and in 1976 it acquired DO status.|$|E
50|$|The estate {{has three}} vineyards; the largest is {{adjacent}} to Château Latour, {{with a smaller}} plot down the road adjacent to Château Pichon-Lalande. Both of these plots are relatively close to the Gironde; the third plot is further inland, adjacent to Château Grand-Puy-Lacoste. The soil consists mainly of a deep bed of gravel over limestone affording drainage. The total <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>vine</b> is 30 ha, with an average vine age of 40 years. Vines are replanted individually, with the varietal mix being approximately 70% Cabernet Sauvignon and 30% Merlot. In 2009, the final blend of the grand vin was 68% Cabernet, 32% Merlot.|$|R
5000|$|In France, in Lorraine {{around the}} city of Metz, about 1500 hectoliters of wine {{annually}} is produced as AOC Moselle. These wines together with Côtes de Toul make up the 200 hectares of [...] "wines of the east" [...] (vins de l'Est). The most commonly grown grape varieties are Auxerrois Blanc and Müller-Thurgau, and the other allowed varieties are Gamay, Gewürztraminer, Meunier, Pinot noir, Pinot blanc, Pinot gris and Riesling. Previously, the name [...] "Vins de Moselle" [...] was used, between 1995 and 2010 the official name was VDQS Moselle. As the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>vine</b> is very small, these wines are seldom seen on the export market.|$|R
50|$|Until a {{few decades}} ago, Côte-Rôtie never was a serious {{competitor}} of Hermitage, which was the only northern Rhône vineyard which was well-known far from the region. Although Rhône wines in general started to be more in demand from the early 1970s, and stronger so from the late 1970s/early 1980s, in the case Côte-Rôtie it was the wines of Marcel Guigal which gave the appellation increased attention from the early 1980s. This included top notes from international wine critics' for Guigal's top wines La Mouline and La Landonne. Increasing demand led to new plantations inside the appellation's border, which was far from fully exploited. From 1982 to 2005, the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>vine</b> increased from 102 ha to 231 ha.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{aimed to}} make an {{analysis}} {{on the evolution of}} the <b>areas</b> <b>under</b> <b>vines</b> in Romania for the period 2003 - 2013 related with the factors that contributed to this evolution. The research method is related with dynamic analyze of time data series, using absolute and relative indicators. The discussions are focused on evolution of total vineyards, underlining the evolution tendencies of grafted vines areas. In Romania, the areas decreased with 23, 5 % during the period 2003 - 2013. The share of grafted vines in the total areas increased from 49, 62 % in 2003 to 50, 03 % in 2013, but in absolute term the areas with grafted vines decreased with 26. 042 ha in the selected period...|$|R
50|$|Château-Grillet {{is one of}} the {{smallest}} appellations in France, but the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>vine</b> expanded in the 1970s and 1980s (the era when Rhône wines started to see an increase in demand), from 1.7 ha in 1971, to 2.3 ha in 1977, 3.0 ha in 1982 and 3.8 ha in 1991, which has remained the vineyard area until at least 2005. This was achieved by actually planting the full area within the appellation border, and this is now practically fully planted to vines. Château-Grillet is sometimes erroneously claimed to be {{the smallest}} appellation in France, which is incorrect since several Burgundy Grand Cru appellations are smaller. At the start of the 1970s expansion, Château-Grillet was actually of the same size as Romanée-Conti, but its neighbour La Romanée is only of half as large, or 0.85 ha.|$|R
40|$|In Italy, {{large-scale}} {{changes in}} the structure of land use can be observed. These are caused primarily by socio-economic pressures, generally determining the conversion of agricultural land into artificial surfaces. Our aim was to investigate if and how sprawl dynamics influence viticultural landscapes (that is, if they result in scattered, intermediate, or compact urban developments). We focused on selected territories in North-East Italy, where vine-growing provides almost uninterrupted land cover, as case study areas. Using GIS-based techniques, we documented the processes of land use, analyzing the resulting changes of urban-rural forms and in territorial shapes. Results at the Provincial level showed decreasing dispersed artificial surfaces and increasing clustered urban developments. This trend is also detected in <b>areas</b> <b>under</b> <b>vine,</b> but in general is more modest. Our research indicates that typical agricultural productions can determine resistance to the alienation of land, maintaining a sufficient consistency for areas to develop in a more varied and articulated (for example touristic) manner...|$|R
5000|$|First {{recorded}} at Castell in 1659, Silvaner (with an 'i') reached a {{peak in the}} 1960s-1970s, with 30% of German vineyards. However overproduction during the Liebfraumilch years ruined its reputation, and it has since retreated to its stronghold in Franconia (Frankenland) (1,425 ha), where on the best chalky Muschelkalk terroir it can produce wines that can compete with the best German white wines which usually are made out of the Riesling grape. These powerful wines are considered food-friendly and are often described as having an [...] "earthy" [...] palate. Under VDP Erste Lage/Grosses Gewächs rules, Silvaner {{may be used for}} Grosses Gewächs wines (top-end dry wines), but only in Franconia and Saale-Unstrut and not in any of the other 11 German wine regions. Silvaner is also grown in Rheinhessen (2,486 ha) and Palatinate, and is sometimes also made into dessert wine.

50|$|The Soave DOC {{was created}} in 1968 with those {{boundaries}} revised and expanded periodically {{over the next few}} decades.As a point of introduction, it should be said that Soave and Chianti were the first zones in Italy (in 1931) to be recognized by Royal Decree as having the potential for producing fine wines. This document delimited the borders of the production zones which, in the case of Soave, coincide with those fixed under the current production regulations for Soave Classico.Situated {{in the eastern part of}} the Province of Vicenza, in the foothills of the Lessini Mountains, the Soave zone is a not particularly large wine region which, however, produces very significant quantities of wine, in virtue of the fact that the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>vine</b> is one of the most specialized and densely planted in Europe. In this area, there exists a traditional and indissoluble link between viticulture and terroir; the area of specialized vineyards has remained practically unchanged compared to 100 years ago and indeed there does not seem to be any valid reason why it should increase.|$|R
5000|$|The Yarra Valley was Victoria's first planted wine region, {{beginning}} with a vineyard at Yering Station in 1838. The Ryrie brothers, moving their cattle south from Sydney, took up a grazing license of 43,000 acres and planted two varietals, the Black Cluster of Hamburg and Sweetwater. The property {{was taken over by}} Swiss-born Paul de Castella in 1850 and developed into a major wine centre for the region, its increasing profile recognised in 1861 when it won the Argus Gold Cup for best Victorian vineyard. [...] In 1863, Hubert de Castella established St Huberts Winery and Guillame de Pury founded Yeringberg, increasing the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>vine</b> to 430 acres.

50|$|The Terrasses de Larzac area is in {{the north}} of the Hérault department. It is in an {{unsymmetrical}} V shape crossed by the north-south flowing Hérault River. The Causse du Larzac runs along the entire northern boundary. To the west it stretches along the Lergue river bed, whilst to the north-east it stretches along the sides of the Séranne mountains, along the Buèges valley. Mount Saint Baudille rises from the centre in the first foothills of the Larzac. At the foot of the Causse du Larzac there are a succession of old terraces at around 50 metres (165 ft) above the Hérault and Lergue rivers.Whereas some slopes which form a natural boundary for the Terrasses du Larzac do rise to over 800 metres (2650 ft), the <b>areas</b> <b>under</b> <b>vines</b> and classed as AOC Coteaux du Languedoc range from 50 - 300 metres (165 - 990 ft) up the slopes of the Causse and on the old terraces. The climate zone with the widest temperature variations in the region, it enjoys relatively cool summer nights thanks to its distance from the sea and proximity to the mountainous Causse. As a result the grapes mature slowly and steadily which is beneficial both to their colour and the wines’ aromatic qualities.|$|R
