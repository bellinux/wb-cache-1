In 2010 only 8 ESCOs where active, nowadays more than 30 are available and the market is still expanding rapidly. To further support the growth of the ESCOs market, LCEC launched an initiative in NEAAP called “Paving the Way for Energy Audit and ESCO Business”. The purpose of this initiative is to support the development of the ESCO working in the energy audit business and provide them with the suitable financial, fiscal and technical incentives to remove all the obstacles hindering their growth. To support this initiative, LCEC has offered periodical trainings, workshops and seminars on energy audit <b>activities</b> <b>and</b> <b>procedures</b> to technician, engineers, bankers and to all those involved in the field.The ESCO pre-qualification programme was launched by LCEC by 2014 in order to regulate the market and have a recommended list of companies for potential projects.|$|E

50|$|On 8 December 2007, the Mission Management Team met to {{finalize}} {{plans for the}} Sunday launch, and discuss possible launch options. There was a unanimous decision to attempt a Sunday launch using the modified Launch Commit Criteria. The modified criteria require all four ECO sensors to function normally during tanking, include {{the implementation of a}} Flight Controller procedure to continue monitoring the ECO sensors after liftoff during ascent, and shorten the launch window from five minutes to one minute to conserve fuel. Those changes would be done only for the launch of STS-122, and are not permanent changes. Should any of the sensors give errors during tanking, the launch attempt would be scrubbed. Following STS-122, Space Shuttle Program Director Wayne Hale and Mission Management Team Chairman LeRoy Cain explained {{that there would be a}} variety of <b>activities</b> <b>and</b> <b>procedures</b> put into effect to address the ECO issues. A multi-center troubleshooting team would be convened, and changes to the main engines would be performed, to improve the way the engines use and control the liquid hydrogen reserves, including upgrades to the flow meters inside the engines.|$|E

Parental involvement means the participation of parents in regular, two-way, and meaningful communication involving student academic learning and other school activities, including ensuring that parents: A. Play an integral role in assisting their child’s learning; B. Are encouraged to be actively involved in their child’s education at school; and C. Are full partners in their child’s education and are included, as appropriate, in decision-making and on advisory committees to assist in the education of their child. II. The board of directors adopts as part of this policy the following guidance for parent involvement. The District shall: A. Put into operation programs, <b>activities</b> <b>and</b> <b>procedures</b> for the involvement of parents in all of its Title I schools consistent with federal laws including the development and evaluation of policy. Those programs, <b>activities</b> <b>and</b> <b>procedures</b> will be planned and operated with meaningful consultation with parents of participating children; B.

At the same time, the analysis also identifies the causes and forms of a process of acculturation, namely: change in the way of life, the spread of literacy, the shift from traditional farming to factory work, the end of intensive contact with the natural environment, the loss of situations serving for the circulation of oral tradition...|$|R

To effectively support object-oriented software metrics practice, a model-based approach to object-oriented software metrics is proposed. This approach guides the metrics users to adopt the quality metrics model to measure the object-oriented software products. It clearly defines the <b>activities</b> <b>and</b> <b>procedure</b> of the measurement process. Before the metrics model is created, the measured entity should be specified clearly. The development of the model can be done using a top-down approach. This approach explicitly proposes the conception of absolute normalization computation and relative normalization computation for metrics model. Moreover, a generic software metrics tool - Jade Bird Object-Oriented Metrics Tool (JBOOMT) is designed to implement this approach. The parser-based approach adopted by the tool makes the source program information accurate and complete for measurement. It supports various customizable hierarchical metrics models and provides a flexible user interface for users to manipulate the models.
