60|$|One look at {{his face}} had already told Juliette what she wished to know. He had searched her room, and found the {{fragments}} of burnt paper, which she had purposely left in the <b>ash-pan.</b>|$|E
60|$|She {{gathered}} the papers {{up into a}} heap, tearing some of them up into strips; then she spread them out upon the <b>ash-pan</b> {{in front of the}} large earthenware stove, which stood {{in a corner of the}} room.|$|E
60|$|The most {{important}} work was {{to draw the}} fires, and by following Joe's example Bob so far aided in this that five minutes later the glowing coals were in the <b>ash-pan</b> or strewn on the cement flooring immediately {{in front of the}} furnace door.|$|E
60|$|In {{front of}} the figure a small lamp was kept perpetually burning. This Juliette now took between her fingers, carefully, lest the tiny flame should die out. First she poured the oil over the {{fragments}} of paper in the <b>ash-pan,</b> then with the wick she {{set fire to the}} whole compromising correspondence.|$|E
60|$|As {{she opened}} the door there was a sudden draught, and the last {{flickering}} flame died out in the <b>ash-pan.</b> Juliette, seeing that Pétronelle had gone, hastily turned over the few half burnt fragments of paper that were left. In none of them had the writing remained legible. All that was compromising to Déroulède was effectually reduced to dust. The small wick in the lamp {{at the foot of the}} Virgin and Child had burned itself out for want of oil; there was no means for Juliette to strike another light and to destroy what remained. The leather case was, of course, still there, with its sides ripped open, an indestructible thing.|$|E
6000|$|He {{replaced}} the will calmly in the desk, fastened the lock {{again with a}} delicate twirl of the pick, {{and sat down in}} his arm-chair to compose his discourse for to-morrow's evensong. [...] "It's not a bad bit of rhetoric," [...] he said to himself as he read it over for correction, [...] "but I'm not sure that I haven't plagiarized a little too freely from Montaigne and dear old Burton. What a pity it must be thrown away upon a Churnside congregation! Not a soul in the whole place will appreciate a word of it, except Christina. Well, well, that alone is enough reward for any man." [...] And he knocked off his ash pensively into the Japanese <b>ash-pan.</b>|$|E
60|$|While {{the water}} was ebbing, and the men were roaming in quest of their {{favourite}} morsel, the writer was examining {{the effects of the}} storm upon the forge and loose apparatus left upon the rock. Six large blocks of granite which had been landed, by way of experiment, on the 1st instant, were now removed from their places and, by the force of the sea, thrown over a rising ledge into a hole at the distance of twelve or fifteen paces from the place on which they had been landed. This was a pretty good evidence both of the violence of the storm and the agitation of the sea upon the rock. The safety of the smith's forge was always an object of essential regard. The <b>ash-pan</b> of the hearth or fireplace, with its weighty cast-iron back, had been washed from their places of supposed security; the chains of attachment had been broken, and these ponderous articles were found at a very considerable distance in a hole on the western side of the rock; while the tools and picks of the Aberdeen masons were scattered about in every direction. It is, however, remarkable that not a single article was ultimately lost.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} had {{a copper}} firebox, with a rocking grate with drop plates and a hopper-style <b>ash-pan.</b> The boiler {{was equipped with}} 3 in Ramsbottom safety valves, while its feedwater was supplied by two Cape pattern Gresham & Craven's no. 8 injectors. The engine was equipped with a Nathan double-sight feed cylinder lubricator, Gresham & Craven's patent steam sanding gear and one 3 in and one 4 in Star chime no. 3 whistles.|$|E
50|$|In 1963 Velinheli was {{in pieces}} in the {{railways}} workshops at Gilfach Ddu having been out of traffic since 1953 for major overhaul, a task which was never completed. Whilst the majority of this locomotive was scrapped certain items survive & are now on display within the National Slate Museum at Gilfach Ddu. Surviving items include: side tanks (complete with nameplate Velinheli on one side only), chimney, sand boxes & <b>ash-pan.</b> The identity of all these remaining parts as belonging solely to Velinheli cannot be confirmed due to the swapping of locomotive parts, a common practice during {{the operation of the}} quarries' various railway systems.|$|E
40|$|S. Zadnikov. A Complex Antique Amphoras from Pit № 6 of the <b>Ash-pan</b> № 5 of theWestern Fortifications of the Belsk’s Corodishe The article {{deals with}} the finds of the antique amphoras from the pit № 6, from the {{excavation}} of the <b>ash-pan</b> № 5 of the Western fortification of the Belsk’s gorodishe near {{to the village of}} the Kotelva’a district in the Poltava’s region. In the pit was found two amphoras. The first was protofassion and other — samian. Also in this complex was found the samples of the amphoras clasomenian, chios, lesbos.
