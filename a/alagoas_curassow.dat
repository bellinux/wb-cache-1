5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Alagoas</b> <b>curassow,</b> an {{extinct in}} wild {{species of the}} forest in Alagoas.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Alagoas</b> <b>curassow</b> is {{protected}} under Brazilian law and is listed on Appendix I of CITES.|$|E
50|$|As {{this species}} is extinct in the wild, the total {{population}} of 130 birds only persists in two separate captive populations. A reintroduction plan is being organized, though it faces challenges. Even if the population could be bred to healthy numbers, the species would need to be reintroduced into a large natural geographical area. Human expansion and overpopulation has caused nearly all of the <b>Alagoas</b> <b>curassow's</b> natural habitat to be destroyed. One potential reintroduction site has been proposed. Precautions would have to be taken in order to prevent illegal hunting of the species after reintroduction.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Alagoas</b> <b>curassow</b> became {{extinct in}} the wild due to {{deforestation}} and hunting. The last wild <b>Alagoas</b> <b>curassow</b> was seen and killed in 1984, or possibly 1987 or 1988. The captive population has been extensively hybridized with the razor-billed curassow, {{and there are several}} dozen purebred birds left. These are being maintained and bred in two privately owned professional aviaries in Brazil mainly due to lack of official interest owing to the long-standing doubt about the taxon's validity.|$|E
50|$|Due {{to their}} absence {{in the wild}} and lack of study {{previously}} conducted on these cracids before their extinction in the wild, not much is known about their breeding habits outside of captivity. <b>Alagoas</b> <b>curassow</b> females begin reproducing at about 2 years old. In captivity, they produce about 2-3 eggs each year (Harry 2006). There has been a greater genetic variability amongst the <b>Alagoas</b> <b>curassow</b> after 1990, when hybrid breeding programs were introduced; Alagoas curassows were bred with closely related razor-billed curassows (BirdLife International 2013).|$|E
50|$|The lack of {{knowledge}} about their behavior in the wild makes it difficult to know how the birds interact with other species. The impact of their introduction on interactions with other species is difficult to predict. For instance, the Chamek spider monkey also eats Clarisia racemosa, which could lead to competition with the <b>Alagoas</b> <b>curassow.</b> A lack of genetic diversity is another potential concern. Scientists have been controlling the sexual interactions within the species by pairing certain birds together in order to reduce hybridization and maintain the original <b>Alagoas</b> <b>curassow.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>Alagoas</b> <b>curassow</b> (Mitu mitu) is a glossy-black, pheasant-like bird. It was {{formerly}} found in forests in Northeastern Brazil {{in what is}} now the states of Pernambuco and Alagoas, which is the origin of its common name (Harry 2006). It is now extinct in the wild; there are about 130 individuals in captivity.|$|E
50|$|Fauna include white-lipped peccary (Tayassu pecari), red brocket (Mazama americana), South American tapir (Tapirus terrestris), red-handed howler (Alouatta belzebul), Parrot species, Amazonian manatee (Trichechus inunguis), jaguar (Panthera onca), {{black caiman}} (Melanosuchus niger), <b>Alagoas</b> <b>curassow</b> (Mitu mitu), Piping guan (Pipile nateri), Crypturellus species and fish such as Arapaima gigas, tambaqui (Colossoma macropomum) and silver arowana (Osteoglossum bicirrhosum).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Alagoas</b> <b>curassow</b> {{is known}} to consume a diet of fruits and nuts. Although not much {{information}} is known about this species' interactions and behavior in the wild, the stomach contents of these birds were found to contain fruits specifically from the castelo tree. It has also been said that they enjoy fruits from the plant Clarisia racemosa. Generally, the female birds weigh less than the males and lay about 8-10 eggs a year. The average lifespan in captivity is about 24 years.|$|E
50|$|The razor-billed curassow (Mitu tuberosum) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Cracidae. It is found {{throughout}} {{a large part of}} the Amazon Rainforest, though largely restricted to regions south of the Amazon River. Unlike other members of the genus Mitu, its crissum (the area around the cloaca) is deep chestnut and the tail-tip is white. The razor-billed curassow was formerly treated as a subspecies of Mitu mitu, but today this scientific name is restricted to the extremely rare <b>Alagoas</b> <b>curassow.</b>|$|E
50|$|German naturalist Georg Marcgrave first {{identified}} the <b>Alagoas</b> <b>curassow</b> in 1648 in its native range. Subsequently, {{the origin and}} legitimacy of the bird began to be questioned {{due to the lack}} of specimens. An adult female curassow was rediscovered in 1951, in the coastal forests of Alagoas. The Mitu mitu was then accepted as a separate species (Silveira). At that time fewer than 60 birds were left in the wild, in the forests around São Miguel dos Campos. Several authors in the 1970s brought to light the growing destruction of its habitat and the rarity of the species. Even with these concerns, the last large forest remnants which contained native Mitu mitu were demolished for sugarcane agriculture (Silveira).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Alagoas</b> <b>curassow</b> {{was first}} {{mentioned}} by German naturalist Georg Marcgrave {{in his work}} Historia Naturalis Brasiliae {{which was published in}} 1648. Because of the lack of information and specimens, it was considered conspecific with the common razor-billed curassow, until its rediscovery in 1951 in the Alagoas lowland forests, Brazil. Following the review of Pereira & Baker (2004), they are today believed to be a fairly basal lineage of its genus, related to the crestless curassow, the other Mitu species with brown eumelanin in the tail tip. Its lineage has been distinct since the Miocene-Pliocene boundary (approximately 5 million years ago), when it became isolated in refugia in the Atlantic Forest (Pereira & Baker 2004).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Alagoas</b> <b>curassow</b> {{measures}} approximately 83 - 89 cm in length. Feathers covering {{its body}} {{are black and}} glossy, with a blue-purple hue (BirdLife International 2013). Specimens of Mitu mitu also has a large, bright red beak, flattened at its sides, with a white tip. The same red coloration on found on its legs and feet. The tips of its tail feathers are light brown in color, with chestnut colored feathers under the tail. It has a unique grey colored, crescent-shaped patch of bare skin covering its ears, a character not found in other curassows (Harry 2006). The distinct coloration separates M.mitu as its own species distinct from other curassow species. Sexual dimorphism is not pronounced: females tend to be lighter in color and slightly smaller in size (Sick 1980). The birds can live to more than twenty four years in captivity (The Website of Everything 2010). Video recording in captivity show that this cracid sporadically makes a high-pitched chirping sound, as seen here.|$|E
40|$|The {{conservation}} of many endangered taxa relies on hybrid identification, and when hybrids become morphologically {{indistinguishable from the}} parental species, the use of molecular markers can assign individual admixture levels. Here, we present the puzzling case of the extinct in the wild <b>Alagoas</b> <b>Curassow</b> (Pauxi mitu), whose captive population descends from only three individuals. Hybridization with the Razor-billed Curassow (P. tuberosa) began more than eight generations ago, and admixture uncertainty affects the whole population. We applied an analysis framework that combined morphological diagnostic traits, Bayesian clustering analyses using 14 microsatellite loci, and mtDNA haplotypes to assess the ancestry of all individuals that were alive from 2008 to 2012. Simulated data revealed that our microsatellites could accurately assign an individual a hybrid origin until the second backcross generation, which permitted us to identify a pure group among the older, but still reproductive animals. No wild species has ever survived such a severe bottleneck, followed by hybridization, and studying the recovery capability of the selected pure <b>Alagoas</b> <b>Curassow</b> group might provide valuable insights into biological conservation theory...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Alagoas</b> <b>Curassow</b> Mitu mitu is {{considered}} extinct in the wild. Since 1979, two females and a male {{caught in the}} wild have bred successfully in captivity, and, in 1990, hybridizations between M. mitu and Razor-billed Mitu M. tuberosum were performed. By June 2008, there were around 130 living birds in two different aviaries. We sequenced two regions of the mitochondrial DNA of both captive stocks of Alagoas Curassows. We unequivocally identified hybrids that have haplotype typical of M. tuberosum. However, unless the original studbook can be recovered there is no confident way to discriminate ""pure"" M. mitu birds for breeding and reintroduction purposes. Allied with morphological data gathered in an independent study, we suggest that conservation actions {{need to focus on}} specimens with diagnostic phenotypic characters of M. mitu, and avoid birds with mitochondria, genetic contribution of M. tuberosum. Although we have detected low levels of genetic variability among captive birds, the steady increase of the captive population suggests that inbreeding depression and hybridization are not a reproductive hindrance. Reintroduction of some of these potential hybrid birds in the original area of occurrence of the <b>Alagoas</b> <b>Curassow</b> may be the only hope to fill in the ecological niche left vacant. An educational program involving local communities to conserve future reintroduction of curassows and their restored habitat is highly recommended. Accepted 12 November 2009.

40|$|Birds of the Cracidae family (curassows, guans, and chachalacas) are endemic of the Neotropics and 50 {{species are}} {{currently}} classified. Brazil has 22 species, seven {{of which are}} considered threatened. The <b>Alagoas</b> <b>Curassow</b> (Pauxi mitu) species is considered extinct in the wild; but about 120 birds are alive in captivity. Conservation of this species depends entirely on correct management. Health reports of both wildlife and captive curassows are rare. In this study the presence of Escherichia coli was evaluated in 23 healthy Alagoas Curassows from two private breeding centres. E. coli was isolated from cloacal swabs, {{and the presence of}} genes encoding cytotoxic necrotising factor 1 (cnf 1), alpha-haemolysin (hly), aerobactin (iuc), serum resistance (iss) and the following adhesions: S fimbriae (sfa), pili associated with pyelonephritis (pap) and temperature-sensitive haemagglutinin (tsh) were investigated. E. coli was isolated from 78. 3 % (18 / 23) of the birds, and the percentage of curassows colonized by E. coli was similar between the two facilities. From the 22 E. coli isolates, 15 (68. 2 %) were positive for at least one virulence factor by PCR, and the most frequently found gene was iss (50 %). No curassows had clinical signs of disease. Nevertheless, the presence of some E. coli strains may be a concern to the wildlife in captivity. Additional health surveillance studies are essential to guarantee successful conservation programmes for threatened cracids in Brazil...|$|E
