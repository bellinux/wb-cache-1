5|$|Sweden {{had just}} lost one third of its population, as Russia had conquered the eastern part and created the Grand Duchy of Finland out of it during the Finnish War in 1808–1809. Shortly after, in 1814, the west flank had been secured by the {{personal}} union with Norway, and after the Napoleonic Wars, the former main enemy of Sweden in the south, Denmark, was no longer any threat. The only threat left was Russia, which now stood {{just across the border}} in the north, and had possession of the Åland Islands less than 150km from the Swedish capital Stockholm. The Swedish Navy was considered superior to the Russian in the Gulf of Bothnia, so a seaborne invasion against the coast of Norrland was not likely. <b>And</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>the</b> Russians had invaded northern Sweden via Finland in the previous war, the general opinion was that in case of a new war, their main attack would be conducted towards Stockholm and southern Sweden.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} North American auto market, by 2007 Canada had {{available}} 51 {{models of}} E85 flex-vehicles, most from Chrysler, Ford and General Motors, including automobiles, pickup trucks, and SUVs. The country had around 1.6million capable flex fuel E85s on the roads by 2014. However, most users are not aware they own an E85, as vehicles are not clearly labeled as such, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>the</b> newer models have a yellow cap in the fuel tank informing that the vehicle can handle E85, most users are still not aware because there are hardly any gas stations offering E85. Another major restriction for greater E85 fuel use {{is the fact that}} by June 2008 Canada had only three public E85 pumps, all located in Ontario, in the cities of Guelph, Chatham, and Woodstock. E85 fueling is available primarily for fleet vehicles, including 20 government refueling stations not available for the public. The main feedstocks for E85 production in Canada are corn and wheat, and there were several proposals being discussed to increase the actual use of E85 fuel in FFVs, such as creating an ethanol-friendly highway or ethanol corridor.|$|E
25|$|Zoeterwoude-Dorp {{is a town}} in the Dutch {{province}} of South Holland. It {{is a part of}} the municipality of Zoeterwoude, and lies about 3.5km south of Leiden.

25|$|Constantinople {{never really}} {{recovered}} from its sack during the Fourth Crusade <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>the</b> Byzantine Empire survived until 1453, by that time, the Hippodrome {{had fallen into}} ruin. The Ottoman Turks, who captured the city in 1453 and made it {{the capital of the}} Ottoman Empire, were not interested in racing and the Hippodrome was gradually forgotten, although the site was never actually built over.|$|E
25|$|The Swedish {{economic}} {{picture has}} brightened significantly since the severe {{recession in the}} early 1990s. Growth has been strong in recent years, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>the</b> growth in the economy slackened between 2001 and 2003, the growth rate has picked up since with an average growth rate of 3.7% {{in the last three}} years. The long-run prospects for growth remain favorable. The inflation rate is low and stable, with projections for continued low levels over the next 2–3 years.|$|E

Additionally, the Red Army {{played a crucial role}} in the Spanish Civil War, supplying over 1,000 aircraft, 900 tanks, 1,500 artillery pieces, 300 armored cars, hundreds of thousands of small arms and 30,000 tons of ammunition to the Republican cause.|$|E
25|$|India {{experiences}} large capital inflows every day, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>the</b> OMO and the LAF {{policies were}} able to withhold the inflows, another instrument was {{needed to keep the}} liquidity intact.

The LAF and the OMO’s were dealing with day-to-day liquidity management, whereas the MSS was set up to sterilize the liquidity absorption and make it more enduring.|$|E

During the next 30 years, Lyn was swiftly relegated and promoted between the first and the third tier and the club was never playing in the top division for more than three consecutive seasons. During this period the fan base eroded and Lyn is said to have lost a generation of supporters.|$|E

25|$|Although AMPKalpha2 {{activation}} {{has been}} {{thought to be}} important for mitochondrial adaptations to exercise training, a recent study investigating the response to exercise training in AMPKa2 knockout mice opposes this idea. Their study compared the response to exercise training of several proteins and enzymes in wild type and AMPKalpha2 knockout mice. <b>And</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>the</b> knockout mice had lower basal markers of mitochondrial density (COX-1, CS, and HAD), these markers increased similarly to the wild type mice after exercise training. These findings are supported by another study also showing no difference in mitochondrial adaptations to exercise training between wild type and knockout mice.|$|E
25|$|The English {{government}} {{handled the}} crisis well, {{and the country}} did not experience the extreme reactions that were seen elsewhere in Europe. The most immediate consequence was {{a halt to the}} campaigns of the Hundred Years' War. In the long term, the decrease in population caused a shortage of labour, with subsequent rise in wages, resisted by the landowners, which caused deep resentment among the lower classes. The Peasants' Revolt of 1381 was largely a result of this resentment, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>the</b> rebellion was suppressed, in the long term serfdom was ended in England. The Black Death also affected artistic and cultural efforts, and may have helped advance the use of the vernacular.|$|E
25|$|Xu {{maintained}} its dominance over the southeast after King Mu's death, while the armistice proved inadequate to ensure peace. The military contest between the Huaiyi and Zhou kingdom never really stopped, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>the</b> latter increasingly suffered from internal disorder and even chaos, it remained a formidable adversary for Xu's confederation. King Li of Zhou (857-842/28) led several campaigns against {{the states of}} the Huai River, such as Jiao and Yu. In turn, the Huaiyi confederation under Xu began a massive counter offensive in 850 BC, aiming to conquer the North China Plain and to destroy the Zhou rule over the East. Allied with Ehou, rebellious ruler of E, and the Dongyi states, the Huaiyi brought the Zhou dynasty to the brink of destruction. Their forces even reached the Luo and Yi River valleys, threatening or even plundering the dynasty's royal domain. Eventually, however, the anti-Zhou alliance collapsed after the destruction of E by Zhou loyalists, and Xu was driven back.|$|E

25|$|Thus, {{in several}} cases, the Court found the alleged error too insubstantial to {{consider}} via original habeas. In Ex parte Parks (1876), the Court held {{that it had}} no original habeas jurisdiction to free a defendant convicted in a United States district court, even though no appeal was possible from the district court to the circuit court, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>the</b> petitioner alleged that the district court had been entirely without jurisdiction to try the offense charged. Similarly, in Ex parte Rowland (1881), the Court held {{that it had no}} original habeas jurisdiction to examine a contempt of court conviction arising from the disregard of a writ of mandamus. And, in Ex parte Bigelow (1885), the Court held that there could be no review of a double jeopardy determination of the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. In Ex parte Harding (1887), the Court held that the composition of a grand jury (i.e. whether an alien sat) could not be so reviewed.|$|E
25|$|One {{case where}} {{this issue was}} treated was Hasbro Bradley, Inc. v. Sparkle Toys, Inc. (780 F.2d 189 (2d Cir 1985)). Hasbro was distributing Japanese toys (action figures) in the U.S. under an {{exclusive}} license and claimed copyright on these toys. Sparkle Toys distributed exact copies of these toy figures. In the case, Sparkle contested Hasbro's copyright claims. In this pre-Berne case, the court arrived at the conclusion that Hasbro was entitled to copyright on the figurines although these toys of Japanese origin were not copyrighted at all in Japan, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>the</b> toys did not bear a copyright notice. The case has been criticized in 2000 by William F. Patry, who expressed the opinion that the Judge mistakenly arrived at {{the conclusion that the}} U.S. was required to grant copyright on these toys. Patry also concedes that under the Berne Convention, the U.S. would indeed be required to grant copyright to foreign works, even if such works were not copyrighted in their country of origin as per article 5(2) of the Berne Convention.|$|E
