The objectives of this survey were aimed at providing data on the specific requirements for preventive and curative services in different localities in Malta, to obtain objective data which can be used in evaluating the effectiveness of existing dental programmes in eliminating the hazards to dental and general health, to provide guidelines for national action to develop child dental health services, to serve as a pilot study for the continuous collection of information needed by governments to evaluate child dental health services. peer-reviewe...|$|R

The Property Investment Company offered the stockholders of the Kenton Development Company a chance to redeem the mortgage, but it was not accepted.

40|$|In {{this article}} I develop {{a model of}} an {{infinitely}} repeated procurement auction with one buyer and several sellers. The buyer can <b>accumulate</b> a <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> unfilled orders which, similar to a boom in demand, forces the sellers t o collude on a low price to prevent undercutting. If the buyer's cost of shifting its consumption over time is low enough, then the extent of collusion is bounded away from the joint-profit-maximizing level even for discount factors approaching one. The model is extended to allow for multiple buyers. Large buyers are shown to obtain lower prices from the sellers. Buyer mergers increase profit for all buyers, not just the merging pair, {{at the expense of}} the sellers. In contrast, buyer growth through addition harms buyers that do not grow and benefits sellers. ...|$|R
5000|$|Ninety {{percent of}} the water which passes through the Canal {{originates}} as industrial outflow or stormwater overflow. Historic contamination by polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycylclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals has put the canal under the EPA's Grand Calumet River Area of Concern (AoC)—the only AoC to be listed impaired in all 14 beneficial use categories. Because of this sediment contamination, no dredging {{has taken place in}} the harbor since 1972, when the USEPA determined the previous sediment disposal method of open water disposal in Lake Michigan to be unacceptable. [...] Lacking any alternative disposal location, the harbor and canal have <b>accumulated</b> a <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> approximately [...] of sediment, which hinders deep draft commercial navigation. [...] Shipping capacity has been reduced by 15%, increasing shipping costs. The contaminated sediment also leads to further pollution of Lake Michigan, as sediments containing 67,000 pounds (30,000 kg) of chromium, 100,000 pounds (45,000 kg) of lead, and 420 pounds (190 kg) of PCBs reach the lake each year through the waterway.|$|R

During August 1988, ATR's {{marketing}} efforts in the lucrative North American market resulted in the securing of a large order of 50 ATR-300s from US operator Texas Air Corporation; that same year, another American regional carrier, Trans World Express, received the 100th production aircraft. On 1 July 1989, ATR opened their new global training centre for the type in Toulouse, which provided centralised and modern facilities for the training to airline staff and other personnel across the world. During June 1999, the ATR global training center {{became one of the}} first European institutions to be recognised as a Type Rating Training Organization (TRTO), as defined by the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA).|$|R
40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Social Security Administration (SSA) reported in January 2014 that it is behind schedule in assessing the continued eligibility of recipients in its two disability programs, Disability Insurance (DI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI),and has <b>accumulated</b> a <b>backlog</b> <b>of</b> 1. 3 million continuing disability reviews (CDRs). From fiscal years 2000 to 2011, the numbers of adult and child CDRs conducted fell about 70 percent. Children make up about one fifth of all SSI recipients, and GAO reported in 2012 that many of their CDRs were overdue. For example, more than 24, 000 CDRs for children with mental impairments were overdue by 6 or more years, including over 6, 000 CDRs for children who were expected to medically improve within 6 to 18 months of their initial determination. GAO also identified several cases which exceeded their scheduled review date by 13 years or more. When CDRs are not conducted as scheduled, the potential for improper payments increases as some recipients receive benefits {{for which they are}} no longer eligible. In September 2011, SSA's Office of the Inspector General estimated that SSA had paid about $ 1. 4 billion in SSI benefits to children who should have not received them. SSA attributes delays in performing CDRs to resource limitations and other factors; SSA also generally gives lower priority to conducting CDRs for children receiving SSI. In 2012, GAO recommended that SSA eliminate the existing CDR backlog for children with impairments who are likely to improve, and regularly conduct reviews for this group. While SSA generally agreed with GAO's recommendation, the CDR backlog remains. ...|$|R
