50|$|For {{controlling}} secondary efflorescence, admixtures containing aqueous-based {{calcium stearate}} dispersion (CSD) are often added {{at a later}} stage of the batching process with the mix water. In a typical batching process, sand is first charged into the mixer, then the oil-based primary anti-efflorescence admixture is added with constant mixing to allow the oil to coat the sand. Then coarse aggregates, colorants, and cement are added, followed by water. If CSD is used, it is then introduced usually at this point during or after {{the addition of the}} mix water. CSD is an <b>aqueous</b> <b>dispersion</b> wherein fine solid particles of calcium stearate are suspended in the water uniformly.

Upon heating, <b>aqueous</b> <b>dispersions</b> of dried samples of the short- and medium-chain homologues (n or = 18) first exhibit a transition from a dehydrated solid form to the hydrated L beta gel phase followed by the gel-liquid-crystalline phase transition normally observed with fully hydrated samples.

In addition, at still higher temperatures, the longer chain members of this series (n > or = 16) exhibit weakly energetic transitions from the lamellar phase to an inverted nonlamellar phase. Upon appropriate incubation at low temperatures, <b>aqueous</b> <b>dispersions</b> of the shorter chain members of this homologous series (n < or = 16) form a highly ordered crystal-like phase that, upon heating, converts directly to the liquid-crystalline phase at the same temperature as do the <b>aqueous</b> <b>dispersions</b> of the dried lipid.
