40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{constellation}} phasing maintenance for satellites of different designs and launched separately from different launchers. Because {{of the difference}} of designs, the satellites have different ballistic drag characteristics. Due to the different launches, the satellites will not be likely on the same orbit plane. These factors cause the orbit phasing control to be demanding. With consideration of cost reduction and hardware availability, satellites may use the low efficient gas nitrogen propulsion subsystem. The capacity of fuel is limited for the satellite mass constraint, thus, leading to the minimization of fuel consumption to be critical. This paper presents the orbit control algorithms, named as Wait-and-Hit, for minimizing fuel use in the constellation rephrasing and phasing maintenance. The <b>Argo</b> <b>satellite</b> system is presented to demonstrate this concept. The study shows the significant reduction of the fuel consumption can be achieved. Furthermore, the orbit phasing operations can be much simplified without the needs of high accurate orbit determination and control.

40|$|This article {{describes}} the <b>ARGO</b> <b>Satellite</b> Seismic Network (<b>ARGO</b> SSN) as a reliable system for monitoring, collection, visualisation and analysis of seismic and geophysical low-frequency data, The satellite digital telemetry system is composed of peripheral geophysical stations, a centraI communications node (master sta- tion) located in CentraI Italy, and a data collection and processing centre located at ING (Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica), Rome. The task of the peripheral stations is to digitalise and send via satellite the geophysical data collected by the various sensors to the master station. The master station receives the data and forwards them via satellite to the ING in Rome; it also performs alI the monitoring functions of satellite communications. At the data collection and processing centre of ING, the data are received and analysed in real time, the seismic events are identified and recorded, the low-frequency geophysical data are stored. In addition, the generaI sta- tus of the satellite network and of each peripheral station connected, is monitored.

40|$|We {{describe}} a generalization of the Bernoulli inverse method, which produces {{an estimate of}} Sea Surface Height (SSH) across the region of interest rather than simply at station positions. Real-time ‘float’ observations and satellite altimetry measurements are used to map a ‘sea surface elevation’ to study the large-scale ocean circulation in the North Atlantic. The inverse {{has been applied to}} simulated <b>Argo</b> floats and <b>satellite</b> altimetry tracks in the Ocean Circulation and climate model (OCCAM). The Bernoulli inverse method predicts the SSH by finding geostrophic streamlines along which the Bernoulli function is conserved. These streamlines are defined where modified potential temperature and salinity are conserved. This predicted SSH is combined with that measured by the satellite altimetry. The revised method uses linear regression to give a surface solution for the region rather than solving the function at fixed positions, hence increasing the resolution of the problem by combining the altimetry measurements for the region. We will present results of a comparison study where real-time <b>Argo</b> and <b>satellite</b> altimetry have been used in combination with OCCAM using the same method to see how robust the solutions are for the NorthAtlantic.

40|$|The 1999 Ocean Observing System conference {{recommended}} that the Low density (LD) expendable bathythermograph (XBT) network be discontinued contingent on the completion of studies showing that the global <b>Argo</b> network and/or <b>satellite</b> altimetry can provide equivalent information. Herein, information content in North Atlantic LD lines relative to quasi-decadal variability in upper layer temperature structure is addressed {{as the first step}} in achieving this recommendation. Two LD lines are located in the subpolar gyre and support results from previous studies of shorter length that ocean advection and not only air–sea fluxes plays an important role, particularly in the eastern gyre, in determining the characteristics of the water masses transported to the source regions of North Atlantic Deep Water. Several sections cross the Gulf Stream and Labrador Current. They provide evidence to support the hypothesis that changes in the intensity of Labrador Current properties cause meridional motions of the Gulf Stream. Decadal variability in the subtropical gyre of the North Atlantic has been attributed to westward propagation of temperature anomalies by the mean currents and planetary waves. Modeling studies suggest that these signals are dominant in the thermocline at the northern latitudes (order 30 °) of the subtropical gyre. Similar calculations from a line crossing the subtropical gyre at these same latitudes shows no indication of westward propagation. Quasi-decadal signals in upper layer temperature are coincident across the entire gyre with some suggestion of eastward motion of temperature anomalies. One line on the southern boundary of the subtropical gyre does include westward signal movement from the eastern boundary. Based on the information content of individual lines, recommendations are made relative to the continuation of specific transects until it has been demonstrated that <b>Argo</b> and <b>satellite</b> altimetry can provide equivalent results...|$|R
40|$|An {{analysis}} is presented for the spatial and intensity distributions of North Atlantic extreme atmospheric events crossing the buoyant Amazon-Orinoco freshwater plume. The sea surface cooling amplitude {{in the wake}} of an ensemble of storm tracks traveling in that region is estimated from satellite products for the period 1998 - 2012. For the most intense storms, cooling is systematically reduced by approximate to 50 % over the plume area compared to surroundings open-ocean waters. Historical salinity and temperature observations from in situ profiles indicate that salt-driven vertical stratification, enhanced oceanic heat content, and barrier-layer presence within the plume waters are likely key oceanic factors to explain these results. Satellite SMOS surface salinity data combined with in situ observations are further used to detail the oceanic response to category 4 hurricane Igor in 2010. <b>Argo</b> and <b>satellite</b> measurements confirm the haline stratification impact on the cooling inhibition as the hurricane crossed the river plume. Over this region, the SSS mapping capability is further tested and demonstrated to monitor the horizontal distribution of the vertical stratification parameter.

During the negative IOD events in 2010, 2013, and 2014, westerly wind anomalies strengthened along the equator, weakening coastal upwelling off Java and Sumatra and decreasing SSS. South of the equatorial IO, an anomalous cyclonic gyre changed the tropical circulation, which favored the eastward high-salinity tongue along the equator and the westward low-saline tongue in the south. An upwelling Rossby wave favored the increase of SSS farther to the south.

40|$|This study {{concerns}} the combined effects of Earth’s rotation and stabilizing surface buoyancy flux upon the wind-induced turbulent mixing {{in the surface}} layer. Two different length scales, the Garwood scale and Zilitinkevich scale, have been proposed for the stabilized mixing layer depth under Earth’s rotation. Here, this study analyzes observed mixed layer depth plus surface momentum and buoyancy fluxes obtained from <b>Argo</b> floats and <b>satellites,</b> finding that the Zilitinkevich scale is more suited for observed mixed layer depths than the Garwood scale. Large-eddy simulations (LESs) reproduce this observed feature, except under a weak stabilizing flux where the mixed layer depth could not be identified with the buoyancy threshold method (because of insufficient buoyancy difference across the mixed layer base). LESs, however, show that the mixed layer depth if defined with buoyancy ratio relative to its surface value follows the Zilitinkevich scale even under such a weak stabilizing flux. LESs also show that the mixing layer depth is in good agreement with the Zilitinkevich scale. These findings will contribute to {{better understanding of the}} response of stabilized mixing/mixed layer depth to surface forcings and hence better estimation/prediction of several processes related to stabilized mixing/mixed layer depth such as air–sea interaction, subduction of surface mixed layer water, and spring blooming of phytoplankton biomass...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} document observations, statistics, and physical processes relating to warm, salty mesoscale anticyclonic eddies in the Irminger Sea {{and their impact}} on the properties of the region. Anticyclones are studied with a variety of platforms including a mooring, a glider, <b>Argo</b> floats, <b>satellite</b> altimetry, and a regional model. They are found to be widespread throughout the central Irminger gyre, and are similar to anticyclones documented in the neighboring Labrador Sea and Lofoten Basin. Two anticyclone formation regions are found along the boundary current, producing two size classes of anticylones. Over the period between 2002 and 2009, anticyclone transport makes an important contribution to the heat and salt budgets of the gyre upper (< 460 m) layer. Along with surface fluxes, they dominate the heat and salt balance on this time scale. The eddy contribution is relatively steady over the 7 -year period and presumably over longer timescales as well. Changes in the temperature and salinity in the central gyre can be explained by anomalies in surface forcing. Over yearly time scales, the eddy contribution plays a minimal role in the heat and salt budgets, and the dominant terms include surface forcing and non-eddy horizontal advection. The assumption was made that anticyclones decay in the basin interior, motivated by the observed absence of eddies in the winter, and we explore the hypothesis that winter mixing can lead to eddy decay. To study this, a 1 D mixing model is used to show that the barotropic component of velocity can be weakened during a period of sustained surface heat loss, with little change in the baroclinic component. This can push the eddy toward a counter-rotating state, which has been shown by theoretical studies to be unstable for similar anticyclonic vortices, and may thus be a mechanism for eddy decay. Observations of anticyclones are compared to a 1 / 20 degree resolution regional model (VIKING 20). The model reproduces many features of the circulation and water masses, and similar salty anticyclones as observed. However, it cannot resolve the smallest eddies that we detected, and the long-term evolution of the eddies in the model appears to be dominated by numerical diffusivity and viscosity. Therefore, the model cannot be used for studying the processes of eddy deca...|$|R
40|$|The {{large-scale}} ocean circulation, dynamics, and air-sea exchanges are investigated, {{based on}} observational datasets including <b>Argo</b> and <b>satellite</b> altimetry, and {{viewed in the}} framework of modern theoretical ideas. Initially, the wind-driven interannual variability of the subtropical North Pacific is described. Using the extensive Argo dataset, it is seen that the North Pacific gyre varies in the strength of its interior circulation and in its spatial orientation, on interannual timescales. Also, satellite altimetry shows variations in sea surface height that are consistent with Argo steric height changes, and enabled a temporal extension of the 2004 - 2011 Argo study back to 1993. The next part of the thesis is focused on annual steric variability, including diabatic changes in the surface layer due to air-sea buoyancy fluxes and adiabatic changes due to wind-forced advection, which are dominant in the subsurface ocean. The annual signal in subsurface (200 - 2000 db) steric height zonally averaged over a season shows good agreement with the wind-forced vertical advection contribution, both in the global ocean and in different basins. This study, the first on global scale, also shows that the annual vertical advection extends deep into the water column. Next, the global pattern of climatological monthly heat and freshwater fluxes at the ocean surface is estimated using Argo temperature and salinity profile data for the period 2004 to 2013. The air-sea flux estimates from Argo are described in global maps and basin-wide integrals, in comparison to atmospheric reanalysis data and to air-sea flux products based on observations. This ocean-based estimate of surface fluxes is consistent with property variations in the subsurface ocean and indicates greater amplitude for the climatological monthly heat flux values in the subtropics compared to other products. Similarly, the combination of Argo freshwater flux and reanalysis evaporation, suggests greater amplitude for climatological monthly precipitation in the tropics. Finally, this thesis describes the mean field of the North Pacific subtropical gyre using Argo T/S and trajectory data. The gyre is deeper than 1975 db and than the densest ventilated isopycnal, and it is deepest in the northwest subtropics. In the east, its axis tilts northeast with increasing pressur...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe Malvinas Current (MC) is an {{offshoot}} of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC). Downstream of Drake Passage, the northern fronts of the ACC veer northward, cross over the North Scotia Ridge (NSR) and the Malvinas Plateau, and enter the Argentine Basin. We investigate the variations of the MC circulation between the NSR and 41 °S and their possible relations with the ACC circulation using data from <b>Argo</b> floats and <b>satellite</b> altimetry. The data depict meandering and eddy shedding of the northern ACC jets as they cross the NSR. The altimetry fields show that these eddies are trapped, break down, and dissipate over the Malvinas Plateau, suggesting that this region is a hot spot for dissipation of mesoscale variability. Variations of sea level anomalies (SLA) across the NSR do not impact the MC further north, except for intra-seasonal variability associated with coastal trapped waves. Altimetry and float trajectories show events during which a large fraction of the MC is cut off from the ACC. Blocking events at around 48. 5 °S are a recurrent feature of the MC circulation. Over the 23 year altimetry record, we detected 26 events during which the MC surface transport at 48. 5 °S was reduced to less than half its long-term mean.

40|$|The {{temporal}} and spatial variability of Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) is investigated using a compilation of several observational data sets: hydrography, XBTs, <b>Argo</b> profiles, <b>satellite</b> altimetry, and a climatology. The subduction and export of SAMW {{as part of the}} overturning circulation {{play an important role in}} global heat, freshwater, carbon and nutrient budgets. Determining the formation, circulation, and variability of SAMW is therefore an important step towards understandmg the Southern Ocean's role in climate variability and change. The spatial distribution of SAMW properties and export paths is investigated. SAMW is identified by a dynamical tracer: a minimum in potential vorticity. SAMW consists of several modes with distinct properties rather than a continuous water mass with properties that gradually evolve towards the eastern region of the Southern Ocean as previously believed. (Modified) Montgomery streamlines on the density surfaces corresponding with potential vorticity (PV) minima are used to determine the circulation paths of SAMW. The different SAMW modes are injected into the ocean interior at "hot spots" north of the Subantarctic Front (SAF), and then follow narrow export pathways into the subtropical gyres. We have also investigated the temporal variability of SAMW in the formation region, south of Australia. SAMW properties show high intra- and inter-annual variability, but no evidence of a trend over the 17 -yr mean temperature record studied (1991 - 2007). Abrupt changes in temperature and salmity at the SAMW core are related to cross-frontal advection of cool and fresh surface water through eddies and meanders from the SAF, and warm and salty water originating from the East Australian Current in the north. In addition, the SAMW pool on a single section often consists of two or more modes with distinct temperature, salinity and vertical homogeneity characteristics, but similar density. The main features of the regional circulation and the physical drivers of the east/west contrast in biomass concentration in the Subantarctic Zone (SAZ) south of Tasmania have been identified. Enhanced input of subtropical water high in micronutrients (such as iron) in the east likely supports the higher surface biomass observed there. The physical processes shown to be responsible for maintaining the east/west contrast south of Tasmama (e. g., regional circulation, eddies and subsurface salinity intrusions) are likely to drive variability in physical and biogeochemical properties of SAMW, Antarctic Intermediate Water and the SAZ elsewhere m the Southern Ocean. These results have revealed the spatial and temporal variability of SAMW in greater detail than was possible due to lack of data. Different modes of SAMW are formed in each ocean basin. Ventilation "windows" revealed by the PV distribution show hot spots where SAMW subducts. The export of warmer, saltier modes in these "hot spots" contnbutes to the circumpolar evolution of mode water properties towards cooler, fresher and denser modes in the east. We also found that mesoscale features strongly influence SAMW variability south of Tasmania, and are likely to be important in settmg SAMW properties in other regions with high eddy kinetic energy...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a review}} about the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), its mean structure, {{temporal}} variability, controlling mechanisms, and {{role in the}} coupled climate system. The AMOC plays {{a central role in}} climate through its heat and freshwater transports. Northward ocean heat transport achieved by the AMOC is responsible for the relative warmth of the Northern Hemisphere compared to the Southern Hemisphere and is thought {{to play a role in}} setting the mean position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone north of the equator. The AMOC is a key means by which heat anomalies are sequestered into the ocean's interior and thus modulates the trajectory of climate change. Fluctuations in the AMOC have been linked to low-frequency variability of Atlantic sea surface temperatures with a host of implications for climate variability over surrounding landmasses. On intra-annual timescales, variability in AMOC is large and primarily reflects the response to local wind forcing; meridional coherence of anomalies is limited to that of the wind field. On interannual to decadal timescales, AMOC changes are primarily geostrophic and related to buoyancy anomalies on the western boundary. A pacemaker region for decadal AMOC changes is located in a western “transition zone” along the boundary between the subtropical and subpolar gyres. Decadal AMOC anomalies are communicated meridionally from this region. AMOC observations, as well as the expanded ocean observational network provided by the <b>Argo</b> array and <b>satellite</b> altimetry, are inspiring efforts to develop decadal predictability systems using coupled atmosphere-ocean models initialized by ocean data.
