40|$|ABSTRACT: Photovoltaic (PV) {{systems have}} caused {{residential}} and commercial building fires when an electrical arc fault initiates in the conduction path. Article 690. 11 in the United States 2011 National Electrical Code requires new photovoltaic systems on or penetrating a building to include a listed <b>arc</b> <b>fault</b> <b>protection</b> device to prevent additional fires. In response, manufacturers are creating arc fault circuit interrupters (AFCIs) using electrical frequencies for detection, but their operation is not fully characterized. Sandia National Labs has undergone a major effort to identify detection difficulties and establish tests for PV AFCI manufacturers to ensure their product can robustly detect arcing conditions while avoiding false trips from noise sources. In previous studies, arc fault signatures have been compared to string noise and frequency-dependant attenuation through PV modules has been quantified. In this paper, a frequency response analyzer {{was used to measure}} radio frequency (RF) propagation through arrays of varying irradiance and size. Irradiance did not affect module frequency response, but the length of unshielded wiring significantly affected the frequency response of the system above 100 kHz due to RF effects. Based on the RF affects in PV systems, it is recommended that arc fault circuit interrupter manufacturers select detection frequencies below 100 kHz...|$|E

40|$|Protection from {{electric}} power hazardous {{has been used}} ever since applications of electricity were discovered. Hazards in the electric system {{can be in the}} form of over voltage or over current leading to catastrophic system and equipment failure, resulting in physical damage or even to human fatalities. Electrical protection is achieved by installing protection devices throughout distribution system to isolate faulty branches and mitigate fault development. Fire is a principal cause of buildings damages and related personal injuries. A major contributor to buildings’ fire originates from electrical <b>arc</b> <b>faults</b> caused by electric distribution equipment and appliances failures. To remedy this problem, regulatory bodies required electric <b>arc</b> <b>faults</b> <b>protection.</b> Over the years this requirement was enforced by different electric codes and expanded to cover most of residential building areas and all living spaces. <b>Arc</b> <b>fault</b> circuit interrupters (AFCI) are devised to complement existing protection methodologies and devices, focusing on electric arc detection and preventions of subsequent risks, mainly fire ignition. Circuit interruption occurs whenever characteristics of arc failure is detected, either from current, voltage or electromagnetic radiation. Detecting the <b>arc</b> <b>faults,</b> and hence increasing the reliability of interruption, is a challenge, given that some household appliances produce arc-like behaviors in normal operating conditions, like electronic light dimmers and solid state controlled variable speed drives. This research focuses on developing an intelligent low voltage series arcing detection scheme based on pattern recognition, with immunity to false tripping. This point is the main drawback of most published work and issued patents on arc detection to date, mainly due to the difficulty of modelling such a transient behavior, especially on low current arc cases. Real data is generated in lab simulating series arc conditions at different combinations of linear and non-linear loads. Appliances current are recorded as well. Two disjoint datasets are used for training and testing of the proposed system with no components shared between the two datasets to verify classifier generality. The proposed pattern recognition method proved to be highly immune to false tripping in line with benchmark regulatory standard, and can be adapted to similar hard to model non-stationary problems...|$|R
40|$|Islanded operation, protection, {{reclosing}} and {{arc extinguishing}} {{are some of}} the challenging issues related to the connection of converter interfaced distributed generators (DGs) into a distribution network. The isolation of upstream faults in grid connected mode and fault detection in islanded mode using overcurrent devices are difficult. In the event of an <b>arc</b> <b>fault,</b> all DGs must be disconnected in order to extinguish the arc. Otherwise, they will continue to feed the fault, thus sustaining the arc. However, the system reliability can be increased by maximising the DG connectivity to the system: therefore, the system protection scheme must ensure that only the faulted segment is removed from the feeder. This is true even {{in the case of a}} radial feeder as the DG can be connected at various points along the feeder. In this paper, a new relay scheme is proposed which, along with a novel current control strategy for converter interfaced DGs, can isolate permanent and temporary <b>arc</b> <b>faults.</b> The proposed <b>protection</b> and control scheme can even coordinate with reclosers. The results are validated through PSCAD/EMTDC simulation and MATLAB calculations...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Photovoltaic arc faults {{have led}} to a number of rooftop fires that have caused {{significant}} property damage and threatened the safety of building occupants. In response, Article 690. 11 was added to the United States 2011 National Electrical Code, requiring new PV systems on or penetrating a building to include a listed <b>arc</b> <b>fault</b> <b>protection</b> device. Many proposed arc fault detectors utilize frequency content on the PV string to remotely determine if an arc fault is occurring. A frequency response analyzer was used to measure the AC frequency and impedance response of an 80 W polycrystalline module with degradation similar to those which have caused arc fault. The module had intermittent electrical connectivity in the junction box because of a failed solder bond, {{and the quality of the}} connection could be manipulated by adjusting the external wire orientation. By reorienting the wire, the impedance profile changed and the frequency response transitioned between high-pass, low-pass, and no filtering behavior. This indicated (1) certain module conditions can filter arc fault noise frequencies, and (2) the frequency response or impedance spectroscopy of PV components could be used to identify conditions that cause arc faults in PV systems. The implications for the former are serious because if the detection frequencies used by the fault circuit interrupter (AFCI) are sufficiently filtered, the device will not trip and the arc will not be extinguished. Finally, infrared images were taken of the intermittent module to identify the area of damage and corroborate the impedance spectroscopy results...|$|E

Many publications present solutions to protection {{problems such as}} blinding, false tripping and loss of grading for networks incorporating DG, but neglect to fully quantify and demonstrate the problems that are being addressed. This study fills {{a gap in the}} understanding of the particular problem of protection blinding through presenting a detailed study of the impact of DG on overcurrent protection using a typical UK rural distribution network. This study considers all relevant factors, such as: fault level, DG penetration level, DG location, DG technology, fault type, fault location and fault resistance. The main emphasis and value of this study is in the use of justified and realistic network data, <b>fault</b> (including <b>arc</b> <b>fault)</b> models, utility <b>protection</b> settings policies, real-time simulation and actual protection relays (employed as hardware in the loop), all of which enhance the credibility and validity of the reported findings. The simulations quantify when blinding can occur and demonstrate that, for phase faults, DG is very unlikely to cause blinding, whereas for earth faults (EFs), DG actually increases the sensitivity of EF protection...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Arc {{fault is}} one of the most {{important}} reasons of electrical fires. The common characteristics of series <b>arc</b> <b>faults</b> are always submerged in load currents which are acquired as mixed signals. It is difficult to extract useful <b>arc</b> <b>fault</b> characteristics through conventional approaches. Hence, novel approaches based on blind source separation and harmonic analysis are developed for characteristic research of series <b>arc</b> <b>faults.</b> At first, a low-voltage <b>arc</b> <b>fault</b> experimental platform was set up to generate <b>arc</b> <b>faults</b> of different loads, and a large number of load currents were acquired to analyze fault characteristics. When series <b>arc</b> <b>faults</b> occurred in circuits, currents would distort a little. Then, in order to obtain current minor changes, blind source separation (BSS) was used to separate distortions from observed mixed signals. Finally, common characteristics of series <b>arc</b> <b>faults</b> were found. The amplitudes of odd harmonic components in <b>arc</b> <b>fault</b> currents change rapidly. The total odd harmonic ratio fluctuates tempestuously with inconstancy but increases a lot. These harmonic characteristics provide very important bases for <b>arc</b> <b>fault</b> detection...|$|R
40|$|<b>Arc</b> <b>fault</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{critical}} reasons for electrical fires. Due to the diversity, randomness and concealment of <b>arc</b> <b>faults</b> in low-voltage circuits, it is difficult for general methods to protect all loads from series <b>arc</b> <b>faults.</b> From the analysis of many series <b>arc</b> <b>faults,</b> a large number of high frequency signals generated in circuits are found. These signals are easily affected by Gaussian noise which is difficult to be eliminated as a result of frequency aliasing. Thus, a novel detection algorithm is developed to accurately detect series <b>arc</b> <b>faults</b> in this paper. Initially, an autoregressive model of the mixed high frequency signals is modelled. Then, autoregressive bispectrum analysis is introduced to analyze common series <b>arc</b> <b>fault</b> features. The phase information of <b>arc</b> <b>fault</b> signal is preserved using this method. The influence of Gaussian noise is restrained effectively. Afterwards, several features including characteristic frequency, fluctuation of phase angles, diffused distribution and incremental numbers of bispectrum peaks are extracted for recognizing <b>arc</b> <b>faults.</b> Finally, least squares support vector machine is used to accurately identify series <b>arc</b> <b>faults</b> from the load states based on these frequency features of bispectrum.

40|$|Abstract—Arc {{fault is}} one of the primary reasons that cause {{electrical}} fire. When <b>arc</b> <b>fault</b> occurs in power supply line, the current can not make protective equipments act and the <b>arc</b> <b>fault</b> can not be found and cut off easily, so electrical fire comes into being. In the comparisons, the current signal is used for the detection physical parameter and the wavelet transform is used to study the <b>arc</b> <b>fault</b> detection. First according to the select principle of wavelet singularity detection, select and construct orthogonal quadratic spline wavelet as wavelet function, and use the porous algorithm dyadic wavelet transform to realize wavelet transform fast algorithm. Then carried out the <b>arc</b> <b>fault’s</b> wavelet singularity detection through modulus maxima detection method, finally analyzed the current signal by the method of wavelet approximation. LabWindows/CVI is used as development platform to design and implement the above analysis.

The application of <b>arc</b> <b>fault</b> detection, as an emerging early fire detection technology, is required by the National Electrical Code to reduce the occurrence of electrical fires. However, the concealment, randomness and diversity of <b>arc</b> <b>faults</b> make them difficult to detect.
