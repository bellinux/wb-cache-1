If the location databases fail, the location information loss or corruption will seriously degrade the service {{offered to the}} subscribers.

When an MS receives the re-registration request, it sends a registration message to the VLR to recover the location record. Since <b>all</b> <b>MSs</b> will re-register after receiving the broadcasting request, traffic jam (and thus collisions) may occur. If a collision occurs, then the involved MSs must re-send the registration messages. This paper studies the performance of demand re-registration by investigating how effectively the re-registration can recover the location record for an MS before the first MS call termination occurs. Our results indicate that demand re-registration can effectively recover VLR failure. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper proposes novel pilot {{optimization}} {{and channel}} estimation algorithm for the downlink multiuser massive {{multiple input multiple output}} (MIMO) system with $K$ decentralized single antenna mobile stations (MSs), and {{time division duplex}} (TDD) channel estimation which is performed by utilizing $N$ pilot symbols. The proposed algorithm is explained as follows. First, we formulate the channel estimation problem as a weighted sum mean square error (WSMSE) minimization problem containing pilot symbols and introduced variables. Second, for fixed pilot symbols, the introduced variables are optimized using minimum mean square error (MMSE) and generalized Rayleigh quotient methods. Finally, for $N= 1 $ and $N=K$ settings, the pilot symbols of <b>all</b> <b>MSs</b> are optimized using semi definite programming (SDP) convex optimization approach, and for the other settings of $N$ and $K$, the pilot symbols of <b>all</b> <b>MSs</b> are optimized by applying simple iterative algorithm. When $N=K$, it is shown that the latter iterative algorithm gives the optimal pilot symbols achieved by the SDP method. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm achieves less WSMSE compared to that of the conventional semi-orthogonal pilot symbol and MMSE channel estimation algorithm which creates pilot contamination.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{efficient}} power and rate assignment to mobile stations (MSs) involved in bursty data transmission in cellular CDMA networks. Power {{control in the}} current CDMA standards {{is based on a}} fixed target signal quality called signal to interference ratio (SIR). The target SIR represents a predefined frame error rate (FER). This approach is inefficient for data-MSs because a fixed target SIR can limit the MS's throughput. Power control should thus provide dynamic target SIRs instead of a fixed target SIR. In the research literature, the power control problem has been modeled using game theory. A limitation of the current literature is that in order to implement the algorithms, each MS needs to know information such as path gains and transmission rates of all other MSs. Fast rate control schemes in the evolving cellular data systems such as cdma 2000 - 1 x-EV assign transmission rates to MSs using a probabilistic approach. The limitation here is that the radio resources can be either under or over-utilized. Further, <b>all</b> <b>MSs</b> are not assigned the same rates. In the schemes proposed in the literature, only few MSs, which have the best channel conditions, obtain all radio resources. In this dissertation, we address the power control issue by moving the computation of the Nash equilibrium from each MS to the base station (BS). We also propose equal radio resource allocation for <b>all</b> <b>MSs</b> under the constraint that only the maximum allowable radio resources are used in a cell. This dissertation addresses {{the problem of how to}} efficiently assign power and rate to MSs based on dynamic target SIRs for bursty transmissions. The proposed schemes in this work maximize the throughput of each data-MS while still providing equal allocation of radio resources to <b>all</b> <b>MSs</b> and achieving full radio resource utilization in each cell. The proposed schemes result in power and rate control algorithms that however require some assistance from the BS. The performance evaluation and comparisons with cdma 2000 - 1 x-Evolution Data Only (1 x-EV-DO) show that the proposed schemes can provide better effective rates (rates after error) than the existing schemes...|$|E
