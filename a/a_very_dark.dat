5|$|Larger ships {{often had}} false bows and sterns painted in a {{different}} shade {{from the rest of}} the hull to create the impression of the ship being at greater range from the observer. German decks were <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>dark</b> gray. Smaller ships operating in the North Sea or Baltic Sea were painted white or a very pale gray to blend in with daytime mist and nighttime phosphorescent organisms. As in the First World War, the Germans again employed disguised commerce raiders, Hilfskreuzer such as Atlantis, Thor and Kormoran. These ships were able to modify their appearance to throw off the searching Allied cruisers.|$|E
5|$|On the bird's {{forehead}} was a {{naked and}} pale chalky-blue frontal shield. This {{was surrounded by}} short, velvety black feathers that extended {{from the base of}} the bill to the area just below and in front of the eye, while the area below the eye was a pinkish wash. The bird's chin and throat were sparsely covered with black, velvety feathers, while the neck was a slaty-blue that transitioned into a brownish-grey breast. The abdomen and undertail-coverts were a rich orange, while the undertail was a blackish-grey. The wing was slaty with a hint of brown at its base and became a warm, dark brown by the wingtips; the underwing was brown. The back was grey and transitioned into a browner rump, while the uppertail-coverts were a dark sooty-grey with blackish tips. The tail, which was short and rounded, was <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>dark</b> indigo that had a slightly purple iridescent sheen. The bill was bicoloured; the upper mandible was chalky-blue with a black tip while the lower mandible was red. The plumage of the juvenile is unknown. The bird's feet were a dull purplish-red and unfeathered up to the heel, while the iris was a dark brown.|$|E
5|$|The Sandmans main {{character}} is Dream, the titular Sandman, also known to various characters throughout the series as Morpheus, Oneiros, the Shaper, the Shaper of Form, Lord of the Dreaming, the Dream King, Dream-Sneak, the Cat of Dreams, Murphy, Kai'ckul and Lord L'Zoril, {{who is the}} anthropomorphic personification of dreams. At {{the start of the}} series, Morpheus is captured by an occult ritual and held prisoner for 70 years. Morpheus escapes in the modern day and, after avenging himself upon his captors, sets about rebuilding his kingdom, which has fallen into disrepair in his absence. The character's initial haughty and often cruel manner begins to soften after his years of imprisonment {{at the start of the}} series, but the challenge of undoing past sins and changing old ways is an enormous one for a being who has been set in his ways for billions of years. In its beginnings, the series is <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>dark</b> horror comic. Later, the series evolves into an elaborate fantasy series, incorporating elements of classical and contemporary mythology, ultimately placing its protagonist in the role of a tragic hero.|$|E

5|$|Scientists have {{recognized}} {{two classes of}} geological feature on Oberon: craters and chasmata ('canyons'—deep, elongated, steep-sided depressions which would probably be described as rift valleys or escarpments if on Earth). Oberon's surface is the most heavily cratered of all the Uranian moons, with a crater density approaching saturation—when the formation of new craters is balanced by destruction of old ones. This high number of craters indicates that Oberon has the most ancient surface among Uranus's moons. The crater diameters range up to 206 kilometers for the largest known crater, Hamlet. Many large craters are surrounded by bright impact ejecta (rays) consisting of relatively fresh ice. The largest craters, Hamlet, Othello and Macbeth, have floors made of <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>dark</b> material deposited after their formation. A peak with a height of about 11km was observed in some Voyager images near the south-eastern limb of Oberon, {{which may be the}} central peak of a large impact basin with a diameter of about 375km. Oberon's surface is intersected by a system of canyons, which, however, are less widespread than those found on Titania. The canyons' sides are probably scarps produced by normal faults which can be either old or fresh: the latter transect the bright deposits of some large craters, indicating that they formed later. The most prominent Oberonian canyon is Mommur Chasma.|$|E

25|$|In 1920, {{the silver}} content of all British coins was reduced from 92.5% to 50%, {{with some of}} the {{remainder}} consisting of manganese, which caused the coins to tarnish to <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>dark</b> colour after they had been in circulation for long. Silver was eliminated altogether in 1947, except for Maundy coinage, which returned to the pre-1920 92.5% silver composition.|$|E

25|$|Concerning the {{original}} colours, Machin encouraged {{the use of}} a clearer effigy on a single-coloured background.

25|$|Class L dwarfs {{get their}} {{designation}} {{because they are}} cooler than M stars and L is the remaining letter alphabetically closest to M. Some of these objects have masses large enough to support hydrogen fusion and are therefore stars, but most are of substellar mass and are therefore brown dwarfs. They are <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>dark</b> red in color and brightest in infrared. Their atmosphere is cool enough to allow metal hydrides and alkali metals to be prominent in their spectra.|$|E
25|$|This weakly {{characterized}} race differs {{primarily by}} its intense color, strong color zone, and slight white margin at the suture. Of seventeen shells collected in May, 1954, by Hoogerwerf at Telaga Kastoba, Bawean Island, ten were dextral and seven sinistral. Three lacked a varix, one was grass green in color, three were whitish, and thirteen had yellow ground color. The name sankapurus Fruhstorfer, 1905, refers to white shells with <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>dark</b> color band. This variation {{is similar to}} Amphidromus perversus butoti.|$|E
25|$|Potassium {{ferrocyanide}} is used {{to achieve}} a blue color on cast bronze sculptures during the final finishing stage of the sculpture.

It is applied using a torch and paint brush while wearing the standard safety equipment used for any patina application: rubber gloves, safety glasses, and a respirator.

500|$|Roux {{has become}} the most popular thickener, made from cooking {{together}} a roughly equal proportion of flour and fat (traditionally hog lard, although increasingly made with butter since the mid-20th century). The length of cooking time determines the final flavor and texture, since the longer the roux is cooked before being added to the gumbo, the darker it becomes and the less thickening power it retains. [...] <b>A</b> <b>very</b> <b>dark</b> roux provides a much thinner sauce with a more intense flavor than a light roux.|$|E
500|$|Rumors and misquotes led to {{confusion}} as to {{what such}} a break truly meant; Wentz preferred to not refer to the break as a [...] "hiatus," [...] instead explaining that the band was just [...] "decompressing."
