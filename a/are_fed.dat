5|$|The chicks <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> worms, insects, and berries. Waste {{accumulation}} {{does not}} occur in the nest because adults collect and take it away. Chicks <b>are</b> <b>fed,</b> and then raise tails for elimination of waste, a solid white clump that is collected by a parent prior to flying off. All chicks in the brood leave the nest within two days of each other. Even after leaving the nest, the juveniles will follow their parents around and beg food from them. Juveniles become capable of sustained flight two weeks after fledging.|$|E
5|$|The {{young of}} a clutch hatch over {{two or three}} days and are brooded until their {{feathers}} develop and eyes open five days after hatching. The young <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> on insects until they fledge 16 to 25, typically 17, days after hatching. After this they <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> for one or two weeks. While feeding nestlings, the female is dominant over the male. Cape sparrows are among the main hosts of brood parasitism by the dideric cuckoo in southern Africa, and sometimes parasitise nests of their own species.|$|E
5|$|In Roman times, {{parsnips}} {{were believed}} to be an aphrodisiac. However, parsnips do not typically feature in modern Italian cooking. Instead, they <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> to pigs, particularly those bred to make Parma ham. In traditional Chinese medicine, the root of Chinese parsnip is used as an herbal medicine ingredient.|$|E
30|$|Thirty rabbits were {{randomized}} {{into five}} groups consisting of six animals each. Group 1 animals <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> with salt loaded diet continuously. Group 2 animals <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> with salt loaded diet followed by aqueous extract while animals in group 3 <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> with salt loaded diet followed by ethanol extract. Animals in group 4 <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> with salt loaded diet and distilled water while group 5 animals <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> with normal diet only.|$|R
50|$|Pollen can <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> {{from outside}} or inside the hive. When pollen or a pollen {{supplement}} <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> it can <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> as a powder, granules or in pattie form. Pollen feeders are usually {{used at the}} beginning of the brood rearing season.|$|R
30|$|For this purpose, 30 rats {{were divided}} as follows: control group, rats <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> {{balanced}} diet {{and served as}} normal control; group 2, rats <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> balanced diet and served as positive control; group 3, rats <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> balanced diet supplemented with taurine (100  mg/kg diet); group 4, rats <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> balanced diet supplemented with vanillin (100  mg/kg diet); and group 5, rats <b>were</b> <b>fed</b> balanced diet supplemented with taurine and vanillin at the same tested dose for 3  weeks. Groups from 2 to 5 were orally administered a single dose of KBrO 3 (100  mg/kg diet) then sacrificed after 48  h.|$|R
5|$|The Siberian accentor feeds {{mainly on}} insects, {{typically}} picked off the ground, but sometimes taken from vegetation including bushes and trees, and frequently from near snow fields. Young birds <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> mainly on insects, especially the larvae of beetles, several food items being {{carried to the}} nest at each visit.|$|E
5|$|The chicks <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> by {{the parents}} for several days after fledging. The family may travel as a group or the parents may divide the brood, taking one or two chicks each.|$|E
5|$|Both species lay 3–5 {{normally}} whitish eggs blotched {{with brown}} or grey, which are incubated by the female alone. The chicks hatch after {{two to three}} weeks. Red-billed chough chicks are almost naked, but the chicks of the higher altitude Alpine chough hatch with a dense covering of natal down. The chicks <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> by both parents and fledge in 29–31 days after hatching for Alpine chough, and 31–41days for red-billed.|$|E
50|$|The groom should curry {{the horse}} after he <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> each morning, and should unhalter the horse {{after he has}} <b>been</b> <b>fed.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lake Jordan <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> {{primarily}} by the outflow of Tupper Lake, which in turn <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> by Tupper Creek all in Odessa and Sebewa townships in Ionia County.|$|R
25|$|The lake <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> in Vermont by the LaPlatte, Lamoille, Missisquoi, Poultney, and Winooski rivers, {{along with}} Lewis Creek, Little Otter Creek, and Otter Creek. In New York, it <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> by the Ausable, Boquet, Great Chazy, La Chute, Little Ausable, Little Chazy, Salmon, and Saranac rivers, along with Putnam Creek. In Quebec, it <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> by the Pike River.|$|R
5|$|Chestnut sparrows are gregarious, and {{are only}} {{occasionally}} found away from flocks. They frequently associate with queleas and other weavers. Adults feed on grass seeds, and those near human habitations will also eat crumbs and other household scraps. Nestlings <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> mostly softer grass seeds, and small beetles are also recorded in their diet.|$|E
5|$|Females {{lay between}} three and seven pale bluish-green, brown-blotched eggs. Incubation is about 18 to 21 days, by the female only. However, the male may stand or crouch over the young, {{sheltering}} but not actually brooding them. Young fledge at 35 to 42 days, and <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> by both parents. They stay with their parents for another six months after fledging.|$|E
5|$|Fieldfares often nest {{in small}} colonies, {{possibly}} {{for protection from}} predators. The nest is built in a tree where five or six eggs are laid. The chicks <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> by both parents and leave the nest after a fortnight. There may be two broods in southern parts of the range but only one further north. Migrating birds and wintering birds often form large flocks, often {{in the company of}} Redwings.|$|E
40|$|The 30 steers {{used were}} good to choice Herefords {{purchased}} as claves near Sterling, Kansas, and allotted to 3 lots of 10 steers each. Unlimited roughage <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> where grain <b>was</b> restricted. A ratio of 1 part roughage to 3 parts grain <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> on full feed.

25|$|The Northumberland Strait <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> by the Kouchibouguac, Kouchibouguacis, Richibucto, Bouctouche, Cocagne and Shediac Rivers; {{while the}} Gulf of St. Lawrence <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> by the Tabusintac, Big Tracadie and Pokemouche Rivers.|$|R
5|$|For {{the first}} few days after hatching, young red-throated loons <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> aquatic insects and small {{crustaceans}} by both parents. After 3–4days, the parents switch to fish small enough for the young birds to swallow whole. By four weeks of age, the young can eat the same food—of the same size—as their parents do. Young birds may be fed for some time after fledging; adults have been seen feeding fish to juveniles at sea and on inland lakes in the United Kingdom, hundreds of kilometres from any breeding areas.|$|E
5|$|Mainly nocturnal M. nigriceps {{is found}} in hot hilly areas and woodland, nesting {{underground}} in mounds. The ant's diet consists of sweet liquids from flowering plants and invertebrate prey, which <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> to the carnivorous larvae. Spiders are known to eat these ants, and echidnas consume the larvae and pupae. Like other Myrmecia species, M. nigriceps ants possess a powerful and painful sting, and the venom is capable of inducing allergic reactions in sensitive people.|$|E
5|$|Mourning doves {{are light}} grey and brown and {{generally}} muted in color. Males and females {{are similar in}} appearance. The species is generally monogamous, with two squabs (young) per brood. Both parents incubate {{and care for the}} young. Mourning doves eat almost exclusively seeds, but the young <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> crop milk by their parents.|$|E

50|$|The cannon when fixed {{was known}} as the Ho-3, {{compared}} to its flexible brother the Ho-3 <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> with a 50-round double drum, while the Ho-1 <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> by a 15-round magazine.|$|R
40|$|CONSOL {{completed}} {{characterization of}} 64 samples from five run conditions of HTI Run ALC- 1 (227 - 94), in which raw and cleaned (oil-agglomerated at low pH) Black Thunder Mine subbituminous coal <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> and processed using only dispersed catalysts in the liquefaction reactors. Extraction of THF-soluble resid from the pressure-filter cakes was more complete when agglomerates <b>were</b> <b>fed,</b> leaving only 5 % or less THF solubles in the extracted cakes. When raw coal <b>was</b> <b>fed,</b> the extracted cakes contained 9 - 34 % THF solubles. HTI also observed improved filtration during the periods that agglomerates <b>were</b> <b>fed.</b> Improved operability, if verified by additional work, {{could be an}} economically significant benefit of coal cleaning by oil agglomeration at low pH. An apparently higher Mo addition rate (see fourth bullet) {{may have contributed to}} the benefits of using oil-agglomerated coal. Other stream sample characteristics changed when oil-agglomerated coal <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> in Conditions 2 - 4, relative to when uncleaned coal <b>was</b> <b>fed</b> in Conditions 1 and 5. The ash content of the 0 - 6 bottoms samples was lower when oil-agglomerates <b>were</b> <b>fed.</b> The THF-soluble 524 {degrees}C+ resid concentration in the feed slurry doubled when agglomerated coal <b>was</b> <b>fed.</b> Three factors may have influenced these characteristics. Higher coal conversion would have produced more resid. More efficient toluene-extraction of the filter cake would have recycled more resid. Removal of distillate as product to offset oil fed as part of the agglomerated coal would preferentially recycle the heaviest components...|$|R
5|$|The Eurasian {{nuthatch}} eats mainly insects, particularly caterpillars and beetles, {{although in}} autumn and winter its diet is supplemented with nuts and seeds. The young <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> mainly on insects, with some seeds, food items mainly being found on tree trunks and large branches. The nuthatch can forage when descending trees head first, {{as well as}} when climbing. It readily visits bird tables, eating fatty man-made food items as well as seeds. It is an inveterate hoarder, storing food year-round. Its main natural predator is the Eurasian sparrowhawk.|$|E
5|$|The Puerto Rican amazon reaches sexual {{maturity}} at {{between three and}} four years of age. It reproduces once a year and is a cavity nester. Once the female lays eggs she {{will remain in the}} nest and continuously incubate them until hatching. The chicks <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> by both parents and will fledge 60 to 65 days after hatching. This parrot's diet is varied and consists of flowers, fruits, leaves, bark and nectar obtained from the forest canopy.|$|E
5|$|The adult Iago sparrow feeds {{mainly on}} the seeds of grass and grain (the main cereal crop grown in Cape Verde is maize), but also on insects and plant shoots. They can do damage to crops by eating young leaves, and like house sparrows will eat the food scraps {{available}} near houses. Nestlings, by contrast to adults, <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> almost exclusively on insects, especially caterpillars, flies, and orthopterans. The Iago sparrow forages mostly on the ground, moving restlessly whilst clinging to the ground like a mouse.|$|E
50|$|The Holland Lop rabbit should <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> {{daily with}} good quality pellets, fresh vegetables, and {{unlimited}} grass or timothy hay, {{as well as}} fresh water. Pellets should <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> one ounce per pound of body weight. Rabbits enjoy {{many different types of}} fresh vegetables, such as romaine lettuce, endives, parsley, coriander, dill, fennel and arugula, as well as carrots. Fresh leafy vegetables should <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> at a rate of at least 1 packed cup per 2 pounds of body a day. Leafy greens high in oxalic acid, such as parsley and spinach, should not <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> every day. Non-leafy vegetables such as carrots or peppers should <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> in much smaller quantities, about 1 tablespoon per 2 pound of body weight per day. Alfalfa hay or alfalfa based pellets should only <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> to juvenile rabbits under 1 year. Treats from pet supplies stores are often not particularly safe for rabbits to ingest. They often are high in sugar or fat, or contain foods that rabbits cannot digest.|$|R
50|$|Lake Bakhtegan, Iran’s {{second largest}} lake, <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> mostly by the Kur River, while Lake Tashk <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> by {{overflow}} from the marshes at its west end {{and by a}} large permanent spring in the northwest.|$|R
50|$|Highway 1, the Trans-Canada Highway, and the {{mainline}} of the Canadian Pacific Railway {{parallel the}} river. Little Shuswap Lake <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> by the Little River, which drains Shuswap Lake, which <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> by several rivers and creeks.|$|R
5|$|The adult russet sparrow {{is mostly}} a seed-eater, eating the seeds of herbs and weeds as well as rice, barley, and other grains. Berries, {{such as those of}} the kingore (certain Berberis spp.), are also eaten when available. Nestlings <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> mostly on insects, {{especially}} caterpillars and larval beetles obtained on trees and flying insects caught by aerial pursuit. During the breeding season adults also consume insects.|$|E
5|$|The clutch is {{a single}} egg, usually pure white, {{sometimes}} with some reddish brown spots that soon disappear. The average size of the egg is , and it weighs , of which 6% is shell. If an egg is lost early enough, on rare occasions a replacement may be laid. This is very unusual for tubenoses. The eggs are incubated by both parents for 38–50days, the longer periods arising when the eggs have become chilled through adult absence. One adult typically spends three {{days at a time}} on the egg while its partner feeds at sea. The chicks are altricial and covered with silver-grey down, and <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> by both parents with their regurgitated oily stomach contents. The adults do not normally stay with the chick after first week, visiting only to bring food. After about 50days, the chicks <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> less regularly, sometimes with gaps of several days, and the parents may stop visiting completely shortly before the chick leaves the nest. The chicks fledge about 56–86days after hatching, and receive no parental support after leaving the nest hole.|$|E
5|$|The {{eggs are}} {{incubated}} by the female for 14–15 days to hatching. Chicks <b>are</b> <b>fed</b> initially by the male, both parents sharing the duty {{after a few}} days when the female does not need to brood so often, and they fledge in a further 14–15 days. There may be two broods in a year.|$|E
50|$|The reformator <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> with {{bioethanol}} as fuel, {{and oxygen}} (stored as a liquid {{in a high}} pressure cryogenic tank), generating hydrogen as a sub-product. The produced hydrogen and more oxygen <b>is</b> <b>fed</b> to the fuel cells.|$|R

50|$|In the wild, lories eat nectar, pollen, fruits, and {{occasional}} insects. As pets they should <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> a good formulated diet. Smaller lories should <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> fresh nectar (commercial or home-made) daily. Larger birds can <b>be</b> <b>fed</b> pellets from a bird food company, or {{fruits and vegetables}} such as apples, pomegranates, papaya, grapes, cantaloupe, pineapple, figs, kiwi, and corn-on-the-cob. Lories can be given treats to reward positive behavior. Fresh, clean water should be provided daily.|$|R
