5|$|Despite the block, Salmaniya Medical Complex's {{disaster}} {{plan was}} activated {{on the morning}} of the attack. It called for more than a dozen <b>ambulances</b> to search nearby areas and Pearl Roundabout. Another dozen <b>ambulances</b> were put on stand-by, according to a member of the medical staff. The staff said that <b>ambulances</b> were functioning in accordance with the plan until about 6:00am, when an alleged call from the Ministry of Interior ordered all but two <b>ambulances</b> to head back to the SMC. However, this order was ignored and more <b>ambulances</b> were sent to search for the injured in the areas surrounding the roundabout.|$|E
5|$|Doctor – Doctors {{are present}} on some <b>ambulances</b> – most notably air <b>ambulances</b> – will employ {{physicians}} to attend on the <b>ambulances,</b> bringing {{a full range}} of additional skills such as use of prescription medicines.|$|E
5|$|In {{parts of}} the world which lack a high level of infrastructure, <b>ambulances</b> are {{designed}} to meet local conditions, being built using intermediate technology. <b>Ambulances</b> can also be trailers, which are pulled by bicycles, motorcycles, tractors, or animals. Animal-powered <b>ambulances</b> can be particularly useful in regions that are subject to flooding. Motorcycles fitted with sidecars (or motorcycle <b>ambulances)</b> are also used, though they are subject to some of the same limitations as more traditional over-the-road <b>ambulances.</b> The level of care provided by these <b>ambulances</b> varies between merely providing transport to a medical clinic to providing on-scene and continuing care during transport.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ambulance</b> Victoria (AV), {{an agency}} of the Department of Health & Human Services, is the {{statutory}} provider of pre-hospital emergency care and <b>ambulance</b> services in Victoria. <b>Ambulance</b> Victoria was formed on 1 July 2008 following the merger of the Metropolitan <b>Ambulance</b> Service (MAS), Rural <b>Ambulance</b> Victoria (RAV), and the Alexandra District <b>Ambulance</b> Service (ADAS). <b>Ambulance</b> Victoria has undergone significant reform since 2008.|$|R
5|$|<b>Ambulances</b> can {{be grouped}} into types {{depending}} {{on whether or not}} they transport patients, and under what conditions. In some cases, <b>ambulances</b> may fulfil more than one function (such as combining emergency ambulance care with patient transport).|$|E
5|$|Boat – Boats {{can be used}} {{to serve}} as <b>ambulances,</b> {{especially}} in island areas or in areas with a large number of canals, such as the Venetian water <b>ambulances.</b> Some lifeboats or lifeguard vessels may fit the description of an ambulance as they are used to transport a casualty.|$|E
5|$|Casualties were {{cared for}} by medical officers, {{stretcher}} bearers, camel drivers and sand-cart drivers who worked tirelessly, often in the firing line, covering enormous distances in difficult conditions and doing all they could to relieve {{the suffering of the}} wounded. The casualties were transported on cacolets on camels or in sand-carts back to the field <b>ambulances,</b> as the heavy sand made it impossible to use motor- or horse-drawn <b>ambulances.</b> Between 4 and 9 August, the Anzac Mounted Division's five field <b>ambulances</b> brought in 1,314 patients, including 180 enemy wounded.|$|E

25|$|The Metropolitan Toronto Department of <b>Ambulance</b> Services {{was created}} in 1975, and absorbed the five {{remaining}} private <b>ambulance</b> companies and single provincial service, providing a single, unified <b>ambulance</b> service in Metro Toronto. Known colloquially as Metro Toronto <b>Ambulance</b> or simply Metro <b>Ambulance</b> (although never its official name) the service provided <b>ambulance</b> services from 1975 to 1998.|$|R
5|$|Military <b>ambulances</b> have {{historically}} included vehicles based on civilian designs {{and at times}} also included armored, but unarmed, vehicles <b>ambulances</b> based upon armoured personnel carriers (APCs). In the Second World War vehicles such as the Hanomag Sd Kfz 251 halftrack were pressed into service as ad hoc <b>ambulances,</b> and in more recent times purpose built AFVs such as the U.S. M1133 Medical Evacuation Vehicle serve the exclusive purpose of armored medical vehicles. Civilian based designs may be painted in appropriate colours, depending on the operational requirements (i.e. camouflage for field use, white for United Nations peacekeeping, etc.). For example, the British Royal Army Medical Corps has a fleet of white <b>ambulances,</b> based on production trucks. Military helicopters have also served both as ad hoc and purpose-built air <b>ambulances,</b> since they are extremely useful for MEDEVAC.|$|E
5|$|Since {{laws of war}} demand <b>ambulances</b> {{be marked}} {{with one of the}} Emblems of the Red Cross not to mount {{offensive}} weapons, military <b>ambulances</b> are often unarmed. It is a generally accepted practice in most countries to classify the personnel attached to military vehicles marked as <b>ambulances</b> as non-combatants; however, this application does not always exempt medical personnel from catching enemy fire—accidental or deliberate. As a result, medics and other medical personnel attached to military <b>ambulances</b> are usually put through basic military training, on the assumption that they may have to use a weapon. The laws of war do allow non-combatant military personnel to carry individual weapons for protecting themselves and casualties. However, not all militaries exercise this right to their personnel.|$|E
5|$|Methods of {{summoning}} (e.g. telephone) and dispatching <b>ambulances</b> usually rely {{on electronic}} equipment, which itself often relies on an intact power grid. Similarly, modern <b>ambulances</b> {{are equipped with}} two-way radios or cellular telephones {{to enable them to}} contact hospitals, either to notify the appropriate hospital of the ambulance's pending arrival, or, in cases where physicians do not form part of the ambulance's crew, to confer with a physician for medical oversight.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} the {{ambulance}} begins in ancient times, {{with the use of}} carts to transport incurable patients by force. <b>Ambulances</b> were first used for emergency transport in 1487 by the Spanish, and civilian variants were put into operation during the 1830s. Advances in technology throughout the 19th and 20th centuries led to the modern self-powered <b>ambulances.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{receiving}} station was formed from the immobile sections of light horse and mounted rifle brigades' field <b>ambulances,</b> a section from the 1/1st Welsh and the 157th Indian Field <b>Ambulances</b> with an operating unit, the Anzac Field Laboratory, and a detachment from an Egyptian hospital. This Receiving Station {{took over the}} site near Jericho, occupied by the main dressing station during the two Transjordan attacks, which could accommodate 200 patients in mud huts, 400 patients in tents, and 700 patients in the abandoned Desert Mounted Corps headquarters.|$|E

50|$|Formal <b>ambulance</b> {{services}} {{began in}} Victoria since 1883. Over the years services {{were provided by}} St John <b>Ambulance,</b> Civil <b>Ambulance</b> Service and a multitude of local area <b>ambulance</b> services. In the 1980s the Metropolitan <b>Ambulance</b> Service was formed {{from a number of}} smaller area services and 16 regional services were amalgamated into five. In 1997 this was then consolidated down to one rural service, Rural <b>Ambulance</b> Victoria.|$|R

5|$|<b>Ambulances</b> are {{provided}} by the Yorkshire Ambulance Service, which itself is an NHS trust. Fire services in Sheffield {{are provided}} by South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service. For the purposes of fire-fighting and rescue, Sheffield is divided into East and West sub-divisions.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ambulances,</b> {{like other}} {{emergency}} vehicles, {{are required to}} operate in all weather conditions, including those during which civilian drivers often elect {{to stay off the}} road. Also, the ambulance crew's responsibilities to their patient often preclude their use of safety devices such as seat belts. Research has shown that <b>ambulances</b> {{are more likely to be}} involved in motor vehicle collisions resulting in injury or death than either fire trucks or police cars. Unrestrained occupants, particularly those riding in the patient-care compartment, are particularly vulnerable. When compared to civilian vehicles of similar size, one study found that on a per-accident basis, ambulance collisions tend to involve more people, and result in more injuries. An 11-year retrospective study concluded in 2001 found that although most fatal ambulance crashes occurred during emergency runs, they typically occurred on improved, straight, dry roads, during clear weather. Furthermore, paramedics are also at risk in <b>ambulances</b> while helping patients, as 27 paramedics died during ambulance trips in the US between 1991 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|At Salmaniya Medical Complex, doctors {{joined the}} protests themselves, {{speaking}} to protesters and media {{from the hospital}} stairs, after authorities blocked <b>ambulances</b> from bringing injured protesters there for care.

5|$|Data Recorders – These {{are often}} placed in <b>ambulances</b> to record such {{information}} as speed, braking power and time, activation of active emergency warnings such as lights and sirens, {{as well as}} seat belt usage. These are often used in coordination with GPS units.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{ambulance}} – The {{most common}} type of ambulance, which provide care to patients with an acute illness or injury. These can be road-going vans, boats, helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft (known as air <b>ambulances)</b> or even converted vehicles such as golf carts.|$|E
5|$|Fire service {{operated}} <b>ambulances</b> may {{display the}} Cross of St. Florian (often incorrectly called a Maltese cross) as this cross is frequently {{used as a}} fire department logo (St. Florian being {{the patron saint of}} firefighters).|$|E
50|$|The next {{generation}} of <b>ambulance</b> providers were now primarily {{in the business of}} <b>ambulance</b> care instead of it being a secondary operation. There was a wide range of success for these services most notably were Exclusive <b>Ambulance</b> Service and Twin City <b>Ambulance</b> Service. Queensway <b>Ambulance</b> Service and Arthur Wilson <b>Ambulance</b> Services both existed for short periods of time, but very little to no information has survived to today.|$|R
