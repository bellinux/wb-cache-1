5|$|Chinese {{immigration}} to the United States <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>was</b> neither uniform nor widespread. J. R.

The U.S. Minister to China, George Seward, had asserted similar numbers in Scribner's Magazine five years earlier.|$|E

Khan, who was working on other projects <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>was</b> unavailable for the shooting schedule so it was changed. As in his previous productions, Yash Chopra wanted to introduce a fresh pairing in Jab Tak Hai Jaan and chose Katrina Kaif to star with Khan. Anushka Sharma was cast in a supporting role to complete her three-film contract with Yash Raj Films, with whom she had worked on many previous projects. Though casting was quickly completed, shooting was delayed because the lead actors were busy with other projects.|$|E
5|$|After graduation, Sawyer {{joined the}} law firm of Drinker Biddle & Reath, where he {{remained}} for his entire career. Shortly after joining the firm, he was assigned to work as a temporary assistant district attorney in the O'Malley Case, a prosecution of political corruption in the city (the Philadelphia district attorney's office <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>was</b> mostly staffed by part-time employees drawn from firms as needed). Working under lead prosecutor Laurence Howard Eldredge and alongside assistant prosecutor Lemuel Braddock Schofield, Sawyer assisted in the trial of Chief Magistrate John J. O'Malley for 206 counts of malfeasance in office. O'Malley was found not guilty in two trials in 1948 and 1949. Sawyer was called back into the Navy in 1950 during the Korean War and later as a foreign service officer in Europe. He returned to Philadelphia in 1953.|$|E
5|$|At the University of Heidelberg, Goebbels {{wrote his}} {{doctoral}} thesis on Wilhelm von Schütz, a minor 19th century romantic dramatist.

It did not seem to bother Goebbels that Gundolf was Jewish. However, Gundolf was no longer performing teaching duties, so he directed Goebbels to associate professor Max Freiherr von Waldberg. Waldberg was also Jewish. It was Waldberg who recommended Goebbels write his thesis on Wilhelm von Schütz. After submitting the thesis and passing his oral examination, Goebbels earned his PhD in 1921.|$|E

5|$|By {{this time}} Pierre Christin was {{dividing}} {{his time between}} Paris and Bordeaux, where {{he was working on}} founding the school of journalism at the Institut Universitaire de Technologie (IUT). Meeting up with Mézières one day, Christin suggested that they work on creating a comic strip together. Both had their experiences in the American West to draw upon but felt, thanks to Lucky Luke, Jerry Spring and Blueberry, that the market for Westerns was already crowded. Instead, Christin suggested that they turn their hands to science fiction, a genre that, <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time,</b> <b>was</b> not prevalent in French comics. Although Goscinny was not a science fiction fan, he wanted to promote innovation and originality in Pilote and so commissioned them to produce a strip.|$|E
5|$|During the Revolutionary War, {{city hall}} {{was home to}} the Albany Committee of Correspondence (the {{political}} arm of the local revolutionary movement), which took over operation of Albany's government in 1775 and eventually expanded its power to control all of Albany County (which <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>was</b> the largest county in the colony, extending far past its current borders). Tories and prisoners of war were often jailed in city hall alongside common criminals. Following the war, city hall was an occasional meeting place of the newly formed New York Legislature, {{in addition to being}} home to the city and county governments, the jail, courts, and local registry.|$|E
5|$|Evolve was {{developed}} by Turtle Rock Studios. Evolves creative director, Phil Robb, and lead designer, Chris Ashton, are the co-founders of Turtle Rock Studios alongside Michael Booth. The team had a heritage of developing competitive multiplayer games, such as Valve Corporation's Counter-Strike series and the Left 4 Dead series. According to Robb, the team {{wanted to build a}} co-operative, multiplayer game because it gave the team a chance to play with their family and friends together, instead of against each other, and found it offered a more enjoyable experience than competitive multiplayer games. The concept for Evolve was completed in 2005, before the development of the first Left 4 Dead game. However, the Evolve project was put on hold, as Turtle Rock thought that the technology <b>at</b> <b>that</b> <b>time</b> <b>was</b> not advanced enough to handle the game's design.|$|E
