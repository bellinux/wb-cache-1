5|$|P. l. spelaea or P. spelaea, {{known as}} the European cave lion, Eurasian cave lion, or Upper Pleistocene European cave lion, {{occurred}} in Eurasia 300,000 to 10,000 years ago. This species is known from Paleolithic cave paintings, ivory carvings, and clay busts, indicating it had protruding ears, tufted tails, perhaps faint tiger-like stripes. A few had a ruff or primitive mane <b>around</b> <b>their</b> <b>necks,</b> possibly indicating males, but many scenes show hunting behavior (which would be the females).|$|E
5|$|After {{traveling}} through {{a network of}} caves and a dormant volcano, the team reaches the borders of Atlantis. They are greeted by Kida who resembles a young woman and discover that the Atlantean language {{is the basis of}} many existing languages. Kida enlists Milo's aid in deciphering the Atlantean written language, long forgotten by the natives. By swimming deep within the city's submerged ruins and translating underwater murals, Milo helps Kida uncover the nature of the Heart of Atlantis: it supplies the Atlanteans with power and longevity through the crystals worn <b>around</b> <b>their</b> <b>necks.</b> He is surprised this is not mentioned in the journal but recalls that a page is missing.|$|E
5|$|Autopsies showed {{all three}} victims had water in their lungs, proving {{they had been}} thrown into the water while still alive. Michelleidentified as the second body foundhad freed one hand from her bonds before she drowned. The {{partially}} dressed bodies of all three women indicated that the underlying crime was sexual assault. All three victims had ropes tied <b>around</b> <b>their</b> <b>necks</b> with a concrete block {{at the other end}} to ensure they died from either suffocation or drowning, and that their bodies would never be found. However, the bodies bloated as a result of decomposition, and floated to the surface.|$|E
5000|$|War uniforms {{were often}} used as means of {{displaying}} wealth rather than functional battle purposes. The hersir was often equipped with a conical helmet and a short mail coat. The type of helmet, sword, and ringmail corselet worn by the Viking, demonstrated {{the wealth of the}} warrior. Often, a combined symbol of the cross, a hammer <b>around</b> <b>their</b> <b>neck,</b> accompanied with a wolf head decoration would be worn <b>around</b> <b>their</b> <b>neck.</b> Hersirs are typically thought to be very well groomed.|$|R

5|$|During the Hundred Years' War, {{the army}} of King Edward III besieged Calais, and Edward ordered that the town's {{population}} be killed en masse. He agreed to spare them if six of the principal citizens would come to him prepared to die, bareheaded and barefooted and with ropes <b>around</b> <b>their</b> <b>necks.</b> When they came, he ordered that they be executed, but pardoned them when his queen, Philippa of Hainault, begged him to spare their lives. The Burghers of Calais depicts the men as they are leaving for the king's camp, carrying keys to the town's gates and citadel.|$|E
5|$|The {{invention}} of the wheel was a major technological innovation {{that gave rise to}} chariot warfare. At first, equines, both horses and onagers, were hitched to wheeled carts by means of a yoke <b>around</b> <b>their</b> <b>necks</b> {{in a manner similar to}} that of oxen. However, such a design is incompatible with equine anatomy, limiting both the strength and mobility of the animal. By the time of the Hyksos invasions of Egypt, c.1600 BC, horses were pulling chariots with an improved harness design that made use of a breastcollar and breeching, which allowed a horse to move faster and pull more weight.|$|E
5|$|The wolves {{are kept}} in a human {{facility}} {{for a couple of}} months to be examined, and a wound on Oldtooth's paw is treated. In early winter, the wolves are sedated again and awaken to find themselves in a strange high place with radio collars <b>around</b> <b>their</b> <b>necks.</b> Still groggy from the tranquilizer, the strangeness of the events and the smell of grizzly bear in the area triggers Marta's flight instincts and she runs blindly downward, leaving Oldtooth and the cubs behind. When Oldtooth awakens, he quietly abandons Annie and Sula, following Marta's trail, but at a much slower pace.|$|E
50|$|Native Americans {{carried their}} knives in sheaths, either on <b>their</b> belts or <b>around</b> <b>their</b> <b>neck.</b> They often used beads, feathers, and paint to {{decorate}} their sheaths with Native American symbols.|$|R

5|$|When {{the title}} was created, a {{suggested}} medal was drafted and designed by the government. The major difference between this medal and the current medal is {{the design of the}} suspension and the star medallion at the bottom: the top suspension is longer than the bottom, and the bottom star is outlined differently and is adorned with rubies. The suspension was made from gold-plated silver, while the suspension of the current medal is made from gold, as the medal. The design of the star evokes the Marshal's Star, which Soviet Marshals wore <b>around</b> <b>their</b> <b>necks.</b> This medal was adopted by Presidential Decree Number 26 on May 15, 1996.|$|E
5|$|For {{the most}} part, Germans {{accepted}} the Nuremberg Laws, partly because Nazi propaganda had successfully swayed public opinion towards the general belief that Jews were a separate race, {{but also because}} to oppose the regime meant leaving oneself open to harassment or arrest by the Gestapo. Citizens were relieved that the antisemitic violence ceased after the laws were passed. Non-Jews gradually stopped socialising with Jews or shopping in Jewish-owned stores. Wholesalers who continued to serve Jewish merchants were marched through the streets with placards <b>around</b> <b>their</b> <b>necks</b> proclaiming them as traitors. The Communist party and some elements of the Catholic Church were critical of the laws. Concerned that international opinion would be adversely swayed by the new laws, the Interior Ministry did not actively enforce them until after the 1936 Summer Olympics, held in Berlin that August.|$|E
5|$|Oba Chandler (October 11, 1946November 15, 2011) was an American man {{convicted and}} {{executed}} for the June 1989 triple murders of Joan Rogers {{and her two}} daughters, whose bodies were found, with their hands and feet bound, floating in Tampa Bay, Florida. Autopsies showed the victims had been thrown into the water while still alive, with ropes <b>around</b> <b>their</b> <b>necks</b> with a concrete block tied {{at the other end}} of the rope. The case became high-profile in 1992 when local police posted, on billboards, enlarged copies of the suspect's handwriting recovered on a pamphlet in the victims' car. Chandler was identified as the killer when his neighbor recognized the handwriting. This was the first such use of billboards by law enforcement in the U.S.; billboards became useful tools in searches for missing people.|$|E

50|$|During the festival, {{children}} get {{dressed up in}} festival robes, carry a bag <b>around</b> <b>their</b> <b>neck,</b> and go <b>around</b> in groups in the neighborhood, singing special songs, knocking the doors of neighbors, and receiving nuts and candy from them.|$|R
5|$|They {{awake in}} a {{classroom}} in a small, vacated island, surrounded by troops, and wearing metal collars <b>around</b> <b>their</b> <b>necks.</b> A teacher, psychopathic sadist Kinpatsu Sakamochi, briefs the students: the class has been chosen {{to participate in the}} Program. They have three days to kill each other until one stands as the victor, or the metal collars will detonate, killing them all (as Sakamochi gleefully demonstrates on one student). The students are issued survival packs and a random weapon/tool, and sent out onto the island one by one. While most of the students receive guns and knives, some acquire relatively useless items like boomerangs, dartboard darts, or a fork. Hiroki Sugimura finds a radar device that tracks nearby students, and Toshinori Oda receives a bulletproof vest.|$|E
5|$|Persons {{suspected}} of having sexual relations with non-Aryans were charged with Rassenschande (racial defilement) and tried in the regular courts. Evidence provided to the Gestapo for such cases was largely provided by ordinary citizens such as neighbours, co-workers, or other informants. Persons accused of race defilement were publicly humiliated by being paraded through the streets with a placard <b>around</b> <b>their</b> <b>necks</b> detailing their crime. Those convicted were typically sentenced to prison terms, and (subsequent to 8 March 1938) upon completing their sentences were re-arrested by the Gestapo and sent to Nazi concentration camps. As the law did not permit capital punishment for racial defilement, special courts were convened to allow {{the death penalty for}} some cases. From the end of 1935 through 1940, 1,911 people were convicted of Rassenschande. Over time, the law was extended to include non-sexual forms of physical contact such as greeting someone with a kiss or an embrace.|$|E
5|$|The Monks, {{referred}} to by the name monks on record sleeves, were an American garage rock band formed in Gelnhausen, Germany in 1964. Assembled by five American G.I.s stationed in the country, the group grew tired of the traditional format of rock, which motivated them to forge a highly experimental style characterized by an emphasis on hypnotic rhythms that minimized the role of melody, augmented {{by the use of}} sound manipulation techniques. The band's unconventional blend of shrill vocals, feedback, and guitarist David Day's six-string banjo baffled audiences, but music historians have since identified the Monks as a pioneering force in avant-garde music. The band's lyrics often voiced objection to the Vietnam War and the apparently dehumanized state of society, while prefiguring the harsh and blunt commentary of the punk rock movement of the 1970s and 1980s. The band's appearance was considered as shocking as its music, as they attempted to mimic the look of Catholic monks by wearing black habits with cinctures symbolically tied <b>around</b> <b>their</b> <b>necks,</b> and hair worn in partially shaved tonsures.|$|E
50|$|Dogs are {{walked with}} a collar <b>around</b> <b>their</b> <b>neck,</b> or a dog harness, or by {{following}} their owner by familiarity and verbal control. Commonly the dog is walked by the owner, or another family member, {{but there are also}} professional dog walkers.|$|R
50|$|The lake is an {{important}} food source for the local people (Bais), who are famous for their fishing method: their trained cormorants catch fish and return them to fishmongers. The birds are prevented from swallowing their fish by rings fixed <b>around</b> <b>their</b> <b>neck.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Saint Bernards {{are often}} portrayed {{carrying}} a small barrel of brandy <b>around</b> <b>their</b> <b>neck</b> to warm victims {{lost in the}} snowy mountains.

25|$|Notable Zagreb souvenirs are the tie or cravat, an {{accessory}} named after Croats who wore characteristic scarves <b>around</b> <b>their</b> <b>necks</b> in the Thirty Years' War in the 17th {{century and the}} ball-point pen, a tool developed from the inventions by Slavoljub Eduard Penkala, an inventor and a citizen of Zagreb.|$|E
50|$|Great {{value was}} {{prescribed}} by the peace medals, which {{were to be}} buried with the owner or passed down from generation to generation. A considerable amount of portraiture made of Native American figures accentuating the medals worn <b>around</b> <b>their</b> <b>neck</b> serves as a testament to their importance.|$|R
5000|$|A signaculum was a lead [...] "dog tag" [...] in {{a leather}} pouch carried by Roman {{soldiers}} <b>around</b> <b>their</b> <b>neck.</b> It {{seems to have had}} personal details (acting to identify a body the same way a modern dog tag does) with a seal or stamp to authenticate it.|$|R
50|$|Musical {{groups of}} jarochos are bands of {{minstrel}} musicians, who dress {{and play in}} the Veracruz style. They are distinguished by their traditional white guayabera shirts and white pants and hats; also the men wear a red bandana <b>around</b> <b>their</b> <b>neck.</b> Music played by jarochos is known as Son Jarocho.|$|R
25|$|Stethoscopes {{are often}} {{considered}} {{as a symbol of}} healthcare professionals, as various healthcare providers are often seen or depicted with stethoscopes hanging <b>around</b> <b>their</b> <b>necks.</b> A 2012 research paper claimed that the stethoscope, when compared to other medical equipment, had the highest positive impact on the perceived trustworthiness of the practitioner seen with it.|$|E
25|$|This {{ship was}} also {{scouting}} for new Catholic mission sites. With {{the aid of}} Malagasy interpreters aboard the ship, French and Italian Jesuit missionaries from Goa gave mass on the beach, where they observed some Malagasy wearing pewter crosses <b>around</b> <b>their</b> <b>necks</b> which they'd gotten from Portuguese, while several even had tattoos of crosses. They also found some Portuguese words were being used.|$|E
25|$|The desecration was {{not only}} carried out on Christian sites in and around Jerusalem. In campaigns of 1011 and 1013–14, Al-Hakim {{continued}} his campaign of destruction against Jewish synagogues and Torah scrolls along with churches all over Syria. Unlike other Fatimids, Al-Hakim launched persecutions against dhimmis that lasted throughout his reign. Christians were made to wear crosses and Jews forced to wear wooden blocks <b>around</b> <b>their</b> <b>necks.</b> He only stopped for fear of retaliatory attacks on Mosques in Christian lands.|$|E
5000|$|During the {{pre-product}} launch testing, Anker suggested several {{modifications to}} the design of the watch, such as less sensitive buttons {{and the creation of a}} lanyard version which would enable climbers to wear the watch <b>around</b> <b>their</b> <b>neck,</b> keeping <b>their</b> hands free. Timex incorporated Anker's suggestions into the final product design.|$|R

50|$|Since this {{incident}} {{the people of}} Ghent have taken on the sobriquet stropdragers ("noose bearers").
