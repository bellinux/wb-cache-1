5|$|Halo Wars is a {{real-time}} strategy (RTS) {{video game}} developed {{exclusively for the}} Xbox 360 console, in which players command armies from <b>a</b> <b>bird's-eye</b> <b>view</b> of the battlefield. The game focuses on military combat, but contains streamlined resource management and base construction elements. It was designed with the Xbox 360 controller in mind; for example, the A button is used for selecting units. A single tap of the button selects one unit, while a double tap selects all units of the same type. The d-pad navigates to current battles and cycles through bases, while the right analog stick adjusts the camera angle. A radial menu is used for base construction.|$|E

The medieval urban conglomeration, today {{part of the old}} town Gamla stan, is rendered using <b>a</b> <b>bird's-eye</b> <b>view.</b> The stone and brick buildings are densely packed below the church and castle, which are rendered in a descriptive perspective (i.e., their size relates to their social status, rather than their actual dimensions). Scattered wooden structures appear on the surrounding rural ridges, today part of central Stockholm. Though the phenomenon is said to have occurred in the morning, the city is depicted in the evening with shadows facing east.|$|E

5|$|Halo Wars 2 is a {{real-time}} strategy (RTS) {{video game}} developed by 343 Industries and Creative Assembly. The game {{was published by}} Microsoft Studios and released in February 2017 on Windows-based personal computers (PCs) and the Xbox One video game console. The game {{is set in the}} science fiction universe of the Halo series in the year 2559, and is a sequel to the 2009 video game Halo Wars. The game sees the return of the human crew aboard the UNSC warship Spirit of Fire and introduces a new alien faction known as the Banished. A war between the two factions ensues on the Ark, a Forerunner installation. Gameplay in Halo Wars 2 builds upon the foundation established by its predecessor; players construct a base of operations and command armies from <b>a</b> <b>bird's-eye</b> <b>view</b> of the battlefield.|$|E
5|$|Mario Kart DS is {{a racing}} game, {{in which the}} player races in a kart against other racers as one of eight characters, each with three karts to choose from. While racing or battling, the Nintendo DS's top screen offers a third-person {{perspective}} of the player's kart, while the bottom touchscreen shows the race's current standings, items carried by each racer, and {{a map of the}} course. The bottom screen can be toggled to show either an overview of the entire course, or <b>a</b> <b>bird's-eye</b> <b>view</b> of the players kart and the immediate vicinity, including nearby racers, course hazards, item boxes, and incoming attacks. Each course features item boxes that the player can drive through to receive a randomly selected item, which the player can use to gain an advantage over other racers. Some items allow the player to attack other racers to slow them down, while other items can be used to speed up the player's own kart to pass other racers more easily.|$|E
5|$|Halo Wars 2 is a {{military}} science-fiction real-time strategy video game, in which players command armies from <b>a</b> <b>bird's-eye</b> <b>view</b> of the battlefield. The game can be played using a gamepad or using a mouse and keyboard. Like its predecessor Halo Wars, the game features two playable factions: humanity's main military arm, the United Nations Space Command (UNSC), who return from the first game, and a new alien faction known as the Banished, who serve as replacement for the Covenant. A story-based campaign mode lets players take control of UNSC forces in battles against the Banished on an ancient structure. The campaign consists of twelve missions that can be played alone or cooperatively. Each mission presents main objectives that involve capturing points, defending bases, or surviving waves of enemies, and often require the player to lead Spartan supersoldier units around the map. The campaign also features optional side objectives such as ensuring a certain unit survives {{over the course of}} a mission or destroying extra bases within a time limit. Animated cutscenes and dialogue precede each mission to provide context and integration with the game's story.|$|E

5|$|A {{sequel to}} Kameo was in {{production}} but was ultimately canceled. George Andreas {{began work on}} the sequel after finishing the first game. Kameo 2 {{was designed to be}} a darker take on the original. Rare redesigned Kameo to have smaller eyes and matured the other creatures. For instance, the trolls were given steampunk designs. The sequel put a heavier emphasis on the open world, as the team was influenced by Assassin's Creed (2007). Rare began to use Havok physics software for smoother inverse kinematics animations, and planned to incorporate assets from an unreleased game, Black Widow, which featured a giant, mechanical spider. For creature upgrades, the team planned to let Kameo fly as an eagle so the player could experience the grandeur of <b>a</b> <b>bird's-eye</b> <b>view.</b> Kameo composer Steve Burke said that he worked on the sequel for a year. He wrote several new audio tracks in a Celtic style and recorded voiceovers, which together were used in a concept demo pitched to Microsoft. The project was canceled after about three months of production as Rare re-focused on Microsoft's Kinect effort. At the time, Microsoft redirected its internal studios to support the project. The original's lackluster sales also contributed to the cancelation. The public had heard reports of its cancelation during the 2009 restructure and had seen an artwork leak in 2011, but the cancelation was not confirmed until Microsoft Studios vice president Phil Spencer did so in 2013. 1UP.com questioned whether Kameo needed a sequel at all. Rare released a retrospective documentary of the unreleased game as part of its August 2015 Rare Replay collection. A Kameo 2 concept artist narrated the documentary, which focuses on art that would have been included in the game apart from a brief video clip. Rare later released a follow-up making-of Kameo video in March 2016. The sequel's video did not elaborate on why Microsoft canceled the project.|$|E

The CDF {{is calculated based on}} Bayes rule using colors in two areas: a main {{area and a}} support area. We identify persons in the images captured with <b>a</b> <b>Bird's-eye</b> <b>views</b> system by using the CDF. The identification is carried out by estimating Bhattacharyya distance or Hamming distance between the registered CDF and the one obtained from the input images. We confirmed that our method can identify persons at video-rate by only using the color information of shoulders and heads, and without using any face-related information. We also confirmed that CDF can be used to identify multicolored objects...|$|R

He chose the Park Avenue Underpass in Trumbull with the Sport Hill Road Underpass and Morehouse Highway Underpass in the distance. The sketch, with Park Avenue as a focal point, was used {{on the cover of}} the 1940 Highway Commissioner's Biennial Report. The Park Avenue Underpass was also used to symbolize the Parkway on the state of Connecticut's Anniversary Plate issued in 1943.|$|E
25|$|Although {{spanning}} fifty years, {{the novel}} is not epic in scope, focusing instead on the small private details of the characters' lives. Except for the first, each section takes place on a single day of its titular year, and each year is defined by a particular moment in the cycle of seasons. At {{the beginning of each}} section, and sometimes as a transition within sections, Woolf describes the changing weather all over Britain, taking in both London and countryside as if in <b>a</b> <b>bird's-eye</b> <b>view</b> before focusing in on her characters. Although these descriptions move across the whole of England in single paragraphs, Woolf only rarely and briefly broadens her view to the world outside Britain.|$|E
25|$|Aerial {{survey is}} {{conducted}} using cameras attached to airplanes, balloons, UAVs, or even Kites. <b>A</b> <b>bird's-eye</b> <b>view</b> {{is useful for}} quick mapping of large or complex sites. Aerial photographs are used to document {{the status of the}} archaeological dig. Aerial imaging can also detect many things not visible from the surface. Plants growing above a buried man made structure, such as a stone wall, will develop more slowly, while those above other types of features (such as middens) may develop more rapidly. Photographs of ripening grain, which changes colour rapidly at maturation, have revealed buried structures with great precision. Aerial photographs taken at different times of day will help show the outlines of structures by changes in shadows. Aerial survey also employs ultraviolet, infrared, ground-penetrating radar wavelengths, LiDAR and thermography.|$|E

While working in Kunisada's studio Kunichika was assigned a commission to make a print illustrating <b>a</b> <b>bird's-eye</b> <b>view</b> of Tenjinbashi Avenue following the terrible earthquake of 1855 that destroyed most of the city. This assignment suggests that he was considered one of Kunisada's better students.|$|E

Scenes with local {{residents}} include a young Indian boy and children playing cricket. Azalea, in a gold bodysuit and Indian inspired clothing, slouches atop an Indian elephant. The song begins with Azalea and a troupe of female Indian dancers entering a darkened Bollywood {{set for a}} traditional Indian wedding. Azalea and the dancers, in traditional red saris with bindis, begin belly dancing and modernised Indian dance routines. The scene is intercut with snippets of Azalea walking and dancing in Mumbai's slums. On the Bollywood set, a large Indian family are seen celebrating, drinking and dancing. Azalea (in a green sari) dances in a garden, rides an elephant along city streets and travels in an auto rickshaw, wearing a printed silk blouse, with the wind blowing through her hair. Now in a blue sari, she lies on the elephant, gesturing with her hands and dancing next to Indian children on a cluttered platform.|$|E
500|$|Although Ensemble had {{to re-create}} all of Bungie's assets from scratch, Bungie had {{produced}} {{a large amount}} of reference material for the Halo film adaptation that the Halo Wars team used for inspiration. Another reference point was art from the Halo first-person shooters; however, as the art was from a forward perspective and Halo Wars takes place from <b>a</b> <b>bird's-eye</b> <b>view,</b> the team exaggerated shapes to make the units recognizable. Lead designer Graeme Devine noted that the Warthog Jeep is [...] "actually jumping three times as high as it does in Halo, and it goes four times faster than it does in Halo, and all these things—but it looks the same. Very different, between look and accuracy." [...] To ensure artistic continuity between Halo Wars and previous games in the series, Ensemble created a set of guidelines for their artists to follow; for example, the Covenant were to retain their curvy, organic look, while the Forerunner and UNSC were to keep the same geometry angles. UNSC structures and units were given a green tint, with gold specular highlights. The Covenant were textured with a repeating honeycomb pattern, with small blue lights against a purple base color.|$|E

2500|$|The Royal Academy Summer Exhibition of 1915 {{was noted}} for the paucity and general poor quality of {{paintings}} on war themes, but The Fighting-Line from Ypres to the Sea by W. L. Wyllie was {{noted for its}} bold experimentation in showing <b>a</b> <b>bird's-eye</b> <b>view</b> of war from an aeroplane. George Clausen's symbolist allegory Renaissance was the most memorable painting of that 1915 exhibition, contrasting ruins and oppression with dignity and optimism. When exhibited {{in the spring of}} 1916, Eric Kennington's portrayal of exhausted soldiers The Kensingtons at Laventie caused a sensation. [...] Painted in reverse on glass, the painting was widely praised for its technical virtuosity, iconic colour scheme, and its ‘stately presentation of human endurance, of the quiet heroism of the rank and file’. Kennington returned to the front in 1917 as an official war artist.|$|E
