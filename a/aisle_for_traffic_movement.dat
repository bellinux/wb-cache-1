40|$|Microscopic {{simulation}} of complex traffic models can take hours or even days on simulators build {{to run on}} a single processor machine. These simulators use continuous models <b>for</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>movement.</b> In this report, we introduce a discrete simulation system that models individual vehicles. Although we have abandoned the notion of continuous movement of vehicles, we achieve highly accurate results gained from our simulations of a road-merge bottleneck and a signalized junction. Our eventual target simulation platform is field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) which allow us to construct arbitrary random logic circuits. Discrete modelling is essential for efficient implementation on such devices. This paper describes preliminary work towards simulating road networks at high speed directly in hardware. ...|$|R

While the capacity maximization and cycle length minimization problems are formulated as Binary-Mix-Integer-Linear-Programs (BMILPs) that are solvable by standard branch-and-bound routines, the problem of delay minimization is formulated as a Binary-Mix-Integer-Non-Linear Program (BMINLP). A cutting plane algorithm and a heuristic line search algorithm are proposed to solve this difficult BMINLP problem.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a 2 D convergence density criterion for minimizing the total junction delay at isolated junctions in the lane-based optimization framework. The lane-based method integrates {{the design of}} lane markings and signal settings <b>for</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>movements</b> in a unified framework. The problem of delay minimization is formulated as a Binary Mix Integer Non Linear Program (BMINLP). A cutting plane algorithm {{can be applied to}} solve this difficult BMINLP problem by adding hyperplanes sequentially until sufficient numbers of planes are created in the form of solution constraints to replicate the original nonlinear surface in the solution space. A set of constraints is set up to ensure the feasibility and safety of the resultant optimized lane markings and signal settings. The main difficulty to solve this high-dimension nonlinear nonconvex delay minimization problem using cutting plane algorithm is the requirement of substantial computational efforts to reach a good-quality solution while approximating the nonlinear solution space. A new stopping criterion is proposed by monitoring a 2 D convergence density to obtain a converged solution. A numerical example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The cutting-plane algorithm producing an effective signal design will become more computationally attractive with adopting the proposed stopping criterion...|$|R

40|$|In {{isolated}} intersection’s actuated signal control, {{inductive loop}} detector layout {{plays a crucial role}} in providingthe vehicle information to the signal controller. Based on vehicle actuations at the detector, the green time is extended till a pre-defined threshold gap-out occurs. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) proposed various guidelines for detec-tor layouts on low-speed and high-speed approaches. This paper proposes single and multiple advance detection schemes <b>for</b> low-speed <b>traffic</b> <b>movements,</b> that utilizes vehicle actuations from advance detectors located upstream of the stop-line, which are able to detect spill-back queues. The proposed detection schemes operate with actuated signal control based on lane-by-lane gap-out criteria. The performance of the proposed schemes is compared with FHWA’s stop-line and single advance detection schemes in the VISSIM simulation tool. Results have shown that the proposed single advance detection schemes showed improved performance in reducing travel time delay and average number of stops per vehicle under low volumes while the multiple advance detection scheme performed well under high volumes...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{epidermal}} {{growth factor}} (EGF) transduces its actions via the EGF receptor (EGFR), which can traffic from the plasma membrane to either the cytoplasm or the nucleus. However, the mechanism by which EGFR reaches the nucleus is unclear. To investigate these questions, liver cells were analyzed by immunoblot of cell fractions, confocal immunofluorescence and real time confocal imaging. Cell fractionation studies showed that EGFR was detectable in the nucleus after EGF stimulation with a peak in nuclear receptor after 10 min. Movement of EGFR to the nucleus was confirmed by confocal immunofluorescence and labeled EGF moved with the receptor to the nucleus. Small interference RNA (siRNA) was used to knockdown clathrin {{in order to assess}} the first endocytic steps of EGFR nuclear translocation in liver cells. A mutant dynamin (dynamin K 44 A) was also used to determine the pathways <b>for</b> this <b>traffic.</b> <b>Movement</b> of labeled EGF or EGFR to the nucleus depended upon dynamin and clathrin.

40|$|This paper aims at {{understanding}} the behavioral pattern of traffic at Jibowu intersection {{with a view}} of using the results obtained as a model <b>for</b> understudying <b>traffic</b> <b>movement</b> at similar intersections in the Lagos metropolis. Consequently, an evaluation of the sampled intersections was carried out by employing a physical measurement of the layout, traffic volume at each turning point, and evaluating it against the back drop of traffic delays at the intersections. The paper reviews the traffic flow situation within the context of increasing motorization, poor infrastructural facilities and a continuous stream of traffic inflow. It highlights the problems with emphasis on the importance of signalization, land use, intersection design and traffic systems management. The paper concludes that most of the bottlenecks experienced at the intersection are man-induced. Rather than obeying traffic regulations, people act otherwise either out of ignorance or gross indiscipline. Secondly the paper posits that the land use allocation in the area should be reviewed especially with emphasis on discouraging the luxury bus operators from using the area as their base or Main Park. Although the paper did not fully measure the delay at the intersection, it has however set the stage for further investigations.

40|$|The current {{procedure}} in the Highway Capacity Manual 2000 for analyzing actuated signalized intersections treats pedestrian crossing and timing in a fixed manner, {{which can lead}} to erroneous results in capacity and delay calculations. This paper introduces a new model that remedies such a shortcoming in the {{current procedure}}. The model takes into account the stochastic nature of pedestrian crossings and their effects. The model consists of calculations of the probability of having a pedestrian call in a cycle, and the corresponding capacities and delays <b>for</b> the <b>traffic</b> <b>movements.</b> The model was compared with the SimTraffic simulation model based on a generic intersection with semi-actuated signal control, and was found to produce consistent delay results between the two models. Using the proposed model, the effects of pedestrians on intersection capacity and delay were analyzed. Depending on the pedestrian volume conditions, the current Highway Capacity Manual procedure could produce results of significant errors, with the largest errors possibly occurring under low pedestrian volume conditions. For the vehicle movement that is concurrent with the pedestrian movement, it generally receives more green time with the increase of pedestrian volumes; therefore, higher capacity and lower delay would result. Consequently, the other movements would experience capacity reduction and delay increase. One interesting finding from the study was that the concurrent vehicle movement can achieve a higher capacity with a shorter cycle length with the same pedestrian volumes...|$|R
