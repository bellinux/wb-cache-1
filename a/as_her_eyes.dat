5|$|Doggett and Scully are soon {{introduced}} to a strike-force that will be going into the subway to investigate. The group includes Steven Melnick, a structural engineer, and Dr. Hellura Lyle, CDC employee specializing in pathogens. Scully, however, decides the plan will work better if Doggett acts <b>as</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and ears while she analyzes the situation from up in the Transit Control Center. Using cameras and microphones, she will watch and hear what is happening. After the plans are made, Doggett leads the team into the dark tunnel.|$|E
25|$|During the search, {{outside the}} mansion, Briony catches {{a glimpse of}} a man assaulting Lola. Lola could not say who {{attacked}} her, <b>as</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> were covered. In the ensuing investigation, Briony insists she saw Robbie as the assailant with her very own eyes. She looks for the indecent note Robbie had sent Cecilia, and shows it to back up her testimony. Robbie is arrested and imprisoned.|$|E
500|$|Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), in the meantime, invites her {{co-workers}} to her {{art show}} after work. At the show, Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) {{and his partner}} Gil critique her art, with Gil dismissing it as [...] "motel art", not realizing that she is standing right behind them. None of her other co-workers show, leaving her feeling alienated and sad. Roy comes by and compliments her work, but obviously does so as a [...] "boyfriend's gesture" [...] with no sincere appreciation for art. The general attendees show little interest in her drawings, and she begins to doubt her abilities. As she begins to take her work down, Michael arrives, having been delayed by the trip {{back to the office}} to move Ryan's things. He expresses sincere awe for her work and asks to buy her drawing of the office building. Pam embraces him <b>as</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> tear up. Michael hangs Pam's drawing on the wall next to his office.|$|E

500|$|Vidya {{followed}} {{the success of}} Paa with the Vishal Bhardwaj-produced Ishqiya (2010), a black comedy directed by debutant Abhishek Chaubey; co-starring Naseeruddin Shah, Arshad Warsi, and Salman Shahid. Vidya's role {{was that of the}} sexually manipulative Krishna Verma. Vidya described her character as [...] "an epitome of grey" [...] and a departure from the conventional portrayal of women in cinema. In preparation for her part, she undertook professional training to speak in the local Uttar Pradesh-dialect. The feature as well as her performance received critical acclaim. Anupama Chopra of NDTV stated, [...] "Vidya Balan's smoldering looks scorch the screen even <b>as</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> hint at tragedy. She proves that she is miles ahead of the cookie cutter Barbie dolls that clutter Bollywood and that sensuality has {{very little to do with}} showing skin." [...] Her work in the film earned Vidya a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress, a second consecutive Best Actress award at Screen and a nomination for Best Actress at Filmfare.|$|E
2500|$|Documentary filmmaker Pennebaker {{inserted}} two cutaway {{shots of}} Cass Elliot of the Mamas & the Papas {{seated in the}} audience during Joplin's performance of [...] "Ball and Chain", one {{in the middle of}} the song <b>as</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> covered by sunglasses, are fixed on Joplin, and also a shot during the applause as she silently mouths [...] "Oh, wow!" [...] and looks at the person seated next to her. [...] Elliot and the audience are seen in sunlight, but Sunday's Big Brother performance was filmed in the evening. An explanation has come from Big Brother's road manager John Byrne Cooke, who remembers that Pennebaker discreetly filmed the audience (including Elliot) during Big Brother's Saturday performance when he was not allowed to point a camera at the band.|$|E

6000|$|... "No, sir," [...] she said, {{revealing}} {{the red and}} ivory of <b>her</b> mouth <b>as</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> lit in defiant triumph; [...] "not again, if I know it!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{seems like}} a place to find giants, not fairies, it is so high and big and splendid up here," [...] said Daisy, <b>as</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> roamed over river, forest, town, and hill.|$|R
6000|$|... "Erling, my boy," [...] {{she said}} suddenly, <b>as</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> {{fell on the}} axe at his side,--"what terrible weapon is this? Surely thou must have {{purchased}} Thor's hammer. Can ye wield such a thing?" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{snatched}} the roll from him, and <b>as</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> devoured the lines, her face fell in, {{and her lips}} grew pale with anguish.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, how pretty! Who sent them?" [...] asked Jill, eagerly, <b>as</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> glanced {{along the}} wall, seeing other new and {{interesting}} things beyond: an elephant-hunt, a ship in full sail, a horse-race, and a ball-room.|$|R
6000|$|... "An old man, {{and the cat}} is fond of him. I guess I'll dare to ask my way, or I'll {{never get}} home," [...] thought the girl, <b>as</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> scanned the new-comer with a woman's quickness.|$|R
60|$|Miss Muir, in the charmingly prim and puritanical {{dress of}} a Roundhead damsel, was {{arranging}} some shrubs, but turned suddenly {{and dropped the}} green branch she held, <b>as</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> met the glittering figure advancing toward her.|$|R
6000|$|... "I tied him--he's here somewhere--with the ponies," [...] stammered Bab, {{in sudden}} dismay, for {{no sign of}} a dog {{appeared}} <b>as</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> roved wildly to and fro.|$|E
6000|$|Grace {{had been}} looking at the ground all the while. Now she threw upon him one of her sudden, startled looks, and {{answered}} slowly, <b>as</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> dropped again: ...|$|E
60|$|She {{followed}} the others into the harness room, and <b>as</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> {{glanced around the}} walls, they rested upon a saddle hanging on its peg. Instantly she thought of something to say.|$|E
60|$|There she was mistaken, for <b>as</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> roved {{round the}} narrow {{room from the}} old hat on the wall to the curly heads bobbing here and there, contentment, piety, and mother-love made her plain face beautiful.|$|R
6000|$|... "I never shall suit this dear prim soul," [...] she thought, <b>as</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> {{went from}} Puss, sedately perched on one small mat, {{to the dog}} dozing upon another, and neither {{offering}} to stir from their own dominions.|$|R

60|$|When Jane Clayton regained {{consciousness}} she saw Anderssen standing over her, {{holding the baby}} in his arms. <b>As</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> rested upon them an expression of misery and horror overspread her countenance.|$|E
60|$|For ever {{afterwards}} he {{was glad}} of that single look of reproach which seemed to escape her unwittingly <b>as</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> met his. But she turned away and his heart was like a stone.|$|E
6000|$|... "Peril and I {{are well}} acquainted, my heart." [...] She {{lowered her voice}} <b>as</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> dilated, and she laid {{her hand on his}} arm. [...] "Thou wottest what is on London Bridge gates?" ...|$|E

60|$|Spite of the {{confidence}} about Emily, {{spite of all}} unreason, such was the family opinion of Fred's propensity to fall in love, that Albinia's first suspicion lighted upon him, but <b>as</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> fell on the pink envelope the handwriting concerned her even more nearly.|$|R
60|$|As he did so, his eye {{fell upon}} {{a girl of}} some {{seventeen}} years old. She {{was standing at the}} window, with her hands clasped. She turned round as he entered, and, <b>as</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> fell upon his uniform, she gave a cry of delight.|$|R

60|$|At {{the sound}} of his {{footstep}} she turned, and <b>as</b> <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> met the gray ones of the man she stood poised as though of half a mind to fly. For a moment neither spoke.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir; very, very pleasant, and I'll {{do my best}} to be a good patient. But I really don't {{think anyone}} could be sick in this {{delightful}} room," [...] she said, with a long sigh of happiness <b>as</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> went from one pleasant object to another.|$|R
5000|$|Yve Ngoo from BBC Tyne said in November 2006 that, [...] "A seductively {{intriguing}} {{cross between}} Marilyn Manson and Corries Hayley Cropper (Im alluding to ambiguous androgyny), Bethanys material is <b>as</b> black <b>as</b> <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> shadow and <b>her</b> delivery <b>as</b> dead-pan as a Goth at a garden centre." ...|$|R
