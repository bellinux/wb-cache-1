25|$|The point {{really about}} all this from our {{perspective}} {{has been that the}} critical role we should play is to assist the Zimbabweans to find each other, really to agree among themselves about the political, economic, social, other solutions that their country needs. We could have stepped aside from that task and then shouted, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> end of our contribution... They would shout back at us <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> end of the story. I'm actually the only head of government that I know anywhere in the world who has actually gone to Zimbabwe and spoken publicly very critically {{of the things that they}} are doing.|$|E

25|$|Those mining {{communities}} {{had good}} working class values {{and a sense}} of family values. The men did real men's heavy work going down the pit. There were also some very close-knit communities which were able to deal with the few troublesome kids. If they had any problems they would take the kid round the back and give them a good clip round the ear <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> end of that. Many of these communities were completely devastated, with people out of work turning to drugs and no real man's work because all the jobs had gone. There is no doubt that this led to a breakdown in these communities with families breaking up and youths going out of control. The scale of the closures went too far. The damage done to those communities was enormous {{as a result of the}} strike.|$|E

60|$|Poor Old Granny Fox! For once in {{her life}} she had been caught napping. She hadn't the least hope in the world. Farmer Brown's boy had only to fire that dreadful gun, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> end of her. She knew it.|$|E

60|$|Crispin obeyed him silently, {{and crossed}} the {{threshold}} to find himself within a mean, gloomy chamber, and to hear the heavy door closed and made fast again behind him.
