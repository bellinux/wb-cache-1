50|$|Doubled haploid (DH) {{plants have}} the {{potential}} to save much time in the development of inbred lines. This is achieved in a single generation, as opposed to many, which would otherwise occupy much physical space/facilities. DHs also express deleterious recessive alleles otherwise masked by dominance effects in a genome containing more than one copy of each chromosome (and thus more than one copy of each gene). Various techniques exist to create DHs. The in vitro culture of anthers and microspores is most often used in cereals, including triticale. These two techniques are referred to as <b>androgenesis,</b> which refers to the development of pollen. Many plant species and cultivars within species, including triticale, are recalcitrant in that the success rate of achieving whole newly generated (diploid) plants is very low. Genotype by culture medium interaction is responsible for varying success rates, as is a high degree of microspore abortion during culturing.(Johansson et al. 2000) The response of parental triticale lines to anther culture is known to be correlated to the response of their progeny. Chromosome elimination is another method of producing DHs, and involves hybridisation of wheat with maize (Zea mays L.), followed by auxin treatment and the artificial rescue of the resultant haploid embryos before they naturally abort. This technique is applied rather extensively to wheat. Its success is in large part due to the insensitivity of maize pollen to the crossability inhibitor genes known as Kr1 and Kr2 that are expressed in the floral style of many wheat cultivars. The technique is unfortunately less successful in triticale. However, Imperata cylindrica (a grass) was found to be just as effective as maize with respect to the production of DHs in both wheat and triticale.|$|E
40|$|Gynogenesis is {{a process}} in which the embryo genome {{originates}} exclusively from female origin, following embryogenesis stimulation by a male gamete. In contrast, <b>androgenesis</b> is the development of embryos that contain only the male nuclear genetic background. Both phenomena are of great interest in plant breeding as haploidisation is an efficient tool to reduce the length of breeding schemes to create varieties. Although few inducer lines have been described, the genetic control of these phenomena is poorly understood. We developed genetic screens to identify mutations that would induce gynogenesis or <b>androgenesis</b> in Arabidopsis thaliana. The ability of mutant pollen to induce either gynogenesis or <b>androgenesis</b> was tested by crossing mutagenized plants as males. Seedlings from these crosses were screened with recessive phenotypic markers, one genetically controlled by the female genome and another by the male genome. Positive and negative controls confirmed the unambiguous detection of both gynogenesis and <b>androgenesis</b> events. This strategy was applied to 1, 666 EMS-mutagenised lines and 47 distant Arabidopsis strains. While an internal control suggested that the mutagenesis reached saturation, no gynogenesis or <b>androgenesis</b> inducer was found. However, spontaneous gynogenesis was observed at a frequency of 1 / 10, 800.

40|$|Background: <b>Androgenesis</b> (all-male inheritance) is {{generally}} induced {{by means of}} irradiating the eggs to inactivate the maternal genome, followed by fertilization with normal sperm.

Results: When the eggs of wild-type females were fertilized with sperm of albino or orange phenotype males and cold-shocked at 0 to 3 Â°C for 60 min duration just after fertilization, generally more than 30 % (with a peak of 100 %) of the hatched progeny were androgenotes.

40|$|Barley <b>androgenesis</b> {{represents}} an attractive system to study stress-induced cell differentiation {{and is a}} valuable tool for efficient plant breeding. The switch from the pollen developmental pathway towards an androgenic route involves several well-described morphological changes. However, {{little is known about}} the pathways leading to embryo formation and about the transcriptome of androgenic microspores. The research described in this thesis aimed to identify new "bio-markers" for barley <b>androgenesis</b> induction and embryo development. The concept of a "bio-marker" is not a single gene, protein, metabolite or phenotype. It refers to the concept of understanding biological events, such as gene expression profiles or morphological changes at certain biological states. The work presented in this thesis has provided a substantial contribution towards understanding the mechanisms of <b>androgenesis</b> induction. The use of a cell tracking system in combination with biochemical markers has been crucial in pointing out that the morphology of embryogenic microspores, and in identifying programmed cell death as an integral part of the developmental pathway of androgenic embryos.

40|$|Different {{aspects of}} <b>androgenesis</b> {{induction}} {{have been studied}} in detail, but {{little is known about}} the molecular mechanisms associated with this developmental switch. We have employed macroarrays containing 1421 expressed sequence tags covering the early stages of barley zygotic embryogenesis to compare the gene expression profiles of stress-induced androgenic microspores with those of uninucleate microspores as they progressed into binucleate stage during pollen development. Principal component analysis defined distinct sets of gene expression profiles that were associated with <b>androgenesis</b> induction and pollen development. During pollen development, uninucleate microspores were characterized by the expression of cell division-related genes and transcripts involved in lipid biosynthesis. Progress into binucleate stage resulted in the significant increase in the level of transcripts associated with starch biosynthesis and energy production. These transcripts were downregulated in androgenic microspores. These results indicate that stress blocks the expression of pollen-related genes. The induction of <b>androgenesis</b> by stress was marked by the upregulation of transcripts involved in sugar and starch hydrolysis, proteolysis, stress response, inhibition of programmed cell death, and signaling. Further expression analysis revealed that the induction of genes encoding alcohol dehydrogenase 3, metalloprotease FtsH, cysteine protease 1 precursor, phytepsin precursor (aspartic protease), and a 26 S proteasome regulatory subunit was associated with the androgenic potential of microspores, whereas the induction of transcripts involved in signaling and cytoprotection was associated with stress responses.

L. multiflorum cultivars Felopa, Sulino, and Rakopan were studied over 3 years (1999 ? 2002) in a field experiment at Lopuszna, Poland (2008 E, 4928 N, altitude 568 m). The results indicate that despite differences in winter hardiness between the three amphidiploid cultivars, the mean winter hardiness of androgenic progeny from each cultivar was the same. Thus an <b>androgenesis</b> component in a plant breeding programme may {{provide an opportunity to}} recover winter hardy genotypes from high yielding cultivars that are themselves adapted poorly to stress conditions. <b>Androgenesis</b> also evoked variation in snow mould resistance. In this case, androgenic plants with the greatest snow mould resistance were recovered from the least winter hardy donor cultivars and plants. The results indicated the low importance of snow mould resistance as a component of winter hardiness under the field conditions used for these experiments. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Doubled haploid {{lines of}} carrot can be {{obtained}} through <b>androgenesis</b> in anther cultures and in isolated microspore cultures. The two methods were compared using three carrot cultivars (âKazan F 1 â, âFeria F 1 â, and âNarbonne F 1 â) at the <b>androgenesis</b> induction stage, during plant regeneration from embryos, and during acclimatization of androgenetic plants {{as well as their}} characterization. It was found that cultivar was the main factor affecting the efficiency at each stage of plant production in both anther and isolated microspore cultures. The efficiency of <b>androgenesis</b> in anther cultures of âFeria F 1 â was considerably higher in comparison with isolated microspore cultures, and more plants were obtained from the embryos of androgenesis-cultured plants. In âKazan F 1 â and âNarbonne F 1 â, more acclimatized androgenetic plants were produced from anther cultures. Ploidy assessment of acclimatized plants of âNarbonne F 1 â showed {{that the majority of the}} plants in the population derived from anther cultures had a doubled chromosome (DH) set. On the other hand, the majority of plants obtained from isolated microspore cultures were haploids. When assessing homozygosity, it was found among plants obtained in anther cultures that the percentage of homozygotes for phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) and aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) depended on the cultivar. In contrast, the majority of plants derived from isolated microspore cultures were homozygous regardless of cultivar...|$|E
