25|$|In a rare {{resurgence}} of democratic action at Rome, Gracchus used the concilium plebis, the old popular assembly {{which had become}} largely dormant, to bypass senatorial opposition and force passage of his Lex Sempronia <b>Agraria</b> (133 BC), which confirmed an earlier law limiting holdings of public land to 500 iugera (modified by allowing the sons of landowners 250 iugera), limited pasturing-rights to 100 cattle or 500 sheep and, most importantly, ensured enforcement by creating a triumviral Land Commission to repossess and redistribute landholdings {{in excess of the}} limit.|$|E
25|$|The oldest {{university}} is the University of Coimbra founded in 1290. The largest university, by number of enrolled students, is the University of Porto - with approximately 28,000 students.

A few polytechnical higher education institutions, though formed as such in the 1980s, {{have their origin in}} 19th century educational institutions - this is the case of the Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa, the Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto and the Escola Superior <b>Agrária</b> de Coimbra.|$|E
25|$|Rodezno and {{his wife}} held land estates {{scattered}} across Spain: in Navarre, Extremadura and Andalusia. Some authors refer to him as “grande terrateniente” “cacique terrateniente”, “grandee proprietor” or “prominent landowner”, an exemplary case of link between landownership and power, though exact size of his holdings is unclear and probably did not exceed 500 ha combined. He was head of Federacion Catolico <b>Agraria</b> de Navarra, co-founder of Asociación de Terratenientes de Navarra and member of Asociacion de Propietarios de Alcornocales. On behalf {{of some of these}} pressure groups he held talks with various ministers, publishing also analytical studies on agricultural credit and land ownership. In his opinion in terms of rural property the Navarrese structure was close to ideal, almost reaching the objective “que todos los agricultores fueran propietarios”.|$|E

25|$|Many farmers {{around the}} world are unaware of fair trade {{practices}} that they could be implementing to earn a higher wage. Coffee {{is one of the most}} highly traded commodities in the world, yet the farmers who grow it typically earn less than $2 a day. When surveyed, farmers from Cooperativa <b>Agraria</b> Cafetalera Pangoa (CAC Pangoa) in San Martín de Pangoa, Peru, could answer positively that they have heard about fair trade, but were not able to give a detailed description about what fair trade is. They could, however, identify fair trade based on some of its possible benefits to their community. When asked, overall, farmers cited that fair trade has had a positive effect on their lives and communities. They also wanted consumers to know that fair trade is important for supporting their families and their cooperatives.|$|E

2500|$|He {{went on to}} {{undergraduate}} {{studies at}} the Universidad Nacional <b>Agraria</b> La Molina in 1957, graduating in 1961 first in his class as an agricultural engineer. The following year he lectured on mathematics at the university. In 1964 he went to study physics at the University of Strasbourg in France. On a Ford scholarship, Fujimori also attended the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee in the United States, where he obtained his master's degree in mathematics in 1969. In 1974, he married Susana Higuchi, also a Peruvian of Japanese descent. They had four children, including a daughter, Keiko, who followed her father into politics. In recognition of his academic achievements, the sciences faculty of the Universidad Nacional <b>Agraria</b> offered Fujimori the deanship and in 1984 appointed him to the rectorship of the university, which he held until 1989. In 1987, Fujimori also {{became president of the}} National Commission of Peruvian University Rectors (Asamblea Nacional de Rectores), a position which he has held twice. He also hosted a TV show called [...] "Concertando" [...] from 1987 to 1989, on Peru's state-owned network, Channel 7.|$|E

The Catholic University of Portugal, the oldest non-state-run university (concordat status), was instituted by decree of the Holy See and is recognized by the Portuguese State since 1971. The current public polytechnic subsystem was founded in the 1980s, but is an evolution of previous systems of higher vocational education that existed before. So, although only integrated in the system in the 1980s, several polytechnic institutions are much older, some having their origins back to the 19th century (examples are the Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa, the [...] Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto and the Escola Superior <b>Agrária</b> de Coimbra).|$|E
2500|$|M. Baebius Tamphilus was a tribune of the plebs in 194. 2.585. Broughton {{notes that}} the Lex <b>agraria</b> of 111 names a M.

Giovanni Niccolini, in I fasti dei tribuni della plebe (Milan 1934), the standard work of tribunicial prosopography, regards this as uncertain.
