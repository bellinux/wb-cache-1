5|$|After {{turning down}} offers from IBM and the Brookhaven National Laboratory, Segrè {{returned}} to Berkeley in 1952. He {{moved his family}} from Berkeley to nearby Lafayette, California, in 1955. Working with Chamberlain and others, he began searching for the antiproton, a subatomic <b>antiparticle</b> of the proton. The <b>antiparticle</b> of the electron, the positron had been predicted by Paul Dirac in 1931 and then discovered by Carl D. Anderson in 1932. By analogy, it was now expected {{that there would be}} an <b>antiparticle</b> corresponding to the proton, but no one had found one, and even in 1955 some scientists doubted that they existed. Using Lawrence's Bevatron set to 6GeV, they managed to detect conclusive evidence of antiprotons. Chamberlain and Segrè were awarded the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery. This was controversial, because Clyde Wiegand and Thomas Ypsilantis were co-authors of the same article, but did not share the prize.|$|E
5|$|Ballistic {{annihilation}} {{describes a}} {{process by which}} moving particles and antiparticles annihilate each other when they collide. In the simplest version of this process, the system consists of a single type of particle and <b>antiparticle,</b> moving at equal speeds in opposite directions in a one-dimensional medium.|$|E
5|$|Emilio Gino Segrè (1 February 1905 – 22 April 1989) was an Italian-American {{physicist}} and Nobel laureate, {{who discovered the}} elements technetium and astatine, and the antiproton, a subatomic <b>antiparticle,</b> {{for which he was}} awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1959.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{particles}} and their <b>antiparticles</b> have opposite charges, electrically neutral particles {{need not be}} identical to their <b>antiparticles.</b> The neutron, for example, {{is made out of}} quarks, the antineutron from antiquarks, and they are distinguishable from one another because neutrons and antineutrons annihilate each other upon contact. However, other neutral particles are their own <b>antiparticles,</b> such as photons, Z0 bosons, [...] mesons, and hypothetical gravitons and some hypothetical WIMPs.|$|R
40|$|<b>Antiparticles</b> are {{a crucial}} {{ingredient}} of particle physics and cosmology. Almost 80 years after Dirac’s bold prediction {{and the subsequent}} discovery of the positron in 1932, <b>antiparticles</b> {{are still in the}} spotlight of modern physics. This lecture for non-specialists will start with a theoretical and historical introduction. Why are <b>antiparticles</b> needed? When and how were they discovered? Why is the (CPT) symmetry between particles and <b>antiparticles</b> so fundamental? What is their role in cosmology? The second part will give an overview about the many aspects of <b>antiparticles</b> in experimental physics: their production, their use in colliders; as a probe inside atoms or nuclei; or as an object to study fundamental symmetries. In the third part, the lecture will focus on results and challenges of the “antimatter” programme at the Antiproton Decelerator (AD), with special emphasis on antihydrogen production, trapping and precision measurements...|$|R

5|$|Since baryons are {{composed}} of quarks, they participate in the strong interaction. Leptons, on the other hand, are not composed of quarks and as such {{do not participate in}} the strong interaction. The most famous baryons are the protons and neutrons that make up most of the mass of the visible matter in the universe, whereas electrons, the other major component of atoms, are leptons. Each baryon has a corresponding <b>antiparticle</b> known as an antibaryon in which quarks are replaced by their corresponding antiquarks. For example, a proton is made of two up quarks and one down quark, while its corresponding <b>antiparticle,</b> the antiproton, is made of two up antiquarks and one down antiquark.|$|E
5|$|Photons are emitted in many natural processes. For example, when {{a charge}} is {{accelerated}} it emits synchrotron radiation. During a molecular, atomic or nuclear {{transition to a}} lower energy level, photons of various energy will be emitted, ranging from radio waves to gamma rays. Photons can also be emitted when a particle and its corresponding <b>antiparticle</b> are annihilated (for example, electron–positron annihilation).|$|E
5|$|This {{process can}} be modeled by Rule 184, as follows. The {{particles}} are modeled as points that are aligned, not with {{the cells of the}} automaton, but rather with the interstices between cells. Two consecutive cells that both have state 0 model a particle at the space between these two cells that moves rightwards one cell at each time step. Symmetrically, two consecutive cells that both have state 1 model an <b>antiparticle</b> that moves leftwards one cell at each time step. The remaining possibilities for two consecutive cells are that they both have differing states; this is interpreted as modeling a background material without any particles in it, through which the particles move. With this interpretation, the particles and antiparticles interact by ballistic annihilation: when a rightwards-moving particle and a leftwards-moving <b>antiparticle</b> meet, the result is a region of background from which both particles have vanished, without any effect on any other nearby particles.|$|E
40|$|The {{nature of}} {{antimatter}} is {{examined in the}} context of algebraic quantum field theory. It is shown that the notion of antimatter is more general than that of <b>antiparticles.</b> Properly speaking, then, antimatter is not matter made up of <b>antiparticles</b> [...] rather, <b>antiparticles</b> are particles made up of antimatter. We go on to discuss whether the notion of antimatter is itself completely general in quantum field theory. Does the matter-antimatter distinction apply to all field theoretic systems? The answer depends on which of several possible criteria we should impose on the space of physical states...|$|R
30|$|We {{should also}} {{consider}} the statistical factors [22] in our systems under study {{due to the fact}} we have identical particles or <b>antiparticles.</b> This means that we should not double count the states of identical particles [22]. For the case where n is an even number, the statistical factor is 1 /(n/ 2)!× 1 /(n/ 2)!. For examples, if we have four- and six-body systems consisting of two particles–two <b>antiparticles</b> and three particles–three <b>antiparticles,</b> respectively, we will have the following statistical factors for four-body and six-body systems, respectively: 1 / 2 !× 1 / 2 ! and 1 / 3 !× 1 / 3 !.|$|R
50|$|Simply speaking, charge {{conjugation}} is a symmetry between particles and <b>antiparticles,</b> and so CP-symmetry was proposed in 1957 by Lev Landau {{as the true}} symmetry between matter and antimatter.In other words, {{a process in which}} all particles are exchanged with their <b>antiparticles</b> was assumed to be equivalent to the mirror image of the original process.|$|R
5|$|The {{charge on}} {{electrons}} and protons is opposite in sign, hence {{an amount of}} charge may be expressed as being either negative or positive. By convention, the charge carried by electrons is deemed negative, and that by protons positive, a custom that originated {{with the work of}} Benjamin Franklin. The amount of charge is usually given the symbol Q and expressed in coulombs; each electron carries the same charge of approximately −1.6022×10−19coulomb. The proton has a charge that is equal and opposite, and thus +1.6022×10−19 coulomb. Charge is possessed not just by matter, but also by antimatter, each <b>antiparticle</b> bearing an equal and opposite charge to its corresponding particle.|$|E
5|$|There are six {{types of}} quarks, known as flavors: up, down, strange, charm, top, and bottom. Up and down quarks {{have the lowest}} masses of all quarks. The heavier quarks rapidly change into up and down quarks {{through a process of}} {{particle}} decay: the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state. Because of this, up and down quarks are generally stable and the most common in the universe, whereas strange, charm, bottom, and top quarks can only be produced in high energy collisions (such as those involving cosmic rays and in particle accelerators). For every quark flavor there is a corresponding type of <b>antiparticle,</b> known as an antiquark, that differs from the quark only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign.|$|E
25|$|Each baryon has a {{corresponding}} <b>antiparticle</b> (antibaryon) where quarks {{are replaced by}} their corresponding antiquarks. For example, a proton is made of two up quarks and one down quark; and its corresponding <b>antiparticle,</b> the antiproton, is made of two up antiquarks and one down antiquark.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the problem}} of {{infinite}} charge of the universe remains. Also, as we now know, bosons also have <b>antiparticles,</b> but since bosons do not obey the Pauli exclusion principle (only fermions do), hole theory does not work for them. A unified interpretation of <b>antiparticles</b> is now available in quantum field theory, which solves both these problems.|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} that the Chern-Simons topological term {{coefficient}} essentially depends on a chemical potential. In particular, {{when the number of}} particles exceeds that of <b>antiparticles</b> in background it can even disappear. On the other hand, when <b>antiparticles</b> prevail particles it does not vanish and at high densities even doubles. This result holds in any odd dimension...|$|R
5000|$|Now a {{large number}} of {{particles}} and (non-fundamental) interactions is explained as combinations of a (relatively) small number of fundamental substances, thought to be fundamental interactions (incarnated in fundamental bosons), quarks (including <b>antiparticles),</b> and leptons (including <b>antiparticles).</b> As the theory distinguished several fundamental interactions, it became possible to see which elementary particles participate in which interaction. Namely: ...|$|R
25|$|For every lepton flavor {{there is}} a {{corresponding}} type of <b>antiparticle,</b> known as an antilepton, that differs from the lepton only in that some of its properties have equal magnitude but opposite sign. According to certain theories, neutrinos may be their own <b>antiparticle.</b> It is not currently known whether this is the case.|$|E
25|$|The {{antineutrino}} {{discovered by}} Cowan and Reines is the <b>antiparticle</b> {{of the electron}} neutrino.|$|E
25|$|Antimatter {{particles}} bind {{with one}} another to form antimatter, just as ordinary particles bind to form normal matter. For example, a positron (the <b>antiparticle</b> of the electron) and an antiproton (the <b>antiparticle</b> of the proton) can form an antihydrogen atom. Physical principles indicate that complex antimatter atomic nuclei are possible, as well as anti-atoms corresponding to the known chemical elements.|$|E
40|$|Relativistic <b>antiparticles</b> can {{be created}} in high-energy nuclear interactions; thus, {{detection}} of <b>antiparticles</b> in an astrophysical source can tell us something remarkable about the underlying high-energy processes and nuclear interactions. However, once created, the <b>antiparticles</b> remain a minor fraction of their conjugant normal particles, so the detection of the <b>antiparticles</b> represents a big science challenge. To address this challenge we employ imaging and polarimetry of microwave radiation produced as the positrons gyrate in the ambient magnetic field. The key property of the radiation used in this method is that the oppositely charged particles, electrons and positrons, produce radiation with opposite helicity, easily distinguishable by currently operating radio facilities. Analysis of available spatially resolved microwave data augmented by independent magnetic field measurements allows us to remotely detect the relativistic positron component in several solar flares.

30|$|As {{it can be}} seen, {{for example}} in [21], the {{description}} of interactions {{of two or more}} than two bodies with equal or comparable masses is much more demanding than the case of particles with non-identical masses. We cannot generally differentiate between the test particles or <b>antiparticles</b> and the source of the field for the case of equal or comparable masses. Furthermore, we should consider all particles on an equal footing. Moreover, the interactions among particles or <b>antiparticles</b> do not propagate with infinite velocity. Therefore, there are further complications for the treatment of interactions among particles or <b>antiparticles.</b> These phenomena lead to the terms corresponding to “retardation effects”.|$|R
25|$|The {{antiproton}} is the <b>antiparticle</b> of the proton. It {{was discovered}} by University of California, Berkeley physicists Thomas Ypsilantis, Emilio Segrè, Clyde Wiegand, and Owen Chamberlain in 1955.|$|E

25|$|Since the Higgs {{field is}} scalar, the Higgs boson has no spin. The Higgs boson is also its own <b>antiparticle</b> and is CP-even, and has zero {{electric}} and colour charge.|$|E
5000|$|Classical {{theories}} of repulsive gravity {{have been published}} by Santilli and Villata. Both theories are extensions of General Relativity, and are experimentally indistinguishable. The general idea remains that gravity is the deflection of a continuous particle trajectory due to the curvature of spacetime, but <b>antiparticles</b> now 'live' in an inverted spacetime. The equation of motion for <b>antiparticles</b> is then obtained from the equation of motion of ordinary particles by applying the C, P, and T-operators (Villata) or by applying isodual maps (Santilli), which amounts to the same thing: the equation of motion for <b>antiparticles</b> then predicts a repulsion of matter and antimatter. It {{has to be taken}} that the observed trajectories of <b>antiparticles</b> are projections on our spacetime of the true trajectories in the inverted spacetime. However, it has been argued on methodological and ontological grounds that the area of application of Villata’s theory cannot be extended to include the microcosmos. These objections were subsequently dismissed by Villata.|$|R

25|$|The Dirac equation, {{formulated}} by Paul Dirac around 1928 {{as part of}} the development of relativistic quantum mechanics, predicts the existence of antiparticles along with the expected solutions for the corresponding particles. Since then, experiments have verified that every known kind of particle has a corresponding <b>antiparticle.</b> Under the CPT theorem, a particle and its <b>antiparticle</b> have the same mass and lifetime, and opposite charge. Given this symmetry, it is puzzling that the universe does not have equal amounts of matter and antimatter. Indeed, there is no experimental evidence that there are any significant concentrations of antimatter in the observable universe.|$|E
25|$|The {{charge of}} an <b>antiparticle</b> equals {{that of the}} {{corresponding}} particle, but with opposite sign. Quarks have fractional charges of either − or +, but free-standing quarks have never been observed (the theoretical reason for this fact is asymptotic freedom).|$|E
25|$|The antineutron is the <b>antiparticle</b> of the neutron. An antineutron has {{the same}} mass as a neutron, and no net {{electric}} charge. However, it is different from a neutron by being composed of anti-quarks, rather than quarks. It was discovered by Bruce Cork, William Wenzell, Glenn Lambertson, and Oreste Piccioni in 1956.|$|E
50|$|It is {{difficult}} to directly observe gravitational forces at the particle level. For charged particles, the electromagnetic force overwhelms the much weaker gravitational interaction. Even <b>antiparticles</b> in neutral antimatter, such as antihydrogen, must be kept separate from {{their counterparts in the}} matter that forms the experimental equipment, which requires strong electromagnetic fields. These fields, e.g. in the form of atomic traps, exert forces on these <b>antiparticles</b> which easily overwhelm the gravitational force of Earth and nearby test masses. Since all production methods for <b>antiparticles</b> result in high-energy antimatter particles, the necessary cooling for observation of gravitational effects in a laboratory environment requires very elaborate experimental techniques and very careful control of the trapping fields.|$|R
