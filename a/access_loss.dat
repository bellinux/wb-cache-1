40|$|Background. Surgery is an {{established}} treatment for stenosed and thrombosed forearm arteriovenous fistu-lae (AVFs), but {{the literature on}} its outcome is limited. We report our experience of the surgical repair of stenosis in patent and thrombosed forearm AVFs and evaluate the outcome of two procedures, proximal neo-anastomosis (NEO) vs replacement of the stenosed segment with a polytetrafluoroethylene graft interposi-tion (GI). Methods. Sixty-four stenosed forearm AVFs underwent surgery, 32 pre-emptively and 32 post-thrombosis. End points {{of the study were}} initial success, restenosis and <b>access</b> <b>loss</b> rates. After treatment, AVFs were surveilled for restenosis by measuring access flow quarterly and performing at least one follow-up angiogram. Results. Initial procedural success was 92 %; 100 % for patent and 84 % for thrombosed AVFs. The restenosis rate was 0. 189 events/AVF-year for both patent and thrombosed AVFs, while the <b>access</b> <b>loss</b> rate was 0. 016 events/AVF-year in patent and 0. 148 in throm-bosed AVFs. Stenosis was corrected by NEO in 27 AVFs and by GI in 30. The restenosis and <b>access</b> <b>loss</b> rates were 0. 151 vs 0. 214 and 0. 033 vs 0. 019 events/ AVF-year for NEO vs GI, respectively. At Cox’s hazard analysis, no variable was significantly associated with restenosis, while the timing of inter-vention was the only significant determinant of <b>access</b> <b>loss,</b> repaired clotted accesses carrying an 8. 0 -fold relative risk of <b>access</b> <b>loss</b> compared with patent AVFs (P 0. 048). Conclusion. Our study shows that surgery remains a valid option for the pre-emptive repair of stenosis and to salvage clotted forearm AVFs, offering an excellent initial success rate and low restenosis rate. It confirms that it is better to treat stenosis pre-emptively than post-thrombosis (though the restenosis rate appears to be uninfluenced by the timing of intervention) and suggests that GI compares favourably with conventional NEO...|$|E

The efforts of biosecurity have capability to anticipate the potential probability of releasing biohazard agent from the laboratory, the risk assessment study in the infectious disease laboratories was an effort to know whether biosecurity measures were applied in the laboratory. The usage of modified checklist questionnaire of biosecurity for collecting data and observation was done to identify potential hazard in the infectious disease laboratories according to the conceptional framework of agent, host and environmental principal. The places of this assessment are in the five regional referral infectious disease laboratories, i. e., Universitas Islam Sumatera Utara (UISU) Medan, Universitas Indonesia (UI) - Jakarta, Balai Pengembangan Laboratorium Kesehatan (BPLK) - Bandung, Universitas Diponegoro (UNDIP) - Semarang, Universitas Hasanudin (UNHAS) - Makassar, one referral hospital, i. e., Rumah Sakit Umum Daerah (RSUD) - Tangerang and one national referral laboratory of Center for Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Research and Development, National Institute of Health Research and Development (NIHRD), Ministry of Health (MOH), Jakarta. The risk assessment study was done in year 2008 - 2009. Physical security, personnel management and information security as components of biosecurity were not applied properly in the 7 infectious disease laboratories.

40|$|BackgroundForearm artery lesions are a {{frequent}} cause of distal fistula maturation failure. Surgical treatment {{is difficult because}} of highly calcified arteries. To redo the arteriovenous anastomosis higher up the forearm is technically difficult and often ineffective because arteries cannot be enlarged. It also causes a loss in puncture zone. Creation of brachial accesses leads to {{a high risk of}} distal ischemia. MethodsFrom September 2000 to September 2006, we performed percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of forearm arteries in 25 patients with failing distal access maturation. We reported immediate results of the dilatation and retrospectively analyzed the outcome of the accesses after the procedure. ResultsForearm artery PTA was achieved in all 25 patients. Three main complications occurred: severe spasms precluding precise assessment of the artery patency after dilatation, rupture easily treated by prolonged low-pressure balloon inflation, and early rethrombosis leading to <b>access</b> <b>loss.</b> Follow-up was available in 23 patients. PTA failed to restore a sufficient access flow in two patients (the <b>access</b> <b>loss</b> and an insufficient increase in flow). In the remaining 21 (91 %), accesses started to be used for hemodialysis without difficulties. Primary patency access rates after PTA were 83 % (range, 60 %- 93 %) at 1 year and 74 % (range, 47 %- 89 %) at 2 years. Secondary access patency rates were 86 % (range, 64 %- 95 %) at 1 and 3 years. ConclusionWhen a distal access fails to mature because of forearm artery lesions, PTA should be done and will salvage the fistula without risk of distal ischemia and cardiac failure. Efficacy of PTA clearly influences surgical strategy and is a major argument in favor of attempting to create distal accesses in patients with mild distal artery lesions. Even in cases of failure, such as early occlusion of the fistula, this technique does not jeopardize further proximal access creation. Forearm access creation should be avoided only in cases of extremely severe distal artery lesions...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDialysis access–associated steal {{syndrome}} (DASS) is an uncommon complication after {{the creation of}} an arteriovenous fistula and can cause irreversible ischemic damage in severe cases.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveSuccessful access {{cannulation}} is {{of utmost}} importance for adequate hemodialysis treatment. Upper arm fistulae, obesity and deep or tortuous veins may impair needling and can cause significant complications and inconvenience for the patient. In the ultimate case, cannulation problems lead to temporary central vein catheter use for dialysis or even to irreversible <b>access</b> <b>loss.</b> Surgical access revision may enhance successful cannulation. MethodsA systematic literature review of all publications related to hemodialysis vascular access, cannulation complications and treatment was performed. ResultsA total of 384 publications were identified, of which only 17 were related to treatment of cannulation complications in large patient populations. The clinical success rate of surgical intervention with vein elevation or transposition ranges from 85 % to 91 %. The 1 -year primary and secondary patencies are 60 % and 71 %, respectively. Lipectomy results in an initial success rate of 100 % with a primary and secondary patency of 71 % and 98 %, respectively, after 1 year of follow-up.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new one-parameter family of risk {{measures}} called Conditional Drawdown (CDD). These measures of risk are functionals {{of the portfolio}} drawdown (underwater) curve considered in an active portfolio management. For some value of the tolerance parameter α, {{in the case of}} a single sample path, drawdown functional is defined as the mean of the worst (1 − α) ∗ 100 % drawdowns. The CDD measure generalizes the notion of the drawdown functional to a multi-scenario case. The CDD measure includes the Maximal Drawdown and Average Drawdown as its limiting cases. We studied mathematical properties of the CDD and developed efficient optimization techniques for CDD computation and solving asset allocation problems with CDD measure. For a particular example, we find the optimal portfolios for a case of Maximal Drawdown, a case of Average Drawdown, and several intermediate cases between these two. The CDD family of risk functionals is similar to Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR), which is also called Mean Shortfall, Mean <b>Access</b> <b>loss,</b> or Tail Value-at-Risk.

40|$|Abstract: Arteriovenous fistula is {{considered}} the “ideal vascular access ” in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD); however, its creation is not without complications. Aneurysmal dilatation is a poorly defined complication which, can potentially lead to <b>access</b> <b>loss</b> and life threatening hemorrhage. Increased venous pressure due to proximal venous stenosis along with repeated cannulations at the same site, are thought to {{play a significant role}} in pathogenesis. Given risk of substantial bleeding, it is recommended to avoid cannulation of aneurysmal area; however, as seen in our patient significant numbers of ESRD patients are at risk of being cannulated in the aneurysmal area. Nephrologist taking care of ESRD patients should be aware of its wide clinical spectrum along with signs of “unstable aneurysms ” that would mandate an emergent surgical referral. Fistulogram often identifies a high grade proximal stenosis which can be treated by percutaneous angioplasty and perhaps halt the aneurysm progression. Although, endovascular interventions with stent graft placement can be considered in those with pseudoaneurysms related to arteriovenous grafts, it is often an interim measure in an attempt to prolong access longevity. With new surgical techniques and enhanced expertise, it is now possible to salvage the current AV access while simultaneously preserving the precious venous capital for the future AV accesses...|$|E
40|$|Transforming {{growth factor}} β 1 {{genotype}} polymorphisms determine AV fistula patency in hemodialysis patients. BackgroundIn hemodialysis patients with an arteriovenous (AV) fistula, access failure is {{primarily due to}} fistula stenosis, which predisposes to thrombosis and subsequent <b>access</b> <b>loss.</b> The risk for access failure differs interindividually, an observation that is independent from vascular anatomy in {{a significant number of}} patients. Fistula stenosis is histologically characterized by intimal hyperplasia, which is induced by growth factors, among which transforming growth factor β 1 (TGF-β 1) is of major importance. The quantitative production of TGF-β 1 interindividually differs due to polymorphisms in the gene region encoding the signal sequence of the cytokine. We hypothesized that the TGF-β 1 genotype, by influencing the development of arteriovenous fistula stenosis, determines the risk for vascular access failure. MethodsOne hundred twenty patients who had undergone placement of an AV fistula for initiation of hemodialysis treatment were genotyped for the polymorphic bases at position + 869 and + 915 of the TGF-β 1 gene. The primary end-point was time from fistula placement to access failure. ResultsAV fistula patency was significantly associated with the TGF-β 1 genotype (P = 0. 0046); patency was 62. 4 % and 81. 2 % after 12 months for TGF-β 1 high and intermediate producers, respectively. In contrast, AV fistula patency neither differed between diabetic and nondiabetic patients, nor between patients with and without manifest cardiovascular disease. ConclusionPolymorphisms in the gene region encoding the signal sequence of TGF-β 1 influence the risk for hemodialysis access failure. By inducing synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins, overproduction of TGF-β 1 may accelerate the development of intimal hyperplasia, resulting in fistula stenosis and subsequent access failure...|$|E

No prospective comparative trials between the two {{have been reported to}} date, however. A retrospective analysis of prospectively, concurrently collected data was performed to compare the outcome and cost of surgery and PTA in the preemptive repair of juxta-anastomotic stenosis in lower forearm AVF. Sixty-four AVF with> 50 % venous juxta-anastomotic stenosis were considered: 21 were treated surgically (11 proximal neo-anastomosis and 10 polytetrafluoroethylene interposition graft) and 43 by PTA. After treatment, AVF were monitored by quarterly ultrasound dilution access blood flow measurement. End points were restenosis and procedure failure rate (re-intervention by another technique or <b>access</b> <b>loss),</b> and determinants were analyzed using Cox hazard model. Initial procedural success was 100 % for surgery and 95 % for PTA (P 0. 539). Restenosis rate was 0. 168 and 0. 519 events/AVF-year for surgery and PTA, respectively (P 0. 009). The type of procedure was the only variable that was significantly associated with restenosis, the adjusted relative risk being 2. 77 -fold higher (95 % confidence interval 1. 07 to 7. 17; P 0. 036) after PTA than surgery. The procedure failure rate was 0. 110 and 0. 097 events/AVF-year for surgery and PTA, respectively (P 0. 736). The cost profile also was similar for the two procedures.

Recurrent catheter-related thrombosis (CRT) is common, leading to infectious complications, pulmonary embolism, vascular <b>access</b> <b>loss</b> and intestinal transplantation. The efficacy and safety of anticoagulants are unknown in this setting and based on sparse and low-quality observational data. Objectives Our aim was to estimate the incidence of thromboembolic, bleeding and anticoagulant-related complications in HPN patients, and evaluate risk factors for first venous thrombosis (VT). Methods This retrospective cohort study included all adult patients followed for long-term HPN at our center between 1986 and 2014. Primary outcomes were symptomatic objectively diagnosed VT, encompassing CRT and venous thromboembolism, and major bleeding. Secondary outcomes were vena cava syndrome and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia or hypersensitivity. Results A total of 236 patients were included (median HPN duration, 17 months) and 136 received anticoagulants at HPN onset (57. 6 %). Overall, the annual incidence of first VT was 11. 4 % (95 % confidence interval [95 % CI], 8. 6 - 14. 7 %); VT {{was associated with a}} personal history of thrombosis (adjusted hazard ratio, 2. 22; 95 % CI, 1. 06 - 4. 64), whereas anticoagulation seemed to account only for a mild protection (adjusted hazard ratio, 0. 72; 95 % CI, 0. 36 - 1. 44). The annual incidence of major bleeding was 4. 3 % for patients on anticoagulants vs. 1. 8 % for those off anticoagulants. Vena cava syndrome developed in 20. 7 % of patients with VT.

However, reports present conflicting results, creating confusion regarding the feasibility and outcomes. Our objective is to review the available literature and analyse the patency rates and complications of various types of lower-extremity arteriovenous access. MethodsAn Internet-based literature search was performed using MEDLINE to identify all published reports on lower-extremity vascular access. The analysis involved studies comprising at least 10 arteriovenous accesses with both inflow and outflow vessels in the {{lower extremity}}, and reporting on patency rates and access-related complications. The weighted mean patency rates were calculated, and the chi-square (χ 2) {{test was used to}} evaluate the differences in the complication rates in the subgroups of patients identified. ResultsThree main types of lower-extremity vascular access were identified: the upper thigh prosthetic, the mid-thigh prosthetic and the femoral vein transposition arteriovenous access. There are limited data on saphenous vein loop grafts, which report poor results. The weighted mean primary patency rates at 12 months were 48 %, 43 % and 83 %, respectively. The weighted mean secondary patency rates at 12 months were 69 %, 67 % and 93 %, respectively. <b>Access</b> <b>loss</b> as a result of infection was more common in upper thigh and mid-thigh grafts than femoral vein transposition arteriovenous access (18. 40 %, 18. 33 % vs. 1. 61 %; P< 0. 05).

Questionnaire survey, Key Person s Interview (KPI) and site visits/photo documentation were used to collect primary data from respondents. Ethnicity, village location and nature of economic activities were used in the selection of villages while respondents were chosen through simple random sampling. Results indicated that the performance of OP and cooperation between park and people is weakening geared by several factors. Benefits rendered to local communities, extent of community participation, distance from the boundary and losses from wildlife have significantly affected the attitudes of local people towards conservation. Support for tourism projects, establishment of Wildlife Management Areas (WMAs) had positive effects while restrictions on resource <b>access,</b> <b>loss</b> from wildlife and low level of community awareness and/or information sharing had negatively affected the program.

Thrombosed arteriovenous (AV) fistulas with large venous aneurysms have poor treatment results, with both endovascular and surgical techniques, leading to a high rate of definitive AV <b>access</b> <b>loss.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to review the feasibility and initial results of this novel endovascular treatment of thrombosed AV fistulas with large venous aneurysms. Materials and methods: A novel endovascular treatment technique of inserting nitinol auto-expandable uncovered stents stretching through the whole puncture site area, thus creating a tunnel inside the thrombus, was retrospectively analyzed and described. Results: A total of 17 stents were placed in 10 hemodialysis fistulas, with a mean venous coverage length of 17. 8  cm. In all the cases, 100 % technical success was achieved, with complete restoration of blood flow in all patients. There were no procedure-related complications. The mean follow-up was 167  days (range 60 – 420  days), with a primary and assisted patency of 80 % and 100 %, respectively. No multiple trans-stent struts-related complications were observed. Three stent fractures were diagnosed with plain films at the site of puncture without consequence in the venous access permeability.

The weighted mean secondary patency rates at 12 months were 69 %, 67 % and 93 %, respectively. <b>Access</b> <b>loss</b> as a result of infection was more common in upper thigh and mid-thigh grafts than femoral vein transposition arteriovenous access (18. 40 %, 18. 33 % vs. 1. 61 %; P < 0. 05). Ischaemic complications rates were higher in autologous than prosthetic arteriovenous access (20. 97 % vs. 7. 18 %, P < 0. 05). Conclusions: Lower-extremity vascular access has acceptable results in terms of patency, with femoral vein transposition having better patency rates than femoral grafts. Autologous access is associated with less infective complications, however, at the expense of increased ischaemic complications rates. Further research with randomised trials is required to assess the outcomes of lower-extremity vascular access.

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} effects of {{reducing}} tariffs under the Doha Round on market access for developing countries. It shows that for many developing countries, actual preferential access is less generous than it appears because of low product coverage or complex rules of origin. Thus lowering tariffs under the multilateral system is {{likely to lead to}} a net increase in market access for many developing countries, with gains in market <b>access</b> offsetting <b>losses</b> from preference erosion. Furthermore, comparing various tariff-cutting proposals, the research shows that the largest gains in market access are generated by higher tariff cuts in agriculture. developing countries; market access; preference erosion; tariffs; WTO...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{personal}} {{sensitive information}} faces {{the possibility of}} unauthorized <b>access</b> or <b>loss</b> of storage devices. Cryptographic technique gives a promising way to protect our files. In this paper we describe the design and implementation of Encrypt-FS, a high efficient and reliable cryptographic file system that provides dynamic data encryption and decryption at system level. Two cryptographic algorithms are used to encrypt a file: a symmetric cryptographic algorithm to cipher file’s contents and a public key algorithm to encrypt the key that the symmetric cryptographic algorithm uses. File sharing and enhanced security are also included in Encrypt-FS. We evaluate its performance using Iozone and Bonnie benchmarks. 1...|$|R
25|$|Indirect {{costs are}} those that affect females in the future. One such cost happens because sexual {{coercion}} does not allow females to choose the males they want to mate with, which are usually males that are higher quality, compatible, and/or have good genes that will increase their offspring’s survival and fitness. Coercion decreases this choice {{and can lead to}} their offspring having lower genetic quality. Studies of the rose bitterling (Rhodeus ocellatus), have shown that offspring of females with mate choice had higher survival rates than offspring of females that did not. Another ultimate cost comes from when males commit infanticide to obtain mating <b>access.</b> This <b>loss</b> of offspring leads to a decrease in fitness of females.|$|R
