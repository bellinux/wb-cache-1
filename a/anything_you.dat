500|$|Anne became queen {{upon the}} death of William III on 8 March 1702, and was {{immediately}} popular.

[...] However, if a person makes {{a statement}} before there is time to administer a caution, the statement remains admissible if the caution is then administered as soon as possible.|$|E
500|$|Lavigne {{eventually}} {{took on a}} more gothic {{style as}} she began her second album, Under My Skin, trading her skating outfits for black tutus and developing an image marked by angst. During The Best Damn Thing years, Lavigne changed directions. She dyed her hair blonde with a pink streak, wore feminine outfits, including [...] "tight jeans and heels", and modelled for magazines such as Harper's Bazaar. Lavigne defended her new style: [...] "I don't really regret <b>anything.</b> <b>You</b> know, the ties and the wife-beaters and all... It had its time and place.

His daughter Þorgerður recalls that she was once sent to a slaughterhouse to collect a specimen but arrived just as the workers were taking a lunch break: [...] "Someone asked, 'What's in the basket?' I had to say, 'I'm collecting a frozen goat penis.' After that I said, 'I will never collect for you again.'" [...] According to Sigurður, [...] "Collecting penises is like collecting <b>anything.</b> <b>You</b> can never stop, you can never catch up, you can always get a new one, a better one." ...|$|E
500|$|Giving {{the film}} only the tagline [...] "A love {{story in the}} city of dreams", David Lynch has refused to comment on Mulholland Drives meaning or symbolism, leading to much {{discussion}} and multiple interpretations. The Christian Science Monitor film critic David Sterritt spoke with Lynch after the film screened at Cannes and wrote that the director [...] "insisted that Mulholland Drive does tell a coherent, comprehensible story", unlike some of Lynch's earlier films like Lost Highway. On the other hand, Justin Theroux said of Lynch's feelings on the multiple meanings people perceive in the film, [...] "I think he's genuinely happy for it to mean <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> want. He loves it when people come up with really bizarre interpretations. David works from his subconscious." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} start {{as a member of}} the Giants, Opening Day (April 3), Zito went five innings and allowed two earned runs against the San Diego Padres. He would take the loss. In his next start, Zito struggled. He went six innings but allowed eight earned runs against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Zito would earn his first win {{as a member of the}} Giants in his next start on April 16 when he went six innings, gave up three hits, and allowed no runs to the Colorado Rockies. [...] "I've been trying to have a good game", Zito said. [...] "You can't try to do <b>anything.</b> <b>You</b> either do or you don't. I tried to get too fine with my pitches. I wasn't aggressive." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{week later}} on 12 February, Sussex police, tipped {{off by the}} paper, who in turn were tipped off by Richards' chauffeur, raided a party at Keith Richards' home, Redlands. No arrests were made at the time but Jagger, Richards and their friend art dealer Robert Fraser were {{subsequently}} charged with drug offences. Richards said in 2003, [...] "When we got busted at Redlands, it suddenly made us realize {{that this was a}} whole different ball game and that was when the fun stopped. Up until then it had been as though London existed in a beautiful space where you could do <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> wanted." [...] On the treatment of the man responsible for the raid he later added: [...] "As I heard it, he never walked the same again." ...|$|E
500|$|Bowie's debut {{release was}} the 1964 single [...] "Liza Jane" [...] by Davie Jones & the King Bees.

His first release using the name David Bowie was the 1966 single [...] "Can't Help Thinking About Me", which was released with The Lower Third. Bowie's next single, [...] "Do <b>Anything</b> <b>You</b> Say", also released in 1966, was the first release by simply David Bowie. Bowie released four more singles and his debut album, David Bowie, but the first success in the United Kingdom was with the 1969 single [...] "Space Oddity". The single reached number five on the UK Singles Chart after it was released five days before the Apollo 11 moon mission.|$|E
500|$|Many of Adkins' {{songs were}} {{accompanied}} by a dance of the same name. [...] "The Hunch" [...] was understood to be a dry humping dance craze, although Adkins failed to define it in interviews. He used the term to describe anything of sexual relation, even naming his car the [...] "Hunchin' Wagon". [...] "The Slop" [...] was a song and dance Adkins pioneered for [...] "the drunks", which he made so [...] "you could just go left or right or fall down or <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> ran into". 2000's Poultry in Motion introduced a slew of chicken dances. [...] "The Chicken Walk" [...] involved [...] "quiver yourself from head to toe" [...] to mimic that of a chicken, while [...] "The Chicken Flop" [...] was simply [...] "flopping all over the place".|$|E

500|$|Sarah's last {{attempt to}} re-establish her {{friendship}} with Anne came in 1710, {{when they had}} their final meeting. An account written by Sarah shortly afterwards shows that she pleaded to be given an explanation of why their friendship was at an end, but Anne was unmoved, coldly repeating a few set phrases such as [...] "I shall make no answer to <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> say" [...] and [...] "you may put it in writing". Sarah was so appalled by the Queen's [...] "inhuman" [...] conduct that she was reduced to tears, and, most unusually {{for a woman who}} rarely spoke of religion, ended by threatening the Queen with the judgement of God. Anne replied that God's judgement on her concerned herself only, but later admitted that this was the one remark from Sarah at this interview [...] which had deeply hurt her.|$|E
500|$|Willis went to {{the camp}} and {{impressed}} Brown with his speed and reflexes, as he had at Ohio State. Brown lined him up against center Mo Scarry in practice on his first day. Willis beat him every time. Scarry complained that Willis was coming across the line before he snapped the ball. On one snap, Scarry stepped on quarterback Otto Graham's foot as he backpedaled to handle Willis. Brown took a look himself: Willis was not offside. He was getting a jump by watching for the center's fingers to tighten on the ball. [...] "He was quick", said Alex Agase, who later joined the Browns as a guard. [...] "I don't think there was anybody as quick at that position, or any position for that matter. He came off that ball with that ball as quick as <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> would want to see." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{directed}} their commentaries of {{the music}} video towards Ferreira's increasingly risqué public persona, shifting from the more innocent image with which she launched her career. A writer from MuuMuse provided a favorable review, comparing it to the visuals for [...] "Criminal" [...] by Fiona Apple and summarizing that [...] "Sky Ferreira is cooler than <b>anything</b> <b>you</b> and I could ever be." [...] Becky Bain from Idolator stated that the appearance of Toby the Tarantula was [...] "somehow nowhere near as disconcerting as the image of Sky, looking washed out with platinum hair against a white background, crazily painting her face with a tube of red lipstick." [...] Michael Cragg of The Guardian felt that Ferreira's friendship with the controversial Richardson showcased a [...] "shift away from the pop princess {{she felt she was}} being moulded into", and commented that the spider was [...] "not for the faint-hearted".|$|E
