University of Minnesota researchers report that if all corn grown in the U.S. were used to make ethanol it would displace 12% of current U.S. gasoline consumption. There are claims that land for ethanol production is acquired through deforestation, while others have observed that areas currently supporting forests are usually not suitable for growing crops. In any case, farming may involve a decline in soil fertility due to reduction of organic matter, a decrease in water availability and quality, {{an increase in the}} use of pesticides and fertilizers, and potential dislocation of local communities. New technology enables farmers and processors to increasingly produce the same output using less inputs.|$|E
40|$|International audienceA residue {{obtained}} {{after the}} distillation of <b>agricultural</b> <b>alcohol</b> called beet residues is gasified in supercritical water {{to form a}} mixture of fuel gas. A parametric study and thermodynamic calculations are first proposed in batch reactor. The results show a significant effect of temperature on the overall mass yields. Gasification efficiencies range from 0. 60 to 0. 90 g g− 1 when temperature increases from 450 to 600 °C. The gas low heating value increases under these conditions from 7. 4 to 13. 2 MJ kg− 1 of initial dry feedstock. After that, a continuous system designed for hydrothermal oxidation processes has been used. For supercritical water gasification, the reduction of total organic carbon in the liquid effluent output presents a little variation, between 59 and 69 %, when the operating conditions are changed. To increase the reaction temperature, supercritical water partial oxidation has been conducted. The highest carbon gasification yield is obtained for the highest equivalent molar ratio, indicating a great interest of partial oxidation. Moreover, {{the results indicate that}} this process configuration accepts biomass flow variations without influencing the global efficiency...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe biomass is {{the whole}} organic matter of {{vegetable}} or animal origin. This material can be valorized in various ways: {{it can be used}} by manufacturers (lumber, paper, and biochemistry); it can be used as energy (heat, electricity, and fuel); and it can be used as food or in cosmetics. Various processes are nowadays used to valorize biomass. This work deals with the potentialities of the biomass gasification in supercritical water. The objective is to demonstrate the potentiality of this process to treat some aqueous waste from distillery to obtain a syngas with a high hydrogen yield. The bioresources of this study come from some <b>agricultural</b> <b>alcohol</b> (beet, sugar cane, and cereal) and wine-producing distilleries. Experiments have been carried out at different conversion severities, using a 100 mL batch reactor, during 0 - 60 min, at a pressure of 25 MPa and at temperatures between 400 and 500 °C. Complete product analyses will be presented. Particularly detailed gas analyses have been performed. The sodium and potassium behaviors during the process have been accurately studied {{as a function of the}} substrate. Correlations between the experimental operating conditions and these analyses will be discussed in order to determine optimal experimental conditions to gasify this specific biomass...|$|E

40|$|Thesis Abstract The paper {{discusses}} {{the significance of}} food and eating habits of aristocrats in Early China, particularly during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods (771 - 221 B. C.). The dominant part of the paper introduces major foodstuffs and the function of food in both the social intercourse and {{as a part of}} feasts and festivities. The importance of food is stressed in its relation to sacrifice and references are made about activities and rules regarding dietary issues of members of the highest social class. The focus on cultural viewpoints deals mainly with references regarding food in connection with events of that period in surviving texts and primary sources. Key words: China, antiquity, Eastern Zhou Dynasty, <b>agricultural</b> crop, meat, <b>alcohol,</b> ritual, ancestors, sacrifice, feasts, surviving texts...|$|R
40|$|History as a {{research}} discipline has traditionally focused on nation-building; evidence of how nations such as Australia have achieved modernity. That is, prosperity through industrialisation and democracy in governance. This paper focuses on a commodity {{that has not been}} nation-building - like wool, meat and minerals have been – though it has become economically and cultural significant in the past twenty years. And, given the global significance of wine production, distribution and consumption, in exploring evidence from the past relating to ‘wine’ in all of its guises - as <b>agricultural</b> product, manufactured <b>alcohol,</b> object of trade, subject of tourism and marker of cultural identity – my research has been both trans-national (that is, beyond the creation of Australia as a nation using its own borders as the defining framework) and transdisciplinary in that this paper introduces aspects of Hunter wine history which relate to existing research in the disciplines of Business and Tourism...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{numerous}} policy reforms {{since the}} 1980 s, farm product prices remain heavily distorted in both high-income and developing countries. This book seeks {{to improve our}} understanding of why societies adopted these policies, and why some but not other countries have undertaken reforms. Drawing on recent developments in political economy theories and in the generation of empirical measures {{of the extent of}} price distortions, the present volume provides both analytical narratives of the historical origins of agricultural protectionism {{in various parts of the}} world and a set of political econometric analyses aimed at explaining the patterns of distortions that have emerged over the past five decades. These new studies shed much light on the forces affecting incentives and those facing farmers in the course of national and global economic and political development. They also show how those distortions might change in the future. Machine generated contents note: Part I. Introduction: 1.

40|$|Bio fuels {{are made}} from an {{extensive}} selection of fuels derived from biomass, including wood waste, <b>agricultural</b> wastes, and <b>alcohol</b> fuels. As a result of increased energy requirements, raised oil prices, and concern over greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels, bio fuels are acquiring increased public and scientific attention. The ethanol industry is booming and {{during the past several}} years, there has been an increase in demand for fuel ethanol and use of its co-products. To increase potential revenues from ethanol processing and its utilization, extensive research is proceeding in this field. In Western Canada, wheat is the primary raw material used in the production of ethanol by fermentation and distillers’ dried grains with solubles (DDGS) are one of the major co-products produced during this process. At present, the DDGS are generally sold as animal feed stock but with some alteration they could be used in other useful areas. Densification of biomass and use of it for fuel like wood pellets, hay briquettes, etc. have been studied for many years and have also been commercialized. In this thesis, pellets made from distillers’ dried grains have been investigated. DDGS were obtained from Noramera Bioenergy Corp. and Terra Grain Fuels Ltd. Before transforming them into pellets, they were characterized on the basis of physical and chemical properties. A California pilot-scale mill (with and without steam conditioning) was used for pelleting the distillers’ grains with solubles. A full factorial design with two levels of moisture content (i. e., 14 and 15. 5 % (w. b.)), hammer mill screen size (i. e., 3. 2 and 4. 8 mm) and temperature (i. e., 90 and 100 °C) was used {{to determine the effects of}} these three factors on the pellet properties made from Noramera Bioenergy Corp., without steam conditioning. Different levels of moisture content were used for the pellets made from Terra Grain Fuels Ltd. (i. e., 11. 5 and 13. 09 % (w. b.)), with steam conditioning. The initial moisture contents of the DDGS were 12. 5 and 13. 75 % (w. b.) from Noramera and Terra Grain, respectively. The moisture content of DDGS grinds ranged from 11. 6 to 12. 03 % (w. b.) for the Noramera samples, and from 11. 5 to 13. 09 % (w. b.) for Terra Grain DDGS. The moisture content decreased with a decrease in the hammer mill screen size. The use of a smaller screen size achieved an increase in both the bulk and particle densities of the DDGS. The coefficient of internal friction was almost the same for both samples but cohesion was higher in Noramera samples (8. 534 kPa). The DDGS obtained from Noramera Bioenergy Corp. contained dry matter (91. 40 %), crude fibre (4. 98 %), crude protein (37. 41 %), cellulose (10. 75 %), hemi-cellulose (21. 04 %), lignin (10. 50 %), starch (3. 84 %), fat (4. 52 %) and ash (5. 16 %); whereas the samples obtained from Terra Grain Fuels contained dry matter (87. 69 %), crude fibre (7. 33 %), crude protein (32. 43 %), cellulose (10. 81 %), hemi-cellulose (27. 45 %), lignin (4. 37 %), starch (4. 18 %), fat (6. 37 %) and ash (4. 50 %). The combustion energy of the Noramera samples was 19. 45 MJ/kg at a moisture content of 8. 6 % (w. b.) whereas the combustion energy of Terra Grain samples was 18. 54 MJ/kg at 12. 31 % (w. b.) moisture content. The durability of the pellets increased as the screen size decreased which is likely due to the fact that a smaller screen size produces more fine particles. This fill voids in the pellets and, hence, makes them more durable. The length of the pellets produced from Noramera DDGS increased with a decrease in moisture content possibly because pellets formed at higher moisture content absorb less moisture. Therefore, the length does not increase as much. Lateral expansion occurred most with higher temperature and lower moisture content and with lower temperature and higher moisture content. The length to diameter ratio of the pellets followed the same trend as the change in pellet length. The length of the pellets produced from Terra Grain also increased with a decrease in moisture content. The lateral expansion increased with increase in screen size and moisture content and also, with decrease in moisture content and increase in temperature. The length to diameter ratio increased with decrease in screen size and moisture content, similar to the change in pellet length. The highest bulk density of Noramera pellets resulted from smaller screen size and lower moisture. The particle density increased with a decrease in screen size and an increase in moisture content. The highest bulk density of Terra Grain pellets occurred with an increase in temperature and decrease in moisture content. The highest particle density occurred with an increase in temperature and decrease in screen size. The pellet hardness increased with a decrease in moisture content and screen size did not have any significant effect. The Terra Grain pellets were harder because they were subjected to steam conditioning. Steam conditioning helps to increase the hardness. The pellet durability increased with a decrease in screen size and increase in moisture content. The steam conditioning also caused the higher durability in the Terra Grain pellets. In terms of moisture absorption, the only significant factor was moisture content. Pellets with lower moisture content absorbed more moisture. The ash content values of pellets were higher in Noramera samples than in Terra Grain samples because of high moisture content in Noramera samples. The combustion energy of the Noramera pellets was higher than the Terra Grain pellets because of the high percentage of dry matter and lignin present in Noramera samples. The emission results for both the sample pellets were similar. When the DDGS pellets were compared to wood pellets, emission of nitrous oxide was lower for wood whereas, carbon dioxide was higher...|$|R
