30|$|Over {{the past}} two decades, {{semiconductor}} nanocrystals have <b>attracted</b> <b>great</b> <b>attention</b> of researchers due to their unique optical properties. In particular, luminescent quantum dots (QDs) are defined as semiconductor structures with physical dimensions that are smaller than the exciton Bohr radius[1, 2]. These materials exhibit a strong quantum confinement effect, and this effect causes the appearance of size-dependent optical properties, which has <b>attracted</b> <b>great</b> <b>attention</b> for application of QDs in different technological areas, including biological labeling, light-emitting diodes, and photovoltaic devices[3].|$|R
