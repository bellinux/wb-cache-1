He stated: Money {{is the only thing that}} keeps them playing...If they earned the same money <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> when I was playing they'd have retired at 34 <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> and Australian cricket would be the better for it.|$|E

Frusciante has also noted his increased use of the Roland MC-202 for his electronic music, {{saying that he was}} at the point [...] "where I thought as much like a 202ist <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> a guitarist..." [...] The MC-202 has been his primary melodic instrument in his electronic music.|$|E

500|$|At {{the close}} of the war, Hancock was {{assigned}} to supervise the execution of the Lincoln assassination conspirators. Lincoln had been assassinated on April 14, 1865, and by May 9 of that year, a military commission had been convened to try the accused. The actual assassin, John Wilkes Booth, was already dead, but the trial of his co-conspirators proceeded quickly, resulting in convictions. President Andrew Johnson ordered the executions to be carried out on July 7. Although he was reluctant to execute some of the less-culpable conspirators, especially Mary Surratt, Hancock carried out his orders, later writing that [...] "every soldier was bound to act <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> under similar circumstances." ...|$|E
500|$|Margaret Lions of Entertainment Weekly {{said the}} episode had [...] "strong moments, and some {{interesting}} character play [...] I didn't get {{quite the same}} buzz from this week's installments <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> from the previous episode." [...] She said [...] "Dream Team" [...] lacks the usual group interactions between the office co-workers, which she said are normally the funniest parts of the show. However, she praised Michael's pep talk to Pam in the final scene, and said the episode was [...] "the best showcase Jenna Fischer has had in years". Entertainment Weekly listed Michael's pep talk to Pam {{at the end of}} the episode as one of the 13 highlights from that week in television.|$|E
500|$|This episode reintroduces and {{resolves}} Veronica's rape, introduced {{earlier in}} the season. However, it had been largely ignored until {{this point in the}} series. The episode was the third and final episode of the series directed by Marcos Siega, after [...] "Drinking the Kool-Aid" [...] and [...] "Mars vs. Mars". In addition, the episode marks regular writer Diane Ruggiero's sixth writing credit for the show. After the episode aired, Rob Thomas called the episode [...] "our high-water mark". Commenting on Ruggiero writing the episode, he stated, [...] "She was really my right hand writing the series, and it felt good to have someone who knew the voices as well <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> We were both in a comfort zone, both writing this show and writing with each other." ...|$|E

[...] All I do is sing [...] "Hate to Get Up in the Morning" [...] <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> in the show, but the camera is a severe judge and I am afraid even with the great amount of care and fuss they can't improve what the Fates decreed to be a homely face. [...] As for my voice, I made a recording. [...] When the record was first played on the set, one of the electricians, who didn't know whose voice it was, said, [...] "If the guy who wrote that song could hear the record, he would turn over in his grave"--which gives you a fair idea. [...] However I am hoping it won't be too bad.|$|E
500|$|Tomb of Horrors {{was written}} by Gary Gygax for {{official}} D tournament play at the 1975 Origins 1 convention. Gygax developed the adventure from an idea by Alan Lucien, one of his original AD playtesters, [...] "and I admit to chuckling evilly <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> so." [...] Gygax designed the Tomb of Horrors modules for two related purposes. First, Gygax explains, [...] "There were several very expert players in my campaign, and this was meant as yet another challenge to their skill—and the persistence of their theretofore-invincible characters. Specifically, I had in mind foiling Rob Kuntz's PC, Robilar, and Ernie Gygax's PC, Tenser." [...] Second, {{so that he was}} [...] "ready for those fans [...] who boasted of having mighty PCs able to best any challenge offered by the AD game." ...|$|E
500|$|The Baltimore Suns David Zurawik was {{critical}} of the show's characterization and comedy, but {{was impressed by the}} staging of [...] "Don't Stop Believin', calling it [...] "so elevating and inspirational that it almost redeems all the stereotypes and lame humor that come before. Grit my teeth <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> at how one-dimensionally empty-headed the writing could be, I will still be back for the start of this series in the fall because of its musical punch." [...] Tom Jicha for The Sun Sentinel similarly claimed of the episode that: [...] "A lively score and appealing performers somewhat compensate for overly familiar characters and plotting", while Rob Owen for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette agreed: [...] "It's the music that makes Glee a gleeful delight. Without the song-and-dance production numbers, this Fox pilot would be just another high-school-set comedy-drama." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1972, Takemitsu, {{accompanied}} by Iannis Xenakis, Betsy Jolas, and others, heard Balinese gamelan music in Bali. The experience influenced the composer on a largely philosophical and theological level. For those accompanying Takemitsu on the expedition (most {{of whom were}} French musicians), who [...] "... could not keep their composure <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> before this music: it was too foreign {{for them to be}} able to assess the resulting discrepancies with their logic", the experience was without precedent. For Takemitsu, however, by now quite familiar with his own native musical tradition, there was a relationship between [...] "the sounds of the gamelan, the tone of the kapachi, the unique scales and rhythms by which they are formed, and Japanese traditional music which had shaped such a large part of my sensitivity". In his solo piano work For Away (written for Roger Woodward in 1973), a single, complex line is distributed between the pianist's hands, which reflects the interlocking patterns between the metallophones of a gamelan orchestra.|$|E
500|$|Although the Queen was {{set against}} Beatrice marrying {{anyone in the}} {{expectation}} that she would always stay at home with her, {{a number of possible}} suitors were put forward before Beatrice's marriage to Prince Henry of Battenberg. One of these was Napoléon Eugéne, the French Prince Imperial, son and heir of the exiled Emperor Napoleon III of France and his wife, the Empress Eugénie. After Prussia defeated France in the Franco-Prussian War, Napoleon was deposed and moved his family to England in 1870. After the Emperor's death in 1873, Queen Victoria and Empress Eugénie formed a close attachment, and the newspapers reported the imminent engagement of Beatrice to the Prince Imperial. These rumours ended with the death of the Prince Imperial in the Anglo-Zulu War on 1 June 1879. Queen Victoria's journal records their grief: [...] "Dear Beatrice, crying very much <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> too, gave me the telegram... It was dawning and little sleep did I get... Beatrice is so distressed; everyone quite stunned." ...|$|E
500|$|Wilson's and Love's working {{relationship}} was briefly reestablished for the follow-up single [...] "Good Vibrations". [...] Wilson {{said that before}} its final mixdown, he had been confronted with resistance by unnamed members of the group. The subject of their worries and complaints was the song's length and [...] "modern" [...] sound: [...] "I said no, it's {{not going to be}} too long a record, it's going to be just right. ... They didn't quite understand what this jumping from studio to studio was all about. And they couldn't conceive of the record <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> I saw the record as a totality piece." [...] Love was worried that the [...] "track itself was already so avant-garde, especially with the theremin, [...] I wondered how our fans were going to relate to it." [...] Shortly before the single's release, Wilson suggested: [...] "It's still sticking pretty close to that same boy-girl thing, you know, but with a difference. And it's a start, it's definitely a start." ...|$|E

500|$|Filming {{involving}} the reptiles frequently {{proved to be}} hazardous. During a promotional shoot with Supermarionation puppets, one of the crocodiles suddenly grabbed the Lady Penelope marionette (which {{does not appear in}} the episode) and, to the upset of Glanville, ripped apart one the legs. During the filming of a scene in which an alligator swims after a boat, Meddings was using a rope to guide the crocodile forwards when it was discovered that the animal had slipped out of its harness; in his book, 21st–Century Visions, Meddings wrote of the incident: [...] "My crew never saw me move as fast <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{to get out of the}} tank when I pulled the rope and realised the creature was free." [...] Of the largest crocodile, which was wetted with damp strips at the back of the stage while un-used, Wingrove recalls: [...] "You would forget that it was there, then one day someone shouted 'Look out!' and we turned round to see this big crocodile walking across the stage – which cleared of people very quickly!" ...|$|E
500|$|Buddy TV {{senior writer}} Oscar Dahl remarked, [...] "It didn't {{make me laugh}} out loud and, yet, I still loved it." [...] He shed a {{negative}} light on Andy's behavior towards Dwight, calling it [...] "annoying and not that funny." [...] Dahl hoped Dwight would be reappearing soon, and concluded [...] "Overall, a crucial story episode with a nice cliffhanger. Even if wasn't as funny as last week or even most episodes this season, The Office still entertains." [...] AOL TV's Michael Sciannamea lauded the episode, writing [...] "I cannot remember ever guffawing over every single line in a single sitcom episode <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> watching this one. If the performances in this particular one don't garner the actors in this show a plethora of Emmys, {{there ought to be}} an investigation." [...] Sciannamea continued that he believed it was Steve Carell's best series performance thus far because he [...] "displayed the full range of his personality—jokester, arrogant jerk, charming salesman, sensitive soul, and added a new one—anger." ...|$|E
500|$|At 32, Grant {{claimed to}} be on the brink of giving up the acting {{profession}} but was surprised by the script of Four Weddings and a Funeral (FWAAF). [...] "If you read as many bad scripts <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> you'd know how grateful you are when you come across one where the guy actually is funny," [...] he later recalled. Released in 1994, FWAAF became the highest-grossing British film to date with a worldwide box office in excess of $244million, making Grant an overnight international star. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards, and among numerous awards won by its cast and crew, it earned Grant his first and only Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. It also temporarily typecast him as the lead character, Charles, a bohemian and debonair bachelor. Grant and Curtis saw it as an inside joke that the star, due to the parts he played, was assumed to have the personality of the screenwriter, who is known for writing about himself and his own life. Grant later expressed : ...|$|E

500|$|The {{compilation}} album includes 19 {{songs by}} various artists. Thirteen {{of the tracks}} were previously unreleased; the six existing recordings were: [...] "Wish for You" [...] by Faith Hill, Sade's [...] "The Sweetest Gift", [...] "I Remember" [...] by Lauryn Hill, Seal's [...] "Secret", [...] "Fragilidad" [...] (1988) by Sting, and David Bowie's [...] "Everyone Says 'Hi'". Turlington said of the album: I went to friends first, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> with the first CD. Bono and Chris Martin were great supporters of the project the first time around, and when I knew I wanted to include men on this album they were obvious choices. They are also both fathers to daughters. Others, such as Patti Smith and Rita Wilson, I've {{known for a long}} time, and some, like Edie Brickell and Paul Simon, I only met briefly but was a huge admirer. I generally wanted a diverse group of artists who were parents, {{or in the case of}} Edward Sharpe, who will be soon. We wanted to reach a broad audience on this issue with this particular project and with a range of perspectives.|$|E
500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club graded {{the episode}} with a C. He criticized Gilmore's {{performance}} in [...] "That Still Small Voice" [...] and earlier episodes, writing that [...] "Gilmore struggles {{to make a}} connection with his character, so it always looks like he’s reading lines," [...] which might {{have a negative effect}} on the Henry's character development. Sava felt that Espenson, based on her previous work, was good at balancing large casts and wrote [...] "this episode juggles the expansive character roster of this series better than its predecessors." [...] Conversely, IGN's Amy Ratcliffe said she has [...] "never liked Henry as much <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> in this episode," [...] especially his explanation to Archie on why he is Jiminy Cricket. Ratcliffe added that Jiminy had the [...] "most touching backstory" [...] of the season up to that point, opining that [...] "the transformation of Dr. Hopper was moving, and this episode maybe felt the most like a fairytale of the stories we've seen so far." [...] She graded [...] "That Still Small Voice" [...] with 8 out of 10, an indication of a [...] "great" [...] episode.|$|E
500|$|For obZen, Haake {{returned}} to the drum kit most notably with his performance on the song [...] "Bleed". In an interview for Gravemusic.com, Haake stated, [...] " [...] was a big effort for me to learn, I {{had to find a}} totally new approach to playing the double bass drums {{to be able to do}} that stuff. I had never really done anything like that before like the fast bursts that go all the way through the song basically. So I actually spent as much time practicing that track alone <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> with all of the other tracks combined. It's kind of a big feat to change your approach like that and I'm glad we were able to nail it for the album. For a while though we didn't even know if it was going to make it to the album." [...] Hagström also stated, [...] "obZen is one of the most highly technical offerings the band has ever put to tape". Revolver magazine confirms this statement: [...] "At first listen, obZen seems less challenging to the listener than some of the band's other records, and most of the songs flow smoothly from one syncopated passage to the next. However, careful examination reveals that the material is some of the group's most complicated".|$|E
