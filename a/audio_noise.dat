HDMI adds the ability to send audio and auxiliary data using 4b/10b encoding for the Data Island Period. Each Data Island Period is 32 pixels in size and contains a 32-bit Packet Header, which includes 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data for error correction and describes {{the contents of the}} packet. Each packet contains four subpackets, and each subpacket is 64 bits in size, including 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data, allowing for each packet to carry up to 224 bits of audio data. Each Data Island Period can contain up to 18 packets. Seven of the 15 packet types described in the HDMI 1.3a specifications deal with audio data, while the other 8 types deal with auxiliary data. Among these are the General Control Packet and the Gamut Metadata Packet. The General Control Packet carries information on AVMUTE (which mutes the audio during changes that may cause <b>audio</b> <b>noise)</b> and Color Depth (which sends the bit depth of the current video stream and is required for deep color). The Gamut Metadata Packet carries information on the color space being used for the current video stream and is required for xvYCC.|$|E
2500|$|The inner ear, for example, does {{significant}} {{signal processing}} in converting sound waveforms into neural stimuli, so certain differences between waveforms may be imperceptible. [...] Data compression techniques, such as MP3, {{make use of}} this fact. In addition, the ear has a nonlinear response to sounds of different intensity levels; this nonlinear response is called loudness. Telephone networks and <b>audio</b> <b>noise</b> reduction systems make use of this fact by nonlinearly compressing data samples before transmission, and then expanding them for playback. [...] Another effect of the ear's nonlinear response is that sounds that are close in frequency produce phantom beat notes, or intermodulation distortion products.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In this work, {{we study}} {{a special kind}} of primary user {{emulation}} (PUE) attack, named wireless microphone user emulation (WMUE) attack in white space cognitive radio net-works. In WMUE attacks, a malicious user emulates wireless microphone (WM) signals in order to block secondary users. Existing work on WMUE attack detection deals with single channel senario. Although multi-channel WM (MCWM) systems are common, detecting WMUE attacks under a multi-channel setting in noisy environments has not been well studied and the existing solution for single channel case cannot be directly applied. In a practical multi-channel WM system, the audio signals on different channels mix with each other and are contaminated by noises, which introduce great challenges on WMUE attack detection. We propose a novel multi-channel WMUE attack detection scheme which is based on the cross-correlation between the demodulated FM signal and the acoustic signal. The <b>audio</b> interferences, <b>audio</b> <b>noises,</b> and RF noises are all resisted by the cross-correlation. To reduce computation complexity, we propose a 1. 5 -bit FM demodulator whose outputs are represented by only 0, 1 and- 1. Moreover, we set up a MCWM system and developped a hardware based prototype to evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme. Experimental results show that, the proposed scheme can effectively detect multi-channel WMUE attacks within 0. 25 second with detection rate larger than 0. 9 and false alarm rate lower than 0. 1 under low signal-to-noise ratios.

50|$|In <b>audio</b> post-processing, <b>noise</b> gating reduces {{steady noise}} {{sources such as}} rumble from LP records, hiss from audio tape, static from a radio or amplifier, and hum from a power system, without greatly {{affecting}} the source sound. An audio signal such as music or speech is broken up into many frequency bands by a collection of overlapping band-pass filters, and if the signal amplitude in any one band is lower than a preset threshold, then that band is eliminated from the final sound. This greatly reduces perceptible background noise because only the frequency components of the noise that are within the gated passbands survive.|$|R
