5|$|Another {{problem with}} the NIF lasers is that the flashtubes create a {{significant}} amount of heat, which warms the laser glass enough to cause it to deform. This requires a lengthy cooling-off period between shots, on the order of 12 hours. In practice, NIF manages a shot rate of less than one shot per day. To be useful as <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant,</b> about a dozen shots would have to take place every second, well beyond the capabilities of the NIF lasers.|$|E
5|$|On 23 May, a $17 million {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} two companies, to complete {{the first phase of}} construction. This included the north−south runway, a parallel taxiway (Taxiway J), a parking apron, the Arch Hangar, a base operations building, a control tower, <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant,</b> a 250-person barracks (which would later become Building 6000), a water supply system, and a railroad spur to the base (now part of the Montreal, Maine and Atlantic Railway).|$|E
5|$|The {{power plant}} {{operates}} using a lower and upper reservoir along with <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> connected to both. Water is either pumped {{from the lower}} to the upper reservoir to serve as stored energy or released from the upper to the lower reservoir to generate electricity. Pumping occurs during low demand, cheap electricity, periods such as night and generating will occur during peak demand, expensive electricity, hours such as during the day. The pumping/generating process repeats as needed.|$|E

In 2007, scientists using DNA analysis identified the body of a small fair-haired toddler, one of the first victims to be recovered by the CS Mackay Bennett, as Frederick's youngest child, 19-month-old Sidney. The Sages, Anderssons and Goodwins all perished in the sinking.|$|E
5|$|Between 1907 and 1913, a {{development}} boom occurred in Lethbridge, {{making it the}} main marketing, distribution and service centre in southern Alberta. Such municipal projects as a water treatment plant, <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant,</b> a streetcar system, and exhibition buildings — {{as well as a}} construction boom and rising real estate prices — transformed the mining town into a significant city. Between World WarI and World WarII, however, the city experienced an economic slump. Development slowed, drought drove farmers from their farms, and coal mining rapidly declined from its peak. After World WarII, irrigation of farmland near Lethbridge led to growth in the city's population and economy. Lethbridge College (previously Lethbridge Community College) opened in April 1957 and the University of Lethbridge in 1967.|$|E

5|$|Historically, two {{breakers}} {{known as}} the Eddy Creek Shaft and the No. 2 Shaft were situated {{on the banks of}} Eddy Creek. In the late 1800s, a mine fire started in the No. 2 Shaft. As a last resort, water from Eddy Creek and the Lackawanna River were used in an attempt to extinguish it. Historically, there was a dam on the creek. The dam was owned by the Delaware and Hudson Company and was used for impounding water to flush ashes from <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant.</b> The creek also supplied water for a washery at the Underwood Colliery.|$|E
5|$|Much of Raël's {{advocacy}} concerning futuristic {{technology is}} described in his 2001 book, Yes to Human Cloning. He supported human genetic engineering {{in order to avoid}} genetically inherited diseases and to reduce the economic burden on society. He said that no distinctive emphasis needed to be allocated to a particular race or religion. Elsewhere in the book, he stated that nanotechnology will make it possible to have micro-distributive power generation (essentially <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> in each house), fur-like furnishings that are self-cleaning with hair-like fibers that move on their own, and biological robots. Nanostructures control biology, so Raël expected that meat and salads will someday be grown in a machine via molecular construction.|$|E

5|$|The {{steam turbine}} section of <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant,</b> the turbine hall, {{generally}} costs about $1/W, and the electrical equipment to feed that {{power to the}} grid is about another $1/W. To reach the projected total CAPEX quoted in LIFE documents, this implies that the entire nuclear island has to cost around $4/W for LIFE.2, and just over $2/W for LIFE.3. Modern nuclear plants, benefiting from decades of commercial experience and continuous design work, cost just under $8/W, with approximately half {{of that in the}} nuclear island.

5|$|Even {{with the}} success of the fund drive, the {{pedestal}} was not completed until April 1886. Immediately thereafter, reassembly of the statue began. Eiffel's iron framework was anchored to steel I-beams within the concrete pedestal and assembled. Once this was done, the sections of skin were carefully attached. Due to the width of the pedestal, {{it was not possible to}} erect scaffolding, and workers dangled from ropes while installing the skin sections. Nevertheless, no one died during the construction. Bartholdi had planned to put floodlights on the torch's balcony to illuminate it; a week before the dedication, the Army Corps of Engineers vetoed the proposal, fearing that ships' pilots passing the statue would be blinded. Instead, Bartholdi cut portholes in the torch—which was covered with gold leaf—and placed the lights inside them. <b>A</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> was installed on the island to light the torch and for other electrical needs. After the skin was completed, renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, co-designer of New York's Central Park and Brooklyn's Prospect Park, supervised a cleanup of Bedloe's Island in anticipation of the dedication.|$|E

5|$|Strong wind gusts downed nearly 1,500power {{lines and}} knocked over 28 large high tension wire towers at <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> in Mariel. As a result, {{more than half}} of the {{electricity}} customers in Havana Province were left without power for 12days after the storm, and all of Pinar del Río Province was without power for over 11days. Blackouts continued in areas where power returned. The power outages resulted in lack of drinking water for numerous people, including no potable water in the city of Havana for four days. As a result, the Cuban government sent water tanks to satisfy the short term need. Similarly, there was a lack of gas for cooking for over a week. However, one Cuban government official stated that it could take up to two months for basic utilities to be returned to many isolated villages.|$|E

The external cost of coal-fired and biomass <b>power</b> <b>plants</b> was compared, using the lifecycle approach. In addition, the external costs of <b>a</b> biomass <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> are calculated for each stage for comparison with those of <b>a</b> coal-fired <b>power</b> <b>plant.</b> The results highlight that the external costs of a coal-fired plant are 0. 072 US $/kWh, which are much {{higher than that of}} <b>a</b> biomass <b>power</b> <b>plant,</b> 0. 00012 US$/kWh. The external cost of coal-fired power generation is as much as 90 % of the current price of electricity generated by coal, while the external cost of <b>a</b> biomass <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> is 1 / 1000 of the current price of electricity generated by biomass.

5|$|The design {{challenges}} the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair (C) {{faced with this}} class were considerable, as the combined requirements of optimum hitting power, extreme speed and adequate protection taxed the knowledge of its naval architects and technology of the time.

To do so with a capital ship required a hull and <b>a</b> <b>power</b> <b>plant</b> of unprecedented size for a U.S. naval vessel, in addition to careful planning by its designers to ensure it would have enough longitudinal strength to withstand both bending forces while underway and any stress that might occur in combat. It took years between initial and final designs for engine and boiler technology to provide a plant of sufficient power that was also compact enough to allow a practical degree of protection, even in such large ships.|$|E
