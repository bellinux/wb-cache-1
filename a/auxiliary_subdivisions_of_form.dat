However, in the Masoretic text, the structure is hidden in a complicated set of diacritic symbols and the rich information is accessible only to a few trained scholars. In order to make the structural information available to the general public and to automatic processing by the computer, we built a tree bank where the hierarchical structure of each HB verse is explicitly represented in XML format. We coded the punctuation system in a context-tree grammar which was then used by a CYK parser to automatically generate trees for the whole HB. The results show that (1) the CFG correctly encoded the annotation rules and (2) the annotation done by the Masoretes is highly consistent. 1...|$|R

40|$|An {{examination}} {{has been}} made of the more important forms previously referred to the genus rhynchonella fischer de aldeas which occur in the chalk, with special attention to their internal structure. The morphology of the Mesozoic rhynchonellidae is discussed, and reference is made to the types of crura. Previous work on <b>subdivision</b> <b>of</b> Mesozoic <b>form</b> <b>of</b> Rhynohonella is reviewed. Reference is made to Wieniewska description of Rhynohonella; it is evident that no representatives of the genus sensu stricto have been recorded from the Chalk. The internal structure of Cyclothyris McCoy and that of Buckman's genus Stolmorhynchia to which he referred the Creteceous species invertebrates Rhynchonella sulcate (Parkinson), are discussed. Reference is also made to other Mesozoic Rhynchonellid genera including Lacunosella Wieniewska. Many Chalk Rhynchonellids were found to possess an internal structure similar to that of Stolmorhynchia Buckman and Lacunosella Wieniewska, and have been grouped in a new genus Platyrhynchia. They include the species Rhynchonella mantellianu (J. de C. Sowerby), P. wiestii (Quenstedt), R. cuvieri d'Orbigny, P. reedensis Etheridge and Terebratula obliqua James Sowerby, together with fourteen new species which are described in the paper. Rhynochonella plicatilis (James Sowerby) were found to have similar crura to those in Cyclothyris McCoy, but this median septum in the former is better developed. The species has been assigned to a new genus Cretirhynchia together with Rhynchonella Octoplicata (James Sowerby) Rhynchonella woodwardi Davidson, Rhynchonella limbata (Schlotheim) and four new species.
