40|$|The {{increasing}} {{deployment of}} renewable energies requires three fundamental {{changes to the}} electric grid: more transmission lines, a flexibilisation of the demand and grid scale energy storage. Liquid metal batteries (LMBs) are considered these days as a promising means of stationary energy storage. Built as a stable density stratification of two liquid metals separated by a liquid salt, LMBs have three main advantages: a low price, a long life-time and extremely high current densities.

Several unsuccessful {{attempts were made to}} repeat the one reported resolution of an organogermanium compound, [viz., ethylisopropylphenylbromogermane by silver (+) -bromocamphor-sulphonate]. This reaction is discussed and the reasons for its failure are suggested. At least a partial resolution of p-ethylisopropylphenyl-germylbenzoic acid was obtained by recrystallisation of its salt with (-) -quinine from ethanol at 0 °. The less-soluble material, on acid hydrolysis, gave a sample of solid germylbenzoic acid with a specific rotation of + 0. 38 °. The acid obtained, similarly, from the mother-liquor had a small rotation of opposite sign (- 0. 14 °). Samples of ethyl- 1 -naphthylphenylgermane with specific rotations of - 8. 75 ° and - 9. 53 ° respectively, were obtained by the lithium <b>aluminium</b> hydride <b>reduction</b> of the less-soluble (in pentane at low temperatures) diastereoisomers of ethyl- 1 -naphthylphenylgermanium (-) -menthoxide and ethyl-l-naphthyl-phenylgermanium (-) -phenylethoxide.

However, aluminium to copper joined by thermal welding processes presents challenges in terms of achieving good joint quality. This is attributed to their dissimilar mechanical and thermal properties which result in large stress gradients during heating. This study investigated joining of aluminium to copper sheets by electromagnetic pulse welding, which is a solid-state process that uses electromagnetic forces for joining of dissimilar materials. Hybrid sheet welds were obtained for all parameters conditions, selected according to a Taguchi L 18 design. The structural and mechanical characteristics were examined and related to the welding parameters {{by means of a}} Pareto analysis and response graphs. The welded zone started with a wavy interface with interfacial layers and defects and evolved to a flat interface without interfacial layers. The maximum transferable force depended on the minimum specimen thickness and the strength of the hybrid sheet weld. In case of <b>aluminium</b> sheet thickness <b>reduction,</b> the maximum transferable force was linearly correlated with the aluminium sheet thickness. High quality joints were obtained for no <b>aluminium</b> sheet thickness <b>reduction</b> and for a sheet weld strength which was at least as high as that of the base material.

An increase in weld width was achieved for an increase in capacitor charging energy and gap, whereas an increase in weld length was obtained for a decrease in gap.

40|$|Zusammenfassung (dt.) Abstract: The {{topic of}} this thesis is the linear {{stability}} analysis and reconstruction of an unstable aluminium-cryolite interface in an <b>aluminium</b> <b>reduction</b> cell with background flow and {{the reconstruction of}} the aluminum-cryolite interface. Two reconstruction problems are considered. In the first one the interface was reconstructed from the electric potential perturbation and in the second one from the magnetic field perturbation. Both perturbations resulted from the deviation of the aluminium-cryolite interface from its flat shape. The stability analysis of the <b>aluminium</b> <b>reduction</b> cell was performed on a simplified geometrical model. The propagation of gravitational waves in the infinite channel with insulating channel walls was observed. Homogeneous vertical electrical current and magnetic field were applied. Navier-Stokes equations were written in the shallow water approximation and then linearized. The stability thresholds are formed by the dimensionless velocity of the background flow and the MHD-parameter. Also the aspect ratio and the material parameter influence the stability limits. It is found that the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and the MHD- instability do not influence each other. The reconstruction of the interface in <b>aluminium</b> <b>reduction</b> cells from electrical potential measurement contains two classes of different problems. The forward problem concerns with the calculation of the electrical potential in the fluids if the interface shape between aluminium and cryolite is known. The inverse problem concerns with the determination of the unknown interface from a known potential distribution. In order to solve the forward problem the governing equations are linearized and solved analytically. The inverse problem was solved using standard techniques such as singular value decomposition (SVD). The optimal solution, which shows a compromise between data error and solution error, was found using a L-curve criterion. A numerical experiment is performed in order to validate the presented reconstruction method, which shows the robustness of the method with respect to the measurement error. For {{the reconstruction of the}} interface from magnetic field the forward problem was solved. The geometry under consideration contains an infinitely long rod with insulating walls and arbitrary form of the cross-section. Two fluids with different electrical conductivities and densities are superimposed. The vertical homogeneous electrical current flows throw the interface. The perturbation of the magnetic field and perturbation of electrical current are computed. Two examples are computed, one for a cylindrical and another for a rectangular cross-sections...|$|E

40|$|A new {{generation}} of lightweight subsea structures is planned for application in oil and gas production. Due to increasing weight of subsea installations, the use of aluminium as a structural material is of continuous interest. A problem is that galvanic corrosion will occur since not all steel components can be replaced by aluminium, and the two metals need to be isolated from each other. Another solution is to protect both metals from corrosion by a common cathodic protection system. The purpose of this thesis was to show by laboratory research if {{it is possible to}} protect steel-aluminium galvanic couples against corrosion by cathodic protection. Samples of X 65 carbon steel, 6005 aluminium and an AlZnIn sacrificial anode were studied by galvanic corrosion testing, open circuit testing and potential sweep. Steel and aluminium samples were connected in a simulated crevice of 100 μm to study the effect of galvanic crevice corrosion. Weight loss measurements were performed to determine corrosion rates, and the sample surfaces were characterized by SEM and EDS. Electrochemical testing was performed in both artificial seawater and a 3. 5 % NaCl solution. It was found that cathodic protection of steel-aluminium galvanic couples is possible in the absence of crevice corrosion. In a three-metal coupling, the sacrificial anode supplied cathodic current to both steel and <b>aluminium.</b> The <b>reduction</b> rate on steel was between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude larger than that on aluminium. The lower current density on aluminium was {{due to the fact that}} reduction only occurs on Fe-rich intermetallic particles in the Al matrix. During cathodic polarization of aluminium, an alkaline etching process caused detachment of these cathodic particles for surface pH sufficiently high. Calcareous deposits precipitated on steel under cathodic protection, but had little or no effect on the current density at a potential controlled by AlZnIn. Cathodic protection applied to a galvanic crevice between steel and aluminium gave a high local corrosion rate of aluminium near the crevice mouth. The steel was completely protected. The local corrosion rate of aluminium was sufficiently high to give anodic net current despite being connected to a sacrificial anode. The phenomena was an initial stage related to a potential and current distribution across the crevice. A very high local reduction rate on steel caused a high pH and thus corrosion of <b>aluminium.</b> The <b>reduction</b> rate on steel decreased as a function of time along with the corrosion rate of aluminium...|$|R
