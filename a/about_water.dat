5|$|As in {{the case}} of kelpies and water horses, most myths <b>about</b> <b>water</b> bulls are about males of the species. Occasionally a water cow is mentioned, as in the Highland tale set at Borrodale on Skye, where a water cow was reputed to reside in a small loch. Canine {{carcases}} left out to trap the beast were ignored. Sir Walter Scott also refers to a water cow in a story about an attempt to drain Loch na Beiste to kill one believed to be living there.|$|E

After decades of {{controversy}} <b>about</b> <b>water</b> rights, costs, migratory fish, and environmental impacts, removal or modification of remaining middle-reach dams as well as a partly finished dam on Elk Creek, a major tributary of the Rogue, began in 2008. The de-construction projects were all meant to improve salmon runs by allowing more fish to reach suitable spawning grounds.|$|E
5|$|The {{native forest}} in the Canberra region was almost wholly {{eucalypt}} species and provided a resource for fuel and domestic purposes. By the early 1960s, logging had depleted the eucalypt, and concern <b>about</b> <b>water</b> quality led to the forests being closed. Interest in forestry began in 1915 with trials {{of a number of}} species including Pinus radiata on the slopes of Mount Stromlo. Since then, plantations have been expanded, with the benefit of reducing erosion in the Cotter catchment, and the forests are also popular recreation areas.|$|E

5|$|Harris, then host of Rolf's Cartoon Time, {{approached}} the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) and the Tavistock Clinic with his idea {{about making a}} film on child sexual abuse. Both organisations were receptive. Harris had previous connections with the NSPCC, having appeared in films in 1963 and 1973 promoting the NSPCC League of Pity, and a NSPCC official suggested that he use child actors in Kids Can Say No! Harris approached director Jessica Skippon, {{with whom he had}} made a film <b>about</b> <b>water</b> safety, and said that he wanted to make Kids Can Say No! to protect children. Harris later said that production was hampered by colleagues opposing the idea that children should be told about sexual abuse.|$|E

25|$|With {{the growth}} in the {{population}} of Perth and Fremantle, concerns <b>about</b> <b>water</b> quality, pollution and adequate sewage disposal became widespread. Decades of proposals for sewage disposal and water supply systems followed, coupled with disagreement between the Town Councils and the Colony Government about responsibility for this area. An extensive water supply scheme was eventually compiled by the civil engineers Henry John Saunders and James Barratt in June 1887.|$|E

Onema has a good presence on the ground through nine interregional offices and departmental offices. Its functions are related to water resources and not to water supply and sanitation.|$|E

In the early 1980s he formed Alkibar, and influenced by his knowledge of agriculture, used their music to communicate with people <b>about</b> <b>water</b> and irrigation.|$|E
25|$|Legitimate {{concerns}} <b>about</b> <b>water</b> supply were exploited to gain {{backing for}} a huge engineering and legal effort to bring more water {{to the city and}} allow more development. The city fathers had their eyes on the Owens River, about 250 miles (400km) northeast of Los Angeles in Inyo County, near the Nevada state line. It was a permanent stream of fresh water fed by the melted snows of the eastern Sierra Nevada. It flowed through the Owens River Valley before emptying into the shallow, saline Owens Lake, where it evaporated.|$|E
25|$|From 1902 to 1905, Eaton and Mulholland used underhanded {{methods to}} obtain water rights and block the Bureau of Reclamation. The {{regional}} engineer of the Bureau, Joseph Lippincott, {{was a close}} associate of Eaton, Eaton was a nominal agent for the Bureau through Lippincott, so Eaton had access to inside information <b>about</b> <b>water</b> rights and could recommend actions to the Bureau that would be beneficial to Los Angeles. In return, while Lippincott was employed by the Bureau, he {{also served as a}} paid private consultant to Eaton, advising Los Angeles on how to best obtain water rights.|$|E

Some of the most prominent critics of the canal expansion plan {{from the point of view}} of water quality issues are Eric Jackson (editor of the online Panama News), Gonzalo Menendez (former head of Panama's National Environmental Authority), and Ariel Rodriguez (a biologist at the University of Panama), and former Vice Minister of Public Works Grettel Villalaz de Allen.|$|E
25|$|After Lin's {{injury in}} 1938, he {{suffered}} from ongoing {{physical and mental health}} problems. His exact medical condition is not well understood, partially because his medical records have never been publicly released. Dr. Li Zhisui, then one of Mao's personal physicians, believed that Lin suffered from neurasthenia and hypochondria. He became ill whenever he perspired, and suffered from phobias <b>about</b> <b>water,</b> wind, cold, light, and noise. He was said to become nervous at the sight of rivers and oceans in traditional Chinese paintings, and suffered from diarrhea, which could be triggered by the sound of running water. Li's account of Lin's condition is notably different from the official Chinese version.|$|E
25|$|Further {{improvements}} to the Lundwood sewage treatment works began in 2007 to enable it {{to comply with the}} Freshwater Fish Directive, and although the site was inundated during the floods of 2007, the scheme, which cost £8 million, was completed in 2008. To celebrate the opening of the new works, the poet Ian McMillan was asked to run a poetry workship at Littleworth Grange Primary Learning Centre, where children completed a poem <b>about</b> <b>water</b> treatment for which he supplied the first two lines. In June 2015, the Environment Agency announced that salmon had returned to the Dearne {{for the first time in}} 150 years. This follows the opening of a fish ladder at Sprotborough weir in 2014.|$|E

A warehouse in Nottingham was destroyed in 1818, when a cargo of gunpowder exploded, causing severe damage to the surrounding area. Competition from the railways began in the early 1840s, and rather than face continual decline, the company sold the canal to the Ambergate, Nottingham, Boston and Eastern Junction Railway. A series of amalgamations took place, and by 1861, the canal was owned by the Great Northern Railway, who did little to maintain it. Although 123,488 tons were carried in 1916, most of it was short-haul traffic between the Trent and the wharves of Nottingham. There were regular complaints <b>about</b> <b>water</b> levels on the lower section, but the railway did nothing to resolve the issues.|$|E
25|$|The British Food Standards Agency has in {{the past}} issued {{warnings}} <b>about</b> <b>water</b> claiming to be from the Zamzam Well containing dangerous levels of arsenic; such sales have also been reported in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where it is illegal to sell Zamzam water. The Saudi government has prohibited the commercial export of Zamzam water from the kingdom. In May 2011, a BBC London investigation found that water taken from taps connected to the Zamzam Well contained high levels of nitrate, potentially harmful bacteria, and arsenic at levels three times the legal limit in the UK, the same levels found in illegal water purchased in the UK. Arsenic is a carcinogen, raising concerns that any who regularly consume commercial Zamzam water in large quantities may be exposed to higher risks of cancer.|$|E
25|$|Most of the Barossa Valley makes {{extensive}} use of irrigation to supplement the region's low rainfall supply during the growing season. However, concerns <b>about</b> <b>water</b> supply in the late 20th and early 21st century {{led to the development}} of strict regulations on the numbers and locations of irrigation boreholes as well as the amount of water that can be used by vineyards. Some of the region's oldest vineyards, especially those on the slightly cooler west side of the valley, practice dryland farming. The increased water stress of the practice, coupled with the naturally reduced yields of old vines, tends to produce the most deeply concentrated grapes in the valley which often go into the Barossa Valley 's most expensive and sought after wines. Harvest usually begins in February and may be conducted in the cooler temperatures of night to help maintain acid levels.|$|E
