5|$|The {{gang members}} mostly dressed {{themselves}} as peasants and waited {{on street corners}} with revolvers and grenades. In contrast to the others, Kamo was disguised as a cavalry captain <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> square in a horse-drawn phaeton, a type of open carriage.|$|E
5|$|According to Professor Picotti, who {{extensively}} {{researched the}} conclave <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conclusion that simony had occurred, no accounts of papal {{income and expenditure}} exist in the registers of Introitus et Exitus for August 1492, and debts from the Apostolic Camera to Cardinals Campofregoso, Domenico della Rovere, Sanseverino, and Orsini appeared soon afterwards. The Spannocchi bank, which housed much of Borja's wealth, {{was said to have}} nearly crashed after the conclave due to the velocity of transactions.|$|E

5|$|Armstrong {{attended}} Cumloden School, {{a respected}} sporting {{member of the}} Schools Association, a group of smaller private schools in Melbourne. By 1893, he had found himself {{a spot in the}} school XI <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> attention of the press, catching the eye of journalists Reginald Wilmot and Tom Horan. Armstrong joined the nearby Caulfield Cricket Club and played in a senior premiership with the club at the age of 15.|$|E
5|$|Caragiale had by then {{proceeded}} to research the matter on his own, <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> independent conclusion that the accusations were entirely concocted. Late in 1901, he opened a legal case against both Caion and Stoenescu, {{taken up by the}} Ilfov County court. On the first day, Caion excused himself as sick, while Stoenescu recused himself, taking the prosecution's side. For these reasons, the trial was held without a jury.|$|E
5|$|German {{settlers}} {{began arriving}} in North America in the mid-seventeenth century. They were particularly attracted by William Penn's promise {{of religious freedom}} in the colony of Pennsylvania, <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Philadelphia region in significant numbers. By 1683, the German population was large enough to form communities such as Germantown (now a neighborhood in Philadelphia). Many of these immigrants brought with them their Lutheran faith and formed congregations in their new homeland.|$|E

His parents met in 1979 when Mike was {{assigned}} to duty at Coral Gables Hospital in Coral Gables, Florida, where Ileana worked. They married four years later. Their first son Mike Jr. was born in 1985, and Eric was born four years later in Miami.|$|E
5|$|Miller was Australia's top-scorer {{during the}} Victory Tests <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fore with his fast bowling. Miller was {{acclaimed}} for his free-spirited and adventurous batting, which he {{attributed to the}} triviality of sport in comparison to war. This was particularly exhibited in his 185 from 165 minutes for Dominions against England. It was through his involvement in wartime cricket that Miller met many of his future international colleagues, such as England's Denis Compton, Bill Edrich and Len Hutton.|$|E
5|$|The Duke {{eventually}} led his untrained and ill-equipped {{troops out of}} Bridgwater at around 10:00pm to undertake a night-time attack on the King's army. They were guided by Richard Godfrey, the servant of a local farmer, along the old Bristol road towards Bawdrip. With their limited cavalry in the vanguard, they turned south along Bradney Lane and Marsh Lane <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> open moor with its deep and dangerous rhynes (drainage ditches).|$|E

5|$|The {{first person}} on the Michigan staff to believe in Heikkinen was Heartley Anderson. A fellow native of the Upper Peninsula (Tamarack City, Michigan), Anderson played guard at Notre Dame from 1919 to 1921 and was Knute Rockne’s {{successor}} as Notre Dame’s head coach in 1931. In 1937, Anderson became Michigan’s line coach, <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conclusion during spring practice that Heikkinen was Michigan’s best football player. After a strong showing in spring practice, Heikkinen “hardened up” over the summer working at the Wakefield Iron.|$|E
5|$|American {{shipwreck}} hunter David Mearns {{first learned}} of the battle in 1996, and began to study it {{as a prelude to}} a search for the ships in 2001. Mearns, with the aid of other researchers, focused on primary sources (rediscovering several archive files and diaries in the process), <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conclusion that the German accounts were true, and that the ship would be found at the northern position. After attracting the interest of the RAN, Mearns entered into a partnership with HMAS Sydney Search, a not-for-profit company set up to administer and help fund an expedition to locate Sydney and Kormoran. State and Federal government grants totalling just under A$5 million, coupled with private and corporate donations, were used to fund a 45-day search from the end of February to early April 2008.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Philip J. Currie, {{benefiting from}} much more {{extensive}} finds {{and a general}} increase in anatomical knowledge of theropods, compared several tyrannosaurid skulls <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conclusion that the two species are more distinct than previously thought. The decision to use one or two genera is rather arbitrary, as the two species are sister taxa, {{more closely related to}} each other than to any other species. Recognizing this, Currie nevertheless recommended that Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus be retained as separate genera, as he concluded that they were no more similar than Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, which are almost always separated. In addition, several albertosaurine specimens have been recovered from Alaska and New Mexico, and Currie suggested that the Albertosaurus-Gorgosaurus situation may be clarified once these are described fully. Most authors have followed Currie's recommendation, but some have not.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-19thcentury, manor {{owners in}} Estonia found the native Estonian Horse {{too small for}} their {{agricultural}} needs, <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conclusion that the population would benefit from crossbreeding. Finnish horses were among the good quality breeds considered for the job. The state stud farm of Tori was founded as the central base for the new Estonian breed in 1856, and ten Finnish mares and three stallions were bought for its needs. Though some purebred Finnish horses were produced, they were used mainly for crossbreeding; the later offspring of part-Finnish crossbreds, however, did not prove as good as expected, and the Tori stud gradually stopped using Finnish horses. One Finnish-Arabian stallion, Orro, has had noteworthy influence on the modern-day Tori horse, through his widely used great-grandson Harun 42 T.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match against Glamorgan, McCool neither batted nor bowled in a rain-affected draw {{that did not}} reach the second innings. In the {{following}} fixture against Warwickshire, McCool did not bowl in the first innings and scored 19, before taking 4/56 in the second innings, helping {{to set up a}} win by nine wickets. McCool was then rested as Australia faced and drew with Lancashire for the second time on the tour. He returned for the non-first-class match against Durham, <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> crease with Australia in trouble at 3/22. He top-scored with 64 to help Australia reach 282 all out. McCool took 1/17 as the hosts fell to 5/73 in reply when rain ended the match after the first day. After taking only seven wickets at 61.00 in the first four Tests, Johnson was dropped for the Fifth Test at The Oval. However, it was fellow leg spinner Ring and not McCool who was called in. Australia crushed England by an innings and 149 runs to take the series 40.|$|E
5|$|Orr {{signed with}} Chicago, but his {{injuries}} limited him to only 26 games {{over the next}} three seasons. He sat out the entire 1977–78 season. By 1978, Orr had undergone over a dozen knee surgeries, was having trouble walking and barely skated anymore. However, in the summer of 1978, he decided to make a comeback. He played six games of the 1978–79 season <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conclusion that he could no longer play and informed the Black Hawks that he was retiring. He started a new role as an assistant to Chicago general manager Bob Pulford. He scored his last NHL goal and point against Detroit on October 28, 1978, at Detroit's Olympia Stadium.|$|E

5|$|T.J. {{was born}} on June 6, 1981 in Beirut, Lebanon. He is of Armenian descent; {{he grew up in}} Cyprus, <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> US {{for the first time in}} 1999. He is a Fulbright Scholar {{pursuing}} a master's degree in student affairs administration at Michigan State University. Outgoing and involved, T.J. is active in several student organizations pertaining to performance art, gender, and social change. He lives with other students in a housing cooperative. His mother lives in a close-knit Armenian community in Cyprus, where the news would surely travel if T.J. transitions. Because his mother opposes his transition, and because he must return to Cyprus for two years due to a travel visa requirement, he has not yet started HRT.|$|E
5|$|The {{match between}} Randy Orton and Shawn Michaels followed. During an {{interview}} segment before the match, Orton attacked Michaels. Before the match began, Orton stood {{alone in the}} ring and declared himself the winner by forfeit. Michaels, however, appeared <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ring, although he showed signs of injury. Michaels came into the match with a legitimate knee injury. During the match, Orton tried to perform a superplex over the top turnbuckle, but Michaels used an eye rake and caused Orton to fall. Michaels followed up with a diving elbow drop and tried to execute Sweet Chin Music, but collapsed in the process. The referee declared Orton the winner as a result. After the match, Orton attacked Michaels again, causing a kayfabe career-threatening concussion.|$|E
5|$|In 708, some monks at Hexham accused Bede {{of having}} {{committed}} heresy {{in his work}} De Temporibus. The standard theological view of world history {{at the time was}} known as the Six Ages of the World; in his book, Bede calculated the age of the world for himself, rather than accepting the authority of Isidore of Seville, <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conclusion that Christ had been born 3,952 years after the creation of the world, rather than the figure of over 5,000 years that was commonly accepted by theologians. The accusation occurred in front of the bishop of Hexham, Wilfrid, who was present at a feast when some drunken monks made the accusation. Wilfrid did not respond to the accusation, but a monk present relayed the episode to Bede, who replied within a few days to the monk, writing a letter setting forth his defence and asking that the letter also be read to Wilfrid. Bede had another brush with Wilfrid, for the historian himself says that he met Wilfrid, sometime between 706 and 709, and discussed Æthelthryth, the abbess of Ely. Wilfrid had been present at the exhumation of her body in 695, and Bede questioned the bishop about the exact circumstances of the body and asked for more details of her life, as Wilfrid had been her advisor.|$|E
