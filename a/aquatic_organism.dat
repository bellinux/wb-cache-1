Moreover, an oasis of short-lived summer ponds that occur in swales {{at the base of}} the dunes support migratory shore birds and waders, as well as large game animals such as elk. Cattle, sheep, and free roaming wild horses also frequent the ponds. The fresh water also provides a habitat for <b>aquatic</b> <b>organism</b> such as salamanders and freshwater shrimp.|$|E
50|$|Undersized {{and poorly}} placed {{culverts}} can cause problems for {{water quality and}} aquatic organisms. Poorly designed culverts can degrade water quality via scour and erosion and also restrict aquatic organisms {{from being able to}} move freely between upstream and downstream habitat. Fish are a common victim in the loss of habitat due to poorly designed crossing structures. Culverts that offer adequate <b>aquatic</b> <b>organism</b> passage reduce impediments to movement of fish, wildlife and other aquatic life that require instream passage. These structures are less likely to fail in medium to large scale rain and snow melt events.|$|E
5000|$|Ecological {{death is}} the {{inability}} of an organism to function in an ecological context, leading to death. [...] This term {{can be used in}} many fields of biology to describe any species. In the context of aquatic toxicology, a toxic chemical, or toxicant, directly affects an <b>aquatic</b> <b>organism</b> but does not immediately kill it; instead it impairs an organism’s normal ecological functions which then lead to death or lack of offspring. The toxicant makes the organism unable to function ecologically in some way, even though it does not suffer obviously from the toxicant. [...] Ecological death may be caused by sublethal toxicological effects that can be behavioral, physiological, biochemical, or histological.|$|E

50|$|Dissolved oxygen is {{an element}} which is {{necessary}} {{for a number of}} biological and chemical reactions which are critical to the proper functioning of the ecosystem. Some of the biological processes which alter the concentrations of dissolved oxygen include photosynthesis and <b>aquatic</b> <b>organism</b> respiration. Due to the role that photosynthesis plays in dissolved oxygen concentrations in a body of water. Oxygen profiles are affected by photosynthesis, wind mixing of surface waters, and respiration or organic matter, such that oxygen declines similar to the temperature profile. These profiles are based on similar principles as thermal stratification and light penetration. Since dissolved oxygen concentrations are driven primarily by photosynthesis, the amount of sunlight is a limiting factor in terms of how much photosynthesis can occur within the different levels of the water column where light is readily available. This means that dissolved oxygen levels are generally lower as you move deeper into the body of water because of the lower availability of light in those parts of the water.|$|E
50|$|Since {{movement}} {{of an object}} through water inevitably creates {{movement of}} the water itself, and this resulting water motion persists and travels, the detection of hydrodynamic stimuli is useful for sensing conspecifics, predators, and prey. Many studies are based upon {{the question of how}} an <b>aquatic</b> <b>organism</b> can capture prey despite darkness or apparent lack of visual or other sensory systems and find that the sensing of hydrodynamic stimuli left by prey is probably responsible. As for detection of conspecifics, harbor seal pups will enter the water with their mother, but eventually ascend to obtain oxygen, and then dive again to rejoin the mother. Observations suggest that the tracking of water movements produced by the mother and other pups allows this rejoining to occur. Through these trips and the following of conspecifics, pups might learn routes to avoid predators and good places to find food, showing the possible significance of hydrodynamic detection to these seals.|$|E
50|$|The incarnations of Vishnu (Dashavatara) {{is almost}} {{identical}} to the scientific explanation of the sequence of biological evolution of man and animals. The sequence of avatars starts from an <b>aquatic</b> <b>organism</b> (Matsya), to an amphibian (Kurma), to a land-animal (Varaha), to a humanoid (Narasimha), to a dwarf human (Vamana), to 5 forms of well developed human beings (Parashurama, Rama, Balarama/Buddha, Krishna, Kalki) who showcase an increasing form of complexity (Axe-man, King, Plougher/Sage, wise Statesman, mighty Warrior). In fact, many Hindu gods are represented with features of animals {{as well as those}} of humans, leading many Hindus to easily accept evolutionary links between animals and humans. In India, the home country of Hindus, educated Hindus widely accept the theory of biological evolution. In a survey of 909 people, 77% of respondents in India agreed with Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution, and 85 per cent of God-believing people said they believe in evolution as well.|$|E

40|$|The {{internal}} metal sequestration {{strategies of}} different <b>aquatic</b> <b>organisms</b> {{are complex and}} variable; thus it is a formidable task to predict metal toxicity. Metals accumulated by <b>aquatic</b> <b>organisms</b> are associated with different subcellular compartments (i. e. heat-sensitive proteins, heat-stable proteins (metallothioneins), granules, cellular debris, and organelles). Such subcellular partitioning is dynamic in response to metal exposure and other environmental conditions, and is metal- and organism-specific. Previous models predicting metal toxicity have relied on the free ion metal activity (i. e. the free ion activity model) or more recently on the metal binding with the proposed toxicological site of action (i. e. the biotic ligand model). Neither of these models considers the complexity of internal metal subcellular fractionation, which may significantly affect metal toxicity in <b>aquatic</b> <b>organisms</b> and subsequent trophic transfer of metals to consumers. Recent studies in small <b>aquatic</b> <b>organisms</b> have revealed that the subcellular partitioning model (SPM) may provide an improved method to predict Cd toxicity, but more studies are needed in the future...|$|R
