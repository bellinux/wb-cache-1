The increased concentration of lithium oxide on the mayenite (from 5 to 10  wt% of impregnation) and the support catalysts larger surface properties, give rise to low mass transfer limitations and high triglyceride conversions. The slight drop in BD yield when 10  wt% of the catalyst M 2 is loaded into the reactor suggests that the steady agitation rate—this variable was kept constant at 180  rpm for all the experiments—might affect the reaction environment reducing the turbulent regime in the reactor and leading to an increase of the mass transfer limitations.|$|E

It is especially useful when some side processes occur at the disk (e. g. passivation film growth) along with the main electrochemical reaction that produces the soluble redox-active specie. Unfortunately, the detected ring signal is delayed and smeared so that fast changes of the disk processes intensities cannot be studied. The deconvolution approach is a mathematical data processing procedure that enables reconstruction of the disk signal with hypothetically infinite accuracy. Although there are practical limitations arising mainly from impossibility of exact measurement of the impulse response function and inevitable presence of a noise component in the ring signal used for the reconstruction.

40|$|Electrocoagulation is an {{empirical}} (and largely heuristic) water treatment technology {{that has had}} many different applications over the last century. It has proven its viability by removing {{a wide range of}} pollutants. The approach to reactor design has been haphazard, however, with little or no reference to previous designs or underlying principles. This thesis reviewed these reactor designs, identifying key commonalities and synthesising a new design hierarchy, summarised by three main decisions: 1. Batch or continuous operation; 2. Coagulation only or coagulation plus flotation reactors, and; 3. Associated separation process if required. This design decision hierarchy thereby provides a consistent basis for future electrocoagulation reactor designs. Electrochemistry, coagulation, and flotation are identified as the key foundation sciences for electrocoagulation, and the relevant mechanisms (and their interactions) are extracted and applied in an electrocoagulation context. This innovative approach was applied to a 7 L batch electrocoagulation reactor treating clay-polluted water. Structured macroscopic experiments identified current (density), time, and mixing as the key operating parameters for electrocoagulation. A dynamic mass balance was conducted over the batch reactor, for the first time, thereby enabling the extraction of a concentration profile. For this batch system, three operating stages were then identifiable: lag, reactive, and stable stages. Each stage was systematically investigated (in contrast to the previous ad hoc approach) with reference to each of the foundation sciences and the key parameters of current and time. Electrochemical behaviour characterised both coagulant and bubble generation. Polarisation experiments were used to determine the rate-limiting step at each electrode's surface. Consequently the appropriate Tafel parameters were extracted and hence the cell potential. At low currents both electrodes (anode and cathode) operated in the charge-transfer region. As the current increased, the mechanism shifted towards the diffusion-limited region, which increased the required potential. Polarisation experiments also define the operating potential at each electrode thereby enabling aluminium's dissolution behaviour to be thermodynamically characterised on potential-pH (Pourbaix) diagrams. Active and passive regions were defined and hence the aluminium's behaviour in an aqueous environment can now be predicted for electrocoagulation. Novel and detailed solution chemistry modelling of the metastable and stable aluminium species revealed the importance of oligomer formation and their rates in electrocoagulation. In particular, formation of the positively trimeric aluminium species increased solution pH (to pH 10. 6), beyond the experimentally observed operable pH of 9. Thereby signifying the importance of the formation kinetics to the trimer as the <b>active</b> coagulant <b>specie</b> in electrocoagulation. Further leading insights to the changing coagulation mechanism in electrocoagulation were possible by comparison and contrast with the conventional coagulation method of alum dosing. Initially in the lag stage, little aggregation is observed until the coagulant concentration reaches a critical level. Simultaneously, the measured zeta potential increases with coagulant addition and the isoelectric point is attained in the reactive stage. Here a sorption coagulation mechanism is postulated; probably charge neutralisation, that quickly aggregates pollutant particles forming open structured aggregates as indicated by the low fractal dimension. As time progresses, pollutant concentration decreases and aluminium addition continues hence aluminium hydroxide/oxide precipitates. The bubbles gently sweep the precipitate through the solution, resulting in coagulation by an enmeshment mechanism (sweep coagulation). Consequently compact aggregates are formed, indicating by the high fractal dimension. Flotation is an inherent aspect of the batch electrocoagulation reactor via the production of electrolytic gases. In the reactor, pollutant separation occurs in situ, either by flotation or settling. From the concentration profiles extracted, original kinetic expressions were formulated to quantify these competing removal processes. As current increases, both settling and flotation rate constants increased due to the additional coagulant generation. This faster removal was offset by a decrease in the coagulant efficiency. Consequently a trade-off exists between removal time and coagulant efficiency that can be evaluated economically. A conceptual framework of electrocoagulation is developed from the synthesis of the systematic study to enable a priori prediction. This framework creates predictability for electrocoagulation, which is innovative and original for the technology. Predictability provides insights to knowledge transfer (between batch and continuous), efficient coagulant and separation path, {{to name just a few}} examples. This predictability demystifies electrocoagulation by providing a powerful design tool for the future development of scaleable, industrial electrocoagulation water treatment design and operation process...|$|R

The main {{objective}} of this work has been the preparation and characterisation of new hybrid oraganic-inorganic materials prepared via sol-gel. This method allows the incorporation of either ionopheres or electroactive biomolecules giving rise to nanocomposite materials able to be processed as active phases of composite membranes for ion separations or as coatings of all solid state electrodes for electrochemical sensors of ions and molecules. Tetrametoxysilane (TMOS) and γ [...] metacryloxypropyltrimetoxysilane (MAPTS) have been employed as precursors for {{the preparation of the}} active phase of membranes and electrode coatings. By adding an <b>active</b> <b>specie,</b> ionopheres such as crown-ethers (12 C 4, 15 C 5 and 18 C 6), thiocrown-ethers (MAO) and natural antibiotics (nonactine), or enzymes, as for instance glucose oxidase, under controlled experimental conditions, the hydrolysis/condensation reactions yield and homogeneous organopolysiloxane network in which the selected <b>active</b> <b>specie</b> remains entrapped. The characterisation of the resulting materials has been carried out by means of different experimental techniques including chemical analysis, FTIR and NMR-MAS-HR (13 C and 29 Si) spectroscopies, TG and DTA thermal analyses and specific surface area determinations. The texture and morphology of the composite membranes has been study by SEM. The presence of the ionophores in the active phase of both the composite membranes and the electrode coatings confers its selectivity due to the hydrophobic character of the organopolisiloxane matrix and the hydrophilic properties conferred either by the ionophores, complexing agents, or by the enzymes, such as certain oxido-reductases, that produce electrochemical response in the presence of electroactive species. The electrochemical devices developed from these materials have been tested for analysis of a large variety of ions an molecules showing specific selectivity. The application of the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and other electrochemical techniques, as chronopotentiometry and chronoamperometry, to study the mechanisms operating in the sensors reveals that the electrochemical response of the device depends {{on the nature of the}} incorporated ionophere or enzime. Thus, the resulting materials act as an active phase either of membranes and sensors, which are specific for alkaline metal ions, lead (II), silver (I) and ammonium, or of specific biosensor for glucose.

We have experimentally investigated this heme environment by resonance Raman spectra of both substrate-free and substrate-bound forms of the purified enzyme. The Fe-CO stretching mode (îFe-CO) of the CO complex and Fe 3 +-S stretching mode (îFe-S) of the oxidized form were monitored as a structural marker of the distal and proximal sides of the heme, respectively. The îFe-CO mode was upshifted from 477 to 485 and to 490 cm- 1 by the binding of androstenedione and 19 -aldehyde-androstenedione, substrates {{for the first and}} third steps, respectively, whereas îFe-CO was not observed for P 450 arom with 19 -hydroxyandrostenedione, a substrate for the second step, indicating that the heme distal site is very flexible and changes its structure depending on the substrate. The 19 -aldehyde-androstenedione binding could reduce the electron donation from the axial thiolate, which was evident from the low-frequency shift of îFe-S by 5 cm- 1 compared to that of androstenedione-bound P 450 arom.

The evaluation of ACE in vivo inhibitory effect was performed comparing the mean arterial pressure before and after ERE (10 mg/kg) in animals which received injection of angiotensin I (ANG I; 0, 03, 03 and 300 µg/kg, i. v.). Captopril (30 mg/kg) was used as positive control. Bulbostylis capillaris (86. 89 ± 15. 20 %) and ERE (74. 89 ± 11. 95 %, ERE) were considered active in the in vitro ACE inhibition assay, at 100 µg/mL concentration. ACh lead to a hypotensive effect before and after ERE's curve (- 40 ± 5 % and - 41 ± 3 %). ERE showed a dose-dependent hypotensive effect and a in vivo ACE inhibitory effect. Cyperaceae species showed an inhibitory activity of ACE, in vitro, as well as high content of total phenolic and flavonoids. ERE exhibited an inhibitory effect on both in vitro and in vivo ACE. The selection of species used in popular medicine as antidotes, along with the in vitro assay of ACE inhibition, might be a biomonitoring method for the screening of new medicinal plants with hypotensive properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{oxygenation}} {{of organic}} sulfides is studied for three main reasons: 1) {{the potential for}} desulphurization of fuels 2) the development of decontamination protocols for sulfur containing chemical warfare agents such as mustard gas and V-agents and 3) {{the utility of the}} sulfoxide in organic synthesis. In this research, the polyoxometalate catalyst [gamma-SiW 10 (H 2 O) 2 O 34] 4 - is immobilized via both physisorbed and a chemisorbed methods: the first being supported upon simple MCM- 41 while the second is supported on an amine functionalized MCM- 41. Recycling reactions of both catalysts up to six reactions show a significant advantage with respect to reusability for the chemisorbed catalyst. This catalyst is also demonstrated to be useful for a variety of organic sulfide substrates such as phenyl sulfide, benzothiophene and dibenzothiophene. ^ Also reported is the synthesis of a small di-metallic isopolymetalate, Mo 2 O 112 -. This compound was characterized via X-ray diffraction, UV-vis and ATR-IR spectroscopy. Reactions with hydrogen peroxide and various organic sulfides showed high activity with catalyst loadings as low as 0. 2 %. Kinetic investigations showed pseudo-first order dependence on catalyst concentration and no dependence on hydrogen peroxide concentration. A variety of mechanistic investigations were made including: Hammett correlation, reactions with a radical scavenger and stoichiometric reactions. On the basis of this evidence a mechanism for the activation of hydrogen peroxide is proposed. In a result that opens the way to future inquiries, the catalyst Mo 2 O 112 - was also found to facilitate the activation of tert-butyl hydroperoxide. ^ Lastly, the activation of hydrogen peroxide for sulfide oxygenation via a class of di-ruthenium tetracarboxylates is presented. In particular the synthesis and characterization of Ru 2 (3 -hydroxybenzoate) 4 Cl is presented and its utility is compared via catalysis and kinetics to Ru 2 (OAc) 4 Cl and Ru 2 (esp) 2 Cl. Also, the reactivity of Ru 2 (hedp) 2 Cl is studied to yield insight into a possible Ru 2 (III,III) <b>active</b> <b>specie.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Several nanocomposites of {{the type}} CuO/LaNiO 3 (Cu@LaNiO 3) have been {{developed}} for application as noble metal free catalysts in TWC. The nanocomposites have been obtained by depositing copper oxide on lanthanum nickelate. The supporting perovskite has been prepared by means of the citrate route; copper, in contrast, was deposited by means of an innovative procedure: ammonia driven deposition precipitation method (ADP) optimized for deposition on perovskites. The nanocomposites have been developed based on the catalytic activity of LaNiO 3 in oxidation and reforming reactions and of copper in reduction reactions. Nanocomposition is thus used to deposit a highly dispersed <b>active</b> <b>specie</b> (CuO) on an active support (LaNiO 3) with the aim of building catalytic functionality. The obtained nanocomposites have been characterized by means of XRD, XPS, SEM, TPR, BET, EDX, and ICP and the obtained results are correlated to the amount of copper deposited and to the reactivity. The reactivity was studied first in two model reactions, CO oxidation and CO assisted NO reduction, in order to investigate the role played by the different species. Moreover, the reactivity under real conditions, i. e. with a complex mixture reflecting the actual automotive exhaust composition, was considered to evaluate the real applicability. Finally, high-temperature deactivation was investigated. XPS reveals that the deposition of copper oxide affects the surface composition of the nanocomposites; the XRD, SEM, and TPR results confirm that CuO is deposited on the LaNiO 3 surface and no diffusion below surface is observed. CuO species are deposited both as highly dispersed phase and as bigger particles; the relative amount of these phases depends on the total amount of copper deposited. The reactivity in the CO oxidation reaction is not significantly affected by the copper deposition. In contrast the reactivity in NO reduction is strongly enhanced by the presence of highly dispersed copper species. Activity tests with mixture reflecting actual automotive exhaust, reveal an enhancement in CO oxidation, but no NO decomposition at stoichiometric conditions. Complete NO reduction is achieved at rich conditions; also, hydrocarbons reforming reactions typically occurring at substoichiometric O 2, with CO and H 2 production, are less supported, preserving the activity in NO reduction. Finally, the high-temperature aging test confirmed an interesting stability of catalytic activity...|$|E
40|$|Proyecto de Graduación (Bachillerato en Ingeniería en Biotecnología). Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica. Escuela de Biología, 2011. Aspergilli is {{the name}} given to a family of {{saprophytic}} and ubiquitous fungus, that are important as industrial microorganisms, responsible of the large-scale production of several metabolites and enzymes. From this genus, Aspergillus fumigatus {{is one of the}} most important, because it is known as the leading mold pathogen in immunocompromised patients, causing aspergillosis, which is an infection that affects the respiratory system. Several studies revealed that one crucial step of the infection is the acquisition of nutrients, like iron, which availability in the human serum is really limited. For that reason, A. fumigatus biosynthesizes siderophores, to overcome the problem of limited iron accessible. For the synthesis of these molecules, A. fumigatus use an enzyme called N 5 -ornithine hydroxylase (AfSidA), which catalyzes the first committed step in the synthesis. The information of the enzyme is really limited, however the siderophore system have attracted much attention, so the enzyme, which represents a possible target for fungal therapies, that is why biochemical analysis are important. The principal objective was the evaluation in vitro of the enzymatic activity of the ornithine hydroxylase, by varying the concentration of selected compounds and pH. For these evaluations, AfSidA was first, expressed and purified; then according to the activity and stability of the enzyme in a series of buffers, a buffer system was selected to performed oxygen consumption assays, using constant concentrations of coenzyme, NADH 1 mM, and enzyme, 2 uM; and varying the concentrations of the selected substrates, L-ornithine and L-lysine. Also an analysis of a possible effect caused by NADH was done. The results obtained in both profiles using the substrates were very similar, obtaining for the kcat profile one pK related to the formation of an active species, while in both kcat/KM profiles, two pKs were presented, the lower one representing the formation of an active species and the higher one, the transition to a less active species. In the case of the NADH profile, no uncoupling effect was observed, and tow ionizable groups were identified. The pKs resultants form the analysis can be highly related to a deprotonation on the substrates, leading to the formation of <b>active</b> <b>specie,</b> or the activation of the enzyme, when it reacts with NADH; and the protonation pKs can be linked to the formation of the protonated intermediate, C 4 a-peroxyflan.

40|$|Os complexos [RuCl 2 (PPh 3) 3], cct-[RuCl 2 (CO) 2 (PPh 3) 2], ttt-[RuCl 2 (CO) 2 (PPh 3) 2], [RuCl 2 (CO) 2 (PPh 3) (pip) ] e [RuCl 2 (CO) (PPh 3) 2 (DMF) ] foram investigados em ROMP de norborneno. O objetivo foi observar a influência eletrônica das moléculas CO, PPh 3, piperidina e dimetilformamida como ligantes ancilares na reatividade dos complexos. Experimentos realizados por 1 h à 50 °C na razão [NBE]/[Ru] = 5000 mostraram que o complexo [RuCl 2 (CO) 2 (PPh 3) (pip) ] é inerte para ROMP, o complexo cct-[RuCl 2 (CO) 2 (PPh 3) 2] apresentou valores não maiores que 1 % e o complexo ttt-[RuCl 2 (CO) 2 (PPh 3) 2] formou 3, 75 % de poliNBE. Sugere-se que a reação ocorra pela liberação de uma molécula de CO para a formação do complexo carbeno, o que explica a reatividade dos diferentes complexos. O complexo [RuCl 2 (CO) (PPh 3) 2 (DMF) ] foi ativo tanto a 50 como a 25 °C, com 25, 0 and 12, 2 % de rendimento, respectivamente, com a razão [NBE]/[Ru] = 5000 por 1 h. A atividade desse complexo está associada à liberação da molécula DMF, como observado nos espectros de RMN de 31 P e UV-visível. Os valores de IPD e Mn foram 1, 7 - 1, 8 e na ordem de 104 g/mol, respectivamente. A outra espécie presente em solução foi observada por RMN de 31 P na razão de 2 / 3 o qual foi inerte para ROMP. Assim, considerando apenas 1 / 3 de espécie ativa, o rendimento de poliNBE pode ser aceito como cerca de 75 e 36 % à 50 e 25 °C, respectivamente. O valor à 50 °C é similar àquele obtido com o {{precursor}} [RuCl 2 (PPh 3) 3] (70 % de rendimento em 5 min) e melhor que à 25 °C, no qual o precursor é inerte. Os resultados obtidos mostraram que os complexos contendo CO ácido-π como ligante ancilar podem ser ativos para ROMP de norborneno quando uma posição lábil no complexo ocorra. The complexes [RuCl 2 (PPh 3) 3], cct-[RuCl 2 (CO) 2 (PPh 3) 2], ttt-[RuCl 2 (CO) 2 (PPh 3) 2], [RuCl 2 (CO) 2 (PPh 3) (pip) ] and [RuCl 2 (CO) (PPh 3) 2 (DMF) ] {{were investigated}} for ROMP of norbornene. The {{aim is to}} observe the electronic influence of the CO, PPh 3, piperidine and dimethylformamide molecules as ancillary ligands in the reactivity of the complexes. Experiments performed for 1 h at 50 °C with the ratio [NBE]/[Ru] = 5000 showed that the complex [RuCl 2 (CO) 2 (PPh 3) (pip) ] is inert for ROMP, the complex cct-[RuCl 2 (CO) 2 (PPh 3) 2] yielded values not higher than 1 % and the complex ttt-[RuCl 2 (CO) 2 (PPh 3) 2] provided 3. 75 % of polyNBE. It is suggested that the reactions occur via release of a CO molecule {{for the formation of}} the carbene complex, thus explains the reactivity of the different complexes. The complex [RuCl 2 (CO) (PPh 3) 2 (DMF) ] was active either at 50 or 25 °C, with 25. 0 and 12. 2 % yield, respectively, with the ratio [NBE]/[Ru] = 5000 for 1 h. The activity of this complex is associated to the release of the DMF molecule, as observed in the 31 P NMR and UV-visible spectra. The IPD and Mn values were 1. 7 - 1. 8 and 104 g/mol in magnitude. Other specie present in solution was observed in the 31 P NMR spectra in a ratio of 2 / 3 which is inert for ROMP. Thus, considering just 1 / 3 of <b>active</b> <b>specie,</b> the yield of polyNBE can be acceptable as c. a. 75 and 36 % at 50 or 25 °C, respectively. The value at 50 °C is similar to that obtained with the precursor [RuCl 2 (PPh 3) 3] (70 % yield for 5 min) and better at 25 °C, where the precursor is inert. The obtained results showed that the complexes containing π-acid CO as ancillary ligand can be active for ROMP of norbornene when a labile position in the complex occurs...|$|E
