40|$|In the {{nanotechnology}} field, some existing {{materials and}} applications are {{harmful to the}} environment, not efficient for certain tasks, or too expensive to be fully utilized. Graphene is a strong and cheap material {{that can be used}} to improve current nanotechnologies for more practical uses in society. Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) is an orientation of graphene layers that exhibit different properties than regular bilayer graphene. It is made by placing a single layer of graphene on top of another at an angle with respect to the other lattice orientation. Understanding the characteristics of TBG is important to uncover more physics of graphene as well as interesting applications for TBG directly. By means of mechanical exfoliation with single layer graphene, we can isolate single layers of graphene. We used <b>a</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>device</b> that uses a vacuum chamber and heater to align the layers and create TBG with different twist angles. Raman Spectroscopy tests are done to find band energy peaks and document how those peaks change with respect to the twist angle. The process of transferring single layer graphene onto boron nitride substrates was initiated. Further work includes transferring a second layer on top of the substrate and running Raman tests to check its properties. Further research is needed to fully understand the characteristics of graphene, but understanding the energy properties of TBG will give valuable insight...|$|E

40|$|Dental {{implants}} {{have been}} used in a variety of different forms for many years. Since the mid- 20 th century, there has been an increase in interest in the implant process for the replacement of missing teeth. Branemark was one of the initial pioneers who applied scientifically based research techniques to develop an endosseous implant that forms an immobile connection with bone. The need for a dental implant to completely address multiple physical and biological factors imposes tremendous constraints on the surgical and handling protocol. Metallic dental implants have been successfully used for decades, but they have serious shortcomings related to their bony union and the fact that their mechanical properties do not match those of bone. However, anatomic limitation and restorative demands encourage the surgeon to gain precision in planning and surgical positioning of dental implants. Ideal placement of the implant facilitates the establishment of favorable forces on the implants and the prosthetic component as well as ensures an aesthetic outcome. Therefore, it is advisable to establish a logical continuity between the planned restoration and the surgical phases, it is essential to use <b>a</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>device</b> that for sure increases the predictability of success. The surgical guide template is fabricated by a dental technician after the presurgical restorative appointments that primarily include determination of occlusal scheme and implant angulations.

40|$|The {{heat from}} {{high-power}} microdevices for space, such as Xilinx Virtex 4 and 5 (V 4 and V 5), {{has to be}} removed mainly through conduction in the space vacuum environment. The class-Y type packages are designed to remove {{the heat from the}} top of the package, and the most effective method to remove heat from the class-Y type packages is to attach <b>a</b> heat <b>transfer</b> <b>device</b> on the lid of the package and to transfer the heat to frame or chassis.
