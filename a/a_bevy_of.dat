He commanded a number of ships of the line in the following years, in the Baltic, North Sea and off of the French coast.

He married in 1818 and died in 1826, having served with prominent naval officers like Hood, Jervis and Nelson in a long and distinguished career.|$|E
5|$|The Las Vegas {{situation}} {{was one of}} <b>a</b> <b>bevy</b> <b>of</b> developments that absorbed the league in the 1994 to 1995 offseason. The team was not officially disbanded until April 1995 but not before the league damaged its credibility by twice giving provisional approval to a relocation to Jackson, Mississippi, {{to the point where}} the Mississippi team was included on the 1995 internal schedule and had hired a general manager and coaching staff, only to have the deal collapse amid squabbles with the Las Vegas corporation that owned the Posse. A group from Miami, Florida tried to convince the league to let it buy the remains of the Posse and move them to South Florida as the Miami Manatees in the Miami Orange Bowl. An exhibition game between Birmingham and Baltimore was held there in June 1995 to gauge support, which drew a decent crowd just above 20,000.|$|E

50|$|His voice resounded {{far above}} {{all the rest of}} the Congregation. The {{schoolmaster}} was a man of some importance in the female circle of a rural neighborhood; being considered a kind of idle, gentlemanlike personage, of vastly superior taste and accomplishments to the rough country swains, and, indeed, inferior in learning only to the parson. He was peculiarly happy in the smiles of all the country damsels. How he would figure among them in the churchyard, between services on Sundays; gathering grapes for them from the wild vines that overran the surrounding trees; reciting for their amusement all the epitaphs on the tombstones; or sauntering, with <b>a</b> whole <b>bevy</b> <b>of</b> them, along the banks of the adjacent millpond; while the more bashful country bumpkins hung sheepishly back, envying his superior elegance and address.|$|R

Local 691 argued Irving simply wished to lengthen the work week without paying workers overtime rates. The strike lasted 27 months and was based on Irvings’ demands for flexibility of the workers to ensure the refinery was competitive. The strike is seen as symbolic of a rollback of labour and democratic collective bargaining rights {{that have been in}} decline across North America.|$|E
25|$|Sarada {{lived the}} simple life of an Indian village girl. As a child Sarada—then known as Saradamani—was fascinated by {{traditional}} Hindu folklore and narratives. As {{in the case of}} most girls of rural upbringing, she did not receive any formal education but learned to serve others as she helped her mother run a large household and looked after her younger brothers. During the terrible famine of 1864, Sarada worked ceaselessly as her family served food to hungry people. She was interested in the clay models of goddesses Kali and Lakshmi, which she worshiped regularly. She is said to have started meditating from her childhood and traditional accounts recount her mystic visions and experiences. According to Sarada Devi, she used to see <b>a</b> <b>bevy</b> <b>of</b> eight girls of her age coming from an unknown place and escorting her in her chores during her childhood.|$|E
25|$|After {{consolidating}} {{his political}} position through military campaigns, diplomacy, and a firm domestic administration, Suryavarman launched into {{the construction of}} Angkor Wat as his personal temple mausoleum. Breaking with {{the tradition of the}} Khmer kings, and influenced perhaps by the concurrent rise of Vaisnavism in India, he dedicated the temple to Vishnu rather than to Siva. With walls nearly half a mile long on each side, Angkor Wat grandly portrays the Hindu cosmology, with the central towers representing Mount Meru, home of the gods; the outer walls, the mountains enclosing the world; and the moat, the oceans beyond. The traditional theme of identifying the Khmer devaraja with the gods, and his residence with that of the celestials, is very much in evidence. The measurements themselves of the temple and its parts in relation to one another have cosmological significance. Suryavarman had the walls of the temple decorated with bas reliefs depicting not only scenes from mythology, but also from the life of his own imperial court. In one of the scenes, the king himself is portrayed as larger in size than his subjects, sitting cross-legged on an elevated throne and holding court, while <b>a</b> <b>bevy</b> <b>of</b> attendants make him comfortable with the aid of parasols and fans.|$|E

If she {{put them on the}} lawn, no one would go into the parlour; if she put them into the parlour, no one would go into the tent. She thought of keeping the old people in the house and leaving the lawn to the lovers. She might as well have seated herself at once in a hornet's nest. Mr. Plomacy knew better than this. [...] "Bless your soul, ma'am," [...] said he, [...] "there won't be no old ladies--not one, barring {{yourself}} and old Mrs. Clantantram." ...|$|R
60|$|For {{the first}} time, Miss Keene noticed a slight irony in Senor Perkins' superabundant fluency, {{and that he}} did not conceal his preoccupation over the silent saluting gun he was still admiring. The {{approach}} of Don Miguel and Padre Esteban with <b>a</b> small <b>bevy</b> <b>of</b> ladies, however, quickly changed her thoughts, and detached the Senor from her side. Her first swift feminine impression of the fair strangers was that they were plain and dowdy, an impression fully shared by the other lady passengers. But her second observation, that they were more gentle, fascinating, child-like, and feminine than her own countrywomen, was purely her own. Their loose, undulating figures, guiltless of stays; their extravagance of short, white, heavily flounced skirt, which looked like a petticoat; their lightly wrapped, formless, and hooded shoulders and heads, lent a suggestion of dishabille that Mrs. Brimmer at once resented.|$|R
60|$|It was Lady Windermere's last {{reception}} before Easter, and Bentinck House {{was even}} more crowded than usual. Six Cabinet Ministers had come on from the Speaker's Levee in their stars and ribands, all the pretty women wore their smartest dresses, {{and at the end}} of the picture-gallery stood the Princess Sophia of Carlsruhe, a heavy Tartar-looking lady, with tiny black eyes and wonderful emeralds, talking bad French at the top of her voice, and laughing immoderately at everything that was said to her. It was certainly a wonderful medley of people. Gorgeous peeresses chatted affably to violent Radicals, popular preachers brushed coat-tails with eminent sceptics, <b>a</b> perfect <b>bevy</b> <b>of</b> bishops kept following a stout prima- donna from room to room, on the staircase stood several Royal Academicians, disguised as artists, and it was said that at one time the supper-room was absolutely crammed with geniuses. In fact, it was one of Lady Windermere's best nights, and the Princess stayed till nearly half-past eleven.|$|R
