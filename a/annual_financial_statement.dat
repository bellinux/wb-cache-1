2500|$|In 1892, {{the role}} of the Council was {{expanded}} by the Indian Councils Act of 1892. The Act increased the number of additional members of the Council to a maximum of 20, of whom not more than nine had to be officials. The Act introduced the method of election for the Council, but did not mention word [...] "election" [...] explicitly. The elected members were officially called as [...] "nominated" [...] members and their method of election was described as [...] "recommendation". Such [...] "recommendations" [...] were made by district boards, universities, municipalities and other associations. The term of the members was fixed at two years. The Council could also discuss the <b>annual</b> <b>financial</b> <b>statement</b> and ask questions subject to certain limitations. Thirty eight Indian members were [...] "nominated" [...] in the eight elections during 1893-1909 when this Act was in effect. C. Jambulingam Mudaliar, N. Subba Rao Pantulu, P. Kesava Pillai and C. Vijayaraghavachariar representing southern group of district boards, Kruthiventi Perraju Pantulu of the northern group of municipalities, C. Sankaran Nair and P. Rangaiah Naidu from the Corporation of Madras and P. S. Sivaswami Iyer, V. Krishnaswamy Iyer and M. Krishnan Nair from the University of Madras were some of the active members. However, over a period of time, representation by Indian members dwindled, for example, the position of Bashyam Iyengar and Sankaran Nayar in 1902 was occupied by Acworth and Sir George Moore. The council did not meet more than 9 days in a year during the time the Act was in effect.|$|E

40|$|Background: This study {{tests the}} value {{relevance}} of interim accounting information. The study also explores whether the value relevance of <b>annual</b> and interim <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> {{has changed over}} time. Aim: It explores whether the value relevance of interim <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> {{is higher than the}} value relevance of <b>annual</b> <b>financial</b> <b>statements.</b> Finally, it investigates whether accounting information published in interim and <b>annual</b> <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> has incremental value relevance. Setting: Data for the period from 1999 to 2012 were collected from a sample of non-financial companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange. Method: The Ohlson model to investigate the value relevance of accounting information was used for the study. Results: The results show that interim book value of equity is value relevant while interim earnings are not. Interim <b>financial</b> <b>statements</b> appear to have higher value relevance than <b>annual</b> <b>financial</b> <b>statements.</b> The value relevance of interim and annual accounting information has remained fairly constant over the sample period. Incremental comparisons provide evidence that additional book value of equity and earnings that accrue to a company between interim and annual reporting dates are value relevant. Conclusion: The study was conducted over a long sample period (1999 – 2012), in an era when a technology-driven economy and more timely reporting media could have had an effect on the value relevance of published accounting information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate and compare the value relevance of published interim and <b>annual</b> <b>financial</b> <b>statements...</b>|$|R
