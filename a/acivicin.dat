40|$|<b>Acivicin</b> is {{a potent}} {{inhibitor}} of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (EC 2. 3. 2. 2), an enzyme of importance in glutathione metabolism. <b>Acivicin</b> inhibition and binding are prevented by gamma-glutamyl substrates and analogs (e. g., serine plus borate), consistent with the previous postulate that <b>acivicin</b> and substrates bind to the same enzyme site. Inactivation of rat kidney transpeptidase by <b>acivicin</b> leads to its binding as an ester to Thr- 523. The pig enzyme, which has Ala- 523 in place of Thr- 523, is inhibited by <b>acivicin</b> with esterification at Ser- 405. The human enzyme has Thr- 524 (corresponding to Thr- 523 in rat); its inactivation leads to esterification of Ser- 406 (corresponding to Ser- 405 in rat and pig).

The findings indicate that there are significant structural differences between the active site region of the rat enzyme and the active site regions of the human and pig. Human mutant enzymes in which Thr- 524 and Ser- 406 were replaced by Ala, separately and together, are enzymatically active, indicating that these amino acid residues are not required for catalysis.

40|$|Abstract: Glutathione is {{abundant}} in the lining fluid that bathes the gas exchange surface of the lung. On the one hand glutathione in this extracellular pool functions in antioxidant defense to protect cells and proteins in the alveolar space from oxidant injury; on the other hand, it functions {{as a source of}} cysteine to maintain cellular glutathione and protein synthesis. These seemingly opposing functions are regulated through metabolism by gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT, EC 2. 3. 2. 2). Even under normal physiologic conditions, lung lining fluid (LLF) contains a concentrated pool of GGT activity exceeding that of whole lung by about 7 -fold and indicating increased turnover of glutathione at the epithelial surface of the lung. With oxidant stress LLF GGT activity is amplified even further as glutathione turnover is accelerated to meet the increased demands of cells for cysteine. Mouse models of GGT deficiency confirmed this biological role of LLF GGT activity and revealed the robust expansiveness and antioxidant capacity of the LLF glutathione pool in the absence of metabolism. <b>Acivicin,</b> an irreversible inhibitor of GGT, can be utilized to augment LLF fluid glutathione content in normal mice and novel GGT inhibitors have now been defined that provide advantages over <b>acivicin.</b> Inhibiting LLF GGT activity is a novel strategy to selectively augment the extracellular LLF glutathione pool.

Loss of LLF GGT activity in the mutant GGTenu 1 mouse causes an increase in baseline LLF glutathione content which is magnified in an IL- 13 model of allergic airway inflammation and protective against asthma. Normal mice are susceptible to asthma in this model but can be protected with <b>acivicin,</b> a GGT inhibitor. GGT is a target to treat asthma but <b>acivicin</b> toxicity limits clinical use. GGsTop is a novel GGT inhibitor. GGsTop inhibits LLF GGT activity only when delivered through the airway. In the IL- 13 model, mice treated with IL- 13 and GGsTop exhibit a lung inflammatory response similar to that of mice treated with IL- 13 alone. But mice treated with IL- 13 and GGsTop show attenuation of methacholine-stimulated airway hyper-reactivity, inhibition of Muc 5 ac and Muc 5 b gene induction, decreased airway epithelial cell mucous accumulation and a 4 -fold increase in LLF glutathione content compared to mice treated with IL- 13 alone. Mice treated with GGsTop alone are no different from that of mice treated with saline alone, and show no signs of toxicity. GGsTop could represent a valuable pharmacological tool to inhibit LLF GGT activity in pulmonary disease models. The associated increase in LLF glutathione can protect lung airway epithelial cells against oxidant injury associated with inflammation in asthma...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRecent {{studies have}} implicated {{a crucial role}} for tissue {{transglutaminase}} (TG 2) in the pathogenesis of Celiac Sprue, a disorder of the small intestine triggered in genetically susceptible individuals by dietary exposure to gluten. Proteolytically stable peptide inhibitors of human TG 2 were designed containing <b>acivicin</b> or alternatively 6 -diazo- 5 -oxo-norleucine (DON) as warheads. In biochemical and cell-based assays, {{the best of these}} inhibitors, Ac-PQP-(DON) -LPF-NH 2, was considerably more potent and selective than other TG 2 inhibitors reported to date. Selective pharmacological inhibition of extracellular TG 2 should be useful in exploring the mechanistic implications of TG 2 -catalyzed modification of dietary gluten, a phenomenon of considerable relevance in Celiac Sprue...|$|E

(2001). ?-Glutamyl transpeptidase and {{amino acid}} transport for milk protein production in vivo. Proceedings of the New Zealand Society of Animal Production, 61, 244 - 247 Dairy products are New Zealand's primary export commodity. The manufacturing efficiency for dairy products would be maximised if the Dairy Industry {{had the ability}} to control milk protein production to suit the manufacture of specific products. Understanding the role of amino acid transport in regulating milk protein synthesis may allow manipulation of proteins in milk. γ-Glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GT), an enzyme thought to {{play a key role in}} mediating amino acid transport, has been demonstrated in mammary tissue, but the role of this enzyme and its associated biochemical pathway, the γ-glutamyl cycle, has not been fully elucidated. The γ-glutamyl cycle consists of synthetic and degradative enzymes for the cysteine-containing tripeptide glutathione. γ-GT transfers the γ-glutamyl moiety from glutathione to amino acids, and has a high affinity for cyst(e) ine. The vascular supply of cysteine is thought to be insufficient to maintain milk protein synthesis. In this study, the role of the γ-glutamyl cycle in amino acid transport for milk protein synthesis was investigated using two systems, firstly, in acini isolated from the udder of lactating sheep, and secondly in lactating goats. Milk protein secretion from isolated acini significantly decreased (70 %) as a result of γ-GT inhibition with <b>acivicin,</b> and significantly increased (250 %) when supplied with cysteine as N-acetylcysteine (NAC). In lactating goats, <b>acivicin</b> did not affect milk yield or total protein concentration or yield, but significantly increased αs 2 - and κ-casein concentration in milk. This may have resulted from increased uptake of some amino acids by the mammary gland and suggests that γ-GT negatively regulates uptake of some amino acids for milk protein synthesis. NAC significantly increased milk yield, protein concentration and protein yield as a result of increased uptake of some amino acids, which may have been due to increased mammary blood flow. This increase was prevented by <b>acivicin,</b> however, suggesting that γ-GT plays an important role in amino acid supply. Inhibition of γ-GT may up-regulate sub-saturated transport systems leading to increased uptake of amino acids required for milk protein synthesis. Further testing of NAC and a greater understanding of the function and regulation of γ-GT may allow increased, and targeted, milk protein production as required by the Dairy Industry...|$|E
40|$|Contribution of γ glutamyl {{transpeptidase}} to oxidative damage of ischemic rat kidney. BackgroundA variety of mechanisms {{have been considered}} in the pathogenesis of the cell damage occurring in the kidney that is undergoing transient ischemia. However, little information is available {{about the role of}} oxidative stress in building up the tissue injury in the hypoxic organ during short-term ischemia. MethodsAfter a standard brief period (25 min) of unilateral kidney ischemia in rats, pretreated or not with <b>acivicin</b> (60 μmol/L/kg i. v.), tissue samples from both ischemic and not ischemic kidneys were obtained to measure malondialdehyde (MDA) and glutathione (GSH) content, γ {{glutamyl transpeptidase}} (GGT) activity by spectrophotometry, localization and intensity of enzyme activity, and tissue damage by histochemistry. ResultsGGT activity was found to be increased in both cortical and medullar zones of the ischemic kidneys, where the GSH level was only slightly decreased and the MDA level, in contrast, was markedly increased; in parallel, the cytosolic volume of the proximal tubular (PT) cells showed a significant increment. The animal pretreatment with <b>acivicin,</b> a specific inhibitor of GGT, besides preventing the up-regulation of the enzyme during ischemia, afforded good protection against the observed changes of MDA and GSH tissue levels, as well as of tubular cell volume. ConclusionsEx vivo data supporting a net pro-oxidant effect of up-regulated GGT during short-term ischemia of rat kidney have been obtained. The enzyme stimulation appears to contribute to the renal morphological damage exerted by a brief hypoxic condition at the level of PT cells. The actual impact on kidney function by GGT-dependent oxidative damage during transient ischemia and the potential protective action of GGT inhibitors require subsequent investigation...|$|E
40|$|Putrescine uptake in type II pneumocytes is a carrier-mediated active process. Our {{hypothesis}} was that oligoamines {{might be taken}} up into the cell {{at least in part}} by gamma-glutamyltransferase (gamma-GT). This was investigated in rat type II pneumocytes 24 hr after their isolation. Preexposure to 125 microM L-buthionine-[SR]-sulfoximine (BSO) or 100 microM diethylmaleate (DEM), both of which affect intracellular glutathione (GSH) only, were found to decrease GSH by 85 % (p < 0. 05) and 62 %, respectively (p < 0. 05), without change in [3 H]-putrescine uptake. Preexposure to 20 microM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), which affects intra- and extracellular GSH, decreased intracellular GSH by 79 % (p = 0. 015) and putrescine uptake by 39 % (p = 0. 03). Selective extracellular GSH depletion by 10 microM copper-o-phenanthroline complex (CuP) led to a decrease in putrescine uptake of 41 % (p = 0. 001), while intracellular GSH remained unchanged. Specific inhibition of gamma-GT by 5 - 20 mM serine-borate or 5 mM <b>acivicin</b> gave similar degrees of putrescine uptake inhibition (39. 5 % and 40. 5 %). The kinetic properties of the putrescine uptake system in the presence of <b>acivicin</b> and serine-borate indicated that the Vmax decreased by 25 %, while Km remained unchanged. In experiments with pure gamma-GT, the oligoamines putrescine, spermidine and spermine, and cystamine proved to be acceptor substrates for gamma-GT, all having similar efficiencies (Vmax/Km); methylglyoxal-bis-(guanyl-hydrazone) and paraquat were not accepted. As extracellular GSH is required for gamma-GT, and because its extracellular depletion inhibits putrescine uptake as much as specific inhibition of gamma-GT, we suggest that 30 - 40 % of the putrescine uptake in type II pneumocytes occurs by gamma-GT and that, therefore, at least two systems are involved in the uptake of putrescine. status: publishe...|$|E
