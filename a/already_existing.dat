5|$|I {{had it in}} my head {{to write}} an epic of it, but though I still hanker after it, I see clearly it would be foolish, for no verse could render {{the best parts of}} it, and it would only be a flatter and tamer version of a thing <b>already</b> <b>existing.</b>|$|E
5|$|More recent {{projects}} use {{tunnel boring}} machines, which increase the cost. They minimize disruption at street level and avoid <b>already</b> <b>existing</b> utilities. Examples of such projects include {{the extension of}} the IRT Flushing Line and the IND Second Avenue Line.|$|E
5|$|US-412 was {{extended}} into Oklahoma in 1988 to encourage recreational travel {{and the resulting}} economic benefit to the state. This extension, in which the new designation replaced or overlapped several <b>already</b> <b>existing</b> highways, brought US-412's western terminus to Woodward. In 1993, it {{was extended}} west of Oklahoma, bringing it through the Panhandle and into New Mexico.|$|E

While there is constitutional right to self-defense, its practical utilization without any weapon is only illusory.|$|E
5|$|Following Erica's heavy rains, it was {{feared that}} the <b>already</b> <b>existing</b> dengue fever {{epidemic}} would become more widespread. Prior to Erica, there were already 437 cases of dengue fever in 2003 alone. The risk for leptospirosis was also increased by Erica. High winds and strong rains resulted in damages of at least US$15 million, particularly to schools. Two fatalities total were reported {{as a result of}} Erica. The name Erica was retired after the season.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Neighbours {{suffered}} a significant decline in ratings and plans {{were made to}} take the series into a 'back to basics' approach where storylines would become less controversial {{and return to the}} focus on relationships and family dynamics. It was at this point that the character of Declan was created and actress Jane Hall would play his on-screen mother Rebecca Napier. The characters were to create a family unit for then, <b>already</b> <b>existing</b> character Oliver Barnes (David Hoflin).|$|E

5|$|In 2010 fingolimod, a sphingosine-1-phosphate {{receptor}} modulator, {{became the}} first oral drug approved by the FDA, being followed in 2012 by teriflunomide, a drug that inhibits the synthesis of pyrimidine and disrupts the interaction of T cells with antigen presenting cell. Fingolimod and teriflunomide are taken through a daily single dose. In 2013 one further oral drug, dimethyl fumarate -or BG12- (which is an improved version of fumaric acid, an <b>already</b> <b>existing</b> drug), {{was approved by the}} FDA. Dimethyl fumarate is taken twice daily.|$|E
5|$|In 326, Constantine {{reversed}} this pro-equestrian trend, raising many {{administrative positions}} to senatorial rank and thus opening these offices {{to the old}} aristocracy, {{and at the same}} time elevating the rank of <b>already</b> <b>existing</b> equestrian office-holders to senator, degrading the equestrian order —at least as a bureaucratic rank —in the process, so that by the end of the 4th century the title of perfectissimus was granted only to mid-low officials.|$|E
5|$|In November 2014, {{rap group}} Migos and Glo Gang member, Capo, were {{involved}} in a physical altercation in a Chicago restaurant. Later, Keef uploaded an image onto Instagram featuring the alleged stolen chain belonging to rapper Quavo of Migos. Though this incident escalated the <b>already</b> <b>existing</b> tension between members of Glo Gang and members of Migos, the feud between the two groups was later seemingly ended.|$|E

5|$|The Jesuits, {{the first}} evangelizers of the Baclayon, planted the first seed of Christianity in Bohol upon {{the request of}} Doña Catalina de Bolaños, mother of the encomendero of Bohol island, Pedro de Gamboa to Father Antonio Sedeno, mission {{superior}} of Leyte and Samar. In November 17, 1596, the first Jesuits, Father Juan de Torres, SJ and Father Gabriel Sánchez, SJ , came to Baclayon.

5|$|The Wilderness Act {{enhanced}} the protection status of remote or undeveloped land already contained within federally administered protected areas. Passage {{of the act}} ensured that no human improvements would take place aside from those <b>already</b> <b>existing.</b> The protected status in wilderness-designated zones prohibits road and building construction, oil and mineral exploration or mining, and logging, and also prohibits the use of motorized equipment and bicycles. The ways people may enter wilderness areas are on foot or on horseback.|$|E
5|$|While ReactOS has the aim {{to build}} a Windows-compatible kernel as {{open-source}} software, much of the surrounding required functionality to create a complete OS is already available in the greater open-source ecosystem. When available and possible, ReactOS therefore builds on and collaborates with <b>already</b> <b>existing</b> open-source projects. Conversely, projects like Wine, former Captive NTFS, and Longene re-use the open-source ReactOS code-base as well.|$|E

5|$|During the Fourth Aliyah (1924–1928), the Jezreel Valley {{was the top}} {{priority}} of the Jewish National Fund (JNF). The JNF wanted to settle the valley {{in order to establish}} a significant Jewish agricultural community in the arable valley, and to create a contiguous bloc of Jewish settlements in the valley, connecting Haifa with the <b>already</b> <b>existing</b> bloc of Jewish settlements between Afula and Beit She'an. In 1924 the JNF bought some 30,175 dunams of land from Arab villages next to Nahalal {{in the western part of}} the valley. On this land, Sarid, Ramat David, Gvat, Kfar Baruch and Mishmar HaEmek were established.|$|E
5|$|During the Terminal Classic, El Chal {{maintained}} its primary {{place in the}} San Juan valley. This is evidenced by major building activity in the site core where the massive structures were underwent new phases of construction and by the erection of new monuments to accompany the <b>already</b> <b>existing</b> Late Classic monuments. The continued importance of El Chal in the Terminal Classic resulted in other centres in the region being eclipsed, such as El Edén and El Tigrillo {{to the west and}} Copoja, La Puente and El Ocote to the southeast. During the Terminal Classic, El Chal developed its own ceramic production industry.|$|E
5|$|Electric power {{generated}} from wind {{power can be}} highly variable at several different timescales: hourly, daily, or seasonally. Annual variation also exists, but is not as significant. Because instantaneous electrical generation and consumption must remain in balance to maintain grid stability, this variability can present substantial challenges to incorporating large amounts of wind power into a grid system. Intermittency and the non-dispatchable nature of wind energy production can raise costs for regulation, incremental operating reserve, and (at high penetration levels) could require {{an increase in the}} <b>already</b> <b>existing</b> energy demand management, load shedding, storage solutions or system interconnection with HVDC cables. The variability of wind is quite different from solar, wind may be producing power at night when other baseload plants are often overproducing.|$|E

5|$|NY73 was {{truncated}} to {{its current}} eastern terminus in Underwood , eliminating a lengthy overlap with US9, while its former routing from Schroon to Lake Champlain was renumbered to NY74, matching the other Vermont route number that ends in Larrabees Point. The <b>already</b> <b>existing</b> NY74 in Chautauqua County (in the Jamestown area) was renumbered to NY474 as a result. The opening of the Adirondack Northway in 1967 also resulted in a slight shift of the western terminus of NY74 from US9 to I-87. By 1981, NY74 was rerouted to follow its current alignment around the northeastern edge of Ticonderoga, on a concurrency with NY22. The highway has remained the same since that date.|$|E
5|$|On 1 February 1793, the French Republic {{declared}} war on Great Britain and the Dutch Republic, extending the <b>already</b> <b>existing</b> French Revolutionary Wars. It took several months for news of the outbreak of war to reach British India, messages arriving at Calcutta from Consul George Baldwin at Alexandria on 11 June. The Royal Navy commander in the region, Commodore William Cornwallis, immediately set about demanding the surrender of the French trading posts in India. Most fell within a few days, but the major port of Pondicherry refused, and was besieged from 1 August. The siege lasted {{a month before the}} French commander capitulated under bombardment from British land and naval forces. With the French presence eliminated from India, Cornwallis was ordered to return to Europe, leaving minimal naval forces in the Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|On 6 June 1930, Carol {{arrived in}} Bucharest {{and made his}} way into Parliament, where the Act of Succession 1927 was duly {{declared}} null. Thus, Carol usurped the throne from his son, becoming King Carol II. Upon hearing of Carol's return, Marie, who was abroad, was relieved. She had been growing anxious with the direction in which the country was heading and viewed Carol's return as the return of the Prodigal Son. However, as soon as she arrived in Bucharest, she became aware that things would not go well. Carol refused to accept his mother's advice to take Helen back and never sought Marie's counsel during his reign, thus making the <b>already</b> <b>existing</b> breach between mother and son complete.|$|E
