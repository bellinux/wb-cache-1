5|$|Churchill {{has been}} active since at least 1984 as the co-director of the Denver-based American Indian Movement of Colorado, now an {{autonomous}} chapter of the American Indian Movement. In 1993, he and other local <b>AIM</b> leaders, including Russell Means, Glenn T. Morris, Robert Robideau, and David Hill, broke with the national <b>AIM</b> leadership, including Dennis Banks and the brothers Vernon and Clyde Bellecourt, claiming that all <b>AIM</b> chapters are autonomous. The <b>AIM</b> Grand Governing Council is based in Minneapolis and retains {{the name of the}} national group. It says that the schism arose when Means, Churchill, Glenn T. Morris and others openly supported the Miskito Indian group Misurasata, who were allied with the anti-revolutionary, CIA-backed Contras.|$|E

40|$|Recently we have {{demonstrated}} that anthocyanins from fruits of Vitis coignetiae Pulliat (<b>AIMs)</b> have anticancer effects. Here, we investigate the effects of <b>AIMs</b> on cell proliferation and invasion as well as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) which {{have been linked to}} cancer metastasis in human uterine cervical cancer HeLa cells. <b>AIMs</b> inhibited the invasion of HeLa cells in a dose-dependent manner. <b>AIMs</b> inhibited MMP- 9 expression in a dose-dependent manner. <b>AIMs</b> inhibited the motility of HeLa cells in a wound healing test. <b>AIMs</b> still suppressed NF-κB activation induced by TNF. <b>AIMs</b> also inhibited EMT in HeLa cells. <b>AIMs</b> suppressed vimentin, N-cadherin, and β-catenin expression and induced E-cadherin. <b>AIMs</b> also suppressed expression of β-catenin and Snail, which was regulated by GSK- 3. These effects of <b>AIMs</b> were also limited in the HeLa cells treated with TNF. In conclusion, this study indicates that <b>AIMs</b> have anticancer effects by suppressing NF-κB-regulated genes and EMT, which relates to suppression of IκBα phosphorylation and GSK- 3 activity, respectively. However, the effects of <b>AIMs</b> were attenuated in the TNF-high condition...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} based on {{research}} conducted in Australia and the United States into Australian <b>aims</b> toward the Allied Occupation of Japan under the Chifley government between 1945 and 1949. It challenges the prevailing characterisation of Australian <b>aims</b> as solely seeking a ‘harsh peace’ with Japan. An alternative, two-platform model is proposed to assess Australian <b>aims.</b> The model incorporates the pragmatic and retribution aspects of Australian policy (known as platform-one <b>aims)</b> and the more complex pragmatic and idealist <b>aims</b> of encouraging democratisation in postwar Japan (known as platform-two <b>aims).</b> The paper focuses on platform-two <b>aims,</b> as these tend to be neglected in historiography on the Australian role in the Occupation...|$|R

We analyzed 200 pornographic images randomly selected from 4 websites (2 <b>aimed</b> at women and 2 <b>aimed</b> at men). The criteria for comparison were based on concepts of sexual inequality and sexual objectification that have been commonly used in the literature on analyses of pornography content.

5|$|Despite the pursued <b>aim</b> of pan-Germanic unification, {{the primary}} goal of the German Reich’s {{territorial}} expansionism was to acquire sufficient Lebensraum (living space) in Eastern Europe for the Germanic übermenschen or superior men. The primary objective of this <b>aim</b> was to transform Germany into a complete economic autarky, the end-result of which would be a state of continent-wide German hegemony over Europe. This was to be accomplished through the enlargement of the territorial base of the German state and the expansion of the German population, and the wholesale extermination of the indigenous Slavic inhabitants and the Germanisation of Baltic inhabitants.|$|E

We outline two plausible strategies to identify and justify education’s ultimate <b>aims.</b> The first associates these <b>aims</b> with a normative standpoint, such as the moral, prudential, or aesthetic, which is overriding, in a sense of ‘overriding’ to be explained. The second associates education’s ultimate <b>aims</b> with the intrinsic value of personal well-being. We advance reasons to doubt that these strategies are successful. The shortcomings of these strategies impute yet further urgency to the issue of how we are to ascertain and validate education’s ultimate <b>aims.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
