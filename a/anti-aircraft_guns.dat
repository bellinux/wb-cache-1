5|$|Dubrovnik was {{completed}} at the Yarrow shipyards in Glasgow in 1932, {{by which time}} her main guns and light <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>guns</b> had been installed. After sailing to the Bay of Kotor in the southern Adriatic, she was fitted with her heavy <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>guns.</b> She was commissioned with the Royal Yugoslav Navy in May 1932. Her captain was Armin Pavić.|$|E
5|$|Overall, Japanese fighters {{shot down}} 74 B-29s, <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>guns</b> {{accounted}} for a further 54, and 19 were downed {{by a combination of}} <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>guns</b> and fighters. IJAAF and IJN losses during the defense of Japan were 1,450 aircraft in combat and another 2,750 to other causes.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, several 14-pounder and 9-pounder <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>guns</b> were added, {{with the}} older 9-pounder guns being removed to keep {{displacement}} down. In 1930, she was modified to carry a reconnaissance seaplane.|$|E
50|$|The 13 pounder 9 cwt <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>gun</b> {{became the}} {{standard}} mobile British <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>gun</b> of the World War I era, especially in theatres outside Britain.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Anti-aircraft</b> machine <b>guns</b> {{have long}} been mounted on trucks, and these were quite common during World War I. A {{predecessor}} of the WWII German [...] "88" [...] <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>gun,</b> the WWI German 77 mm <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>gun,</b> was truck-mounted and used to great effect against British tanks.|$|R
5000|$|The Flakpanzer IV [...] "Wirbelwind" [...] (Whirlwind in English) was a German {{self-propelled}} <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>gun</b> {{based on}} the Panzer IV tank. It was developed in 1944 as a successor to the earlier Möbelwagen self-propelled <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>gun.</b>|$|R

5|$|Melbourne {{carried a}} {{defensive}} armament of <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>guns</b> and an air group comprising both attack and anti-submarine aircraft. As {{the ship was}} never directly involved in a conflict, her weapons and embarked aircraft did not fire a shot in anger.|$|E
5|$|Satsuma {{rejoined the}} 1st Battleship Squadron in 1915, was {{refitted}} at Sasebo Naval Arsenal in 1916 {{and served with}} the 1st Squadron {{for the rest of}} the war. Sometime during the war, she was fitted with two 12-pounders on high-angle mounts to serve as <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>guns.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Bofors 57 mm m/54 was a wheeled {{automatic}} <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>gun</b> {{for land}} based use produced by Bofors and {{developed from the}} similar Bofors Model 1950 57 mm shipboard <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>gun.</b> The gun {{was developed in the}} 1950s and fielded by the Belgian and Swedish forces. In Swedish service, the gun was known as the 57 mm lvakan m/54.|$|R

5|$|Since it {{soon became}} obvious that the Japanese force had no air cover, the U.S. {{aircraft}} were able to set up for their attacks without fear of opposition from Japanese aircraft. U.S. bomber and torpedo aircraft arriving over the Yamato group—after their two-hour flight from Okinawa—were thus able to circle the Japanese ship formation just out of anti-aircraft range in order to methodically set up their attacks on the warships below. The first wave of U.S. carrier planes were spotted by a Japanese lookout on the bridge at 12:32. Two minutes later, Yamato opened fire with her 460mm main batteries. The Japanese ships stopped zigzagging and increased speed to , beginning evasive maneuvers, and opened fire with their <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>guns.</b> Yamato carried almost 150 <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>guns,</b> including her massive 460mm guns.|$|E
5|$|The Condor Legion {{claimed to}} have {{destroyed}} 320 Republican aircraft through aerial combat and shot down another 52 using <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>guns.</b> They also {{claimed to have}} destroyed 60 ships. They lost 72 aircraft due to hostile action, and another 160 to accidents.|$|E
5|$|The brigade was {{equipped}} with 43 <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>guns</b> ranging in calibre from 20 to 40mm. These guns had a dual role as both anti-aircraft and coastal defence weapons. Many were in concrete emplacements {{on top of the}} submarine pens and other dockside installations of the St Nazaire submarine base.|$|E

5|$|The forces {{allocated}} to the defence of Singapore were not strong. In early 1945, Japanese air defences for the island included only two Army companies equipped with automatic cannon, some IJN anti-aircraft units, and {{a small number of}} fighter aircraft. Some of the <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>guns</b> were crewed by Malay auxiliaries. The effectiveness of what was already an inadequate air defence force was hindered by a lack of coordination between the Army and Navy, shortages of fire control equipment for the guns, and no fire-control radar or barrage balloons being available. Defence against night raids was particularly weak as no night fighters were stationed near Singapore and coordination between the <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>guns</b> and searchlight units was poor.|$|E
5|$|The main {{guns were}} {{controlled}} by an Admiralty Fire Control Clock Mk I that used data {{derived from the}} director and the rangefinder. They had no capability for anti-aircraft fire and the <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>guns</b> were aimed solely by eye.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1915, {{the main}} deck 6-inch guns of the Monmouth-class ships {{were moved to}} the upper deck and given gun shields; their casemates were plated over to improve the ships' seakeeping. The 12-pounder guns {{displaced}} by the transfer were repositioned elsewhere. At {{some point in the}} war, three 3-pounder <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>guns</b> were installed on the upper deck.|$|E

50|$|The Type 11 75 mm <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>gun</b> (Jyūichinen-shiki nana-senti-han Yasen Koshahō) was an <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>gun</b> {{used by the}} Imperial Japanese Army after World War I. The Type 11 {{designation}} {{was given}} to this gun as it was accepted in the 11th year of Emperor Taishō's reign (1922). It was the first <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>gun</b> in Japanese service, but {{only a small number}} were produced, and it was superseded by the Type 14 10 cm gun and the Type 88 75 mm gun in active service before the start of World War II.|$|R
5|$|Bénouville was the {{farthest}} forward {{point of the}} British advance on 6 June 1944. On 9 June, the German Air Force attacked the bridges with 13 aircraft. The British had positioned light and medium-sized <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>guns</b> around the bridges and {{in the face of}} intense anti-aircraft fire the attack failed, although they did claim one of the bridges was destroyed by a direct hit.|$|E
5|$|Her {{tenure in}} Pola was enlivened by {{a visit from}} the new Emperor Karl I on 15 December 1916 and another by Kaiser Wilhelm on 12 December 1917 during his {{inspection}} of the German submarine base there. The Italians conducted no fewer than eighty air raids on Pola between 1915 and 1917 which undoubtedly kept the crews of her <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>guns</b> busy.|$|E
5|$|In early 1945, {{while under}} repair for combat damage, Mississippi {{received}} a new secondary battery. The old 51-caliber 5-inch guns were removed, and eight {{more of the}} 25-caliber <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>guns</b> were installed, along with thirteen quadruple Bofors 40 mm mounts and forty 20 mm Oerlikon guns. To compensate for the added weight, the ship's armored conning tower was removed.|$|E

5|$|O'Brien {{was also}} {{equipped}} with four twin 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes. The General Board of the United States Navy {{had called for}} two <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>guns</b> for the O'Brien-class ships, as well as provisions for laying up to 36 floating mines.

5|$|Overall, {{more than}} 80 Japanese {{aircraft}} were dispatched against Saipan and Tinian between November 1944 {{and the end}} of the offensive in February 1945. The Japanese destroyed 11 B-29s, caused major damage to eight and minor damage to another 35. American casualties were 45 dead and over 200 wounded. USAAF fighters and <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>guns</b> shot down about 37 Japanese aircraft during these raids.|$|E
5|$|The Belgians began {{mobilisation}} on 25 August 1939 and by May 1940 {{mounted a}} field army of 18 infantry divisions, two divisions of partly motorised Chasseurs Ardennais and two motorised cavalry divisions, a force totaling some 600,000 men.
