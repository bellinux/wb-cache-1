40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for {{determining}} a development of the rotation surface, which is the rotation of hypocycloids with 4 branches. It has been chosen a four-cusped hypocycloid called astroid, because, due to its aesthetic shape, this {{could be used in}} industrial design. This paper proposes getting the development for a rotation surface generated by astroid. It is applied the graphical method of descriptive geometry by analogy with the developed by the sphere. This <b>approximate</b> <b>graphical</b> <b>method</b> is applied relatively simple and can be used when a high precision is not required for the product. ...|$|E
40|$|The McCabe-Thiele {{method is}} a {{classical}} <b>approximate</b> <b>graphical</b> <b>method</b> for the conceptual design of binary distillation columns {{which is still}} widely used, mainly for didactical purposes, though it is also valuable for quick preliminary calculations. Nevertheless, no complete description of the method has been found and situations such as different thermal feed conditions, multiple feeds, possibilities to extract by-products or to add or remove heat, are not always considered. In the present work we provide a systematic analysis of such situations by developing the generalized equations for: a) the operating lines (OL) of each sector, and b) the changeover line that provides the connection between two consecutive trays of the corresponding sectors separated by a lateral stream of feed, product, or a heat removal or addition.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{focuses on}} the {{generalized}} Maxwell model (GMM) identification. The formulation of the transfer function of the GMM is defined, {{as well as its}} asymptotes. To compare identification methods of the parameters of the GMM, a test transfer function and two quality indicators are defined. Then, three <b>graphical</b> <b>methods</b> are described, the enclosing curve method, the CRONE method and an original one. But the results of <b>graphical</b> <b>methods</b> are not good enough. Thus, two optimization recursive processes are described to improve the results of <b>graphical</b> <b>methods.</b> The first one is based on an unconstrained non-linear optimization algorithm and the second one is original and allows constraining identified parameters. This new process uses the asymptotes of the modulus and the phase of the transfer function of the GMM.

40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose. For simple {{pharmacokinetic}} compartmental models, analytical {{solution to}} the governing differential equations along with common <b>graphical</b> <b>methods</b> provide a mean to evaluate the associated rate constants. These <b>graphical</b> <b>methods,</b> however, {{can not be used}} for the more complex multi-compartment models. Furthermore, parameter estimation using slope and intercept values from the <b>graphical</b> <b>methods</b> is often accompanied with error. In this study a numerical solution is applied for the solution of the governing differential equations and a simple direct search optimization procedure utilizing random numbers is used for pharmacokinetic parameter estimation. Method. The methodology is demonstrated with reference to experimental literature data for ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin whose pharmacokinetic behavior has been reported in terms of a two-compartment model. Results. Examination of the predicted drug concentrations from the <b>graphical</b> <b>method</b> and the optimization methodology indicate that both methods have comparable accuracy in predicting the drug concentrations. The <b>graphical</b> <b>method,</b> however, only shows good accuracy in the early stages both after i. v. and oral drug administration whereas the optimization procedure, {{due to the nature of}} the objective function formulation, provides good accuracy over the entire range of times after drug administration.
