25|$|Brundage {{produced}} {{works for}} Raphael Tuck & Sons {{with an emphasis}} on attractive and endearing Victorian children. At the same time she was also published by Wolff Hagelberg, Berlin, in near equal amount, except no book illustration and quite different subject and style. Maud Humphrey was the preferred artist with American publishers in the 1890s, but Brundage was chosen by Tuck, London, and Hagelberg, Berlin, international art publishers, for their American market publication. As a result, Brundage had extensive early Euro and UK international postcard publication, more than any other children artist except Ellen Clapsaddle and Harriett M. Bennett, as well as with Tuck's and Hagelberg's large lines of U.S. postcards. Those postcards and the Tuck and the Hagelberg lines of fancy diecut valentines made Brundage the largest presence in U.S. <b>art</b> <b>paper</b> 1899-1910. By 1910, she was working for New York publisher, Samuel Gabriel Company (S. Gabriel had been manager of Tuck's U.S. publishing operations and was responsible for Tuck's use of Brundage for book illustration and postcards), and later, Akron, Ohio publisher, Saalfield. She also did illustrated books for Stecher Lithographic Company, DeWolfe, Fiske & Company, Fred A. Stokes, Charles E. Graham & Company, and E.P. Dutton & Ernest Nister—and work for Hayes & Koerner. later Hayes Co.. During her late 60s, she produced as many as 20 books per year (exaggeration!). Brundage died on March 28, 1937, aged 82 years.|$|E
500|$|When Roberts & Vinter {{made the}} {{decision}} to close down New Worlds in 1963, Moorcock and Ballard considered publishing a new magazine that would be willing, as Carnell had been, to publish experimental material. [...] Moorcock assembled a dummy issue, and later described his intentions: [...] "It would be on <b>art</b> <b>paper,</b> to take good quality illustrations; it would be the size of, say, Playboy so that it would get good display space on the newsstands; it would specialise in experimental work by writers like [...] Burroughs and [...] Paolozzi, but it would be 'popular', it would seek to publicise such experimenters; it would publish all those writers who had become demoralised by a lack of sympathetic publishers and by baffled critics; it would attempt a cross-fertilization of popular sf, science and the work of the literary and artistic avant garde." [...] Moorcock also wrote a letter to Carnell setting out his thoughts on what science fiction needed: [...] "Editors who are willing to take a risk on a story and run it even though this may bring criticism on their heads." [...] The letter was published in the final Nova Publications issue, which also carried the announcement that Moorcock would be taking over from Carnell as editor of New Worlds, though Moorcock had been unaware he would be considered for the post when he wrote his letter.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} fine <b>art</b> inkjet <b>papers</b> {{meet the needs}} of {{professional}} photographers and artists. These papers share many characteristics with traditional watercolor, printmaking, and photographic <b>papers.</b> Fine <b>art</b> inkjet <b>papers</b> are designed to meet similar standards for longevity as traditional fine art papers: they should have a neutral pH, be lignin-free, and not include optical brighteners. Fine <b>art</b> inkjet <b>papers</b> differ from traditional fine <b>art</b> <b>papers,</b> in that they include coatings engineered to receive and hold ink. Fine <b>art</b> <b>papers</b> are usually made of rag pulp (100% cotton being the most common) but may also be have an alpha-cellulose base. Some descriptions and comparisons of fine <b>art</b> inkjet <b>papers</b> are here, here, here, and here. Some fine <b>art</b> <b>papers</b> are mold made, while others are machine made, and may vary considerably in surface texture. Many fine <b>art</b> <b>papers</b> are available in pre-cut sheets or in rolls.|$|R

2500|$|Lithography {{originally}} used {{an image}} drawn with oil, fat, or wax {{onto the surface}} of a smooth, level lithographic limestone plate. The stone was treated with a mixture of acid and gum arabic, [...] "etching" [...] the grease content of the drawing material into the pores of the stone and chemically creating grease reservoirs. The open stone (without drawing) was affected by the gum arabic creating a thin gum layer that would then attract water. When the stone was subsequently moistened, these gummed areas retained water; an oil-based ink could then be applied with a roller sticking only to the original drawing. The ink would finally be transferred to a cotton fine <b>art</b> <b>paper</b> sheet, producing a printed page. This traditional technique is still used as a fine art medium today.|$|E
6000|$|But {{those who}} had no cause to heed Diana's shot or coldness might admire her beauty; nor could the famous Parisian marble, which Clive said she resembled, be more perfect in form than this young lady. Her hair and eyebrows were jet black (these latter {{may have been too}} thick {{according}} to some physiognomists, giving rather a stern expression to the eyes, and hence causing those guilty ones to tremble who came under her lash), but her complexion was as dazzlingly fair and her cheeks as red as Miss Rosey's own, who had a right to those beauties, being a blonde by nature. In Miss Ethel's black hair there was a slight natural ripple, as when a fresh breeze blows over the melan hudor--a ripple such as Roman ladies nineteen hundred years ago, and our own beauties a short time since, endeavoured to imitate by <b>art,</b> <b>paper,</b> and I believe crumpling-irons. Her eyes were grey; her mouth rather large; her teeth as regular and bright as Lady Kew's own; her voice low and sweet; and her smile, when it lighted up her face and eyes, as beautiful as spring sunshine; also they could lighten and flash often, and sometimes, though rarely, rain. As for her figure--but as this tall slender form is concealed in a simple white muslin robe (of the sort which I believe is called demi-toilette), in which her fair arms are enveloped, and which is confined at her slim waist by an azure ribbon, and descends to her feet--let us make a respectful bow to that fair image of Youth, Health, and Modesty, and fancy it as pretty as we will. Miss Ethel made a very stately curtsey to Mrs. Mackenzie, surveying that widow calmly, so that the elder lady looked up and fluttered; but towards Rosey she held out her hand, and smiled with the utmost kindness, and the smile was returned by the other; and the blushes with which Miss Mackenzie was always ready at this time, became her very much. As for Mrs. Mackenzie--the very largest curve that shall not be a caricature, and actually disfigure the widow's countenance--a smile so wide and steady, so exceedingly rident, indeed, as almost to be ridiculous, may be drawn upon her buxom face, if the artist chooses to attempt it as it appeared during the whole of this summer evening, before dinner came (when people ordinarily look very grave), when she was introduced to the company: when she was made known to our friends Julia and Maria,--the darling child, lovely little dears! how like their papa and mamma!--when Sir Brian Newcome gave her his arm downstairs to the dining-room when anybody spoke to her: when John offered her meat, or the gentleman in the white waistcoat, wine; when she accepted or when she refused these refreshments; when Mr. Newcome told her a dreadfully stupid story; when the Colonel called cheerily from his end of the table, [...] "My dear Mrs. Mackenzie, you don't take any wine to-day; may I not have the honour of drinking a glass of champagne with you?" [...] when the new boy from the country upset some sauce upon her shoulder: when Mrs. Newcome made the sign for departure; and I have no doubt in the drawing-room, when the ladies retired thither. [...] "Mrs. Mack is perfectly awful," [...] Clive told me afterwards, [...] "since that dinner in Bryanstone Square. Lady Kew and Lady Anne are never out of her mouth; she has had white muslin dresses made just like Ethel's for herself and her daughter. She has bought a Peerage, and knows the pedigree of the whole Kew family. She won't go out in a cab now without the boy on the box; and in the plate for the cards which she has established in the drawing-room, you know, Lady Kew's pasteboard always will come up to the top, though I poke it down whenever I go into the room. As for poor Lady Trotter, the governess of St. Kitt's, you know, and the Bishop of Tobago, they are quite bowled out: Mrs. Mack has not mentioned them for a week." ...|$|E
