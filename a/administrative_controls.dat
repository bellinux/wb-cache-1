5|$|Risk {{management}} is {{obtained by the}} usual measures of engineering controls, <b>administrative</b> <b>controls</b> and procedures, and personal protective equipment, including hazard identification and risk assessment (HIRA), protective equipment, medical screening, training and standardised procedures. Professional divers are generally legally obliged to carry out and formally record these measures, and though recreational divers are not legally required to do many of them, competent recreational divers, and particularly technical divers, generally perform them informally but routinely, and they {{are an important part}} of technical diver training. For example, a medical statement or examination for fitness, pre-dive site assessment and briefing, safety drills, thermal protection, equipment redundancy, alternative air source, buddy checks, buddy or team diving procedures, dive planning, underwater hand signals, and carrying first aid and oxygen administration equipment are all routinely part of technical diving.|$|E

25|$|<b>Administrative</b> <b>controls</b> (also called chibai) {{consist of}} {{approved}} written policies, procedures, standards and guidelines. <b>Administrative</b> <b>controls</b> form {{the framework for}} running the business and managing people. They inform people on how the business is to be run and how day-to-day operations are to be conducted. Laws and regulations created by government bodies are also a type of administrative control because they inform the business. Some industry sectors have policies, procedures, standards and guidelines that must be followed – the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) required by Visa and MasterCard is such an example. Other examples of <b>administrative</b> <b>controls</b> include the corporate security policy, password policy, hiring policies, and disciplinary policies.|$|E

2500|$|Information {{assurance}} (IA) is {{the practice}} of assuring information and managing risks related to the use, processing, storage, and transmission of information or data and the systems and processes used for those purposes. Information assurance includes protection of the integrity, availability, authenticity, non-repudiation and confidentiality of user data. It uses physical, technical and <b>administrative</b> <b>controls</b> to accomplish these tasks. While focused predominantly on information in digital form, {{the full range of}} IA encompasses not only digital but also analog or physical form. These protections apply to data in transit, both physical and electronic forms as well as data at rest in various types of physical and electronic storage facilities.|$|E
2500|$|Recall {{the earlier}} {{discussion}} about <b>administrative</b> <b>controls,</b> logical controls, and physical controls. The {{three types of}} controls {{can be used to}} form the basis upon which to build a defense-in-depth strategy. With this approach, defense-in-depth can be conceptualized as three distinct layers or planes laid {{one on top of the}} other. Additional insight into defense-in- depth can be gained by thinking of it as forming the layers of an onion, with data at the core of the onion, people the next outer layer of the onion, and network security, host-based security and application security forming the outermost layers of the onion. [...] Both perspectives are equally valid and each provides valuable insight into the implementation of a good defense-in-depth strategy.|$|E

The breakaway state of Toungoo and the western kingdom of Arakan jointly invaded Lower Burma in 1598, and captured Pegu in 1599. The allies thoroughly looted, and burned down the imperial capital, “one of the wonders of Asia”, in 1600.

50|$|<b>Administrative</b> <b>controls</b> are {{fourth in}} larger {{hierarchy}} of hazard controls, which ranks the effectiveness {{and efficiency of}} hazard controls. <b>Administrative</b> <b>controls</b> are more effective than PPE because they involve some manner of prior planning and avoidance, whereas PPE only serves only as a final barrier between the hazard and worker. <b>Administrative</b> <b>controls</b> are second lowest because they require workers or employers to actively think or comply with regulations and do not offer permanent solutions to problems. Generally, <b>administrative</b> <b>controls</b> are cheaper to begin, but they may become more expensive over time as higher failure rates {{and the need for}} constant training or re-certification eclipse the initial investments of the three more desirable hazard controls in the hierarchy. The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health recommends <b>administrative</b> <b>controls</b> when hazards cannot be removed or changed, and engineering controls are not practical.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Administrative</b> <b>controls</b> are training, procedure, policy, or shift {{designs that}} lessen {{the threat of}} a hazard to an individual.

An autoclave uses steam and pressure to sterilize the waste or reduce its microbiological load to a level at which it may be safely disposed of. Many healthcare facilities routinely use an autoclave to sterilize medical supplies. If the same autoclave is used to sterilize supplies and treat biomedical waste, <b>administrative</b> <b>controls</b> must be used to prevent the waste operations from contaminating the supplies. Effective <b>administrative</b> <b>controls</b> include operator training, strict procedures, and separate times and space for processing biomedical waste.|$|E
50|$|<b>Administrative</b> <b>controls</b> are {{changes to}} workers' {{behavior}} to mitigate a hazard.

Some examples of good work practices include cleaning work spaces with wet-wiping methods or a HEPA-filtered vacuum cleaner instead of dry sweeping with a broom, avoiding handling nanomaterials in a free particle state, storing nanomaterials in containers with tightly closed lids. Normal safety procedures such as hand washing, not storing or consuming food in the laboratory, and proper disposal of hazardous waste are also <b>administrative</b> <b>controls.</b> Other examples are limiting the time workers are handling a material or in a hazardous area, and exposure monitoring for the presence of nanomaterials.|$|E
