40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyze and clarify the process of {{formation}} and change in the institutions <b>and</b> <b>customs</b> of international airfreight. I categorize the institutions <b>and</b> <b>customs</b> for moving goods, money and documents into functional institutions <b>and</b> <b>customs.</b> Rights <b>and</b> obligations flow together with merchandise, foreign exchanges and documents. There are institutions <b>and</b> <b>customs</b> to govern these flows which are known as the coordinating institutions <b>and</b> <b>customs.</b> Formation of <b>and</b> changes to institutions <b>and</b> <b>customs</b> begin from functional ones. A coordinating institution or custom adjusts to the formation of or change in a functional institution or custom. This formation or change causes chain reactions but does not necessarily continue until the system becomes perfect. Some coordinating institutions <b>and</b> <b>customs</b> tend to remain half-finished. This phenomenon is called “incompleteness of coordinating institutions <b>and</b> <b>customs.</b> ” Problems with a coordinating institution or custom tend to be left untouched when the only means of settlement is to revise a functional institution or custom...|$|R

5|$|In digital puppetry, machinima creators become virtual actors; each {{crew member}} {{controls}} {{a character in}} real-time, as in a multiplayer game. The director can use built-in camera controls, if available. Otherwise, video is captured {{from the perspectives of}} one or more puppeteers who serve as camera operators. Puppetry allows for improvisation and offers controls familiar to gamers, but requires more personnel than the other methods and is less precise than scripted recordings. However, some games, such as the Halo series, (except for Halo PC <b>and</b> <b>Custom</b> Edition, which allow AI <b>and</b> <b>custom</b> objects and characters), allow filming only through puppetry. According to Marino, other disadvantages are the possibility of disruption when filming in an open multi-user environment and the temptation for puppeteers to play the game in earnest, littering the set with blood and dead bodies. However, Chris Burke intentionally hosts This Spartan Life in these unpredictable conditions, which are fundamental to the show. Other works filmed using puppetry are the ILL Clan's improvisational comedy series On the Campaign Trail with Larry & Lenny Lumberjack and Rooster Teeth Productions' Red vs. Blue. In recamming, which builds on puppetry, actions are first recorded to a game engine's demo file format, not directly as video frames. Without re-enacting scenes, artists can then manipulate the demo files to add cameras, tweak timing and lighting, and change the surroundings. This technique is limited to the few engines and software tools that support it.|$|E

The General Sejmiks were composed of delegates elected at the provincial sejmiks, and of Senators. Their {{goal was to}} agree on a position for the General Sejm (Sejm Walny) and issue instructions for the deputies on how they were supposed to vote during the General Sejm. The competences of the general sejmiks were defined by precedent <b>and</b> <b>custom</b> rather than law; on rare instances when external circumstances prevented a national Sejm from being convened (such as 1511, 1513 and 1577), the general sejmiks were seen as competent to legislate on national matters. In the 15th century some general sejmiks reserved the right to accept or reject national legislation. In the 16th century they were tasked with preparing drafts of legislation to be discussed at Sejms. Around the 17th century general sejmiks were mostly abandoned (with the exceptions of those in Royal Prussia, see Prussian estates); instead, provincial deputies would meet in special sessions during the Sejm proper.|$|E
