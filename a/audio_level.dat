25|$|For all iPods {{released}} in 2006 and earlier, some equalizer (EQ) sound settings would distort the bass sound far too easily, even on undemanding songs. This would happen for EQ settings like R, Rock, Acoustic, and Bass Booster, because the equalizer amplified the digital <b>audio</b> <b>level</b> beyond the software's limit, causing distortion (clipping) on bass instruments.|$|E
25|$|Record companies, mixing {{engineers}} and mastering engineers have been gradually increasing the overall volume of commercial albums. The greater loudness {{is achieved by}} using higher degrees of compression and limiting during mixing and mastering; compression algorithms have been engineered specifically to accomplish the task of maximizing <b>audio</b> <b>level</b> in the digital stream. Hard limiting or clipping can result, affecting the tone and timbre of the music. The effort to increase loudness {{has been referred to}} as the loudness war.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} function {{provided by}} the carrier in standard AM, but which is lost in either single or double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission, is that it provides an amplitude reference. In the receiver, the automatic gain control (AGC) responds to the carrier so that the reproduced <b>audio</b> <b>level</b> stays in a fixed proportion to the original modulation. On the other hand, with suppressed-carrier transmissions there is no transmitted power during pauses in the modulation, so the AGC must respond to peaks of the transmitted power during peaks in the modulation. This typically involves a so-called fast attack, slow decay circuit which holds the AGC level {{for a second or}} more following such peaks, in between syllables or short pauses in the program. This is very acceptable for communications radios, where compression of the audio aids intelligibility. However it is absolutely undesired for music or normal broadcast programming, where a faithful reproduction of the original program, including its varying modulation levels, is expected.|$|E
