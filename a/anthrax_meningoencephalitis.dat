Infection with the Bacillus anthracis, a large gram-positive, spore-forming bacillus transmitted to humans by contact with infected animals or con-taminated animal products, is rare (1). The inci-dence of meningoencephalitis as a complication of this disease is even rarer and is usually caused by lack of immunization and poor industrial hygiene (2).
