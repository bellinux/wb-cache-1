40|$|The <b>active</b> <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>ageing</b> measure {{reported}} here is {{calculated for the}} 28 European Union countries, with a specific focus on {{the current generation of}} older people and by using the latest data from multiple surveys. It covers diverse aspects of <b>active</b> <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>ageing,</b> by measuring older people’s contribution with respect to not just employment but also their unpaid familial, social and cultural contributions and their independent, healthy and secure living. The article presents the first-of-its-kind quantitative measure of <b>active</b> <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>ageing</b> in the literature on <b>active</b> <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>ageing</b> which hitherto has focused largely on concepts, definitions and public policy strategies. In this pursuit, an important contribution of this measure, referred to as the Active Ageing Index (‘AAI’), is that it also captures how countries differ with respect to capacity and enabling environments for <b>active</b> <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>ageing.</b> The AAI offers a breakdown not just by four domains of <b>active</b> <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>ageing</b> but also by gender. Key findings are that Sweden comes {{at the top of the}} country ranking, followed closely by Denmark, the United Kingdom, Finland, the Netherlands and Ireland. The four southern European countries (Italy, Portugal, Spain and Malta) are middle-ranked countries. Greece and many of the Central European countries are at the bottom, highlighting much greater untapped potentials of <b>active</b> <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>ageing</b> among older people in these countries and a need for greater policy efforts. Women fare worse than men in most countries, identifying a need for an emphasis on reducing gender disparity in experiences of <b>active</b> <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>ageing.</b> The AAI tool developed has the potential to identify the social policy mechanisms behind the differential achievements of <b>active</b> <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>ageing,</b> for example, what <b>active</b> <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>ageing</b> strategies have driven top performers, and in what respect the bottom-ranked countries have lagged behind...|$|E

Therefore, the definitions of parameters that defines different frailties and their inter-relationships are paramount. Physical frailty is defined by reduced hand grip and lower limb strength, and impaired gait. Cognitive frailty is characterized by subjective cognitive compliant or mild cognitive impairment associated with physical frailty. This condition may be investigated using several neuropsychological tests (MMSE, MoCA, HVLT). Psychological frailty is defined essentially trough the investigation of depressive and anxiety conditions.

40|$|The {{importance}} of attaining adequate macronutrient and micronutrient intake throughout {{the life course}} {{is essential for the}} maintenance of health. Claims have been made for the benefits of micronutrient supplementation in later life, and this review considers the strength of the evidence behind these claims focusing on studies with cardiovascular, cancer, eye health, immune, and cognitive end points. While observational data suggest the presence of a link between dietary micronutrient intake and health outcomes, evidence from large randomized controlled trials does not support the use of antioxidant vitamin or mineral supplements among well-nourished older populations. Moreover, there is evidence of possible adverse affects of micronutrient supplementation. In conclusion, the considerable enthusiasm for the use of micronutrient, especially antioxidant, supplements as anti-aging treatments or as treatments for specific diseases of later life is not supported by the currently available scientific literature.

40|$|The {{study of}} <b>active</b> <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>aging</b> {{is a primary}} focus for social and neuroscientific communities. Here, we move a step forward in {{assessing}} electrophysiological neuronal activity changes in the brain with <b>healthy</b> <b>aging.</b> To this end, electroencephalographic (EEG) resting state activity was acquired in 40 <b>healthy</b> subjects (<b>age</b> 16 - 85).

The curve that best fits the changes in FD values across age over the whole sample is a parabola, with the vertex located around age fifty. Moreover, FD changes are site specific, with interhemispheric FD asymmetry being pronounced in elderly individuals in the frontal and central regions. The present results indicate that fractal dimension well describes the modulations of brain activity with age.

40|$|Maintaining {{physical}} {{exercise in the}} elderly is fundamental, as it strengthens physical fitness, increases autonomy, reduces imbalance and reduces risk of falls. Thus, {{it is important to}} identify the risk of falls in the elderly and to determine correlations between this risk, sedentarism/ physical activity (PA) and body mass index (BMI). It is a cross-sectional, descriptive-correlational and quantitative study. A non-probabilistic sample consisted of 124 elderly individuals, 68 females and 56 males, aged 65 - 88 years (M = 71. 9; Dp = 5. 05). The data collection instrument included questions of sociodemographic characterization, health profile and the Berg Balance Scale (BBS). The results show that only 12. 9 % of the elderly present levels of recommended physical activity. The risk of falls is high to 13. 8 %, of the elderly, medium to 55. 6 % and low risk to 30. 6 %. The risk of falls is higher in older people (p = 0. 000), those with higher BMI (p = 0. 023), and less physical activity (p = 0. 000). There were no statistically significant {{differences between men and women}} (p = 0. 668). Evidence shows that an increase in PA and maintenance of BMI within normal values translates into lower levels of imbalance and risk of falling in the elderly. Thus raising the awareness of the elderly and caregivers about these factors should be a strategy to develop, in order to provide an <b>active</b> <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>aging.</b> info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundElevated {{concentrations}} of liver enzymes {{have been associated}} with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, it remains unclear to which specific aspects of diurnal glucose metabolism these associate most. We aimed to investigate the associations between liver enzyme concentrations and 24 [*]h-glucose trajectories in individuals without diabetes mellitus from three independent cohorts. MethodsThis cross-sectional study included 436 participants without diabetes mellitus from the <b>Active</b> <b>and</b> <b>Healthy</b> <b>Aging</b> Study, the Switchbox Study, and the Growing Old Together Study. Fasting blood samples were drawn to measure gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alanine transaminase, and aspartate transaminase. Measures of glycemia (e. g., nocturnal and diurnal mean glucose levels) and glycemic variability (e. g., mean amplitude of glucose excursions) were derived from continuous glucose monitoring. Analyses were performed separately for the three cohorts; derived estimates were additionally meta-analyzed. ResultsAfter meta-analyses of the three cohorts, elevated liver enzyme concentrations, and specifically elevated GGT concentrations, were associated with higher glycemia. More specific, participants in the highest GGT tertile (GGT ≥ 37. 9 [*]U/L) had a 0. 39 [*]mmol/L (95 % confidence interval: 0. 23, 0. 56) higher mean nocturnal glucose (3 : 00 to 6 : 00 a. m.) and a 0. 23 [*]mmol/L (0. 10, 0. 36) higher diurnal glucose (6 : 00 to 0 : 00 a. m.) than participants in the lowest GGT tertile (GGT < 21. 23 [*]U/L). However, elevated liver enzyme concentrations were not associated with a higher glycemic variability.

40|$|In the Northern Netherlands a {{regional}} Healthy Ageing innovation network {{has been developed}} in which many partners in research and education, health and welfare, business, and regional authorities have been collaborating since 2009. The founding father of Healthy Ageing in the Northern Netherlands is the University Medical Centre Groningen. A powerful player in this field, with projects like Life Lines, {{one of the leading}} bio-banks in Europe, and the European Research Institute on the Biology of Ageing. The four Universities of Applied Sciences in the Northern provinces also make valuable contributions. They educate the new professionals that are needed in the fast changing health care and welfare system and they also {{play an important role in}} applied research and innovation, often in collaboration with health institutes. Activities got a boost by the new Centre of Expertise Healthy Ageing, with Hanze University of Applied Sciences Groningen as lead partner. It is supported by the Ministry of Education and Research, to stimulate innovation through public private partnerships. Within two years the number of partners has increased from 35 to 140 organisations, 50 of which are commercial companies. More than 20 innovation labs (living labs) are being realised, they are important for the development of this Centre. Active Ageing at home is one of the important themes in many of the innovation labs. Often in combination with other themes. Stakeholders from universities, health organisations, business partners and regional authorities like municipalities work together in the development and implementation of innovation, with economic as well as societal impact. From a European perspective, it is amazing how fast <b>active</b> <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>ageing</b> has made its way into the European political agenda. As part of the prestigious EU 2020 Strategy and its Innovation Union, <b>active</b> <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>ageing</b> can be found in many other European initiatives and programmes. The knowledge and Innovation Community (KIC) initiative, the European Innovation partnership on <b>Active</b> <b>and</b> <b>Healthy</b> <b>Ageing</b> (EIP AHA) and the prominent place <b>active</b> <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>ageing</b> has been assigned in the EU research programme Horizon 2020 are all proof of the high political attention for this theme...|$|E
40|$|Prenatal and peri-natal events play a {{fundamental}} role in health, development of diseases and ageing (Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD)). Research on {{the determinants of}} <b>active</b> <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>ageing</b> is a priority to: (i) inform strategies for reducing societal and individual costs of an ageing population and (ii) develop effective novel prevention strategies. It is important to compare the trajectories of respiratory diseases with those of other chronic disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{demographic}} {{profile of}} the population in our Board's area is changing with increasing numbers of people living into old age. Whilst most people will have an <b>active</b> <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> old <b>age,</b> there are a sizeable minority of old persons who are likely to require support and care, as they grow older. Research indicates that many older persons are in need of some care and some in need of significant levels of care up to and including residential care. It is important that ageing is not perceived as an illness and {{that the vast majority of}} older persons live <b>healthy</b> <b>and</b> fulfilled lives independent of the health services, with assistance from Family, friends and neighbours. Their experiences, values and knowledge should be recognised and incorporated into all services planned for and with older persons in mind...|$|R
40|$|Europe has {{the highest}} {{prevalence}} of dementia in the world; seven million people are currently affected and this is projected to increase to 13. 4 million by 2050. Across EU countries, participation of people with dementia in family and civic life is diminished by cultures of exclusion and stigmatisation. Dementia is characterised by impaired mental functioning, language and thinking. These impairments are often accompanied by personality, functional and behavioural changes. To fight loneliness and the effects suffered by people with dementia, effective techniques include those that target change of a person’s perception of loneliness and those that increase a person’s resilience. ICT solutions {{can be used to}} increase psychological skills like resilience, <b>and</b> to manage <b>active</b> <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> <b>aging</b> with the use of caring service robots as will be explored with the EU funded MARIO project that involves 10 partners from 6 EU countries. In this project specific technological tools are adopted that try to create real feelings and affections making it easier for the patient to accept assistance from a robot when - in certain situations - in return the human can also support the machine. The approach targeted in MARIO is the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) on which the Multidimensional Prognosis Index (MPI) is based. Used effectively, the MPI can improve dramatically diagnostic accuracy, optimize medical treatment and health outcomes, improve function and quality of life, reduce use of unnecessary formal services, and institute or improve long-term care management. In MARIO, the service robot will provide information to MPI survey and evaluation process based on its observation of the instrumental activities of daily living and detection of changes regarding them. MARIO aims to address and make progress on the challenging problems of loneliness, isolation and dementia in older persons through multi-faceted interventions delivered by service robots...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the reliability of intra-rater and inter-instrument measures during two flexibility programs. Fifty-three <b>active</b> <b>and</b> <b>healthy</b> males, <b>aged</b> between 18 and 28 years old, were randomly included in three groups: control (Cg, n = 18), static stretching (SSg, n = 17), and dynamic stretching (DSg, n = 18). All participants underwent measurements of their active range of knee extension using manual goniometry and computerized photogrammetry, measured in four separated assessments and analyzed using the SPSS, with ((5 %. Both methodologies presented very strongintra-raterreliability (ICC: 0. 91 (0. 99; P< 0. 001) at all four assessments in all the groups, and the instruments showed weak (r: 0. 31 - 0. 6) to strong(r: 0. 61 - 0. 9) correlation, in the Cg (P< 0. 05) and strong (r: 0. 61 - 0. 9) in the SSg and DSg (P< 0. 01), although without differences between groups, indicating that the measures are equally reliable, regardless of interventions...|$|R
