40|$|Abstract: Ball-end milling of Cr 12 MoV {{die steel}} was studied using ceramic and {{cemented}} carbide inserts under different <b>cutting</b> conditions. <b>The</b> <b>cutting</b> forces, wear patterns and chip patterns generated using <b>the</b> different <b>cutting</b> tools <b>at</b> <b>the</b> different <b>cutting</b> conditions were investigated using a three component piezoelectric dynamometer and VHX- 600 E large depth-of-view 3 -D scanner. The relationships among <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> forces, wear patterns and chip patterns were discussed. The {{results indicated that}} <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> forces caused by the ceramic insert were slightly lower than those caused by the cemented carbide insert under <b>the</b> same <b>cutting</b> conditions. For ceramic inserts, effects of <b>cutting</b> conditions on <b>the</b> rake face wear were different from those on the flank wear. The higher wear for the ceramic insert was caused <b>at</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>cutting</b> conditions but <b>the</b> higher wear for the cemented carbide insert was encountered <b>at</b> <b>the</b> higher <b>cutting</b> conditions. <b>The</b> squeezed chip was involved with <b>the</b> higher <b>cutting</b> forces. <b>The</b> sharper <b>cutting</b> edge of <b>the</b> cemented carbide insert was responsible for chip patterns caused by <b>the</b> No. I <b>cutting</b> condition. <b>The</b> effects of <b>cutting</b> conditions on wear patterns were more evident than that on chip patterns...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Experiments {{were carried}} out to {{investigate}} <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> force and tool wear behavior of Sialon ceramic tools in high speed milling of GH 4169 under different <b>cutting</b> parameters. <b>The</b> <b>cutting</b> speed exhibited <b>the</b> most significant influence on <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> force. <b>The</b> <b>cutting</b> force decreased firstly then increased with <b>the</b> increasing of <b>cutting</b> speed. And <b>the</b> effect of feed speed and cutting depth on cutting force were also discussed. The worn surfaces of tool were examined and the elements on the tool surfaces were analyzed by employing scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), respectively. The analysis results of the SEM and EDS showed that the dominant wear pattern were rake face flaking and notching <b>at</b> <b>the</b> low <b>cutting</b> speed while flank wear was the main wear type <b>at</b> <b>the</b> high <b>cutting</b> speed of 1037 m/min...|$|R
25|$|In nature, these {{proteins}} are encoded by mobile genetic elements, introns or inteins.

For inteins and group I introns, this break leads to the duplication of the intron or intein <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> site by means of the homologous recombination repair for double-stranded DNA breaks.|$|E

25|$|In 19th-century {{machining}} practice, it was {{not uncommon}} to use plain water. This was simply a practical expedient to keep the cutter cool, regardless of whether it provided any lubrication <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> edgeâ€“chip interface. When one considers that high-speed steel (HSS) had not been developed yet, the need to cool the tool becomes all the more apparent. (HSS retains its hardness at high temperatures; other carbon tool steels do not.) An improvement was soda water (sodium bicarbonate in water), which better inhibited the rusting of machine slides. These options are generally not used today because more effective alternatives are available.|$|E

500|$|These details {{form the}} context for Clement's {{appearance}} in Scotland and his selection as the new Bishop of Dunblane. Three {{years had passed since}} the death of the last bishop, Osbert. Since there was no electoral college for the diocese, Pope Gregory IX charged the bishops of St Andrews, Brechin and Dunkeld, to find and nominate a suitable replacement. There can only be informed speculation regarding the choice of Clement. Importantly, perhaps, King Alexander was later noted for [...] "his concern for building churches for the Friars Preacher [...] ". The status of the Dominicans <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>cutting</b> edge of religious reform, together with Clement's background, may have been the decisive factors. At any rate, Clement was consecrated as bishop at Wedale on 4 September 1233, by William de Malveisin, Bishop of St Andrews. His consecration meant that he was the first Dominican in the British Isles to obtain a bishopric. This has prompted the historian Archie Duncan to comment that [...] "the choice of the first friar-bishop ... can only be called daring".|$|E
