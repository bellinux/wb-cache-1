5|$|Quolls are {{suffering}} badly from urbanisation, housing development, mining development, {{and expansion of}} agricultural lands. Habitats are also being destroyed by large herbivores trampling the grass and overgrowth, making camouflage difficult. Forest fires <b>and</b> <b>weeds</b> also contribute to habitat destruction.|$|E
5|$|Additional key {{threatening}} {{processes that}} are considered likely to impact the bristle-faced free-tailed bat include the alteration to natural flow regimes, competition from introduced western honey bees (Apis mellifera) for tree hollows, inappropriate fire regimes, reduction of invertebrate prey related to pesticide drift and lack of tree regeneration due to overgrazing <b>and</b> <b>weeds.</b>|$|E
5|$|Main Roads' 2006 {{plan for}} {{environmental}} {{management of the}} project included numerous aspects, described as best management practices, which for the northern segment of the project were beyond the environmental approval requirements. Specific plans were developed regarding fauna, vegetation, dieback <b>and</b> <b>weeds,</b> and revegetation and rehabilitation. Other areas with specific plans included topsoil management, drainage, construction (covering dust, noise, and vibrations), foreshores, and both Aboriginal and European heritage.|$|E

50|$|The term chicken tractor {{comes from}} the {{chickens}} performing many functions normally performed using a modern farm tractor: functions like digging <b>and</b> <b>weeding</b> the soil in preparation for planting trees or crops or fertilizing <b>and</b> <b>weeding</b> to enhance the growth of crops and trees already planted.|$|R
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the weed vegetation due {{to the effect of}} planting methods <b>and</b> <b>weeding</b> regime. Two factors included in the experiment were: methods of planting <b>and</b> <b>weeding</b> regime. The results revealed that weed vegetation in the two methods of planting varied remarkable. Fifty-five weed species belonging to 17 families infested the crop. Among the weed species, Fimbristylis miliacea (L.) Vahl was the principal weed in direct seeded aus rice and Panicum repens L. in the transplanted aus rice. Twenty-four weed species were found to grow only in the direct seeded crop and only eight in the transplanted crop. <b>Weed</b> density <b>and</b> <b>weed</b> dry weight was significantly affected by the method of planting <b>and</b> <b>weeding</b> regime. <b>Weed</b> density <b>and</b> dry weight was significantly higher in direct seeded than in transplanted crop...|$|R
5|$|The adult russet sparrow {{is mostly}} a seed-eater, eating the seeds of herbs <b>and</b> <b>weeds</b> as well as rice, barley, and other grains. Berries, {{such as those of}} the kingore (certain Berberis spp.), are also eaten when available. Nestlings are fed mostly on insects, {{especially}} caterpillars and larval beetles obtained on trees and flying insects caught by aerial pursuit. During the breeding season adults also consume insects.|$|E
5|$|The {{house sparrow}} is {{strongly}} associated with human habitations, and can live in urban or rural settings. Though found in widely varied habitats and climates, it typically avoids extensive woodlands, grasslands, and deserts away from human development. It feeds mostly on the seeds of grains <b>and</b> <b>weeds,</b> {{but it is an}} opportunistic eater and commonly eats insects and many other foods. Its predators include domestic cats, hawks, owls, and many other predatory birds and mammals.|$|E
5|$|By 2005, the disused eastern {{trackbed}} {{was filled}} with rubble, brambles <b>and</b> <b>weeds,</b> and the station had acquired a bad reputation due to muggings {{and the use of}} illegal drugs on the station premises. A community garden project, Eastside Roots, was set up in the disused trackbed by local permaculture enthusiast Nick Ward. It was built using sustainable materials, including bricks dug out during the construction of the Cabot Circus shopping centre. The project led to a general improvement of the station ambience, and residents were more willing to use it. The footbridge was replaced in 2013 to allow for electrification of the line, but the new, higher, bridge angered local residents who felt it infringed on their privacy.|$|E

5|$|The {{consequences}} of a persistent biotic crisis have been predicted to last {{for at least five}} million years. It could result in a decline in biodiversity and homogenization of biotas, accompanied by a proliferation of species that are opportunistic, such as pests <b>and</b> <b>weeds.</b> Novel species may also emerge; in particular taxa that prosper in human-dominated ecosystems may rapidly diversify into many new species. Microbes are likely to benefit from the increase in nutrient-enriched environmental niches. No new species of existing large vertebrates are likely to arise and food chains will probably be shortened.|$|E
5|$|As an adult, {{the house}} sparrow mostly feeds on {{the seeds of}} grains <b>and</b> <b>weeds,</b> but it is {{opportunistic}} and adaptable, and eats whatever foods are available. In towns and cities, it often scavenges for food in garbage containers and congregates in the outdoors of restaurants and other eating establishments to feed on leftover food and crumbs. It can perform complex tasks to obtain food, such as opening automatic doors to enter supermarkets, clinging to hotel walls to watch vacationers on their balconies, and nectar robbing kowhai flowers. In common with many other birds, the house sparrow requires grit to digest the harder items in its diet. Grit can be either stone, often grains of masonry, or the shells of eggs or snails; oblong and rough grains are preferred.|$|E
5|$|It {{was taken}} down after the Glorious Revolution but was {{replaced}} by order of William III. In 1898 it was moved to a location {{in the garden of}} Gwydyr House but was taken down four years later {{to make room for the}} stands for the coronation of Edward VII. It lay on its back amid grass <b>and</b> <b>weeds</b> in a state of total neglect until it was re-erected in 1903 outside the New Admiralty building, but was displaced again when the Admiralty Citadel was built in 1940. During the Second World War it was put into storage at Aldwych tube station. It was relocated to its present site in 1947. The statue is listed by Historic England as a Grade I listed building, a status which it was granted in 1970.|$|E

5|$|Maya warfare {{was not so}} much {{aimed at}} {{destruction}} of the enemy as the seizure of captives and plunder. The Spanish described the weapons of war of the Petén Maya as bows and arrows, fire-sharpened poles, flint-headed spears and two-handed swords crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset obsidian, similar to the Aztec macuahuitl. Pedro de Alvarado described how the Xinca of the Pacific coast attacked the Spanish with spears, stakes and poisoned arrows. Maya warriors wore body armour in the form of quilted cotton that had been soaked in salt water to toughen it; the resulting armour compared favourably to the steel armour worn by the Spanish. The Maya had historically employed ambush and raiding as their preferred tactic, and its employment against the Spanish proved troublesome for the Europeans. In response to the use of cavalry, the highland Maya took to digging pits on the roads, lining them with fire-hardened stakes and camouflaging them with grass <b>and</b> <b>weeds,</b> a tactic that according to the Kaqchikel killed many horses.|$|E
5|$|Domestic geese {{are much}} larger than their wild {{counterparts}} and tend to have thick necks, an upright posture, and large bodies with broad rear ends. The greylag-derived birds are large and fleshy and used for meat, while the Chinese geese have smaller frames and are mainly used for egg production. The fine down of both is valued for use in pillows and padded garments. They forage on grass <b>and</b> <b>weeds,</b> supplementing this with small invertebrates, {{and one of the}} attractions of rearing geese is their ability to grow and thrive on a grass-based system. They are very gregarious and have good memories and can be allowed to roam widely in the knowledge that they will return home by dusk. The Chinese goose is more aggressive and noisy than other geese and {{can be used as a}} guard animal to warn of intruders. The flesh of meat geese is dark-coloured and high in protein, but they deposit fat subcutaneously, although this fat contains mostly monounsaturated fatty acids. The birds are killed either around 10 or about 24 weeks. Between these ages, problems with dressing the carcase occur because of the presence of developing pin feathers.|$|E
5|$|Maya armies {{were highly}} disciplined, and warriors participated in regular {{training}} exercises and drills; every able-bodied adult male {{was available for}} military service. Maya states did not maintain standing armies; warriors were mustered by local officials who reported back to appointed warleaders. There were also units of full-time mercenaries who followed permanent leaders. Most warriors were not full-time, however, and were primarily farmers; {{the needs of their}} crops usually came before warfare. Maya warfare was not so much aimed at destruction of the enemy as the seizure of captives and plunder. Maya warriors entered battle against the Spanish with flint-tipped spears, bows and arrows and stones. They wore padded cotton armour to protect themselves. The Spanish described the weapons of war of the Petén Maya as bows and arrows, fire-sharpened poles, flint-headed spears and two-handed swords crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset obsidian, similar to the Aztec macuahuitl. Maya warriors wore body armour in the form of quilted cotton that had been soaked in salt water to toughen it; the resulting armour compared favourably to the steel armour worn by the Spanish. Warriors bore wooden or animal hide shields decorated with feathers and animal skins. The Maya had historically employed ambush and raiding as their preferred tactic, and its employment against the Spanish proved troublesome for the Europeans. In response to the use of cavalry, the highland Maya took to digging pits on the roads, lining them with fire-hardened stakes and camouflaging them with grass <b>and</b> <b>weeds,</b> a tactic that according to the Kaqchikel killed many horses.|$|E

40|$|Weed {{integrated}} {{pest management}} (WIPM) {{is becoming more and}} more important. Intimate understanding of <b>weed</b> spatial distribution <b>and</b> <b>weed</b> emergence pattern is the starting point of developing any successful WIPM program. As an applied activity, weed research results should be readily applicable by farmers <b>and</b> <b>weed</b> managers. The objectives of this study were to model <b>weed</b> seedbank <b>and</b> seedling spatial distributions, <b>and</b> <b>weed</b> emergence patterns, <b>and</b> consequently develop <b>weed</b> sampling plans <b>and</b> predict <b>weed</b> emergence patterns. Study was conducted to show that the <b>weed</b> seedbank <b>and</b> <b>weed</b> seedlings possess spatial distribution. Negative binomial (NB) distribution fitted spatial distribution well. The sequential sampling plans based on NB are easy to use by weed scouts using only a hand calculator. The research also explored the possibility of incorporating spatial distribution into linear regression models which predict weed infestation from soil nutrient analysis. Research was also conducted to formulate a temperature-dependent population level model for predicting pigweed (Amaranthus spp.), lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.), and crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis (L) Scop.) emergence patterns. The predictive program was developed by combining the poikilotherm equation with the Weibull function. The parameters were estimated using laboratory datasets. The program was validated against independent field observations and results were accurate. The unique feature of this program is that farm managers with a PC can access the program <b>and</b> make <b>weed</b> control plans. ...|$|R
