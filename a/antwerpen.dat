25|$|The {{triptych}} The Last Judgment (Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten <b>Antwerpen),</b> {{was commissioned}} by the almoners of the Cathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp in 1525, {{is one of his}} best works in its originality and mastery. The paintings in grisaille on the back were executed by Peter de Kempeneer, who was, at that time, an apprentice in the van Orley's workshop.|$|E
25|$|According to folklore, notably {{celebrated by}} a statue {{in front of}} the town hall, the city got its name from a legend about a giant called Antigoon who lived near the Scheldt river. He exacted a toll from passing boatmen, and for those who refused, he severed one of their hands and threw it into the river. Eventually the giant was killed by a young hero named Silvius Brabo, who cut off the giant's own hand and flung it into the river. Hence the name <b>Antwerpen,</b> from Dutch hand werpen, akin to Old English hand and wearpan (to throw), which has evolved to today's warp.|$|E
25|$|However the {{floating}} hulk was on captured on 14 May 1940 by the invading German forces. The ship sank after {{being attacked by}} a British aircraft on 21 and 22 June 1940. The Germans decided to salvage her in October 1940 and converted her into an Anti Aircraft battery at <b>Antwerpen.</b> The conversion lasted from 1941 to 1943 and the ship was renamed Ariadne. After the war the ship was recovered in Wilhelmshaven and given back to the Netherlands, to be converted at the Wilton-Fijenoord shipyard into an accommodation ship. On 21 October 1947 she was recommissioned and given back her initial name Hertog Hendrik. She was finally decommissioned on 27 September 1968 and stricken from the navy list on 28 August 1969.|$|E
25|$|The {{composer}} {{most probably}} {{spent his entire}} life in Amsterdam, only occasionally visiting other cities in connection with his professional activities: {{he was asked to}} inspect organs, give opinions and advice on organ building and restoration, etc. These duties resulted in short visits to Delft, Dordrecht (1614), Enkhuizen, Haarlem (1594), Harderwijk (1608), Middelburg (1603), Nijmegen (1605), Rotterdam (1610), Rhenen (1616), as well as Deventer, his birthplace (1595, 1616). Sweelinck's longest voyage was to <b>Antwerpen</b> in 1604, when he was commissioned by the Amsterdam authorities to buy a harpsichord for the city. No documentary evidence has turned up to support the tradition, going back to Mattheson, that Sweelinck visited Venice– perhaps a confusion with his brother, the painter Gerrit Pietersz Sweelink, who did– and similarly {{there is no evidence that}} he ever crossed the English Channel, although copies of his music did such as the pieces included in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book. His popularity as a composer, performer and teacher increased steadily during his lifetime. Contemporaries nicknamed him Orpheus of Amsterdam and even the city authorities frequently brought important visitors to hear Sweelinck's improvisations.|$|E
500|$|In Bruges, Amsterdam, <b>Antwerpen</b> {{and other}} Flemish cities, a [...] "troy" [...] unit ("trooisch pond") {{was also in}} use as a {{standard}} for valuable materials and medicine. As in France, {{the way in which}} the Flemish troy ounce was subdivided depended on what was weighed. Unlike the French, the Flemish apothecaries divided the scruple in 20 grains. The Flemish troy pound became the standard for the gold and apothecaries' system in the United Kingdom of the Netherlands; it was also used in this way in Lübeck. (The London troy pound was referred to as the 'trooisch pond', after metrification.) ...|$|E

Passengers for London from Amsterdam and Rotterdam will undertake all security checks before boarding and will not need to get off in Brussels. The train will also convey passengers from the Netherlands on journeys to Brussels who wil not need to pass through security and they will be allocated half the train which will be kept separate from the London-bound passengers by locking the intermediate door. This half of the train will be security swept on arrival at Brussels before Brussels to London passengers can board. The journey from London to Amsterdam Centraal will take 3hrs 41mins and trains will call at Brussels Zuid/Midi and Rotterdam Centraal Station. From Amsterdam Centraal to London St Pancras, trains will take 4hrs 9mins to include the 28 minutes stop at Brussels.

2500|$|The various bastions, ravelins and lunettes of the {{fortification}} {{were all}} named and would mount over 230 cannon and mortars {{during the course}} of the siege. The principal effort of the French concentrated on the bastions Coehoorn and Pucelle. [...] Facing the French trench lines, the sides of Coehoorn were flanked on its right by the ravelin [...] <b>Antwerpen</b> and on its [...] left the ravelin Diden. Between the bastion and <b>Antwerpen</b> was the lunette Holland and between the bastion and Diden was the lunette Zealand. To the left of Diden was the lunette, Utrecht, and left of that the bastion Pucelle. The area between the bastions of Coehoorn and Pucelle was chosen partly because the ground was drier and partly because this was the only part of the fortress not directly covered by additional lines as was the northwest and south east sides of Bergen op Zoom. This area would witness the most continuous and fierce combat of the siege.|$|E
2500|$|Antwerp has a {{university}} and several colleges.

2500|$|As in painting, Renaissance {{architecture}} {{took some}} time to reach the Netherlands and did not entirely supplant the Gothic elements. An architect directly influenced by the Italian masters was Cornelis Floris de Vriendt, who designed the city hall of <b>Antwerpen,</b> finished in 1564. The style sometimes known as [...] "Antwerp Mannerism", keeping a similar overall structure to late-Gothic buildings, but with larger windows and much florid decoration and detailing in Renaissance styles, was widely influential across Northern Europe, for example in Elizabethan architecture, and {{is part of the}} wider movement of Northern Mannerism.|$|E
