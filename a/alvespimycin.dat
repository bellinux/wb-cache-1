40|$|International audienceSince {{the late}} 1990 s and the rapid {{expansion}} of monoclonal antibodies and synthetic protein kinase inhibitors in oncology, anticancer natural products fell out of fashion with the pharmaceutical industry. But in 2007 with the approval of three new drugs derived from natural products, the emergence of promising antitumor compounds from microorganisms (e. g. <b>alvespimycin,</b> salinosporamide) and the growing importance of new formulations of known natural product-derived drugs (nanoparticle formulations, oral forms), we are witnessing a new wave for natural products in oncology. The recent approval of the microtubule-targeted epothilone derivative ixabepilone (Ixempra), the DNA-alkylating marine alkaloid trabectedin (Yondelis) and the inhibitor of mTOR protein kinase temsirolimus (Torisel) is emblematic of the evolution of the field which combines the long established finding of conventional cytotoxic agents and the emergence of molecularly targeted therapeutics. These three examples also illustrate the increasing importance of microbial sources for the discovery of medically useful natural products. The contribution of innovative biological targets is also highlighted here, with references to proteasome inhibitors and novel approaches such as manipulation of mRNA splicing. Altogether, these observations plead for the return of natural products in oncology...|$|E
40|$|To {{identify}} dysregulated pathways in distinct {{phases of}} NOTCH 1 -mediated T-cell leukemogenesis, {{as well as}} small-molecule inhibitors that could synergize with or substitute for γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs) in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) therapy, we compared gene expression profiles in a Notch 1 -induced mouse model of T-ALL with those in human T-ALL. The overall patterns of NOTCH 1 -mediated gene expression in human and mouse T-ALLs were remarkably similar, as defined early in transformation in the mouse by the regulation of MYC and its target genes and activation of nuclear factor-κB and PI 3 K/AKT pathways. Later events in murine Notch 1 -mediated leukemogenesis included down-regulation of genes encoding tumor suppressors and negative cell cycle regulators. Gene set enrichment analysis and connectivity map algorithm predicted that small-molecule inhibitors, including heat-shock protein 90, histone deacetylase, PI 3 K/AKT, and proteasome inhibitors, could reverse the gene expression changes induced by NOTCH 1. When tested in vitro, histone deacetylase, PI 3 K and proteasome inhibitors synergized with GSI in suppressing T-ALL cell growth in GSI-sensitive cells. Interestingly, <b>alvespimycin,</b> a potent inhibitor of the heat-shock protein 90 molecular chaperone, markedly inhibited the growth of both GSI-sensitive and -resistant T-ALL cells, suggesting that its loss disrupts signal transduction pathways crucial for the growth and survival of T-ALL cells...|$|E
40|$|Background: Lung adenocarcinom (AC) is {{the most}} common form of lung cancer. Currently, the number of medical options to deal with lung cancer is very limited. In this study, we aimed to {{investigate}} potential therapeutic compounds for lung adenocarcinoma based on integrative analysis. Methodology/Principal Findings: The candidate therapeutic compounds were identified in a two-step process. First, a meta-analysis of two published microarray data was conducted to obtain a list of 343 differentially expressed genes specific to lung AC. In the next step, expression profiles of these genes were used to query the Connectivity-Map (C-MAP) database to identify a list of compounds whose treatment reverse expression direction in various cancer cells. Several compounds in the categories of HSP 90 inhibitor, HDAC inhibitor, PPAR agonist, PI 3 K inhibitor, passed our screening to be the leading candidates. On top of the list, three HSP 90 inhibitors, i. e. 17 -AAG (also known as tanespimycin), monorden, and <b>alvespimycin,</b> showed significant negative enrichment scores. Cytotoxicity as well as effects on cell cycle regulation and apoptosis were evaluated experimentally in lung adenocarcinoma cell line (A 549 or GLC- 82) with or without treatment with 17 -AAG. In vitro study demonstrated that 17 -AAG alone or in combination with cisplatin (DDP) can significantly inhibit lung adenocarcinoma cell growth by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Conclusions/Significance: We have used an in silico screening to identify compounds for treating lung cancer. One suc...|$|E
