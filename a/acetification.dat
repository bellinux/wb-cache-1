A portion of selected unfermented must may be kept as Süssreserve, to be added prior to bottling as a sweetening component. Some winemakers create a second batch of wine from the used pomace by adding a quantity of water equivalent to the juice removed, letting the mixture sit for 24 hours, and draining off the liquid. This wine may be used as a drink for the employees of the winemaker or as a basis for some pomace brandies.

40|$|Acetic acid {{bacteria}} are strict aerobes, capable of oxidizing ethanol to acetic acid {{in the presence}} of oxygen. Considering that <b>acetification</b> is an exothermal process, with high need for oxygen supply, efficient mass transfer between the gaseous and aqueous phase and efficient heat transfer in the fermentation medium, pose as the main challenges when focusing process improvement. Throughout time, several setups have been tested and used for improving efficiency in acetic fermentations, ranging from open barrel to automated acetator setups with air injection. This work demonstrates the use of a constricted oscillatory mesotube reactor for acetic fermentations, as an alternative to common <b>acetification</b> setups. The constricted mesotube reactor combined with oscillatory flow leads to high mass and heat transfer within the fermentation chamber, due to the combination between axial mixing of the fermentation media, promoted by pistons, and the periodic constrictions, which function as baffles. Hydrodynamic properties of this type of setup have already been described, demonstrating an improved gas diffusion in liquid media. Furthermore, this type of reactor has been tested for several chemical and biological processes, and demonstrated high potential in process improvement. In this work, acetic fermentations were performed in an oscillatory constricted mesotube reactor, using an Acetobacter sp. inoculum in a synthetic medium containing acetic acid and ethanol. Acetifications were carried out at 30 ºC with air injection at 0. 18 vvm. Biomass growth, total acidity and ethanol-acetic acid conversion were monitored during the process, being observed that stationary phase was reached at about 70 hours, for an increase in biomass concentration of about 0. 2 ± 0. 1 g L- 1 (expressed in dry weight) and a final total acidity of 4. 2 ± 0. 6 %, with an ethanol-acetic acid conversion efficiency of 97. 4 ± 9. 28 % of the theoretical yield and a GK efficiency of 96. 7 ± 16. 7 %.

However no correlation between occurring species and quality of product have been examined. In this study a selected starter culture (SSC) was designed, implemented at laboratory scale and applied to vinegar factory by scale up procedure. A. pasteurianus strain AB 0220 was selected as SSC {{on the basis of}} phenotypical and technological traits suitable for TBV must oxidation. The SSC was implemented through three stages: starting steps in laboratory conditions (Stage 1); scale-up performed through a tanks system (Stage 2) and a barrels system (Stage 3) in factory conditions. Main analytical parameters were monitored by pH, titrable acidity, ethanol and soluble solids trend. Moreover molecular identification based on 16 S rDNA region analysis (PCR-DGGE and sequencing) and ERIC-PCR were performed respectively to assess species occurrence and evaluate strain persistence during the whole process. In particular the dominant AAB species population was estimated by PCR-DGGE analysis allowing to distinguish two different species groups along the 3 stages. 16 S rDNA sequencing confirmed DGGE results, showing high percentage of sequence homology (99 and 100 %) with A. pasteurianus at stage 1 and 2 and Ga. europaeus at Stage 3. Finally, ERIC-PCR fingerprinting assay performed {{at the end of each}} <b>acetification</b> stage showed an electrophoretic profile similar to that of AB 0220 at stage 1 and 2, whereas a different pattern at stage 3. This result supports DGGE data suggesting a change in the population during the 3 <b>acetification</b> stages. On the basis of these evidences, our hypothesis is that the persistence of inoculated strain during stages 1 and 2 was assured by the scale-up procedure. New must was periodically added to increase the SSC volume and microbial population was not exposed to constant effect of acetic acid. Instead, the static conditions of stage 3 resulted in a constant increase of acetic acid concentration, negatively affected AB 0220 growth. In this environment, indigenous Ga. europaeus cells, which is less sensitive to physiological stress caused by acetic acid 3, found optimal growth conditions to become dominant. In this study for the first a SSC for TBV production was implemented and applied at factory scale. Results demonstrated that selected A. pasteurianus strains are suitable to start the <b>acetification</b> of TBV ensuring the <b>acetification</b> course in unsuitable conditions for other AAB such as Ga. europaeus. On the contrary, Ga. europaeus strains are able to oxidise cooked must in presence of constant of acetic acid concentration corresponding to the final stages of TBV oxidation.

The ability of growth and <b>acetification</b> of the wild strain was impossible under such conditions. The CWBI-B 418 and CWBI-B 419 strains exhibited then thermoresistance and acidoresistance property.

The inactivation constant of the enzymes ADH and ALDH of these strains was indeed much lower than that of the wild strain. By taking into account of all these physiological potentialities, the use of the CWBI-B 418 and CWBI-B 419 strains in industrial vinegar production in Sub-Saharan Africa would make it possible to reduce in a considerable way the cooling water expenses.

Minor volatiles associated with varietal aroma were identified, monoterpenic alcohols in orange vinegar, esters in banana vinegar, C 13 -norisoprenoids in cherry vinegar and lactones in mango vinegar, indicating fruit vinegars differentiated sensory quality. Total antioxidant activity analysis by FRAP, revealed fruit vinegars potential to preserve and deliver fruit functional properties. Antioxidant activity of fruit vinegars, expressed as equivalents of Fe 2 SO 4, was of 11. 0  ±  1. 67  mmol L 1 for orange, 4. 8  ±  0. 5  mmol L 1 for mango, 18. 6  ±  2. 33  mmol L 1 for cherry and 3. 7  ±  0. 3  mmol L 1 for banana. Therefore, fruit vinegars presented antioxidant activity close to the reported for the corresponding fruit, and between 8 and 40 folds higher than the one found in commercial cider vinegar, demonstrating the high functional potential of these novel vinegar products.

40|$|Acetic Acid Bacteria (AAB) {{are well}} known {{for their ability to}} oxidize alcohols, aldehydes, sugars, polyalcohols and others {{molecules}} with ketonic or aldehydic functional groups. Species of Acetobacter and Gluconobacter lack a functional Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway and are unable to metabolize hexose sugars by this route. Hexose and pentose sugars are oxidatively metabolized by the hexose monophosphate pathway to acetic and lactic acids. In some cases, hexose sugars may be directly oxidized to gluconate and ketogluconates without further catabolism, leading to an accumulation of these end products in the culture medium. Furthermore, Gluconobacter oxydans has been used to oxidize various sugars and sugar alcohols to substances of industrial significance, such as sorbose, gluconic acid and ketogluconic acids. Dihydroxyacetone, 2, 3 -butanediol, and acetoin are also significant products of carbohydrate metabolism evolved by AAB Our trials of surface static fermentation was carried out on complex media such as base wine (BW) for Traditional Balsamic Vinegar, where sugars and alcohols are present in different amount. In this conditions AAB sequentially oxidized the several carbon sources, first ethanol, then glucose and glycerol. In particular the oxidation of glucose to gluconate occurred when the ethanol was exhausted, then high amount of gluconate was accumulated in the medium. BW had an initial composition of around 7 % (v/v) of ethanol and 25 % of sugars with glucose and fructose in the ratio 1 / 1. At the end of the fermentation the glucose/fructose ratio was in favour of fructose, titratable acidity was very high due to the gluconate formed, while volatile acidity decreased. In summary, when surface fermentation is extended afterward the ethanol run out, other substrates are oxidized and give origin to a vinegar with a completely different composition. The extension of the oxidative step is a tool for increasing vinegar’s sweetness and acidity without the acetic acid sensorial pungency.
