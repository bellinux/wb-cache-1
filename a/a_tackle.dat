In a very tense and brutally physical match, the scores were tied at 10-all when the French were awarded a scrum five metres out from the tryline.

Tech's 31-point margin of victory was the biggest bowl-game win in school history, and Alabama's loss was their biggest in a bowl game since a loss in the 1972 Orange Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Michigan's {{line was}} strong on defense. The fullback was {{called upon to}} make <b>a</b> <b>tackle</b> only once in the entire season.

5|$|Virginia Tech's offense, led by quarterback Sean Glennon, {{began their}} first {{possession}} {{at their own}} 37-yard line. However, a sack, <b>a</b> <b>tackle</b> for loss, and an incomplete pass denied the Hokies' offense positive yardage and {{they were forced to}} punt. Tech punter Brent Bowden managed a 54-yard kick that forced the Eagles to start at their own 14-yard line, but three big plays of 16, 19, and 19yards drove the Eagles deep into Virginia Tech territory. As before, however, Virginia Tech's defense stiffened and Boston College was forced into a fourth down. Instead of attempting a long field goal, the Eagles instead attempted to convert the fourth down but were foiled by an incomplete pass.|$|E
