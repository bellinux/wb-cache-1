5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the capital {{shifted to the}} newly built, well planned city of Gandhinagar. This marked the start of <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> decline in the city, marked {{by a lack of}} development.|$|E

5|$|Dutch brick {{is a type}} {{of brick}} made in the Netherlands, or similar brick, and an {{architectural}} style of building with brick developed by the Dutch.

5|$|On 3–4 April 1559, Henry {{signed the}} Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis with the Holy Roman Empire and England, ending <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> Italian wars. The treaty was sealed by the betrothal of Catherine's thirteen-year-old {{daughter}} Elisabeth to Philip II of Spain. Their proxy wedding, in Paris on 22 June 1559, was celebrated with festivities, balls, masques, and {{five days of}} jousting.|$|E
5|$|Prevention of TB {{involves}} screening {{those at}} high risk, {{early detection and}} treatment of cases, and vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine. Those at high risk include household, workplace, and social contacts of people with active TB. Treatment {{requires the use of}} multiple antibiotics over <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem with increasing rates of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).|$|E

5|$|Stephen died on 15 August 1038. He {{was buried}} in the {{basilica}} of Székesfehérvár. His reign was followed by <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> civil wars, pagan uprisings and foreign invasions. The instability ended in 1077 when Ladislaus, a grandson of Vazul, ascended the throne.|$|E
5|$|There is a {{small stone}} chapel in the grounds, {{believed}} to date to about 1450 and built by the Hungerford family for use by themselves and their servants. It has an east window with Perpendicular tracery. After <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> use as stables, it was restored in the twentieth century. There is also a brick-built storehouse mounted on staddle stones to prevent incursion by rats.|$|E
5|$|When {{stationary}} fronts become {{smaller in}} scale, degenerating {{to a narrow}} zone where wind direction changes significantly over a relatively short distance, they become known as shearlines.

5|$|While {{the number}} and {{severity}} of symptoms varies among individuals, repetitive regurgitation of undigested food (known as rumination) {{after the start of}} a meal is always present. In some individuals, the regurgitation is small, occurring over <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time following ingestion, and can be rechewed and swallowed. In others, the amount can be bilious and short lasting, and must be expelled.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> uplift {{and erosion}} was {{concurrent}} with {{and followed the}} above events, creating a major unconformity. Sediments worn off the Death Valley region were shed both east and west and carried by wind and water; the eastern sediments ended up in Colorado and are now famous for their dinosaur fossils. No Jurassic to Eocene sedimentary formations exist in the area except for some possibly Jurassic-age volcanic rock around Butte Valley. Large parts of previously deposited formations were removed; probably by streams that washed the sediment into the Cretaceous Seaway that longitudinally divided North America to the east.|$|E
5|$|A pupil {{like myself}} had {{to submit to}} Balakirev a {{proposed}} composition in its embryo, say, even the first four or eight bars. Balakirev would immediately make corrections, indicating how to recast such an embryo; he would criticize it, would praise and extol the first two bars, but would censure the next two, ridicule them, and try {{hard to make the}} author disgusted with them. Vivacity of composition and fertility were not at all in favor, frequent recasting was demanded, and the composition was extended over <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time under the cold control of self-criticism.|$|E
40|$|A {{protocol}} for quantum bit commitment is proposed. The protocol is feasible with present technology and is secure against cheaters with unlimited computing power {{as long as}} the sender does not have the technology to store an EPR particle for <b>an</b> arbitrarily <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time. The protocol is very efficient, requiring only tens of particles. Comment: LaTeX file, 10 pages, no figures.

5|$|Adams {{left the}} club in April 1962 and was {{replaced}} with Sid Abel, who was also head coach. First under Abel as GM and then Ned Harkness, Alex Delvecchio, Lindsay, and Jimmy Skinner in the position, the Red Wings suffered <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> decline, from 1967 until 1983, during which they made the playoffs only twice.

5|$|After <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> {{remaining}} empty, {{the castle}} {{slowly began to}} decay, until in 1812, when Simon Temple, a local businessman, leased the castle from the Strathmores and made it habitable. He re-roofed the chapel (allowing it {{to be used for}} public worship again), added battlements to the wings and cultivated the gardens. However, his failed business ventures prevented him from completing his work, and in 1819 the castle was lived in by a Mr. Thomas Wade.|$|E
5|$|As Petty gets {{further into}} his investigation, Rost's answers become more evasive. Petty {{suspects}} that Eric actually kills women for his snuff films, a suspicion further exacerbated when Rost {{says that he}} will relay Petty's contact information to the women instead of giving their contact information to Petty. It is not clear at the film's end whether Rost's films are actual snuff in the fictional subplot's context. However, {{it is known that}} he spies on them for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time before asking them to participate.|$|E
