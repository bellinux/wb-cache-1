40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{physiological}} and energy demand responses to upper body <b>aerobic</b> <b>exercises</b> performed with different postures {{are not well}} known. The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare energy cost and physiological responses to upper body <b>aerobic</b> <b>exercises</b> performed with different postures. MethodEight physically active males (> 1 year active), untrained in upper body <b>aerobic</b> <b>exercises,</b> with 28. 2 ± 5. 7 years, ht 173. 7 ± 7. 4 cm, body mass 74. 1 ± 11. 4 kg, VO 2 Peak 30. 2 ± 2. 09 ml/kg/min and Body Mass Index 24. 4 ± 2. 5 kg/m 2 performed a preliminary maximal test and two upper body <b>aerobic</b> <b>exercises</b> 30 -min sessions in different days. ResultsMetabolic and hemodynamic responses to upper body <b>aerobic</b> <b>exercises</b> performed in sit-position and vertical-position were compared. The vertical-position trial showed greater total energy cost (14. 3 %; p= 0. 01), higher lipid catabolism (p= 0. 001) and a higher double product (p= 0. 04), when compared to the sit-position trial. ConclusionThe upper body <b>aerobic</b> <b>exercises</b> performed in vertical-position induces a higher energetic demand and cardiovascular load than in sit-position...|$|R

25|$|A year long, moderate-intensity <b>aerobic</b> <b>exercise</b> program {{increased}} DHT and SHBG in sedentary men age 40–75, but had {{no effect}} on other androgens. Both DHT and SHBG increased 14% in exercisers at 3 months, and at 12 months they remained 9% above baseline. SHBG is protective against DHT as it binds free androgen. In acute assessment of hormone levels in soccer players before, during and after a game, DHT and testosterone increased during the match, but returned to baseline after 45 minutes rest. <b>Aerobic</b> <b>exercise</b> in Japanese rats done on a rodent treadmill doubled local concentrations of DHT in calf muscles as assessed by protein assay. After intense aerobic effort, high endurance athletes were also found to have lower free testosterone the next day. In prolonged endurance exercise, such as a marathon, levels ultimately decrease. Similarly, DHT drops, while adrenal androgen and cortisol will increase with the stress response.|$|E

25|$|Angiogenesis is {{generally}} associated with <b>aerobic</b> <b>exercise</b> and endurance exercise. While arteriogenesis produces network changes {{that allow for}} a large increase {{in the amount of}} total flow in a network, angiogenesis causes changes that allow for greater nutrient delivery {{over a long period of}} time. Capillaries are designed to provide maximum nutrient delivery efficiency, so an increase in the number of capillaries allows the network to deliver more nutrients in the same amount of time. A greater number of capillaries also allows for greater oxygen exchange in the network. This is vitally important to endurance training, because it allows a person to continue training for an extended period of time. However, no experimental evidence suggests that increased capillarity is required in endurance exercise to increase the maximum oxygen delivery.|$|E

More research is being conducted {{to better understand the}} specific mechanisms that may be responsible for this observation. Over the past half century, a significant amount of research has been focused on the use of stereotaxically placed lesions as a potential treatment method for ataxic cerebral palsy (the method had shown significant improvements in treating Parkinson's disease). Many studies suggested that lesions of the dentate nucleus produced an apparent reduction of symptoms, however the success of these studies did not attain the same level of success that was found when using the method to treat Parkinson’s disease. With the improvement of brain imaging techniques in recent time, it may be possible in the future to utilize these techniques to identify specific sites of imbalance within the brain which could be treated with stereotaxically placed electrodes.|$|E

500|$|Cognitive {{behavioral}} {{therapy is}} currently the most effective clinical treatment for psychostimulant addictions. Additionally, research on the neurobiological effects of physical exercise suggests that daily <b>aerobic</b> <b>exercise,</b> especially endurance exercise (e.g., marathon running), prevents the development of drug addiction and is an effective adjunct therapy (i.e., a supplemental treatment) for amphetamine addiction. Exercise leads to better treatment outcomes when used as an adjunct treatment, particularly for psychostimulant addictions.There is accelerating evidence that physical exercise is a useful treatment for preventing and reducing drug addiction... In some individuals, exercise has its own rewarding effects, and a behavioral economic interaction may occur, such that physical and social rewards of exercise can substitute for the rewarding effects of drug abuse.... The value of this form of treatment for drug addiction in laboratory animals and humans is that exercise, if it can substitute for the rewarding effects of drugs, could be self-maintained {{over an extended period}} of time.

We explained the influences of aerobic dance on motor abilities and described the procedure for planning lesson of aerobic dance. We also provided suggestions for the inclusion of aerobic dance into physical education lessons and into others spheres of school activities. In the empirical part, we obtained results from 24 pupils, which in the school year 2015 / 2016 attended 5 th grade in elementary school Osnovna šola Bičevje in Ljubljana.
