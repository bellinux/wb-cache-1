5|$|Madagascar {{not only}} {{contains}} two radically different climatic zones, the rainforests {{of the east}} and the dry regions of the west, but also swings from extended drought to cyclone-generated floods. These climatic <b>and</b> <b>geographical</b> challenges, along with poor soils, low plant productivity, wide ranges of ecosystem complexity, and a lack of regularly fruiting trees (such as fig trees) have driven the evolution of lemurs' immense morphological and behavioral diversity. Their survival has required the ability to endure the persistent extremes, not yearly averages.|$|E
5|$|Phylogenetic {{analyses}} {{based on}} 16S ribosomal DNA suggest that S.iniae {{is closely related}} to other streptococcal pathogens of humans and animals. Specifically, it is clustered in the pyogenic group, along with other pathogenic streptococci such as S.pyogenes, S.agalactiae, S.uberis, S.canis, S.porcinus, S.phocae, and S.intestinalis. Of these related species, it is most closely related to S. porcinus. Genomic restriction fragment analysis of diverse host <b>and</b> <b>geographical</b> panels of S.iniae isolates has shown common profiles between virulent fish and human strains, though multiple pulsed field gel electrophoresis patterns have been identified among human isolates.|$|E
5|$|The AFL was {{confined}} to an enclave around the capital during the conflict, and did not play a significant part in the fighting. Elections in July 1997 finally brought Taylor to power.

5|$|The Alliance {{was formed}} in 1994, taking its initial member clubs from the West Midlands (Regional) League and the Midland Football Combination, which had existed since before the Second World War, having {{originally}} been formed as the Birmingham & District League and the Worcestershire Combination respectively.

5|$|After World War I the Liberal Party {{began to}} disintegrate. As the Liberals {{splintered}} Labour emerged {{to become the}} party of progressive politics in Scotland, gaining a solid following among working classes of the urban lowlands, {{and as a result}} the Unionists were able to gain most of the votes of the middle classes, who now feared Bolshevik revolution, setting the social <b>and</b> <b>geographical</b> electoral pattern in Scotland that would last until the late 20th century. With all the main parties committed to the Union new nationalist and independent political groupings began to emerge, including the National Party of Scotland in 1928 and Scottish Party in 1930. They joined together to form the Scottish National Party (SNP) in 1934 with the goal of creating an independent Scotland, but it enjoyed little electoral success in the Westminster system.|$|E

5|$|Borchgrevink's {{expedition}} objectives comprised commercial, scientific <b>and</b> <b>geographical</b> goals. He considered {{forming a}} company to exploit the extensive guano deposits that he had observed during his 1894–95 voyage, but this came to nothing. In numerous addresses to scientific societies, he stressed the extent of work that could {{be carried out by}} a resident expedition, including the possibility of establishing the location of the South Magnetic Pole. The team of scientists that Borchgrevink appointed, though inexperienced, covered a wide range of disciplines—magnetism, meteorology, biology, zoology, taxidermy and cartography. Borchgrevink also hoped that the expedition's scientific achievements could be matched by spectacular geographical discoveries and journeys, even perhaps an attempt on the geographical South Pole itself. With no knowledge of the continent's geography, he was unaware that the site of the base at Cape Adare would rule out any serious exploration of the Antarctic interior.|$|E
5|$|Golf {{has been}} {{prominent}} in England; {{due in part}} to its cultural <b>and</b> <b>geographical</b> ties to Scotland, the home of Golf. There are both professional tours for men and women, in two main tours: the PGA and the European Tour. England has produced grand slam winners: Cyril Walker, Tony Jacklin, Nick Faldo, and Justin Rose in the men's and Laura Davies, Alison Nicholas, and Karen Stupples in the women's. The world's oldest golf tournament, and golf's first major, is The Open Championship, played both in England and Scotland. The biennial golf competition, the Ryder Cup, is named after English businessman Samuel Ryder who sponsored the event and donated the trophy. Nick Faldo is the most successful Ryder Cup player ever, having won the most points (25) of any player on either the European or US teams.|$|E

5|$|In February 2017, UBS Group AG and the Northern Trust Corporation, an American {{international}} financial services company, announced an agreement for {{the acquisition of}} UBS Asset Management's fund administration servicing units in Luxembourg and Switzerland.

At the end of the transaction, expected for the second half of 2017, the American company will administrate a total of CHF420 billion in assets. UBS Asset Management will continue anyway to offer Management Company, White Labelling and Representative Services to its clients. Ulrich Körner, president of the UBS Asset Management, affirms that the continuous transformation of their platform is due to a major efficiency, effectiveness <b>and</b> <b>geographical</b> dislocation of the services offered by the bank.|$|E
5|$|In January 1917, Crawford {{successfully}} {{applied to}} join the RFC as an observer with the 23rd Squadron, which flew over enemy lines to make observations and draw maps. On his maiden flight, the German Army opened fire on his aircraft, and his right foot was pierced by bullets and badly injured. To recuperate, he spent time at various hospitals in France and England before {{being sent to the}} RFC Auxiliary Hospital at the Heligan estate in Cornwall. During this time in England he spent a weekend at Wells's home in Dunmow, Essex, embracing the latter's desire for a united world government and the idea that writing about global history was a contribution to that cause. While at Heligan, Crawford began work on a book, Man and his Past, in which he examined a broad sweep of human history from an archaeological <b>and</b> <b>geographical</b> perspective.|$|E
5|$|Rasmussen's {{recent work}} has {{concentrated}} on further large-scale collaborations {{with the same}} group of institutions studying global patterns in biodiversity. A survey of species richness <b>and</b> <b>geographical</b> range size did not show the decrease in range size from temperate regions to the tropics that had been previously assumed; although that pattern was largely true in the northern hemisphere, it did not appear to apply in the southern hemisphere. Research evaluating the relationship between extinction and human impact showed that, after controlling for species richness, the best predictors of the global pattern of extinction risk are measures of human impact, with ecological factors being of secondary importance. An examination of the distribution of rare and threatened vertebrate species, showed differing patterns for bird, mammal and amphibian species, which has consequences for hotspot-based conservation strategies.|$|E
