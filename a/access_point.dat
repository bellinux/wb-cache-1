In this paper, we present an active measurement method to determine the maximum saturation throughput of wireless LAN <b>access</b> <b>points.</b> The saturation throughput is achieved when there always is a frame ready to transmit, and it reaches the maximum for optimal transmission conditions. We use the proposed method to measure and analyze the performance of five IEEE 802. 11 b <b>access</b> <b>points.</b> The results show {{the strength of our}} method and identify performance characteristics of commercial <b>access</b> <b>points.</b> The analysis produces the following results. The maximum saturation throughput shows significant differences between models. Increasing the offered load to the <b>access</b> <b>point’s</b> Ethernet interface does not always increase the throughput; a few <b>access</b> <b>points</b> present a downlink throughput reduction when the offered load exceeds their bridging capabilities. Some <b>access</b> <b>points</b> exhibit better performance in certain orientations. Index terms—measurement, throughput, wireless LAN A...|$|R

When the mobile <b>access</b> <b>points</b> decode their received packets jointly, the optimal configuration {{appears to have a}} phase transition. Specifically, in order to maximize throughput, the coverage areas of the mobile <b>access</b> <b>points</b> should be completely overlapped when SNR is smaller than a threshold and disjoint otherwise...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{management}} of the <b>access</b> <b>points</b> {{in the establishment of}} the current wireless local area network is inde-pendent and scattered. The builder must log into the <b>access</b> <b>points</b> with the artificial method to set the identification, the operating channel and the authentication code. The client stations have to scan each channel for finding out the pre-set identification and then cooperating the process of the authentication for the access network. These processes may take several seconds and greatly degrade the Internet experience, especially for the users who frequently move among different coverage of <b>access</b> <b>points.</b> Additionally, if users desire high throughput and ubiquitous network accessed by distributing high-density <b>access</b> <b>points,</b> the performance of whole network does not grow as expected due to the ill {{management of}} in-dependent <b>access</b> <b>points.</b> In this paper, we extend the software-defined network (SDN) into the access network so that ac-cess points are managed by a central controller to deal with the issues, such as load balance, interference of channel allo-cation and handover. After the users can register an account and select the configuration for the server in advance, the configuration of the group can be directly adopted to enter the network. The server can create its special virtual <b>access</b> <b>points</b> in the neighboring <b>access</b> <b>points,</b> and then directly provide the service of the client side. When the client side moves, the virtual <b>access</b> <b>points</b> will move into other tangible <b>access</b> <b>points</b> with the moving of the client sides.
