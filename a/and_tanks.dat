5|$|The Germans finally flanked the American {{forces at}} dusk, {{capturing}} them. Only one American, a forward artillery observer, was killed, while 14 were wounded: German casualties totaled 92. The Germans paused, believing the woods {{were filled with}} more Americans <b>and</b> <b>tanks.</b> Only when SS-Standartenführer Joachim Peiper and his Panzer tanks arrived at midnight, twelve hours behind schedule, did the Germans learn the nearby woods were empty.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Stalingrad Front {{forces were}} subject to heavy bombardment, making {{mobilization}} more difficult. The 38 engineer battalions allocated to the front were responsible for ferrying ammunition, personnel <b>and</b> <b>tanks</b> across the Volga River while carrying out minor reconnaissance along sections of the front which were to be the breakthrough points of the impending offensive. In three weeks the Red Army transported around 111,000 soldiers, 420 tanks and 556 artillery pieces across the Volga.|$|E
5|$|The attacking force {{included}} JNA soldiers conscripted {{from across}} Yugoslavia, {{members of the}} TO, Chetniks (Serbian nationalist paramilitaries), local Serb militiamen and units of the Yugoslav Navy and the Yugoslav Air Force. At their peak, the Yugoslav and Serb forces {{in the vicinity of}} Vukovar numbered about 36,000. They were equipped with heavy artillery, rockets <b>and</b> <b>tanks</b> and supported by aircraft and naval vessels on the Danube.|$|E

5|$|The poor {{condition}} of the Betelgeuse for which its operator, Total S.A., was to blame: Immediately before the incident, the vessel's hull <b>and</b> <b>tanks</b> were cracked, corroded, and leaking. The 11-year-old vessel had been worked hard and {{was at the end}} of her service life.|$|E
5|$|A {{fusible plug}} is a {{threaded}} metal cylinder usually of bronze, brass or gunmetal, with a tapered hole drilled completely through its length. This hole is sealed {{with a metal}} {{of low melting point}} that flows away if a pre-determined, high temperature is reached. The initial use of the fusible plug was as a safety precaution against low water levels in steam engine boilers, but later applications extended its use to other closed vessels, such as air conditioning systems <b>and</b> <b>tanks</b> for transporting corrosive or liquefied petroleum gasses.|$|E
5|$|At 21:50 the British {{artillery}} opened fire, and the Germans {{responded with}} their own artillery and mortars which forced most of the British to take cover, for the next fifteen minutes, until a lull in the German fire allowed them to continue. In the lead 'C' Company had crossed the start line at 22:00, however all its officers and the company sergeant major (CSM) became casualties and a senior non-commissioned officer took command of the company. They continued to advance through the artillery and mortar bombardment, guided towards their objective by tracer rounds from the Hussars tanks. Repeatedly hit by the artillery <b>and</b> <b>tanks,</b> Bréville was in flames {{by the time the}} company's fifteen survivors reached the village.|$|E

5|$|By the {{following}} day, Mickl's kampfgruppe was deployed {{on the high}} ground {{on either side of}} the airfield at Sidi Rezegh. That afternoon, British armoured cars <b>and</b> <b>tanks</b> appeared, and Mickl's force was hard-pressed to hold its positions barring the British approach to Tobruk from the south and south-east, as little tank support was available. In the face of a superior force, Mickl's kampfgruppe fought hard in what became known as the Battle of Sidi Rezegh, with their commander often forward rallying his troops, and in the thick of counter-attacks launched to regain ground. Mickl and around 800 of his troops were captured by elements of the New Zealand Division on 26 November 1941, the captured troops being mainly from the Afrika Regiment.|$|E
5|$|Despite his ongoing {{research}} in Guiana, what Beebe desired most was {{to return to}} the Galápagos, this time with a properly fitted-out scientific research vessel that possessed the ability to dredge animals from beneath the ocean. In 1925, Beebe set out on a second Galápagos expedition, backed by Williams and several other donors. His ship for this expedition was the Arcturus, a steam yacht considerably larger than the Noma that was capable of being at sea for extended periods of time. The Arcturus was outfitted with Beebe's pulpit and boom walk from the Noma, as well as cages <b>and</b> <b>tanks</b> for live animals, chemicals and vials to preserve dead ones, and a darkroom for developing film and studying the bioluminescent animals they hoped to encounter.|$|E
5|$|For another week, North Korean {{divisions}} launched all {{the troops}} {{they had in}} massed attacks against the ROK and US lines. Their attacks, which usually occurred at night and were supported by armor and artillery, advanced with infantry <b>and</b> <b>tanks</b> in close support of one another. Each North Korean attack ran into well-established UN lines, where US tanks, mines and entrenched infantry were positioned to counter them. Strikes by US aircraft ravaged the attacking North Koreans. The fighting was fierce with many casualties on both sides, particularly where the North and South Koreans fought one another. The repeated attacks eventually broke and pushed back the North Korean forces. They continued their push against the Pusan Perimeter until they were outflanked in the Battle of Inchon.|$|E

5|$|For the Germans, {{the battle}} was the final {{strategic}} offensive {{that they were able}} to launch on the Eastern Front. As the Allied invasion of Sicily began Adolf Hitler was forced to divert troops training in France to meet the Allied threats in the Mediterranean, rather than use them as a strategic reserve for the Eastern Front. Germany's extensive loss of men <b>and</b> <b>tanks</b> ensured that the victorious Soviet Red Army enjoyed the strategic initiative for the remainder of the war.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} two weeks, the outnumbered Berryforce {{attempted}} to retake the strategically important town in the Battle of Merdjayoun. His first attempt was a failure. After carrying out a personal reconnaissance on 18 June, Berryman tried again. This time his attack was halted by staunch defence by the French Foreign Legion <b>and</b> <b>tanks.</b> Berryman then tried a different approach. Instead of attempting to capture the town, he seized high ground overlooking the French supply lines. Faced with being cut off, the French withdrew from the town. Berryforce was then dissolved and Berryman returned to his role as commander of the 7th Division artillery.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, {{following}} the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, 244 vehicles of the Czechoslovak Army were {{seized by the}} Germans where they were known as the L.T.M.35 until January 1940. In German service, they were used as substitutes for the Panzerkampfwagen III medium tank. They {{were assigned to the}} Panzer Battalion (Panzerabteilung) 65 (39) of the 1st Light (leichte) Division and the independent Panzer-Regiment 11 (81) where they participated in the Invasion of Poland. 77 of these were lost during the campaign, mostly due to mechanical breakdowns, but only 7 of these were irreparable. From 1940 on, there had not been any spare parts available <b>and</b> <b>tanks</b> had to be completely rebuilt to remain operational.|$|E

5|$|Indeed, the {{evacuation}} of casualties and the resupply of ammunition at times proved problematic, and heavy shelling and sniper fire disrupted stretcher parties and porters {{on a number of}} occasions, resulting in the forward companies running short of ammunition. Meanwhile, the quality of support given to the British and Australian infantry by the artillery <b>and</b> <b>tanks</b> was of a high standard and proved a critical factor. Indeed, the tanks had often operated in terrain to which they were unsuited, while the New Zealand gunners had fired over 50,000 rounds in direct support of 3 RAR, blistering the paint off the barrels of their guns. Air support, including that provided by the South African Mustangs, had been important throughout.|$|E
5|$|Levels {{consist of}} several missions, {{which are based}} around the {{destruction}} of enemy weapons and installations, as well as rescuing hostages or prisoners of war, or capturing enemy personnel. The helicopter is armed with machine guns, more powerful Hydra rockets and yet more deadly Hellfire missiles. The more powerful the weapon, the fewer can be carried: the player must choose an appropriate weapon for each situation. Enemy weapons range from armoured cars to artillery <b>and</b> <b>tanks.</b>|$|E

Courses have a predefined path that racers must follow: {{if a player}} leaves the defined route for too long they are {{sent back to the}} track. Many have obstacles such as cereal boxes on breakfast tables, and pencil sharpeners on desks.|$|E
