5|$|It is {{also said}} that on the {{southern}} side of the track stood cliffs that overlooked the pass. However, <b>a</b> <b>glance</b> at any photograph of the pass shows there are no cliffs, only steep slopes covered in thorny bushes and trees. Although no obstacle to individuals, such terrain would not be passable by an army and its baggage train.|$|E

5|$|A few early sets {{experimented with}} {{alternate}} art for cards. However, Wizards {{came to believe}} that this impeded easy recognition of a card and that having multiple versions caused confusion when identifying a card at <b>a</b> <b>glance.</b> Consequently, alternate art is now only used sparingly and mostly for promotional cards. When older cards are reprinted in new sets, however, Wizards of the Coast has guaranteed that they will be printed with new art to make the older cards more collectible.|$|E

5|$|Eye {{color is}} {{considered}} a subset of coloring, and coat color definitions often include standards for the eyes, as many genes which control eye color will also affect the coat color or vice versa. The American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association (AFRMA) lists black, pink, ruby, and odd-eyed (two different-colored eyes) as possible eye colors, depending on the variety of rat shown. Ruby refers to eyes which at <b>a</b> <b>glance</b> appear black but which are on closer observation a deep, dark red.|$|E

She helps the mercenary Patrice (Ola Rapace) assassinate an art dealer by leading the target {{in front of}} a window. Bond confronts Patrice about his affiliations, but is unable to coerce any answers before the assassin falls out of a window to his death. Sévérine and Bond exchange <b>a</b> <b>glance</b> before she leaves the room. Bond takes the payment intended for Patrice, a token for a casino in Macau.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} is {{cast in the}} Classical Revival architectural style and contains elements common to that style. Stained glass, columns and a pediment are among the more noticeable features at <b>a</b> <b>glance.</b> The rear facade of the {{building is}} designed to resemble a temple and also features stained glass windows. A stone porte-cochere covers the rear driveway. Inside the building's third floor courtroom is more stained glass, {{in the form of}} a skylight. During the early 1980s a made for television movie had scenes filmed in the DeKalb County Courthouse's courtroom.|$|E
5|$|The demon Tarakasura {{had created}} havoc in the universe, {{and only the}} son of god Shiva could slay him, but Shiva had turned to ascetic ways {{after the death of his}} first wife, Sati. Kama was thus {{instructed}} by the gods to make Shiva fall in love again. Kama went to Mount Kailash with Rati and Madhu or Vasanta ("Spring"), and shot his love-arrows at Shiva (in another version of the legend, Kama entered Shiva's mind) and invoked desire. Wounded by Kama's arrows, Shiva becomes attracted to Parvati, the reincarnation of Sati, but agitated, burns Kama by <b>a</b> <b>glance</b> of his third eye.|$|E

5|$|Another {{example of}} his {{leadership}} and his coup d'œil, {{the ability to see}} at <b>a</b> <b>glance</b> what needed to be done, occurred after the Battle of Kolin. The loss at Kolin forced the King to lift the siege at Prague. The King's brother, Augustus William, took command of the army and ordered the retreat from Prague. Seydlitz was attached to the advanced corps of Karl Christoph von Schmettau in a brigade of ten squadrons. As Seydlitz's wing entered Lusatia, near the town of Zittau, the Austrians were present in force, and Seydlitz with his squadrons were trapped in the town. Tricking the Austrians into thinking his troop was a foraging party, his cavalry burst on the Austrian cavalry before they could climb into their saddles. Seydlitz led his cavalry in an escape, in close column, and was quickly out of sight.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} over after the lunch break, with the score at 87, Bradman was caught {{for the third}} {{consecutive}} time in the series by Hutton off Bedser at short fine leg. Hutton had dropped Bradman in the same position when he was on 13. Including a county match against Yorkshire, it was the fourth time Hutton had caught Bradman in the leg trap from <b>a</b> <b>glance.</b> According to O'Reilly, this was evidence that Bradman was no longer the player he was before World War II, as he had been unable to disperse the close-catching fielders by counter-attacking, before eventually being dismissed. O'Reilly said {{this was the first time}} Bradman had fallen to the same trap three times in succession.|$|E
5|$|From {{the work}} of Heaviside (1887) it had become clear that the {{performance}} of telegraph lines, and most especially telephone lines, could be improved {{by the addition of}} inductance to the line. George Campbell at AT implemented this idea (1899) by inserting loading coils at intervals along the line. Campbell found that as well as the desired improvements to the line's characteristics in the passband there was also a definite frequency beyond which signals could not be passed without great attenuation. This was a result of the loading coils and the line capacitance forming a low-pass filter, an effect that is only apparent on lines incorporating lumped components such as the loading coils. This naturally led Campbell (1910) to produce a filter with ladder topology, <b>a</b> <b>glance</b> at the circuit diagram of this filter is enough to see its relationship to a loaded transmission line. The cut-off phenomenon is an undesirable side-effect as far as loaded lines are concerned but for telephone FDM filters it is precisely what is required. For this application, Campbell produced band-pass filters to the same ladder topology by replacing the inductors and capacitors with resonators and anti-resonators respectively. Both the loaded line and FDM were of great benefit economically to AT and this led to fast development of filtering from this point onwards.|$|E
