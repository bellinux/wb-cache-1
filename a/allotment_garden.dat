Using archive material and newspaper reports the role of the <b>allotment</b> <b>gardens</b> within wider issues of urban social reform is explored.

In this manner, the place of <b>allotment</b> <b>gardens</b> as a means of understanding wider urban life in Britain can be reexamined.

50|$|An <b>allotment</b> <b>garden</b> (British English), {{often called}} simply an allotment, or a {{community}} garden (North America) is {{a plot of}} land made available for individual, non-commercial gardening or growing food plants. Such plots are formed by subdividing {{a piece of land}} into a few or up to several hundred land parcels that are assigned to individuals or families. Such parcels are cultivated individually, contrary to other community garden types where the entire area is tended collectively by a group of people. In countries that do not use the term <b>allotment</b> (<b>garden),</b> a community garden can refer to individual small garden plots as well as to a single, large piece of land gardened collectively by a group of people. The term victory garden is also still sometimes used, especially when a community garden dates back to World War II or I.|$|E

Discussions with the literature also includes related phenomenon of allotment gardeners - second home. In the theoretical part, self-supply is mentioned such as a certain lifestyle. This chapter outlines not only the development and trends in self-supply (fruits and vegetables), but also overall trends in food consumption.

50|$|In 2003, {{the first}} <b>allotment</b> <b>garden</b> of the Philippines was {{established}} in Cagayan de Oro City, Northern Mindanao {{as part of a}} European Union funded project. Meanwhile, {{with the assistance of the}} German Embassy in Manila and several private donors from Germany, this number has grown to five self-sustaining gardens located in different urban areas of the city, enabling a total of 55 urban poor families the legal access to land for food production. Further four allotment gardens, two of them within the premises of public elementary schools are presently being set up for additional 36 families using the asset-based community development approach. Some of the gardeners belong to the poorest in the city, the garbage pickers of the city’s landfill site. Aside from different vegetables, the gardeners grow also herbs and tropical fruits. In some gardens, small animals are kept and fish ponds are maintained to avail the gardeners of additional protein sources for the daily dietary needs. Each <b>allotment</b> <b>garden</b> has a compost heap where biodegradable wastes from the garden as well as from the neighboring households are converted into organic fertilizer, thus contributing to the integrated solid waste management program of the city. Further, all gardens are equipped with so-called urine-diverting ecological sanitation toilets similar to practices in Danish allotment gardens described by Bregnhøj et al. (2003).|$|E
