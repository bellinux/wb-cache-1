40|$|Background and Aims: There is wide {{variation}} in depth of brachial plexus in patient population at supraclavicular region. We plan {{to find the}} depth of the <b>corner</b> <b>pocket</b> and correlate it with age, weight, height and body mass index (BMI). Material and Methods: After approval from Ethics Committee, right-sided supraclavicular region of volunteers was scanned. Once an optimal image, which included subclavian artery, pleura, first rib and nerve bundles, was obtained, the "corner pocket" was kept {{in the middle of the}} screen and the image was frozen. Depth of the <b>corner</b> <b>pocket</b> from the skin was measured. Thereafter longest distance (LD) approximating needle trajectory was calculated. The Pearson correlation was used to calculate the relation between these two distances and various predictors such as weight, height, and BMI. Results: Mean shortest distance that is, vertical distance from skin to <b>corner</b> <b>pocket</b> for all volunteers was found to be 1. 7 ± 0. 8 cm and the mean LD that is, distance traveled by needle entering 1 cm from the edge of foot process to the <b>corner</b> <b>pocket</b> in an in-plane approach was 3. 7 ± 0. 2 cm. We did not find any significant correlation between age, height versus measured distances. However, significant correlation (0. 11) was found between weights, BMI versus two lengths. Conclusion: Prescanning of supraclavicular region for estimating depth of <b>corner</b> <b>pocket</b> should be done before choosing an appropriate size needle. Furthermore, the needle should not be advanced more than the predicted <b>corner</b> <b>pocket</b> depth...|$|R

5000|$|Carrom {{boards are}} {{available}} in various board sizes and <b>corner</b> <b>pocket</b> sizes. There are smaller boards and boards with larger pockets. Boards with larger pockets are used by beginners for easier game play.

On boards with larger pockets, {{it is possible to}} pocket the striker, resulting in a [...] "" [...] as in Pool. This results in a [...] "due."

50|$|The game {{is played}} on a pool or snooker table (usually the latter, when available) using the cue ball (the shooter ball), and one object ball (most {{commonly}} a striped ball since it is easiest to determine {{if it is in}} motion).

2500|$|The 35th {{and final}} frame lasted 68 minutes. In that frame Davis led 62–44, {{with only the}} last four [...] on the table, worth 22 points. Taylor stayed in {{contention}} by potting a very difficult brown from long range, followed by a tricky blue and pink. This meant that, for the first time, the title would be decided on the very last ball, the black. Taylor tried to double it into the left middle pocket; he missed, but the ball rebounded to a safe position {{at the top of}} the table. Davis then played an excellent safety shot, putting the black near the middle of the baulk (bottom) cushion and leaving the cue ball near the right-hand cushion, a little above the <b>corner</b> <b>pocket.</b> Taylor then half-attempted to double the black into the top-left <b>corner</b> <b>pocket</b> but missed, with the black rebounding up and down the table, eventually sneaking past the left middle pocket to a relatively safe position. As the applause died down from the audience, veteran commentator Ted Lowe remarked, [...] "I'm sure Dennis wouldn't mind my saying he chanced his arm, and it's come out lucky". Davis's next attempt went awry, as a double-kiss left Taylor with a reasonable middle-distance pot to the green <b>corner</b> <b>pocket.</b> However, he snatched somewhat at the shot and missed the pot ("the biggest shot of his life", as commentator Jim Meadowcroft described it). Taylor thought, in his disappointment, that he had left Davis a moderately easy cut on the black into the top pocket from fairly close range. However, that pot was at a thinner angle than Taylor had anticipated as he tried to judge where the balls would finish up.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{dollar bill}} shot": Introduced into {{competition}} by Paul Gerni, this shot uses a banknote, typically a US$100 bill, {{placed on the}} short rail near the <b>corner</b> <b>pocket</b> as a target landing zone. The cue ball is banked off of eight or nine cushions and should land with the ball's edge over the banknote. This shot {{is used as a}} tiebreaker on Trick Shot Magic with the competitor landing closest to the bill winning the match.|$|R
5000|$|The {{object of}} the game is to finger-flick a {{comparatively}} heavy disk, called a striker, shooter or pitch, such that it contacts lighter object disks and propels them into one of four <b>corner</b> <b>pockets.</b> The pieces come in two sets, usually white and black, denoting the two players (or, in doubles play, teams). An additional piece is colored (red and green are common) and called the [...] "poison", which is the puck equivalent of the eight ball in pool games.|$|R

5000|$|The {{length of}} the pool table will {{typically}} {{be a function of}} space, with many homeowners purchasing an 8 ft table as a compromise. Full-size pool tables are 4.5 by 9 ft (interior dimensions). High-quality tables have a [...] made of thick slate, in three pieces to prevent warping and changes due to temperature and humidity. Smaller bar tables are most commonly made with a single piece of slate. Pocket billiards tables of all types normally have six pockets, three on each side (four <b>corner</b> <b>pockets,</b> and two side or middle pockets).|$|R

Tom hits the balls in succession with his cue; Jerry hangs onto the cue tip, but Tom rubs chalk on Jerry and shoots him at the 8-ball.|$|R
50|$|The game {{is played}} mostly in {{southern}} England and Jersey on a special table without side and <b>corner</b> <b>pockets,</b> but with 9 scoring holes in the playing surface. On the playfield are normally placed three skittles--guarding the highest scoring holes (the two 50 point holes and the 200 point hole). The aim {{of the game is}} to score as many points as possible by potting balls down the holes before either the time runs out or a skittle is knocked over. The last ball can only be potted by getting it into the 100 or 200 point hole after bouncing off one cushion.|$|R
5000|$|The game {{is played}} on a board of {{lacquered}} plywood, normally 28 inches square (71 cm). The edges of the playing surface are bounded by raised wooden sides. The object {{of the game is}} to strike a wooden disc such that it contacts lighter discs and propels them into one of four <b>corner</b> <b>pockets.</b> These pockets are usually larger than those on Indian carrom boards. The playing pieces come in two colours denoting the two players (or teams, in doubles play). An additional piece is coloured red (or other unique colour) and called the [...] "queen" [...] or [...] "king".|$|R

50|$|Jerry then dives into a <b>corner</b> <b>pocket.</b> Tom gropes {{through the}} pocket to find Jerry, but grabs his own tail, pulling {{himself through the}} pockets. Tom then sticks a hose down the holes, {{sweeping}} Jerry up, and swings a mechanical bridge to hit Jerry, but Jerry, latching onto the end, climbs up onto a wire and steals the bridge. Jerry uses the bridge as a balancing stick, but Tom throws two cues at Jerry. The first hits the wire dead centre and shreds in two, but the second scrapes Jerry's rear to an alarming red. Angry, Jerry then shoots the mechanical bridge into Tom's mouth.|$|R
50|$|Making the ball: You score a {{point by}} making the object ball {{in one of the}} two <b>corner</b> <b>pockets</b> on your opponent's (i.e., the opposite) side of the table or by banking the ball into a side pocket or back into one of your own pockets. If, upon {{striking}} the object ball, it goes either directly into a side pocket or the pockets on your own side of the table then you lose the point (note: toilet paper to block the side pockets is an acceptable variation). If the cue ball goes into ANY pocket on your throw, you lose the point—with one exception, the shuck, explained below.|$|R
5000|$|... "The snake shot": Fifteen object {{balls are}} placed across the table. The 15 ball {{is the first}} and it is placed 6 inches away from the <b>corner</b> <b>pocket.</b> Each {{successive}} ball is placed 3 inches behind the previous one in a winding chain. Each combination of balls beginning with the 1 and the 2 should be aligned so they aim toward the next ball in the chain. The cue ball must be set up in position to make a straight line with the first two-ball combination. When the 1 ball is hit it should cause a chain reaction as each two-ball set hits each other.|$|R
