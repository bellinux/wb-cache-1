5|$|Certain species form {{communities}} called microatolls, {{which are}} colonies whose top is dead <b>and</b> <b>mostly</b> {{above the water}} line, but whose perimeter is mostly submerged and alive.

Fossilized microatolls can also be dated using Radiocarbon dating. Such methods can help to reconstruct Holocene sea levels.|$|E
