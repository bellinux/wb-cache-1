5|$|Actual or {{impending}} airway obstruction is {{a common}} indication for intubation of the trachea. Life-threatening airway obstruction may occur when a foreign body becomes lodged in the airway; this is especially common in infants <b>and</b> <b>toddlers.</b> Severe blunt or penetrating injury to the face or neck may be accompanied by swelling and an expanding hematoma, or injury to the larynx, trachea or bronchi. Airway obstruction is also common in people who have suffered smoke inhalation or burns within or near the airway or epiglottitis. Sustained generalized seizure activity and angioedema are other common causes of life-threatening airway obstruction which may require tracheal intubation to secure the airway.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to {{conversations and}} {{engaging}} in conversation with others help school-age children develop vocabulary. Fast mapping {{is the process of}} learning a new concept upon a single exposure and is used in word learning not only by infants <b>and</b> <b>toddlers,</b> but by preschool children and adults as well. This principle is very useful for word learning in conversational settings, as words tend not to be explained explicitly in conversation, but may be referred to frequently throughout the span of a conversation.|$|E
5|$|Children with RAD are {{presumed to}} have grossly {{disturbed}} internal working models of relationships {{that may lead}} to interpersonal and behavioral difficulties in later life. There are few studies of long-term effects, and {{there is a lack of}} clarity about the presentation of the disorder beyond the age of five years. However, the opening of orphanages in Eastern Europe following the end of the Cold War in the early-1990s provided opportunities for research on infants <b>and</b> <b>toddlers</b> brought up in very deprived conditions. Such research broadened the understanding of the prevalence, causes, mechanism and assessment of disorders of attachment and led to efforts from the late-1990s onwards to develop treatment and prevention programs and better methods of assessment. Mainstream theorists in the field have proposed that a broader range of conditions arising from problems with attachment should be defined beyond current classifications.|$|E

5|$|Sesame Street {{has been}} used to test the {{attention}} span of infants <b>and</b> <b>toddlers.</b> In 2004, children from three months to two years were shown Sesame Street clips and a group of computer-generated black and white patterns. Their attention spans, as determined by the duration of time they looked at the stimuli, significantly increased at six to twenty-four months, but only for the Sesame Street material. A study conducted in 2006 found that infants' attention span increased more when they were presented with video clips than with still images of the same stimuli, supporting the idea that movement helps young infants gain more information from the world around them. The evidence showed that attention span depended both on age and the on the type of stimuli children viewed. The time they looked at stimuli decreased for all types of stimuli from fourteen to twenty-six weeks, but the time they looked at it increased depending on the stimuli. When older infants (age fourteen weeks to twelve months) looked at Sesame Street materials and human faces, their attention increased compared to other types of stimuli.|$|E

25|$|Common {{constitutional}} {{signs and}} symptoms of the HFMD include fever, nausea, vomiting, feeling tired, generalized discomfort, loss of appetite, and irritability in infants <b>and</b> <b>toddlers.</b> Skin lesions frequently develop {{in the form of a}} rash of flat discolored spots and bumps which may be followed by vesicular sores with blisters on palms of the hands, soles of the feet, buttocks, and sometimes on the lips. The rash is rarely itchy for children, but can be extremely itchy for adults. Painful facial ulcers, blisters, or lesions may also develop in or around the nose or mouth. HFMD usually resolves on its own after 7–10 days. Most cases of the disease are relatively harmless, but complications including encephalitis, meningitis, and paralysis that mimics the neurological symptoms of polio can occur.|$|E

25|$|Masturbation among {{adolescents}} contributes to them developing {{a sense of}} mastery over sexual impulses, {{and it has a}} role in the physical and emotional development of prepubescents and pubescents. Babies <b>and</b> <b>toddlers</b> will play with their genitals {{in much the same way}} as they play with their ears or toes. If such play becomes all-consuming, it may be necessary to look for an underlying cause of this, such as the child being tense and in need of comfort, or that others may be overreacting and thus reinforcing the habit. It could be caused by a low-grade urinary tract or yeast infection, or the child may be overstimulated and in need of soothing, or indeed understimulated and bored. Alongside many other factors, such as medical evidence, age-inappropriate sexual knowledge, sexualized play or aggression, and precocious or seductive behavior, excessive masturbation may alternatively be an indicator of sexual abuse.|$|E
25|$|Kindergartens (幼稚園 yōchien), {{predominantly}} {{staffed by}} young female junior college graduates, are supervised by the Ministry of Education, {{but are not}} part of the official education system. The 58% of kindergartens that are private accounted for 77% of all children enrolled. In addition to kindergartens, there exists a well-developed system of government-supervised day-care centers (保育園 hoikuen), supervised by the Ministry of Labor. Whereas kindergartens follow educational aims, preschools are predominantly concerned with providing care for infants <b>and</b> <b>toddlers.</b> Just as there are public and private kindergartens, there are both public and privately run preschools. Together, these two kinds of institutions enroll well over 90 percent of all preschool-age children prior to their entrance into the formal system at first grade. The Ministry of Education's 1990 Course of Study for Preschools, which applies to both kinds of institutions, covers such areas as human relationships, health, environment, language, and expression. Starting from March 2008 the new revision of curriculum guidelines for kindergartens as well as for preschools came into effect.|$|E

500|$|Physical context {{involves}} {{the presence of}} an object or action that is also the topic of conversation. With the use of physical context, the child is exposed to both the words and a visual reference of the word. This is frequently used with infants <b>and</b> <b>toddlers,</b> but can be very beneficial for school-age children, especially when learning rare or infrequently used words. Physical context may include props such as in toy play. When engaging in play with an adult, a child's vocabulary is developed through discussion of the toys, such as naming the object (e.g. [...] "dinosaur") or labeling it {{with the use of a}} rare word (e.g., stegosaurus). These sorts of interactions expose the child to words they may not otherwise encounter in day-to-day conversation.|$|E
500|$|Oobi was {{instrumental}} in growing the Noggin network's viewership. From 2003 to 2004, full-length episodes of the show (along with premieres of Miffy and Friends and Connie the Cow) were responsible for increasing Noggin's average daily viewers to 93,000 children in its key demographic of infants <b>and</b> <b>toddlers</b> (a 55 percent increase over its ratings the year before). The average number of viewers aged 2–5 watching Oobi increased by 43 percent {{during the same time}} period. The steady increase in ratings received coverage from Multichannel News author Mike Reynolds, who attributed Noggin's popularity to its [...] "breakout original series Oobi." [...] Its growing audience led Noggin to order a second set of full-length episodes. The premiere of the [...] "Uma Preschool!" [...] episode on September 6, 2004, posted a 2.35 Nielsen rating among the preschool age group, becoming the highest-rated premiere of a Noggin original series to that date.|$|E
500|$|The puppeteers' {{performances}} and the show's {{approach to teaching}} fundamental life skills have been praised by critics. Common Sense Media reviewer Andrea Graham gave the show a five-star review, writing that [...] "when it comes to preschool programming, Oobi really breaks the mold, succeeding in its simplicity." [...] The Coalition for Quality Children's Media wrote positively of Oobi, complimenting its concept and calling it [...] "thoroughly enjoyable" [...] and [...] "extremely well received." [...] Diana Dawson of the Herald-Journal found the show's old-fashioned look appealing, stating that [...] "in a world that too often forgets the innocent joy of playing kick-the-can and catching fireflies, there's something incredibly endearing about the bare-handed puppetry." [...] DVD Talk's Holly Ordway was unimpressed with the series' simplicity, but admitted in her review that it was [...] "a clever way to encourage kids to be imaginative." [...] Ryan Ball of Animation Magazine described the show as [...] "an offbeat new entry" [...] to Noggin's lineup, adding that [...] "the fact that all the characters are played by hands just adds to the quirkiness." [...] In 2010, Babble.com listed Oobi second on their list of top twelve television series for babies <b>and</b> <b>toddlers.</b>|$|E
