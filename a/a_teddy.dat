5|$|In the semi-finals, Juve's captain Antonio Conte met Edgar Davids' pass to give Juventus an away goal. United {{equalised}} in injury-time through Giggs, who converted a Beckham cross: <b>a</b> <b>Teddy</b> Sheringham goal a {{few minutes}} earlier had been disallowed. A draw meant that United either needed to win in Italy, or get a score-draw of 2–2 or greater.|$|E
5|$|In his {{subsequent}} statement Smith admitted to {{being at the}} Rainbow with Corcoran and a male friend, but claimed they were later separated {{when they went to}} another public house, the Kerryman, and the male friend was ejected. Smith said that he and Corcoran then went to Monte Carlo's, a nightclub in Handsworth, and that when they left some time later, Corcoran was confronted by a man he described as <b>a</b> <b>Teddy</b> Boy, with whom she had argued at the Kerryman. Smith said that the man became aggressive, so he asked Corcoran if she wanted to go home. Claiming that she told him she did not, he said he then left her.|$|E

5|$|Meeting Lennon {{had been}} a shock for Harry, as Lennon often dressed like <b>a</b> <b>Teddy</b> boy, and was a {{disruptive}} influence at the college. Despite his misgivings about Lennon, Harry introduced him to Sutcliffe, who was a small, softly-spoken and shy student, who had painted a portrait of Harry. The three often spent time together at the Ye Cracke pub in Rice Street, or {{on the top floor}} of the Jacaranda club (run by Williams, who later managed the Beatles). Harry met his then 16-year-old future wife-to-be, Virginia Sowry, at the club. Harry, Lennon, Sutcliffe and Rod Murray saw the poet Royston Ellis at Liverpool University in June 1960. Having been disappointed with Ellis' performance, Harry proposed the idea that they should call the assembled quartet of friends the Dissenters, and make Liverpool famous: Sutcliffe and Murray with their paintings, Harry's writing and Lennon's music.|$|E
5|$|On August 8, 2011, Rick Riordan {{released}} a video giving {{more information about}} the book and its characters. The video includes pictures of a black haired boy with a bow and arrow in his hands who is later revealed to be Frank Zhang, a blonde-haired boy holding <b>a</b> <b>teddy</b> bear later revealed as Octavian, a girl with black hair wearing gold armor and a purple cloak sitting on a throne flanked by a gold and a silver canine creature, both with red eyes, who was revealed on Rick Riordan's blog to be Reyna, and another girl riding a horse named Hazel Levesque. Along with this, two chapters were released prior to the book's launch: one was put on Riordan's website and another read out by Riordan on Percy's birthday, August 18.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens in}} a deserted, {{destroyed}} school hallway with Lee's character shown {{sitting on the}} ground. As the first verse begins, he slowly begins {{to stand up and}} makes his way through the hallway. The boy then sees a female teacher in a classroom who's stricken with fear and closes the door, realizing that the boy is the cause of the damage. As the boy makes his way outside the school building, a police car arrives and the teacher rushes outside to tell the policeman about the boy, who then quickly rides a bicycle home to pack his things. While at home, he sees a news report about the incident, causing him to quickly gather his things to flee. Several policemen then appear outside {{the front door of the}} boy's house, while he tries to escape through the back door. The boy realizes that the door is locked so he uses his telekinetic powers to grab the keys from the kitchen bench. The policemen then enter the house to find that the boy has escaped, but find <b>a</b> <b>teddy</b> bear and a plush frog floating in the air. The final scene shows the boy running away from a SWAT team in the woods. The boy is caught by one of the men who pushes him to the ground. The video ends with the boy using his supernatural powers once again to push the men away in a burst of power; this references how the boy destroyed the school in the first place, as he's in the same position he was in at the beginning of the video. The aftermath of the outburst in the end, however, remains unknown.|$|E

500|$|Starr has {{received}} praise from critics and movie industry professionals regarding his acting; director and producer Walter Shenson called him [...] "a superb actor, an absolute natural".

500|$|The {{scene when}} Walter pleads with Gus {{demonstrates}} the paternal sense of protectiveness Walter has developed for Jesse. During that scene, Walter tells Gus, [...] "You kill me, you have nothing. You kill Jesse, you don't have me." [...] Jesse is visibly {{moved by the}} statement, which Aaron Paul described as [...] "the first moment that Jesse realizes that Walt's loyalty is to Jesse." [...] "Box Cutter" [...] also illustrated Skyler's growing involvement in Walter's illegal activities through the subplot in which she lies to a locksmith to break into Walter's house, {{going so far as}} to use her baby as a prop in her facade. After Skyler breaks into Walter's apartment, she finds the plastic eyeball of <b>a</b> <b>teddy</b> bear that has been part of the series since the second season. The eye has long been used as a symbol to identify Walter's gradual descent into a life of crime, and Skyler's discovery of it symbolizes her own similar descent.|$|E
500|$|After dating {{for several}} months, Love and Cobain were married on Waikiki Beach in Honolulu, Hawaii on February 24, 1992. Love wore a satin and lace dress {{once owned by}} actress Frances Farmer, and Cobain wore plaid pajamas. Six months later, on August 18, the couple's only child, a daughter, Frances Bean Cobain, was born. In April 1994, Cobain died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in their Seattle home while Love was in rehab in Los Angeles. During their marriage, and after Cobain's death, Love became {{something}} of a hate-figure among some of Cobain's fans. In reflecting on their relationship, Love said: [...] "I think {{that it looked like}} it was headed for doom, but it didn't feel like it was headed for doom on a daily basis. We went mountain biking; we would go camping. We were damn normal." [...] After his cremation, Love divided portions of Cobain's ashes; she kept some in <b>a</b> <b>teddy</b> bear and some in an urn. Another portion of his ashes was taken by Love to the Namgyal Buddhist Monastery in Ithaca, New York in 1994, where they were ceremonially blessed by Buddhist monks and mixed into clay which was made into memorial sculptures.|$|E
500|$|Gaga also {{utilized}} the 3D game Minecraft {{in a sequence}} and enlisted Minecraft Youtuber SkyDoesMineCraft in a sequence which depicts the singer reviving famous {{men who have been}} dead. The artist had been a fan of the game since Martyn Littlewood of The Yogscast used it to create a parody of her 2011 single, [...] "Born This Way", which she appreciated. Minecraft and Lego were also used to create little items like fruits and chairs in the video. The 3D theme also expanded onto using artist Nathan Sawaya's Lego sculpture Yellow—which showed a man ripping his chest out—in a sequence showing Gaga's head being transposed on the artpiece. Sawaya recalled that Gaga had contacted him for collaborating on the music video. They mutually agreed on the idea of making art [...] "accessible" [...] and decided on the different sculptures to be created, including a duplicate of Yellow, without the head. Sawaya then traveled to Hearst Castle to install the art pieces for the shoot. Multiple designer dresses were also used in the video namely, a white ensemble with a giant headpiece by Jean Paul Gaultier, jeans by Versace, a red swimsuit by La Perla and a black one by Madrid label POL, jewelry from Lynn Ban, and custom made sandals form Ruthie Davis. The homicide scenes showed designs by Helen Yarmak, lace bodysuits by Somarta and Aturo Rios feathered headpiece. Designer Bea Szenfeld created a dress from paper resembling <b>a</b> <b>teddy</b> bear as well as other couture also. Finally, gold colored latex body suit created by Atsuko Kudo was also work by Gaga, as well as gold garments for her backup dancers.|$|E
