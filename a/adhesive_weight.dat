25|$|Varying {{adhesive}} weight: Use of {{the fuel}} and water {{for the purposes of}} <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> means that the <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> of the locomotive decreases as they are used up,which also typically makes the ride much more uncomfortable.|$|E
25|$|Although the J class {{produced}} the same nominal tractive effort as the K or N class, {{they had a}} slightly higher <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> (and as such a better factor of adhesion) and were permitted to haul heavier loads on gradients.

25|$|Running gear {{includes}} the brake gear, wheel sets, axleboxes, springing and the motion that includes connecting rods and valve gear. The {{transmission of the}} power from the pistons to the rails and the behaviour of the locomotive as a vehicle, being able to negotiate curves, points and irregularities in the track, is of paramount importance. Because reciprocating power has to be directly applied to the rail from 0rpm upwards, this creates the problem of adhesion of the driving wheels to the smooth rail surface. <b>Adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> is {{the portion of the}} locomotive's weight bearing on the driving wheels. This is made more effective if a pair of driving wheels is able {{to make the most of}} its axle load, i.e. its individual share of the <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight.</b> Locomotives with equalising beams connecting the ends of plate springs have often been deemed a complication, however locomotives fitted with the beams have usually been less prone to loss of traction due to wheel-slip.|$|E

25|$|With an {{axle load}} of , the AA {{had reached the}} design limits of size and power {{possible}} with a two coupled axle locomotive type with Victoria's relatively light track infrastructure. Its high tractive effort and limited <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> (due to axle load constraints and only two powered axles) combined to produce a less than ideal factor of adhesion of 3.5. Future VR locomotive designs were based on three or four coupled axles.|$|E
25|$|The Engerth design {{articulated}} the tender {{with the main}} locomotive frame, allowing some {{of the weight of}} the fuel and water to be carried on the driving wheels to improve adhesion. Because the tender was articulated, rather than directly attached to the frame, the locomotive could traverse relatively sharp curves, while still enjoying the advantage of the additional <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> gain. The original design also included an indirect drive from the main driving wheels to the wheels under the tender. This arrangement proved too complex to maintain and was dropped from the design.|$|E
25|$|The major {{disadvantage}} of a Garratt (shared with all tank engines) {{is that the}} <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> decreases as the water is used from the front tank and coal from the rear bunker. As the weight on the wheels decreases slipping occurs. To reduce wheelslip, a wagon containing water was attached behind the Garratt, and this practice also permitted the engine to operate over longer distances. The weight {{of the water in}} the locomotive's tank and weight of coal in the bunker (necessary for the factor of adhesion) was predicted in advance, and this problem was not normally an operational issue.|$|E

The strength of the bonded joints was evaluated through shear tests, using the procedures described in EN 13354 (2008). The increase in weight did not influence the results of shear strength, indicating the benefits in economic terms with the reduction in the consumption of adhesive. Joints glued with the wood species of Swartzia recurve with EPI adhesive, at the two weights have reached the minimum value of 2. 5 MPa concerning the lower 5 th percentile established by EN 13353 (2008).

50|$|The Skorpion was {{the result}} of an {{international}} collaboration, being conceived by British design firm Seymour Powell. The Skorpion's engine, electrics and switches came from the Yamaha XT660, with Italian Grimeca parts including brakes, forks and rear suspension. The strong tubular beam frame was unusual in using aircraft <b>adhesives</b> to save <b>weight</b> but production versions came with a welded frame. Skorpions were well-specified as standard, with adjustable bars and footpegs, alloy wheels, stainless steel silencer, rear hugger fender, and braided brake lines. Some early Skorpions were fitted with an Austrian Rotax engine.|$|R
25|$|The {{weight of}} the {{locomotive}} is roughly proportional to the power output; {{the number of axles}} required is determined by this weight divided by the axleload limit for the trackage where the locomotive is to be used. The number of driving wheels is derived from the <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> in the same manner, leaving the remaining axles to be accounted for by the leading and trailing bogies. Passenger locomotives conventionally had two-axle leading bogies for better guidance at speed; on the other hand, the vast increase {{in the size of the}} grate and firebox in the 20th century meant that a trailing bogie was called upon to provide support. In Europe, some use was made of several variants of the Bissel bogie in which the swivelling movement of a single axle truck controls the lateral displacement of the front driving axle (and in one case the second axle too). This was mostly applied to 8-coupled express and mixed traffic locomotives, and considerably improved their ability to negotiate curves whilst restricting overall locomotive wheelbase and maximising adhesion weight.|$|E
2500|$|The 9F {{also proved}} its worth as a {{passenger}} locomotive, adept at fast running despite its small driving wheels, {{and for a}} time was a frequent sight on the Somerset and Dorset Railway, where its power and high proportion of <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> were well suited to coping with the 1 in 50 ruling gradient on the Bath extension. On one occasion, a 9F was set to haul an express passenger train, in place of the normal LNER [...] "Pacific", from Grantham to King's Cross. An enthusiast aboard the train timed the run and noted that twice the speed exceeded 90mph. The driver was afterwards told that he was only supposed to keep time, [...] "not break the bloody sound barrier!" [...] He replied that the engine had no speedometer, and that it ran so smoothly at high speeds that he just let it run as fast as felt safe. Nor was this the only instance of 9Fs reaching high speeds. However, concerns that the high rotational speeds involved in fast running could cause excessive wear and tear to the plain-bearing running gear prompted the British Railways management to stop the utilisation of 9Fs on express passenger trains ...|$|E
2500|$|The 9F was {{designed}} at both Derby and Brighton Works in 1951 to operate freight trains {{of up to}} 900tons (914tonnes) at 35mph (56km/h) with maximum fuel efficiency. The original proposal was for a boiler from the BR Standard Class 7 Britannia 4-6-2, adapting it to a 2-8-2 wheel arrangement [...] but Riddles eventually settled upon a 2-10-0 type {{because it had been}} used successfully on some of his previous Austerity locomotives. Distributing the <b>adhesive</b> <b>weight</b> over five axles gave a maximum axle load of only 15tons, 10cwt. The driving wheels were [...] in diameter. However, in order to clear the rear coupled wheels the grate had to be set higher, thus reducing firebox volume. There were many problems associated with locomotives of such a long wheelbase, but these were solved by the design team through a series of compromises. The centre driving wheels had no flanges, and those on the second and fourth coupled wheels were reduced in depth. This enabled the locomotive to round curves of only [...] radius. As on all other BR standard steam locomotives the leading wheels were [...] in diameter.|$|E
50|$|LGVs can {{incorporate}} steeper gradients than normal. This facilitates planning and reduces their cost of construction. The high power/weight and <b>adhesive</b> weight/total <b>weight</b> ratios of TGVs {{allow them to}} climb much steeper grades than conventional trains. The considerable momentum at high speeds also helps to climb these slopes very quickly without greatly increasing energy consumption. The Paris-Sud-Est LGV has grades of up to 3.5% (on the German NBS high-speed line between Cologne and Frankfurt they reach 4%). On a high-speed line {{it is possible to}} have greater superelevation (cant), since all trains are travelling at the same (high) speed and a train stopping on a curve is a very rare event. Curve radii in high-speed lines have to be large, but increasing the superelevation allows for tighter curves while supporting the same train speed. Allowance for tighter curves can reduce construction costs by reducing the number and/or length of tunnels or viaducts and the volume of earthworks.|$|R

Melanoma colonies stained with Masson's Trichrome, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), periodic acid-Schiff, Best's carmine, Page-Green method for inclusion bodies, and Snook's reticulum revealed cellular and extracellular components by LM.

In this study, an {{experimental}} investigation {{was conducted in}} order to determine the effect of moisture absorption at different adhesive thickness (i. e., 0. 5, 1. 0, 1. 5 and 2. 0 mm) on strength of adhesive T-joint in urea granulator fluidization bed. In particular, T-joint specimens were exposed to three humidity conditions, namely, 80 °C, 90 °C, and 100 °C at a constant time immersion of 15 minutes in water. Stainless steel plate and stainless steel perforated plate were joined by using a specific adhesive jig according to desired thickness. Tensile test was conducted by using universal tensile machine (UTM) at room temperature. The result obtained has enabled to explain the failure mechanisms and characteristics of adhesive T-joint with respect to moisture condition and bonding thickness. Epoxy <b>adhesive</b> with several <b>weight</b> percent of water absorption will degrade the physical properties of the adhesive. Moisture condition has some effect on the strength of the adhesive bonding. 1. 0 mm of adhesive thickness provides the highest value of failure load.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the onset of avalanches in fine, cohesive granular materials. In our experiments shear stress is generated by tilting an initialized bed of powder and increasing the angle of tilt until the powder avalanches. We find that the angle a of the avalanche decreases with increasing bed width. The avalanche depth increases with the bed width and, in all cases, is {{of the order of}} several millimeters, which is much greater than the particle size. We carry out a macroscopic analysis of the avalanche process based on Coulomb’s method of wedges. This analysis shows the fundamental role played by powder cohesion and boundary conditions on avalanches in fine cohesive powders. This behavior contrasts with the behavior of noncohesive grains, such as dry sand, where avalanches consist of superficial layers of about ten grains. The reason behind this is that for our experimental powders (particle diameter ~ 10 mm) the van der Waals interparticle adhesive force exceeds several orders of magnitude particle <b>weight.</b> <b>Adhesive</b> forces oppose gravity, and as a result fine cohesive powders settle in very open structures as compared to noncohesive granular materials. Because of the dominance of adhesive forces over particle weight, our materials behave more like wet sand...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Fibronectin {{molecules}} are dimers {{composed of}} subunits whose primary structures may differ. This {{is due to}} alternative splicing {{in at least two}} regions (ED and IIICS) of the pre-mRNA. Using two monoclonal antibodies specific for two different epitopes of domain 5 (high affinity for heparin), we have quantitatively analyzed the expression of the IIICS sequence in human fibronectins from different sources. The results demonstrated that the percentage of fibronectin subunits containing the IIICS is higher in fibronectins from tumor-derived or simian F IBRONECTINS (FNs) ~ are high molecular <b>weight</b> <b>adhesive</b> glycoproteins present in soluble form in plasma and other body fluids and in insoluble form in the extracellular matrices and basement membranes. FN molecules act as bridges between the cell surface and extracellular material. In fact, the FN molecules contain a cell-binding site and binding sites for collagen, heparin, ganglioside, and fibrin. Due to their multiple interactions FNs {{play an important role in}} diverse biological phenomena including cell adhesion, cell migration, hemostasis and thrombosis, wound healing, and the ability to induce a more normal phenotype in transformed cells (for reviews on distribution, structure, and biological functions see references 1, 3, 4, 13, and 16). Recently it has been demonstrated that the FN polymorphism may be due to alternative splicing schemes since many different mRNAs may originate from the primary transcript of a single gene (5, 7 - 10, 17, 18, 22) localized on chromosome two (6, 27).

40|$|A {{natural process}} for any engineer, scientist, educator, etc. {{is to seek}} the most {{efficient}} method for accomplishing a given task. In the case of structural design, {{an area that has}} {{a significant impact on the}} structural efficiency is joint design. Unless the structure is machined from a solid block of material, the individual components which compose the overall structure must be joined together. The method for joining a structure varies depending on the applied loads, material, assembly and disassembly requirements, service life, environment, etc. Using both metallic and fiber reinforced plastic materials limits the user to two methods or a combination of these methods for joining the components into one structure. The first is mechanical fastening and the second is adhesive bonding. Mechanical fastening is by far the most popular joining technique; however, in terms of structural efficiency, adhesive bonding provides a superior joint since the load is distributed uniformly across the joint. The purpose of this paper is to develop a method for optimizing single-lap joint adhesive bonded structures using both gradient and genetic algorithms and comparing the solution process for each method. The goal of the single-lap joint optimization is to find the most efficient structure that meets the imposed requirements while still remaining as lightweight, economical, and reliable as possible. For the single-lap joint, an optimum joint is determined by minimizing the weight of the overall joint based on constraints from adhesive strengths as well as empirically derived rules. The analytical solution of the sin-le-lap joint is determined using the classical Goland-Reissner technique for case 2 type <b>adhesive</b> joints. Joint <b>weight</b> minimization is achieved using a commercially available routine, Design Optimization Tool (DOT), for the gradient solution while an author developed method is used for the genetic algorithm solution. Results illustrate the critical design variables as a function of adhesive properties and convergences of different joints based on the two optimization methods...|$|R
40|$|Background: The use of {{surgical}} adhesive tapes after minor surgical and dermatologic operations is widespread. Their use reduces the wound tension and separation and they ultimately improve the postoperative scar. The {{most commonly used}} wound adhesives to enhance the adhesiveness of the surgical tapes, are tincture of benzoin and mastisol. Aim: The {{purpose of the present}} study is to demonstrate the role of adhesive power of dressing spray with the adhesive tape application on the skin, which is widely used in clinics after the skin closure. Methods: Fifteen volunteers who were chosen among the medical personnel of the hospital comprised the study group. The skin of the flexor aspect of the 1 / 3 middle forearm of the subjects was used as the procedure region. The data is collected in the first, second and eighth days of the study. At the first stage of the study, an adhesive wound closure tape was applied to the skin without any compound of adhesives (group A). In the second and third stages, a thin coat of transparent film dressing spray (group B) and an adhesive compound of tincture of benzoin (group C) were applied to the skin before the adhesive tape placement, respectively. Different values of weights ranging between 50 - 900 gm were hanged by hooking into the center of the <b>adhesive</b> tape. The <b>weights</b> that caused complete separations of the tape from the skin after exactly 20 seconds were recorded in all groups. The data was analyzed by using Friedman test in order to calculate statistical significance between groups A, B and C. Results: The difference in adhesive power between control and groups B and C was found to be highly significant (p < 0. 05). Compound tincture of benzoin was observed to have greatest adhesive strength. Transparent film dressing spray was not as efficient as tincture of benzoin, but when compared with the control group, it enhanced the tape adhesion by 2 -fold. Conclusion: The results indicated that dressing spray tested has an additional adhesive power besides its well known features and that it can be used as an efficient alternative material among other adhesive compounds...|$|R
