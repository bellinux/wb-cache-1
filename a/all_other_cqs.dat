40|$|Abstract. Kyparisis proved in 1985 that {{a strict}} {{version of the}} Mangasarian-Fromovitz {{constraint}} qualification (MFCQ) {{is equivalent to the}} uniqueness of Lagrange multipliers. However, the definition of this strict version of MFCQ requires the existence of a Lagrange multiplier and is not a constraint qualifi-cation (CQ) itself. In this note we show that LICQ is the weakest CQ which ensures (existence and) uniqueness of Lagrange multipliers. We also recall the relations between <b>other</b> <b>CQs</b> and properties of the set of Lagrange multipliers...|$|R
30|$|With {{the help}} of the working set technique, the three SLEs solved in Algorithm A have a common {{coefficient}} matrix V_k, which can save the cost of computation and is different from those in Refs. [18, 26], etc. Furthermore, due to being interior point type and the constructing technique for V_k, Algorithm A is well defined at each iterate without any <b>other</b> <b>CQ</b> except the strict inner X̃_ 0 ≠∅, see Lemmas 1 and 2. In many existing QP-free type algorithms, see Refs. [1, 3, 21 – 24], the linearly independent constraint qualification (LICQ) is necessary to ensure the iterate itself is well defined. Of course, as we see in Assumption H 3, to obtain the global and superlinear convergence of Algorithm A, a suitable CQ on the boundary of X̃ is still necessary.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{characteristics of}} presidential support scores {{compiled by the}} Office of Congressional Relations (OCR) from 1961 to 1967. These characteristics are compared to similar scores compiled by Congressional Quarterly (CQ). The OCR scores were based on votes known to be important to the presidents, while CQ could not make such distinctions. This difference in vote selection generated important substantive and methodological implications. For example, the OCR scores reveal that Republicans and southern Democrats were much less supportive of the presidents than CQ suggests, while northern Democrats were much more supportive. This, along with <b>other</b> <b>CQ</b> shortcomings revealed by the analysis of CQ-OCR differences, argues {{for the use of}} the OCR scores when attempting to explain presidential influence, and a sensitivity to important problems with the CQ scores when the OCR data are not available...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Priority queues {{are widely}} {{employed}} in numerous applications such discrete event simulations (DESs). The priority queue structure plays an integral role {{of managing the}} pending event set of a DES. The priority queue contains events where the minimum timestamp event has the highest priority and the maximum timestamp event has the lowest priority. A Calendar Queue (CQ) is a useful structure often employed in DESs. Its popularity is due to its expected O(1) access time for many simulation scenarios, provided the CQ resizes appropriately frequent to ensure that events are evenly distributed in the CQ structure. The resize operation is triggered whenever the number of events fluctuates significantly or when a skewed event distribution is detected. A resize operation is costly as it copies events from the old CQ structure to a newly-created one. <b>Other</b> <b>CQ</b> variants such as the Dynamic CQ and SNOOPy exhibit somewhat futile attempts to improve the heuristics involve in triggering the resize operation. This article introduces a novel priority queue implementation known as the Dynamic Splay Tree (DSplay) structure which {{does not require the}} resize operation to obtain near O(1) performance. The DSplay is also empirically shown to be on the average at least 100 % faster than all the current priority queues. 1...|$|R
