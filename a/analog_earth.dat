40|$|We {{present a}} novel method for direct {{detection}} and characterization of exoplanets from space. This method uses four collecting telescopes, combined with phase chopping and a spectrometer, with observations on {{only a few}} baselines rather than on a continuously rotated baseline. Focusing on the contiguous wavelength spectra of typical exoplanets, the (u, v) plane can be simultaneously and uniformly filled by recording the spectrally resolved signal. This concept allows us to perfectly remove speckles from reconstructed images. For a target comprising a star and multiple planets, observations on three baselines are sufficient to extract the position and spectrum of each planet. Our simulations show that this new method allows us to detect an <b>analog</b> <b>Earth</b> around a Sun-like star at 10 pc and to acquire its spectrum over the wavelength range from 8 to 19 μm with a high spectral resolution of 100. This method allows us to fully characterize an <b>analog</b> <b>Earth</b> and to similarly characterize each planet in multi-planet systems. Comment: 10 pages, 12 figure...|$|E

40|$|Aiming at obtaining {{detailed}} information of surface environment of <b>Earth</b> <b>analogs,</b> Kawahara & Fujii (2011) proposed an inversion technique of annual scattered light curves named the spin-orbit tomography (SOT), which enables one to sketch a two-dimensional albedo map from annual {{variation of the}} disk-integrated scattered light, and demonstrated the method with a planet in a face-on orbit. We extend it to be applicable to general geometric configurations, including low-obliquity planets like the Earth in inclined orbits. We simulate light curves of the Earth in an inclined orbit in three photometric bands (0. 4 - 0. 5 um, 0. 6 - 0. 7 um, and 0. 8 - 0. 9 um) and show that the distribution of clouds, snow, and continents is retrieved {{with the aid of}} the SOT. We also demonstrate the SOT by applying it to an upright Earth, a tidally locked <b>Earth,</b> and <b>Earth</b> <b>analogs</b> with ancient continental configurations.

40|$|No true extrasolar <b>Earth</b> <b>analog</b> is known. Hundreds {{of planets}} {{have been found}} around Sun-like stars that are either Earth-sized but on shorter periods, or else on year-long orbits but {{somewhat}} larger. Under strong assumptions, exoplanet catalogs {{have been used to}} make an extrapolated estimate of the rate at which Sun-like stars host <b>Earth</b> <b>analogs.</b> These studies are {{complicated by the fact that}} every catalog is censored by non-trivial selection effects and detection efficiencies, and every property (period, radius, etc.) is measured noisily. Here we present a general hierarchical probabilistic framework for making justified inferences about the population of exoplanets, taking into account survey completeness and, for the first time, observational uncertainties. We are able to make fewer assumptions about the distribution than previous studies; we only require that the occurrence rate density be a smooth function of period and radius (employing a Gaussian process). By applying our method to synthetic catalogs, we demonstrate that it produces more accurate estimates of the whole population than standard procedures based on weighting by inverse detection efficiency. We apply the method to an existing catalog of small planet candidates around G dwarf stars (Petigura et al. 2013). We confirm a previous result that the radius distribution changes slope near Earth's radius. We find that the rate density of <b>Earth</b> <b>analogs</b> is about 0. 02 (per star per natural logarithmic bin in period and radius) with large uncertainty. This number is much smaller than previous estimates made with the same data but stronger assumptions. Comment: ApJ accepted version.

50|$|Another {{criteria}} of an <b>Earth</b> <b>analog</b> {{is that it}} should orbit a solar analog, that is, a star much like our Sun, similar photometrically or in terms of spectral type.

50|$|Many of Earth's surface {{materials}} and landforms are {{formed as a}} result of interaction with water (such as clay and sedimentary rocks) or as a byproduct of life (such as limestone or coal), interaction with the atmosphere, volcanically or artificially.

50|$|The {{probability}} of finding an <b>Earth</b> <b>analog</b> depends {{mostly on the}} attributes {{that are expected to}} be similar, and these vary greatly. Generally it is considered {{that it would be a}} terrestrial planet and there have been several scientific studies aimed at finding such planets. Often implied but not limited to are such criteria as planet size, surface gravity, star size and type (i.e. Solar analog), orbital distance and stability, axial tilt and rotation, similar geography, oceans, air and weather conditions, strong magnetosphere and even the presence of Earth-like complex life. If there is complex life, there could be some forests covering much of the land. If there is intelligent life, some parts of land could be covered in cities. Some factors that are assumed of such a planet may be unlikely due to Earth's own history. For instance the Earth's atmosphere was not always oxygen-rich and this is a biosignature from the emergence of photosynthetic life. The formation, presence, influence on these characteristics of the Moon (such as tidal forces) may also pose a problem in finding an <b>Earth</b> <b>analog.</b>|$|R
