40|$|Neurodegenration is a {{pathological}} hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), but the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, we present evidence that reveals {{a crucial role}} of Wnt 5 <b>a</b> <b>signaling</b> in this process. We showed that Wnt 5 a and its receptor Frizzled- 5 (Fz 5) were up-regulated in the AD mouse brain, and that beta-amyloid peptide (Ab), a major constituent of amyloid plaques, stimulated Wnt 5 a and Fz 5 expression in primary cortical cultures; these observations indicate that Wnt 5 <b>a</b> <b>signaling</b> could be aberrantly activated during AD pathogenesis. In support of such a possibility, we observed that inhibition of Wnt 5 <b>a</b> <b>signaling</b> attenuated while activation of Wnt 5 <b>a</b> <b>signaling</b> enhanced Ab-evoked neurotoxicity, suggesting a role of Wnt 5 <b>a</b> <b>signaling</b> in AD-related neurodegeneration. Furthermore, we also demonstrated that Ab-induced neurotoxicity depends on inflammatory processes, and that activation of Wnt 5 <b>a</b> <b>signaling</b> elicited the expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL- 1 b and TNF-a whereas inhibition of Wnt 5 <b>a</b> <b>signaling</b> attenuated the Ab-induced expression of the cytokines in cortical cultures. Our findings collectively suggest that aberrantly up-regulated Wnt 5 <b>a</b> <b>signaling</b> is <b>a</b> crucial pathological step that contributes to AD-related neurodegeneration by regulating neuroinflammation...|$|R

5|$|In {{order to}} be effective, costly signals must fulfill {{specific}} criteria. Firstly, signallers must incur different levels of cost and benefit for signalling behaviour. Secondly, costs and benefits must reflect the signallers’ phenotypic quality. Thirdly, the information provided by <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> should be directed at and accessible to an audience. A receiver can be anyone who stands to benefit from information the signaller is sending, such as potential mates, allies, or competitors. Honesty is guaranteed when only individuals of high quality can pay the (high) costs of signalling. Hence, costly signals {{make it impossible for}} low-quality individuals to fake <b>a</b> <b>signal</b> and fool a receiver.|$|E

40|$|Correct spatio-temporal {{regulation}} of Wnt 5 <b>a</b> <b>signaling</b> {{is required for}} normal developmental morphogenesis, and defects in this pathway are linked to tumorigenesis.

Interestingly, recent studies in Drosophila and mouse have revealed that disrupted cell polarity might contribute to invasion/metastasis of cancers. Wnt 5 a activates the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway, partly through the receptor tyrosine kinase Ror 2. Here, we review developments in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying Wnt 5 <b>a</b> <b>signaling,</b> with <b>an</b> emphasis on the role of Ror 2 in cancer.
