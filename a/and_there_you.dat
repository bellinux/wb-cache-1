500|$|Interviewed by Oriana Fallaci in 1965, Connery {{identified}} {{where he}} had altered the character for the films, saying [...] "I said to the producers that the character had one defect, there was no humor about him; to get him accepted, they'd have to let me play him tongue-in-cheek, so people could laugh. They agreed, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> are: today Bond is accepted {{to such an extent}} that even philosophers take the trouble to analyze him, even intellectuals enjoy defending him or attacking him. And even while they're laughing at him, people take him terribly seriously". Connery went on to add that [...] "Bond is important: this invincible superman that every man would like to copy, that every woman would like to conquer, this dream we all have of survival. And then one can't help liking him". After the pressures of five films in six years, Connery left the role after the 1967 film You Only Live Twice saying, [...] "It became a terrible pressure, like living in a goldfish bowl... that was part of the reason I wanted to be finished with Bond. Also I had become completely identified with it, and it became very wearing and very boring".|$|E

500|$|In September 2006 Pope Benedict XVI gave {{a speech}} on the {{question}} of the [...] "reasonableness" [...] of the Christian faith, to the University of Regensburg in Germany. In the Regensburg lecture he spoke about rationality in faith, and cited comments by the fourteenth-century Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaiologos, who, as the Pope put it, said [...] "show me just what Mohamed brought that was new, <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached." [...] The citation attracted severe criticism from Muslims around the world, including the parliament of Pakistan which condemned the Pope for his comments, and which sought an apology from him. [...] Following the speech, on 17 September Choudary led a protest outside Westminster Cathedral, where he told reporters [...] "Whoever insults the message of Mohammed is going to be subject to capital punishment." [...] The Daily Mail reported him as saying: [...] "I am here [...] have a peaceful demonstration, but there may be people in Italy and other parts that would carry that out." [...] The Metropolitan Police investigated his comments, but concluded that [...] "no substantive offences" [...] were committed during the demonstration. The Shadow Home Secretary, David Davis, who had called for action to be taken against Choudary, said: [...] "It is quite disgraceful. It sends out a message to Muslim extremists that we, as a country, do not have the moral courage to stand up to them." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pope Benedict's {{relations}} with Islam were strained at times. On 12 September 2006 {{he delivered a}} lecture which touched on Islam at the University of Regensburg in Germany. The Pope had previously served there {{as a professor of}} theology, and his lecture was entitled [...] "Faith, Reason and the University—Memories and Reflections". The lecture received much attention from political and religious authorities. Many Islamic politicians and religious leaders registered their protest against what they labelled an insulting mischaracterisation of Islam, although his focus was aimed towards the rationality of religious violence, and its effect on the religion. Muslims were particularly offended by this passage that the Pope quoted in his speech: [...] "Show me just what Muhammad brought that was new <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> will find things only evil and inhuman, such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached." ...|$|E

2500|$|Beauvoir {{writes that}} [...] "to ask two spouses bound by practical, {{social and moral}} ties to satisfy each other sexually for their whole lives is pure absurdity". She {{describes}} the work of married women, including housecleaning, writing that it is [...] "holding away death but also refusing life". She thinks, [...] "what makes the lot of the wife-servant ungratifying is {{the division of labor}} that dooms her wholly to the general and inessential". Beauvoir writes that a woman finds her dignity only in accepting her vassalage which is bed [...] "service" [...] and housework [...] "service". A woman is weaned away from her family and finds only [...] "disappointment" [...] on the day after her wedding. Beauvoir points out various inequalities between a wife and husband and finds they pass the time not in love but in [...] "conjugal love". She thinks that marriage [...] "almost always destroys woman". She quotes Sophia Tolstoy who wrote in her diary: [...] "you are stuck there forever <b>and</b> <b>there</b> <b>you</b> must sit". Beauvoir thinks marriage is a perverted institution oppressing both men and women.|$|E
