25|$|Post-financial {{crisis and}} several {{spectacular}} fund governance failures, {{there has been}} much debate among fund directors worldwide about whether the proprietorship or professional firm approach is best for a professional fund. The matter has also been studied extensively by leading independent academic researchers at the Stanford Law Review, University of Kentucky and University of Cambridge among many others. Collectively these independent studies shattered many of the myths about professional fund governance and consistently supported the professional firm model over the proprietor model. Currently there is no independent research that supports the proprietorship model. In the Stanford Law Review, the authors argue â€œwe know of no other service provided for corporations that is obligated by law to be performed by a sole proprietorship, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason.</b> Lawyers, consultants, accountants, doctors, and so on, all associate with each other to form corporate entities to provide their services for a host of well understood reasons".|$|E

2500|$|About.com {{gave the}} show {{a rating of}} 4.5 stars. The series {{described}} Arthurs assets: The Arthur series has won several awards including the George Foster Peabody, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason.</b> Arthur presents issues and situations kids can relate to, and teaches positive behaviors and responses to these issues in a genuine and comical way. The series is fun and engaging to the target age group. Kids will relate to the storylines and characters, and will therefore give thought to the responses the characters demonstrate and outcome of those responses. Because [...] "Arthur" [...] presents real childhood issues, the show contains some imitative behavior such as name calling or bickering, much like children experience in their own lives. Kids might hear words like [...] "sissy" [...] or [...] "stupid" [...] and see Arthur and D.W. argue. Should children mimic some of these phrases or tactics, the show provides a good springboard for parents {{to talk about the}} issues with their children and point out the importance of considering others' feelings. The review continued by citing many ways in which children could extract more from the series, for example by encouraging kids to write stories based on their own families (in much the same way Arthur was first realised) or by Kim Brown, Marc Brown's sister, teaching kids to draw Arthur while on tour.|$|E
2500|$|Jones was {{a logical}} choice for Fisk President. Jones, who {{for seven years}} worked as a {{professor}} of sociology at Hampton Institute, and after a brief stint as a statistician at the Bureau of the Census, joined the newly created Phelps-Stokes Fund in 1912 as its educational director, a position he would hold for over three decades. [...] Despite his unique qualifications for the position, Jones quickly turned down the opportunity, feeling he could do more for Black education in his role with the Phelps-Stokes Fund than he could at a single institution. With Jones no longer interested, responsibility for finding a suitable candidate fell largely to Booker T. Washington, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>good</b> <b>reason.</b> Any serious candidate for the position required the blessing of Washington, Fisk's Board of Trustees and the General Education Board. In March 1914, after a long search, John Cutler Shedd, a professor of physics at Olivet College in Michigan, emerged as the leading candidate for the position. Shedd travelled to New York City to meet with a variety of Fisk stakeholders, including the Carnegie Foundation, officers of the American Missionary Association, academics from Cornell University (all of whom were friends with Booker T. Washington), and Wallace Buttrick. Shortly thereafter, Shedd and his wife visited Fisk's campus, and then proceeded [...] to Tuskegee to meet with Washington. Washington believed Shedd was [...] "the best man we can get for the presidency of Fisk University," [...] but warned of opposition by Fisk alumni and the Nashville Black community who wanted a Black president. He also predicted and a stormy period of two or three years for Shedd and his family to acclimate to the unique conditions of the South. Washington observed most Northerners [...] "make the mistake of expressing opinions before they have had time to get into the local atmosphere of the community, or of the South." [...] Shedd [...] "ought to be cautioned not to be too ready with opinions concerning either Fisk or Southern conditions." ...|$|E

40|$|Pluralist and eliminativist {{positions}} in philosophy â€“ and other disciplines â€“ have proliferated in recent decades. This paper emphasises the sheer scale of this movement: we start by summarising twenty debates {{which have been}} affected, thus illustrating how often debates have been transformed {{by the introduction of}} pluralist and/or eliminativist thinking. We then provide an explanation of why this shift of philosophical terrain has occurred, an explanation which in turn predicts that its reach will extend to other debates currently unaffected, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>good</b> <b>reasons.</b> We go on to detail the landscape of various different pluralist and eliminativist positions one may favour. We ultimately argue for pluralism at the meta-level: whether one should implement (some stripe of) pluralism or eliminativism depends on the context of discussion and the details of the debate at hand. We use this analysis to dissolve debates between â€˜pluralistsâ€™ and â€˜eliminativistsâ€™ in various domains...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{classical}} power spectrum, computed in {{the frequency}} domain, outranks traditionally used periodograms derived in the time domain (such as the c 2 periodogram) regarding the search for biological rhythms. Unfortunately, classical power spectral analysis is not possible with unequally spaced data (e. g., time series with missing data). The Lomb-Scargle periodogram fixes this short-coming. However, peak detection in the Lomb-Scargle periodogram of une-qually spaced data requires some careful consideration. To guide researchers in the proper evaluation of detected peaks, therefore, a novel procedure and a com-puter program have recently become available. It is recommended that the Lomb-Scargle periodogram be the default method of periodogram analysis in future biomedical applications of rhythm investigation. Key words time series analysis, periodogram analysis, power spectrum, Lomb-Scargle method, peak detection, multiple peaks, biological rhythms, unequally spaced data Periodogram analysis {{plays a major role}} in the study of biological rhythms, <b>and</b> <b>for</b> <b>good</b> <b>reasons...</b>|$|R

40|$|Hydrology and {{the other}} {{environmental}} sciences need to re-evaluate their approach to {{the scientific study of}} the problems with which they deal; there is a fundamental conflict between the scale of experiments and the scale of problems of significance. This conflict will not be resolved in hydrology with the range of measurement techniques that are currently available <b>and,</b> <b>for</b> <b>good</b> <b>reasons,</b> cannot be solved by theoretical reasoning alone. An interim approach is advocated, in which hypotheses to be tested and predictive models are formulated from a disaggregation point of view, rather than the futile attempts at aggregation represented by most of today's â€˜physically-basedâ€™ theorising. Such an approach must recognise explicitly the equifinality and uncertainty that will accompany the limitations of disaggregation from a larger scale, but can, in fact, use uncertainty as a tool in working towards more realistic theory, as and when new data and measurement techniques become available...|$|R

40|$|A major {{characteristic}} of software engineering {{compared with other}} engineering disciplines, is our inability to get the product right first time around.

The real-world problem, which the software exists to solve, is itself subject to change.

At the same time, software has become a critical competitive factor for many organisations.
