30|$|The rapid-hardening method {{employing}} the injection of calcium sulfoaluminate (CSA) cement mortar into voids between preplaced <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates</b> has recently {{emerged as a}} promising approach for the renovation of existing ballasted railway tracks to concrete tracks. This method typically {{involves the use of}} a redispersible polymer powder to enhance the durability of the resulting recycled aggregate concrete. However, the effects of the amount of polymer on the mechanical and durability properties of recycled <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregate</b> concrete were not clearly understood. In addition, the effects of the cleanness condition of <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates</b> were never examined. This study aimed at investigating these two aspects through compression and flexure tests, shrinkage tests, freezing–thawing resistance tests, and optical microscopy. The results revealed that an increase in the amount of polymer generally decreased the compressive strength at the curing age of 28  days. However, the use of a higher polymer ratio enhanced the modulus of rupture, freezing–thawing resistance, and shrinkage resistance, likely because it improved the microstructure of the interfacial transition zones between recycled <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates</b> and injected mortar. In addition, a higher cleanness level of <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates</b> generally improved the mechanical and durability qualities of concrete.|$|R
30|$|Given the {{aforementioned}} concerns, {{the effects of}} the amount of polymer and the cleanness level of aggregates on the mechanical and durability properties of PAC produced from recycled <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates</b> were investigated in this study. Compression and flexure tests, shrinkage tests, freezing–thawing resistance tests, and optical microscopy were conducted by varying the amount of a dispersible polymer powder and the cleanness level of <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{particle}} size distributions of fine and <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates</b> are plotted in Fig.  8. Because the maximum size of <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates</b> was {{slightly larger than}} 60  mm (Fig.  7), only <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates</b> passing through a 40 -mm sieve {{were used for the}} concrete tests of this study, as specified in KS F 2403 (Korean Standards Association 2014 a, b). Note that ASTM C 192 (2016) specifies that the sample should be created by wet sieving through a 50 -mm sieve when the maximum size of coarse aggregate is larger than 50  mm. In this study, however, a 40 -mm sieve was used, considering that the freeze–thaw tests were conducted on 100 [*]×[*] 100 [*]×[*] 400  mm specimens according to ASTM C 666 (2016).|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{the main}} test {{variables}} were {{the amount of}} polymer and the cleanness level of recycled <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates.</b> The polymer ratio was varied as 0, 2, 6, and 10 % of the total weight of cement. The cleanness level of <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates</b> was classified {{as one of the}} three categories (H-, M-, or L-level) according to the amount of alien particles remaining on the aggregate surface, as described in the previous section.|$|R
30|$|Another way of {{improving}} the microstructure of ITZs in the resulting concrete would be to remove pollutants from the surfaces of <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates.</b> However, the cleaning process requires additional time and cost, and it produces environmental pollutants such as dust and noise (Lee 2010). Hence, the effects of different cleanness levels of <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates</b> {{need to be examined}} to minimize the construction time and cost while meeting the strength and durability requirements of concrete.|$|R
30|$|With {{regard to}} the effect of the {{cleanness}} level of <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates,</b> C-L- 2 and C-L- 6 underwent a smaller shrinkage strain than C-H- 2 and C-H- 6, respectively. This could be possibly because the fine particles attached to <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates</b> filled the micro-pores of concrete and consequently reduced the shrinkage strain (Li and Yao 2001). However, the effect of the aggregate cleanness on the shrinkage strain of concrete was not as significant as that of the polymer ratio.|$|R
40|$|Ballast is an {{essential}} layer of the railroad track structure, and provides primarily drainage and load distribution. In general, <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates</b> are considered as uniformly graded, angular shaped with crushed faces. However, various <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregate</b> gradations and particle shapes are in use yet their effects on ballast performances remain unknown. In previous designs and modeling practices, railroad ballast has usually been treated as a homogeneous and continuous layer. This approach is not suitable to model the deformation behavior of the particulate nature railroad <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates</b> under dynamic moving loads. Further, continuum solutions do {{not take into account}} realistically the morphological characteristics of aggregates such as particle size distribution and shapes. A combined digital image and Discrete Element Modeling (DEM) methodology has been developed in this PhD thesis to study effects of aggregate particle size and morphological characteristics on ballast performances. The approach has been calibrated using actual <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates</b> through laboratory shear box texts and validated by further laboratory as well as field experiments.

30|$|The 28 -day {{compressive}} strength of both mortar and concrete produced from recycled <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates</b> generally decreased as the polymer ratio increased. The {{increase in the}} polymer ratio also caused {{a reduction in the}} modulus of elasticity of concrete.|$|R
30|$|As {{regards the}} effect of the {{cleanness}} level of <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates,</b> the concrete samples of H-level aggregates showed higher tensile strengths than those of M- or L-level aggregates (Fig.  18). The modulus of rupture of C-H- 10 was 24.3 and 11.3 % higher than that of C-M- 10 and C-L- 10, respectively. However, the M-level aggregate concrete samples had rather smaller moduli of rupture than the L-level aggregate concrete samples; i.e., the moduli of rupture of C-M- 10 and C-M- 0 were approximately 14.6 and 6.0 % smaller than those of C-L- 10 and C-L- 0, respectively. This suggests that partial aggregate cleaning might cause a reduction in the tensile strength of PAC with recycled <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates.</b>|$|R

Hence it has been hypothesized that incorporation of biogenic minerals within marine aggregates could either protect the organic matter from decomposition and/or increase the sinking velocity via <b>ballasting</b> of the <b>aggregates.</b> Here we present the first combined data on size, sinking velocity, carbon-specific respiration rate, and composition measured directly in three aggregate types; Emiliania huxleyi <b>aggregates</b> (carbonate <b>ballasted),</b> Skeletonema costatum <b>aggregates</b> (opal <b>ballasted),</b> and <b>aggregates</b> made from a mix of both E. huxleyi and S. costatum (carbonate and opal ballasted). Overall average carbon-specific respiration rate was ~ 0. 13 d− 1 and did not vary with aggregate type and size. Ballasting from carbonate resulted in 2 - to 2. 5 -fold higher sinking velocities than those of <b>aggregates</b> <b>ballasted</b> by opal. We compiled literature data on carbon-specific respiration rate and sinking velocity measured in aggregates of different composition and sources. Compiled carbon-specific respiration rates (including this study) vary between 0. 08 d− 1 and 0. 20 d− 1 . Sinking velocity increases with increasing aggregate size within homogeneous sources of aggregates. When compared across different particle and aggregate sources, however, sinking velocity appeared to be independent of particle or aggregate size. The carbon-specific respiration rate per meter settled varied between 0. 0002 m− 1 and 0. 0030 m− 1 , and decreased with increasing aggregate size.

As part of this thesis study research, direct shear testing was undertaken for two different railroad <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates,</b> granite and limestone.

40|$|Ballasted {{railroad}} tracks are still used {{all around the}} world because of their resiliency to repeated wheel loads, low cost construction and ease of maintenance, but current ballast gradations worldwide vary in particle size and uniformity for reasons that are not always clear. This research aims to investigate the angularity (shape) of <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates</b> and the influence of particle size distribution on its deformation and degradation. To achieve this aim, a three-dimensional laser scanner and the triaxial apparatus designed and built at the University of Wollongong were used respectively to carry out a three dimensional characterisation of <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates</b> and cyclic large-scale triaxial tests. The deformation and degradation of ballast under high and low track speeds was investigated by using two different loading frequencies, and then a fractional order constitutive model was proposed to predict the long term deformation of ballast by using the fractional rate for strain accumulation. These experiments indicated that shape of ballast particles varied according to their size, such that as the particles increased in size, ballast became more rounded and less columnar. Moreover, a two-dimensional characterisation would underestimate particle sphericity, so a new index called ‘ellipsoidness’ was suggested to facilitate a three dimensional analysis of particle shape. This ellipsoidness decreased as the particles increased in size, which indicated relatively more irregularity in coarser ballast. The parent <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates</b> became increasingly regular after cyclic tests while smaller <b>aggregates</b> created from <b>ballast</b> degradation seemed to have a lower ellipsoidness...|$|R
40|$|This study {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} into the grain size distribution of the railway ballast using ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and image analysis. The proposed approach relies on the hypothesis that the dimension (grading) of the <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates</b> can influence the back-reflected spectrum received by the use of GPR. This assumption was confirmed by the finite difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations of the GPR signal, which were run by using the numerical simulator package gprMax 2 D. A regression model was developed which related the "equivalent" diameter of the <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates</b> and the frequency of the peak within the received spectrum. The model was validated in the laboratory environment by means of a 155 cm x 155 cm x 50 cm methacrylate tank, filled up with railway ballast. An air-coupled GPR system equipped with a 2000 MHz central frequency antenna was used for testing purposes. A total of three spatial distributions of the <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates</b> within the tank were investigated, by emptying out and filling up thrice the tank with the same material. The geometric information on the ballast grading obtained from the simulation-based regression model was compared to the actual grading curve of the ballast. To this effect, an algorithm based on the automatic image analysis was developed. The comparison showed that the modelled aggregate diameter corresponded to the 70 % of the grading of the material sieved out in the laboratory.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental study of coal-fouled ballast reinforced with geogrid, at various degrees of fouling and subjected to cyclic loading. A novel Track Process Simulation Testing Apparatus was used to realistically simulate fouled rail track conditions. The laboratory results demonstrated that coal fines acted as a lubricant, causing <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates</b> to displace and rotate and, as a result, increase the deformation of ballast. However, coal fines also reduced ballast breakage somewhat because they fill the voids between the ballast particles and coat surface of <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates</b> which reduce the inter-particle attrition. The placement of a geogrid at the interface between the ballast and sub-ballast layers provides extra internal confinement and interlocks the grains of ballast in its apertures, which also reduces ballast deformation. Based on laboratory results, a threshold value of VCI= 40 % is proposed to assist practitioners in conducting track maintenance as fouling beyond this threshold significantly reduces the reinforcement effect of geogrid so that fouled ballast experiences premature dilation leading to track instability. A novel equation incorporating the Void Contaminant Index and number of load cycles is also introduced to predict the deformation of fouled ballast, improve the design of rail tracks and help make the correct decisions with regards to track maintenance...|$|R

However, railways have still to face several important drawbacks in order to reinforce its competitiveness against the road mode. Reducing maintenance costs has been appointed as one key goal of Infrastructure Managers (IMs), as Western Europe spends annually between € 15 and € 25 bn to maintain and renew a railway network of about 225, 000 km (FP 7 Mainline Project, 2011 - 2014). Future prospects of mobility growth (passenger-km is to be doubled in 40 years) will increase maintenance needs, evincing the need of innovative solutions that downsize maintenance costs. The increasing demand of higher axle loads and higher speeds has led to the improvement of track components (e. g. harder and heavier rails, pre-stressed sleepers, etc.). However, {{there has not been a}} significant change in <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates,</b> even though it is the main cost-driver of maintenance costs. In this context, NEOBALLAST emerges as a high-performing, long-lasting and eco-friendly <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregate</b> solution designed to overcome two of the most important drawbacks of railway tracks: track degradation and noise and vibrations (N&V). Whilst the former is the main trigger of maintenance and eventually renewal works, thus representing one of the main cost drivers for IMs, the latter has become an issue of paramount importance not only to IMs but the whole EU, since according to the European Environment Agency rail noise affects around 12 million people during day time (55 dBA) and 9 million at night (50 dBA). NEOBALLAST is a research project funded by MINECO (Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness) carried out by COMSA, MAPEI, UPC and ADIF. NEOBALLAST benefits have been proven in an extensive laboratory campaign involving both reduced and large-scale testing.

Rail support modulus is important because it affects track performance and maintenance requirements. Both low and large modulus is undesirable. Low modulus of the rail support has been shown to cause differential settlement that then increases maintenance needs. On the other hand, higher value of rail support causes axle load to be distributed on fewer sleepers and therefore received dynamic loads for any sleeper and rail-sleeper fastening will be increased. Sandy desert areas are critical regions about the contamination of ballast.

40|$|For {{several hundred}} years, {{the design of}} railway tracks has {{practically}} remained unchanged. Traditionally, rail tracks are placed on a ballast layer due to several reasons, including economy, rapid drainage, and high load bearing capacity. The primary function of ballast is to distributing dynamic track loads to sub-ballast and subgrade layers, while also providing lateral resistance and allowing for rapid drainage. Upon repeated trainloads, the ballast becomes fouled due to ballast degradation and the intrusion of fines which adversely affects the strength and deformation behaviour of ballast. This paper presents the use of three-dimensional discrete element method (DEM) in studying the shear behaviour of the fouled ballast subjected to direct shear loading. Irregularly shaped particles of ballast were modelled by grouping many spherical balls together in appropriate sizes to simulate representative <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates.</b> Fouled <b>ballast</b> was modelled by injecting a specified number of miniature spherical particles into the void spaces.

A change also occurred in the settling velocity of the particles, which would lead to a higher residence time in the water column, where they could be continuously degraded.

Here we experimentally tested the influence of the ballast mineral smectite on the formation, size, dry weight, size-specific sinking velocity, carbon-specific respiration rate, and total POC flux of marine snow aggregates formed in roller tanks from a natural plankton community isolated from the North Sea. This study shows that the inclusion of smectite offers no protection against degradation of organic matter in freshly produced or aged marine snow aggregates. The main effect of ballasting with smectite was an increase in the density of the aggregates and, therefore 2 - to 3 -fold higher size-specific sinking velocities. Mineral ballasting had no influence on the total volume of aggregates or the total aggregated amount of POC. Nevertheless, the effect of increased sinking velocities in the ballasted treatment resulted in 2. 7 ± 1. 6 times larger potential POC fluxes compared to the non-ballasted aggregates. This implies that the incorporation of ballast minerals into sinking organic aggregates can increase the efficiency of the biological pump...|$|R
40|$|Large and {{frequent}} loads from heavy {{freight and passenger}} trains often lead to the progressive track deterioration. The excessive deformation and degradation of ballast and unacceptable differential settlement of track and/or pumping of underlying soft subgrade soils necessitates frequent and costly track maintenance. However, artificial inclusions such as geogrids and shockmats can mitigate ballast degradation and improve track performance. A quantitative assessment {{of the influence of}} breakage, fouling, and the effects of artificial inclusions on the shear behaviour of ballast can be performed either experimentally or numerically. Numerical modelling can simulate these aspects subject to various types of loading and boundary conditions for a range of material properties so in this study, the stress-strain and degradation response of ballast was analysed through discrete element (DEM) and finite element (FEM) methods. In DEM, irregularly shaped <b>ballast</b> <b>aggregates</b> were simulated by clumping together spheres in appropriate sizes and positions. In FEM, a composite multi-layer track system was simulated and an elasto-plastic model with a non-associative flow rule was used to capture ballast degradation. These DEM and FEM simulations showed a good agreement with large-scale laboratory tests. This paper outlines the advantages of the proposed DEM and FEM models in terms of capturing the correct stress-strain and degradation response of ballast with particular emphasis on particle breakage and fouling, as well as applications of geosynthetic grids and shockmats...|$|R
