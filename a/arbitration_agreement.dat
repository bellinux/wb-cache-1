Under French law, pre-dispute <b>arbitration</b> <b>agreements</b> in consumer contracts where the consumer has little bargaining power are [...] "unfair" [...] and therefore not enforceable under the French Civil Code. In Germany, consumer <b>arbitration</b> <b>agreements</b> [...] "must be written in an 'intelligible and transparent manner'" [...] and must have the form of a separate document signed by both parties. In the United Kingdom, agreements to arbitrate monetary claims of less than ₤5000 are unenforceable (whether pre- or post-dispute), and pre-dispute consumer <b>arbitration</b> <b>agreements</b> are only enforceable if the business [...] "individually negotiated" [...] the clause and [...] "made it in good faith" [...] and the clause is not significantly one-sided against the consumer.|$|R
40|$|Unilateral-modification clauses {{give one}} party the {{unfettered}} right to amend or reject the underlying contract, often with neither notice to nor consent {{from the other}} party. State and federal courts are divided {{on the issue of}} whether employment <b>arbitration</b> <b>agreements</b> subject to such clauses are enforceable (and the courts holding the <b>arbitration</b> <b>agreements</b> are unenforceable are divided on which of several contract law doctrines apply). The majority of courts refuse to compel arbitration when the employer 2 ̆ 7 s unilateral-modification rights create a lack of consideration, a non-mutual agreement, an illusory promise to arbitrate, or an unconscionable agreement. A minority of courts find that the promise of continued employment is adequate consideration and that <b>arbitration</b> <b>agreements</b> containing unilateral-modification clauses are enforceable. This article argues that an employer 2 ̆ 7 s promise of continued at-will employment is illusory and therefore, by itself does not supply consideration for an employee 2 ̆ 7 s promise to arbitrate. The article also argues that under existing contract law doctrines, <b>arbitration</b> <b>agreements</b> subject to unrestricted unilateral-modification provisions should not be enforceable. However, courts should permit employers to retain the ability to unilaterally modify <b>arbitration</b> <b>agreements</b> so long as the agreements provide employees with (1) adequate notice of changes, (2) sufficient consideration for the promise to arbitrate, and (3) conscionable arbitration terms. Courts can overlay this three-step framework onto existing contract doctrines to fairly and consistently analyze the enforceability of unilateral-modification clauses in employment <b>arbitration</b> <b>agreements...</b>|$|R

40|$|As <b>arbitration</b> <b>agreements</b> {{become more}} common, {{bankruptcy}} courts increasingly encounter <b>arbitration</b> <b>agreements</b> {{to which a}} bankruptcy debtor is a party. Bankruptcy judges must then determine whether to enforce an otherwise valid arbitration clause or to refuse enforcement and decide the underlying dispute themselves. To date, bankruptcy judges facing these issues have tended to see arbitrationa s a competing, quasi-judicialf orum. They typically refuse to enforce <b>arbitration</b> <b>agreements</b> when they find that bankruptcy policy would favor resolution in the bankruptcy proceeding instead of in some other adjudicative forum. Building on previous work, I contend in this article that arbitration is best understood not {{as a type of}} quasi-adjudication, but as a species of contract, with the award equivalent to a contract term agreed upon by the parties ex ante. I argue that <b>arbitration</b> <b>agreements</b> should be enforced by bankruptcy courts unless enforcement would prevent a party from vindicating its statutory bankruptcy rights, and that bankruptcy courts should then decide whether to enforce the award by considering whether the award would contravene the policy of bankruptcy law {{if it had been a}} contract term.

40|$|Courts and {{commentators}} have typically assumed that binding arbitration is {{both private and}} consensual, and that it therefore raises no constitutional concerns. This Article challenges both assumptions {{and goes on to}} consider arguments that <b>arbitration</b> <b>agreements</b> may unconstitutionally deprive persons of their right to a jury trial, to a judge, and to due process of law. The author argues first that courts 2 ̆ 7 interpretation of seemingly private <b>arbitration</b> <b>agreements</b> may often give rise to 2 ̆ 2 state action, 2 ̆ 2 particularly where courts have used a 2 ̆ 2 preference favoring arbitration over litigation 2 ̆ 2 to construe a contract in a non-neutral fashion. The author next draws on the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decisions governing waiver of constitutional rights to argue that <b>arbitration</b> <b>agreements</b> are invalid where they are unclear, and further contends that many unknowing or coercive agreements are invalid as well. Having demonstrated the relevance of constitutional analysis to many seemingly private <b>arbitration</b> <b>agreements,</b> the Article contends that many <b>arbitration</b> <b>agreements</b> unconstitutionally deprive prospective federal court litigants of their right to a jury and to an Article III judge. Finally, the author asserts that some arbitration clauses violate the Due Process Clause as well by denying parties their right to adequate notice, an impartial judge, a meaningful appeal, and other specific procedural protections. The Article concludes that we must reconsider the applicability of the Constitution to private <b>arbitration</b> <b>agreements.</b> While many such agreements will present no constitutional concerns, other agreements must be voided under the Constitution...|$|R
25|$|Arguably, either {{position}} is potentially unfair; {{if a person}} is made to sign a contract under duress, and the contract contains an arbitration clause highly favourable to the other party, the dispute may still referred to that arbitration tribunal.

However, most courts will be reluctant to interfere with the general rule which does allow for commercial expediency; any other solution (where one first had to go to court to decide whether one had to go to arbitration) would be self-defeating.|$|E

25|$|Arbitration in its {{common law}} form {{developed}} in England; in the Middle Ages, tribunals {{such as the}} Courts of the Boroughs, of the Fair and of the Staple arose as the Royal Courts were not designed for trade disputes, and trade with foreigners was otherwise unenforceable. In the mid-16th century, common law courts developed contract law and the Admiralty court became accessible for disputes with foreign merchants, broadening the venues for trade disputes. Courts became suspicious of arbitration; for example, in Kill v. Hollister (1746), an English {{court ruled that the}} <b>arbitration</b> <b>agreement</b> could 'oust' courts of law and equity of jurisdiction. Merchants, however, retained provisions to settle disputes among themselves, but tension between the arbitration proceedings and courts eventually resulted in the Common Law Procedure Act 1854 which provided for the appointment of arbitrators and umpires, allowed courts to 'stay proceedings' when a disputant filed a suit despite an agreement to arbitrate, and provided a process for arbitrators to submit questions to a court. Later, the Arbitration Act 1889 was passed, followed by other Arbitration Acts in 1950, 1975, 1979 and 1996. Arbitration Act 1979 in particular limited judicial review for arbitration awards.|$|E

25|$|In the United States {{securities}} industry, arbitration {{has long}} been the preferred method of resolving disputes between brokerage firms, and between firms and their customers. The securities industry uses a pre-dispute <b>arbitration</b> <b>agreement,</b> where the parties agree to arbitrate their disputes before any such dispute arises. Those agreements were upheld by the United States Supreme Court in Shearson v. MacMahon, 482 U.S. 220 (1987) and today nearly all disputes involving brokerage firms, other than Securities class action claims, are resolved in arbitration. The SEC has come under fire from members of the Senate Judiciary Committee for not fulfilling statutory duty to protect individual investors, because all brokers require arbitration, and arbitration does not provide a court-supervised discovery process, require arbitrators to follow rules of evidence or result in written opinions establishing precedence, or case law, or provide the efficiency gains it once did. Arbitrator selection bias, hidden conflicts of interest, and a case where an arbitration panel refused to follow instructions handed down from a judge, were also raised as issues. The final result in the case where the arbitrators were in contempt of court is unknown; it was settled out of court under settlement agreement terms that, at the broker's insistence, are confidential.|$|E

40|$|This Article evaluates how {{state courts}} have applied the {{unconscionability}} doctrine to contracts, including those involving <b>arbitration</b> <b>agreements.</b> Numerous scholars {{have been critical}} of state courts’ application of the unconscionability doctrine to <b>arbitration</b> <b>agreements</b> and have argued that, because state courts are often skeptical or even hostile to arbitration, at least some state courts have used the unconscionability doctrine more often to invalidate <b>arbitration</b> <b>agreements</b> than other types of contract provisions. These assumptions hold true for some individual states or limited time periods, but further research was necessary to determine if the assumptions are true more broadly. For purposes of this study, I analyzed the unconscionability case law, a total of 460 cases, from twenty states—Alaska, Arkansas, Colorado, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, and Vermont— during the time period from 1980 to 2012. The results of my research demonstrate that there is significant variation in how courts apply the unconscionability doctrine. Moreover, this Article shows that, for many of these states, the assumptions that scholars have had regarding state courts’ hostility to <b>arbitration</b> <b>agreements,</b> and those courts’ willingness to use the unconscionability doctrine as a means of invalidating arbitration provisions, are not always supported by the case law.
