5|$|According to SIMBAD, WASP-13 {{was first}} {{observed}} in 1997, {{when it was}} catalogued by astronomers measuring the proper motion of stars in regions of the sky where galaxies are detected. Between November 27, 2006, and April 1, 2007, the SuperWASP-North telescope in the Canary Islands observed WASP-13; <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> suggested that a planet {{could be in the}} orbit of the star.|$|E
5|$|After a rough {{position}} of the burst had been determined, Enrico Costa of the BeppoSAX team contacted astronomer Dale Frail at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's Very Large Array. Frail began making observations at a wavelength of 20centimeters at 01:30UTC, less than four hours after the discovery. While preparing for his observations Frail contacted astronomer Stanislav Djorgovski, who was working with the Hale telescope. Djorgovski immediately compared his images of the region with older images from the Digitized Sky Survey, but he found no new sources of light within the error box. Mark Metzger, a colleague of Djorgovski at the Caltech observatory, conducted a more extensive <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>data,</b> but was also unable to identify any new light sources.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 3634 is a M-class dwarf star, {{meaning that}} it is small, emits reddish light, and has a {{relatively}} low temperature for a star. The star is 0.45 times the mass of and 0.43 times the radius of the Sun. Gliese 3634 is 0.020 times as luminous as the Sun, {{meaning that it}} radiates about 2% {{of the amount of}} energy that the Sun does. It was described as an intermediately active star in its discovery paper. Gliese 3634 lies 19.8 parsecs (approximately 64.6 light years) away from Earth, a relatively close star. Gliese 3634 b is the only planet to have been confirmed in the star's orbit, although initial <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> suggests that a secondary body of an unknown nature also exists, with an orbit of more than 200 days and a mass approximately twice that of Neptune's.|$|E

5|$|The first {{chemical}} {{experiments on}} copernicium were conducted using the 238U(48Ca,3n)283Cn reaction. Detection was by spontaneous fission of the claimed parent isotope with half-life of 5minutes. <b>Analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> indicated that copernicium was more volatile than mercury and had noble gas properties. However, the confusion regarding {{the synthesis of}} copernicium-283 has cast some doubt on these experimental results. Given this uncertainty, between April–May 2006 at the JINR, a FLNR–PSI team conducted experiments probing the synthesis of this isotope as a daughter in the nuclear reaction 242Pu(48Ca,3n)287Fl. In this experiment, two atoms of copernicium-283 were unambiguously identified and the adsorption properties indicated that copernicium is a more volatile homologue of mercury, due to formation of a weak metal-metal bond with gold, placing it firmly in group 12.|$|E

25|$|The {{research}} group, {{headed by}} Robert D.

Another major task of the group is to investigate and re-evaluate the status of the information structure primitives (topic, focus, contrast, etc.) as cross-linguistically valid categories. To achieve this, the members of the group combine extensive corpus <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> in their respective languages with production experiments; all findings are further cross-checked through standard information structure tests (question-answer pairs, aboutness tests, association with focus sensitive items).|$|E

25|$|Experimental and {{statistical}} criticisms followed. Until approximately a decade ago, critics of Bateman’s model {{focused on his}} experimental design. In recent years, they have shifted attention to the actual experimental {{and statistical}} calculations Bateman published throughout his trials. Birkhead wrote a 2000 review arguing that the since Bateman’s experiments lasted only three to four days, the female fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster, may not have needed to mate repeatedly, as it can store sperm for up to four days; if Bateman had used a species in which females had to copulate more often to fertilize their eggs, the results might have been different. Snyder and Gowaty (2007) conducted the first in-depth <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> in Bateman’s 1948 paper.

25|$|The closest {{approach}} of the New Horizons spacecraft to Pluto occurred at 11:49 UTC on July 14, 2015 at a range of 7,750 miles (12,472km) from the surface and 8,487 miles (13,658km) {{from the center of}} Pluto. Telemetry data confirming a successful flyby and a healthy spacecraft were received on Earth from the vicinity of the Pluto system on July 15, 2015, 00:52:37 UTC, after 22 hours of planned radio silence due to the spacecraft being pointed toward the Pluto system. Mission managers estimated a one in 10,000 chance that debris could have destroyed it during the flyby, preventing it from sending science data to Earth.

25|$|The term genomics, {{referring}} to the organism’s whole genome, {{is also used to}} refer to gene informatics, or the collection and storage of genetic data, including the functional information associated with the genes, and the <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>data</b> as combinations, patterns and networks by computer algorithms. Systems biology and genomics are natural partners, since the development of genomic information and systems naturally facilitates analysis of systems biology questions involving relationships between genes, their variants (SNPs) and biological function. Such questions include the investigation of signaling pathways, evolutionary trees, or biological networks, such as immune networks and pathways. For this reason, genomics and these approaches are particularly suited to studies in immunology. The study of immunology using genomics, as well as proteomics and transcriptomics (Includes gene profiles, either genomic or expressed gene mRNA profiles), has been termed immunomics.|$|E

25|$|Vaginally dosed {{progesterone}} {{is being}} investigated as potentially beneficial in preventing preterm birth in women at risk for preterm birth. The initial study by Fonseca suggested that vaginal progesterone could prevent preterm birth in women {{with a history of}} preterm birth.
