Demarcated opacities of enamel have sharp boundaries where the translucency decreases and manifest a white, cream, yellow, or brown color. All these may be caused by nutritional factors, an exanthematous disease (chicken pox, congenital syphilis), undiagnosed and untreated celiac disease, hypocalcemia, dental fluorosis, birth injury, preterm birth, infection or trauma from a deciduous tooth. [...] Dental fluorosis is a condition which results from ingesting excessive amounts of fluoride and leads to teeth which are spotted, yellow, brown, black or sometimes pitted.

Enamel hypoplasia resulting from syphilis is frequently referred to as Hutchinson's teeth, which is considered one part of Hutchinson's triad.

Cancer cells can become resistant to multiple drugs by various mechanisms, including: Altered membrane transport, enhanced DNA repair, apoptotic pathway defects, alteration of target molecules, protein and pathway mechanisms, such as enzymatic deactivation.Since cancer is a genetic disease, two genomic events underlie these mechanisms of acquired drug resistance: Genome alterations (e.g. gene amplification and deletion) and epigenetic modifications.Cancer cells are constantly using a variety of tools, involving genes, proteins and altered pathways, to ensure their survival against antineoplastic drugs. This list of mechanism is in no way exhaustive. New and existing ideas of drug resistance mechanisms are being explored and studied, as well as the complex and challenging ways in overcoming such treatment resistance.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCurrent {{assessment}} of orthotopic tumor models in animals utilizes survival {{as the primary}} therapeutic end point. In vivo bioluminescence imaging (BLI) is a sensitive imaging modality that is rapid and accessible, and may comprise an ideal tool for evaluating <b>antineoplastic</b> <b>therapies</b> [1]. Using human tumor cell lines constitutively expressing luciferase, the kinetics of tumor growth and response to therapy have been assessed in intraperitoneal [2], subcutaneous, and intravascular [3] cancer models. However, use of this approach for evaluating orthotopic tumor models has not been demonstrated. In this report, the ability of BLI to noninvasively quantitate the growth and therapeuticinduced cell kill of orthotopic rat brain tumors derived from 9 L gliosarcoma cells genetically engineered to stably express firefly luciferase (9 LLuc) was investigated. Intracerebral tumor burden was monitored over time by quantitation of photon emission and tumor volume using a cryogenically cooled CCD camera and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), respectively. There was excellent correlation (r= 0. 91) between detected photons and tumor volume. A quantitative comparison of tumor cell kill determined from serial MRI volume measurements and BLI photon counts following 1, 3 -bis(2 -chloroethyl) - 1 -nitrosourea (BCNU) treatment revealed that both imaging modalities yielded statistically similar cell kill values (P=. 951).

Many hematologic malignancies and solid tumors, including melanoma, have been associated with sarcoidosis. We describe the clinical and pathologic findings of a 54 -year-old man with melanoma-associated sarcoidosis. In addition, we not only review the literature describing characteristics of other melanoma patients with sarcoidosis, but also the features of melanoma patients with antineoplastic therapy-associated sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis has been described in 80 melanoma patients; sufficient information for analysis was provided in 39 of these individuals. In 43. 6 % of individuals (17 out of 39), sarcoidosis was directly associated with melanoma; in 56. 4 % of oncologic patients (22 out of 39), sarcoidosis was induced by <b>antineoplastic</b> <b>therapy</b> that had been administered for the treatment of their metastatic melanoma.

40|$|<b>Antineoplastic</b> <b>therapies</b> have {{significantly}} improved {{the prognosis of}} oncology patients. However, these treatments can bring to {{a higher incidence of}} side-effects, including the worrying cardiovascular toxicity (CTX). Substantial evidence indicates multiple mechanisms of CTX, with redox mechanisms playing a key role. Recent data singled out mitochondria as key targets for antineoplastic drug-induced CTX; understanding the underlying mechanisms is, therefore, crucial for effective cardioprotection, without compromising the efficacy of anti-cancer treatments. CTX can occur within a few days or many years after treatment. Type I CTX is associated with irreversible cardiac cell injury, and it is typically caused by anthracyclines and traditional chemotherapeutics. Type II CTX is generally caused by novel biologics and more targeted drugs, and it is associated with reversible myocardial dysfunction. Therefore, patients undergoing anti-cancer treatments should be closely monitored, and patients at risk of CTX should be identified before beginning treatment to reduce CTX-related morbidity. Genetic profiling of clinical risk factors and an integrated approach using molecular, imaging, and clinical data may allow the recognition of patients who are at a high risk of developing chemotherapy-related CTX, and it may suggest methodologies to limit damage in a wider range of patients. The involvement of redox mechanisms in cancer biology and anticancer treatments is a very active field of research.

We aimed to promote awareness of development of sarcoidosis or sarcoid reactions after <b>antineoplastic</b> <b>therapy</b> to avoid diagnostic errors with FDG-PET/CT findings and assess the utility of FDG-PET/CT for follow-up. We retrospectively reviewed radiological reports of FDG-PET/CT scans performed between January 2009 and December 2011. Among oncologic patients with more than 2 FDG-PET/CT scans, those with nearly symmetrical increases in FDG uptake in the hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes were identified, and those with known sarcoidosis, concurrent diagnoses of sarcoidosis with malignancy, or histopathologically proven malignancies were excluded. Then, only those cases were selected for which sarcoidosis or sarcoid reactions were diagnosed. Four of 376 oncologic cases met the criteria. At 9 months to 6 years after <b>antineoplastic</b> <b>therapy,</b> abnormal FDG uptakes were observed in the hilar, mediastinal, abdominal, pelvic, and inguinal nodes, and/or spleen and lung parenchyma with SUVmax up to 17. 7.

We and others have previously shown that in neoplastic cells BAG 3 exerts an anti- apoptotic function thus favoring tumour progression. As a consequence we have proposed BAG 3 as a target of <b>antineoplastic</b> <b>therapies.</b> Here we identify a novel role for BAG 3 in regulation of neo-angiogenesis and show that its downregulation results in reduced angiogenesis therefore expanding the role of BAG 3 as a therapeutical target. In brief we show that BAG 3 is expressed in endothelial cells and {{is essential for the}} interaction between ERK and its phosphatase DUSP 6, as a consequence its removal results in reduced binding of DUSP 6 to ERK and sustained ERK phosphorylation that in turn determines increased levels of p 21 and p 15 and cell-cycle arrest in the G 1 phase...|$|R
40|$|Dermatofibromas are benign, fibrohistiocytic, dermal tumors. Solitary dermatofibromas may be {{incidental}} findings, whereas multiple dermatofibromas may {{be associated}} with systemic conditions or previous therapies. Two women and one man with multiple dermatofibromas and an associated systemic condition, immunosuppression, or both, are described. Nine dermatofibromas developed in a woman with hypothyroidism, optic neuritis, and Arnold Chiari I malformation. Five dermatofibromas developed in a woman with breast cancer who had received several systemic <b>antineoplastic</b> <b>therapies.</b> Eleven dermatofibromas developed in a man with HIV whose systemic therapies included acyclovir, darunavir/cobicistat, dolutegravir, etravirine, and ritonavir. Conditions associated with multiple dermatofibromas include autoimmune diseases, cancer, chromosomal abnormalities, immunodeficiencies, metabolic disturbances, and altered physiologic states such as pregnancy. Medications received by patients with multiple dermatofibromas included immunosuppressive agents, psoriasis <b>therapies,</b> and <b>antineoplastic</b> drugs. Multiple dermatofibromas can be observed in patients with associated medical conditions, systemic therapies, or both. Therefore, in individuals presenting with multiple dermatofibromas, not only evaluation for associated disorders, but also review of prior and current drug therapies, should be considered...|$|R
