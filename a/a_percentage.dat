5|$|With {{the loss}} to Baldomir, it {{appeared}} that Judah's much anticipated bout with Mayweather was off, but Judah's promoter Don King and Mayweather's promoter Bob Arum reworked the deals so the fight would go on. Mayweather was scheduled to earn a minimum $6 million while Judah was to earn $3 million plus <b>a</b> <b>percentage</b> of the profits, but because of Judah's loss, Mayweather earned a minimum $5 million while Judah was guaranteed $1 million plus <b>a</b> <b>percentage</b> of profits above $7 million.

5|$|A major {{difference}} from the US Navy tables is that the repetitive group designators represent nitrogen levels in all tissues, unlike the USN table which represent only the 120-minute compartment. The Huggins repetitive group indicates <b>a</b> <b>percentage</b> of the M0 for the most saturated tissue, and this is intended to make the tables more applicable to multilevel diving procedures.|$|E
5|$|All three {{leaders of}} North Korea—Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il, and Kim Jong-un—have been smokers {{and the country}} has {{struggled}} to balance their public image with its anti-smoking efforts. In general, North Koreans tend to prefer strong tobacco and different classes of quality range from homegrown to sought-after foreign brands that are considered status symbols.

The financial cost of the war to the Australian government was £188,480,000.|$|E
30|$|As expected, {{the plot}} shows that COL uses more flops than SRE. <b>As</b> <b>percentage</b> overlap increases, {{the number of}} flops in COL {{decreases}} {{because the number of}} the matched stereo pairs per landmark becomes larger. Therefore, given the same number of measurements, the number of the landmark parameters becomes smaller. <b>As</b> <b>percentage</b> overlap increases, the number of flops in SRE increases because more matrix inversion operations are needed in the implicit LS algorithm. The accuracy analysis is presented in Auto-calibration results section.|$|R

30|$|From Figure  4, the Otung model {{tends to}} {{overestimate}} the measured data for <b>a</b> lower <b>percentage</b> of time {{due to high}} Nwet values.

5000|$|Although the {{statistic}} {{is called}} [...] "save percentage", it is given as a decimal (in {{the same way}} as <b>an</b> on-base <b>percentage</b> in baseball).

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>percentage</b> of {{each group}} working in less {{contaminated}} areas was badged. Eventually, 18,875 film-badge dosimeters were issued to about 15% of the total work force. On {{the basis of this}} sampling, a theoretical total exposure was calculated for each person who did not have a personal badge. As expected, exposures for target ship crewmen who reboarded their ships after Baker were higher than those for support ship crews. The hulls of support ships that entered the lagoon after Baker became so radioactive that sleeping quarters were moved toward the center of each ship. Of the total mass of radioactive particles scattered by each explosion, 85% was unfissioned plutonium which produces alpha radiation not detected by film badges or Geiger counters. There was no method of detecting plutonium in a timely fashion, and participants were not monitored for ingestion of it.|$|E
