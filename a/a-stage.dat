50|$|The adsorption/bio-oxidation {{process is}} a {{two-stage}} modification of the activated sludge process used for wastewater treatment. It consists of a high-loaded <b>A-stage</b> and low-loaded B-stage. The process is operated without a primary clarifier, with the <b>A-stage</b> being an open dynamic biological system. Both stages have separate settling tanks and sludge recycling lines, thus maintaining unique microbial communities in both reactors.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>A-stage,</b> or {{adsorption}} {{stage is}} the most innovative component of the process. It is not preceded by primary treatment. [...] Influent organic matter is removed in the <b>A-stage</b> mainly by flocculation and sorption to sludge due to the high loading rates (2-10 g BOD • g VSS−1 • d−1) and low sludge age (typically 4-10 h). Hydrolysis of complex organic molecules occurs improving biodegradability of the influent of the B-stage. High loading rates and low sludge age favours development of dynamic biocoenosis with a large fraction of microorganisms present in the exponential growth phase. Diverse sludge biocoenosis increase variety of organic compounds that can be degraded in the <b>A-stage</b> and makes the process more stable towards the shock loads. Altogether, up to 80% of the influent organic matter can be removed in the <b>A-stage.</b> The required reactor volume and oxygen supply are lower if compared to the removal in the conventional activated sludge process.|$|E
50|$|The sludge {{age of the}} B-stage is {{typically}} between 8 and 20 days promoting the growth of nitrifiers. Therefore, complete nitrification is usually achieved in the B-stage. Complete denitrification is difficult to achieve, because of the low C:N ratio in the influent of the B-stage. Insufficient carbon supply of carbon source to the B-stage occurs due to the high efficiency of organic matter removal in the <b>A-stage.</b> The problem can be solved by decreasing organic matter removal in the <b>A-stage,</b> external carbon source supply, intermittent aeration or decreased HRT of the <b>A-stage</b> and/or on-line control of certain operational parameters.

Fifty-four patients with gastric cancer were enrolled at the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University between January and June 2013. Patients were imaged preoperatively with conventional computed tomography (CT) scans and DECT, and the IC in perigastric fat adjacent to the tumor calculated from arterial phase (AP) and portal venous phase (PVP) images. The patients subsequently received surgical treatment (gastrectomy), and histologic analysis of resected specimens was used as a 'gold standard' reference for cancer staging. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was employed to assess the utility of DECT for identifying T 4 <b>a-stage</b> gastric cancer, with optimal IC thresholds determined from the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Postoperative histology revealed that 32 patients had serosal invasion (group A), and 22 did not (group B).

40|$|The {{wastewater}} {{infrastructure in}} Singapore {{is undergoing a}} major revamp, which includes {{the construction of a}} new water reclamation plant (WRP) in Tuas. This plant aims to maximise the energy recovered from wastewater, with the ultimate aim of achieving energy self-sufficiency. The Integrated Validation Plant (IVP) is a 1000 m 3 /day pilot plant equipped with an AB configuration. The <b>A-stage</b> biosorption process increases the amount of COD recovered in the primary sludge to increase biogas production, whereas the B-stage membrane bioreactor (MBR) treats the wastewater using activated sludge. The effluent then undergoes reverse osmosis (RO) to produce potable water. This report investigates the biological treatment process in the IVP and aims to answer the following question: Given that most WRP in Singapore uses the Modified Ludzack-Ettinger configuration (MLE; also known as the pre-denitrification configuration) for the B-stage, will a change in configuration reduce net energy consumption while achieving good effluent quality? The research is divided into three main parts with the following objectives: 1. To create and calibrate a Biowin model to simulate the biological treatment process in the IVP 2. To optimise the MBR B-stage by finding the configuration and operating conditions that requires the least influent COD to achieve acceptable effluent quality (in terms of COD, nitrogen and phosphorus), and to determine the appropriate changes in the <b>A-stage</b> (if any) that is required to achieve this effluent quality 3. To explore issues facing the IVP and future developments of wastewater treatment in Singapore – effect of an unaerated deoxygenation tank, feasibility of mainstream Anammox, and modification of the treatment process to reduce chemical dosage in the downstream RO process The Biowin model for the MBR was first calibrated using jar tests and oxygen uptake tests, then validated with profile studies that are being carried out in the MBR regularly. It was found that Biowin is able to model the biological treatment process relatively well, with the major discrepancy being that Biowin is not able to model ammonia adsorption onto activated sludge in the anoxic zone. With the calibrated model, various configurations and operating conditions were simulated to optimise the MBR. It was found that the optimal configuration is the Anoxic-Oxic-Anoxic-Oxic (AOAO) configuration with a step feed of 50 % of the influent entering the first anoxic zone and 50 % entering the second anoxic zone. The return activated sludge (RAS) flow should be 73 % of the influent flow and the DO in the aerated tanks should be maintained at 1 mg/l. As the biosorption tank at the IVP is not functioning well, data was obtained from another biosorption pilot plant in Singapore to calibrate the <b>A-stage.</b> Using this calibrated biosorption model, the optimal MBR configuration, and the typical raw influent characteristics for the IVP, it was determined that a functioning biosorption stage will result in insufficient COD entering the MBR for sufficient phosphorus removal. To achieve the required effluent quality, the best option during steady state operations would be to reduce the sludge retention time (SRT) of the biosorption process from 0. 5 days to 0. 32 days by increasing sludge wastage as this leads to the highest overall COD recovery. On the other hand, the best method to cope with sudden increases in the nitrogen and phosphorus load in the raw influent would be to partially bypass the biosorption tank and divert some of the raw influent to the primary clarifier as this option results in the fastest response in the effluent quality. As the membrane tanks in the MBR are aerated to scour the membranes and minimise fouling, the mixed liquor in the tanks have a high concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO). A small deoxygenation tank is installed after the membrane tanks to allow DO to deplete before the mixed liquor is recycled back to the anoxic zone at the start of the MBR. However, the deoxygenation tank is not functioning well due to the presence of a cascade overflow from the membrane tanks. Simulations show that the presence of residual DO in the recycle stream leads to a large deterioration the biological phosphorus removal performance of the MBR, mainly due to reduced COD availability for the polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs). Modifications to reduce the impact of the cascade include the installation of baffle walls, slopes, or overflow pipes. One of the technologies for B-stage that can allow even higher COD recovery is mainstream Anammox for nitrogen removal, which consumes less COD than conventional nitrogen-removal processes. As it works best at temperatures of about 30 oC, it may be suitable for implementation in Singapore where the average wastewater temperature is about 31 oC. Biowin simulations revealed that mainstream Anammox can occur under the local conditions, with CANON and DEMON configurations being more suitable than the SHARON-Anammox configuration. However, a very high solids removal efficiency in the primary clarifier is required to remove sufficient COD in the <b>A-stage</b> for Anammox to develop in the B-stage. Further studies would be required to determine if this is achievable under local conditions. Lastly, the MBR effluent is sent to a RO process to be reclaimed as potable water. Ammonia and sodium hypochlorite is first added to produce chloramine to prevent biofouling and provide the necessary residual disinfection. it was found that the ammonia concentration in the MBR effluent can be increased sufficiently to remove the need for ammonia dosage. However, the reduced nitrification also resulted in a higher nitrite concentration in the effluent, increasing the amount of sodium hypochlorite needed to produce the required chloramine as sodium hypochlorite also oxidises nitrite into nitrate. In addition, the dosage of anti-scalants can be reduced with better phosphorus removal as the lower effluent phosphorus leads to less scaling potential in the RO process by calcium phosphate.

Forward osmosis concentrated the total COD {{by a factor of}} 8. 2 ± 1. 2, 10. 1 ± 2. 4 and 4. 8 ± 0. 2 with respect to the raw streams of wastewater, secondary sludge and A-sludge. The soluble fraction of the COD was concentrated up to 3. 5 times in the A-sludge and 2. 1 times in the secondary sludge; the result of a combined effect of the chemical action of Mg 2 + (diffused from the DS) on sludge disaggregation and cell lysis, and the physical action of recirculation and air-scouring of the A-sludge in the FO-unit. The FO-concentrated A-sludge produced 445 ± 22 mg COD-VFA g- 1 CODfed, which was 4. 4 times higher than for the untreated A-sludge. No VFA were produced from untreated secondary sludge, but after FO-concentration 71 ± 5 mg COD-VFA g- 1 CODfed could be reached.

Oncolytic virotherapy using replication-competent vaccinia virus (VACV) strains is a promising new strategy for therapy {{of a variety of}} human cancers. Methods: Oncolytic efficacy of replication-competent vaccinia virus GLV- 1 h 68 was analyzed in both, cell cultures and subcutaneous xenograft tumor models. Results: In this study we demonstrated {{for the first time that}} the replication-competent recombinant VACV GLV- 1 h 68 efficiently infected, replicated in, and subsequently lysed various human colorectal cancer lines (Colo 205, HCT- 15, HCT- 116, HT- 29, and SW- 620) derived from patients at all four stages of disease. Additionally, in tumor xenograft models in athymic nude mice, a single injection of intravenously administered GLV- 1 h 68 significantly inhibited tumor growth of two different human colorectal cell line tumors (Duke’s type <b>A-stage</b> HCT- 116 and Duke’s type C-stage SW- 620), significantly improving survival compared to untreated mice. Expression of the viral marker gene ruc-gfp allowed for real-time analysis of the virus infection in cell cultures and in mice. GLV- 1 h 68 treatment was well-tolerated in all animals and viral replication was confined to the tumor. GLV- 1 h 68 treatment elicited a significant up-regulation of murine immune-related antigens like IFN-γ, IP- 10, MCP- 1, MCP- 3, MCP- 5, RANTES and TNF-γ and a greater infiltration of macrophages and NK cells in tumors as compared to untreated controls. Conclusion: The anti-tumor activity observed against colorectal cancer cells in these studies was a result of direct viral oncolysis by GLV- 1 h 68 and inflammation-mediated innate immune responses. The therapeutic effects occurred in tumors regardless of the stage of disease from which the cells were derived.

40|$|Conventional {{wastewater}} treatment plants (WWTPs), like activated sludge systems, are energy demanding requiring a large electrical energy supply (e. g. 25 kWh PE- 1 year- 1) which, especially during peak-load periods, may account for an important quote of the grid installed power of the surrounding area. Only across the EU, there are 16000 WWTPs that consume around 10000 GWh year- 1 of electricity. Furthermore, the volume of wastewater treated in WWTPs in the EU is increasing with a rate of around 7 % each year. Besides the related financial costs, this energy consumption creates an additional environmental burden. Considering that energy in Europe is mainly produced from the burning of fossil fuels, it has been calculated that energy consumption from WWTPs creates emissions of more than 27 Mtonnes year- 1 of CO 2 in the EU. Concerns about greenhouse gas emissions on a global level and cost issues on a microeconomic level have become major driving forces towards a more efficient usage of energy in {{wastewater treatment}}. In conventional wastewater treatment about 50 % of the energy input is consumed in the aeration systems in order to remove organic matter (Chemical Oxygen Demand, COD) while about 25 % is consumed in the nitrogen removal process (nitrification/denitrification) (Siegrist et al., 2008). Autotrophic nitrogen removal by anammox bacteria is to date the most efficient and environmentally friendly process {{for the treatment of}} ammonium in wastewaters and its application can save up to 60 % of the energy input needed for nitrification. Application of anammox to municipal sewage treatment appears as a prerequisite to allow treatment scenarios for {{wastewater treatment plants}} with a net energy production (Kartal et al., 2010 a). In a treatment scheme where nitrogen is removed via an autotrophic metabolic pathway such as partial nitritation/anammox (PN/anammox),the COD load, which is conventionally oxidized to C 02 partly with oxygen and partly with nitrate (N 03 -) in the denitrification process, can be used to generate energy in the form of methane-rich biogas via the anaerobic digestion process. Whilst the application of anammox related technologies in the side-stream is at present state of the art, the feasibility of this energy-efficient process in main-stream conditions is still under investigation. Lower and variable operating temperatures and ammonium concentrations, together with a demand for high and stable nitrogen removal efficiency, represent the main challenges to overcome for this appealing new frontier of the waste water treatment field. The research described in this thesis aimed at investigating the physiology and kinetic properties of anammox bacteria and their interaction with other microbial communities under municipal wastewater conditions with the ultimate scope of elucidating the boundary conditions for the application of the anammox-based process (PN/anammox) in the treatment of municipal sewage. This fundamental knowledge allow to design and successfully implement at lab- and pilot-scale the completely autotrophic nitrogen removal process for the treatment of municipal sewage. This thesis comprises therefore both fundamental and applied research which main results and achievements are briefly illustrated in this summary. Although anammox related technologies are currently widely applied for nitrogen removal from sewage sludge digester rejection water, many aspects of the anammox process like the kinetic characteristics and the reaction stoichiometry are still under investigation. Parameter values reported in literature are often influenced by mass transfer limitation or by the presence of inactive cells and a significant side population. In Chapter 2 a membrane bioreactor (MBR) based method for growing a highly enriched anammox microbial community is described. The almost pure free­cell suspension of highly active anammox bacteria was used for detailed kinetic and stoichiometric analysis of the anammox process. The yield of biomass production on ammonium uptake was calculated to be 0. 071 C-mol N-mol- 1, value that was then experimentally confirmed in Chapter 3. The elemental biomass composition was measured as CH 1. 740 o. 31 No. 20 So. 01 Po. 01 (22. 1 g C-mol- 1). From the yield and the elemental biomass composition the macro-chemical reaction equation was identified and validated by long-term reactor operations. The anammox culture described in Chapter 2 exhibited an unreported high biomass specific maximum growth rate of 0. 21 d- 1 corresponding to a doubling time of 3. 3 days at 30 °C. Using an experimental methodology based on imposing dynamic process conditions combined with process modeling and parameter estimation, the intrinsic nitrite half saturation constant was identified to be as low as 35 µg-N L- 1. This was confirmed to be a stable value in the tested pH range of 6. 8 - 7. 5. Using the same system, in Chapter 3 the stoichiometric and kinetic properties of a suspended anammox enrichment culture were investigated at decreasing solid retention times. This procedure enabled the maximum growth rate (µmax) of the anammox enrichment culture to increase to 0. 334 d- 1, which is four times higher than previously reported in literature and almost 60 % higher than observed in Chapter 2. Even though researchers have speculated about the possibility of higher rates before, these speculations were always based on indirect measurements of the kinetic properties. Herewith Chapter 3 reports the first direct experimental evidence for a significant increase in growth rate of an anammox enrichment culture. Since the biomass yield of the enrichment culture established is largely comparable to previous studies, it can be concluded that the increased growth rate results from an equivalent increase in biomass specific electron transfer capacity. Detailed molecular analysis did not reveal either a shift in dominant anammox strain nor major mutations in the dominant strain, suggesting that the actual reasons for the increase in electron transfer capacity is due to small changes in the metabolic machinery. The dominant strain throughout this experiment was closely related to Candidatus Brocadia Sp. 40 (99 % similarity). In this study anammox bacteria were cultivated applying a novel selection strategy based on the maximization of the electron transfer capacity demonstrating that maximum growth rate is not an intrinsic process property but that it can be increased significantly when the adequate cultivation conditions are imposed. The anammox enrichment became faster through training showing kinetics comparable with other chemolithoautotrophs and it is thereby concluded that anammox can no longer be regarded as intrinsically slow growing microorganism. Nitrite {{is one of the main}} substrates of the anammox metabolism, but it is also an inhibitor. Its negative effect on anammox activity has been reported widely during the past decade. Although the adverse effect is clear, conflicting reports exist on the level at which it occurs and its reversible/irreversible nature. In order to elucidate this important aspect, an in-depth study on nitrite inhibition was performed in which the influence of environmental factors was evaluated (Chapter 4). Anammox activity was measured in anammox granules by continuously monitored standardized manometric batch tests extending the interpretation by evaluation of lag times, maximum conversion rates during the tests and substrates/product conversion ratios. The granules, dominated by anammox organisms belonging to the Brocadia type, where sampled from a single-stage anammox full-scale reactor. The observed 50 % activity inhibition for nitrite (IC 50) was 0. 4 g-N L- 1. It was shown that biomass relatively quickly (and totally) recovers from high nitrite concentrations. The recovery after exposure indicates that the adverse effect of nitrite is reversible and thus inhibitory rather than toxic in nature. The effect of the presence of ammonium and oxygen during nitrite exposure has also been evaluated. Similarities between exposures at three different pH values suggest that nitrite rather than nitrous acid is the actual inhibiting compound. Overall the results reported in Chapter 4 further underline that the anammox process can be a stable process not prone to temporarily adverse effects of oxygen and nitrite in the reactors. From our experience and previous observations we speculate that cultivation conditions and status of aggregation influence the inhibitory effect of nitrite and that in several cases where high nitrite is reported as a cause of activity loss, it might well be that activity loss has resulted in the accumulation of high nitrite concentrations rather than causing them. The temperature effect on anammox activity is a crucial aspect that needs to be clarified for the successful implementation of anammox related processes at mainstream conditions. Lower operating temperatures in fact, together with lower ammonium concentrations and the demand for high and stable nitrogen removal efficiency, represent the main challenges to overcome for this appealing new frontier of the waste water treatment field. In Chapter 5 is reported the short-term effect of temperature on the maximum biomass specific activity of anaerobic ammonium oxidizing bacteria as evaluated by means of batch tests. The experiments were performed on anammox biomass sampled from two full-scale reactors and two lab-scale reactors, all characterized by different reactor configurations and operating conditions. The results indicate that in the temperature range of 10 - 30 °C the temperature dependency for the anammox conversion cannot be accurately modeled by one single Arrhenius coefficient (i. e. ?) as typically applied for other biological processes. The temperature effect is increasing at lower temperatures, complicating the implementation of a stable mainstream process in winter conditions. Nevertheless, we observed adaptation of anammox bacteria after long term cultivation at 20 and 10 °C indicating that also the history of the sludge impacts the temperature effect. Anammox sludge cultivated in an aerated partial nitritation/anammox process and/or in biofilm seemed to be less influenced by a decrease in temperature then anammox sludge grown under non aerated conditions and/or in suspension. The results reported in Chapter 5 indicate that the temperature effect is stronger for anammox than for ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB), suggesting that, in order to maintain overall a good nitrogen removal along daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations, process control to balance the activity of both microbial groups needs to be adaptive to changes in relative rates of the two processes. Implications for modeling and process design are finally discussed. In Chapter 6 the application of the single-stage PN/anammox process at conditions relevant for sewage treatment was investigated in a lab-scale gas-lift sequencing batch reactor with granular sludge operated for more than 500 days. The reactor was operated at temperatures between 20 and 10 °C and fed with synthetic autotrophic medium with ammonium (60 and 160 mg-N L- 1 as only nitrogen compound at an HRT of 0. 23 - 0. 3 d. In the presence of ammonium dissolved oxygen was shown to be an effective control parameter, even at higher level than previously assumed (up to 2. 5 mg-O 2 L- 1, for the suppression of the undesired nitratation process catalyzed by nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB). This control strategy guaranteed the effective suppression of the nitratation process both at 20 and 15 °C, allowing nitrogen removal rates of 0. 44 and 0. 40 g-NTot L- 1 d- 1. Unlike previously reported, these high removal rates were obtained together with optimal nitrogen removal efficiencies of 86 and 73 %, respectively, fulfilling a decisive prerequisite for the implementation of the PN/anammox process in the main-stream of WWTPs. Anammox bacteria were shown to grow in the system, with estimated growth rate of 0. 017 d- 1 at 15 °C. Operating conditions influencing N 20 emissions were also investigated and resulted in the observation of a positive correlation with the nitrite concentration in the bulk whilst no clear correlation could be noticed between N 20 emissions and DO concentration or temperature. Unfortunately prolonged operation at 10 °C caused a slow but unrestrainable decrease in anammox activity and process efficiency. Nevertheless, since in general these temperatures (winter conditions) do not extend over long time in moderate climates this is not seen as a limitation for the applications of anammox-based technologies in the mainstream of wastewater treatment plants. Chapter 6 represents therefore a proof of concept for the application of the autotrophic nitrogen removal in a single reactor with granular sludge at mainstream conditions. The next logical step in this challenging exploration of anammox bacteria capabilities was to investigate their behavior in the real mainstream of a sewage treatment plant. In Chapter 7 we report the evaluation of the anammox process in a granular sludge fluidized bed lab-scale reactor continuously fed with the actual effluent of the <b>A-stage</b> of the WWTP of Dokhaven, Rotterdam (The Netherlands). In order to exclude the influence of oxygen and the competition for nitrite on anammox growth, the reactor was anoxic and nitrite was dosed continuously to support anammox activity only. The effect of influent COD and related heterotrophic growth by denitrification was instead included in the evaluation. The exclusion of oxygen was also intended in order to better evaluate the effect, if any, of potential toxic compounds in wastewater (e. g. from the influent or the addition of polyelectrolyte and technical grade iron salts in the <b>A-stage).</b> The system was operated for more than ten months at temperatures between 20 and 10 °C. Volumetric N-removal rates obtained were comparable or higher than those of conventional N-removal systems, with values higher than 0. 4 g-N L- 1 d- 1 when operated at 10 °C. The biomass specific N-removal rate at 10 °C was on average 50 ± 7 mg-N g-vss- 1 d- 1 during last month of operations, almost two times higher than previously reported activities at this temperature. FISH analysis revealed that the dominant anammox species was Candidatus Brocadia Fulgida throughout the experimentation. Evidence for growth of anammox bacteria at main-stream conditions (i. e. anammox biomass increase and nitrate production in absence of oxygen) was demonstrated for the entire temperature range tested (10 - 20 °C). Capability of granulation in the mainstream matrix under operative conditions was also proved since new granules were shown to be actively formed and efficiently retained in the proposed system. COD was also consumed during the process, but heterotrophs could not outcompete anammox bacteria. In Chapter 7 the capability of anammox bacteria to thrive under municipal wastewater conditions (low temperature, low ammonium concentration and presence of COD) was demonstrated for the first time, opening new perspective for the implementation of a more efficient (municipal) wastewater treatment chain. For the application of the autotrophic nitrogen removal process, the first step of partial nitritation performed by ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB) has to be also accomplished in order to produce the nitrite used in the anammox process. During partial nitritation the nitratation process performed by nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) has to be suppressed. Even though in Chapter 7 it was demonstrated that anammox itself does not represent a problem, the managing of AOB and NOB activities in order to meet effluent standards might prove more complex for the direct application of the partial nitritation-anammox process on municipal wastewater. With the aim of evaluating the coupling of the anammox and partial nitritation processes at municipal wastewater conditions and the simultaneous suppression of the nitratation process, a pilot-scale experimentation was performed. In Chapter 8 we report the evaluation of the process in a plug-flow granular sludge based pilot-scale reactor (4 m 3) continuously fed with the actual effluent of the <b>A-stage</b> of the WWTP of Dokhaven, Rotterdam. The one-stage partial nitritation-anammox system was operated for more than ten months at 19 ± 1 °C. Observed average N-removal and ammonium conversion rates were comparable or higher than those of conventional N-removal systems, with 182 ± 46 and 315 ± 33 mg-N L- 1 d- 1 respectively. Furthermore, considering the higher biomass concentration obtainable in granular systems and the possibility for further anammox enrichment in the biomass, kinetics much higher than conventional systems appear to be feasible. BOD was also oxidized in the system with average removal efficiency of 90 %. The system was shown to efficiently retain granules enriched in anammox bacteria with a small fraction of nitrifiers and heterotrophs located in the outer rim. At the same time, suspended flocs enriched in heterotrophs, and a small fraction of nitrifiers, were preferentially washed-out, allowing the system to withstand occasional COD and solids shock loads. The results reported in Chapter 8 show that the proposed reactor configuration with granular sludge has the potential to be successfully applied for the completely autotrophic nitrogen removal from the mainstream of WWTPs. In summary, the research described in this thesis showed for the first time the feasibility of an innovative technology for the removal of nitrogen from wastewater and posed a solid background to open de facto a new era in which the treatment of wastewater will move from the actual energy depleting to an energy generating process.
