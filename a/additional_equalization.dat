50|$|The Act of Union {{which took}} effect on 1 December 1918 made Iceland {{a state in}} {{personal}} union with the king of Denmark. It was set to expire after 25 years, when either state could choose to leave the union. The Althing was granted unrestricted legislative power. In 1920 the number {{of members of the}} Althing was increased to 42. Since 1945, the Althing has customarily assembled in the autumn. With the Constitutional Act of 1934 the number of members was increased by seven and the system of national representatives abolished in favour of one providing for eleven seats used to equalize discrepancies between the parties' popular vote and the number of seats they received in the Althing, raising the number of members of the Althing to 49. In 1934, the voting age was also lowered to 21. Further changes in 1942 provided for additional three members and introduced proportional representation in the double-member constituencies. The constituencies were then 28 in number, 21 single-member constituencies, six double-Member constituencies and Reykjavík, which elected eight members. With the <b>additional</b> eleven <b>equalization</b> seats, the number of members was thus 52.|$|R

50|$|One {{benefit of}} the wOOx bass {{radiator}} (and passive radiators in general) {{when compared to the}} more common bass-reflex vents {{is that there is no}} possibility of air turbulence noise if the resonant system is greatly excited. As a result, <b>additional</b> <b>equalization</b> applied near the enclosure's tuning frequency can increase system output without generating extraneous noises or greatly increasing cone excursion of the active driver. Many wOOx-equipped mini-stereo systems produced by Philips feature a three-level equalization control which applies additional bass equalization at frequencies which excite the wOOx bass radiator, improving the visceral 'impact' of the bass through the wOOx radiator's extreme air displacement capability. This use of active equalization to increase overall system output is the primary characteristic that differentiates wOOx technology from typical loudspeaker systems equipped with passive radiators.|$|E

40|$|High-speed serial {{input-output}} (I/O) link {{has required}} advanced equalization and modulation techniques to mitigate inter-symbol interference (ISI) caused by multi-Gb/s signaling over band-limited channels. Increasing demands for transceiver power and area complexity has leveraged on-going interest in analog-to-digital converter (ADC) based link, {{which allows for}} robust equalization and flexible adaptation to advanced signaling. With diverse options in ISI control techniques, link performance analysis for complicated transceiver architectures is very important. This work presents advanced statistical modeling for ADC-based link, performance comparison of existing modulation and equalization techniques, and proposed hybrid ADC-based receiver that achieves further power saving in digital equalization. Statistical analysis precisely estimates high-speed link margins at given implementation constrains and low target bit-error-rate (BER), typically ranges from 1 e- 12 to 1 e- 15, by applying proper statistical bound of noise and distortion. The proposed statistical ADC-based link modeling utilizes bounded probability density function (PDF) of limited quantization distortion (4 - 6 bits) through digital feed-forward and decision feedback equalizers (FFE-DFE) to improve low target BER estimation. Based on statistical modeling, this work surveys the impact of insufficient equalization, jitter and crosstalk on modulation selection among two and four level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM- 2 and PAM- 4, respectively) and duobinary, and ADC resolution reduction performance by partial analog equalizer (PAE). While the information of channel loss at effective Nyquist frequency and signaling constellation loss initially guides modulation selection, the statistical analysis results show that PAM- 4 best tolerates jitter and crosstalk, and duobinary requires the least equalization complexity. Meanwhile, despite robust digital equalization, high-speed ADC complexity and power consumption is still a critical bottleneck, so that PAE is necessitated to reduce ADC resolution requirement. Statistical analysis presents up to 8 -bit resolution is required in 12. 5 Gb/s data communications at 46 dB of channel loss without PAE, while 5 -bit ADC is enough with 3 -tap FFE PAE. For optimal ADC resolution reduction by PAE, digital equalizer complexity also increases to provide enough margin tolerating significant quantization distortion. The proposed hybrid receiver defines unreliable signal thresholds by statistical analysis and selectively takes <b>additional</b> digital <b>equalization</b> to save potentially increasing dynamic power consumption in digital. Simulation results report that the hybrid receiver saves at least 64 % of digital equalization power with 3 -tap FFE PAE in 12. 5 Gb/s data rate and up to 46 dB loss channels. Finally, this work shows the use of embedded-DFE ADC in the hybrid receiver is limited by error propagation...|$|R

It must be remarked, though, that depending on the selected transmit and receive filters, the reconstructed symbols may differ from the transmitted ones. This typically occurs when the composite end-to-end pulse shape response does not ensure proper time and frequency orthogonality, thus leading to inter-symbol and inter-carrier interference.

40|$|Abstract—Discrete multitone {{modulation}} transceivers (DMTs) {{have been}} shown to be very useful for data transmission over frequency selective channels. The DMT scheme is realized by a transceiver that divides the channel into subbands. The efficiency of the scheme depends on the frequency selectivity of the transmit-ting and receiving filters. The receiving filters with good stopband attenuation are also desired for combating narrowband noise. The filterbank transceiver or discrete wavelet multitone (DWMT) system has been proposed as an implementation of the DMT transceiver that has better frequency band separation, but usually, inrtersymbol interference (ISI) cannot be completely canceled in these filterbank transceivers, and <b>additional</b> <b>equalization</b> is required. In this paper, we show how to use over interpolated filterbanks to design ISI-free FIR transceivers.

With the insertion of a guard time of a sufficient duration it becomes posssible {{to cope with the}} severe artificial self interference in a spectral efficient Single Frequency Network (SFN). No intersymbol interference is caused in channels whose impulse response is shorter than the guard time. However, OFDM is sensitive to interference caused by echos longer than the guard interval. One solution to restore the degradation due to this interference is to employ <b>additional</b> <b>equalization.</b> In this thesis different time-domain equalization approaches attempting to cancel echos exceeding the guard time are studied. New equalizer structures which are adapted to the special channel conditions in a SFN are proposed. The symbol error probability for systems with those equalizers is compared to the conventional receiver performance [...] ...|$|E

30|$|Since the {{emphasis}} is placed here on FBMC communication systems, our designs are parameterized by communication and signal-level parameters such as the symbol period or the subcarrier spacing. Moreover, we are interested on the impact these parameters have from an architectural point of view, {{in order to determine}} up to which extent a given combination of these parameters leads to feasible or unfeasible hardware implementations. This is contrast to most existing contributions, where the underlying structure of FBMC communication signals is typically ignored and where the focus is placed on efficient filter designs with the aim of achieving the perfect reconstruction (PR) property [36, 37] (i.e., as pursued in non-communication applications such as speech coding). It {{is interesting to note that}} the PR property is not a mandatory feature in wireless applications, since an <b>additional</b> <b>equalization</b> stage is actually needed at the receiver side to compensate for the frequency selective wireless channel [38, 39].|$|E

Ideally, the ARA headset should be acoustically transparent, that is, it should not cause audible modification to the surrounding sound. A practical implementation of an ARA mixer requires a low-latency headphone reproduction system with <b>additional</b> <b>equalization</b> {{to compensate for the}} attenuation and the modified ear canal resonances caused by the headphones. This paper proposes digital IIR filters to realize the required equalization and evaluates a real-time prototype ARA system. Measurements show that the throughput latency of the digital prototype ARA system can be less than 1. 4 [*]ms, which is sufficiently small in practice. When the direct and processed sounds are combined in the ear, a comb filtering effect is brought about and appears as notches in the frequency response. The comb filter effect in speech and music signals was studied in a listening test and it was found to be inaudible when the attenuation is 20 [*]dB.

30|$|Under {{the age of}} 4 {{years it}} is safe to {{lengthen}} up to 5.0  cm in the tibia; lengthening of > 5.0 cm can lead to growth inhibition in young children [21]. Subsequent lengthenings can be performed preferably 4  years apart as needed to achieve limb length equalization at skeletal maturity. Lengthenings performed at an older age can safely achieve up to 8.0  cm of lengthening. Therefore, one lengthening by age 4 years and one at age 8 years would achieve a total lengthening of 13  cm (5.1 in.) (5.0  +  8.0  cm). One lengthening by age 4 years plus one at age 8 years and one at age 12 years would achieve a total lengthening of 21.0  cm (8.25 in.) (5  +  8  +  8  cm). If <b>additional</b> <b>equalization</b> is required, epiphysiodesis of the opposite proximal tibia can always be considered. Epiphysiodesis is typically performed at a specific age calculated with the Paley multiplier formulae and is usually recommended for up to 5.0  cm (2 in.) of limb length equalization. Therefore, leg length equalization up to 26.0  cm can be achieved with three lengthenings (21  cm) plus an epiphysiodesis (5  cm). This treatment covers the majority of cases with limb length discrepancy due to FH. It is rarely ever necessary to perform more than three limb lengthening procedures to equalize limb length discrepancy due to FH. Cases that present with discrepancies of > 25.0  cm usually have some shortening in the femur, which can be treated with simultaneous or independent lengthening of the femur. This treatment will be discussed in a later section.|$|E
