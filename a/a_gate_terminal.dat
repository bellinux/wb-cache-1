5000|$|Unlike bipolar transistors, JFETs are {{exclusively}} voltage-controlled in {{that they}} do not need a biasing current. Electric charge flows through a semiconducting channel between source and drain terminals. By applying a reverse bias voltage to <b>a</b> <b>gate</b> <b>terminal,</b> the channel is [...] "pinched", so that the electric current is impeded or switched off completely. A JFET is usually on when there is no potential difference between its gate and source terminals. If a potential difference of the proper polarity is applied between its gate and source terminals, the JFET will be more resistive to current flow, which means less current would flow in the channel between the source and drain terminals. Thus, JFETs are sometimes referred to as depletion-mode devices.|$|E

40|$|We numerically {{calculate}} the energy dispersion {{relations of the}} spin-split subbands in a quantum wire subjected to a transverse magnetic field {{in the presence of}} Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions. The spin splitting energy at zero wave vector is found to be neither equal to the bare Zeeman splitting nor linear in the magnetic field in any subband. This happens because the expectation value of the spin angular momentum operator varies along the width of the wire, causing a spatial modulation of the spin density. We also show that spin splitting energy is subband dependent and has a complex dependence on the external magnetic field. In some subbands, it can vanish entirely at nonzero values of the external magnetic field. The effective spin polarization of carriers in any subband can be changed in both magnitude and sign with an external electrostatic potential, applied, for example, via <b>a</b> <b>gate</b> <b>terminal.</b> This has practical applications in quantum computing and other areas...|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} an interacting quantum dot {{working as a}} coherent source of single electrons. The dot is tunnel coupled to a reservoir and capacitively coupled to <b>a</b> <b>gate</b> <b>terminal</b> with an applied ac potential. At low frequencies, this is the quantum analog of the RC circuit with a purely dynamical response. We investigate the quantized dynamics {{as a consequence of}} ac pulses with large amplitude. Within a Keldysh-Green function formalism we derive the time-dependent current in the Coulomb blockade regime. Our theory thus extends previous models that considered either noninteracting electrons in nonlinear response or interacting electrons in the linear regime. We prove that the electron emission and absorption resonances undergo a splitting when the charging energy is larger than the tunnel broadening. For very large charging energies, the additional peaks collapse and the original resonances are recovered, though with a reduced amplitude. Quantization of the charge emitted by the capacitor is reduced due to Coulomb repulsion and additional plateaus arise. Additionally, we discuss the differential capacitance and resistance as a function of time. We find that to leading order in driving frequency the current can be expressed as a weighted sum of noninteracting currents shifted by the charging energy. Comment: 13 pages, 9 figures.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} a computational {{study of the}} feasibility of a molecular transistor. We {{address the question of}} whether a “rigid molecule ” (one which does not deform in an external field) used as the conducting channel in a standard three-terminal MOSFET configuration can offer any performance advantage relative to a standard silicon MOSFET. Our self-consistent solution of coupled quantum transport and Poisson’s equation shows that the presence of <b>a</b> <b>gate</b> <b>terminal</b> induces asymmetry in the (otherwise symmetric) two terminal current-voltage (IV) characteristic. This asymmetry arises because the molecular density of states (DOS) is fixed relative to the source Fermi level for the three terminal case, whereas it is roughly halfway between the source and drain Fermi levels for the two terminal case. We show that just as in a conventional MOSFET, the gate oxide thickness needs to be much smaller (one tenth) than the channel length (length of the molecule) for the gate control to be effective. Furthermore, we show that a rigid molecule is a poor switch with a temperature independent subthreshold slope larger than 60 mV/decade, because the metal-induced gap states in the channel prevent it from turning off abruptly. In short, no particular advantage is gained by using a molecular conductor for an FET channel, except that due to the reduced dielectric constant of the molecular environment. I...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} thermoelectric properties in nanoelectronic devices, specifically setups known as quantum dots. Thermoelectric effects, {{the relation between}} voltage gradients and temperature biases, are investigated. Some useful thermoelectric properties of quantum dots include the ability to extract electrical power from a temperature gradient or transport heat from a cooler region to a warmer, i. e. work as a heat engine or as a heat pump. A quantum dot interacts with its environment through different terminals, e. g. <b>a</b> <b>gate</b> <b>terminal</b> and reservoirs. Quantum dots are an interesting setup for thermoelectric applications due {{to their ability to}} change transport properties when exposed to a gate voltage or a change in characteristics of adjoining reservoirs. The aim {{of this study is to}} find how the characteristic parameters of a quantum dot can be used to control thermoelectric effects. This is essential knowledge when designing systems where quantum dots are wanted to, for example, extract work from a heat flow. The thermoelectric effects are studied using two different methods, namely the master equation and scattering theory. Heat to work conversion and its efficiency is analysed for a set of quantum dot systems. We find the relations between parameters that makes it possible to use quantum dots to either extract electrical work from a heat bath or cool a part of the system. Furthermore, charge and heat separation is studied in a system consisting of a quantum dot, two reservoirs and a voltage probe. This is useful for managing temperatures in circuits doing electrical work. We find it is possible to separate heat and work, but that it requires a certain asymmetry in the system...|$|E
