25|$|In June 2006 the Supreme Court of Serbia {{ruled that}} Milošević {{had ordered the}} murder of Stambolić.

25|$|In 1998 General-Major Radislav Krstić {{was indicted}} for genocide, crimes against {{humanity}} and violations of the laws or customs of war, based on his alleged role in the events {{in and around the}} Bosniak enclave of Srebrenica between 11 July 1995 and 1 November 1995 at the ICTY. On August 2, 2001, after the Trial Chamber was convinced beyond any reasonable doubt that a crime of genocide was committed in Srebrenica, it had convicted Krstić of genocide, who became the first person thus convicted before the Tribunal, and sentenced him to 46 years in prison. The Appeals Chamber had, after upholding the Trial Chamber's finding that Bosnian Serb forces had carried out genocide in Srebrenica, among other things, reduced Krstić’s responsibility for genocide and for the murder of the Bosnian Muslims from that of a direct participant to that of an aider and <b>abettor,</b> and shortened his sentence to 35 years in prison. Krsić was subsequently transferred to the United Kingdom to serve his prison sentence at Wakefield Prison, but was later transferred to Long Lartin Prison.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} {{statutory}} provisions prohibit incitement. Under section 107(a) of the Penal Code, {{a person is}} said to [...] the doing of a thing {{if he or she}} instigates someone to do that thing. If a person abets an offence, and as a result the act abetted is committed, the person is to be punished with the punishment provided for the offence. If the offence is not committed due to the abetment, and it is punishable by imprisonment, the <b>abettor</b> is to be imprisoned for up to a quarter of the maximum jail term of the offence, or may receive a fine, or both. If either the <b>abettor</b> or the person abetted is a public servant whose duty it was to prevent the offence from happening, the <b>abettor</b> may be imprisoned for up to half of the maximum jail term of the offence, or may be fined, or receive both penalties. However, if the offence abetted but not committed is punishable with death or life imprisonment, the <b>abettor</b> is liable to a penalty of up to seven years' imprisonment, a fine, or both. If any hurt is caused {{as a result of the}} abetment, the <b>abettor</b> may be jailed up to 14 years and must also be fined.|$|E

2500|$|London {{was thus}} {{placed in the}} uncomfortable {{position}} of simultaneously being attacked both as a dangerous radical {{on the one hand}} and as a collaborationist traitor to radicalism on the other; as un-American and pro-German {{on the one hand and}} as an American nationalist and <b>abettor</b> of militarism on the other; for subsuming the Socialist program in the interest of the Jews in his district on the one hand and for neglecting the sweeping desire for Jewish nationhood in the interests of socialist internationalism on the other. This proved too much even for the powers of political incumbency to overcome. With the Democratic and Republican parties united behind a single [...] "fusion" [...] candidate and his own supporters fragmented, London narrowly lost reelection in 1918, falling to Henry M. Goldfogle by a tally of 7,269 to 6,519.|$|E
2500|$|In 1687, Howard again {{travelled}} to New York {{to negotiate}} with the Iroquois, with a stop in Philadelphia on the way. Despite his negotiation efforts, Howard was unpopular among Virginians. He ordered {{that no one in the}} colony could use a printing press for any reason and tried to gain the power to overturn laws and levy taxes. [...] Land grants could only be passed if Lord Howard was paid a fee. [...] He created a court of equity and named himself a petty lord chancellor. In 1687, he expelled Colonel Philip Ludwell from the Virginia Council, calling him [...] "an <b>abettor</b> in fomenting disputes over which the Assembly was so obstinate." [...] The expulsion backfired, however, when Ludwell's resultant popularity led to a meeting with King William. A successful meeting with the king led to Ludwell's council seat being restored on 7 May 1691.|$|E
2500|$|Vinko Pandurević - {{found guilty}} of aiding and abetting {{violations}} of the laws or customs of war and crimes against humanity. He was also {{found guilty of}} failing to prevent and punish the crimes of his subordinates. The chamber granted the prosecution’s appeal regarding a variety of incidents, and entered {{a number of new}} convictions. Pandurević was thus found guilty as an aider and <b>abettor</b> or through command responsibility, in relation to various criminal acts, of murder as a violation of the laws or customs of war, extermination as a crime against humanity, and persecution through murder and through cruel and inhumane treatment as a crime against humanity. The chamber entered new convictions for these crimes, and also set aside some of Pandurević’s convictions at trial. In dismissing one of Pandurević’s challenges regarding aiding and abetting, the chamber recalled that [...] "specific direction" [...] is not an element of aiding and abetting under customary international law. His sentence of 13 years of imprisonment was affirmed.|$|E

2500|$|Richard Cohen responded via {{his regular}} Washington Post column {{published}} on February 6, 2007. Cohen {{noted that he}} has dedicated more than 90 columns to condemning antisemitism since he started as a columnist in 1976, [...] "most of them full-throated condemnations of the hatred that killed fully one-third of all Jews during my lifetime. So it comes as a surprise that has {{the force of a}} mugging to be accused of aiding the very people I so hate – of being an <b>abettor</b> of something called The New Anti-Semitism." [...] Cohen wrote that the report [...] "has given license to the most intolerant and narrow-minded of Israel's defenders so that, as the AJC concedes in my case, any veering from orthodoxy is met with censure or, from someone like Reinharz, the most powerful of all post-Holocaust condemnations – anti-Semite – is diluted beyond recognition. The offense here is not just to a handful of relatively unimportant writers, but to memory itself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Liechtenstein has {{previously}} received significant revenues from Stiftungen ("foundations"), which are financial entities created {{to hide the}} true owner of nonresident foreigners' financial holdings. The foundation is registered {{in the name of}} a Liechtensteiner, often a lawyer. [...] This set of laws used to make Liechtenstein a popular tax haven for extremely wealthy individuals and businesses attempting to avoid or evade taxes in their home countries. In recent years, Liechtenstein has displayed a stronger determination to prosecute international money-launderers and has worked to promote the country's image as a legitimate finance center. In February 2008, the country's LGT Bank was implicated in a tax-fraud scandal in Germany, which strained the ruling family's relationship with the German government. Crown Prince Alois has accused the German government of trafficking in stolen goods, referring to its $7.3 million purchase of private banking information offered by a former employee of LGT Group. However, the United States Senate's subcommittee on tax haven banks said that the LGT bank, which is owned by the princely family, and on whose board they serve, [...] "is a willing partner, and an aider and <b>abettor</b> to clients trying to evade taxes, dodge creditors or defy court orders".|$|E

5000|$|The Supreme Court's ruling {{reversed}} a {{long history}} of court decisions and SEC enforcement actions where aiders and <b>abettors,</b> often banks, accountants, trustees, and attorneys, were found liable under Rule 10b-5. The case makes the distinction between primary violators, who directly misstate or omit material facts that are relied upon by investors, and aiders and <b>abettors.</b> According to the court: “A plaintiff must show reliance on the defendant's misstatement or omission to recover under 10b-5. Basic Inc. v. Levinson, supra, at 243. Were we to allow the aiding and abetting action proposed in this case, the defendant could be liable without any showing that the plaintiff relied upon the aider and <b>abettor's</b> statement or actions[...] [...] [...]". When investors relied on such statements or actions, the court extends Rule 10b-5 liability to these secondary participants. The Court stated that [...] "any person or entity, including a lawyer, accountant, or bank, who employs a manipulative device or makes a material misstatement (or omission) on which a purchaser or seller of securities relies may be liable as a primary violator under 10b-5[...] [...]." ...|$|R
