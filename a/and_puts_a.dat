He angrily scolds Mrs. Warbucks, who feebly attempts to justify her vicious orders by {{saying that it was}} a miracle that the Count did not die of poison (Warbucks contradicts her by saying it was a miracle that SANDY didn't die of poison). He then summarily fires the footmen who were ordered to kill the dog on the spot.|$|E
25|$|Differential {{braking systems}} are {{essentially}} an epicyclic transmission {{with a single}} fixed gear ratio transmitted through idler pinions. The controlled differential adds an extension to the rack holding the idlers, <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> conventional brake on that extension. With the brake applied, the idlers are locked and the system works like a conventional epicyclic. When the brake is released, the idlers spin, reducing the speed of rotation on that side. This causes the output on that side to slow down by a fixed amount.|$|E

After dismissing Bouncer, {{he takes}} out a bread roll, lights the fire, <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> rasher of bacon on the gridiron. Overcome with exhaustion, he lies {{down on the bed}} for a catnap. Cox re-enters, having {{unexpectedly}} secured a day off from his employer. He is delighted to find a roll on the table, but surprised to find the fire already lit. Assuming that Bouncer has been using the room in his absence, he takes the bacon off the gridiron, replaces it with a mutton chop, and heads off to his dressing room to retrieve his breakfast utensils.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} {{which is}} growing in practice {{is the use of}} a hollow piercing needle, as is done in body piercing. The piercer disinfects the earlobe with alcohol <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> mark on the lobe with a pen. It gives the opportunity to the client to check whether the position is correct or not. Then, the piercer uses a clamp with flat ends and holes at the end to hold the earlobe, with the dot {{in the middle of the}} holes. This device will support the skin during the piercing process. A cork can be placed behind the earlobe to stop the movement of the needle after the piercing process, and protect the tip of the needle for the client's comfort. Then, the piercer places the hollow needle perpendicular to the skin's surface and check the position of the needle, to pierce at the desired place and the right angle. The piercing process consists of pushing the needle through the earlobe, until it gets out in the other side. The client has to remain still during all the process. Then, the clamp can be put off. After that, the piercer puts the jewel in the hollow needle and pushes the needle through until the jewel enters into the lobe. Then, the needle is removed and disposed properly. The jewel is attached to the lobe and the piercer disinfects the lobe again.|$|E

Michael Scott (Steve Carell) buys a $400 video iPod as his gift to Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), far exceeding the $20 limit.

She reveals {{that she has been}} tortured before, and nothing Sayid does will persuade her to talk. Omar (Navid Negahban), Sayid's friend and superior officer, tells him to execute Nadia. Sayid cuffs Nadia <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> hood over her head. When he and Nadia are alone he frees her and tells her how to escape. Omar finds them but Sayid fatally shoots him. Nadia thinks that Sayid will have to escape with her now, but he instead shoots himself in the leg and tells her to leave as reinforcements arrive, making it appear as if Nadia shot Sayid and the other officer to escape.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{opens in}} the [...] "green reality" [...] (where Rex {{is alive and}} Hannah isn't), with John Cooper (Clifton Powell), a convict that Michael arrested 10 years ago, who is {{transferred}} to a medical clinic for dialysis because he is missing a kidney, by Nancy (Lolly Ward). As the guard takes Copper to the car {{to go back to}} prison, he complains that the prisoner is getting preferential treatment over his mother, who is on the waiting list. As they arrive at the van, Cooper uses a paralytic vial hidden in his bandages to knock one guard out. He takes his gun, and makes the other security guard shut the door. Cooper claims his has [...] "nothing to lose". Later, at home, while Rex's tennis coach Tara (Michaela McManus) takes him to tennis practice, Michael gets a call from Isaiah [...] "Bird" [...] Freeman (Steve Harris), his partner, that Cooper had escaped. Rex and Tara are talking about Rex's guilt about his father, when Cooper hits the car, <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> chemical thing on Tara, and kidnaps Rex.|$|E
500|$|Keith surprises Veronica with {{plane tickets}} to New York. Alicia Fennel (Erica Gimpel) tells Veronica that Wallace has left for Paris to track Jackie. Veronica calls Jackie and tells {{her that she}} knows she was never {{accepted}} to the Sorbonne and asks her to meet Wallace in New York. At Woody's hiding place, Keith attacks and tasers him. However, Woody denies crashing the bus. Veronica sees a little league team picture in Woody's restaurant which suggests that Beaver was on Woody's baseball team and thus connected to the crash. Veronica dashes to the after-graduation party. Beaver and Mac are about to have sex, but while {{she is in the}} shower, Beaver reads a text from Veronica to Mac warning her, and Beaver texts Veronica to meet [...] "her" [...] on the roof. Aaron Echolls threatens Veronica in the elevator. Beaver meets Veronica <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> gun on her. Veronica explains her hypothesis—that he killed Marcos and Peter so they would not spill the news of their molestation, that he got explosives from David [...] "Curly" [...] Moran, convinced the PCHers that Curly destroyed the bus before killing Curly himself, also writing Veronica Mars on his palm.|$|E

However, her father also converts. The locals, who have been stirred up by Takeo, go on a murderous rampage against the family. They first go to the chapel but the newlyweds evade them and so they go to the beach house instead. When the mob reaches his house, Yamaki throws out the Buddha statue he had set up in his house <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> cross in its place.

500|$|A promotional video, {{directed}} by Dawn of the New Assembly/H5, was produced {{to accompany the}} release of [...] "Juxtapozed with U" [...] as a single. According to Gruff Rhys the band made separate videos for Rings Around the Worlds three singles as they saw the videos included on the DVD release of the album as [...] "pure art" [...] whereas they needed promotional music videos that were more like adverts for the songs. The video is computer generated and begins with stylised shots of traffic moving across the Brooklyn Bridge, New York. The camera zooms in to show a man and women, who appear as thermal images, driving one of the cars. The man checks his watch <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> CD in the car's stereo before the video switches to an outside shot of the vehicle driving through a tunnel and a busy street. Another street is shown with many neon signs, including one which says [...] "Broadway" [...] and another with features the legend [...] "Juxtapozed with U, Super Furry Animals". The couple continue driving until they reach the Guggenheim Art Museum where they park beside a valet who opens the car's passenger door. The next shot shows the museum's interior exhibit which consists of a black and neon blue grids with various mathematical symbols and currency signs on the walls. The couple talk {{to one of the}} crowd in the club before leaving the building and walking past the valet to a lift which takes them to a party on the roof of a skyscraper. Shots of a swimming pool on the skyscraper's roof and the couple kissing are intercut with images of fire engines driving through the streets past the Chrysler Building. These fire engines arrive below the skyscraper where the party is taking place and several people, including the couple, look down on them from above. Firemen are shown fighting a blaze on several floors of the skyscraper and a helicopter is seen flying to rescue the partygoers. In the last few seconds of the video the skyscraper explodes and the helicopter crashes into the roof of the building. The Dawn of the New Assembly/H5 video appears on the DVD release of the band's greatest hits album [...] and the Enhanced CD version of the [...] "Juxtapozed with U" [...] single.|$|E

2500|$|The Bolshoi is a {{repertory}} theatre, {{meaning that}} it draws {{from a list of}} productions, any one of which may be performed on a given evening. [...] It normally introduces two to four new ballet or opera productions each season <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> similar number on hold. [...] The sets and costumes for most productions are made in the Bolshoi's own workshops. The performers are drawn primarily from the Bolshoi's regular ballet and opera companies, with occasional guest performances. Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, {{there have been a few}} attempts to reduce the theatre's traditional dependence on large state subsidies. Corporate sponsorship occurs for some productions, but state funding is still the lifeblood of the company.|$|E

[...] Alex Macpherson of The Guardian gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, calling it [...] "a triumphant comeback", describing it as [...] "a high-octane blast on which she is having the time of her life." [...] Alex Nunn of musicOMH called it [...] "a fun, engaging record", [...] "an exuberantly fun album, one that packs more than a fair punch <b>and</b> <b>puts</b> <b>a</b> delightfully perky twist on the direction of former releases 'Let Go' and Under My Skin." ...|$|E
