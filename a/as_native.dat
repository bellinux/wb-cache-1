Nearly as many exotic plants <b>as</b> <b>native</b> ones, 830, have become naturalised on the island, and 50 are considered invasive, threatening native flora and habitats.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Thurman and {{her husband}} moved to San Francisco. She wrote several {{articles}} about their Asian trip, analyzing information, discussing their meeting with Gandhi and pressing for scholarship exchanges for negro students at Indian universities. It was from the Thurmans and their talks and writings that Martin Luther King Jr. learned of non-violent resistance {{as a means of}} social protest. By 1944, the church which they had envisioned after their meeting with Gandhi became a reality when they, along with Fisk, opened the Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples. It was the first interracial, non-denominational church in the United States. While her husband assumed the pastoral duties, Thurman organized forums and lectures for the members to learn about other peoples such <b>as</b> <b>Native</b> Americans, Africans, Asians and their cultures, covering everything from the Jews to the Navajos.|$|E
5|$|Platinum is an {{extremely}} rare metal, occurring at a concentration of only 0.005 ppm in Earth's crust. It is sometimes mistaken for silver. Platinum is often found chemically uncombined <b>as</b> <b>native</b> platinum and as alloy with the other platinum-group metals and iron mostly. Most often the native platinum is found in secondary deposits in alluvial deposits. The alluvial deposits used by pre-Columbian people in the Chocó Department, Colombia are still a source for platinum-group metals. Another large alluvial deposit is in the Ural Mountains, Russia, {{and it is still}} mined.|$|E

5|$|Platinum {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{reactive}} metals. It has remarkable resistance to corrosion, even at high temperatures, and is therefore considered a noble metal. Consequently, platinum is often found chemically uncombined <b>as</b> <b>native</b> platinum. Because it occurs naturally in the alluvial sands of various rivers, it was first used by pre-Columbian South American natives to produce artifacts. It was referenced in European writings as early as 16th century, {{but it was not until}} Antonio de Ulloa published a report on a new metal of Colombian origin in 1748 that it began to be investigated by scientists.|$|E
5|$|Regular {{stocking}} {{since the}} start of the 1980s have re-established reasonable populations of golden perch and Murray cod; native fish that were indigenous to the Molonglo River before the lake was built, but had been lost to mining pollution of the Molonglo River in the first half of the 20th century. The main reason for stocking is to boost fish stocks along the Molonglo, which have been depleted by overfishing, introduced species and habitat destruction. One of the motives for raising the level of Murray cod and golden perch is to balance the ecosystem by having them act <b>as</b> <b>native</b> predators of other fish.|$|E
5|$|The ethnic {{diversity}} of the American AG is increasing; however, its constituency is still largely white.

5|$|The {{increase}} in trade, and new items {{had a significant}} impact on First Nations material cultures, seeing the rise of such traditions as fabric appliqué (Button Blankets), metalwork (Northwest Coast engraved silver jewelry originated around this time <b>as</b> <b>native</b> craftsmen learned to make jewelry from coins), and contributed to a cultural fluorescence with the advent of improved (iron) tools that saw the creative of more and larger carvings (a.k.a.

5|$|In {{addition}} to reporting active processors, Folding@home determines its computing performance as measured in floating point {{operations per second}} (FLOPS) based on the actual execution time of its calculations. Originally this was reported <b>as</b> <b>native</b> FLOPS: the raw performance from each given type of processing hardware. In March 2009 Folding@home began reporting the performance in native and x86 FLOPS, the latter being an estimation of how many FLOPS the calculation would take on a standard x86 CPU architecture, which is commonly used as a performance reference. Specialized hardware such as GPUs can efficiently perform some complex functions in one floating point operation which otherwise needs multiple operations on the x86 architecture. The x86 measurement attempts to even out these hardware differences. Despite conservative conversions, the GPU clients' x86 FLOPS are consistently greater than their native FLOPS and comprise {{a large majority of}} Folding@home's measured computing performance.|$|E
5|$|In the English Civil War, the Parliamentary Army built a {{blockhouse}} at East Mersea in 1648, {{with the}} aim of blockading the River Colne during the Siege of Colchester. Some ruins of this blockhouse remain and are known as the Block House Stone, which is legally protected by English Heritage as a scheduled monument. Fishing grew in importance on the island during this time, with numerous fish weirs being installed. During the 16th and 17th centuries, Dutch and French settlers arrived on the island. Some locals supplemented their income from the oyster trade by smuggling, which remained popular until the mid-19th century. Smugglers favoured the Peldon Rose, immediately north of the Strood, where they would store contraband in the pond alongside the inn. In the early 19th century, the increased demand for oysters despite a limited supply from the Strood and Pyefleet Channel led traders to get oysters from other places and pass them off <b>as</b> <b>native</b> to the island.|$|E

5|$|Music intertwines with {{aspects of}} American social and {{cultural}} identity, including through social class, race and ethnicity, geography, religion, language, gender, and sexuality. The relationship between music and race {{is perhaps the most}} potent determiner of musical meaning in the United States. The development of an African American musical identity, out of disparate sources from Africa and Europe, has been a constant theme in the music history of the United States. Little documentation exists of colonial-era African American music, when styles, songs, and instruments from across West Africa commingled in the melting pot of slavery. By the mid-19th century, a distinctly African American folk tradition was well-known and widespread, and African American musical techniques, instruments, and images became a part of mainstream American music through spirituals, minstrel shows, and slave songs. African American musical styles became an integral part of American popular music through blues, jazz, rhythm and blues, and then rock and roll, soul, and hip hop; all of these styles were consumed by Americans of all races, but were created in African American styles and idioms before eventually becoming common in performance and consumption across racial lines. In contrast, country music derives from both African and European, as well <b>as</b> <b>Native</b> American and Hawaiian, traditions and yet has long been perceived as a form of white music.|$|E
5|$|Pro-slavery advocates {{claimed that}} enslaved Africans were lesser {{human beings who}} benefited from their bondage. Wilberforce, the Clapham Sect and others were anxious to {{demonstrate}} that Africans, and particularly freed slaves, had human and economic abilities beyond the slave trade, {{and that they were}} capable of sustaining a well-ordered society, trade and cultivation. Inspired in part by the utopian vision of Granville Sharp, they became involved in the establishment in 1792 of a free colony in Sierra Leone with black settlers from the United Kingdom, Nova Scotia and Jamaica, as well <b>as</b> <b>native</b> Africans and some whites. They formed the Sierra Leone Company, with Wilberforce subscribing liberally to the project in money and time. The dream was of an ideal society in which races would mix on equal terms; the reality was fraught with tension, crop failures, disease, death, war and defections to the slave trade. Initially a commercial venture, the British government assumed responsibility for the colony in 1808. The colony, although troubled at times, was to become a symbol of anti-slavery in which residents, communities and African tribal chiefs, worked together to prevent enslavement at the source, supported by a British naval blockade to stem the region's slave trade.|$|E
5|$|The Adriatic Sea {{sits on the}} Apulian or Adriatic Microplate, which {{separated}} from the African Plate in the Mesozoic era. The plate's movement contributed {{to the formation of}} the surrounding mountain chains and Apennine tectonic uplift after its collision with the Eurasian plate. In the Late Oligocene, the Apennine Peninsula first formed, separating the Adriatic Basin {{from the rest of the}} Mediterranean. All types of sediment are found in the Adriatic, with the bulk of the material transported by the Po and other rivers on the western coast. The western coast is alluvial or terraced, while the eastern coast is highly indented with pronounced karstification. There are dozens of marine protected areas in the Adriatic, designed to protect the sea's karst habitats and biodiversity. The sea is abundant in flora and fauna—more than 7,000 species are identified <b>as</b> <b>native</b> to the Adriatic, many of them endemic, rare and threatened ones.|$|E
