40|$|The {{viability}} of the human fetus increases significantly beyond 25 weeks' gestation as the lung development progresses towards the 'saccular' stage. We report on a fetus of 22 weeks' gestation whose lung maturation was accelerated by 4 weeks, most likely due to the unintentional exposure to the retinoid isotretinoin (13 -cis-retinoic acid) during pregnancy. Although retinoids {{are known to be}} stored within the lungs and to {{play a key role in}} lung differentiation and growth, their storage within the lung is limited during this critical developmental period. Even though glucocorticosteroids are used clinically to enhance lung maturation in the face of impending preterm birth, there are no data yet which demonstrate that glucocorticosteroids, when given alone, are effective in promoting lung maturation prior to 24 weeks' gestation. Strong evidence however, indicates that glucocorticosteroids promote the utilization of lung retinoids immediately before birth. Our observation of increased lung maturation, in conjunction with the above information suggests that retinoids alone or in combination with glucocorticosteroids might promote lung maturation more effectively than glucocorticosteroids alone when birth seems inevitable at <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>early</b> gestational <b>age...</b>|$|R

30|$|Surgery can {{be safely}} {{performed}} during pregnancy and during the first trimester as well. Mastectomy should not be recommended {{just because of the}} pregnancy itself, and breast conservation should be discussed whenever possible. In patients operated during the third or even the second trimester, radiation therapy {{can be safely}} postponed after delivery [11]. The risk of a possible too long delay of radiation therapy in case of surgery performed at <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>early</b> gestational <b>age</b> should be taken into account and all the options should be considered according to patient’s preference. However, virtually, all patients need adjuvant chemotherapy, bridging the gap between surgery and radiotherapy. Partial breast irradiation, especially with electrons (ELIOT) might be an interesting option in the future even if at the moment there is lack of data and some doubts might be raised regarding treatment of young patients in terms of increased risk of local recurrence. For those patients requiring mastectomy, an immediate breast reconstruction with tissue expander can be performed as it does not excessively increase operative time and risk of complications. Lymphoscintigraphy and sentinel node biopsy by the use of 99 mTc is safe in pregnant patients as well.|$|R
40|$|Objectives]: Mitochondrial {{disorders}} are clinically heterogeneous. We aimed to describe 5 patients who {{presented with a}} clinical picture suggestive of primary neurotransmitter defects but who finally fulfilled diagnostic criteria for mitochondrial disease. [Methods]: We report detailed clinical features, brain magnetic resonance findings and biochemical studies, including cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biogenic amine and pterin measurements, respiratory chain enzyme activity, and molecular studies. [Results]: The 5 patients had <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>early</b> onset <b>age</b> (from 1 day to 3 months) and a severe clinical course. They all showed a clinical picture suggestive of infantile hypokinetic-rigid syndrome (hypokinesia, hypomimia, slowness of reactions, tremor), other abnormal movements (myoclonus, dystonia), axial hypotonia, limb hypertonia, feeding difficulties, and psychomotor delay. Abnormal CSF findings among the 4 patients without treatment included low levels of homovanillic acid (HVA) in 3 patients, with associated low 5 -hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5 -HIAA) concentrations in two of them. Absent or mild and transitory improvement was observed after treatment with l-dopa. A diagnosis of mitochondrial disorder was finally made due to the appearance of hyperlactacidemia, diverse respiratory chain defects, and multisystemic involvement. [Conclusions]: Secondary neurotransmitter disturbances may occur in mitochondrial diseases. Differential diagnosis of hypokinetic-rigid syndrome presenting in infancy could also include paediatric mitochondrial disorders. © 2008 Mitochondria Research Society.

Qualitative research guided the study design which was conducted in a public sector school in Karachi, Pakistan. The data was collected through observations, focus group discussions with children, and semi-structured interviews with the female teacher. The study found that teaching and learning is gendered in single sex settings of the school as gender messages are passed on to the girls, playing an important role in their gender identity construction. The study indicated that the teacher’s personal experiences greatly influenced her perceptions regarding gender identities. There was also evidence that the teacher acquired insights from girls. Additionally, children brought certain perceptions from home which contributed to the gender discourse in the context of a school.

40|$|The {{configurations}} of epidermal ridges that comprise dermatoglyphic traits are, in many respects, {{a history of}} the developmental period during which the ridges form. In 1892 Sir Francis Galton [l] demon-strated that epidermal ridge configurations did not change throughout postnatal life. The fact that ridge configurations were not affected by environment or by age has been an important framework in genetic studies. In 1936, Cummins [2] reported the association of unusual der-matoglyphics with Down syndrome. Confirmation of his findings [3 -_ 51 demonstrated the potential value of dermatoglyphics in clinical med-icine. While not diagnostic alone, dermatoglyphics have been a valuable aid when clinical diagnosis was in doubt. Unusual dermatoglyphics now have been associated with congenital defects of both genetic and en-vironmental origin [6]. Schaumann and Johnson [7] have noted that dermatoglyphics associated with congenital defects are significant mark-ers of prenatal events. Yet, at present {{little is known about the}} atypical developmental processes that have produced these associations. The precise configuration of epidermal ridges and minutiae is determined at <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>early</b> embryonic <b>age,</b> around 10 weeks postfertilization. Ac-cordingly, an understanding of the prenatal morphogenesis of derma-toglyphic traits is fundamental to our interpretation of their variation and their relationship to birth defects. The developmental history of dermatoglyphic traits requires first a background in the normal developmental chronology of prenatal hand. Second, it includes an understanding’of the development of epidermal ridges, the basic building blocks of dermatoglyphic traits, and factors that may influence ridge configuration. The developmental basis of dermatoglyphic traits is fundamental to a better understanding of their variation and relationship to congenital defects...|$|R

These children believed that they were different from each other because of being boys or girls and that they had different roles and responsibilities. Schools were, hence, found promoting those stereotypes regarding gender roles and responsibilities in a social context. All the participants were found to have views and practices around gender positioning which was approved by the larger society.

40|$|Monitoring the {{evolution}} of <b>early</b> <b>age</b> properties of concrete is necessary to provide input data to the models of prediction {{of the behavior of}} concrete structures since setting time. The experimental challenge {{lies in the fact that}} this monitoring must be fully automatic since the <b>earliest</b> <b>age</b> because the hardening process of the concrete takes place continuously over a period counted in hours and even in days after the casting time. This research paper presents a new methodology developed at ULB and IFSTTAR to monitor the creep and relaxation of an ordinary concrete chosen as reference concrete since setting time. Compressive creep rigs and two test devices were used: at ULB, a Temperature Stress Testing Machine (TSTM) specifically designed for testing concrete since setting time under free and restraint conditions and at IFSTTAR, a test set up called BTJASPE developed to monitor, in compression, the modulus of elasticity, the creep and the relaxation of <b>a</b> concrete since <b>very</b> <b>early</b> <b>age.</b> For the sake of the study, the same concrete has been used in the two laboratories. In addition, this study is performed at a constant temperature to exclude this parameter, at this step of the study. The methodology is based on experimental measurements with two kinds of test. A classical creep test with permanent loading during one week and a repeated minute-long loading test for which every 30  min, a loading is applied and kept constant during 5  min and finally totally removed. The classical test is used to characterize the non-aging creep function and the repeated minute-long loading test is used to quantify the aging creep functions.

30|$|The {{concurrent}} {{diagnosis of}} breast cancer and an unexpected early pregnancy represents the most challenging treatment scenario. It is considered that abortion is not a therapeutic procedure in these cases [13], but termination of pregnancy can be considered {{in order to facilitate}} completion of treatment. For patients at the first trimester who desire to continue the pregnancy, treatment is possible but there is a limited number of options during the first weeks of gestation. In fact, chemotherapy is prohibited during the first trimester, and endocrine treatments are not feasible [13, 15]. Surgery is safe at any time and during the first trimester as well [16], but breast conservation performed during <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>early</b> gestational <b>age</b> is associated with a long delay in postoperative radiotherapy. Unfortunately, there is limited and retrospective experience published on the delayed radiotherapy after breast conservation and its effect on outcome. In a study evaluating 568 patients with T 1 –T 2 N 0 breast cancer who underwent lumpectomy and radiotherapy without systemic treatment, similar rate of recurrence was reported in node negative patients when radiotherapy starts up to 16  weeks after definitive surgery after a median follow-up of 11.2  years [17]. Another retrospective study reported on 13, 907 patients aged 65  years or older with stage I–II breast cancer who underwent lumpectomy and radiotherapy taken from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)–Medicare database. The authors concluded that delays of > 3  months were associated with poor survival, even though older age, black race, advanced stage, more comorbidities, and being unmarried were associated with longer time intervals between surgery and RT, and therefore, {{it is not clear whether}} the association is causal or due to confounding factors [18]. Chen et al. [19] performed a systematic review on the relationship between waiting time for radiotherapy and clinical outcomes with special attention on local recurrence. In this meta-analysis considering 20 high quality studies that had adequately controlled for confounding factors, a significant increase of local failure was demonstrated with increasing waiting times. The authors subsequently converted the relative risks derived from the meta-analysis into estimates of the increment in risk attributable to 1  month of the waiting time for RT and this translated into an absolute increase in the risk of local recurrence of 1.0  % per month of delay of staring RT.|$|R
6000|$|In the peloric form of Antirrhinum majus, {{appropriately}} called the" [...] Wonder," [...] the tubular and elongated flowers differ wonderfully {{from those}} of the common snapdragon; the calyx and the mouth of the corolla consist of six equal lobes, and include six equal instead of four unequal stamens. One of the two additional stamens is manifestly formed by the development of a microscopically minute papilla, which may be found {{at the base of the}} upper lip of the flower of the common snapdragons in the nineteen plants examined by me. That this papilla is a rudiment of a stamen was well shown by its various degrees of development in crossed plants between the common and the peloric Antirrhinum. Again, a peloric Galeobdolon luteum, growing in my garden, had five equal petals, all striped like the ordinary lower lip, and included five equal instead of four unequal stamens; but Mr. R. Keeley, who sent me this plant, informs me that the flowers vary greatly, having from four to six lobes to the corolla, and from three to six stamens. (13/71. For other cases of six divisions in peloric flowers of the Labiatae and Scrophulariaceae see Moquin- Tandon 'Teratologie' page 192.) Now, as the members of the two great families to which the Antirrhinum and Galeobdolon belong are properly pentamerous, with some of the parts confluent and others suppressed, we ought not to look at the sixth stamen and the sixth lobe to the corolla in either case as due to reversion, any more than the additional petals in double flowers in these same two families. But the case is different with the fifth stamen in the peloric Antirrhinum, which is produced by the redevelopment of a rudiment always present, and which probably reveals to us the state of the flower, as far as the stamens are concerned, at some ancient epoch. It is also difficult to believe that the other four stamens and the petals, after an arrest of development at <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>early</b> embryonic <b>age,</b> would have come to full perfection in colour, structure, and function, unless these organs had at some former period normally passed through a similar course of growth. Hence it appears to me probable that the progenitor of the genus Antirrhinum must at some remote epoch have included five stamens and borne flowers in some degree resembling those now produced by the peloric form. The conclusion that peloria is not a mere monstrosity, irrespective of any former state of the species, is supported by the fact that this structure is often strongly inherited, as in the case of the peloric Antirrhinum and Gloxinia and sometimes in that of the peloric Corydalis solida.
