40|$|The press {{hardening}} belongs to state-of-the-art technology at {{sheet metal forming}} to gain high strength and crash resistant parts in automotive industry. This process could establish due to its cost- and esourceefficiency. According to ongoing developments on direct {{press hardening}} processes {{it is necessary to}} describe and understand the thermo-mechanical treatment of 22 MnB 5. Therefore the flow behavior and phase transformation during cooling with simultaneous forming is investigated. The experimental process considers industrial parameters in order to get industry-oriented results. In deep drawing processes the sheet metal is roped into <b>the</b> draw <b>die</b> and bended around <b>the</b> <b>die</b> edge. Thereby sheets perform different stages of compressive and tensile strain <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>die</b> oriented <b>side</b> and <b>the</b> punch oriented side of the sheet. There are different stages and values of stress and strain according to several layers of the sheet over its cross-section. The values of stress, strain and forming rate were FEcalculated for industry-relevant bending radii and sheet thicknesses of manganese-boron steel 22 MnB 5. According to the calculations different cooling and forming strategies were performed by dilatometric tests. The forming behavior is described by the microstructural development with regard to the cooling rate and temperature. Beside the influence of austenite forming on the phase transformation and mechanical properties is considered. A prospective view is given to illustrate ongoing examinations under compressive and combined tensional and compressive forces...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} {{our recent}} research on wear <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>die</b> radius in sheet metal stamping. According to wear theory, contact pressure and sliding distance {{are the two}} dominant factors in determining sliding wear. We applied the finite element analysis to accurately quantify the contact pressure and sliding distance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>die</b> radius in sheet metal stamping. The results were then applied to analyze sliding wear <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>die</b> radius. We found that a typical two-peak steady-state contact pressure response exists during a channel forming process. The steady-state contact pressure response was preceded by an initial transient response, which produced extremely large and localized contact pressures. We proposed a method to numerically quantify the sliding distance, which was applied to examine the contact sliding distance <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>die</b> radius. Correlating <b>the</b> contact pressure and sliding distance, a new insight into the wear/galling that occurs <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>die</b> radius in sheet metal stamping was gained. The {{results show that the}} region close to zero degrees on <b>the</b> <b>die</b> radius is likely to experience the most wear, with the identified transient stage contributing to {{a large proportion of the}} total wear...|$|R

40|$|Capillarity, {{acting to}} set {{the shape of the}} melt/gas interfaces, and heat {{transfer}} can interact to cause limits to steady-state growth of thin silicon sheets by the Edge-Defined Film-Fed Growth (EFG) method. A finite-element/Newton solution method for a two-dimensional thermal-capillary model of EFG is used to show that limiting values of pull rate exist beyond which steady-state growth is impossible. The pull rate limit is also predicted by a one-dimensional heat transfer model valid when <b>the</b> <b>die</b> <b>sides</b> and menisci are almost parallel and when the thermal conductivities of melt, crystal, and die are all equal. Both the one- and two-dimensional heat transfer models show that heat loss from the melt is dominated by conduction into the crystal and slow heat release to the ambient {{along the length of the}} ribbon. The limiting pull rate results from the reduced efficiency of conduction through the melt caused by the curvature of the meniscus which increases height of <b>the</b> <b>die</b> top above <b>the</b> level of the melt. Thermal-capillary limits are predicted for both positive and negative pressure differences across the meniscus...|$|R

This lower warpage is maintained even after three sequential lead-free solder reflow conditions. Statistical data supports this increased co-planarity by Shadow MoirÃ© measurements at various stages of processing from as-received parts through prebake, cure, and three-times reflow. Typical co-planarity improvements in the 12 to 65 percent range is observed and verified by confirmation sample sizes used for microwave cured parts and conventional box oven cured parts. Thinned die and reduced thickness substrate boards showed the most warpage improvement with VFM. Two under-fill chemistries (anhydride and hybrid) show the same effect despite lower cure temperatures and faster cure cycle times.
