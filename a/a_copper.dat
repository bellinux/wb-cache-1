Cytochrome c oxidase is the protein that binds the O2 between <b>a</b> <b>copper</b> and an iron; the protein transfers 8 electrons to the O2 molecule to reduce it to two molecules of water.|$|E

5|$|The Great Copper Mountain was a mine in Falun, Sweden, that {{operated}} {{from the}} 10th century to 1992.

5|$|Vanadinite is very brittle, {{producing}} small, conchoidal fragments when fractured. Its hardness is 3–4 on the Mohs scale, {{about the}} same as <b>a</b> <b>copper</b> coin. Vanadinite is particularly heavy for a translucent mineral. It has a molar mass of 1416.27g/mole and its specific gravity can range between 6.6 and 7.2 because of impurities.|$|E
50|$|Copper-{{tungsten}} (tungsten-copper, CuW, or WCu) is <b>a</b> {{mixture of}} <b>copper</b> and tungsten. <b>As</b> <b>copper</b> and tungsten {{are not mutually}} soluble, the material is composed of distinct particles of one metal dispersed in a matrix of the other one. The microstructure is therefore rather a metal matrix composite instead of a true alloy.|$|R

5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century a mine was {{developed}} alongside the River Barle. The mine was originally called Wheal Maria, then changed to Wheal Eliza. It was <b>a</b> <b>copper</b> mine from 1845–54 and then an iron mine until 1857, although the first mining activity on the site may be from 1552. At Simonsbath, a restored Victorian water-powered sawmill, which was damaged in the floods of 1992, has now been purchased by the National Park and returned to working order; it is now {{used to make the}} footpath signs, gates, stiles and bridges for various sites in the park.|$|E

5|$|Many early sources {{gave the}} {{scientific}} {{name of the}} dusky shark as Carcharias (later Carcharhinus) lamiella, which originated from an 1882 account by David Starr Jordan and Charles Henry Gilbert. Although Jordan and Gilbert referred {{to a set of}} jaws that came from a dusky shark, the type specimen they designated was later discovered to be <b>a</b> <b>copper</b> shark (C. brachyurus). Therefore, C. lamiella is not considered a synonym of C. obscurus but rather of C. brachyurus. Other common names for this species include bay shark, black whaler, brown common gray shark, brown dusky shark, brown shark, common whaler, dusky ground shark, dusky whaler, river whaler, shovelnose, and slender whaler shark.|$|E
5|$|Meråker saw in {{industrial}} boom {{due to the}} railway. There was already <b>a</b> <b>copper</b> mine and smelters at Kopperå, and they saw the railway as a possibility to change from locally produced charcoal to imported coke. A pulp mill opened in 1887, but burned down in 1912. The most important industry was the carbide factory that opened in Kopperå in 1900—Meraker Smelteverk. Though located close to the hydroelectricity sources in Meråker, the import and export of raw and finished materials {{would not have been}} possible without the railway. A port for the plant was built at Muruvik in 1918.|$|E
5|$|On 1 March 1847 the Kilmarnock and Troon line reopened, as a {{standard}} gauge locomotive operated railway. It had been closed for the modernisation work, and it now provided a proper link from Kilmarnock to the coast. The GPK opened a short connecting spur between its own line and the K in Kilmarnock. On the same day a branch at Dalry to Swinlees was opened; there was <b>a</b> <b>copper</b> mine there.|$|E

5|$|Pendants in a {{distinctive}} shape representing the hammer of Thor (known in Norse sources as Mjöllnir) have frequently been unearthed in Viking Age Scandinavian burials. The hammers {{may have been}} worn {{as a symbol of}} Norse pagan faith and of opposition to Christianization, a response to crosses worn by Christians. Casting moulds have been found for the production of both Thor's hammers and Christian crucifixes, and at least one example of a combined crucifix and hammer has been discovered. The Eyrarland Statue, <b>a</b> <b>copper</b> alloy figure found near Akureyri, Iceland dating from around the 11th century, may depict Thor seated and gripping his hammer.|$|E
