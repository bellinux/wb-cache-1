Control of Mozambique was left to various organisations such as the Mozambique Company, the Zambezi Company and the Niassa Company which were financed and provided with cheap labour by the British Empire to work mines and construct railways. These companies penetrated inland from the coastline, setting up plantations and taxing the local populace who had until then resisted encroachment by the colonists.|$|E

5|$|Bravely Default {{was first}} {{announced}} in September 2011 {{as part of}} Nintendo's 2012 lineup for the platform. In the run-up to release, multiple demos were developed, and the team <b>adjusted</b> <b>the</b> game using feedback from players. For the Sequel was the version chosen for overseas release, being localized without any subtitle. In both Japan and overseas, Bravely Default met with strong sales and critical acclaim. Common praise went to the gameplay's mixture of traditional mechanics and new elements, along with its storyline, graphics and music. Main points of criticism were its repetitive late-game stages and elements of its social gameplay and audio. Bravely Default spawned multiple media tie-ins and spin-off games. A direct sequel, , was released in 2015 in Japan and 2016 overseas.|$|E
5|$|Concept {{work began}} {{during the middle}} of {{production}} on the Persona 2 duology. Featuring staff from the Megami Tensei franchise including artist Kazuma Kaneko and composer Shoji Meguro, development took approximately two years. It was the first game developed by Atlus to feature full voice acting, and one of the company's earliest fully 3D titles. The PS2 remake changed a number of gameplay elements, introduced further cutscenes, <b>adjusted</b> <b>the</b> music, and added the third-person perspective in response to a common trend in Japan of first-person games causing motion sickness. The game sold well in Japan, and was met with mixed to positive reviews worldwide.|$|E
5|$|He {{started with}} a {{collection}} of seven basic statistics (assists, blocks, fouls, points, rebounds, steals, and turnovers) from Yahoo! Sports on every NBA player from the previous season and <b>adjusted</b> <b>the</b> stats for time in play. The software grouped the players into color-coded nodes and connected them with lines that represented statistical similarities. Alagappan had expected the software to create five groups of nodes by statistical advantages, which would each represent a position of play, but the software instead returned 13 node groups representing 13 mathematically described positions. The assignments compare player statistics and not individual style. Originally unconfident in his results, he explored the data on his own for a week before sharing his findings with his bosses and basketball statisticians including Ken Pomeroy, who replied in encouragement. He then applied and was accepted to speak at the 2012 MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference. By May 2012, at least four NBA teams and one MLB team had contacted Ayasdi about using their technology.|$|E
50|$|Waulis design {{describes}} a crank device and an adjusting device of a combustion engine. <b>The</b> system <b>adjusts</b> <b>the</b> cylinder {{pressure of the}} motor {{in accordance with the}} required power.

The most significant change made by Charles Barber was smoothing the back of the eagle's neck. In 1904, the Mint set records for production of double eagles: 6,256,699 at Philadelphia and 5,134,175 at San Francisco—highs for the series for those mints. The only higher production of double eagles, after the Liberty Head series ended, was the figure of 8,816,000 from Philadelphia in 1928.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{the naval}} museum curator Robert F. Sumrall (following Kerr) {{suggested}} a {{mechanism by which}} dazzle camouflage may have sown the kind of confusion that Wilkinson had intended for it. Coincidence rangefinders used for naval artillery had an optical mechanism, operated by a human to compute the range. The operator <b>adjusted</b> <b>the</b> mechanism until the two half-images of the target lined up in a complete picture. Dazzle, Sumrall argued, was intended to make that hard, as clashing patterns looked abnormal even when the two halves were aligned, something that became more important when submarine periscopes included such rangefinders. Patterns sometimes also included a false bow wave to {{make it difficult for}} an enemy to estimate the ship's speed.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{beginning}} the Iron Cobra {{was known for}} adjustability. Through all the generations, the pedal has had <b>the</b> ability to <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> footboard angle independently of the beater shaft angle, <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> beater head angle, <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> hoop clamp size, <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> beater shaft length, <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> feel of the beater with a sliding weight, and <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> spring tension. Not all of these adjustments are universally possible on all other pedals from other manufacturers. The cam shape is not adjustable on the Iron Cobra, except on the third gen. duo-glide model, but the pedal has historically been offered with two different optional cams. The rolling-glide cam is round for a smooth action, while the powerglide cam changes radius mid-stroke for more acceleration. While most of the Iron Cobra pedals are double chain drive, the flexi-glide version has a kevlar strap drive. Since at least the second generation, the pedals have come with a hard plastic carrying case.|$|R

5|$|On the {{conclusion}} of the Peace of Oliwa, which <b>adjusted</b> <b>the</b> long outstanding differences between Poland and Sweden, Czarniecki was transferred to the eastern frontier where the war with Russia reignited. He distinguished himself in the campaign of 1660, where he won the victories of the battle of Połonka, battle of Basia, and battle of Kuszliki. This campaign, however, marked the zenith of his popularity. King John II Casimir Vasa attempted to involve him in the unpopular plan of vivente rege – to bypass the traditions of the royal elections in Poland and instead chose the next successor to the Polish throne (John II Casimir favored Louis, Grand Condé) still during the life of the previous king. His reputation among the unpaid and dissenting military took a dive; and many criticized him for appropriating the entire ransom that the Russians paid for their prisoners from Połonka. During the Sejm of 1662 some military representatives demanded sanctions and punishments to be levied on him.|$|E
5|$|The {{other story}} about the balance between THSR {{construction}} and the environment is the protection plan of “300-year-old camphor tree and the temple”(保護金山面老樹及伯公廟) in the Hsinchu City for more than 10 years. The tree and the temple are located on the main route of the THSR, {{and both of them}} faced removal because of railway construction. The temple -“Local Land God Temple”(伯公廟) established just beside the old tree is the belief center of the people there. In 1998, THSRC <b>adjusted</b> <b>the</b> line and design to keep the tree and temple in their original place and cooperated with local government and people to protect the old tree and the temple until today. Afterwards, together with the local government, the Environment and the Resources Protection Committee, and cultural and historical authorities, THSRC drafted the Hsinchu Old Camphor Tree Medical Plan, which called for the repair of decayed branches as well as measures designed to maintain the long-term growth and the health of the tree.|$|E
5|$|The {{regular season}} has been changed in almost every season that Asia League has been in operation. The first full season mirrors the two most recent seasons in which all teams play all other teams six times. With the number of teams {{changing}} from season to season {{in the first few}} years the league <b>adjusted</b> <b>the</b> schedule each year which often included an unbalanced schedule. Under the current schedule all teams make an away visit to each other team's home rink for a three-game series and also play a three-game series against that team at their own home rink. In order to minimize travel, teams traveling to other countries will stay there for two weeks and play two teams, except in the case of China who only has one team. Teams going to Japan will play against the Cranes and Eagles on the same trip as they are geographically close together, then in another trip play against the Free Blades and Ice Bucks.|$|E

5|$|The {{video was}} {{directed}} by British directing duo James Frost & Alex of The Artists Company. It was shot at 50 frames per second, twice the regular speed. At the shoot, Chris Martin had to sing the song at double speed so that the audio and visual content would be in sync, a common yet difficult practice of music videos. The final product is slowed to 25 frames per second, giving the slow motion effect of the video. The transition of the video from night to day was achieved during the telecine process. During the transfer from film to videotape, an operator manually <b>adjusted</b> <b>the</b> amount of lighting for blue in the beginning, red in the middle, and yellow {{at the end of}} the video.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of development, Soma Bringer {{was to be a}} standard role-playing game. During early testing, it was seen that typical role-playing games were not well suited to the DS' limited hardware and controls, so they <b>adjusted</b> <b>the</b> gameplay to its current form as an action role-playing game. After positive feedback from this, the team went ahead. The move to being an action role-playing game enabled the incorporation of cooperative multiplayer: the team wanted to focus as much as possible on the combat and related gimmicks over environmental puzzles. Rather than a separate mode, multiplayer was incorporated into the main story. The development cycle differed greatly from previous Monolith Soft titles. In Takahashi's earlier games, the scenario was written first then the gameplay was tailored to fit. For Soma Bringer, the gameplay was finalized first, and the scenario was built around the locations, dungeons, and mechanics the team had created. Also in contrast to earlier Monolith Soft titles was the lack of lengthy cutscenes, which could not be incorporated into the game with the DS' limited hardware. Instead, the team used the real-time graphics and gameplay models for equivalent scenes.|$|E
5|$|For {{his work}} as art director, Yoshida needed to adjust from working on a single static project to {{creating}} artwork assets for a game which would be updated and expanded. While the game world was created around a high fantasy aesthetic, {{it was meant to}} be realistic and encourage exploration. At the beginning of development, the team created a detailed profile of Hydaelyn, including its relation with other planets, ecosystems, climate, and geography. This was done to promote a sense of realism. Alongside creating a seamless travel experience for players, careful work was put into the topography and varied lighting of environments so they would not seem repetitive. After the environment was created, the architectural, cultural and religious elements of the world were incorporated into the environment. City and machine designs mixed metallic and natural materials to create a combined sense of wonder and familiarity for players. The game's five playable races were directly based on the five initial races from Final Fantasy XI, with design adjustments to reflect the new setting. The developers also created two different tribes, as opposed to the single tribe set-up present in XI. Characters' movements were primarily developed using motion capture, though the recorded movements were then adjusted so they would be sharp and distinctive. Much work was invested in creating emotes, character movements chosen by the player to represent a specific mood or emotion previously used in XI. To create realistic expressions, a character artist manually <b>adjusted</b> <b>the</b> faces for each expression. For the monsters, advances in hardware enabled the team to create more realistic and detailed character models, including detailed skin textures and carefully placed hair follicles.|$|E

5|$|In 1848–49, Hippolyte Fizeau {{determined}} {{the speed of}} light between an intense light source and a mirror about 8km distant. The light source was interrupted by a rotating cogwheel with 720 notches that could be rotated at a variable speed of up to hundreds of times a second. (Figure1) Fizeau <b>adjusted</b> <b>the</b> rotation speed of the cogwheel until light passing through one notch of the cogwheel would be completely eclipsed by the adjacent tooth. Spinning the cogwheel at 3, 5 and 7 times this basic rotation rate also resulted in eclipsing of the reflected light by the cogwheel teeth next in line. Given the rotational speed of the wheel and the distance between the wheel and the mirror, Fizeau was able to calculate a value of 315000km/s for {{the speed of light}}. It was difficult for Fizeau to visually estimate the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth, and his value for light's speed was about 5% too high. Fizeau's paper appeared in Comptes Rendus: Hebdomadaires de scéances de l’Academie de Sciences (Paris, Vol. 29 , pp.90–92).|$|E
5|$|In November 2010, the Accident Investigation Board Norway {{criticized the}} braking system of the trains. During 2009, there were 83 {{incidents}} where trains with locked wheels slid down steep sections of track. The Accident Investigation Board found that the metro had conducted insufficient testing of {{the braking system}} on steep slippery lines, had not <b>adjusted</b> <b>the</b> brakes satisfactorily, and had not maintained the trains and tracks sufficiently. In December 2010, Oslo Vognselskap ordered another 32 three-car units, bringing the total order up to 115 three-car units. The last trains will be delivered in 2012. There was political disagreement regarding the final purchase, with the Liberal Party and socialist opposition securing a majority for the purchase, while the right-winged parties voted to order 19 units. The extra trains {{will make it possible}} to run all lines except the Holmenkollen Line (Line 1) with six-car lines, compared to a situation with only three-car trains on the Lambertseter Line, the Ring Line and the Kolsås Line (lines 4 and 6) would only use three-car trains.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of material created for previous games, {{such as the}} BLiTZ system and the design of maps, was carried over. Alongside this, improvements {{were made to the}} game's graphics and some elements were expanded, such as map layouts, mission structure, and the number of playable units per mission. A part of this upgrade involved creating unique polygon models for each character's body. In order to achieve this, the cooperative elements incorporated into the second game were removed, as they took up a large portion of memory space needed for the improvements. They also <b>adjusted</b> <b>the</b> difficulty settings and ease of play so they could appeal to new players while retaining the essential components of the series' gameplay. The newer systems were decided upon early in development. The character designs were done by Raita Honjou, who had worked on the previous Valkyria Chronicles games. When creating the Nameless Squad, Honjou was faced with the same problem he had had during the first game: the military uniforms essentially destroyed character individuality, despite him needing to create unique characters the player could identify while maintaining a sense of reality within the Valkyria Chronicles world. The main color of the Nameless was black. As with the previous Valkyria games, Valkyria Chronicles III used the CANVAS graphics engine. The anime opening was produced by Production I.G.|$|E
