2500|$|And I {{passed a}} house, {{and there was}} a woman, and I {{remember}} that she was a little tongue-tied, sitting on a step. And she saw what was happening, and she called me in. And she spent about 20 minutes treating me like an adult, teaching me how - of course the ends were gone off the shoestrings - to twist the end and put it through the hole. Then we laced and unlaced my shoes three or four times until I knew how to do it, and then she taught me how to tie a knot. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> there for a while, and then I went along. And, as little as I was, I thought, [...] "I'd like to be like that kind of person. I'd like to be like her." [...] I think it influenced my entire life, a little thing.|$|E
2500|$|On Monday 3 August, the Belgian Government {{rejected}} the German demand for free passage through its {{country and in}} the afternoon, [...] "with gravity and unexpected eloquence," [...] Grey spoke in the Commons and called for British action [...] "against the unmeasured aggrandisement of any power". Liddell Hart considered that this speech saw the [...] "hardening (of) British opinion {{to the point of}} intervention". The following day Asquith saw the King and an ultimatum to Germany demanding withdrawal from Belgian soil was issued with a deadline of midnight Berlin time, 11.00 p.m. (GMT). Margot Asquith described the moment of expiry, somewhat inaccurately; [...] "(I joined) Henry in the Cabinet room. Lord Crewe and Sir Edward Grey were already there <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> smoking cigarettes in silence… The clock on the mantelpiece hammered out the hour and when the last beat of midnight struck it was as silent as dawn. We were at War." ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 20, 2012, the Wallflowers began {{recording}} their sixth studio album, Glad All Over at the Black Keys' Dan Auerbach's Easy Eye {{studio in}} Nashville. Jay Joyce, {{who had played}} guitar on the Wallflowers' Bringing Down the Horse agreed to produce the album. [...] Before going to the studio, the band had decided have a more collaborative writing process than {{they had in the}} past. [...] Instead of Dylan bringing in fully completed songs like he had done in the past, he only brought lyrics. [...] Dylan {{and the rest of the}} band wrote the music for the songs together in the studio. [...] Joyce explained: [...] "Jakob came to Nashville <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> down and I asked him to play me a song, but instead he pulled out this 2-inch-thick notebook. ‘This is what I’ve got. Let’s play some grooves and throw it around.’ I thought, ‘Wow, that’s kind of scary, but it’s exciting.’ So we didn’t really know going in what we were going to do. We had no songs, no demos. It was all developed in the studio. [...] The band finished recording on February 20, 2012.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Mitts {{brought forth}} the material, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> all <b>sat</b> down again.|$|R
60|$|She nodded a sweet {{acceptance}} of my invitation, <b>and</b> together <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> {{down at the}} little table of the officers' mess.|$|R
60|$|Our {{glasses were}} filled, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> still <b>sat</b> there dazed and dumb. Then Basil spoke.|$|R
60|$|The {{unobtrusive}} stranger ceased, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> gazing {{in silence}} at the ceiling.|$|E
60|$|I {{went with}} her to the bench she had pointed out, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> down.|$|E
60|$|But I didn't care. I just laughed, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> down {{together}} {{and had a}} long, delightful, chummy talk.|$|E
60|$|Now, my father, {{for awhile}} <b>we</b> were silent <b>and</b> {{alone in the}} hut, <b>and</b> as <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> I thought I heard a rat stir in the thatch.|$|R
6000|$|Thus {{she spoke}} and was silent, and I, too, was silent. Yes, there <b>we</b> <b>sat,</b> both {{silent in the}} darkness, searching the heavens for a guiding star. <b>And</b> as <b>we</b> <b>sat,</b> {{presently}} I heard the voice of Kari saying: ...|$|R
60|$|I {{had almost}} {{forgotten}} the Huns. I saw Maude gazing {{at them with}} {{a new kind of}} terror. <b>And</b> when <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> at home that evening they still haunted her.|$|R
60|$|That same afternoon, I took my comrade {{down to the}} Battery; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> {{on one of the}} benches, {{under the}} summer shade of the trees.|$|E
6000|$|... "By {{the time}} the bump on my {{forehead}} had swelled {{as big as a}} nut, our aprons were half full, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> down to enjoy ourselves. But we did n't. O dear, no! for many of the plums were not ripe, some were hurt by the birds, some crushed in falling, and many as hard as stones. Nelly got stung by a wasp, my head began to ache, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> looking at one another rather dismally, when Nelly had a bright idea.|$|E
60|$|In {{the hamlet}} of Cramond {{there is a}} hostelry of no very {{promising}} appearance, and here a room had been prepared for us, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> down to table.|$|E
60|$|The blaze died out, {{leaving the}} room almost in darkness, <b>and</b> for awhile <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> in silence.|$|R
60|$|We {{had another}} council of war next day. It was a Sunday, <b>and</b> as <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> in the window, smoking our pipes and {{watching}} the crowded street, we brooded over many plans for gaining notoriety.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> so <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> down to {{the food}} around {{the light of a}} good many candles while she {{remained}} crouching out there, staring in the dark as if feeding her bad temper on the heavily scented air of the admirable garden.|$|R
60|$|The {{second day}} was {{exactly like the}} first. The rain {{continued}} to pour down, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat,</b> wrapped up in our mackintoshes, underneath the canvas, and drifted slowly down.|$|E
60|$|I brushed {{away the}} tears that my utmost {{resolution}} {{had not been able}} to keep back, and I made a clumsy laugh of it, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> down together, side by side.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not in the ante-room, sir,' said Eames. 'Then {{he called}} us silly children, {{and went to}} bed, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> up discussin', and I suppose we got a bit above ourselves, and we--er--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was really}} screamingly funny. The Duke {{had on his}} house of Lords manner, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> all <b>sat</b> round {{like a lot of}} naughty children. If only you had been there." ...|$|R
60|$|To {{complete}} the deception, an extra plate was laid, <b>and</b> when <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> down to table one chair was not occupied. I could have cried with joy as I noted Ernest's increasing uneasiness and impatience. Finally {{he could stand}} it no longer.|$|R
6000|$|Herbert {{received}} me {{with open}} arms, and I {{had never felt}} before so blessedly {{what it is to}} have a friend. When he had spoken some sound words of sympathy <b>and</b> encouragement, <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> down to consider the question, What was to be done? ...|$|R
60|$|Sharp at {{the hour}} named Inspector Stanley Hopkins appeared, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> down {{together}} to the excellent breakfast which Mrs. Hudson had prepared. The young detective {{was in high}} spirits at his success.|$|E
60|$|Veiled and gloved, we bade {{defiance}} to the mosquitoes, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> {{and talked}} {{for half an}} hour or more. I made a little hole in my veil, through which I put the mouth-piece of my pipe.|$|E
60|$|Captain Hanaford was {{exceeding}} {{anxious to}} be under way; but he understood that nothing could be done while the storm raged with such fury, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> in the darkness, discussing what might be done when the morning came.|$|E
60|$|All day I hid my sufferings pretty well, but {{as night}} approached, and I thought of another lonely vigil in the haunted cottage, my {{heart began to}} fail, <b>and,</b> when <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> telling stories in the dusk, a {{brilliant}} idea came into my head.|$|R
60|$|Now {{the fire}} began to burn fiercely, and the {{regiment}} filed in and took {{its place in}} ranks. By the time that all had come, the pyre was everywhere a sheet of raging flame, <b>and,</b> though <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> a hundred paces from it, its heat was great when the wind turned our way.|$|R
60|$|We {{went into}} the house and had supper. <b>And</b> after supper <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> <b>and</b> talked. Fred was only down for the night, he said, because the boss wanted him back next day.|$|R
60|$|But {{that fish}} was splendid! The very smell {{of it made}} us hungry. Everything was good, and when supper was over and the dishes washed, I lighted my pipe <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> down under a tree to enjoy the evening.|$|E
60|$|The kettle {{was soon}} boiled, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> {{down to our}} meagre fare with hearty appetites. While we are thus engaged, I shall turn aside for a little and tell the reader, {{in one or two}} brief sentences, how we got to this place.|$|E
60|$|As soon as I appeared, Amina ordered {{dinner to}} be served, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> down together. As usual, she persisted in only picking a few grains of rice, and I {{resolved}} {{to speak to}} her at once of what lay so heavily on my heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "Halt!" [...] {{said the}} sergeant. [...] "Confusion! It's pit dark!" [...] <b>and</b> drawing rein <b>we</b> <b>sat</b> {{still a few}} moments, {{listening}} intently, but we heard only the branches moaning under the bitter breeze.|$|R
60|$|He led {{me off to}} a seat by {{the north}} door, between two pews, very black <b>and</b> silent. There <b>we</b> <b>sat,</b> he putting his gun {{carefully}} beside him. He remained perfectly still, thinking.|$|R
6000|$|Indeed, I {{gathered}} {{that there}} was nothing coarse or bacchanalian about this worship of a prototype of Aphrodite; on the contrary, that it was more or less spiritual <b>and</b> ethereal. <b>We</b> <b>sat</b> down on the altar stone. I wondered a little that she should have done so, but she read my thought, and answered: ...|$|R
