50|$|Illinois Central Railroad rebuilt {{most of its}} GP7s with 567BC engine blocks, liberated exhausts, paper <b>air-intake</b> <b>filters,</b> 26-L brakes (their {{original}} 6-BL brakes {{made them}} operationally incompatible with locomotives fitted with 24-RL or 26-L brakes). All but the first locomotive rebuilt had their front (short) hood reduced in height for improved crew visibility. The IC designated these rebuilt locomotives GP8. The IC acquired many second-hand units through Precision National Corporation (PNC), and then started offering GP8 rebuilding services to other railroads.|$|E
