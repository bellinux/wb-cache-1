5000|$|<b>Species</b> <b>reintroduction</b> is the {{deliberate}} {{release of a}} species into the wild, from captivity or other areas where the organism survives. The goal of <b>species</b> <b>reintroduction</b> {{is to establish a}} healthy, genetically diverse, self-sustaining population to an area where it has been extirpated, or to augment an existing population. A <b>species</b> that needs <b>reintroduction</b> is usually one whose existence has become threatened or endangered in the wild. However, <b>reintroduction</b> of a <b>species</b> can also be for pest control. For example, wolves being reintroduced to a wild area because of an overpopulation of elk or deer. Because reintroduction may involve returning native species to localities where they had been extirpated, some prefer the term [...] "reestablishment".|$|R
50|$|The zoo collaborates {{with many}} universities, {{research}} institutes, and other zoos around the world. It maintains and promotes European breeding programmes, helps safeguard several endangered species, and participates in several <b>species</b> <b>reintroduction</b> programs.|$|R
50|$|The project {{involves}} {{surveys of}} established and new woodland sites, creating trial plots for <b>species</b> <b>reintroduction,</b> propagation of plants, researching suitable species and their growing conditions and liaising with other organisations involved in similar work.|$|R
40|$|The use of {{predictive}} modelling to plan reintroductions {{and manage}} reintroduced populations has increased steadily since the mid- 1990 s, with Australia and New Zealand at the forefront. We overview {{the types of}} models commonly used for <b>species</b> <b>reintroductions,</b> focusing on Australian and New Zealand examples. Site selection, release strategies (e. g. number, composition and timing), population viability and management impacts are the key issues often investigated. We discuss {{how to deal with}} uncertainties associated with parameter estimation, stochasticity, model selection, integrating modelling approaches and decision making. Finally, we highlight three promising modelling approaches for planning <b>species</b> <b>reintroductions</b> and modelling reintroduced populations: decision theory and optimisation, individual-based modelling and Bayesian hierarchical modelling...|$|R
50|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{approaches}} to <b>species</b> <b>reintroduction.</b> The optimal strategy will depend on the biology of the organism. The first matter to address in choosing a method is sourcing individuals in situ, wild populations, or ex situ, such as a zoo or botanic garden.|$|R

50|$|The Living Desert Zoo and Gardens {{has been}} a member of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) since 1983, and is a member of the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} how human related disturbances affect mesic grasslands. I identified what was lost from the system after a disturbance and what biological constraints ecologists and managers will face when approaching their restoration. I then investigated biological limitations to grassland restoration by attempting <b>species</b> <b>reintroduction</b> into secondary grasslands and exploring the interaction between grasses and forbs...|$|R
50|$|Capturing as much genetic {{diversity}} as possible, measured as heterozygosity, {{is a good}} rule of thumb to follow in <b>species</b> <b>reintroductions.</b> Some protocols suggest that sourcing approximately 30 individuals from a population will capture 95% of the {{genetic diversity}}. Maintaining that genetic diversity throughout the reintroduction process is crucial to avoiding the loss of essential local adaptations and maximizing fitness of the reintroduced population.|$|R
50|$|Previously, {{the last}} {{sighting}} {{of a bear}} {{in what is now}} Germany was recorded in 1838 when hunters shot a bear in Bavaria. Initially heralded as a welcome visitor and a symbol of the success of endangered <b>species</b> <b>reintroduction</b> programs, his dietary preferences for sheep, chickens, and beehives led government officials to believe that he could become a threat to humans, and they ordered that he be shot or captured.|$|R
50|$|In extinct <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> {{for which}} the cause of {{extinction}} is known, over 50% were affected by invasive species. For 20% of extinct <b>animal</b> <b>species,</b> invasive species are the only cited cause of extinction. Invasive species are the second-most important cause of extinction for mammals.|$|R
50|$|After the re-opening, {{the public}} showed an {{interest}} to see exotic <b>animal</b> <b>species,</b> {{hence the name}} was changed to Augsburger Tiergarten after World War II, and the first exotic <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> {{was introduced in the}} zoo.|$|R
500|$|In prehistoric times, {{the area}} was rich with fauna, and 45 {{distinct}} <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> have been identified, half of them wild animals. Domesticated goats were the most common, and gazelles were the most frequently occurring wild <b>animal</b> <b>species.</b>|$|R

50|$|A rough {{estimate}} {{of the number of}} hermaphroditic <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> is 65,000. Since the estimated total number of <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> is 8.6 million, the percentage of <b>animal</b> <b>species</b> that are hermaphroditic is about 0.7%. Arthropods are the phylum with the largest number of species. Most hermaphroditic species exhibit some degree of self-fertilization. The distribution of self-fertilization rates among animals {{is similar to that of}} plants, suggesting that similar processes are operating to direct the evolution of selfing in animals and plants.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{was set up to}} {{investigate}} the mechanisms limiting plant populations and species diversity in fen grasslands and to test, if management measures, proposed for fen restoration are able to overcome these limitations. As the main limitation types seed limitation and microsite- (gap-) limitation were regarded. Additionally interactions of these limitations with site conditions (productivity) were investigated. As restoration measures, different ways of <b>species</b> <b>reintroduction</b> (sowing, transplanting, transfer of seed-rich hay material) and of site management (moderate grazing, mowing, litter removal, gap creation, topsoil removal) were studied...|$|R
