The unit emerged {{from a group of}} ten men wanting to volunteer in the regular Filipino army. Luna, still thinking of the defeat at the Battle of Caloocan, sent the men away at first. However, he soon changed his mind and decided to give the men an initiation. After taking breakfast, he ordered a subordinate, Colonel Queri, to prepare arms and ammunition for the ten men. Then, the men boarded a train destined towards Malinta, which was American-held territory. After giving orders to the men, he let them go <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> with his telescope. The men, succeeding their mission, eventually returned unharmed. Admiring their bravery, he organized them into a guerrilla unit of around 50 members. This unit would see action in the Second Battle of Caloocan.|$|E

On 15 September 2001 he escaped from the hospital and was at large until early 2003. On the night of his escape, Sajal Barui hosted a beer party to which he invited the two police constables that had been put on guard to watch him. He often offered beer to the constables after it had been smuggled in by his girlfriend, so they did not suspect his motives. On that night, however, he spiked the two bottles of beer with sleeping pills <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> fall asleep. He then {{walked out of the}} hospital unhindered.|$|E

The film, an adaptation of Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay's novel of the same name, narrated the love story of an idealist Lalita (Vidya) and a musician Shekhar (Saif Ali Khan), {{the son of a}} capitalist businessman. Her performance in the film was praised by critics; Derek Elley from Variety wrote, [...] "An acting revelation is Tamil newcomer [...] Balan, whose devoted but dignified Lalita is the picture's heart and soul."

500|$|Moon {{displayed}} what {{he described}} as a humble and self-deprecating manner during the World Series of Poker, repeatedly acknowledging his lack of poker experience throughout the tournament, and often attributing his success to luck and a high number of strong cards, rather than talent. Moon adopted a phrase, [...] "If I win, I win. If I lose, I lose," [...] which reflected his casual approach to the game. Moon also said one of his philosophies was, [...] "Make the other guy pay to see the cards", a strategy attributed to many re-raises Moon made during the 2009 World Series of Poker despite weak hands. Moon had almost no experience in heads-up poker, which some commentators said factored into his loss against Cada in the final hours of the 2009 World Series. Many fans and commentators praised his working stiff style, with some dubbing him [...] "Darvin Gump", a reference to the underdog protagonist of the 1994 drama film, Forrest Gump. Moon has also been nicknamed the [...] "Luddite Logger" [...] because of his distaste for anything technological, including credit cards and online poker. Moon refused to sign a sponsorship deal with an Internet poker company during the 2009 tournament because {{he said he did not}} want to answer to anybody. Moon wore a New Orleans Saints hat throughout the tournament because, [...] "I like cheering for the underdog." [...] Moon was invited to guest at the Saints games for their entire playoff run in 2010, <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> win Super Bowl XLIV against the Indianapolis Colts in Miami.|$|E

Despite high hopes of regaining The Ashes against an England team that [...] "can't bat, can't bowl and can't field" [...] Australia {{found itself in}} trouble again. Allan Border won the toss at the Gabba put England in to bat <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> make 456. Greg Matthews was the most senior of bowlers, and had played as many Tests (17) as the others combined; Bruce Reid (8), Steve Waugh (8), Merv Hughes (1) and Chris Matthews (0).

2500|$|Four {{years before}} Len Hutton {{had won the}} toss, put Australia in to bat <b>and</b> <b>watched</b> <b>them</b> made 601/8 declared. The week before Neil Harvey had said that [...] "the pitch at Brisbane was the best in Australia for batting", but Keith Miller wrote [...] "the best thing Benaud could do for Australia was lose the toss", No captain had put the {{opposition}} in to bat in an Ashes series and won since Johnny Douglas in the [...] at Melbourne Cricket Ground in the 1911–12 Ashes series. Bearing this in mind {{it was a bad}} toss to win and May made the difficult decision to bat on a green wicket which looked favourable to the fast bowlers in the expectation that it would flatten out in the afternoon. Arthur Milton was surprised by a straight ball by Ian Meckiff (3/33), who had been spraying his deliveries up to two feet {{on either side of the}} stumps. Keith Miller recalled [...] "Meckiff was all over the place...the cynical reckoned he fired too wide to be hit...it was, in fact, the most erratic piece of fast bowling I had ever seen in a Test match. Yet it helped to put Australia on top". Peter Richardson depended on neat deflections for many of his runs, but had not managed to adapt to the faster Australian wickets and Benaud fed in an extra slip and another when the England opener slipped the ball between the fielders until he was caught by Ken Mackay off Alan Davidson (3/36) and England were 16/2. Tom Graveney (19) was beaten several times by Davidson and was dropped by Norm O'Neill, who then damaged a finger fielding and was sent to hospital for x-rays. He added 46 with May (28) before wicket-keeper Wally Grout snapped them both up. Cowdrey (13) fell a great catch by Lindsay Kline and Godfrey Evans to another by Peter Burge. Benaud had made his new ball bowlers stay on for over an hour in their opening spell, and called them back for more until they were exhausted. He had been bowling to give them a rest, but now started on the long England tail. [...] "The Boil" [...] Trevor Bailey (Bailey was pronounced [...] "Boiley" [...] by the Australians) took two hours to make 27 in his own dull way, but hit a couple of boundaries after seeing Jim Laker do so. Davidson had to leave the field exhausted and Benaud (3/46) had Bailey stumped to end the innings for 134.|$|E
