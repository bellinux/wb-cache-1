Higher correlations (r(sup 2) from 0. 75 to 1. 00) are obtained in the visible portion of the spectra when the total phytoplankton <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> are unpackaged by multiplying the entire spectra by a factor that sets the total absorption at 675 nm to that expected from <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> reconstruction using measured pigment concentrations and laboratory-derived pigment-specific <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra.</b> The derived pigment-specific <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> were further used with the total phytoplankton <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> in a second linear inverse calculation to estimate the various phytoplankton HPLC pigments. A comparison between the estimated and measured pigment concentrations for the 18 pigment fields showed good correlations (r(sup 2) greater than 0. 5) for 7 pigments and very good correlations (r(sup 2) greater than 0. 7) for chlorophyll a and fucoxanthin. Higher correlations result when the analysis is carried out at more local geographic scales. The ability to estimate phytoplankton pigments using pigment-specific <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> is critical for using hyperspectral inverse models to retrieve phytoplankton pigment concentrations and other Inherent Optical Properties (IOPs) from passive remote sensing observations...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The UV <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> {{of water}} with {{different}} electric charge (potential) were obtained. It was shown that UV <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> {{of water with}} negative electric charge (potential) have the sharp peaks with maximum in the range 190 – 200 nm and UV <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> of water with positive electric charge (potential) have the wide peaks with maximum in the range 200 – 220 nm. It was asked to explain this absorption. It was also established that UV <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> of water solutions of surface inactive substances have sharp peaks with a maximum in the range 190 – 200 nm and UV <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> of solutions of surface active substances have the wide peaks with a maximum in the range 200 – 220 nm. The UV <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> of DNA solutions, which were prepared on the water with different electric charge (potential), were obtained.

5|$|Similar to the A centers, B centers do not induce color, and no UV or visible {{absorption}} can {{be attributed}} to the B centers. Early assignment of the N9 absorption system to the B center have been disproven later. The B center has a characteristic IR <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum</b> (see the infrared absorption picture above) with a sharp peak at 1332cm−1 and a broader feature at 1280cm−1.

5|$|The DU {{spectrophotometer}} or Beckman DU, {{introduced in}} 1941, {{was the first}} commercially viable scientific instrument for measuring the amount of ultraviolet light absorbed by a substance. This model of spectrophotometer enabled scientists to easily examine and identify a given substance based on its <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum,</b> the pattern of light absorbed at different wavelengths. Arnold O. Beckman's National Technical Laboratories (later Beckman Instruments) developed three in-house prototype models (A, B, C) and one limited distribution model (D) before moving to full commercial production with the DU. Approximately 30,000 DU spectrophotometers were manufactured and sold between 1941 and 1976.|$|E
5|$|As pH {{rises above}} 0 the above yellow hydrolyzed species form {{and as it}} rises above 2–3, reddish-brown hydrous iron(III) oxide {{precipitates}} out of solution. Although Fe3+ has an d5 configuration, its <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum</b> is not like that of Mn2+ with its weak, spin-forbidden d–d bands, because Fe3+ has higher positive charge and is more polarizing, lowering the energy of its ligand-to-metal charge transfer absorptions. Thus, all the above complexes are rather strongly colored, with the single exception of the hexaquo ion – and even that has a spectrum dominated by charge transfer in the near ultraviolet region. On the other hand, the pale green iron(II) hexaquo ion 2+ does not undergo appreciable hydrolysis. Carbon dioxide is not evolved when carbonate anions are added, which instead results in white iron(II) carbonate being precipitated out. In excess carbon dioxide this forms the slightly soluble bicarbonate, which occurs commonly in groundwater, but it oxidises quickly in air to form iron(III) oxide that accounts for the brown deposits present in a sizeable number of streams.|$|E
40|$|We present converged {{ab initio}} {{calculations}} of the optical <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> of single-layer, double-layer, and bulk MoS 2. Both the quasiparticle-energy calculations (on {{the level of}} the GW approximation) and the calculation of the <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> (on {{the level of the}} Bethe-Salpeter equation) explicitly include spin-orbit coupling, using the full spinorial Kohn-Sham wave functions as input. Without excitonic effects, the <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> would have the form of a step function, corresponding to the joint density of states of a parabolic band dispersion in two dimensions. This profile is deformed by a pronounced bound excitonic peak below the continuum onset. The peak is split by spin-orbit interaction in the case of single-layer and (mostly) by interlayer interaction in the case of double-layer and bulk MoS 2. The resulting <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> are thus very similar in the three cases, but the interpretation of the spectra is different. Differences in the spectra {{can be seen in the}} shape of the <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> at 3 eV where the spectra of the single and double layers are dominated by a strongly bound exciton...|$|R
40|$|The <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> of {{photosynthetic}} algae {{are characterized}} by a continuous envelope, which {{is a result of}} the overlapping spectra of the indivual pigments. This feature makes it difficult to estimate the contribution of each pigment to the total <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra.</b> Derivative analysis is an objective tool for isolating absorption peaks in phytoplankton. Theoretically, electrons and ions of interacting molecules can be regarded as simple harmonic oscillators in an electromagnetic field, which result in a Lorentzian shape. However, when measured by an optical spectrophotometer the signal is transformed into a Gaussian curve. Thus, a combination of both types of curve provides a realistic approach to the decomposition of <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra.</b> In this study derivative analysis is performed on <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> in order to prove that the method can be successfully used to identify the individual <b>absorption</b> <b>spectra</b> of component pigments.

5|$|Most of the {{physical}} properties of astatine have been estimated (by interpolation or extrapolation), using theoretically or empirically derived methods. For example, halogens get darker with increasing atomic weight– fluorine is nearly colorless, chlorine is yellow-green, bromine is red-brown, and iodine is dark gray/violet. Astatine is sometimes described as probably being a black solid (assuming it follows this trend), or as having a metallic appearance (if it is a metalloid or a metal). The melting and boiling points of astatine are also expected to follow the trend seen in the halogen series, increasing with atomic number. On this basis they {{are estimated to be}} , respectively. Some experimental evidence suggests astatine may have lower melting and boiling points than those implied by the halogen trend. Astatine sublimes less readily than does iodine, having a lower vapor pressure. Even so, half of a given quantity of astatine will vaporize in approximately an hour if put on a clean glass surface at room temperature. The <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum</b> of astatine in the middle ultraviolet region has lines at 224.401 and 216.225nm, suggestive of 6p to 7s transitions.|$|E
5|$|Type I diamond has {{nitrogen}} (N) atoms as {{the main}} impurity, at a concentration of up to 1%. If the N atoms are in pairs or larger aggregates, they do not affect the diamond's color; these are Type Ia. About 98% of gem diamonds are type Ia: these diamonds belong to the Cape series, named after the diamond-rich region formerly known as Cape Province in South Africa, whose deposits are largely Type Ia. If the nitrogen atoms are dispersed throughout the crystal in isolated sites (not paired or grouped), they give the stone an intense yellow or occasionally brown tint (type Ib); the rare canary diamonds belong to this type, which represents only ~0.1% of known natural diamonds. Synthetic diamond containing nitrogen is usually of type Ib. Type Ia and Ib diamonds absorb in both the infrared and ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum, from 320nm. They also have a characteristic fluorescence and visible <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum</b> (see Optical properties).|$|E
5|$|Type II {{diamonds}} {{have very}} few if any nitrogen impurities. Pure (type IIa) diamond can be colored pink, red, or brown owing to structural anomalies arising through plastic deformation during crystal growth; these diamonds are rare (1.8% of gem diamonds), but constitute {{a large percentage of}} Australian diamonds. Type IIb diamonds, which account for ~0.1% of gem diamonds, are usually a steely blue or gray due to boron atoms scattered within the crystal matrix. These diamonds are also semiconductors, unlike other diamond types (see Electrical properties). Most blue-gray diamonds coming from the Argyle mine of Australia are not of type IIb, but of Ia type. Those diamonds contain large concentrations of defects and impurities (especially hydrogen and nitrogen) and the origin of their color is yet uncertain. Type II diamonds weakly absorb in a different region of the infrared (the absorption is due to the diamond lattice rather than impurities), and transmit in the ultraviolet below 225nm, unlike type I diamonds. They also have differing fluorescence characteristics, but no discernible visible <b>absorption</b> <b>spectrum.</b>|$|E
