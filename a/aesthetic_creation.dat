40|$|What is {{the purpose}} of a work of art? What drives us to make art? Why do we value art and consume it? Nick Zangwill argues that we cannot {{understand}} the nature of art without first having answers to these fundamental questions. On his view, which he dubs 'the <b>Aesthetic</b> <b>Creation</b> Theory', a work of art is something created for a particular aesthetic purpose. More specifically, the function of art is to have certain aesthetic properties in virtue of its non-aesthetic properties, and this function arises because of the artist's insight into the nature of these dependence relations and her intention to bring them about. In defending this view, Zangwill provides an account of aesthetic action and aesthetic creative thought and shows how the <b>Aesthetic</b> <b>Creation</b> Theory can accommodate two kinds of seeming counterexamples to aesthetic theories of art: narrative art and twentieth-century avant-garde art. <b>Aesthetic</b> <b>Creation</b> also contains a detailed exposition and critique of a range of rival views, including Dickie's institutional theory of art, accounts of art that make essential reference to an audience, and sociological theories which purport to explain the nature of art without recourse to the notion of the aesthetic...|$|E

Author: Mafi Misirhanova Supervisor: Karin Ehrlén Term: Spring 2017  The purpose of my thesis {{is to examine}} how the five pre-school teachers who participate in my study reflect about aesthetic expressions in relation to children's learning in preschool. Furthermore, I {{want to find out}} about the thoughts of the educators concerning the role of social interaction and the importance of the environment in the <b>aesthetic</b> <b>creation</b> process. My first question is about what view the informants have on social interaction during <b>aesthetic</b> <b>creation</b> processes. My second question is about how the informants reflect on studio and creative rooms at the selected three preschools. The study is based on qualitative interview methods where five pre-school teachers reflected on their internship. The essay is based on a sociocultural perspective based on development and learning. As far as the informants' views on social interaction during <b>aesthetic</b> <b>creation</b> processes are concerned, my study showed that there is a strong connection between aesthetic learning processes, language learning and social interaction as these areas interact during a creative activity at preschool. The informants' reflection on the studio and the creative rooms showed that the preschool with a creative room in the department gave the most positive response because the room was considered to enable continuous creation processes.

40|$|In {{recent decades}} the {{landscape}} architectural discourse {{has tended to}} eschew ideas of aesthetics while focusing instead on notions of functional and sustainable design. We offer the view that <b>Aesthetic</b> <b>Creation</b> Theory, whose principal exponent is the philosopher Nick Zangwill, {{has the potential to}} redress this imbalance by interpreting landscape architecture as art. Zangwill's account of art differs, however, from many other definitions found in philosophical aesthetics: it holds that works of art have aesthetic functions that are essential to them, but also allows that they have other, non-aesthetic functions, for example practical or ecological ones. It thus removes the strict distinction between fine art and the useful arts. After introducing Zangwill's theory, we discuss some rival theories of art and then explore the virtues of <b>Aesthetic</b> <b>Creation</b> Theory for the theory, practice, and pedagogy of landscape architecture. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The object {{the essay}} has in view is to re-define Nietzsche’s {{relationship}} with the Renaissance beyond the outstanding terrible simplifications and the literary and <b>aesthetic</b> <b>creations</b> of myths focused on the constellation superman Renaissance willing of power Antichrist. Richard Wagner strongly conditions with his ideas Nietzsche’s valuations of Renaissance: there is, in the young author of the Birth of Tragedy, a first, strong diffidence on the foot-steps of the German ideology of the musician and of his rooted aversion to the Renaissance. The Italian Opera seems a false revival of the Greek-style and is the paradigmatic model of the artifice and of the luxury of a selfish aristocracy, far from {{the feeling of the}} Volk. As a philologist and a promoter of a revival of the Greek world in Germany, Nietzsche had necessarily, as a model of comparison, the Italian Renaissance. At the first hostility follows a more free and open evaluation that can be read, in the complexity of its experimental movement, in the posthumous documents. In particular, the influence of Burckhardt, considerable for a new definition of his {{relationship with the}} musician, shows a progressive turning-point in the opinion. The essay pauses, on this subject, on Nietzsche’s notes to the lessons dedicated to The Discovery of the Antiquity among the Italians {{that turned out to be}} a mosaic of quotations from The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy. It is certainly the most important document, not yet valued, of the close relationship between Nietzsche and Burckhardt. On the search of the complexity and the plurality that characterizes the superior culture, Nietzsche discovers and enhances more and more the value of the Latin Renaissance in direct opposition to the German Renaissance impressed by Wagner’s illusion. With Burckhardt he discovers the individual man and the philologist poet, prototype of the free spirit, putting into practice the detachment from the German myth of the Volk and beginning the way to the culture of the romance...|$|R

It aims to illustrate his underlying adherence to these principles as evidenced by his chosen subject matter and the <b>aesthetic</b> <b>creation</b> and destruction of the artistic self in his own work. Using a combination of romantic irony and dialectical movement, Enzensberger's continued position as a romantic Marxist can be shown in his constant productive appropriation of emerging social conditions, as well as in his adaptability and self-reflective intellectual growth. The analysis begins with Enzensberger's provocative early poetry and expands existing literary research by shifting the main focus to his more recent essay production...|$|E

40|$|Oral {{tradition}} {{has a long}} history of research both in linguistics and anthropology, being the vast corpus of ethnic narrative one of its main achievements. This outstanding documentation of worldwide cultural verbal creations has to a certain degree already been published, other materials remain in archives or as part of unpublished texts, while much more is being gathered in contemporary research. Yet, a critique to this enormous academic effort may be that analysis and interpretation of data has been left behind, to favor the ethnographic and linguistic documentation and rescue of the vanishing oral heritage of endangered native cultures. This paper discusses such analytical shortcoming and advances a dialogic perspective based on Bakhtin’s theoretical framework, with particular interest in concepts derived from musical theory, such as voice, intonation, and polyphony. In fact, even though Bakhtin’s interests were centered on rather canonical written literature, and not on folklore and the <b>aesthetic</b> verbal <b>creations</b> of non Western cultures, his conceptual framework is based on oral phenomena in general, as his concept of voice clearly shows. Oral discourse and everyday language are placed as the foundation and primary source of written literature. Therefore, Bakhtinian concepts have an extraordinary potential for the study of oral discourse, in particular of tales, legends, myths, and other genres belonging to traditional narrative. In this paper I argue that linguistic anthropological research on oral tradition may greatly benefit from a Bakhtinian perspective, which offers novel conceptual tools for the understanding of ethnic narrative, and may also allow a critical review of previous theories and studies on the subject...|$|R
