5|$|On 15 November 2016, Sukhoi Su-33 {{fighter jets}} began {{conducting}} combat flights over Syria from Admiral Kuznetsovs flight deck {{in the ongoing}} Syrian civil war. On 5 December 2016, {{it was reported that}} an Su-33 had crashed into the Mediterranean Sea after it failed to land on the carrier for a second time due to an <b>arrestor</b> cable problem.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of her career, over thirty {{aircraft}} were either lost or heavily damaged while operating from Melbourne. The majority of the aircraft ditched or crashed over the side, but some losses were due to catapult or <b>arrestor</b> cable failures. After Melbourne was decommissioned, the Fleet Air Arm ceased fixed-wing combat aircraft operation in 1984, with the final Tracker flight saluting the decommissioned carrier.|$|E

5|$|This CATOBAR {{arrangement}} {{allows for}} faster launching and recovery {{as well as}} a much wider range of aircraft that can be used on board compared with smaller aircraft carriers, most of which use a simpler STOVL arrangement without catapults or <b>arrestor</b> wires. The ship's aircraft operations are controlled by the air boss from Primary Flight Control or Pri-Fly. Four large elevators transport aircraft between the flight deck and the hangars below. These hangars are divided into three bays by thick steel doors that are designed to restrict the spread of fire.|$|E
5|$|Melbournes {{first major}} refit started in December 1967 and {{continued}} until February 1969, {{during which she}} was upgraded to operate S-2 Tracker and A-4 Skyhawk aircraft. The modifications cost A$8.5million, and included {{an overhaul of the}} hull and machinery, strengthening of the flight deck, improvements to the catapult and <b>arrestor</b> cables, modification of the aviation fuel systems and flight control arrangements, and upgrades of the navigational aids and radar. Air conditioning systems and a liquid oxygen generation plant were also installed. Melbourne re-entered service {{at the conclusion of the}} refits on 14 February, and performed sea trials in Jervis Bay from 17 February until 5 May. This was the largest project undertaken by Garden Island Dockyard to that date.|$|E
5|$|The angled flight decks of the {{carriers}} use a CATOBAR arrangement to operate aircraft, with steam catapults and <b>arrestor</b> wires for launch and recovery. As well as speeding up flight deck operations, this {{allows for a}} much wider variety of aircraft than with the STOVL arrangement used on smaller carriers. An embarked carrier air wing consisting of up to around 90 aircraft is normally deployed on board. After the retirement of the F-14 Tomcat, the air wings' strike fighters are primarily F/A-18E and F/A-18F Super Hornets and F/A-18A+ and F/A-18C Hornets. In addition to their aircraft, the vessels carry short-range defensive weaponry for anti-aircraft warfare and missile defense.|$|E

5|$|After a {{farewell}} {{visit from the}} Eastern Fleet commander, Admiral Sir James Somerville on 12 January 1943, Illustrious sailed for home the next day. She flew off her aircraft to Gibraltar on 31 January and continued on to the Clyde where she arrived five days later. She conducted deck-landing trials for prototypes of the Blackburn Firebrand and Fairey Firefly fighters, {{as well as the}} Fairey Barracuda dive/torpedo bomber from 8 to 10 February. On 26 February she began a refit at Birkenhead that lasted until 7 June during which her flight deck was extended, new radars were installed, her light antiaircraft armament was augmented, and two new <b>arrestor</b> wires were fitted aft of the rear lift which increased her effective landing area. While conducting her postrefit trials, she also conducted flying trials for Martlet Vs and Barracudas. Both sets of trials were completed by 18 July, by which time the Illustrious had joined the Home Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Although the F-35B {{is fully}} capable of {{performing}} vertical landing, {{in a similar}} fashion to the way that the Harrier and Sea Harrier operated, this method of operation places limitations on the loads that the aircraft is capable of returning to the ship with. As a consequence, to avoid the costly disposal at sea of both fuel and munitions, the Royal Navy is developing the Shipborne rolling vertical landing (SRVL) technique for its operation of the Lightning II. SRVL is a hybrid landing technique that uses the Lightning's vectored thrust capability to slow its forward speed to around 70 knots to allow it to make a rolling landing, using its disc brakes, without the need of an <b>arrestor</b> wire. A special type of metallic 'thermal paint' is being developed to withstand temperatures of up to 1,500C in the vicinity of jet nozzles.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November 1945, a Fireball of VF-41 {{became the}} first {{aircraft}} to land under jet power on an aircraft carrier, albeit without prior planning. After the radial engine of an FR-1 failed on final approach to the escort carrier , the pilot managed to start the jet engine and land, barely catching the last <b>arrestor</b> wire before hitting the ship's crash barrier. The squadron was attempting to qualify its pilots for carrier operations during this time, but only 14 of its 22 pilots made the six required takeoffs and landings. A number of accidents occurred when the nose gear failed on landing, but the pilots were at least partly responsible as they were slamming the nose gear onto the deck after landing on the main gear.|$|E

5|$|The Seafire, a name {{derived from}} sea, and Spitfire, was a naval {{version of the}} Spitfire {{specially}} adapted for operation from aircraft carriers. Although the Spitfire was not designed for the rough-and-tumble of carrier-deck operations, it was considered the best available fighter at the time. The basic Spitfire design did impose some limitations {{on the use of}} the aircraft as a carrier-based fighter; poor visibility over the nose, for example, meant that pilots had to be trained to land with their heads out of the cockpit and looking along the port cowling of their Seafire. Like the Spitfire, the Seafire also had a relatively narrow undercarriage track, which meant that it was not ideally suited to deck operations. Early marks of Seafire had relatively few modifications to the standard Spitfire airframe; however cumulative front line experience meant that most of the later versions of the Seafire had strengthened airframes, folding wings, <b>arrestor</b> hooks and other modifications, culminating in the purpose-built Seafire F/FR Mk 47.|$|E

50|$|Locomotives {{built in}} Great Britain, where coke {{was the most}} common fuel, often used {{chimneys}} of cast iron, as they lasted longer than chimneys fabricated from sheet metal. Early North American locomotives often used wood fuel; and large numbers of glowing embers were carried through the boiler and out of the chimney by high velocity exhaust steam. Spark <b>arrestors</b> became a common feature of wood-burning locomotive chimneys {{to reduce the number of}} fires started by escaped embers. The difficulty of casting complex spark <b>arrestors</b> encouraged fabrication of sheet metal chimneys for wood-burning locomotives.|$|R
5000|$|Dry {{flashback}} <b>arrestors</b> typically use {{a combination}} of different safety elements to stop a flashback or reverse flow of gas. This is the type that is typically found in most cutting and welding applications all over the world as they work just as effectively with any orientation, need very little maintenance, and are depending on the country or region often mandatory to be installed at the gas regulator or gas outlet/ tapping point. Depending on the application they are also often used at the torch side as an additional safety device. Flashback <b>arrestors</b> help prevent: ...|$|R

25|$|The {{flashback}} <b>arrestor</b> (not to {{be confused}} with a check valve) prevents shock waves from downstream coming back up the hoses and entering the cylinder, possibly rupturing it, as there are quantities of fuel/oxygen mixtures inside parts of the equipment (specifically within the mixer and blowpipe/nozzle) that may explode if the equipment is incorrectly shut down, and acetylene decomposes at excessive pressures or temperatures. In case the pressure wave has created a leak downstream of the flashback <b>arrestor,</b> it will remain switched off until someone resets it.|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} the factors which {{influence}} the stability of simultaneous, distributed arcs on power lines is reported. The types of arcs studied were through air between iron electrodes, flashover along a wood-air boundary between copper electrodes and arcs confined in expulsion-tube lightning <b>arrestors.</b> Variations of line geometry influence line characteristic impedance, series and shunt impedances and equivalent length. The studies indicate that of these factors, only the series impedance between the simultaneous arcs is important unless the line length separating the two arcs is very short. The analysis illustrates {{that it is possible}} to calculate approximate critical spacing of a test gap in terms of the geometry and material of arc electrodes and the potential at the gap. This potential was shown to depend upon both the power frequency conduction characteristics of the remainder of the circuit and upon the nature of the surge initiating the arc. The relative importance of these two factors was estimated. The studies show that it is possible for arcs to rob one another after they have been independently initiated on power distribution systems. Consequently, with appropriate placement of lightning <b>arrestors</b> it is possible to protect a system so that even though a direct stroke of lightning may initiate an arc at a location remote from the <b>arrestors,</b> the <b>arrestors</b> can still rob the open arc of current and hence extinguish it...|$|R

25|$|Between the {{regulator}} and hose, and ideally between hose and torch on both oxygen and fuel lines, a flashback <b>arrestor</b> and/or non-return valve (check valve) should be installed to prevent flame or oxygen-fuel mixture being pushed back into either cylinder and damaging the equipment or causing a cylinder to explode.|$|E
