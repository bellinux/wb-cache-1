25|$|The album also {{provided}} another first in both Motown and R music: Gaye and his engineers had composed the album {{in a song}} cycle, segueing previous songs into other songs giving the album a more cohesive feel as opposed to R albums that traditionally included filler tracks to complete the album. This style of music would influence recordings by artists such as Stevie Wonder and Barry White making the concept album format a part of 1970s R music. Concept albums are usually based on either one theme or a series of themes in connection to the original thesis of the album's concept. Let's Get It On repeated the suite-form arrangement of What's Going On, as would Gaye's later albums such <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> You, Here, My Dear and In Our Lifetime.|$|E

Faust, Thiessen, and others participated in selecting voice actors, and Hasbro gave final approval. The voice work is performed {{prior to the}} animation, with the animators in the room to help provide direction; according to Libman, this allows herself and the other actors to play the character without certain limitations. Libman noted that for recording her lines as the hyperactive Pinkie Pie, [...] "I learned that I can go as over the top <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> and they [...] rarely pull me back." ...|$|E

One reporter attempted to ask Willis about his opinion on the current government, but was interrupted by Willis in mid-sentence: [...] "I'm sick of answering this fucking question. I'm a Republican only as far <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> a smaller government, I want less government intrusion. I want them to stop shitting on my money and your money and tax dollars that we give 50 percent of every year. I want them to be fiscally responsible and I want these goddamn lobbyists out of Washington. Do that and I'll say I'm a Republican. I hate the government, OK? I'm apolitical. Write that down.

The moment you hear it — I hear what he's sayin', and I relate." [...] Nas also stated on Twitter that he and Ocean were collaborating on a song from Nas's tenth studio album Life Is Good, though the {{material}} never made the album. Chicago born rapper Lupe Fiasco expressed a positive opinion of the release too.|$|E
500|$|During a {{press release}} for the single and its {{accompanying}} remixes, Carey said the following regarding the re-recorded vocals: [...] "I’ve always {{had so much fun}} re-singing my songs for the club/dance mixes. It gives me the freedom to sing as powerfully <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> and to rewrite the songs specifically for the genre." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine, who was critical of the song's original version, praised the [...] "Vintage Throwback Remix". He felt it was more of what the original [...] "should have been" [...] and concluded: [...] "a rousing vocal arrangement at the song's climax sells Mariah's inspirational message of perseverance and harks back to her '90s heyday." [...] Idolator's Becky Bain called the remix far more [...] "captivating" [...] than the original, and felt its re-recorded vocals showcased the singer's [...] "one-of-a-kind range." ...|$|E
500|$|Some {{television}} {{critics were}} less {{enthusiastic about the}} episode. Zack Handlen from The A.V. Club felt that the episode was inferior to the previous episode, deeming it tedious. He wrote, [...] "'Bloodletting' was a step down from last week's première, mostly because it focused more on conversations than scares. Much <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> this show {{to find some way}} to do its characters right, those conversations were bland, providing no new information beyond, hey, it would suck to have your son get shot in front of you, huh?" [...] Concluding his review, Handlen gave the episode a 'B–' grade. In concurrence, Nate Rawlings of Time stated: [...] "For an episode titled 'Bloodletting' there was surprisingly little of it last night. What we got instead were outpourings of emotion and frustration. Two entries in, and it's already clear that the show wants to strike a balance between gore and humanity." [...] Andrew Conrad of the Chicago Tribune was unhappy with the episode; he expressed disappointment with the low amount of zombie sequences, writing, [...] "It must be a bit of a relief for the show's make-up department, but I'd like to see at least one walker every ten minutes or so." ...|$|E

500|$|Chandler and the Experience {{found time}} to record between {{performances}} in Europe. They began on October 23, recording [...] "Hey Joe" [...] at De Lane Lea Studios, with Chandler as producer and Dave Siddle as engineer. The song featured backing vocals by the Breakaways. Soon after the session began, Chandler asked Hendrix to turn his guitar amplifier down, and an argument ensued. Chandler commented: [...] "Jimi threw a tantrum because I wouldn't let him play guitar loud enough... He was playing a Marshall twin stack, {{and it was so}} loud in the studio that we were picking up various rattles and noises." [...] According to Chandler, Hendrix then threatened to leave England, stating: [...] "If I can't play as loud <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>want,</b> I might as well go back to New York." [...] Chandler, who had Hendrix's immigration papers and passport in his back pocket, laid the documents on the mixing console and told Hendrix to [...] "piss off". Hendrix laughed and said: [...] "All right, you called my bluff", and they got back to work. Redding wrote in his diary that they completed two songs during the October 23 session, but the second one has never been positively identified. Author Sean Egan speculated that it might have been Howlin' Wolf's [...] "Killing Floor" [...] or Wilson Pickett's [...] "Land of a Thousand Dances". Chandler decided that they should use an Experience original for the B-side of the single, so he encouraged Hendrix to start writing; he composed his first Experience song, [...] "Stone Free", the following day. Chandler, in an effort to minimize studio expenses, purchased rehearsal time at the Aberbach House in London. He abandoned this practice after realizing how quickly the group could learn songs while warming up in the studio. On November 2, 1966, the Experience returned to De Lane Lea to continue work on their first single. During the session, they recorded [...] "Stone Free" [...] and a demo version of [...] "Can You See Me". This marked {{the first time that the}} Experience recorded a song that was eventually included on the original UK release of the album.|$|E

This {{included}} documenting the events of her marriage to Jay-Z, her miscarriage, birth of daughter Blue Ivy, {{as well as her}} professional split from her father and manager Mathew Knowles. Knowles addressed this in an interview with GQ magazine, saying [...] "I always battle with: How much do I reveal about myself? How do I keep my humility? How do I keep my spirit and the reality? And how do I continue to be generous to — to my fans and to my craft? And how do I stay current? But how do I stay soulful? And it is the battle of my life.

2500|$|In 2006, {{an attempt}} was made to {{eliminate}} it from a public school in Pittsburgh, PA. Some schools in the United States have eliminated the IBDP due to budgetary reasons and low student participation. In Utah in 2008, funding for the IBDP was reduced from $300,000 to $100,000 after State Senator Margaret Dayton objected to the program, stating, [...] "First, I have never espoused eliminating IB ... I don't want to create 'world citizens' nearly as much <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> to help cultivate American citizens who function well in the world." [...] Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, meanwhile, believes that IB should be an option for students in Chicago Public Schools. Elizabeth Brackett reports on the IB in Chicago. A report [...] by the University of Chicago concluded that Chicago Public School students who completed the IB programme were 40% more likely to attend a four-year college, 50% more likely to attend a selective four-year college, and significantly more likely to persist in college than their matched peers outside the program." [...] The City of Miami Beach Commission entered into an education compact with Miami-Dade County Public Schools with one of the initiatives of the compact to implement the IB program throughout Miami Beach feeder schools.|$|E
