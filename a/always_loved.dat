5|$|Through {{a series}} of miscommunications, Edward {{believes}} that Bella has killed herself by jumping off a cliff into the ocean. Distraught over her apparent suicide attempt, Edward travels to Italy and attempts to provoke the Volturi (powerful coven who act as vampiric overlords) to kill him by exposing himself as a vampire to humans. Alice, Edward's sister, and Bella travel to Italy to save Edward, and arrive {{just in time to}} stop him. Alice looks on as Bella jumps into the sunlight, and into Edward, preventing him from committing suicide. Realizing that Bella is alive, Edward explains to Bella that he <b>always</b> <b>loved</b> her and only left to protect her. However, the Volturi determine that Bella, a human who knows that vampires exist, must either be killed or transformed into a vampire herself. Alice stops them from killing her by sharing her premonition, in which Bella has been transformed, with Aro, a Volturi elder who is able to read thoughts through touch. Soon after, they return to Forks and Cullens again settle themselves in Forks. Bella asks Edward to transform her and Cullens vote in favor of that much to Edward and Rosalie's dismay. Later, Jacob reminds Edward, the treaty Cullens and Quileutes made years before that they will not attack each other, as long as the Cullens do not feed on any humans, a necessity for Bella's transformation. The movie concludes with Edward telling Bella that he will change her into a vampire after she marries him.|$|E
