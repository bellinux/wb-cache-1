5|$|Paul {{offers to}} manage Georgia Brooks' (Saskia Hampele) singing career and gets her to sign over {{the rights to}} her song. Paul then gives the song to Amali Ward, but she decides against {{recording}} it. Paul attempts to sue Georgia, but drops the case when he learns Jack has died. He then asks for his fraud conviction {{to be removed from}} his criminal record, so he can run for mayor. Karl unsuccessfully runs against him. Paul seeks to separate the hotel from the Lassiter's chain to enable him to sack Terese. However, Terese quits her job and Paul threatens to sue her. Lucy persuades Paul to re-hire Terese <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>keeps</b> the hotel within the Lassiter's chain. Paul learns Rebecca works for a civic project called Twin Cities and forges Karl's signature on a cover letter to get Rebecca to return. Paul tells Rebecca that he became mayor for her because he still loves her. Paul asks Rebecca to move back to Erinsborough, but she refuses. Paul disapproves when Kate gets back together with Mark Brennan. They reconcile just before she is fatally shot. Paul blames Mark for Kate's death.|$|E
25|$|Her realm becomes {{known as}} the Val sans Retour (the Vale of No Return). Morgan's fancied good knights besides Lancelot include the rescued-but-abducted young Sir Alexander the Orphan (Alisaunder le Orphelin, a cousin of Tristan and Mark's enemy), whom she {{promises}} to heal, but he vows to rather castrate himself than to pleasure her, but promises her to defend the castle of Fair Guard (Belle Garde), {{where he has been}} held for a year, and then continues to guard it even when the castle was burnt down. In the Val sans Retour, Lancelot frees the many knights entrapped by Morgan from her power, including Morgan's own son Ywain and her former lover Guiomars who has been turned to stone by her for his unfaithfulness. Morgan captures Lancelot under her spell and keeps him prisoner in the hope Guinevere would go mad or die of sorrow, and otherwise torments the queen, causing her a great distress and making her miserable until the Lady of the Lake gives her a ring of protection from any power of Morgan. On one occasion, she lets the captive Lancelot go to rescue Sir Gawain when he promises to come back, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>keeps</b> his word and does return; she eventually releases him when his health falters and he is near death.|$|E
500|$|After {{the end of}} the SpongeBob special, Patchy finds Encino {{shrunk to}} a very small size, and then, he finds three aliens, which explain that their son, Norbluck 5, was playing with his Shrink-A-Tron again. Patchy yells at them that he wants his town back in full size, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>keeps</b> saying, “There’s no place like home." [...] (Obviously parodying the scene from The Wizard of Oz) Sympathetic by Patchy's misery that he wants to go home because he missed it the entire story, Norbluck 5's mother gets the Shrink-A-Tron given from her son, and she presses the big red button control, making a tornado {{disaster}} to fix it up. Then, Patchy is glad to be back in Encino, but soon, a giant Potty the Parrot crushes him into the house (presumably showing that Norbluck 5 had once again used his Shrink-A-Tron to make Potty huge).|$|E

500|$|Robin Dunne altered his {{appearance}} {{for a more}} [...] "post-apocalyptic warrior look." [...] This included the addition of scars, a [...] "funky eye" [...] contact lens, and a mullet, which Kindler believed was [...] "ubiquitus" [...] for the look. Tapping noted that seeing Zimmerman's altered appearance {{for the first time}} [...] "creeped [...] out." [...] She also stated that while Dunne played the darker version of Zimmerman, she felt there were times he [...] "really wanted to punch [...] in the face." [...] Martin Wood believed Dunne did [...] "an amazing job" [...] playing the most unlike Zimmerman. Throughout filming, Dunne and Tapping performed their own stunts. The episode {{became one of the most}} expensive in the series, partially due to the rather extensive use of prosthetic makeup. The destroyed city skyline was in fact a painting made by the production designers. Andrew Lockington composed the score of the episode. Damian Kindler was receptive towards Lockington's work, stating that he [...] "sustains this very very heavy tone, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>keeps</b> it there." ...|$|E
500|$|Five and a {{half months}} after his last start, American Pharoah began his second season in the Grade II Rebel Stakes on a sloppy track at Oaklawn Park on March 14. He carried top weight of 119 pounds and started as the 2–5 {{favorite}} against six opponents, headed by the Todd Pletcher-trained Madefromlucky. The colt led from the start and drew away in the closing stages to win by six and a quarter lengths. Espinoza called the winner [...] "an amazing horse", while Baffert was satisfied with the run, especially as the colt returned with a twisted shoe which would have hampered his progress. Four weeks later at the same track, American Pharoah started as the odds-on favorite against seven opponents in the Grade I Arkansas Derby. After racing in second place behind outsider Bridget's Big Luvy, he took the lead {{a quarter of a mile}} from the finish and steadily increased his advantage to win by eight lengths from Southwest Stakes winner Far Right. Baffert noted, [...] "He's matured substantially. He's a good horse <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>keeps</b> moving forward. I don't want to get ahead of myself, but Dortmund is another one who we don't yet know how good he is. We've got a one-two punch and that's a good position to be in." [...] After the race, Ron Moquett, the trainer of runner-up Far Right, described American Pharoah as [...] "a superhorse".|$|E

When she died in September 2012, they mourned her death on air. One time during a Jimmy Fund visit, Routh had painted Callahan's nails - <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>keeps</b> one of them painted in Routh's memory.|$|E

[...] On this, Hirsh said, [...] "There are guys who are religious, sure, but they don’t impress it upon anybody. It’s not like they hung a cross in my locker or anything. They’ve accepted me for who I am, and what I believe in." ...|$|E
2500|$|Haddon {{states on}} his website that, {{although}} he had read [...] "a handful of newspaper and magazine articles about, or by, people with Asperger's and autism" [...] in preparation for writing the book, he knows [...] "very little" [...] about Asperger's syndrome and that Christopher Boone is inspired by two different people. According to Haddon, none of these people can be labelled as having a disability. Haddon added that he [...] "slightly regret" [...] that the term Asperger's syndrome appeared {{on the cover of}} his novel. In 2010, in an interview with The Independent, he was described as [...] "now thoroughly irritated that the word Asperger's appeared on subsequent editions of the novel, because now everyone imagines that he is an expert <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>keeps</b> getting phone calls asking him to appear at lectures." ...|$|E
2500|$|Apatow {{has worked}} {{with a group of}} actors on an ongoing basis, {{including}} Steve Carell, Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, and Jason Segel, and also tends to work with his close friends. He has frequently worked with producers Shauna Robertson and Barry Mendel. He reunited with Jason Segel and Amy Poehler for the 2001 Fox sitcom pilot, North Hollywood. He tries to keep a low budget on his projects and usually makes his movies about the work itself rather than using big stars. After his success in film, he hired the entire writing staff from Undeclared to write movies for Apatow Productions. He never fires writers <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>keeps</b> them on projects through all stages of productions, known colloquially as [...] "the comedy wheel." [...] Apatow is not committed to any specific studio, but his projects are typically set up at Universal and Sony, and in 2009 Variety reported that Universal had signed him to a 3 picture directing deal.|$|E

2500|$|The 2010 America's Polo Cup match {{took place}} on June 12 on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., with teams {{announced}} as United States and India. The advertised ticket price for the event was $95 per person. The event had an attendance of about 250 people, with food from Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen and PF Chang's China Bistro. Reports of the event stated that the players who represented India were actually of Pakistani origin and were from Florida. A spokesman for the Embassy of India stated that neither the Embassy nor the government of India had any association with the event. The event's website and the US team's uniforms identified an Indian company, Kingfisher Beer, as a sponsor. A spokesperson for Kingfisher denied {{that the company had}} sponsored the event. Yashpal Singh, the {{president and chief executive of}} Mendocino Brewing Company, Kingfisher's parent company, stated, [...] We are not sponsoring this event and have informed the people managing this event of that. ... We have sent legal notices to this effect, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>keeps</b> on advertising us as a sponsor. I don't know what world he's living in.

2500|$|Owen Gleiberman of Variety said, [...] "he flying {{action has}} a casual flip buoyancy, {{and the movie}} does get you rooting for Peter. The appeal of this {{particular}} Spider-Boy is all too basic: In his lunge for valor, he keeps falling, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>keeps</b> getting up." [...] Mike Ryan of Uproxx praised the film's light tone and performances, writing: [...] "Spider-Man: Homecoming is the best Spider-Man movie to date. That does come with a caveat that Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man 2 are going for different things and both are great. But, tonally, I just love this incarnation of a Peter Parker who just loves being Spider-Man." [...] The New York Timess Manohla Dargis stated, [...] "Mr. Holland looks and sounds more like a teen than the actors who’ve previously suited up for this series, and he has fine support from a cast that includes Jacob Batalon as Peter’s best friend. Other good company includes Donald Glover, as a wrong-time, wrong-place criminal, and Martin Starr, who plays his teacher role with perfect deadpan timing." [...] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote, [...] "The best thing about Spider-Man: Homecoming is Spidey is still more of a kid than a man. Even with his budding superpowers, {{he still has the}} impatience, the awkwardness, the passion, the uncertainty and sometimes the dangerous ambition of a teenager {{still trying to figure out}} this world." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film a [...] "mixed" [...] review, praising the stunt work and calling Michael Keaton's performance as the Vulture [...] "one of the strongest, most sympathetic villains of the entire series," [...] but criticizing the direction by Jon Watts as [...] "unevenly orchestrated".|$|E
