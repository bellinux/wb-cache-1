The Village Voice, reporting on an interview with Lafourcade, noted, [...] "There are enough such grand old structures in her country to make this possible", although according to Lafourcade, [...] "some of them are better maintained than others." [...] The [...] "Hasta la Raíz Tour" [...] opened in Tijuana on April18, 2015, and also visited several cities in the United States such as San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and New York City. In Hollywood, Lafourcade participated on the Latin Grammy Acoustic Sessions at the Fonda Theatre. A few dates in Argentina, Chile, Italy, and Spain were announced; however, her record label, Sony Music, announced that due to illness the performance in Spain, set for June, would be canceled. In September, Lafourcade performed at [...] "Festival DCODE 2015" [...] in Madrid, Spain. The singer also visited Colombia on October1, 2015, performing at Bogotá's Royal Center. On November4, 2015, Lafourcade fulfilled a long-held dream of performing {{for the first time}} at the Auditorio Nacional in Mexico City. [...] "I've been here with Julieta Venegas, and someone reminded me that I opened for Juanes a few years <b>ago.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> 13 years old, I ran away from home with my best friend to come to the Auditorio Nacional to see Christina Aguilera, and I wanted to be on stage, longing to have this opportunity. After many years of work, this became a reality." [...] To further promote the album, Lafourcade became the first Mexican female singer-songwriter to record an acoustic session for the music streaming service Spotify. Titled Spotify Sessions, the live EP includes six tracks from Hasta la Raíz ("Para Qué Sufrir", the title track, [...] "Nunca Es Suficiente", [...] "Ya No Te Puedo Querer", [...] "Palomas Blancas", and [...] "No Más Llorar") and a cover version of Rafael Hernández's [...] "Silencio". Lafourcade performed [...] "Hasta la Raíz" [...] at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2015. Lafourcade also presented the tour in a sold-out show held at the Teatro Cariola in Santiago de Chile, Chile on November 25, 2015.|$|E

It was the nature of the negro then, as now, to steal watermelons. They stole three of the melons of an adoptive brother of mine, the only good ones he had. I suspected three of a neighbor’s negroes, but there was no proof, and, besides, the watermelons in those negroes’ private patches were all green and small and not up to indemnity standard. But in the private patches of three other negroes there was a number of competent melons. I consulted with my comrade, the understudy of the board. He said that if I would approve his arrangements he would arrange. I said, “Consider me the board; I approve; arrange.” So he took a gun and went and collected three large melons for my brother-on-the-halfshell, and one over. I was greatly pleased and asked: ...|$|E

You, I am sure, have always practically acted in this manner in your conduct towards me & I do not doubt to all others. Nor can I remember that I have ever published a word directly against religion or the clergy."

Out of curiosity, I lay down on the ice and looked through the hole, until I saw the axe a little on one side, standing on its head, with its helve erect and gently swaying to and fro with the pulse of the pond; and there it might have stood erect and swaying till in the course of time the handle rotted off, if I had not disturbed it. Making another hole directly over it with an ice chisel which I had, and cutting down the longest birch which I could find in the neighborhood with my knife, I made a slip-noose, which I attached to its end, and, letting it down carefully, passed it over the knob of the handle, and drew it by a line along the birch, and so pulled the axe out again.|$|R

In 2008 came Dietario voluble, in which he opts more than ever for a formula that erases the borders between fiction, essay and biography. The book is a literary diary or a kind of guide that allows the reader to glimpse the work’s internal structure, and combines experiences of reading and life, personal memory, and an essayist’s literary ideas. It was followed by Ella era Hemingway / No soy Auster, two short texts published by Alfabia in the Cuadernos Collection.In 2010 he has returned once more to the novel with Dublinesca, a book that deals with a publisher in crisis, as the author explains: ‘He was a fictional character, with a few things in common with me. By the time I {{turned him into a}} publisher he was a mixture of lots of publishers I’ve known. In Paris, for example, some readers think <b>I</b> <b>am</b> writing about Christian Bourgois, my French publisher.’ The book contains part of a dream predicting the future: ‘I had it three years <b>ago</b> in hospital, <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> seriously ill. It <b>was</b> incredibly intense. <b>I</b> dreamed <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in Dublin, a city <b>I</b> have never <b>been</b> to, and that I’d started drinking again and was sitting {{on the floor in the}} doorway to a pub, crying very emotionally. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> crying and hugging my wife, regretting having started drinking again. The intensity came from the fact that in the dream, in that embrace with my wife, there was a dense, highly concentrated idea of rebirth. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> recovering in hospital and it <b>was</b> as if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> experiencing real life for the first time. But <b>I</b> <b>was</b> unable to transmit all the intensity… A few months later I traveled to Dublin and couldn’t find the exact spot the dream took place. But I had an amazingly precise memory of it.’ ...|$|R
