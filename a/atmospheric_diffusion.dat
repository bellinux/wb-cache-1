50|$|Atmospheric dispersion, or diffusion, studies how {{pollutants}} {{are mixed}} in the environment. There are many factors {{included in this}} modeling process, such as which level of atmosphere(s) the mixing is taking place, {{the stability of the}} environment and what type of contaminant and source is being mixed. The Eulerian and Lagrangian (discussed below) models have both been used to simulate <b>atmospheric</b> <b>diffusion,</b> and are important for a proper understanding of how pollutants react and mix in different environments. Both of these models take into account both vertical and horizontal wind, but additionally integrate Fickian diffusion theory to account for turbulence. While these methods have to use ideal conditions and make numerous assumptions, at this point in time, it is difficult to better calculate the effects of turbulent diffusion on pollutants. Fickian diffusion theory and further advancements in research on <b>atmospheric</b> <b>diffusion</b> can be applied to model the effects that current emission rates of pollutants from various sources have on the atmosphere.|$|E

40|$|Numerico-empirical {{expressions}} for {{the particle}} displacement probability density function {{from which the}} mean concentration of material in turbulent fluid may be obtained are derived from the numerical planetary boundary layer model of Deardorff. These expressions are then used to compute profiles of the mean, cross-wind-integrated concentration of an inert pollutant issuing from a continuous point source below a stable layer. Profiles are derived for each of two conditions of atmospheric stability: zi/L= 0 and – 4. 5, where zi is the inversion base height and L the Monin-Obukhov length. The resulting concentration profiles [referred to as the numerico-empirical (NE) profiles] are then used in two separate experiments designed to assess the adequacy of conventional <b>atmospheric</b> <b>diffusion</b> formulations. First, {{the validity of the}} <b>atmospheric</b> <b>diffusion</b> equation is assessed by determining for each of the two stabilities cited above the profile of vertical eddy diffusivity that produces the closest fit of the mean concentration predicted by the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>diffusion</b> equation with the NE profiles.

The experiment was motivated by the fact that <b>atmospheric</b> <b>diffusion</b> of clusters of particles is evidently non-Fickian. This result was first observed by Richardson (1926, 1929) himself.

Numerical simulations are implemented to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

HAZMAP can be used either to simulate the mass distribution of the deposit if a wind profile is given (‘deposit mode’), or to define the probability of a given accumulation of mass on the ground if a statistical set of wind profiles is provided (‘‘probability mode’’).

40|$|An open {{incubation}} {{method has}} been used in many studies to directly estimate primary productivity and ecosystem functioning by measuring photosynthetic and respiratory rates in intertidal rockpool communities. The method measures changes in dissolved oxygen concentrations recorded in situ during an artificial dark period (respiration) and a natural light period (net primary productivity). Although this method has yielded interesting results, its advantages and limitations have yet to be thoroughly tested. The accuracy of the method was investigated in a controlled laboratory environment and compared with field incubations. <b>Atmospheric</b> oxygen <b>diffusion</b> across the air–water interface did not affect incubation measurements under low wind speed (< 2 m s? 1). Temperature increases during incubations were not greater than in natural rockpools and did not affect primary productivity. The major problem was the oxygen supersaturation which inhibited photosynthesis, thus leading to an underestimation of primary production. To allow comparable measurements, net primary productivity needs to be recorded during the linear phase of the photosynthetic process (< 30 min of light) before water reaches supersaturation (< 160 %). This method gives rapid and reliable estimates of primary productivity thereby allowing biodiversity and ecosystem functioning relationships to be tested using rockpools as natural mesocosms...|$|R
