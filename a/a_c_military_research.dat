The C 4 ISR system {{is a kind of}} the real-time embedded system that was difficult to be developed without a powerful tool especially to integrate thousands of battlefield objects including military people, weapon systems, navigation systems, platform sensors, and communication links [Harn 02]. The requirements description of C 4 ISR systems is always changed in accordance with the national strategic thinking, commanderâ€™s operation needs, battlefield resources allocations, and so forth. Therefore, {{it is very hard to}} firm the user requirements and specifications during development process of <b>a</b> <b>C</b> 4 ISR system [Luqi 92].

The methodology has been illustrated using a problem related to &quot;warrior pull &quot; of information in the Navy's Copemicus architecture. The software used to implement the CPNs was Design/CPNru, u. riion 1. 9. The model was constructed from existing infomution on battle group tactical infonnation flows, and functional decomposition of the Copernicus architecture components implemented alloat and ashore. The results successfully demonsnated {{the effect of the}} &quot;warrior pull &quot; process when the difference between the tactical pictures ashore and afloat exceeded a prescribed threshold value...|$|R
