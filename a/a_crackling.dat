5|$|Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD or OD) {{is a joint}} {{disorder}} in which cracks form in the articular cartilage and the underlying subchondral bone. OCD usually causes pain and swelling of the affected joint which catches and locks during movement. Physical examination typically reveals an effusion, tenderness, and <b>a</b> <b>crackling</b> sound with joint movement.|$|E
5|$|The most {{acclaimed}} of the neo-noirs {{of the era}} {{was director}} Roman Polanski's 1974 Chinatown. Written by Robert Towne, it is set in 1930s Los Angeles, an accustomed noir locale nudged back some few years {{in a way that}} makes the pivotal loss of innocence in the story even crueler. Where Polanski and Towne raised noir to a black apogee by turning rearward, director Martin Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader brought the noir attitude crashing into the present day with Taxi Driver (1976), <b>a</b> <b>crackling,</b> bloody-minded gloss on bicentennial America. In 1978, Walter Hill wrote and directed The Driver, a chase film as might have been imagined by Jean-Pierre Melville in an especially abstract mood.|$|E
5|$|Indium is a silvery-white, highly ductile post-transition metal with {{a bright}} luster. It is so soft (Mohs {{hardness}} 1.2) that like sodium, it can be cut with a knife. It also leaves a visible line on paper. It {{is a member of}} group 13 on the periodic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between its vertical neighbours gallium and thallium. Like tin, a high-pitched cry is heard when indium is bent – <b>a</b> <b>crackling</b> sound due to crystal twinning. Like gallium, indium is able to wet glass. Like both, indium has a low melting point, 156.60°C (313.88°F); higher than its lighter homologue, gallium, but lower than its heavier homologue, thallium, and lower than tin. The boiling point is 2072°C (3762°F), higher than that of thallium, but lower than gallium, conversely to the general trend of melting points, but similarly to the trends down the other post-transition metal groups because of the weakness of the metallic bonding with few electrons delocalized.|$|E

500|$|Rikky Rooksby, {{author of}} The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, {{explained}} that [...] "Impressive Instant" [...] {{began with the}} equalizer on higher frequencies turned down, so {{that the amount of}} treble is very less initially. Madonna's vocals are heavily processed and is accompanied by <b>a</b> <b>crackling</b> sound, which has a [...] "tactile roughness" [...] therefore making the mix sound [...] "like a musical sandpaper", Rooksby wrote. The vocals are often isolated and are backed by laser noises and an octave bass. A [...] "burbling" [...] synth arrives at the 2:30mark, and then the chorus of [...] "I'm in a trance" [...] is repeated, ending the song with the cliché solo vocal phrase.|$|E
500|$|The {{cutting of}} the tree began when the [...] saw, {{operated}} by six men, was positioned across the trunk. The saw penetrated the trunk, and the adjacent area was cleared of bystanders. The spectators were repositioned up the hillside {{to the south and}} across the ravine to land that had previously been cleared by the Civilian Conservation Corps camp. The men moved the saw backward and forward, as woodchoppers widened the open wedge. After approximately 30 minutes, Criss yelled, [...] "We're through boys." [...] The men removed the saw, and the woodchoppers continued to pick at the open wedge. The tree made <b>a</b> <b>crackling</b> sound, its upper limbs dipped, and the Mingo Oak crashed onto its designated felling location. While it had been intended that the tree be down by 10:30, it was not until 11:00 that this occurred. To assist in the segmentation of the collapsed tree, competitions were held in woodchopping and log sawing. Saw manufacturer E.C. Atkins and Company furnished saws for the competitors.|$|E

500|$|Signs and {{symptoms}} of spontaneous subcutaneous emphysema vary based on the cause, but it {{is often associated with}} swelling of the neck and chest pain, and may also involve sore throat, neck pain, difficulty swallowing, wheezing and difficulty breathing. Chest X-rays may show air in the mediastinum, the middle of the chest cavity. A significant case of subcutaneous emphysema is easy to detect by touching the overlying skin; it feels like tissue paper or Rice Krispies. [...] Touching the bubbles causes them to move and sometimes make <b>a</b> <b>crackling</b> noise. [...] The air bubbles, which are painless and feel like small nodules to the touch, may burst when the skin above them is palpated. [...] The tissues surrounding SCE are usually swollen. [...] When large amounts of air leak into the tissues, the face can swell considerably. [...] In cases of subcutaneous emphysema around the neck, there may be a feeling of fullness in the neck, {{and the sound of the}} voice may change. If SCE is particularly extreme around the neck and chest, the swelling can interfere with breathing. The air can travel to many parts of the body, including the abdomen and limbs, because there are no separations in the fatty tissue in the skin to prevent the air from moving.|$|E

2500|$|The main symptom is pain, causing loss {{of ability}} and often stiffness. [...] "Pain" [...] is {{generally}} described as a sharp ache or a burning sensation in the associated muscles and tendons, and is typically made worse by prolonged activity and relieved by rest. Stiffness is most common in the morning, and typically lasts less than thirty minutes after beginning daily activities, but may return after periods of inactivity. Osteoarthritis can cause <b>a</b> <b>crackling</b> noise (called [...] "crepitus") when the affected joint is moved or touched and people may experience muscle spasms and contractions in the tendons. Occasionally, the joints may also be filled with fluid. Some people report increased pain associated with cold temperature, high humidity, or a drop in barometric pressure, but studies have had mixed results.|$|E
2500|$|At 21:19 on 23 March, while patrolling off Angaur Island, Tunny {{picked up}} a radar contact which she {{identified}} by sight as a large I-class submarine.

Then, at 2324, Tunny launched four torpedoes from a range of , swung hard to starboard to prevent a collision, and dove to avoid a possible return attack.

2500|$|Her third {{release was}} Mahesh Bhatt's romantic comedy Hum Hain Rahi Pyaar Ke {{opposite}} Aamir Khan, which many critics called her career's best performance. Critics wrote [...] "Aamir Khan and Juhi Chawla have already {{proved to be}} a great on-screen pair and here they shine once again. Aamir Khan is effective in a suitably restrained performance but it is Juhi Chawla who steals the show with her comic nirvana. Easily she is the funniest actor in the history of Hindi cinema {{and it would be a}} tough challenge for any actor to match up to that. Moreover, her effortless dialogue delivery in Tamil (especially for someone who doesn't speak the language) only further prove what a gifted actress she is." [...] Another critic wrote [...] "The film ultimately belongs to Juhi, because she is the soul of all things. She is the active reason of things happening. She is the fun. She is that innocence people love. It is difficult to imagine any other actress in this role. Such is her natural charm and comic sense in this one, and she truly deserved the Filmfare she received. Looking sweet and simple throughout the film she makes you smile with her mere presence. This is definitely her best performance. Add to it she is acting opposite Aamir, the two compliment each other and share <b>a</b> <b>crackling</b> chemistry and you are left with a feeling of bliss". The pairing of Chawla with Khan (one of the most popular on screen pairings of the '90s) resulted in hype over the film's release, and it proved a major commercial and critical success. Her comic-dramatic performance met with unanimous critical acclaim and won her several awards, including the Filmfare Best Actress Award for her performance in the film.|$|E
