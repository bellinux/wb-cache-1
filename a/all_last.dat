500|$|Olivia became {{concerned}} about her daughter after Hilda Doolittle, who also believed she was engaged to Pound, arrived in London in 1911. Olivia welcomed H.D. to her home, but she witnessed the interactions between Dorothy, Pound, H.D. and Richard Aldington, whom H.D. married in 1913. In September 1912 Olivia wrote a stern letter to Pound, in which she pointedly told him to break off his friendship with Dorothy:You {{told me you were}} prepared to see less of Dorothy this winter. I don't know if you wd rather leave it to me to say I don't think it advisable she should see so much of you etc. or whether you wd rather do it in your own way.... I don't know if she still considers herself engaged to you—but she obviously can't marry you—it's hardly decent! There's another point too—which is the personal inconvenience & bother to myself—I had <b>all</b> <b>last</b> winter, practically to keep 2 days a week for you to come & see her... She must marry—She & I can't possibly go on living this feminine life practically à deux for ever, & we haven't money enough to separate... You ought to go away—Englishmen don't understand yr American ways, & any man who wanted to marry her wd be put off by the fact of yr friendship (or whatever you call it) with her. If you had ₤500 a year I should be delighted for you to marry her! ...|$|E

2500|$|Williams was {{the first}} showmen to use a {{projector}} produced by Haydon and Urry and his use of their machine (The Eragraph) came about {{as a result of}} three contributing factors: - need, availability, and timing. In early 1897, Haydon and Urry {{were in the process of}} developing their own film projector. The company had recently moved their offices and showroom to 353 Upper Street, Islington [...] and were located just across the street from the Royal Agricultural Hall where Williams was exhibiting. Williams was already acquainted with one of the firm’s employees, James Monte (their chief film maker), having met him a year earlier at a showman’s annual supper committee meeting. [...] By early February 1897, Haydon and Urry’s projector was ready for market and according to accounts from that time, Williams was in need of a new one. He had opened at the World’s Fair with an exhibition of films, but the projector he was using ("the Electroscope") had been condemned as a fire risk by London County officials. [...] Getting a showman as well known as Randall Williams on board with their new projector was no doubt a major coup for Haydon and Urry. The firm applied for a patent (application no. 3572) for their cinematograph on 10 February 1897 - just as the World’s Fair was ending - and just five days prior to the opening of Williams' show at King’s Lynn at the start of the fairground season. [...] The projector used by Williams at King's Lynn would have been the firm’s earliest model and, it was likely the same model he used throughout the summer, leading Haydon and Urry to claim in their advertising that their machine had been used “with unqualified success at Victorian Era Exhibition <b>all</b> <b>Last</b> Season.” ...|$|E
