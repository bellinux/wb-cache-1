5|$|In {{mid-19th century}} America, the Wesleyan holiness {{movement}} began to teach that entire sanctification was less a process {{and more of}} <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> one entered into by faith at a definite moment in time. This second blessing, as it was commonly called, allowed Christians to be freed from the power of sin. Among adherence of the holiness movement, baptism in the Holy Spirit was synonymous with second blessing sanctification.|$|E

5|$|A 1989 {{document}} generally {{known as}} Aspects of Christian meditation set forth {{the position of}} the Holy See with respect to the differences between Christian and eastern styles of meditation. The document, issued as a letter to all Catholic bishops, stresses the differences between Christian and eastern meditative approaches. It warns of the dangers of attempting to mix Christian meditation with eastern approaches since that could be both confusing and misleading, and may result in the loss of the essential Christocentric nature of Christian meditation. The letter warned that euphoric states obtained through Eastern meditation {{should not be confused with}} prayer or assumed to be signs of the presence of God, <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> should always result in loving service to others. Without these truths, the letter said, meditation, which should be a flight from the self, can degenerate into a form of self-absorption.|$|E
5|$|After his cricket career ended, Halcombe had a {{successful}} career as a sports broadcaster. In 1947 he was appointed as the sports supervisor for the Australian Broadcasting Commission in Perth. He was Western Australia's first full-time sports broadcaster, <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> he filled {{until his retirement in}} 1968. Halcombe won a strong personal following for his flamboyant description of cricket and Australian rules football matches. Halcombe also conducted regular segments on his Saturday sports programs such as Strange but True and People I Met This Week. Halcombe developed a reputation as a raconteur and had a habit of rummaging through old newspapers in search of sporting items. Halcombe travelled widely throughout the state to interview notable sports personalities and presented his broadcasts in a distinctive humorous style. He was particularly remembered for his commentary partnerships with Johnnie Moyes and Englishman Arthur Gilligan during English tours to Australia.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} months of 1781, both pro-British and separatist forces began concentrating in Virginia, <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> had {{previously}} not experienced more than naval raids. The British forces were led at first by the turncoat Benedict Arnold, and then by William Phillips before General Charles, Earl Cornwallis, arrived in late May with his southern army to take command. In June he marched to Williamsburg, where he received a confusing series of orders from General Sir Henry Clinton that culminated in a directive to establish a fortified deep-water port (which would allow resupply by sea). In response to these orders, Cornwallis moved to Yorktown in late July, where his army began building fortifications. The presence of these British troops, coupled with General Clinton's desire for a port there, made control of the Chesapeake Bay an essential naval objective for both sides.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth {{was still}} {{attached}} to her old friend when Mary Dudley left the court in July 1579because of bad health, or out of solidarity with her brother Robert, Earl of Leicester, who was in disgrace for having married. She joined her husband at Ludlow in 1582, where he was serving his third turn as President of the Council of Wales. A year later her health was in such <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> Henry Sidney believed he would soon {{have the opportunity to}} take a second wife. Mary Dudley died on 9August 1586, three months after her husband, in whose elaborate funeral she had participated. She was buried by his side at Penshurst.|$|E
5|$|Even {{with the}} Republican victory in November 1866, Johnson {{considered}} {{himself in a}} strong position. The Fourteenth Amendment had been ratified by none of the Southern or border states except Tennessee, and had been rejected in Kentucky, Delaware, and Maryland. As the amendment required ratification by three-quarters of the states {{to become part of}} the Constitution, he believed the deadlock would be broken in his favor, leading to his election in 1868. Once it reconvened in December 1866, an energized Congress began passing legislation, often over a presidential veto; this included the District of Columbia voting bill. Congress admitted Nebraska to the Union over a veto, and the Republicans gained two senators and <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> promptly ratified the amendment. Johnson's veto of a bill for statehood for Colorado Territory was sustained; enough senators agreed that a district with a population of 30,000 was not yet worthy of statehood to win the day.|$|E
5|$|He {{had been}} {{recommended}} {{to me as}} a man of energy and enthusiasm, but he seemed shy when we met. It was only on further acquaintance that I noticed other traits. He was extremely good company, with a sharp tongue and an inclination to dismiss most of humanity as spies and traitors. I rather liked that! I discovered he was very ambitious, perhaps more than his abilities warranted, and also very excitable. He sometimes worked himself up into such <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> he lost all powers of reasoning.|$|E

5|$|If {{the mass}} of the nucleus {{following}} a fusion reaction is less than the sum of the masses of the separate particles, then the difference between these two values can be emitted as a type of usable energy (such as a gamma ray, or the kinetic energy of a beta particle), as described by Albert Einstein's mass–energy equivalence formula, E=mc2, where m is the mass loss and c is the speed of light. This deficit is part of the binding energy of the new nucleus, and it is the non-recoverable loss of the energy that causes the fused particles to remain together in <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> requires this energy to separate.|$|E
5|$|In 1789, Adams {{was elected}} Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts {{and served in}} that office until Governor Hancock's death in 1793, when he became acting {{governor}}. The next year, Adams was elected as governor in his own right, {{the first of four}} annual terms. He was generally regarded as the leader of his state's Jeffersonian Republicans, who were opposed to the Federalist Party. Unlike some other Republicans, Adams supported the suppression of the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794 for the same reasons that he had opposed Shays's Rebellion. Like his fellow Republicans, he spoke out against the Jay Treaty in 1796, a position that drew criticism in <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> was increasingly Federalist. In that year's U. S. presidential election, Republicans in Virginia cast 15 electoral votes for Adams {{in an effort to make}} him Jefferson's vice-president, but Federalist John Adams won the election, with Jefferson becoming vice-president. The Adams cousins remained friends, but Samuel was pleased when Jefferson defeated John Adams in the 1800 presidential election.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, Clark {{became the}} third {{president}} of the Massachusetts Agricultural College (MAC), now the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

Farmers of western Massachusetts were slow to support the college. Despite these obstacles, Clark's success in organizing an innovative academic institution earned him international attention.|$|E

In 957, an embassy from Byzantium brought the tribute from the Emperor for his occupation of Calabria from there, with gifts of gold and silver vessels adorned with jewels, silks, brocades and other valuables. In Italy, El-Muizz planned the invasion of Egypt, whose conquest would make the Fatimids rivals in power to the Abbasids in Baghdad.|$|E

5|$|The Tories, unlike Whigs such as Earl Grey, {{sought to}} {{continue}} the vigorous prosecution {{of the war in}} Continental Europe against the powerful and aggressive Emperor of the French, Napoleon I. An anti-French alliance, which included Russia, Prussia, Austria, Britain and several smaller countries, defeated Napoleon in 1814. In the subsequent Congress of Vienna, it was decided that the Electorate of Hanover, <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> had shared a monarch with Britain since 1714, would be raised to a kingdom, known as the Kingdom of Hanover. On 30 December 1814, the Prince Regent signed and ratified the Treaty of Ghent which ended the War of 1812 with the United States. Napoleon returned from exile in 1815, but was defeated at the Battle of Waterloo by Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, brother of Marquess Wellesley.|$|E
5|$|Turkic generals {{led many}} of the Tang Dynasty {{military}} campaigns that expanded the dynasty's territorial reach into Central Asia. In total, ten Turks were able to reach the highest military position of general. Ashina She'er, formerly the ruler of Beshbaliq and Kharakhoja between 630 and 635 {{and a member of}} the Ashina clan, was recruited as a Tang general in 635. He fought as a commander in a successful campaign against Karakhoja in 640. She'er was chosen as the general for the military expedition against Karasahr. The Tang loyalist that had been installed as ruler after the first invasion of Karasahr in 644 by Chinese general Guo Xiaoke was deposed by his cousin in a revolt. The usurper was executed after the rebellion was suppressed, and Tang governance returned to the oasis state. She'er continued onward to the nearby kingdom of Kucha, <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> had supported Karasahr during its war against the Tang.|$|E
5|$|Although {{these acts}} helped empower courts to remedy {{violations}} of federal voting rights, strict legal standards {{made it difficult}} for the Department of Justice to successfully pursue litigation. For example, to win a discrimination lawsuit against <b>a</b> <b>state</b> <b>that</b> maintained a literacy test, the Department needed to prove that the rejected voter-registration applications of racial minorities were comparable to the accepted applications of whites. This involved comparing thousands of applications in each of the state's counties in a process that could last months. The Department's efforts were further hampered by resistance from local election officials, who would claim to have misplaced the voter registration records of racial minorities, remove registered racial minorities from the electoral rolls, and resign so that voter registration ceased. Moreover, the Department often needed to appeal lawsuits several times before the judiciary provided relief because many federal district court judges opposed racial minority suffrage. Thus, between 1957 and 1964, the African-American voter registration rate in the South improved marginally even though the Department litigated 71 voting rights lawsuits.|$|E
