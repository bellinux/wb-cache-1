5|$|Nevertheless, {{the assault}} of the 2nd New Zealand Division had drawn in both 15 and 21 Panzer Divisions, {{with the result}} that there was a wide gap in the Axis lines to the south west.

5|$|The {{abortive}} {{attack on}} Montreal {{led to the}} full mobilization of local militia in Montreal, raising nearly 1,000 men, but they soon began to drift away. Carleton refused to organize an expedition in relief of Fort Saint-Jean, and the militia members from rural parishes eventually disbanded to attend to their harvests and the defense of their own homes. In November, the besieged fort's commander capitulated, opening the Americans' way to Montreal. Carleton fled the city, making his way to Quebec City, <b>and</b> <b>Montgomery</b> occupied Montreal without firing a shot on November 13.|$|E
5|$|While {{the port}} of Antwerp was vital for the Allies after D-Day, Admirals Cunningham and Ramsay warned SHAEF <b>and</b> <b>Montgomery</b> that the port was of no use while the Germans held the approaches. But Montgomery {{postponed}} the Battle of the Scheldt, and the delay in opening the port was a grave blow to the Allied build-up before winter approached.|$|E
5|$|As the {{bombardment}} {{of the city}} proved to be unsuccessful, Montgomery then began to plan for an assault. Montgomery was to assault the Lower Town district, {{the part of the}} city near the river shore, while Arnold was to attack and take the Cape Diamond Bastion, a strong part of the city walls on the highest point of the rocky promontory. Montgomery believed that they should attack during a stormy night, therefore the British {{would not be able to}} see them. On December 27, the weather became stormy, <b>and</b> <b>Montgomery</b> ordered that the men prepare to attack. However, the storm soon subsided <b>and</b> <b>Montgomery</b> called off the attack. As Montgomery waited for a storm, he was forced to revise his plans, because a deserter communicated the original plan to the defenders. In the new plan, Montgomery would attack the Lower Town from the south and Arnold would attack the Lower Town from the north. After breaking through the walls, Montgomery and Arnold would meet up in the city and then attack and take the Upper Town, causing resistance to collapse. To increase their chance of surprise, Montgomery planned two feints. One detachment of troops (the 1st Canadian Regiment under James Livingston) would set fire to one of the gates while another (under the command of Jacob Brown) would engage the guard at Cape Diamond Bastion and fire rockets to signal the start of the attack. While the feints were conducted, artillery would fire into the city. Although Montgomery was reluctant to attack, enlistments for Arnold's men were expiring on January 1, and he was concerned about losing their services.|$|E

5|$|Darby Creek {{flows through}} a narrow valley in its upper reaches and a tidal flat in its lower reaches. The creek is in the Piedmont Uplands and Atlantic Coastal Plain physiographic provinces. Major rock {{formations}} in the watershed include the Wissahickon Formation. Three small dams historically existed on the creek, but were removed in 2012. The watershed of the creek is largely developed, with roughly {{half a million people}} inhabiting it.

5|$|Edward and {{his allies}} amongst the Welsh princes soon began to quarrel, and in early 1282 {{rebellion}} broke out, led by Llwelyn's brother, Dafydd ap Gruffydd. Edward responded to the revolt by mobilising a royal army of 8,000 foot soldiers and 750 cavalry, which he marched north to Rhuddlan, while in South and mid-Wales Marcher Lord forces advanced from Carmarthen <b>and</b> <b>Montgomery.</b> Edward then mounted a naval invasion of the Isle of Anglesey and formed a temporary bridge to cross over onto the mainland, taking the war into the Welsh heartlands of Snowdonia.

5|$|In 1948, Hawks made Red River, an epic western {{reminiscent}} of Mutiny on the Bounty starring John Wayne <b>and</b> <b>Montgomery</b> Clift {{in his first}} film.

This version follows the same plot but pays more attention to popular jazz music and includes such jazz legends as Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, Louis Armstrong, Lionel Hampton, and Benny Carter playing themselves. In 1949, Hawks reteamed with Cary Grant in the screwball comedy I Was a Male War Bride, also starring Ann Sheridan.|$|E
5|$|Mondays through Saturdays, BART trains run on five routes; {{four are}} transbay routes {{connecting}} San Francisco to Oakland and various destinations in the East Bay, while the fifth, the Richmond–Warm Springs line, runs {{exclusively in the}} East Bay. Two of the five routes do not run on nights and weekends, and one is truncated on Saturdays, but all stations remain accessible by transfers via other routes. In September 1972 BART's first route opened: Fremont to MacArthur, extended to Richmond in January 1973. Concord to MacArthur started in May 1973 <b>and</b> <b>Montgomery</b> Street to Daly City began in November 1973. The original system was completed in September 1974 when trains first carried passengers through the underwater Transbay Tube. BART's three routes then were Concord–Daly City, Fremont-Daly City and Richmond–Fremont.|$|E

5|$|Montgomery {{then turned}} the army toward Montreal. The march was {{difficult}} {{as there was}} snow, water, and ice {{on the ground and}} a winter storm struck several days after their departure. In an attempt to stop an escape of British troops from Montreal to Quebec, Montgomery sent a detachment to Sorel where the force briefly clashed with British troops. The British troops quickly withdrew to their vessels in the St. Lawrence River. When Montgomery and the main army reached the outskirts of the city, Montgomery sent a messenger in demanding the surrender of the city or they would suffer bombardment. While negotiations for the city's surrender took place, Carleton fled down the St. Lawrence River in a small flotilla of ships. The city surrendered on November 13, <b>and</b> <b>Montgomery</b> and his army marched into the city without a shot being fired.|$|E
5|$|Past this intersection, {{the route}} {{takes on the}} name Horsham Road and passes near more {{businesses}} as it narrows into a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane and one travel lane in each direction.

The road passes through commercial areas past the Upper State Road intersection and crosses US202. Past Stump Road, PA463 narrows to two lanes total and runs past residential areas and business parks.

5|$|The highway {{has been}} part of a state route since 1924 when it became part of New York State Route8, a road {{continuing}} northeast through Middletown <b>and</b> <b>Montgomery</b> to Newburgh. NY8 was split into two routes as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, with the portion of the highway south of Montgomery becoming New York State Route84. When Interstate84 (I-84) was built along a similar alignment to NY84 in the mid-1960s, the state route was renumbered again in May1966 to prevent confusion between the two roads. The section of NY84 south of Slate Hill was redesignated as NY284 {{while the rest of the}} highway was absorbed by other, pre-existing routes.|$|E
