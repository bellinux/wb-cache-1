5|$|During that year, Tesla {{worked in}} Pittsburgh, helping {{to create an}} {{alternating}} current system to power the city's streetcars. He found it <b>a</b> <b>frustrating</b> period because of conflicts with the other Westinghouse engineers over how best to implement AC power. Between them, they settled on a 60-cycle AC current system that Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), but they soon found {{that it would not}} work for streetcars, since Tesla's induction motor could run only at a constant speed. They ended up using a DC traction motor instead.|$|E
5|$|In his youth, Dugan {{was fascinated}} by the {{technical}} aspects of theatre. He worked as a lighting designer then transitioned to sound design in 1967. Dugan became interested in achieving the automatic adjustment of sound controls after <b>a</b> <b>frustrating</b> experience staging the musical Hair. His first automixer design was not fully practical but his second design was successful; it used a reference derived from a total of all of its microphone signals. Dugan devised a third improvement which helped prevent audio feedback in the presence of sound reinforcement loudspeakers. Dugan next produced an automixer design that could be inserted into an existing mixing console. This proved popular for broadcast and live sound applications. Each of Dugan's subsequent automixer models has been of the insertable type.|$|E
5|$|The 1999–2000 season {{proved to}} be <b>a</b> <b>frustrating</b> one for both Arsenal and Bergkamp. The club {{finished}} second in the league, 18 points behind Manchester United, and lost in the 2000 UEFA Cup Final to Turkish opponents Galatasaray on penalties. The departure of compatriot Marc Overmars and French midfielder Emmanuel Petit in the close season led to speculation over Bergkamp's future. He ultimately agreed terms on a contract extension in December 2000. Despite an array of new signings made in the 2000–01 season, Arsenal were runners-up in the league for a third year in succession. The emergence of Thierry Henry and Sylvain Wiltord as the main strikers saw Bergkamp's first-team opportunities limited as a result. He was used as a late substitute in Liverpool's win over Arsenal in the 2001 FA Cup Final.|$|E

5|$|The 2008–09 {{season was}} <b>a</b> <b>frustrating</b> one for Phaneuf, as he {{recorded}} a career-low 11 goals and 47 points, and his poor plus-minus rating of –11 led fans to question his defensive commitment. His poor season and high salary {{also led to}} speculation that Phaneuf might be traded. In spite of his struggles, Phaneuf averaged 26 minutes and 31 seconds of ice time per game, the fourth highest in the League. He missed {{the final game of}} the Flames' 2009 Stanley Cup playoff Western Quarter-final series against the Chicago Blackhawks with broken ribs, after battling a hip injury during the regular season. Flames management defended Phaneuf, claiming that the injuries he battled affected his play.|$|E
5|$|He {{was still}} {{suffering}} from the shoulder injury in June 2004, and under new manager Russell Slade, Young endured <b>a</b> <b>frustrating</b> spell. A cold {{he was suffering from}} in August 2004 required treatment from physio Dave Moore as it put him out of action. Young joined Conference National club Northwich Victoria on 7 October 2004 on a one-month loan, having made five appearances for Grimsby up to that point in 2004–05. He made his debut two days later in a 0–0 away draw with Crawley Town. On 23 October 2014, he scored his first goal for Northwich in a 3–1 away victory over Forest Green Rovers with a close-range shot. He was recalled by Grimsby later that month due to injuries after making three appearances for Northwich. He rejoined Northwich on 3 December 2004 on another one-month loan, with injury restricting him to three appearances before returning to Grimsby on 6 January 2005.|$|E
5|$|Many critics saw A Link Between Worlds as {{a worthy}} {{successor}} to A Link to the Past, but also remarked {{that the game}} was outstanding in its own right. The game was commended for making enhancements to core and traditional elements of the series. New additions and changes to the established formula were also welcomed. Polygon reviewer Arthur Gies called it the best Zelda game in past twenty years, and GamesRadar writer Lorenzo Veloria {{said that it was}} an essential title for every Nintendo 3DS owner. Reception towards the game's puzzles was overwhelmingly positive; praise was directed towards how well the wall-merging mechanic had been incorporated into dungeon puzzles and integrated into every area of the game. Keza MacDonald of IGN thought A Link Between Worlds was the best puzzle game that Nintendo had ever created. Game Informer writer Dan Ryckert noted that some of the game's dungeons and boss encounters were {{among the best in the}} franchise's history. The level of difficulty present in the puzzles and dungeons was met with approval; the challenge was described as a perplexing experience rather than <b>a</b> <b>frustrating</b> one by GameSpot editor Martin Gaston.|$|E

5|$|On August 23, 1938, Bush was {{appointed}} to the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), the predecessor of NASA. Its chairman Joseph Sweetman Ames became ill, and Bush, as vice chairman, soon had to act in his place. In December 1938, NACA asked for $11 million to establish a new aeronautical research laboratory in Sunnyvale, California, to supplement the existing Langley Memorial Aeronautical Laboratory. The California location was chosen for its proximity to some of the largest aviation corporations. This decision was supported by the chief of the United States Army Air Corps, Major General Henry H. Arnold, and by the head of the navy's Bureau of Aeronautics, Rear Admiral Arthur B. Cook, who between them were planning to spend $225 million on new aircraft in the year ahead. However, Congress was not convinced of its value, and Bush had to appear before the Senate Appropriations Committee on April 5, 1939. It was <b>a</b> <b>frustrating</b> experience for Bush, since he had never appeared before Congress before, and the senators were not swayed by his arguments. Further lobbying was required before funding for the new center, now known as the Ames Research Center, was finally approved. By this time, war had broken out in Europe, and the inferiority of American aircraft engines was apparent, in particular the Allison V-1710 which performed poorly at high altitudes and had to be removed from the P-51 Mustang in favor of the British Rolls-Royce Merlin engine. The NACA asked for funding to build a third center in Ohio, which became the Glenn Research Center. Following Ames's retirement in October 1939, Bush became chairman of the NACA, with George J. Mead as his deputy. Bush remained a member of the NACA until November 1948.|$|E

25|$|Gareth Southgate's 100th game in charge, {{which saw}} Stewart Downing named captain {{for the first}} time in Emanuel Pogatetz' absence was <b>a</b> <b>frustrating</b> one.

Instead, they were left to pick up the pieces after a 1–0 defeat {{courtesy}} of Jonas Olsson.|$|E
25|$|Kent started strongly, winning four {{of their}} first five matches. However, in <b>a</b> <b>frustrating</b> {{remainder}} of the season they failed to win any further matches in the championship and slipped to 5th place in the table. One match, against Derbyshire at Queen's Park, Chesterfield in September, was abandoned as a draw without a ball being bowled due to heavy rain and a wet outfield. As a result the team only played 13 of the scheduled 14 matches.|$|E
