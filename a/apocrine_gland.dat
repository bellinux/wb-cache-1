25|$|The breast is an <b>apocrine</b> <b>gland</b> that {{produces}} the milk used to feed an infant. The nipple of the breast is surrounded by the areola (nipple-areola complex). The areola has many sebaceous glands, and the skin color varies from pink to dark brown. The basic units of the breast are the terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs), which produce the fatty breast milk. They give the breast its offspring-feeding functions as a mammary gland. They are distributed throughout {{the body of the}} breast. Approximately two-thirds of the lactiferous tissue is within 30mm of the base of the nipple. The terminal lactiferous ducts drain the milk from TDLUs into 4–18 lactiferous ducts, which drain to the nipple. The milk-glands-to-fat ratio is 2:1 in a lactating woman, and 1:1 in a non-lactating woman. In addition to the milk glands, the breast is also composed of connective tissues (collagen, elastin), white fat, and the suspensory Cooper's ligaments. Sensation in the breast is provided by the peripheral nervous system innervation by means of the front (anterior) and side (lateral) cutaneous branches of the fourth-, fifth-, and sixth intercostal nerves. The T-4 nerve (Thoracic spinal nerve 4), which innervates the dermatomic area, supplies sensation to the nipple-areola complex.|$|E
50|$|Sebaceous and <b>apocrine</b> <b>glands</b> {{become active}} at puberty. This, {{as well as}} many <b>apocrine</b> <b>glands</b> being close to the sex organs, points to a role related to mating. Compared to other primates, humans have {{extensive}} axillary hair and have many odor producing sources, in particular many <b>apocrine</b> <b>glands.</b> In women, the sense of olfaction is strongest around the time of ovulation, significantly stronger than during other phases of the menstrual cycle and also stronger than the sense in males.|$|R

Domestic animals such as dogs and cats have <b>apocrine</b> <b>glands</b> at each hair {{follicle}} but eccrine glands only in foot pads and snout. Their <b>apocrine</b> <b>glands,</b> like those in humans, produce an odorless, oily, opaque secretion that gains its characteristic odor upon bacterial decomposition.

40|$|<b>Apocrine</b> <b>glands</b> of Moll are regular {{components}} of primate eyelids. We studied {{the distribution and}} localization of these glands in three different primate species, the common marmoset, the rhesus monkey, and the hamadryas baboon. In addition, we tested the primate glands of Moll with antibodies against antimicrobial proteins, cytoskeletal proteins and the androgen receptor. The glands of Moll differ in abundance and distribution in different monkeys. In the common marmoset, {{a representative of the}} New World monkeys, Platyrrhini, the <b>apocrine</b> <b>glands</b> are frequently found at the lid margin and in the overlying epidermis of the lid. In the rhesus monkey and the hamadryas baboon, representatives of Old World monkeys, Catarrhini, <b>apocrine</b> <b>glands</b> are rarer and located predominantly at the margin of the lid. The immunohistochemical analysis indicates the presence of a variety of antimicrobial proteins, e. g. lysozyme, beta-defensin- 2, adrenomedullin, lactoferrin, and IgA, in these glands. Interestingly, there are basically no androgen receptors in the nuclei of <b>apocrine</b> <b>glands</b> at the lid margin in all three monkey species. In the common marmoset, however, androgen receptors are found in <b>apocrine</b> <b>glands</b> of the overlying epidermis of the lid. We speculate that the glands of Moll are derived from <b>apocrine</b> <b>glands</b> as found in the skin of the entire body in New World monkeys which developed at the lid margins of higher primates and humans into specialized glands secreting agents of host defense in the eye.

50|$|Apocrine is a {{term used}} to {{classify}} exocrine glands {{in the study of}} histology. Cells which are classified as apocrine bud their secretions off through the plasma membrane producing membrane-bound vesicles in the lumen. The apical portion of the secretory cell of the gland pinches off and enters the lumen. It loses part of its cytoplasm in their secretions. <b>Apocrine</b> <b>glands</b> are found primarily in the breast of lactating mammals (i.e. the mammary <b>glands</b> are <b>apocrine</b> <b>glands).</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>apocrine</b> <b>gland</b> {{is made up}} of a [...] of {{secretory}} tubules and an excretory duct {{that opens}} into a hair follicle; on occasion, an excretory duct opens to the skin surface next to the hair. The gland is large and spongy, located in the subcutaneous fat deep in the dermis, and has a larger overall structure and lumen diameter than the eccrine sweat gland. The secretory tubules of apocrine glands are single layered, but unlike the eccrine secretory tubules, contain only a single type of ductal epithelial cell, varying in diameter according to their location, and sometimes branching off into multiple ducts. The tubules are wrapped in myoepithelial cells, which are more developed than in their eccrine gland counterparts.|$|E

5000|$|This gene is {{a member}} of a phylogenetically conserved family of genes that share a common DNA-binding domain, the T-box.
