40|$|In the literature, {{the impact}} angle control {{problem has been}} {{addressed}} mostly against lower speed or stationary targets. However, in the current defense scenario, targets of much higher speeds than interceptors are a reality. Moreover, approaching a higher speed target from a specified angle is important for effective seeker acquisition and enhanced warhead effectiveness. This paper proposes a composite proportional navigation guidance law {{using a combination of}} the standard proportional navigation and the recently proposed retroproportional navigation guidance laws for intercepting higher speed nonmaneuvering targets at specified impact angles in three-dimensional engagements. An analysis of the set of achievable impact angles by the composite proportional navigation guidance law is presented. It is shown that there exists an impulse bias that, when added to the composite proportional navigation guidance command, expands this set further by reversing the direction of the line-of-sight <b>angular</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>vector.</b> A bound on the magnitude of the bias is also derived. Finally, an implementation of this impulse bias, {{in the form of a}} series of pulses, is proposed and analyzed. Simulation results are also presented to support the analysis...|$|R

5000|$|Note {{that many}} <b>rotation</b> <b>vectors</b> {{correspond}} to the same rotation.

Furthermore, all rotations by [...] are the same as no rotation at all, so, for a given integer , all <b>rotation</b> <b>vectors</b> of length , in all directions, constitute a two-parameter uncountable infinity of <b>rotation</b> <b>vectors</b> encoding the same rotation as the zero vector. These facts {{must be taken into account}} when inverting the exponential map, that is, when finding a <b>rotation</b> <b>vector</b> that corresponds to a given rotation matrix.

40|$|GINGER (Gyroscopes IN General Relativity) is a {{proposal}} for an Earth-based experiment to measure the Lense-Thirring (LT) and de Sitter effects. GINGER is based on ring lasers, which are the most sensitive inertial sensors to measure the rotation rate of the Earth. We show that two ring lasers, one at maximum signal and the other horizontal, would be the simplest configuration able to retrieve the GR effects. Here, we discuss this configuration in detail showing {{that it would have}} the capability to test LT effect at 1 %, provided the accuracy of the scale factor of the instrument at the level of 1 part in 1012 is reached. In principle, one single ring laser could do the test, but the combination of the two ring lasers gives the necessary redundancy and the possibility to verify that the systematics of the lasers are sufficiently small. The discussion can be generalised to seismology and geodesy and it is possible to say that signals 10 - 12 orders of magnitude below the Earth rotation rate can be studied; the proposed array {{can be seen as the}} basic element of multi-axial systems, and the generalisation to three dimensions is feasible adding one or two devices and monitoring the relative angles between different ring lasers. This simple array can be used to measure with very high precision the amplitude of angular rotation rate (the length of the day, LOD), its short term variations, and the angle between the <b>angular</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>vector</b> and the horizontal ring laser. Finally this experiment could be useful to probe gravity at fundamental level giving indications on violations of Einstein Equivalence Principle and Lorenz Invariance and possible chiral effects in the gravitational field...|$|R
