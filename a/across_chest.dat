50|$|Cycladic art {{originates}} between 2600 and 1100 BC. Those that {{inhabited the}} Cycladic Islands {{during this time}} period left very little trace of their existence apart from their stone tombs. Cycladic art includes {{a large number of}} marble idols, almost all representing an upright standing nude figure, most commonly female and with arms folded <b>across</b> <b>chest.</b> The female figure is thought to represent the mother and fertility goddess. Cycladic nude figurines are fairly primitive yet distinctive to the area. They are defined by very flat, wedge shaped bodies, columnar necks and oval featureless faces apart from well defined noses. Figures have very subtle curves and subtle markings of knees and abdomen.|$|E
5000|$|Northern District Baseball Club inc. was {{established}} in 1969 with the merger of Prospect Baseball Club (Est 1936) and Enfield Baseball Club (Est 1954), for the new format of the summer Baseball season.Since {{the formation of the}} club the uniform has maintained the colours of Red and White in several combinations. The 1995/96 season saw the introduction of the uniform being predominately white with top marked with red piping around the collar and down button row with 1’’ red bands on sleeve ends and Norths printed down the left hand front panel. The trousers have a red band down the sides and a red belt. This is finished off with a red hat with white lettering ‘ND’ on the front, and red socks The red and white colour combination is the base colour for most northern Adelaide sporting clubs.In 1999/20 with a second Under12 div2 team, another uniform was required to separate the two teams. Red tops with white neck a band and sleeve ends were adopted. One with Norths in white letters down front left side. The other with Reds in white letters <b>across</b> <b>chest.</b> This was the birth of the ‘Reds’This led to the seniors adopting the name ‘Reds’ and changing the top to red with white lettering and sleeves being changed to black During Northern Districts Baseball Club’s history, the club has had 87 teams in final four positions, 14 Premierships and 12 runners-up.The club has produced 27 South Australian Baseball Medal winners.This included an Australian club record set in season 1976/77, when the club had six medal winners, 4 seniors and 2 juniors.Don Masters Div.1, Doug Hendry Div.4, Julius Szlazak Div.5, Barry Grieves Div.6,Peter Moore U.17, Leon Faulkner U.15 ...|$|E
40|$|Objectives. To {{investigate}} (1) {{the association}} of seat height and (2) {{the association of}} arm position on the five times sit-to-stand test (FTSTS) times of individuals with stroke. Design. A cross-sectional study. Setting. University-based rehabilitation centre. Subjects. Patients (n= 43) with chronic stroke. Methods. The times in completing the FTSTS with different seat height (85 %, 100 %, and 115 % knee height) and arm positions (arms <b>across</b> <b>chest,</b> hands on thighs). Results. FTSTS times were significantly different between 85 % and 100 % seat heights, and between the 85 % and 115 % seat heights in both arm positions. However, {{there was no significant}} difference between the FTSTS times with the two arm positions at any seat height tested. Conclusion. Seat heights lower than the knee height result in longer FTSTS times, whereas arms positions did not significantly affect the FTSTS times. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the interaction of}} seat height and arm position with completion times for the Five Times Sit-To-Stand test (FTSTS) in older women. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: University-based rehabilitation centre. Subjects: Thirty-three women (mean age 61. 8 years, standard deviation 5. 3) participated in this cross-sectional study. Methods: Time taken to complete the FTSTS with different seat heights (85 %, 100 % and 115 % of knee height) and arm positions (arms <b>across</b> <b>chest,</b> or hands on thighs) was measured with a stopwatch. Results: FTSTS completion times differed significantly between seat heights of 85 % and 115 % knee height and between seat heights of 100 % and 115 % knee height for both arm positions. There {{was no significant difference}} between FTSTS completion times for the 2 arm positions at any seat height. Conclusion: A lower seat height resulted in longer FTSTS completion times in women over 55 years of age, whereas arm position did not significantly affect FTSTS completion times.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} main {{characteristics}} of the magneto-hemodynamic (MHD) response for application as a biomarker of vascular blood flow. The induced surface potential changes of a volunteer exposed to a 3  T static B 0 field of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) magnet were measured over time at multiple locations by an electrocardiogram device and compared to simulation results. The flow simulations were based on boundary conditions derived from MRI flow measurements restricted to the aorta and vena cava. A dedicated and validated low-frequency electromagnetic solver was applied to determine the induced temporal surface potential change from the obtained 4 D flow distribution using a detailed whole-body model of the volunteer. The simulated MHD signal agreed with major {{characteristics of the}} measured signal (temporal location of main peak, magnitude, variation <b>across</b> <b>chest</b> and along torso) except {{in the vicinity of}} the heart. The MHD signal is mostly influenced by the aorta; however, more vessels and better boundary conditions are needed to analyze the finer details of the response. The results show that the MHD signal is strongly position dependent with highly variable but reproducibly measurable distinguished characteristics. Additional investigations are necessary before determining whether the MHD effect is a reliable reference for location-specific information on blood flow...|$|E
40|$|While in Suriname during June 1964, I had the {{opportunity}} of collecting a series of a species of Hyla {{that seems to be}} undescribed. It seems appropriate that this species be known as Hyla boesemani sp. nov. (fig. 1) Diagnosis. — A small Hyla with vomerine tooth patches close together or contiguous; with just a trace of web between the fingers; fourth toe webbed {{to the base of the}} penultimate phalanx; a small but well-developed patagium; a very distinct skin fold <b>across</b> <b>chest.</b> It has a dorsal pattern of scattered light spots, a distinct, narrow, postocular dark stripe, and lacks a pattern on the thigh although the latter has a small amount of uniformly distributed pigment present. This species is perhaps most easily confused with the members of the Hyla leucophyllata-group because of its pale, unpatterned thighs. It differs from these, though, in the fact that its thighs are gray rather than pink in life and in that in preservative the thigh, although without a pattern, is covered with a rather uniform gray pigmentation rather than being pigmentless as are those of the members of the leucophyllata-group. Holotype. — Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie 12601, adult male, collected near Zanderij, Suriname District, Suriname, on June 16, 1964, by Coleman J. Goin and D. C. Geijskes. Paratypes. — Fourteen, all adult males, as follows: Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie (RMNH) 12602, 12603; Florida State Museum 22367; and Coleman J.
