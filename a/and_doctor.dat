40|$|Aim:- To {{compare the}} self-construal of nurses <b>and</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> {{establish}} whether their roles affect perceptions {{of independence and}} interdependence. Background:- Previous research has identified that errors in patient care occur when health professionals do not work cohesively as a team and have divergent beliefs about collaboration. Thus, {{it is important to}} understand factors shaping these beliefs. Although these are usually explained by aspects of group norms, the concept of self-construal may serve as an underlying explanation. Design:- A quasi-experimental design was used. Participants:- One hundred and two nurses <b>and</b> <b>doctors</b> working in three nursing homes in Belgium took part in this study in 2009. Methods:- Nurses' and doctors' self-construal was measured at their workplace, using Singelis' self-construal scale. Statistical differences between nurses <b>and</b> <b>doctors</b> were investigated using analysis of covariance. Results:- Results showed statistically significant differences between doctors' <b>and</b> nurses' self-construal. <b>Doctors</b> reported higher <b>and</b> dominant levels of ‘independent self-construal’ compared with nurses. There were no differences between nurses <b>and</b> <b>doctors</b> for interdependence. However, gender differences emerged with male doctors reporting lower levels of interdependent self-construal than male nurses. Conversely, female doctors reported higher levels of interdependent self-construal than female nurses. Conclusions:- Differences in the roles and training of nurses <b>and</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>and</b> in knowledge of their interdependencies may explain differences in self-construal. This might be useful for understanding why nurses <b>and</b> <b>doctors</b> develop divergent attitudes towards teamwork. Training that focuses on sharing knowledge on team interdependencies may positively influence teamwork attitudes and behaviour...|$|R

5|$|Around {{the same}} time gay men were getting sick in the U.S., doctors in Paris, France, were {{receiving}} patients who were African or {{who had lived in}} Africa with the same symptoms as Americans. Parisian researchers Jean-Claude Chermann, Françoise Barre, Luc Montagnier, <b>and</b> <b>doctor</b> Willy Rozenbaum began taking biopsies of HIV-infected lymph nodes and discovered a new retrovirus. As a scientific necessity to compare it to the American version of HIV, French doctors representing the Pasteur Institute sent a colleague to the National Cancer Institute, where Robert Gallo was also working on the virus. The colleague switched the samples, Shilts reported, because of a grudge he had against the Pasteur Institute. Instead of Gallo comparing his samples with the French samples, he found the very same retrovirus as the French sample, putting back any new results in AIDS research for at least a year.|$|E
