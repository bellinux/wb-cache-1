5|$|Two {{weeks after}} {{the lifting of the}} Soviet {{moratorium}} in August 1961, and after another failed Anglo-American attempt to have the Soviet Union agree to an atmospheric-test ban, the US restarted testing on 15 September 1961. Kennedy specifically limited such testing to underground and laboratory tests, but under mounting pressure as Soviet tests continued, Kennedy announced and dedicated funds to a renewed <b>atmospheric</b> <b>testing</b> program in November 1961.|$|E
5|$|Declassified US {{documents}} {{indicate that}} the US may have violated the PTBT's ban on <b>atmospheric</b> <b>testing</b> in 1972 by, at the instruction of Henry Kissinger, monitoring and collecting data on French atmospheric tests over the Pacific Ocean, which may have amounted to cooperation with the French program. Declassified documents also {{indicate that the}} US and UK circumvented the prescribed verification system in 1964–65 by establishing a series of additional control posts in Australia, Fiji, Mauritius, Pakistan, and South Africa.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Bethe, {{along with}} IBM {{physicist}} Richard Garwin, {{published an article}} criticising in detail the anti-ICBM defense system proposed by the Department of Defense. The two physicists described in the article that nearly any measure taken by the US would be easily thwarted with the deployment of relatively simple decoys. Bethe {{was one of the}} primary voices in the scientific community behind the signing of the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty prohibiting further <b>atmospheric</b> <b>testing</b> of nuclear weapons.|$|E

500|$|On {{this matter}} of resumed <b>atmospheric</b> <b>tests,</b> Kennedy lacked the full backing of his {{administration}} and allies. In particularly, Macmillan, Adlai Stevenson (then the UN ambassador), the State Department, the United States Information Agency, and Jerome Wiesner, the PSAC chairman, opposed resuming <b>atmospheric</b> <b>tests.</b> On the side advocating resumption were the AEC, Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, Joint Chiefs of Staff (which had called for renewed <b>atmospheric</b> <b>tests</b> in October 1961), and Department of Defense, though then-Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara privately acknowledged that such tests were [...] "not really necessary." [...] Teller continued to advocate for <b>atmospheric</b> <b>tests,</b> as well, arguing in early 1962 that nuclear fallout was nothing be concerned about. Teller also argued that testing was necessary to continued advancement of US nuclear capabilities, particularly {{in terms of the}} mobility of its weapons and, accordingly, its second-strike capability.|$|R

5|$|In October 1962, the US and Soviet Union {{experienced}} the Cuban Missile Crisis, which brought the two superpowers {{to the edge}} of nuclear war and prompted both Kennedy and Khrushchev to seek accelerated rapprochement. After years of dormant or lethargic negotiations, American and British negotiators subsequently forged a strong working relationship and with Soviet negotiators found common ground on test restrictions later in 1962. After years of pursuing a comprehensive ban, Khrushchev was convinced to accept a partial ban, partly due to the efforts of Soviet nuclear scientists, including Kurchatov, Sakharov, and Yulii Borisovich Khariton, who argued that <b>atmospheric</b> <b>testing</b> had severe consequences for human health. Khrushchev had been concerned by a partial ban due to the greater US experience in underground tests; by 1962, the US had conducted 89 such tests and the Soviet Union just two (the Soviet focus had been on cheaper, larger-yield atmospheric tests). For this reason, many in the Soviet weapons industry argued that a partial ban would give the US the advantage in nuclear capabilities. Khrushchev would later recount that he saw test-ban negotiations as a prime venue for ameliorating tensions after the crisis in Cuba.|$|E
5|$|On 22 August 1958, Eisenhower {{announced}} {{a moratorium on}} nuclear testing, effective 31 October 1958. This did not mean an immediate end to testing; on the contrary, the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom all rushed to perform as much testing as possible before the deadline, which the Soviets did not meet, conducting tests on 1 and 3 November. A new British test series, known as Grapple Z, commenced on 22 August. It explored new technologies {{such as the use}} of external neutron initiators, which had first been tried out with Orange Herald. Core boosting using tritium gas and external boosting with layers of lithium deuteride were successfully tested in the Pendant and Burgee tests, allowing a smaller, lighter Tom for two-stage devices. The international moratorium commenced on 31 October 1958, and Britain ceased <b>atmospheric</b> <b>testing</b> for good.|$|E
5|$|The decade {{following}} {{ratification of}} the PTBT (1963–72) featured more US nuclear tests than the decade prior (1953–62). In the following decade, the US conducted 385 nuclear tests and 23 peaceful nuclear explosions (PNEs), versus 268 tests and three PNEs in the preceding decade. In contrast, the number of Soviet detonations fell from 218 in the preceding decade to 157 in the following decade, as the Soviet Union {{was never able to}} meet the pace of US underground explosions. China and France, both non-signatories, conducted 53 tests between 1963 and 1973. In all, 436 tests were conducted between the signing of the PTBT and 1 July 1973, compared to 499 tests between 16 July 1945 and the signing of the PTBT. In the 1960s and 1970s, China conducted 22 atmospheric tests and France conducted 50. The last atmospheric test was conducted by China in 1980, after French <b>atmospheric</b> <b>testing</b> stopped in 1974. Public opposition to nuclear testing continued following the treaty's enactment. Greenpeace was founded in 1971 in opposition to a planned underground test on the Alaskan island of Amchitka. In 1982, a Greenpeace ship docked at Leningrad without permission demanding that the Soviet Union stop testing.|$|E

25|$|Currently NSW Ambulance {{operates}} six primary rescue {{units in}} rural NSW and employs over 200 rescue officers. The rural stations are located at Rutherford, Tamworth, Singleton, Cowra, Bomaderry and Wagga Wagga. Officers are trained for {{all forms of}} rescue including, road crash, vertical, confined space, swift water, trench, industrial, technical and domestic to name a few. They learn navigation skills, four wheel driving, urban search and rescue, and chemical biological and radiological procedures. Rescue training commences with the recruitment of up to 12 officers, who are selected to undergo a rigorous six week training course. On successful completion of the course, officers are then rostered to rescue units where training continues with a minimum eight hours of structured training per month. Officers are also required to undergo a recertification program. Ambulance rescue vehicles are equipped with {{a vast array of}} equipment including motorised hydraulic tools, air tools, hand held global positioning satellite units, fibre optic search scopes, portable <b>atmospheric</b> <b>testing</b> units, inflatable boat, lighting and breathing apparatus.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. Navy has {{periodically}} {{monitored the}} environmental {{conditions of the}} site since the sinking and has reported the results in an annual public report on environmental monitoring for U.S. nuclear-powered ships and boats. The reports provide specifics on the environmental sampling of sediment, water, and marine life that is done to ascertain whether the submarine has significantly affected the deep-ocean environment. The reports also explain the methodology for conducting this deep sea monitoring from both surface vessels and submersibles. The monitoring data confirm {{that there has been}} no significant effect on the environment. The nuclear fuel aboard the submarine remains intact and no uranium in excess of levels expected from the fallout from past <b>atmospheric</b> <b>testing</b> of nuclear weapons has been detected by the Navy's inspections. In addition, Scorpion carried two nuclear-tipped Mark 45 anti-submarine torpedoes (ASTOR) when she was lost. The warheads of these torpedoes are part of the environmental concern. The most likely scenario is that the plutonium and uranium cores of these weapons corroded to a heavy, insoluble material soon after the sinking, and they remain at or close to their original location inside the torpedo room of the boat. If the corroded materials were released outside the submarine, their density and insolubility would cause them to settle into the sediment.|$|E

The Grapple Y test the following April obtained {{most of its}} yield [...] from nuclear fusion, and the Grapple Z test series later that year demonstrated a mastery of thermonuclear weapons technology. An international moratorium on nuclear tests commenced on 31 October 1958, and Britain ceased <b>atmospheric</b> <b>testing</b> for good. The successful development of the hydrogen bomb, along with the Sputnik crisis, resulted in the 1958 US–UK Mutual Defence Agreement, in which the nuclear Special Relationship was restored.|$|E
500|$|The {{final test}} in the Grapple Z series was [...] of Burgee, at 09:00 on 23 September 1958. This was another balloon-borne test.

500|$|Despite Teller's reassurances, Kennedy himself [...] "hated {{the idea}} of reopening the race" [...] and was uneasy with {{continued}} production of fallout, a negative consequence of resumed testing that its opponents within the administration stressed. Opponents of the tests also argued that renewed atmospheric tests would come at a significant moral cost to the US, given broad public opposition to the plan, and claimed that further tests were largely unnecessary, with the US already having an adequate nuclear arsenal. Arthur Dean believed that public opposition to <b>atmospheric</b> <b>testing</b> {{was so great that}} the US would have to halt such tests within four years even without an agreement. John Kenneth Galbraith, then the ambassador to India, had advised Kennedy in June 1961 that resumed testing [...] "would cause us the gravest difficulties in Asia, Africa and elsewhere."
