25|$|Later in 2008–2010 new {{infrared}} spectroscopic observations with {{a higher}} signal-to-noise ratio revealed additional spectral features. Among them are a deep water ice <b>absorption</b> <b>band</b> at 1.65μm, which is an evidence of the crystalline water ice {{on the surface of}} Orcus, and a new <b>absorption</b> <b>band</b> at 2.22μm. The origin of the latter feature is not completely clear. It can be caused either by ammonia/ammonium dissolved in the water ice or by methane/ethane ices. The radiative transfer modeling showed that a mixture of water ice, tholins (as a darkening agent), ethane ice and ammonium ion (NH4+) provides the best match to the spectra, whereas a combination of water ice, tholins, methane ice and ammonia hydrate gives a slightly inferior result. On the other hand, a mixture of only ammonia hydrate, tholins and water ice failed to provide a satisfactory match. So, as of 2010, the only reliably identified compounds on the surface of Orcus are crystalline water ice and, possibly, dark tholins. A firm identification of ammonia, methane and other hydrocarbons requires better infrared spectra.|$|E

The resulting hydrate, {{like many other}} neodymium salts, has the interesting property that it appears different colors under fluorescent light- In the chloride's case, light yellow (see picture). The color difference is likely due to the charge transfer converting the Nd3+ ions into the Nd2+ state; the orange <b>absorption</b> <b>band</b> of Nd3+ decreases and the green Nd2+ absorption increases producing the yellowish color.|$|E

25|$|For nearby {{objects in}} the universe, {{spectral}} absorption lines are very sharp, as only photons with energies just sufficient to cause an atomic transition can cause that transition. However, the distances between quasars and the telescopes which detect them are large, {{which means that the}} expansion of the universe causes light to undergo noticeable redshifting. This means that as light from the quasar travels through the IGM and is redshifted, wavelengths which had been above the Lyman Alpha limit are stretched, and will in effect begin to fill in the Lymann <b>absorption</b> <b>band.</b> This means that instead of showing sharp spectral absorption lines, a quasar's light which has traveled through a large, spread out region of neutral hydrogen will show a Gunn-Peterson trough.|$|E

2500|$|Changes in the (M-L) bond {{distances}} {{are going}} to affect the symmetry and electronic states of metal complexes. [...] UV-vis spectroscopy is a very useful tool for the determination of the changes of electronic states due to the SCO. [...] For example, the HS and LS states of an FeII compound such as FeII(pic)3Cl2·EtOH, can be followed with UV-vis spectroscopy. [...] The absorption spectra of these FeII molecules at different temperatures clearly show the change in intensities of the spin allowed transitions, due to these symmetric changes. Similarly to FT-IR, the intensities of the absorption bands are proportional to the fraction of metal centers in the corresponding spin state; the more intense the band, the higher the fraction of metal centers in that spin state. [...] In Figure 9, the 5T2→5E <b>absorption</b> <b>band,</b> (left spectrum), corresponds to the HS transition and is centered at 830nm. [...] The optical density of the HS band is proportional to the γHS, and a γHS vs. temperature can be plotted as in Figure 10. The LS state is seen at a higher energy which is centered at 470nm (shown on the right in Figure 9). [...] However, the LS state absorption bands are indistinguishable due to the high intensity absorption bands caused by the Metal-to-Ligand Charge Transfer (MLCT) absorption bands.|$|E
2500|$|Some gases have {{indirect}} radiative effects (whether or {{not they}} are greenhouse gases themselves). This happens in two main ways. One way is that when they break down in the atmosphere they produce another greenhouse gas. For example, methane and carbon monoxide (CO) are oxidized to give carbon dioxide (and methane oxidation also produces water vapor, as discussed later). Oxidation of CO to [...] directly produces an unambiguous increase in radiative forcing although the reason is subtle. The peak of the thermal IR emission from Earth's surface is very close to a strong vibrational <b>absorption</b> <b>band</b> of [...] (15 microns, or 667cm−1). On the other hand, the single CO vibrational band only absorbs IR at much shorter wavelengths (4.7 microns, or 2145cm−1), where the emission of radiant energy from Earth's surface is at least a factor of ten lower. [...] Oxidation of methane to , which requires reactions with the OH radical, produces an instantaneous reduction in radiative absorption and emission since [...] is a weaker greenhouse gas than methane, although [...] has a longer lifetime. As described below this is not the whole story, since the oxidations of CO and [...] are intertwined by both consuming OH radicals. In any case, the calculation of the total radiative effect needs to include both the direct and indirect forcing.|$|E

2500|$|Thermal {{perturbations}} {{are by far}} {{the most}} common type of external stimulus used to induce SCO. There are many examples of complexes that exhibit SCO with the aid of thermal variation. One such example was reported in 2007 by Dunbar et al. in which a pentanuclear cluster exhibits the SCO phenomenon. Figure 11 shows the 32 trigonal bipyramid (TBP), with the FeII centers in the equatorial positions and Figure 12 shows a 57Fe Mössbauer spectrum at 300 K for the cluster. Dunbar et al. had found that increasing the temperature causes a major change in the cluster’s electronic structure. The amount of HS FeII present in any sample within the range of 4.2 K to 50 K does not change and remains under 20%, but at room temperature about two-thirds of the FeII ions in the sample of water-containing crystals exhibit a HS state, as shown by the <b>absorption</b> <b>band</b> at 2.1mm/s, while the other third of the ions remain in the LS state. This shows that either every TBP cluster converts from a [...] at 4.2 K to [...] at room temperature or that two-thirds of the clusters change from [...] to [...] over the same range of temperature. In addition to the crystals containing water, Dunbar et al. studied the effect of interstitial solvent on SCO by studying acetonitrile-containing crystals as well. This study revealed a similar phenomenon but over a lower temperature range, data that support the conclusion that weak effects such as crystal packing environments can affect SCO as well.|$|E
2500|$|Following the Pioneer {{encounters}} and in {{the lead}} up to the Voyager fly-bys in 1979, interest in Io and the other Galilean satellites grew, with the planetary science and astronomy communities {{going so far as}} to convene a week of dedicated Io observations by radio, visible, and infrared astronomers in November 1974 known as [...] "Io Week." [...] New observations of Io from Earth and by the Pioneers during the mid-1970s caused a paradigm shift in thinking about its surface chemistry and formation. The trend in the densities of the four Galilean satellites found by Pioneer10 suggested that the satellites formed as part of a collapsing nebula, like a miniature version of what took place in the Solar System as a whole. The initial hot Jupiter prevented the condensation of water at the orbits of Io and Europa, leading those bodies to have higher densities than the outer two moons. Spectroscopic measurements of the light reflected from Io and its surrounding space were made with increasing spectral resolution during the 1970s, providing new insights into its surface composition. Other observations suggested that Io had a surface dominated by evaporites composed of sodium salts and sulfur. This was consistent with Io lacking water ice either on its surface or in its interior, in contrast with the other Galilean satellites. An <b>absorption</b> <b>band</b> near 560nm was identified with the radiation-damaged form of the mineral halite.
