5|$|As it is {{difficult}} to <b>accurately</b> identify a safe mushroom without proper training and knowledge, it is often advised to assume that a wild mushroom is poisonous and not to consume it.|$|E
5|$|At Actun Tunichil Muknal cave {{in central}} Belize, {{researchers}} drilling stalagmites with a computer- controlled dental drill <b>accurately</b> identified and verified evidence of isotopically light rainfall for 11 tropical cyclones occurring over a 23-year period (1978–2001).|$|E
5|$|He thus very <b>accurately</b> {{described}} {{the four years}} of war to come.|$|E
5|$|Horse collar: A {{significant}} {{improvement of the}} ancient breast harness was the horse collar. The horse collar was depicted in a Northern Wei (386–534) mural at Dunhuang, China, dated 477–499; the latter artwork does not feature the essential collar cushion behind the cross bar, though, while a later Tang Dynasty (618–907) mural of about 851 <b>accurately</b> displays the cushioned collar behind the cross bar. An earlier painting of the Sui Dynasty (581–618) <b>accurately</b> depicted the horse collar as it is seen today, yet the illustration shows its use on a camel instead of a horse.|$|E
5|$|IIIIn {{addition}} to these figures, approximately 3,600 French men were wounded, with over 900 captured or missing, and almost 5,520 Austrians were wounded, with over 2,900 captured (missing numbers cannot be <b>accurately</b> estimated).|$|E
5|$|In consequence, the West {{section of}} the Notitia does not <b>accurately</b> {{represent}} the western army structure as it stood in 395 (for which the eastern structure is probably a better guide).|$|E
5|$|In general, a rotary broach {{will not}} cut as <b>accurately</b> as a push or pull broach. However, {{the ability to}} use this type of cutting tool on common machine tools is highly advantageous.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} to make a precise measurement, due to the difficulty in <b>accurately</b> calibrating the instruments used, {{and the problem of}} spatial coverage. Nonetheless, the effect is almost certainly present.|$|E
5|$|Jeff Morey, {{who served}} as the {{historical}} consultant on the film Tombstone, compared testimony by partisan and neutral witnesses and {{came to the conclusion that}} the Earps described the situation <b>accurately.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nipper {{began to}} study horses {{in an effort to}} portray them more <b>accurately.</b> Her {{father-in-law}} was a professional horse trainer and farrier, and she began painting pictures of him at work.|$|E
5|$|Outer {{space is}} a {{convenient}} setting {{for measuring the}} speed of light because of its large scale and nearly perfect vacuum. Typically, one measures the time needed for light to traverse some reference distance in the solar system, such as the radius of the Earth's orbit. Historically, such measurements could be made fairly <b>accurately,</b> compared to how <b>accurately</b> the length of the reference distance is known in Earth-based units. It is customary to express the results in astronomical units (AU) per day.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{valuable}} use of an accurate orbit for a binary star system is to directly calculate the masses of the stars. This requires the dimensions and inclination of the orbit to be <b>accurately</b> known. The dimensions of Eta Carinae's orbit are only known approximately as the stars cannot be directly and separately observed. The inclination has been modelled at 130–145 degrees, but the orbit is still not known <b>accurately</b> enough to provide the masses of the two components.|$|E
5|$|Representing the Group {{is a way}} for {{participants}} to learn about how groups communicate and how to represent one group to another. They learn how to <b>accurately</b> represent their group to another.|$|E
5|$|The Wire {{employs a}} broad {{ensemble}} cast, supplemented by many recurring guest stars who populate the institutions {{featured in the}} show. The majority of the cast is black, which <b>accurately</b> reflects the demographics of Baltimore.|$|E
5|$|The {{cranial nerves}} are {{considered}} {{components of the}} peripheral nervous system (PNS), although on a structural level the olfactory, optic and terminal nerves are more <b>accurately</b> {{considered part of the}} central nervous system (CNS).|$|E
5|$|The fossa was {{depicted}} as an antagonist in the DreamWorks 2005 animated film Madagascar, <b>accurately</b> shown as the lemurs' most feared predator.|$|E
5|$|The star {{had been}} {{observed}} many {{times by the}} Hipparcos satellite, which allowed astronomers to calculate the orbital period of HD 209458 b very <b>accurately</b> at 3.524736 days.|$|E

5|$|Though she {{was paid}} only $10.50 per week, her {{discovery}} {{of a way to}} <b>accurately</b> measure distances on an inter-galactic scale paved the way for modern astronomy’s understanding of the structure and scale of the universe.|$|E
5|$|Xenon {{chloride}} and xenon fluoride {{have also}} been used in excimer (or, more <b>accurately,</b> exciplex) lasers.|$|E
5|$|Yellow-tinted screens (primarily {{affecting}} white-cased units). It {{turned out}} the previous models had a less <b>accurately</b> calibrated screen and thus displayed images with a bluish tint.|$|E
5|$|A Jamaican-born maid {{threatened}} with deportation by Shaw's theft. To perform her character's Jamaican accent, Sidibe had three dialect coaches help her prepare and practiced {{with a friend}} of Jamaican heritage. Additionally, Sidibe worked with an actual safecracker to <b>accurately</b> portray breaking into locks. Sidibe was cast on October 19, 2010.|$|E
5|$|A partial {{recreation}} of the Kowloon Walled City {{exists in}} the Kawasaki Warehouse, an amusement arcade that opened in 2009 in the Japanese suburb of Kawasaki, Kanagawa. The designer's desire to <b>accurately</b> replicate {{the atmosphere of the}} Walled City is reflected in the arcade's narrow corridors, electrical wires, pipes, postboxes, sign boards, neon lights, frayed posters, and various other small touches that provide an air of authenticity.|$|E
5|$|Aetosaur fossil remains {{are known}} from Europe, North and South America, parts of Africa and India. Since their {{armoured}} plates are often preserved and are abundant in certain localities, aetosaurs serve as important Late Triassic tetrapod index fossils. Many aetosaurs had wide geographic ranges, but their stratigraphic ranges were relatively short. Therefore, {{the presence of}} particular aetosaurs can <b>accurately</b> date a site that they are found in.|$|E
5|$|After the Scilly naval {{disaster}} of 1707 where four ships ran aground due to navigational mistakes, the British government offered a large prize of £20,000, equivalent {{to millions of}} pounds today, for anyone who could determine longitude <b>accurately.</b> The reward was eventually claimed in 1761 by Yorkshire carpenter John Harrison, who dedicated his life to improving the accuracy of his clocks.|$|E
5|$|Although the art {{produced}} (particularly pottery, grave stelai and figurines) {{was used}} by {{a wider range of}} people than much Athenian literature was—including women and children—it is not known how <b>accurately</b> the iconography of classical art mapped the reality of classical society.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} popular {{activities}} for an Australian Cattle Dog is dog agility. It is ideally suited for navigating obstacle courses, since as a herding dog it is reactive to the handler's body language and willing to work <b>accurately</b> {{at a distance from}} the handler. Agility has been used by Cattle Dog owners to instil confidence in their dogs, and enhance their performance in training and competition.|$|E
5|$|Animal {{navigation}} is {{the ability}} of many animals to find their way <b>accurately</b> without maps or instruments. Birds such as the Arctic tern, insects such as the monarch butterfly and fish such as the salmon regularly migrate thousands of miles to and from their breeding grounds, and many other species navigate effectively over shorter distances.|$|E
5|$|Astronomers {{calculate}} {{the age of}} the Universe by assuming that the Lambda-CDM model <b>accurately</b> describes the evolution of the Universe from a very uniform, hot, dense primordial state to its present state and measuring the cosmological parameters which constitute the model. This model is well understood theoretically and supported by recent high-precision astronomical observations such as WMAP and Planck. Commonly, the set of observations fitted includes the cosmic microwave background anisotropy, the brightness/redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, and large-scale galaxy clustering including the baryon acoustic oscillation feature. Other observations, such as the Hubble constant, the abundance of galaxy clusters, weak gravitational lensing and globular cluster ages, are generally consistent with these, providing a check of the model, but are less <b>accurately</b> measured at present. With the prior that the Lambda-CDM model is correct, the measurements of the parameters using a variety of techniques by numerous experiments yield a best value of {{the age of the}} Universe as of 2015 of 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years.|$|E
5|$|Barium is a soft, silvery-white metal, with {{a slight}} golden shade when ultrapure. The silvery-white color of barium metal rapidly vanishes upon {{oxidation}} in air yielding a dark gray oxide layer. Barium has a medium specific weight and good electrical conductivity. Ultrapure barium {{is very difficult to}} prepare, and therefore many properties of barium have not been <b>accurately</b> measured yet.|$|E
5|$|Because {{species of}} aetosaurs {{typically}} have restricted fossil ranges and are {{abundant in the}} strata they are found in, they are useful in biochronology. Osteoderms {{are the most common}} remains associated with aetosaurs, so a single identifiable scute can <b>accurately</b> date the layer it is found in.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1986 Idaho {{license plates}} {{depicted}} a basic mountain range {{that was supposed}} to represent the Sawtooths; in 1991 the plates were revised to more <b>accurately</b> represent the mountains. The Idaho Division of Motor Vehicles also created a license plate depicting the SNRA.|$|E
5|$|Byne's disease, more <b>accurately</b> {{known as}} Bynesian decay, is a {{peculiar}} and permanently damaging condition (resulting from an ongoing chemical reaction) which often attacks mollusk shells {{that are in}} storage or on display {{for long periods of}} time.|$|E
5|$|Decompression may be {{continuous}} or staged, {{where the}} ascent {{is interrupted by}} stops at regular depth intervals, but the entire ascent {{is part of the}} decompression, and ascent rate can be critical to harmless elimination of inert gas. What is commonly known as no-decompression diving, or more <b>accurately</b> no-stop decompression, relies on limiting ascent rate for avoidance of excessive bubble formation.|$|E
5|$|Difficulties in <b>accurately</b> {{locating}} Flight 11 {{caused a}} delay of five minutes, to 8:43am, before the scramble order was given and pilots Duffy and Nash could respond. When Flight 11 hit the North Tower at 8:46, the two jets were still readying for flight {{and did not}} take off until 8:52am.|$|E
