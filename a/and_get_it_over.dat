500|$|People Carrie Bell {{enjoyed the}} episode, praising {{the balance of}} cast members. She called Isaac [...] "beloved", {{and found that the}} {{teamwork}} in the episode proved [...] "there's no 'I' in team". Former Star-Ledger editor Alan Sepinwall gave a positive review of the entry, applauding the shift in themes and Shepherd's character development. Writing for BuddyTV, Glenn Diaz found the episode comical, calling the scene in which Robbins stands up to Webber [...] "hilarious", and naming Yang the installment's [...] "comic relief". Referring to Shepherd and Webber's constant arguments, an AfterEllen senior editor said: [...] "Seriously, these two need to drop their pants <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> with."

500|$|Burton {{stated in}} an {{interview}} that he enjoyed the plot twist, and compared it to Jason Morgan being Monica Quartermaine's (Leslie Charleson) son on General Hospital. He said that he felt a connection while working with Scott, stating: [...] "There is vulnerability there between us, and it’s not on purpose. It’s just something that is there. It was actually kind of there before it happened that we were on-screen mother and son." [...] In a separate interview with Michael Logan of TV Guide, Scott stated: [...] "Nikki thinks she has come up with a good way of having everyone informed in the kindest way possible. If it were me, I would think, [...] "I can only go through this once. It's too emotional! Let's sit everybody down at the same time <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> with." [...] Nikki had intended to reveal the news privately to Dylan but that opportunity never comes up." [...] Speaking of how the revelation would affect Nicholas, Scott added, [...] "She feels very badly about Nick losing Avery but not bad enough that she doesn't expect Nick to play nice and accept this man — not necessarily as a brother but still as a member of the family. She expects him to find a way to be civil. She wants everyone to be happy together." [...] Speculation also arose that Nikki's son could be Dylan's best friend Stitch Rayburn (Sean Carrigan), to which Scott teased, [...] "Maybe that's coming. Nikki had cult twins! You never know. I think Sean Carrigan could believably play my son. I think he looks a little like me, probably more like me than Steve Burton does." ...|$|E
500|$|The Welcome to the Universe Tour {{garnered}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. Jay Cridlin of the St. Petersburg Times praised the {{performance at the}} Jannus Landing, saying that Thirty Seconds to Mars proved to be [...] "a legitimate musical force." [...] Karen Bondowski from Livewire gave a positive review of the concert at the Eagles Ballroom in Milwaukee and complimented songs like [...] "A Beautiful Lie", [...] "Attack", [...] "From Yesterday", [...] "Buddha for Mary" [...] and [...] "R-Evolve". The reviewer {{also said that the}} band [...] "delivered the giant choruses and electrified but deliciously spacey guitars with a genuine fervor." [...] Chad DuPriest from Pegasus News was impressed by the show at Ridglea Theatre in Fort Worth and said [...] "That's what really makes this band stand out. They don't merely go to a concert to perform <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> with, they aim to grow their cult and seek recognition – and they do this by putting on a badass concert." [...] He also commented, [...] "Most impressive were the phenomenal lighting effects, able to present the stage as everything from a strobe-lit nightmare to a peaceful realm of lucidity for the light guitar solos." [...] Karah Leigh from the Houstonist gave a positive review of concert at the Verizon Wireless Theater and wrote that the band [...] "completely blew us away", saying that they [...] "did an amazing job." [...] The reviewer however criticized the lack of participation by the audience. Matthew J. Palm of the Orlando Sentinel gave a positive review of the concert and wrote that [...] " [...] Leto doesn't follow rules. [...] He can rock your socks off—employing a throat-shredding delivery on pulsating crowd-pleasers such as [...] "A Beautiful Lie", [...] "The Kill" [...] and [...] "Savior." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{called her}} {{in with the}} {{intention}} of at once saying what he had to say, <b>and</b> <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> in the fewest words. But he had not reckoned fully either with his own nature or with woman's instinct. Nor had he allowed--being, for all his learning, perhaps because of it, singularly unable to gauge the effects of simple actions--for the proprietary relations he had established in the girl's mind by giving her those clothes.|$|R

500|$|For {{the first}} series, {{interior}} sets were {{built at the}} Blue Shed Studios in Salford. Three directors and three film crews were used to film the six 50-minute episodes over 14 weeks from March to May 1998. Locations included an empty shop unit near Piccadilly station for the charity shop sex scene in Episode 3 and a Masonic Lodge for the gala dinner scenes in Episode 6. In the second year, the sets were moved to the Spectrum Arena in Warrington, where filming ran from March to June. The series featured the first location shoots outside Manchester; a short scene in Episode 2 featuring Bathurst was filmed over half a day in Blackpool; Bathurst, Norris and a small production crew filmed scenes in Paris for Episode 3; exterior location scenes of the characters on holiday in Episode 6 were filmed on Lindisfarne, though the castle interiors were shot at Hoghton Tower. The second series also featured more visual effects; in Episode 5 Adam dreams about being chased by a giant testicle (which was computer-generated) and in Episode 6 a fireworks explosion was supervised by pyrotechnics experts. The testicle dream scene drew mixed reaction. The Mirrors television critic Charlie Catchpole praised it but Robert Bathurst was critical: [...] "I hated that sequence. I thought it was really unfunny. It was a lousy prop and awful graphics and {{there was too much}} of it—it would have been much better if it was like a Monty Python foot come smacking down like that <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> with. You couldn't keep up that surprise and hilarity for all the minutes it was on the screen." [...] By the third series, Cold Feets sets were permanently located on a Granada warehouse stage and were left intact between series. This meant the basic sets could be used on other Granada programmes, such as The Grimleys and My Beautiful Son. After the final episode was filmed in 2002, the sets were dismantled and taken to a landfill.|$|E
500|$|Homer and Marge are {{scheduled}} to do a singing toast at their cousin Valerie's wedding, causing Marge to become nervous, due to her fear of embarrassment. Homer tells her not to worry, saying that he will {{make sure they do}} not mess up. Homer gets a fortune cookie stating that today will be his lucky day, but he does not believe so. However, he starts to believe this occurs when he crashes into a vending machine causing all of the snacks to fall out on him, and finds an Emerson, Lake & Palmer CD in the parking lot. He sings along to [...] "Lucky Man", driving recklessly to the synthesizer solo. He then goes to the Kwik-E-Mart for a lottery ticket, even though he has to go to the wedding and sing with Marge. After a long wait, Homer gets his lottery ticket, only to find out the wedding has ended. When he takes his eyes off the road for a second, he crashes off the ramp. Homer wakes up in the hospital after the crash, and realizes he won a million dollars in the lottery. Homer does not want Marge to know he missed the wedding to get a lottery ticket, and has Barney pose as the winner. So that Marge does not know he won the money, he secretly leaves gifts for his family members. However, when Homer tries to get money out of the tree where he hid the money, Bart discovers that he won the lottery. Threatening to tell Marge, Bart demands that Homer publicly embarrasses himself, does unethical tasks, and becomes a victim of his own son. Eventually, Homer decides to tell Marge himself <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>over</b> with. Taking Marge on a hot-air balloon, he reveals he won the lottery, causing Marge to become very glad and not furious about his absence at the wedding; he tells her he spent it all, leaving them poor as usual. However, Marge does not care, saying at least they have each other. Homer then reveals he spent the last of the money on a giant cherry blossom grove in the shape of Marge's face with the words [...] "Love of my Life". They then sing the song they were supposed to sing at the wedding together, off in the sunset.|$|E
2500|$|Managed by Newt Joseph, {{the team}} also {{included}} Byron [...] "Mex" [...] Johnson, but otherwise it mostly functioned as a minor-league team staffed by marginal, aging, or young players. Playing throughout Kansas, Missouri, the Dakotas, Illinois, and even Utah, large crowds turned out to see Paige throw an inning or two, relying on junkballs. Paige recalled, [...] "Everybody'd heard I was a fastballer and here I was throwing Alley Oops and bloopers and underhand and sidearm and any way I could {{to get the ball}} up to the plate <b>and</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>over,</b> maybe even for a strike. But even that made my arm ache like a tooth was busting every time I threw. And the balls I was throwing never would fool anybody in the Negro leagues, not without a fast ball to go with them." ...|$|E

5000|$|In a 1983 interview, Peter Brown said that, having {{turned down}} all {{previous}} offers {{to share his}} recollections of the Beatles, {{he had decided to}} write a book in 1979 because of the many inaccurate accounts that had been published.
