The Amer Fort, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>stands</b> <b>now,</b> was built over the remnants of this earlier structure {{during the reign of}} Raja Man Singh, the Kachwaha King of Amber. The structure was fully expanded by his descendant, Jai Singh I. Even later, Amer Fort underwent improvements and additions by successive rulers over the next 150 years, until the Kachwahas shifted their capital to Jaipur during the time of Sawai Jai Singh II, in 1727.|$|E
25|$|A major {{shrine of}} Lord Shiva worship since the {{classical}} period, {{there have been}} several renovations and offerings to Chidambaram by the Pallava, Chola, Pandya, Vijayanagara and Chera royals in the ancient and pre-medieval periods. The temple <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>stands</b> <b>now</b> is mainly of the 12th and 13th centuries, with later additions in similar style. Its bronze statues and stone sculptures depicting various deities and the famous Thillai trees (Excoecaria agallocha) of the surrounding forest reflect the highpoints of early Chola and Pallava art while its famed gold plated gopuram towers are medieval structural additions by the royals Aditya I, Parantaka Chola I, Kopperunchinga I, Krishnadevaraya and Jatavarman Sundara Pandyan. King Kocengannan Chola was born following prayers his parents offered at the temple and later in his life he refined its structure. The shrine gave the town its name.|$|E
500|$|Early Byzantine {{architecture}} {{followed the}} classical Roman model of domes and arches, but improved upon these elements, {{as in the}} Church of the Saints Sergius and Bacchus. The oldest surviving Byzantine church in Istanbul—albeit in ruins—is the Monastery of Stoudios (later converted into the Imrahor Mosque), which was built in 454. After the recapture of Constantinople in 1261, the Byzantines enlarged {{two of the most}} important churches extant, Chora Church and Pammakaristos Church. The pinnacle of Byzantine architecture, and one of Istanbul's most iconic structures, is the Hagia Sophia. Topped by a dome [...] in diameter, the Hagia Sophia stood as the world's largest cathedral for centuries, and was later converted into a mosque and, <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>stands</b> <b>now,</b> a museum.|$|E

Edge considered Tomb Raider III [...] "a valid addition to the growing franchise", stating that it offers more attractive graphics and more innovation than Tomb Raider II, while Computer and Video Games described it as [...] "a perfect mix of the exploration and puzzles of the original, and the more-to-shoot nature of the sequel." [...] Other critics, however, felt that the game failed to change the same tried and tested formula. In its 1998 review, IGN said that Tomb Raider III [...] "solves none of its original dilemmas, and <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>stands</b> <b>now,</b> the exploration-adventure genre—one that was revolutionized by Tomb Raider—is in the exact spot it was two years ago." ...|$|E
500|$|Nagore Dargah (also called Nagoor Dargah or Hazrat Syed Shahul Hameed Dargah) is a dargah {{built over}} {{the tomb of the}} Sufi saint Nagore Shahul Hamid (1490–1579 CE). It is located in Nagore, a coastal town in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Outer doors kept open always. Internal doors opening time is from 4:30 am to 07:00 am and 6:25 pm to 9:30 pm. Friday alone {{additionally}} kept open from 12 noon to 2:30 pm also. Hazrath Shahul Hamid is believed to have performed many miracles in Nagore, and cured the physical affliction of king Achutappa Nayak, a 16th-century Hindu ruler of Thanjavur. He is locally referred to as Nagore Andavar, meaning the [...] "god of Nagore". Nagore dargah <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>stands</b> <b>now,</b> {{is believed to have been}} built by ardent devotees of Hazrath Shahul Hamid, with major contribution from Hindus. There are five minarets in the dargah, with the Hindu Maratha ruler of Thanjavur Pratap Singh (1739–1763 CE), building the tallest minaret. The dargah is a major pilgrimage centre that attracts pilgrims from both Islam and Hinduism, symbolizing peaceful coexistence between the two religions.|$|E

It is native to Mexico, but there has been a [...] "diplomatic patent" [...] on the plant since the early 19th century when the first US ambassador to Mexico, Joel Roberts Poinsett, registered it. The state's historical society has asked the Secretary of the Interior to review treaties and work to have this patent annulled. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>stands</b> <b>now,</b> Mexican poinsettia growers must pay royalty fees to the U.S. and even import cuttings from authorized growers in the U.S. to grow the plant commercially. Another effort to combat the patent is to develop a new variety of the flower that would not be covered.|$|E

With the commercial success of punk and alternative rock bands in the early 1990s, All began considering offers from major labels. [...] "Major label talk started probably around '93 or '94", recalled guitarist Stephen Egerton. [...] "We maybe were just looking to sort of {{go to the next}} place, maybe. We had done this slow building up to where as many as a thousand people might be coming to see us in some places, which for us was a huge deal, so we thought we'd try to see if maybe we could get the records out to more people." [...] "In {{the past year or so}} we've seen bands like Green Day and Season to Risk turning up at the Walmart in Brookfield, Missouri", [...] remarked bassist Karl Alvarez. [...] "We really like the idea of getting our records in places where people go who aren't hip to the mom-and-pop record stores that traditionally carry the independents. People forget that punk rock was on the majors early on with bands like Iggy and the Ramones. The fact that the major labels ignored the real groundbreaking rock of the '80s gave everyone a real bad feeling about the majors, but <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>stands</b> <b>now,</b> they are starting to get a little hipper." ...|$|E

60|$|I do {{not know}} that blame is to be {{attached}} to any one. I at least attach no such blame. Probably it might be easy now to show that the road might have been made with sufficient accommodation for ordinary purposes without some of the more costly details. The great tubular bridge, on which was expended 1,300,000 pounds, might, I should think, have been dispensed with. The Detroit end of the line might have been left for later time. <b>As</b> <b>it</b> <b>stands</b> <b>now,</b> however, it is a wonderful operation carried to a successful issue as far as the public are concerned; and one can only grieve that it should be so absolute a failure to those who have placed their money in it. There are schemes which seem to be too big for men to work out with any ordinary regard to profit and loss. The Great Eastern is one, and this is another. The national advantage arising from such enterprises is immense; but the wonder is that men should be found willing to embark their money where the risk is so great and the return even hoped for is so small.|$|E
6000|$|This I {{presume to}} be: that every citizen {{has a right}} to share in {{choosing}} those who make the laws; in order to prevent, as far as he can, laws being made which are unjust and injurious to him, to his family, or to his class; and that all are to be considered as 'active' citizens, save the criminal, the insane, or those unable to support themselves. The best rough test of a man's being able to support himself is, I doubt not, his being able to keep a house over his head, or, at least, a permanent lodging; and that, I presume, will be in a few years the one and universal test of active citizenship, unless we should meanwhile obtain the boon of a compulsory Government education, and an educational franchise founded thereon. But, it must be asked--and answered also--What is there in such a test, even <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>stands</b> <b>now,</b> only partially applied, which is not as fair for women as it is for men? 'Is it just that an educated man, who is able independently to earn his own livelihood, should have a vote: but that an equally educated woman, equally able independently to earn her own livelihood, should not? Is it just that a man owning a certain quantity of property should have a vote in respect of that property: but that a woman owning the same quantity of property, and perhaps a hundred or a thousand times more, should have no vote?' What difference, founded on Nature and Fact, exists between the two cases? ...|$|E
6000|$|It is <b>as</b> <b>it</b> <b>stands</b> <b>now</b> {{the frank}} {{confession}} {{of what one}} man of the early Twentieth Century has found in life and himself, a confession just as frank as the limitations of his character permit; it is his metaphysics, his religion, his moral standards, his uncertainties and the expedients with which he has met them. On {{every one of these}} departments and aspects I write--how shall I put it?--as an amateur. In every section of my subject there are men not only of far greater intellectual power and energy than I, but who have devoted their whole lives to the sustained analysis of this or that among the questions I discuss, and there is a literature so enormous in the aggregate that only a specialist scholar could hope to know it. I have not been unmindful of these professors and this literature; I have taken such opportunities as I have found, to test my propositions by them. But I feel that such apology as one makes for amateurishness in this field has a lesser quality of self-condemnation than if one were dealing with narrower, more defined and fact-laden matters. There is more excuse for one here than for the amateur maker of chemical theories, or the man who evolves a system of surgery in his leisure. These things, chemistry, surgery and so forth, we may take on the reputation of an expert, but our own fundamental beliefs, our rules of conduct, we must all make for ourselves. We may listen and read, but the views of others we cannot take on credit; we must rethink them and [...] "make them our own." [...] And we cannot do without fundamental beliefs, explicit or implicit. The bulk of men are obliged to be amateur philosophers,--all men indeed who are not specialized students of philosophical subjects,--even if their philosophical enterprise goes no further than prompt recognition of and submission to Authority.|$|E
