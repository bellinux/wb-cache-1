5|$|An <b>ad-hoc</b> Kampfgruppe Panzergrenadier Sturmbattalion {{manned by}} officer cadets, with 1st Company of the 202nd Panzer Battalion, {{under the command}} of the 7th SS Division, was to advance from Banja Luka toward Ključ to seize the {{crossing}} point across the Sana utilised by the Partisans.|$|E
5|$|Atrocities {{continued}} {{during the}} German retreat from Southern France as German soldiers plundered and burned down towns. French civilians were brought before <b>ad-hoc</b> military courts {{and sentenced to}} death because of alleged partisan activities. These atrocities did not help to subdue the French uprising. Instead, the German reprisals had the opposite effect and encouraged the French population to engage in partisan fighting.|$|E
5|$|On {{returning}} to England, Fowler {{has worked with}} League One side Milton Keynes Dons on an <b>ad-hoc</b> basis to assist the club's coaching staff. On 7 April 2011, Bury confirmed that Fowler would join their coaching staff for one week to assist Richie Barker. Fowler briefly coached Liverpool's strikers in April 2011.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 1 September, with only the {{shattered}} remnants its E Company at hand, the U.S. 9th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division, had virtually no troops to defend Yongsan. Division commander Major General Lawrence B. Keiser formed <b>ad-hoc</b> units from his support troops {{but they were not}} enough to counter the North Korean attack.|$|E
5|$|The Overman Committee was {{formally}} an <b>ad-hoc</b> {{subcommittee of the}} Senate Committee on the Judiciary, but had no formal name. It was chaired by Senator Lee Slater Overman and also included Senators Knute Nelson of Minnesota, Thomas Sterling of South Dakota, William H. King of Utah, and Josiah O. Wolcott of Delaware.|$|E
5|$|With {{his newly}} reorganised units, Dahlquist {{attempted}} a direct attack against Montélimar, which failed against the newly arrived German tank units. The subsequent German counter-attack gained some ground against the hills {{occupied by the}} Allies. Its aim was to push the Americans from the hills north of Montélimar and to force the American artillery to move back out of range. After the fighting the Germans captured a copy of Dahlquist's operational plans, giving them a better picture of the Allied forces. As a result, Wiese planned a major attack for 25August by the 11thPanzer Division {{as well as the}} 198th Infantry Division, together with some <b>ad-hoc</b> Luftwaffe battlegroups. This attack was, however, also a big failure. The Allies struck back, retook the hills north of Montélimar, and were able to establish a temporary roadblock on the German escape route. Again, this Allied success also did not last long, as another <b>ad-hoc</b> attack led by Wietersheim reopened the passage at midnight.|$|E
5|$|Youth of Nan Chiau is {{the youth}} {{wing of the}} Nan Chiau Alumni Association that {{comprises}} the youth graduates from both Nan Chiau High and Nan Chiau Primary. The youth wing plays a supportive role alongside the NCAA during events, gatherings when need arises. The youth wing also organizes activities for students of Nan Chiau High and Nan Chiau Primary on an <b>ad-hoc</b> basis.|$|E
5|$|After {{the closing}} in 1991 the {{foundation}} Stiftelsen Rjukanbanen {{was established to}} ensure that the railway remained in an operational condition, and kept the two railway ferries and some of the rolling stock in operational condition. Norsk Transport retained for a period maintenance of the Rjukan Line, while the Tinnoset Line remained part of the rail network maintained by the Norwegian National Rail Administration. The foundation operated <b>ad-hoc</b> charter services on both the Tinnoset Line and the Rjukan Line, as well as with both railway ferries. By 2004 the foundation had run out of money, and closed down.|$|E
5|$|Braathens (until 1998 {{known as}} Braathens SAFE) was a Norwegian {{scheduled}} and charter airline that operated from 1946 to 2004. The airline used 53 airports serving 50 destinations, 23 {{of which were}} in Norway and 6 in Sweden. Braathens provided international services to 24 airports serving 22 cities in 17 countries. Seven of these cities are in Asia, the rest in Europe. In addition, Braathens served numerous destinations as both a regular and an <b>ad-hoc</b> charter airline. Braathens' main hubs were Oslo Airport, Fornebu (1949–98), Oslo Airport, Gardermoen (1998–2007) and Stockholm Arlanda Airport (1997–99). The main technical base was at Stavanger Airport, Sola.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{delivery}} of 26 Pz.Kpfw. 35(t)s during 1942, Romania could only muster 59 R-2/Pz.Kpfw. 35(t)s on 1 April and 30 August 1943, but raised this to 63 by 25 March 1944. There were 44 on hand on 19 July 1944. By this time they were relegated to training duties with the 1st Training Armoured Division. A company of R-2s was sent to Transnistria with the <b>ad-hoc</b> Cantemir Mixed Tank Group on 24 February 1944, {{but it did not}} see combat before being withdrawn on 28 March 1944.|$|E
5|$|Institute Professors are {{initially}} {{nominated by}} leaders representing either a department or school. The {{chair of the}} faculty then consults with the Academic Council and jointly appoints with the president an <b>ad-hoc</b> committee from various departments and non-MIT members to evaluate the qualifications and make a documented recommendation to the president. The final determination is made based upon recommendations from professionals in the nominee's field. The case is then reviewed again by the Academic Council {{and approved by the}} Executive Committee of the MIT Corporation.|$|E
5|$|On Crete, Kippenberger was {{promoted}} to temporary colonel and given command of the 10th Brigade, an <b>ad-hoc</b> formation, which included a 750-man composite battalion consisting mainly of artillery and Army Service Corps men (sans most of their heavy equipment and trucks), New Zealand Divisional Cavalry, some machine gunners and two Greek regiments (although Kippenberger assessed the Greek units to be of limited use). His 20th Battalion was {{also part of the}} brigade but strict controls were in place around its deployment and use.|$|E
5|$|One {{issue that}} was {{foreseen}} {{as a potential}} problem was the supply of skilled officers to the Army in wartime, and a committee was established in 1906 under Sir Edward Ward to study the matter. It issued two reports, one focusing on university and school corps, {{and one on the}} Special Reserve. The main recommendation of the former was to reorganise the existing school Cadet Corps and university Rifle Corps, which had been formed on an <b>ad-hoc</b> basis as part of the broader Volunteer movement, into a uniform force, administered and supported by the War Office.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the birth}} of ASL, sign {{language}} had been used by various communities in the United States. In the United States, as elsewhere in the world, hearing families with deaf children have historically employed <b>ad-hoc</b> home sign, which often reaches much higher levels of sophistication than gestures used by hearing people in spoken conversation. As early as 1541 at first contact by Francisco Vásquez de Coronado, there were reports that the Plains Indians had developed a sign language to communicate between tribes of different languages.|$|E
5|$|Strachwitz led an <b>ad-hoc</b> {{formation}} in Operation Doppelkopf (double-head) {{as part of}} Dietrich von Saucken's XXXIX Panzer Corps counter-offensive following the major Soviet advance in Operation Bagration. Von Saucken's goal was to relieve the encircled forces in the Courland Pocket. Strachwitz's attack on 18 August 1944 was preceded by a heavy artillery bombardment from the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen; forces inside the pocket attacked to link up with Strachwitz's force. His troops reached the 16. Armee at Tukums by midday.|$|E
5|$|The iPhone 5S was {{the first}} Apple device to ship with iOS 7, which {{introduced}} a revamped visual appearance and other new features. Designed by Jonathan Ive, iOS 7 departed from skeuomorphic elements used by previous versions of iOS {{in favor of a}} flat, colorful design. Among new software features introduced to the iPhone 5S were AirDrop, an <b>ad-hoc</b> Wi-Fi sharing platform; Control Center, a control panel containing a number of commonly used functions; and iTunes Radio, an internet radio service. Earphones known as EarPods were included with the 5S, and Apple released accessories including a case and a dock.|$|E
5|$|The {{order by}} Allawi to attack Fallujah again came on 6 November, {{just four days}} after George W. Bush was reelected as president. 1st Marine Division {{commander}} General Richard F. Natonski assembled an <b>ad-hoc</b> force of six Marine battalions, three Army battalions, three Iraqi battalions, and the British Black Watch Regiment. The insurgents, loosely led by Zarqawi, Abdullah al-Janabi, and Zarqawi's lieutenant Hadid, had replaced their losses and reportedly now had between 3,000 and 4,000 men in the city. They planned to hinder the Marine advance with roadblocks, berms, and mines, while conducting attacks outside the city to tie down Marine units.|$|E
5|$|To {{assist in}} {{controlling}} the region, an <b>ad-hoc</b> formation called Craforce was established. Under {{the command of}} the division's commander, Royal Artillery Brigadier C. H. Colquhoun, were the division's artillery, the 17th/21st Lancers, the 1st Parachute Battalion and the 1st Battalion Irish Guards. Craforce became involved with breaking up attacks between Arab and Jewish forces. The Arabs did not directly attack the British, but did engage them when British attempted to intervene in an attack on Jewish settlements.|$|E
5|$|As most Vietnamese are {{stateless}} residents, {{they seek}} a living through <b>ad-hoc</b> various {{industries such as}} the construction, recycling and prostitution industries or as street pedlars. Vietnamese that live along the Tonle Sap lake and Mekong rivers are subsistence fishermen. A sizeable number of these stateless Vietnamese consisted of migrants that came to Cambodia between 1992 and 1993 during the UNTAC administration. The majority of Vietnamese still {{live below the poverty}} line, although {{a very small number of}} Vietnamese are represented in the Cambodian business sector. One example is Sok Kong, the head of the business conglomerate Sokimex which owns state concessionaires in the country's petroleum, tourism and entrepot industries.|$|E
5|$|On 21 August, Taskforce Butler {{occupied}} the hills {{north of the}} town of Montélimar, according to revised orders from Truscott, as he considered it too weak to block the entire German force marching north. From this position, Taskforce Butler fired on the evacuating German troops, while waiting for further reinforcements. Troops from the FFI supported the Americans, harassing German troops through the entire battle. The sudden appearance of this new threat shocked Wiese and the German command. As a first countermeasure, Wietersheim's 11thPanzer Division was called in. The first of its units to arrive, together with several <b>ad-hoc</b> Luftwaffe battle groups, were tasked to deal with this new threat. This hastily assembled force mounted an attack against Puy the same day, and the Germans were able to isolate Taskforce Butler from supplies. This success was, however, short-lived, and the Germans were pushed back soon after.|$|E
5|$|The Paramount Television Network aired several programs, {{including}} the Emmy Award-winning children's series Time for Beany. Filmed in Hollywood, the programs {{were distributed to}} an <b>ad-hoc</b> network of stations across the United States. The network signed affiliation agreements with more than 50 television stations in 1950; despite this, most of Paramount's series were not widely viewed outside the West Coast. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which filed suit against Paramount for anti-trust violations, prevented the studio from acquiring additional television stations. Paramount executives eventually gave up {{on the idea of}} a television network, and continued to produce series for other networks. In 1995, after four decades of television production for other companies, Paramount re-entered the broadcast network field when the company and Chris-Craft Industries launched the United Paramount Network (UPN), a television network that operated until 2006. Paramount's television division is now owned by CBS Television Studios.|$|E
5|$|The {{evacuation}} of Greece divided the regiment: regimental headquarters {{and most of}} HQ Squadron were sent to Egypt {{and most of the}} other three squadrons remained on Crete. A total of 194 soldiers from the regiment were on the island, with several wounded men evacuated to Egypt; A, B and C Squadrons trained and re-equipped. The troops of the regiment on the island, commanded by Major J. T. Russell and renamed Russell Force, joined the <b>ad-hoc</b> 10th NZ Brigade under newly promoted Acting Colonel Howard Kippenberger and was positioned on the road from Chania to Alikianos. Russell Force was moved to Aghya in early May 1941.|$|E
5|$|The {{lessons learned}} during the South African War of 1899-1902 had {{reinforced}} {{the idea that}} the regular Army was not capable of fighting a prolonged full-scale war without significant assistance; almost all regular units in the United Kingdom had been deployed overseas within four months of the outbreak of hostilities, and the entire pool of reserve manpower had been exhausted in under a year. There had been no thought before the war to using auxiliary forces overseas; in the event, volunteers had been used on an <b>ad-hoc</b> basis, and a new auxiliary arm (the Imperial Yeomanry) was formed to provide specialist troops, but it was clear that a more effective system was required in future. A number of attempts at reform under the Conservative government of 1901-1905 had failed to make any lasting changes to the system, and left the auxiliary forces disorganised and demoralised.|$|E
5|$|The {{system has}} {{two types of}} receivers: radio terminals, which can either be {{hand-held}} or mounted in vehicles, and desktop equipment for control centers. The system will include 40,000 radios throughout the country. Compared to the analog network, the digital radio equipment will be smaller and have options for additional equipment such as hands free, and allow special radios for motorcycles, snowmobiles, boats, undercover activities and smoke diving. Communication can either be performed as one-to-one conversations, group calls for predefined or <b>ad-hoc</b> groups, with radios able {{to be part of}} several groups, or as walkie talkies in areas without network coverage. The digital transmission reduced background noise and allows monitoring terminal identity to prohibit unauthorized use. All radios are equipped with an emergency button that will give priority in the network.|$|E
25|$|Some particle-based {{simulation}} packages use an <b>ad-hoc</b> formalism for {{specification of}} reactants, parameters and rules. Others can read files in a recognised rule-based specification format such as BNGL.|$|E
25|$|Resistance coalesces around juntas, {{emergency}} <b>ad-hoc</b> governments. A Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom, {{ruling in}} the name of Ferdinand VII, is created on 25 September to coordinate efforts among the various juntas.|$|E
25|$|Community {{volunteering}} refers globally {{to those}} who work to improve their local community. This activity commonly occurs through not for profit organizations, local governments and churches; but also encompasses <b>ad-hoc</b> or informal groups such as recreational sports teams.|$|E
25|$|An <b>ad-hoc</b> {{committee}} was then charged with managing the heritage and executing the necessary measures {{to adapt the}} space to a public purpose. This process was crowned when Casa de Serralves {{opened to the public}} on 29 May 1987.|$|E
25|$|Temporary {{commissions}} {{were created}} to investigate <b>ad-hoc</b> questions. During the term of the Sixth Seimas these questions included the activities of commercial banks, {{the activities of the}} House of Signatories, and the decisions of the previous government of Gediminas Vagnorius.|$|E
25|$|It {{is still}} {{possible}} to take a walking tour through the tunnel to Wapping from Rotherhithe and back, but these are infrequent and on an <b>ad-hoc</b> basis as they can only take place when that section of the line is closed for maintenance.|$|E
25|$|KLIF's {{continuous}} coverage {{would eventually}} be aired over an <b>ad-hoc</b> radio network of its own, as the station's coverage was fed to KLIF's sister stations in Houston, Louisville, and other cities and reportedly aired (with or without permission) on dozens, possibly hundreds, of others.|$|E
25|$|An <b>ad-hoc</b> United Nations {{commission}} {{for human rights}} in Cabinda reported in 2003 that many atrocities had been perpetrated by the MPLA. In 2004, according to Peter Takirambudde, {{executive director of the}} Human Rights Watch mission for Africa, the Angolan army continued to commit crimes against civilians in Cabinda.|$|E
25|$|As the Ottomans {{advanced}} towards Vienna, the city's population organised an <b>ad-hoc</b> resistance {{formed from}} local farmers, peasants and civilians determined to repel the inevitable attack. The defenders {{were supported by}} a variety of European mercenaries, namely German Landsknecht pikemen and Spanish musketeers sent by Charles V.|$|E
25|$|Even {{without a}} {{complete}} secondary school education, anyone 23 or above {{can apply to}} state-run higher learning institution through the Exame Extraordinário de Avaliação de Capacidade para Acesso ao Ensino Superior (extraordinary exam to assess the capacity to enter higher-level studies), also called the <b>Ad-Hoc</b> exam.|$|E
25|$|As Premier Li Keqiang's {{principal}} lieutenant, Zhang's portfolio {{spans the}} fields of finance, economic development, natural resources, the environment, and housing. He is the chair of <b>ad-hoc</b> steering committees overseeing the Three Gorges Dam, the South–North Water Transfer Project, One Belt One Road, and the Commission on Food Safety of the State Council.|$|E
25|$|Some {{of those}} {{trademark}} activities still exist through today: senior citizens socialise and play Chinese chess, young people at school play football and basketball, <b>ad-hoc</b> street basketball games that attract flocks of spectators and players. Occasionally, the entire playground {{is used for}} carnival fairs, three-player drill basketball contests and hip hop dance competitions.|$|E
