5|$|In 1917, the {{railroad}} was {{brought before the}} New Jersey Board of Public Utility Commissioners due to an accident on November 28, 1916, at Kingsland station. Passenger train No. 582, a special train for employees of the Canadian Car Company, had near stopped at Kingsland station. The train never left at any defined time, although averaged around 6:30 in the evening. However, around 6:30that evening, Train No. 479 came in twelve minutes late at {{a high rate of}} speed, and as a result could not slow down fast enough to avoid hitting passengers. At that time, the station had no inter-track fencing to prevent crossing of both Boonton Branch tracks, and because of this, people could board trains from either platform. That day the engineer of Train No. 479 was unable to see the platform or the special train, and {{due to the lack of}} signals, had no information until the train knowing <b>anything</b> <b>until</b> the train left the west portal of Kingsland Tunnel. However, signals were set for west-bound trains if problems were to occur. After the accident, the Board requested the Lackawanna to install a westbound signal to prevent further accidents, while the Canadian Car Company moved its boarding to the company's rail siding.|$|E

25|$|Result: Platinum {{got out to}} {{an early}} start, getting some {{relatively}} good discounts on their first few items, but things were marred by infighting among the sub-team of David, Amy and Lucy. The team also struggled to find {{some of the more}} expensive items on the list, and were late back to the Coliseum. None of the Odyssey members started buying <b>anything</b> <b>until</b> three hours in, with the sub-team of Patrick, Maria and Navdeep spending a further three hours doing research. Their research did pay off however, as they got some significant discounts on the items that they did buy. Ultimately the teams both bought only five of the ten items each. However, Platinum were cost dearly by being late and not buying a second-hand car, the most expensive item on the list and correspondingly the one with the biggest fine. Platinum's total spend was £2,204, and Odyssey's total spend was £2,033.|$|E
500|$|On {{both the}} life and {{casualty}} sides, the classical function of actuaries is to calculate premiums and reserves for insurance policies covering various risks [...] On the casualty side, this analysis often involves quantifying {{the probability of a}} loss event, called the frequency, and the size of that loss event, called the severity. The amount of time that occurs before the loss event is important, as the insurer will not have to pay <b>anything</b> <b>until</b> after the event has occurred. On the life side, the analysis often involves quantifying how much a potential sum of money or a financial liability will be worth at different points in the future. Since neither of these kinds of analysis are purely deterministic processes, stochastic models are often used to determine frequency and severity distributions and the parameters of these distributions. Forecasting interest yields and currency movements also plays a role in determining future costs, especially on the life side [...]|$|E
500|$|Kateřina's health {{gradually}} worsened and in {{the spring}} of 1859 failed completely. Homeward bound, she died at Dresden on 19April 1859. Smetana wrote that she had died [...] "gently, without our knowing <b>anything</b> <b>until</b> the quiet drew my attention to her." [...] After placing Žofie with Kateřina's mother, Smetana spent time with Liszt in Weimar, where he was introduced to the music of the comic opera Der Barbier von Bagdad, by Liszt's pupil Peter Cornelius. This work would influence Smetana's own later career as an opera composer. Later that year he stayed with his younger brother Karel, {{and fell in love with}} Karel's sister-in-law Barbora (Bettina) Ferdinandiová, sixteen years his junior. He proposed marriage, and having secured her promise returned to Gothenburg for the 1859–60 winter. The marriage took place the following year, on 10July 1860, after which Smetana and his new wife returned to Sweden for a final season. This culminated in April 1861 with a piano performance in Stockholm, attended by the Swedish royal family. The couple's first daughter, Zdeňka, was born in September 1861.|$|E

500|$|Prior {{to writing}} [...] "Smells Like Nirvana", Yankovic's music career had {{suffered}} from the poor financial performance of his 1989 feature film, UHF and the associated soundtrack. Yankovic called that [...] "the beginning of three years where {{it was kind of}} hard for me to recover". He started work on a new studio album around 1990. To revitalize his career, he considered creating a parody of a Michael Jackson song, which had proven successful twice before with [...] "Eat It" [...] and [...] "Fat". He had composed a parody of Jackson's [...] "Black or White", titled [...] "Snack All Night", but Jackson said he was uncomfortable with the parody, given that the original song was intended to be a political statement. Yankovic would later believe that Jackson's refusal was, in retrospect, a blessing; he felt that [...] "Snack All Night" [...] was not one of his better works. While he had compiled other original songs for a new album he feared the lack of a good parody song would doom the album to failure and held off from releasing <b>anything</b> <b>until</b> an idea presented itself.|$|E
500|$|Production for {{the film}} began in February 2006, with a budget of $20–25 million. Principal {{photography}} {{for the film}} was shot in Auckland, New Zealand within sixty days. Film editing took ten weeks, while post-production, music mixing, and visual effects took a few months. The film was finished by November 2006, because the crew [...] "had to rush" [...] to meet the February 16 deadline. The film was directed by Nickelodeon's Rugrats co-creator and former Hanna-Barbera animator Gábor Csupó, who was first recommended for the job by Walden Media President Cary Granat. Although Csupó had never worked on a live-action film before, it [...] "didn't worry Granat in the least". Csupó stated that {{he was interested in}} making the film because he [...] "had the ambition to do a live-action film for a long time", but that he [...] "didn't like <b>anything</b> <b>until</b> I read this book". He described the book as [...] "beautiful" [...] and said that it [...] "moved [...] ". Bridge to Terabithia was cinematographer Michael Chapman's final film before his retirement. Chapman mentioned in the film's DVD commentary that he retired after shooting this film because he wanted his last film to be a good one; [...] "this is such a beautiful story, and it's exactly the kind of movie I want to do at this time in my life".|$|E
500|$|On 20 June, Eckoldt sailed for Bergen, Norway, with Galster and Schonemann {{where they}} waited until 4 July for the latter's main feed pump to be {{repaired}} and for Beitzen and Lody to arrive. All five destroyers arrived at Kirkenes on 10 July. They mounted their first anti-shipping patrol on 12 July, {{but did not}} spot <b>anything</b> <b>until</b> the following night. A small Soviet convoy was spotted and two of its ships were sunk after expending four-fifths of their ammunition. As the German ships were returning to port, they were attacked by several aircraft, of which Eckoldt claimed to have shot down one. A second patrol was made on 22 July, but only a single Soviet ship was sunk while the German ships were not damaged by several aerial attacks. When the British aircraft carriers [...] and [...] attacked Petsamo and Kirkenes on 29 July, the destroyers were far {{to the east and}} could not catch the British ships before they left the area. The German destroyers made one final sortie into the Kola Inlet where they sank one small Soviet patrol vessel. Eckoldt was damaged by a single aircraft's bombs that straddled the ship and damaged her steering and starboard engine. This damage was temporarily repaired, but Eckoldt was ordered to Narvik for more thorough repairs. After they were completed, the ship remained in the Arctic for convoy escort duties. She was accidentally rammed by a Norwegian freighter in Tromsø on 12 October and was given temporary repairs in the floating dock at Trondheim on 22 October before she was sent to Kiel for more permanent repairs where she arrived on 9 November.|$|E

Hitchens does argue that the [...] "multiple authors—none of whom published <b>anything</b> <b>until</b> many decades after the Crucifixion—cannot agree on anything of importance", [...] "the gospels are most certainly not literal truth", and there is [...] "little or no evidence for the life of Jesus".

2500|$|The duo {{reportedly}} {{first met}} in 1992, when de Luca DJed on a techno party organised by Fakesch. Their diverse musical backgrounds (hip hop and Heavy Metal) notwithstanding, they initially produced straight minimalist techno {{under the name}} Musik Aus Strom (German for music made of electricity) and signed for a six-album deal to Unit Moebius' label Bunker Records/Acid Planet in 1994. Acid Planet was unable to release <b>anything</b> <b>until</b> 1996 due to monetary constraints, however, and de Luca and Fakesch adopted the name Funkstörung and used the moniker Musik Aus Strom for their own label, on which they released a few EPs with a new, more melodic and rhythmically complex IDM/Glitch sound.

It was also revealed that an additional song, [...] "Start Without You" [...] leaked on 8 June 2010, a day before she would confirm that the song was, in fact, the first single from the upcoming re-release of Overcome on her official blog. Burke said that the leak had come from within the label and that the suspects were [...] "two little boys in Germany, on work experience."

2500|$|Skeptic Michael Shermer {{claims that}} the {{emergence}} of the [...] "Paul is dead" [...] phenomenon, including the alleged message at the end of [...] "I'm So Tired", was caused by faulty perception of a pattern. Shermer argues that the human brain evolved with a strong pattern recognition ability that was necessary to process the large amount of noise in man's environment, but that today this ability leads to false positives. Stanford University psychology professor Brian Wandell postulates that the observance of backward messages is a mistake arising from this pattern recognition facility, and argues that subliminal persuasion theories are [...] "bizarre" [...] and [...] "implausible."

As the sun rose and Lot entered Zoar, God rained sulfurous fire from heaven on Sodom and Gomorrah and annihilated the entire plain. Lot's wife looked back, and she turned into a pillar of salt. Next morning, Abraham hurried to the place where he had stood before God and looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and saw the smoke rising like at a kiln. Lot was afraid to dwell in Zoar, so he settled in a cave in the hill country with his two {{daughter}}s. The older daughter told the younger that their father was old, and there was not a man on earth with whom to have children, so she proposed that they get Lot drunk and have sex with him so that they might maintain life through their father. That night they made their father drink wine, and the older one lay with her father without his being aware. And the next day the older one persuaded the younger to do the same. The two daughters thus had children by their father, the older one bore a son named Moab who became the father of the Moabites, and the younger bore a son named Ben-ammi who became the father of the Ammonites.
