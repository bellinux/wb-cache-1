40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project is to better understand speciation [...] {{the process by which}} new species arise. To better understand how species form we will investigate how reproductive barriers come about-specifically the sterility of hybrid offspring will be the focus of this research. The species under investigation are Drosophila mauritiana and D. simulans that produce sterile hybrid males. These species are used specifically because they produce fertile hybrid females which allow genes to be moved between them. There are also published genome sequences for both species, which makes it is easier to identify candidate genes. These species are also easy to store, manage and cross to make hybrids. A genetic approach will be used in order to locate the genes responsible for male sterility. Specifically, we seek to identify genes from D. mauritiana, that cause male sterility when they <b>are</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> <b>D.</b> simulans. This sterility results from hybrid problems in male reproductive tissues, specifically an inability to produce sperm. This research will focus on a specific region of the X-chromosome called 2 P 3, where two P-elements mark the D. mauritiana DNA that causes sterility...|$|E

60|$|By this oblique motion, {{the island}} is {{conveyed}} to {{different parts of the}} monarch’s dominions. To explain the manner of its progress, let A B represent a line drawn across the dominions of Balnibarbi, let the line c d represent the loadstone, of which let d be the repelling end, and c the attracting end, the island being over C: let the stone <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> position c <b>d,</b> with its repelling end downwards; then the island will be driven upwards obliquely towards D. When it is arrived at D, let the stone be turned upon its axle, till its attracting end points towards E, and then the island will be carried obliquely towards E; where, if the stone be again turned upon its axle till it stands in the position E F, with its repelling point downwards, the island will rise obliquely towards F, where, by directing the attracting end towards G, the island may be carried to G, and from G to H, by turning the stone, so as to make its repelling extremity to point directly downward. And thus, by changing the situation of the stone, as often as there is occasion, {{the island is}} made to rise and fall by turns in an oblique direction, and by those alternate risings and fallings (the obliquity being not considerable) is conveyed from one part of the dominions to the other.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Reactive gliosis has the {{potential}} to alter biomechanical properties of the brain, impede neuronal regeneration and affect plasticity. Determining the onset and progression of reactive astrogliosis and microgliosis due to hydrocephalus is important for designing better clinical treatments. Methods Reactive astrogliosis and microgliosis were evaluated as the severity of hydrocephalus increased with age in hydrocephalic H-Tx rats and control littermates. Previous studies have suggested that gliosis may persist after short-term drainage (shunt treatment) of the cerebrospinal fluid. Therefore shunts <b>were</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> 15 <b>d</b> hydrocephalic rats that were sacrificed after 6 d (21 d of age) or after 21 d (36 d of age). Tissue was processed for Western blot procedures and immunohistochemistry, and probed for the astrocytic protein, Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein (GFAP) and for microglial protein, Isolectin B 4 (ILB 4). Results In the parietal cortex of untreated hydrocephalic animals, GFAP levels increased significantly at 5 d and at 12 d compared to age-matched control rats. There was a continued increase in GFAP levels over control at 21 d and at 36 d. Shunting prevented some of the increase in GFAP levels in the parietal cortex. In the occipital cortex of untreated hydrocephalic animals, there was a significant increase over control in levels of GFAP at 5 d. This trend continued <b>in</b> the 12 <b>d</b> animals, although not significantly. Significant increases in GFAP levels were present <b>in</b> 21 <b>d</b> and <b>in</b> 36 <b>d</b> animals. Shunting significantly reduced GFAP levels <b>in</b> the 36 <b>d</b> shunted group. Quantitative grading of immuno-stained sections showed similar changes in GFAP stained astrocytes. Immuno-stained microglia were altered in shape in hydrocephalic animals. At 5 d and 12 d, they appeared to be developmentally delayed with a lack of processes. Older 21 d and 36 d hydrocephalic animals exhibited the characteristics of activated microglia, with thicker processes and enlarged cell bodies. Following shunting, fewer activated microglia were present. Histologic examination of the periventricular area and the periaqueductal area showed similar findings with the 21 d and 36 d animals having increased populations of both astrocytes and microglia which were reduced following shunting with a more dramatic reduction in the long term shunted animals. Conclusion Overall, these results suggest that reactive astrocytosis and microgliosis are associated with progressive untreated ventriculomegaly, but that shunt treatment can reduce the gliosis occurring with hydrocephalus. </p...|$|R
40|$|This {{case study}} focused on {{the voice of the}} child as he/she developmentally and cognitively {{constructed}} meaning from the beginning of written pieces to the end. It assumed the sense of the constructivist in that prior knowledge and meaning are created by the learner in response to encounters with ideas, people or things and are brought by the student to the learning situation. ^ Five fifth grade elementary students were targeted. They were chosen from end-of-year documentation over a period of five years, standardized achievement scores, and individual interviews. The research was conducted over a five-month period during the 1997 – 1998 school year. It drew on official school documents, collected student writings, interviews and observations of the students. Ethnographic methods were used to gather information. ^ The central question of the study was: What are the perceptions, thoughts, and reactions of the student as he/she engages in developing a written piece? Other relevant questions were: (a) How does a student react to a writing assignment? (b) What steps does the student take as he/she formulates a plan of action? (c) How does the student proceed once the plan <b>is</b> <b>in</b> <b>place?</b> (<b>d)</b> How does the student interact with the teacher before, during, and after the task is assigned? (e) What, if any, extraneous factors influence the student 2 ̆ 7 s attitudes towards written expression? (f) From where do students get their ideas to construct a written piece? ^ Some findings were: (1) Children build on both positive and negative experiences in their lives and use portions of these at various times in their written work. (2) Children require time to express their thoughts to other adults or peers because it helps them to put their framework of ideas into a writing perspective. (3) Children imitate, writing that is modeled for them. (4) Some children who do not have positive experiences in their life rely on imagination. (5) Continued development of the writer is achieved when writing is done on a regular basis. (6) Teachers 2 ̆ 7 attitudes affect the final product of the child. (7) Teachers require training on how to teach writing to students. ...|$|R
