5|$|Kirchherr {{asked the}} Beatles {{if they would}} mind letting her take {{photographs}} {{of them in a}} photo session, which impressed them, as other groups had only snapshots that were taken by friends. The next morning Kirchherr took photographs with a Rolleicord camera, at a fairground in a municipal park called Hamburger Dom which was close to the Reeperbahn, and in the afternoon she took them all (minus Best, who decided not to go) to her mother's house in Altona. Kirchherr's bedroom (which was <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>black,</b> including the furniture, with silver foil on the walls and a large tree branch suspended from the ceiling), was decorated especially for Voormann, with whom she had a relationship, although after the visits to the Kaiserkeller their relationship became purely platonic. Kirchherr started dating Sutcliffe, although she always remained a close friend of Voormann.|$|E
500|$|Lady Antebellum {{was tapped}} to perform [...] "Just a Kiss" [...] at the 2011 Billboard Music Awards, held in Las Vegas. The show aired on May 22, 2011, on ABC. Scott, Kelley and Haywood, dressed <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>black,</b> {{performed}} the song as Haywood played piano with their full band behind them. Scott Shetler of Taste of Country commended the performance, writing {{that the members}} were [...] "harmonized beautifully, particularly on the song's hook." [...] In June 2011, the group performed the song on the 2011 CMT Music Awards, where they were presented with the Award for Group Video of the Year (for [...] "Hello World"). The band, dressed in black, sang [...] "Just a Kiss" [...] and a few lines of the song [...] "Kiss" [...] by Prince. The trio also performed the song on CBS's Late Show with David Letterman. Robbie Daw of Idolator wrote that the performance was [...] "pitch-perfect". Lady Antebellum appeared as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live on October 1, 2011. They performed [...] "We Owned the Night", followed by [...] "Just a Kiss".|$|E
500|$|The gatefold's inner left panel, {{opposite}} the album's production credits, showed Harrison {{and his fellow}} musicians – Starr, Horn, Voormann, Hopkins, Keltner and Wright – at a long table, laden with food and wine. A deliberate parody of da Vinci's The Last Supper, the picture was taken in California at the mock-Tudor home of entertainment lawyer Abe Somers, by Hollywood glamour photographer Ken Marcus. As with the US coinage used on the back cover, various details in the photo represent what Harrison termed the [...] "gross" [...] aspects {{of life in the}} material world. Clayson has speculated about the symbolism and hidden messages within the photo: whether the nurse with a pram, set back from and {{to the left of the}} table, was a reference to Boyd's inability to conceive a child; and the empty, distant wheelchair in memory of Harrison's late mother. Theologian Dale Allison observes the anti-Catholic sentiment within this inner-gatefold photo, following on from Harrison's lyrics to his 1970 song [...] "Awaiting on You All". Harrison is dressed as a priest, <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>black,</b> sporting an Old West six-shooter – [...] "a slam at the perceived materialism and violence of the Roman church", Allison writes.|$|E

500|$|Lynch cast Naomi Watts and Laura Harring {{by their}} photographs. He called them in {{separately}} for half-hour interviews {{and told them}} that he had not seen any of their previous works in film or television. Harring considered it fateful that she was involved in a minor car accident {{on the way to the}} first interview, only to learn her character would also be involved in a car accident in the film. Watts arrived wearing jeans for the first interview, direct from the airplane from New York City. Lynch asked her to return the next day [...] "more glammed up". She was offered the part two weeks later. Lynch explained his selection of Watts, [...] "I saw someone that I felt had a tremendous talent, and I saw someone who had a beautiful soul, an intelligence—possibilities for a lot of different roles, so it was a beautiful full package." [...] Justin Theroux also met Lynch directly after his airplane flight. After a long flight with little sleep, Theroux arrived dressed <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>black,</b> with untidy hair. Lynch liked the look and decided to cast Adam wearing similar clothes and the same hairstyle.|$|E
500|$|Sonny Takhar, {{the chief}} {{executive}} officer of Syco Records, attributes the breakthrough to the power of social media. [...] "Sometimes you feel the song's the star, but it's not like that here– it's the act," [...] he said. [...] "It's a real moment. Social media has become the new radio, it's never broken an act globally like this before." [...] Will Bloomfield, the group's manager, added, [...] "These guys live online, and so do their fans." [...] Their management employs a social media team and the members all tweet themselves, [...] "which helps create the illusion that they couldn't be any closer to their fans," [...] according to Caspar Llewellyn Smith, writing for The Guardian. One Direction's Twitter account had amassed 10 million followers by February 2013, with the account gaining followers at an average of 21,000 per day. In an approach pioneered by The Beatles, each member is known for his feature; Horan is [...] "the cute one", Malik is [...] "the quiet and mysterious one", Payne is [...] "the sensible one", Styles is [...] "the charming one" [...] and Tomlinson is [...] "the funny one". Each member's individual identity is reinforced by their intentionally different personal styles. Caroline Watson, the band's original stylist, spoke about styling the band, [...] "At the beginning I didn't want them <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>black</b> or all in leather—that whole stereotypical boy band thing." [...] Instead, her original idea was for them to be the [...] "male equivalent to the Spice Girls", with each member being a part of the group but still having his own individual style. Horan commented on One Direction as a boy band, [...] "People think that a boy band is air-grabs and [...] dressed in all one colour. We're boys in a band. We're trying to do something different from what people would think is the typical kind of boy band. We're trying to do different kinds of music and we're just trying to be ourselves, not squeaky clean." [...] Leah Collins, writing for the National Post, remarked that One Direction had succeeded on the latter front, [...] "For the most part, that just means the group presents themselves as typical, goofy and uncensored teenage boys– posting jokey YouTube videos, for instance, or boozing at awards shows." [...] Writing for The Observer, Kitty Empire opined, [...] "One Direction fulfill a great many boy band prerequisites (looks, soppy lyrics, tune-grasp, fame-lust) but their lack of routines points to the subtle digressions afoot here".|$|E

2500|$|The {{middle of}} the 15th century in Burgundy saw what {{seems to have been}} the {{earliest}} occurrence of the male fashion for dressing <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>black,</b> which was to reappear so strongly in the [...] "Spanish" [...] style of the mid-16th–17th century and again in the 19th–20th centuries.

2500|$|These pictures, <b>all</b> <b>in</b> <b>black</b> and white, {{were done}} with {{available}} light or sometimes a lantern, yet they are [...] "amazingly crisp with surprising depth of field". Indeed, [...] "There is a grainy realism to Vishniac's photographic style. We can almost finger the coarse textures of coats and shawls; the layers of fabric worn by the people seem more related to tree bark than to the well-pressed wool suit worn by an occasional elegant passerby." [...] Vishniac {{is known to have}} exaggerated in composing the captions of his photographs, and in some cases he may have fabricated the stories behind them.|$|E
