On Sundays at Columbia Park, Ajax and the other women's teams played as many as 16 games on four fields from September to April. U.S. woman's soccer standouts, defender Joy Biefeld-Fawcett <b>and</b> <b>forward</b> Carin Jennings, were members of 'Ajax America Women' and {{regularly}} practiced and played at the Columbia Park's soccer fields. These two Columbia park players would go on in 1991 to help 'Ajax' win the U.S. women's amateur championship, and then help the U.S. national team win the first FIFA Women's World Cup in China that same year.

The hardware design engineer begins with a sequential implementation without any interlock <b>and</b> <b>forwarding</b> logic. A tool then adds the <b>forwarding</b> <b>and</b> interlock logic required for pipelining. This paper describes the algorithm for such a tool and the correctness is formally verified.
