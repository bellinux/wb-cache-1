5|$|Playschool or leikskóli, is non-compulsory {{education}} for those {{under the age}} of six, and {{is the first step in}} the education system. The current legislation concerning playschools was passed in 2007. The Ministry of Education, Science and Culture is responsible for the policies and methods that playschools must use, and they issue the National Curriculum Guidelines. They are also responsible for ensuring that the curriculum is suitable so as to make the transition into compulsory education <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> <b>as</b> possible. However, the Ministry does not implement the regulations and guidelines; instead this is the responsibility of the local authority, who fund and administer playschools. In addition, the local authority employs representatives who supervise the playschools’ operation.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1643 the {{commander}} of the local Parliamentary forces in Cheshire, Colonel Robert Duckenfield, was ordered to seize Wythenshawe Hall and to remove anything of value that could be found. Forewarned, Robert Tatton recruited a group of more than 50 defenders from among his staff and Royalist friends. After ransacking the nearby village of Northenden the Roundheads arrived at Wythenshawe Hall on 21 November 1643, but they did not find the task of taking it <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> <b>as</b> they had imagined. At one point during the siege the attackers almost took possession of the house in a struggle during which six of the defenders were killed. The Parliamentarians refused a truce to allow the bodies to be taken to the local church for proper services to be held, necessitating their burial in the garden behind the house. One of those killed was the fiancé of Mary Webb, a young woman who had been brought up by the Tattons and had remained in the house with the defenders. Towards the end of the siege Mary saw the man who had led the attack, Duckinfield's second-in-command Captain Adams, sitting on a wall near the house. Borrowing a musket from one of the defenders, she shot him dead.|$|E

25|$|India's innings was <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> <b>as</b> it {{had been}} a week ago. From the first 12 overs, Sehwag and Gambhir added 75 runs, before Sehwag edged Streak behind for a run-a-ball 44. Gambhir continued, though, and India lost no further wickets until the close of play, leaving them on 195 for 1 with Gambhir five runs short of his second Test century. Rahul Dravid was more subdued, only making 49 from 103 balls, and he was {{occasionally}} troubled by Streak – but not enough to surrender his wicket.|$|E

25|$|On 22–23 August 1914, {{the first}} major {{engagement}} of the British Expeditionary Force in the First World War occurred at the Battle of Mons. Advancing German forces were thrown back by heavily outnumbered British troops, who suffered heavy casualties and, being outflanked, were forced into rapid retreat the next day. The retreat and the battle were rapidly perceived by the British public as being a key moment in the war. Despite the censorship going on in Britain at the time, this battle was the first indication the British public had that defeating Germany would not be <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> <b>as</b> some had thought.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} achieve this effect, a seam bowler usually {{delivers}} the ball with the seam held upright, with rotation about a horizontal axis. This keeps the seam aligned vertically as it travels towards the batsman, making it likely that the ball will bounce with the seam on the pitch. Of course, consistently hitting the seam is not <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> <b>as</b> it sounds. The seam has to be held upright between the index finger and the middle finger {{at the time of}} the delivery of the ball and, most importantly, the wrist has to be dead straight when the ball is delivered. The seam and wrist position of Australia's Glenn McGrath are arguably a perfect example.|$|E
25|$|Like {{other forms}} of tourism, medical tourism in Lebanon {{is on the rise}} recently. Although {{visitors}} from neighboring Arab nations make up the bulk of medical tourism patients here due to its proximity, Beirut is strongly trying to woo more southern Europeans, Asians and North Americans to its land. Its Agency for Investment Development in Lebanon reports that growth in the medical tourism industry is growing by up to 30% a year since 2009. The country's tourism ministry is working closely with the medical sector and top-class hotels to create an organized, quality medical destination. Major hotel and spa chains work with local clinics, travel agencies and the tourism ministry to create comprehensive healthcare and recuperation packages for foreign visitors. The government is highly involved in this industry and strives to make the process <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> <b>as</b> possible.|$|E

There, Atangana and seven other Cameroon para-powerlifters worked with international trainers to recalibrate their form for competition as Cameroon lacked the technical knowledge to provide adequate coaching in country.

25|$|In {{order to}} prepare for his {{entrance}} into Edinburgh University where he was to study modern languages, Marjoribanks spent 1927–28 in Paris and at the Convitto Maschile Valdese in Torre Pellice, Italy where he became fluent in Italian. This was to prove useful to him later. He graduated from Edinburgh University with a first class honours Master of Arts (Scotland) in 1932 and then studied German further in Bonn and Tübingen, Germany. He stayed for four months with a German newspaper proprietor’s family which coincided with the accession to power of Adolf Hitler in January 1933. Marjoribanks noted that the general attitude was “We’ve tried everything else, so {{we might as well}} try Adolf. If he’s no good we’ll get rid of him.” But, he also noted, it wasn’t <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> <b>as</b> that. After the war, Marjoribanks discovered that a bomb had destroyed {{both the house and the}} parents. Two of the three sons had died on the Eastern Front.|$|E

Newell stated that getting Steam and games to work on Linux is a key strategy for Valve; Newell called the closed nature of Microsoft Windows 8, [...] "a catastrophe {{for everyone in the}} PC space", and that Linux would maintain [...] "the openness of the platform". Valve is extending support to any developers that want to bring their games to Linux, by [...] "making it <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> <b>as</b> possible for anybody who's engaged with usputting their games on Steam and getting those running on Linux", according to Newell.|$|E

500|$|Editor Louise Innes, who {{was working}} on her first X-Files episode, said the {{post-production}} editing process was [...] "not <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> <b>as</b> it sounds." [...] Innes was tasked with connecting roughly forty shots and creating the illusion of one, uniform scene. After the reels of film were combined, several pending issues had to be tweaked in post-production. For instance, during the scene in which Scully runs into an elevator, two shots were spliced together; however, the color did not completely match. The images and their colors were later corrected by the series' [...] "postproduction [...] troubleshooters" [...] using digital manipulation. When the episode was filmed, it was shot in 2.35:1 widescreen. When the episode aired, it was shown letterboxed to fit in a 1.33:1 television screen; {{this was the first}} X-Files episode to receive this treatment. Carter reasoned that this method would allow for more action to be viewable in each frame.|$|E
500|$|However, {{she soon}} {{came to realize}} that writing a book about Madonna would not be <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> <b>as</b> she had thought. There was already {{abundant}} material available about her life and career and Simone could not find anything else left to be said in her book. The author hoped of [...] "finding some tiny stone left unturned in the giant gravel pit of Madonna studies". She even had to return her book advance given by her publisher for failing to write the biography. Unable to produce a biography, Simone instead decided to pursue a different direction with the material. The author, who had already released the novel called Note to Self (2009) and is also a musician, wanted to focus on her own singing career, self-declared as a [...] "failure". She confessed having a personal affinity for [...] "underdog" [...] musicians, an understanding which was totally opposite to what Madonna stood for with her success.|$|E
500|$|An {{official}} synopsis {{published in}} the Billboard states, [...] "Bertie Fawcett is a dudish chap, who believes that he has won the heart of May Vernon. May, however, regards Bertie as very much of a joke, and {{is in love with}} Jack Mace, who is her ideal of manly beauty. May's father has no objection to Jack personally, but he does not propose that the daughter he idolizes shall wed a weakling or a ne'er do well. Therefore, he tells May in a letter that if 'that young man wants to marry you, he must show his ability by earning his own living during vacation.' Unfortunately for Bertie, he sees the letter, and egotistically jumps to the conclusion that he is the person referred to. He starts out to make his own living, but soon finds that it is not <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> <b>as</b> it sounds. He is successfully a writer, a billposter, a village constable, and a living target in the baseball show, but fails to shine in any one sphere. And then to cap the climax, when he returns to claim his bride, he finds that May is married to Jack." ...|$|E

[...] Desjardin noted that the intent in shooting the film was to utilize handheld devices to make the film feel like a [...] "documentary-style" [...] film. [...] "We had to think about what that would mean, since we also had to photograph some crazy action," [...] said Desjardin. [...] "So {{for a lot of the}} previs we did, we’d start to think where our cameras were and where our cameraman was.

500|$|In 1853, Congress {{authorized}} a three-dollar piece. In a note {{found among}} his papers, Longacre wrote that his {{task was to}} make the coin <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> <b>as</b> possible to distinguish from the quarter eagle, which at $2.50 was close in value. Longacre produced a design for a Native American princess, which he made different from Gobrecht's Liberty design on the quarter eagle with a thinner and wider planchet. [...] At the time, a female Native American was often used to represent America in art, and a depiction of Liberty as an Indian princess was in accord with contemporary practices. The chief engraver wrote to Mint Director Snowden that the three-dollar piece, which went into production in 1854, {{was the first time he}} had been allowed artistic freedom in designing a coin. [...] The gold dollar was altered the same year to make the planchet both thinner and wider; Longacre modified his princess design for the gold dollar. [...] For the reverse of the coins, Longacre created a wreath of wheat, corn, tobacco, and cotton, blending the agricultural products of the North and the South. [...] This wreath would also be used on the reverse of the Flying Eagle cent in 1856; reused on the dime beginning in 1860, the [...] "cereal wreath" [...] would be Longacre's last surviving design on coinage, remaining with modifications until the 1916 abandonment of the Barber dime.|$|E
500|$|... "Back Up, Dancer" [...] {{was written}} by Tracy Poust and Jon Kinnally and {{directed}} by series producer James Burrows.

She recorded her lines {{in front of a}} live audience on August 17. Jackson's role in the show had been her first television acting role in nearly two decades. Jackson's last prime-time role was on NBC's Fame. She also appeared in the television shows Diff'rent Strokes and Good Times. In addition, Jackson's appearance came nine months after the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy. She told the entertainment news program Access Hollywood that she was a [...] "big fan" [...] of the show, and that she could not wait to join the cast for her stint. Also in this interview, she believed that Sean Hayes, who plays Jack, was a decent dancer. [...] "I thought he studied dance. I really did, It's so funny. I have to catch myself because I'm cracking up in rehearsals. It's just funny to watch [...]" [...] Jackson [...] "had a tough time" [...] on the set because she constantly messed up her lines. She admitted that it was not <b>as</b> <b>easy</b> <b>as</b> she had hoped it would be. [...] "I flubbed my lines and got so frustrated when I made those mistakes. I haven't done TV since Different Strokes, and it's not like Saturday Night Live where you can read cue cards. On Will & Grace, they're always rewriting, so you're always memorising." [...] Jackson, however, said that the dancing was the [...] "easy part of playing myself".|$|E
