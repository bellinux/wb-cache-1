5|$|Chrono Cross Music Selection is a mini-album of Chrono Cross {{music that}} was {{released}} in North America exclusively as <b>a</b> <b>bonus</b> <b>for</b> pre-ordering Chrono Cross. The five-track disc was composed by Yasunori Mitsuda, has a length of 15:47 and was published by Square along with the game on August 15, 2000.

5|$|The Army and Navy Union awarded {{publisher}} William Randolph Hearst the Gold Medal of Honor for {{distinguished service}} in June 1945. The Kings County {{division of the}} Union was awarded a plaque for outstanding service to convalescent sailors by the Brooklyn Naval Hospital on May 24, 1946. The Brooklyn Navy Yard garrison sponsored a reception at their headquarters on May 25, 1946, for Lieutenant Charles W. Shea, the recipient of Medal of Honor, and Colonel Richard E. Cole who {{had just returned from}} overseas duty. The Union through their Cincinnati, Ohio, division adopted a resolution on August 13, 1948, asking the government to provide <b>a</b> <b>bonus</b> <b>for</b> World War II veterans.|$|E

Ernst had opposed <b>a</b> <b>bonus</b> <b>for</b> veterans of World War I, an unpopular position in Kentucky, and at 68 years old, his age worked against him. Barkley contrasted his impoverished upbringing with Ernst's affluent lifestyle as a corporate lawyer, and also attacked him for supporting Michigan Senator Truman Handy Newberry, who resigned due to allegations of election fraud. Republican voters were angered that Ernst did not support Republican Kentucky Congressman John W. Langley when Langley was charged with illegally aiding a large bootlegging operation in Louisville. Ernst tried to resurrect the issues of Barkley's support for the coal tax and opposition to parimutuel betting, but in the general election, Barkley won {{by a vote of}} 287,997 to 266,657.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{financial}} success of Dr. No, United Artists greenlit a second James Bond film. The studio doubled the budget offered to Eon Productions with $2 million, and also approved <b>a</b> <b>bonus</b> <b>for</b> Sean Connery, who would receive $100,000 {{along with his}} $54,000 salary. As President John F. Kennedy had named Fleming's novel From Russia with Love among his ten favourite books of all time in Life magazine, producers Broccoli and Saltzman chose this as the follow-up to Bond's cinematic debut in Dr. No. From Russia with Love was the last film President Kennedy saw at the White House on 20 November 1963 before going to Dallas. Most of the crew from the first film returned, with major exceptions being production designer Ken Adam, who {{went to work on}} Dr. Strangelove and was replaced by Dr. Nos art director Syd Cain; title designer Maurice Binder was replaced by Robert Brownjohn, and stunt coordinator Bob Simmons was unavailable and was replaced by Peter Perkins though Simmons performed stunts in the film. John Barry replaced Monty Norman as composer of the soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|The soldier's sole {{substantial}} {{disposable income}} {{came from the}} donativa, or cash bonuses handed out periodically by the emperors, as these were paid in gold solidi (which were never debased), or in pure silver. There was a regular donative of 5 solidi every five years of an Augustus reign (i.e. one solidus p.a.) Also, on the accession of a new Augustus, 5 solidi plus a pound of silver (worth 4 solidi, totaling 9 solidi) were paid. The 12 Augusti that ruled the West between 284 and 395 averaged about nine years per reign. Thus the accession donatives would have averaged about 1 solidus p.a. The late soldier's disposable income would thus have averaged at least 2 solidi per annum. It is also possible, but undocumented, that the accession bonus was paid for each Augustus and/or <b>a</b> <b>bonus</b> <b>for</b> each Caesar. The documented income of 2 solidi was {{only a quarter of}} the disposable income of a 2nd-century legionary (which was the equivalent of c. 8 solidi). The late soldier's discharge package (which included a small plot of land) was also minuscule compared with a 2nd-century legionary's, worth just a tenth of the latter's.|$|E

Its North American release was celebrated by Nintendo in New York City. As <b>a</b> <b>bonus</b> <b>for</b> those who pre-ordered Pokémon Platinum, Nintendo gave away Giratina figurines in the United States. Expanded space {{was given to}} Pokémon merchandise in Toys 'R' Us for Pokémon Platinum, which included a Pokémon Trading Card Game card set based on the Platinum name. They also arranged for several events to obtain rare Pokémon.|$|E
25|$|On April 1, 2016, it was {{announced}} that Lisch had turned down a contract extension with the Illawarra Hawks, and that a rival NBL team was his next destination. A day later, the Sydney Kings announced Lisch as their first major signing for the 2016–17 season, with Lisch having inked a three-year deal. It marked the second significant signing for the Kings, with Australian basketball icon, Andrew Gaze, having joined the team as its new head coach. The signing of Lisch, along with the appointment of Gaze as head coach, set the Kings up to lure more quality free agents to a club that had seen its struggles since returning to the league in 2010, capped off by a 6–22 record in 2015–16. <b>A</b> <b>bonus</b> <b>for</b> the Kings was that Lisch became an Australian citizen in March 2016, meaning the team could use its three import slots without Lisch filling one of them. In {{the weeks leading up to}} the start of the 2016–17 season, Lisch was appointed team captain.|$|E
25|$|Although tea {{had been}} {{exported}} since 1904, the real {{growth of the}} tea industry in Cholo and Mlanje districts occurred after 1922 and was promoted by the collapse the Flue-cured tobacco market. The estate companies including Blantyre and East Africa Ltd owned land {{that they needed to}} put into productive use, and chose tea planting. Even by the very poor standards of southern Africa, Nyasaland's tea wages in the 1920s and 1930s were low. The tea growers argued that the quality of the tea produced and the productivity of the workers were both also low. On the three Blantyre and East Africa estates in Mlanje (Lauderdale, Glenorchy and Limbuli), workers were paid a basic wage of 6 shillings, or 30 pence in 1941 and <b>a</b> <b>bonus</b> <b>for</b> large amounts picked. These very low wages caused incidents on the Limbuli Estate in 1942, where the manager was censured for his behaviour towards tenants. Very few women worked at picking tea until the early 1970s but in 1973 at Glenorchy women picked approximately 2/5 of the crop. There were major slumps the world tea industry in 1919-20 and 1928-32 as more efficient planting and expansion in the areas planted created a “tea mountain”. In 1933 an International Tea Agreement scheme introduced export quotas and virtually prohibited new areas of tea planting and the selling or leasing of further land for tea growing. The Blantyre and East Africa estates were allowed to grow 2,964 acres of tea in 1939 and 3,810 acres in 1945, about 17% of total area if tea planted in Cholo and Mlanje districts in 1935, reducing to 13% in 1945.

500|$|The {{highlight}} of Chappell's career was Australia's 4–1 win over England in 1974–75 that reclaimed The Ashes.

Chappell scored 90 on an [...] "unreliable" [...] pitch {{on the first day of}} the opening Test at Brisbane. He finished the six Tests with 387 runs at 35.18 average, and took 11 catches in the slips. The Test matches attracted big crowds and record gate takings, enabling Chappell to negotiate <b>a</b> <b>bonus</b> <b>for</b> the players from the Australian Cricket Board (ACB).

Afflicted by disease, and the music industry, he was considering retirement. Albright visited him and convinced him to continue. Albright talked to him about making Neil Reshen his new manager. Meanwhile, Jennings requested a US$25,000 royalty advance from RCA Records to cover his living expenses during his recovery.

500|$|The Marinesektion (Naval Section of the War Ministry) {{requested}} tenders from Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino (STT) and the British shipyard Armstrong, {{which had}} built the Panther. class.

STT's design was slightly smaller than Panther, but was otherwise similar to Armstrong's ship; both firms guaranteed a speed of [...] normally and [...] at forced draft. The navy determined that Armstrong's design would have reduced maneuverability compared to Panther, and the hull was too lightly built, so the STT proposal was chosen on 16 March 1886.
