500|$|Echo & the Bunnymen left London Records {{in early}} 2000. McCulloch said, [...] "What they said is, 'We'll {{keep you on}} if you don't take {{as much money as}} in the contract,' <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> {{intention}} of staying anyway, so it was kind of 'were we pushed or did we fall?'" [...] There was also a change in the band's management with Toogood departing to start his own record label. With the session musicians who recorded What Are You Going to Do with Your Life? moving on, McCulloch and Sergeant recruited a new band, with whom they would go on to record the 2000 EP, Avalanche, which was only available to buy over the internet.|$|E
500|$|Despite some {{moderate}} critical praise {{including a}} glowing review from AllMusic, {{who called the}} album's [...] "impressively surprising" [...] array of sounds [...] "refreshing coming from a band who {{was assumed to be}} generic retro swing", Soul Caddy failed to achieve the chart success or commercial attention of its predecessor. The Daddies' accompanying national tour fared just as poorly, showing a marked decline in attendance and negative audience reactions towards the band's decreased focus on playing swing music. Speaking retrospectively in a 2002 interview, Perry recalled [...] "we went out on tour and most people saw us as a swing band because of the success of Zoot Suit Riot...we felt this tension to be something we weren't". Facing low ticket sales and their own dissatisfaction over the tour's outcome, the Daddies brought their scheduled tour to an early close, eventually reaching a mutual decision upon taking an indefinite hiatus in December 2000. [...] "A lot of it was just fatigue", Perry explained, [...] "We'd be on the road for a long time <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> life outside of Cherry Poppin' Daddies. [...] I think everybody was interested in doing other things". The Daddies were released from Mojo shortly thereafter, though Jason Moss would later comment that the band were kicked [...] "to the curb" [...] after Soul Caddys poor commercial performance.|$|E
2500|$|Both Ron and Russell Mael {{are seen}} in the {{audience}} during the Ronettes' section of the concert film The Big T.N.T. Show, filmed in 1966. Both attended UCLA, Ron studying cinema and graphic art, Russell theatre arts and filmmaking. Detesting the folk music scene, which they considered [...] "cerebral and sedate <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> time for that", they developed a particular taste in English bands of the time such as the Who, Syd Barrett's Pink Floyd, the Kinks and the Move, which led to their description of themselves as [...] "Anglophiles".|$|E

2500|$|Although he {{had never}} umpired in {{first-class}} cricket, had just captained North Zone against the Indians a few days previously, {{and was one of}} the Test selectors, he was called upon to umpire the Fifth Test in the 1954-55 series, with the approval of the Indian team. He explained: [...] "The umpire got ill <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> reserve ... I was an official with the railways and had played cricket. But with no umpiring experience I was asked to stand in a Test." [...] He may have been being diplomatic: his obituary in Wisden gives the reason for the emergency as [...] "a row over the appointed officials", and adds that he [...] "showed his mettle" [...] when he gave Abdul Kardar, the Pakistani captain, out stumped for 93.|$|E
2500|$|The duo dropped [...] "The Music Man" [...] melody, {{and wrote}} a new chorus. They at first {{attempted}} to set Kehoe's lyrics {{to the tune of}} their 1982 hit single, [...] "Arthur Daley (e's Alright)", creating an alternative version initially entitled [...] "Captain Kirk (He's Alright)". Unsatisfied, they sought to create something original, locking themselves away for a week to write [...] "Star Trekkin'", based on an increasing tempo seen previously in Rolf Harris' [...] "The Court of King Caractacus". They sought to have it recorded professionally, but were received unfavourably by potential recording labels. Instead, they recorded it at O'Conner's and Brian O'Shaughnessy's Bark Studios in Walthamstow, East London. The arrangement was by Bill C. Martin, and the rest of The Firm was made up of Dev Douglas and Peter Sills. O'Shaughnessy later said [...] "One of the greatest highlights of my career was producing 'Star Trekkin. The record was produced to mock the series <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> idea {{it was going to be}} a big hit." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the {{decision}} to do an episode about Anne Frank, Murphy said, [...] "We have a great writing staff but I will take credit for that. One of the things we've done on the show is we take historical figures – {{last year was the}} Black Dahlia and this year is Anne Frank. The Black Dahlia particularly was a case that was never solved so we solved that case in our way. The Anne Frank thing was always interesting to me because after the war, much like the Anastasia case, there were many women who came forward after that diary and said, 'Well I'm the real Anne Frank,' and they were struck down. Many of them were found to be mentally ill and suffering from schizophrenia, so I read about those cases. Before we even wrote one word of it, I thought there was sort of only one actress I was interested in playing Anne Frank and that was Franka. So I brought her in and said, 'I'm gonna write this for you and would you do it.' <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> script because we were very early on in the season. She loved the story and I sorta swore her to secrecy and God bless her heart she had like five months without telling anybody. I love how it came together." ...|$|E

60|$|By {{this time}} it was night, but the young moon and the stars in a {{cloudless}} sky, lighted up the water-way clearly, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> fear that Macomber could give us the slip, unless he returned by land.|$|E

60|$|I had no {{alternative}} but to obey. Our rooms were on the fifth floor of a block of flats overlooking Chelsea Embankment, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> lift. We descended two flights of the stone stairs in silence. Then she suddenly laid her fingers upon my arm.|$|E
60|$|Nothing of this Kind {{could have}} happen'd more to our mutual Satisfaction, for tho' we {{had long ago}} given them over either for Lost, or Lost to us; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> great Need of Company, yet we were overjoy'd at meeting, and so were they too.|$|E
6000|$|... "But, indeed," [...] Beorn said, [...] "our {{garments}} differ not {{greatly from}} those {{we now have}} on, for Norman fashions are prevalent at King Edward's court, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> choice but to conform to them. Your language is always spoken there, and methinks that were you to visit Westminster you would see but little difference between King Edward's court and that of your own duke." ...|$|E

50|$|Willem, or Guillaume Mahue (1517 in Brussels - 1569 in Brussels), a Flemish painter, was a {{portrait}} painter of great repute in his time; but his pictures are rare, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> particulars of his life.|$|R
60|$|He had {{a hundred}} virtues, {{including}} the capital virtue of good humour, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> difficulty {{in changing the}} subject and forgetting the disagreement. He talked about society, his town friends and his country sports, and I discovered {{in the course of}} it that he was a county magistrate, a Member of Parliament, and a director of several important companies. He was also that other thing, which I did not tell him.|$|E
6000|$|... "By noon {{the next}} day the {{submerged}} Gatling was rescued, as Kearny had promised. Then Carlos and Manuel Ortiz and Kearny (my lieutenants) distributed Winchesters among the troops and put them through an incessant rifle drill. We fired no shots, blank or solid, for of all coasts Esperando is the stillest; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> desire to sound any warnings in the ear of that corrupt government until they should carry with them the message of Liberty and the downfall of Oppression.|$|E
60|$|That {{night it}} blew a gale, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> more {{visitors}} {{until the following}} morning. As the sun rose, however, we fell in with three schooners, under the Leaplow flag, all of which seemed bound on errands of life or death. The first that reached us sent a boat on board, and a committee of six bob-upon-bobs hurried up our sides, and lost no time in introducing themselves. I shall give their own account of their business and characters.|$|E
5000|$|With {{increased}} record sales, David Geraghty {{later said}} to Ed Power of the Irish Independent: [...] "The OC {{thing was a}} huge deal <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>no</b> regrets about doing it. It opened doors for us abroad".|$|R

6000|$|... "A présent c'est un fait accompli," [...] said he, re-adjusting his paletôt; <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>no</b> {{more words}} on the subject. After looking over the two volumes he had brought, and cutting away some pages with his {{penknife}} (he generally pruned before lending his books, especially if they were novels, and sometimes I was a little provoked at the severity of his censorship, the retrenchments interrupting the narrative), he rose, politely touched his bonnet-grec, and bade me a civil good-day.|$|E
60|$|Now {{it was on}} {{a certain}} evening near the middle of June that we three lads chanced to come upon Amos Nelson near the city dock.

60|$|It was a {{fundamental}} {{principle of the}} Gradgrind philosophy that everything was to be paid for.
