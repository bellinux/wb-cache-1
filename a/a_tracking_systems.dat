40|$|One of {{the options}} {{to prepare for a}} {{potential}} outbreak of an infectious livestock disease is to initiate <b>an</b> animal <b>tracking</b> <b>system,</b> which would provide information on animal movements and facilitate disease management. This article examines the benefits of implementing <b>an</b> animal <b>tracking</b> <b>system</b> {{in the context of a}} simulated cattle disease outbreak with and without animal tracking. Estimates are provided for some of the losses that would be avoided with <b>an</b> animal <b>tracking</b> <b>system</b> if <b>an</b> infectious animal disease were introduced. The results show that the economic efficiency of <b>an</b> animal <b>tracking</b> <b>system</b> depends on such factors as inter herd contact rates, effectiveness of animal disease response actions, and the extent to which <b>an</b> animal <b>tracking</b> <b>system</b> decreases the time of tracing animal movements. In case of a highly infectious animal disease outbreak substantial economic losses could be avoided if <b>an</b> effective animal <b>tracking</b> <b>system</b> is implemented.

40|$|Abstract. In this study, {{two types}} of marker-based <b>tracking</b> <b>systems</b> for Augmented Reality were developed: <b>a</b> <b>tracking</b> <b>system</b> using line markers and <b>a</b> <b>tracking</b> <b>system</b> using {{circular}} markers.

To enlarge the area in which tracking is available using {{only a limited number of}} markers, <b>a</b> hybrid <b>tracking</b> method and <b>a</b> two-layer <b>tracking</b> method were also developed. The experimental evaluation shows that both methods can increase the available area compared to legacy methods such as single-camera tracking and simple square markers.

40|$|Image guided surgery using medical robots is {{becoming}} popular these days. For image guided surgery, <b>a</b> <b>tracking</b> <b>system</b> {{is required to}} provide 6 DOF information of patient coordinate, surgical instruments and medical robots used in surgery. To provide 6 DOF information, a marker has to {{be attached to the}} target. However, it is hard to use many markers all together because the markers will take too much space in the surgical area. The <b>tracking</b> <b>system</b> proposed in this study utilizes down sized markers compared to traditional markers by using micro-engraved data-coded pattern with a lens instead of using geometrically specified marker spheres as <b>a</b> <b>tracking</b> target. <b>A</b> <b>tracking</b> <b>system</b> is developed that has a measurement area of 1 m to 2. 5 m from the <b>tracking</b> <b>system.</b> Experiment has been done for surgical navigation using the proposed <b>tracking</b> <b>system</b> and <b>a</b> medical robot...|$|R
