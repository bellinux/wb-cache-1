50|$|The first {{designated}} {{and public}} <b>ambulance</b> <b>operator</b> was the Women’s Humane Society (Ottawa Humane Society)that began service shortly after their inception in 1888. Seeing a {{need in the}} Ottawa community, a hand ambulance was purchased for the conveyance of injured persons and children. In their first few years as a society, the scope included: “We {{believe it to be}} our duty bettering the lot of neglected children by urging legislation to provide foster homes; supervising the overhaul of Ottawa’s only ambulance; and stirring up the public conscience to the fair treatment of all animals..” In addition to their hand ambulance, they also became advocates for heroism and first aid resources. Each year, awards for Bravery were given out to members of the public who put their lives in danger for another. The Ottawa Humane Society also raised funds to have large waterproof banners with resuscitation instructions and rescue buoys were put in the most frequent drowning sites. In under ten years, it was clear that providing ambulance services for the City of Ottawa was too large of a service for the Humane Society. With the final report given on the condition of their ambulance, the hand ambulance was donated in 1895 to the City of Ottawa’s fleet under the care of Mr. McKinstry of Queen Street.|$|E

50|$|Currently, housing {{affordability}} is {{a problem}} in Australia. For society to function people need to live affordably in or around areas where they work. Key workers such as nurses, teachers, police officers, fire fighters, <b>ambulance</b> <b>operators</b> and other members of society {{need to be able to}} access housing which is affordable. This generally means that they do not spend more than 30% of their household income on rent.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to visual warnings, ambulances can be fitted with audible warnings, sometimes known as sirens, which can alert people and vehicles {{to the presence}} of an ambulance before they can be seen. The first audible warnings were mechanical bells, mounted to either the front or roof of the ambulance. Most modern ambulances are now fitted with electronic sirens, producing a range of different noises which <b>ambulance</b> <b>operators</b> can use to attract more attention to themselves, particularly when proceeding through an intersection or in heavy traffic.|$|R
50|$|From 1994 until 1999, the {{previous}} contract for ground ambulance service in Nova Scotia with the <b>Ambulance</b> <b>Operators</b> Association of Nova Scotia (AOANS) was gradually {{taken over by}} Emergency Health Services, consolidating all the private ambulance companies in Nova Scotia into a single entity. A new contract was then awarded, under a long-term performance based contract, to Emergency Medical Care Inc. (EMC).

50|$|At {{the time}} of the merger, Mørefly was one of the two large air <b>ambulance</b> <b>operators</b> in Norway, along with Norsk Luftambulanse. In {{addition}} to its main base at Ålesund Airport, Vigra, there were fixed-wing air ambulance bases at Brønnøysund Airport, Brønnøy; Bodø Airport; Tromsø Airport; Alta Airport; and Kirkenes Airport, Høybuktmoen, served by six Beechcraft King Air. A Dauphin 2 was flown out of Ålesund Heliport, Central Hospital. It also held a contract with the Norwegian Coast Guard to fly maritime surveillance over the North Sea.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Ambulance</b> <b>Operators</b> Association of Nova Scotia (AOANS) was {{the provincial}} {{association}} representing ambulance company owners in Nova Scotia. The association’s focus was {{negotiating with the}} Government of Nova Scotia over funding, service standards, and private ownership of ambulance services. The AOANS was also contracted by the Government of Nova Scotia to provide a training program for ambulance personnel and an ambulance inspection program. Between 1994 and 1999, {{after the publication of}} the Murphy Report, Nova Scotia transitioned to a single ambulance service provider. This resulted in the AOANS members being bought-out and their ambulance services merged into the new system. The AOANS was formally dissolved in 2002.|$|R
50|$|The ATU is {{the largest}} labor {{organization}} representing transit workers in the United States and Canada, with over 190,000 members in over 240 local unions spread across 46 states and nine provinces. The main membership consists primarily of transit operators, though the union also includes more than 800 members working in over 80 craft occupations. ATU-represented job classifications include bus, van, subway, and light rail operators, clerks, baggage handlers and maintenance employees in urban transit, over-the-road and school bus industries, as well as emergency medical service personnel, <b>ambulance</b> <b>operators,</b> clerical personnel, and municipal workers.

50|$|Prior to 1995, Nova Scotia {{relied on}} {{approximately}} 50 funeral home, {{private and public}} ambulance companies, the owners of which were represented by the <b>Ambulance</b> <b>Operators</b> Association of Nova Scotia (AOANS). The level of medical care, staff qualifications, type and condition of ambulances and supplies, and working conditions varied throughout the province. Most medical air transportation {{was provided by the}} Canadian Forces' 413 Transport and Rescue Squadron operating out of CFB Summerside (1968-1990) and CFB Greenwood (1990-present). 413 Squadron used search and rescue aircraft such as the CH-113 Labrador helicopter as well as the CC-115 Buffalo and later the CC-130 Hercules fixed wing aircraft to deliver aid to the civil power missions.|$|R
50|$|Some of the {{electric}} cars made by Alkè (for example the Alkè ATX 100 E) are used in soccer stadiums as open <b>ambulances.</b> The <b>operator</b> of London's cycle hire scheme uses {{a small number of}} Alkè electric utility vehicles (alongside other cars and vans) to tow trailers for distributing bicycles.|$|R
40|$|Ambulances {{involved}} in collisions with motorists at intersections {{result in a}} number of negative outcomes including the inability to respond to the assigned emergency task, injury of people, and sometimes the loss of an operational appliance. The warning siren is perhaps the only non-visible device to alerting motorists approaching intersections of a converging ambulance. Acoustic measurements were conducted on several commercial-off-the-shelf sirens, a motor vehicle, and an ambulance, to characterise the noise transmission system. Tests were conducted in order to provide recommendations to improve the audibility and effectiveness of the warning signal. It is recommended that <b>ambulance</b> <b>operators</b> install sirens that broadcast sideways to the ambulance; that broadcast low frequencies so that the siren sound can penetrate into vehicle cabins; and that have signals with short repetition periods to convey high perceived-urgency.

40|$|The {{most urgent}} {{recommendation}} expressed by physicians, Red Cross officials, <b>ambulance</b> <b>operators</b> and others polled in this ambulance survey {{was to make}} much more emergency medical care training available to ambulance personnel. Very few sick and injured receive first aid before an ambulance arrives. Therefore {{there is also an}} urgent need to train and motivate the public to provide first aid {{at the scene of the}} emergency. Urban ambulances usually respond within 10 minutes, but often rural ambulances take more than 30 minutes to reach an emergency. It is during this interim that lives which could be saved by prompt first aid are lost. Little use has been made of aircraft as emergency ambulances; in 1968, only one emergency trip in 1500 was made by helicopter. Also, California has fewer ambulances which make fewer emergency trips on a population basis than the country at large...|$|R
25|$|The SH09 {{is offered}} with various {{different}} layout configurations; the default of these options has {{a total of}} four passenger seats present in addition to a pair in the front for the pilots, all of which are fully adjustable in height and length. In a high density configuration, five seats are installed in the rear position along with two more passenger seats inline with the pilot's own, which loses the option of the floor window. The use of Kevlar-threaded crashworthy fuel tanks, which are built into the wall and floor of the cargo hold, freed up space to allow for fully adjustable passenger seats in the cabin. The cargo hold is sized to accommodate 10 items of baggage, while the fuel tanks are sized to provide for an endurance of nearly five hours. The rear clamshell door and high-mounted tail boom is thought to potentially be attractive to North American-based air <b>ambulance</b> <b>operators.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Toronto {{may very}} well be able to claim to have the first {{formally}} trained 'ambulance attendants' in North America, with the Toronto Police Force ambulance service staff receiving five days of formal training in their jobs from the St. John Ambulance Brigade in 1889. [...] Training included first aid skills, anatomy and physiology. Such training for ambulance attendants was unheard of at that time, outside of military circles. [...] The police constables assigned to the ambulance also did regular policing, when not required for ambulance calls. As the city grew and technology progressed, so did the ambulance service. [...] The first motorized ambulance was actually purchased by a local funeral home in 1911, and the Toronto Police Ambulance Service began the conversion from horse-drawn to motorized vehicles in 1913, with the process largely completed by 1918.

5000|$|Each {{year the}} City of Ottawa {{would ask for}} tenders to provide {{ambulance}} service for emergency calls excluding contagious disease cases. A variety of offers would come in showing the vast interest in providing ambulance service, but it also showed a lack of direction since the lowest tender was almost always the one taken. [...] Alphonse Julien, Woodburn, Gauthier, Landreville, Hulse, Brady and Harris, Whelan, Tubman, A.E. Veitch, Geo. B. Burney, Rogers, McEvoy, Radmore and Stewart, Rancine, and Fred N.

Other potential <b>ambulance</b> <b>operators</b> were Louis Duhamel a carriage maker {{turn of the century}} and ambulance mechanic, Medric Landreville (son of Joseph Landreville who owned Landreville Funeral Home) and Peter Shorkey operated taxi services in the 1930s as well as ambulance services. Arthur Wilson Ambulance Service provided service {{for a short period of}} time. These services valiantly took on the task of providing ambulance care, but with unpaid accounts, lack of accountability and few resources, each provider amalgamated, discontinued ambulance service and sold their equipment to the next generation of ambulance providers.|$|R
