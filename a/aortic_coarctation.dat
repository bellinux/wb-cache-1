40|$|BACKGROUND: Despite {{advances}} in surgical and interventional techniques, the optimal surgical treatment of severe <b>aortic</b> (re) <b>coarctation</b> and hypoplastic <b>aortic</b> arch is still controversial. Anatomic repair may require extensive dissection, cardiopulmonary bypass, and deep hypothermic circulatory arrest with their inherent risks. The {{aim of this}} study was to analyze the outcome of off-pump extraanatomic aortic bypass as a surgical alternative to local repair. METHODS: From February 2000 to December 2005, ten consecutive patients (median age 20 years; range, 11 to 38 years) with severe <b>aortic</b> (re) <b>coarctation</b> (n = 4) and (or) hypoplastic aortic arch (n = 7) underwent off-pump extraanatomic aortic bypass through median sternotomy. All but three patients had undergone previous surgery for coarctation and angioplasty or stenting. Three patients underwent concomitant replacement of the ascending aorta because of an aneurysm using cardiopulmonary bypass. RESULTS: Postoperative hospital course was uneventful in all patients. There was no perioperative mortality or significant morbidity. During a mean follow-up of 48 +/- 22 months no patient required additional procedures. All patients were free of symptoms; no patient showed signs of heart failure after follow-up. At last follow-up, no patient presented with claudication, nor any patient experienced orthostatic problems due to a steal phenomenon. During follow-up, hypertension resolved in all patients with residual mild hypertension in two patients. CONCLUSIONS: Off-pump extraanatomic aortic bypass is an attractive treatment option for complex <b>aortic</b> (re) <b>coarctation</b> and hypoplastic <b>aortic</b> arch.

40|$|Metabolism of left {{ventricular}} myosin was studied in rabbits (2. 7 - 3. 2 kg) following banding of the ascending aorta (65 % occlusion). In 26 rabbits {{the incorporation of}} amino acid into myosin was determined 2, 3, 4, 9, and 15 days after either stenosis or sham operation by injecting 3 H-lysine (0. 5 me/kg) 4 hours before the animals were killed. In 32 rabbits the same dose of 3 H-lysine was injected 24 hours before surgery, and disappearance of isotope from myosin was measured by killing the rabbits after 3, 5, 7, 10, or 16 days. Specific radioactivity of free lysine, myosin, and total proteins was determined in {{left ventricular}} samples from each animal. The experimental results indicate that: (1) left ventricular peak systolic pressure increased from 97 to 163 mm Hg; (2) the ratio of left ventricular weight to body weight increased about 16 %; (3) disappearance of free 3 H-lysine was similar in rabbits with aortic stenosis and those with sham operations; (4) after the second day myosin synthesis was greater in rabbits with <b>aortic</b> <b>coarctations,</b> reaching a maximu...|$|R

40|$|Coarctation of the aorta {{may develop}} during fetal life and impair {{quality of life}} in the adult because upper body {{hypertension}} and aneurysm formation in the descending aorta may develop. We used our computational model of the young adult arterial circulation, incorporated aorta coarctation over a range from 0 to 80 % and evaluated the effects in terms of forward pressure (P (+)) and backward pressure (P (-)). Predictions at several sites proximal and distal to the coarctation using an impedance-based waveform separation method (WSA) and the time-domain technique of wave intensity analysis (WIA) yielded comparable outcomes. A large reflected backward compression wave was seen proximal to the coarctation. Both techniques, WSA and WIA, gave the same results in terms of P (+) and P (-). A descending index (DI) was formulated as the difference between peak systolic pressure and valve closure pressure, divided by the pulse pressure.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. This study {{sought to}} define 1) the risk of sudden death after {{operation}} for common congenital heart defects; and 2) factors {{associated with an increased}} risk of sudden death. Background. Although the prognosis for patients with congenital heart defects is improved by surgical treatment, they remain at a well recognized but poorly defined risk of late sudden death. Methods. This population-based study evaluated all patients < 19 years old undergoing surgical treatment of common forms of congenital heart disease in the state of Oregon between 1958 and 1996. Patients were identified retrospectively through 1958, with prospective biannual follow-up beginning in 1982. The incidence and cause of late sudden death were evaluated for 3, 589 patients surviving operation for the following defects: atrial, ventricular and atrioventricular septal defects; patent ductus arteriosus; pulmonary stenosis; <b>aortic</b> stenosis; <b>coarctation</b> of the aorta; tetralogy of Fallot; and d-transposition of the great arteries. Results. There were 41 unexpected late sudden deaths during 45, 857 patient-years of follow-up, an overall event rate of 1 / 1, 118 patient-years. Thirty-seven of the 41 late sudden deaths occurred in patients with <b>aortic</b> stenosis, <b>coarctation,</b> transposition of the great arteries or tetralogy of Fallot, an event rate of 1 / 454 patients-years. In contrast, only four sudden deaths occurred among the other defects, an event rate of 1 / 7, 154 patient-years (p < 0. 01). The risk of late sudden death increased incrementally 20 years after operation for tetralogy of Fallot, <b>aortic</b> stenosis and <b>coarctation.</b> However, risk was not dependent on patient age at operation or surgical era. The causes of sudden death were arrhythmia in 30 patients, circulatory (embolic or aneurysm rupture) in 7 and acute heart failure in 4. Conclusions. The risk of late sudden death for patients surviving operation for common congenital heart defects is 25 to 100 times greater than an age-matched control population. This increased risk is primarily represented by patients with cyanotic or left heart obstructive lesions. The risk of sudden death appears to be time dependent, increasing primarily after the second postoperative decade...|$|R

A discrete subaortic membrane is a rare cause of subaortic stenosis in adult.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe wide {{morphological}} {{variety of}} {{coarctation of the aorta}} (CoA) and some complications {{resulting from the}} implantation of conventional stents has made the utilization of covered stents (CS) desirable. We describe our experience with the use of CS to treat CoA in children and adults. MethodsThe records of patients that received CS were retrospectively reviewed. The procedures were performed according to the established technique. Use of CS as primary treatment were assessed, as well as those deployed due to complications resulting from the initial procedure. ResultsBetween 2007 and 2014, CS were used in 14 patients, 9 (64. 3 %) of whom were males. The mean age was 19. 5 ± 10. 5 years, and the mean weight 61. 7 ± 25. 5 kg. Bicuspid aortic valve was present in 74 % of cases, and two patients had patent ductus arteriosus. Subatretic <b>aortic</b> <b>coarctations</b> were found in five patients. Eleven patients had systemic arterial hypertension, and 73 % had normalized blood pressure levels after stent dilation. Implantation was possible in all cases. Primary implants were performed in ten (71. 4 %) patients with native coarctation and in four patients as a second device to correct problems originating from previous procedures. The mean time of follow-up was 51. 7 ± 29. 8 months. Three minor complications were related to procedures, and there were no deaths. ConclusionsThe use of CS was safe and effective in this small case series. Further studies focusing on the long-term evolution and the possibility of CS redilation are needed to support its use in children...|$|R
