Because it is an essential enzyme for vital functions of DNA during normal cell growth, inhibitors of its activity are considered as promising anticancer agents. Eleven aqueous and two methanolic extracts derived from Leguminosae family plants cultivated in Greece, along with fractions rich in phenolic compounds isolated from the two methanolic extracts of Vicia faba and Lotus edulis were examined {{for their ability to}} affect topoisomerase I-induced nicking of DNA, using topoisomerase I relaxation assay. From the tested extracts, only the aqueous extracts of <b>aerial</b> <b>plant</b> parts of Lathyrus laxiflorus subsp. Laxiflorus and Vicia faba and both methanolic extracts of <b>aerial</b> <b>plant</b> parts of Vicia faba and Lotus edulis exhibited the ability to inhibit the nicking activity of topoisomerase I.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to identify the phenotypic and genotypic correlations between the plant cycle and plant habit and the effect on yield in landrace bean genotypes. The experiment was conducted in Joaçaba and Lages, Santa Catarina State for the 2008 / 2009 crop using 26 bean genotypes: 22 landrace and 4 commercial genotypes obtained from the UDESC. We evaluated the number of days from emergence to flowering, number of days from flowering to physiological maturity and number of days from emergence to physiological maturity in relation to the genotypes' cycle. The <b>aerial</b> <b>plant</b> architecture characteristics evaluated were the growth habit, plant habit, plant height, stem diameter, height of the first pod insertion and number of nodes on the main stem. Trail analysis showed that there was a positive correlation between the emergence-to-flowering period and yield and that the emergence-physiological maturity; flowering-physiological maturity showed a negative correlation to the yield in both locations. Therefore, short-cycle genotypes, especially those with a reduced post-flowering period, produced increased yields. The <b>aerial</b> <b>plant</b> architecture characteristics showed phenotypic and genotypic positive correlations with the yield in both environments. To increase yield, the reproductive period needs to coincide with periods of the greatest photosynthetically active radiation...|$|E

Among the tested media sand + silt + clay showed statistically significant effect as regards plant survival (75. 67 %), plant height (20. 80 cm), stem weight (6. 41 g) and number of leaves per plant (23. 02). Maximum germination (92. 22 %) was observed in sand + silt. Irrigation with two days interval significantly affected plant survival (66. 42 %), plant height (17. 53 cm), stem weight (5. 42 g) and number of leaves per plant (20. 12).
