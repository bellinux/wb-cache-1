25|$|<b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>we</b> used a {{character}} {{that looked like}} a rabbit with ears that could extend and pick up objects. As the game got faster and faster, we needed {{to come up with a}} special characteristic to give our character some power over his enemies. I remembered {{a character}} I had thought about years ago who could roll himself into a ball and slam into enemies. Hedgehogs can roll themselves into a ball, so we decided to go from a rabbit to a hedgehog.|$|E
25|$|I {{had been}} having some {{difficulty}} with the relief committee of the Denver smelter men. <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>we</b> had been giving out relief at such a rate that I had to tell the chairman that he was providing the smelter men with more than they had had while at work. Then he cut down the rations until the wives of the smelter men began to complain {{that they were not}} getting enough to eat. Years later, when his letters were published in The Pinkerton Labor Spy, I discovered that the chairman of the relief committe (sic) was a Pinkerton detective, who was carrying out the instructions of the agency...|$|E
500|$|I {{found that}} such a {{pendulum}} actually was used during the Spanish and German inquisitions. [...] <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>we</b> tried to use a rubberized blade, and that's why it got stuck on Kerr's chest. [...] We then switched to a sharp metalized blade covered with steel paint. [...] The problem was {{to get it in}} exactly the right position so it would slash John's shirt without actually cutting him. [...] To guard against this, we put a steel band around his waist where the pendulum crosses. [...] He was a good sport about it...but noticed him perspiring a good bit and no wonder. [...] That pendulum was carving out a 50 foot arc just above his body.|$|E

500|$|The {{series was}} {{initially}} titled Britney and Kevin: Can You Handle Our Truth?, before its title {{was changed to}} Britney and Kevin: Chaotic, with [...] "Can you handle our truth?" [...] becoming its tagline. All of the footage shot for OnTourage was used for Britney and Kevin: Chaotic. According to Spears, the series helped the couple {{to know each other}} more, saying: [...] "I didn't know [...] that well, and when I got the camera out, it made me feel better. It's really weird because it was like all this tension <b>at</b> <b>first.</b> <b>We</b> were so nervous being together. I'm really shy, and when I had the camera in my hand, it made me feel more outspoken." ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>At</b> <b>first</b> , <b>we</b> {{were called}} Force. I {{think we had}} gotten that name from a UFO album, {{but there was also}} a band called Rising Force with Yngwie Malmsteen.

But as the night progressed, they started liking it more and more." ...|$|E

Let [...] be any chain contraction of the mapping cone, i.e. [...] for all n.

It was very interesting to be in that environment; it was such a complete departure from our lives in Uruguay. Essentially, we were in a place where people didn't want you, and didn't understand what you were about", he said. And though Espuelas did not speak any English, [...] "growing up like that provided a tremendous incentive for me to learn. [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{six months}} a working {{prototype}} was pitched to several publishers. [...] Microsoft Studios {{was one of}} three publishers interested in Barracuda, and talks began for publishing the game. [...] "There was this one producer at Microsoft Game Studios who kept talking about how with a few tweaks Barracuda would make an awesome Hydro Thunder sequel. [...] <b>At</b> <b>first</b> <b>we</b> were like, yeah right, that'll happen. [...] But the more we all talked about it, the more it started to make sense." [...] The decision was made to turn the game into a Hydro Thunder sequel and Microsoft Studios acquired the rights to the Hydro Thunder name shortly before publisher Midway Games was bought by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment.|$|E

2500|$|Principal {{cinematography}} for {{the second}} season occurred in September 2009 (which meant some of the contestants missed the opening of school in order to finish the show). Most of the second season was filmed around the Georgian Bay area of Lake Huron and Algonquin Provincial Park. None of the teens knew {{the location of the}} series, but were aware that they were not close to any cities or towns. The teens were always watched by an adult and were provided warm clothes at night. Initially, many of the contestants did not take the show or host Les Stroud seriously. According to contestant Patricia Robins, [...] "We were calling him Les Stroodle. ...<b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>we</b> all thought he was kind of a jerk, just because of his attitude. [...] toward the end we kind of adopted him as a father figure. He's really protective. We found that out later on." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1865, {{a review}} in The Times by E.S. Dallas lauded Our Mutual Friend as [...] "one {{of the best}} of even Dickens's tales," [...] but was unable to ignore the flaws. [...] "This last novel of Mr Charles Dickens, really one of his finest works, and one in which on {{occasion}} he even surpasses himself, labours under the disadvantage of a beginning that drags ... On the whole, however, at that early stage the reader was more perplexed than pleased. There was an appearance of great effort without corresponding result. We were introduced to a set of people in whom it is impossible to take an interest, and were made familiar with transactions that suggested horror. The great master of fiction exhibited all his skill, performed the most wonderful feats of language, loaded his page with wit and many a fine touch peculiar to himself. The agility of his pen was amazing, but still <b>at</b> <b>first</b> <b>we</b> were not much amused." [...] Despite the mixed review, it pleased Dickens so well that he gave Dallas the manuscript.|$|E
