5|$|<b>Archaea</b> and {{bacteria}} are generally similar {{in size and}} shape, although a few <b>archaea</b> have very strange shapes, such as the flat and square-shaped cells of Haloquadratum walsbyi. Despite this morphological similarity to bacteria, <b>archaea</b> possess genes and several metabolic pathways that are {{more closely related to}} those of eukaryotes, notably the enzymes involved in transcription and translation. Other aspects of archaeal biochemistry are unique, such as their reliance on ether lipids in their cell membranes, including archaeols. <b>Archaea</b> use more energy sources than eukaryotes: these range from organic compounds, such as sugars, to ammonia, metal ions or even hydrogen gas. Salt-tolerant <b>archaea</b> (the Haloarchaea) use sunlight as an energy source, and other species of <b>archaea</b> fix carbon; however, unlike plants and cyanobacteria, no known species of <b>archaea</b> does both. <b>Archaea</b> reproduce asexually by binary fission, fragmentation, or budding; unlike bacteria and eukaryotes, no known species forms spores.|$|E
5|$|<b>Archaea</b> and {{bacteria}} have generally similar cell structure, but cell composition and organization set the <b>archaea</b> apart. Like bacteria, <b>archaea</b> lack interior membranes and organelles. Like bacteria, the cell membranes of <b>archaea</b> are usually bounded by a cell wall and they swim using {{one or more}} flagella. Structurally, <b>archaea</b> are most similar to gram-positive bacteria. Most have a single plasma membrane and cell wall, and lack a periplasmic space; the exception to this general rule is Ignicoccus, which possess a particularly large periplasm that contains membrane-bound vesicles and is enclosed by an outer membrane.|$|E
5|$|<b>Archaea</b> are prokaryotic {{unicellular}} organisms, {{and form}} the first domain of life, in Carl Woese's three-domain system. A prokaryote {{is defined as}} having no cell nucleus or other membrane bound-organelle. <b>Archaea</b> share this defining feature with the bacteria {{with which they were}} once grouped. In 1990 the microbiologist Woese proposed the three-domain system that divided living things into bacteria, <b>archaea</b> and eukaryotes, and thereby split the prokaryote domain.|$|E
5|$|<b>Archaea</b> {{differ from}} {{bacteria}} in both their genetics and biochemistry. For example, while bacterial cell membranes {{are made from}} phosphoglycerides with ester bonds, archaean membranes are made of ether lipids. <b>Archaea</b> were originally described as extremophiles living in extreme environments, such as hot springs, but have since been found in all types of habitats. Only now are scientists beginning to realize how common <b>archaea</b> are in the environment, with Crenarchaeota being {{the most common form}} of life in the ocean, dominating ecosystems below 150 m in depth. These organisms are also common in soil and play a vital role in ammonia oxidation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Archaea</b> {{exist in}} {{a broad range of}} habitats, and as a major part of global ecosystems, may {{represent}} about 20% of microbial cells in the oceans. The first-discovered archaeans were extremophiles. Indeed, some <b>archaea</b> survive high temperatures, often above , as found in geysers, black smokers, and oil wells. Other common habitats include very cold habitats and highly saline, acidic, or alkaline water. However, <b>archaea</b> include mesophiles that grow in mild conditions, in swamps and marshland, sewage, the oceans, the intestinal tract of animals, and soils.|$|E
5|$|<b>Archaea</b> recycle {{elements}} such as carbon, nitrogen and sulfur through their various habitats. Although these activities are vital for normal ecosystem function, <b>archaea</b> can also contribute to human-made changes, and even cause pollution.|$|E
5|$|<b>Archaea</b> were {{initially}} viewed as extremophiles living in harsh environments, such as hot springs and salt lakes, {{but they have}} since been found in {{a broad range of}} habitats, including soils, oceans, and marshlands. They are also part of the human microbiota, found in the colon, oral cavity, and skin. <b>Archaea</b> are particularly numerous in the oceans, and the <b>archaea</b> in plankton {{may be one of the}} most abundant groups of organisms on the planet. <b>Archaea</b> are a major part of Earth's life and may play roles in both the carbon cycle and the nitrogen cycle. No clear examples of archaeal pathogens or parasites are known, but they are often mutualists or commensals. One example is the methanogens that inhabit human and ruminant guts, where their vast numbers aid digestion. Methanogens are also used in biogas production and sewage treatment, and biotechnology exploits enzymes from extremophile <b>archaea</b> that can endure high temperatures and organic solvents.|$|E
5|$|Both {{bacteria}} and eukaryotes, but not <b>archaea,</b> make spores. Some species of Haloarchaea undergo phenotypic switching and grow as several different cell types, including thick-walled structures that {{are resistant to}} osmotic shock and allow the <b>archaea</b> to survive in water at low salt concentrations, {{but these are not}} reproductive structures and may instead help them reach new habitats.|$|E
5|$|Extremophile <b>archaea</b> {{are members}} of four main {{physiological}} groups. These are the halophiles, thermophiles, alkaliphiles, and acidophiles. These groups are not comprehensive or phylum-specific, nor are they mutually exclusive, since some <b>archaea</b> belong to several groups. Nonetheless, they are a useful starting point for classification.|$|E
5|$|In {{anaerobic}} protozoa, such as Plagiopyla frontata, <b>archaea</b> reside {{inside the}} protozoa and consume hydrogen produced in their hydrogenosomes. <b>Archaea</b> also associate with larger organisms. For example, the marine archaean Cenarchaeum symbiosum lives within (is an endosymbiont of) the sponge Axinella mexicana.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sulfur}} cycle, <b>archaea</b> that grow by {{oxidizing}} sulfur compounds release this element from rocks, making it available to other organisms. However, the <b>archaea</b> that do this, such as Sulfolobus, produce sulfuric acid as a waste product, {{and the growth}} of these organisms in abandoned mines can contribute to acid mine drainage and other environmental damage.|$|E
5|$|Individual <b>archaea</b> {{range from}} 0.1micrometers (μm) to over 15μm in diameter, and occur in various shapes, {{commonly}} as spheres, rods, spirals or plates. Other morphologies in the Crenarchaeota include irregularly shaped lobed cells in Sulfolobus, needle-like filaments {{that are less}} than half a micrometer in diameter in Thermofilum, and almost perfectly rectangular rods in Thermoproteus and Pyrobaculum. <b>Archaea</b> in the genus Haloquadratum such as Haloquadratum walsbyi are flat, square <b>archaea</b> that live in hypersaline pools. These unusual shapes are probably maintained both by their cell walls and a prokaryotic cytoskeleton. Proteins related to the cytoskeleton components of other organisms exist in <b>archaea,</b> and filaments form within their cells, but in contrast to other organisms, these cellular structures are poorly understood. In Thermoplasma and Ferroplasma the lack of a cell wall means that the cells have irregular shapes, and can resemble amoebae.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that the <b>archaea</b> evolved from gram-positive bacteria in response to antibiotic selection pressure. This {{is suggested by the}} observation that <b>archaea</b> are resistant {{to a wide variety of}} antibiotics that are primarily produced by gram-positive bacteria, and that these antibiotics primarily act on the genes that distinguish <b>archaea</b> from bacteria. The proposal is that the selective pressure towards resistance generated by the gram-positive antibiotics was eventually sufficient to cause extensive changes in many of the antibiotics' target genes, and that these strains represented the common ancestors of present-day <b>Archaea.</b> The evolution of <b>Archaea</b> in response to antibiotic selection, or any other competitive selective pressure, could also explain their adaptation to extreme environments (such as high temperature or acidity) as the result of a search for unoccupied niches to escape from antibiotic-producing organisms; Cavalier-Smith has made a similar suggestion. This proposal is also supported by other work investigating protein structural relationships and studies that suggest that gram-positive bacteria may constitute the earliest branching lineages within the prokaryotes.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>archaea</b> (but not Thermoplasma and Ferroplasma) {{possess a}} cell wall. In most <b>archaea</b> {{the wall is}} {{assembled}} from surface-layer proteins, which form an S-layer. An S-layer is a rigid array of protein molecules that cover {{the outside of the}} cell (like chain mail). This layer provides both chemical and physical protection, and can prevent macromolecules from contacting the cell membrane. Unlike bacteria, <b>archaea</b> lack peptidoglycan in their cell walls. Methanobacteriales do have cell walls containing pseudopeptidoglycan, which resembles eubacterial peptidoglycan in morphology, function, and physical structure, but pseudopeptidoglycan is distinct in chemical structure; it lacks D-amino acids and N-acetylmuramic acid.|$|E
5|$|One {{property}} {{unique to}} <b>Archaea</b> is the abundant use of ether-linked lipids in their cell membranes. Ether linkages are more chemically stable than the ester linkages found in Bacteria and Eukarya, {{which may be}} a contributing factor {{to the ability of}} many <b>Archaea</b> to survive in extreme environments that place heavy stress on cell membranes, such as extreme heat and salinity. Comparative analysis of archaeal genomes has also identified several molecular signatures in the form of conserved signature indels and signature proteins which are uniquely present in either all <b>Archaea</b> or different main groups within <b>Archaea.</b> Another unique feature of <b>Archaea</b> is that no other known organisms are capable of methanogenesis (the metabolic production of methane). Methanogenic <b>Archaea</b> play a pivotal role in ecosystems with organisms that derive energy from oxidation of methane, many of which are Bacteria, as they are often a major source of methane in such environments and can play a role as primary producers. Methanogens also {{play a critical role in}} the carbon cycle, breaking down organic carbon into methane, which is also a major greenhouse gas.|$|E
5|$|Proteasomes {{are found}} inside all eukaryotes and <b>archaea,</b> {{and in some}} bacteria.|$|E
5|$|Recently, {{several studies}} have shown that <b>archaea</b> exist not only in {{mesophilic}} and thermophilic environments but are also present, sometimes in high numbers, at low temperatures as well. For example, <b>archaea</b> are common in cold oceanic environments such as polar seas. Even more significant are the large numbers of <b>archaea</b> found throughout the world's oceans in non-extreme habitats among the plankton community (as part of the picoplankton). Although these <b>archaea</b> can be present in extremely high numbers (up to 40% of the microbial biomass), almost none of these species have been isolated and studied in pure culture. Consequently, our understanding of the role of <b>archaea</b> in ocean ecology is rudimentary, so their full influence on global biogeochemical cycles remains largely unexplored. Some marine Crenarchaeota are capable of nitrification, suggesting these organisms may affect the oceanic nitrogen cycle, although these oceanic Crenarchaeota may also use other sources of energy. Vast numbers of <b>archaea</b> are also found in the sediments that cover the sea floor, with these organisms making up the majority of living cells at depths over 1 meter below the ocean bottom. It has been demonstrated that in all oceanic surface sediments (from 1000- to 10,000-m water depth), the impact of viral infection is higher on <b>archaea</b> than on bacteria and virus-induced lysis of <b>archaea</b> accounts for up to one-third of the total microbial biomass killed, resulting in the release of ~0.3 to 0.5 gigatons of carbon per year globally.|$|E
5|$|Some Euryarchaeota are methanogens (<b>archaea</b> {{that produce}} methane {{as a result}} of metabolism) living in {{anaerobic}} environments, such as swamps. This form of metabolism evolved early, and it is even possible that the first free-living organism was a methanogen. A common reaction involves the use of carbon dioxide as an electron acceptor to oxidize hydrogen. Methanogenesis involves a range of coenzymes that are unique to these <b>archaea,</b> such as coenzyme M and methanofuran. Other organic compounds such as alcohols, acetic acid or formic acid are used as alternative electron acceptors by methanogens. These reactions are common in gut-dwelling <b>archaea.</b> Acetic acid is also broken down into methane and carbon dioxide directly, by acetotrophic <b>archaea.</b> These acetotrophs are <b>archaea</b> in the order Methanosarcinales, and are {{a major part of the}} communities of microorganisms that produce biogas.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses {{replicate}} within archaea: {{these are}} double-stranded DNA viruses with unusual and sometimes unique shapes. These viruses {{have been studied}} in most detail in the thermophilic <b>archaea,</b> particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Defences against these viruses involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences within archaean genomes {{that are related to}} the genes of the viruses. Most <b>archaea</b> have CRISPR–Cas systems as an adaptive defence against viruses. These enable <b>archaea</b> to retain sections of viral DNA, which are then used to target and eliminate subsequent infections by the virus using a process similar to RNA interference.|$|E
5|$|The {{classification}} of <b>archaea</b> into species is also controversial. Biology defines a species {{as a group}} of related organisms. The familiar exclusive breeding criterion (organisms that can breed with each other but not with others) is of no help here because <b>archaea</b> reproduce asexually.|$|E
5|$|Woese {{used his}} new rRNA {{comparison}} method to categorize and contrast different organisms. He sequenced {{a variety of}} different species and happened upon a group of methanogens that had vastly different patterns than any known prokaryotes or eukaryotes. These methanogens were much more similar to each other than they were to other organisms sequenced, leading Woese to propose the new domain of <b>Archaea.</b> His experiments showed that the <b>Archaea</b> were more similar to eukaryotes than prokaryotes, even though they were more similar to prokaryotes in structure. This led to the conclusion that <b>Archaea</b> and Eukarya shared a more recent common ancestor than Eukarya and Bacteria in general. The development of the nucleus occurred after the split between Bacteria and this common ancestor. Although <b>Archaea</b> are prokaryotic, they are more closely related to Eukarya and thus cannot be placed within either the Bacteria or Eukarya domains.|$|E
5|$|<b>Archaea</b> can be {{infected}} by double-stranded DNA viruses that are unrelated {{to any other}} form of virus and have a variety of unusual shapes, including bottles, hooked rods, or teardrops. These viruses have been studied in most detail in thermophilics, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Two groups of single-stranded DNA viruses that infect <b>archaea</b> have been recently isolated. One group is exemplified by the Halorubrum pleomorphic virus 1 ("Pleolipoviridae") infecting halophilic <b>archaea</b> and the other one by the Aeropyrum coil-shaped virus ("Spiraviridae") infecting a hyperthermophilic (optimal growth at 90–95°C) host. Notably, the latter virus has the largest currently reported ssDNA genome. Defenses against these viruses may involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences that are related to the genes of the viruses.|$|E
5|$|<b>Archaea</b> {{reproduce}} asexually by binary {{or multiple}} fission, fragmentation, or budding; meiosis does not occur, so if {{a species of}} <b>archaea</b> exists {{in more than one}} form, all have the same genetic material. Cell division is controlled in a cell cycle; after the cell's chromosome is replicated and the two daughter chromosomes separate, the cell divides. In the genus Sulfolobus, the cycle has characteristics that are similar to both bacterial and eukaryotic systems. The chromosomes replicate from multiple starting-points (origins of replication) using DNA polymerases that resemble the equivalent eukaryotic enzymes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Archaea</b> {{usually have}} a single {{circular}} chromosome, {{with as many as}} 5,751,492base pairs in Methanosarcina acetivorans, the largest known archaeal genome. The tiny 490,885base-pair genome of Nanoarchaeum equitans is one-tenth of this size and the smallest archaeal genome known; it is estimated to contain only 537 protein-encoding genes. Smaller independent pieces of DNA, called plasmids, are also found in <b>archaea.</b> Plasmids may be transferred between cells by physical contact, in a process that may be similar to bacterial conjugation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Archaea</b> were {{initially}} classified as bacteria, receiving the name archaebacteria (in the Archaebacteria kingdom), but this classification is outdated. Archaeal cells have unique properties separating {{them from the}} other two domains of life, Bacteria and Eukaryota. The <b>Archaea</b> are further divided into multiple recognized phyla. Classification is difficult because the majority have not been isolated in the laboratory and have only been detected by analysis of their nucleic acids in samples from their environment.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{bacteria}} form close spatial {{associations that}} are essential for their survival. One such mutualistic association, called interspecies hydrogen transfer, occurs between clusters of anaerobic bacteria that consume organic acids, such as butyric acid or propionic acid, and produce hydrogen, and methanogenic <b>Archaea</b> that consume hydrogen. The bacteria in this association are unable to consume the organic acids as this reaction produces hydrogen that accumulates in their surroundings. Only the intimate association with the hydrogen-consuming <b>Archaea</b> keeps the hydrogen concentration low enough to allow the bacteria to grow.|$|E
5|$|Curium has no {{biological}} significance. There {{are a few}} {{reports on}} biosorption of Cm3+ by bacteria and <b>archaea,</b> however no evidence for incorporation of curium into them.|$|E
5|$|Domains are a {{relatively}} new grouping. First proposed in 1977, Carl Woese's three-domain system was not generally accepted until later. One main characteristic of the three-domain method is the separation of <b>Archaea</b> and Bacteria, previously grouped into the single kingdom Bacteria (a kingdom also sometimes called Monera), with the Eukaryota for all organisms whose cells contain a nucleus. A small number of scientists include a sixth kingdom, <b>Archaea,</b> but do not accept the domain method.|$|E
5|$|In <b>archaea</b> several exosome {{proteins}} {{are present}} in multiple copies, to form the full core of the exosome complex.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the range of applications of archaean enzymes, {{the use of the}} organisms themselves in biotechnology is less developed. Methanogenic <b>archaea</b> are a vital part of sewage treatment, since {{they are part of the}} community of microorganisms that carry out anaerobic digestion and produce biogas. In mineral processing, acidophilic <b>archaea</b> display promise for the extraction of metals from ores, including gold, cobalt and copper.|$|E
5|$|In some <b>archaea,</b> the {{lipid bilayer}} is {{replaced}} by a monolayer. In effect, the <b>archaea</b> fuse the tails of two phospholipid molecules into a single molecule with two polar heads (a bolaamphiphile); this fusion may make their membranes more rigid and better able to resist harsh environments. For example, the lipids in Ferroplasma are of this type, which is thought to aid this organism's survival in its highly acidic habitat.|$|E
5|$|In some {{bacteria}} and <b>archaea,</b> ATP synthesis {{is driven by}} the movement of sodium ions through the cell membrane, rather than the movement of protons. <b>Archaea</b> such as Methanococcus also contain the A1Ao synthase, a form of the enzyme that contains additional proteins with little similarity in sequence to other bacterial and eukaryotic ATP synthase subunits. It is possible that, in some species, the A1Ao form of the enzyme is a specialized sodium-driven ATP synthase, but this might not be true in all cases.|$|E
5|$|Nickel {{released}} from Siberian Traps volcanic eruptions {{is suspected of}} assisting the growth of Methanosarcina, a genus of euryarchaeote <b>archaea</b> that produced methane during the biggest extinction event on record.|$|E
5|$|Other {{groups of}} <b>archaea</b> use {{sunlight}} {{as a source}} of energy (they are phototrophs). However, oxygen–generating photosynthesis does not occur in any of these organisms. Many basic metabolic pathways are shared between all forms of life; for example, <b>archaea</b> use a modified form of glycolysis (the Entner–Doudoroff pathway) and either a complete or partial citric acid cycle. These similarities to other organisms probably reflect both early origins in the history of life and their high level of efficiency.|$|E
5|$|Rad54, Mre11, Rad50, and {{a number}} of other {{proteins}} are also found in both <b>archaea</b> and eukaryotes.|$|E
5|$|RecA {{recombinase}} {{family members}} are found in almost all organisms with RecA in bacteria, Rad51 and DMC1 in eukaryotes, RadA in <b>archaea,</b> and UvsX in T4 phage.|$|E
