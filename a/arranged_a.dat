40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} discover a model of assessment that could measure kinesthetic intelligence in <b>arranging</b> <b>a</b> dance from several related variable, both direct variable and indirect variable. The research method used was a qualitative method using path analysis to determine the direct and indirect variable; therefore, the dominant variable that supported the measurement model of kinesthetic intelligence in arranging dance could be discovered. The population used was the students {{of the art of}} dance department and were chosen by using purposive sampling technique so that the kinesthetic intelligence could be well measured. The result of this research was that the correlation between the ability in perceiving movement and the ability in conveying movement was 3. 8048. The correlation between the ability in perceiving movement and kinesthetic intelligence was 0. 3137. The correlation between the ability in perceiving movement and <b>arranging</b> <b>a</b> dance was - 0. 3751. The correlation between conveying movement and kinesthetic intelligence was 0. 1333. The correlation between conveying movement and <b>arranging</b> <b>a</b> dance was - 0. 2399. The correlation between kinesthetic intelligence and <b>arranging</b> <b>a</b> dance was 0. 8529. These result proved that kinesthetic intelligence has significant influence to the ability in <b>arranging</b> <b>a</b> dance. It could be concluded that a smart assessment model of kinesthetic intelligence in <b>arranging</b> <b>a</b> dance that was needed should measure the kinesthetic intelligence first while the ability to perceive and convey movement became the supporting element to strengthen the kinesthetic intelligence in <b>arranging</b> <b>a</b> dance. </p...|$|R

5|$|However, the {{rebellion}} of Justo José de Urquiza against Rosas in 1851, Rosas' defeat {{at the battle}} of Caseros and the resulting chaos delayed the move of San Martín's remains to Buenos Aires.

Buenos Aires seceded from Argentina as the state of Buenos Aires, dominated by Unitarians who despised San Martín. Thus, the move of his remains was postponed indefinitely. Aware that there were no favorable conditions for the project, Balcarce <b>arranged</b> <b>a</b> creation of a tomb in the Boulogne-sur-Mer cemetery.|$|E
