However, {{with the help of}} art director Nigel, who lends her designer clothes, she gradually learns her responsibilities and begins to dress more stylishly to show her effort and commitment to the position. She also meets an attractive young writer, Christian Thompson, who offers to help her with her career. As she spends increasing <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> at Miranda's beck and call, problems arise in her relationships with her college friends and her live-in boyfriend, Nate, a chef working his way up the career ladder.|$|E
5|$|The Mongol army {{administered}} the Yam. The Yam stretched across Mongol territory from Eastern Europe to the Pacific Ocean. The routes were well organised, funded, maintained, and administrated by the Mongols. This highly sophisticated system {{of communication and}} travel made it relatively easy to send important messages and travel long distances in relatively short <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>time.</b> As {{a result of the}} relatively lucid communication and ease of movement, the Mongols were able to govern their vast empire effectively, thus ensuring political and economic stability.|$|E

5|$|After {{her return}} to Japan, Hōshō was {{transferred}} to the Third Fleet, unofficially assigned to the training fleet (later called the Mobile Force Training Force), and officially assigned in October. She conducted flight training in the Inland Sea for aircraft that flew in from shore bases, since no aircraft were based on board Hōshō. On 15 January 1943, the 50th Air Flotilla was created for carrier aircrew training and both Hōshō and Ryūhō were assigned to the new unit. The two ships provided carrier landing training and served as target ships for torpedo training. In January 1944, Hōshō was reassigned to the 12th Air Fleet, then to the Combined Fleet, but continued to perform the same mission of training fleet carrier pilots in the Inland Sea. In this role, Hōshō shuttled back and forth between Kure and the Western Inland Sea, spending equal <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> at each location.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the exact}} number of French prisoners who escaped from captivity in Germany is unknown, it has been {{estimated}} at around 70,000, representing approximately five per cent of all French prisoners. The Vichy government did not encourage prisoners to escape, but many of its officials were sympathetic to escapees who reached French territory. Some prisoners, particularly those working in agriculture, spent substantial <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> without guards, and prisoners caught by the Germans trying to escape were rarely severely punished. During the period of detention in France, fines were sometimes imposed on locals for mass escapes of prisoners in the region. It was partially to prevent escapes that led to the German decision to deport prisoners to the Reich.|$|E
5|$|Behaviorally, domesticated pet rats are tamer {{than those}} in the wild. They are more {{comfortable}} around humans and known to seek out their owners while roaming freely. They have decreased reactions to light and sound, are less cautious of new food, and have better tolerance to overcrowding. Domesticated rats are shown to mate earlier, more readily, and {{for a longer period of}} time over their lifespan. Also, domesticated rats exhibit different behaviors when fighting with each other; while wild rats almost always flee a lost battle, caged rats spend protracted <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> in a belly-up or boxing position. These behavioral traits are thought to be products of environment as opposed to genetics. However, it is also theorized that there are certain underlying biological reasons for why some members of a wild species are more receptive to domestication than others, and that these differences are then passed down to offspring (compare Domesticated silver fox).|$|E

Instead, Tharoor became chairman of Dubai-based Afras Ventures, which established the Afras Academy for Business Communication (AABC) in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India, the city in which he would go on to win two parliamentary elections.

5|$|Speaking {{about the}} gameplay, Famitsu enjoyed the {{tactical}} gameplay and new elements, along with appreciating the thrill {{induced by the}} permanent death mechanic. A minor criticism was issues with the pacing. Harris enjoyed the gameplay despite noting that little had changed since the release of Fire Emblem, saying that players would not find any notable changes from their original experience. Chapman positively noted the improvements made since the release of Fire Emblem, along with positively noting the multiplayer options. Kasavin praised the deep strategy gameplay, and positively noted that it was geared towards players of various ages and skill levels. Foster called the gameplay the game's biggest feature and greatest strength despite not having changed much since the previous game. Knight enjoyed the gameplay experience, but was mixed to negative {{about the lack of}} true innovations, feeling that it was an overly similar experience to earlier Fire Emblem games. Bramwell enjoyed the gameplay despite getting frustrated at the permanent death mechanic, and positively noted the nuances in character customization. Parkin stated that it was quite easy to spend large <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> creating the perfect strategy, and that restarting a level after a character died or going to one of the EXP maps to boost character levels was extremely tempting. In the latter case, he noted it might upset the game's intended difficulty. Marrow enjoyed his time with the game, and praised the additional features that made playing easier for newcomers.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> homework assigned to sophomore and senior high school students of White Plains High School, White Plains, New York, during a typical school day, and to determine certain parent, teacher and student reactions and expectations relative to those assignments. The subject areas for which homework assignments were studied in detail, and upon which correlations were made, were English, mathematics, social studies, and science. Instruments, specifically developed to correlate responses from three different groups were completed by 159 parents of students involved in the study, 54 teachers of the four subject areas indicated above, 505 sophomores, and 408 seniors. Two hundred and eighteen student response sheets which were electronically rejected because of deviations in responding techniques, were hand scored to obtain responses to specific questions. All other response sheets were tabulated electronically. Because of an insufficient number of responses, data gathered from the parent instruments were not used for statistical analysis. Data obtained from the various instruments were applied to the chi-square test of independence to determine rejection of null hypotheses. In applying data obtained from questionnaires to the chisquare formula, eight hypotheses were rejected and five hypotheses were not rejected. There was insufficient data to allow application of this formula to one of the hypotheses; one hypothesis, therefore, remains untested. The hypotheses that were rejected are:There is no significant difference in the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> that English teachers think that it takes students to complete assignments and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> that students actually work on those assignments. There is no significant difference in the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> that mathematics teachers think that it takes students to complete assignments and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> that students actually work on those assignments. There is no significant difference in the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> spent on homework between college-bound and non college-bound students. There is no significant difference in the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> spent on homework between sophomore and senior populations. There is no significant difference in the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> spent on homework between boy and girl populations. There is no significant difference in the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> spent on homework in the subject of English between sophomore and senior populations. There is no significant difference in the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> spent on homework in the subject of mathematics between sophomore and senior populations. There is no significant difference in the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> spent on homework in the subject of science between sophomore and senior populations. The hypotheses that were not rejected are:There is no significant difference in the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> that social studies teachers think that it takes students to complete assignments and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> that students actually work on those assignments. There is no significant difference in the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> that homework is worked on in school between boy and girl populations. There is no significant difference in the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> that homework is worked on in school between sophomore and senior populations. There is no significant difference in the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> spent on homework in the subject area of social studies between sophomore and senior populations. The hypothesis that was not tested because of insufficient data is:There is no significant difference in the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> that science teachers think that it takes students to complete assignments and the <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> that students actually work on those assignments. In general, the data indicate that girls tend to spend more time on homework than boys, sophomores spend more time on homework than seniors, college-bound students spend more time on homework than non college-bound students, and that there is a disparity between the length <b>of</b> <b>time</b> that teachers think that it will take students to complete an assignment and the length <b>of</b> <b>time</b> that students work on those assignments.
