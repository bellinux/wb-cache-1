The Mk 1 CCS was built by Lockheed Martin, and gave the class the ability to fire Tomahawk missiles. The CSS internal tracker model provides processing for both towed array and spherical array trackers.

25|$|The P-8 {{features}} the Raytheon APY-10 multi-mission surface search radar; the P-8I features an international {{version of the}} APY-10. Unlike the preceding P-3, the P-8 lacks a magnetic anomaly detector (MAD) due to its higher operational altitude; its <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensor</b> system is reportedly more effective at acoustic tracking and thus lacking a MAD won't impede its detection capabilities; India's P-8I {{is equipped with a}} MAD per the contract request. Various sensor data are combined via data fusion software to track targets. Following the cancellation of Lockheed Martin's Aerial Common Sensor project, Boeing proposed a signals intelligence variant of the P-8 for the Navy's requirement. During the P-8A Increment 2 upgrade in 2016, the APS-149 Littoral Surveillance Radar System (LSRS) will be replaced by the Advanced Airborne Sensor radar.|$|E

Scott Burnett (1) demonstrated the feasibility of using <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensors</b> to locate an object without information about speed of sound. The algorithms of triangulation and pose measurement, which were introduced in his paper to fulfill the goal of using <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensors</b> to locate an object, are reviewed in this thesis. Moreover, some discussion on how to improve the algorithm's accuracy is also mentioned in this thesis. This work will attempt to improve the accuracy of using <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensors</b> to locate an object without information about speed of sound. A numerical method will be used to study the relationship between error and the location of sensors. To know how the location of sensors will affect the accuracy of the result, different sets of <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensors</b> will be modeled. With different combinations of <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensors,</b> we are looking to find the relationship between the accuracy of predicted transmitters' positions and the locations of <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensors...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The Helkir is an anti-helicopter mine {{developed}} by the Austrian company Hirtenberger. It uses an IR sensor and an <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensor</b> to detect airborne targets. Once the mine is armed and ready to engage, the <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensor</b> listens for a valid noise input. This enables the IR sensor which is located coaxially to the warhead. When the IR sensor detects a hot signature, the mine blasts off fragments that can penetrate up to 6 mm of armored steel at 50 meters and 2 mm of mild steel at 150 meters. The mine is active {{for a period of}} 1 to 120 days, after which it returns to a safe mode.|$|E

Passive hydrophones were used by the World War I Allies against German submarines; the UC-3, was sunk {{with the aid of}} hydrophone on 23 April 1916. Since submerged submarines cannot use radar, passive and active acoustic systems are their primary sensors. Especially for the passive sensors, the submarine <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensor</b> operators must have extensive libraries of acoustic signatures, to identify sources of sound.|$|E

Australia adopted the CLASSIC 2000 version, which, in turn, {{becomes part of the}} Australian Ninox system, which also includes Textron Systemsâ€™ Terrain Commander surveillance system. CLASSIC has two kinds of sensors: Optical Acoustic Satcom Integrated Sensor (OASIS) and Air Deliverable <b>Acoustic</b> <b>Sensor</b> (ADAS), as well as television cameras, thermal imagers, and low-light cameras.|$|E
50|$|An {{electromagnetic}} diaphragm {{is a form}} of {{capacitive sensor}} used on an electronic stethoscope. The diaphragm is coated with a conductive material. A conductive plate is positioned behind and parallel to the diaphragm, so that the two conductive elements form a capacitor. Capacitance is a function of plate area, dielectric properties of the space between the conductors, and the distance between the conductors. It is this latter parameter which is modulated by vibration such that the capacitance varies with the distance between the electromagnetic diaphragm and the plate, forming an <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensor.</b>|$|E

The SH-60F can carry Mk 46, Mk 50, or Mk 54 torpedoes for its offensive weapons, {{and it has a}} choice of fuselage-mounted machine guns, including the M60D, M240D, and GAU-16 (.50 caliber) for self-defense. The standard aircrew consists of one pilot, one co-pilot, one tactical sensor operator (TSO), and one <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensor</b> operator (ASO).|$|E
50|$|The {{systems were}} {{developed}} by the Bulgarian Institute of Metal Science, and are based around electronic fuzes with broadly similar functionality. The fuzes use two sensors. The first, an <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensor,</b> arms the mine as a helicopter approaches. The second sensor is a radar, which locates the target and triggers the mine at the appropriate point. The mines all use a number of large Misznay Schardin effect warheads to project large numbers of fragments to an effective range of around 200 meters. Jane's Mines and Mine Clearance speculates that IFF could {{be integrated into the}} fuze circuit to discriminate against friendly aircraft, lowering the chances of friendly fire.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Based on {{wind tunnel}} {{measurements}} at the CSTB (Jules Verne) facility in Nantes {{and based on}} field observations at the SLF experimental site Versuchsfeld Weissfluhjoch, two <b>acoustic</b> wind drift <b>sensors</b> are evaluated against different mechanical snow traps and one optical snow particle counter. The focus {{of the work is}} the suitability of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensors</b> for applications such as avalanche warning and research. Although the <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensors</b> have not yet reached the accuracy required for typical research applications, they can, however, be useful for snow drift monitoring to help avalanche forecasters. The main problem of the <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensors</b> is a difficult calibration that has {{to take into account the}} variable snow properties. Further difficulties arise from snow fall and high wind speeds. However, the sensor is robust and can be operated remotely under harsh conditions...|$|R
40|$|The growing {{need for}} {{real-time}} impact sensors for deployment on both space vehicles and space habitats (in orbit {{or on the}} surface of atmosphere-less bodies such as the Moon) has stimulated sensor development programmes. The sensors should be low mass, low power, easily read-out electronically, cover large areas and be sensitive to impacts which can cause damage up to and including penetration. We propose that piezo-strain <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensors</b> can {{play an important role in}} this work. Accordingly we report on a series of hypervelocity impact tests of <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensors</b> mounted on thin plates (aluminium and Duroid plates). The <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensors</b> gave strong signals for impacts of sub mmâ€“mm scale projectiles.

50|$|When {{influence}} mines {{are laid}} in an ocean minefield, {{they may have}} various combinations of fuze settings configured. For example, some mines (with the <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensor</b> enabled) may become active within three hours of being laid, others (with the acoustic and magnetic sensors enabled) may become active after two weeks but have the ship-counter mechanism set to ignore the first two trigger events, and still others in the same minefield (with the magnetic and pressure sensors enabled) may not become armed until three weeks have passed. Groups of mines within this mine-field may have different target signatures {{which may or may}} not overlap. The fuzes on influence mines allow many different permutations, which complicates the clearance process.|$|E

50|$|Closer to today's SR-emplaced sensors was the Mini-Seismic Intrusion Detector (MINISID). Unlike other sensors {{employed}} {{along the}} trail it was specifically designed to be hand delivered and implanted. The MINISID and its smaller version the MICROSID were personnel detection devices often used {{in combination with the}} magnetic intrusiondetector (MAGID). Combining sensors in this way improved the ability of individual sensors to detect targets and reduced false alarms. Today's AN/GSQ-187 Improved Remote Battlefield Sensor System (I-REMBASS) is a passive <b>acoustic</b> <b>sensor</b> which with other MASINT sensors detects vehicles and humans on a battlefield, multiple acoustic, seismic, and magnetic sensors combine modes to discriminate real targets. It will be routine for SR units both to emplace such sensors for regional monitoring by higher headquarters' remote sensing centers, but also as an improvement over tripwires and other improvised warnings for the patrol.|$|E
