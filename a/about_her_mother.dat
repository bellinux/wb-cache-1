25|$|The series {{continued}} with Scream 3, which received its premiere on February 3, 2000 at the AMC Avco theater in Westwood, California and was generally released on February 4, 2000. Like previous entries, {{the film was}} directed by Craven, but Williamson was unable to formulate a complete script due to {{his commitment to the}} short-lived television series Wasteland and his original film Teaching Mrs. Tingle (1999), being replaced by Ehren Kruger who finalized a script based on several ideas supplied by Williamson. The film focuses on Sidney Prescott who faces a new Ghostface killer and the truth <b>about</b> <b>her</b> <b>mother</b> that led {{to the start of the}} Ghostface killings. The film, like its predecessors, featured characters who were self-aware of horror conventions, in this case the rules and structure of the final entry in a movie trilogy.

Others were critical of the change in tone, focusing more on humor instead of horror and violence. However, critics who reacted positively were supportive of this change in tone and praised the film for successfully completing the film trilogy.|$|E
