40|$|We report {{here the}} results of {{molecular}} analysis of a simian immunodeficiency virus (designated SIVstm) which was isolated from a rhesus monkey inoculated with stored lymph node tissue of an Asian stump-tailed macaque. The latter monkey had died in 1977 during an epidemic of acquired immunodeficiency and lymphoma at the California Regional Primate Research Center (L. J. Lowenstine, N. W. Lerche, P. A. Marx, M. B. Gardner, and N. C. Pedersen, p. 174 - 176, in M. Girard and L. Valette, ed., Retroviruses of Human AIDS and Related Animal Viruses, 1988). Nucleotide sequence analysis of the gag and env regions indicates that SIVstm is an ancient member of the SIV/human immunodeficiency virus type 2 group; it is quite divergent from known SIVs isolated from <b>African</b> <b>sooty</b> mangabeys {{as well as from}} Asian macaques. Furthermore, of all SIV strains described to date, SIVstm is the most closely related to human immunodeficiency virus type 2...|$|R
40|$|Morphology of the dentofacial {{complex of}} early hominins has figured {{prominently}} in the inference of their dietary adaptations. Recent theoretical analysis of craniofacial morphology of Australopithecus africanus proposes that skull form in this taxon represents adaptation to feeding on large, hard objects. A modern analog for this specific dietary specialization {{is provided by the}} West <b>African</b> <b>sooty</b> mangabey, Cercocebus atys. This species habitually feeds on the large, exceptionally hard nuts of Sacoglottis gabonensis, stereotypically crushing the seed casings using their premolars and molars. This type of behavior has been inferred for A. africanus based on mathematical stress analysis and aspects of dental wear and morphology. While postcanine megadontia, premolar enlargement and thick molar enamel characterize both A. africanus and C. atys, these features are not universally associated with durophagy among living anthropoids. Occlusal microwear analysis reveals complex microwear textures in C. atys unlike those observed in A. africanus, but more closely resembling textures observed in Paranthropus robustus. Since sooty mangabeys process hard objects {{in a manner similar to}} that proposed for A. africanus, yet do so without the craniofacial buttressing characteristic of this hominin, it follows that derived features of the australopith skull are sufficient but not necessary for the consumption of large, hard objects. The adaptive significance of australopith craniofacial morphology may instead be related to the toughness, rather than the hardness, of ingested foods...|$|R
40|$|Differences in {{clinical}} outcome of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) infection in disease-resistant <b>African</b> <b>sooty</b> mangabeys (SM) and disease-susceptible Asian rhesus macaques (RM) prompted us {{to examine the}} role of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in these two animal models. Results from a cross-sectional study revealed maintenance of the frequency and absolute number of peripheral Tregs in chronically SIV-infected SM while a significant loss occurred in chronically SIV-infected RM compared to uninfected animals. A longitudinal study of experimentally SIV-infected animals revealed a transient increase {{in the frequency of}} Tregs from baseline values following acute infection in RM, but no change in the frequency of Tregs occurred in SM during this period. Further examination revealed a strong correlation between plasma viral load (VL) and the level of Tregs in SIV-infected RM but not SM. A correlation was also noted in SIV-infected RM that control VL spontaneously or in response to antiretroviral chemotherapy. In addition, immunofluorescent cell count assays showed that while Treg-depleted peripheral blood mononuclear cells from RM led to a significant enhancement of CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cell responses to select pools of SIV peptides, there was no detectable T-cell response to the same pool of SIV peptides in Treg-depleted cells from SIV-infected SM. Our data collectively suggest that while Tregs do appear {{to play a role in}} the control of viremia and the magnitude of the SIV-specific immune response in RM, their role in disease resistance in SM remains unclear...|$|R
40|$|In the 20 th century, {{thirteen}} distinct {{human immunodeficiency}} viruses emerged following independent cross-species transmission events involving simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) from African primates. In the late 1900 s, pathogenic SIV strains also {{emerged in the}} United Sates among captive Asian macaque species following their unintentional infection with SIV from <b>African</b> <b>sooty</b> mangabeys (SIVsmm). Since their discovery in the 1980 s, SIVs from rhesus macaques (SIVmac) and pig-tailed macaques (SIVmne) have become invaluable models for studying HIV pathogenesis, vaccine design {{and the emergence of}} viruses. SIV isolates from captive crab-eating macaques (SIVmfa) were initially described but lost prior to any detailed molecular and genetic characterization. In order to infer the origins of the lost SIVmfa lineage, we located archived material and colony records, recovered its genomic sequence by PCR, and assessed its phylogenetic relationship to other SIV strains. We conclude that SIVmfa is the product of two cross-species transmission events. The first was the established transmission of SIVsmm to rhesus macaques, which occurred at the California National Primate Research Center in the late 1960 s and the virus later emerged as SIVmac. In a second event, SIVmac was transmitted to crab-eating macaques, likely at the Laboratory for Experimental Medicine and Surgery in Primates in the early 1970 s, and it was later spread to the New England Primate Research Center colony in 1973 and eventually isolated in 1986. Our analysis suggests that SIVmac had already emerged by the early 1970 s and had begun to diverge into distinct lineages. Furthermore, our findings suggest that pathogenic SIV strains may have been more widely distributed than previously appreciated, raising the possibility that additional isolates may await discovery...|$|R
40|$|SIVSM is a {{lentivirus}} {{endemic to}} the West <b>African</b> <b>sooty</b> mangabey (Cercocebus atys). HIV- 2 and SIVMAC are zoonoses {{that resulted from}} SIVSM transmission to humans and Asian rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatto), respectively. Human leukemia cell lines, human {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} and CD 4 + T cells, were 4 to 50 -fold less permissive for SIVMAC and SIVSM than for HIV- 1. In contrast, SIVMAC transduction of human adherent cell lines was equivalent to that of HIV- 1. Consistent with adaptation to human cells, HIV- 2 was not restricted as potently as was SIVMAC. SIVMAC transduction of human blood cells was rescued up to the level of HIV- 1 by As 2 O 3, a compound that increases the infectivity of viruses in the context of TRIM 5 -mediated restriction. Nonetheless, efficient knockdown of TRIM 5 or cyclophilin A, a cytoplasmic factor that sometimes regulates TRIM 5 restriction activity, did not rescue SIVMAC tranduction of these cells. Substitution of HIV- 1 CA with the CA from SIVMAC rendered HIV- 1 poorly infectious for Jurkat T cells. The block occurred after completion of reverse transcription and the formation of 2 -LTR circles, but before establishment of the provirus. Heterokaryons resulting from fusion of permissive with restrictive cells exhibited the restrictive phenotype, indicating that SIV transduction of human blood cells is inefficient due to a dominant-acting restriction factor. These results demonstrate that the nucleus of human blood cells possesses a TRIM 5 -like restriction factor specific for the SIVMAC/SIVSM capsid and that, by extension, cross-species transmission of SIVSM to human cells necessitated adaptation of HIV- 2 to this restriction factor...|$|R
50|$|One of the {{obstacles}} to treatment of the human immunodeficiency virus is its high genetic variability. HIV {{can be divided into}} two major types, HIV type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV type 2 (HIV-2). HIV-1 is related to viruses found in chimpanzees and gorillas living in western Africa, while HIV-2 viruses are related to viruses found in the endangered west <b>African</b> primate <b>sooty</b> mangabey. HIV-1 viruses may be further divided into groups. The HIV-1 group M viruses predominate and are responsible for the AIDS pandemic. Group M can be further subdivided into subtypes based on genetic sequence data. Some of the subtypes are known to be more virulent or are resistant to different medications. Likewise, HIV-2 viruses are thought to be less virulent and transmissible than HIV-1 M group viruses, although HIV-2 is known to cause AIDS.|$|R
40|$|We {{report the}} {{complete}} nucleotide sequence {{of a human}} immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV- 2) isolate from Guinea-Bissau (HIV- 2 cAra 2). The genomic organization of HIV- 2 cAM 2 is identical {{to that of other}} H 1 V- 2 isolates but contains a stop codon in thepol gene. The deduced amino acid sequences of the viral proteins show variation of 20 % in the gag, pol and vpx regions, and 25 to 45 % in the tat, env and nef regions when compared to other isolates of HIV- 2. This is greater than the variation observed between isolates of HIV- 1. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) is the principal causative agent of AIDS in Central Africa, Europe and the Americas. Individual isolates {{have been shown to be}} highly divergent both in their nucleotide sequences and their biological properties, such as cell tropism and replication efficiency (Evans et al., 1987). Serological studies of West African patients with AIDS led to the discovery of a second human lentivirus named HIV- 2 (Clavel et al., 1986). HIV- 2 is morphologically identical to but serologically distinct from HIV- 1; antibodies to most HIV- 1 proteins do not cross-react with those of HIV- 2 (Clavel et al., 1986; Brun-Vezinet et al., 1987), whereas nucleic acid sequencing reveals identity which varies from approximately 60 ~ in the gag and pol regions to approximately 30 to 40 ~o in the env region (Guyader et al., 1987). HIV- 2 is closely related to primate lentiviruses which were first isolated from rhesus macaques (Daniel et al., 1985) but subsequently found to originate from <b>African</b> <b>sooty</b> mangabey monkeys (Fultz et al., 1986); these isolates are called simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV), SIVMA c for macaque isolates and SIVsMM for the sooty mangabey monkey isolates. Other lentivirus isolates from African green monkeys (Fukasawa et al., 1988) and African mandrills (Tsujimoto et al., 1989) in the wild appear to b...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Vpx is a virion-associated protein encoded by SIV SM, a {{lentivirus}} {{endemic to}} the West <b>African</b> <b>sooty</b> mangabey (Cercocebus atys). HIV- 2 and SIV MAC, zoonoses resulting from SIV SM transmission to humans or Asian rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), also encode Vpx. In myeloid cells, Vpx promotes reverse transcription and transduction by these viruses. This activity correlates with Vpx binding to DCAF 1 (VPRBP) and {{association with the}} DDB 1 /RBX 1 /CUL 4 A E 3 ubiquitin ligase complex. When delivered experimentally to myeloid cells using VSV G-pseudotyped virus-like particles (VLPs), Vpx promotes reverse transcription of retroviruses that do not normally encode Vpx. Results Here we show that Vpx has the extraordinary ability to completely rescue HIV- 1 transduction of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDCs) from the potent antiviral state established by prior treatment with exogenous type 1 interferon (IFN). The magnitude of rescue was up to 1, 000 -fold, depending on the blood donor, and was also observed after induction of endogenous IFN and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) by LPS, poly(I:C), or poly(dA:dT). The effect was relatively specific in that Vpx-associated suppression of soluble IFN-β production, of mRNA levels for ISGs, or of cell surface markers for MDDC differentiation, was not detected. Vpx did not rescue HIV- 2 or SIV MAC transduction from the antiviral state, even {{in the presence of}} SIV MAC or HIV- 2 VLPs bearing additional Vpx, or in the presence of HIV- 1 VLPs bearing all accessory genes. In contrast to the effect of Vpx on transduction of untreated MDDCs, HIV- 1 rescue from the antiviral state was not dependent upon Vpx interaction with DCAF 1 or on the presence of DCAF 1 within the MDDC target cells. Additionally, although Vpx increased the level of HIV- 1 reverse transcripts in MDDCs to the same extent whether or not MDDCs were treated with IFN or LPS, Vpx rescued a block specific to the antiviral state that occurred after HIV- 1 cDNA penetrated the nucleus. Conclusion Vpx provides a tool for the characterization of a potent, new HIV- 1 restriction activity, which acts in the nucleus of type 1 IFN-treated dendritic cells. </p...|$|R
40|$|TRIMCyps are anti-retroviral {{proteins}} that have arisen independently in New World and Old World primates. All TRIMCyps comprise a CypA domain fused to the tripartite domains of TRIM 5 a {{but they have}} distinct lentiviral specificities, conferring HIV- 1 restriction in New World owl monkeys and HIV- 2 restriction in Old World rhesus macaques. Here we provide evidence that Asian macaque TRIMCyps have acquired changes that switch restriction specificity between different lentiviral lineages, resulting in species-specific alleles that target different viruses. Structural, thermodynamic and viral restriction analysis suggests that a single mutation in the Cyp domain, R 69 H, occurred early in macaque TRIMCyp evolution, expanding restriction specificity to the lentiviral lineages found in <b>African</b> green monkeys, <b>sooty</b> mangabeys and chimpanzees. Subsequent mutations have enhanced restriction to particular viruses but {{at the cost of}} broad specificity. We reveal how specificity is altered by a scaffold mutation, E 143 K, that modifies surface electrostatics and propagates conformational changes into the active site. Our results suggest that lentiviruses may have been important pathogens in Asian macaque...|$|R
