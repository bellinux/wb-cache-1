5|$|Mahayana, writing elsewhere, sees Karman as {{undergoing}} {{an existential}} quest {{to establish his}} identity, seemingly finding an <b>answer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> PKI but ultimately becoming trapped by them. Mahayana indicates that a religious message is evident beginning with the novel's opening, in which Tohari provides a four-line quote from an old Javanese text regarding faith and becoming more explicit later on. He finds Karman's dealing with the raftsman Kastagethek while escaping from the government the most explicit expression of Tohari's intent; unlike Karman, Kastagethek is a devout yet simple man who is happy in his poverty, leading Karman to question his own views before ultimately finding his identity in Islam. Mahayana thus argued that Kubah was meant as dawah, or Islamic preaching, with its message that humans should recognise their status as creatures of God conveyed through characters' dialogue and actions.|$|E
5|$|Ros and Connie {{find the}} locker with the bomber's name and location, Grosvenor Square. An FSB sniper kills Crane, and at Connie's request, the bomb {{is sent to}} her, as {{she is the only}} person with the {{expertise}} to disarm it. Connie defuses the bomb, but by doing so a secondary countdown is initiated. She removes the nuclear material, but the bomb will still detonate. In her last words, Connie admits that she set up Lucas in Moscow eight years ago, which resulted in his imprisonment. Lucas and Ros then run to safety as the bomb detonates, killing Connie. With disaster averted, Lucas calls Harry, but receives no <b>answer.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> end, it is revealed Sarkisiian has him locked up in the boot of his car.|$|E
5|$|When {{seeking to}} explain this change in the {{complexity}} and style of castles, antiquarians found their <b>answer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Crusades. It seemed that the Crusaders had learned much about fortification from their conflicts with the Saracens and exposure to Byzantine architecture. There were legends {{such as that of}} Lalys– an architect from Palestine who reputedly went to Wales after the Crusades and greatly enhanced the castles in the south of the country– and it was assumed that great architects such as James of Saint George originated in the East. In the mid-20thcentury this view was cast into doubt. Legends were discredited, {{and in the case of}} James of Saint George it was proven that he came from Saint-Georges-d'Espéranche, in France. If the innovations in fortification had derived from the East, it would have been expected for their influence to be seen from 1100 onwards, immediately after the Christians were victorious in the First Crusade (1096–1099), rather than nearly 100years later. Remains of Roman structures in Western Europe were still standing in many places, some of which had flanking round-towers and entrances between two flanking towers.|$|E

The most popular <b>answer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> survey was worth $500, the second-most popular $250, and the third most popular $100.

25|$|From Biblical {{times to}} today, {{the most common}} form of prayer is to {{directly}} appeal to God to grant one's requests. This in many ways is the simplest form of prayer. Some have termed this the social approach to prayer. In this view, a person directly enters into God's rest, and asks for their needs to be fulfilled. God listens to the prayer, and may so or not choose to <b>answer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> way one asks of him. This is the primary approach to prayer found in the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament, most of the Church writings, and in rabbinic literature such as the Talmud.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{inhabitants of}} the island were Taíno. They were eradicated by European diseases throughout the island. A local hero is Hatuey, who fled from the Spanish in Hispaniola and raised a Taíno army to fight the Spanish in Cuba.

It is said that just before he died a Catholic priest tried to convert him so he would attain salvation; Hatuey asked the priest if Heaven was the place where the dead Spanish go. When he received an <b>answer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> affirmative he told the priest that he would rather go to Hell.|$|E

Agnes had offered two promissory notes for 100,000 pesos to each of them which would be honored by Maximilian's brother, Franz Joseph. While they were in her parlor Agnes revealed the plan to Palacios, who had told her earlier that he sympathized with the Emperor. Palacios was skeptical and said he would give her his <b>answer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning. Agnes agreed, believing he would go through with it.

25|$|It was in Mexico that Nancarrow did {{the work}} {{for which he is}} best known today. He had already written some music in the United States, but the extreme {{technical}} demands of his compositions required great proficiency in the performer, which resulted in there being only rare satisfactory performances. That situation did not improve in Mexico's musical environment. There being few musicians available who could perform his works, his need to find an alternative way of having his pieces performed became pressing. Taking a suggestion from Henry Cowell's book New Musical Resources, which he bought in New York in 1939, Nancarrow found the <b>answer</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> player piano, with its ability to produce extremely complex rhythmic patterns at a speed far beyond the abilities of humans.|$|E
25|$|Further entries of the subject, {{or middle}} entries, occur {{throughout}} the fugue. They must state the subject or answer {{at least once}} in its entirety, and may also be heard in combination with the countersubject(s) from the exposition, new countersubjects, free counterpoint, or any of these in combination. It is uncommon for the subject to enter alone in a single voice in the middle-entries as in the exposition; rather, it is usually heard with {{at least one of the}} countersubjects and/or other free contrapuntal accompaniments. Middle-entries tend to occur at pitches other than the initial. As shown in the typical structure above, these are often closely related keys such as the relative dominant and subdominant, although the key structure of fugues varies greatly. In the fugues of J. S. Bach, the first middle-entry occurs most often in the relative major or minor of the work's overall key, and is followed by an entry in the dominant of the relative major or minor when the fugue's subject requires a tonal <b>answer.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> fugues of earlier composers (notably Buxtehude and Pachelbel), middle entries in keys other than the tonic and dominant tend to be the exception, and non-modulation the norm. One of the famous examples of such non-modulating fugue occurs in Buxtehude's Praeludium (Fugue and Chaconne) in C, BuxWV 137.|$|E
