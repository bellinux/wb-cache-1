Beyoncé's rendition was included on the 2007 deluxe edition of her second studio album, B'Day. Beyoncé contributed to the writing and production processes, {{and it was one}} of the last tracks to be added to the album. She called the song [...] "a beautiful ballad" [...] and said, [...] "I've always loved [...] It gives you this emotion – I don't care who you <b>are,</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> feel it. And it meant a lot for me to do this." [...] While reviewing the deluxe edition of B'Day, Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine praised the song, saying that it [...] "sound downright subtle".|$|E
500|$|... "Kill the Lights" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. A review by The Sun described [...] "Kill the Lights" [...] as [...] "a brilliant disco banger", while Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that [...] "Kill the Lights" [...] {{was a great}} [...] "sleek and sexy" [...] song, {{that should have been}} on Blackout instead of Circus. Anna Dimond of TV Guide commented that [...] "Kill the Lights" [...] shows that [...] "even a pop star needs alone time. Especially with her special someone," [...] and Jam!'s Darryl Sterdan considered it as a [...] "futuristic and vaguely ominous dance-floor filler". John Murphy of musicOMH noted the song is [...] "seemingly an open letter to Spears' paparazzi photographer ex-boyfriend with lines like 'Mr Photographer, I think I'm ready for my close-up' and 'is that money in your pocket, or <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> pleased to see me'", while Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star compared it to [...] "Womanizer" [...] (2008), saying both have [...] "the same swaggering beat hits". Poppy Cosyns of The Sun considered [...] "Kill the Lights" [...] as [...] "a full-on bolshy tirade, attacking sleazy parasitic paps with a vocal performance reminiscent of leotard-era Madonna". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian gave the song a negative review, saying it [...] "attempts to raise the kind of ire found on 'Blackout', but falls flat." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1939, Universal Pictures {{approached}} West {{to star in}} a film opposite W. C. Fields. The {{studio was}} eager to duplicate the success of Destry Rides Again starring Marlene Dietrich and James Stewart with a comic vehicle starring West and Fields. Having left Paramount 18 months earlier {{and looking for a}} new film, West accepted the role of Flower Belle Lee in the film My Little Chickadee (1940). Despite the stars' intense mutual dislike, and Fields's very real drinking problems, and fights over the screenplay, My Little Chickadee was a box-office success, outgrossing Fields's previous film, You Can't Cheat an Honest Man (1939), and the later The Bank Dick (1940). Despite this, religious leaders condemned West as a negative role model, taking offense at lines such as [...] "Between two evils, I like to pick the one I haven't tried before," [...] and [...] "Is that a gun in your pocket, or <b>are</b> <b>you</b> <b>just</b> glad to see me?" ...|$|E

Over there were {{gigantic}} uplands I had never seen and trodden; and beyond were great plains and cities, and beyond that the sea, and so on, great spaces and multitudinous things all round about the world.

And in some amazing way this thought so took possession of me that the question seemed also to carry with it the still more startling collateral, what then did they matter to me?
