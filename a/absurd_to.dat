5|$|Favorinus {{argued that}} it was <b>absurd</b> <b>to</b> imagine that stars and planets would affect human bodies {{in the same way as}} they affect the tides, and equally absurd that small motions in the heavens cause large changes in people's fates. Sextus Empiricus {{argued that it}} was <b>absurd</b> <b>to</b> link human {{attributes}} with myths about the signs of the zodiac. Carneades argued that belief in fate denies free will and morality; that people born at different times can all die in the same accident or battle; and that contrary to uniform influences from the stars, tribes and cultures are all different.|$|E
5|$|While echoing {{criticism}} about {{the exclusion of}} lesbian concerns and the distortions contained in the broadcast, Browning went on to note that sexual freedom has {{always been part of}} the gay male agenda {{and that it would be}} <b>absurd</b> <b>to</b> pretend otherwise.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that in contrast to Cubist painters, Cubist sculptors did not create a new art of 'space-time'. Unlike a flat painting, high-relief sculpture from its volumetric nature could never be limited to a single view-point. Hence, as Peter Collins highlights, it is <b>absurd</b> <b>to</b> state that Cubist sculpture, like painting, was not limited to a single point of view.|$|E

25|$|When {{this process}} works, {{this type of}} {{neurosis}} may be considered a life-guiding gift from the unconscious, even though the personal journey forced upon the individual sometimes takes decades. This may seem <b>absurd</b> <b>to</b> someone looking at a neurosis from the attitude that it is always an illness that {{should not have to}} happen, expects the doctor to have a quick cure, and that fantasies are unreliable subjective experiences.|$|E
25|$|The {{courtesy}} campaign {{conducted by}} the STPB was meant to teach Singaporeans to be polite only to tourists {{for the benefit of}} the tourist industry. Then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew's had followed the courtesy campaigns by the STPB with 'interest and amusement: interest because most people were responsive to the campaign; amusement because no one protested that it was <b>absurd</b> <b>to</b> teach Singaporeans to be polite to tourists’.|$|E
25|$|As {{men have}} said often, {{it seemed as}} if there was in this war a God of Battles who held His mighty hand before the Americans. As I looked at Sergeant Quick wig-wagging there against the sky, I would not have given a tin tobacco-tag for his life. Escape for him seemed impossible. It seemed <b>absurd</b> <b>to</b> hope {{that he would not be}} hit; I only hoped that he would be hit just a little, in the arm, the shoulder, or the leg.|$|E

25|$|Canadians had {{expected}} that women would feel {{sympathetic to the}} war efforts, {{but the idea that}} they would contribute in such a physical way was <b>absurd</b> <b>to</b> most. Because of the support that women had shown {{from the beginning of the}} war, people began to see their value. In May 1918, a meeting was held to discuss the possible creation of the Canadian Women's Corps. In September, the motion was approved, but the project was pushed aside because the war's end was in sight.|$|E
25|$|Many Jewish {{scholars}} such as Rabbi Saadia Gaon, Rabbi Bahya ibn Paquda, and Rabbi Yehuda Halevi have elaborated on {{the issues}} of idolatry. One of the oft-cited discussions is the commentary of Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon (Maimonides) on idolatry. According to the Maimonidean interpretation, idolatry in itself is not a fundamental sin, but the grave sin is the belief that God can be corporeal. In the Jewish belief, the only image of God is man, one who lives and thinks; God has no visible shape, and it is <b>absurd</b> <b>to</b> make or worship images; instead man must worship the invisible God alone.|$|E
25|$|Steel, {{carbon fiber}} and glass among others are usually {{considered}} linear materials, while other {{materials such as}} rubber and soils are non-linear. However, {{this is not an}} absolute classification: if very small stresses or strains are applied to a non-linear material, the response will be linear, but if very high stress or strain is applied to a linear material, the linear theory will not be enough. For example, as the linear theory implies reversibility, it would be <b>absurd</b> <b>to</b> use the linear theory to describe the failure of a steel bridge under a high load; although steel is a linear material for most applications, it is not in such a case of catastrophic failure.|$|E

25|$|When Thorbjørn Jagland gave {{evidence}} in the case, he agreed with Stoltenberg {{that it was not}} necessarily wrong to 'advance' money for memberships, provided that the members in question reimbursed this fee later on. He did, however, tell the court that it was unacceptable to transfer money from AUF's main bank account to pay for membership fees. He also agreed, when pressed by the prosecutor, that membership numbers were too high when he was the leader. In his defense he stated that if AUF were to follow the law too rigidly, they would only have ended up with a quarter of the membership numbers that the Young Conservatives operated with. He said {{that it would have been}} <b>absurd</b> <b>to</b> follow the law to the letter.|$|E
25|$|On 2 November 2017, {{questions}} {{were raised by}} the Australian concerning the possibility that Liberal MP and Minister Josh Frydenberg could be a citizen of Hungary under a Hungarian law designed to prevent statelessness caused during World War II. The retrospective law provided that anyone who had been born within Hungary in the period 1941 to 1945 automatically became a Hungarian citizen, and citizenship in Hungary is passed down by birth right. As his mother was born in Hungary in 1943, an argument was raised that this meant Frydenberg held Hungarian citizenship. Frydenberg {{said that it was}} <b>absurd</b> <b>to</b> suggest he had involuntarily acquired Hungarian citizenship as, when his mother and other family members entered Australia in 1950, they were stateless survivors of the Holocaust. Prime Minister Turnbull and Attorney-General Brandis condemned the calls as witch hunts.|$|E
25|$|The {{more the}} {{internet}} is incorporated into daily life, the greater the impact it has on formal language. This {{is especially true in}} modern Language Arts classes through the use of smart phones, tablets, and social media. Students are exposed to the language of the internet more than ever, and as such, the grammatical structure and slang of the internet are bleeding into their formal writing. Full immersion into a language is always the best way to learn it. Mark Lester in his book Teaching Grammar and Usage states, “The biggest single problem that basic writers have in developing successful strategies for coping with errors is simply their lack of exposure to formal written English...We would think it <b>absurd</b> <b>to</b> expect a student to master a foreign language without extensive exposure to it.” Since students are immersed in internet language, that is the form and structure they are mirroring.|$|E
50|$|Guare's early plays, mostly comic one-acts exhibiting a {{flair for}} the <b>absurd,</b> include <b>To</b> Wally Pantoni, We Leave a Credenza, {{produced}} at Caffe Cino in 1965 and Muzeeka (1968).|$|R

25|$|Granting {{the strict}} logical {{consistency}} of post-Cantorian, axiomatized infinite set theory, Craig {{concludes that the}} existence of an actually infinite number of things is metaphysically impossible due to the consequential absurdities that arise. Craig illustrates this point using the example of Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel. In Hilbert's hypothetical fully occupied hotel with infinitely many rooms, one can add an additional guest in room #1 by moving the guest in room #1 to room #2, the guest in room #2 into room #3, the guest in room #3 into room #4 and continue the shifting of rooms out to infinity. Craig points out that it is <b>absurd</b> <b>to</b> add an additional guest to a fully occupied hotel and the absurd result that the hotel has the same number of guests, infinity, both before after adding the additional guest. Stating that the mathematical conventions stipulated to ensure the logical consistency of this type of transfinite arithmetic have no ontological force, Craig concludes that finitism is most plausibly true, which means that the series of past events in the universe must be finite, so it must have had a beginning.|$|E
500|$|Rodney Milnes, in The New Grove Dictionary of Opera (1992), {{agrees that}} Manon and Werther have a secure {{place in the}} {{international}} repertoire; he counts three others as [...] "re-establishing a toehold" [...] (Cendrillon, Thaïs and Don Quichotte), with many more due for re-evaluation or rediscovery. He concludes that comparing Massenet with the handful of composers of great genius, [...] "It would be <b>absurd</b> <b>to</b> claim that he was {{anything more than a}} second-rate composer; he nevertheless deserves to be seen, like Richard Strauss, at least as a first-class second-rate one." ...|$|E
500|$|... {{all came}} down to one {{sentence}} in the [...] "X" [...] article where I said that wherever these people, meaning the Soviet leadership, confronted us with dangerous hostility anywhere in the world, we should {{do everything possible to}} contain it and not let them expand any further. I should have explained that I didn't suspect them of any desire to launch an attack on us. This was right after the war, and it was <b>absurd</b> <b>to</b> suppose {{that they were going to}} turn around and attack the United States. I didn't think I needed to explain that, but I obviously should have done it.|$|E

500|$|Dissenting {{from the}} general tone of praise for Bewick, Jacob Kainen cites claims that [...] "many of the best tailpieces in the History of British birds were drawn by Robert Johnson", and that [...] "the greater number of those {{contained}} in the second volume were engraved by Clennell. Granted that the outlook and the engraving style were Bewick's, and that these were notable contributions, {{the fact that the}} results were so close to his own points more to an effective method of illustration than to the outpourings of genius." [...] Kainen argues that while competent, Bewick [...] "was no Holbein, no Botticelli—it is <b>absurd</b> <b>to</b> think of him in such terms—but he did develop a fresh method of handling wood engraving." ...|$|E
500|$|Hitchens first {{referred}} to The Rage Against God in August 2009, {{in one of}} his weekly columns: [...] "Above all, I seek to counter the assertion, central to my brother's case ... that the Soviet regime was in fact religious in character. This profound misunderstanding {{of the nature of the}} USSR is the key to finding another significant flaw in what is in general his circular argument". Then, a week before the book's publication, Hitchens wrote: [...] "...it is obvious much of what I say [...] arises out of my attempt to debate religion with him , it would be <b>absurd</b> <b>to</b> pretend that much of what I say here is not intended to counter or undermine arguments he presented in his book, God Is Not Great...".|$|E
500|$|In 1868 Gray had a year's {{leave of}} absence and visited Darwin in Englandthe first time they had met since they started their correspondence. Darwin had Gray {{in mind when he}} wrote, [...] "It seems to me <b>absurd</b> <b>to</b> doubt that a man may be an ardent theist & an evolutionist." [...] Darwin {{dedicated}} his 1877 book The Different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species to Gray [...] "as a small tribute of respect and affection". One area where Darwin and Gray disagreed was Darwin's theory of pangenesis. The Grays traveled to Europe again during 1880–1881, including a final visit to Down House, Darwin's home. He spent a year in Europe this time studying. Darwin died in 1882.|$|E
