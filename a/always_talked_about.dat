500|$|Musically, Love's {{work with}} Hole and her solo {{efforts have been}} {{characterized}} as alternative rock; Hole's early material, however, was described by critics as being stylistically closer to grindcore and aggressive punk rock. Spins October 1991 review of Hole's first album noted Love's layering of harsh and abrasive riffs buried more sophisticated musical arrangements. In 1998, Love stated that Hole had [...] "always been a pop band. We always had a subtext of pop. I <b>always</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> it, if you go back... what'll sound like some weird Sonic Youth tuning back then to you was sounding like the Raspberries to me, in my demented pop framework".|$|E
2500|$|Alvin Toffler {{was born}} on October 4, 1928, in New York City, and raised in Brooklyn. He {{was the son of}} Rose (Albaum) and Sam Toffler, a furrier, both Jewish {{immigrants}} from Poland. He had one younger sister. He was inspired to become a writer at the age of 7 by his aunt and uncle, who lived with the Tofflers. [...] "They were Depression-era literary intellectuals," [...] Toffler said, [...] "and they <b>always</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> exciting ideas." ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout his career, Cruyff became {{synonymous with}} the playing style of [...] "Total Football". It is a system where a player who moves out of his {{position}} is replaced by another from his team, thus allowing the team to retain their intended organizational structure. In this fluid system, no footballer is fixed in their intended outfield role. The style was honed by Ajax coach Rinus Michels, with Cruyff serving as the on-field [...] "conductor". Space {{and the creation of}} it were central to the concept of Total Football. Ajax defender Barry Hulshoff, who played with Cruyff, explained how the team that won the European Cup in 1971, 1972 and 1973 worked it to their advantage: [...] "We discussed space the whole time. Cruyff <b>always</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> where people should run, where they should stand, where they should not be moving. It was all about making space and coming into space. It is a kind of architecture on the field. We <b>always</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> speed of ball, space and time. Where is the most space? Where is the player who has the most time? That is where we have to play the ball. Every player had to understand the whole geometry of the whole pitch and the system as a whole." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Upvenue, Tobin Esperance said of Time for Annihilation that [...] "We put out five major label, full-length records, and we were transitioning from a major label, going independent, {{and we wanted to}} do something different [...] we'd <b>always</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> doing a live record, and it turned into 'let's add a couple of bonus songs' [...] and now it's half live, half new songs and it's kind of the past and present of Papa Roach, and I think it's a good representation and a good reminder of what this band's about, [...] and it gives you a look at where our sound can go." ...|$|E
2500|$|Parker later {{spoke of}} how his musical {{relationship}} with Canyons came to be: [...] "They used to run a label which Tame Impala used to sort of be on. We released a 12” vinyl with them once, on one side it had three Tame Impala songs {{and on the other}} it was the same three songs remixed by Canyons and that was really cool, it was a really casual relationship. We <b>always</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> releasing things but we never got round to it because I’d just go round to his house and talk about music for a while. So we never actually got anything pressed until we had signed with Modular and then we went back and did stuff with Canyons." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 16 March {{the escort}} in Via Fani was not {{carrying}} weapons, which were instead {{kept in the}} trunks of the cars; Eleonora Chiavarelli (Aldo Moro's wife) said, during the trial, that the weapons were in the trunks because [...] "these people didn't {{know how to use}} weapons because they never did shooting practice, they hadn't habit to handle them, so that the guns were in the trunk. Leonardi <b>always</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> it. [...] "These people shouldn't have weapons they don't know how to use. They should know how to use them. They should carry them properly. Keep them within reach. The radio should be operational, but it doesn't work." [...] For months it had been going on like this. Marshal Leonardi and lance corporal Ricci did not expect an ambush, because their weapons were placed in the bag and one of the two holsters was even in a plastic liner." [...] The last sentence was denied by the widow of Marshal Leonardi, stating that her husband [...] "recently went around armed because he had noticed that a car was following him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Night of the Living Drums, the band's fourth studio album, was {{initially}} set for release in June 2010, {{according to the}} band's official website. However it was pushed back for undisclosed reasons, then in December it was revealed the band had left Sony Music, after the label had refused to release the album. On 11 November 2011 Rogue Traders finally released Night of the Living Drums, after they had re-signed to Sony. It was released as part of The Sound of Drums which is a double album that includes a compilation disc, The Greatest Hits, and the studio recording, Night of the Living Drums. Ash described The Sound of Drums conception, [...] "he catalyst was when we realised we were coming up to the band's 10-year anniversary. We'd <b>always</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> how much fun {{it would be to}} do a greatest hits one day, and we struck on the idea of doing a record that combined the two. I have to give credit to Sony, because they changed their minds about us – we brought this idea back to them and they went for it".|$|E
2500|$|In {{regards to}} the {{possibility}} of a sequel, Vega has been quoted as saying: [...] "From the very, very beginning, we <b>always</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> a prequel or a sequel to this film. And it's hard, because as of right now, we all want to do it, but, you know, it didn't really do as we hoped. We didn't really have a lot of support. But we're hoping that the fans will come back, and it will be an underground cult classic that will grow, and that will eventually spark us to do another." [...] Bousman also indicated interest, stating; [...] "I would love to follow up Repo and finish the story, because it was conceived as a three-part movie. But this movie is all about support from the internet, and support from fans. This is not a movie where you'll see billboards or bus stop ads or trailers on TV." [...] It was additionally expected that Hilton would return in her role as Amber Sweet. However, in a video posted on YouTube, it was revealed that they [...] "no longer control {{the answer to the question}} [...] " [...] since they no longer have ownership of the franchise, thus driving Bousman and Zdunich to make The Devil's Carnival.|$|E

60|$|But {{this was}} not the only distant {{expedition}} they had made, for they had once gone down the Stour as far as Harwich with their father when he was called thither on business. To them Harwich with its old walls and the houses crowned up within them, and its busy port with vessels coming in and going out, was most delightful, and they <b>always</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> that expedition {{as one of the most}} pleasant recollections of their lives.|$|E
60|$|This was {{the only}} retort--except glass or crockery--that the heavy {{creature}} was capable of making; but, I became as highly incensed by {{it as if it}} had been barbed with wit, and I immediately rose in my place and said that I could not but regard it as being like the honorable Finch's impudence to come down to that Grove,--we <b>always</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> coming down to that Grove, as a neat Parliamentary turn of expression,--down to that Grove, proposing a lady of whom he knew nothing. Mr. Drummle, upon this, starting up, demanded what I meant by that? Whereupon I made him the extreme reply that I believed he knew where I was to be found.|$|E
6000|$|Fanny, who {{had seen}} all of Mary's love affair from the {{beginning}} to the end, and who had watched the Reverend Edward Fielding in all his very conspicuous manoeuvres, would not agree to this. Edward Fielding from the first moment of his intimate acquaintance with Mary had left no doubt of his intentions on the mind of any one. He had talked to Mary and walked with Mary whenever, he was allowed or found it possible to do so. When driven to talk to Fanny, he had <b>always</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> Mary. He had been a lover of the good, old, plainspoken stamp, about whom there had been no mistake. From the first moment of his coming much about Clavering Rectory the only question had been about his income. [...] "I don't think Mr. Saul ever said a word to me except about the poor people and the church services," [...] said Fanny. [...] "That was merely his way," [...] said Mrs. Clavering. [...] "Then he must be a goose," [...] said Fanny. [...] "I am very sorry if I have made him unhappy, but he had no business to come to me in that way." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Little Alma lived {{close to}} the River Yí, but far, far from here, beyond the trees and beyond the blue hills, for the Yí is a very long river. She lived with her {{grandmother}} and with six uncles, all big tall men with long beards; and they <b>always</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> wars, and cattle, and horse-racing, and a great many other important things that Alma could not understand. There {{was no one to}} talk to Alma and for Alma to talk to or to play with. And when she went out of the house where all the big people were talking, she heard the cocks crowing, the dogs barking, the birds singing, the sheep bleating, and the trees rustling their leaves over her head, and she could not understand one word of all they said. At last, having no one to play with or talk to, she sat down and began to cry. Now, it happened that near the spot where she sat there was an old black woman wearing a red shawl, who was gathering sticks for the fire, and she asked Alma why she cried.|$|E
60|$|Two Cases of Conscience.--"The curé {{said that}} unhappy lovers <b>always</b> <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> dying, {{but that it}} was very rare to find one who kept his word; still he had seen one case. It was that of a young man of family, called Soulpse. He {{fell in love with a}} young lady of beauty and of good character, but without money, and {{belonging}} to a dishonoured family. Her father was in the galleys for forgery. The young man, who foresaw all the opposition, and all the good grounds for opposition, that he would have to encounter among his family, did all that he could to cure himself of his passion; but when he was assured of the uselessness of his efforts, he plucked up courage to open the matter to his parents, who wearied themselves with remonstrances. Our lover suddenly stopped them short, saying, 'I know all that you have to say against me; I cannot disapprove of your reasons, which I should be the first to urge against my own son, if I had one. But consider whether you would rather have me dead or badly married; for it is certain that if I do not marry the woman that I love, I shall die of it.' They treated this speech as it deserved; the result does not affect that. The young man fell sick, faded from day to day, and died. 'But, Curé,' said I, 'in the place of the father, what would you have done?' 'I would have called my son; I would have said: Soulpse has been your name hitherto; never forget that it is yours no more; and call yourself by what other name you please. Here is your lawful share of our property; marry the woman you love, so far from here that I may never hear speak of you again, and God bless you. 'For my part,' said old Madame D'Esclavelles, 'if I had been the mother of the young madman, I would have done exactly as his father did, and let him die.' And upon this there was a tremendous division of opinion, and an uproar that made the room ring again.|$|E
