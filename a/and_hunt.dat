5|$|Banded sea kraits are semiaquatic. Juveniles stay {{in water}} and on {{adjacent}} coast, but adults are able to move further inland and spend half their time on land and half in the ocean. Adult males are more terrestrially active during mating <b>and</b> <b>hunt</b> in shallower water, requiring more terrestrial locomotive ability. On the other hand, adult females are less active on land during mating <b>and</b> <b>hunt</b> in deeper water, requiring more aquatic locomotive ability. Because males are smaller, they crawl and swim faster than females.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) is {{fearful that}} she will be cut from the hospital's staff, so she tries to get her name on the {{surgical}} board. Stevens <b>and</b> <b>Hunt</b> operate on Randy, and it is revealed that he is terminal. Lexie wants to donate her liver to Thatcher, but she is not a viable candidate, so she asks Meredith to do it, who subsequently agrees. Randy and his wife are dismayed with the outcome of the surgery, and Stevens proposes a plan to Hunt on how they can save him. Hunt agrees, but when the surgery suffers complications, the patient is pronounced dead, <b>and</b> <b>Hunt</b> condemns Stevens. Meredith undergoes the surgery, and it is a success for both her and Thatcher. Yang confronts Webber, and tells him that if a cardiothoracic surgeon is not hired, she should be cut from the program. At the conclusion of the episode, Stevens sees the bear, and ultimately agrees that she and Karev need to relocate, out of the forest.|$|E

5|$|Whether a Native American tribe was {{friendly}} or warlike {{was critical to}} the fates of European explorers and settlers in that land.

5|$|The {{young are}} covered with a grayish down until they are almost as large as their parents. They are able to fly after six months, but {{continue}} to roost <b>and</b> <b>hunt</b> with their parents until age two, when they are displaced by a new clutch. Healthy adults have no natural predators, but large birds of prey and mammalian predators, like foxes, may take eggs or hatchlings. Predation is relatively uncommon, since the vigilant parents often aggressively displace birds of prey who come near and the rocky, precipitous location of most nests are difficult for mammals to access.|$|E
5|$|All {{species are}} predators and scavengers. Iridomyrmex ants tend to many Hemiptera insects and {{butterfly}} larvae to receive honeydew. Workers forage and scavenge for small insects, and they collect nectar from flowers <b>and</b> <b>hunt</b> for prey. Iridomyrmex ants normally forage on the ground, but most species will forage up into trees and vegetation {{to look for}} food. Most ants are diurnal foragers, but some are nocturnal. These nocturnal ants will sometimes become active during the day, but this depends on the suitability of the weather. They will also block their entrance holes when it is daytime; however, I. bigi is nocturnal and never comes out during the day. In a few species, a nest will not {{be placed in a}} shaded area; this is so it can warm up during the early mornings and workers can forage shortly after sunrise.|$|E

5|$|Amanda {{encounters}} several antagonists {{over the}} course of the game, including hostile humans and androids. These foes can be defeated with gunplay or other offensive means. There is also a single alien creature that pursues the player. The alien creature cannot be defeated, requiring the player to use stealth tactics in order to survive. Instead of following a predetermined path, the alien has the ability to actively investigate disturbances <b>and</b> <b>hunt</b> the player by sight or sound. Along the way, the player can use both a flashlight and a motion tracker to detect the alien's movements. However, using any of these increases the chance of the alien finding the player. For example, if the alien is moving and close enough, the tracker's sound will attract the alien, forcing the player to wisely use the tracker and remove it as soon as it detects motion. The motion tracker cannot detect enemies when they are not moving and cannot determine whether the alien creature is up in the ducts or on ground level.|$|E
5|$|At Devil's Gate {{the rescue}} party {{unloaded}} the baggage {{carried in the}} wagons of the Hodgett <b>and</b> <b>Hunt</b> wagon companies that had been following the Martin Company so the wagons {{could be used to}} transport the weakest emigrants. A small group led by Daniel Webster Jones remained at Devil's Gate over the winter to protect the property. On November 4 the company had to cross the Sweetwater River, which was about 2 feet (0.6 m) deep and 90 to 120 feet (27 to 37 m) wide. The stream was clogged with floating ice. Some of the men of the rescue party spent hours pulling the carts and carrying many of the emigrants across the river. However, many members of the company crossed the river themselves, some even pulling their own handcarts across. The severe weather forced the Martin Company to halt for another five days at Martin's Cove, a few miles west of Devil's Gate.|$|E
5|$|Broccoli <b>and</b> <b>Hunt</b> {{eventually}} chose Lazenby {{after seeing}} {{him in a}} Fry's Chocolate Cream advertisement.

Broccoli noticed Lazenby as a Bond-type man based on his physique and character elements, and offered him an audition. The position was consolidated when Lazenby accidentally punched a professional wrestler, who was acting as stunt coordinator, in the face, impressing Broccoli with his ability to display aggression. Lazenby was offered a contract for seven films; however, he was convinced by his agent Ronan O'Rahilly that the secret agent would be archaic in the liberated 1970s, {{and as a result}} he left the series after the release of On Her Majesty's Secret Service in 1969.|$|E
