5|$|While most mollusc shells are {{composed}} mainly of <b>aragonite,</b> those gastropods that lay eggs {{with a hard}} shell use calcite (sometimes with traces of <b>aragonite)</b> to construct the eggshells.|$|E
5|$|The {{shell is}} {{composed}} of two calcareous valves held together by a ligament. The valves are made of either calcite, {{as is the case}} in oysters, or both calcite and <b>aragonite.</b> Sometimes, the <b>aragonite</b> forms an inner, nacreous layer, {{as is the case in}} the order Pterioida. In other taxa, alternate layers of calcite and <b>aragonite</b> are laid down. The ligament and byssus, if calcified, are composed of <b>aragonite.</b> The outermost layer of the shell is the periostracum, a skin-like layer which {{is composed of}} a conchiolin. The periostracum is secreted in the groove between the outer and middle layers of the mantle, and is usually olive or brown in colour and easily abraded. The outer surface of the valves is often sculpted, with clams often having concentric striations, scallops having radial ribs and oysters a latticework of irregular markings.|$|E
5|$|The scleractinian corals {{filled the}} niche vacated by the extinct rugose and {{tabulate}} species. Their fossils {{may be found}} in small numbers in rocks from the Triassic period, and became common in the Jurassic and later periods. Scleractinian skeletons are composed of a form of calcium carbonate known as <b>aragonite.</b> Although they are geologically younger than the tabulate and rugose corals, the <b>aragonite</b> of their skeletons is less readily preserved, and their fossil record is accordingly less complete.|$|E
5|$|Corals are shallow, colonial {{organisms that}} {{integrate}} δ18O and trace elements into their skeletal <b>aragonite</b> (polymorph of calcite) crystalline structures, as they grow. Geochemistry anomalies within the crystalline structures of corals represent functions of temperature, salinity and oxygen isotopic composition. Such geochemical analysis {{can help with}} climate modeling.|$|E
5|$|Most Demospongiae have {{silicate}} spicules or spongin fibers or {{both within}} their soft tissues. However a few also have massive external skeletons made of <b>aragonite,</b> {{another form of}} calcium carbonate. All the cells have a single nucleus and membrane.|$|E
5|$|All modern scleractinian skeletons are {{composed}} of calcium carbonate {{in the form of}} crystals of <b>aragonite,</b> however, a prehistoric scleractinian (Coelosimilia) had a non-aragonite skeletal structure which was composed of calcite. The structure of both simple and compound scleractinians is light and porous, rather than solid {{as is the case in}} the prehistoric order Rugosa. Scleractinians are also distinguished from rugosans by their pattern of septal insertion.|$|E
5|$|The {{molluscan}} shell {{appears to}} have originated from a mucus coating, which eventually stiffened into a cuticle. This would have been impermeable and thus forced {{the development of more}} sophisticated respiratory apparatus in the form of gills. Eventually, the cuticle would have become mineralized, using the same genetic machinery (engrailed) as most other bilaterian skeletons. The first mollusc shell almost certainly was reinforced with the mineral <b>aragonite.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like other elements, {{a variety}} of {{processes}} alter the relative abundance of calcium isotopes. The best studied of these processes is the mass-dependent fractionation of calcium isotopes that accompanies the precipitation of calcium minerals such as calcite, <b>aragonite</b> and apatite from solution. Lighter isotopes are preferentially incorporated into these minerals, leaving the surrounding solution enriched in heavier isotopes at a magnitude of roughly 0.025% per atomic mass unit (amu) at room temperature. Mass-dependent differences in calcium isotope composition are conventionally expressed by the ratio of two isotopes (usually 44Ca/40Ca) in a sample compared to the same ratio in a standard reference material. 44Ca/40Ca varies by about 1% among common earth materials.|$|E
25|$|The {{fluid in}} the {{internal}} compartments where corals grow their exoskeleton is also extremely important for calcification growth. When the saturation rate of <b>aragonite</b> in the external seawater is at ambient levels, the corals will grow their <b>aragonite</b> crystals rapidly in their internal compartments, hence their exoskeleton grows rapidly. If the level of <b>aragonite</b> in the external seawater {{is lower than the}} ambient level, the corals have to work harder to maintain the right balance {{in the internal}} compartment. When that happens, the process of growing the crystals slows down, and this slows down the rate of how much their exoskeleton is growing. Depending on how much <b>aragonite</b> is in the surrounding water, the corals may even stop growing because the levels of <b>aragonite</b> are too low to pump into the internal compartment. They could even dissolve faster than they can make the crystals to their skeleton, depending on the <b>aragonite</b> levels in the surrounding water.|$|E
25|$|<b>Aragonite</b> {{scaffolds}} {{have recently}} been shown to support the growth of neurons from rat hippocampi. Shany et al. (2006) proved that <b>aragonite</b> matrices can support the growth of astrocytic networks in vitro and in vivo. Thus, <b>aragonite</b> scaffolds may be useful for nerve tissue repair and regeneration. It is hypothesized that aragonite-derived Ca2+ is essential for promoting cell adherence and cell–cell contact. This is probably carried out through the help of Ca2+-dependent adhesion molecules such as cadherins. <b>Aragonite</b> crystalline matrices have many advantages over hydrogels. They have larger pores, which allows for better cell growth, and the material is bioactive {{as a result of}} releasing Ca2+, which promotes cell adhesion and survival. In addition, the <b>aragonite</b> matrices have higher mechanical strength than hydrogels, allowing them to withstand more pressure when pressed into an injured tissue.|$|E
25|$|In {{conventional}} cell culture, {{growth is}} restricted to one plane, causing monolayer formation with most cells contacting the surface; however, the 3D curvature of the <b>aragonite</b> surface allows multiple layers to develop and for astrocytes far apart to contact each other. It is important to promote process formation similar to 3D in vivo conditions, because astrocytic process morphology is essential in guiding directionality of regenerating axons. The <b>aragonite</b> topography provides a high surface {{area to volume ratio}} and lacks edges, which leads to a reduction of the culture edge effect. Crystalline matrices such as the <b>aragonite</b> mentioned here are allowed for the promotion of a complex 3D tissue formation that approaches in vivo conditions.|$|E
25|$|An adult shell {{consist of}} <b>aragonite</b> and {{sometimes}} {{there is also}} under 1.5% of vaterite especially near {{the margin of the}} shell.|$|E
25|$|Calcite, <b>aragonite</b> and vaterite {{are pure}} calcium {{carbonate}} minerals. Industrially important source rocks which are predominantly calcium carbonate include limestone, chalk, marble and travertine.|$|E
25|$|Ocean {{chemistry}} {{may also}} control which mineral shells are constructed of. Calcium carbonate has two forms, the stable calcite, and the metastable <b>aragonite,</b> which is stable {{within a reasonable}} range of chemical environments but rapidly becomes unstable outside this range. When the oceans contain a relatively high proportion of magnesium compared to calcium, <b>aragonite</b> is more stable, but as the magnesium concentration drops, it becomes less stable, hence harder to incorporate into an exoskeleton, as it will tend to dissolve.|$|E
25|$|Many {{living organisms}} {{are able to}} produce crystals, for example calcite and <b>aragonite</b> {{in the case of}} most {{molluscs}} or hydroxylapatite in the case of vertebrates.|$|E
25|$|Equilibria {{are defined}} for {{specific}} crystal phases. Therefore, the solubility product {{is expected to}} be different depending on the phase of the solid. For example, <b>aragonite</b> and calcite will have different solubility products even though they have both the same chemical identity (calcium carbonate). Under any given conditions one phase will be thermodynamically more stable than the other; therefore, this phase will form when thermodynamic equilibrium is established. However, kinetic factors may favor the formation the unfavorable precipitate (e.g. <b>aragonite),</b> which is then said to be in a metastable state.|$|E
25|$|Carbonate {{is found}} {{frequently}} in geologic settings and constitute an enormous carbon reservoir. Calcium carbonate occurs as <b>aragonite,</b> calcite and dolomite. The carbonate minerals form the rock types: limestone, chalk, marble, travertine, tufa, and others.|$|E
25|$|Solubility {{is defined}} for {{specific}} phases. For example, the solubility of <b>aragonite</b> and calcite in water {{are expected to}} differ, {{even though they are}} both polymorphs of calcium carbonate and have the same chemical formula.|$|E
25|$|The {{carbonate}} minerals {{are those}} were the main anionic group is carbonate, 2−. Carbonates tend to be brittle, many have rhombohedral cleavage, and all react with acid. Due to the last characteristic, field geologists often carry dilute hydrochloric acid to distinguish carbonates from non-carbonates. The reaction of acid with carbonates, most commonly found as the polymorph calcite and <b>aragonite</b> (CaCO3), relates to the dissolution and precipitation of the mineral, which is a key {{in the formation of}} limestone caves, features within them such as stalactite and stalagmites, and karst landforms. Carbonates are most often formed as biogenic or chemical sediments in marine environments. The carbonate group is structurally a triangle, where a central C4+ cation is surrounded by three O2− anions; different groups of minerals form from different arrangements of these triangles. The most common carbonate mineral is calcite, and is the primary constituent of sedimentary limestone and metamorphic marble. Calcite, CaCO3, can have a high magnesium impurity; under high-Mg conditions, its polymorph <b>aragonite</b> will form instead; the marine geochemistry in this regard can be described as an <b>aragonite</b> or calcite sea, depending on which mineral preferentially forms. Dolomite is a double carbonate, with the formula CaMg(CO3)2. Secondary dolomitization of limestone is common, where calcite or <b>aragonite</b> are converted to dolomite; this reaction increases pore space (the unit cell volume of dolomite is 88% that of calcite), which can create a reservoir for oil and gas. These two minerals species are members of eponymous mineral groups: the calcite group includes carbonates with the general formula XCO3, and the dolomite group constitutes minerals with general formula XY(CO3)2.|$|E
25|$|A {{high quality}} {{turquoise}} promoted as Bisbee Blue was {{a by-product of}} the copper mining. Many high-quality mineral specimens have come from Bisbee area mines and {{are to be found}} in museum collections worldwide. Some of these minerals include cuprite, <b>aragonite,</b> wulfenite, malachite, azurite, and galena.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of ammonoid specimens, {{especially those of}} the Paleozoic era, are preserved only as internal molds; the outer shell (composed of <b>aragonite)</b> has been lost during the fossilization process. Only in these internal-mold specimens can the suture lines be observed; in life, the sutures would have been hidden by the outer shell.|$|E
25|$|These white {{calcareous}} {{tubes are}} made of both calcite and <b>aragonite.</b> They are usually smooth with faint longitudinal ridges, curved but not strongly coiled, and are rarely more than 12cm in length. The tube appears to be shaped by the ventral shields and by a collar which is just behind the head.|$|E
25|$|Species of the clade Thecosomata {{produce a}} fragile {{external}} calcium carbonate shell, which {{could serve as}} a ballast enabling large vertical migrations and as a protection against predators. The aragonitic composition of the shell makes it very sensitive to dissolution. <b>Aragonite</b> is a metastable form of calcium carbonate and it is more soluble in seawater than calcite. Because of its highly soluble <b>aragonite</b> shell and polar distribution, Limacina helicina {{may be one of the}} first organisms affected by ocean acidification, and it is therefore a key indicator species of this process. As a key indicator of the acidification process, and a major component of polar ecosystems, Limacina helicina has become a focus for acidification research. Based on labolatory experiments, they are able to precipitate calcium carbonate at low <b>aragonite</b> saturation state. Limacina helicina seems to be relatively more resilient to elevated concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) than other aragonitic organisms such as corals. Labolatory experiments results support the current concern for the future of Arctic pteropods, as the production of their shell appears to be very sensitive to decreased pH. A decline of pteropod populations would likely cause dramatic changes to various pelagic ecosystems. Shelled pteropods also play a geochemical role in carbon cycle in the oceans, as they contribute to the export of calcium carbonate and can represent a major component of the carbon transport to the deep ocean.|$|E
25|$|The ammonites {{that form}} ammolite {{inhabited}} a prehistoric, inland subtropical sea that bordered the Rocky Mountains—this area is {{known today as}} the Cretaceous or Western Interior Seaway. As the ammonites died, they sank {{to the bottom and}} were buried by layers of bentonitic mud that eventually became shale. Many gem-quality ammonites are found within siderite concretions. These sediments preserved the <b>aragonite</b> of the shells, preventing it from converting to calcite.|$|E
25|$|Replacement {{occurs when}} the shell, bone or other tissue is {{replaced}} with another mineral. In some cases mineral replacement of the original shell occurs so gradually and at such fine scales that microstructural features are preserved despite the total loss of original material. A shell {{is said to be}} recrystallized when the original skeletal compounds are still present but in a different crystal form, as from <b>aragonite</b> to calcite.|$|E
25|$|Finfish (class Osteichthyes) {{have three}} pairs of {{otoliths}} – the sagittae (singular sagitta), lapilli (singular lapillus), and asterisci (singular asteriscus). The sagittae are largest, found just behind the eyes and approximately level with them vertically. The lapilli and asterisci (smallest of the three) are located within the semicircular canals. The sagittae are normally composed of <b>aragonite</b> (although vaterite abnormalities can occur), as are the lapilli, while the asterisci are normally composed of vaterite.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the largest}} changes are {{expected}} in the future, a report from NOAA scientists found large quantities of water undersaturated in <b>aragonite</b> are already upwelling close to the Pacific continental shelf area of North America. Continental shelves {{play an important role}} in marine ecosystems since most marine organisms live or are spawned there, and though the study only dealt with the area from Vancouver to Northern California, the authors suggest that other shelf areas may be experiencing similar effects.|$|E
25|$|As {{the name}} implies, {{the bulk of}} coral reefs {{is made up of}} coral skeletons from mostly intact coral colonies. As other {{chemical}} elements present in corals become incorporated into the calcium carbonate deposits, <b>aragonite</b> is formed. However, shell fragments and the remains of calcareous algae such as the green-segmented genus Halimeda can add to the reef's ability to withstand damage from storms and other threats. Such mixtures are visible in structures such as Eniwetok Atoll.|$|E
25|$|Slovakia has {{hundreds}} of caves and caverns under its mountains, of which 30 {{are open to}} the public. Most of the caves have stalagmites rising from the ground and stalactites hanging from above. There are currently five Slovak caves under UNESCO's World Heritage Site status. They are Dobšinská Ice Cave, Domica, Gombasek Cave, Jasovská Cave and Ochtinská <b>Aragonite</b> Cave. Other caves open to the public include Belianska Cave, Demänovská Cave of Liberty, Demänovská Ice Cave or Bystrianska Cave.|$|E
25|$|The {{chemical}} composition of ammolite is variable, and aside from <b>aragonite</b> may include calcite, silica, pyrite, or other minerals. The shell itself may contain {{a number of}} trace elements, including: aluminium; barium; chromium; copper; iron; magnesium; manganese; strontium; titanium; and vanadium. Its crystallography is orthorhombic. Its hardness is 4.5–5.5, and its specific gravity is 2.60–2.85. The refractive index of Canadian material (as measured via sodium light, 589.3nm) is as follows: α 1.522; β 1.672–1.673; γ 1.676–1.679; biaxial negative. Under ultraviolet light, ammolite may fluoresce a mustard yellow.|$|E
25|$|Calcium {{carbonate}} is {{a chemical}} compound with the formula CaCO3. It {{is a common}} substance found in rocks as the minerals calcite and <b>aragonite</b> (most notably as limestone, which contains both of those minerals) and is {{the main component of}} pearls and the shells of marine organisms, snails, and eggs. Calcium carbonate is the active ingredient in agricultural lime and is created when calcium ions in hard water react with carbonate ions to create limescale. It is medicinally used as a calcium supplement or as an antacid, but excessive consumption can be hazardous.|$|E
25|$|Joseph Kohlbeck {{from the}} Hercules Aerospace Company in Utah and Richard Levi-Setti of the Enrico Fermi Institute {{examined}} some dirt particles from the Shroud surface. The dirt {{was found to}} be travertine <b>aragonite</b> limestone. Using a high-resolution microprobe, Levi-Setti and Kolbeck compared the spectra of samples taken from the Shroud with samples of limestone from ancient Jerusalem tombs. The chemical signatures of the Shroud samples and the tomb limestone were found identical except for minute fragments of cellulose linen fiber that could not be separated from the Shroud samples.|$|E
25|$|Ammolite is an opal-like organic {{gemstone}} found primarily {{along the}} eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains of North America. It is made of the fossilized shells of ammonites, which in turn are composed primarily of <b>aragonite,</b> the same mineral contained in nacre, with a microstructure inherited from the shell. It is one of few biogenic gemstones; others include amber and pearl.1 In 1981, ammolite was given official gemstone status by the World Jewellery Confederation (CIBJO), the same year commercial mining of ammolite began. It was designated the official gemstone of the City of Lethbridge, Alberta in 2007.|$|E
25|$|Cuttlefish {{possess an}} {{internal}} structure called the cuttlebone, which is porous and {{is made of}} <b>aragonite.</b> The pores provide it with buoyancy, which the cuttlefish regulates by changing the gas-to-liquid ratio in the chambered cuttlebone via the ventral siphuncle. Each species' cuttlebone has a distinct shape, size, and pattern of ridges or texture. The cuttlebone is unique to cuttlefish, {{and is one of}} the features that distinguish them from their squid relatives. Jewellers and silversmiths traditionally use cuttlebones as moulds for casting small objects, but they are probably better known as the tough material given to parakeets and other caged birds as a source of dietary calcium.|$|E
25|$|A {{substrate}} {{for growing}} corals {{referred to as}} Biorock is produced by running low voltage electrical currents through seawater to crystallize dissolved minerals onto steel structures. The resultant white carbonate (<b>aragonite)</b> is the same mineral that makes up natural coral reefs. Corals rapidly colonize and grow at accelerated rates on these coated structures. The electrical currents also accelerate formation and growth of both chemical limestone rock and the skeletons of corals and other shell-bearing organisms. The vicinity of the anode and cathode provides a high-pH environment which inhibits the growth of competitive filamentous and fleshy algae. The increased growth rates fully depend on the accretion activity.|$|E
25|$|On the whole, {{the fossil}} record only {{contains}} mineralised exoskeletons, since these {{are by far the}} most durable. Since most lineages with exoskeletons are thought to have started out with a non-mineralised exoskeleton which they later mineralised, this makes it difficult to comment on the very early evolution of each lineage's exoskeleton. It is known, however, that in a very short course of time, just before the Cambrian period, exoskeletons made of various materials – silica, calcium phosphate, calcite, <b>aragonite,</b> and even glued-together mineral flakes – sprang up in a range of different environments. Most lineages adopted the form of calcium carbonate which was stable in the ocean at the time they first mineralised, and did not change from this mineral morph - even when it became the less favorable.|$|E
