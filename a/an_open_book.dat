5|$|Older gravestones in the {{cemetery}} are generally cut from limestone, and the gravestones placed after 1900 are predominantly made of polished granite. Most of the gravestones have weathered significantly. The gravestones are generally rounded or rectangular in shape, and are placed on small stone foundations. The gravestones of prominent local leaders are more ornate in character, including that of Captain David Pugh and his family, who are buried under a large obelisk that lists the names of his three wives and their respective children. Nixon's gravestone is deteriorating due to advanced weathering; it is made of limestone and contains a carving of <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>book.</b> Following {{the purchase of a}} rectangular land tract around 1990, {{the cemetery}} was expanded on the east side. This section of the cemetery is excluded from the church's historically-recognized boundaries, as it was not associated with the church during the period of its greatest significance.|$|E
5|$|The {{coat of arms}} {{consists}} of a shield, a crest, and a motto, together with a helmet. The shield contains an eagle, symbolic of the heavenly vision, with a cross on its breast to indicate Christianity as {{the inspiration for the}} university's vision. The chief of the shield bears <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>book,</b> a common symbol of learning, with a maple leaf on each side, signifying that McMaster's charter was granted by the Province of Ontario. The helmet, above the shield, has the open visor and forward-facing style typically used by universities. The mantling surrounding the shield and helmet represents the cloak worn over a knight's armour as protection from the sun. The crest, located above the helmet, is a stag and oak tree, which serves as a tribute to the Canadian Senator, William McMaster, who also used a stag and oak on his insignias. The motto is located above the crest, as is common in Scottish heraldry.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} centres on the double-height entrance hall, {{with the}} theme of Time. The painted ceiling depicts the astrological signs of the constellations, arranged in the positions they held when the house was first occupied. A large stained glass window contains four female figures representing Dawn, Noon, Twilight and Night. A mosaic floor in the entrance hall contains a labyrinth design, with the centre depicting the myth of Theseus slaying the Minotaur. The garden's entrance door, also covered in bronze, is decorated with a relief of the Madonna and Child. As elsewhere, Burges incorporated earlier designs, the bronze doors echoing those at Cork Cathedral, and the maze floor recalling an earlier ceiling at Burges's office at 15 Buckingham Street. Emblems adorn the five doors on the ground floor, each one relevant to their respective room. A flower marked {{the door to the}} garden, with the front door marked by a key. The library is indicated by <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>book,</b> the drawing or music room by musical instruments, and the dining room by a bowl and flask of wine.|$|E

5|$|The {{excavations}} {{also revealed}} stones or fragments of carved stone {{dating from the}} 12th to the 16thcenturies. The earliest are in Romanesque style and include two voussoirs decorated with beakheads (grotesque animal heads with long pointed bird-like beaks). Other stones dating from the 12thcentury are in Gothic style; they include a capital decorated with leaves and {{a portion of the}} tracery from a rose window. Many of the stones from the 13thcentury were originally part of the cloister arcade, and had been re-used to form the core of a later cloister arcade. They include stones sculpted with depictions of humans and animals. The best preserved of these are the heads of two canons, each wearing a cowl with the tonsure visible, the head of a woman with shoulder-length hair, parts of a seated figure holding <b>an</b> <b>open</b> <b>book,</b> and a creature that might represent a serpent or an otter. There are numerous fragments dating from the 14th and 15thcenturies. These include portions of string courses, tracery, corbels, window jambs, and arch heads. At least three of the corbels were carved in the form of human heads. Over 1,500fragments of painted medieval glass were found, most of it in a poor condition. These show that the glazing scheme used in the priory was mainly in grisaille (monochrome) style. Almost 1,300fragments of glass from later periods, and nearly 1,150sherds of ceramic roof tiles were also found.|$|E

50|$|In <b>an</b> <b>open</b> stud <b>book,</b> animals may be {{registered}} {{even if their}} parents or earlier ancestors were not previously registered with that particular entity. Usually <b>an</b> <b>open</b> stud <b>book</b> has strict studbook selection criteria that require an animal to meet a certain standard of conformation, performance or both. This allows breeders to modify breeds by including individuals who conform to the breed standard but are of outside origin. Some horse breeds allow crossbreds who meet specific criteria to {{be registered}}. One example is the semi-open stud book of the American Quarter Horse, which still accepts horses of Thoroughbred breeding, particularly via its appendix registry. Among dogs, an example of <b>an</b> <b>open</b> stud <b>book</b> would be the registries maintained by the American Kennel Club as its Foundation Stock Service.
