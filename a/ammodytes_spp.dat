50|$|The {{grey seal}} feeds {{on a wide}} variety of fish, mostly benthic or {{demersal}} species, taken at depths down to 70 m (230 ft) or more. Sand eels (<b>Ammodytes</b> <b>spp)</b> are important in its diet in many localities. Cod and other gadids, flatfish, herring, wrasse and skates are also important locally. However, it is clear that the grey seal will eat whatever is available, including octopus and lobsters. The average daily food requirement is estimated to be 5 kg (11 lb), though the seal does not feed every day and it fasts during the breeding season.|$|E
50|$|In the North Atlantic, they {{primarily}} eat small schooling fish, demersal fish, and krill. A 2007 {{study showed}} that off Spitsbergen they fed almost exclusively on members of the euphausiid genus Thysanoessa (mainly T. inermis), but nearly a fifth also fed on small amounts of capelin. A small percentage of individuals, by decreasing frequency, also fed on polar cod, Atlantic cod, haddock, and copepods. Capelin dominated off Bear Island and in the southern Barents Sea, accounting for about three-quarters of their diet in both regions. Nearly half (nearly 46 per cent) also consumed euphausiids (Thysanoessa spp.) in the former area - haddock (12.5%), blue whiting (8.3%), polar cod, Atlantic cod, Atlantic herring, and copepods constituted the rest. Herring and haddock were also taken in the southern Barents Sea (accounting for 41.5 and 28.7 per cent by frequency of occurrence, respectively), while sandeel (<b>Ammodytes</b> <b>spp.),</b> Atlantic cod, copepods, euphausiids, pollock, and blue whiting made {{up the rest of}} the diet. In the Norwegian Sea, herring was found in all individuals sampled (n= 10), with some (20 per cent each) also feeding on a small amount of capelin and blue whiting - an earlier study, based on data primarily obtained between 1943-1945, showed that they fed exclusively on herring off Vesterålen, while the diet off Lofoten was more varied, including herring (34 per cent by occurrence), pelagic crustaceans (23%), Atlantic cod (22%), haddock (6%), and a mixture of coalfish and flatfish for one individual (1.5%). In the North Sea, they primarily fed on sandeel (62%) and Atlantic mackerel (nearly 30%), with some feeding on herring (16.2%), small amounts of Mueller's pearlside (10.8%), copepods, haddock, capelin, and whiting. They were found to feed almost exclusively on Atlantic mackerel in the northern North Sea, while the same was true for sandeel in the eastern North Sea. Off Iceland, they mainly fed on sandeel (nearly 58 per cent of sampled individuals), haddock (22.6%), herring (20%), capelin (19.4%), and Atlantic cod (14.7%), with the rest of the diet consisting of euphausiids, various larger species of gadiods, and Norway pout. Sandeel was more important in southern Iceland (constituting 78 per cent of sampled individuals), while capelin (35.1%), haddock (28.7%), and cod (22.3%) were more important in the north. Euphausiids were only consumed in the north. Although haddock was only a minor part of the diet the first couple years of the study (0 and 4% in 2003 and 2004, respectively), it subsequently constituted a major component of it (31-35% in 2005-2007), while sandeel's importance in the south declined considerably (95.2 to 77.7% from 2003-2006, but only 18.1% in 2007). Off southeastern Greenland, they only fed on capelin, while sandeel dominated off southwestern Greenland. In a sample of 172 minke whales caught off Newfoundland between 1966 and 1972, the vast majority (85%) fed only on fish, mainly capelin. Some fed on a mixture of capelin and cod, while others had only consumed cod. Other gadiods, herring, krill, and squid formed the rest of the diet.|$|E

40|$|Pacific sand lances, Ammodytes personatus, are {{nutrient}} dense {{forage fish}} important to salmon recovery and orca conservation in the San Juan archipelago. Sand lances burrow into sandy sediments during quiescence {{and in response}} to threats. <b>Ammodytes</b> <b>spp.</b> choose habitats with specific sizes of sediment particles, but the biological reasons for their preferences are poorly understood. Burrowing force in different sediments is measured using resin models of sand lance and a materials testing system. The final testing methods are validated by first varying the volume of sediment, mixing procedure, and speed. Laboratory limitations do not preclude comparison with in-vivo activity. There is a non-linear relationship between force and grain size. In general, coarser sediments are more difficult to penetrate. When the scales were removed, models more easily penetrated the sediment, but produced a similar non-linear trend. Burrowing forces are correlated with observed habitat preferences, and may be useful in habitat predictions. ...|$|E

40|$|Visual {{observations}} and quantitative samples of forestomach contents {{were made of}} minke whales caught in the Norwegian Sea (15 visual observations in 1999, 8 in 2000 and 1 stomach sample) and North Sea (15 visual {{observations and}} 7 stomach samples, all from 1999). Prey species were identified, and from the forestomach samples, each prey’s relative contribution by weight to the diet was calculated. In the Norwegian Sea, the diet was dominated by Norwegian spring-spawning herring (100 %). This {{was consistent with the}} large and dominant abundance of herring in the area. Observations and forestomach samples from the North Sea indicated a more varied diet, with sandeel (<b>Ammodytes</b> <b>spp.)</b> contributing 86. 7 % to the diet by weight, followed by mackerel (9. 3 %), whiting (2. 4 %), herring (1. 1 %) and Norway pout (0. 5 %). Haddock was observed in one stomach, but was not found in any of the samples. Sandeel occurred in all observed and four of the sampled stomachs.

40|$|Breeding seabirds are {{threatened}} by human activities that affect nesting and foraging habitat. In Canada, one of the seabirds most at risk of extirpation is the Roseate Tern, Sterna dougallii. Although critical nesting habitat has been identified for the Roseate Tern in Canada, its foraging locations and the diet of its chicks are unknown. Therefore, {{our goal was to}} determine the foraging locations and diet of chicks of Roseate Tern breeding on Country Island, Nova Scotia, which is one of Canada&# 039;s two main breeding colonies. In 2003 and 2004, we radio-tracked the Roseate Tern by plane to locate foraging areas and conducted feeding watches to determine the diet of chicks. Roseate Tern foraged approximately 7 km from the breeding colony over shallow water < 5 m deep. In both years, sand lance, <b>Ammodytes</b> <b>spp.,</b> was the most common prey item delivered to chicks, followed by hake, Urophycis spp. Our results are consistent with previous work at colonies in the northeastern United States, suggesting that throughout its range, this species may be restricted in both habitat use and prey selection. The reliance on a specific habitat type and narrow range of prey species makes the Roseate Tern generally susceptible to habitat perturbations and reductions in the availability of prey...|$|E
40|$|To provide data on {{the feeding}} habits of hooded (Cystophora cristata) seals in the Greenland Sea, seals were {{collected}} for scientific purposes on expeditions with R/V”Jan Mayen”, conducted in the pack ice belt east of Greenland in September/October 1999 and 2002 (autumn), July/August in 2000 (summer), and February/March in 2001 and 2002 (winter). Results from analyses of stomach and intestinal contents from captured seals revealed that the diet was comprised of relatively few prey taxa. The squid Gonatus fabricii and polar cod Boreogadus saida were particularly important, whereas capelin Mallotus villosus, and sand eels <b>Ammodytes</b> <b>spp</b> contributed more occasionally. G. fabricii {{was the most important}} food item in autumn and winter, whereas the observed summer diet was more characterized by polar cod, however with important contribution also from G. fabricii and sand eels. The latter was observed on the hooded seal menu only during the summer period, while polar cod, which contributed importantly also during the autumn survey, was almost absent from the winter samples. During the latter survey, also capelin contributed to the hooded seal diet.

40|$|Although the Atlantic {{white-sided dolphin}} (Lagenorhynchus acutus) {{is one of}} the most common {{dolphins}} off New England, little has been documented about its diet in the western North Atlantic Ocean. Current federal protection of marine mammals limits the supply of animals for investigation to those incidentally caught in the nets of commercial fishermen with observers aboard. Stomachs of 62 L. acutus were examined; of these 62 individuals, 28 of them were caught by net and 34 were animals stranded on Cape Cod. Most of the net-caught L. acutus were from the deeper waters of the Gulf of Maine. A single stomach was from the continental slope south of Georges Bank. At least twenty-six fish species and three cephalopod species were eaten. The predominant prey were silver hake (Merluccius bilinearis), spoonarm octopus (Bathypolypus bairdii), and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus). The stomach from a net-caught L. acutus on the continental slope contained 7750 otoliths of the Madeira lanternfish (Ceratoscopelus maderensis). Sand lances (<b>Ammodytes</b> <b>spp.)</b> were the most abundant (541 otoliths) species in the stomachs of stranded L. acutus. Seasonal variation in diet was indicated; pelagic Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus) was the most important prey in summer, but was rare in winter.

40|$|Increased {{pressure}} {{has been placed}} on researchers to focus on processes at an ecosystem level. However, ecological processes operate at multiple scales from an individual predator up to ocean basin migrations, and research across these scales is extremely difficult. More accurate and detailed understanding of prey distributions relative to physical and biological features can greatly aid in understanding top predator distributions and ultimately ecosystem functioning. High resolution acoustic data is a critical tool {{that can be used to}} investigate food web linkages at many spatial scales. At a broad scale, migratory top predators are often modeled relative to oceanographic structure as a proxy for the distribution of their prey. At a fine scale, combining novel technologies including fisheries acoustics, real time oceanographic sensors, and digital tags allows examination of decisions made by an individual foraging whale. In the Gulf of Mexico, fish distributions at fine scales (both horizontal and vertical) were examined relative to hypoxic bottom waters to understand potential ecosystem effects. Forage fish distribution (sand lance, <b>Ammodytes</b> <b>spp.)</b> were measured relative to physical features and oceanographic processes up to the decision making of a top predator, the humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae). The effect of geostrophic currents and environmental regimes on the deep scattering layers of the central tropical pacific were examined relative to sightings of marine mammals in the area.

40|$|Analyses of the {{foraging}} {{behavior of}} large cetaceans have generally focused on either correlations with environmental conditions at regional scales or observations of surface behavior. We employed {{a novel approach}} combining multi-scale analyses of simultaneous environmental conditions, surface and subsurface humpback whaleMegaptera novaeangliae movements, and sand lance <b>Ammodytes</b> <b>spp.</b> prey aggregations in the Gulf of Maine, USA. At the fine scale (3 ̆c 1 3 ̆ekm), digital tags recorded whale movement and behavior in 3 dimensions. Concurrent synoptic prey data were collected using EK 60 echosounders with simultaneous surface measurements of temperature and relative fluorescence within 1 km of the tagged whale. A geospatial analysis of environmental features and foraging patterns was conducted at the regional, seascape scale (10 km). At the seascape scale, we found: (1) a negative relationship between relative fluorescence and sand lance density; (2) {{a positive relationship between}} predator surface feeding, presumed sand lance density, and sand bottom types near high-slope edges; (3) a cyclical relationship for predator surface-feeding likelihood and prey density with tidal height; and (4) an observed temporal lag between peak prey density and predator surface-feeding likelihood. At the fine scale, we found that: (1) time of day was {{the most important factor in}} predicting whether a whale was feeding when it surfaced; and (2) surface feeding occurred more often around more dense, vertically distributed schools of prey.

Food {{shortage}} and predation {{are the main}} factors limiting the breeding success of many colonial seabirds. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine whether they influence breeding success of Arctic Terns Sterna paradisaea in a colony of 99 breeding pairs at Kaldbaksbotnur on the island of Streymoy, Faroe Islands. In 2003, we investigated clutch size, hatching success, food provisioning to chicks, kleptoparasitism, and predation, and the number of fledged chicks. Clutch size was on average 1. 65 (± 0. 48) eggs/clutch with a hatching success of 100 %. Food provisioning rates were low with 0. 47 (± 0. 18) feeds per nest per hour. Most prey items were small (c. 32 mm long), and terns showed high rates of intraspecific kleptoparasitism. Attacks by avian predators were occasionally observed, mainly by Herring Gulls Larus argentatus, but were unsuccessful in all observed cases. Counts of fledged chicks indicated average breeding productivity of 0. 22 chicks per pair. Our results suggest that breeding success in this colony was mainly affected by food shortage, possibly limited sandeel <b>Ammodytes</b> <b>spp.</b> availability. Predation appears to be less important, but could occur at a low rate. The results are consistent with recent evidence showing that seabirds that feed on sandeels currently have limited breeding success in the orth Atlantic region...|$|E
40|$|Ecosystem-based fishery {{management}} (EBFM) requires taking account of indirect effects (such as habitat destruction, incidental mortality, and {{competition between the}} fishery and marine mammals or birds) and dealing with non-commensurate values (such as yield from the fishery and production of offspring by the birds or mammals competing for the same resource). The perspective of EBFM requires {{that the rate of}} fishing mortality is less than the value that provides maximum sustainable yield (MSY), but the question is how far below this level should the fishery operate[glottal stop] For this problem in multiobjective programming, simple method of solution was developed and illustrated with the fishery for sandeels (<b>Ammodytes</b> <b>spp.)</b> in the Shetland Islands. The yield from the fishery at a given fishing mortality F is scaled by MSY (so that this quantity increases as fishing mortality increases from 0 to that giving MSY) and the breeding success of predators (black-legged kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla and Arctic terns Sterna paradisaea) at a given fishing mortality is scaled by that in the absence of fishing. The result is two non-dimensional quantities that can be combined into a single value function, which can then be explored or optimized. It is shown that a reduction of only about 20 percent in yield can nearly double the breeding performance of the more sensitive predator. Extensions of the method are discussed; these include the use of maximum economic yield (MEY) and state dependent life history, as implemented by stochastic dynamic programming.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of Atlantic puffins (Fratercula arctica) from Skellig Michael, south-west Ireland, was investigated using geolocation loggers between the 2010 and 2011 breeding seasons. All tracked birds travelled rapidly west into the North Atlantic {{at the end}} of the breeding season in August, with the majority undertaking transatlantic trips from Ireland to the Newfoundland-Labrador shelf. The furthest distance from the colony reached by each bird was not influenced by body mass or sex and was achieved in approximately 20 days. By October, all birds had moved back to the mid Atlantic where they remained resident until returning to the breeding colony. The most parsimonious explanation for the rapid, directed long-distance migration is that birds exploit the seasonally high abundance of prey [e. g., fish species such as capelin (Mallotus villosus) and sandlance (<b>Ammodytes</b> <b>spp.)</b> ] off the Canadian coast, which is also utilised by large populations of North American seabirds at this time. Once the availability of this short-term prey resource has diminished, the tracked puffins moved back towards the north-east Atlantic. A relationship between relative abundance of puffins and zooplankton was found in all winter months, but after correcting for spatial autocorrelation, was only significant in November and January. Nevertheless, these results suggest a potential switch in diet from mainly fish during the breeding and early post-breeding periods to zooplankton over the remaining winter period. This study suggests that puffins from south-west Ireland have a long-distance migration strategy that is rare in breeding puffins from the UK and identifies a key non-breeding destination for puffins from Ireland. This has implications for the susceptibility of different breeding populations to the effects of possible climatic or oceanographic change...|$|E
40|$|Effective species {{conservation}} and management requires information on species distribution patterns, which is challenging for highly mobile and cryptic species that {{may be subject to}} multiple anthropogenic stressors across international boundaries. Understanding species-habitat relationships can improve the assessment of trends and distribution by explicitly allowing high-resolution data on habitats to inform abundance estimation and the identification of protected areas. In this study, we aggregated an unprecedented set of survey data of a marine top predator, the harbor porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), collected in the UK (SCANS II, Dogger Bank), Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, and Denmark, to develop seasonal habitat-based density models for the central and southern North Sea. Visual survey data were collected over 9 yr (2005 - 2013) by means of dedicated line-transect surveys, taking into account the proportion of missed sightings. Generalized additive models of porpoise density were fitted to 156, 630 km of on-effort survey data with 14, 356 sightings of porpoise groups. Selected predictors included static and dynamic variables, such as depth, distance to shore and to sandeel (<b>Ammodytes</b> <b>spp.)</b> grounds, sea surface temperature (SST), proxies for fronts, and day length. Day length and the spatial distribution of daily SST proved to be good proxies for "season," allowing predictions in both space and time. The density models captured seasonal distribution shifts of porpoises across international boundaries. By combining the large-scale international SCANS II survey with the more frequent, small-scale national surveys, it has been possible to provide seasonal maps that will be used to assist the EU Habitats and Marine Strategy Framework Directives in effectively assessing the conservation status of harbor porpoises. Moreover, our results can facilitate the identification of regions where human activities and disturbances are likely to impact the population and are especially relevant for marine spatial planning, which requires accurate fine-scale maps of species distribution to assess risks of increasing human activities at sea. </p...|$|E
40|$|Life history theory {{predicts that}} seabirds {{will respond to}} {{reduction}} in food abundance by changes in behaviour or breeding effort, buffering adult survival. Empirical data show some support for this but also sometimes indicate a trade-off in which survival of breeding seabirds may be reduced by food shortage. The sensitivity of seabird adult survival rates may be {{a feature of the}} detailed ecology of particular species and may be affected by ecological conditions such as the possibilities for prey switching. Fishery managers may set a lower limit biomass to protect fish stock recruitment, often at about 20 % of predicted unfished stock biomass. It is unclear whether this threshold would also protect the needs of seabirds dependent on the fish stock. Time series of seabird breeding success and fish stock biomass may indicate minimum densities of food required. These are orders of magnitude more than the consumption by seabird populations. The critical prey density may also vary tremendously among seabird species and is clearly a function of the detailed ecology of each species. It is possible to predict which species will be most sensitive to reduced food supply. Sensitive species may be sentinels of the "health'' of the marine ecosystem. For example, in Shetland and elsewhere in the North Sea, breeding success of kittiwakes Rissa tridactyla is particularly sensitive to abundance and quality of sandeels <b>Ammodytes</b> <b>spp.</b> However, seabird communities may be affected by a variety of interactions prompted by changes in fisheries; maintaining food fish levels may not alone be sufficient where communities have altered in composition over decades of fishing, as in the North Sea, and where predator-prey impacts induced by changes in fishery management may disrupt seabird communitie...|$|E
40|$|Thesis {{abstract}} Marine {{ecosystems are}} changing rapidly {{in response to}} anthropogenic and environmental stresses, and seabird populations that depend on marine resources are in decline {{in many areas of}} the world. Iceland supports internationally important populations of many seabird species and, although fishing pressures in Icelandic waters are relatively low, the impacts of current climatic and oceanic changes are predicted to be particularly severe at high latitudes, including Iceland. However, little is known about the current status and demography of Icelandic seabird populations. In this thesis, I explore the breeding demography of Arctic Terns, Sterna paradisaea, at colonies throughout the W and NE of Iceland, between 2008 and 2011. Although Arctic Tern productivity varied among colonies, it was generally low in both regions, primarily because of very low chick survival rates. Low chick survival was primarily a consequence of low growth rates throughout the pre-fledging period, and the application of forensic ecology techniques showed that chick mortality occurred throughout each breeding season and at all ages. Prey composition and prey delivery rates varied regionally and among colonies. The main high quality marine prey are sandeels, <b>Ammodytes</b> <b>spp.,</b> In W-Iceland and capelin, Mallotus villosus, in NE-Iceland, but non-marine prey of low nutritive value comprised a large proportion of chick diet in both regions. While productivity in W-Iceland increased with prey delivery rates, in NE-Iceland prey delivery was either inconsistent or low in quality, and productivity was always low. A suite of changes in marine prey communities appears to be impacting Icelandic Arctic Terns. These may include fishing impacts on capelin abundance and/or oceanic and climatic influences on the abundance and availability of sandeels, which are not fished in Iceland. These changes may also be impacting other seabird species in Iceland, for which there is also some evidence of recent low productivity...|$|E
40|$|The stomachs of 819 Atlantic {{bluefin tuna}} (Thunnus thynnus) sampled from 1988 to 1992 were {{analyzed}} to compare dietary differences among five feeding grounds on the New England continental shelf (Jeffreys Ledge, Stellwagen Bank, Cape Cod Bay, Great South Channel, and South of Martha’s Vineyard) where {{a majority of}} the U. S. Atlantic commercial catch occurs. Spatial variation in prey was expected to be a primary influence on bluefin tuna distribution during seasonal feeding migrations. Sand lance (<b>Ammodytes</b> <b>spp.),</b> Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus), squid (Cephalopoda), and bluefish (Pomatomus saltatrix) were the top prey in terms of frequency of occurrence and percent prey weight for all areas combined. Prey composition was uncorrelated between study areas, {{with the exception of a}} significant association between Stellwagen Bank and Great South Channel, where sand lance and Atlantic herring occurred most frequently. Mean stomach-contents biomass varied significantly for all study areas, except for Great South Channel and Cape Cod Bay. Jeffreys Ledge had the highest mean stomach-contents biomass (2. 0 kg) among the four Gulf of Maine areas and Cape Cod Bay had the lowest (0. 4 kg). Diet at four of the five areas was dominated by one or two small pelagic prey and several other pelagic prey made minor contributions. In contrast, half of the prey species found in the Cape Cod Bay diet were demersal species, including the frequent occurrence of the sessile fig sponge (Suberites ficus). Prey size selection was consistent over a wide range of bluefin length. Age 2 – 4 sand lance and Atlantic herring and age 0 – 1 squid and Atlantic mackerel were common prey for all sizes of bluefin tuna. This is the first study to compare diet composition of western Atlantic bluefin tuna among discrete feeding grounds during their seasonal migration to the New England continental shelf and to evaluate predator-prey size relationships. Previous studies have not found a common occurrence of demersal species or a pre-dominance of Atlantic herring in the diet of bluefin tuna...|$|E
40|$|Three {{methods for}} {{sampling}} the diets of Atlantic puffin Fratercula arctica chicks were compared and evaluated. Prey-carrying puffins were captured in mist-nets, or observed with a telescope or with unaided eyes. Prey samples collected in mist-nets yielded higher proportions of gravid capelin Mallotus villosus than did samples obtained visually. Telescopic samples produced higher {{estimates of the}} numbers of larval fish landed by puffins (larval fishes are often lost when food-laden birds are caught in mist-nets), and yielded underestimates of the lengths of male capelin. Slight correction factors made the 3 prey sampling methods comparable. Visual sampling procedures had the advantages of creating less disturbance and allowing puffins to deliver food to chicks. Use of telescopic sampling is, however, dependent on colony topography. Forage fishes, heavily dominated by 2 -yr-old capelin, made up 88 % and 98 % of the frequency and mass, respectively, of the prey delivered to puffin chicks. Small prey (larval capelin and sandlance <b>Ammodytes</b> <b>spp.,</b> hake Urophycis tenuis, crustaceans) were most commonly fed to young chicks. Gravid and male capelin {{tended to be more}} commonly ted to chicks midway through the nestling period, a time of rapid growth. Spent female and immature capelin were fed more commonly to older chicks. The lengths of gravid capelin tended to increase through the nestling period. Gravid and spent female and male capelin and sandlance fed to puffin chicks were shorter in 1992 than in 1993 or 1994. Successful puffin chicks on Great Island, Newfoundland, Canada, were fed an average of 1105 (SD = 435) prey items weighing 2812 g (SD = 579) equivalent to 12506 kJ (SD = 2391). Extrapolation of these findings suggests that the population of Atlantic puffins in Newfoundland consumes about 8000 + t of forage fishes, mostly 2 -yr-old female capelin during a breeding season. Data on age-class and gender status of prey harvests by marine birds will provide needed input in energetics and trophic models...|$|E
40|$|Most avian studies {{investigating}} {{variation in}} parental behaviour {{have focused on}} differences between species, populations, or the sexes. Despite the importance of understanding variation at multiple levels, few have investigated parental care at the individual level. The same pairs of individually marked Common Murres (Uria aalge) breeding on Great Island, Witless Bay, showed variable behavioural and physiological responses across three consecutive breeding seasons (1998 - 2000). Despite high foraging effort, chick-feeding rates were low in the early chick rearing period of 2000. Low chick feeding rates in 2000 {{were related to the}} late arrival of inshore spawning capelin (Mallotus villosus). In contrast, high chick feeding rates in 1999 may have resulted from chicks hatching later and well after capelin had arrived {{in the vicinity of the}} breeding colonies. Hatching was delayed in 1999 because more chicks hatched from re-laid eggs. Female pre-lay attendance in that year was low, which resulted in less synchronous breeding and higher predation during early incubation. Frequency of feeding rates was positively correlated with chick body mass but no relationship was found with wing length. However, chicks had longer wings in 2000 compared to 1998 and 1999. Chick diet did not differ between these two years, with chicks being fed primarily capelin supplemented with sand lance (<b>Ammodytes</b> <b>spp.).</b> [...] Collectively, females showed higher foraging effort and exhibited overall more direct parental care. At the pair level, however, both sexes tended to engage equally in behaviours related to chick rearing. It is possible that role partitioning between the sexes, in which one sex does most of the brooding while the other does most of the provisioning, may not be an adaptive strategy for Common Murres due to the high energetic costs associated with flying. [...] Overall, males and females showed similar physiological responses to breeding. Both sexes had comparable haematocrit and corticosterone levels during chick rearing. In all years, body condition of males and females increased during incubation, dropped immediately after chick hatching and continued to decrease during chick rearing. Females maintained lowered body condition after their chick had departed the colony. Body condition of murres does not appear to decrease during chick rearing solely in response to reproductive stress. Rather, mass loss may reduce energetic costs associated with flying. In 2000, murres had lower body condition during the first week of chick rearing and showed elevated corticosterone levels compared to 1998 and 1999. These results suggest that murres were stressed during early chick rearing in 2000, supporting the view that breeding conditions were less favourable in that year. [...] Because the same breeding pairs were monitored across years, the observed inter-annual differences were likely due to varying environmental conditions rather than individual variation. These results are consistent with other studies suggesting that seabirds relying on capelin in the Northwest Atlantic are experiencing highly variable breeding conditions as a result of delayed spawning and changes in the distribution of capelin. Including long-term behavioural and physiological information of marked individuals provides additional insight on the health of a population and may help further assess the quality of the breeding environment...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Efficient {{foraging}} strategies {{result in}} a predator spatially overlapping with its prey, foraging in the most profitable patches, and minimizing the time transiting between patches. Previous studies investigating baleen whale foraging strategies have generally focused on investigating spatial overlap with prey patches, patch profitability or movement within feeding grounds. The present study investigated the fine-scale strategies of movement between individual prey schools and larger prey patches in humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) bubble-feeding on sand lance (<b>Ammodytes</b> <b>spp.)</b> {{in and around the}} Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary, USA. The goal was to investigate the presence of hierarchically nested spatial structures in both sand lance patches and whale bubble-feeding behavior, and to compare the scales and geometry of these patches between predator and prey behavior on each hierarchical scale. Furthermore, the profitability of sand lance schools in feeding areas was investigated. Using animal-borne tag technology to record underwater movement of whales in combination with surface observations of whale behavior, the locations of bubble-feeding events were identified. Concurrent hydroacoustic measurements of the prey distribution in the water column were used to identify the locations and energetic parameters of sand lance schools around tagged whales. First Passage Time analysis was used to determine the spatial scale of individual bubble-feeding events. Based on spatial proximity, feeding events and prey schools were grouped into larger feeding bouts and prey patches to investigate the presence of hierarchically nested scales. Up to three hierarchy levels were found in bubble-feeding behavior of nine whales tagged on six days between 2008 and 2012, and up to five hierarchy levels in the sand lance prey field around the tagged whales. There was a significant positive correlation between the lengths of whale bubble-feeding bouts and the lengths of sand lance patches over three common hierarchy levels. On each hierarchy level, the lengths of whale bubble-feeding bouts were significantly smaller than those of sand lance patches. Mean inter-feeding bout distances were significantly positively correlated with mean inter-prey patch distances over two hierarchy levels. Mean distances between feeding events were similar to the mean distances between prey schools. On larger hierarchy levels, mean inter-bout distances were greater than mean distances among prey patches. Mean school height and density tended to be greater in schools recorded inside than outside of feeding bout areas. The prey field structures found here were likely a result of the specific habitat requirements of sand lance. The {{results of this study suggest}} that the tagged whales were able to adapt their foraging movement to the structure of the prey field. By feeding on neighboring schools, whales could minimize the time spent between prey schools. On larger spatial scales, whales did not feed on neighboring prey patches. This could be a result of decreased abilities to find the nearest patch, or because, rather than restricting their foraging movement to neighboring patches, the whales were targeting specific patches. The foraging movement observed in this study led to spatial overlap of the tagged whales with sand lance schools that were characterized by properties rendering them more energetically profitable for bubble-feeding whales. While hierarchically structured foraging movement has been found in other marine predators, this is the first study that demonstrates this kind of foraging mechanism for baleen whales...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to collect {{information}} on the breeding biology and life history of the Razorbill for comparison with similar studies in other species. An estimated 205, 000 pairs of Razorbills breed in colonies either side of the northern Atlantic; about 70 % of the birds are found in British and Irish colonies (Chapter 1). The study was conducted on the island of Skokholm, Pembrokeshire (Dyfed), South Wales between 1971 and 1973, with additional observations in 1970 and 1974. Adult Razorbills and varying numbers of chicks have been ringed on the island nearly annually since 1934 and since 1963 the chicks have been given, colour rings to denote age classes. Adults trapped in the present study were colour ringed so that they could be identified without repeated retrapping. The sexes proved impossible to distinguish on body measurements but head size provided an alternative method of sexing adults (Chapter 2). Colony attendance was recorded (Chapter 3), both during the pre-laying period and the breeding season. Breeding and non-breeding birds were separated whenever possible and diurnal and seasonal attendance at two types of colony compared. The effect of prevailing weather on attendance was evaluated. Courtship behaviour and mating frequency were recorded (Chapter 4 A). Most birds returned to their natal colony to breed and remained there, usually retaining the same nest site. Birds appeared to keep the same mate so far as the annual mortality allowed (Chapter 4 Bi). Laying (in May) occurred on average 10 - 13 days later in 1972 than in 1971 or 1973 (Chapter 4 Bii). Birds advanced their laying date with age so that those breeding late in the season were mainly young birds. The little information available on the seasonal abundance of the razorbills' chief food species <b>Ammodytes</b> <b>spp.,</b> suggested that the onset of breeding coincided with an increase in available food which appeared to be the main factor determining the timing of the breeding season. The development of synchronised colony attendance during the pre-laying period, was also thought to play an important part in timing breeding. Length, breadth, weight, shell thickness and pigmentation pattern were measured on samples of eggs in the 3 years. Shell thickness in 'fresh' eggs from Skokholm appeared similar to that of museum eggs collected before 1940. Shell pigmentation patterns were consistent from one year to the next in eggs laid by the same female. A seasonal decline in egg volume was recorded, apparently related to the age structure of the population. Young birds laid small eggs, but egg volume increased with age. On average 30 % of all eggs laid failed to hatch and more than 70 % of this loss was attributable to gulls and particularly Jackdaws Corvus monedula; the latter first bred on the island in 1965 and are increasing annually. About a quarter of the eggs lost, mainly those laid and lost early in the season, were replaced. At least some of the two egg clutches found were produced when a replacement egg was laid for a first egg which had become chilled during incubation. Incubation was on average 35 days and the nestling period averaged 17 days. About 7 % of all chicks hatched failed to fledge (Chapter 4 Biii). Most losses occurred in the first five days of life whilst chick weight was still related to the size of the egg from which it hatched. Behaviour at fledging (the female of the pair usually took the chick to the sea) is discussed in relation to the brevity of the nestling period and similar behaviour in other species. The frequency and composition of feeds to the chicks were examined and growth recorded by regular measurements of weight, feather length and tarsus length. Growth rates were fastest in 1973. Growth was independent of hatching date although chicks? from early eggs were the heaviest at fledging. As this was not associated with the seasonal trend in egg size...|$|E
40|$|Investigations on marine {{feeding of}} Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) in the Northwest Atlantic are rather limited in {{comparison}} with studies {{carried out in the}} Northeast Atlantic. Climate induced changes to food webs in marine feeding areas for Atlantic salmon have been noted in recent years, along with an increase in mortality and decrease in recruitment and growth, despite a cessation in most ocean fishing activities. Since foraging may be hampering salmon survival, it is important that this knowledge gap be addressed. Accordingly, Atlantic salmon were sampled at three communities on the West Greenland coast across three years, 2009 - 2011, and 15 rivers spanning a broad geographic range in Atlantic Canada in 2008 - 2010. Conventional gut content analyses were combined with stable isotope methods to assess spatial and temporal differences in Atlantic salmon marine feeding. An investigation of differences between juvenile feeding in freshwater and adult feeding in the marine environment indicated that Atlantic salmon undergo a dramatic change in feeding as they migrate. Smolts show much larger δ 13 C variability, due to the benthic-pelagic coupling which occurs in the freshwater ecosystem, while adults foraging in the marine environment demonstrate much smaller δ 13 C variability due to a high reliance on pelagically sourced carbon, as demonstrated by a mixing model. There was an overall decrease in the variance of δ 15 N (and therefore degree of omnivory) between smolts and returning adults, although this was not consistent across all rivers. 	Capelin (Mallotus villosus) was found to dominate diet at Nuuk and Qaqortoq, while boreoatlantic armhook squid (Gonatus fabricii) was the dominant prey at Sisimiut. Hyperiid amphipods (Themisto spp.) and sand lance (<b>Ammodytes</b> <b>spp.)</b> were also important. Significant differences were found among communities for gut contents analysis (dietary overlap and diversity) and stable isotope analysis, while fewer differences were evident temporally. Dietary differences were also evident across larger spatial and temporal scales, with a lack of overlap in diets of Atlantic salmon from the Northeast Atlantic and the emergence of boreoatlantic armhook squid as an important prey item over the last 40 years. Atlantic salmon diets are frequently anchored on one or two prey items, on which they appear to specialise, but will diversify widely to consume other available prey, confirming that this species is an opportunistic, generalist predator. 	An assessment of the reliance of Atlantic salmon on inshore prey resources and its associated seasonal variation demonstrated significant differences in inshore resource use, condition factor and fish size over time. On average, Atlantic salmon relied on inshore resources for 38 % of their diet (with a range of 0 - 84 %). Although differences between inshore and offshore feeding were small, the resulting implications of size and condition for migration and spawning success suggest important biological consequences of feeding habitat choice. The variation in inshore resource mirrors hydrographic variation and associated changes in the prey base related to glacial input, frontal zones between inshore and offshore water masses and nutrient input from run-off. The lack of significant differences in trophic niche or omnivory when relying on either inshore or offshore prey resources is suggestive of a similar number of prey species utilised. An investigation into stable isotope values for the marine growth zone of scales and its constituent growth zones (1 st summer, 1 st winter, 2 nd summer) from non-maturing 1 SW Atlantic salmon found significant differences among these zones. A mathematical model assuming isometric growth was used to correct for the biasing effect of later overplating of scales, facilitating calculation of the “pure” stable isotope values for the different marine growth zones. Appropriate accounting for the differences between measured and “pure” values will assist in minimising the ecological inference {{associated with the use of}} stable isotope analysis. Given the similarity between the measured and “pure” whole marine growth zone values, the measured whole marine growth zone can be used as a proxy for average marine feeding, while the commonly used 2 nd summer growth zone was found not to be representative of earlier marine feeding. This thesis is the first to combine SIA and GCA to examine Atlantic salmon diet in the Northwest Atlantic, and has demonstrated that Atlantic salmon in the marine environment are pelagically feeding opportunists, with preferences towards several specific prey species and the use of inshore resources while feeding along the West Greenland coast. Additionally, as discussed above, this thesis has expanded the understanding of the use of scales in SIA, and identified a number of potential areas for future research...|$|E
