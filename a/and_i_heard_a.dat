It’s something that I did with her voice. I mean, a lot or people who hear it, they might not even realize that it's her. I use textures when I do records and I just wanted her voice texture on this record, and she really made this song. Now she's been complaining saying she's been taken off the record, I don't know where that came from. She's really foolish {{to be out here}} talking [...] I'm still gonna keep her on the song because she ain't know what she was doing".|$|E
2500|$|A true {{indication}} of how successful the Beatles became thanks to [...] "From Me to You" [...] (though it would soon be overshadowed by [...] "She Loves You" [...] and [...] "I Want to Hold Your Hand") was expressed by McCartney: [...] "The first time I thought we'd really made it, was when I was lying in bed one morning, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> milkman whistling 'From Me to You'. Actually, I'm sure that I once heard a bird whistling it as well. I swear I did!" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{history of}} {{chiropractic}} began in 1895 when Daniel David Palmer of Iowa performed the first chiropractic adjustment on a partially deaf janitor, Harvey Lillard. While Lillard was working without his shirt on in Palmers office, Lillard {{bent over to}} empty the trash can. Palmer noticed that Lillard had a vertebra out of position. He asked Lillard what happened, and Lillard replied, [...] "I moved the wrong way, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> 'pop' in my back, and that's when I lost my hearing." [...] Palmer, who was also involved in many other natural healing philosophies, had Lillard lie {{face down on the}} floor and proceeded with the adjustment. The next day, Lillard told Palmer, [...] "I can hear that rackets on the streets." [...] This experience led Palmer to open a school of chiropractic two years later. Rev. Samel Weed coined the word [...] "chiropractic" [...] from Greek roots. Chiropractic's early philosophy was rooted in vitalism, naturalism, magnetism, spiritualism and other constructs that are not amenable to the scientific method, although Palmer tried to merge science and metaphysics. In 1896, Palmer's first descriptions and underlying philosophy of chiropractic echoed Andrew Still's principles of osteopathy established a decade earlier. Both described the body as a [...] "machine" [...] whose parts could be manipulated to produce a drugless cure. Both professed the use of spinal manipulation on joint dysfunction/subluxation to improve health. Palmer distinguished his work by noting that he was the first to use short-lever HVLA manipulative techniques using the spinous process and transverse processes as mechanical levers. He described the effects of chiropractic spinal manipulation as being mediated primarily by the nervous system.|$|E

6000|$|The man led me {{into the}} service room {{and turned to the}} left. He knocked at a closed door, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> sleepy voice say-- ...|$|E

6000|$|The silence {{lasted for}} some time <b>and</b> then <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> murmur: “It’s {{a matter of the}} utmost {{delicacy}} between two beings so sensitive, so proud. It has to be managed.” ...|$|R

60|$|I could 'ear {{several people}} talking, {{and it seemed}} to me there was quite a crowd out there, and by and by that bell was going like mad.

I suppose there was about fifty of 'em all telling it at once, and then there was the sound of a fist on the gate.|$|R
60|$|I said nothing; {{the face}} vanished, <b>and</b> just then <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> baboon bark {{in the rocks}} behind.|$|R

60|$|I {{believe that}} I {{remained}} senseless for many hours, though {{towards the end}} of that time my swoon grew thin, as it were, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> hollow voice speaking over me in Zulu.|$|E

60|$|His voice broke, and his jaw dropped. The hand he had swung up {{fell to his}} side, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>a</b> faint cry as he sank limply {{into his}} chair. He lay there with {{his head on the}} carved back gazing at his rebellious {{followers}} with glassy eyes.|$|E
