The present re-search sought to answer this question. Based on the aforementioned prior research, and short term mating desires, sex differences in reactions to different types of sexual infidelity were not expected.

The results were consistent with the hypothesis. Both men and women were most upset by <b>a</b> <b>partner’s</b> engagement <b>in</b> sexual intercourse with another person.
