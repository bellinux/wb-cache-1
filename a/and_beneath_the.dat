5|$|Gojira were {{included}} in Children of Bodom's US tour in late 2006, joining Amon Amarth and Sanctity as the openers. Gojira also supported Trivium on the UK dates of their European tour in 2007 with Sanctity and Annihilator. Later they supported Lamb of God on their 2007 American tour along with Trivium and Machine Head. In late 2007, they {{took part in the}} Radio Rebellion Tour, featuring co-headliners Behemoth, Job for a Cowboy, <b>and</b> <b>Beneath</b> <b>the</b> Massacre. In October 2007, Listenable Records re-released Gojira's 1997 demo Possessed as a limited edition.|$|E
5|$|One {{major reason}} for its {{widespread}} success is that the olive baboon is omnivorous. As such {{it is able to}} find nutrition in almost any environment, and it is able to adapt with different foraging tactics. For instance, the olive baboon in grassland goes about finding food differently from one in a forest. The baboon forages on all levels of an environment, above <b>and</b> <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> ground and in the canopy of forests. Most animals only look for food at one level; an arboreal species such as a lemur does not look for food on the ground. The olive baboon searches as wide an area as it can, and it eats virtually everything it finds.|$|E

5|$|The main {{components}} of the design are nine scenes from the Book of Genesis, of which five smaller ones are each framed and supported by four naked youths or Ignudi. At either end, <b>and</b> <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> scenes are the figures of twelve {{men and women who}} prophesied the birth of Jesus. On the crescent-shaped areas, or lunettes, above each of the chapel's windows are tablets listing the Ancestors of Christ and accompanying figures. Above them, in the triangular spandrels, a further eight groups of figures are shown, but these have not been identified with specific Biblical characters. The scheme is completed by four large corner pendentives, each illustrating a dramatic Biblical story.|$|E
5|$|In June 2007, {{the band}} {{performed}} at the Download Festival in Donington Park, England. The group also played at the Sounds of the Underground festival along with Amon Amarth, Chimaira, Gwar, and Shadows Fall. In October, Job for a Cowboy co-headlined the 2007 Radio Rebellion Tour, teaming up with Behemoth, Gojira, <b>and</b> <b>Beneath</b> <b>the</b> Massacre. The band featured on the 2008 Gigantour with headliners Megadeth, Children of Bodom, In Flames, and High on Fire. In addition, they confirmed {{for a number of}} festivals during 2008, including Wacken Open Air in Germany and a second appearance at England's Download Festival. Job for a Cowboy embarked on a U.S. headlining tour in November and December 2008 with supporting acts Hate Eternal and All Shall Perish. In late 2008, guitarist Ravi Bhadriraju left Job for a Cowboy to return to school because he wanted to pursue a more rewarding career in the medical field. He was replaced with former Despised Icon guitarist Al Glassman.|$|E
5|$|Pelicans {{are very}} large birds with very long bills characterised by a downcurved hook {{at the end}} of the upper mandible, and the {{attachment}} of a huge gular pouch to the lower. The slender rami of the lower bill and the flexible tongue muscles form the pouch into a basket for catching fish and, sometimes, rainwater, though in order not to hinder the swallowing of large fish, the tongue itself is tiny. They have a long neck and short stout legs with large, fully webbed feet. Although they are among the heaviest of flying birds, they are relatively light for their apparent bulk because of air pockets in the skeleton <b>and</b> <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> skin enabling them to float high in the water. The tail is short and square. The wings are long and broad, suitably shaped for soaring and gliding flight, and have the unusually large number of 30 to 35 secondary flight feathers.|$|E

5|$|Several lesser known {{moments in}} the rivalry {{occurred}} during the 1930s. Pitcher Red Ruffing was traded in 1930 from the Red Sox to the Yankees. Ruffing, who had limited success with the Red Sox, {{would go on to}} a Hall of Fame career with the Yankees winning 6 World Series with them. On August 12, 1934, then the largest crowd in the history of Fenway Park, 46,766, witnessed Babe Ruth's final game at Fenway Park in a Yankees uniform in a game Boston would lose. A year later, the crowd record would be broken again when the two teams met again on September 22, 1935. Record crowds would also show up at Yankee Stadium. On May 30, 1938, before 83,533 spectators, Yankees outfielder Jake Powell and Red Sox player-manager Joe Cronin fought on the field <b>and</b> <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> stands. Both players were fined and suspended for 10 games. The Yankees and Red Sox would finish first and second in the League respectively that year as well as the following. The Yankees went on to sweep the Chicago Cubs in the World Series and the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series a year later.|$|E
5|$|The {{first stage}} of a {{thunderstorm}} is the cumulus stage or developing stage. During this stage, masses of moisture are lifted upwards into the atmosphere. The trigger for this lift can be solar illumination, where the heating of the ground produces thermals, or where two winds converge forcing air upwards, or where winds blow over terrain of increasing elevation. The moisture carried upward cools into liquid drops of water due to lower temperatures at high altitude, which appear as cumulus clouds. As the water vapor condenses into liquid, latent heat is released, which warms the air, causing it to become less dense than the surrounding, drier air. The air tends to rise in an updraft {{through the process of}} convection (hence the term convective precipitation). This process creates a low-pressure zone within <b>and</b> <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> forming thunderstorm. In a typical thunderstorm, approximately 500 million kilograms of water vapor are lifted into the Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

25|$|In turn, {{track ballast}} {{typically}} {{rests on a}} layer of small crushed stones: the sub-ballast. The sub-ballast layer gives a solid support for the top ballast, and reduces the seepage {{of water from the}} underlying ground. Sometimes an elastic mat is placed on the layer of sub-ballast <b>and</b> <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> ballast, thereby significantly reducing vibration.|$|E

It derives from the oldest known (and almost {{certainly}} the original) complex form of the Jesse Tree, with the tree rising from a sleeping Jesse, a window placed in the Saint-Denis Basilica by Abbot Suger in about 1140, which is now heavily restored.|$|E
25|$|The Formidables and Londons {{improved}} on {{the main}} and secondary armament of previous classes, being upgunned from 35-caliber to 40-caliber 12-inch (305-mm) guns and from 40-caliber to 45-caliber 6-inch (152-mm) guns. The 12-inch guns could be loaded at any bearing and elevation, <b>and</b> <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> turrets the ships had a split hoist with a working chamber beneath the guns that reduced {{the chance of a}} cordite fire spreading from the turret to the shell and powder handling rooms and to the magazines.|$|E
25|$|The {{first version}} of the 109 to have wing guns was the C-1, which had one MG 17 in each wing. To avoid {{redesigning}} the wing to accommodate large ammunition boxes and access hatches, an unusual ammunition feed was devised whereby a continuous belt holding 500 rounds was fed along chutes out to the wing tip, around a roller and then back along the wing, forward <b>and</b> <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> gun breech, to the wing root, where it coursed around another roller {{and back to the}} weapon.|$|E

Goodbye! <b>and</b> <b>Beneath</b> <b>the</b> Valley of the Ultra-Vixens). Additionally, Russ Meyer's female characters were often allowed to express anger and violence towards men (Faster, Pussycat!

25|$|Another {{significant}} {{commission was}} {{to design the}} mosaics for each side <b>and</b> <b>beneath</b> <b>the</b> canopy of the Albert Memorial.

The Queen remained in deep mourning until the ornate structure was unveiled, complete with a gilt statue of her husband. The firm of Salviati from Murano, Venice, had manufactured the mosaics to Clayton and Bell's designs. Not surprisingly, the firm of Clayton and Bell was awarded a Royal Warrant by the Queen in 1883.|$|E
