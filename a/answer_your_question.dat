500|$|Rumors of Stroud's {{homosexuality}} {{were noted}} at Alcatraz. According to Donald Hurley, {{whose father was}} a guard at Alcatraz, [...] "Whenever Stroud was around anyone, which was seldom, he was watched very closely, as prison officials were very aware of his overt homosexual tendencies." [...] In an interview with Hurley for his book, a former inmate heard Stroud was always in 'dog block' (solitary confinement) or later in the hospital {{because he was a}} 'wolf' (aggressive homosexual) who had a bad temper." [...] In February 1963 Stroud met and talked with actor Burt Lancaster, who portrayed him in The Birdman of Alcatraz. Stroud never got to see the film or read the book it was based on but did share on {{one of the problems that}} prevented parole, that he was an [...] "admitted homosexual." [...] Lancaster quoted Stroud as saying, [...] "Let's face it, I am 73 years old. Does that <b>answer</b> <b>your</b> <b>question</b> about whether I would be a dangerous homosexual?" ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1989, Bush was the {{campaign}} manager of Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the first Cuban-American {{to serve in}} Congress. In 1994, Bush launched an unsuccessful bid for the Governor's office against incumbent Democratic Governor Lawton Chiles. Bush ran that year as a conservative. At one point, he was asked {{what he would do}} for African Americans, and Bush responded: [...] "It’s time to strive for a society where there’s equality of opportunity, not equality of results. So I’m going to <b>answer</b> <b>your</b> <b>question</b> by saying: probably nothing." [...] Bush lost the election by only 63,940 votes out of 4,206,076 that were cast for the major party candidates (2,135,008; 51% to 2,071,068; 49%). In the same election year, his older brother, George, was elected Governor of Texas. Following his election loss, Bush joined the board of The Heritage Foundation and continued to work with Codina Partners. Alongside T. William Fair, the president of the Urban League's Miami affiliate, Bush helped to establish Florida's first charter school.|$|E
2500|$|Edith Grossman, {{who wrote}} and {{published}} a highly acclaimed English {{translation of the}} novel in 2003, says that the book is mostly meant to move people into emotion using a systematic change of course, {{on the verge of}} both tragedy and comedy at the same time. Grossman has stated:The question is that Quixote has multiple interpretations [...] and how do I deal with that in my translation. I'm going to <b>answer</b> <b>your</b> <b>question</b> by avoiding it [...] so when I first started reading the Quixote I thought it was the most tragic book in the world, and I would read it and weep [...] As I grew older [...] my skin grew thicker [...] and so when I was working on the translation I was actually sitting at my computer and laughing out loud. This is done [...] as Cervantes did it [...] by never letting the reader rest. You are never certain that you truly got it. Because as soon as you think you understand something, Cervantes introduces something that contradicts your premise.|$|E
