5|$|Two {{neptunium}} chlorides, NpCl3 and NpCl4, {{have been}} characterized. Although several attempts to create NpCl5 have been made, {{they have not}} been successful. NpCl3 is created by reducing neptunium dioxide with hydrogen and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and NpCl4 by reacting a neptunium oxide with CCl4 at around 500°C. Other neptunium chloride compounds have also been reported, including NpOCl2, Cs2NpCl6, Cs3NpO2Cl4, and Cs2NaNpCl6. Neptunium bromides NpBr3 and NpBr4 have also been created; the latter by reacting <b>aluminium</b> <b>bromide</b> with NpO2 at 350°C and the former in an almost identical procedure but with zinc present.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of water vapour with Al-MCM- 41, prepared by direct synthesis {{at ambient temperature}} and pressure, using tetraethoxysilane, <b>aluminium</b> sulfate, hexadecyltrimethylammonium <b>bromide</b> and ammonia, {{and its effect on}} the pore structure were studied in order to investigate the stability towards prolonged exposure to water vapour and the influence of the aluminium content. With this purpose two consecutive water adsorption isotherms were determined at 298 K on samples with Si/Al ratio between 15 and 100. The samples were characterised by X-ray diffraction and adsorption of nitrogen at 77 K and toluene at 298 K, prior to and after exposure to water vapour. Pore size distributions were calculated from nitrogen, toluene and water adsorption isotherms using, respectively, the NLDFT method, a recently developed hybrid MC-DBdB method and the DBdB macroscopic approximation. It was found that Al-MCM- 41 samples are significantly stable and that the stability improves as the amount of aluminium increases. Upon prolonged exposure to water vapour, there is a small decrease in pore size (3 - 5 %), pore volume (8 - 16 %) and total surface area (3 - 7 %). The structural changes are essentially a consequence of the surface hydroxylation that occurred and not a result of a partial collapse of the pore structure. Although the presence of some extraframework Al can contribute to the improvement of the stability by protecting the surface, it was concluded that tetracoordinated Al plays an important role. The stabilizing effect of the Al incorporated in the walls can result from a higher degree of condensation {{on the surface of the}} pore walls and from the mild acidity generated...|$|R

5000|$|Exploit the {{chemical}} {{properties of the}} working fluid. A fairly new and novel exploit is to use exotic working fluids with advantageous chemical properties. One such is nitrogen dioxide (NO2), a toxic component of smog, which has a natural dimer as di-nitrogen tetraoxide (N2O4). At low temperature, the N2O4 is compressed and then heated. The increasing temperature causes each N2O4 to break apart into two NO2 molecules. This lowers the molecular weight of the working fluid, which drastically increases {{the efficiency of the}} cycle. Once the NO2 has expanded through the turbine, it is cooled by the heat sink, which makes it recombine into N2O4. This is then fed back by the compressor for another cycle. Such species as <b>aluminium</b> <b>bromide</b> (Al2Br6), NOCl, and Ga2I6 have all been investigated for such uses. To date, their drawbacks have not warranted their use, despite the efficiency gains that can be realized.|$|E
