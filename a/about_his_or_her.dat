Passive voluntary euthanasia is legal throughout the US per Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health. When the patient brings <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> own death with the assistance of a physician, the term assisted suicide is often used instead. Assisted suicide is legal in Switzerland and the U.S. states of California, Oregon, Washington, Montana and Vermont.|$|E
25|$|During a {{greeting}} ritual, {{the person who}} has entered the contact answers a series of questions <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> whole family, from the person who was already there. The answer is sewa, which means that everything is fine. Then the Dogon who has entered the contact repeats the ritual, asking the resident how his or her whole family is. Because the word sewa is so commonly repeated throughout a Dogon village, neighboring peoples have dubbed the Dogon the sewa people.|$|E
25|$|People with ORS misinterpret the {{behavior}} of others {{to be related to}} the imagined odor (thoughts of reference). In one review, ideas of reference were present in 74% of cases. Usually, these involve misinterpretations of comments, gestures and actions of other people such that it is believed that an offensive smell from the individual is being referred to. These thoughts of reference are more pronounced in social situations which the individual with ORS may find stressful, such as public transport, crowded lift, workplace, classroom, etc. Example behaviors which are misinterpreted include coughing, sneezing, turning of the head, opening a window, facial expressions, sniffing, touching nose, scratching head, gestures, moving away, avoiding the person, whistling. Commonly, when being in proximity to others who are talking among themselves, persons with ORS will be convinced that the conversation is <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> odor. Even the actions of animals (e.g. barking of dogs) can be interpreted as referential to an odor. Persons with ORS may have trouble concentrating at a given task or in particular situations due to obsessive thoughts concerning body odor.|$|E

Erikson has a positive outlook on this stage, saying that most guilt is quickly compensated by a sense of accomplishment.|$|R
25|$|An investigatory stop is {{a seizure}} under the Fourth Amendment. The state must justify the seizure {{by showing that}} the officer {{conducting}} the stop had a reasonable articulable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. The {{important point is that}} officers cannot deprive a citizen of liberty unless the officer can point to specific facts and circumstances and inferences therefrom that would amount to a reasonable suspicion. The officer must be prepared to establish that criminal activity was a logical explanation for what he perceived. The requirement serves to prevent officers from stopping individuals based merely on hunches or unfounded suspicions. The purpose of the stop and detention is to investigate to the extent necessary to confirm or dispel the original suspicion. If the initial confrontation with the person stopped dispels suspicion of criminal activity the officer must end the detention and allow the person to go <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> business. If the investigation confirms the officer's initial suspicion or reveals evidence that would justify continued detention the officer may require the person detained to remain at the scene until further investigation is complete.|$|E
500|$|Moral anti-realists {{debate whether}} the moral facts {{necessary}} to activate conscience supervene on natural facts with a posteriori necessity; or arise a priori because moral facts have a primary intension and naturally identical worlds may be presumed morally identical. It {{has also been}} argued {{that there is a}} measure of moral luck in how circumstances create the obstacles which conscience must overcome to apply moral principles or human rights and that with the benefit of enforceable property rights and the rule of law, access to universal health care plus the absence of high adult and infant mortality from conditions such as malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and famine, people in relatively prosperous developed countries have been spared pangs of conscience associated with the physical necessity to steal scraps of food, bribe tax inspectors or police officers, and commit murder in guerrilla wars against corrupt government forces or rebel armies. Scrutton has claimed that true understanding of conscience and its relationship with morality has been hampered by an [...] "impetuous" [...] belief that philosophical questions are solved through the analysis of language in an area where clarity threatens vested interests. Susan Sontag similarly argued that it was a symptom of psychological immaturity not to recognise that many morally immature people willingly experience a form of delight, in some an erotic breaking of taboo, when witnessing violence, suffering and pain being inflicted on others. Jonathan Glover wrote that most of us [...] "do not spend our lives on endless landscape gardening of our self" [...] and our conscience is likely shaped not so much by heroic struggles, as by choice of partner, friends and job, as well as where we choose to live. Garrett Hardin in a famous article called tragedy of the commons argued that any instance in which society appeals to an individual exploiting a commons to restrain himself or herself for the general good-by means of his or her conscience- merely sets up a system which, by selectively diverting societal power and physical resources to those lacking in conscience, while fostering guilt (including anxiety <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> individual contribution to over-population) in people acting upon it, actually works toward the elimination of conscience from the race.|$|E
2500|$|Handwritten correspondence, while once a major {{means of}} {{communications}} between distant people, is now used less frequently {{due to the}} advent of more immediate means of communication, such as the telephone or e-mail. Traditional letters, however, are often considered to harken back to a [...] "simpler time" [...] and are still used when someone wishes to be deliberate and thoughtful <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> communication. An example would be a letter of sympathy to a bereaved person.|$|E

5000|$|The word [...] "banitsa" [...] {{is used as}} a simile for {{something}} (mainly documents and paperwork) crumpled, or badly maintained. For example, a police officer can make a remark to someone <b>about</b> letting <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> passport [...] "become like a banitsa" [...] (станал е на баница); a teacher might say this about a pupil's notebook.The same can be said about a very badly crushed car after an accident.|$|R

They can spout all the current management buzzwords about supportive management but basically use it as a cover. By keeping their abusive behaviour hidden, any charges made by individuals <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> bullying will always come down to your word against his. They may have a kiss up kick down personality, wherein they are always highly cooperative, respectful, and caring when talking to upper management but the opposite {{when it comes to their}} relationship with those whom they supervise. Bullies tend to ingratiate themselves to their bosses while intimidating subordinates. They may be socially popular with others in management, including those who will determine ...|$|E
2500|$|POS {{can also}} be used to offer an {{explanation}} for organizational cynicism. [...] Organizational cynicism is related to job satisfaction; it is an attitude toward an organization reflecting one's beliefs <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> experience as part of the organization. [...] Just as POS explains employees' feelings of value, meaning, identity, etc., it explains employees' feelings of discouragement and distance from their organization. [...] Psychologist James Dean studied employees and found that the biggest cause of cynicism was change that was perceived to be out of the employee's control. Eisenberger and Rhoades found that changes made within the organization were less supported by employees when the changes were perceived to be out of their control.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{returning}} to the boardroom for the final stage, the host and his advisors continue interrogating the remaining players about their loss. The project manager is sometimes further interrogated <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> choice of teammates to bring back into the boardroom. Ultimately, at least one project manager and/or remaining teammate is [...] "fired" [...] at the host's discretion, and leaves the show. The host has broad discretion to fire candidates outside of this usual process, including firing multiple candidates at a time. The eliminated contestants are shown leaving the boardroom with their luggage and entering a taxi cab, during which they given time to recount on their elimination that is shown over the episode's credits.|$|E

An option in the menu can be toggled so this task can either be done manually or automatically by the game.

2500|$|Season Two Uncensored was {{released}} on September 25, 2007. Like the Season One set, the set features audio commentaries by Jeser and Silverstein along with assorted cast and crew members, as well as karaoke/singalong versions of the show's songs. The set also contains, {{in the words of}} the box art, [...] "potentially annoying" [...] commentary on the commentary for [...] "Terms of Endearment". The behind-the-scenes interviews in the set are the same ones that appear on Comedy Central's website, which feature each of the voice actors talking <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> character, along with a separate interview with creators Jeser and Silverstein. Tara Strong does two separate interviews, one for each of her characters (Princess Clara and Toot Braunstein).|$|E
2500|$|Dissociative fugue (formerly {{psychogenic}} fugue) is {{also known}} as fugue state. It is caused by psychological trauma and is usually temporary and unresolved, and therefore may return. An individual with dissociative fugue disorder is unaware or confused <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> identity and will travel in journeys away from familiar surroundings to discover or create new identities. [...] The Merck Manual defines it as [...] "one or more episodes of amnesia in which patients cannot recall some or all of their past and either lose their identity or form a new identity. The episodes, called fugues, result from trauma or stress. Dissociative fugue often manifests as sudden, unexpected, purposeful travel away from home." [...] While popular in fiction, it is extremely rare.|$|E

[...] "We {{recommend}} that one goal be {{to help the}} child feel more secure <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> actual gender, another {{to deal with the}} child's emotional difficulties, and a third to help with problems in the family. It's helpful to have parents set limits on things like cross-dressing, which many parents have not done before coming to us." [...] Zucker's follow-up of 50 treated children found that [...] "about 10 percent are still very unhappy about their gender, still cross-dressing, and thinking about having sex reassignment surgery" [...] as young adults. Zucker has stated that [...] "the therapist must rely on the 'clinical wisdom' that has accumulated and to utilize largely untested case formulation conceptual models to inform treatment approaches and decisions." ...|$|E

50|$|Where student-directed {{teaching}} differs is, again, in its progressive {{approach to}} student accountability. The Waldorf method, despite {{its efforts to}} improve education holistically differs in {{that there is still}} a set program to follow, flexible as it may be. Student-directed teaching is much more of a results-driven education system, where the choice is never not to work, but how to work; as long as the work required by the curriculum is being completed, each student is completely free to go <b>about</b> it <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> own way.|$|R

2500|$|Evidence-based {{medicine}} integrates {{an individual}} doctor's exam and diagnostic skills {{for a specific}} patient, with the best available evidence from medical research. The doctor's expertise includes both diagnostic skills and consideration of individual patient's rights and preferences in making decisions <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> care. The clinician uses pertinent clinical research on the accuracy of diagnostic tests and the efficacy and safety of therapy, rehabilitation, and prevention to develop an individual plan of care. The development of evidence-based recommendations for specific medical conditions, termed clinical practice guidelines or [...] "best practices", has accelerated {{in the past few}} years. [...] In the United States, over 1,700 guidelines (see example image, right) have been developed as a resource for physicians to apply to specific patient presentations. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom provides detailed [...] "clinical guidance" [...] for both health care professionals and the public about specific medical conditions. National Guideline Agencies from all continents collaborate in the Guidelines International Network, which entertains the largest guideline library worldwide.|$|E
2500|$|Based on {{a ruling}} by the Hoge Raad (Supreme Court), Verdonk said that Hirsi Ali did not have {{legitimate}} Dutch citizenship. According to the Hoge Raad, except under very special circumstances, Dutch citizenship could not be granted if the subject had lied <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> name and date of birth. In a broadcast on the Dutch public network, Hirsi Ali had admitted that she had lied about her name and date of birth in her application, {{and that she had}} been living with her family for 12 years in Kenya before arriving in the Netherlands, and had not arrived directly from Somalia, which at that time was experiencing civil war. The decision by Verdonk caused considerable controversy. VVD-deputy prime minister Zalm said he was surprised that events known for years suddenly resulted in action by Verdonk two days after a television program about Hirsi Ali's past. He said Verdonk has disqualified herself from being the prime candidate for the VVD in the coming elections. On May 16, 2006, Ayaan Hirsi Ali who was herself an MP for the VVD, as well as [...] Gerrit Zalm, criticized Verdonk for her decision to revoke Hirsi Ali's passport.|$|E
60|$|At the {{appointed}} hour next morning, every {{one on the}} Reef was astir at the first peep of day. No disturbance had occurred in the night, and, what is perhaps a little remarkable, the female sentinels had not given any false alarm. As soon as a look from the Summit gave the governor {{reason to believe that}} Waally was not very near him, he ordered preparations to be made for the launch of the Friend Abraham White. A couple of hours' work was still required to complete this desirable task; and everybody set <b>about</b> <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> assigned duty with activity and zeal. Some of the women prepared the breakfast; others carried ammunition to the different guns, while Betts went round and loaded them, one and all; and others, again, picked up such articles of value as had been overlooked in the haste of the previous evening, carrying them either into the crater, or on board the ship.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the author {{considers}} how the therapist might {{listen to the}} characters talked <b>about</b> by <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> patients. In psychoanalytic therapy {{the emphasis is on}} listening to the patient’s characters as though they are located in psychic reality and as representatives of the transference relationship, whereas in interpersonal therapy (IPT) the patient’s characters are taken as inhabiting the realm of external reality. It is argued that clinical thinking in IPT would be enhanced by taking more account of psychic reality, which will make clearer the quality of external reality in which the patient’s characters are located. It is also argued that both therapies share an interest in enabling the patient to find characters which can serve as holograms of previously unexpressed affective experience...|$|R
