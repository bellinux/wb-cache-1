25|$|Platinum {{was first}} used for minting coins in Spanish-colonized America. Following the {{discovery}} of platinum in gold rocks, the Spaniards were unable {{to use it for}} a long time because they had no technology for processing this metal. The then-cheap platinum was used for various kinds of frauds, such as substituting it for the more expensive silver. After the discovery that platinum alloys with gold, counterfeiters began to add it to gold coins. The platinum confiscated from counterfeiters was then thrown into the sea, in accordance with the royal decree of 1735. Later, the practice of adding platinum to gold as a ligature was adopted by the authorities in Spain in order to lower the gold content of coins.

As-prepared Pt–Sn bimetallic nanoparticles exhibit a single-phase fcc structure of Pt and heat-treatment leading to fcc Pt 75 Sn 25 phase and hexagonal <b>alloy</b> structure <b>of</b> the Pt 50 Sn 50 phase. Transmission electron microscopy image of the as-prepared Pt–Sn/C catalyst reveals a mean particle diameter of ca. 5. 8 nm with a relatively narrow size distribution and the particle size increased to ca. 20 nm when heat-treated at 500 ◦C due to agglomeration. The electrocatalytic activity of oxygen reduction assessed using rotating ring disk electrode technique (hydrodynamic voltammetry) indicated the order of electrocatalytic activity to be: Pt–Sn/C (as-prepared) > Pt–Sn/C (250 ◦C) > Pt–Sn/C (500 ◦C) > Pt–Sn/C (600 ◦C) > Pt–Sn/C (800 ◦C). Kinetic analysis reveals that the oxygen reduction reaction on Pt–Sn/C catalysts follows a four-electron process leading to water. Moreover, the Pt–Sn/C catalyst exhibited much higher methanol tolerance during the oxygen reduction reaction than the Pt/C catalyst, assessing that the present Pt–Sn/Cbimetallic catalystmay function as amethanol-tolerant cathode catalyst in a direct methanol fuel cell...|$|R
5000|$|In the 1870s and {{in light}} of modern precision, a series of {{international}} conferences was held to devise new metric standards.

40|$|Micrometre to sub-micrometre-scale <b>alloys</b> <b>of</b> <b>platinum</b> group {{elements}} (PGEs) {{known as}} Refractory Metal Nuggets (RMNs) {{have been observed}} in primitive meteorites. The Australian Synchrotron X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) beamline, {{in tandem with the}} Maia detector, allows rapid detection of PGEs in concentrations as low as 50 – 100  ppm at 2  μm resolution. Corroborating these analyses with traditional electron microscopy techniques, RMNs can be rapidly identified in situ within carbonaceous chondrites. These results dispute the assumption of most previous studies: that RMNs are unique to Ca–Al-rich inclusions (CAIs). We find that RMNs are, in fact, observed within all components of carbonaceous chondrites, such as the matrix, chondrules (consistent with observations from Schwander et al. (2015 b) and Wang et al. (2007)), and sulphides; though the majority of RMNs are still found in CAIs. The chemistry of RMNs reveals a complex diversity of compositions, which nevertheless averages to CI chondrite abundance ratios. This implies that RMNs are the dominant, if not sole host phase for PGEs. One hundred and thirteen RMNs from this study are combined with reported compositions in the literature, and compared to condensation model compositions similar to Berg et al. (2009), RMNs derived experimentally by precipitation (Schwander et al., 2015 a), host phase and host meteorite. Comparisons reveal only weak correlations between parent body processes (sulphidation) and nebular processes (condensation and precipitation) with RMN compositions. It appears that none of these processes acting in isolation or in tandem can explain the diversity observed in the RMN population. Our interpretation is that the Solar Nebula inherited an initially compositionally diverse population of RMNs from the Giant Molecular Cloud; that a variety of Solar System processes have acted on that population; but none have completely homogenised it. Most RMNs have experienced disk and asteroidal processing, but some may have retained a primordial composition. RMNs have been identified in pre-solar graphite grains (Croat et al., 2013). We anticipate that pre-solar RMNs will be present elsewhere in primitive meteorites...|$|R
