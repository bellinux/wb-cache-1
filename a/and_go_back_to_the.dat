25|$|About twelve {{kilometers}} {{northwest of}} Alişar Hüyük {{is another important}} archaeological site named Çadır Höyük. Excavators of Çadır Höyük have identified this site tentatively with the Hittite city of Zippalanda. Evidence of the first known settlement at Çadır Höyük has been radio-carbon dated to the Copper Age (c. 5000 BC – c. 3300 BC); nevertheless the occupation may well be even earlier than that, <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> New Stone Age (c. 5500 BC.) Çadır Höyük appears to have flourished during both the Middle Bronze Age (c. 2100 BC – c. 1550 BC) and Late Bronze Age (c. 1550 BC – c. 1200 BC.) The site was excavated from 1927 to 1932 by a team from the Oriental Institute of Chicago; excavation resumed in 1992, led by Ronald Gorny {{as part of the}} Alişar Regional Project, though most of the work has been at nearby Çadır Höyük.|$|E
25|$|The group {{decides to}} {{fight their way}} to the local marina, and travel on Steve's yacht to an island on Lake Michigan. They begin {{reinforcing}} two shuttle buses from the parking garage for their escape. However, they also need to pick up Andy, who is starving. They strap food and a walkie-talkie onto the dog, Chips, and lower him into the parking lot; the zombies have no interest in him. Chips gets into Andy's store safely but a zombie follows through the dog door, ultimately biting Andy. Nicole, fond of Chips, crashes the delivery truck into the gun store, where she is trapped by a zombified Andy. Kenneth, Michael, Tucker, Terry, and C.J. reach the gun store via the sewers and kill Andy, rescuing Nicole. They grab ammunition <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mall. Along the way, Tucker breaks his legs and C.J. shoots him out of mercy. Once inside, they are unable to lock the door, forcing an evacuation.|$|E
25|$|Wayne Rooney {{got himself}} on the scoresheet {{for the first time}} in three Premier League games the {{following}} weekend, scoring the opener in a 2–0 win over Reading. After a goalless first half, Rooney opened the scoring in the 77th minute, before Cristiano Ronaldo notched up his 23rd goal of the season to equal his tally for the previous season. The following game pitted United against Portsmouth at Old Trafford. With Arsenal having beaten Newcastle 3–0 the previous day, the onus was on United to pick up a win <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of the table. They started well, going 2–0 up within the first 15 minutes, but, despite what Sir Alex Ferguson claimed was one of the best performances of the season, they were unable to score again, and the game finished 2–0. Both goals were scored by Cristiano Ronaldo, who added the brace to the two he scored against Tottenham in the FA Cup the previous weekend, to take his total for the season to 27 goals in all competitions.|$|E

25|$|Season three premiered in the United States on July 14, 2006, {{picking up}} where season 2 ended. Having stopped the Wraith from {{reaching}} Earth and {{having failed to}} develop a working Wraith retrovirus, the expedition faces its third year in the Pegasus galaxy with the Wraith still a threat and a new, powerful enemy bent on destroying the expedition and Atlantis: the Asurans, self-replicating nanobots, also known as Replicators. The situation becomes complicated when an experiment gone awry drains their only ZPM, leaving them without a power source for the city's shields. Soon thereafter, they find a lost Ancient vessel and unwillingly turn over the city of Atlantis to its crew. The SGC sends General O'Neill and Richard Woolsey to try to negotiate an agreement between Earth and the Ancients to allow the expedition to return to Atlantis. The Ancients are then subsequently killed by an invading Asuran force while O'Neill and Woolsey send off a distress call to earth and go into hiding. The main members of the Atlantis expedition on Earth disobey their orders <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city, rescue O'Neill and Woolsey, and repel the Asuran invasion. The season finale starts off with Earth launching a first strike against the Asurans, who are building an armada to attack Earth. The Asurans counterattack by attacking Atlantis with a powerful beam weapon fired through a satellite housing a Stargate. As a last resort, the Atlantis team fires up the city's stardrive and escapes into space. The finale ends when the hyperdrive malfunctions, leaving the city flying through uncharted space with a day's worth of energy left in their sole ZPM and Dr. Weir critically injured.|$|E
25|$|Spike Dixon (Jeffrey Holland) Camp Comic – Spike {{was born}} on 12 September (year unknown) and brought up in Edgbaston with his {{childhood}} sweetheart Brenda, {{the daughter of the}} local butcher. After leaving school he gained a good position in the Income Tax office, but resigned in 1959 and joined the entertainment staff at Maplins. It is not known how long he had known Ted, but they were already well-acquainted by the time they travelled on the train to the camp and it was suggested that it was Ted who got Spike the job. Spike shared a chalet with Ted, and there were many humorous scenes between the pair in their chalet, such as Spike being kept awake by Ted's snoring. Spike often tried to branch out into his own style of comedy, designing and making his own costumes and funny sequences. These received mixed reactions from the campers, but Ted criticised almost all of them. Spike was a very honest and law-abiding man, and was {{the only member of the}} entertainment staff who didn't run his own scheme to scam the campers for money. Although he was loyal to Ted and willing to turn a blind-eye to his schemes, he was often shocked at the lengths Ted would go to in order to make money. Spike had to make an impossible choice between his job and the woman he loved during the 1959 season, when his girlfriend, Brenda, said she would marry him only if he gave up his job and went to work for her father's business. He chose his job and ended their relationship. During the 1960 season he became involved with April, one of the new Yellowcoats. At the same time, Spike also fell in love with Gladys, but this never amounted to anything. He continued his relationship with April, and she wanted him to leave Maplins <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> tax office so they could get married and have a steady income. As with Brenda, he again decided against this in favour of show business. Spike's immediate intentions after the 1960 season were left unknown, though he revealed he was going to join Ted over Christmas playing a Chinese policeman in a pantomime. It was also implied that he had resumed his affair with April.|$|E

I {{think that it was}} really nice for them to invite Astrid into the importance of that instead of keeping her in the dark. At least she knows that she's a part of this family and this affects her. I think she serves as a really important character in these later episodes because Astrid is kind of the only person that isn't directly involved with everything that is still on his side. She has {{to step up to the}} plate and be that comfort for him because if he doesn't have anyone there, he's basically going to regress <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> place, I think mentally, that he was in when he was in the mental institution.

500|$|When Homer and Marge [...] "snuggled" [...] to {{celebrate}} this development, she became pregnant. Homer {{was not happy}} {{when he found out}} about Marge's pregnancy, and was completely unenthusiastic about the impending birth. Because of the financial problems caused by the pregnancy, Homer was forced to make a sacrifice <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> power plant. However, Mr. Burns made Homer beg for his job back, and placed a large plaque in front of Homer's desk reading: [...] "Don't forget: you're here forever". Homer was once again unhappy at his work, but when Maggie was born, Homer instantly fell in love with her. Back in the present, Bart and Lisa still do not understand what {{that has to do with}} Maggie's photos. Homer merely mentions that they are in the place where he needs them the most. The scene then cuts to his workplace where all of the photos of Maggie are positioned on the plaque on the wall, which now reads: [...] "Do it for her".|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} an orchestral intro that {{introduces}} the first track [...] "Honeymoon Avenue", a downtempo song composed {{in the key}} of F-sharp major and set in a [...] time signature at a moderate tempo of 63 beats per minute. The song explores the 1950s musical style mixing doo-wop with an urban-inspired sound. Lirically, [...] "Honeymoon Avenue" [...] uses several metaphors to speaks about someone in a car being driven by her (romantic) partner. The driver is stuck to the same old route and driving mode that may make them crash. In interview with MTV, Grande explained its lyrics saying that [...] "Honeymoon Avenue" [...] "is about knowing you are {{at the end of}} a relationship and wishing it could not be the end <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> beginning and start over." [...] The second track [...] "Baby I" [...] is drenched in a [...] "retro sound" [...] from 1990s R and pop sonority. Lyrically, [...] "Baby I" [...] is a confession on Grande's behalf admitting a special love for someone and how she can't formulate her strong feelings into words. The elements of [...] "Baby I" [...] are further illustrated by its use of finger snaps, a syncopated beat, horns and drums.|$|E

2500|$|After {{the success}} of Interview with the Vampire (1976), Anne Rice wrote two {{extensively}} researched historical novels, The Feast of All Saints (1979) and Cry to Heaven (1982). Neither of them gave her the critical acclaim or the commercial success of her first novel; the main complaints about The Feast of All Saints were {{that it was too}} heavy and dense to read easily, and most of the reviews for Cry to Heaven were so savagely negative that Rice felt devastated. She had been thinking about a story set during the time of Oscar Wilde for the next novel, but decided to abandon it <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> erotic writing she had explored in the 1960s. Her idea was [...] "to create a book where you didn't have to mark the hot pages" [...] and [...] "to take away everything extraneous, as much as could be done in a narrative". To gain a creative freedom for the new work, Rice adopted the nom de plume A.N. Roquelaure from the French word Roquelaure, referring to a cloak worn by men in the 18th-century Europe. Rice came out as the author of the trilogy only sometime during the 1990s.|$|E
2500|$|After Joseph was born, Jacob {{decided to}} return home to his parents. Laban the Aramean was {{reluctant}} to release him, as God had blessed his flock on account of Jacob. Laban asked what he could pay Jacob. Jacob suggested that all the spotted, speckled, and brown goats and sheep of Laban's flock, at any given moment, would be his wages. Jacob placed rods of poplar, hazel, and chestnut, all of which he peeled [...] "white streaks upon them", within the flocks' watering holes or troughs in a performance of sympathetic magic, associating the stripes of the rods {{with the growth of}} stripes on the livestock. Despite this practicing of magic, later on Jacob says to his wives that it was God who made the livestock give birth to the convenient offspring, in order to turn the tide against the deceptive Laban. As time passed, Laban's sons noticed that Jacob was taking the better part of their flocks, and so Laban's friendly attitude towards Jacob began to change. The angel of the Lord, in a dream back during the breeding season, told Jacob [...] "Now lift your eyes and see [...] all the he goats mounting the animals are ringed, speckled, and striped, [...] for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you", that he is the God whom Jacob met at Bethel, and that Jacob should leave <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> land where he was born, which he and his wives and children did without informing Laban. Before they left, Rachel stole the teraphim, considered to be household idols, from Laban's house.|$|E
2500|$|Like all Nei Jia arts, Xing Yi {{is heavily}} {{influenced}} by Daoism. Its combat meditation methods (Zhan Zhuang) existed in similar forms in Daoism before being integrated into martial arts in later centuries. The whole theory behind [...] "using softness to overcome hardness" [...] and similar ideas have their origins in the Dao De Jing. Daoist concepts are readily implemented into actual training {{in the practice of}} Xing Yi. This can be discerned in the following paragraph by Sun Lutang: “Before training, [...] there is no thought or intention, no figure or image, no self or others, only Qi exists in the chaos of the body. The state is called WuJi in Xing Yi. Without knowing the principle of “inverse motion,” people always rigidly adhered to the principle of the “direct motion nature.” Hence the internal Qi is restrained and things cannot be properly realized due to an obscure mind that causes the body to be weak. They do not know the principle of health that extreme Yang leads to Yin and extreme Yin leads to death. However, sages can be versed in the way of inverse motion, and control the relation between Yin and Yang, manage the principal of creation, direct Liang Yi (another name for Yin and Yang), grasp the key points, <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> pre-natal from the post-natal realm to settle at the original position as the body becomes an integral unit. Its way is nothing more than the principle of stretching and contracting as in post-natal Wu Xing and Bagua boxing. This is called the generation of Qi from WuJi.” ...|$|E

Treadwell-Collins left on 6 May and O'Connor's first credited episode was broadcast on 11 July Although O'Connor's first credited episode aired in July, his own creative work was not seen onscreen until late September. Additionally, Oliver Kent was brought in as the Head of Continuing Drama Series for BBC Scripted Studios, meaning that Kent would oversee EastEnders along with O'Connor. O'Connor's approach to the show {{was to have a}} firmer focus on realism, which he said was being [...] "true to EastEnders DNA and [...] a way of capturing {{what it would be like}} if Julia Smith and Tony Holland were making the show now." [...] He said that [...] "EastEnders has always had a distinctly different tone from the other soaps but over time we've diluted our unique selling point. I think we need to be ourselves <b>and</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> origins of the show and what made it successful in the first place. It should be entertaining but it should also be informative—that's part of our unique BBC compact with the audience. It shouldn't just be a distraction from your own life, it should be an exploration of the life shared by the audience and the characters." [...] O'Connor planned to stay with EastEnders until the end of 2017, but announced his departure on 23 June 2017 with immediate effect, saying he wanted to concentrate on a career in film. John Yorke returned as a temporary creative director. Kent said, [...] "John Yorke is a Walford legend and I am thrilled that he will be joining us for a short period to oversee the show and to help us build on Sean's legacy while we recruit a long-term successor." ...|$|E
