5|$|The {{effects of}} <b>alcohol</b> <b>on</b> bees are {{sufficiently}} {{similar to the}} effects of <b>alcohol</b> <b>on</b> humans that honey bees have been used as models of human ethanol intoxication. However, the metabolism of bees and humans is sufficiently different that bees can safely collect nectars from plants that contain compounds toxic to humans. The honey produced by bees from these toxic nectars can be poisonous if consumed by humans. Many humans have eaten toxic honey and become seriously ill as a result.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of certain chemical substances—such as ethanol or pesticides or defensive toxic biochemicals produced by plants—to a bee's environment {{can cause the}} bee to display abnormal or unusual behavior and disorientation. In sufficient quantities, such chemicals can poison and even kill the bee. The effects of <b>alcohol</b> <b>on</b> bees have long been recognized. For example, John Cumming described the effect in an 1864 publication on beekeeping.|$|E
5|$|Advertising <b>alcohol</b> <b>on</b> {{television}} and in the press was outlawed under president Marc Ravalomanana. In order to maximize brand recognition of THB, the company altered the label for its Fresh shandy, which was exempt from this ban due to its low alcohol content, to match the THB Pilsener design but using a green background instead of the pilsener's red. The pilsener is advertised {{in a variety of}} non-traditional ways, such as through celebrity promotion in music videos and music and sporting event sponsorship. THB is considered by the public as a promoter of Malagasy culture and identity, particularly through its sponsorship of its annual THB Tour traveling music festival and the THB fête de la bière (beer festival). Three Horses Beer sponsors the THB Champions League, the national football championship. Many popular musical artists have advertised THB, including superstars Jerry Marcoss, AmbondronA, Samoëla, Tsiliva, Tence Mena and Jaojoby.|$|E

5|$|After Harrison {{returned}} to the United States from Colombia, he settled on his farm in North Bend, Ohio, his adopted home state, living in relative retirement after nearly four decades of government service. Having accumulated no substantial wealth during his lifetime, he subsisted on his savings, a small pension, and the income produced by his farm. Harrison cultivated corn and established a distillery to produce whiskey. After a brief time in the liquor business, he became disturbed by the effects of <b>alcohol</b> <b>on</b> its consumers, and closed the distillery. In a later address to the Hamilton County Agricultural Board in 1831, Harrison said he had sinned in making whiskey, and hoped that others would learn from his mistake and stop the production of liquors.|$|E
5|$|After enjoying life as {{a billionaire}} for a few days, Homer decides to throw a party before Burns returns. He heads to Moe's Tavern to buy some beer and invite his friends to the party. However, Moe informs Homer {{that he can not}} sell him <b>alcohol</b> <b>on</b> account of it being Sunday before 2:00 PM. After Homer is told {{the only way he could}} buy alcohol would be to sail out to {{international}} waters where there are no laws, he and his friends (including his son Bart) set sail in Burns' private yacht to throw the party there. Back at the Mayo Clinic, Burns discovers that he not only has all previously discovered diseases, but numerous new diseases the doctors have just discovered in him. However, the sheer number of diseases prevents any one disease from actually doing harm to him. This leads Burns to (incorrectly) conclude that he is indestructible, even though the doctors protest that even a slight breeze could disrupt the balance in his body.|$|E
5|$|As a player, Peel {{was very}} popular and admirers often entertained him socially; he became {{well known for}} liking <b>alcohol.</b> <b>On</b> {{the morning of the}} match that England won after {{following}} on, Peel was intoxicated and had to be sobered up. In 1897, he was suspended by Yorkshire for drunkenness during a match. Although it is unclear what exactly happened—Peel said he slipped when fielding, but Hirst later recalled that he came on the field drunk and when asked to leave, bowled a ball in the wrong direction—he never played for the county again. Decades later, a widely circulated story suggested that Peel urinated on the pitch before being sent away. Historians consider the story unlikely, and attribute it to a misunderstanding by its reporter. Peel continued to play and coach cricket {{for most of his life}} and in later years became associated with Yorkshire once again. Among his other jobs, he became the landlord of a public house and worked in a mill. He died in 1941 at the age of 84.|$|E

The present research examines the relationships among attitudes towards alcohol advertising, attitudes towards alcohol products, the perceived influences of <b>alcohol</b> advertising <b>on</b> the self, the perceived influences of <b>alcohol</b> advertising <b>on</b> others, and attitudes toward government restrictions <b>on</b> <b>alcohol</b> advertising. Data were collected from 578 Chinese college students via an online survey.

5|$|It {{is illegal}} in New Jersey {{to have an}} open {{container}} of alcohol in the passenger portion of a private automobile, but open bottles of alcohol may be transported {{in the trunk of}} a car, and consumption of <b>alcohol</b> <b>on</b> a bus, train, taxi, limousine, or boat is permitted. The penalty for having an open container of alcohol in a car is $200 fine for the first offense, and a $250 fine or 10 days of community service for repeat violations. The state Motor Vehicle Commission does not impose license points for open container convictions, but some automobile insurance companies impose a surcharge. New Jersey's law on open containers in motor vehicles is compliant with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), a federal act passed in 1998 which reduces the highway funding of states that do not prohibit open containers in passenger areas of automobiles.|$|E
5|$|Long-term {{misuse of}} alcohol {{can cause a}} wide range of mental health problems. Severe {{cognitive}} problems are common; approximately 10 percent of all dementia cases are related to alcohol consumption, making it the second leading cause of dementia. Excessive alcohol use causes damage to brain function, and psychological health can be increasingly affected over time. Social skills are significantly impaired in people suffering from alcoholism due to the neurotoxic effects of <b>alcohol</b> <b>on</b> the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex area of the brain. The social skills that are impaired by alcohol abuse include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, prosody perception problems and theory of mind deficits; the ability to understand humour is also impaired in alcohol abusers. Psychiatric disorders are common in alcoholics, with as many as 25 percent suffering severe psychiatric disturbances. The most prevalent psychiatric symptoms are anxiety and depression disorders. Psychiatric symptoms usually initially worsen during alcohol withdrawal, but typically improve or disappear with continued abstinence. Psychosis, confusion, and organic brain syndrome may be caused by alcohol misuse, which can lead to a misdiagnosis such as schizophrenia. Panic disorder can develop or worsen {{as a direct result of}} long-term alcohol misuse.|$|E

50|$|Because {{they have}} at least one {{asymmetric}} carbon center, aldoses with three or more carbon atoms exhibit stereoisomerism. Aldoses containing stereogenic centers can exist in either a - form or - form. The determination is made based on the chirality of the penultimate carbon (the second-furthest from the aldehyde), where <b>alcohol</b> groups <b>on</b> the right of the Fischer projection result in -aldoses, and epimers with <b>alcohols</b> <b>on</b> the left result in -aldoses. Biological systems tend to recognize -aldoses more than -aldoses.|$|R
