5|$|Birmingham is <b>a</b> <b>snowy</b> city {{relative}} to other large UK conurbations, due to its inland location and comparatively high elevation. Between 1961 and 1990 Birmingham Airport averaged 13.0 days of snow lying annually, compared to 5.33 at London Heathrow. Snow showers often pass through the city via the Cheshire gap on north westerly airstreams, but can also come off the North Sea from north easterly airstreams.|$|E

5|$|At {{the outset}} of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Wu wrote the {{patriotic}} war play City of Phoenix (凤凰城), which made him well-known in China at age 20. It {{was one of the most}} performed dramas during the eight-year war. He later wrote several critically acclaimed plays, including Return on <b>a</b> <b>Snowy</b> Night, which is generally considered his masterpiece. His works are strongly influenced by the May Fourth New Culture Movement.|$|E

5|$|On 4 December 1950, Hudner and Brown {{were among}} a group of pilots on patrol near the Chosin Reservoir when Brown's Corsair was struck by ground fire from Chinese troops and crashed. In an attempt to save Brown from his burning aircraft, Hudner {{intentionally}} crash-landed his own aircraft on <b>a</b> <b>snowy</b> mountain in freezing temperatures to help Brown. In spite of these efforts, Brown died of his injuries and Hudner was forced to evacuate, having also been injured in the landing.|$|E
5|$|The video starts {{showing a}} woman {{galloping}} through <b>a</b> <b>snowy</b> forest on horseback. She enters a warehouse where a cage surrounded by crows is suspended by chains. Nearby {{there is a}} trapped short-haired woman with a flayed face and crow-like eyes. The first woman stops under the cage {{and looks up at}} it. She casts a stone against a wall that reflects her like a mirror and the building collapses. In the snow, she finds a body—the second woman, inanimate and frozen—hidden under a blanket. She closes her eyes, plunges her hands into the body and pulls out a sword. Entering the forest, she sees numerous flying crows and ends up on <b>a</b> <b>snowy</b> plain on which there are erected many scarecrows. During the refrains, she uses her sword to destroy scarecrows, rip their sails and break the wooden crosses. Scarecrows' eyes weep black blood that turns to crows. Then, it is shown how the other woman was killed: the big peaks which covered the ceiling of her cage had gradually collapsed on her. Finally, the living woman plants her sword in the snow, then disappears into the air. Farmer plays the role of both women.|$|E

Following this, footage with two horses running free is shown, with her tossing {{her hair in a}} similar way to the animals' shakes. Over the rest of the music video, Stan further performs to the song, while band Havana make a cameo appearance and are seen in several scenes interspersed through the clip.|$|E

5|$|In December 1999, Stone was aboard an {{airplane}} which skidded off <b>a</b> <b>snowy</b> runway at O'Hare Airport in Chicago; {{there were no}} injuries. Stone began piloting ultra-light airplanes as a hobby in 1999 and 2000. In March 2000, he suffered a broken left ankle, cracked rib, concussion, and bruised kidney after crashing his plane in Robertson County, Tennessee, and was briefly hospitalized before he resumed touring. Stone later said that the accident made him decide to quit flying planes. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, rumors circulated that Stone had been {{on one of the}} hijacked planes; a spokeswoman for the singer confirmed that he was at home with his family that day.|$|E
5|$|The {{events in}} Arkham Origins take place {{about five years}} before , in midwinter Gotham City. Batman, an {{experienced}} crime-fighter {{in the second year}} of his career, is not yet the veteran superhero of Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. He is a mysterious force; even the police do not know whether he is a vigilante, a myth or a supernatural being. Batman has fought ordinary criminals and gangsters, and is accustomed to being stronger and faster than his opponents. However, on <b>a</b> <b>snowy</b> Christmas Eve he is confronted with more-dangerous foes: eight professional assassins hoping to collect a $50-million bounty placed on Batman's head by Black Mask. Villains (including the Joker) take advantage of the assassins' arrival to launch their own schemes, and Black Mask's henchmen instigate a rise in crime and gang activity in the city.|$|E
5|$|Toward {{the end of}} her career, Yancey made headlines. Yancey was {{at anchor}} near one stretch of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel near Norfolk on 21 January 1970. Driven by the winds in <b>a</b> <b>snowy</b> gale that gusted up to , Yancey dragged her anchors and hit the bridge, {{knocking}} it out of service for several weeks. The Navy started a free shuttle service for commuters that normally used the route, using helicopters and LCUs. Fortunately, there were no vehicles on the bridge {{at the time of the}} collision, and no one was injured. Sources do not report on any damage to Yancey from the incident, but any damages suffered must have been easily repaired, because the ship deployed to the Mediterranean a few months later.|$|E

5|$|Eames impersonates Fischer's godfather, Peter Browning, {{to suggest}} Fischer reconsider his father's will. Yusuf drives the van {{as the other}} dreamers are sedated into the second level. In the second level, a hotel dreamed by Arthur, Cobb persuades Fischer {{that he has been}} kidnapped by Browning and Cobb is his {{subconscious}} protector. Cobb persuades him to go down another level to explore Browning's subconscious (in reality, it is a ruse to enter Fischer's). The third level is a fortified hospital on <b>a</b> <b>snowy</b> mountain dreamed by Eames. The team has to infiltrate it and hold off the guards as Cobb takes Fischer into the equivalent of his subconscious. Yusuf, under pursuit by Fischer's projections in the first level, deliberately drives off a bridge and initiates his kick too soon. This causes an avalanche in Eames' level and removes the gravity of Arthur's level, forcing him to improvise a new kick synchronized with the van hitting the water. Mal's projection emerges and kills Fischer; Cobb kills Mal, and Saito succumbs to his wounds. Cobb and Ariadne enter Limbo to rescue Fischer and Saito, while Eames sets up a kick by rigging the hospital with explosives.|$|E
5|$|Favre led the Packers to a 13–3 {{regular season}} record, the NFC North championship, {{and the second}} seed in the NFC playoffs. Prior to the Packers' playoff game against the Seattle Seahawks, Favre stated his desire to {{continue}} playing football for another season. In the Divisional Playoffs, Favre threw three touchdowns as the Packers cruised to a 42–20 victory over the Seahawks at <b>a</b> <b>snowy</b> Lambeau Field. The Packers' season ended the following week when they suffered a 23–20 overtime loss in the NFC Championship Game to the eventual Super Bowl Champion New York Giants. Negotiating sub-zero temperatures, Favre amassed 236 passing yards and two touchdowns, but also threw an interception in overtime that set up the Giants' game-winning field goal. Favre's 90-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Donald Driver {{in the second quarter}} was the longest pass in Packers playoff history, and it extended Favre's NFL record for consecutive postseason games with a touchdown pass to 18. Favre stated after the game that he would make a decision more quickly than he has in the past regarding whether he would return for another season.|$|E
5|$|In October 1957, Hergé {{sent his}} publisher, Casterman, {{the cover of}} his {{completed}} nineteenth Tintin adventure, The Red Sea Sharks, and for several weeks considered plot ideas for his next story. Fondly recalling the Scouting days of his youth, his first idea was to send Tintin back to the United States, as in the third adventure, Tintin in America, to help a group of Native Americans defend their land from a large corporation that wished to drill for oil; on reflection, Hergé {{came to believe that}} retracing old ground would be a step backwards. Another idea had Tintin striving to prove that Haddock's butler Nestor was framed for a crime committed by his old employers, the Bird brothers. He dismissed this as well, but kept the idea of an adventure with no guns or violence—the only Tintin story without an antagonist. A third idea sent Tintin and Professor Calculus to a snow-covered polar region, where a stranded group of explorers need Calculus to save them from food poisoning. He abandoned this plot also, but kept the setting in <b>a</b> <b>snowy</b> environment and decided to focus, not on Calculus, but on his main character Tintin.|$|E

5|$|Stephen Decatur assumed {{command of}} President in December 1814, {{planning}} a cruise to the West Indies to prey on British shipping. In mid-January 1815, <b>a</b> <b>snowy</b> gale with strong winds forced the British blockading squadron away from New York Harbor, giving Decatur {{the opportunity to}} put to sea. On the evening of 14January, President headed out of the harbor but ran aground, the result of harbor pilots incorrectly marking a safe passage. Stranded on the sand bar, President lifted and dropped with the incoming tide. Within two hours her hull had been damaged, her timbers twisted, and masts sprung. Damage to her keel caused the ship to hog and sag. Decatur {{was finally able to}} float President off the bar and, assessing the damage, he decided to return to New York for repairs; however, the wind direction was not favorable and President was forced to head out to sea.|$|E
5|$|The pair {{defends the}} chosen nest site against other peregrines, and often against ravens, herons, and gulls, and if ground-nesting, also such mammals as foxes, wolverines, felids, bears, wolves, and {{mountain}} lions. Both nests and (less frequently) adults are predated by larger-bodied raptorial birds like eagles, large owls, or gyrfalcons. The most serious predators of peregrine nests in North America and Europe are the {{great horned owl}} and the Eurasian eagle owl. When reintroductions have been attempted for peregrines, the most serious impediments were these two owls routinely picking off nestlings, fledglings and adults by night. Peregrines defending their nests have managed to kill raptors as large as golden eagles and bald eagles (both of which they normally avoid as potential predators) that have come {{too close to the}} nest by ambushing them in a full stoop. In one instance, when <b>a</b> <b>snowy</b> owl killed a newly fledged peregrine, the larger owl was in turn killed by a stooping peregrine parent.|$|E
5|$|Upon its release, {{the song}} {{received}} mixed to positive reviews from music critics, {{many of whom}} praised Lee's emotional vocal performance and production; others described it as uninspired and mundane. The single achieved moderate commercial success, failing {{to appear on the}} main U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and entering the top 40 in several countries worldwide, where it spent several weeks charting. A music video directed by Paul Fedor was released in November 2006 and it features Lee and the band performing the song in <b>a</b> <b>snowy</b> forest. Lee eventually drowns in a lake full of black water which is meant to illustrate the song's lyrics about feelings of sorrow. The song was performed by the band as part of the set list on four of their five worldwide tours, namely The Open Door Tour (2006–07), the Evanescence Tour (2011-12), their fourth worldwide tour which took place in the period 2016-17 and the Synthesis Tour (2017-18).|$|E

5|$|Another of Gaudí's major {{projects}} and among his most admired works is the Casa Milà, {{better known as}} La Pedrera (1906–1910), commissioned by Pere Milà i Camps. Gaudí designed the house around two large, curved courtyards, with a structure of stone, brick and cast-iron columns and steel beams. The facade is built of limestone from Vilafranca del Penedès, apart from the upper level, which is covered in white tiles, evoking <b>a</b> <b>snowy</b> mountain. It has {{a total of five}} floors, plus a loft made entirely of catenary arches, as well as two large interior courtyards, one circular and one oval. Notable features are the staircases to the roof, topped with the four-armed cross, and the chimneys, covered in ceramics and with shapes that suggest mediaeval helmets. The interior decoration was carried out by Josep Maria Jujol and the painters Iu Pascual, Xavier Nogués and Aleix Clapés. The facade was to have been completed with a stone, metal and glass sculpture with Our lady of the Rosary accompanied by the archangels Michael and Gabriel, 4m in height. A sketch was made by the sculptor Carles Mani, but due to the events of the Tragic Week in 1909 the project was abandoned.|$|E
