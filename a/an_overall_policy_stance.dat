40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relative importance}} of monetary growth and exchange rate depreciation as causes of inflation in a sample of 10 Sub-Saharan African countries. Causality tests and impulse response functions derived from vector autoregression (VAR) analysis suggest that both monetary expansion and exchange rate adjustments cause inflation in a number of these countries. However, the failure of the tests to attribute the bulk of the variance in inflation in most of the countries to either variable suggests either a problem with the statistical technique or that some other factor [...] perhaps structural bottlenecks or <b>a</b> measure of <b>overall</b> macroeconomic <b>policy</b> <b>stance</b> incorporating both monetary and exchange rate policy [...] may be even more important as a determinant of inflation in African countries. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} in how far {{fiscal policy}} {{acts as an}} optimal stabilization tool in the European Monetary Union and {{how it could be}} improved. It is econometrically shown that even though sizeable automatic stabilizers exist in EMU, discretionary fiscal policy has counteracted these institutions {{in a way that the}} <b>overall</b> fiscal <b>policy</b> <b>stance</b> has been a-cyclical or even pro-cyclical. As a remedy, the paper proposes a EMU-wide unemployment scheme which could be easily blended into existing systems as to make it politically acceptable to all countries. In order to design such a system with optimal stabilization properties, structures and experiences of the United States unemployment insurance are analysed. Finally, the paper presents some estimates on required financial flows for an unemployment insurance for the euro area. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} how {{changes in}} interest rate and exchange rate, through Monetary Conditions Index (MCI), {{are used for}} assessing the <b>overall</b> monetary <b>policy</b> <b>stance.</b> The weights for construction of MCI are derived using the Johansen’s cointegration techniques. The constructed MCI indicates that Pakistan has eight tight and six soft periods of monetary stance during March 1991 to April 2006. Exchange rate movements and interest rate changes together determine MCI before September 2001. MCI moved largely with the changes in interest rate after the September 2001 events, as rupee appreciated due to surge in remittances and incomplete sterilization of forex flows led to unprecedented reduction in interest rates. MCI reflects tightening of monetary stance from January 2004 after the bottoming out of interest rates due to inflationary concerns...|$|R

The initial output recovery was led by import substitution {{as a result of the}} large exchange rate depreciation in 1998.

The legislation consists of three sections that represent <b>an</b> <b>overall</b> <b>policy</b> of facilitating union organizing, and by consequence, collective bargaining. The three sections provide for streamlined union certification, guaranteed first contracts for newly certified unions, and increased penalties for employer misconduct during the process.

40|$|Options {{represent}} a formal way of adding tem-poral abstraction to reinforcement learning. They {{have been shown}} to be successful in terms of accelerating learning and there is much promise in using them for knowledge represen-tation. In this paper, we will propose super-vised learning of option policies as an alter-native to existing methods. This provides an easy, intuitive way of transferring knowledge from a human expert to a reinforcement learn-ing agent. Moreover, the agent is not limited to mimicking the expert’s behavior (as it would be if supervised learning were to be performed for the whole task), since <b>an</b> <b>overall</b> <b>policy</b> is learned on top of both options and primitive ac-tions. Supervised option learning also has the advantage that the parts of the sensory input irrelevant to the subtask are detected automat-ically, thus allowing for generalization between similar structures in the same environment. ...|$|R
40|$|Because of the {{workings}} of health care systems, new, important, and cost-effective treatments sometimes do not become routine care while well-marketed products of equivocal value achieve widespread adoption. Should policymakers attempt to influence clinical behavior and correct for these inefficiencies? Implementation methods achieve {{a certain level of}} behavioral change but cost money to enact. These factors can be combined with the cost-effectiveness of treatments to estimate <b>an</b> <b>overall</b> <b>policy</b> cost-effectiveness. In general, policy cost-effectiveness is always less attractive than treatment cost-effectiveness. Consequently trying to improve the uptake of underused cost-effective care or reduce the overuse of new and expensive treatments may not always make economic sense. In this article, we present a method for calculating policy cost-effectiveness and illustrate it with examples from a recent trial, conducted during 1997 and 1998, of educational outreach by community pharmacists to influence physician prescribing in England. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{transmission}} of abundant global liquidity {{and the accompanying}} surge in capital flows to economies with comparatively higher interest rates and a stronger growth outlook pose policy challenges as appreciation pressures and rising asset valuations return. In addition {{to the influence of}} domestic growth prospects and liquidity conditions, this chapter finds strong links between global liquidity expansion and asset prices, such as equity returns, in the “liquidity-receiving” economies, as well as official reserve accumulation and portfolio inflows. There are a number of policy options available to policymakers of liquidity-receiving economies in response to surges in global liquidity and capital inflows. The menu of policy responses for mitigating risks related to capital inflow surges includes the following: • A more flexible exchange rate policy, in particular when the exchange rate is undervalued. The analysis shows that a floating exchange rate provides a natural buffer against surges in global liquidity and ensuing valuation pressures on domestic assets. • Reserve accumulation (using sterilized or unsterilized intervention as appropriate). • Reducing interest rates if the inflation outlook permits. • Tightening fiscal <b>policy</b> when the <b>overall</b> macroeconomic <b>policy</b> <b>stance</b> is too loose...|$|R

40|$|Many local {{authorities}} (LAs) are currently working to reduce both {{greenhouse gas emissions}} {{and the amount of}} municipal solid waste (MSW) sent to landfill. The recovery of energy from waste (EfW) can assist in meeting both of these objectives.

This paper addresses the impact of transporting MSW to EfW facilities, analysed {{as part of a larger}} decision support system designed to make <b>an</b> <b>overall</b> <b>policy</b> assessment of centralised (large-scale) and distributed (local-scale) approaches. Custom-written ArcMap extensions are used to compare centralised versus distributed approaches, using shortest-path routing based on expected road speed.
