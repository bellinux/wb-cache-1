5|$|Gandhi based Satyagraha on the Vedantic {{ideal of}} self-realization, ahimsa (nonviolence), vegetarianism, <b>and</b> <b>universal</b> love. William Borman {{states that the}} key to his satyagraha is rooted in the Hindu Upanishadic texts. According to Indira Carr, Gandhi's ideas on ahimsa and satyagraha were founded on the {{philosophical}} foundations of Advaita Vedanta. I. Bruce Watson states that some of these ideas are found not only in traditions within Hinduism, but also in Jainism or Buddhism, particularly those about non-violence, vegetarianism <b>and</b> <b>universal</b> love, but Gandhi's synthesis was to politicise these ideas. Gandhi's concept of satya as a civil movement, states Glyn Richards, are best understood {{in the context of the}} Hindu terminology of Dharma and Ṛta.|$|E
5|$|In late December 2009, The Walt Disney Company {{purchased}} Marvel Entertainment for $4 billion. In October 2010, Walt Disney Studios {{bought the}} distribution rights for The Avengers and Iron Man 3 from Paramount Pictures, with Paramount's logo {{remaining on the}} films, {{as well as for}} promotional material and merchandise, although Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures is the only studio credited at the end of these films. Disney has distributed all subsequent Marvel Studios films. In July 2013, Disney purchased the distribution rights to Iron Man, Iron Man 2, Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger from Paramount. The Incredible Hulk {{was not part of the}} deal, due to an agreement between Marvel <b>and</b> <b>Universal,</b> where Marvel owns the film rights <b>and</b> <b>Universal</b> owns the distribution rights, for this film as well as the right of first refusal to distribute future Hulk films. According to The Hollywood Reporter, a potential reason why Marvel has not bought the film distribution rights to the Hulk as they did with Paramount for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films is because Universal holds the theme park rights to several Marvel characters that Disney wants for its own theme parks.|$|E
2500|$|Definitions <b>and</b> <b>universals</b> vs. facts <b>and</b> defaults. <b>Universals</b> are general {{statements}} about the world such as [...] "All humans are mortal". Facts are specific examples of universals such as [...] "Socrates is a human and therefore mortal". In logical terms definitions <b>and</b> <b>universals</b> are about universal quantification while facts and defaults are about existential quantifications. All forms of knowledge representation must deal with this aspect and most do so with some variant of set theory, modeling <b>universals</b> as sets <b>and</b> subsets and definitions as elements in those sets.|$|R

25|$|Plato's early {{philosophical}} endeavors involved poetry discussing many ideas, such as {{the differences}} between knowledge and opinion, particulars <b>and</b> <b>universals,</b> <b>and</b> God and man. These early dialogues do not utilize conventional notions of reason. Rather, they appeal to the emotions, the allegorical, the spiritual, and the mythological interests of an ancient speculative mind.|$|R
40|$|Universals {{are usually}} {{considered}} to be universal properties. Since tropes are particular properties, if there are only tropes, there are no universals. However, universals might be thought of not only as common properties, but also as common aspects (“determinable universals”) and common wholes (“concrete universals”). The existence of these two latter concepts of universals is fully compatible {{with the assumption that}} all properties are particular. This observation makes possible three different trope theories, which accept tropes <b>and</b> no <b>universals,</b> tropes <b>and</b> determinable <b>universals</b> <b>and</b> tropes <b>and</b> concrete <b>universal...</b>|$|R

40|$|There {{cannot be}} a reductive theory of {{modality}} constructed from {{the concepts of}} sparse particular <b>and</b> sparse <b>universal.</b> These concepts are suffused with modal notions. I seek to establish this conclusion by tracing out the pattern of modal entanglements in which these concepts are involved. In order to appreciate the structure of these entanglements a distinction must be drawn between the lower-order necessary connections in which particulars <b>and</b> <b>universals</b> apparently figure, <b>and</b> higher-order necesary connections. The former type of connection relates specific entities. By contrast, the latter type of connection is unspecific: it relates entities to some others. I argue that whilst there may be techniques that succeed in providing reductive truth conditions for sentences that say particulars <b>and</b> <b>universals</b> figure in lower-order necessary connections, such techniques cannot succeed in providing reductive truth conditions for sentences that say these entities figure in higher-order necessary connections. I conclude that this situation leaves reductionists with a dilemma. If they wish to affirm that there are particulars <b>and</b> <b>universals</b> then the project of reducing modality by positing these entities must be abandoned. Alternatively, they may continue to deploy their usual reductive techniques but then they must abandon the doctrine {{that there is more}} than one fundamental category of entity...|$|R
