500|$|Pitchfork writer Stuart Berman {{stated that}} [...] "The Hungry Saws {{temperate}} approach {{feels like the}} work of a band who <b>are</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> a new lease on life, but not sure exactly what to do with it," [...] noting how [...] "the record turns increasingly more restrained, as it reconciles the band's well-established soul affinities with a more pastoral presentation" [...] while praising its [...] "beautifully rendered" [...] ballads. In his review for PopMatters, Michael Keefe opined that while [...] "all of The Hungry Saw finds Tindersticks trekking through fairly familiar territory...they find new diversions along the way." [...] Writing for Record Collector, Jake Kennedy said that [...] "The Hungry Saw marks a wonderful coming of age for Tindersticks...this is the sound of pure rejuvenation." [...] In a less complementary review, Shannon Zimmerman of Spin found that [...] "the first half of Tindersticks' latest is a can't-miss proposition" [...] but that [...] "the disc's second half descends into a morass of half-finished, melancholic curios that mostly go nowhere slowly." [...] Uncut critic Sam Richards was similarly unimpressed, offering that [...] "Tindersticks have returned refreshed, but some of the old dissolute glamour is gone." [...] This opinion was not shared by Tiny Mix Tapes, whose reviewing writer said that [...] "ultimately, it’s another Tindersticks record, and they’re still good after all these years. It’s not an incredibly remarkable record, but when a band is this consistent for this long, it’s hard to fault it." ...|$|E

500|$|In chapter seven Townsend {{details the}} sheer horror of China's ongoing civil war. Among the factions {{competing}} for power in China, Townsend believes {{that none of}} them, neither the leaders nor their men, have any fixed loyalties or higher motivations apart from desire for loot. With every man only out for himself and [...] "China's microscopically few good men... too weak to be felt", Townsend predicts {{no end to the}} chaos. Much of the violence, Townsend explains in chapter eight, is fuelled by opium, the addiction of one out of every eight Chinese. Peasants are often compelled to plant opium by local administrators and warlords to pay for their armies, {{to such an extent that}} many districts are more heavily planted with opium than food, and all the while KMT officials lie incessantly to the international community about their efforts to suppress the trade. In contrast to the depredations of the KMT and other warlords, in chapter nine Townsend praises the positive influence of the Japanese in China. The Japanese themselves are considered by him to be a loyal, brave, reliable, honest, and cleanly people, and thus the polar opposites of the Chinese. Townsend provides his own firsthand account of the Shanghai Incident of 1932, which he claims was probably provoked by Chinese aggression, and similarly sees the Japanese decision to invade Manchuria as a fitting response to the [...] "foredoomed contest of covert violence against the Japanese" [...] waged by Zhang Xueliang. Townsend also lavishes praise on the puppet state of Manchukuo as [...] "a blessing to the thirty million or so Chinese living there" [...] which has achieved [...] "stability and well-being for millions". Townsend concludes that informed observers <b>are</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> Japan's role in dealing with an unruly China.|$|E

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Sara A. Carter of Circa News, Bannon stated {{that he was not}} fired but rather submitted his two-weeks resignation on August 4, 2017. He reminded The Weekly Standard that he'd joined then-presidential candidate Trump's campaign on August 14, 2016, and said he'd [...] "always planned on spending one year," [...] but that he stayed a few more days due to the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Other sources state that White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly asked Bannon on August 18, 2017, to submit his immediate resignation in lieu of being fired. [...] In an official statement, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said, “... John Kelly and Steve Bannon have mutually agreed today would be Steve's last day. [...] We <b>are</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> his service and wish him the best.” The same day, Breitbart News announced that Bannon would return to the site as executive chairman. Several weeks after his departure it was reported that Trump still called Bannon, using his personal cell phone and only calling when chief of staff Kelly is not around, and The Washington Post reported in October 2017 that Trump and Bannon remained in regular contact.|$|E
2500|$|United States – The US Department of State {{announced}} limited {{support for}} the PYD in February 2016, although it opposes the unilateral establishment of a federal region in northern Syria. In March 2016, {{the day after the}} declaration of the Democratic Federation of Rojava - Northern Syria, U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter praised the Rojava YPG militia as having [...] "proven to be excellent partners of ours on the ground in fighting ISIL. We <b>are</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> that, and we intend to continue to do that, recognizing the complexities of their regional role." [...] The USA have usually supported the YPG militia in its fight against ISIL, both with air support in combat and with embedded US Special Forces. During the Northern Raqqa offensive (May 2016), US Special Operation Forces were widely reported and photographed taking part, wearing YPG and YPJ badges on their uniforms. When in June 2016 the Manbij offensive started, the Washington Post reported it under the headline of [...] "Ignoring Turkey, U.S. backs Kurds in drive against ISIS in Syria". On 7 November 2016, when asked about the federalization of Syria, Mark C. Toner, the Deputy Spokesperson for the US Department of State, said [...] "We don’t want to see any kind of ad hoc federalism or federalist system arise. We don’t want to see semi-autonomous zones. The reality is, though, as territory is liberated from Daesh, you got to get some kind of governance back into these areas, but by no means are we condoning or – any kind of, as I said, ad hoc semi-autonomous areas in northern Syria". According to lieutenant general Stephen J. Townsend of the United States Army in an interview on 29 March 2017, the US does not recognize Rojava as a [...] "Kurdish state" [...] but instead sees it as a [...] "multi-cultural, multi-party, multi-ethnic, multi-sectarian Syrian region being liberated from ISIS." ...|$|E

50|$|Finally, recent {{research}} has found that gratitude journal entries that address and answer the questions “Why <b>am</b> I <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> this?

Some studies have had participants use a template for writing in their journal entry. Following the “I <b>am</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> ___________, because ________________” template has been shown to result in increased happiness and subjective well being. Having deeper, more personal things to <b>be</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> yields greater happiness and increased gratitude.|$|R

6000|$|All this bears out {{the view}} that, {{in the mind}} of the old Israelite, there was no difference, save one of degree, between one Elohim and another.

[12] That they were familiar with this doctrine in the time of the captivity is suggested by the well-known reference of Ezekiel (xxxii. 27) to the [...] "mighty that are fallen of the uncircumcised, which are gone down to [Sheol] hell with their weapons of war, and have laid their swords under their heads."

6000|$|... “It {{is not a}} {{bit more}} {{perfunctory}} than the present system,” said Egbert; “I have only the same conventional language of gratitude at my disposal with which to thank dear old Colonel Chuttle for his perfectly delicious Stilton, which we shall devour to the last morsel, and the Froplinsons for their calendar, which we shall never look at. Colonel Chuttle knows that we <b>are</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> the Stilton, without having to be told so, and the Froplinsons {{know that we are}} bored with their calendar, whatever we may say to the contrary, just as we know that they are bored with the bridge-markers in spite of their written assurance that they thanked us for our charming little gift. What is more, the Colonel knows that even if we had taken a sudden aversion to Stilton or been forbidden it by the doctor, we should still have written a letter of hearty thanks around it. So you see the present system of acknowledgment is just as perfunctory and conventional as the counterfoil business would be, only ten times more tiresome and brain-racking.” ...|$|E

"Friedrich {{himself was}} so dangerous," [...] says the Constitutional Historian once: [...] "Friedrich, in {{alliance}} with France, how {{easy for him}} to catch Hanover by the throat at a week's notice, throw a death-noose round the throat of poor Hanover, and hand the same to France for tightening at discretion! Poor Hanover indeed; she reaps little profit from her English honors: what has she had to do with these Transatlantic Colonies of England? An unfortunate Country, if the English would but think; liable to be strangled at any time, for England's quarrels: the Achilles'-heel to invulnerable England; a sad function for Hanover, if it be a proud one, and amazingly lucrative to some Hanoverians. The Country is very dear to his Britannic Majesty in one sense, very dear to Britain in another! Nay Germany itself, through Hanover, is to be torn up by War for Transatlantic interests,--out of which she does not even get good Virginia tobacco, but grows bad of her own. No more concern than the Ring of Saturn with these over-sea quarrels; and can, through Hanover, be torn to pieces by War about them. Such honor to give a King to the British Nation, in a strait for one; and such profit coming of it:--we hope all sides <b>are</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> the blessings received!" ...|$|E
60|$|I strolled {{down the}} hill without meeting a creature, though I {{could see through the}} palings of the Common that that recreative expanse was peopled with dim forms. I remembered Mrs. Nettlepoint's house--she lived in those days (they are not so distant, but there have been changes) on the water-side, a little way beyond the spot at which the Public Garden terminates; and I {{reflected}} that like myself she would be spending the night in Boston if it were true that, as had been mentioned to me a few days before at Mount Desert, she was to embark on the morrow for Liverpool. I presently saw this appearance confirmed by a light above her door and in two or three of her windows, and I determined to ask for her, having nothing to do till bedtime. I had come out simply to pass an hour, leaving my hotel to the blaze of its gas and the perspiration of its porters; but {{it occurred to me that}} my old friend might very well not know of the substitution of the Patagonia for the Scandinavia, so that I should be doing her a service to prepare her mind.

6000|$|Thus the Cæsars {{and their}} {{fortunes}} put {{out to sea}} with their subs and their sad-eyed engineers, and their long-suffering signallers--I do not even know the technical name of the sin which causes {{a man to be}} born a destroyer-signaller in this life--and the little yellow shells stuck all about where they can be easiest reached. The rest of their acts is written for the information of the proper authorities. It reads like a page of Todhunter. But the masters of merchant-ships could tell more of eyeless shapes, barely outlined on the foam of their own arrest, who shout orders through the thick gloom alongside. The strayed and anxious neutral knows them when their searchlights pin him across the deep, or their syrens answer the last yelp of his as steam goes out of his torpedoed boilers. They stand by to catch and soothe him in his pyjamas at the gangway, collect his scattered lifeboats, and see a warm drink into him before they turn to hunt the slayer. The drifters, punching and reeling up and down their ten-mile line of traps; the outer trawlers, drawing the very teeth of Death with water-sodden fingers, <b>are</b> <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> their low, guarded signals; and when the Zeppelin's revealing star-shell cracks darkness open above him, the answering crack of the invisible destroyers' guns comforts the busy mine-layers. Big cruisers talk to them, too; and, what is more, they talk back to the cruisers. Sometimes they draw fire--pinkish spurts of light--a long way off, where Fritz is trying to coax them over a mine-field he has just laid; or they steal on Fritz {{in the midst of his}} job, and the horizon rings with barking, which the inevitable neutral who saw it all reports as [...] "a heavy fleet action in the North Sea." [...] The sea after dark can be as alive as the woods of summer nights. Everything is exactly where you don't expect it, and the shyest creatures are the farthest away from their holes. Things boom overhead like bitterns, or scutter alongside like hares, or arise dripping and hissing from below like otters. It is the destroyer's business to find out what their business may be through all the long night, and to help or hinder accordingly. Dawn sees them pitch-poling insanely between head-seas, or hanging on to bridges that sweep like scythes from one forlorn horizon to the other. A homeward-bound submarine chooses this hour to rise, very ostentatiously, and signals by hand to a lieutenant in command. (They were the same term at Dartmouth, and same first ship.) ...|$|E
