60|$|When it transpired that my Aunt Patience {{intended}} wedlock {{there was}} intense popular excitement. Every <b>adult</b> <b>single</b> male became {{at once a}} marrying man. The criminal statistics of Badger county show that in that single year more marriages occurred than in any decade before or since. But {{none of them was}} my aunt's. Men married their cooks, their laundresses, their deceased wives' mothers, their enemies' sisters--married whomsoever would wed; and any man who, by fair means or courtship, could not obtain a wife went before a justice of the peace and made an affidavit that he had some wives in Indiana. Such was the fear of being married alive by my Aunt Patience.|$|E

5000|$|The Waltham-Lowell system, {{as it was}} called, {{was greatly}} {{impacted}} both by economic instability and by immigration. A minor depression in 1834 led to a sharp reduction in wages, which in turn produced organization of the female workers {{and two of the}} earliest examples of a successful strike. A feature of such organization was the magazines and newsletters put out by the girls, the most famous of which was the Lowell Offering. Then later, when the Panic of 1837 necessitated a true drop in wages, many Lowell girls were replaced by the lower paid Irish [...] "biddies", or [...] "bridges". By 1850 the majority of workers at Lowell factories were poor immigrants. One result of this large scale laying-off was that now there were many <b>adult,</b> <b>single</b> women in society, who were used to earning their own money. It was only sensible that they seek other positions (teaching, etc.) in which to make money; and by doing so they further contributed to the birth of the working man.|$|E
