We adopt a {{previously}} developed model of deep syntactic and semantic processing to support question answering for Bahasa Indonesia, and extend it {{by adding a}} number of axioms designed to encode useful knowledge for answering questions, thus increasing the inferential power of the QA system.

We propose here a general class of growth models in which the various layers of a multiplex network coevolve {{through a set of}} non-linear preferential <b>attachment</b> <b>rules.</b> We show, both numerically and analytically, that by tuning the level of non-linearity these models allow to reproduce either homogeneous or heterogeneous degree distributions, together with positive or negative degree correlations across layers. In particular, we derive the condition for the appearance of a condensed state in which one node in each layer attracts an extensive fraction of all the edges. Comment: 15 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

It implies that the lattice has a few blocks which have astonishingly large number neighbors with whom they share common borders. Its construction starts with an initiator, say asquare of unit area, and a generator that divides it randomly into four blocks. The generator thereafter is sequentially appliedover and over again to {{only one of the}} available blocks picked preferentially with respect to their areas. It results in the partitioning of the square into ever smaller mutually exclusive rectangular blocks. the dual of the WPSL (DWPSL) obtained by replacing each block with a node at its center and common border between blocks with an edge joining the two corresponding vertices emerges as a network whose degree distribution followsa power-law. The reason for it is that it grows following mediation-driven attachment model rule which also embodies preferential <b>attachment</b> <b>rule</b> but in disguise.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{there is}} much {{research}} on network formation based on the preferential <b>attachment</b> <b>rule,</b> the research did {{not come up with}} a formula that, on the one hand, can reproduce shapes of cumulative degree distributions of empirical complex networks and, on the other hand, can represent intuitively theories on individual behavior. In this paper, we propose a formula that closes this gap by integrating into the formula for the preferential <b>attachment</b> <b>rule</b> (i. e., a node with higher degree is more likely to gain a new link) a representation of the theory of individual behavior with respect to nodes preferring to connect to other nodes with similar attributes (i. e., homophily). Based on this formula, we simulate the shapes of cumulative degree distributions for different levels of homophily and five different seed networks. Our simulation results suggest that homophily and the preferential <b>attachment</b> <b>rule</b> interact for all five types of seed networks. Surprisingly, the resulting cumulative degree distribution in log-log scale always shifts from a concave shape to a convex shape, as the level of homophily gets larger. Therefore, our formula can explain intuitively why some of the empirical complex networks show a linear cumulative degree distribution in log-log scale while others show either a concave or convex shape. Furthermore, another major finding indicates that homophily makes people of a group richer than people outside this group, which is a surprising and significant finding...|$|E

40|$|Purpose- The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to analyze empirically the structure of the Web 2. 0 service network and the mechanism behind its evolution over time. Design/Methodology/Approach - Based on the list of Web 2. 0 services and their Mashups that is announced on www. programmableweb. com, a network of Web 2. 0 services was constructed. Within this network, a node represents a Web 2. 0 service with an open API, and a link between two nodes represents the existence of a Mashup service that uses the two nodes. Findings - Our findings suggest that the evolution of the Web 2. 0 service network follows the preferential <b>attachment</b> <b>rule,</b> although the exponent of the preferential attachment is lower than for other networks following a preferential <b>attachment</b> <b>rule.</b> Additionally, our results indicate that the Web 2. 0 service network evolves to a scalefree network, but the exponent of the power law distribution is lower than for other networks as well. Originality/ value - The research applied social network analysis to the Web 2. 0 service network. It showed that its network structure and the evolution mechanism are different from those found in similar areas, e. g. the WWW. The findings imply that there are factors which lower the exponent of the preferential attachment equation and the power law distribution of the degree centralities. Research limitation/implications - However, we did not investigate the factors responsible for the low values of the exponent of the preferential attachment equation and the exponent of the power law distribution.

The theoretical part summarizes information covered in several grammars and describes especially the syntactic characteristics of the forms in question. In spite of their nominal character, non-finite forms keep the verbal characteristic, especially their valency, and they form secondary predications comparable to subordinate clauses. On the basis of these characteristics, the gerunds can be distinguished from nouns and the participles from adjectives.
