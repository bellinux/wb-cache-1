Using vision as a sensor enables the helicopter to track features in an urban environment. We use vision for feature detection and a combination of vision and GPS for navigation and tracking. The vision algorithm sends high level velocity commands to the helicopter controller which is then able to command the helicopter to track them. We present results obtained from flight trials that demonstrate our algorithms for detection and tracking are applicable in real world scenarios by applying them {{to the task of}} tracking rectangular features in structured environments. for vision-based tracking of features using an autonomous helicopter in a structured 3 D environment. In our experiments the helicopter (Figure I) is initialized in hover at an arbitrary location.

40|$|Though {{polarized}} {{dust emission}} provides valuable {{information on the}} morphology of the magnetic fields, it relies {{on the ability of}} dust grains to <b>align</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> The actual mechanism and local efficiencies are still not well known. Since the observed mm and sub-mm polarization results from a combination of different local magnetic field, density and temperature conditions along the line-of-sight and it is subject to dust optical depth effects, it is necessary to use 3 D models to constrain the robustness of dust polarized emission as a tracer, especially in highly inhomogeneous environments. Using cutting-edge numerical simulations (generated with the RAMSES code) of a magnetized collapse including the effects of the ambipolar diffusion we use the POLARIS code to produce maps of the Stokes parameters using different assumptions for the dust alignment mechanisms. We compare these results with direct integrations at different depths to obtain the mean magnetic field direction and strength. Finally, we present synthetic observations including instrumental effects which are directly comparable to available interferometric observations...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of the counteranion {{on the ability of}} the mesogenic cation 1 -methyl- 3 -dodecyl-triazolium to form mesophases is explored. To that avail, salts of the cation with anions of different size, shape, and hydrogen bonding capability such as Cl–, Br–, I–, I 3 –, PF 6 –, and Tf 2 N– [bis(trifluorosulfonyl) amide] were synthesized and characterized. The crystal structures of the bromide, the iodide, and the triiodide reveal that the cations form bilayers with cations oriented in opposite directions featuring interdigitated alkyl tails. Within the layers, the cations are separated by anions. The rod-shaped triiodide anion forces the triazolium cation to <b>align</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> in this crystal structure but due to its space requirement reduces the alkyl chain interdigitation which prevents the formation of a mesophase. Rather the compound transforms directly from a crystalline solid to an (ionic) liquid like the analogous bis(trifluorosulfonyl) amide. In contrast, the simple halides and the hexafluorophosphate form liquid crystalline phases. Their clearing points shift with increasing anion radius to lower temperatures...|$|E
40|$|GLBTI (gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, intersex) police liaison {{programs}} have been {{an important part of}} policing these communities for a number of decades now. In fact, this model appears to dominate approaches as the preferred way to manage relationships between GLBTI communities and police. Interestingly, while this model dominates, research on the effectiveness of this model, and the services that <b>align</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> is limited. To date, only few studies have asked critical questions about the effectiveness of GLBTI police liaison services. For instance, we know that over 70 % of GLBTI communities are aware of police liaison services, but only 4 % of those victimised access them (Berman & Robinson, 2010). This paper critically examines existing literature about GLBTI police liaison services to demonstrate key themes and omissions. It argues that police liaison services as a preferred model has been taken for granted as the correct way of engaging with GLBTI communities in ways that may exclude other forms of engagement, and suggests that further research into these liaison programs is necessary if the relationships between GLBTI communities and the police are to be strengthened...|$|E

Two extreme limits in the Reynolds number (25, 000 and 350, 000) were investigated. The rotation numbers investigated are 0, 0. 24, and 0. 039.

When there is no rotation, the flow and heat transfer in the bend were dominated by rib-induced secondary flows at the high Reynolds number limit and by bend-induced pressure-gradients at the low Reynolds number limit. Long streaks of reduced surface heat transfer occur in the bend at locations where streamlines from two contiguous secondary flows merge and then flow away from the surface. The location and size of these streaks varied markedly with Reynolds and rotation numbers...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} how neoliberal orders of discourse shape the dispositions to academic literacies {{of an international}} graduate student in entomology. As this ideology of market logic consolidates its hegemony in universities of excellence and US culture at large, academic socialization and disciplinary activities increasingly aim to create scholarly dispositions and subjectivities that <b>align</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> Such processes are further complicated by the backgrounds of international graduate students—an ever-larger proportion of graduate students in STEM who often hail from educational cultures {{significantly different from the}} U. S. Our analysis of an international graduate student’s literacy practices in terms of motivations and outcomes shows that his literacies echo the dispositions pushed by neoliberal ideologies, but are not over-determined by them. Rather, as our case study illustrates, his socialization is a layered process, with ambiguous implications and strategic calculations making up literacies and disciplinary outcomes. We believe closely mapping such tensions in literacies and socialization processes increases humanities scholars’ awareness both of the potential contradictions of educating international graduate students into the neoliberal model and of how the university can still be used to develop the dispositions needed to renegotiate the neoliberal order of discourse for more ethical and empowering purposes...|$|E
40|$|The {{dominant}} leader-centric theories {{suggest that}} implementing a vision requires an existing leader {{who not only}} develops a vision, but also actively supports followers as they modify their work roles to <b>align</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> (e. g., Bass, 1985; Conger 2 ̆ 6 Kanungo, 1987, 1998; Kirkpatrick, Locke, 2 ̆ 6 Latham, 1996).

Using Meindl’s (1995; Meindl, Ehrlich, 2 ̆ 6 Dukerich, 1985) romance of leadership theory as a guide, this study examines follower perceptions of vision and the ramifications of a leader’s departure {{during the height of}} vision implementation. Through qualitative analysis of 19 interviews, we explore followers’ identification, internalization, and commitment to a vision before and after a leader’s exit. Findings from this study suggest that internalization of the vision may lead to perceptions of misalignment between followers’ socially constructed under- standing of the vision and the leader’s strategy for implementation. Results further indicate that post-departure followers are likely to perceive the vision as strongly intertwined with the departed leader and less directly relevant to their work...|$|E
40|$|We {{explore the}} {{structure}} of magnetic field lines in and around filaments in simulations of molecular clouds undergoing global, multi-scale gravitational collapse. In these simulations, filaments {{are not in a}} static equilibrium, but are long-lived flow structures that accrete gas from their environment and direct it toward clumps embedded in the filament or at the nodes at the conjunction with other filaments. In this context, the magnetic field is dragged by the collapsing gas, so its structure must reflect the flow that generates the filament. Around the filament, the gas is accreted onto it, and the magnetic lines must then be perpendicular to the filament. As the gas density increases, the gas flow changes direction, becoming almost parallel to the filament, and magnetic lines also tend to <b>align</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> At the spine of the filament, however, magnetic lines become perpendicular again since they must connect to lines {{on the opposite side of}} the filament, resulting in "U"-shaped magnetic structures, which tend to be stretched by the longitudinal flow along the filament. Magnetic diffusive processes, however, allow the gas to continue to flow. Assuming a stationary state in which the ram pressure of the flow balances the magnetic tension, the curvature of the field lines is determined by the diffusion rate. We derive an expression relating the curvature of the field lines to the diffusive coefficient, which may be used to observationally determine the nature of the diffusive process.

40|$|This study {{evaluates the}} fabric defined by {{magnetite}} grains in a syntectonically deformed granite and deciphers {{the processes that}} led to magnetite fabric development. Anisotropy of anhysteretic remanence magnetization (AARM) analysis is performed in samples taken {{from different parts of}} the granite to establish that the magnetite grains define a fabric. Along with microstructural studies, the AARM data help conclude that this fabric is on account of shape preferred orientation (SPO) of the magnetite grains. The intensity of magnetite fabric (degree of anisotropy of the AARM ellipsoid) is higher in the southern parts as compared to the north, which is inferred to indicate a strain gradient. Electron back scattered diffraction (EBSD) analyses of magnetite grains were performed to determine if there are intracrystalline deformation features that could have influenced magnetite shape and SPO, and thus AARM data. Detailed crystallographic orientation data coupled with orientation contrast imaging did not reveal any subgrains and/or significant variations in crystallographic orientations within magnetite grains. Instead, grains exhibit fractures and are in places associated with quartz pressure fringes. Hence, neither the SPO nor the variation in the magnetite fabric intensity in the granite can be attributed to intracrystalline deformation of magnetite by dislocation creep. It is concluded that the magnetite grains were rheologically rigid and there was relative movement between the magnetite and the matrix minerals (quartz, feldspar and biotite). These matrix minerals actually define the fabric attractor and the magnetite grains passively rotated to <b>align</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> Thus it is demonstrated that the magnetite fabric in the granite stems from rigid body movement rather than dislocation creep. 13 page(s...|$|E
