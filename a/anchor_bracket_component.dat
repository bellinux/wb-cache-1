40|$|A non-proprietary, cable {{guardrail}} {{system is}} currently under {{development for the}} Midwest States Pooled Fund Program. A cable guardrail end terminal was necessary to accompany the cable guardrail system. The objective of this research project was to develop design recommendations for the cable end terminal. Bogie testing that was previously completed on a design concept indicated delayed cable release, which was an undesired performance that led to vehicle instabilities. Several design changes were recommended for better end terminal performance and to reflect the changes made to the cable median barrier. An LS-DYNA model of the modified cable end terminal was developed. Simulations of 0 - and 15 -degree impacts {{on the end of}} the cable <b>anchor</b> <b>bracket</b> with a bogie model indicated that the cables would release easily and not induce vehicle instabilities. This behavior still needs to be verified through bogie and full-scale crash testing. Simulations of a 25 -degree reverse impact between post nos. 2 and 3 with small car models indicated that cables did not release easily and may interlock around the car resulting in excessive vehicle decelerations or instabilities. Simulations of various line post designs found that the MWP and weakened MWP have lower forces and energies during impact than the S 3 x 5. 7 posts used in previous three-cable end terminals. This finding would suggest improved performance with respect to vehicle override and instability. However, vehicle simulations with multiple line posts impacted were inconclusive.

Specific problems are connected with architectural and esthetically driven requirements which lead to a strong search for compact and minimal configurations of structural parts like brackets.

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of air-powder polishing systems in 1977, air-powder polishing {{has been shown to}} be an efficient and effective method for removal of stain and plaque. Air-powder polishing systems use air, water, and sodium bicarbonate to deliver a controlled stream that propels specially processed sodium bicarbonate particles to the tooth surface. It has been demonstrated that this increasingly popular technique requires less time and less physical exertion by the operator than polishing with a rubber cup and prophylaxis paste. In addition, no heat is generated with this type of system. Studies of the air-powder polishing method have examined its efficacy in stain removal and its effects on soft tissue, hard tissue, and restorative materials. William et al. found that air-powder polishing treatment imparted a nonuniformly roughened surface to enamel. Atkinson et al. and Toevs, however, found root surfaces to be smooth after treatment with the airpowder polishing system. Furthermore, this system has been shown to produce some immediate soft tissue trauma. In all of these studies this gingival trauma {{has been shown to be}} transient and clinically insignificant. Although air-powder polishing systems have been shown to be effective, it has been demonstrated that these systems have the potential for removing considerable amounts of resinous restorative material. On the other hand, porcelain, amalgam, and gold alloy restorations generally are not significantly affected. However, Barnes and associates did note an erosion of cement from the margin of cast-alloy restorations. The purpose of this two-part study, based on studies to date that have shown deleterious effects on resinous materials and cement, was to examine the efficacy and effects of an air-powder polishing system on orthodontically bracketed and banded teeth. Orthodontically bracketed and banded teeth certainly provide a greater challenge for routine cleaning that may be met by an air-powder polishing system. Specifically, this study investigated the time required for removal of stain and plaque from orthodontically bracketed and banded teeth as well as the efficacy of the air-powder polishing system. In addition, the effects of airpowder polishing on composite and zinc phosphate cements used to <b>anchor</b> orthodontic <b>brackets</b> and bands were examined with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) ...|$|R

40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to design, test and deliver a final {{manufactured}} manual wheelchair brake that would {{not interfere with the}} propulsion path of the user or injure the hand of the user in any way. Existing brakes often interfere with the individual‚Äôs propulsion stroke and require frequent adjustments. Some brakes also cause injuries to the hands that could potentially be avoided with a tuck-away brake system. The MQP team first studied the forces involved in wheelchair propulsion and the stroke patterns of an individual using the wheelchair to create a set of functional requirements for the final design. Then, twelve conceptual designs were generated that addressed the gears, the spokes, the grips, the toggle bar, the mount, and the locking mechanism of the brake system. A design matrix was applied to determine the final three brake designs and engineering drawings were produced to assist with manufacturing process. The brakes that were manufactured were the Modified Quadra, the Bicycle Brake, and the Sliding Toggle Brake. The Modified Quadra was made up of five parts including the tube, the shaft, the handle, the brass cap, and the knurl brake. The Bicycle brake was composed of the support tube, the brake arm, and the mounting <b>bracket.</b> The <b>components</b> of the Sliding Toggle brake were the base tubes, the telescoping link, the brass-bearing link, the mount, and the modified handle for a four-bar toggle brake. Each manufactured brake was tested and evaluated according to the design specifications and recommendations were made according to analysis of the results and consultation with students and caregivers at the Massachusetts Hospital School. The recommendations made for the Modified Quandra indicated that the angle of the brake should be minimized in order to decrease the amount of friction to allow smoother motion of the braking mechanism. Recommendations for the bicycle brake involved the use of a larger brake caliper to allow for better gripping of the brake, as well as easier adjustment by the user. Recommendations made for the Sliding Toggle brake involved modification of the handle to allow for more stowage underneath the seat...|$|R
40|$|PhDThis thesis evaluates {{standard}} setting initiatives in {{corporate social responsibility}} or `CSR' engagements. Chapter 1 establishes how {{standard setting}} initiatives are developed through narratives of CSR. In chapter 2, the thesis unpacks hard and soft CSR which {{is seen as the}} key step to unlock the possibilities of standard setting. By showing that there is a nexus between hard and soft CSR, the regulatory divide is bridged. From here, CSR is seen to consist of internal and external narratives. When the narratives merge, standard setting can evolve in a coherent and meaningful way. In developing internal narratives, chapters 3 and 4 evaluate the normative-theoretical underpinnings of the corporation and examine how it can sustain the notion of the socially responsible corporation. The corporation is bounded by institutional roots, political limitations and legal parameters. The theoretical make up of the corporation, informed by historical insight, shows that the corporation is a real institution, capable of absorbing values from the community within which it operates and provides something back as a community member. External narratives are then discussed in chapters 5 and 6 {{in order to create a}} framework for the CSR actors to work together. Standards tend to be <b>anchored</b> within various <b>brackets,</b> including state borders and beyond, between public and private notions of authority as well as positive and negative aspects of responsibility. The rule of law holds the key towards providing legitimacy to these standards. Ultimately, chapter 7 looks at convergence in standards through the rigours of good decision making. A call for procedural integration is made through an administrative base which will be able to draw out a common language between the actors. Calibrating the internal and external narratives reveals the evolving nature of standards which attempt to reimagine the corporation as an institution of responsibility...|$|R
