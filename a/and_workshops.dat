5|$|Around AD1100, natives {{established}} adze quarries {{high up on}} Mauna Kea {{to extract}} the uniquely dense basalt (generated by the quick cooling of lava flows meeting glacial ice during subglacial eruptions) to make tools. Volcanic glass and gabbro were collected for blades and fishing gear, and māmane wood was preferred for the handles. At peak quarry activity after AD1400, there were separate facilities for rough and fine cutting; shelters with food, water, and wood to sustain the workers; <b>and</b> <b>workshops</b> creating the finished product.|$|E

5|$|In {{response}} to {{the announcement of the}} United Nations Partition Plan, Arab mobs stormed Mamilla Street on December 2, 1947, ransacking and setting fire to 40 Jewish-owned stores. Jewish merchants fled the area, which then came under heavy bombardment during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. With the cessation of hostilities, the area became a no man's land dividing the Jordanian-occupied Old City from Jewish West Jerusalem, until a truce was signed in 1952. In the 1950s, poor Sephardic immigrant families and tradesmen took up occupancy in the derelict buildings, <b>and</b> <b>workshops</b> and auto-repair garages replaced the former stores.|$|E

Elementary {{and high school students}} can expect to have one or two weekly hours of music teaching, generally in choral singing and basic music theory, though extracurricular opportunities are rare. Though most Italian universities have classes in related subjects such as music history, performance is not a common feature of university education.|$|E
