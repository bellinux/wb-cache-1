5|$|Abbas Kiarostami's film Ten (2002) was an {{experiment}} that used digital cameras to virtually eliminate the director. Kiarostami fastened cameras to the dashboard of a car, and then allowed his actors to act. There was no film crew in the car, and no director. There is no camera movement, {{other than the}} movement of the car which carries the camera. There is minimal cutting <b>and</b> <b>editing.</b>|$|E
5|$|After Pather Panchali, Ray {{went on to}} make 36 more films, {{including}} feature films, documentaries and shorts. He {{worked on}} scripting, casting, scoring, cinematography, art direction <b>and</b> <b>editing,</b> as well as designing his own credit titles and publicity material. He developed a distinctive style of film-making based, {{as was the case}} with Pather Panchali, on visual lyricism and strongly humanistic themes. Thus, Ray established himself as an internationally recognized auteur of cinema.|$|E

5|$|As {{a former}} comic strip illustrator, Deven used the {{storyboard}} technique {{to develop the}} film. Cinematography was handled by Arthur A. Wilson <b>and</b> <b>editing</b> by G. Sasikumar. P. Krishnamoorthy was signed up as the film's art director. S. Naveen, who later directed Moodar Koodam (2013), worked as an assistant director in the film. The dialogues for the film were written in chaste Tamil. Research was conducted at the Roja Muthiah Research Library.|$|E
5|$|Chase {{personally}} selected {{all of the}} show's {{music with}} producer Martin Bruestle and music editor Kathryn Dayak, sometimes also consulting Steven Van Zandt. The music was usually selected once the production <b>and</b> <b>editing</b> of an episode was completed, but on occasion sequences were filmed to match preselected pieces of music.|$|E
5|$|Four hundred {{prints were}} sold, {{so many that}} the negatives wore out twice, {{requiring}} the film to be re-shot each time. Two professional actors were paid to appear, and the film is cited as the first film to have used paid actors. The style of shooting <b>and</b> <b>editing</b> would {{bridge the gap between}} the styles of directors Edwin Stanton Porter and D. W. Griffith, and prints have been preserved in both the United States and the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Haley coauthored The Autobiography of MalcolmX, {{and also}} {{performed}} the basic functions of a ghostwriter and biographical amanuensis, writing, compiling, <b>and</b> <b>editing</b> the Autobiography based {{on more than}} 50 in-depth interviews he conducted with MalcolmX between 1963 and his subject's 1965 assassination. The two first met in 1959, when Haley wrote {{an article about the}} Nation of Islam for Reader's Digest, and again when Haley interviewed MalcolmX for Playboy in 1962.|$|E
5|$|Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will (1935)—documenting the 1934 Nuremberg Rally—and Olympia (1938)—covering the 1936 Summer Olympics—pioneered {{techniques}} of camera movement <b>and</b> <b>editing</b> that influenced later films. New {{techniques such as}} telephoto lenses and cameras mounted on tracks were employed. Both films remain controversial, as their aesthetic merit is inseparable from their propagandising of National Socialist ideals.|$|E
5|$|Music {{composer}} James Horner {{felt he was}} {{not given}} enough time to create a musical score. Horner arrived in England and expected the film to write the score in six weeks, which {{he thought was a}} sufficient amount of time. Horner, however, discovered that filming <b>and</b> <b>editing</b> were still taking place, and he was unable to view the film. He visited the sets <b>and</b> <b>editing</b> rooms for three weeks and found that editor Ray Lovejoy was barely keeping up with the workload for reasons of time restrictions. Horner believed Cameron was preoccupied with sound effects, citing that Cameron spent two days with the sound engineer creating the sounds for the pulse rifles. He also complained that he was given an outdated recording studio; the score was recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios, a 30-year-old studio that was barely able to patch in synthesizers or use the electronic equipment that Horner required.|$|E

5|$|Produced on {{a budget}} of 150-200million, Aadukalam was {{released}} on 14 January 2011 and grossed 300million according to a February 2011 report by The Economic Times.

5|$|Reviewers {{also gave}} credit to Elizabeth Sanders, Phipps' granddaughter and {{literary}} executor, for her skillful {{handling of the}} last two volumes. The purpose of the work becomes even more apparent and direct under her management <b>and</b> <b>editing</b> of the material. The role of the future marshals becomes more clear in the campaigns of 1797, and especially in the Italian campaign; her handling of the material kept it fully focused on the future marshals Massena, Augereau, Berthier, and Brune.|$|E
5|$|The Garden of Words was {{directed}} by Makoto Shinkai, who also wrote the original story and screenplay. He {{was responsible for the}} storyboards, animation composite, key animation, <b>and</b> <b>editing.</b> According to Shinkai, his numerous roles in the production of his works is due to the small size of the company, and in this film, it allowed him to tailor many elements of the film to more accurately portray his ideas.|$|E

5|$|The {{film was}} adapted from Oliver Goldsmith's novel The Vicar of Wakefield. The complex plot was broken down to a single-reel {{adaptation}} by Edwin Thanhouser and/or Lloyd Lonergan.

5|$|Upon Queen Victoria's death, Beatrice {{began the}} momentous task of transcribing <b>and</b> <b>editing</b> her mother's journals, {{which had been}} kept since 1831. The {{hundreds}} of volumes contained the Queen's personal views of the day-to-day business {{of her life and}} included personal and family matters as well as matters of state.|$|E
5|$|Dynamic editing {{contributed to}} the surrealistic nature of the episode. Abrupt cuts from {{close-up}} to extreme wide angles and sudden shifts from normal speed to super slow-motion are used in Buffy's dream: several sequences become slow-motion partway through them, then revert to normal speed as they continue. Xander's dream features mismatches between sound and image: characters are sometimes shown not speaking even as their voices are heard. Additionally, silence is used frequently, to both reflect the characters' disorientation and to unsettle the audience. Whedon cited films by Steven Soderbergh as his main inspirations for the odd editing, especially The Limey and The Underneath. He also listed Orson Welles' version of The Trial and Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut as inspirations for many of his shooting <b>and</b> <b>editing</b> decisions.|$|E

5|$|Greed was a {{financial}} disappointment. On its initial run, it earned $224,500 in the United States, $3,063 in Canada and $47,264 in other markets. In total it earned $274,827.
