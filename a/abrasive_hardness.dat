White cast iron with 1. 9 wt% Cr with austenitic and martensitic matrices, white cast iron with 13. 8 wt% Cr and 24. 4 wt% Cr and mottled cast iron, and four types of abrasive with different hardness were used in pin-on-abrasive paper tests at 4. 6 N of load. The microstructure of the alloys was characterized by optical microscopy and the micromechanisms of abrasive wear were characterized using scanning electron microscopy. The hardnesses of both the abrasive and the alloys were selected to obtain a HA/H range ratio (in which HA is the hardness of the abrasive and H is the alloys' hardness) much wider than the one {{reported in the literature}} until now. The relationship between wear rate and friction coefficient versus HA/H ratio was analyzed. The results show that when the HA/H ratio is less than 1. 9, an increase in <b>abrasive</b> <b>hardness</b> produces significant increase in wear rate. However, when the ratio HA/H is more than 1. 9, increasing the <b>abrasive</b> <b>hardness</b> has little effect on the wear rate. Comparing these results with the ones from the literature for homogeneous materials and hard second phase materials, the regions found in this study correspond to the severe wear region, the mild–severe wear transition, and a small mild wear region. A correlation between the friction coefficient and the HA/H ratio was found: the friction coefficient increases proportionally with the increase of HA/H to achieve a HA/H ratio of about 3. 3.

Appropriate tempering methods could {{improve the quality}} and quantity of flour extracted from sorghum. ^ In this study, the effects of cold water, hot water, and steam tempering on sorghum kernel physical and mechanical properties were studied. Single kernel characteristics (SKCS), <b>abrasive</b> <b>hardness,</b> structural changes, and texture of kernels were evaluated. SKCS hardness indices decreased from 75. 41 to a range of 53. 50 – 64. 20 after tempering. In terms of reducing the hardness value, hot water tempering was more efficient than the cold water tempering process. The <b>abrasive</b> <b>hardness</b> index, which represents the pericarp properties, did not show any correlation with moisture content. <b>Abrasive</b> <b>hardness</b> of steam tempered kernels increased from 14. 61 to 22. 11 when the time of treatment was extended. Smaller deformations and larger rupture forces were found for cold water tempered kernels, indicating the brittleness of cold tempered sorghum kernels. The energy required to rupture sorghum kernels increased (63. 41 – 70. 04 N. mm) when the duration of steam tempering was extended. Untreated sorghum kernels were associated with the lowest energy (35. 41 N. mm). Pericarp thickness decreased from 57. 98 mm (untreated) and 58. 49 mm (cold tempered) to 24. 49 – 37. 60 mm after hot water and steam tempering. The changes in pericarp structure and endosperm texture induced by steam tempering influence the kernel mechanical properties. ^ The effects of cold water, hot water, and steam tempering on the roller milling performance and flour quality of sorghum were also evaluated. Steamed sorghum had high bran yield with a larger proportion of bran particles after the milling process that might be due to the gradual scrapping of endosperm from the bran. Bran yield increased with increasing steam duration (from 1 to 2 min) but decreased at 2. 5 min steam treatment. Flour yield was not significantly different among the three treatments. Crude fiber content of the 1 -min steam tempered sorghum was 1. 28 ± 0. 09 %, which was significantly higher than that of flour obtained from cold water tempered sorghum (0. 87 ± 0. 19 %). The damaged starch content was the highest in the cold water treated (5. 96 ± 0. 24 %) sorghum and steam tempering resulted in a damaged starch content of 3. 63 – 4. 18 %. The circularity equivalent diameters of sorghum flour from different treatments mainly below 50 μm. Steam treatments for 1 and 2 min resulted in flour with more convex and circular particles compared to other treatments, indicating a better separation of starch granules from endosperm cells. Viscosity profiles of sorghum flour did not show significant differences among tempering treatments. Steam tempering of sorghum kernels at high temperature and pressure led to a better separation of bran and endosperm, without negatively impacting flour quality. ...|$|E

40|$|Sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L) Moench] is {{the second}} major cereal crop in Southern Africa after maize. Despite its {{importance}} as a cereal crop it is underutilised in Southern Africa because of insufficient characterisation and development of end-use quality evaluation methods for available cultivars, and the unattractive colour of some products from sorghum. This research aimed at developing simple methodologies for determination of important parameters of sorghum end-use quality, namely kernel hardness and kernel colour. The current research also set out to determine the cause for darkening of porridges made from white tan-plant sorghums and how this may relate to polyphenol oxidase activity. Sixteen Zambian sorghum cultivars grown during the 2008 and 2009 seasons of predominantly medium size, and ranging in colour from white to brown and red, {{with or without a}} pigmented testa were used. Endosperm texture of the sorghums determined by visual endosperm examination ranged from soft to hard. <b>Abrasive</b> <b>hardness</b> index values ranged from 6. 28 to 19. 64 and percentage water absorption ranged from 8. 43 to 26. 56 %. Percent water absorption was significantly and positively correlated (r= 0. 85, p < 0. 001) with endosperm texture and negatively correlated with <b>abrasive</b> <b>hardness</b> index (r=- 0. 89, p< 0. 01). The percent water absorption method could separate soft grains from hard grains just as well as endosperm texture and <b>abrasive</b> <b>hardness</b> index. The simplicity of the percent water absorption method makes it potentially usable by farmers and traders in remote areas where it can contribute to meaningful end-use quality assessment. The relatively dark colour of food products from white tan-plant (food-grade) sorghums can compromise their acceptability. The relationship between white tan-plant sorghum polyphenol oxidase activity (PPO) and porridge colour was investigated. Sorghums (including 28 white tan-plant samples grown in Zambia over two seasons), wheat and white maize were studied. Sorghum grain was intermediate in PPO between wheat and maize. When white tan plant sorghum and maize flours were cooked into porridges, they became darker with lower L* values. More importantly, the transition from white tan-plant sorghum flour to porridge caused a much larger reduction in mean L* value (27. 9) than that with white maize (16. 9). There were significantly negative correlations between all white tan-plant sorghum PPO activity and porridge L* values (r = - 0. 657, p < 0. 01) and between Zambian white tan-plant sorghum PPO activity and porridge L* values (r = - 0. 710, p < 0. 001). It is apparent that PPO activity in white tan-plant sorghums is an important determinant of the relatively dark colour of food products made from them, {{as is the case in}} wheat. Grain colour is an important quality indicator in sorghum-based foods and rural sorghum farmers in sub-Saharan Africa need simple, more accessible methods for its determination. The development of a simple quantitative method for sorghum grain colour assessment by analysis of the grains and their sodium hydroxide (NaOH) extracts was studied. Sixteen Zambian sorghums (white, red and brown types which were either tannin or non-tannin) from the 2008 and 2009 seasons and a Sudanese white tannin sorghum type were assessed for surface colour using Tristimulus colorimetry before and after treatment with NaOH. The NaOH extracts were also analysed using UV-visible spectrophotometry and reverse phase HPLC. Tristimulus colorimetry of the grain surface was able to distinguish white from coloured sorghums (brown and red) but was unable to separate tannin from non-tannin sorghum. UV-visible spectrophotometry and reverse phase HPLC of NaOH extracts from a representative set of the grains consisting of five sorghum types (red tannin, brown tannin, white tannin, red non-tannin and white non-tannin) separated the tannin from non-tannin sorghums regardless of grain surface colour. However, UV-visible absorption of NaOH extracts from the sorghum grains could not be related to grain surface colour as determined using Tristimulus colorimetry. Eleven phenolic compounds consisting of two flavan- 3 -ols, five anthocyanins and four 3 -deoxyanthocyanins were identified in the NaOH extracts using UPLC/PDA/MS. NaOH extract from Framida *SDS[3845] 23 - 2 - 1 (red tannin) contained all of the eleven compounds identified. The flavan- 3 -ols (catechin and +-catechin- 3 -O-gallate) were present in NaOH extracts of all the five sorghums. While some anthocyanins could be identified in NaOH extracts from all five sorghums, only Framida *SDS[3845] 23 - 2 - 1 (red tannin), Sima (white non-tannin) and MMSH 625 (red non-tannin) contained any 3 -deoxyanthocyanins. Total peak area due to anthocyanins and 3 -deoxyanthocyanins was higher for NaOH extracts from tannin sorghums compared to non-tannin. This was in agreement with the UV-visible spectrophotometry of the NaOH extracts which also separated the tannin from non-tannin sorghums. This shows that with NaOH treatment, it is possible to separate tannin from non-tannin sorghums. Colorimetry of NaOH extracts from sorghum may therefore be considered as a potentially simple and cheap alternative method for distinguishing tannin from non-tannin sorghums. The findings of this research provide a platform for the development of a system which promotes an integrated and inclusive approach in using the methodologies developed for sorghum end-use quality evaluation. The methodologies will form an integral part of the system which can be applied along the sorghum value chain in sub-Saharan Africa and involve various stakeholders such as the gene bank, sorghum breeders, cereal scientists and researchers, sorghum food processors, traders, rural farmers and consumers. The efficient application of this system could lead to increased sorghum production and utilisation and contribute significantly to food and nutrition security.

These multilayer coatings were investigated {{with regard to their}} morphology and composition as well as indentation <b>hardness,</b> <b>abrasive</b> wear, lubricant free friction and wetting behavior via contact angle measurements. The multilayer coatings exhibited lower wear rates and higher hardness values than a-C:H:Si:O or a-C:H:Si single layers and lower friction coefficients than pure a-C:H coatings under unlubricated test condition. Utilizing duplex processes, combining plasma nitriding pretreatment and a following coating deposition, the adhesion of the multilayer coatings on high speed and cold working steel substrates could be considerably improved...|$|R

An evaluation was conducted for the microstructure, material properties, and tribological performance of quasicrystalline materials formed from Al-Cu-Fe alloys. Arc melting was used as the fabrication technique for these alloys, and some samples were additionally heat treated in an argon environment. Vickers microhardness testing was done to make comparisons to wear rate behavior of the various alloys. Tribological studies were conducted using a linear pinon- desk configuration to evaluate friction and wear. Research indicated the annealed samples of Al-Cu-Fe that formed icosahedral quasicrystalline phases, where the quasicrystalline phase was most dominant of the observed alloys, displayed the greatest wear resistance and <b>hardness.</b> <b>Abrasive</b> wear was observed in each of the samples, as the brittle, hard nature of the quasicrystalline phase would not allow for the ductile adhesion. The addition of small amounts of Al-Cu-Fe quasicrystalline particles, crushed and pulverized from the arc-melted ingots, reduced the coefficient of friction and wear rate of UHMWPE, when added to the polymer...|$|R
40|$|The {{requirements}} for durable tool coatings continuously increase. In many cases, tool coatings combining different phases or several layers could provide {{an improvement in}} tool life. The broad range of mechanical properties of materials in the B-C-N and Ti-B-N ternary systems, from very soft to superhard, presents many possibilities to generate various combination coatings. Such coatings were prepared using reactive sputter techniques with different target materials. An outstanding example is a superhard 3 µm thick coating system with a 0. 5 to 0. 8 µm thick cBN top layer deposited on cutting inserts. Soft coatings like hexagonal boron nitride {{were found to be}} essential for machining operations under dry conditions. The coatings were characterized with respect to <b>hardness,</b> <b>abrasive</b> wear rate and friction coefficients. The correlation between properties and composition was revealed. Application test results of B-C-N and Ti-B-N coating systems on tools obtained under near production conditions will be reported. Specifically, turning tests performed with cemented carbide cutting inserts coated with a superhard coating system with a cBN top layer will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{recent advances}} on coating of tools for forming processes like deep drawing or clinching of aluminium {{and stainless steel}} sheets. Various carbon-based coatings, prepared by PECVD (RF and DC pulse mode (p-DC)) and by reactive DC Magnetron sputtering have been investigated with respect to <b>hardness,</b> <b>abrasive</b> wear resistance, adhesion properties and tribological behaviour under forming conditions. The softer and less wear resistant coatings exhibit the lowest adhesive wear and friction against aluminium and stainless steel counterparts. Application tests with coated tools were carried out under near production conditions. Correlation of mechanical test results with the film behaviour under service shows that for dry forming of stainless steel a high abrasive wear resistance of the hydrocarbon coating is necessary. No cold welding of the steel sheets on the tools was found, so that the aim of dry working is reached by these coatings. For forming of aluminium only softer a-C:H coatings show satisfying anti-galling properties. Especially {{in the case of}} aluminium working {{with a high degree of}} form change there is need for coatings with still improved anti-galling properties...|$|R
40|$|Abrasive {{machining}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} non-conventional processes for finishing. It is widely used in industry to machine the materials like mild steel, aluminum, copper, titanium, glass, hard rock material, graphite, composite material, ceramics etc. Like in abrasive jet machining. This technique uses jet which contains abrasive material. Now a day water-magnetic abrasive machining {{is one of the}} new alternative concepts that the magnetic field (line of magnetic force) is used to precisely machine the surface of the work-piece. When it is a magnetic work-piece and the work-piece is magnetized and then become a new magnetic pole. On the country when it is non-magnetic it cannot be magnetized. In this research the precise processing phenomenon and the condition on abrasive machining of material by a high velocity of water and magnetic abrasive and other <b>abrasive</b> material whose <b>hardness</b> and grain size similar to magnetic abrasive are examined. And the final experiment result shows the comparison between effectiveness of the mixing of water and abrasive on the surface finish of the AISI 52100 steel materials.

40|$|When a {{hard steel}} sphere over {{a range of}} impact {{velocities}} (80 - 100 m/s) and impact angles (15 - 90 °) is projected obliquely onto three ductile metal targets, {{the shapes of the}} plastic craters and the softening or hardening of the craters were measured. Their variations with impact angle were experimentally obtained. It is observed that a pronounced lip is formed {{at the end of the}} crater for an impact angle of 45 °in the three targets. It can be assumed that such a large lip will be easily detached during <b>abrasive</b> grit-blasting. The <b>hardness</b> at the crater periphery except for the lip and the interior of the crater were measured by means of a micro-vickers hardness tester. The hardness of a mild steel crater at an impact angle of 15 °is less for the residual tensile deformation due to the tangential component of the oblique impact than for the virgin specimen. The hardness of the craters of other soft metal targets except for steel increase with the impact angle. Cracks in the piling-up were observed using SEM. The impact and rebound angles of the sphere projectile were also measured using a CCD camera...|$|R
40|$|Artículos en revistasSilicon carbide (SiC) {{is used as}} {{reinforcement}} in {{polymeric materials}} due to its high resistance to <b>abrasive</b> wear and <b>hardness.</b> However, sometimes the lack of anchoring between the SiC particles and the polymer produces some negative effects. The unbonding particles can act as crack initiators. They also can increase the wear erosion. The aim of this work {{is to improve the}} adhesion between the epoxy resin and the SiC particles using a silane coupling agent to coat the ceramic particles. In this study, a room temperature curing two-component epoxy was used. SiC particles with a mean diameter of 10 µm were added to the epoxy resin in proportions of 6 and 12 % by weight. The organosilane used was ?-glicidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane (?-GPS). Strength was evaluated on bulk specimens by means of three-point bending test and hardness Shore D measurements. A pin on disk test was carried out to evaluate wear. Wear tracks as well as fracture surfaces of the materials were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Aluminium and steel specimens were also coated with the SiC/epoxy composites to evaluate its effectiveness as a wear-resistance coating. Pin on disk tests were done to study the SiC/epoxy composites' wear behavior. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|High rate {{deposition}} {{processes for}} hydrogenated diamond-like carbon films (a-C:H) were developed using microwave plasma enhanced CVD (PECVD) techniques. Basic investigations {{were carried out}} in a laboratory scale deposition apparatus (0. 04 m 3 chamber) and after that the processes were transferred to an industrial scale PECVD machine (1 m³) and optimized therein. The application of an asymmetric bipolar pulsed midfrequency substrate bias allowed controlling the ion fluxes to the growing films independently of the generation of film forming species (radicals and ions) by the microwave plasma source. After preliminary experiments using five different hydrocarbon precursors, more thorough investigations were done with the selected precursors acetylene (C 2 H 2) and isobutene (C 4 H 8; isobutylene, 2 -Methyl- 1 -propene). The a-C:H films were characterised with respect to deposition rates, <b>hardness,</b> <b>abrasive</b> wear rates, internal stresses and topography. Wear resistant, atomically smooth a-C:H films with a hardness above 25 GPa were deposited {{at a very high}} rate of 15 µm/h. The combination of high rate and high hardness values should be promising for industrial applications, even for in-line technologies. For the both mentioned precursors C 2 H 2 and C 4 H 8 some differences in hardness-rate relations were observed...|$|R
