500|$|When {{writing the}} {{screenplay}} for The Curse of the Black Pearl, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio envisioned Captain Jack Sparrow as a supporting {{character in the}} vein of Bugs Bunny and Groucho Marx. The producers saw him as a young Burt Lancaster. Director Gore Verbinski admitted, [...] "The first film was a movie, and then Jack was put into it almost. He doesn't have the obligations of the plot in the same ways that the other characters have. He meanders his way through, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> affects everybody else." [...] Sparrow represents an ethical pirate, with Captain Barbossa as his corrupt foil. His true motives usually remain masked, and whether he is honorable or evil depends on the audience's perspective. This acts as part of Will Turner's arc, in which Sparrow tells him a pirate {{can be a good}} man, like his father.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} leaked onto the {{internet}} in later October 2009 with several preliminary tracks from Raymond v. Raymond. [...] "Hey Daddy (Daddy's Home)", one of the tracks that follows-up Usher's divorce, and the change in content from Here I Stand, back to Confessions-style, was one of six tracks co-written by Rico Love for the album. In an exclusive with Rap-Up, Love said of Usher's return to that style, [...] "I feel like he’s got his mind right and it’s focused. He went through a lot. He had lost his father when he was creating the Here I Stand record, {{a lot of controversy}} with his marriage, he had kids, he parted ways with his mother’s management, and there were just {{a lot of things going}} on <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> lost focus. It’s not like Here I Stand wasn’t a good album. I just feel like he lost touch with his demographic." [...] According to MTV News, the song provides the reasons behind Usher's crumbling marriage as narrated in [...] "Papers". The remix version featuring Plies made its way onto {{the internet in}} late November, a few days before the song's radio and digital release.|$|E
500|$|Mandi Bierly, also of Entertainment Weekly, also {{praised the}} premiere and drew {{particular}} attention to the scene with Sarah confronting Adam about stealing her idea. She said the scene shows the writers and actors [...] "are not people afraid of letting an awkward, tension-filled scene breathe", and that kind of realism illustrates the strength of the show's writing and acting. Camille Wright Felton of CNN said she loved the show, and particularly praised the subplot about Haddie learning to drive, as well as Adam's response when Haddie asked if whether {{he and his wife had}} an agreement to ignore each other's flaws: [...] "Yeah, it's called marriage." [...] However, Felton criticized Baldwin's character, which she described as a [...] "single-minded boss who apparently exists as an island and doesn't get that people have families and need to tend to family crises". HitFix television columnist Alan Sepinwall felt the first half of the episode was too uneven in its mix of comedy and drama, but that it was later redeemed mainly by the scenes featuring Max, who he said [...] "is the one character on the show who never feels inauthentic, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> pulls everyone toward him". Sepinwall praised the performance of Max Burkholder as Max, but described William Baldwin's character as a [...] "caricatured playboy boss".|$|E

Aphex opened up another world that didn't involve my fucking {{electric}} guitar ... I hated {{all the music}} that was around Radiohead at the time, it was completely fucking meaningless.

The fact that he was proud to be a black man and that he had so much talent... made some people think that he was dangerous. But for those very reasons I enjoyed him." ...|$|E
2500|$|On his {{birthday}} in March, Ron accidentally eats Amortentia-infused Chocolate Cauldrons (actually meant for Harry). After being cured by Slughorn, he then consumes poisoned mead (which Draco Malfoy actually intended for Dumbledore). Harry saves his life by forcing a bezoar, a poison antidote, into his mouth, and Ron {{is transferred to}} the hospital wing. A panic-stricken Hermione arrives, forgetting her past anger. While sitting by his bed, Hermione, Harry, Ginny and the twins hear Ron mutter Hermione's name in his delirium, although they do not hear {{what he is saying}} and ignore it. Conversely, Ron feigns sleep when Lavender visits him. Upon recovering, Ron and Hermione reconcile, and a little while later, Ron and Lavender break up. Rowling in an interview said that she [...] "really enjoyed writing the Ron/Lavender business, and the reason that was enjoyable was Ron up to this point has been quite immature compared to the other two, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> needed to make himself worthy of Hermione....he had to grow up emotionally and now he's taken a big step up." ...|$|E

5000|$|He then {{appeared}} in the stage adaptation of Anton Chekhov’s Man in a Case. As he said: [...] "I grew up reading Chekhov's stories and plays. I have wanted to explore a Chekhov story for the stage {{for some time and}} I'm delighted to bring Man in a Case to Berkeley Rep. Both tales are about solitary men and their self-imposed restrictions. We know very little about the character in the first story, 'Man in a Case,' except that he teaches classical Greek <b>and</b> <b>he's</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> eccentric <b>and</b> conservative. But then something happens to him that is unexpected. The second story, 'About Love,' provides an arresting contrast to the first work. At their core both stories are about love. And I think it's a romantic show in many respects that is perfect for Berkeley Rep's audience." [...] Mikhail Baryshnikov.|$|R
6000|$|The {{other man}} {{appeared}} reflective. [...] "I was watching Saxton, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> woke up when Brooke let out about Devine. Now, {{it seems to}} me, it wasn't without a reason he put him on to that survey." ...|$|E

5000|$|In a Blastr interview, Dunne {{explained}} Will's journey {{throughout the}} first season, {{and what has}} become of him for the second; [...] "the first season he spent time {{getting used to the}} sanctuary and having his foot in both worlds, but not sure which way he was going to go. By the end of season one, he jumped right into the sanctuary and resigned himself to that life. Now there's a lot going on for Will. Already he's had to deal with some pretty major things. These things that happen in the first few episodes the second season dredge up some old memories of his past. There's definitely more of a darkness to Will, <b>and</b> <b>he's</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> wrestling with some demons."

I guess after the plane goes down, his world completely changes". [...] "Devon has an every man quality that makes him accessible," [...] Wong said. [...] "He doesn't appear as if he's supremely self-assured. [...] He's more of a regular kid who can take on the complexities of the role and become a hero". Perry was amazed by Sawa's vulnerability in acting, describing him as [...] "a very distinctive actor. <b>He's</b> very loose <b>and</b> <b>he's</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a cut-up when he's not on camera, but the moment the camera's on, I'd never seen anybody to completely slide right through the moment".|$|R
