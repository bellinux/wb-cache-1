5000|$|Ellul, Yoder and Archie Penner {{claim that}} two swords could not {{possibly}} have been [...] "enough" [...] to defend Jesus from his <b>pending</b> <b>arrest,</b> <b>trial</b> and execution, so their sole purpose must have been Jesus' wish to fulfill a prophecy (Isaiah 53:9-12). As Ellul explains: The further comment of Jesus explains in part the surprising statement, for he says: [...] "It is necessary that the prophecy be fulfilled according to which I would be put in the ranks of criminals" [...] (Luke 22:36-37). The idea of fighting with just two swords is ridiculous. The swords are enough, however, to justify the accusation that Jesus is the head of a band of brigands. We have to note here that Jesus is consciously fulfilling prophecy. If he were not the saying would make no sense.|$|R

Nine were killed at the airport, tonight. They’re all gone." [...] —After a series of conflicting reports and rumours, Jim McKay of ABC brought the news at 3:24 a.m. local time.

Although <b>arrested</b> and imprisoned <b>pending</b> <b>trial,</b> they were released by the West German government on October 29, 1972, in exchange for a hijacked Lufthansa jet. Two of those three were supposedly hunted down and assassinated later by the Mossad.

A memorial ceremony was then held in the Olympic stadium, and the competitions resumed after a stoppage of 24 hours.

Security at Olympics was heightened further beginning with the 2002 Winter Olympics, as they were the first to take place since September 11, 2001.|$|R
2500|$|In two {{articles}} {{appearing in the}} Pakistani newspaper The Express Tribune, the precise status of Davis's and the American Government's claim of immunity was examined by Najmuddin Shaikh, a former Pakistani diplomat. He wrote {{that the question of}} diplomatic immunity depended on whether Davis was {{on the staff of the}} [...] "consulate" [...] or the [...] "embassy" [...] as the privileges and immunities of each are very different. Shaik wrote that if Davis was on the staff of the [...] "embassy", the question of immunity would depend upon whether Davis was in Mozang Chowrangi in the [...] "course of his duties" [...] and questioned who should decide that. Regarding the law concerning if Davis was on the [...] "consular" [...] staff, a practising lawyer in Islamabad, Mirza Shahzad Akbar, referred to the Vienna Convention of 1963 in The News International, writing: “one needs to read Article 41 (1) which says: Consular officers shall not be liable to <b>arrest</b> or detention <b>pending</b> <b>trial,</b> except in the case of a grave crime and pursuant to a decision by the competent judicial authority. Now having read the law, there should be no doubt in anyone’s mind that if a member of US Consulate in Lahore kills someone, he is answerable to a court of law in that jurisdiction, as there is no other crime more heinous or more grave than murder." [...] Pakistani investigators took the position that Davis did not shoot the two men acting in self-defence and the police recommended he face a charge of double murder.|$|R
