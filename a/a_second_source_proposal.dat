40|$|We {{study the}} {{decision}} of a manufacturer (buyer), expecting new sourcing opportunities in the future, to select between a sole and <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> mechanism for <b>a</b> non-commodity component. In a sole sourcing mechanism, the buyer commits to source from the current supplier. In <b>a</b> <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> mechanism, the buyer keeps the option open to source from a new supplier in the future. For a buyer that sources complex non-commodity inputs, this decision has {{to take into consideration}} supplier capacity investment, uncertain demand, supplier learning, and information asymmetry on the supply cost. Considering these factors, we compare sole and <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> mechanisms, and identify when a mechanism is preferred over the other. We find that (1) both a high and low capacity cost may benefit <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> (under the condition that the entrant’s cost is relatively low), (2) <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> is favored more when the buyer faces a higher level or more uncertainty of the future demand, and (3) <b>second</b> <b>sourcing</b> may result in over investment of the initial capacity. ...|$|R
