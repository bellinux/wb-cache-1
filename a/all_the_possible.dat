5|$|Martínez Pérez {{was murdered}} {{early in the}} morning of 28 April 2012 in her home in the Felipe Carrillo Puerto {{neighborhood}} in Xalapa, the capital of Veracruz. When police went to her home to investigate in response to a neighbor's call about her door being open all day, Martínez Pérez's corpse was found on the bathroom floor. According to official reports, she had been severely beaten around her face and ribs, and then strangled to death. The cause of death was asphyxia by strangulation. At the time of her death, the Mexican authorities said they were investigating <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> motives behind her assassination, including personal motives and theft, and that they would investigate whether the killing was work-related.|$|E
5|$|There are an {{infinite}} number of other intermediate processes in which more and more photons are absorbed and/or emitted. For each of these possibilities there is a Feynman diagram describing it. This implies a complex computation for the resulting probability amplitudes, but provided it is the case that the more complicated the diagram the less it contributes to the result, {{it is only a matter}} of time and effort to find as accurate an answer as one wants to the original question. This is the basic approach of QED. To calculate the probability of any interactive process between electrons and photons it is a matter of first noting, with Feynman diagrams, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> ways in which the process can be constructed from the three basic elements. Each diagram involves some calculation involving definite rules to find the associated probability amplitude.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann {{founded the}} field of game theory as a {{mathematical}} discipline. Von Neumann proved his minimax theorem in 1928. This theorem establishes that in zero-sum games with perfect information (i.e. in which players know at each time all moves {{that have taken place}} so far), there exists a pair of strategies for both players that allows each to minimize his maximum losses, hence the name minimax. When examining every possible strategy, a player must consider <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> responses of his adversary. The player then plays out the strategy that will result in the minimization of his maximum loss.|$|E

The mean difference differs from the mean and standard deviation because it is dependent on the spread of the variate values among themselves and not on the deviations from some central value.|$|E

25|$|The Alaska {{boundary}} dispute, simmering {{since the}} Alaska purchase of 1867, became critical when gold {{was discovered in}} the Yukon during the late 1890s, with the U.S. controlling <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> ports of entry. Canada argued its boundary included the port of Skagway. The dispute went to arbitration in 1903, but the British delegate sided with the Americans, angering Canadians who felt the British had betrayed Canadian interests to curry favour with the U.S.|$|E
25|$|There are two clear {{limitations}} {{to the classical}} definition. Firstly, it is applicable only to situations {{in which there is}} only a 'finite' number of possible outcomes. But some important random experiments, such as tossing a coin until it rises heads, give rise to an infinite set of outcomes. And secondly, you need to determine in advance that <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> outcomes are equally likely without relying on the notion of probability to avoid circularity—for instance, by symmetry considerations.|$|E
25|$|The Venn diagram is {{constructed}} with {{a collection of}} simple closed curves drawn in the plane. The principle of these diagrams is that classes be represented by regions in such relation to one another that <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> logical relations of these classes can be indicated in the same diagram. That is, the diagram initially leaves room for any possible relation of the classes, and the actual or given relation, can then be specified by indicating that some particular region is null or is notnull.|$|E

His works formed an important foundation for the development of algebra and influenced later mathematicians, such as al-Karaji and Fibonacci.|$|E
25|$|The {{two-level}} approach involves {{engaging in}} critical reasoning and considering <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> ramifications of one's actions before making an ethical decision, but reverting to generally reliable moral rules {{when one is}} {{not in a position to}} stand back and examine the dilemma as a whole. In practice, this equates to adhering to rule consequentialism when one can only reason on an intuitive level, and to act consequentialism when in a position to stand back and reason on a more critical level.|$|E
25|$|Notice {{that the}} four ordered pairs (2-tuples) formed by the rows {{restricted}} to {{the first and third}} columns, namely (1,1), (2,1), (1,2) and (2,2) are <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> ordered pairs of the two element set and each appears exactly once. The second and third columns would give, (1,1), (2,1), (2,2) and (1,2); again, all possible ordered pairs each appearing once. The same statement would hold had the first and second columns been used. This is thus an orthogonal array of strength two.|$|E

25|$|Tlingit grammar {{at first}} glance appears to be highly fusional, {{but this is an}} {{incorrect}} assumption. There are predictable processes by which the basic phonetic shapes of individual morphemes are modified to fit various phonological requirements. These processes can be described with a regular language, and such descriptions are given here on a per morpheme basis by giving rule schemas for the context sensitive phonological modification of base morphemes. Analyzing <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> combinations of morphemes and phonological contexts in Tlingit and constructing a regular language to describe them is a daunting but tractable task.|$|E

Even natural spring water – considered safe for all practical purposes in the 19th century – must now be tested before determining what kind of treatment, if any, is needed. Chemical and microbiological analysis, while expensive, are the only way to obtain the information necessary for deciding on the appropriate method of purification.|$|E

25|$|The monads for {{collections}} naturally represent nondeterministic computation. The list (or other collection) represents <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> {{results from}} different nondeterministic paths of computation at that given time. For example, when one executes x <- , one {{is saying that}} the variable x can non-deterministically take {{on any of the}} values of that list. If one were to return x, it would evaluate to a list of the results from each path of computation. Notice that the bind operator above follows this theme by performing f on each of the current possible results, and then it concatenates the result lists together.|$|E
25|$|One may now ask: How many {{possible}} judgments are there? Kant believed that <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>possible</b> propositions within Aristotle's syllogistic logic are equivalent to all possible judgments, {{and that all}} the logical operators within the propositions are equivalent to the moments of the understanding within judgments. Thus he listed Aristotle's system in four groups of three: quantity (universal, particular, singular), quality (affirmative, negative, infinite), relation (categorical, hypothetical, disjunctive) and modality (problematic, assertoric, apodeictic). The parallelism with Kant's categories is obvious: quantity (unity, plurality, totality), quality (reality, negation, limitation), relation (substance, cause, community) and modality (possibility, existence, necessity).|$|E
