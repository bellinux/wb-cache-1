5|$|McCormick {{increasingly}} {{resented the}} favours FitzRoy gave to assist Darwin with collecting. On 16 February, FitzRoy landed a small party including himself and Darwin on St. Paul's rocks, finding the seabirds so tame {{that they could}} be killed easily, while an exasperated McCormick was left circling the islets in a second small boat. That evening novices were greeted by a pseudo-Neptune, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> they crossed the equator with the traditional line-crossing ceremony.|$|E

He goes to Rajni's office because she offered a 50-million-rupee dowry, and is {{relieved}} to discover that she is marrying someone else. Yogesh goes to Devu's house {{to tell him he}} wants to marry Vishakha, but Devu calls her and rejects her. He says {{there is no need for}} Yogesh to marry her; he knows about Jitu's debt, and says he will choose Yogesh's bride himself.|$|E

5|$|It {{had been}} {{decided that the}} Bergen Line, unlike the Voss Line, was to be built with {{standard}} gauge. So the newly laid line from Bergen to Voss had to be converted {{in time for the}} opening of the Bergen Line. This was especially challenging because of the continuous traffic on the line, with 36 departures per day to Nesttun, six to Garnes and four to Voss. In preparation a few curves had to be straightened, the tunnels widened and the bridges strengthened. On the night of 10/11 August 1904 all the track was changed <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> the trains could operate on standard gauge to Voss.|$|E
5|$|Raskolnikov is at {{this point}} {{completely}} torn; he is urged by Sonya to confess, and Svidrigaïlov's testimony could potentially convict him. Furthermore, Porfiry confronts Raskolnikov with his suspicions and assures him that confession would substantially lighten his sentence. Meanwhile, Svidrigaïlov attempts to seduce Dunya, but when he realizes that she will never love him, he lets her go. He then spends a night in confusion <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> shoots himself. This same morning, Raskolnikov goes again to Sonya, who again urges him to confess and to clear his conscience. He makes his way to the police station, where he is met by the news of Svidrigaïlov's suicide. He hesitates a moment, thinking again that he might get away with a perfect crime, but is persuaded by Sonya to confess.|$|E
5|$|With an {{apparent}} magnitude of −1.46, Sirius is {{the brightest star}} system in the night sky, almost twice {{the brightness of the}} second brightest star, Canopus. It is not as bright as the Moon, Venus, or Jupiter; at times, Mercury and Mars are also brighter than Sirius. Sirius can be seen from almost everywhere on Earth, with only observers north of 73 degrees latitude unable to see it, and it does not rise very high when viewed from some northern cities, reaching only 13° above the horizon from Saint Petersburg. Sirius, along with Procyon and Betelgeuse, forms one of the three vertices of the Winter Triangle to observers in the Northern Hemisphere. Due to its declination of roughly −17°, Sirius is a circumpolar star from latitudes south of 73° S. From the Southern Hemisphere in early July, Sirius can be seen in both the evening where it sets after the Sun, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> where it rises before the Sun. Due to precession (and slight proper motion), Sirius will move further south in the future. Starting around the year 9000, Sirius will no longer be visible from northern and central Europe, and in 14000 its declination will be −67° and thus it will be circumpolar throughout South Africa and in most parts of Australia.|$|E

25|$|At {{this point}} her history becomes confusing. Accounts differ on {{when and where}} the French {{captured}} Carrier.

25|$|Both {{historians who}} relate {{the attack on}} Delphi, Pausanias and Junianus Justinus, say that the Gauls were {{defeated}} and driven off.

Brennus was wounded and the Gauls fell back, killing those of their own wounded who were unable to retreat. That night, a panic fell on the camp, as the Gauls divided into factions and fought amongst themselves. They were joined by Acichorius {{and the rest of the}} army, but the Greeks forced them into a full-scale retreat. Brennus took his own life by drinking neat wine according to Pausanias, or by stabbing himself according to Justinus. Pressed by the Aetolians, the Gauls fell back to the Spercheios, where the waiting Thessalians and Malians destroyed them.|$|E
