Within this volume, Professor N. H.

Throughout the book, Fletcher's emphasis is on microphysical processes in cloud development and the production of precipitation. He writes engagingly on the dynamics and microphysics of clouds, the microstructure of non-freezing clouds, the processes of ice formation and the artificial modification of clouds, amongst other topics. Accordingly, this book will be of great interest to any modern physicists wishing to glean an idea of how the advanced study of <b>cloud</b> <b>physics</b> was first conducted, and how the first conclusions were drawn...|$|R

40|$|Spaceborne inferences {{of cloud}} {{microstructure}} and precipitation-forming processes with height {{have been used}} to investigate the effect of ingested aerosols on clouds and to integrate the findings with past <b>cloud</b> <b>physics</b> research. The inferences were made with a method that analyzes data from NOAA/AVHRR and TRMM/VIRS sensors to determine the effective radius of cloud particles with height. In addition, the TRMM/PR made it possible to measure the rainfall simultaneously with the microphysical retrievals, which were validated by aircraft <b>cloud</b> <b>physics</b> measurements under a wide range of conditions. For example, the satellite inferences suggest that vigorous convective clouds over many portions of the globe remain supercooled to near 2 – 38 oC, the point of homogeneous nucleation. These inferences were then validated in Texas and Argentina by in-situ measurements using a <b>cloud</b> <b>physics</b> jet aircraft. This unique satellite vantage point has documented enormous variability of cloud conditions in space and time and the strong susceptibility of cloud microstructure and precipitation to the ingested aerosols. This is in agreement with past cloud physic...|$|R
