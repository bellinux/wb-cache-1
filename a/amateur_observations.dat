500|$|Halley's 1986 {{apparition}} was {{the least}} favorable on record. The comet and Earth were {{on opposite sides of}} the Sun in February 1986, creating the worst viewing circumstances for Earth observers for the last 2,000 years. Halley's closest approach was 0.42 AU. [...] Additionally, with increased light pollution from urbanization, many people failed to even see the comet. It was possible to observe it in areas outside of cities with the help of binoculars. Further, the comet appeared brightest when it was almost invisible from the northern hemisphere in March and April. Halley's approach was first detected by astronomers David Jewitt and G. Edward Danielson on 16 October 1982 using the 5.1m Hale telescope at Mount Palomar and a CCD camera. The first person to visually observe the comet on its 1986 return was amateur astronomer Stephen James O'Meara on 24 January 1985. O'Meara used a home-built 24-inch telescope on top of Mauna Kea to detect the magnitude 19.6 comet. On 8 November 1985, Stephen Edberg (then serving as the Coordinator for <b>Amateur</b> <b>Observations</b> at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory) and Charles Morris were the first to observe Halley's Comet with the naked eye in its 1986 apparition.|$|E

40|$|Since 2003 the Planetary Virtual Observatory and Laboratory (PVOL) {{has been}} storing and serving {{publicly}} through {{its web site}} a large database of <b>amateur</b> <b>observations</b> of the Giant Planets (Hueso et al., 2010 a). These images are used for scientific research of the atmospheric dynamics and cloud structure on these planets and constitute a powerful resource to address time changing phenomena in their atmospheres. Advances {{over the last decade}} in observation techniques, and a wider conscience by professional astronomers of the quality of <b>amateur</b> <b>observations,</b> have resulted in the necessity to upgrade this database. We here present major advances in the PVOL database that has evolved into a full virtual planetary observatory encompassing also observations of Mercury, Venus, Mars, the Moon and the Galilean satellites.

The new web service: PVOL 2 is available online in [URL], contains a fully functional search engine and constitutes one of the many services included in VESPA (Virtual Europan Solar and Planetary Access). Data from PVOL 2 can be served from the VESPA portal using the EPN-TAP protocol.

25|$|Since looking {{directly}} at the Sun {{with the naked eye}} permanently damages human vision, <b>amateur</b> <b>observation</b> of sunspots is generally conducted using projected images, or directly through protective filters. Small sections of very dark filter glass, such as a #14 welder's glass, are effective. A telescope eyepiece can project the image, without filtration, onto a white screen where it can be viewed indirectly, and even traced, to follow sunspot evolution. Special purpose hydrogen-alpha narrow bandpass filters and aluminum-coated glass attenuation filters (which have the appearance of mirrors due to their extremely high optical density) on the front of a telescope provide safe observation through the eyepiece.|$|R

We review some of the developments that push meteor science into the Big Data era that requires more complex methodological approaches through interdisciplinary collaborations with other branches of physics and computer science. We argue that meteor science should {{become an integral part of}} large surveys in astronomy, aeronomy and space physics, and tackle the complexity of micro-physics of meteor plasma and its interaction with the atmosphere. The recent increased interest in meteor science triggered by the Chelyabinsk fireball helps in building the case for technologically and logistically more ambitious meteor projects. This requires developing new methodological approaches in meteor research, with Big Data science and close collaboration between citizen science, geoscience and astronomy as critical elements.
