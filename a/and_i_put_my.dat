500|$|In interviews, Hendrix usually gave {{different}} {{answers about}} the development of the song's lyrics. [...] Biographer Harry Shapiro points out that [...] "Purple Haze" [...] is most likely [...] "a pot-pourri of ideas" [...] which Hendrix developed over time. [...] As a fan of science fiction, he frequently incorporated its imagery in his songwriting. [...] Hendrix read Night of Light, a 1966 novel by Philip Jose Farmer, that expanded on a short story published in 1957. [...] In the story set on a distant planet, sunspots produce a [...] "purplish haze" [...] which has a disorienting effect on the inhabitants. [...] An early handwritten draft by Hendrix, titled [...] "Purple Haze – Jesus Saves", uses dream-like imagery where the sense of direction and time is distorted. [...] In an interview on January 28, 1967, before the song was completed, Hendrix was asked how he wrote songs; he responded, [...] "I dream a lot <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> dreams down as songs. I wrote one called 'First Look Around the Corner' and another called 'The Purple Haze,' which was about a dream I had that I was walking under the sea." [...] He later expressed frustration that he was unable to more fully develop his ideas for the song: ...|$|E

You speak of another country, {{but it is not}} my country; it does not concern me, and I {{want nothing to do with}} it. I was not born there.... If it is such a good country, you ought to send the white men now in our country there and let us alone.” ...|$|E
2500|$|IDF {{chief of}} staff (Ramatkal) Shaul Mofaz urged the {{officers}} to speed things up. They asked for twenty-four more hours. Mofaz told reporters that the fighting would be complete {{by the end of}} the week, April 6. In some of the sectors, the forces were advancing at a rate of fifty meters a day. Israeli intelligence assumed that the vast majority of the camp's residents were still in it. Most commanders argued that this obligated a careful advance for fear of striking civilians, and warned that using excessive force would cost the lives of hundreds of Palestinians. Lieutenant Colonel Ofek Buchris, commander of the 51st Battalion, was left in a minority opinion, saying [...] "We're being humiliated here for four days now". When Mofaz instructed the officers to be more aggressive and fire five antitank missiles at every house before entering, one of them contemplated disobedience. Meanwhile, when asked how long he thought his forces could last given the superiority of the Israeli forces, Abu Jandal said: [...] "No. That's not true. We have the weapon of surprise. We have the weapon of honor. We have the divine weapon, the weapon of Allah who stands at our side. We have weapons that are better than theirs. I am the one with the truth, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> faith in Allah, while they put their faith in a tank".|$|E

6000|$|... "What mean you, fair sir?" [...] I asked, {{while my}} heart gave a turn in <b>my</b> body, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> out <b>my</b> hand {{to a great}} tankard of wine.|$|R
60|$|She {{thanked me}} {{presently}} for my telegram, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> arm {{about her and}} drew her into the living room.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hush, Jonathan," [...] said I; [...] "there's the First Duff looking up. Be still! the Emperor {{will hear}} you;" [...] <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> {{hand on his}} mouth.|$|E
60|$|Then {{she moved}} her arm as though she felt for me blindly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> arms about her and drew her head to my {{shoulder}} and she wept....|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> down <b>my</b> pen <b>and</b> left her. Left her? No: {{she would}} not be left: {{powerless}} to detain me, she rose and followed, close as my shadow. I turned on the last step of the stair.|$|R
6000|$|... "That I cannot tell; but I know this, it {{is written}} in His Word that those who put their trust in Him shall never be confounded, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have <b>put</b> <b>my</b> trust in Him. He will never forsake me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Those fellows at Guinness's {{make such}} a fuss about everything; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>put</b> <b>my</b> nose into that little back room, but what every word I say, by some means or other, finds its way down to Grey Abbey." ...|$|R
60|$|In {{front of}} a {{glittering}} hotel a friend of mine, a critic, was climbing from a cab. He seemed at leisure; <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> question to him. He answered me conscientiously, as I was sure he would.|$|E
60|$|It {{was dark}} and quiet. Neither moon nor stars were visible. There was a smell like rain in the still, heavy air, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> hand out of window. No. The rain was only threatening, it had not come yet.|$|E
6000|$|... "We've got a {{guarantee}} {{for more than}} she cost; {{but at the same}} time I'd rather have her than a better one," [...] Jerry said promptly, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> hand in his, for he had spoken that which was in my heart.|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{this period}} {{a great many}} of the tombs were open, having been despoiled even of the few bones they contained. The opening at which I stopped was quite a large one, <b>and</b> when <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> light inside <b>I</b> found it was entirely empty.|$|R
6000|$|... "I had {{got down}} to the last step, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was <b>putting</b> <b>my</b> foot to the pavement, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> thought, Now I am going to turn my ankle. Wasn't it strange? <b>And</b> <b>I</b> turned it. How did you get me upstairs?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He didn't answer again. I couldn't {{even hear}} the sound of breathing. Then a kind of queer feeling came over me, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> down <b>my</b> hand <b>and</b> felt his face. It was as cold as lead. The cove's dead, mate,' I said.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, sing me something,--just one song. I may {{listen to}} that before I go,--something you used to sing at Lorton on a Saturday afternoon, {{when we had the}} drawing-room all to ourselves, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> apron over my head to listen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "None {{can come}} to us, without running an equal risk with ourselves," [...] {{answered}} the Genoese. [...] "It were better {{that we should be}} left to our own exertions. I like the coolness of this unknown mariner, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> faith in God!" ...|$|E
60|$|I put {{the balls}} for safety in my hat, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> hat upon the doorstep. It {{was not a}} {{sensible}} thing to do, I admit. As a matter of fact, it was a silly thing to do. I am not as a rule addle-headed; his influence must have affected me.|$|E
60|$|I do {{not know}} to this day how I came to deliver that blow as I did. Perhaps it was that my temper was at its highest, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> all <b>my</b> force into it. I was {{surprised}} at my own power.|$|R
60|$|But {{the clouds}} in the {{direction}} of Seville were very black, <b>and</b> coming nearer <b>I</b> saw that it rained upon the hills. The water fell on the earth like a transparent sheet of grey. Soon I felt an occasional drop, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> on <b>my</b> poncho.|$|R

6000|$|... "Mind how {{you touch}} my arm, doctor! it is broken {{somewhere between the}} elbow and the wrist; I heard it snap when the brute seized me.

6000|$|... "Because I {{know more}} to-day than I did yesterday," [...] {{answered}} Pomona. [...] "It is only this afternoon that I read something, as I was coming {{here on the}} cars.

[...] "I finished this part just as the cars stopped, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> scissors in the place; I'll read it to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No?" [...] {{said the}} other. [...] "Well, {{you will do}} {{presently}} unless you get right out of this shanty. I'm fit to make my wages yet, if I've only got one handy leg, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can <b>put</b> <b>my</b> mark on any blame peddler who talks that way to me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I remember," [...] said Girdlestone, {{stirring}} his tea thoughtfully, [...] "when {{we lived}} in the City as 'prentice lads together, we shared a room above the shop. He used to have a dormouse that he was very fond of. All his leisure time was spent in nursing the creature and cleaning its cage. It seemed to be his only pleasure in life. One night it was running across the floor, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> foot upon it." ...|$|E
6000|$|Hitherto we had met no Bedouins, and I interrogated my {{dragoman}} {{about them}} more than once; but he always {{told me that it}} did not signify; we should meet them, he said, before any danger could arise.

60|$|He {{went off}} grumbling {{and telling me}} to be careful, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>my</b> pipe out and {{walked up and down}} the wharf thinking.
