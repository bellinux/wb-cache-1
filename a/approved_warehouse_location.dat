Since the automobile spare part <b>warehouse</b> <b>location</b> problem {{is a very complex}} problem, particle swarm optimization is used and some improved strategies are proposed to improve the performance of this algorithm. At last, the computational results of the benchmark problems about <b>warehouse</b> <b>location</b> problems are used to examine the effectiveness of particle swarm optimization. Then the results of the real-life automobile spare part <b>warehouse</b> <b>location</b> problem also indicate that the improved particle swarm optimization is a feasible method to solve the <b>warehouse</b> <b>location</b> problem...|$|R
40|$|The {{overarching}} {{objective of}} this thesis is to explore the <b>warehouse</b> <b>location</b> decision problem by considering regional and specific site attributes in the unique context of humanitarian relief organisation. This is to fill the gaps the revealed in the current understanding of location decision problem, particularly the lack of studies attempting to investigate humanitarian pre-positioned location decision problem with qualitative attributes opposed to the many previous studies focused on computerised optimisation model absence of the human judgements. Specifically, this research develops into case studies of the international humanitarian organisations selecting the warehouse attributes and locating the alternative <b>warehouse</b> <b>locations.</b> International humanitarian relief organisation aiding the refugees participated in the case study of the regional location selection problem for pre-positioned warehouse with five major attributes and 25 sub-attributes. Six international humanitarian relief organisations based in Dubai, UAE participated for specific <b>warehouse</b> <b>location</b> selection problem with five major attributes and 30 sub-attributes. The overall research design adopted in this thesis is as follows. First, the coherent humanitarian <b>warehouse</b> <b>location</b> decision attributes were developed in {{the basis of a}} literature and semi-structured interviews with practitioners whose organisation practice pre-positioned warehouse operation system. Secondly, two case studies were conducted for constructing the hierarchy structure for warehouse evaluation for regional and specific site location. In the first case study, 11 managerial level officers participated to construct the regional <b>warehouse</b> <b>location</b> decision attributes and evaluated the <b>warehouse</b> <b>location</b> for the organisation. In the second case study, panel members were form by 11 decision-makers from six different organisations constructed the hierarchical structure of the specific site <b>warehouse</b> <b>location</b> attributes for the evaluation. Thirdly, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is executed to acquire criteria weights and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is employed to obtain the final ranking of the <b>warehouse</b> <b>locations.</b> Fuzzy set theory is adopted in the evaluation to deal with the fuzziness of decision-makers‟ preferences in decision making. In conclusion, this thesis extends the body of knowledge in pre-positioned <b>warehouse</b> <b>location</b> problem in the humanitarian relief logistics context by suggesting a MADM location method, AHP and TOPSIS, integrated with fuzzy set theory to understand the priority preference of regional (macro) and specific site (micro) <b>warehouse</b> <b>location</b> attributes and the selection of the optimal warehouse...|$|R

Since {{it belongs to}} the class of NP {{complete}} problems, we use the genetic algorithms in the solving of this problem. Genetic algorithms are rooted in the mechanisms of the evolution and natural selection.

40|$|This study {{examines}} and analyses the decision-making processes used by {{companies in the}} transport industry when making a <b>warehouse</b> <b>location</b> decision. Previous research has looked at location decision-making in many industries and at location decisions specifically in the retail and manufacturing sectors {{but not at the}} managerial decision process regarding <b>warehouse</b> <b>location</b> by transport companies. The conceptual model developed indicated that there are three specific decisions required; first the need for a new warehouse; secondly the need to determine an appropriate regional location, and finally the specific site within the region. When making a location decision the companies interviewed used a process that comprises the three phases of identification, collection and evaluation for each of the sequential decisions required in each case. In many cases the requirement for a new warehouse was driven by a new business opportunity and in many cases the client requirements drove the regional decision. Of primary consideration in determining the specific site for a warehouse is the access to freeways and other transport infrastructure. The locations of current and potential customers together with the building quality, configuration and flexibility were other major factors in the decision. The current research makes a contribution by applying a case study method to eight <b>warehouse</b> <b>location</b> decisions made by 7 companies in Victoria between 2003 and 2005. The case studies provide a depth and quality of data previously not found regarding location decisions in transport companies and provides an understanding of how these Victorian transport companies have made <b>warehouse</b> <b>location</b> decisions in recent years and the findings contribute a conceptual model and listing of managerial actions in the location decision making process The ability to use the developed model and the listing of management actions will encourage a more informed understanding of decision making for participants and provide for enhanced <b>warehouse</b> <b>location</b> decision making by transport companies in the future...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to empirically verify {{characteristics}} of current <b>warehouse</b> <b>locations</b> of humanitarian organizations (based on public information) and to relate those to the model developed by Richardson et al. (2016). Design/methodology/approach: This paper is based on desk research. Public data such as (annual) reports and databases are used to empirically verify location characteristics. Findings: A significant portion of our sample co-locates their products at UNHRD premises. This indicates that organizations prefer to cluster warehouse activities, particularly when there is no fee involved for using the warehouse (as is the case in the UNHRD network). We find that the characteristics of the current <b>warehouse</b> <b>locations</b> are aligned with literature on location selection factors. Current location can be characterized by infrastructure characteristics (in particular closeness to airport and safety) and by low occurrence of disasters. Other factors for which we did not find evidence for were labor quality and availability as well as political environment. Research limitations/implications: We have used a limited sample of warehouses. We also focused our research on the countries where two or more organizations have their warehouses located. We did not account for warehouse sizes or product stored in our analysis. Practical implications: The geographic map of the current warehouses together with the quantified location factors provides an overview of current <b>warehouse</b> <b>locations.</b> Originality/value: We empirically verify characteristics of <b>warehouse</b> <b>locations</b> of humanitarian organizations. This differs from other studies that do not provide an empirically grounded perspective...|$|R

Thus the computational feasibility of the dynamic programming procedure is enhanced by restricting the state space to these R t best solutions. Computational results on the ranking procedure are presented, and a problem involving two plants, five warehouses, 15 customer zones, and five periods is solved to illustrate the application of the method. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Warehouse</b> <b>Location</b> is a nonconvex {{programming}} problem {{involving the}} geographic placing and sizing of intermediate facilities in distribution studies. The nonconvexities {{are caused by}} economies of scale associated {{with the cost of}} building and operating the facilities. A heuristic program has been developed for solving <b>warehouse</b> <b>location</b> problems when these economies are representable by continuous concave functions. The paper discusses the heuristics used and computational experience with the program on "practical" problems. On the basis of two numerical examples for which an optimal solution was obtained through a special purpose experimental mixed integer programming code, it is conjectured (1) that near optimal solutions can be achieved using the heuristic program and (2) that optimal sizing and locating of facilities are very sensitive to the shapes of the warehousing cost functions. ...|$|R
