5000|$|British Virgin Islands {{insolvency}} law {{is almost entirely}} codified in the Insolvency Act, 2003 and the Insolvency Rules, 2005.

[...] In the Cayman Islands it is quite common for <b>a</b> scheme <b>of</b> arrangement to be supported by an application by the company for the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> provisional <b>liquidator</b> to give the company breathing space from its creditors in order to seek consent for and implement the scheme.

5000|$|The court {{invariably}} has a discretion {{whether to}} appoint <b>a</b> provisional <b>liquidator.</b> <b>A</b> court will not normally approve the application {{unless it is}} satisfied {{that there is a}} strong liklihood that <b>a</b> <b>liquidator</b> will be appointed on the substantive application.

5000|$|In the United Kingdom {{the power}} to appoint a {{provisional}} liquidator is found in section 135(1), of the Insolvency Act 1986, and it is regarded as an [...] "emergency procedure".

A provisional liquidator may only be appointed by the court only after a winding-up petition has been presented [...] The main reason for appointing a provisional liquidator is normally to preserve the company's assets.

[...] The applicant will normally need to show that (a) it is likely that a winding up order will be made at the hearing of the petition; and (b) the company's assets are at risk prior to the hearing of the petition (which includes either dissipation of the company's assets, or the potential loss or destruction of the company's books and records.

40|$|In {{the harsh}} {{economic}} conditions which prevail, increases in bad debts and difficulties in securing payment are common experiences for many. Financial difficulties resulting in poor payment conditions can affect {{any of your}} clients. Many legislative measures have been enacted which seek to prevent the “phoenix syndrome” but restriction and disqualification orders do not ensure your client is paid. Another phenomenon is the “scorched earth” problem identified by the McDowell Report 1, where the extent of insolvency is such that the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>liquidator</b> is highly unlikely for monetary reasons, but remedies are nonetheless required. So the provisions of, inter alia, section 251 of the Companies Act, 1990 (CA, 1990) are worthy of recall. ACCEPTEDpeer-reviewe...|$|E

40|$|LLM (Import and Export Law), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The {{world is}} {{continuously}} becoming a {{smaller and smaller}} place. It has become <b>a</b> global community <b>of</b> sorts merely divided by imperceptible borders that are easily transversed by ever-evolving technological advances {{in the fields of}} business, travel, communication and such, each regulated by its own set of domestic laws and regulations. Hordes of South Africans immigrate to Australia annually due to, among others, economic and political uncertainty. These ex-patriots generally leave behind assets and creditors in South Africa whilst acquiring new ones wherever they choose to establish themselves. This serves as basis for potential future cross-border insolvency issues. Furthermore, entities such as companies trading internationally, and multinational companies with branches and offices in more than one state, have property and creditors in many different jurisdictions. Should such a company be liquidated, it would give rise to questions of jurisdiction, the procedures to be followed, the <b>appointment</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>liquidator(s)</b> and the distribution of assets, to name a few. The absence <b>of</b> <b>a</b> universal cross-border insolvency law leaves room for much uncertainty and confusion. What is of importance for purposes of this research is to clarify all prevailing uncertainties regarding the rights and obligations of the foreign representative and the foreign creditor in cross-border insolvency matters. The foreign representative is the person or entity appointed to administer the reorganisation or liquidation of the insolvent debtor’s assets in a foreign proceeding. The inconsistency in cross-border insolvency regulations between South Africa and Australia has the consequence that {{there is no guarantee that}} a foreign creditor in one state will be treated the same as a foreign creditor in terms of the domestic laws of the other, as the Model Law aims to do. The situation would have been significantly less complicated had the South African Cross-Border Insolvency Act been in force at present and had Australia been designated as a state to which this Act would apply. In that case, the treatment of foreign representatives and foreign creditors would be <b>of</b> <b>a</b> reciprocal nature. This dissertation attempts, through <b>an</b> investigation <b>of</b> the South African and Australian domestic insolvency laws, to ascertain the position of the foreign representative and foreign creditors pre and post incorporation of the Model Law. Consequently this dissertation compares the legal positions of these parties in terms of South African and Australian national insolvency legislation. Master...|$|R
