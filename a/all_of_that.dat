5|$|Bootlegs {{should not}} be {{confused}} with counterfeit or unlicensed recordings, which are merely unauthorised duplicates of officially released recordings, often attempting to resemble the official product as close as possible. Some record companies have considered that any record issued outside of their control, and for which they do not receive payment, to be a counterfeit, which includes bootlegs. However, some bootleggers are keen to stress that the markets for bootleg and counterfeit recordings are different, and a typical consumer for a bootleg will have bought most or <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> artist's official releases anyway.|$|E

It was watched by 85.82 million people for a 37.1 average rating. It was one of the highest rated movies ever screened on television at the time (behind the broadcast premiere of Bridge on the River Kwai).|$|E

5|$|According to American {{psychiatrist}} Oleg Lapshin, Russia until 1993 did {{not have}} any specific legislation in the field of mental health except uncoordinated instructions and articles of laws in criminal and administrative law, orders of the USSR Ministry of Health. In the Soviet Union, any psychiatric patient could be hospitalized by request of his headman, relatives or instructions of a district psychiatrist. In this case, patient's consent or dissent mattered nothing. The duration of treatment in a psychiatric hospital also depended entirely on the psychiatrist. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> made the abuse of psychiatry possible to suppress those who opposed the political regime, and that created the vicious practice of ignoring the rights of the mentally ill.|$|E
5|$|In March 1807, about 125 {{students}} {{organized a}} protest against the college's strict conduct policies and rigorous study requirements. The protest included signing a formal petition of protest; college administrators subsequently suspended everyone who refused to withdraw his name from the petition. Breckinridge was required to apologize {{for his part in}} the protest in order to return to school, but he refused to do so. In May, he left Princeton for Cabell's Dale, but in Philadelphia he found that there were no available stages heading west for two weeks. Unable to afford room and board for that long, he went to Fincastle, Virginia, to stay with relatives. He considered enrolling at the College of William and Mary for the fall term in 1807, believing he could complete his studies in nine months but ultimately decided against it. Harrison surmises that the lack of correspondence between Breckinridge and his family in Kentucky between July 1807 to July 1808 indicated that he was at Cabell's Dale during most or <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> period.|$|E
5|$|The {{competitors}} {{must decide}} how much to pay each agent, {{and how much to}} pay the local guide in that region. If there are competing offers for the same guide in a particular region, the highest offer receives <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> region's diamonds in an all-pay auction. Competing agents can be bribed to reveal inside information regarding the competitor's decisions. Complicating matters further is the UN inspector, who moves at random between regions on each turn. The inspector blocks all diamond extraction from the region in which he is present, and can confiscate diamonds from agents within that region. Like other agents though, the inspector can be bribed and directed to regions of a player's choice.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} season, 1921–22, saw {{the formation}} of a Northern section of the Third Division and the Third Division became Division Three South. This arrangement would continue until 1958 when the Third and Fourth Division were formed, but for the moment, Palace were above <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> and in 1921 they opened their second season in the Football League as a Second Division club, finishing in fourteenth place. The highest attendance of the season was 20,000 for the Fulham game. Palace remained in the lower reaches of the table in the following season, 1922–23, finishing fifteenth. The club also made a significant purchase that season with regards to a new permanent home.|$|E
5|$|You are right. I did {{not think}} anything. I wasn’t thinking. I was feeling and I was dying. And then I was just like, You can’t go down like this! You have to turn this into music.

I just didn’t {{want to be that}} person that just went down after <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that.</b> A lot of the time in the sessions, they weren’t letting me write.

5|$|Having heard <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>that,</b> {{the brother}} took two pistols, poured more gunpowder, and {{sharpened}} the flints; {{he put the}} pistols into his belt, placed the knife between them, and slung a musket over his shoulder. He set forth. He passed through the dark forest; he came beneath the stair-like cliff; {{the moon and the}} stars were shining, so it was like a day; a silence all around him, pleasant; he sat down and lit his pipe. Before long a wisp of cloud showed from the direction of Mount Rumija; there came a roar and bluster, and everything happened as the sick man said. His hair rose so that three times he jammed his cap down on his head. Finally, three bulls fell down from the storm cloud and started to fight; all as it was said. He stabbed the pied bull in the neck with the knife; it staggered and fell; the light-haired bull got encouraged. Then he stabbed the dark-haired bull, and it slumped; the light-haired was finishing them off with its horns. This was not enough for him, and, fearing that the cut bulls could still rise up, he kept on striking them with the knife as long as there was a breath in their bodies. The storm cloud suddenly disappeared; together with it, the light-haired bull vanished. Again the moon and the stars shone; again a silence and blessedness. He was going back home as if flying; when he arrived he found his brother sitting by the hearth, placing logs on the fire, healthy as if he had never been sick.|$|E
