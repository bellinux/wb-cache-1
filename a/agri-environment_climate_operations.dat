40|$|In {{recent years}} several serious {{near-misses}} with major hazard accident potential have {{happened on the}} Norwegian Continental Shelf, many of them hydrocarbon leaks. Research has shown {{that many of these}} are caused by manual intervention. Despite this fact, current focus in QRAs and have been for a long time, are on technical systems. This is despite recent trends showing no decline in risk level. A higher focus on barriers and operational conditions is encouraged by the government and with upcoming production installations in the Barents Sea and arctic waters where operational conditions can be much harder, this must be a priority. Due to the remoteness and lack of infrastructure, a major hazard accident in these areas will most likely have a higher consequence both in regards to environmental impact but also in regards to loss of lives. Based on this, the work in this thesis is an effort to further the work on human factors and influences from an arctic operational environment, and how to use this in a barrier management perspective by using the quantitative Risk OMT method.

40|$|This paper follows {{research}} on how full-time family farmers learn about organic farming in Wales. The study surveys the sources and the support services used by farmers: as they {{made the decision to}} convert; during conversion; and as they became more proficient organic farmers. Whilst there are potentially extensive networks of knowledge sources ava ilable, organic farmers continue to be reliant on their own initiative, and show preference for learning from peer groups. However, farmers in the study also show differing expectations of organic farming, which is reflected in the ways that they learn about the system, and farmers’ learning processes are shown to be influenced both by their attitudes and motivations to business, as well as to organic conversion. Differentiation among organic farmers also indicates the differential ‘framing’ of organic farmers, organic agriculture, and sustainable agriculture in general. Such framing, and farmers’ response to it, affects the development of organic farming, and indicates how farmers and others act as co-producers of knowledge about organic agriculture. Interaction between organic and conventional farmers also shows potential to produce hybrid farming practices, the development of which may have implications for policy ranging from <b>agri-environment</b> to <b>climate</b> change mitigation and adaptation measures. The study explores the ways farmers interact in associations, analysis of which has made use of the Community of Practice (CoP) framework to explore social learning processes in agriculture. Understanding social learning processes is of general interest in extension practice, and this paper is, therefore, relevant to those working on extension methods and learning processes in agriculture, as well as to those interested in the development of organic and other alternative or innovative practices in Welsh agriculture...|$|R
40|$|Agricultural {{efforts are}} {{normally}} carried {{in remote areas}} where electricity from national electric grid may not exist or grid connection is very expensive. Therefore, a stand-alone power supply is always in demand therein. In greenhouses, cooling and pumping equipments dominate the demand for electricity. The demand for electricity occurs during the periods when solar radiation is available and in abundance; an excellent harmony between demand and supply elucidates the feasibility of using solar energy. Therefore, utilization of solar energy for powering greenhouses in desert climate is considered amongst the important applications of solar energy and carries great significance and success. The main objective of this research project is to quantify the potential of using a photovoltaic (PV) system to power greenhouses. The greenhouse under investigation is located at al-Muzahmyah research station of the King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST). The PV-greenhouse system consisted of the 14. 72 kW PV arrays, a 3000 Amp-hr battery storage system, a 15 kWp power conditioning system, data measurement & collection system, and a 9 x 39 m fiberglass greenhouse.

40|$|The {{growth of}} {{aviation}} has spurred increased study of its environmental impacts {{and the possible}} mitigation thereof. One emissions reduction option is the introduction of an Ultra Low Sulfur (ULS) jet fuel standard for global commercial aviation. A full cost-benefit analysis, including impacts on air quality, <b>climate,</b> <b>operations,</b> and lifecycle costs is necessary to justify such a policy. The cost of a ULS jet fuel policy is well-characterized by the adoption of ULS diesel fuel, similar to jet fuel, for ground transportation in the US and elsewhere. The cost of hydrodesulfurization (HDS), the process used to remove sulfur from fuel, is projected to be between 4 and 7 cents per gallon of jet fuel. With 2006 levels of domestic fuel consumption, this translates to a yearly cost of HDS of $ 540 -$ 940 million within the US. The climate and air quality benefits are characterized by several earth-atmosphere models, which isolate the perturbation of aviation emissions. Comparisons among models, which employ different modeling methods and assumptions as well as different spatial resolution, provide some cross-validation, as well as characterizing the degree of uncertainty {{in the state of}} the science. This thesis focuses in detail on the CMAQ (Community Multi-scale Air Quality) model, used by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to support regulatory impact assessment. Other models, their results, and efforts at inter-model comparison are also discussed. Benefits are monetized through valuing the reduction in premature mortality from reduced concentrations of ground-level particulate matter (PM). The central finding from CMAQ is that with nominal health impact parameters, a global ULS jet fuel policy is predicted to save 110 lives per year in the US when considering full flight emissions, a 14 % reduction in aviation-attributable mortality resulting in an estimated monetary benefit of $ 800 million. by Stephen Kuhn.

The characteristic variation in natural products is treated by a lumped approach, which uses discretised quality classes to describe not only product quality but also a measure of its variation. Although direct measurement of product properties is often difficult, the approach is validated using both simulated and measured data.
