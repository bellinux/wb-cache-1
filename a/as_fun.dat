5|$|Taking {{place after}} the events of Mega Man 4, Mega Man's brother and ally Proto Man un{{character}}istically leads a group of menacing robots in {{attacks on the world}} and kidnaps his own creator Dr. Light, leaving the title character little choice but to take up arms in a fight against his once trusted sibling. Mega Man 5 carries over the same graphical style and action-platforming gameplay as the four preceding chapters in the series. The game introduces a new character, Beat, a robotic bird that the player can use as a weapon once a series of eight collectible letters are found. Artist Keiji Inafune had to re-illustrate the bosses several times but described his work <b>as</b> <b>fun.</b>|$|E

The band felt that the songs on the album were incomplete and needed more time to be deemed finalized. The band also announced that it would be celebrating the 10-year anniversary of The Devil and God are Raging Inside Me by playing it in its entirety the remainder of the tour.

Reviews of B-Sides and Rarities were generally good; Devin Grant of The Post and Courier wrote that [...] "For an album full of odds and ends, this Cake release is every bit as good, and every bit <b>as</b> <b>fun,</b> as the band's previous studio releases", while Catherine P. Lewis of The Washington Post noted that, although several live tracks reduced the album's strength, [...] "there are still enough charming nuggets to make this album less disposable than the typical rarities compilation".|$|E

500|$|In Canada, {{following}} {{a meeting in}} Toronto on December 22, 2003 between Hastings and officials from the Ontario Ministry of Consumer and Business Services, Manhunt became the first computer game in Ontario to be classified as a film and was restricted to adults on February 3, 2004. Apart from Ontario, however, Manhunt {{had little or no}} classification problems elsewhere in North America. The British Columbia Film Classification Office reviewed the game after the controversy in Ontario and deemed the Mature rating by the ESRB to be appropriate. In Germany, the Amtsgericht in Munich confiscated all versions of Manhunt on July 19, 2004 for violation of [...] ("representation of violence").

500|$|Several writers at Famitsu {{praised the}} demon fusion mechanic, {{with one of}} them calling it the best aspect of the game. Kalata and Snelgrove noted that the series was unusally simplistic for the Megami Tensei series, but still found its {{gameplay}} to have more depth than Pokémon, and that it was able to challenge the player. On the other hand, GameSpot's Frank Provo said that it was not [...] "nearly <b>as</b> <b>fun</b> or diverse", in his review of Light Version and Dark Version. Reviewing White Book, one writer at Famitsu said that the tempo of the game was good, allowing for a stress-free experience playing the game, while another thought that the enemies were too strong at the beginning, forcing the player to repeatedly fuse their demons to make any progress at all.|$|E

500|$|Baldur's Gate IIs {{gameplay}} {{was called}} [...] "addicting" [...] by GamePro. RPGamer {{said that while}} the game was generally the same as the original Baldur's Gate, the combat was much improved, with less frustration and more strategic options. Computer Gaming World agreed, saying players would put more consideration into designing and implementing combat plans. Eurogamer noted that the interface was [...] "incredibly easy to use." [...] Some reviewers, however, felt the non-player characters in the game were not as powerful as player-made characters. GameSpy said the game is much more difficult than Baldur's Gate and requires more strategy and planning than the original does. GameSpot felt the opening level of the game [...] "falls flat," [...] but that it gets much better once the player reaches Athkatla. IGN also noted that the introductory section of the game, while good, was nowhere near <b>as</b> <b>fun</b> as the adventures in Athkatla.|$|E

[...] The review concluded by saying that [...] "it's <b>as</b> <b>fun</b> as it looks. Just for once, all those people who don't read reviews and buy games purely on the strength of pretty pictures on the packaging are gonna find themselves playing a very, very enjoyable game."

500|$|Deadpool {{had been}} {{developed}} for his own film by Reynolds and David S. Goyer at New Line Cinema in 2003, but the project fell apart as they focused on [...] and an aborted spin-off. Benioff wrote the character into the script in a manner Jackman described <b>as</b> <b>fun,</b> but would also deviate from some of his traits. Similarly, Gambit was a character who the filmmakers had tried {{to put in the}} previous X-Men films. Jackman liked Gambit because he is a [...] "loose cannon" [...] like Wolverine, stating their relationship echoes that of Wolverine and Pyro in the original trilogy. David Ayer contributed to the script. Benioff finished his draft in October 2006, and Jackman stated there would be a year before shooting, as he was scheduled to start filming Australia during 2007. Before the 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike began, James Vanderbilt and Scott Silver were hired for a last-minute rewrite.|$|E

[...] He deemed {{it one of}} the funniest and most {{entertaining}} episodes of the series, crediting Morris' performance and the [...] "fortunately limited" [...] Spears cameos. Responding to criticism of the episode, Poniewozik conceded that the storylines were slender and Spears remakes dominated the episode, however felt that unlike [...] "The Power of Madonna," [...] it worked because [...] "it owned its slightness: it kept the videos (and Britney's appearances) where they belonged as fantasy." [...] Bobby Hankinson of the Houston Chronicle described the episode as brilliant, and felt that presenting the Spears performances as a series of unrelated hallucinations was [...] "an inspired choice." [...] IGN's Robert Canning rated [...] "Britney/Brittany" [...] 8/10, signifying an [...] "Impressive" [...] episode.

The song [...] "Jesus, Oh What a Wonderful Child", was described as an original track that [...] "really took flight". The song was recorded in a church, with many live back-up singers and children playing tambourines and other melodious instruments. The goal was to produce a [...] "real church flavored song", in which Afanasieff played the keyboards and allowed Carey's voice to [...] "cut loose". According to Chris Nickson, Carey's love of gospel music came through on the track, writing, [...] " [...] led the band without pushing herself forward, letting the song develop and work out, trading lines with the chorus until, after the crescendo, the musicians moved into a fast double time to the end." ...|$|E

The Los Angeles Times {{described it as a}} lively pop music tribute to the actor. USA Today categorized the song <b>as</b> <b>fun</b> dance music and called it creatively motivated. The Toronto Sun wrote positively of its creative lyrics and use of audio from the Bale oration. El País classed the piece as an electropop song that contributed to the viral spread of the Bale rant online. Dose placed the song within the genre of an electro jam session. Publications including The A.V. Club and Pitchfork Media were impressed with the group's ability to compose and release the song twenty-four hours after the audio of the incident appeared online.
