5|$|Wind figures {{prominently}} in several popular sports, including recreational hang gliding, hot air ballooning, kite flying, snowkiting, kite landboarding, kite surfing, paragliding, sailing, and windsurfing. In gliding, wind gradients {{just above the}} surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a glider. Wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on ground launches, also known as winch launches or wire launches. If the wind gradient is significant or sudden, or both, and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude, the indicated <b>airspeed</b> will increase, possibly exceeding the maximum ground launch tow speed. The pilot must adjust the <b>airspeed</b> {{to deal with the}} effect of the gradient. When landing, wind shear is also a hazard, particularly when the winds are strong. As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing, <b>airspeed</b> decreases while sink rate increases, and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact. The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Allied {{contact with}} Rommelspargel in Normandy was by British {{airborne}} forces. During Operation Tonga, the British airborne invasion of Normandy, <b>Airspeed</b> Horsa gliders landed among the wooden poles and suffered casualties. Some gliders were wrecked near Sainte-Mère-Église where Americans parachutists had also landed. Where encountered, British forces {{blew up the}} logs with dynamite and cleared landing fields for reinforcements.|$|E

The data are based on CH- 53 A helicopters and CH- 54 B helicopters with various digital filters operating at various <b>airspeeds.</b> Curves are plotted for a time history comparison of identified derivative models against flight data for the helicopters at specific <b>airspeeds</b> and maneuvers...|$|R
5|$|On 16 July 1964, Vulcan B.1A XA909 {{crashed in}} Anglesey after a midair {{explosion}} caused both No. 3 and No. 4 engines {{to be shut}} down. The explosion was caused by failure of a bearing in No. 4 engine. The starboard wing was extensively damaged, the pilot had insufficient aileron power, and both <b>airspeed</b> indications were highly inaccurate. The whole crew successfully abandoned XA909 and were found {{within a few minutes}} and rescued.|$|E
5|$|On 29 September 1931, barely {{two weeks}} after the British team had secured the Schneider Trophy outright, Flight Lieutenant George Stainforth broke the world <b>airspeed</b> record in a Rolls-Royce R-powered Supermarine S.6B, serial S1595, {{reaching}} an average speed of 407.5mph (655.67km/h). It had been intended to also use the identical sister aircraft, S1596, for the attempt but Stainforth had capsized it on 16 September whilst testing a propeller.|$|E
5|$|Soaring {{related to}} wind shear, also called dynamic soaring, is a {{technique}} used by soaring birds like albatrosses, who can maintain flight without wing flapping. If the wind shear is of sufficient magnitude, a bird can climb into the wind gradient, trading ground speed for height, while maintaining <b>airspeed.</b> By then turning downwind, and diving through the wind gradient, they can also gain energy. It has also been used by glider pilots on rare occasions.|$|E

5|$|The {{computor}} cabinet {{included only}} four main controls. On {{the left side}} of the chassis, from top to bottom, were dials that set the wind direction, wind speed, target altitude and terminal velocity of the bomb. All of these inputs were set by reading their value in a small window on {{the left side of}} the dials. Additional windows provided output values for the indicated <b>airspeed,</b> course, and bombing angle (or range angle). Clips in the upper right held a card with levelling data, as well as notes about the sight or the bombs being dropped. The computor was also connected to several external sources. Compressed air was supplied from the engines to drive the mechanism, and an exhaust allowed the less dense used air to escape. Tubes were also connected to the pitot tube and static air source, which allowed the accurate measurement of <b>airspeed.</b> A separate electrical connection input the direction measured on the distant reading compass, using a selsyn.|$|E
5|$|When landing, {{wind shear}} {{is also a}} hazard, {{particularly}} when the winds are strong. As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing, <b>airspeed</b> decreases while sink rate increases, and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact. The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.|$|E
5|$|Wind shear is also {{a hazard}} for {{aircraft}} making steep turns near the ground. It is a particular problem for gliders which have a relatively long wingspan, which exposes them to a greater wind speed difference for a given bank angle. The different <b>airspeed</b> experienced by each wing tip can result in an aerodynamic stall on one wing, causing a loss of control accident.|$|E
40|$|Migrating insects {{use their}} sensory systems to acquire {{local and global}} cues about their surroundings. Previous {{research}} on tethered insects suggests that, in addition to vision and cephalic bristles, insects use antennal mechanosensory feedback to maintain their <b>airspeeds.</b> Owing to the large displacements of migratory insects and difficulties inherent in tracking single individuals, the roles of these sensory inputs have never been tested in freely migrating insects. We tracked individual uraniid moths (Urania fulgens) as they migrated diurnally over the Panama Canal, and measured <b>airspeeds</b> and orientation for individuals with either intact or amputated flagella. Consistent with prior observations that antennal input is necessary for flight control, 59 per cent of the experimental moths could not fly after flagella amputation. The remaining fraction (41 %) was flight-capable and maintained its prior <b>airspeeds</b> despite severe reduction in antennal input. Thus, maintenance of <b>airspeeds</b> may not involve antennal input alone, and is probably mediated by other modalities. Moths with amputated flagella could not recover their proper migratory orientations, suggesting that antennal integrity is necessary for long-distance navigation...|$|R
40|$|The airstart {{performance}} of the F 100 engine equipped with a digital electronic engine control (DEEC) system was evaluated in an F- 15 airplane. The DEEC system incorporates closed-loop airstart logic for improved capability. Spooldown and jet fuel starter-assisted airstarts were made over a range of <b>airspeeds</b> and altitudes. All jet fuel starter-assisted airstarts were successful, with airstart time varying from 35 to 60 sec. All spooldown airstarts at <b>airspeeds</b> of 200 knots and higher were successful; airstart times ranged from 45 sec at 250 knots to 135 sec at 200 knots. The effects of altitude on airstart success and time were small. The flight results agreed closely with previous altitude facility test results. The DEEC system provided successful airstarts at <b>airspeeds</b> at least 50 knots lower than the standard F 100 engine control system...|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{designated}} <b>airspeeds</b> relating to optimum rates of ascent, the two most important of these are VX and VY.|$|R
5|$|Wind shear {{refers to}} the {{variation}} of wind over either horizontal or vertical distances. Airplane pilots generally regard significant wind shear to be a horizontal change in <b>airspeed</b> of 30 knots (15m/s) for light aircraft, and near 45 knots (22m/s) for airliners at flight altitude. Vertical speed changes greater than 4.9knots (2.5m/s) also qualify as significant wind shear for aircraft. Low level wind shear can affect aircraft <b>airspeed</b> during {{take off and landing}} in disastrous ways, and airliner pilots are trained to avoid all microburst wind shear (headwind loss in excess of 30 knots). The rationale for this additional caution includes: (1) microburst intensity can double in a minute or less, (2) the winds can shift to excessive cross wind, (3) 40-50 knots is the threshold for survivability at some stages of low-altitude operations, and (4) several of the historical wind shear accidents involved 35-45 knot microbursts. Wind shear is also a key factor in the creation of severe thunderstorms. The additional hazard of turbulence is often associated with wind shear.|$|E
5|$|An {{aircraft}} {{manufacturing industry}} {{was established in}} the town with the construction of an <b>Airspeed</b> factory at Christchurch Airfield in 1942. In 1948 the factory became part of de Havilland and manufactured a wide range of aircraft such as the Vampire, Sea Venom and Sea Vixen. In the 1950s, Bournemouth Airport, a former RAF base situated on the outskirts of borough boundaries at Hurn, also became heavily involved in aircraft production after Vickers Armstrong—which later became the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC)—established a factory at the airport.|$|E
5|$|As {{reflector}} sight designs advanced after World War II, {{giving the}} pilot {{more and more}} information, they eventually evolved into the head-up display (HUD). The illuminated reticle was eventually replaced by a video screen at {{the focus of the}} collimating optics that not only gave a sighting point and information from a lead-finding computer and radar, but also various aircraft indicators (such as an artificial horizon, compass, altitude and <b>airspeed</b> indicators), facilitating the visual tracking of targets or the transition from instrument to visual methods during landings.|$|E
50|$|The {{inconsistency}} {{between the}} <b>airspeeds</b> {{measured by the}} different sensors {{is one of the}} causes of the accident according to the final report.|$|R
5000|$|Knouff told {{investigators}} that Brannon had been a [...] "perfectionist" [...] who [...] "went by the book in everything he did," [...] but added that, during previous flights together, he'd noticed that Brannon had developed a habit of making landing approaches at slower-than-prescribed <b>airspeeds</b> - <b>airspeeds</b> [...] "as low as 93 or 95 KIAS." [...] When asked if Brannon had used that technique {{on the night of}} the accident, Knouff replied, [...] "He could have been. I don't recall if he was or not, but possibly." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Airspeed's</b> most {{productive}} period {{was during the}} Second World War. The graceful, twin-engined trainer-cum-light transport aircraft known as the AS.10 Oxford had a production run exceeding 8,500.|$|R
5|$|Lag {{errors are}} caused {{by the fact that}} any changes in the static or dynamic {{pressure}} outside the aircraft require a finite amount of time to make their way down the tubing and affect the gauges. This type of error depends on the length and diameter of the tubing as well as the volume inside the gauges. Lag error is only significant around the time when the <b>airspeed</b> or altitude are changing. It is not a concern for steady level flight.|$|E
5|$|On 22 December Hinkler, {{accompanied}} by John F. Leeming, {{president of the}} Lancashire Aero Club, made another attempt. The landing was no problem. On the steep slope and with a strong headwind the plane stopped quickly. Professor E. R. Dodds witnessed the landing. The uphill take-off was more difficult and the plane dived {{off the edge of}} the summit with insufficient <b>airspeed,</b> but picked up speed as it dived, narrowly missing Striding Edge, to return to Manchester.|$|E
5|$|Thanks to {{the thick}} {{straight}} wing the Thunderjet rapidly reached its Mach 0.82 limitation at full throttle and low altitude. The aircraft had sufficient power to fly faster, but exceeding the Mach limit at low altitudes {{resulted in a}} violent pitch-up and structural failure causing the wings to break off. Above 15,000ft (4,600m), the F-84 could be flown faster but {{at the expense of}} severe buffeting. Fortunately, the <b>airspeed</b> was sufficiently easy to control to make safe dive bombing from 10,000ft (3,000m) possible. The top speed limitation proved troublesome against Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15s in Korea. Slower than the MiG, the F-84 was also unable to turn tightly with a maximum instantaneous-turn load of only 3Gs followed by rapid loss of <b>airspeed.</b> One F-84E pilot credited with two MiG kills achieved his second victory by intentionally flying his aircraft into pitch-up. The MiGs chasing him were unable to follow the violent maneuver and one crashed into the ground. Luckily for the F-84E pilot, the aircraft did not disintegrate but the airframe did suffer heavy warping. The F-84 was a stable gun platform and the computing gunsight aided in accurate gunnery and bombing. Pilots praised the aircraft for Republic's legendary ruggedness.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} open loop higher {{harmonic}} control (HHC) on rotor hub loads, performance, and push rod loads of a Sikorsky S- 76 helicopter rotor at high <b>airspeeds</b> (up to 200 knots) and moderate lift (10, 000 lbs) were studied analytically. The {{analysis was performed}} {{as part of a}} wind tunnel pre-test prediction and preparation procedure, as well as to provide analytical results for post-test correlation efforts. The test associated with this study is to be concluded in the 40 - by 80 -Foot Wind Tunnel of the National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex (NFAC) at the NASA Ames Research Center. The results from this analytical study show that benefits from HHC can be achieved at high <b>airspeeds.</b> These results clear the way for conducting (with the requirement of safe pushrod loads) an open loop HHC test a high <b>airspeeds</b> in the 40 - by 80 -Foot Wind Tunnel using an S- 76 rotor as the test article...|$|R

5|$|The R {{was used}} {{with great success}} in the Schneider Trophy {{seaplane}} competitions held in England in 1929 and 1931. Shortly after the 1931 competition, an R engine using a special fuel blend powered the winning Supermarine S.6B aircraft to a new <b>airspeed</b> record of over 400miles per hour (640km/h). Continuing through the 1930s, both new and used R engines were used to achieve various land and water speed records by such racing personalities as Sir Henry Segrave, Sir Malcolm Campbell and his son Donald, the last record being set in 1939. A final R-powered water speed record attempt by Donald Campbell in 1951 was unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The {{elevator}} is {{also very}} narrow in chord like the rudder, and the B-52 suffers from limited elevator control authority. For long term pitch trim and <b>airspeed</b> changes the aircraft uses an all-moving tail with the elevator used for small adjustments within a stabilizer setting. The stabilizer is adjustable through 13 degrees of movement (nine up, four down) and is crucial to operations during {{take off and landing}} due to large pitch changes induced by flap application.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} {{attempted}} {{to extend the}} gear for landing, they encountered difficulties, since hydraulic power to the landing gear in that aircraft was normally supplied by the two right side engines, now shut down. The crew initially selected runway 33 for landing, then decided on runway 02, and when they realized they were too high for landing on runway 02, they decided to climb and go around for runway 33 again. While climbing on the two operating engines, with asymmetric thrust, the number one engine (outboard on left side) failed due to over-boosting, leading to a rapid loss of <b>airspeed</b> and eventual stall. The aircraft crashed into trees, and a fire broke out which engulfed the entire aircraft in flames and smoke. The captain and flight engineer were able to escape, but all others were trapped inside the wreckage and were overcome by carbon monoxide poisoning before they could exit, as later autopsies would reveal.|$|E
50|$|BASE jumping {{grew out}} of skydiving. BASE jumps are {{generally}} made from much lower altitudes than skydives, and a BASE jump takes place close to the object serving as the jump platform. Because BASE jumps generally entail slower <b>airspeeds</b> than typical skydives (due to the limited altitude), a BASE jumper does not always reach terminal velocity. Because higher <b>airspeeds</b> enable jumpers more aerodynamic control of their bodies, {{as well as more}} positive and quick parachute openings, the longer the delay, the better. BASE jumping is significantly more dangerous than similar sports such as skydiving from aircraft.|$|R

40|$|This PhD thesis {{describes}} parachute rescue {{systems for}} small planes {{and focuses on}} their functionality in the border areas of the flight envelope, especially at very low altitudes and low <b>airspeeds</b> of flight (fall).
