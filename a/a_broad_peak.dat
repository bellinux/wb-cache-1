5000|$|This {{effect can}} be {{explained}} by looking at the change in entropy of the system. At zero temperature only the lowest energy level is occupied, entropy is zero, and there is very little probability of a transition to a higher energy level. As the temperature increases, there is an increase in entropy and thus the probability of a transition goes up. As the temperature approaches the difference between the energy levels there is <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> <b>peak</b> in the specific heat corresponding to a large change in entropy for a small change in temperature. At high temperatures all of the levels are populated evenly, so there is again little change in entropy for small changes in temperature, and thus a lower specific heat capacity.|$|E

50|$|Crime in the United States {{has been}} {{recorded}} since colonization. Crime rates have varied over time, with a sharp rise after 1963, reaching <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> <b>peak</b> between the 1970s and early 1990s. Since then, crime has declined significantly in the United States, and current crime rates are approximately {{the same as those}} of the 1960s. Statistics on specific crimes are indexed in the annual Uniform Crime Reports by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and by annual National Crime Victimization Surveys by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. In addition to the primary Uniform Crime Report known as Crime in the United States, the FBI publishes annual reports on the status of law enforcement in the United States. The report's definitions of specific crimes are considered standard by many American law enforcement agencies. According to the FBI, index crime in the United States includes violent crime and property crime. Violent crime consists of four criminal offenses: murder and non-negligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault; property crime consists of burglary, larceny, motor vehicle theft, and arson.|$|E
50|$|Another {{example is}} Co(H2O)62+. Note that the ligand {{is the same}} as the last example. Here the cobalt ion has the {{oxidation}} state of +2, and it is a d7 ion. From the high-spin (left) side of the d7 Tanabe-Sugano diagram, the ground state is 4T1(F), and the spin multiplicity is a quartet. The diagram shows that there are three quartet excited states: 4T2, 4A2, and 4T1(P). From the diagram one can predict that there are three spin-allowed transitions. However, the spectra of Co(H2O)62+ does not show three distinct peaks that correspond to the three predicted excited states. Instead, the spectrum has <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> <b>peak</b> (spectrum shown below). Based on the T-S diagram, the lowest energy transition is 4T1 to 4T2, which is seen in the near IR and is not observed in the visible spectrum. The main peak is the energy transition 4T1(F) to 4T1(P), and the slightly higher energy transition (the shoulder) is predicted to be 4T1 to 4A2. The small energy difference leads to the overlap of the two peaks, which explains the broad peak observed in the visible spectrum.|$|E
50|$|Climatic change plays {{a crucial}} role in {{affecting}} the basin hydrology. Throughout the year, there is a significant rise in hydrograph, with <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> <b>peak</b> between July and September. The Brahmaputra River experiences two high-water seasons, one in early summer caused by snow melt in the mountains, and one in late summer caused by runoff from monsoon rains. The river flow is strongly influenced by snow and ice melting of the glaciers, which are located mainly on the eastern Himalaya regions in the upstream parts of the basin. The snow and glacier melt contribution to the total annual runoff is about 27%, while the annual rainfall contributes to about 1.9m and 19,830 m3 /s of discharge. The highest recorded daily discharge in the Brahmaputra at Pandu was 72,726 m3 /s August 1962 while the lowest was 1,757 m3 /s in February 1968. The increased rates of snow and glacial melt are likely to increase summer flows in some river systems for a few decades, followed by a reduction in flow as the glaciers disappear and snowfall diminishes. This is particularly true for the dry season when water availability is crucial for the irrigation systems.|$|E

50|$|JH {{esterase}} and JH epoxide hydrolase {{are crucial}} in terminating {{the action of}} JH. The role of juvenile hormone binding proteins are also important, as they afford juvenile hormone protection from hydrolytic enzymes. This makes for a very complicated scenario {{that is difficult to}} investigate, and also difficult to distinguish between different species. Very detailed studies have been done on JH, JH acid, ecdysone, and JH titers have been done in precisely timed larvae of Manduca sexta as a function of development during the fifth larval stadium. In these larvae the principle JH are JH I, and JH II, with low levels of JH 0 and JH III. There is a large peak of JH I and II {{at the end of the}} fourth stadium, accompanied by lower levels of their acid metabolites. Then <b>a</b> <b>broad</b> <b>peak</b> of JH esterase starts on day 1.5 to day 4. Subsequently, ecdysteroid titers rise slightly on day 3.5, then a massive peak of ecdysteroid starting on day 5 persisting at somewhat lower levels to day 5. This is accompanied by a sharp peak of JH I and JH II, beginning on day 4 and ending on day 6. JH I acid titers are almost the same as JH I titer, except on day 7 when is a sharp peak of only JH I acid. This is just as ecdysteroid titers are decreasing. (A very similar timing of peaks of JH esterase and ecdysone has been observed in Galleria mellonella. These data are consistent with a classical model for lepidopterans where JH is high at each larval molt, but must rise together with ecdysone prior to pupation to initiate the pupal molt. They are also consistent with a model advanced by others that corpora allata maintained in vitro of day 0 M. sexta larva secrete high levels of JH, but that the shift to producing only JH acid at day 4, which is then methylated by imaginal discs to generate the JH peak. However, secretion of the relative amounts of JH produced by CA of Manduca sexta has been found to differ considerably from in vivo titers. Investigation of JH titers in Trichoplusia ni have led to very similar conclusions as regards the timing of pulses of JH temporally and with respect to edysone secretion. However, the principle JH in this species is JH II. Injection of an esterase inhibitor, EPPAT, was found to increase juvenile hormone titers, and starvation was found to increase juvenile hormone titers. In addition, parasitization of larvae with Chelonus sp. (Hymenoptera) was found to decrease JH II titers, but to cause an increase in JH III titers, apparently derived from the parasite.|$|E
