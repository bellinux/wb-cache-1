25|$|It {{is unclear}} whether {{distilled}} drinks were produced in Mexico before the Spanish Conquest. The Spaniards were introduced to native fermented drinks such as pulque, made from the maguey plant. Soon, the conquistadors began experimenting with the agave plant to find <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> distillable fermented mash. The result was mezcal.|$|E

25|$|After his father's death {{his mother}} moved {{the family to}} Andover, Massachusetts to find better schools for her children. The {{substantial}} estate left by her husband was managed by her husband's family. By the fall of 1878 the money had been lost or stolen and Martha Gilbreth had to find <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> living. She moved the family to Boston where there were good public schools. She opened a boarding house since the salary of a schoolteacher would not support the family.|$|E
25|$|Upon introduction, these liquors {{were called}} aguardiente (literally fire water or fiery water). The Spanish had known {{distillation}} processes since the eighth century {{and had been}} used to drinking hard liquor. They brought a supply with them from Europe, but when this ran out, they began to look for a substitute. They had been introduced to pulque and other drinks based on the agave or agave plant, so they began experimenting to find <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> product with a higher alcohol content. The result is mezcal.|$|E

25|$|Inductive {{learning}} {{problem can}} occur as words are oftentimes used in ambiguous {{situations in which}} there are more than one possible referents available. This can lead to confusion for the infants as {{they may not be able}} to distinguish which words should be extended to label objects being referenced to. Smith and Yu proposed that <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> distinction in such ambiguous situations is to track the word-referent pairings over multiple scenes. For instance, an infant who hears a word in the presence of object A and object B will be unsure of whether the word is the referent of object A or object B. However, if the infant then hears the label again in the presence of object B and object C, the infant can conclude that object B is the referent of the label because object B consistently pairs with the label across different situations.|$|E
500|$|What distinguishes hip-hop {{from other}} forms of dance {{is that it is}} often [...] "{{freestyle}}" [...] (improvisational) in nature and hip-hop dance crews often engage in freestyle dance competitions—colloquially referred to as [...] "battles". Crews, freestyling, and battles are identifiers of this style. Hip-hop dance can be a form of entertainment or a hobby. It can also be a way to stay active in competitive dance and <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> living by dancing professionally.|$|E

[...] Austin had already produced his first feature with Drumline in 2002, {{and wanted to be}} sure ATL would be similarly authentic to the culture of his hometown by using its current hip-hop scene as the story's backdrop. Music in the environment of the rink was the way Austin pitched the film [...] "as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> musical without putting Singin' in the Rain on the screen... without the kids breaking into song.

500|$|Branagh, {{a fan of}} {{the comic}} book since childhood, commented on the {{challenge}} of bridging Asgard and the modern world: [...] "Inspired by the comic book world both pictorially and compositionally at once, we've tried to find <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> virtue and a celebration of the distinction between the worlds that exist in the film but absolutely make them live in the same world. It's about finding the framing style, the color palette, finding the texture and the amount of camera movement that helps celebrate and express the differences and the distinctions in those worlds. If it succeeds, it will mark this film as different.... The combination of the primitive and the sophisticated, the ancient and the modern, I think that potentially is the exciting fusion, the exciting tension in the film".|$|E
500|$|Early in development, it was {{proposed}} that the game would use 3D graphics, as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> big impact worthy of {{the start of a}} new Ace Attorney series; eventually they settled for a 2D style, with a few 3D elements. Apollo Justice was the first game in the series to feature videos created using motion-capture data. A male staff member of the Research & Development team was chosen to be the motion-capture actor for a female character; the producer described him as being [...] "a natural" [...] at it. Voice acting was also provided by Capcom staff members. During development, staff members visited real courts to watch and study the trials. Most of the game's music was composed by Toshihiko Horiyama, with Hideki Okugawa composing three songs and Akemi Kimura and Shu Takumi composing two songs each. A soundtrack album, Gyakuten Saiban 4 Original Soundtrack, was released on June 27, 2007. A concert, based on the music from Ace Attorney and entitled Gyakuten Meets Orchestra, took place in Tokyo in April 2008. A CD of the concert was published on July 16, 2008.|$|E

2500|$|A {{slot machine}} is a casino {{gambling}} machine.

The first [...] "one-armed bandit" [...] was invented in 1887 by Charles Fey of San Francisco, California who devised a simple automatic mechanism with three spinning reels containing a total of five symbols– horseshoes, diamonds, spades, hearts and a Liberty Bell, which also gave the machine its name.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, {{the show}} {{received}} {{a positive response}} from TV critics. Tom Shales, in The Washington Post, wrote, [...] "Twin Peaks disorients you in ways that small-screen productions seldom attempt. It's a pleasurable sensation, the floor dropping out and leaving one dangling." [...] In The New York Times, John J. O'Connor wrote, [...] "Twin Peaks is not a send-up of the form. Mr. Lynch clearly savors the standard ingredients...but then the director adds his own peculiar touches, small passing details that suddenly, and often hilariously, thrust the commonplace out of kilter." [...] Entertainment Weekly gave the show an [...] "A+" [...] rating and Ken Tucker wrote, [...] "Plot is irrelevant; moments are everything. Lynch and Frost have mastered <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> weekly series endlessly interesting." [...] Richard Zoglin in Time magazine said that it [...] "may be the most hauntingly original work ever done for American TV." ...|$|E
