50|$|By 1935 new tube {{technologies}} {{were required}} {{for the development of}} radar and telecommunications. UHF requirements severely limited the existing tubes, so radical ideas were implemented which affected how these tubes connected to the host system. Two new bases appeared, the <b>acorn</b> <b>tube</b> and the lighthouse tube, both solving the same problems but with different approaches. Thompson, G.M. Rose, Saltzberg and Burnside from RCA created the <b>acorn</b> <b>tube</b> by using far smaller electrodes, with radial short connections. A different approach was taken by the designers of the lighthouse tube, such as the octal-base 2C43, which relied on using concentric cylindrical metal contacts in connections that minimized inductance, thus allowing a much higher frequency.|$|E
50|$|An <b>acorn</b> <b>tube,</b> or acorn valve, {{refers to}} {{any member of}} a family of VHF/UHF vacuum tubes {{starting}} just before World War II. They were named after their resemblance to the acorn, specifically due to the glass cap {{at one end of the}} tube that looked similar to the cap on an acorn. The acorn tubes found widespread use in radios and radar systems.|$|E
5|$|The Airborne Group {{had been}} experimenting with {{microwave}} systems as early as 1938 after discovering that a suitable arrangement of the <b>acorn</b> <b>tubes</b> could be operated at wavelengths as short as 30cm. However, these had very low output, and operated well within the region of reduced sensitivity on the receiver side, so detection ranges were very short. The group gave up on further development for the time being.|$|R
50|$|The {{prototype}} had a peak-power of 1 kW, {{and used}} a pulse length of 2 to 3 μs with a 10- to 20 kHz PRF. The receiver was a super-heterodyne type using <b>Acorn</b> <b>tubes</b> and a 6 MHz IF stage. The antenna consisted of 4 rows of 16 half-wave dipoles backed by a 3- by 3-meter mesh screen. The operator used a bicycle-type drive to rotate the antenna, and the elevation could be changed using a hand crank.|$|R
25|$|The Airborne Group {{had been}} experimenting with {{microwave}} systems as early as 1938 after discovering that a suitable arrangement of the RCA <b>acorn</b> <b>tubes</b> could be operated at wavelengths as low as 30cm. However, these had very low output, {{and on top of}} this, the receiver's electronics were not very sensitive at these frequencies. This resulted in very short detection ranges, essentially useless. The group gave up on further development for the time being, and Bowen described the topic being pooh-poohed by the engineers for some time.|$|R
50|$|Kühnhold then {{shifted the}} GEMA work to a {{pulse-modulated}} system. A new 50 cm (600 MHz) Philips magnetron with better frequency stability was used. It was modulated with 2- μs pulses at a PRF of 2000 Hz. The transmitting antenna was {{an array of}} 10 pairs of dipoles with a reflecting mesh. The wide-band regenerative receiver used <b>Acorn</b> <b>tubes</b> from RCA, and the receiving antenna had three pairs of dipoles and incorporated lobe switching. A blocking device (a duplexer), shut the receiver input when the transmitter pulsed. A Braun tube (a CRT) was used for displaying the range.|$|R
50|$|The {{transmitter}} operated at 90 MHz (3.3 m) {{and had a}} {{power of}} about 500 W. The pulse was 20-μs in width and the PRF was 50 Hz, synchronized with the power-line. The receiver was super-regenerative, using type 955 and 956 <b>Acorn</b> <b>tubes</b> in the front end and a 9-MHz IF amplifier. Separate, rotatable antennas with stacked pairs of full-wave dipoles were used for transmitting and receiving. The beams were about 30 degrees wide, but the azimuth of the reflected signal was determined more precisely by using a goniometer. Pulses were displayed on the CRT of a commercial oscilloscope.|$|R
5|$|The team {{received}} {{a number of}} Western Electric Type 316A large <b>acorn</b> vacuum <b>tubes</b> in early 1937. These were suitable for building transmitter units of about 20W continual power for wavelengths of 1 to 10m (300 to 30MHz). Percy Hibberd built a prototype transmitter with pulses {{of a few hundred}} watts and fitted it to the Heyford in March 1937.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} range included {{about half}} a dozen tubes, designed {{to work in the}} VHF range. The 955 is a triode. The 954 and 956 types are sharp and remote cut-off pentodes, respectively, all with indirect 6.3 V, 150 mA heaters. Types 957, 958 and 959 are for portable equipment and have 1.25 V NiCd battery heaters. The 957 is a medium-μ signal triode, the 958 is a transmitting triode with dual, paralleled filaments for increased emission, and the 959 is a sharp cut-off pentode like the 954. The 957 and 959 draw 50 mA heater current, the 958 twice as much. In 1942, the 958A with tightened emission specs was introduced after it turned out that 958s with excessively high emission kept working after the filament power was turned off, the filament still sufficiently heating on the anode current alone. After the introduction of the miniature 7-pin base, the 954, 955 and 956 were made available with this base as 9001, 9002 and 9003. Other <b>acorn</b> <b>tubes</b> include: ...|$|R
