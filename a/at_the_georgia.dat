Researchers used wires with lengths of 0.2–0.3mm and diameters of three to five micrometers, but the device could be scaled down to smaller size.|$|E
5|$|In the NCAA Tournament UConn easily {{advanced}} to the Final Four <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> Dome in Atlanta.

5|$|Boyd was {{appointed}} {{as head of}} the Mathematics and Science Department at West Georgia College in 1933. In 1935, he joined the faculty <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> Institute of Technology as an assistant professor of physics. Boyd married Elizabeth Reynolds Cobb, daughter of Betty Reynolds Cobb and Hiram Felix Cobb, on June 2, 1934. James and Elizabeth went on to have two children: a daughter, Betty Cobb Boyd (born August 26, 1939) and a son, James Fortson Boyd (born October 9, 1942). With World War II under way, Boyd joined the United States Navy in 1942, serving as a lieutenant and later lieutenant commander in the Bureau of Ordnance, performing research on radar. From 1945 to 1946, he was a commander in the Office of the Chief of Naval Operations where he worked on radar and electronics.|$|E
5|$|In Albrecht's {{role with}} the 2012–13 Wolverines team, he never scored more than 7 {{points in a}} game before the NCAA Tournament.

Several players had career-highs in the game, including Albrecht who had 7 points and 3 steals.

5|$|On July 7, 2011, {{officials}} from both Alabama and Virginia Tech announced the Crimson Tide and the Hokies would meet {{to open the}} 2013 season in the Chick-fil-A Kickoff Game at Atlanta. In the game, the offense struggled, but Christion Jones became the first Alabama player to score two non-offensive touchdowns in a single game and led the Crimson Tide to a 35–10 victory <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> Dome. After the Hokies were held to a three-and-out, Christion Jones gave Alabama a 7–0 lead with his first touchdown on a 72-yard punt return. The teams then traded a series of punts before T. J. Yeldon extended the Alabama lead to 14–0 with his two-yard touchdown run that capped a 49-yard drive.|$|E

5|$|One of Robinson's professors, James E. Boyd, {{convinced}} him {{to give up the}} radio repair business and work as a research assistant <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech Research Institute (then known as the Engineering Experiment Station, or EES). One of his ham radio friends was actually his boss's boss and EES director, Gerald Rosselot. Working after hours at EES, Robinson built a television set in the lab, which he and others claim was the first to be built in the state of Georgia. In 1950, Robinson went to Tennessee to work in nuclear engineering for Oak Ridge National Laboratory, servicing radiology-related equipment at local hospitals.|$|E
5|$|Robinson {{was born}} in 1923 in Crescent City, Florida, an {{outskirt}} of Jacksonville, to Glen Parmelee and Laura Mae (Lewis) Robinson. His family moved to Valdosta, Georgia, in 1937. After attending high school at Marion Military Institute in Alabama, Robinson opened a small machine shop in Valdosta. He sold industrial products and metal tools to local industry. In 1942, with the encouragement of his father, Robinson enrolled as a student <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> Institute of Technology to study chemical engineering. However, his education was interrupted by his enlistment into the Naval Signal Corps and service in the Pacific Theatre of World War II where he installed telephones on recaptured American possessions during the war.|$|E
5|$|Students {{across the}} nation protested the Vietnam War, {{including}} at similar {{institutions such as the}} Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where students picketed and blocked access to the Draper Laboratory that was producing guidance systems for the Poseidon missile. While The Technique did publish editorials against the United States' involvement, the Student Council easily defeated a bill endorsing the Vietnam Moratorium in the fall of 1969. There were significant protests at other institutions that conducted military research, but there were no protests against the military electronics research <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> Tech Research Institute.|$|E

5|$|The 2006 Chick-fil-A Bowl was a postseason college {{football}} match between the Georgia Bulldogs and the Virginia Tech Hokies <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> Dome in Atlanta, Georgia. The University of Georgia represented the Southeastern Conference (SEC) and Virginia Tech represented the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in the competition. The game {{was the final}} competition of the 2006 football season for each team and resulted in a 31–24 Georgia victory, even though spread bettors favored Virginia Tech to win by three points. In exchange {{for the right to}} pick the first ACC team after the Bowl Championship Series selections, bowl representatives paid US$3.25million to the ACC, while the SEC, whose fifth team was selected, received $2.4million. The combined $5.65million payout was the seventh-largest among all {{college football}} bowl games, and the fourth-largest non-BCS bowl game payout.|$|E

A wounded Pulaski was carried {{from the field of}} battle and taken aboard the South Carolina merchant brig privateer Wasp, under the command of Captain Samuel Bulfinch, where he died two days later, having never regained consciousness. His death, perceived by American Patriot supporters as heroic, further boosted his reputation in America.|$|E
5|$|Johnson and the Lions {{faced the}} Atlanta Falcons {{on the road}} on September 7, 2008, in the season opener <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Georgia</b> Dome. As the {{official}} starting wide receiver behind Roy Williams, Johnson led the team in receptions and yards, collecting 7catches for 107yards, which included one 38-yard catch-and-run in the Lions' 34–21 loss. During Week2 versus the Green Bay Packers, he had two key touchdowns late in the game, which sparked a large comeback, though the Lions eventually lost the game, 4825. Both touchdowns catches included a run after the catch (the first catch going for 38yards and the second going for 47yards, both over the middle) displaying Johnson's speed and breakaway ability. He ended the game with 6receptions for 129yards and 2touchdowns. In the following two games, losses to San Francisco and Chicago, Johnson failed to score a touchdown or gain over 50yards receiving. However, against the Minnesota Vikings, Johnson had 4receptions for 85yards and his third touchdown of the season.|$|E
