2500|$|During congressional {{hearings}} held in November 2008 at Washington D.C., {{and in a}} show of support, Ford's Alan Mulally stated that [...] "We at Ford are hopeful that we have enough liquidity.

Mulally went on to state that [...] "The collapse of one of our competitors would have a severe impact on Ford" [...] and that Ford Motor Company's supports both Chrysler and General Motors in their search for government bridge loans in the face of conditions caused by the 2008 financial crisis. Together, the three companies presented action plans for the sustainability of the industry. Mulally stated that [...] "In addition to our plan, we are also here today to request support for the industry. In the near-term, Ford does not require <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> government <b>bridge</b> loan. However, we request a credit line of $9 billion as a critical backstop or safeguard against worsening conditions as we drive transformational change in our company" [...] GM and Chrysler received government loans and financing through T.A.R.P. legislation funding provisions.|$|R
50|$|If a {{defendant}} can {{demonstrate that the}} government's action was done in bad faith, they can receive damages despite sovereign immunity. Typically if {{a defendant}} can demonstrate that the government intentionally acted wrongly with {{the sole purpose of}} causing damages, they can recover for injury or economic losses. For example, if <b>access</b> lanes <b>to</b> <b>a</b> major <b>bridge</b> are closed for repair and results in severe traffic congestion, the action was in good faith and the state couldn't be sued. However, if, as in the Fort Lee lane closure scandal, the lanes were closed in possible yet not proven retaliation against a mayor who declined <b>to</b> support <b>a</b> politician's campaign, with the explicit purpose of causing traffic jams, such lawsuits could proceed.|$|R

It is accessed from Parliament Square via the Carriage Gates. Underneath the yard is a five-level underground car park with 450 spaces for parliamentarians' cars, which was constructed between 1972 and 1974 at a cost of £2.5 million. Westminster Hall's north end is accessed via the yard, which is also the site of the Members' Entrance to the House of Commons.

An all-new station structure {{was included in the}} work. Construction was made more complicated because of difficult geological conditions. The upgraded station was officially opened on 8 August 2012. Its opening was the shortest of the eight steps which the Kolsås Line was reopening in. Because of this Sporveien T-banen skipped using a pilot on board the trains {{for the first time the}} train drivers ran on the new line. The opening did not alter the number of trains used on Line 2. Gjønnes was the terminus of the Kolsås Line until 15 December 2013.|$|R
40|$|This paper, {{based on}} vark {{undertaken}} {{as part of}} a Ph. D. studentship on new local rail staticms in West Yorkshire, seeks to offer guidelines for identifying and appraising new local rail station sites, and recommendations for further work on the subject. It outlines three methods of forecasting demand at such stations - a simple method based on mean trip rates at certain distance bands for similar existing new stations, an aggregate regression model, and a combination of a disaggregate mode split model for the journey <b>to</b> work with <b>an</b> aggregate non-work journey model. Whilst the latter models do provide greater accuracy, it is suggested that a simple trip-rate model may be adequate for one-off low-cost stations, although packages of stations and train service alterations need more thorough investigation. On this basis, it is suggested that for new stations with the characteristics of those in West Yorkshire (i. e. suburban stations in residential areas a few miles from major employment centres), sites which are free of significant engineering problems, with good road <b>access,</b> close <b>to</b> <b>an</b> existing <b>bridge</b> or crossing and with a population of at least 2, 000 within 800 metres of the site, should be sought. On single track rural branch lines, new stations may be justified at much lower population levels...|$|R

Additionally, the road has been upgraded and realigned over the years from its original tow-lane configuration <b>to</b> <b>a</b> four-lane divided highway, with the last such section being in Vienna, bypassed in 1991. As of 2008, there are plans for further upgrades to US50, including extending its freeway portion in Queen Anne's County to MD404 outside of Wye Mills and replacing the aging Harry W.

40|$|Two <b>access</b> {{embankments}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> railway <b>bridge,</b> having <b>a</b> {{maximum height}} of 18 m, experienced a continuous and severe heave shortly after construction. Vertical displacements reached 120 mm in a 2 -year period. The embankments were designed, by including soil–cement-treated transition wedges, <b>to</b> provide <b>an</b> increasingly rigid support as the trains approach the stiff <b>bridge</b> abutments. <b>A</b> grid of 10 m deep jet-grouting columns was also built, {{with the purpose}} of stabilising the embankments. Instead, a sustained swelling deformation, which extended to depths of 8 – 10 m, was activated. The compacted soil was low-plasticity clayey material, with a variable percentage of gypsum. The embankments suffered a massive ettringite–thaumasite attack, which was triggered by the simultaneous presence of cement, clay, sulfates and an external supply of water (rain). The paper describes the field extensometer and inclinometer records, the long-term laboratory tests performed, some mineralogical observations and the reactions leading to the growth of expansive crystals, and presents a model that simulates the measured heave. Forces acting against the bridge, which was seriously damaged, were estimated. Remedial measures include removal of the active upper zone of the embankments, and the construction in stages of slabs supporting the rails and founded on piles built {{on both sides of the}} embankments. The case is considered unique because of the magnitude of the reaction developed in the embankments, and its damaging action on the nearby bridge structure. Postprint (published version...|$|R
