40|$|The present {{investigation}} regarding the pilot's role in manned space flight {{takes into account}} space missions conducted with the Mercury capsule, Gemini, Apollo, Skylab, and the Shuttle. It is concluded that advancements in digital systems and automation technology have made many of the space pilot's tasks easier. However, these advancements have also made the space pilot's training more complicated. He must {{be familiar with the}} interrelated failure effects in highly complex vehicle systems. The nominal performance of the Shuttle fly-by-wire entry control system depends, for instance, on nominal electrical power from three fuel cells, nominal performance of three <b>hydraulic</b> <b>auxiliary</b> <b>power</b> units, five computers, other equipment, and microwave landing systems. The pilot must monitor and manage failures in these systems, and, in addition, must be prepared to intervene if an abort situation creates off-nominal conditions...|$|R

50|$|Depending {{upon the}} vehicle, whether an excavator, a back-hoe or a front-end-loader, the <b>auxiliary</b> <b>hydraulic</b> system may vary. Vehicle {{interface}} fittings, length from pump to attachment and vehicle control systems require various configurations of an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>hydraulic</b> system. <b>Auxiliary</b> <b>hydraulic</b> systems usually include external fluid fittings to facilitate connecting and disconnecting the {{hydraulic fluid supply}} lines of the attachments to the vehicles' hydraulic pump. They also usually include valves configured to control the supply of hydraulic fluid through the fittings.|$|R

The addition of an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>hydraulic</b> system to heavy construction equipment increases the versatility {{of the vehicle}} by allowing it to perform additional functions with different attachments.|$|R
50|$|The M88's {{primary role}} is to repair or replace damaged parts in {{fighting}} vehicles while under fire, as well as extricate vehicles that have become bogged down or entangled. The main winch on the M88A2 is capable of a 70-ton, single line recovery, and a 140-ton 2:1 recovery when used with the 140 ton pulley. The A-frame boom of the A2 can lift 35 tons when {{used in conjunction with}} the spade down. The spade can be used for light earth moving, and can be used to anchor the vehicle when using the main winch. The M88 employs an Auxiliary power unit (APU) to provide <b>auxiliary</b> electrical and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> when the main engine is not in operation. It {{can also be used to}} slave start other vehicles, provide <b>power</b> for the <b>hydraulic</b> impact wrench, as well as the means to refuel or de-fuel vehicles as required. The M88 series of vehicles can refuel M1 tanks from its own fuel tanks, but this is a last resort due to the possibility of clogging the AGT-1500s fuel filters. The fuel pump draws fuel from the bottom of the fuel cell, and with it, all of the sediment that has accumulated with time.|$|R

The emergence of electrical power during the 20th century meant hydraulic networks were gradually superseded; the Hull company was wound up in 1947 while the final London pumping station ceased operation in 1977.|$|R

40|$|Pigs {{have been}} {{reported}} to present with a stronger pulmonary vascular reactivity than many other species, including dogs. We investigated the pulmonary vascular impedance response to autologous blood clot embolic pulmonary hypertension in anesthetized and ventilated minipigs (n = 6) and dogs (n = 6). Before embolization, minipigs, compared with dogs, presented with higher mean pulmonary arterial pressure (Ppa; by an average of 9 mmHg), a steeper slope of Ppa-flow (Q) relationships, and higher 0 -Hz impedance (Z 0) and first-harmonic impedance (Z 1), without significant differences in characteristic impedance (Zc), and a lower ratio of pulsatile <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> to total <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power.</b> Embolic pulmonary hypertension (mean Ppa: 40 - 55 mmHg) was associated with increased Z 0 and Z 1 in both species, but the minipigs had a steeper slope of Ppa/Q plots and an increased Zc. At identical Q and Ppa, minipigs still presented with higher Z 1 and Zc and a lower ratio of pulsatile <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> to total <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power.</b> The energy transmission ratio, defined as the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> in the measured waves divided by the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> in the forward waves, was better preserved after embolism in minipigs. No differences in wave reflection indexes were found before and after embolism. We conclude that minipigs, compared with dogs, present with a higher pulmonary vascular resistance and reactivity and adapt to embolic pulmonary hypertension by an increased Zc without earlier wave reflection. These differences allow for a reduced pulsatile component of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>power</b> and, therefore, a better energy transfer from the right ventricle to the pulmonary circulation.
