The Gelug school <b>asserts</b> <b>that</b> {{he expressed}} Yogācāra views, most non-Gelug Tibetan commentators <b>assert</b> <b>that</b> he expressed Sautrāntika views and, according to one Tibetan source, a number of renowned later Indian Madhyamikas <b>asserted</b> <b>that</b> he expressed Madhyamaka views.|$|R

5|$|In 1994, Seoul {{newspapers}} {{reported on}} a book Chung published about the events of 1950, raising awareness of the allegations inside South Korea. In that same year, the U.S. Armed Forces Claims Service in Korea dismissed one No Gun Ri petition by <b>asserting</b> <b>that</b> any killings took place during combat. The survivors' committee retorted {{that there was no}} battle at No Gun Ri, but U.S. officials refused to reconsider.|$|E
50|$|There exist vastly differing {{views on}} the moral basis of sovereignty. A {{fundamental}} polarity is between theories <b>that</b> <b>assert</b> <b>that</b> sovereignty is vested directly in the sovereign by divine or natural right and theories <b>that</b> <b>assert</b> it originates from the people. In the latter case there is a further division into those <b>that</b> <b>assert</b> <b>that</b> the people transfer their sovereignty to the sovereign (Hobbes), and those <b>that</b> <b>assert</b> <b>that</b> the people retain their sovereignty (Rousseau).|$|R

25|$|In a reified RDF database, each {{original}} statement, being a resource, itself, {{most likely}} {{has at least}} three additional statements made about it: one to <b>assert</b> <b>that</b> its subject is some resource, one to <b>assert</b> <b>that</b> its predicate is some resource, and one to <b>assert</b> <b>that</b> its object is some resource or literal. More statements about the original statement may also exist, depending on the application's needs.|$|R
5|$|In 1997, the {{survivors}} filed a claim with a South Korean compensation committee under the binational Status of Forces Agreement. This time, the U.S. claims service responded by again citing what it claimed was a combat situation, and by <b>asserting</b> <b>that</b> {{there was no}} evidence the 1st Cavalry Division was in the No Gun Ri area, as {{the survivors}}' research and the 1961 official Army history of the war indicated.|$|E
5|$|Stowe, a Connecticut-born {{teacher at}} the Hartford Female Seminary and an active abolitionist, {{featured}} the character of Uncle Tom, a long-suffering black slave around whom the stories of other characters revolve.

5|$|The text classifies {{three levels}} of breath regulation, namely Puraka (पूरक, satisfying), Kumbhaka (कुम्भक, prominent) and Rechaka (रेचक, purging). The Puraka {{exercise}} is shortest and counts twelve moments (matras, music beats); the Kumbhaka is medium and stretches over twenty-four moments, while the Rechaka is highest lasting thirty-six moments. The text then describes various combinations of Puraka, Kumbhaka and Rechaka in various asanas {{for the purposes of}} energizing the Nadis and cleansing the body, <b>asserting</b> <b>that,</b> when mastered, Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana, Vyana and other vital airs help gain endurance, calmness, measured speed, ascension and inner healing. The text says that Pranayama exercises have therapeutic powers. Yajnavalkya describes Sanmukhi mudra, Kevaka kumbhaka and Sahita kumbhaka in chapter 6, <b>asserting</b> <b>that</b> the best exercises are those that make one feel lightness in the body and relaxation in the mind.|$|E
6000|$|We {{have seen}} that a Proposition of Relation, {{beginning}} with [...] "Some," [...] <b>asserts</b> <b>that</b> some existing Things, being Members of its Subject, are also Members of its Predicate.

5|$|Although Benchley {{was known}} for {{misleading}} and fictional autobiographical statements about himself (at one point <b>asserting</b> <b>that</b> he wrote A Tale of Two Cities before being buried at Westminster Abbey), he actually was the great-grandchild of the founder of Benchley, Texas, Henry Wetherby Benchley, who was jailed for his help with the Underground Railroad. Robert Benchley was born on September 15, 1889, in Worcester, Massachusetts, the son of Maria Jane (Moran) and Charles Henry Benchley.|$|E
5|$|Cagney {{was accused}} of being a {{communist}} sympathizer in 1934, and again in 1940. The accusation in 1934 stemmed from a letter police found from a local Communist official that alleged that Cagney would bring other Hollywood stars to meetings. Cagney denied this, and Lincoln Steffens, husband of the letter's writer, backed up this denial, <b>asserting</b> <b>that</b> the accusation stemmed solely from Cagney's donation to striking cotton workers in the San Joaquin Valley. William Cagney claimed this donation was the root of the charges in 1940. Cagney was cleared by U.S. Representative Martin Dies Jr., on the House Un-American Activities Committee.|$|E

50|$|Inclusivism, one {{of several}} {{approaches}} to understanding the relationship between religions, <b>asserts</b> <b>that</b> while one set of beliefs is absolutely true, other sets of beliefs are at least partially true. It stands in contrast to exclusivism, which <b>asserts</b> <b>that</b> only one way is true and all others are in error. It is a particular form of religious pluralism, though that term may also <b>assert</b> <b>that</b> all beliefs are equally valid within a believer's particular context.|$|R

If I say both at the same time, I am saying or doing something absurd. But the content of what I say—the proposition the sentence expresses—is perfectly consistent: it may well be raining, and I may not believe it. So why cannot I <b>assert</b> <b>that</b> it is so? ...|$|R
5|$|In 1946, Hensley {{married for}} the third time, but his wife, Inez Hutcheson, left him after {{less than a year}} of marriage. After their separation, Hensley began to preach in Chattanooga. During services, he began <b>asserting</b> <b>that</b> he had been {{miraculously}} healed after being paralyzed for a year following a coal-mining accident. Kimbrough disputes his claim, noting that there is no one-year gap in the records of Hensley moving or actively ministering. Hensley continued to live in Chattanooga until the early 1950s; he moved to Athens, Georgia, in the early to mid-1950s.|$|E
5|$|Khanh {{returned}} to the palace and reported {{the result of his}} conversation to the Ngos. He recommended that Diệm resign due {{to the demands of the}} rebel forces and protestors outside the palace. Madame Nhu railed against Diệm agreeing to a power-sharing arrangement, <b>asserting</b> <b>that</b> it was the destiny of Diệm and his family to save the country. Madame Nhu's aggressive stance and persistent calls for Khanh to attack, prompted the general to threaten to leave. This forced Diệm to silence his sister-in-law, and Khanh remained with the president.|$|E
5|$|Priestley's {{attempts}} to avoid political {{controversy in the}} United States failed. In 1794, the journalist William Cobbett published Observations on the Emigration of Dr. Joseph Priestley, which falsely accused Priestley of stirring up rebellion in Britain, and attempted to undermine his scientific credibility. His political fortunes took an even worse turn when Cobbett obtained a set of letters sent to Priestley by the radical printer John Hurford Stone and the liberal novelist Helen Maria Williams. Cobbett published the letters in his newspaper, <b>asserting</b> <b>that</b> Priestley {{and his friends were}} fomenting a revolution. Priestley was eventually forced to defend himself in print.|$|E
6000|$|If Lord Byron <b>asserts</b> <b>that</b> {{his wife}} deserted him, the {{assertion}} is accepted without proof; but, if Lady Byron <b>asserts</b> <b>that</b> he {{ordered her to}} leave, that requires proof.

5|$|Rolling {{resistance}} {{is also the}} reason at least one historical human civilization abandoned the use of wheels. During {{the time of the}} Roman Empire, wheeled chariots were common in the Middle East and North Africa; yet when the Empire collapsed and its roads fell into disrepair, wheels fell out of favor with the local populations, who turned to camels to transport goods in the sandy desert climate. In his book Hen's Teeth and Horse's Toes, Stephen Jay Gould explains this curiosity of history, <b>asserting</b> <b>that,</b> in the absence of maintained roads, camels required less manpower and water than a cart pulled by oxen.|$|E
5|$|The most {{controversial}} issue– {{the future of}} the city of Vilnius– was not explicitly addressed. When the agreement was signed, Vilnius was garrisoned by Lithuanian troops and behind the Lithuanian lines. Yet this changed almost immediately when the staged Żeligowski's Mutiny began on October 8. Soon after the mutiny, Léon Bourgeois, President of the Council of the League of Nations, expressed strong disapproval, <b>asserting</b> <b>that</b> Żeligowski's actions were a violation of the engagements entered into with the Council of the League of Nations, and demanding the immediate Polish evacuation of the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{two players}} {{did not tell}} their {{teammates}} or management about the deal, feeling that their interactions with bookmakers would meet with disapproval.

They remained silent even after they reported Pakistan captain Saleem Malik for attempting to bribe them during the team's subsequent tour of Pakistan. Australian coach Bob Simpson later said that he was unaware of these events, <b>asserting</b> <b>that</b> his anti-betting attitude would have deterred any players from discussing their involvement in such matters with him.|$|E
2500|$|While the Mādhyamaka school held <b>that</b> <b>asserting</b> the {{existence}} or non-existence of any ultimately real thing was inappropriate, some later exponents of Yogachara <b>asserted</b> <b>that</b> {{the mind and}} only the mind is ultimately real (a doctrine known as cittamatra).
