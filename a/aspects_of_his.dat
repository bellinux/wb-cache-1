5|$|Much of what {{is known}} of Allen's captivity is known only from his own account of the time; where {{contemporary}} records are available, they tend to confirm those <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> story.|$|E
5|$|Jovanovski {{is known}} as a two-way defenceman. Able to {{contribute}} offensively, he is an adept puck-carrier and joins plays deep in the opposing team's zone. He plays defence physically, bodychecking opponents primarily with his shoulder. In both <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> game, he is considered to play {{with a high level of}} risk, taking the chance of being out of position in favour of a good scoring chance or a hit.|$|E
5|$|Minneapolis {{was founded}} at Saint Anthony Falls, the only {{waterfall}} on the Mississippi River, {{because of the}} potential for energy created by falling, flowing water. Loring understood the city's geography—its waterfalls, lakes and river banks—and was able to use these unique <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> new home to slowly build his fortune.|$|E

5|$|Narayan {{increased}} {{the status of}} the sarangi to that of a modern concert solo instrument, made it known outside of India, and was the first sarangi player with international success, an example later followed by Sultan Khan. Narayan's simplified fingering technique allows for glide (meend) and affected the modern sarangi concert style, as <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> playing and tone creation were taken up by sarangi players from Narayan's recordings.|$|E
5|$|Narihira {{combined}} all {{the qualities}} most admired in a Heian courtier: {{he was of}} high birth (a grandson of the Emperor Heizei), extremely handsome, a gifted poet, and an all-conquering lover. He was probably also an expert horseman, adept in arms, and a competent official. These <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> life are not emphasized in The Tales of Ise, but they distinguish Narihira from other heroes of Heian literature, including Genji.|$|E
5|$|Notwithstanding these varied <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> public life, Rockefeller may {{ultimately}} be remembered simply for the raw {{size of his}} wealth. In 1902, an audit showed Rockefeller was worth about $200 million—compared to the total national GDP of $24 billion then.|$|E
50|$|Another {{the crucial}} <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{activity}} {{is also the}} role of scientific principles in art.|$|R
5000|$|The {{possibility}} that, {{since he}} was unsupervised, he was lying about some <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> accomplishment.|$|R
50|$|This was an <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{attempts}} {{to influence the}} way that Australian Settler society understood Aboriginal society.|$|R
5|$|Across all his {{bands and}} projects, Townsend has {{released}} twenty-three studio albums and three live albums. Townsend's trademark production style, featuring a heavily multitracked , {{has been compared}} to the styles of Phil Spector and Frank Zappa. His versatile vocal delivery ranges from screaming to an opera-esque singing, and his songwriting is similarly diverse. Townsend's musical style is rooted in metal, and his albums are written to express different <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> personality.|$|E
5|$|Despite his wealth, he was {{not known}} for a lavish life. His court of about a hundred people was not known for being overly extravagant, he built no luxurious residences, and did not even have a single {{portrait}} of himself made during his life. It is uncertain how Wiśniowiecki looked, although a number of portraits and other works depicting him exist. Jan Widacki notes {{that much of the}} historiography concerning Wiśniowiecki focuses on the military and political <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> life, and few of his critics discuss his successes in the economic development of his estates.|$|E
5|$|Fleming endowed Bond {{with many}} of his own traits, {{including}} sharing the same golf handicap, the taste for scrambled eggs and using the same brand of toiletries. Bond's tastes are also often taken from Fleming's own as was his behaviour, with Bond's love of golf and gambling mirroring Fleming's own. Fleming used his experiences of his espionage career and all other <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> life as inspiration when writing, including using names of school friends, acquaintances, relatives and lovers throughout his books.|$|E

50|$|Another {{significant}} <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{practice is}} {{the construction of}} immersive installations, which include painted walls and floors, objects <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own design, and found furniture.|$|R
5|$|Henry's {{relationship}} with the Church varied considerably across his lands and over time: as with other <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> rule, there was no attempt to form a common ecclesiastical policy. Insofar as Henry had a policy it was to generally push back on papal influence, increasing his own local authority. The 12th century saw a reforming movement within the Church, however, advocating greater autonomy from royal authority for the clergy and more influence for the papacy. This trend had already caused tensions in England, for example when King Stephen forced Theobald of Bec, the Archbishop of Canterbury, into exile in 1152. There were also long-running concerns over the legal treatment {{of members of the}} clergy.|$|E
5|$|In July 2010, {{plans were}} {{unveiled}} for a memorial garden to Robson {{to be built}} in Newcastle. It was to be created by the city council in partnership with the regeneration company NE1Ltd, and located on Gallowgate street close to the Newcastle United stadium St James' Park. Work began on the site in November 2010, which was completed by Spring 2011. The garden covers 400 square meters, and features a tiered seating area and sculpted stone plinths reflecting <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> life and work. The area also hosts 400 square metre memorial garden to Sir Bobby Robson.|$|E
5|$|In {{matters of}} character, Epaminondas was above reproach {{in the eyes}} of the ancient historians who {{recorded}} his deeds. Contemporaries praised him for disdaining material wealth, sharing what he had with his friends, and refusing bribes. One of the last heirs of the Pythagorean tradition, he appears to have lived a simple and ascetic lifestyle even when his leadership had raised him to a position at the head of all Greece. Cornelius Nepos notes his incorruptibility, describing his rejection of a Persian ambassador who came to him with a bribe. These <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> character contributed greatly to his renown after his death.|$|E
50|$|Later on he {{experienced}} a lessening <b>of</b> <b>his</b> health and so even this <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ministry {{came to an}} end. Brengle died on May 19, 1936.|$|R
50|$|The {{principal}} ideal theorem was conjectured by , and was {{the last}} remaining <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> program on class fields to be completed, in 1929.|$|R

5|$|In the 1990s and 2000s, Alasdair Cochrane studied {{politics}} at the University of Sheffield and the London School of Economics (LSE). His doctoral thesis, supervised by Cécile Fabre with Paul Kelly acting as an adviser, was entitled Moral obligations to non-humans. He subsequently became a fellow and lecturer at the LSE. During this time, Cochrane published articles in Res Publica, Utilitas and Political Studies presenting <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> interest-based theory of animal rights, which is defended in the final chapter of An Introduction to Animals and Political Theory. The book was Cochrane's first, and the political theorist Robert Garner acted as an important discussant during the writing process.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Beonna's life or his reign, as nothing in written form has survived from this period of East Anglian history. The very few primary sources for Beonna consist of bare {{references}} to his accession or rule written by late chroniclers, that until quite recently were impossible to verify. Since 1980, {{a sufficient number of}} coins have been found to show that he was indeed a historical figure. They have allowed scholars to make deductions about economic and linguistic links that existed between East Anglia and other parts of both England and northern Europe during his reign, as well as <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own identity and rule.|$|E
5|$|The {{traditional}} view of Gregory {{is that he}} was {{an orthodox}} Trinitarian theologian, who was influenced by the neoplatonism of Plotinus and believed in universal salvation following Origen. However, as a highly original and sophisticated thinker, Gregory is difficult to classify, and many <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> theology are contentious among both conservative Eastern Orthodox theologians and Western academic scholarship. This is often {{due to the lack of}} systematic structure and the presence of terminological inconsistencies in Gregory's work.|$|E
50|$|It {{was due to}} the secularist <b>aspect</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> {{personality}} that he was made a member of the Governing body of Guru Gobind Singh Foundation, Chandigarh.|$|R

5|$|Throughout the novel, varying {{perceptions}} of reality that arise due to cultural differences between its characters are emphasized and contrasted. Carpentier explores hybridization, nature, voodoo, ethnicity, history and destiny, confusion, violence, and sexuality {{in a style}} that blends history with fiction and uses repetition to emphasize the cyclical nature of events. The novel was largely well-received with much attention paid to Carpentier's inclusion of magic realism and The Kingdom of This World {{has been described as}} an important work in the development of this genre in Caribbean and Latin American literature. However, some technical <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> style have been ignored by the academic community, and the novel's narrative organization has been criticized.|$|E
5|$|While {{teaching}} at the Niedermeyer school Saint-Saëns put less of his energy into composing and performing, but after he left in 1865 he pursued both <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career with vigour. In 1867 his cantata Les noces de Prométhée beat {{more than a hundred}} other entries to win the composition prize of the Grande Fête Internationale in Paris, for which the jury included Auber, Berlioz, Gounod, Rossini and Giuseppe Verdi. In 1868 he premiered the first of his orchestral works to gain a permanent place in the repertoire, his Second Piano Concerto. Playing this and other works he became a noted figure in the musical life of Paris and other cities in France and abroad during the 1860s.|$|E
5|$|With Infinity, Townsend {{began to}} label all albums outside of Strapping Young Lad {{under his own}} name, {{dropping}} the Ocean Machine moniker, to reduce confusion. He wanted to show that despite the highly varied nature of his projects, they are all simply <b>aspects</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> identity. The album Biomech was relabeled and redistributed as Ocean Machine: Biomech, under Townsend's name, to reflect the new arrangement. Townsend's bandmates began to play two sets at their shows, one as Strapping Young Lad, and one as the Devin Townsend Band, playing songs from Townsend's solo albums.|$|E
