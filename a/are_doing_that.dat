In an interview with Digital Spy, Shearsmith said that this surprised him, saying [...] "I was upset, I did {{think it was a}} shame that it's not been recognised. You want people to have seen it and to have recognised the work, and innovation, but I think people <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that.</b> I get told that every day on Twitter, or in meetings." [...] A number of journalists expressed surprise that Inside No. 9 had received no BAFTA nominations, with Julia Raeside, of The Guardian, describing [...] "A Quiet Night In" [...] as [...] "one of the most inspired pieces of mute theatre I've seen on television".|$|E
500|$|Eminem {{has often}} name-dropped Vanilla Ice in his songs. Starting during taped freestyles {{he did with}} rapper Proof in 1992 where they {{performed}} against each other portraying Ice and MC Hammer, respectively. In his first single [...] "Just Don't Give a Fuck", Eminem mentions Ice alongside Everlast, boasting in a playful manner that he's a better rapper. In [...] "Role Model", Eminem says he ripped out Vanilla Ice's dreadlocks. Ice responded to in a magazine interview with Vibe saying that Eminem [...] "raps like a girl". While Vanilla Ice and Eminem neither look at their responses as an actual beef, Eminem did reply to the quote in his song [...] "Marshall Mathers" [...] which also featured a verbal attack on the Insane Clown Posse. Eminem mentioned Ice again in the song [...] "Purple Pills" [...] in 2001, which caused Vanilla Ice's only response in song. On his album Bi-Polar, Ice mentions Eminem {{in a positive light}} ("Hip Hop Rules") and in a negative light ("Exhale"), however, Ice stated that he has no bad feelings towards Eminem. In a 2002 interview, Vanilla Ice stated that he thought Eminem's references were flattering, going on to say [...] "I give him credit, I think he’s talented, I think he’s a killer rapper, you know I don’t compare myself to him because he’s another white rapper, I don't compare myself to any other rapper period, I don’t colorize hip hop, it’s stupid, but for people who <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> are just looking {{through the eyes of a}} racial standpoint, and it really shouldn’t be looked at that way, you’re looking at two musicians that are in a broad brand of hip hop, so you don’t need to compare us two. Following me, any white rapper is going to have to hear 'oh, you think you’re Vanilla Ice?', so I am sure he’s heard that." [...] In April 2009, Ice appeared in the music video for Eminem's song [...] "We Made You". In the 2011 single [...] "Fast Lane", Eminem raps about riding in his car while listening to [...] "Ice Ice Baby".|$|E

In a 2002 interview with Penthouse, Anthony Kiedis stated [...] "We were early in creating the combination of hardcore funk with hip-hop-style vocals. [...] We became, maybe, an inspiration to Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, Linkin Park – all these other bands that <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> now." ...|$|E

[...] A white man came on stage and introduced Sitting Bull as the man who had killed General Custer (which, of course, was absolutely false). [...] Sitting Bull arose and addressed the audience in the Sioux tongue, as he did not speak nor understand English. [...] He said, ‘My friends, white people, we Indians are on our way to Washington to see the Grandfather, or President of the United States. [...] I see so many white people and what they <b>are</b> <b>doing,</b> <b>that</b> it makes me glad to know that some day my children will be educated also. [...] There is no use fighting any longer. [...] The buffalo are all gone, as well {{as the rest of the}} game. [...] Now I am going to shake the hand of the Great Father at Washington, and I am going to tell him all these things.’ Then Sitting Bull sat down. He never even mentioned General Custer’s name.|$|E

60|$|Five guano-bags were packed, {{each with}} its bundle of gold, but the task was a disagreeable, almost a distressing, one, for the strong {{ammoniacal}} odor sometimes almost overpowered the captain, who had a great dislike for such smells.

He was trying to make his fortune, and when men <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that,</b> their likes and dislikes must stand aside.|$|E
