40|$|The use of Fibre Reinforced Polimer (FRP) {{materials}} for the repair <b>and</b> <b>strengthening</b> of Reinforced Concrete structures has become widespread recently. FRP materials are being prefered because they have very high tensile strength, resistance to corrosion {{and they do not}} affect the use of the building during the repair <b>and</b> <b>strengthening</b> process. Four reinfoced concrete beams repaired <b>and</b> <b>strengthened</b> with FRP materials have been used in this study which were performed at Pamukkale University-Faculty of Engineering- Civil Engineering Department- Structural Engineering Laboratuary. The behaviour of the beams before and after repair <b>and</b> <b>strengthening</b> was compared by obtaining the load- displacement curves under static loading. In this study, it was observed that the repair <b>and</b> <b>strengthening</b> of reinforced concrete beams by using FRP materials had increased the load carrying capacity significantly...|$|R

Hood's leeward position prevented deGrasse from bringing the convoy to the harbour, but the four previously blockaded French ships were able to sail out <b>and</b> <b>strengthen</b> deGrasse's position.

5|$|In May 1996, about 200 {{soldiers}} of the Central African Republic mutinied in Bangui, demanding salary increases and the abdication of Ange-Félix Patassé. In the aftermath, the renegades plundered and killed more than 50 people. Following this, the French troops stationed in the country suppressed the rebellion and restored the dictatorial power. After being elected, President Patassé announced a national unity government in early 1997. The Patassé government, the opposition parties, and religious groups signed the Bangui Agreements in January 1997 which were a series of measures designed to reconcile competing political factions, reform <b>and</b> <b>strengthen</b> the economy.

Asquith, the Liberal leader in the House, took up the allegations and attacked Lloyd George (also a Liberal). While Asquith's presentation was poor, Lloyd George vigorously defended his position, treating the debate as a vote of confidence. He won over the House with a powerful refutation of Maurice's allegations. The main results were to strengthen Lloyd George, weaken Asquith, end public criticism of overall strategy, <b>and</b> <b>strengthen</b> civilian control of the military. Meanwhile, the German offensive stalled and was ultimately reversed. Victory came on 11 November 1918.|$|E
5|$|The Christians, {{believing that}} this tribulation came upon {{them for their}} neglect of the Law of God and their {{religious}} duties, began to fervently read the Krista Purana, an epic poem {{on the life of}} Jesus Christ written by the English Jesuit Thomas Stephens (1549–1619).

According to Mr. Silva of Gangollim, a survivor of the captivity, if a person who had escaped from Seringapatam was found, the punishment ordered by Tipu was amputation of the ears, nose, feet and one hand.|$|E
