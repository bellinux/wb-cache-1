50|$|In 1906, all privately run {{main lines}} were nationalized under {{the newly created}} Japan Imperial Railway, which, at the time had a network of just over 7000 km. Automatic {{couplers}} were introduced on <b>all</b> <b>freight</b> <b>wagons</b> in 1926. In 1930, the first Tsubame ("swallow") express was introduced, reducing the Tokyo - Kobe travel-time to nine hours - a significant reduction from the twenty hours required in 1889 and fifteen in 1903.|$|E

The bridge between Haparanda and Tornio is the only direct connection between the Swedish and Finnish rail systems. The two networks use different track gauges, requiring <b>all</b> <b>freight</b> <b>wagons</b> crossing the border to have their cargo reloaded or their bogies exchanged. There is a dual gauge track, in a [...] and [...] four rail gauntlet track formation, between Haparanda and Tornio.|$|E

50|$|He hired local builder I.G. Mitchell to {{help make}} his dream come true. He {{designed}} five large arched windows and instructed the masonry crew in a distinctive design still unique in the 21st century. Above {{all of it was}} an engraved flagstone with the name Meeker Hotel and below it in smaller print, R.S. Ball. Throughout the next thirty years, Ball carefully labeled most pieces of Meeker Hotel furniture with these same initials. There are many people in the area who still have antique furniture with R.S. Ball carved neatly into them. In 1904, only eight years his last improvements, Ball felt compelled to expand again. I.G. Mitchell was once again used to add an east and west wing and attention was paid to continuing the same style. Arched windows and corbeled cornices added nice flair to what had become a large brick structure, constituting 200,000 bricks, <b>all</b> shipped by <b>freight</b> <b>wagon</b> from Rifle, Colorado.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a virtual <b>freight</b> <b>wagon</b> vehicle using virtual prototyping computer tools. The <b>freight</b> <b>wagon</b> considered as open type wagon “BOXN 25 ” of the Indian Railways. The <b>freight</b> <b>wagon</b> vehicle comprises of car body structure and two bogies. Solidworks is used for modeling the <b>freight</b> <b>wagon</b> and the geometry is exported to finite element tool, ANSYS. A multi degree of freedom system has been reviewed and compared with system having infinite degree of freedom (continuous structure). The current problem falls in the category of large models (Block Lanczos Algorithm is used) and has high degrees of freedom (PCG Solver is used). The structural dynamic response for the virtual <b>freight</b> <b>wagon</b> is determined. It is seen that the car body deformation is influenced by its elastic underframe and sidewalls. The influence of vibration modes, which describe local deflection, on the comfort level and stability of laden goods is discussed. Mode shapes up to a frequency of 30 Hz are considered...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this work}} is to present the use of {{composite}} materials {{in the construction of}} freight cars. Particular attention was paid to the use of these materials in the construction of a <b>freight</b> <b>wagon</b> door. It is dangerous when mechanical damage is made to wall panels of a wagon during transport. Improperly distributed transported material can exceed the allowable stress level and thereby damage the lining of the wagon. One possible solution to this problem is replacing steel plates with composite panels which have better mechanical properties and do not cause an increase of the nominal weight of a <b>freight</b> <b>wagon.</b> Design/methodology/approach: Experimental studies included: develop a research methodology of experimental tests of deformation of the wall door of a <b>freight</b> <b>wagon.</b> using strain gauge, placing strain gauges at key points, performed single-layer and double layer laminate panels with steel plates. Findings: Composite materials made of 5 mm steel plate and a multilayer laminated panels can be used in the construction of freight cars. Research limitations/implications: An expanded scope of the studies would include an analysis and synthesis of composite panels of various thicknesses, depending on the degree of damage to the hull of a <b>freight</b> <b>wagon.</b> Practical implications: Composite panels can be applied in the repair and construction of <b>freight</b> <b>wagon</b> shells. The obtained result shows the possibility of reducing the weight of the whole railway carriage and the price of a wagon repair, eliminating the need to completely remove the shell. Originality/value: Innovative use of composite panels in the repair and construction of structural elements of <b>freight</b> <b>wagons,</b> is new to the Polish scale. Initially DB Schenker Poland, is development of interest in further research and implementation of new technology...|$|R
