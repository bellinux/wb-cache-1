Borrowing on studies of ancient Greek drama, he calls these the four [...] "unities" [...] of <b>a</b> <b>shooting</b> sequence.|$|R

The promo was interrupted when Rhino delivered a Gore. Van Dam's former tag team partner Sabu then appeared following the lights turning off, and had a match with Rhino. Sabu won the match with Van Dam's help, as Van Dam delivered a Van Daminator on Rhino before Sabu delivered the Arabian Skullcrusher on Rhino through a table for the victory.|$|E

5|$|The {{roots of}} Tephrosia apollinea are deep, {{penetrating}} soils {{to a depth}} of 3 metres or more, aiding the absorption of moisture from the soil. Moisture is stored in the cortex of the roots, which is protected by a thin periderm. Water storage in the cortex enables growth and reproduction during times of drought, which allow it to thrive in both arid and semi-arid conditions and to survive during winter and summer months at times of low rainfall. The roots grow at a faster rate than the shoots themselves, and even at the early stage of the plant displaying <b>a</b> <b>shoot</b> the length of a cm, the roots may already be 30cm or more in length.|$|E

The last level before the final boss consists of a boss rush, where the player must fight all of the game's bosses again going through a short area based on the boss's home level.|$|E

5|$|The Capcom Five {{are five}} video games {{unveiled}} by Capcom in late 2002 and published from March 2003. At {{a time when}} Nintendo's GameCube console had failed to capture market share, Capcom announced five new GameCube titles with the apparent goal of boosting hardware sales and showing off third-party developer support. Capcom USA followed up with confirmation {{that they would be}} exclusive to the GameCube. The five games were P.N.03, a futuristic third-person shooter; Viewtiful Joe, a side-scrolling action-platformer; Dead Phoenix, <b>a</b> <b>shoot</b> 'em up; Resident Evil 4, a survival horror third-person shooter; and Killer7, an action-adventure game with first-person shooter elements. Though not directly related to each other, they were all overseen by Resident Evil director Shinji Mikami and, except Killer7, developed by Capcom's Production Studio 4. Capcom USA later clarified that only Resident Evil 4 was intended to be exclusive; the initial announcement was due to a miscommunication with their parent company.|$|E
