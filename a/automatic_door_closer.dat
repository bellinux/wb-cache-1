25|$|This is {{an older}} method of water-saving {{automatic}} flushing, which only operates when the room has been used. A push-button switch is {{mounted in the}} door frame of the restroom, and triggers the flush valve for all restroom urinals every time the door is opened. While it cannot detect the use of individual urinals, it provides reasonable flushing action without wasting excessive amounts of water when the restroom is not being used. This method requires a spring-operated <b>automatic</b> <b>door</b> <b>closer,</b> since the flush mechanism only operates when the restroom door opens.|$|E

50|$|Secondary to the airship, Tom {{needs to}} {{conceive}} {{of a way to}} neutralize recoil from the guns which he plans to mount: two 4-inch cannon, and several unspecified machine-guns.

Tom's invention is similar to the recoil system used in the French 75mm field gun.|$|E

5000|$|On January 5, 1975, Wilson died at {{the house}} he shared with his wife, daughter, and son in Houston's Fondren Southwest community. Wilson's wife, Bernice, found him in the {{passenger}} seat of his Ford Thunderbird, parked inside the garage, with the engine running. The garage was attached to the house, and the carbon monoxide gas fatally asphyxiated his son, Donald [...] "Alex" [...] Alexander (aged 5), who was sleeping in the master bedroom above the garage. Wilson's daughter Denise (aged 9), was found unconscious in another bedroom and hospitalized. Bernice was treated for carbon monoxide gas inhalation and for a jaw injury that she could not remember incurring. On February 5, 1975, Dr. Joseph Jachimczyk, the Harris County medical examiner, ruled the deaths of Don and Alex Wilson accidental. Dr. Jachimczyk's autopsy report showed that Wilson had a blood alcohol content of 0.167%. One theory is that Wilson drove into his garage, activated the <b>automatic</b> <b>door</b> <b>closer,</b> and then passed out.|$|E
50|$|The {{operation}} of the door open button is transparent, immediately opening and holding the door, typically until a timeout occurs and the <b>door</b> <b>closes.</b> The {{operation of}} the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> button is less transparent, and it often appears to do nothing, leading to frequent but incorrect reports that the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> button is a placebo button: either not wired up at all, or inactive in normal service. Working door open and <b>door</b> <b>close</b> buttons are required by code in many jurisdictions, including the United States, specifically for emergency operation: in independent mode, {{the door open and}} <b>door</b> <b>close</b> buttons are used to manually open or <b>close</b> the <b>door.</b> Beyond this, programming varies significantly, with some <b>door</b> <b>close</b> buttons immediately <b>closing</b> the <b>door,</b> but in other cases being delayed by an overall timeout, so the <b>door</b> cannot be <b>closed</b> until a few seconds after opening. In this case (hastening normal closure), the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> button has no effect. However, the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> button will cause a hall call to be ignored (so the door won't reopen), and once the timeout has expired, the <b>door</b> <b>close</b> will immediately <b>close</b> the <b>door,</b> for example to cancel a door open push. The minimum timeout for <b>automatic</b> <b>door</b> <b>closing</b> in the US is 5 seconds, which is a noticeable delay if not overridden.|$|R

[...] will be available for on-board use for a fee by business travelers. The e-ticketing system will be extended from booking tickets to booking coaches and entire trains, and also retiring rooms in stations. Electric mobility carts will be provided to elderly and handicapped passengers at all major stations. Also, [...] will recruit four thousand female constables and escorted carriages will be provided for women. A significant amount was announced for improving rail connectivity in north-east India.|$|R
