40|$|In two {{randomized}} crossover studies, the antihistamine, <b>acrivastine,</b> {{was evaluated}} {{for the treatment}} ofseasonal allergic rhinitis. One study on 31 patients found both 4 and 8 mg <b>acrivastine</b> given three times daily to be significantly better than placebo for alleviating hay fever. There {{were no significant differences}} in symptom scores between the two doses, although more patients (63 %) favoured 8 mg <b>acrivastine</b> over the 4 mg dose (46 %) or placebo (35 %). The other study found the higher dosage regimen to be similar in efficacy to 1 mg c 1 emastine given three times daily. Both dosages were significantly better than placebo for reducing symptom scores in all 18 evaluable patients. The incidence ofadverse experiences was low in both studies; there being no dose-related effects of <b>acrivastine.</b> In the second study, drowsiness, probably or possibly treatment related, occurred on seven occasions during c 1 emastine treatment and once with <b>acrivastine.</b> These studies indicate that 8 mg <b>acrivastine</b> given three times daily is both well tolerated and of equal efficacy to c 1 emastine for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Petasin (Ze 339) was {{recently}} introduced {{on the market}} as a potent herbal antiallergic drug for treatment of respiratory allergies such as hay fever. Few clinical studies have been performed so far addressing the clinical effectiveness of Ze 339. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the antiallergic properties of Ze 339 using skin prick tests with different stimuli, such as codeine, histamine, methacholine, and a relevant inhalant allergen. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was performed in which Ze 339 was compared to <b>acrivastine,</b> a short-acting antihistamine, in 8 patients with respiratory allergy and in 10 nonatopic, healthy volunteers. Antiallergic activity of Ze 339 was determined by analyzing inhibitory potency in skin prick tests with codeine, histamine, methacholine, and an inhalant allergen. Wheal-and-flare reactions were assessed 90 minutes after a double dose of Ze 339, <b>acrivastine,</b> or placebo. An interval of at least 3 days was left between the skin tests. RESULTS: <b>Acrivastine</b> was identified as the only substance that significantly inhibited skin test reactivity to all solutions analyzed in all study subjects. In contrast, no significant inhibition could be demonstrated for Ze 339 with any test solution. Moreover, the results of Ze 339 {{did not differ significantly}} from placebo. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we found no antiallergic, particularly antihistaminic, effect of Ze 339 in skin tests using a variety of stimuli often used to evaluate immediate skin test reactivity. The mechanism by which Ze 339 is effective in the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis still needs to be elucidated...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the effects of H 1 -antihistamines of the 1 st generation (antazoline, bromadryl, brompheniramine, dithiaden, cyclizine, chlorcyclizine, chlorpheniramine, clemastine) and the 2 nd generation (<b>acrivastine,</b> ketotifen, and loratadine) on the respiratory burst of phagocytes. Reactive oxygen species generation in neutrophils isolated from rat blood was measured using luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence. Changes in nitrite formation and iNOS protein expression by RAW 264. 7 macrophages were analysed using Griess reaction and Western blotting. The antioxidative properties of drugs in cell-free systems were detected spectrophotometrically, luminometrically, fluorimetrically, and amperometrically. The majority of the H 1 -antihistamines tested (bromadryl, brompheniramine, chlorcyclizine, chlorpheniramine, clemastine, dithiaden, and ketotifen) exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on the chemiluminescence activity of phagocytes. H 1 -antihistamines did not show significant scavenging properties against superoxide anion and hydroxyl radical, thus this could not contribute to the inhibition of chemiluminescence. H 1 -antihistamines had a different ability to modulate nitric oxide production by LPS-stimulated macrophages. Bromadryl, clemastine, and dithiaden were the most effective since they inhibited iNOS expression, which was followed by a significant reduction in nitrite levels. H 1 -antihistamines had no scavenging activity against nitric oxide. It can be concluded that the effects observed in the H 1 -antihistamines tested are not mediated exclusively via H 1 -receptor pathway or by direct antioxidative properties. Based on our results, antihistamines not interfering with the microbicidal mechanisms of leukocytes (antazoline, <b>acrivastine</b> and cyclizine) could be used preferentially in infections. Other antihistamines should be used, under pathological conditions accompanied by the overproduction of reactive oxygen species...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis A is {{an acute}} {{infectious}} {{disease of the}} liver caused by the hepatitis A virus. Many cases {{have little or no}} symptoms. In our case, a nineteen year old female patient referred our hospital because of exhaustion, jaundice and diffuse itching complaints which existed for one week. In dermatological examination, there were diffusely erythematous, excoriated papules with crusts on the body as more significant on the lower extremity. The patient was diagnosed with acute viral hepatitis A and generalized pruritus according to present findings. Cholestyramine 16 g/day and <b>acrivastine</b> tablet as 1 x 1 were started to administrate for hyperbilirubinemia and itching. The patient whose complaints regressed partially at the eighth day of the treatment was discharged by her own will. Consequently, patients with generalized pruritus who do not have any previous primary cutaneous disorders could be tested for HAV infection. J Microbiol Infect Dis 2015; 5 (4) : 184 - 18...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{partitioning}} of cetirizine in a phosphatidylcholine liposomes/water {{system was}} {{compared with that}} of hydroxyzine and <b>acrivastine</b> to gain insight into the mechanisms of interaction of its various electrical species with membranes. METHODS: The lipophilicity profiles of the compounds were obtained from equilibrium dialysis and potentiometry, and compared with changes in NMR relaxation rates. RESULTS: The neutral form of hydroxyzine interacted mainly via hydrophobic interactions with the bilayer lipid core of the membrane, whereas for the cationic form both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions were involved. Zwitterionic and anionic cetirizine were less lipophilic than its cation, which behaved like the corresponding species of hydroxyzine. Zwitterionic cetirizine interacted more by weak electrostatic interactions with the polar headgroups of phospholipids than by hydrophobic interactions with the membrane interior. The lipophilicity of its anion reflected the balance of repulsive electrostatic interactions between the carboxylate and phosphate groups and the hydrophobic interactions with the lipid core. CONCLUSION: The study confirms that various mechanisms influence the interaction of solutes with liposomes. Combining experimental techniques and using suitable reference compounds proves useful...|$|E
40|$|Histamine H 1 -receptor antagonists are reversible, {{competitive}} inhibitors of {{the actions}} of histamine, a critical mediator in the pathophysiology of the allergic response. This review is mainly devoted to second generation antihistamines that possess a low sedation potential compared with first generation compounds. The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data of 10 compounds have been updated. Some values are lacking for drugs under development, but also for older antihistamines. Thereafter, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships are reported from published or original documents. A linear pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship has been found for <b>acrivastine,</b> astemizole, cetirizine, ebastine and terfenadine, whereas nonlinear relationships have been calculated for ebastine (in the dog), levocabastine, mizolastine, noberastine and terfenadine. It must be concluded that this type of approach for therapeutic optimisation is very fruitful and may enable large numbers of clinical studies to be avoided. Trends for the future include: (i) in vitro binding studies with the human H 1 -receptor obtained by molecular biology; (ii) the characterisation of the cytochromes P 450 responsible for the biotransformation of antihistamine; (iii) the calculation of the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship in healthy individuals; and (iv) prospective effect-controlled clinical studies...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This study {{aimed to}} design a {{reliable}} homology model of human histamine H 1 and H 4 receptors (hH 1 R, hH 4 R), that would guide future biochemical and genetic efforts in its evaluation as a potential therapeutic target. Furthermore, these accurate models could aid in the structure-based inhibitor design for antagonists against the histamine H 1 and H 4 receptors. The homologous protein sequences of histamine receptors were retrieved from the NCBI REFSEQ which by using the sequence alignment program ClustalW alignment of the human histamine receptors sequence with Bovine Rhodopsin was conducted to locate the homology aligned regions. The present study found that Asp 107 and Asn 198 are in favorable positions for anchoring histamine. Identification of novel interaction sites for antagonist binding mutational data suggest a crucial role for Asp 107, Trp 158, Phe 432 and Phe 435 in antagonist binding. This study identified several novel amino acids at the binding site. Binding mode analysis of known H 1 antagonists four known H 1 antagonists (mepyramine, <b>acrivastine,</b> desloratadine, loratadine) were docked successfully to the binding site of the hH 1 R model by FlexiDock. The ligand used for optimizing the receptor model, the pharmacophore constraints and the different scoring functions applied in high throughput docking had all {{significant effect on the}} results. This research identified 16 compounds with 7 significant H 4 activities representing an overall hit rate of 5. 2 %. To the best of our knowledge, {{this is one of the}} largest structure-based virtual screenings, where the virtual hits were confirmed by an in vitro assay. Moreover, this is the first structure-based drug design study reported on the hH 4 R. After the virtual screening, we identified several novel ligands with significant H 4 affinity. These scaffolds can serve as starting points in the development of potent and selective H 4 ligands in future...|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{enormous}} success of second generation antihistamines, in the mid- 1980 s, about 10 {{years after their}} introduction in the market, several reports appeared in the literature indicating the rare occurrence of a form of polymorphic ventricular dysrhythmia, the 'torsade de pointes', after the administration of astemizole or terfenadine. This cardiac side-effect has been interpreted {{as a consequence of}} the interference of these drugs with cardiac K+ channels involved in action potential repolarization, and in particular with the IKr component of the cardiac repolarizing current. As the K+ channels encoded by the human ether-a-gogo-related gene (HERG) seem to represent the molecular basis of IKr, this cardiac K+ channel was soon recognized as a primary target for second generation antihistamine-induced proarrhythmic effects. In fact, both terfenadine and astemizole have been shown to block HERG K+ channels in a concentration range similar to that found in the plasma of subjects with cardiotoxic manifestations. However, no correlation can be found between the ability to prolong the cardiac action potential duration and the H 1 -antagonistic activity by several antihistamines, suggesting that HERG blockade and cardiotoxic potential are not class properties of second generation antihistamines. In fact, other molecules such as cetirizine, loratadine, <b>acrivastine,</b> and fexofenadine seem to lack both cardiotoxic potential and HERG-blocking ability at therapeutically relevant concentrations. The marked heterogeneity displayed by second generation antihistamines in their ability to prolong the cardiac action potential duration and to block HERG K+ channels might be of considerable therapeutical significance for those patients at risk of developing cardiac dysrhythmias and in need of therapy with H 1 -receptor blockers; it also emphasizes the importance of an evaluation of the possible blockade of HERG K+ channels during the early developmental phases of novel compounds belonging to this therapeutical class...|$|E

40|$|Background: Since all antihistamines {{are capable}} of {{crossing}} the blood-brain barrier, they may also cause sedation which may impair daily activities such as driving a car. The purpose of this review {{was to examine the}} effects of antihistamines on driving ability. Method: A literature search revealed 18 double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials that applied the on-road highway driving test. In this test, subjects are instructed to drive 100 -km on a public highway with a steady lateral position and a constant speed (95 km/h). Primary outcome measure is the Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP, cm), i. e. the weaving of the car. Results: The literature search yielded 18 clinical trials. At therapeutic doses, a single dose of diphenhydramine, emedastine and hydroxizine impaired driving comparable or greater than the effects of BAC 0. 08 %. Clemastine, triprolidine, mizolastine, <b>acrivastine,</b> dexchlorpheniramine CR and mequitazine impaired driving performance to the same extent as BAC 0. 05 %. For mizolastine significant impairment was only seen after higher than therapeutic doses. Results for cetirizine were mixed, illustrating the drug has the potential to impair driving performance, especially in sensitive subjects. Terfenadine, loratadine levocetirizine, desloratadine, ebastine, bilastine fexofenadine and rupatadine showed no driving impairment in the standard driving test after acute administration of their recommended dose. Several studies examined subchronic effects of antihistamines on driving performance. After 4 days of daily treatment significant driving impairment was found for emedastine (2 and 4 mg bid), diphenhydramine (50 mg), clemastine (2 mg bid), triprolidine (5 mg bid), after 5 days of ebastine (30 mg), and after 8 days of hydroxyzine (50 mg). Mixed results were found for cetirizine (10 mg), terfenadine (120 mg) and loratadine (20 mg). No significant differences from placebo were observed after 4 days of subchronic treatment with triprolidine (10 mg), levocetirizine (5 mg), fexofenadine (up to 120 mg), and after 8 days of daily treatment with dexchlorpheniramine (6 mg), bilastine (20 and 40 mg), and mequitazine (10 mg). Conclusion: First- and second-generation antihistamines may significantly impair driving performance. The newer antihistamines such as levocetirizine and fexofenadine that cross to blood brain barrier to a much lesser degree do not show clinically relevant sedation or driving impairment...|$|E
