40|$|<b>Abrasives</b> {{have been}} {{recovered}} from the slurry 	wasted of the factory where the silicon wafers for solar battery 	are processed.

However, Coach is too reluctant to tell her about Roy because she appears to like him and wants her father's blessings. To make matters worse, at Melville's restaurant, Roy forces her to pay for dinner herself, which makes Coach angrier. Therefore, witnessing Roy's treatment on her, Coach's friends convince him to tell Lisa about Roy before it is too late.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{lubrication}} {{properties of}} the slurry between the silicon wafer and the pad in chemical mechanical polishing (CMP) are critical to the planarity of the silicon wafer. Moreover, the suspending <b>abrasives,</b> which are contained in the slurry, have an extremely important influence on the lubrication {{properties of the}} slurry. In the CMP process of the large-sized silicon wafers, the influence of suspending <b>abrasives</b> on the slurry becomes more prominent. In order to explore the effects of suspending <b>abrasives</b> on the lubrication properties of the slurry under the light load conditions, a three-dimensional lubrication model based on the micro-polar fluid theory is developed. The effects of suspending <b>abrasives</b> on the fluid pressure acting on the wafer {{and the distribution of}} the slurry film between the silicon wafer and the pad are discussed...|$|R

Also, the kinetics of levitated <b>abrasives</b> including their positions and movements are precisely controllable by varying the wave frequency and switching from one node position to another...|$|R
