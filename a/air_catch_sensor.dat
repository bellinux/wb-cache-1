25|$|The {{display on}} a net sounder shows the {{distance}} of the net from the bottom (or the surface), rather than the depth of water as with the echo-sounder's hull-mounted transducer. Fixed to the headline of the net, the footrope can usually be seen which gives an indication of the net performance. Any fish passing into the net can also be seen, allowing fine adjustments to be made to catch the most fish possible. In other fisheries, where the amount of fish in the net is important, <b>catch</b> <b>sensor</b> transducers are mounted at various positions on the cod-end of the net. As the cod-end fills up these <b>catch</b> <b>sensor</b> transducers are triggered one by one and this information is transmitted acoustically to display monitors on the bridge of the vessel. The skipper can then decide when to haul the net.|$|R

50|$|Though he {{performed}} in a stylized costume consisting of a leotard and tights, he is generally {{regarded as one of}} the first gentleman jugglers, because {{he performed}} with everyday objects such as bottles, plates, glasses and umbrellas.

He also incorporated feats of strength in his act. One of his trademark tricks was supporting a chair in his teeth while juggling three balls. On the chair sat an assistant reading a newspaper, and on the assistant's lap was a desk.|$|R

50|$|In {{previous}} {{times the}} market was unpopular with the authorities, as it was largely unregulated and in some sense illegal. As recently as the 1930s, police cars and fire engines were driven down The Lane, with alarm bells ringing, to disrupt the market. The rights of the market were finally protected by Act of Parliament in 1936. As late as the 1990s, if Christmas Day fell on a Sunday (which in that decade only occurred in 1994), many of the local Jewish traders would still assert their right to open on a Sunday. 'The Lane' was always renowned for the 'patter' and showmanship of the market traders. Some, selling crockery, would pile an entire setting onto a large plate, and then send the lot, high into the <b>air.</b> <b>Catching</b> the construction on its way down was to demonstrate the skill of the vendor, and the robustness of the porcelain.|$|R
