5|$|The Screen <b>Actors</b> Guild Award, {{given by}} the Screen <b>Actors</b> Guild‐American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA), is an award {{dedicated}} to honor the best performances of <b>actors</b> in film and television. Poehler received three nominations.|$|E
5|$|The {{thematic}} and period {{setting of}} Carnivàle required an unusual casting approach. While some <b>actors</b> were hired for their genetic disabilities, most <b>actors</b> were specifically cast for their unique and distinct looks {{to fit the}} 1930s period. Award-winning costumes and make-up enhanced the illusion. Reviews generally lauded the <b>actors</b> and characters, and several <b>actors</b> received award recognition for their performances.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{characters}} are shared between Bright Falls and Alan Wake, including diner waitress Rose, Dr. Emil Hartman, radio host Pat Maine and Alan Wake himself, who appears briefly in the final episode. The <b>actors</b> who play these characters also serve as voice <b>actors</b> and physical models for {{the characters in the}} game.|$|E

5|$|A trial, {{in which}} the rebellious <b>actors</b> sued the {{management}} at the King's Bench over the management's occupation of the building that the <b>actors</b> controlled the lease, was held on 12 November. The judgment under Chief Justice Philip Yorke was in favour of the <b>actors,</b> and {{they were to be}} granted control of the theatre building in March 1734. Highmore, in response, asked for a charge against John Harper, one of the rebellious <b>actors,</b> for being a vagrant, and Harper was sent to Bridewell Palace prison. This provoked a negative reaction by the public, and the action was attacked in the Daily Post of 16 November. Eventually, a writ of habeas corpus was issued on 20 November and he was released without a case tried against him. Having no other recourse, Highmore began to negotiate the sale of the theatre license. Charles Fleetwood purchased both Highmore and Wilks's portions of the license on 24 January 1734. On 2 February, the Daily Courant announced that Fleetwood asked for the rebellious <b>actors</b> to return. An agreement was reached for higher wages and promotion of Theophilus to a deputy manager of the theatre. The <b>actors</b> took control of the Theatre Royal on 8 March 1734, marking the end of the rebellion.|$|E
5|$|<b>Actors</b> {{begin their}} {{training}} as young children, traditionally {{at the age}} of three. Historically, Noh performers had been exclusively male, but daughters of established Noh <b>actors</b> have begun to perform professionally since the 1940s. In 2009, there were about 1200 male and 200 female professional Noh performers.|$|E
5|$|After the {{founding}} of Night School Studio, the team set up a casting call for voice <b>actors</b> on Backstage. Prior to <b>actors</b> being cast and their lines recorded, the team had placeholder subtitles in the game. Lead engineer Bryant Cannon recalled that without the voices, he was unsure whether the game {{would be fun to}} play; after the voices were added, he could see the characters as believable people having conversations. Hines directed recording sessions, allowing him to change dialogue on-the-fly if he felt material did not work when voiced by the <b>actors.</b> All of the <b>actors</b> voiced their lines separately, with their conversations in-game stitched together in post-production.|$|E

5|$|Although other {{recurring}} {{characters in}} the Eon series, such as M, Q and Moneypenny, had continuity within the <b>actors,</b> the character of Leiter has not. In the nine Eon films in which Leiter makes an appearance, there have been seven <b>actors</b> playing the role. Only two <b>actors</b> have played the part twice: David Hedison and Jeffrey Wright. Wright's first appearances also made him the first African-American actor to play the part in the Eon series, although Leiter was also played by Afro-American actor Bernie Casey {{in one of the}} non-Eon films, Never Say Never Again.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the play, the <b>actors</b> file {{out slowly}} (most {{important}} first, with gaps between <b>actors),</b> and while they are on the bridge (hashigakari), the audience claps restrainedly. Between <b>actors,</b> clapping ceases, then begins again as the next actor leaves. Unlike in western theatre, there is no bowing, nor do the <b>actors</b> return to the stage after having left. A play may end with the shite character leaving the stage as part of the story (as in Kokaji, for instance)—rather than ending with all characters on stage—in which case one claps as the character exits.|$|E
5|$|For the film, Deodato cast several inexperienced <b>actors</b> {{from the}} <b>Actors</b> Studio in New York City. Luca Giorgio Barbareschi and Francesca Ciardi were cast {{in part because}} they were Italian <b>actors</b> who also spoke English. Deodato decided to make the film in English to appeal to a wider {{audience}} and to lend the film credibility. However, he also needed to establish a European nationality so that the film could be more easily distributed among European countries. Under Italian law, for the film to be recognized as Italian, Deodato had to have at least two native Italian-speaking <b>actors</b> to star in the film.|$|E
