5000|$|In 1986, KICU-TV debuted {{a half-hour}} early evening {{newscast}} at 7:30 p.m., called Action 36 News, the first newscast {{on a commercial}} television station in the market to have aired in the <b>prime</b> <b>access</b> <b>time</b> period. The program was eventually moved to 10:00 p.m. in 1988, placing it in direct competition with eventual sister station KTVU's higher-rated <b>prime</b> <b>time</b> newscast The 10 o'clock News. The newscast was anchored for several years by former KPIX-TV (channel 5) sports anchor Jan Hutchins and Bay Area news veteran Ysabel Duron; the station's reporting staff included among others Bill Buckmaster, Tony Russomanno and Melanie Morgan. During its first {{three years in the}} later slot, Action 36 News at Ten was accompanied at 10:30 p.m. by the nationally syndicated Independent Network News, which was produced by fellow independent station WPIX (now a CW affiliate) in New York City, until both programs were cancelled in June 1990. KICU revived its news department in 1992, with the debut of Action 36 Prime News, an early evening local newscast at 7:00 p.m. that aired seven nights a week; this program was cancelled in 1994. In 1995, the station began producing the technology-focused business news program Silicon Valley Business This Week, which aired until 1999.|$|R
