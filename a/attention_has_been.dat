To combat the criticism and prevent fraudulent accounting, various accounting organizations and governments have developed regulations and remedies for improved ethics among the accounting profession.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years, and for decades after his death, Poulenc had a reputation, {{particularly}} {{in his native}} country, as a humorous, lightweight composer, and his religious music was often overlooked. During the 21st century more <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> given to his serious works, with many new productions of Dialogues des Carmélites and La voix humaine worldwide, and numerous live and recorded performances of his songs and choral music.|$|E

5|$|Given {{that element}} 120 fills the 2f5/2 proton orbital, much <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{given to the}} {{compound}} nucleus 302Ubn and its properties. Several experiments have been performed between 2000 and 2008 at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions in Dubna studying the fission characteristics of the compound nucleus 302Ubn. Two nuclear reactions have been used, namely 244Pu+58Fe and 238U+64Ni. The results have revealed how nuclei such as this fission predominantly by expelling closed shell nuclei such as 132Sn (Z=50, N=82). It was {{also found that the}} yield for the fusion-fission pathway was similar between 48Ca and 58Fe projectiles, indicating a possible future use of 58Fe projectiles in superheavy element formation.|$|E
5|$|Scholarship in {{the area}} of Jewish Christian studies has tended to be based on {{artificial}} constructs similar to those developed by the early Christian heresiologists, with the underlying assumption that all of the beliefs and practices of these groups were based on theology. This has led to the perpetuation of ideological definitions that fail {{to take into account the}} pluriformity of these groups, reflecting differences in geography, time periods in history, and ethnicity. With respect to Epiphanius, and the Ebionites in particular, insufficient <b>attention</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> paid to the highly speculative nature of his theological constructs and his mixing together of disparate sources, including his use of a gospel harmony that may have had nothing to do with the Ebionite sect known to Irenaeus. In the end, he presents an enigmatic picture of the Ebionites and their place in early Christian history.|$|E

40|$|Disorders of <b>attention</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> {{recognized}} as a major legacy {{of all forms of}} brain injury since the beginning of this century. Until recently, disorders of <b>attention</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> overshadowed by disorders of memory as the major focus of research and cogni-tive rehabilitation. Neuropsychologists are now beginning to recognize the significance of attentional mechanisms in the mediation of many forms of learning and behavior. The present article attempts to provide a definition of <b>attention</b> that <b>has</b> relevance for rehabilitation therapists and others working in the field of brain injury rehabilitation. A review of those clinical studies that have attempted to improve the attentional capaci-ty and information processing skills of brain injured patients suggests that although behavioral aspects of attention are amenable to change and improvement, cognitive or information processing changes are not so easily achieved. Abnormalities of attention in asso-ciation with brain injury <b>have</b> <b>been</b> described in the psychological literature since 1904 (see Wood, 1987, for a review). In the majority of stud-ies, abnormalities of <b>attention</b> <b>have</b> <b>been</b> described in terms of how atten-tion interacts with a person's perform-ance on psychological tests.
