5|$|As late as 3–7 December 1939, when Lt. Col. Langer and French Air Force Capt. Henri Braquenié visited London and Bletchley Park, the British <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Polish cryptologists be made {{available}} to them in Britain. Langer, however, took the position that they must remain where the Polish Army in exile was forming—on French soil.|$|E

Judge Adams {{indicated}} that he would accept a supersedeas bond of $5,000, and Burton was not sentenced. Burton became the first defendant ever convicted under § 1782, more than 40 years after its enactment.|$|E

5|$|On 7 April The Guardian {{published}} the American banker's video, and {{later that evening}} handed it to an IPCC investigator and a City of London police officer who arrived at the newspaper's offices. The officers <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> video {{be removed from the}} website, arguing that it jeopardized their inquiry and was not helpful to the family. Nick Hardwick, chair of the IPCC, said the IPCC had asked The Guardian to remove the video only because {{it would have been better}} had witnesses not seen it before being questioned.|$|E
5|$|The 1999, it was {{reported}} that the Nagano Olympic bid committee had spent approximately $14 million to entertain the 62 IOC members and many of their companions.

5|$|At Easter, 1151, Theobald {{took over}} the {{management}} of the chapter's estates, as the new prior, Walter Parvus, was not up to the task. At first, there were no disputes, but soon the monks felt that Theobald was cheating them and imposing too rigorous a definition of poverty, and <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> stewardship of the estates be restored to Parvus. Theobald refused and the monks attempted to appeal to the papacy. Their envoys, however, were caught by agents of the archbishop and the appeal went nowhere. Theobald then deposed Parvus and appointed a new prior. Theobald's relations with the monks after this point seem to have been without incident.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge asked James Clay {{to protect}} his {{interests}} at the 1860 Democratic National Convention in Charleston, South Carolina. Clay, Lazarus Powell, William Preston, Henry Cornelius Burnett, and James B. Beck desired to nominate Breckinridge for president, but in a compromise with Kentucky's Douglas backers, the delegation went to Charleston committed to former Treasury Secretary James Guthrie of Louisville. Fifty Southern Democrats, upset at the convention's refusal to include slavery protection in the party's platform, {{walked out of the}} convention; the remaining delegates decided that nominations required a two-thirds majority of the original 303 delegates. For 35 ballots, Douglas ran well ahead of Guthrie but short of the needed majority. Arkansas's lone remaining delegate nominated Breckinridge, but Beck <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> nomination be withdrawn because Breckinridge refused to compete with Guthrie. Twenty-one more ballots were cast, but the convention remained deadlocked. On May 3, the convention adjourned until June 18 in Baltimore, Maryland.|$|E
5|$|Burnett {{took his}} seat in the 37th Congress; sources make no mention of his making good on his threat {{not to take the}} oath of office. Just days after the First Battle of Bull Run, Burnett's fellow Kentuckian, John J. Crittenden {{proposed}} a resolution blaming the war on the disloyal Southerners and defining the war's aim as preservation of the Union without interference in the rights or institutions of the states. Burnett <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> question be divided. His request was granted, but he only found one colleague willing to vote with him against blaming Southerners for the war.|$|E
5|$|Chandler's {{contract}} {{as baseball}} commissioner was {{not due to}} expire until April 1952, but he asked for the owners to extend it in December 1949. The owners voted against offering the extension at that time, but promised to consider the request again in December 1950. The vote in 1950 was nine votes for Chandler and seven against, leaving him three votes short of the necessary three-fourths majority. Chandler <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> extension be considered again at the owners' meeting on March 12, 1951, but the vote was again 9–7. Upset that his contract was not extended, Chandler resigned effective July 15, 1951.|$|E

5|$|Farmer's wife Rebecca {{filed for}} divorce on April 5, 2011, {{claiming}} in court documents {{that she had no}} access to the family's finances except the salary she earned as a teacher's aide. On April 12, Farmer petitioned the court to dismiss his wife's divorce petition, contesting the idea that their marriage was irretrievably broken. The divorce proceedings were put on hold by mutual consent on May 26, 2011, but in a July 12 hearing, Farmer's wife <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> judge schedule a trial date; the judge ordered mediation within 30 days instead. The mediation failed, and a trial date was set for November 22, shortly after the gubernatorial election. A second round of mediation shortly before the scheduled hearing resulted in a settlement between the parties; terms of the settlement were kept private.|$|E
5|$|Following the letters, Jackson {{received}} a parcel containing {{a photograph of}} the fan, as well as a letter and a gun. Jackson was horrified; the letter <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pop singer kill himself on a certain day and at a specific time. The fan would do the same once she had killed their baby. She wrote that if they could not be together in this life, then they would be in the next. To his mother's dismay, Jackson had the photograph of the woman framed and hung above the dining room table of their family home. Afterwards, the Jacksons discovered that the fan had been sent to a psychiatric hospital.|$|E
5|$|For the 2009 {{legislative}} session, Kefalas {{was named}} to seats on the House Appropriations Committee, the House Finance Committee, and the House Health and Human Services Committee. Kefalas has named health care reform as his top priority and plans on introducing legislation to create a single-payer universal {{health care system in}} Colorado during the 2009 session. The bill was introduced as a proposal to create a 23-member commission to make recommendations as to how to implement a single-payer system, and was reported favorably out of a House committee. However, Kefalas was one vote short of the 33 necessary to pass the legislation out of the house, and in April, <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> legislation be killed.|$|E

5|$|In March 1911, {{the captain}} of Saratoga, Cleveland Downs, faced legal {{difficulties}} regarding the way live turtles were stored aboard while being imported to market. Downs was arrested in New York on charges of cruelty to animals because the turtles had been stored upside down, with flippers lashed to one another; Miller contended that this was standard practice and <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> charges be dropped. A later Saratoga captain also faced legal troubles, when, in June 1912, Frank L. Miller was arrested by Sheriff Julius Harburger in New York and forced to post a $500 appearance bond in a civil suit involving a former crewman. Miller’s arrest delayed {{the departure of the}} ship by two hours.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of June 15, 1832, Captain Snyder and his men were in Kellogg's Grove when Native Americans were {{discovered}} in the area, during the night a horse was stolen. The next day, June 16, Snyder and his men pursued the Native Americans to the southwest; they came upon four natives and killed them. During the ensuing skirmish, Private William B. Mecomson was fatally wounded. The militia men put the wounded man on a litter and began to carry {{him back to the}} Kellogg cabin, along the way Mecomson <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> group stop to rest. The group stopped and some of the men went for water while the rest waited with Mecomson. As they waited, a large group of Native Americans came upon them; a short battle followed and two more militia members were killed. After the short skirmish, the natives left the area and the militia men returned to the Kellogg cabin and buried their dead the next day.|$|E
5|$|Ponticelli was {{the oldest}} living man of Italian birth and the oldest man living in France {{at the time of}} his death.

While he felt unworthy of the state funeral the French government offered him, he eventually accepted one. However, he <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> procession emphasise the common soldiers who died on the battlefield.

5|$|The League of Nations {{began its}} session on September 16, 1920. After reports by Lithuanian {{representative}} Augustinas Voldemaras and Polish envoy Ignacy Jan Paderewski, the League adopted a resolution on September 20. It urged both states to cease hostilities and {{adhere to the}} Curzon Line. Poland was asked to respect Lithuanian neutrality if Soviet Russia agreed to do the same. A special Control Commission was to be dispatched into the conflict zone to oversee implementation of the resolution. The Lithuanian government accepted the resolution. Sapieha replied that Poland could not honor the Lithuanian neutrality or the demarcation line as Lithuania was actively collaborating with the Soviets. The Poles reserved the right of full freedom of action. The Lithuanian representative in London, Count Alfredas Tiškevičius, informed the secretariat of the League of Nations that Sapieha's telegram {{should be regarded as}} a declaration of war; he also <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> League of Nations take immediate intervention in order to stop new Polish aggressive acts.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} made on a {{production}} budget of about $15 million and shot {{in various parts of}} Los Angeles, California, beginning on September 25, 2010. Locations were picked by Refn while Gosling drove him around the city at night. At the director's request, Los Angeles was picked as the shooting location due to budget constraints. Refn moved into a plush Los Angeles home and insisted that the cast members and screenwriter Amini move in with him. They would work on the script and film all day, then watch films, edit or drive at night. Refn <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> editing suite be placed in his home as well. With a shooting script of 81 pages, Refn and Gosling continued to trim down dialog during filming.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, the Aggies {{upset the}} Texas Longhorns, winning 20–16 {{in the annual}} rivalry game. The game began with a flyover of F-16 jets, all piloted by former A students, in the missing man formation. This flyover was donated by Senator Phil Gramm who, as an elected official, had {{the title of a}} fly-over reserved for his death and <b>asked</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fly-over be given instead in the honor of the 12 Aggies that died. At halftime, the Texas Longhorn Band dedicated their performance to the students lost and injured in the collapse, and ended by playing Amazing Grace and Taps, then removing their white hats in a show of respect as they walked off the field. The Fightin' Texas Aggie Band also played a tribute to the fallen and, contrary to the usual tradition, marched off the field in a silent cadence. Aggie students, who normally sit only when the opposing band plays, stood throughout both performances and gave both standing ovations.|$|E
