40|$|A {{variety of}} {{metallic}} components rely on properties that {{are specific to}} the alloy and its surface. Coatings have been extensively used to protect metallic surfaces from the aggressive effects of the environment {{to which it is}} exposed. In this investigation, the high temperature oxidation behavior of a FeCr and a FeCrY alloy coated with an <b>aluminium</b> <b>based</b> paint has been studied. The objective was to form the more resistant alumina surface layer on an aluminium free alloy. <b>Aluminium</b> <b>based</b> paint coated and uncoated specimens of the two alloys were oxidized for up to 200 hours at 1000 °C in air. The oxidized specimens were examined in a scanning electron microscope coupled to an energy dispersive system and the surfaces were analyzed by X ray diffraction analysis. The <b>aluminium</b> <b>based</b> paint coating increased the oxidation resistance of the alloys, mainly over extended periods. The FeCrY alloy coated with the Al based paint exhibited the highest oxidation resistance...|$|R

In this study, <b>aluminium</b> <b>based</b> composite were prepared with weight percentage of SiC reinforcement, varying from 5 to 20 wt%. Aluminium powder and reinforcement materials were mixed using ball milling machine with speed of 100 rpm for 2 hours. The powder mixture were then compressed at pressure 4 tonnes with 5 minutes holding time. The compact samples were sintered using microwave sintering technique. Microwave sintering techniques in this study using {{two different types of}} susceptor materials that are bottom ash and fly ash. Sintered <b>aluminium</b> <b>based</b> composites using bottom ash susceptor material involving the sintering temperature of 526 °C for 30 minutes whereas for the samples sintered using fly ash susceptor material, involving a temperature of 523 °C for 15 minutes.
