5|$|A {{continuous}} distillation {{is often a}} fractional distillation and can be <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> distillation or a steam distillation.|$|E
5|$|In 350 BCE, Greek philosopher Aristotle {{suggested}} that nature abhors <b>a</b> <b>vacuum,</b> a principle that {{became known as}} the horror vacui. This concept built upon a 5th-century BCE ontological argument by the Greek philosopher Parmenides, who denied the possible existence of a void in space. Based on this idea that <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> could not exist, in the West it was widely held for many centuries that space could not be empty. As late as the 17th century, the French philosopher René Descartes argued that the entirety of space must be filled.|$|E
5|$|A photon {{is a type}} of {{elementary}} particle, the quantum of the electromagnetic field including electromagnetic radiation such as light, and the force carrier for the electromagnetic force (even when static via virtual particles). The photon has zero rest mass and always moves {{at the speed of light}} within <b>a</b> <b>vacuum.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the name}} the vacuum state still has quantum fields. [...] <b>A</b> true <b>vacuum</b> is <b>a</b> global minimum of energy, and coincides with <b>a</b> local <b>vacuum.</b> [...] This {{configuration}} is stable.|$|R
40|$|In {{standard}} physics {{quantum field}} theory is based on <b>a</b> flat <b>vacuum</b> space-time. This {{quantum field theory}} predicts a nonzero cosmological constant. Hence the gravitational field equations do not admit <b>a</b> flat <b>vacuum</b> space-time. This dilemma is resolved using the units covariant gravitational field equations. This paper shows that the field equations admit <b>a</b> flat <b>vacuum</b> space-time with nonzero cosmological constant {{if and only if}} the canonical LNH is valid. This allows an interpretation of the LNH phenomena in terms of <b>a</b> time-dependent <b>vacuum</b> state. If this is correct then the cosmological constant must be positive...|$|R
50|$|A Nichols {{radiometer}} does demonstrate photon pressure. It is {{much more}} sensitive than the Crookes radiometer and it operates in <b>a</b> complete <b>vacuum,</b> whereas operation of the Crookes radiometer requires <b>an</b> imperfect <b>vacuum.</b>|$|R
5|$|Another notable {{feature of}} Tolkien's Elvish {{languages}} was his {{development of a}} complex internal history of characters to speak those tongues in their own fictional universe. He felt that his languages changed and developed over time, as with the historical languages which he studied professionally—not in <b>a</b> <b>vacuum,</b> {{but as a result}} of the migrations and interactions of the peoples who spoke them.|$|E
5|$|His {{early works}} in dynamics, {{the science of}} motion and {{mechanics}} were his circa 1590 Pisan De Motu (On Motion) and his circa 1600 Paduan Le Meccaniche (Mechanics). The former was based on Aristotelian–Archimedean fluid dynamics and held that the speed of gravitational fall in a fluid medium was proportional to the excess of a body's specific weight over that of the medium, whereby in <b>a</b> <b>vacuum,</b> bodies would fall with speeds in proportion to their specific weights. It also subscribed to the Philoponan impetus dynamics in which impetus is self-dissipating and free-fall in <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> would have an essential terminal speed according to specific weight after an initial period of acceleration.|$|E
5|$|In 1650, German {{scientist}} Otto von Guericke {{constructed the}} first vacuum pump: {{a device that}} would further refute the principle of horror vacui. He correctly noted that {{the atmosphere of the}} Earth surrounds the planet like a shell, with the density gradually declining with altitude. He concluded that there must be <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> between the Earth and the Moon.|$|E
25|$|Any {{event that}} changes the number of {{observers}} in the universe may have experimental consequences. Quantum tunnelling to <b>a</b> new <b>vacuum</b> state would {{reduce the number of}} observers to zero (i.e., kill all life). Some cosmologists argue that the universe is in <b>a</b> false <b>vacuum</b> state and that consequently the universe should have already experienced quantum tunnelling to <b>a</b> true <b>vacuum</b> state. This has not happened and is cited as evidence in favor of many-worlds. In some worlds, quantum tunnelling to <b>a</b> true <b>vacuum</b> state has happened but most other worlds escape this tunneling and remain viable. This {{can be thought of as}} a variation on quantum suicide.|$|R
5000|$|<b>A</b> robotic <b>vacuum</b> cleaner, {{often called}} a robovac, is <b>an</b> {{autonomous}} robotic <b>vacuum</b> cleaner that has intelligent programming and <b>a</b> limited <b>vacuum</b> cleaning system. Some designs use spinning brushes to reach tight corners. Others combine {{a number of}} cleaning features (mopping, UV sterilization, etc.) simultaneous to vacuuming, thus rendering the machine into {{more than just a}} robot [...] "vacuum" [...] cleaner.|$|R
25|$|<b>A</b> {{hypothetical}} <b>vacuum</b> metastability event {{would be}} theoretically possible if our universe {{were part of}} <b>a</b> metastable (false) <b>vacuum</b> in the first place, an issue that was highly theoretical and far from resolved in 1982. <b>A</b> false <b>vacuum</b> is one that appears stable, and is stable within certain limits and conditions, but is capable of being disrupted and entering a different state which is more stable. If this were the case, a bubble of lower-energy vacuum could come to exist by chance or otherwise in our universe, and catalyze the conversion of our universe to a lower energy state in a volume expanding at nearly the speed of light, destroying all of the observable universe without forewarning. Chaotic Inflation theory suggests that the universe may be in either <b>a</b> false <b>vacuum</b> or <b>a</b> true <b>vacuum</b> state.|$|R
5|$|The use of helium {{reduces the}} {{distorting}} effects of temperature {{variations in the}} space between lenses in some telescopes, due to its extremely low index of refraction. This method is especially used in solar telescopes where <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> tight telescope tube would be too heavy.|$|E
5|$|Three {{neptunium}} arsenide compounds {{have been}} prepared, NpAs, NpAs2, and Np3As4. The first two were first created by heating arsenic and neptunium hydride in a vacuum-sealed tube {{for about a}} week. Later, NpAs was also made by confining neptunium metal and arsenic in <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> tube, separating them with a quartz membrane, and heating them to just below neptunium's melting point of 639°C, which is slightly higher than the arsenic's sublimation point of 615°C. Np3As4 is prepared by a similar procedure using iodine as a transporting agent. NpAs2 crystals are brownish gold and Np3As4 is black. The neptunium antimonide compound NpSb was created in 1971 by placing equal quantities of both elements in <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> tube, heating them to the melting point of antimony, and then heating it further to 1000°C for sixteen days. This procedure also created trace amounts of an additional antimonide compound Np3Sb4. One neptunium-bismuth compound, NpBi, has also been reported.|$|E
5|$|While {{designing}} the Creighton-Ward Mansion sets, Bell {{and his staff}} strove for authenticity, ordering miniature Tudor paintings, -scale Georgian- and Regency-style furniture and carpeting {{in the shape of}} a polar bear skin. This realism was enhanced by adding scrap items acquired from household waste and electronics shops. For example, <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> cleaner pipe serves as Virgil Tracy's launch chute.|$|E
5000|$|Hard {{vacuum and}} soft vacuum are {{terms that are}} defined with a {{dividing}} line defined differently by different sources, such as 1 Torr, or 0.1 Torr, the common denominator being that <b>a</b> hard <b>vacuum</b> is <b>a</b> higher <b>vacuum</b> than <b>a</b> soft one.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> type of <b>vacuum</b> chamber {{frequently}} {{used in the}} field of spacecraft engineering is <b>a</b> thermal <b>vacuum</b> chamber, which provides a thermal environment representing what a spacecraft would experience in space.|$|R
25|$|If {{measurements}} of these particles suggests that our universe lies within <b>a</b> false <b>vacuum</b> of this kind, {{then it would}} imply—more than likely in many billions of years—that it could cease to exist as we know it, if <b>a</b> true <b>vacuum</b> happened to nucleate.|$|R
5|$|Atmospheric {{passivation}} gives titanium excellent {{resistance to}} corrosion, almost equivalent to platinum. Titanium {{is capable of}} withstanding attack by dilute sulfuric and hydrochloric acids, chloride solutions, and most organic acids. However, titanium is corroded by concentrated acids. As indicated by its negative redox potential, titanium is thermodynamically a very reactive metal that burns in normal atmosphere at lower temperatures than the melting point. Melting is possible only in an inert atmosphere or in <b>a</b> <b>vacuum.</b> At , it combines with chlorine. It also reacts with the other halogens and absorbs hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Bromine oxides {{are not as}} {{well-characterised}} as {{chlorine oxides}} or iodine oxides, as they are all fairly unstable: it was once thought {{that they could not}} exist at all. Dibromine monoxide is a dark-brown solid which, while reasonably stable at −60°C, decomposes at its melting point of −17.5°C; it is useful in bromination reactions and may be made from the low-temperature decomposition of bromine dioxide in <b>a</b> <b>vacuum.</b> It oxidises iodine to iodine pentoxide and benzene to 1,4-benzoquinone; in alkaline solutions, it gives the hypobromite anion.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{dreams of}} a red light that leads him to the corpse {{of a young girl}} buried in a park in Manassas, Virginia. When he awakens, he heads to the park and finds the girl's skeleton. The girl was {{determined}} to have been murdered by John Lee Roche (Tom Noonan), a serial killer who murdered thirteen girls throughout the 1980s; his modus operandi was cutting a heart out of the clothes of each victim. Mulder had captured Roche by deducing that he committed the murders while traveling as <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> cleaner salesman. Roche's hearts were never found, although he confessed to all of the murders.|$|E
50|$|The {{authenticity}} of a topological defect {{depends on the}} nature of the vacuum in which the system will tend towards if infinite time elapses; false and true topological defects can be distinguished if the defect is in <b>a</b> false <b>vacuum</b> and <b>a</b> true <b>vacuum,</b> respectively.|$|R

50|$|There was <b>an</b> {{optional}} <b>vacuum</b> tube detector, type DT-3-A, {{available for}} the SCR-54. It used <b>a</b> VT-1 <b>vacuum</b> tube powered by a BA-2 battery. The type number was originally SCR-55, later changed to DT-3, then DT-3-A. The crystal proved more popular in field use.|$|R
5|$|In 1844, the London and Croydon Railway {{was given}} {{parliamentary}} authority to test an experimental pneumatic propulsion {{system on the}} railway (referred to {{at the time as}} the atmospheric-propulsion system). A pumping station was built on Portland Road; this created <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> in a pipe paralleling the railway tracks. A piston extended downwards from the trains into a slit in the pipe, meaning that trains were literally sucked towards the pumping station or blown away from it. The pumping station was built in a Gothic style, with a very tall ornate tower which served both as a chimney and as an exhaust vent for air pumped from the propulsion pipe.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, Franck {{teamed up}} with Hertz to perform an {{experiment}} to investigate fluorescence. They designed <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> tube for studying energetic electrons that flew through a thin vapour of mercury atoms. They discovered that when an electron collided with a mercury atom it could lose only a specific quantity (4.9electron volts) of its kinetic energy before flying away. A faster electron does not decelerate completely after a collision, but loses precisely {{the same amount of}} its kinetic energy. Slower electrons just bounce off mercury atoms without losing any significant speed or kinetic energy.|$|E
5|$|In his 1638 Discorsi, Galileo's {{character}} Salviati, {{widely regarded}} as Galileo's spokesman, held that all unequal weights would fall with the same finite speed in <b>a</b> <b>vacuum.</b> But this had previously been proposed by Lucretius and Simon Stevin. Cristiano Banti's Salviati also held it could be experimentally demonstrated by the comparison of pendulum motions in air with bobs of lead and of cork which had different weight but which were otherwise similar.|$|E

5|$|Indium wire {{is used as}} <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> {{seal and}} a thermal {{conductor}} in cryogenics and ultra-high-vacuum applications, in such manufacturing applications as gaskets that deform to fill gaps. Indium is an ingredient in the gallium–indium–tin alloy galinstan, which is liquid at room temperature and replaces mercury in some thermometers. Other alloys of indium with bismuth, cadmium, lead, and tin, which have higher but still low melting points (between 50 and 100°C), are used in fire sprinkler systems and heat regulators.|$|E
5|$|Its usual {{commercial}} form is a powder, but this element can be consolidated by pressing and sintering in <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> or hydrogen atmosphere. This procedure yields a compact solid having a density above 90% of {{the density of}} the metal. When annealed this metal is very ductile and can be bent, coiled, or rolled. Rhenium-molybdenum alloys are superconductive at 10 K; tungsten-rhenium alloys are also superconductive around 4–8 K, depending on the alloy. Rhenium metal superconducts at 1.697 ± 0.006 K.|$|E
5|$|Metallic {{plutonium}} {{is produced}} by reacting plutonium tetrafluoride with barium, calcium or lithium at 1200°C. It is attacked by acids, oxygen, and steam but not by alkalis and dissolves easily in concentrated hydrochloric, hydroiodic and perchloric acids. Molten metal must be kept in <b>a</b> <b>vacuum</b> or an inert atmosphere to avoid reaction with air. At 135°C the metal will ignite in air and will explode if placed in carbon tetrachloride.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>vacuum's</b> suction {{is caused}} by a {{difference}} in air pressure. A fan driven by an electric motor (often a universal motor) reduces the pressure inside the machine. Atmospheric pressure then pushes the air through the carpet and into the nozzle, and so the dust is literally pushed into the bag.|$|R
50|$|Vacuum packing greatly {{reduces the}} bulk of non-food items. For example, {{clothing}} and bedding {{can be stored in}} bags evacuated with <b>a</b> domestic <b>vacuum</b> cleaner or <b>a</b> dedicated <b>vacuum</b> sealer.
