5|$|Descartes' famous {{argument}} for this position {{can be summarized}} as follows: Seth has a clear <b>and</b> <b>distinct</b> idea of his mind as a thinking thing that has no spatial extension (i.e., it cannot be {{measured in terms of}} length, weight, height, and so on). He also has a clear <b>and</b> <b>distinct</b> idea of his body as something that is spatially extended, subject to quantification and not able to think. It follows that mind and body are not identical because they have radically different properties.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{based on}} the fossil record, serology, karyology, behavior, anatomy, and {{reproduction}} reflect closer affinities with Procyonidae than Ursidae. However, ecological and foraging specializations <b>and</b> <b>distinct</b> geographical distribution in relation to modern procyonids support classification in the separate family Ailuridae.|$|E

5|$|Also of {{historical}} importance were the Ndongo and Matamba kingdoms {{to the south}} of the Kongo Empire, in the Ambundu area. Additionally, the Lunda Empire, in the south-east of the present day DRC, occupied a portion of what today is north-eastern Angola. In the south of the territory, and the north of present-day Namibia, lay the Kwanyama kingdom, along with minor realms on the central highlands. All these political units were a reflection of ethnic cleavages that slowly developed among the Bantu populations, and were instrumental in consolidating these cleavages and fostering the emergence of new <b>and</b> <b>distinct</b> social identities.|$|E

5|$|Ganesha is {{a popular}} figure in Indian art. Unlike those of some deities, {{representations}} of Ganesha show wide variations <b>and</b> <b>distinct</b> patterns changing over time. He may be portrayed standing, dancing, heroically taking action against demons, playing with his family as a boy, sitting down or on an elevated seat, or engaging {{in a range of}} contemporary situations.|$|E
5|$|His vocal {{style has}} varied from a screaming, yowling {{delivery}} as lead vocalist of the Pixies {{to a more}} measured and melodic style in his solo career. His cryptic lyrics mostly explore unconventional subjects, such as surrealism, incest and biblical violence, along with science fiction and surf culture. His use of atypical meter signatures, loud–quiet dynamics <b>and</b> <b>distinct</b> preference for live-to-two-track recording in {{his career as a}} solo artist give him a distinct style within alternative rock.|$|E
5|$|In between Carlton-Browne of the F.O. and I'm All Right Jack, Sellers {{starred in}} The Mouse That Roared, a film in which Jean Seberg also appeared, and was {{directed}} by Jack Arnold. He played three leading <b>and</b> <b>distinct</b> roles: the elderly Grand Duchess, the ambitious Prime Minister and the innocent and clumsy farm boy selected to lead an invasion of the United States. The film received universal and high praise by critics.|$|E

5|$|In {{classical}} Pentecostalism, the baptism {{with the}} Holy Spirit {{is understood to}} be a separate <b>and</b> <b>distinct</b> experience occurring sometime after regeneration. It is an empowering experience, equipping Spirit-filled believers for witness and ministry. Extending from this {{is the belief that}} all the spiritual gifts mentioned in the New Testament are to be sought and exercised to build up the church. Pentecostals believe that Spirit baptism will be accompanied by the physical evidence of speaking in tongues (glossolalia).|$|E
5|$|M. l. leuconotus is {{endemic to}} {{mainland}} Australia <b>and</b> <b>distinct</b> {{in that it}} is the only subspecies to have nuptial males that show prominent blue-and-white plumage. The name of this species is derived from the Ancient Greek leukos 'white' and notos 'back'. Birds in the southern parts of its range tend to be smaller than those in the north.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of these}} forms of {{assimilation}} are still at work today. For example, when a central authority nationalizes one language, that attaches economic and social advantages to the prestige language. As generations pass, use of the indigenous language often fades or disappears, and linguistic and cultural identity recede as well. However, some groups are seeking to revive their indigenous identities. One important political aspect of this pursuit is petitioning the government for official recognition as a separate <b>and</b> <b>distinct</b> ethnic group.|$|E

5|$|On December6 the {{hurricane}} {{turned to the}} south and southwest. As it did so, Epsilon passed beneath a mid-level trough that sheltered it from the wind shear. After weakening during the evening, the convection redeveloped around the large <b>and</b> <b>distinct</b> eye in the daytime, a process Epsilon had done repeatedly in its duration. However, late on December7, an approaching trough began increasing wind shear over the system, displacing the convection from the center and causing the eye to dissipate. After maintaining hurricane status for five days, Epsilon weakened to tropical storm status about 920mi (1480km) southwest of the Azores.|$|E
5|$|SIT {{will feature}} the Integrated Work-Study Programme or IWSP, which are {{longer and more}} {{structured}} internship with a stronger assimilation between classroom learning and practical experience at work. Such features will enable SIT graduates to seize new and diverse job opportunities.

5|$|Several Suillus species which grow under pines {{could be}} {{confused}} with S.brevipes. S.granulatus has a longer stipe, <b>and</b> <b>distinct</b> raised granules on the stipe. S.brevipes is differentiated from S.albidipes by not having a cottony roll of velar tissue (derived from a partial veil) at the margin when young. S.pallidiceps is by distinguished its pale yellow cap color; and S.albivelatus has a veil. S.pungens has a characteristic pungent odor, compared to the mild smell of S.brevipes, and like S.granulatus, has glandular dots on the stipe.|$|E

5|$|The casting {{approach}} for Carnivàle {{was to find}} the best available actors and to show the characters' realness as opposed to depending on freak illusions too much. Carnivàles casting directors John Papsodera and Wendy O'Brien already had experience in casting freaks from previous projects. They attended theater showcases, approached smaller agents or hired some actors directly to find people with unique <b>and</b> <b>distinct</b> looks, which was trying as Los Angeles is a stronghold of good-looking actors. The producers generally preferred actors who were not strongly identified with other projects, but were willing to make exceptions for established actors such as Adrienne Barbeau (Ruthie).|$|E
5|$|The character's origins lie of the {{accounts}} of Kings Duff and Duncan in Holinshed's Chronicles (1587), a history of Britain familiar to Shakespeare. Shakespeare's Lady Macbeth {{appears to be a}} composite of two separate <b>and</b> <b>distinct</b> personages in Holinshed's work: Donwald's nagging, murderous wife in the account of King Duff and Macbeth's ambitious wife Gruoch of Scotland in the account of King Duncan.|$|E
5|$|The head {{is fairly}} large <b>and</b> <b>distinct</b> and its sides are almost flat and vertical. The {{edge of the}} snout is usually raised into a low ridge. Seen from above, the rostral scale is not visible, or only just. Immediately behind the rostral, there are two (rarely one) small scales. Dorsally, there are usually five large plates: a squarish frontal (longer than wide, {{sometimes}} rectangular), two parietals (sometimes with a tiny scale between the frontal and the parietals), and two long and narrow supraoculars. The latter are large <b>and</b> <b>distinct,</b> each separated from the frontal by one to four small scales. The nostril is situated in a shallow depression within a large nasal scale. The eye is relatively large—equal in size or slightly larger than the nasal scale—but often smaller in females. Below the supraoculars are six to 13 (usually eight to 10) small circumorbital scales. The temporal scales are smooth (rarely weakly keeled). There are 10–12 sublabials and six to 10 (usually eight or 9) supralabials. Of the latter, the numbers 3 and 4 are the largest, while 4 and 5 (rarely 3 and 4) are separated from the eye by a single row of small scales (sometimes two rows in alpine specimens).|$|E
40|$|International audienceS. Weigmann {{recently}} synonymized the fine-spotted leopard whipray Himantura tutul (Myliobatoidei: Dasyatidae) {{with the}} darkspotted whipray Himantura uarnak, and the New Caledonian maskray Neotrygon trigonoides (Myliobatoidei: Dasyatidae) with the blue-spotted maskray Neotrygon kuhlii. However, Himantura tutul is genetically <b>distinct,</b> reproductively isolated, <b>and</b> partly <b>distinct</b> morphologically from the leopard whipray Himantura leoparda {{with which it}} was previously confused, and both are morphologically <b>and</b> genetically <b>distinct</b> from H. uarnak.
