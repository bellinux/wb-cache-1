5|$|Until 1926, Shamrock Rovers wore {{green and}} white striped jerseys but {{following}} a suggestion by a committee member, John Sheridan, the club chose to adopt the {{green and white}} hooped strip. A close relationship existed between the club and Belfast Celtic {{and it was on}} account of this that the idea was formed. The first game featuring the new jerseys was against Bray Unknowns in a FAI Cup match on 9 January 1927 at Shelbourne Park. The Hoops lost the game 3–0 and senior members of the club considered abandoning the new strip. Despite this loss, the team continued to wear green and white hoops <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> ever since. The 2007 season was the first season since the hoops were introduced that they were not continuous around {{the main body of the}} jersey. The style of the shirt sleeves has been changed on numerous occasions. The away colours of the club have varied over time. In the early 1980s, the club had a yellow away jersey. In the mid-1990s, a hooped purple jersey was adopted. In 2011, the team wore an all black away strip.|$|E

25|$|Organized social nudity usually attracts {{more people}} of European ethnic backgrounds.

25|$|Macclesfield Town {{play their}} home {{games at the}} Moss Rose stadium {{in the south of}} the town, <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so since 1891. The first game at the Moss Rose (on the ground {{adjoining}} the then named, Moss Rose Inn) took place on 12 September 1891 and therefore 2011 was the ground's 120th anniversary. Before moving to the Moss Rose, three other grounds were used: Macclesfield Grammar School, Rostron's Field (near Coare Street) and Victoria Road (then known as Bowfield Lane).|$|E
25|$|It {{appears to}} me that the {{developers}} have been completely indifferent to, or perhaps have even welcomed, this deterioration in the condition of the building, <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> virtually nothing to halt it.

25|$|Most Diaspora Jews {{identify}} with Zionism <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so since the 1930s, {{in the sense}} that they support the State of Israel, even if they do not choose to emigrate; the Zionist movement also has undertaken a variety of roles to encourage support for Israel. These have included encouraging immigration and assisting immigrants in absorption and integration, fund-raising on behalf of needs and development, encouraging private capital investment, and mobilizing public opinion support for Israel internationally. Worldwide Jewish political and financial support has been of vital importance for Israel.|$|E
25|$|Leading {{figures in}} the Catholic hierarchy, {{including}} cardinals and bishops, have sometimes actively campaigned against same-sex marriage or have encouraged others to campaign against it, <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> likewise with regard to same-sex civil unions and adoption by same-sex couples, and other LGBT rights (including non-discrimination). Some Church leaders have opposed decriminalization of homosexual activity in certain countries, and stood against a proposed call by the United Nations for global decriminalization of homosexuality. However, in other countries, and again at the United Nations, the church has opposed criminalization - reflecting {{a wide range of}} opinions within the global church.|$|E
25|$|The {{tourists}} {{had some}} success in their first tour games, winning three matches and drawing two. Hutton played in every other game, resting in between, but made scores of 37, 98, 102 and 87; the latter two innings saved the game against New South Wales. Hutton went into the first Test with no spinner. At {{the start of the}} match, he won the toss and chose to bowl. It was he first time an England captain had done so in Australia, but the fifth time the team had done so on tour. The tourists suffered early misfortune, with regular wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans ill and Denis Compton breaking his hand while fielding in Australia's innings. Critics regarded the decision as a mistake at the time <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so ever since, but Wisden's correspondent believed it may have been successful had England not suffered their bad luck and also dropped around twelve catches. Despite defensive bowling, Australia scored 601 for eight declared before England were bowled out 190 and 257 to lose by an innings; Hutton's scores were 4 and 15. Despite the result, Hutton increasingly saw potential in Tyson's bowling, arranging for Alf Gover, in Australia as a journalist but usually a respected coach, to improve and shorten Tyson's run to the wicket.|$|E

500|$|By [...] "traditional power", Russell has in {{mind the}} ways in which people will appeal to the force of habit to justify a {{political}} regime. It is in this sense that traditional power is psychological and not historical; since traditional power is not entirely based on a commitment to some linear historical creed, but rather, on mere habit. Moreover, traditional power need not be based on actual history, but rather be based on imagined or fabricated history. Thus he writes that [...] "Both religious and secular innovators – at any rate those who have had most lasting success – have appealed, as far as they could, to tradition, <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> whatever lay in their power to minimise the elements of novelty in their system." [...] (Russell 1938:40) ...|$|E
500|$|Medieval author Christine de Pizan {{solicited}} the Queen's patronage {{at least}} three times. In 1402 she sent a compilation of her literary argument Querelle du Roman de la Rose—in which she questions the concept of courtly love—with a letter exclaiming [...] "I am firmly convinced the feminine cause is worthy of defense. This I do here <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> with my other works." [...] In 1410 and again in 1411, Pizan solicited the Queen, presenting her in 1414 an illuminated copy of her works. In The Book of the City of Ladies, Pizan praised Isabeau lavishly, {{and again in the}} illuminated collection, The Letter of Othea, which scholar Karen Green believes for de Pizan is [...] "the culmination of fifteen years of service during which Christine formulated an ideology that supported Isabeau's right to rule as regent in this time of crisis." ...|$|E

500|$|Worldwide, horses play a {{role within}} human {{cultures}} <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so for millennia. Horses are used for leisure activities, sports, and working purposes. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that in 2008, there were almost 59,000,000 horses in the world, with around 33,500,000 in the Americas, 13,800,000 in Asia and 6,300,000 in Europe and smaller portions in Africa and Oceania. There {{are estimated to be}} 9,500,000 horses in the United States alone. The American Horse Council estimates that horse-related activities have a direct impact on the economy of the United States of over $39 billion, and when indirect spending is considered, the impact is over $102 billion. In a 2004 [...] "poll" [...] conducted by Animal Planet, more than 50,000 viewers from 73 countries voted for the horse as the world's 4th favorite animal.|$|E
500|$|Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem was {{developed}} {{exclusively for the}} PSP. Regarding PSP exclusivity, Rebellion lead designer Tim Jones explained [...] "It was basically a matter of logistics.

Rebellion decided to forego the first-person shooter format of their earlier Alien vs. Predator games and instead focused on a third-person perspective, with the player taking {{the role of a}} lone Predator. Unlike previous Rebellion Alien vs. Predator titles, Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem does not permit players to take the role of Aliens or human Marines. The company used a game engine of its own creation, and Hal Zabie, associate producer at Sierra Entertainment, said [...] "...the challenge was to deliver high quality graphics while not sacrificing game performance {{and this is something that}} Rebellion achieved and will be noticed by players right away." ...|$|E
500|$|The European leg of {{the tour}} {{featured}} two highlights. The group's 20 September 1997 show in Reggio Emilia was attended by over 150,000 people, setting a world record for the largest paying audience for a one-act show. U2 also performed in Sarajevo on 23 September, making them the first major group to stage a concert there following the Bosnian War. Mullen described the show as [...] "an experience I will never forget {{for the rest of}} my life, and if I had to spend 20 years in the band just to play that show, <b>and</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> that, I think it would have been worthwhile." [...] Bono called the show [...] "one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life". The tour concluded in March 1998 with gross revenues of US$171.7million and 3.9million tickets sold. The following month, U2 appeared on the 200th episode of the animated sitcom The Simpsons, in which Homer Simpson disrupts the band on stage during a PopMart concert. In November 1998, U2 released their first compilation album, The Best of 1980–1990, which featured a re-recording of a 1987 B-side, [...] "Sweetest Thing", as its single. The album attained the highest first-week sales in the US of any greatest hits record, while [...] "Sweetest Thing" [...] topped the singles charts in Ireland and Canada.|$|E
