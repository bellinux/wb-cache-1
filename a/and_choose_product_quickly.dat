Exerting self-control led individuals {{to rely on}} feasibility over desirability attributes, favor secondary over primary attributes, <b>and</b> <b>choose</b> <b>products</b> framed in a proximal rather than distal perspective. Process measures suggest that these effects occur because depletion from self-control heightens one’s focus on resources and prompts a lower construal level that is carried over to subsequent tasks. Stimulating individuals to adopt higher level construals diminishes these effects. These findings offer insight into the psychological process by which self-control influences subsequent decisions. ...|$|R

40|$|Organic food {{systems are}} based on a complex of value {{criteria}} that often are not explicitly considered when agents think, communicate, and make decisions concerning organic food. Multicriteria assessment (MCA) refers to a group of tools that help the user to tackle such highly complex issues. The question is how an MCA tool should be designed to facilitate reflections, communication, and decision making in relation to organic food systems. A key issue is motivation. There are several divergent theories of motivation, and the question cannot be adequately answered by using any single theory. We discuss an economic, a psychosocial, and a relational perspective on motivation and MCA. Using the example of a consumer assessing <b>and</b> <b>choosing</b> <b>products</b> in the supermarket, the economic conception of motivation offers a focus on decision-making processes. The psychosocial approach to motivation draws attention to the influence of cognitive structures and experience-based emotional drivers. Finally, the relational approach stresses that motivation is situated in the relations between agents. We discuss how the three perspectives converge and diverge regarding the purpose of using an MCA tool, the scope of the MCA, the strategic focus, and challenges and potentials associated with an MCA tool. Through this multiple-perspective approach, the general idea of MCA is expanded and elaborated to refine the design of an MCA tool for organic food systems...|$|R

40|$|Decision {{making for}} {{fast-moving}} consumer goods involves {{a choice between}} numerous similar alternatives. Under such demanding circumstances, a decision is made for one product. The decision {{is dependent on the}} interaction between the environment and the mind of the consumer, both of which are filled with information that can influence the outcome. The aim of this dissertation is to explore how the mind and the environment guides attention towards considered <b>and</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>products</b> in consumer decision making at the point-of-purchase. Consumers are equipped with several effort reduction strategies to simplify complex decision making. The selection of strategies can be conscious or automatic and driven by information in the environment or the mind of the decision maker. The selected decision strategy reduces the set of options to one alternative in an iterative process of comparisons that are fast and rely on perceptual cues to <b>quickly</b> exclude irrelevant <b>products.</b> This thesis uses eye-tracking to explore this rapid processing that lacks conscious access or control. The purpose is to explore how product packaging and placement (as in-store factors), and recognition, preferences, and choice task (as out-of-store factors) influence the decision-making process through visual attention. The results of the 10 experiments in the five papers that comprise this thesis shed new light on the role of visual attention in the interaction between the environment and the mind, and its influence on the consumer. It is said that consumers choose with their eyes, which means that unseen is unsold. The results of this thesis show that it is just as important to be comprehended as it is to be seen. In split-second decision making, the ability to recognize and comprehend a product can significantly impact preferences. Comprehension stretches beyond perception as consumers infer value from memory structures that influence attention. Hence, the eye truly sees what the mind is prepared to comprehend...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the knowledge of parents and caregivers with respect to the purchase, use and storage of liquid analgesics purchased over the counter (OTC) from pharmacies. This would enable specific strategies to be identified to increase awareness of the potential risks of these products. Methods: Questionnaires were developed and used a combination of Likert Scales, open ended questions and yes/no answers. Randomly chosen New Zealand pharmacies (463) were asked to approach a person purchasing liquid analgesics and ask them to complete the questionnaire. Of the 105 pharmacies that participated, 96 completed parent/caregiver questionnaires were returned. Results: When <b>choosing</b> a <b>product</b> there was a statistically significant difference between the most important factors ‘safety’ and ‘active ingredient’ and the least important factors ‘cost’ and if the parent/caregiver ‘used it before’. All parents/caregivers claim to have received verbal information from pharmacy staff, with 40 % stating that they ‘always’ receive information. The majority of parents/caregivers store medicines in a high place (n= 61), in a cupboard (n= 56) or a combination of these. Over half (52 %) of the parents/caregivers thought that children could ‘never’ open child resistant closures. Conclusion: Whilst parents <b>and</b> caregivers <b>choose</b> <b>products</b> based on perceived safety, there is an over estimation in the perception of the protection that a child resistant closure actually offers. The general public needs to continually be vigilant in the use, storage and administration when using medication in the vicinity of children...|$|R

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the technology of processing and sensory quality rating of cow?s milk <b>and</b> <b>chosen</b> <b>products</b> made of it. I have set two aims and from them arising research questions. The first aim was to describe the technological procedures of the cow?s milk processing and to describe partial steps {{in the production of}} <b>chosen</b> dairy <b>products.</b> The second aim was to evaluate sensory properties of dairy products of an ecological production and the products of a common food processing operation. The thesis is divided into two basic parts, theoretical and empirical ones. The theoretical part is aimed at the technology of the milk processing. There is the description of the production of chosen types of dairy products, such as consumer milk, sour dairy products and cheese. The aim was not only to describe the technology of the milk processing and the procedures of the production of dairy products, but also to capture the most frequent sensory defects and the causes of their formation. Further, the theoretical part is aimed at the pure dairy cultures. In this section of the theoretical part there is described the procedure of their gaining, the most frequently used kinds of cultures and their defects. The last but not least in the theoretical part, there are briefly characterised the most frequently occurring diseases transmitted by milk. The processing of these pieces of information was done through the study of the technical literature and the Internet sources. In the empirical section, I examined, if the technological procedures of the milk processing and the procedures of the fresh cheese production used on the ecological farm differ from the technological procedures used by the common food company. Further, I wanted to evaluate, if the differences occur in the sensory qualities of the products of these two producers. I attempted to capture the differences in the technologies of processing with the observation directly in the factories. Two institutions were chosen for the observation. As the first one the bio farm Slunečná in the Prachatice district was chosen. A common food processing operation was the second object of the research. It was MADETA, a. s. Jindřichův Hradec. I elaborated the data gained through this research into a clearly arranged table using the application Microsoft Excel. I examined the differences in sensory quality of the products by means of sensory analysis of the <b>chosen</b> <b>products.</b> Ten non-specialist evaluators of all age groups participated in the evaluation. They received the sensory questionnaire in which they marked their subjective feeling from the product tasting using the point scale. These parameters were evaluated: colour, consistency, smell and taste of the consumer milk, yoghurt, yoghurt milk and cheese. The evaluators always had two samples of every category. One came from the ecological production and the second one from the common food processing operation.

We develop an efficient algorithm to identify an optimal assortment. Second, we consider a setting in which the retailer also determines the selling prices. We show that in this case the optimal assortment does not include any dominated product and does not vary with the distribution of customer valuations when there is no fixed cost. We develop several efficient algorithms to identify an optimal assortment and optimally price the products.
