By December, however, MPs had criticised Post Office Ltd for how it handled the sub-postmasters claims, and 140 of those affected had withdrawn {{their support for the}} Post Office-run mediation scheme. 144 MPs had been contacted by sub-postmasters about the issue, and James Arbuthnot, the lead MP, accused the organisation of rejecting 90% of applications for mediation. Post Office Ltd said that the claims by Mr Arbuthnot were [...] "regrettable and surprising".

50|$|African {{cichlids}} {{also offer}} some evidence for sympatric speciation. They show {{a large amount}} of diversity in the African Great Lakes. Many studies point to sexual selection as a way of maintaining reproductive isolation. Female choice with regards to male coloration {{is one of the more}} studied modes of sexual selection in African cichlids. Female choice is present in cichlids because the female does much of the work in raising the offspring, while the male has little energy input in the offspring. She exerts sensory bias when picking males by choosing those that have colors similar to her or those that are the most colorful. This helps maintain sympatric speciation within the lakes. Cichlids also use acoustic reproductive communication. The male cichlid quivers as a ritualistic display for the female which produces a certain number of pulses and pulse period. Female choice for good genes and sensory bias is one of the deciding factors in this case, selecting for calls that are within her species and that give the best fitness advantage to increase the survivability of the offspring. Male-male competition is a form of intrasexual selection and also has an effect on speciation in African cichlids. Ritualistic fighting among males establishes which males <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> successful in mating. This is important in sympatric speciation because species with similar males may be competing for the same females. There may be a fitness advantage for one phenotype that could allow one species to invade another. Studies show this effect in species that are genetically similar, have the capability to interbreed, and show phenotypic color variation. Ecological character displacement is another means for sympatric speciation. Within each lake there are different niches that a species could occupy. For example, different diets and depth of the water could help to maintain isolation between species in the same lake.|$|E
5000|$|In 2007, Dylan {{appeared}} on several tribute albums, including Endless Highway: The Music of The Band and Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur, a charity album consisting of covers of John Lennon songs. On Endless Highway, Dylan performed {{a cover of}} The Band's [...] "Whispering Pines." [...] For Instant Karma, Dylan performed a cover of Lennon's [...] "Gimme Some Truth," [...] with Dhani Harrison contributing backing vocals on the song.In September 2007, it was reported by The New York Times that Dylan was recording his first solo album at producer, Rick Rubin's home in the Hollywood Hills. [...] Regarding its sparse instrumentation and production, Dylan described {{the differences in the}} writing process for Seeing Things, compared to writing for the Wallflowers: [...] A lot of times when you write songs, you’re aware that this line is just going to help you get to the next line and someone's probably going to do an organ fill right there anyway - you can let those go. But with something like this, it was just three instruments, really; vocals being one of the instruments, which then makes the lyrics being one of the instruments. You’re more aware that things <b>are</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> exposed and you can’t really let anything go unless you’re confident that this is what you want to say. Following the completion of recording in 2007, Seeing Things was released on June 10, 2008. [...] The album received generally favorable reviews and peaked at No.24 in the U.S. on the Billboard 200. [...] Following the release of Seeing Things, Dylan made several television appearances to promote the album and toured with a backing band called The Gold Mountain Rebels, which consisted of Wallflowers drummer Fred Eltringham, guitarist Audley Freed and bassist George Reif. In the summer and fall of 2008, Dylan and the Gold Mountain Rebels played a combination of theaters and festivals in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, including Farm Aid in Mansfield, Massachusetts and the Newport Folk Festival. In addition to touring with the Gold Mountain Rebels, Dylan and Eltringham also performed several shows with the Wallflowers in 2008.|$|E
