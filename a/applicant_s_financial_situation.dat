40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine the relationships between the financial management competencies of household money managers and the financial well-being of the household.

A path analysis model of a systems approach to family resource management was tested. Further, analyses of covariance were computed to determine the effect of knowledge on money manager 2 ̆ 7 s behaviors and outputs;The typical household money manager was a married 49 -year-old female living in a two-member household with a mean after-tax income of 24, 506 and a median net worth of 59, 200.

Money managers who were more knowledgeable practiced more optimum planning and implementing behaviors than less-knowledgeable money managers.

40|$|Abstract Background Access to {{low-cost}} essential generic medicines is {{a critical}} health policy goal in low-and-middle income countries (LMICs). Guatemala is an LMIC where there is both limited availability and affordability of these medications. However, attitudes of physicians and pharmacy staff regarding low-cost generics, especially generics for non-communicable diseases (NCDs), have not been fully explored in Guatemala. Methods Semi-structured interviews with 30 pharmacy staff and 12 physicians in several highland towns in Guatemala were conducted. Interview questions related to perceptions of low-cost generic medicines, prescription and dispensing practices of generics {{in the treatment of}} two NCDs, diabetes and hypertension, and opinions about the roles of pharmacy staff and physicians in selecting medicines for patients. Pharmacy staff were recruited from a random sample of pharmacies and physicians were recruited from a convenience sample. Interview data were analyzed using a thematic approach for qualitative data as well as basic quantitative statistics. Results Pharmacy staff and physicians expressed doubt as to the safety and efficacy of low-cost generic medicines in Guatemala. The low cost of generic medicines was often perceived as proof of their inferior quality. In the case of diabetes and hypertension, the decision to utilize a generic medicine was based on multiple factors including the patient 2 ̆ 019 <b>s</b> <b>financial</b> <b>situation,</b> consumer preference, and, to a large extent, physician recommendations. Conclusions Interventions to improve generic medication utilization in Guatemala must address the negative perceptions of physicians and pharmacy staff toward low-cost generics. Strengthening state capacity and transparency in the regulation and monitoring of the drug supply is a key goal of access-to-medicines advocacy in Guatemala...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the relationship of economic welfare and perceived financial adequacy and satisfaction of Omaha retired families. Secondary objectives were to examine the relationship between economic welfare and perceived adequacy and satisfaction and selected demographic factors and between income and economic welfare as measures of economic situation. Selected Omaha retirees were asked to complete the survey providing the necessary information to compute the economic welfare measure, background information and items to determine perceived financial adequacy and satisfaction. Background information included marital status, sex, race, age, education, family size, health and living situation. In addition, factors related to the retirement of both the family head and spouse were secured including information such as extent of and length of retirement, whether early retirement was taken, amount of income and type of employment prior to retirement. ^ The economic welfare measure was derived for each respondent by conversion of net assets into potential annual income possible if such assets were invested in a life-time annuity based on age, sex and marital status. The derived potential annual income was then added to current income and constituted economic welfare as used in the study. ^ Items to determine perceived adequacy were constructed for this study and were indicated through ability to buy needed items, having money left over at the end of the month, adequacy of resources so as to avoid dipping into savings for monthly expenditures and to meet doctor, dental and medical expenses. In addition, discretionary income, advanced retirement planning and sensing that needs were met adequately was indicative of perceived adequacy. Perceived financial satisfaction was indicated by being able to live the way desired, and to buy wanted items, lack of a desire for additional money with which to live, having saved financial resources prior to retirement, and an overall level of satisfaction depicted as pretty well or more or less satisfied. ^ Perceptions of financial adequacy and financial satisfaction were directly related to economic welfare levels of low, moderate and high. Economic welfare, as a measure of a family 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>financial</b> <b>situation</b> was significantly different than income and was a superior predictor of perceived financial adequacy and satisfaction. Sex, age, education, extent of retirement, health, income, home and automobile ownership, stability of residence and level of debt were significant predictors of economic welfare with automobile ownership and level of debt as primary predictors accounting for one-third of the variation. ^ Three measures of objectively determined adequacy including the poverty index, Model Budget for Retired Couples and the pre-retirement, retirement ratio were compared to subjectively determined adequacy. A direct relationship existed between an improved economic situation and an accurate subjective assessment of income adequacy. ^ Predictors of both perceived adequacy and satisfaction were economic welfare, debt, sex, health and net worth of automobile. In addition, extent of retirement was a significant predictor of perceived adequacy. Positive perceptions resulting from comparing one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> own <b>financial</b> <b>situation</b> to others and to previous time spans revealed a direct relationship to increased perceptions of adequacy and satisfaction and thus were identified as efficient predictors. ...|$|R
40|$|PhDThe {{subject of}} my {{research}} is the female consort and her court. I focus on three Austrian Archduchesses: Giovanna, Barbara and Eleonora Habsburg who came down to Italy {{in the second half}} of the sixteenth century and married into the ducal houses of Florence, Ferrara and Mantua respectively. My thesis compares the structures, roles and relationships in these three contemporary female courts, and analyses the consortsâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 reliance on personal consumption, gift-giving and patronage activities to assert their power, position and identity. My research is primarily based on the unpublished letters and accounts preserved in the three state archives of Florence, Modena (which contains the Este archive) and Mantua. My thesis starts with a background chapter on the history of the three Duchesses, and then turns to address each Duchessâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 <b>s</b> <b>financial</b> <b>situation,</b> the organisation of her court, her attitude to her husband and her new family and the particular circumstances of her life. This chapter sheds new light on the position of the consort, and sets the stage for the exploration of her patronage and consumption. My first case-study focuses on clothing. I examine the Duchessesâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9 choices in dressing themselves and their courts and analyse their treatment of clothing as a valuable visual language. My second case-study focuses on the gifts of food that were sent to and from the Duchesses. I discuss their function as items of relatively small economic value in the creation of patronage relationships and in the process of social and political mediation. The central tenet in my case-studies is that objects could act as coded messages, with multiple meanings which can be dissected by studying owner, receiver, means of transmission and the type of object itself. My approach employs material culture as a means for enriching current knowledge of a particularly under-researched subject: the female consort...|$|R

40|$|Mobile users {{engage in}} novel and {{exciting}} location-based social media applications (e. g., geosocial networks, spatial crowdsourcing) {{in which they}} interact with other users situated in their proximity. In several application scenarios, users define their own proximity zones of interest (typically {{in the form of}} polygonal regions, such as a collection of city blocks), and want to find other users with whom they are in a mutual enclosure relationship with respect to their respective proximity zones. This boils down to evaluating two point-in-polygon enclosure conditions, which is easy to achieve for revealed user locations and proximity zones. However, users may be reluctant to share their whereabouts with their friends and with social media service providers, as location data can help one infer sensitive details such as an individual 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> health status, <b>financial</b> <b>situation</b> or lifestyle choices.
