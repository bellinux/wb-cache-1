40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{recycling as}} an economic activity, locating it in debates about economization, marketization and performativity. It argues that recycling is a reflexive intervention in economic activity which extends the boundaries of markets, by internalizing objects formerly externalized as wastes and by attending to the temporal properties of materials. It differentiates between activities based on manufacturing recycled products and the activities of materials recovery linked to commodity markets in secondary materials. By taking the in vivo economic experiment resulting from the UK's Ship Recycling Strategy as its empirical focus, the paper demonstrates how recycling connects to wider debates about experimentation and the constitution of markets, and shows the importance of <b>assaying</b> and <b>assay</b> <b>devices</b> as market devices to the economization of recycling. It further shows that, in materials recovery, measurement is estimation and things are hard to pacify. This makes recycling difficult to stabilize {{as an economic}} activity.

40|$|Field-amplified sample {{stacking}} (FASS) uses conductivity gradients {{and resulting}} non-uniform electromigration fluxes to effect concentration increases of analyte ions. For {{cases where the}} initial sample concentration is {{much smaller than the}} background electrolyte (BGE) concentration, the ideal maximum concentration enhancement is equal to γ, the ratio of conductivity of the sample solution to that of the BGE. However, in practice both molecular diffusion and convective dispersion limit concen-tration enhancement. We present a theoretical and experimental study of concentra-tion enhancement using FASS. We model the FASS process as electromigration, diffusion, and advection of two background electrolyte ions and multiple sample species across a known initial concentration gradient. Regular perturbation methods and a generalized Taylor dispersion analysis are used to derive area-averaged species conservation and electric field equations. The model predicts the spatial and temporal development of background electrolyte concentration field, electric field, and sample-ion distribution of the FASS process. We have validated this model using on-chip FASS experiments.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{several aspects}} {{of the development of}} point-of-care, blood coagulation monitoring assay devices including, the design and modification of the underlying substrate platform, development and optimisation of the active assay reagent formulations required for particular assays, the investigation of novel coagulation detection approaches, and analysis of resulting clinical data to establish the usefulness of such assays in point-of-care diagnostic applications. The work resulted in the demonstration of two types of point-of-care coagulation assays; one for measuring fibrinogen levels and the other for the performance of clotting time tests such as an activated partial thromboplastin time. Chapter 1 is an introductory chapter describing the normal process of haemostasis and mechanisms of thrombosis. Various classes of anticoagulant drugs and mechanisms by which they exert their activity were explained. A number of substances used to induce clotting and their application in coagulation monitoring assay devices were discussed, as were issues relating to substrate materials and their surface modification for the purposes of <b>assay</b> <b>device</b> development. Chapter 2 outlines the materials and methods used in this study. Chapter 3 investigates the use of a novel micropatterned polymer substrate material for the development of coagulation assays and the modifications these required to make this feasible. It provides an in-depth characterisation of the modification of the micro-patterned substrate with various surface layers such as oxygen plasma treatment, poly (acrylic acid), polyelectrolyte, SiOx and dextran to produce surfaces which were hydrophilic and biocompatible with blood. A broad range of modified surfaces were investigated and documented. A detailed physical and biological characterisation was performed of the best performing surface. Chapter 4 demonstrates the development of a lateral flow clotting <b>assay</b> <b>device</b> based on the platform investigated in Chapter 3. A fibrinogen content <b>assay</b> <b>device</b> was successfully developed based on the established principle. This rapid, simple and reliable device was shown to be a viable assay for point-of-care determination of clinically relevant concentrations of fibrinogen. The device was capable of measuring plasma and whole blood fibrinogen. Assay precision and accuracy were evaluated by correlating against the “gold standard” hospital method and the assay was validated with patient samples. Chapter 5 focuses on the characterisation of a range of commercially available aPTT reagents and their performance in dried format to assess their suitability for incorporation into the aPTT assay developed in the subsequent chapter (Chapter 6). A comparison of ten reagents in terms of their ability to rapidly and reliably activate coagulation was performed. Their response to heparin dosage was also comprehensively investigated. Chapter 6 describes the development of an assay for the accurate determination of clotting times and their modification by anticoagulant drugs. This device was again based on the platform studied in Chapter 3 and the reagents screened in Chapter 5. The assay was based on the detection of clot formation in a lateral flow device by using a fluorescently-labelled fibrinogen reagent. The overall outcome was a reproducible, single-step, fluorescence-based assay capable of a wide heparin dosage range assessment, 0 – 2 U/mL in both plasma and whole blood samples. The assay was validated using both heparin-spiked control plasma and samples from patients subject to anticoagulant therapy. The results correlated well with two independent methods routinely used in hospital practice for aPTT determination. Chapter 7 briefly summarises the overall conclusions of the thesis and suggests further potential work relating to these assay devices. ...|$|E

40|$|Cell {{migration}} {{plays an}} important role in many physiological and pathological processes such as morphogenesis, wound healing, and tumor metastasis. Although the majority of such events occur with cells moving as a group, called collective cell migration, mechanics of collective cell migrations has not been understood well compared to a single cell migration. Mechanical interactions between cells and their surroundings have been demonstrated to regulate cell migration. One of such interactions is the induction of traction forces by acto-myosin dynamics within cells to their local environment, as it has been reported that cells alter the magnitude of traction forces depending on the stiffness of attaching substrates. In connection with cell migration, it has also been demonstrated the importance of substrate stiffness during cell migration using microfabricated substrates consisting of arrays of micropillars. To understand the mechanics of collective cell migration, it is important to know how cells within a moving cell collectivity generate forces to move the collectivity forward at single cell level.

40|$|As a {{significant}} industrial pollutant, cadmium is implicated {{as the cause}} of itai-itai disease. For biological detection of cadmium toxicity, an <b>assay</b> <b>device</b> has been developed using the motile response of the protozoa species, Tetrahymena pyriformis. This mobile protozoa measures 50 microns in diameter, swims at 10 body lengths per second, and aggregates into macroscopically visible patterns at high organism concentrations. The assay demonstrates a Cd(+ 2) sensitivity better than 1 micro-M and a toxicity threshold to 5 micro-M, thus encouraging the study of these microbial cultures as viable pollution detectors. Using two-dimensional diffraction patterns within a Tetrahymena culture, the scattered light intensity varies with different organism densities (population counts). The resulting density profile correlates strongly with the toxic effects at very low dosages for cadmium (less than 5 ppm) and then for poison protection directly (with nickel and copper antagonists competing with cadmium absorption). In particular, copper dosages as low as 0. 1 - 0. 5 mM Cu have shown protective antagonism against cadmium, have enhanced density variability for cultures containing 1 mM Cd(+ 2) and therefore have demonstrated the sensitivity of the optical detection system. In this way, such microbial diffraction patterns give a responsive optical measure of biological culture changes and toxicity determination in aqueous samples of heavy metals and industrial pollutants...|$|E

Results: There was a significant positive correlation between the eosinophil counts in nasal polyp and eotaxin levels in the nasal polyp extracts. Using EZ-TAXIScan, eosinophil chemotactic responses were observed following stimulation with nasal polyp extracts. There was a significant positive correlation between the chemotactic index toward the nasal polyp extracts and their eotaxin levels. Nasal polyp extract-induced chemotaxis was completely inhibited by CCR 3 antagonist but not by chemoattractant receptor-homologous molecule expressed on Th 2 cells (CRTH 2) antagonist which inhibited PGD 2 -induced eosinophil chemotaxis. Conclusions: The CCR 3 pathway may play an important role in the pathogenesis of eosinophil recruitment in nasal polyps through selective eosinophil chemotaxis...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDroplet {{microfluidics}} is {{an emerging}} area in miniaturisation {{of chemical and}} biological <b>assays,</b> or "lab-on-a-chip" <b>devices.</b> Normally consisting of droplets flowing in rigid microfluidic channels they offer many advantages over conventional microfluidic design but lack any form of active control over the droplets. We present work, using holographic beam shaping, that allows the real time reconfigurability of microfluidic channels allowing us to redirect, slow, stop, and merge droplets with diameters of approximately 200 microns. A single beam is be sufficient to perform simple tasks on the droplets but by using holographic beam shaping we can produce multiple foci or continuous patterns of light that enable a far more versatile tool...|$|R
40|$|Biology and {{chemistry}} laboratories in many universities regularly perform absorbance assays. However, current procedures for these assays are expensive and inefficient, as plates and cuvettes are costly and non-reusable. Paper microfluidic technology involves {{the creation of}} reaction chambers via the printing and subsequent heating of wax on paper to form hydrophobic walls with a hydrophilic matrix. Templates are designed digitally, which allows for ease of adjustment {{and the creation of}} devices en masse and tailored to specific reactions. We have developed a paper-based 96 -well “plate” using a wax printer and are working to prove its functionality through investigation of the Bradford <b>assay.</b> These <b>devices</b> are viable for upwards of two hours, depending upon the volume of solvent used. They require a tenth of the reagent quantities needed in conventional protocols and may be analyzed using standard transmission-based microplate readers. Preliminary results using this technique have yielded observable color gradients with distinctly linear trends. Once the Bradford protocol is optimized, we will examine image-based alternatives for analysis. We also hope to explore the creation of devices for rapid, field-ready qualitative analyses of impurities found in food and water sources...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Budesonide has a {{long history}} as {{intranasal}} drug, with many marketed products. Efforts should be made to demonstrate the therapeutic equivalence and safety comparability between them. Given that systemic availability significantly varies from formulations, the clinical comparability of diverse products comes to be of clinical interest and a regulatory requirement. The aim {{of the present study was}} to compare the systemic availability, pharmacodynamic effect, and safety of two intranasal budesonide formulations for the treatment of rhinitis. Methods Eighteen healthy volunteers participated in this randomised, controlled, crossover, clinical trial. On two separated days, subjects received a single dose of 512 μg budesonide (4 puffs per nostril) from each of the <b>assayed</b> <b>devices</b> (Budesonida nasal 64 ®, Aldo-Union, Spain and Rhinocort 64 ®, AstraZeneca, Spain). Budesonide availability was determined by the measurement of budesonide plasma concentration. The pharmacodynamic effect on the hypothalamic-adrenal axis was evaluated as both plasma and urine cortisol levels. Adverse events were tabulated and described. Budesonide availability between formulations was compared by the calculation of 90 %CI intervals of the ratios of the main pharmacokinetic parameters describing budesonide bioavailability. Plasma cortisol concentration-time curves were compared by means of a GLM for Repeated Measures. Urine cortisol excretion between formulations was compared through the Wilcoxon's test. Results All the enroled volunteers successfully completed the study. Pharmacokinetic parameters were comparable in terms of AUC t (2. 6 ± 1. 5 vs 2. 2 ± 0. 7), AUC i (2. 9 ± 1. 5 vs 2. 4 ± 0. 7), t max (0. 4 ± 0. 1 vs 0. 4 ± 0. 2), C max /AUC i (0. 3 ± 0. 1 vs 0. 3 ± 0. 0), and MRT (5. 0 ± 1. 4 vs 4. 5 ± 0. 6), but not in the case of C max (0. 9 ± 0. 3 vs 0. 7 ± 0. 2) and t 1 / 2 (3. 7 ± 1. 8 vs 2. 9 ± 0. 4). The pharmacodynamic effects, measured as the effect over plasma and urine cortisol, were also comparables between both formulations. No severe adverse events were reported and tolerance was comparable between formulations. Conclusion The systemic availability of intranasal budesonide was comparable for both formulations in terms of most pharmacokinetic parameters. The pharmacodynamic effect on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis was also similar. Side effects were scarce and equivalent between the two products. This methodology to compare different budesonide-containing devices is reliable and easy to perform, and should be recommended for similar products intented to be marketed or already on the market.
