40|$|ABSTRACT. Narrow {{groove welding}} is an {{important}} technique for increasing pro-ductivity {{in the manufacture of}} thick-walled components. The nature of the process demands an automated approach and precise control to ensure consistently high weld quality. The most important ob-jective of narrow groove welding is to maintain uniform and sufficient penetra-tion at both groove faces. Several different approaches, such as wire bending tech-nique and wire rotating method, have been adopted in an attempt to minimize the incomplete fusion in the narrow groove GMAW process. In this study, a welding system using electromagnetic arc oscillation was developed for narrow groove welding. The electromagnet for applying a magnetic field to the welding arc was designed from the electromag-netic analysis results. This paper shows the arc and bead characteristics in narrow groove GMAW using electromagnetic arc oscillation. Based on the results, the ap-propriate welding and oscillation condi-tions were selected to satisfy high weld quality. Consequently, magnetic arc oscil-lation resulted in uniform and sufficient penetration to both groove faces. Arc sig-nal characteristics for <b>automatic</b> <b>joint</b> tracking were also investigated. The peri-odic change of welding current in electro-magnetic arc oscillation was examined by experiments and numerical analysis. To establish the mathematical model of the arc sensor, some assumptions were needed to calculate the arc length. Ana-lytical results using these assumptions showed good agreement with experimen-tal ones. The periodic signal was adopted to develop an <b>automatic</b> <b>joint</b> tracking sys-tem in narrow groove GMAW...|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{approach}} for the efficient <b>automatic</b> <b>joint</b> detection and localization of single-channel acoustic events us-ing random forest regression. The audio signals are decom-posed into multiple densely overlapping superframes annotated with event class labels and their displacements to the temporal starting and ending {{points of the}} events. Using the displacement information, a multivariate random forest regression model is learned for each event category to map each superframe to con-tinuous estimates of onset and offset locations of the events. In addition, two classifiers are trained using random forest clas-sification to classify superframes of background and different event categories. On testing, based on the detection of category-specific superframes using the classifiers, the learned regressor provides the estimates of onset and offset locations in time of the corresponding event. While posing event detection and lo-calization as a regression problem is novel, the quantitative eval-uation on ITC-Irst database of highly variable acoustic events shows the efficiency and potential of the proposed approach.

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} improve the {{automatic}} probabilistic classification of joint motion gait patterns in children with cerebral palsy by using the expert knowledge available via a recently developed Delphi-consensus study. To this end, this study applied both Naïve Bayes and Logistic Regression classification {{with varying degrees of}} usage of the expert knowledge (expert-defined and discretized features). A database of 356 patients and 1719 gait trials was used to validate the classification performance of eleven joint motions. Two main hypotheses stated that: (1) Joint motion patterns in children with CP, obtained through a Delphi-consensus study, can be automatically classified following a probabilistic approach, with an accuracy similar to clinical expert classification, and (2) The inclusion of clinical expert knowledge in the selection of relevant gait features and the discretization of continuous features increases the performance of <b>automatic</b> probabilistic <b>joint</b> motion classification. This study provided objective evidence supporting the first hypothesis. Automatic probabilistic gait classification using the expert knowledge available from the Delphi-consensus study resulted in accuracy (91 %) similar to that obtained with two expert raters (90 %), and higher accuracy than that obtained with non-expert raters (78 %). Regarding the second hypothesis, this study demonstrated that the use of more advanced machine learning techniques such as automatic feature selection and discretization instead of expert-defined and discretized features can result in slightly higher joint motion classification performance. However, the increase in performance is limited and does not outweigh the additional computational cost and the higher risk of loss of clinical interpretability, which threatens the clinical acceptance and applicability...|$|R

40|$|Inspection of {{solder joints}} {{has been a}} {{critical}} process in the electronic manufacturing industry to reduce manufacturing cost, improve yield, and ensure product quality and reliability. The solder joint inspection problem is more challenging than many other visual inspections because of the variability in the appearance of solder joints. Although many research works and various techniques {{have been developed to}} classify defect in solder joints, these methods have complex systems of illumination for image acquisition and complicated classification algorithms. An important stage of the analysis is to select the right method for the classification. Better inspection technologies are needed to fill the gap between available inspection capabilities and industry systems. This dissertation aims to provide a solution that can overcome some of the limitations of current inspection techniques. This research proposes two inspection steps for <b>automatic</b> solder <b>joint</b> classification system. The “front-end” inspection system includes illumination normalisation, localization and segmentation. The illumination normalisation approach can effectively and efficiently eliminate the effect of uneven illumination while keeping the properties of the processed image. The “back-end” inspection involves the classification of solder joints by using Log Gabor filter and classifier fusion. Five different levels of solder quality with respect to the amount of solder paste have been defined. Log Gabor filter has been demonstrated to achieve high recognition rates and is resistant to misalignment. Further testing demonstrates the advantage of Log Gabor filter over both Discrete Wavelet Transform and Discrete Cosine Transform. Classifier score fusion is analysed for improving recognition rate. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system improves performance and robustness in terms of classification rates. This proposed system does not need any special illumination system, and the images are acquired by an ordinary digital camera. In fact, the choice of suitable features allows one to overcome the problem given by the use of non complex illumination systems. The new system proposed in this research can be incorporated in the development of an automated non-contact, non-destructive and low cost solder joint quality inspection system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} non-cooperative aircraft identification that uses non-linear filtering to fuse target kinematic state measurements and target signature measurements. This is applicable to sensors whose signature measurements {{are sensitive to the}} sensor-target orientation such as high range resolution radar, synthetic aperture radar, ladar and electo-optical imagers. Fusion is achieved by constructing the joint density for the target’s kinematic state and its class, conditioned on the data. The marginal density for the target class is obtained by integrating out the kinematic variables in this joint density, enabling target recognition. This process is inherently non-Gaussian due to non-linear target dynamics and the presence of multiple modes in the signature densities. To model these non-linearities the time evolution of the joint density between measurements is determined by solving the Fokker-Planck equation using the Alternating Direction Implicit method, a fast finite difference partial differential equation solver. As measurements become available, they are used to update the joint kinematic/class density using Bayes rule and densities derived from physical sensor models. This preserves the non-Gaussian features of the joint density including feedback between aspect, kinematics and class. In a test problem fusing simulated position measurements with high range resolution radar signatures this reduces time-to-classify compared with a Maximum Likelihood Classifier that does not use the position measurements.

40|$|We {{implement}} a space-time grid adaptation procedure to efficiently improve {{the accuracy of}} numerical simulations of solute transport in porous media {{in the context of}} model parameter estimation. We focus on the Advection Dispersion Equation (ADE) for the interpretation of non-reactive transport experiments in laboratory-scale heterogeneous porous media. When compared to a numerical approximation based on a fixed space-time discretization, our approach is grounded on a <b>joint</b> <b>automatic</b> selection of the spatial grid and the time step to capture the main (space-time) system dynamics. Spatial mesh adaptation is driven by an anisotropic recovery-based error estimator which enables us to properly select the size, shape and orientation of the mesh elements. Adaptation of the time step is performed through an ad-hoc local reconstruction of the temporal derivative of the solution via a recovery-based approach. The impact of the proposed adaptation strategy on the ability to provide reliable estimates of the key parameters of an ADE model is assessed on the basis of experimental solute breakthrough data measured following tracer injection in a non-uniform porous system. Model calibration is performed in a Maximum Likelihood (ML) framework upon relying on the representation of the ADE solution through a generalized Polynomial Chaos Expansion (gPCE). Our results show that the proposed anisotropic space-time grid adaptation leads to ML parameter estimates and to model results of markedly improved quality when compared to classical inversion approaches based on a uniform space-time discretization...|$|R

We propose a method for <b>automatic</b> measurement of <b>joint</b> alignment from pre-operative as well as post-operative radiographs. Methods: In a two step approach we first detect and segment any implants or other artificial objects within the image. We exploit physical characteristics and avoid prior shape information {{to cope with the}} vast amount of implant types. Subsequently, we exploit the implantdelineations to adapt the initialization and adaptation phase of adedicated bone segmentation scheme using deformable template models. Implant and bone contours are fused to derive the final joint segmentation and thus the alignment measurements. Results: We evaluatedour method on clinical long leg radiographs and compared both the initialization rate, corresponding to the number of images successfully processed by the proposed algorithm, and the accuracy of the alignment measurement. Ground truth has been generated by an experiencedorthopedic surgeon. For comparison a second reader reevaluated the measurements.
