5000|$|Random {{screening}} at the US National Cancer Institute of a {{vast number}} of compounds provided by the Allied Chemical Company led to the discovery of <b>ametantrone</b> as having significant anti-tumor activity. Further investigation regarding the rational development of analogs of <b>ametantrone</b> led to the synthesis of mitoxantrone, which also exhibited marked anti-tumor activity Mitoxantrone was considered as an analog of doxorubicin with less structural complexity but with a similar mode of action. In clinical studies, mitoxantrone was shown to be effective against numerous types of tumors with less toxic side effects than those resulting from doxorubicin therapy. However, mitoxantrone was not totally free of cardiotoxicity. A number of structurally modified analogs of mitoxantrone were synthesized and structure-activity relationship studies made. [...] BBR 2778 was originally synthesized by University of Vermont researchers Miles P. Hacker and Paul A. Krapcho and initially characterized in vitro for tumor cell cytotoxicity and mechanism of action by studies at the Boehringer Mannheim Italia Research Center, Monza, and University of Vermont, Burlington. Other studies have been completed at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, the Istituto Nazionale Tumori, Milan, and the University of Padua. In the search for novel heteroanalogs of anthracenediones, it was selected as the most promising compound. Toxicological studies indicated that BBR 2778 was not cardiotoxic, and US patents are held by the University of Vermont. An additional US patent application was completed in June 1995 by Boehringer Mannheim, Italy.|$|E

For the 3 drugs, an exponential relationship between colony survival and drug concentration was found, but was much steeper for mitoxantrone (slope = - 195. 2 +/- 8. 8 /micrograms/ml) than for <b>ametantrone</b> (slope = 5. 1 +/- 1. 0 /micrograms/ml, p {{less than or equal to}} 0. 001) and bisantrene (slope = 7. 1 +/- 0. 3 /micrograms/ml, p less than or equal to 0. 001). The difference of slope between <b>ametantrone</b> and bisantrene was of borderline significance (p less than or equal to 0. 05). The ratios of concentrations inducing a 50 % growth inhibition for mitoxantrone versus bisantrene and for <b>ametantrone</b> versus bisantrene were close to the corresponding ratios of concentrations inducing a 90 % growth inhibition. The relative in vitro toxicities reproduce very well the relative myelosuppression observed in clinical trials with mitoxantrone versus bisantrene but the results were less satisfactory for the comparison of these 2 agents with <b>ametantrone.</b> In addition, our data suggest that, for these 3 compounds, intrinsic myeloid progenitor sensitivity is a major determinant of leukopenia.

40|$|Mitoxantrone, a DNA intercalator, is an {{effective}} antitumor drug known to interfere with topoisomerase II function through stimulation of enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage. To clarify the drug structural requirements for stimulation of topoisomerase II DNA cleavage, the cytotoxic activity and molecular effects of mitoxantrone, <b>ametantrone,</b> and a new derivative (BBR 2577), bearing a modification {{on one of the}} side chains, were examined in relation to their DNA binding affinities and modes of drug-DNA interaction. The results showed a good correlation between cytotoxicity and topoisomerase II DNA cleavage. The modification of one side chain did not influence the cytotoxic potency or the ability of the drug to stimulate DNA cleavage. In contrast, removal of the hydroxyl substituents in the planar aromatic moiety (<b>ametantrone)</b> markedly affected the efficacy of the drug. <b>Ametantrone</b> showed a markedly lower capacity, compared with the other two compounds, to induce cleavable complexes both in intact cells and in SV 4 O DNA, which suggests a critical role of these substituents {{in the formation of the}} ternary topoisomerase Il-DNA-drug complex. The poor efficacy of <b>ametantrone</b> is likely due to low stability of the ternary complex. This is possibly related to a different orientation of the drug chromophore intercalated into DNA, compared with those of mitoxantrone and BBR 2577.

Several compounds showed marked antiproliferative potency against doxorubicin-selected, P-glycoprotein-expressing tumor cells and p 53 (-/-) cells. The cytotoxicity of some novel compounds for P-glycoprotein-positive cells is highly dependent on N-substituent at the terminal amino group of ethylenediamine moiety.

40|$|In {{the present}} study we {{examined}} the ultrastructural modifications {{as well as the}} precise distribution of DNA and RNA in RT 4 cell nucleoli following a 3 -h exposure to nontoxic or toxic doses of <b>ametantrone</b> (AMT), poly(adenylate-uridylate) (polyr(A-U), or an AMT/polyr(A-U) combination. While distribution of nucleic acids within the various nucleolar components is not modified following all treatments, the nucleoli exhibit several ultrastructural changes: redistribution of the nucleolar components, {{decrease in the number of}} fibrillar centers, and increase in the size of the fibrillar centers. The relative frequencies of the test agents to induce the apparition of nucleoli of compact type are AMT/polyr(A-U) > AMT approximately polyr(A-U) > sham-treated, while the abilities of the test agents to induce the nucleolar segregation are AMT/polyr(A-U) approximately AMT > polyr(A-U) > sham-treated cells.

40|$|A {{high-performance}} liquid chromatographic (HPLC) {{method was}} developed for the specific determination of mitoxantrone (MTO) in whole blood and different tissues of mice (liver, heart, spleen, kidneys). MTO was extracted into dichloromethane with <b>ametantrone</b> (AMT) as internal standard. The different tissues were homogenised in citrate buffer (pH 3. 0) containing 20 % ascorbic acid. Separation of MTO and AMT was carried out using a Nucleosil C 18 column. The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile (33 %) and 0. 16 M ammonium formate buffer, pH 2. 7. UV detection was used at 658 nm. Baseline separation of AMT and MTO was achieved in all matrices. The calibration curves were linear in all matrices (r > 0. 999) in the concentration range of 2 - 200 micrograms/l for whole blood and 2 - 700 micrograms/l for tissue homogenates, respectively. The within-day and between-day precision studies showed good reproducibility with coefficients of variation below 4. 5 % for whole blood and below 10 % for tissue homogenates, respectively.

40|$|The nuclear {{chromatin}} binding {{sites of}} the antitumor drugs mitoxantrone, <b>ametantrone,</b> doxorubicin, mithramycin, and actinomycin D and the intercalating ligand ethidium were studied by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the proteins released from rat liver nuclei in the presence and absence of these drugs in buffer of low ionic strength (10 mM NaCl). At 25 - 50 microM free ligand concentration, each drug produced a specific and reproducible pattern of extractable proteins of different molecular weight by (i) releasing new proteins, (ii) altering the quantity of particular extracted proteins, and/or (iii) selectively entrapping other proteins in the nuclei. Ethidium, up to 100 microM, did not affect release of proteins from the nuclei. These results indicate that each ligand either has different binding site(s) in chromatin or modulates chromatin structure in a specific way by changing the affinity of different sets of proteins for their respective binding sites, resulting in their selective extraction or entrapment. The lack of effect of ethidium indicates that intercalation of the ligand to DNA, per se, does not alter the release of nuclear proteins. If patterns of nuclear proteins selectively released or retained by antitumor drugs are found to correlate with biological activity, this type of analysis may be helpful in new drug design and screening...|$|E
40|$|The physicochemical, {{cytotoxic}} and {{pharmacological properties}} of 2, 3 -diaza-anthracenedione derivatives were examined to {{gain insight into}} the structure-activity relationships in this class of compounds. Spectrophotometric, chiroptical and voltammetric measurements were performed, along with cell cytotoxicity, alkaline elution, topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage and cellular drug-uptake determinations. In comparison with classic anthracenediones such as mitoxantrone and <b>ametantrone,</b> the aza derivatives were characterized by less negative reduction potentials, lower affinity for DNA and modified geometry of intercalation. The biological effects of the new compounds were also profoundly affected by bioisosteric N for C replacement. Stimulation of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage was not observed, whereas other mechanisms of cell cytotoxicity, possibly involving oxidative DNA damage, appeared to be operative. The inability to generate protein-associated strand breaks {{could be explained by}} an unfavorable orientation of the drug in the intercalation complex rather than by a reduced binding to DNA. Geometry of drug intercalation may have a critical influence on the formation of the ternary complex. In turn, the onset of a different DNA-damaging pathway is likely to be related to easy redox cycling of the 2, 3 -diaza-substituted anthracenedione derivatives, which could produce radical species to a remarkably greater extent than could the carbocyclic parent drugs...|$|E
40|$|<b>Ametantrone</b> (HAQ) and {{mitoxantrone}} (DHAQ) are structurally similar antitumor drugs of the anthracenedione class. The cytostatic, cytotoxic, and antitumor {{activities of}} these drugs are different, with DHAQ being 10 - 100 times more potent, per molar basis. Both drugs are strong intercalators and intercalative modes of binding are suspected as relevant to their pharmacological activity. No significant differences, however, that could explain the differences in pharmacological activity are observed in their intercalative properties with respect to base specificity and binding affinity. A correlation, however, is evident between their potency and ability to condense nucleic acids inasmuch as DHAQ condenses nucleic acids at concentrations that are lower {{by a factor of}} 5 - 40 than those of HAQ and these effects can be observed at their pharmacological concentrations. The condensation is base- and sugar-specific and the long purine sequences of single-stranded RNA are the most sensitive. Electron microscopy of L 1210 cells exposed a short time (90 min) to 0. 21 - 21 microM DHAQ reveals segregation of nucleoli; the segregated granular portion shows increased electron opacity.

While the main nucleolar components (fibrillar center (F), dense fibrillar component (D), granular component (G) and interstices (I) can be discerned following all treatments, the nucleoli exhibit: compaction, segregation, a decrease in the number of F, an increase in the size of remaining F, margination of intranucleolar chromatin and retention of intranucleolar pre-rRNA and rRNA. The relative abilities of the test agents to induce nucleolar compaction are AMT/poly r(A-U) > poly r(A-U) > AMT > sham-treated, while the abilities of the test agents to induce the remaining nucleolar changes are AMT/poly r(A-U) > or = AMT > poly r(A-U) > sham-treated cells. Poly r(A-U) and the induced interferon induce nucleolar compaction, while AMT produces nucleolar segregation.

40|$|Natural and {{synthetic}} compounds {{characterized by an}} anthraquinone nucleus represent an important class of anti-neoplastic agents, the mechanism of action of which is related to intercalation into DNA. <b>Ametantrone</b> (AM) is a synthetic 9, 10 -anthracenedione bearing two (hydroxyethylamino) ethylamino residues at positions 1 and 4; along with other anthraquinones and anthracyclines, it shares a polycyclic intercalating moiety and charged side chains that stabilize DNA binding. All these drugs elicit adverse side effects, which represent a challenge for antitumor chemotherapy. In the present work the structure of AM was augmented with appropriate groups that target well-defined base pairs in the major groove. These should endow AM with DNA sequence selectivity. We describe {{the rationale for the}} synthesis and the evaluation of activity of a new series of compounds in which the planar anthraquinone is conjugated at positions 1 and 4 through the side chains of AM or other bioisosteric linkers to appropriate dipeptides. The designed novel AM derivatives were shown to selectively stabilize two oligonucleotide duplexes that both have a palindromic GC-rich hexanucleotide core, but their stabilizing effects on a random DNA sequence was negligible. In the case of the most effective compound, the 1, 4 -bis-[Gly-(L-Lys) ] derivative of AM, the experimental results confirm the predictions of earlier theoretical computations. In contrast, AM had equal stabilizing effects on all three sequences and showed no preferential binding. This novel peptide derivative can be classified as a strong binder regarding the sequences that it selectively targets, possibly opening the exploitation of less cytotoxic conjugates of AM to the targeted treatment of oncological and viral diseases...|$|E
40|$|The {{cytotoxic}} {{activity of}} mitoxantrone and related anthracenediones has been {{ascribed to the}} ability of these cornpounds to interfere with DNA topoisomerase II function, resulting in DNA cleavage stimulation. The molecular details of enzyme inhibition by these intercalating agents remain to be defined. In an attempt to identify the structural determinants for optimal activity, the molecular and cellular effects of a series of heteroanalogues bearing different side-chains were examined in relation to the physico-chemical and DNA binding properties of these compounds. The results indicated that substitution of a pyridine ring for the dihydroxyphenylene ring in the planar chromophore caused a marked reduction of cytotoxic activity and of the ability to stimulate topoisomerase Il-mediated DNA damage in intact cells and with simian virus 40 DNA in vitro. Although all tested derivatives were shown to intercalate into DNA, their DNA binding affinities were appreciably lower than that of mitoxantrone. The behavior of 2 -aza derivatives more closely resembled that of <b>ametantrone,</b> suggesting that the potency of agents of this class is influenced more by the presence of hydroxyl groups than by the phenylene ring. The observation that a dramatic reduction (or loss) of the ability of aza derivatives to stimulate DNA cleavage is associated with a marked reduction of cytotoxic potency supports a primary role of topoisomerase Il-mediated effects in the mechanism of action of the effective agents of this class. Because appreciable cytotoxic activity and significant in vivo antitumor efficacy are retained by compounds inactive (or poorly active) in inhibition of topoisomerase II, these results are consistent with multiple effects of anthracenediones at the cellular level...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} a range of {{complexing}} agents on the radiation damage routes in frozen aqueous DNA have been analyzed by ESR techniques in a semi-quantitative way. Establishment of additive-free DNA standards for this study revealed an ESR pattern different from the four elementary shapes which contributed ∼ 13 X of the total spin seen after annealing to 210 K. It is proposed that this represents a population of sugar radicals; hitherto unseen intermediates in additive-free systems between secondary base radicals and strand breaks. The intercalating aminoanthraquinones, mitoxantrone and <b>ametantrone,</b> were found to compete very efficiently with thymine for electron capture, and behaved as protecting agents. Concomitant strand break studies did not support this, and more extensive ESR studies suggested that the intercalator radical centre could also lead to strand breaks. It is therefore proposed that the mode of action of these drugs does not involve free radical processes in DNA. Use of these agents provided evidence that electron migra tion in DNA is much more extensive than previously thought. Copper ions were found to reduce the amounts of T/TH detected, with no effect on G. During this evaluation, evidence appeared for the existence of a site on DNA that could bind two Cu(II) ions so close together that they became ESR silent. Of special interest was the finding that this binding was preferred over that of single Cu(II) ions, and it is proposed that this might have a physiological significance. The dominance of thymine over cytosine as the site of electron capture is reinforced by the above studies, but it is suggested that it {{is the nature of the}} system under study that determines the ratio of T to C...|$|E
40|$|Mitoxantrone is a {{dihydroxyanthracenedione}} derivative {{with significant}} clinical activity against advanced breast cancer, lymphoma and {{several types of}} leukaemia. However, as with all conventional anticancer agents, its non-specific nature results in dose-limiting systemic toxicity. The pharmacological (and toxicological) effects of mitoxantrone {{are thought to be}} mediated through its interaction with DNA and the DNA processing enzyme, topoisomerase II. Hence, an investigation of the DNA binding properties of mitoxantrone and related bis-substituted alkylaminoanthraquinones was undertaken with a view to developing agents with reduced toxicity to normal cells. DNA intercalation was evaluated using spectrophotometric and DNA thermal denaturation (Tm) techniques with calf thymus DNA. Overall, compounds that were hydroxylated at the 5 and 8 positions of the anthraquinone chromophore had increased DNA binding affinity compared to their non-hydroxylated analogues. The Tms of mitoxantrone and its non-hydroxylated analogue <b>ametantrone,</b> were 26. 4 °C and 21. 5 °C respectively. The affinity constants (K) for the chromophore-hydroxylated compounds were between 3. 94 and 4. 95 xl 06 M- 1 while K values for their non-hydroxylated analogues were between 1. 63 and 3. 25 xl 06 M-l. For the di-N-oxide, AQ 4 N, intercalation was not detectable. The mono-N-oxide, AQ 6 N, showed modest DNA binding activity, with a Tm of 7. 0 °C and an affinity constant of 3. 64 Xl 06 M-l. Several of the alkylaminoanthraquinones were further investigated for their ability to inhibit decatenation of kDNA by topoisomerase II. Mitoxantrone and its analogues, AQ 4 and AQ 6, inhibited decatenation at concentrations ofO. 75 IlM, 1. 51 lM and 1. 0 llM respectively. In contrast, total inhibition of decatenation by the N-oxides, AQ 4 N and AQ 6 N, required concentrations of 50 llM and 1 OIlM respectively. Hence modification of the terminal nitrogen on both alkylamino side chains to form a di-N-oxide resulted in a large decrease in DNA binding affinity and topoisomerase II inhibition. In view {{of the importance of the}} cationic alkyl amino side chains in intercalative binding and the enhanced ability of mitoxantrone to inhibit topoisomerase II, a series of acetalanthraquinones were synthesized. These compounds, referred to as YCG 7 (1 - substituted), YCG 8 (l, 4 -bis-substituted), and YCG 9 (l, 5 -bis-substituted), possessed dimethoxy groups in place of the alcohol groups of mitoxantrone, and were designed to be converted to their respective aldehydes, which should increase their cytotoxic activity due to their potential to form Schiffs bases with intracellular targets. The acetalanthraquinones were relatively poor DNA intercalators compared to the parent compound, <b>ametantrone.</b> The Tm values for YCG 7, YCG 8 and YCG 9 were 3. 6 °C, 14. 2 °C and 15. 7 °C respectively. The bathochromic shifts for the acetalanthraquinones in the presence of calf thymus DNA and 0. 5 M NaCl/ 0. 008 M Tris at a DNA:drug ratio of 10 : 1 were 1. 4 nm, 3. 5 nm and 3. 6 nm respectively for YCG 7, YCG 8 and YCG 9 (ametantrone= 12. 2 nm). Oxidative metabolism by NADPH-fortified mouse liver micro somes provided an effective route for the oxidation of acetalanthraquinones, producing two polar metabolites for YCG 7 and three polar metabolites for both YCG 8 and YCG 9. The metabolites ofYCG 7 and YCG 8 were considerably more cytotoxic against the V 79 Chinese hamster lung cell line than their respective acetalanthraquinones (4. 4 -fold for both compounds). YCG 9 was found to be relatively cytotoxic per se, possibly due to its different mode of DNA binding, involving 'straddling' of the DNA helix. The increase in cytotoxicity of the metabolized products compared with the acetalanthraquinones supports the concept t?at they were conv. e ed to their corresponding aldehydes. This leads the way to the deSIgn of acetal-contammg cytotoxic agents which can be selectively activated in tumours...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} new {{compounds}} containing a 9, 10 -anthracenedione moiety {{and one or}} two peptide chains at position 1 and/or 4 have been synthesized. The amino acid residues introduced are glycine (Gly), lysine (Lys), and tryptophan (Trp), the latter two in both the L- and Dconfigurations. The peptidyl anthraquinones maintain the ability of intercalating efficiently into DNA, even though the orientation within the base-pair pocket may change somewhat with reference to the parent drugs mitoxantrone (MX) and <b>ametantrone</b> (AM). The interaction constants of the mono-, di-, and triglycyl derivatives are well comparable to those found for AM but 5 - 10 times lower than the value reported for MX. On the other hand, the glycyl-lysyl compounds bind DNA to the same extent as (L-isomer) or even better than (D-isomer) MX. As for the parent drugs without peptidyl chains, the new compounds prefer alternating CG binding sites, although to different extents. The bis-Gly-Lys derivatives are the least sensitive to base composition, which may be due to extensive aspecific charged interactions with the polynucleotide backbone. As far as redox properties are concerned, all peptidyl anthraquinones show a reduction potential very close to that of AM and 60 - 80 mV less negative than that of MX; hence, they can produce free-radical-damaging species to an extent similar to the parent drugs. The biological activity has been tested in human tumor and murine leukemia cell lines. Most of the test anthraquinones exhibit cytotoxic properties close to those of AM and considerably lower than those of MX. Stimulation of topoisomerase-mediated DNA cleavage is moderately present in representatives of the glycylanthraquinone family, whereas inhibition of the background cleavage occurs when Lys is present in the peptide chain. For most of the test anthraquinones, the toxicity data are in line with the DNA affinity scale and the topoisomerase II stimulation activity. However, in the lysyl derivatives, for which lack of cytotoxicity cannot be related to poor binding to DNA, the steric and electronic properties of the side-chain substituent must impair an effective recognition of the cleavable complex...|$|E
40|$|The {{use of the}} anthracenedione {{mitoxantrone}} as an antitumor {{agent is}} steadily increasing. While the toxicities associated with its use are significantly less than those observed following treatment with the widely used doxorubicin, mitoxantrone cardiotoxicity is clearly a substantial clinical problem. Current information on the mechanism by which mitoxantrone causes toxicity in heart tissue is limited. Thus, the goal of these studies was to describe a model system in which mitoxantrone cardiotoxicity can be studied, and begin to describe the mechanism by which mitoxantrone exerts its cardiotoxic effect. These experiments have shown that cultured neonatal rat heart cells are an effective model system for studying mitoxantrone-induced cytotoxicity and biochemical changes in heart tissue. Cultured heart cells develop dose- and time-dependent toxicity following a short exposure to near-pharmacologically achievable drug concentrations. Furthermore, histologic changes characteristic of this drug are also observed at the light and electron microscopic level. Initial experiments aimed at defining mitoxantrone mechanism of action showed that mitoxantrone likely does not stimulate a significant production of active oxygen species, or have a specific effect on mitochondrial function. However, {{there is evidence to}} support the possibility that mitoxantrone can form a reactive intermediate in vitro. These studies have shown that covalent binding of mitoxantrone to proteins can occur under certain conditions. Mitoxantrone toxicity is lowered with the addition of ICRF- 187, a metal chelating agent. Protection is not due to inactivation of mitoxantrone, decreased mitoxantrone uptake, or a delayed increase in cytosolic calcium. Similar protection is observed against doxorubicin and the oxidized form of mitoxantrone, but not against the non-hydroxylated analog of mitoxantrone, <b>ametantrone.</b> Furthermore, in a cell-free system, mitoxantrone can form complexes with both copper (II) and iron (III). Mitoxantrone metal binding is reversible as ICRF- 187 as well as other chelators can remove the metals from these complexes. These data suggests that metal chelation is involved in the enhancement of mitoxantrone toxicity in vitro...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{results in}} our {{laboratory}} {{suggest that the}} (CG) 4 segments whether present in a right-handed or a left-handed conformation form distinctive junctions with adjacent random sequences. These junctions and their associated sequences have unique structural and thermodynamic properties that may be recognized by DNA-binding molecules. This study probes these sequences by using the following small ligands: actinomycin D, 1, 4 -bis(((di(aminoethyl) amino) ethyl) amino) anthracene- 9, 10 -dione, <b>ametantrone,</b> and tris(phenanthroline) ruthenium (II). These ligands may recognize the distinctive features associated to the (CG) 4 segment and its junctions and thus interact preferentially near these sequences. Restriction enzyme inhibition assays {{were used to determine}} whether or not binding interactions took place, and to approximate locations of these interactions. These binding studies are first carried out using two small synthetic oligomers BZ-III and BZ-IV. The (5 meCG) 4 segment present in BZ-III adopts the Z-conformation in the presence of 50 m M Co(NH 3) 63 +. In BZ-IV, the unmethylated (CG) 4 segment changes to a non-B conformation in the presence of 50 m M Co(NH 3) 63 +. BZ-IV, containing the (CG) 4 segment, was inserted into a clone plasmid then digested with the restriction enzyme Hinf I to produce a larger fragment that contains the (CG) 4 segment. The results obtained on the small oligomers and on the larger fragment for restriction enzyme Mbo I indicate that 1, 4 -bis(((di(aminoethyl) amino) ethyl) amino) anthracene- 9, 10 -dione binds more efficiently at or near the (CG) 4 segment. Restriction enzymes EcoRV, Sac I and Not I with cleavage sites upstream and downstream of the (CG) 4 insert were used to further localize binding interactions in the vicinity of the (CG) 4 insert. RNA polymerase activity was studied in a plasmid which contained the (CG) 4 insert downstream from the promoter sites of SP 6 and T 7 RNA polymerases. Activities of these two polymerases were studied in the presence of each one of the ligands used throughout the study. Only actinomycin D and spider, which bind at or near the (CG) 4 segment, alter the activities of SP 6 and T 7 RNA polymerases. Surprisingly, enhancement of polymerase activity was observed in the presence of very low concentrations of actinomycin D. These results suggest that the conformational features of (CG) segments may serve in regulatory functions of DNA. ...|$|E
