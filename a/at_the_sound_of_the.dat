25|$|<b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gun, the cyclists {{leave their}} {{starting}} blocks {{and attempt to}} gain position behind the pacer, a keirin bicyclist wearing purple with orange stripes. As the pace quickens, the pacer will usually depart the track with between one and two laps remaining, but the actual location where the pacer leaves varies with every race.|$|E
25|$|As in 1859 winners {{received}} a cash prize; in addition, {{the first three}} winners received olive wreaths and small branches of olive and laurel. There was a band playing an Olympic Hymn, specially composed for the occasion. The judges were professors of the University of Athens, {{and there was a}} herald for announcing the winners. King George I was awarding the prizes to the winners <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> music.|$|E

25|$|This done, the shepherds and shepherdesses made merry {{with these}} cakes and fine grapes, and sported {{themselves}} together <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pretty small pipe, scoffing and laughing at those vainglorious cake-bakers, who had that day {{met with a}} mischief for want of crossing themselves with a good hand in the morning. Nor did they forget to apply to Forgier's leg some fat chenin grapes, and so handsomely dressed it and bound it up that he was quickly cured.|$|E
25|$|After {{sitting out}} the next Pride to recuperate, Sakuraba found himself across the ring from Quinton Jackson, a former collegiate wrestler who had {{compiled}} a record of 10–1 on the American circuit. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bell, Sakuraba immediately took the bigger man to the canvas with a low single-leg takedown. However, Jackson's superior size and enormous physical strength allowed him to muscle out of Sakuraba's submission attempts. After locking his legs around Jackson for a triangle choke, Sakuraba found himself hefted {{into the air and}} repeatedly slammed to the canvas {{in the way of a}} powerbomb. Later, he attempted an armbar against Jackson, only for the Tennessee native to again lift him up and this time attempt to drop him from the ring. His expression unchanging through the course of Jackson's assault, Sakuraba continued to flow from one lock to another. Eventually, he took the back of an exhausted Jackson and submitted him with his first rear naked choke victory. The contest was a launchpad for Jackson's career, leading to a long-term contract with Pride where he eventually became regarded as a top middleweight competitor, and later, a UFC champion.|$|E
2500|$|The {{civilian}} {{driving the}} open wagon abandoned his vehicle as the gunfight began, fleeing to safety. Campbell's horse spooked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weapons {{and threw her}} before it ran back toward the stagecoach station. [...] The bandits called Campbell's name and fired a couple shots in her direction before turning their attention elsewhere. [...] Campbell then crawled behind a bush and some rocks located about [...] past the ambulance. [...] She observed {{the rest of the}} fight from this position.|$|E

2500|$|Columnist Bob Herbert wrote [...] "A {{grotesque}} {{exercise in}} the dehumanization of women is carried out routinely at Sheri's Ranch, a legal brothel about an hour’s ride outside of Vegas. There the women have to respond like Pavlov’s dog to an electronic bell that might ring at any {{hour of the day}} or night. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bell, the prostitutes have five minutes to get to an assembly area where they line up, virtually naked, and submit to a humiliating inspection by any prospective customer who has happened to drop by".|$|E
2500|$|Where {{the enemy}} fled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "First Wave", and stops were {{correctly}} placed by the operational commander, the operations were efficiently carried out. The difficult {{thing was to}} {{walk up to the}} enemy hiding in a house or cave or behind a boulder and kill or capture him. Many a troopie clawing through obstacles found himself very suddenly right by another armed man he was supposed to kill or capture. Though the event was shocking (and often results in one or more persons being killed), it is far more efficient than firing or dropping ordnance from air and overall reduces civilian casualties. The cooperation of the Rhodesian Air Force with Army operations was exceptional. [...] Even when patrolling, any unit of the Rhodesian Army could expect prompt G-car response in a crisis.|$|E
2500|$|Furthermore, purists {{were not}} {{fond of the}} way certain {{characters}} were portrayed in the pilot. For instance, Kitty Pryde was seen in their eyes as coming across as {{too much of a}} whiny damsel-in-distress (although this may have been intended to be the start of her character arc, eventually evolving into a stronger, more mature heroine). Fans also found it confusing to see the White Queen be portrayed {{as a member of the}} Brotherhood of Mutants. This Brotherhood was a mix of Magneto's group (with the inclusion of Toad) and Mystique's (with the inclusion of Pyro and the Blob) along with the previously unaffiliated Juggernaut and White Queen. Most importantly, fans were upset <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> traditionally Canadian Wolverine, speaking with an Australian accent. This casting error seemed to stem from a brief run-through of the script in which, mockingly, Wolverine calls the traditionally Australian character Pyro, a dingo. In the final version, however, Wolverine calls Toad a [...] "dingo" [...] rather than Pyro.|$|E

2500|$|Major Wham {{initially}} took shelter {{behind the}} ambulance. [...] The remaining draft animals panicked <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gunfire and dragged both wagons off {{the west side}} of the road, damaging their harnesses in the process. [...] This forced Wham to retreat behind a small rocky ledge on {{the west side of}} the road. [...] He was joined behind the outcropping by his clerk and most of the soldiers. [...] Wham directed the soldiers' fire while his clerk rendered aid to the wounded. [...] Both men, initially unarmed, later took rifles from wounded soldiers and joined in the fight. [...] Mays initially returned fire with his revolver from behind the escort wagon. [...] This position soon proved to be untenable and he joined Wham behind the rocky ledge. [...] While Wham and his men were pinned down there, the bandits maneuvered along the top of the ridge to get them into a crossfire. [...] About 30 minutes after the battle began, Mays, who had assumed command of the escort following the withdrawal of Sergeant Brown, informed Wham that their position was no longer defensible and that he was ordering his men to withdraw. [...] Wham initially objected to this choice but later admitted that Mays had made the correct military decision.|$|E
