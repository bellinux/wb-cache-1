40|$|The {{currently}} dominant {{method in}} the production of wafers is to use slurry wire-saw slicing. This paper reports a new wire-saw slicing technology, namely, semifixed abrasive wire-saw slicing. The traditional smooth wire is replaced by a patterned wire with a textured surface that can help the wire carrying the abrasives. It aims to improve the number of transient fixed abrasives in the machining process. Transient fixed abrasives can produce “scratch-indenting” processes that are similar to fixed-abrasive wire slicing thereby improving the efficiency of the wire-saw cutting. This study focuses on the behavioral mechanics of the <b>abrasive</b> <b>grits</b> in the slurry during the slicing process. The dynamic images of the movement of <b>abrasive</b> <b>grits</b> in the slicing process are obtained by a high-speed camera. At the microlevel, using statistical methods, the behavioral mechanics of the <b>abrasive</b> <b>grits</b> are investigated by changing the slicing parameters. The results contribute toward a more intuitive and profound understanding of the principle of free-abrasive wire sawing...|$|R

30|$|As shown from Fig.  4 a, both 60 # and 180 # <b>grit</b> size <b>abrasives</b> {{have good}} metal removal ability. 28  μm of metal was ground away {{by using a}} 60 # grit size abrasive; and 20  μm more in {{thickness}} was removed by adding one more step of the grinding process using the 180 # <b>grit</b> size <b>abrasive.</b> However, the 280 # and 400 # <b>grit</b> size <b>abrasives</b> have relatively lower metal removal ability, they are used for the surface finish process; only 8  μm in thickness of metal was ground away by using a 280 # <b>grit</b> size <b>abrasive</b> for 5  min plus another 5  min grinding by a 400 # <b>grit</b> size <b>abrasive.</b> The machine power also has a large influence on the metal removal behavior. As illustrated in Fig.  4 b, when using same <b>grit</b> size <b>abrasives</b> and same grinding procedures, a maximum metal removal rate was seen with the intermediate power (60 %). A lower machine power (30 %) gave 25  μm of metal removal compared to 48  μm at 60 %, at 90 % power the metal removal dropped to 34  μm. Higher machine power introduced higher grinding force. When grinding with a lower machine power (grinding force), the <b>abrasive</b> <b>grits</b> slide and rub over the material surface instead of effective cutting and ploughing. Using a higher machine power (grinding force) increased friction between the abrasive and the workpiece surface as well as wear of <b>abrasive</b> <b>grits.</b> Figure  4 c shows the significant improvement of metal removal ability by using grinding lubrication; the removed thickness was more than doubled (from 48  μm increased to 102  μm) by using lubricant. This {{can be explained by}} the fact that grinding lubrication can help reducing friction at the contact surfaces, diffusing away heat, retaining sharpness of the <b>abrasive</b> <b>grits,</b> thus induces a favorable metal removal mode (Manimaran et al. 2014; Fredj et al. 2006).|$|R

Surface defects (deep grooves, smearing, adhesive chips, and indentations), a highly deformed thin surface layer up {{to a few}} microns in thickness, and high surface tensile residual stresses parallel to the grinding direction have been observed as the main damage induced by the grinding operations. Surface finish and deformation {{were found to be}} improved by using smaller <b>abrasive</b> <b>grits</b> or by using lubrication during grinding. Increasing the machine power increased surface deformation while reducing surface defects.

5000|$|A well-chosen {{speed for}} stone {{polishing}} causes the rocks within the barrel to slide past each other, with the <b>abrasive</b> <b>grit</b> between them.

Typically, a full tumble polish from rough rock to polish takes between 3-5 weeks, and is done in a minimum of 3 steps. Initially, the rocks are smoothed with a coarse grit (such as 60-90 mesh). The idea behind {{the first step is to}} take rough rock or stone and grind it (tumble it) down into a form which is indistinguishable (in shape) from the final product. [...] This is followed by washing and then a stage of finer grits (120-220 then 400-600 mesh), before the (optional) use of a pre-polishing compound (1200 grit), a washing cycle with detergent to remove any grit on the stones. The final step is a polishing stage using powdered polish, (such as cerium oxide or tin oxide), water, and often small plastic pellets that are designed to cushion the stones as they tumble (so as not to cause chipping) and carry the polish evenly across the stones.|$|E

During grinding, only a small top region of the abrasive grits is efficient for metal removal, the remaining part is sliding and rubbing the workpiece material (Sin et al. 1979). The coarser grit size abrasives have bigger abrasive particles, causing larger areas of rubbing during grinding; meanwhile, the size and distribution of the <b>abrasive</b> <b>grit</b> grains are more uneven in coarser grit size abrasives; thus, more defects and a worse surface finish have been induced by using coarser grit size abrasives.|$|E

Conference Address: Dalian, PEOPLES R CHINA. Time:APR 26 - 29, 2010. The {{ultrasonic}} vibration-assisted machining (UVAM) {{technology is}} increasingly attractive for the ultraprecision machining of brittle materials. But the machining mechanism for UVAM is still unknown, {{especially for the}} grinding process. In this paper, the kinematical characteristics of two-dimensional vertical ultrasonic vibration-assisted grinding (UVAG) technology are investigated. A consistent physical modeling of the grinding process with ultrasonic vibration assistance is established firstly, {{which is based on}} the interaction of individual grinding grains with the workpiece. Then the kinematical equation is deduced, and so does the velocity and acceleration of a single <b>abrasive</b> <b>grit</b> relative to the workpiece in UVAG. The kinematics of a single <b>abrasive</b> <b>grit</b> during 2 D UVAG is simulated for the perpendicular vibration mode. The results show that the relation motion of an <b>abrasive</b> <b>grit</b> is altered significantly with the assistance of ultrasonic vibration, and the grinding path is elongated, which will increase the material removal rate per <b>abrasive</b> <b>grit.</b> The most interesting result is that the relative velocity of an <b>abrasive</b> <b>grit</b> in UVAG is changed slightly when compared to that without ultrasonication. While the relative acceleration in UVAG is increasing tremendously, especially for high frequency ratio (a ratio between the vibration frequency to the rotation frequency) condition. This result means that the ultrasonic vibration assistance can introduce a huge acceleration impact on the material in the machining deformation zone by the grinding grit, and may change the material removal mechanism of grinding. Thus it can do a favor to the precision machining of brittle materials. The UVAG experiment of polysilicon shows that the surface roughness is improved and the normal and tangential grinding forces decrease with the increasing of applied voltage, while the axial grinding force increases. The results indicate that the assistance of ultrasonic vibration can result the change of the grinding mechanism of brittle material...|$|E
30|$|Corresponding to {{the surface}} {{topography}} observations, a high amount of large smearing areas or adhesive chips (Fig.  11 a 1) was observed in the cross section from grinding by using 60 # grit size abrasive. In addition, cold welded chips with formation of microcracks (Fig.  11 a 2) were also visible. Both the amount and size of such defects decreased when finer (180 # and 400 #) grit size abrasives were used. Images in Fig.  11 show that the <b>abrasive</b> <b>grit</b> size has major influence on both the degree of deformation and the deformation depth. Grinding with a 60 # grit size abrasive induced a heavily deformed surface layer of 3 – 4  μm in thickness with a clear fragmented grain structure. The thickness of the heavily deformed layer was reduced to nearly the half when using 180 #, and around one third by 400 #.
