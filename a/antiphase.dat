5|$|Transversal {{filters are}} not usually {{associated}} with passive implementations but the concept {{can be found in}} a Wiener and Lee patent from 1935 which describes a filter consisting of a cascade of all-pass sections. The outputs of the various sections are summed in the proportions needed to result in the required frequency function. This works by the principle that certain frequencies will be in, or close to <b>antiphase,</b> at different sections and will tend to cancel when added. These are the frequencies rejected by the filter and can produce filters with very sharp cut-offs. This approach did not find any immediate applications, and is not common in passive filters. However, the principle finds many applications as an active delay line implementation for wide band discrete-time filter applications such as television, radar and high-speed data transmission.|$|E

The dispersion relation for this case is of a more complicated form.|$|E

However, in this approach, sound frequencies with a wavelength {{longer than the}} baffle dimensions are canceled out, because the <b>antiphase</b> radiation {{from the rear of}} the cone interferes with the radiation from the front. With an infinitely large panel, this interference could be entirely prevented. A sufficiently large sealed box can approach this behavior.|$|E

Unlike the cophased MP mode it is purely quantum excitation which has no classic plasma analogue. It is found that zero momentum degeneracy for the <b>antiphased</b> and cophased modes predicted by the first-order perturbation approach {{in terms of the}} e-e interaction is lifted. The zero momentum energy gap is determined by a negative correlation shift of the <b>antiphased</b> mode. This shift, observed experimentally and calculated theoretically within the second-order perturbation approach, is proportional to the effective Rydberg constant in a semiconductor material.

Simulations with a general circulation model that incorporates isotopic variations support this pattern as well as the link to insolation-driven monsoon activity. Our results suggest that convective heating over tropical South America and associated adjustments in large-scale subsidence over northeast Brazil lead to a remote forcing of the South American monsoon, which determines most of the precipitation changes in the region on orbital timescales.

500|$|There are a {{great many}} {{combinations}} of resonators and transducers {{that can be used}} to construct a mechanical filter. A selection of some of these is shown in the diagrams. Figure 6 shows a filter using disc flexural resonators and magnetostrictive transducers. The transducer drives the centre of the first resonator, causing it to vibrate. The edges of the disc move in <b>antiphase</b> to the centre when the driving signal is at, or close to, resonance, and the signal is transmitted through the connecting rods to the next resonator. [...] When the driving signal is not close to resonance, there is little movement at the edges, and the filter rejects (does not pass) the signal. Figure 7 shows a similar idea involving longitudinal resonators connected together in a chain by connecting rods. In this diagram, the filter is driven by piezoelectric transducers. It could equally well have used magnetostrictive transducers. Figure 8 shows a filter using torsional resonators. In this diagram, the input has a torsional piezoelectric transducer and the output has a magnetostrictive transducer. This would be quite unusual in a real design, as both input and output usually have the same type of transducer. The magnetostrictive transducer is only shown here to demonstrate how longitudinal vibrations may be converted to torsional vibrations and vice versa. Figure 9 shows a filter using drumhead mode resonators. The edges of the discs are fixed to the casing of the filter (not shown in the diagram) so the vibration of the disc is in the same modes as the membrane of a drum. Collins calls this type of filter a disc wire filter.|$|E

2500|$|The amount {{by which}} such {{oscillators}} {{are out of}} phase with each other can be expressed in degrees from 0° to 360°, or in radians from 0 to 2π. If the phase difference is 180 degrees (π radians), then the two oscillators {{are said to be}} in <b>antiphase.</b> If two interacting waves meet at a point where they are in <b>antiphase,</b> then destructive interference will occur. It is common for waves of electromagnetic (light, RF), acoustic (sound) or other energy to become superposed in their transmission medium.

2500|$|The sum of two counter-propagating waves (of equal {{amplitude}} and frequency) {{creates a}} standing wave. [...] Standing waves commonly arise when a boundary blocks further propagation of the wave, thus causing wave reflection, and therefore introducing a counter-propagating wave. [...] For example, when a violin string is displaced, transverse waves propagate {{out to where}} the string is held {{in place at the}} bridge and the nut, where the waves are reflected back. [...] At the bridge and nut, the two opposed waves are in <b>antiphase</b> and cancel each other, producing a node. Halfway between two nodes there is an antinode, where the two counter-propagating waves enhance each other maximally. There is no net propagation of energy over time.|$|E

40|$|High {{precision}} {{comparison of}} Greenland and Antarctic ice cores, suggesting a pervasive <b>antiphased</b> temperature {{relationship between the}} polar hemispheres during the last glaciation, lends strong support to the bipolar seesaw model (EPICA, 2006). The extent to which reorganisation of ocean-heat transport during abrupt climate change events affected the southern mid-latitudes remains unclear, however, owing to a paucity of well-dated records with robust climate proxies, variability between some records, and varying interpretations of their significance. Here we present temperature reconstructions for three key pollen records recognised by the NZ-INTIMATE (NZ-I) group which, along with the preliminary NZ-I climate event stratigraphy (Alloway et al., 2007) and published marine records, are compared with polar ice core records for the interval 30 – 10 cal. ka. We focus on key events {{within the context of}} Dansgard Oeschger cycles 4 – 1 and The Antarctic Cold Reversal/Younger Dryas intervals. The New Zealand records are broadly consistent with an extended bipolar seesaw whereby the oceanic southern mid-latitudes are warmed at times of MOC weakening or cessation in the North Atlantic, and vice versa. Variability between records indicate that other factors must be involved, however, and nor do these records refute alternative models that predict an <b>antiphased</b> inter-hemispheric pattern. Nevertheless an extended bipolar model may explain an early onset of LGM conditions in New Zealand and elsewhere in the Southern Hemisphere at a time when interstadials GI 3 and GI 4 kept Greenland warm. Similar inter-hemispheric dynamics have been invoked to explain an earlier termination of the LGM in Antarctica than in Greenland (Wolff et al., 2009) which is also evident in the New Zealand records. A prominent mid-LGM interstadial complex observed in several New Zealand records, connected by tephrochronology may represent another <b>antiphased</b> event although stronger chronological control is needed to support this assertion. By comparison, the variability evident between New Zealand Lateglacial records cannot be explained simply by chronological imprecision and there may be latitudinal controls {{on the extent to which}} the Antarctic pattern is registered, as has been suggested from other records from the southern mid-high latitudes. Consolidation of these patterns is needed from more precise climate reconstructions at sites spread across latitudinal gradients in both the marine and terrestrial realms...|$|R
40|$|Although climate {{records from}} several {{locations}} around the world show nearly synchronous and abrupt changes, {{the nature of the}} inferred teleconnection is still poorly understood. On the basis of preserved laminations and molybdenum enrichments in open margin sediments we demonstrate that the oxygen content of northeast Pacific waters at 800 m depth during the Bolling-Allerod warm period (15 - 13 kyr) was greatly reduced. Existing oxygen isotopic records of benthic and planktonic foraminifera suggest that this was probably due to suppressed ventilation at higher latitudes of the North Pacific. Comparison with ventilation records for the North Atlantic indicates an <b>antiphased</b> pattern of convection relative to the North Pacific over the past 22 kyr, perhaps due to variations in water vapor transport across Central America...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{dynamics}} of a laser oscillating on L optical transitions connecting a common upper level and L lower sublevels. Each transition is single mode. The minimal generalization of the rate equations to explain the experimental observations includes the low-frequency coherence dynamics [Europhys. Lett. 45, 307 (1999) ]. These equations are studied analytically. We prove that such a laser has a low intensity self-pulsing threshold corresponding to the destabilization of the lowest of the relaxation oscillation frequencies. It also displays <b>antiphased</b> dynamics in the time-periodic regime, resulting in a vanishingly small oscillation amplitude of the total intensity while modal intensities have finite amplitude oscillations.

5000|$|An <b>antiphase</b> domain (APD) {{is a type}} of crystallographic {{defect in}} which the atoms in a region of a crystal are {{configured}} in the opposite order to those in the perfect lattice system. In other words, an APD is a region formed from antisite defects of a parent lattice. Crucially, crystals on either side of an <b>antiphase</b> domain boundary are related by a translation, rather than a reflection (a crystal twin) or an inversion (an inversion domain). In general, APDs form <b>antiphase</b> boundaries (APBs) with the parent lattice. Confusion between inversion domains and <b>antiphase</b> domains is common, even in the published literature, and particularly in the case of GaAs grown on silicon.

The breakdown of the ringed state is quantified in terms of the <b>antiphasing</b> of these force components which drives a Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and we show that the resulting vortex grid spacing scales with the ring wavelength.

40|$|Holocene {{variations}} of tropical moisture balance have been ascribed to orbitally forced changes in solar insolation.

Today, sea-surface temperatures in the equatorial Pacific Ocean modulate rainfall variability in the outer tropical Andes of both hemispheres, and we suggest that this mechanism was pervasive throughout the Holocene.
