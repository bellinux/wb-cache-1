By 1983, overall economic growth was stronger, and inflation and mortgage rates had fallen to their lowest levels in 13 years, although manufacturing employment <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>share</b> of total employment fell to just over 30%, with total unemployment remaining high, peaking at 3.3million in 1984.|$|E

The services sector accounts {{for more than half of}} GDP (54%), compared to 11% for manufacturing and 8% for other industries, including natural uranium mining. Malawi invests more in agriculture (<b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>share</b> of GDP) than any other African country: 28% of GDP.|$|E
5|$|While, unsurprisingly, {{military}} spending constituted the largest {{part of the}} national government's budget {{over the course of the}} war, over time the payment of interest and principal on acquired debt grew <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>share</b> of the Confederate government's expenditure. While initially, in early 1861, war expenditure was 95% of the budget, by October 1864 that share fell to 40%, with the majority of the rest (56% overall) being accounted for by debt service. Civilian expenditures and spending on the Navy (recorded separately from general war expenditures in Confederate records) never exceeded 10% of the budget.|$|E

The IFC's cash and liquid investments accounted for 83% of its estimated net cash requirements for fiscal years 2012 through 2014. Its external funding liquidity level grew from 190% in 2010 to 266% in 2011. It has a 2.6:1 debt-to-equity ratio and holds 6.6% in reserves against losses on loans to its disbursement portfolio.

5|$|Nurmi {{struggled}} to maintain motivation for running, heightened by his rheumatism and Achilles tendon problems. He {{quit his job}} as a machinery draughtsman in 1926 and began studying business intensively. As Nurmi started a new career <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>share</b> dealer, his financial advisors included Risto Ryti, director of the Bank of Finland. In 1926, Nurmi broke Wide's world record for the 3000 m in Berlin and then improved the record in Stockholm, despite Nils Eklöf repeatedly trying to slow his pace down in an effort to aid Wide. Nurmi was furious at the Swedes and vowed never to race Eklöf again. In October 1926, he lost a 1500 m race along with his world record to Germany's Otto Peltzer. This marked the first time in over five years and 133 races that Nurmi had been defeated at a distance over 1000 m. In 1927, Finnish officials barred him from international competition for refusing to run against Eklöf at the Finland-Sweden international, cancelling the Peltzer rematch scheduled for Vienna. Nurmi ended his season and threatened, until late November, to withdraw from the 1928 Summer Olympics. At the 1928 Olympic trials, Nurmi was left third in the 1500 m by eventual gold and bronze medalists Harri Larva and Eino Purje, and he decided to concentrate on the longer distances. He added steeplechase to his program, although he had only tried the event twice before, the latest being a two-mile steeplechase victory at the 1922 British Championships.|$|E

25|$|Historically, the US {{public debt}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>share</b> of gross {{domestic}} product (GDP) has increased during wars and recessions, and subsequently declined. The ratio of debt to GDP may decrease {{as a result of a}} government surplus or due to growth of GDP and inflation. For example, debt held by the public <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>share</b> of GDP peaked just after World War II (113% of GDP in 1945), but then fell over the following 35 years. In recent decades, aging demographics and rising healthcare costs have led to concern about the long-term sustainability of the federal government's fiscal policies.|$|E

25|$|Several {{measures}} {{serve as}} indicators of the long-term financial status of Medicare. These include total Medicare spending <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>share</b> {{of gross domestic product}} (GDP), the solvency of the Medicare HI trust fund, Medicare per-capita spending growth relative to inflation and per-capita GDP growth; general fund revenue <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>share</b> of total Medicare spending; and actuarial estimates of unfunded liability over the 75-year timeframe and the infinite horizon (netting expected premium/tax revenue against expected costs). The major issue in all these indicators is comparing any future projections against current law vs. what the actuaries expect to happen. For example, current law specifies that Part A payments to hospitals and skilled nursing facilities will be cut substantially after 2028 and that doctors will get no raises after 2025. The actuaries expect that the law will change to keep these events from happening.|$|E
