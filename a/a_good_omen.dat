5|$|The jackdaw was {{considered}} sacred in Welsh folklore as it nested in church steeples– it was shunned by the Devil {{because of its}} choice of residence. Nineteenth century belief in the Fens held that seeing a jackdaw {{on the way to}} a wedding was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>omen</b> for a bride.|$|E
5|$|In a Christianized version, the duel {{involves}} the Christian St.Elijah and the ala, {{but there is}} a belief that the saint and the dragons in fact cooperate: as soon as St.Elijah spots an ala, he summons the dragons, either takes them aboard his chariot or harnesses them to it, and they jointly shoot the ala with lightning. Arrow-shaped stones, like belemnites or stone-age arrowheads, are regarded as materialized lightning bolts imbued with a beneficial magical power, and finding one is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>omen.</b>|$|E
5|$|Other stories tell of kitsune marrying one another. Rain {{falling from}} a clear sky— a sunshower— is called kitsune no yomeiri or the kitsune's wedding, in {{reference}} to a folktale describing a wedding ceremony between the creatures being held during such conditions. The event is considered <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>omen,</b> but the kitsune will seek revenge on any uninvited guests, as is depicted in the 1990 Akira Kurosawa film Dreams.|$|E

5|$|In 1066, {{the comet}} {{was seen in}} England and thought to be an omen: later that year Harold II of England died at the Battle of Hastings; {{it was a bad}} omen for Harold, but <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>omen</b> for the man who {{defeated}} him, William the Conqueror. The comet is represented on the Bayeux Tapestry and described in the tituli as a star. Surviving accounts from the period describe it as appearing to be four times the size of Venus and shining with a light equal to a quarter of that of the Moon. Halley came within 0.10AU of Earth at that time.|$|E
5|$|The {{stone in}} the Capitoline Temple was {{believed}} to have been among the altars located on the Capitoline Hill before the Temple was built under Tarquinius Priscus (traditional reign 616579 BC) or Tarquinius Superbus (535510 BC). When the augurs took the auspices to discover whether the god or goddess of each altar was content for it to be moved, Terminus refused permission, either alone or along with Juventas the goddess of youth. The stone was therefore included within the Capitoline Temple, and its immovability was regarded as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>omen</b> for the permanence of the city's boundaries.|$|E
5|$|As the Cardiff team bus {{arrived at}} the stadium, the fans threw leeks at the vehicle. The team had adopted a black cat for the occasion, which Ferguson had found {{wandering}} astray prior to their earlier match with Bolton and decided it was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>omen.</b> He found {{the owners of the}} animal, who agreed to let the club keep the cat in return for two final tickets if they progressed that far. Police reinforcements were required at Empire Stadium, as at 1pm {{a large number of people}} had gathered outside the ticket office in a threatening manner. A large number of fake tickets had been sold to members of the crowd, and the stewards were refusing to allow them entry.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1996 Ridley Scott film White Squall, a fictionalized {{account of}} the Ocean Academy's ship Albatross, the ship's captain Christopher Sheldon makes mention of the {{albatross}} being <b>a</b> very <b>good</b> <b>omen</b> which [...] "embodied the spirits of lost sailors". [...] "Only bad luck if you kill one," [...] he added.|$|R

5|$|Beginning in October 1962, Plath {{experienced}} a great burst {{of creativity and}} wrote most of the poems on which her reputation now rests, writing at least 26 of the poems of her posthumous collection Ariel during the final months of her life. In December 1962, she returned alone to London with their children, and rented, on a five-year lease, a flat at 23 Fitzroy Road—only a few streets from the Chalcot Square flat. William Butler Yeats once lived in the house, which bears an English Heritage blue plaque for the Irish poet. Plath was pleased by this fact and considered it <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>omen.</b>|$|E
25|$|According to a sailing superstition, {{swallows}} are <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>omen</b> {{to those}} at sea. This probably {{arose from the}} fact that swallows are land-based birds, so their appearance informs a sailor that he is close to shore.|$|E
25|$|His arrival on 18 July {{was well}} {{received}} by the Antiochenes, though it coincided with {{the celebration of the}} Adonia, a festival which marked the death of Adonis, so there was wailing and moaning in the streets—not <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>omen</b> for an arrival.|$|E
5|$|Inari's kitsune are white, <b>a</b> {{color of}} <b>good</b> <b>omen.</b> They possess {{the power to}} ward off evil, and they {{sometimes}} serve as guardian spirits. In addition to protecting Inari shrines, they are petitioned to intervene {{on behalf of the}} locals and particularly to aid against troublesome nogitsune, those spirit foxes who do not serve Inari. Black foxes and nine-tailed foxes are likewise considered <b>good</b> <b>omens.</b>|$|R
25|$|From 2002 to 2006, Gilliam {{tried to}} get funding for <b>an</b> {{adaptation}} of <b>Good</b> <b>Omens,</b> by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman, with Robin Williams and Johnny Depp rumored as possible stars, but movie studios found the apocalyptic theme unacceptable {{in the wake of}} the 9/11 terror attacks, and funding never materialized.|$|R
5|$|In 2016, Neil Gaiman {{stated that}} Terry {{had given him}} his blessing {{to go forward with}} <b>an</b> {{adaptation}} of <b>Good</b> <b>Omens</b> if he so wished.

In January 2017 Gaiman confirmed the miniseries will be available on Amazon Prime in 2018 and will be broadcast on the BBC after its Amazon release.|$|R
25|$|Though {{the battle}} was tactically indecisive, the British {{officers}} involved became popular heroes for their daring in fighting against heavy odds. The young nephew {{of one of the}} officers present, who was in time to also embark on a naval career, was Horatio Nelson. Nelson considered the date of the battle <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>omen,</b> when 48 years to the day later, he faced a French fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar.|$|E
25|$|Thus, if on {{a certain}} occasion, {{the rise of the}} new moon in a cloudy sky was {{followed}} by victory over an enemy or by abundant rain, the sign in question was thus proved to be a favourable one and its recurrence would thenceforth be regarded as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>omen,</b> though the prognostication would not necessarily be limited to the {{one or the other of}} those occurrences, but might be extended to apply to other circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Clark {{and his men}} set {{off from}} Corn Island on June 24, 1778, leaving behind seven {{soldiers}} who were deemed not hardy enough for the journey. These men stayed with the families {{on the island and}} guarded the provisions stored there. Clark's force numbered about 175 men, organized in four companies under Captains Bowman, Helm, Harrod, and Montgomery. They passed over the whitewater of the falls during a total solar eclipse, which some of the men regarded as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>omen.</b>|$|E
50|$|The lead {{characters}} of Anthony Crowley (a demon) and Aziraphale (<b>an</b> angel) from <b>Good</b> <b>Omens,</b> by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman, both use minced oaths {{on a number}} of occasions, though for different reasons (Aziraphale genuinely means to avoid offense, while Crowley, being a demon, simply finds it more acceptable to his post to say 'gosh' instead of 'God').|$|R
5000|$|The {{backwards}} uma (shogi horse symbol) {{is often}} featured on merchandise (such as on large decorative shogi piece sculptures, keychains, and other keepsakes) available {{for sale in}} Tendō. It is also serves as <b>a</b> symbol of <b>good</b> luck. (Cf. Rabbit's foot.) There are multiple theories on its origin. One is that uma (うま [...] ) spelled in the Japanese syllabary backwards is まう mau (舞う), which means (to) dance and dancing horses are <b>a</b> <b>good</b> luck <b>omen.</b>|$|R

25|$|A band of Pokanoket {{attacked}} several isolated homesteads in {{the small}} Plymouth colony settlement of Swansea on June 20, 1675 (O.S.). They laid siege to the town, then destroyed it five days later and killed several more people. On June 27, 1675 (O.S.) (July 7, 1675 N.S.; See Old Style and New Style dates), a full eclipse of the moon occurred in the New England area. Various tribes in New England looked at it as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>omen</b> for attacking the colonists. Officials from the Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies responded quickly to the attacks on Swansea; on June 28, they sent a punitive military expedition that destroyed the Wampanoag town at Mount Hope (modern Bristol, Rhode Island).|$|E
25|$|In 1968, {{when the}} New York {{building}} they were renting {{was put up}} for sale, Sun Ra and the Arkestra relocated to the Germantown section of Philadelphia. Sun Ra got a house on Morton Street that became the Arkestra's base of operations until his death. Apart from occasional complaints about the noise of rehearsals, they were soon regarded as good neighbors because of their friendliness, drug-free living, and rapport with youngsters. The saxophonist Danny RayThompson owned and operated the Pharaoh's Den, a convenience store in the neighborhood. When lightning struck a tree on their street, Sun Ra took it as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>omen.</b> James Jacson fashioned the Cosmic Infinity Drum from the scorched tree trunk. They commuted via railroad to New York for the Monday night gig at Slug's and for other engagements.|$|E
25|$|Pang De {{made his}} first {{appearance}} in chapter 58 as a trusted general under Ma Teng. At that time, Ma Teng had left Liang Province and travelled to the imperial capital Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan) while Ma Chao remained in the province. One night, Ma Chao had a dream about being attacked by a pack of tigers in a snowy land so he consulted his subordinates about it. Pang De {{told him that it}} was not <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>omen.</b> Later, Ma Chao received news that his father Ma Teng was lured into a trap in Xu and had been killed by Cao Cao's men. This led to the Battle of Tong Pass, but in the novel, the order of events related to the battle had been reversed and some fictional stories were included.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{scholars}} have proposed {{the town of}} Currium or Curria, Quirinus, *quir(i)s or *quiru, the Sabine word for spear and curia. The *quiru- would design the sacred spear that gave the name to the primitive curiae. The discovery at Sulmona of a sanctuary of Hercules Curinus lends support to a Sabine origin of the epithet and of the cult of Juno in the curiae. The spear could also be the celibataris hasta (bridal spear) that in the marriage ceremonies was used to comb the bridegroom's hair as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>omen.</b> Palmer views the rituals of the curiae devoted {{to her as a}} reminiscence of the origin of the curiae themselves in rites of evocatio, practise the Romans continued to use for Juno or her equivalent at later times as for Falerii, Veii and Carthage. Juno Curitis would then be the evoked deity after her admission into the curiae.|$|E
25|$|Until 1432, the subaşi (governor) of Krujë {{had been}} Zagan Bey, then Hizir Bey, and later during 1437—1438 Skanderbeg was its governor. In November 1438 Hizir Bey was again {{appointed}} as subaşi of Krujë {{until he was}} replaced in April 1440 by Umur Bey. On 28 November 1443 Skanderbeg gained control over Krujë by deceiving its subaşi with forged sultan's letter. In 1444 Skanderbeg incorporated it in the League of Lezhë, the confederation of the Albanian principalities. From 1450 until 1477 Krujë was defended successfully by the Albanian troops four times against the Ottoman army, which eventually captured it in 1478 during the fourth Siege of the city. During the first siege of Krujë in 1450, the 1,500 to 2,000 soldiers of the League of Lezhë under Vrana Konti and Skanderbeg defeated an Ottoman force of about 100,000 men led by Sultan Murad II, {{who had tried to}} bribe Konti to surrender the castle of the town. In the following decade Krujë was first besieged in 1466 and then in 1467 unsuccessfully by Ballaban Pasha and Sultan Mehmed II, whose total troops were about 150,000. After Skanderbeg's death in 1468, the city's garrison was supplemented by troops of the Republic of Venice. In 1476 the town was once more besieged by a ten-thousand-man army under Gedik Ahmed Pasha; however, the local garrison led by proveditor Pietro Vetturi fended off the Ottoman besiegers, who retreated after the arrival of reinforcements under Francesco Contarini and Nikollë Dukagjini. The city was eventually conquered by the Ottomans in 1478 after being besieged for over a year. This success was viewed by the Ottomans as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>omen</b> that the siege of Shkodra would also be successful.|$|E
500|$|Going {{into the}} last match of the Football League season, Small Heath were in {{second place in the}} division, one point ahead of opponents Notts County. Neither could {{challenge}} Liverpool for the title, but both were sure of their places in the promotion test matches. The likely opponent for the team finishing second would be Darwen, whereas the third-placed team could expect the rather tougher prospect of Preston North End. Notts County had won the FA Cup the previous weekend, and the Daily Post took that as <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>omen,</b> [...] "inasmuch as the winners of the English Cup rarely do themselves justice on the following Saturday".|$|E

His mother, Mary Darcy Cullen was a fruit seller and Cullen started trading at market stalls from a very young age. His father Billy was in the Irish Army Reserve and was for the most part unemployed, or working on the dock and getting labour that was not much for the Cullen family.|$|R
