5|$|Eight {{species of}} {{crocodilians}} {{are known to}} have attacked humans. The largest number of attacks comes from the Nile crocodile. Humans <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> threat to crocodilian populations through activities that include hunting and habitat destruction, but farming of crocodilians has greatly reduced unlawful trading in wild skins. Artistic and literary representations of crocodilians have appeared in human cultures around the world since at least Ancient Egypt. The earliest known mention of the story that crocodiles weep for their victims was in the 9th century; it was later spread by Sir John Mandeville in 1400 and then by William Shakespeare in the late 16th century and early 17th century.|$|E
5|$|The lion (Panthera leo) {{is one of}} the big cats in the Felidae {{family and}} a member of genus Panthera. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996, as populations in African range {{countries}} declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas.

The West African lion population is listed as Critically Endangered since 2016. The only lion population in Asia survives in and around India's Gir Forest National Park and is listed as Endangered since 1986.|$|E

5|$|Among all predators, ants <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> {{enemy to}} termites. Some ant genera are {{specialist}} predators of termites. For example, Megaponera is a strictly termite-eating (termitophagous) genus that perform raiding activities, some lasting several hours. Paltothyreus tarsatus is another termite-raiding species, with each individual stacking as many termites {{as possible in}} its mandibles before returning home, all the while recruiting additional nestmates to the raiding site through chemical trails. The Malaysian basicerotine ants Eurhopalothrix heliscata uses a different strategy of termite hunting by pressing themselves into tight spaces, as they hunt through rotting wood housing termite colonies. Once inside, the ants seize their prey by using their short but sharp mandibles. Tetramorium uelense is a specialised predator species that feeds on small termites. A scout recruits 10–30 workers to an area where termites are present, killing them by immobilising them with their stinger. Centromyrmex and Iridomyrmex colonies sometimes nest in termite mounds, and so the termites are preyed on by these ants. No evidence {{for any kind of}} relationship (other than a predatory one) is known. Other ants, including Acanthostichus, Camponotus, Crematogaster, Cylindromyrmex, Leptogenys, Odontomachus, Ophthalmopone, Pachycondyla, Rhytidoponera, Solenopsis and Wasmannia, also prey on termites. In contrast to all these ant species, and despite their enormous diversity of prey, Dorylus ants rarely consume termites.|$|E
5|$|Most of the iodides of the pre-transition metals (groups 1, 2, and 3, {{along with}} the {{lanthanides}} and actinides in the +2 and +3 oxidation states) are mostly ionic, while nonmetals tend to form covalent molecular iodides, as do metals in high oxidation states from +3 and above. Ionic iodides MIn tend to have the lowest melting and boiling points among the halides MXn of the same element, because the electrostatic forces of attraction between the cations and anions are weakest for the large iodide anion. In contrast, covalent iodides tend to instead have the highest melting and boiling points among the halides of the same element, since iodine is the most polarisable of the halogens and, having the most electrons among them, can contribute the most to van der Waals forces. Naturally, exceptions abound in intermediate iodides where one trend {{gives way to the}} other. Similarly, solubilities in water of predominantly ionic iodides (e.g. potassium and calcium) <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> among ionic halides of that element, while those of covalent iodides (e.g. silver) are the lowest of that element. In particular, silver iodide is very insoluble in water and its formation is often used as a qualitative test for iodine.|$|E

25|$|Ice sheets <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> {{potential}} source of global freshwater, holding approximately 77% of the global total. This corresponds to 80 m of world sea-level equivalent, with Antarctica accounting for 90% of this. Greenland accounts {{for most of the}} remaining 10%, with other ice bodies and glaciers accounting for less than 0.5%. Because of their size in relation to annual rates of snow accumulation and melt, the residence time of water in ice sheets can extend to 100,000 or 1 million years. Consequently, any climatic perturbations produce slow responses, occurring over glacial and interglacial periods. Valley glaciers respond rapidly to climatic fluctuations with typical response times of 10–50 years. However, the response of individual glaciers may be asynchronous to the same climatic forcing because of differences in glacier length, elevation, slope, and speed of motion. Oerlemans (1994) provided evidence of coherent global glacier retreat which could be explained by a linear warming trend of 0.66nbsp&°C per 100 years.|$|E

25|$|Ants <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>greatest</b> {{threat of}} {{predation}} for P. exigua. Many of the wasps’ traits, such as polygyny and protective nest structures, are suggested to be survival tactics against ant predation pressures. P. exigua are also observed to swarm and use scent-trail diversions as defense strategies. During Megaselia infestation, workers attempt to destroy all infested cells {{in order to}} terminate the parasitoids. However, wasps are often unable to eradicate the phorid pupae due to their strong attachment to the cell bottom. If the workers fail, then the wasps close the nest entrances and the colony flees to another location in the neighborhood {{to build a new}} nest. Once they have established a new nest, wasps will entirely close the old nest’s entrance, which prevents the encroaching parasitoid flies from coming inside. The wasps also fan their wings and use their mandibles to peck attack the phorid flies. Since P. exigua seem to be specialized against the common predation of ants, Megaselia easily defeat the wasps’ defense strategies and frequently invade the species nests.|$|E
