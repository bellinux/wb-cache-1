5|$|About 0.3–0.7% {{of people}} are {{affected}} by schizophrenia during their lifetimes. In 2013 there were an estimated 23.6 million cases globally. Males are more often affected than females. About 20% of people do well and a few recover completely. Social problems, such as long-term unemployment, poverty and homelessness are common. The average life expectancy of people with the disorder is ten to twenty-five years less than for the general population. This {{is the result of}} increased physical health problems <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> suicide rate (about 5%). In 2015 an estimated 17,000 people worldwide died from behavior related to, or caused by, schizophrenia.|$|E

5|$|Afternoon is {{the time}} of the day between noon and evening. It {{is the time}} when the sun is {{descending}} from its zenith in the sky to somewhat before its terminus at the horizon in the west direction. In human life, it occupies roughly {{the latter half of the}} standard work and school day. It is also associated with a number of concerns related to health, safety, and economic productivity: generally, the early afternoon, after most people have eaten lunch, corresponds to decreased work performance, decreased alertness, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> incidence of motor vehicle accidents. It is usually from 12 PM to 6 PM, but during winter it may be from 12 PM to 4 PM and during summer it may be from 12 PM to 8 PM.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{bay bolete}} is {{predominantly}} a mycorrhizal species, {{it does have}} some saprophytic tendencies and {{may be able to}} use this lifestyle in certain circumstances. The ectomycorrhizae formed between I.badia and spruce (Picea abies) have active hyphal sheaths <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> potential to store nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, iron, and zinc than other mycorrhizal types, indicating the fungus is well adapted to acidic stands and its mycorrhizae are very efficient in uptake and storage of macronutrients. Mycorrhizae with Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) have also been described.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Britain, from July to October 1940, the Spitfire was {{perceived}} by the public {{to be the main}} RAF fighter, though the more numerous Hawker Hurricane shouldered a greater proportion of the burden against Nazi Germany's air force, the Luftwaffe. Spitfire units, however, had a lower attrition rate <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> victory-to-loss ratio than those flying Hurricanes because of its higher performance. During the Battle, Spitfires in general were tasked with engaging Luftwaffe fightersmainly Messerschmitt Bf 109E series aircraft which were a close match for them.|$|E

5|$|England {{abruptly}} {{retired in}} 1997 {{and was replaced}} by Jeff Brokamp, who had been principal of the Crest Hills Year-Round School, which had won awards for its all-year curriculum. Brokamp, with no previous arts experience, began to turn the school around. A new emphasis on academics, more Advanced Placement courses and more stringent audition standards that admitted only the most dedicated students led to better test scores <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> level of artistic talent; Brokamp pushed to expand the school's vocational training programs in photography, stage management, and costume design by 50percent.

5|$|In 1801, Guinness West India Porter, {{the direct}} {{predecessor}} of Foreign Extra Stout, was first exported from the St. James's Gate brewery in Dublin. The product was formulated for Irish immigrant {{workers in the}} Caribbean. The beer was only brewed between October and April, which reduced acidification, and was matured in large wooden vats {{for up to two}} years, which gave the finished product greater stability. To survive the long journey overseas, which was then taken by ship, it was brewed with extra hops <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> alcohol content, which acted as natural preservatives for the beer. Exported in barrels, the product was then bottled locally, which helped to reduce costs.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, {{the towers}} were {{redesigned}} in the Dutch Renaissance style {{but after the}} serious fire of 1702 they were temporarily replaced by low wooden tops. At the same time, the buttresses were removed giving the cathedral the rather plain look conveyed by pictures of the period. Only in 1740 were copper-faced spires installed, designed by Carl Hårleman. At the same time, Hårleman carried out significant work on the west façade. Today's towers are the work of Helgo Zettervall who completely rebuilt them in the 1880s, substantially increasing their height. After the serious fire of 1702, the original flying buttresses were removed <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> roof was built.|$|E

5|$|Incapillo {{is part of}} a {{volcanic}} system active between 3.5 and 2mya that includes Ojos del Salado and Nevado Tres Cruces. It was the last volcanic centre formed in the region; subsequently, the shallowing of the subducting slab prevented volcanism east and south of it. Another volcanic trend considers Incapillo as part of a northeastsouthwest trend with Cerro Galan and Cerro Blanco. This trend may be related to delamination of the lower crust. Also, these centres are located between two domains of different rigidity, an Ordovician sedimentary domain of low rigidity <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> rigidity basement.|$|E
5|$|Jevons {{warned that}} fuel {{efficiency}} gains tend to increase fuel use. But {{this does not}} imply that improved fuel efficiency is worthless: higher fuel efficiency enables greater production <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> material quality of life. For example, a more efficient steam engine allowed the cheaper transport of goods and people that contributed to the Industrial Revolution. However, if the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate is correct, increased fuel efficiency, by itself, will not reduce the rate of depletion of fossil fuels.|$|E

5|$|Several {{cities in}} California and Oregon, and {{particularly}} San Francisco {{and other cities}} in the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley, already have deployed public charging stations and have expansion plans to attend both plug-ins and all-electric cars. Some local private firms such as Google and Adobe Systems have also deployed charging infrastructure. In Google's case, its Mountain View campus has 100 available charging stations for its share-use fleet of converted plug-ins available to its employees. Solar panels are used to generate the electricity, and this pilot program is being monitored {{on a daily basis}} and performance results are published on the RechargeIT website. , Estonia is the first and only country that had deployed an EV charging network with nationwide coverage, with 165 fast chargers available along highways at a minimum distance of between , <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> density in urban areas.|$|E

Increased budget and production facilities enabled the use of filming styles associated with live action films <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> animation quality than the series. Arabic thematic elements were incorporated to contrast against the series, which entailed Watanabe traveling to Morocco for research. The Arabic atmosphere was also used in Kanno's music.|$|E
5|$|A pair {{will work}} {{together}} to help build the nest, incubate the eggs and raise their altricial young. However, in most species the male {{does most of the}} nest excavation and takes the night shift while incubating the eggs. A clutch will usually consist of two to five round white eggs. Since these birds are cavity nesters, their eggs {{do not need to be}} camouflaged and the white color helps the parents to see them in dim light. The eggs are incubated for about 11–14 days before they hatch. It then takes about 18–30 days before the chicks are fully fledged and ready to leave the nest. In most species, soon after this the young are left to fend for themselves, exceptions being the various social species, and the Hispaniolan woodpecker, where adults continue to feed their young for several months. In general, cavity nesting is a successful strategy <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> proportion of young are reared than is the case with birds that nest in the open. In Africa, several species of honeyguide are brood parasites of woodpeckers.|$|E
5|$|A scuba diver moves {{underwater}} {{by using}} fins {{attached to the}} feet; external propulsion can be provided by a diver propulsion vehicle, or a towboard pulled from the surface. Other equipment includes a diving mask to improve underwater vision, a protective diving suit, equipment to control buoyancy, and equipment related to the specific circumstances and purpose of the dive. Scuba divers are trained in the procedures and skills appropriate to their level of certification by instructors affiliated to the diver certification organisations which issue these diver certifications. These include standard operating procedures for using the equipment {{and dealing with the}} general hazards of the underwater environment, and emergency procedures for self-help and assistance of a similarly equipped diver experiencing problems. A minimum level of fitness and health is required by most training organisations, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> level of fitness may be needed for some applications.|$|E
