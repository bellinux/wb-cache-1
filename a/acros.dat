25|$|While {{international}} aerobatic {{championships in}} the unlimited category {{are dominated by}} Swift S-1 and MDM-1 Fox, pilots have competed successfully with SZD-59 <b>Acros</b> in national and regional championships. Recently, Wolfgang Kasper placed 4th in the German Nationals 2008.|$|E
2500|$|The {{prototype}} {{was first}} demonstrated during the 1991 FAI World Glider Aerobatic Championships in Zielona Góra. Twelve <b>Acros</b> were built by PZL-Bielsko until the production stopped in 1996 due to economic problems.|$|E
40|$|Ten acrotrisomics for {{chromosomes}} 4, 5, 6, 7 and 11 {{and three}} secondary trisomics for chromosomes 4 S, 6 L and 7 S {{were identified by}} somatic chromosome analysis, pachytene analysis and RFLP gene dosage analysis. Ten kinds of acrotrisomics were designated as <b>Acro</b> 4 S^, <b>Acro</b> 5 a, <b>Acro</b> 5 b, <b>Acro</b> 5 c, <b>Acro</b> 6 S^, <b>Acro</b> 7 a, <b>Acro</b> 11 a, <b>Acro</b> 11 b, <b>Acro</b> 11 c and <b>Acro</b> 11 d, and three secondary trisomics were designated as Triplo 4 S 4 S, Triplo 6 L 6 L and Triplo 7 S 7 S. The respective extra chromosomes of ten acrotrisomics and three secondary trisomics, were as follows: <b>Acro</b> 4 S 4 L has an acrocentric chromosome which deleted light stained region of the long arm of chromosome 4; <b>Acro</b> 5 a, <b>Acro</b> 5 b, <b>Acro</b> 5 c contain an acrocentric chromosome with deleted segment or entire long arm of chromosome 5; <b>Acro</b> 6 S^ possesses an acrocentric chromosome with deleted segment of the long arm of chromosome 6; <b>Acro</b> 7 a keeps acrocentric chromosome with deleted segment or entire long arm of chromosome 7; <b>Acro</b> 11 a holds an fragment involving short arm of chromosome 11; <b>Acro</b> 11 b，Acro 11 c and <b>Acro</b> 11 d contain an fragment of chromosome 11; Triplo 4 S 4 S possesses an isochromosome for short arm of chromosome 4; Triplo 6 L 6 L has an isochromosome for long arm of chromosome 6; and Triplo 7 S 7 S contains an isochromosome for short arm of chromosome 7. These acrotrisomics and secondary trisomics can be useful for cytogenetical studies in rice. プライマリートリソミックス(Primary trisomics; PT) の後代ならびに放射線照射処理個体の後代から形態的特徴に基づいて 13 個体のアクロトリソミックス(Acrotrisomics;AT) ならびにセカンダリートリソミックス(Secondarytrisomics; ST) 様個体を選抜し，体細胞染色体ならびに減数分裂太糸期染色体の核型分析， RFLP遺伝子量分析を行なって，それらの過剰染色体を同定した. その結果，染色体 4 ， 5 ， 6 ， 7 ， 11 に関する計 10 種類のAT (<b>Acro</b> 4 S^ ， <b>Acro</b> 5 a， <b>Acro</b> 5 b， <b>Acro</b> 5 c， <b>Acro</b> 6 S^ ， <b>Acro</b> 7 a， <b>Acro</b> 11 a， <b>Acro</b> 11 b， <b>Acro</b> 11 c， <b>Acro</b> 11 d) と染色体 4 の短腕，染色体 6 の長腕，染色体 7 の短腕に関する 3 種類のST(Triplo 4 S 4 S， Triplo 6 L 6 L， Triplo 7 S 7 S) が同定された. 本研究で同定されたATならびにSTはイネの遺伝子マッピングや染色体地図の作成などの細胞遺伝学的研究に有用な系統と考えられた...|$|R
40|$|Seven acrotrisomics (AT: <b>Acro</b> 4 S^, <b>Acro</b> 5 a, <b>Acro</b> 5 b, <b>Acro</b> 5 c, <b>Acro</b> 6 S^, <b>Acro</b> 7 a, <b>Acro</b> 11 a) {{and three}} {{secondary}} trisomics (ST: Triplo 4 S 4 S, Triplo 6 L 6 L, Triplo 7 S 7 S) of rice {{were characterized by}} morphological and cytological traits. The morphological features of the ATs and the STs were apparently distinguished from both of the disomics and the related primary trisomics (PT) in the self-pollinated progenies. <b>Acro</b> 4 S^ and Triplo 4 S 4 S exhibit narrow grains, whereas <b>Acro</b> 5 a, <b>Acro</b> 5 b and <b>Acro</b> 5 c show hairy glumes. Culm length, panicle length and grain shape of <b>Acro</b> 5 a, <b>Acro</b> 5 b and <b>Acro</b> 5 c lie in intermediate between disomics and the PT for chromosome 5 <b>Acro</b> 6 S^ has compact panicles and awned spikelets. Triplo 6 L 6 L has somewhat lax panicle and awned spikelets. These AT and ST are more fertile than the PT for chromosome 6. <b>Acro</b> 7 a and Triplo 7 S 7 S have round grains, compact panicles and short culms. <b>Acro</b> 11 a is short in height, with narrow grains and late flowering. The chromosome regions related to the aneuploid syndrome were estimated by the comparison with extra chromosome of the respective AT, ST and PT. Acrocentric chromosomes and isochromosomes were transmitted {{to the next generation}} with 30 % through the female gametes. The transmission of the extra chromosomes through the male parent was very few except for <b>Acro</b> 5 a (17 %). The frequency of the trivalent formation in the meiosis of the ATs and STs, those extra chromosomes were shorter than their normal homologous chromosomes, were lower than those of the related PTs. These acrotrisomics and secondary trisomics could be useful for cytogenetical studies in rice. 7 種類のアクロトリソミックス(AT: <b>Acro</b> 4 S^ ， <b>Acro</b> 5 a， <b>Acro</b> 5 b， <b>Acro</b> 5 c， <b>Acro</b> 6 S^ ， <b>Acro</b> 7 a， <b>Acro</b> 11 a) と 3 種類のセカンダリートリソミックス(ST: Triplo 4 S 4 S， Triplo 6 L 6 L， Triplo 7 S 7 S) について，形態的および細胞学的な特性調査を行なった. これら 10 種類のトリソミックスの種子稔性，粒長，粒幅，手早長，穂長を調査した結果，それらの自殖次代に分離するダイソミックスおよびプライマリートリソミックス(PT) からATやSTを形態的特徴によって識別できることが明らかになった. また， ATならびにSTとPTを比較することにより，過剰染色体によって生じる特異的な形態的特徴に関与する染色体領域を推定した. ATとSTの次代において，過剰染色体が卵細胞から 30 %前後で伝達し. 花粉からはAcro 5 a (伝達率 17 %) を除いてほとんど伝達しなかった. 正常な染色体よりも長さが短い過剰染色体を有するATやSTでは，減数分裂期の 3 価染色体の形成頻度は約 30 ～ 50 % となり，関連するPT に比べて低かった. 本研究の結果から， ATおよびSTが遺伝子分析や染色体地図作成などの細胞遺伝学的研究に有効な材料であることが明らかとなった...|$|R

25|$|<b>Acro</b> dancers {{most often}} wear jazz dance shoes, which are {{commonly}} referred to as <b>acro</b> shoes by <b>acro</b> dancers. <b>Acro</b> shoes are called jazz boots, jazz ankle boots, jazz booties and other names, by their various manufacturers. They are typically laceless, slip-on shoes, with tight-fitting leather uppers that are designed to prevent the dancer's feet from shifting inside the shoes. Because of their thin, pliable leather uppers and split soles, <b>acro</b> shoes have excellent flexibility, thus enabling dancers to attain both good dance form and acrobatic control. The sole is made of soft, composite rubber so as to provide both high traction and cushioning, and it provides excellent protection from skin abrasion as it covers the entire bottom of the foot.|$|R
25|$|The acrobatic {{movements}} {{and acts of}} balance performed in an <b>acro</b> dance {{are referred to as}} tricks. A variety of tricks are commonly performed in <b>acro</b> dance, varying widely in complexity and the skills required to perform them. Aside from the obvious requirement that dancers possess the requisite skills to perform tricks, the types of tricks that can be performed in an <b>acro</b> dance depends on the number of dancers.|$|R
25|$|<b>Acro</b> dances are {{typically}} performed on hard stages with widely varying surfaces. Such floors differ substantially from a gymnastics floor, which is constructed by layering a standard surface over cushioning foam and spring floor. Whereas gymnasts perform barefoot {{and rely on}} the standard gymnastics floor for traction and cushioning, <b>acro</b> dancers seldom dance barefoot, instead depending on footwear such as <b>acro</b> shoes or foot thongs to provide the necessary traction and cushioning.|$|R
