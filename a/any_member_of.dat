5|$|Zen Master Seung Sahn did {{publicly}} {{admit the}} nature of the relationships and did two repentance ceremonies. The Kwan Um School of Zen has since developed and enforced an ethics committee that has very strict guidelines for teacher/student relationships and consequences for unethical behavior of <b>any</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the school.|$|E
5|$|A {{population}} bottleneck is when {{a population}} contracts to a significantly smaller size over {{a short period of}} time due to some random environmental event. In a true population bottleneck, the odds for survival of <b>any</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the population are purely random, and are not improved by any particular inherent genetic advantage. The bottleneck can result in radical changes in allele frequencies, completely independent of selection.|$|E

5|$|For a {{relatively}} small fee, entrance could be gained by <b>any</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the general public to the Bath complex. While the area was obviously primarily used for public bathing, one could exercise and enjoy a variety of recreational activities. Attendants were paid to oversee these activities, and the happenings of the complex, enforcing opening and closing times, and the rules of conduct. Men and women {{were not allowed to}} bathe together; they would either be in separate baths, or bathe at different times of the day.|$|E
5|$|On a kickoff, {{the ball}} is placed at the 35-yard line of the kicking team in {{professional}} and college play and at the 40-yard line in high school play. The ball may be drop-kicked or place-kicked. If a place kick is chosen, the ball can {{be placed on the}} ground or on a tee, and a holder may be used in either case. On a safety kick, the kicking team kicks the ball from their own 20-yard line. They can punt, drop-kick or place-kick the ball, but a tee may not be used in professional play. <b>Any</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the receiving team may catch or advance the ball, and the ball may be recovered by the kicking team once it has gone at least ten yards and has touched the ground or has been touched by <b>any</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the receiving team.|$|E
5|$|A Welsh shipbroker, W. J. Orders, {{organised}} {{a collection}} fund {{on the floor}} of the Cardiff Coal Exchange and floated a public testimonial of one shilling. The national response was considerable and within weeks the total was into hundreds of pounds. This drew the Welsh Football Union (WFU) into a confrontation with the IRFB, as rule 2 on professionalism stated that no player was allowed to receive money from his club, or <b>any</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> his club, for services rendered to football. The fund could have been seen as a professional fee to Gould, henceforth making him ineligible to play for his country. The WFU argued that the money raised was not given by the club, but rather an outpouring of thanks from the Welsh public to a national hero.|$|E

5|$|After {{a safety}} is scored, {{the ball is}} put into play by a free kick. The team that was scored upon must kick the ball from their own 20-yard line and can punt, drop kick, or place kick the ball. In {{professional}} play, a kicking tee cannot be used – however, a tee {{can be used in}} high school or college football. Once the ball has been kicked, it can be caught and advanced by <b>any</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the receiving team, and it can be recovered by the kicking team if the ball travels at least 10 yards and bounces at least once or a player of the receiving team touches the ball.|$|E

5|$|Cabaniss {{was born}} on October 14, 1859 in Petersburg, Virginia. He grew up in Central Virginia until he was {{appointed}} to the United States Naval Academy at the age of sixteen years and eight months. He began classes at the academy on June 21, 1876 and was the only member of his class from Virginia. Cabaniss was an average student while at the Naval Academy; he finished 40th in his class of 69 in his second year, earning near-top marks in drawing and mathematics but very low marks in history and French language. He also spent the mandatory two months and eighteen days at sea. Cabaniss had the fewest demerits of <b>any</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> his sophomore class and earned a spot on the academy's summer cruise on the USS Constellation.|$|E

5|$|Captain Cliff Taylor and Acting First Officer John Hutchinson {{had managed}} to safely land their {{aircraft}} which, having lost an engine, was on fire carrying about 22,000 gallons of fuel, in the most testing of circumstances and almost certainly saved 121 lives. Taylor was recommended for an award by BOAC, but following {{the publication of the}} official inquiry report in August 1969, the decision was taken at ministerial level not to recognise <b>any</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the flight crew. Both Taylor and Hutchinson received, along with First Officer Francis Kirkland and Check Captain Geoffrey Moss, but not Flight Engineer Thomas Hicks, commendations from BOAC, and Captain Taylor was awarded the British Airline Pilots Association Gold Medal.|$|E
5|$|Equus is a genus {{of mammals}} {{in the family}} Equidae, which {{includes}} horses, asses, and zebras. Within Equidae, Equus is the only recognized extant genus, comprising seven living species. The term equine refers to <b>any</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> this genus, including horses. Like Equidae more broadly, Equus has numerous extinct species known only from fossils. The genus most likely originated in North America and spread quickly to the Old World. Equines are odd-toed ungulates with slender legs, long heads, relatively long necks, manes (erect in most subspecies) and long tails. All species are herbivorous, and mostly grazers with simpler digestive systems than ruminants but able to subsist on lower quality vegetation.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, {{while the}} Claimant was serving his prison sentence, {{interest}} was briefly {{raised by the}} claims of William Cresswell, an inmate of a Sydney lunatic asylum, that he was Arthur Orton. There was circumstantial evidence that indicated some connection with Orton, and the Claimant's supporters campaigned to have Cresswell brought to England. Nothing came of this, although the question of Cresswell's possible identity remained a matter of dispute for years. In 1884 a Sydney court found the matter undecided, and ruled that the status quo should be maintained; Cresswell stayed in the asylum. Shortly {{before his death in}} 1904 he was visited by the contemporaneous Lady Tichborne, who found no physical resemblance to <b>any</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the Tichborne family.|$|E

5|$|On the May 10 {{episode of}} Raw, Kidd {{defeated}} The Miz in a match, which earned <b>any</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> The Hart Dynasty {{a match for}} the United States Championship, and The Miz, who was allowed to choose his opponent, elected to face Bret Hart. On the following episode of Raw on May 17, Hart defeated The Miz to win the United States Championship, despite Chris Jericho, William Regal, and Vladimir Kozlov attempting to interfere on The Miz's behalf. The Miz had a tumultuous relationship with Bryan, who was eliminated from NXT on May 11, although he returned the following week to attack The Miz.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{has been}} {{described}} as conservative and libertarian. According to University of Georgia political scientist Keith Poole, Paul had the most conservative voting record of <b>any</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> Congress from 1937 to 2002, and is the most conservative of the candidates that had sought the 2012 Republican nomination for president, on a scale primarily measuring positions on the role of government in managing the economy– not positions on social issues or foreign policy matters. Other analyses, in which key votes on domestic social issues and foreign policy factor more heavily, have judged Paul much more moderate. The National Journal, for instance, rated Paul only the 145th most conservative member of the House of Representatives (out of 435) based on votes cast in 2010.|$|E
5|$|The {{captain and}} most of the crew of the shipall {{nationals}} of the Philippineshad to face a U.S. Coast Guard Board of Inquiry, which required them to remain in the United States for several weeks after the wreck. In addition, a federal grand jury investigated the incident for criminal wrongdoing. Captain Morgado refused to answer many of the questions posed at the inquiry, citing his Fifth Amendment rights. The crew was released after their testimony and returned to the Philippines. On September 16, the Coast Guard issued its findings that captain's error was the primary cause of the wreck, with the first and third officers of the ship also partly responsible. The investigation found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing, and no charges were filed against <b>any</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the New Carissa crew.|$|E

5|$|The {{cardinals}} then {{attempted to}} elect Vidoni again, but Chigi was now opposed to {{him out of}} anger at the French for excluding d'Elci. The Spanish cardinals also worked against Vidoni, implying {{at one point that}} Mariana of Austria, the Queen regent of Spain, had excluded Vidoni's candidacy. The Spanish then attempted to elect Benedetto Odescalchi, but d'Ailly declared that no one would be allowed to be elected unless they owed loyalty to Louis XIV. The Spanish soon sent word that their cardinals were free to vote for anyone. The letter was brought by courier and announced that Mariana of Austria had not actually excluded Vidoni nor <b>any</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the college.|$|E
5|$|The {{constitution}} of the Order of Canada states that the insignia remain property of the Crown, and requires <b>any</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the order {{to return to the}} chancellery their original emblem should they be upgraded within the order to a higher rank. Thus, while badges may be passed down as family heirlooms, or loaned or donated for display in museums, they cannot be sold by any individual other than the monarch with the proper advice and consent of her ministers. Over the decades, however, a number of Order of Canada insignia have been put up for sale, the first being the Companion's badge of Major Coldwell, who was appointed in 1967; his badge was sold at auction in 1981, an act that received criticism from government officials.|$|E
5|$|The {{king was}} {{reluctant}} to shed blood, and this greatly irritated the ultra-reactionary Chamber of Deputies, who felt that Louis XVIII was not executing enough. The government issued a proclamation of amnesty to the “traitors” in January 1816, but the trials that had already begun were finished in due course. That same declaration also banned <b>any</b> <b>member</b> <b>of</b> the House of Bonaparte from owning property in, or entering, France. It is estimated that between 50,000– 80,000 officials were purged from the government during what {{was known as the}} Second White Terror.|$|E
