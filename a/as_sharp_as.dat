5|$|Brimsek {{decided to}} help the war effort next season by joining the United States Coast Guard. During his time with the Coast Guard, he played with the Coast Guard Cutters hockey team in Curtis Bay, Maryland, and later served in the South Pacific. After the war ended, Brimsek {{returned}} to the Bruins {{in time for the}} 1945–46 season. However, Brimsek was not <b>as</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>as</b> he was before due to having not played any professional hockey for two years. In his first season back, Brimsek guided the Bruins to the Finals, matching up with the Montreal Canadiens. The Bruins were defeated in five games with three games requiring overtime. Brimsek was applauded for his performance in the playoffs, compensating for his team's weak defence. This marked Brimsek's fourth appearance in the Finals and it would be his last. At the end of the season, Brimsek was also named to the NHL Second All-Star Team, the fifth time in his career.|$|E
5|$|Brimsek {{spent his}} first nine NHL seasons with the Bruins and during this time, he {{received}} numerous individual awards. He won the Calder Memorial Trophy, the Vezina Trophy twice, and he {{was named to the}} NHL All-Star Team eight times (twice on the First Team and six times on the Second Team). He was also a member of two Stanley Cup championships (1939 and 1941). During World War II, Brimsek left the NHL for two years in order to serve with the United States Coast Guard skating with the vaunted Coast Guard Cutters which featured fellow Eveleth native John Mariucci. After being discharged from the Coast Guard, Brimsek returned to the NHL for the 1945–46 season where it was noted that his skills were not <b>as</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>as</b> before he left. Despite this, he still managed {{to be one of the}} best goalies in the league. Brimsek was traded to the Black Hawks following the 1948–49 season due to personal reasons. He spent one season with the Black Hawks before retiring from professional hockey.|$|E

25|$|The Stock Market {{crash in}} New York led people to hoard their money; as {{consumption}} fell, the American economy steadily contracted, 1929-32. Given the close economic {{links between the}} two countries, the collapse quickly affected Canada. Added to the woes of the prairies were those of Ontario and Quebec, whose manufacturing industries were now victims of overproduction. Massive lay-offs occurred and other companies collapsed into bankruptcy. This collapse was not <b>as</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>as</b> that in the United States, but was the second sharpest collapse in the world.|$|E
25|$|Through {{the process}} of {{developing}} his art, Al-Zahawi tried various methods of sculpting, yet he vastly preferred the coiling method. The coiling method allows the artists to create irregular forms with superimposed volume and with angles <b>as</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>as</b> 45°, collectively allowing for the construction of very large forms that can reach up to 7 feet high with a diameter as wide as 4 feet. As each inch is built, coil by coil, similar to how one builds a house, the final product becomes a one of a kind form that is rarely repeated, and oftentimes goes far beyond traditional ceramics.|$|E

My left side is always numb, and my brain doesn't feel <b>as</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>as</b> it used to. And it's tough when people don't want to see or know about that. They draw a big X on you, and that's sad. It's like you're forgotten when you're out of the limelight. Nobody owes me anything, but somebody could maybe give me something (work-wise) to keep me involved. I used to make $5,000 for a two-hour appearance. Now, I have a hard time finding a job for anything. I hate to say it, but sometimes I wish God had just taken me.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{response}} to the film has generally been positive. Theron Martin from Anime News Network found Conqueror of Shamballa as a very entertaining film [...] "as it has all of the action, flashy magic, comedy, snappy dialogue, drama, and intrigue that made the TV series so great." [...] The few negative points he found about the plot were lack of discussions of morality which were featured in the anime series and that [...] "the writing and plotting just don't feel <b>as</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>as</b> they were for the series." [...] He praised the additional content from the limited edition DVD {{as well as the}} English dub, but criticized the subtitles for having grammatical mistakes. Although Dani Moure from Mania Entertainment did not find the story to be very original, he still favored it due to its mix of themes, turning it into an entertaining film. He also praised the staff from the series, commenting they have done an [...] "admirable job," [...] making the film a [...] "sequel well worthy of bearing the series' name." [...] Chris Johnston of Newtype USA praised it is as [...] "a perfect way" [...] to conclude the TV series, saying it is [...] "a rousing, action-packed and heartrending close." ...|$|E
500|$|Reagan's {{health and}} {{well-being}} became a prominent concern in 2008. In February, she suffered a fall at her Bel Air home and was taken to Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, California. Doctors reported {{that she did not}} break her hip as feared, and she was released from the hospital two days later. News commentators noted that Reagan's step had slowed significantly, as the following month she walked in very slow strides with John McCain. NBC's Brian Williams, who attended a dinner with Reagan in mid-2008, recalled, [...] "Mrs. Reagan's vision isn't what it always was so she was taking very halting steps as a lot of folks her age do... It is so important for folks in her age bracket and in her bracket of life to remain upright and captain of their own ship. She very much is captain of her own ship." [...] As for her mental ability, Williams remarked, [...] "She's <b>as</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>as</b> ever and enjoys a robust life with her friends in California, but falling is always a danger of course. She's a very stoic, hardy person full of joy and excitement for life... She is not without opinions on politics and political types these days... She is, as most of her friends described her, a pistol." ...|$|E
500|$|Not {{all were}} as impressed. Noting that Kurtzman was financially {{strapped}} before making his living for twenty-six years from Playboy, historian Paul Buhle wrote: [...] "The strip had many brilliant early moments, but went downhill as {{the writer and}} artist bent to editor Hugh Hefner's demands for as much titillation as possible." [...] Cartoonist Art Spiegelman said that Little Annie Fanny devolved from the more interesting Goodman Beaver. Underground cartoonist Robert Crumb, whose career Kurtzman helped launch, scorned Playboy and Annie. Monty Python's Terry Gilliam, the former assistant editor of Help!, said that Little Annie Fanny was not <b>as</b> <b>sharp</b> <b>as</b> Kurtzman's earlier work: [...] "technically brilliant but... slightly compromised." [...] Art agent and publisher Denis Kitchen, who handles Kurtzman and Eisner's estates, said that [...] "most Kurtzman devotees would not consider Little Annie Fanny genius work... some would argue the opposite: that it was genius diluted or degraded". Kitchen placed the onus on Kurtzman's employer Hefner, who [...] "was often a punctilious taskmaster with a heavy red pen who often had very different ideas about what was funny or satiric" [...] and insisted that each strip [...] "had to include Annie disrobing". Beauchamp agreed: [...] "Unfortunately, Hefner was notorious for his heavy editorial hand." [...] Duncan and Smith also agreed, and wrote that [...] "humor sometimes mixes awkwardly with the loaded topics of the era, and some have found Annie's lack of character development and the requisite sexual hijinks an impediment to taking her seriously." [...] However, they repeated their respect: [...] "The eternally innocent Annie performed admirably as a nonjudgmental witness to the changing tides of the sexual revolution." ...|$|E
