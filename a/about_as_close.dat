500|$|On {{its next}} album, In My Own Dream, {{released}} in 1968, the band continued {{to move away}} from its roots in Chicago blues towards a more soul-influenced, horn-based sound. With Butterfield singing only three songs, the album featured more band contributions. It reached number 79 in the Billboard album chart. By the end of 1968, both Bishop and Naftalin had left the band. In April 1969, Butterfield took part in a concert at Chicago's Auditorium Theater and a subsequent recording session organized by record producer Norman Dayron, featuring Muddy Waters backed by Otis Spann, Mike Bloomfield, Sam Lay, Donald [...] "Duck" [...] Dunn, and Buddy Miles. Such Waters warhorses as [...] "Forty Days and Forty Nights", [...] "I'm Ready", [...] "Baby, Please Don't Go", and [...] "Got My Mojo Working" [...] were recorded and later released on the album Fathers and Sons.

500|$|Production {{began in}} February 2007 in South Africa, where the {{majority}} of filming took place. South Africa was chosen as a primary filming location for economic reasons, costing a third of estimated production in the United Kingdom. Shooting in South Africa lasted 56 days out of 66 days, with the remaining ten taking place in Scotland. Marshall said of South Africa's appeal, [...] "The landscape, the rock formations, I thought it was <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> to Scotland as you're likely to get, outside of Ireland or Wales." [...] In Scotland, secondary filming took place in the city of Glasgow, including Haghill in the city's East End, and at Blackness Castle in West Lothian, the latter chosen when filmmakers were unable to shoot at Doune Castle. The entire shoot, involving thousands of extras, included a series of complex fight scenes and pyrotechnical displays. The director sought to minimise the use of computer-generated elements in Doomsday, preferring to subscribe to [...] "old-school filmmaking". In the course of production, several sequences were dropped due to budgetary concerns, including a scene in which helicopter gunships attacked a medieval castle.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSuperfinishing {{machining}} has {{a particular}} impact on cutting mechanics, surface integrity and local electrochemical behavior. In fact, material removal during this process induces geometrical, mechanical and micro-structural modifications in the machined surface and sub-surface. However, a conventional 3 D cutting process is still complex to study in terms of analytical/numerical modeling and experimental process monitoring. So, researchers are wondering if a less intricate configuration such as orthogonal cutting {{would be able to}} provide information <b>about</b> surface integrity <b>as</b> <b>close</b> <b>as</b> possible to that one generated by a 3 D cutting process. For that reason, in the present paper, two different machining configurations werecompared: face turning and orthogonal cutting. The work material is oxygen free high conductivity copper (OFHC) and the cutting tools are uncoated cemented carbide. The research work was performed in three steps. In the first step, the process mechanics of superfinishing machining of OFHC copper was performed. In the second step, the surface integrity and the chemical behavior of the machined samples were analyzed. Finally, in the third step, correlations between input parameters and output measures wereconducted using statistical techniques. Results show that when applying low ratios between the uncut chip thickness and the cutting edge radius,thesurface integrity and cutting energy are highly affected by the ploughing phenomenon. Otherwise, the most relevant cutting parameter is the feed. In order to compare face turning with orthogonal cutting, a new geometrical parameter was introduced, which has a strong effect in the electrochemical behavior of the machined surface...|$|R
500|$|Musically, the remix {{does not}} greatly differ {{from that of}} the {{original}} apart from a new second verse by Ne-Yo. Digital Spy's Robert Copsey praised the track.

He complimented Carey's [...] "classy" [...] and [...] "effortless" [...] vocals, and added that Ne-Yo gave the track an emotional [...] "extra dimension". Copsey likened the song to one of Carey's previous singles, [...] "We Belong Together" [...] (2005): [...] "It's a bit of a 'We Belong Together' retread, but it's a thoroughly pleasant 'We Belong Together' retread". Leonie Cooper of The Guardian gave a mixed review of the remix. Although she did not express her dislike for the track, she felt that it was too similar to Carey previous material, writing that it is middle-of-the road [...] "inoffensive semi-soul fodder we've had to come to expect from her." [...] Cooper was, however, critical of the decision to include Ne-Yo and that his addition makes the song even more bland. Robbie Daw of Idolator also felt that the track was a [...] "typically Mariah-esque ballad".|$|E

2500|$|Earl Scruggs did not invent three-finger banjo playing; in fact, he {{said the}} three-finger style {{was the most common}} way to play the five-string banjo in his {{hometown}} in western North Carolina. An early influence was a local banjoist, DeWitt [...] "Snuffy" [...] Jenkins, who plucked in a finger style. According to banjoist and historian Tony Trischka, [...] "Jenkins came <b>about</b> <b>as</b> <b>close</b> as one could to Scruggs style without actually playing it". At age ten, when Scruggs first learned the technique, he recalled that he was at home in his room after a quarrel with his brother. He was idly playing a song called [...] "Reuben" [...] and suddenly realized that he was playing with three fingers, not two. [...] "That excited me to no end", he later recalled, and said he ran through the house repeatedly yelling [...] "I've got it". From there he devoted all his free time to perfecting his timing and to adding syncopation and variations to it. Controversy exists as to the actual origin of three-finger picking style. Don Reno, an eminent banjo player who also played this style and who knew Scruggs at that young age, described Scruggs' early playing as similar to that of Snuffy Jenkins. Scruggs, however, consistently referred to it as his own, saying that he adapted to it [...] "a syncopated roll that was quite different." [...] On the subject, John Hartford said, [...] "Here's the way I feel about it. Everybody's all worried about who invented the style and it's obvious that three finger banjo pickers have been around a long time— maybe since 1840. But it's my feeling that if it wasn't for Earl Scruggs, you wouldn't be worried about who invented it." ...|$|E
