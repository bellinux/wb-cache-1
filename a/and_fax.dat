25|$|Al-Arian's five-month, 13-day {{trial began}} with frenzied {{attention}} from national media outlets. The prosecution's case was built largely on FBI wiretaps <b>and</b> <b>fax</b> transmissions gathered between 1994 {{and the time}} of Mr. Al-Arian's arrest in 2003. The surveillance included roughly 20,000 hours of dialogue from 472,000 wiretapped telephone conversations on 18 tapped lines gathered from 1994 to 2003. While such wiretaps taken by the intelligence arm of the FBI are usually kept secret from federal criminal investigators, provisions in the Patriot Act and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act allow their use in certain trials dealing with terrorism. At the end of the prosecution's case, Al-Arian's lawyers chose not to present any witnesses in his defense and rested without offering a defense, hoping to leave the burden of proof squarely on the government's shoulders. The trial concluded in November 2005. After 13 days of deliberations, the jury acquitted Al-Arian in December on 8 of 17 counts and deadlocked on the remaining nine. Two co-defendants were acquitted of all charges and another co-defendant was also acquitted on majority of his charges. The verdict was seen as a major embarrassment to the government's prosecution and to the Patriot Act.|$|E
500|$|The company's origins date to 1982 (or 1983, sources differ), {{when three}} Israelis, {{aspiring}} investment banker Jacob [...] "Kobi" [...] Alexander of Shearson Loeb Rhoades, engineer Boaz Misholi, and Alexander brother-in-law and Columbia University computer science professor Yechiam Yemini, {{got together and}} founded an Israeli start-up company, Efrat Future Technologies Ltd. [...] In a meeting in New York, Misholi had the idea of building a business around centralized hardware systems to support voice <b>and</b> <b>fax</b> messaging and selling them to telecommunications companies and other large enterprises, who could then resell the voice <b>and</b> <b>fax</b> services to their customers. [...] The three quickly returned to Israel and started the company, {{with the goal of}} securing Israeli government grants to fund the research and development work.|$|E
500|$|Under his lead, Alexander was {{credited}} with turning around Comverse's fortunes. [...] In 1989, the Ascom Group made a $6 million direct investment in the company. [...] In 1990, Comverse won a potentially $10 million contract, its largest yet, to deliver computers running voicemail <b>and</b> <b>fax</b> applications on West German cellular networks, beating out far larger corporations in the process. [...] Deutsche Telekom {{became one of the}} company's biggest early customers. [...] By 1991, the company had annual sales of $17 million and was selling a combined voice <b>and</b> <b>fax</b> mailbox system. [...] Many of its early successes came from avoiding the huge telecommunications companies in the U.S. and instead focusing on selling to small- and medium-sized companies in the wireless market in Europe. The company also sought a variety of other markets, including developing countries such as Mexico and China for its Trilogue virtual telephone service. [...] Gradually its product emphasis shifted more from hardware to software.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{features}} guest appearances by {{the members}} of the band Kiss—Peter Criss, Ace Frehley, Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley—who each portray both themselves and a small cameo role. However, the band members insisted during filming that their roles be given an equal amount of dialogue, which led to Perry being asked to amend scenes on short notice <b>and</b> <b>fax</b> updated scripts to the shooting locations; ultimately much of this additional material was filmed but not used in the episode. Ace Frehley was also unenthusiastic towards his role, and requested to play a [...] "300-pound black man" [...] instead, wishing to wear a fat suit like those used in the 1996 Eddie Murphy film The Nutty Professor; he was eventually convinced that such a suit would take too long to fabricate.|$|E
500|$|In {{the light}} of the {{physical}} demands of performing in theatre Paige has said [...] "Musical theatre is the hardest thing any actor will ever do. [...] You become obsessive about sleeping, eating the right food, not speaking and giving yourself vocal rest and keeping exercised". Regarding the pressure of having to be in a fit condition to perform in theatre each night, she remarked [...] "you wouldn't want to read the letters people write when you're off and they're disappointed – it's so awful, the guilt one feels for not being there". As part of a rigorous routine before musical roles to look after her voice, Paige stops eating dairy products and drinking alcohol and works hard on her fitness. After about three months into the production when her voice is tiring from performing, she withdraws from her normal social life, sometimes only communicating by notepad <b>and</b> <b>fax.</b> She never reads her reviews, finding that it is not helpful to hear too many opinions of her work.|$|E
500|$|Founded in 1982, {{the company}} went public on the Nasdaq Stock Market in 1986. [...] Led by co-founder and CEO Jacob [...] "Kobi" [...] Alexander, the company {{originally}} specialized in centralized hardware/software systems for voice <b>and</b> <b>fax</b> messaging and sold them to telecommunications companies and other large enterprises. [...] Much of its funding came from Israeli government subsidies and tax credits provided to research and development for hi-tech firms. [...] By the mid-1990s, {{one of its most}} successful products allowed legal authorities and intelligence agencies to record and store data collected from intercepted communications. [...] Starting in the late 1990s, Comverse's voice messaging software became its main product and the company grew rapidly with the surge in mobile phone use, passing the $1 billion mark in revenues. [...] It established a formidable position in the worldwide mobile voicemail management market and sold a popular short message service center (SMSC) product. [...] While headquartered in the US, most of the company's research and development was done in Israel; Comverse became one of the more visible success stories in Israel's hi-tech industry. [...] It was one of Israel's largest employers of software engineers, was closely followed in the nation's business press, and was the first Israeli-associated company to join the S 500 index.|$|E
