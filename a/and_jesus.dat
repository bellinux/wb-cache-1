5|$|The domes {{are often}} brightly painted: their colors may informally symbolise {{different}} aspects of religion. Green, blue, and gold domes are sometimes held to represent the Holy Trinity, the Holy Spirit, <b>and</b> <b>Jesus,</b> respectively. Black ball-shaped domes were once popular in the snowy north of Russia.|$|E

5|$|As he lies dying {{under the}} abbey's rubble, Zerchi is startled to {{encounter}} Mrs Grales/Rachel, a bicephalous tomato peddler and mutant. However, Mrs. Grales has been rendered unconscious by the explosion, {{and may be}} dying herself. As Zerchi tries to conditionally baptize Rachel, she refuses, and instead takes the ciborium and administers the Eucharist to him. It is implied that she is, like the Virgin Mary, Eve <b>and</b> <b>Jesus,</b> exempt from original sin, and may even be the Second Coming of Christ to begin a new cycle on Earth. Zerchi soon dies, having witnessed an apparent miracle.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Jahangir first {{mentions}} his alterations to {{the fort}} in 1612 when describing the Maktab Khana. Jahangir also added the Kala Burj pavilion, which features European-inspired angels on its vaulted ceiling.

In 1606, Guru Arjan of the Sikh faith was imprisoned at the fort before his death.|$|E

5|$|In John (18:1–11), Jesus {{does not}} pray to be spared his crucifixion, as the gospel portrays him as {{scarcely}} touched by such human weakness. The people who arrest him are Roman soldiers and Temple guards. Instead of being betrayed by a kiss, Jesus proclaims his identity, {{and when he}} does, the soldiers and officers fall to the ground. The gospel identifies Peter as the disciple who used the sword, <b>and</b> <b>Jesus</b> rebukes him for it.|$|E

5|$|Some {{authors have}} dealt with {{comparative}} studies between Taoism and Christianity. This has been of interest for students of history of religion such as J.J.M. de Groot, among others. The comparison of the teachings of Laozi <b>and</b> <b>Jesus</b> of Nazareth {{has been done by}} several authors such as Martin Aronson, and Toropov & Hansen (2002), who believe that they have parallels that should not be ignored. In the opinion of J. Isamu Yamamoto the main difference is that Christianity preaches a personal God while Taoism does not. Yet, a number of authors, including Lin Yutang, have argued that some moral and ethical tenets of these religions are similar.|$|E

5|$|The nondenominational St Tugual's Chapel {{dates to}} the 11th century, but it is {{believed}} that there was a place of worship on Herm {{as far back as the}} 6th century, although it hasn't been confirmed whether the chapel was founded by St Tugual himself or his followers at a later date. The current building is Norman and appears to have been a monastery during medieval times. Of particular note is its stained glass windows featuring Noah's Ark and Guernsey cows <b>and</b> <b>Jesus</b> talking to the fisherman at Herm harbour. In 2010 and 2011, the chapel was closed for restoration work.|$|E

5|$|Bach, the Thomaskantor in Leipzig from May 1723, {{composed}} this cantata {{to complete}} his second cantata cycle of chorale cantatas, begun in 1724. He used the lyrics of the hymn unchanged, which reflect the psalm <b>and</b> <b>Jesus</b> as the Good Shepherd. Bach structured the work in five movements. The outer choral movements are a chorale fantasia and a four-part closing chorale, both on the hymn tune. Bach set the inner stanzas as aria – recitative – aria, with music unrelated to the hymn tune. He scored the cantata for four vocal soloists, a four-part choir and a Baroque instrumental ensemble of two horns, two oboes d'amore, strings and continuo. Bach scholars agree that the brass instruments, normally reserved for Feast days, could come from an earlier chorale fantasia of the same melody with {{the text of the}} German Gloria.|$|E
5|$|Born at Great Yarmouth on 9 April 1871, Thomas was {{the third}} son of Major Frank Astley Cubitt and his wife Bertha, {{daughter}} of Captain Thomas Blakiston of the Royal Navy. The family resided at Thorpe Hall in Norwich, with an estate at Fritton, near Great Yarmouth. Major Cubitt came {{from a family of}} rural gentry, and had attended Rugby <b>and</b> <b>Jesus</b> College, Cambridge before entering the British Army in 1853 as an ensign in the 5th Regiment of Foot. He saw service in the Indian Mutiny before returning to England to act as adjutant to volunteer battalions of the Norfolk Regiment, and retired from the Army in 1889. He later served as a Justice of the Peace and chair of the local district council.|$|E
5|$|In Ryne Sandberg's {{first full}} season as manager (after {{replacing}} Charlie Manuel {{near the end}} of the 2013 season), he reconfigured the Phillies' staff. Among his first acquisitions were long-time friend Larry Bowa (who managed the Phillies from 2001 to 2004) as bench coach and former bench coach Pete Mackanin as third-base coach. At the same time, the team announced the retention of Steve Henderson as hitting coach. Shortly thereafter, the Phillies announced that Juan Samuel would switch from third- to first-base coach and Wally Joyner would return for a second season as assistant hitting coach. About a month later, the team reported that the Detroit Tigers had lured Joyner away as their hitting coach. Although the most difficult position to fill was pitching coach (vacated by Rich Dubee at the end of the 2013 season), on November 21 the Phillies announced that they had hired Bob McClure and retained pitching-coach candidate Rod Nichols as bullpen coach <b>and</b> <b>Jesús</b> Tiamo as bullpen catcher. Sandberg finished his staffing a week before Christmas by promoting minor-league assistant John Mizerock to assistant hitting coach.|$|E

5|$|The Chapel of St Michael and All Angels and the Lady Chapel are at {{the east}} end of the outer north and south aisles respectively, and contain 20 of the 28 stone heads carved by Thomas Earp of Lambeth in 1878–1880, mostly {{depicting}} biblical characters such as Salome and John the Baptist, or historical figures like St Helen and Martin Luther. Ten are paired {{on opposite sides of the}} five pillars defining the inner edge of the Lady Chapel aisle, and another ten are similarly arranged in the Chapel of St Michael and All Angels. The corbels of the north, west and south doors bear six more heads, those by the west door depicting Queen Victoria and Archbishop Tait; <b>and</b> <b>Jesus</b> and Moses are higher on the corbels of the west window. The clerestory and the wooden roofs of the nave and south inner aisle are 15th century, but the rest of the lead-clad roofing dates from the Victorian rebuilding.|$|E
5|$|After {{the second}} chorus, in a climatic sequence, the singer holds a gun up to Judas' mouth, and {{a stick of}} red {{lipstick}} bursts out and smears his lips. The scene portrays Gaga's choice to refuse to shoot Judas through the heart. As the breakdown ends, the music stops and Gaga is seen in a bathtub with Jesus and Judas, washing their feet and cleaning it with her hair. The sequence is interspersed with Gaga standing lonely on a rock as waves engulf her, the scene being reminiscent of artist Sandro Botticelli's The Birth of Venus <b>and</b> <b>Jesus</b> marching towards his fatal destiny. The music restarts and Judas is shown pouring beer in the bathtub. Next Jesus is shown standing on a stage, surrounded by his supporters, the setting being inspired by scaffoldings present around newly constructed buildings in New York. Gaga kneels in front of Jesus and tries to explain something to him, but he places his palm on her head as Judas looks on. After Judas delivers the fateful kiss upon Jesus' cheeks, marking him for his death, Gaga falls {{on the ground with}} a silent, anguished cry. The video ends with the death of neither Judas nor Jesus, but of Gaga as she's stoned to death by the crowd.|$|E
