The band used a number of less common instruments to achieve this sound; in addition to the orchestra and choir, Neon Bible features a hurdy-gurdy, mandolin, accordion and pipe organ. Win Butler has said that in conceiving the album he hoped for a more stripped-down sound but the songs demanded further instrumentation.|$|E
5|$|Damage to the airways {{can cause}} {{subcutaneous}} emphysema (air {{trapped in the}} subcutaneous tissue of the skin) in the abdomen, chest, neck, and head. Subcutaneous emphysema, present in up to 85% of people with TBI, is particularly indicative of the injury when {{it is only in}} the neck. Air is trapped in the chest cavity outside the lungs (pneumothorax) in about 70% of TBI. Especially strong evidence that TBI has occurred is failure of a pneumothorax to resolve even when a chest tube is placed to rid the chest cavity of the air; it shows that air is continually leaking into the chest cavity from the site of the tear. Air can also be trapped in the mediastinum, the center of the chest cavity (pneumomediastinum). If air escapes from a penetrating injury to the neck, a definite diagnosis of TBI can be made. Hamman's sign, <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> crackling that occurs in time with the heartbeat, may also accompany TBI.|$|E

On June 10, 1967, 17 days after completing what was his last film role in Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, Tracy awakened at 3:00am to make himself a cup of tea in his apartment in Beverly Hills, California. Hepburn described in her autobiography how she followed him to the kitchen: [...] "Just as I was about to give [...] a push, there was <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> a cup smashing to the floor—then clump—a loud clump." [...] She entered the room to find Tracy lying dead from a heart attack. He was 67. Hepburn recalled, [...] "He looked so happy to be done with living, which for all his accomplishments had been a frightful burden for him."

The single opens with the lyrics, [...] "Take a breath/ Take it deep/ Calm yourself/ He says to me/ If you play/ You play for keeps/ Take the gun/ And count to three." [...] The metaphor about the game of Russian roulette is also present in the chorus in which Rihanna sings, [...] "And you can see my heart beating/ You can see it through my chest/ I said I'm terrified, but I'm not leaving/ I know that I must pass this test/ So just pull the trigger." [...] In the upcoming verse, the character that the singer portrays in the song it's scared that the man talking to her will always have a power over, [...] "Say a prayer to yourself/ He says close your eyes/ Sometimes it helps/ And then I get a scary thought/ That he's here means he's never lost." [...] "Russian Roulette" [...] ends with <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> a gun shot, which according to Michaelangelo Matos of The A.V.

2500|$|This {{impressive}} {{instrument is}} perhaps the summit of Cavaillé-Coll's craftmanship and genius. The sound and musical effects achieved in this instrument are almost unparalleled.

Albert Schweitzer, his student and collaborator—despite initiating an [...] "Orgelbewegung," [...] or organ reform movement, which deplored many nineteenth-century developments—called this organ the most beautiful in the world. [...] More recently, Stephen Bicknell concurred, pointing out that the full ensemble of many large organs is dominated by a few powerful stops; but at S. Sulpice many ranks, each of moderate power, contribute to <b>a</b> <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> dazzling complexity. With five manuals— keyboards— and boasting two 32-foot stops, organists at St. Sulpice have an incredibly rich palette of sounds at their disposal.|$|E
