5|$|The most basal of {{the living}} teleosts are the Elopomorpha (eels <b>and</b> <b>allies)</b> and the Osteoglossomorpha (elephantfishes <b>and</b> <b>allies).</b> There are 800 species of elopomorphs. They have thin leaf-shaped larvae known as leptocephali, {{specialised}} for a marine environment. Among the elopomorphs, eels have elongated bodies with lost pelvic girdles and ribs and fused elements in the upper jaw. The 200 species of osteoglossomorphs are defined by a bony element in the tongue. This element has a basibranchial behind it, and both structures have large teeth which are paired with the teeth on the parasphenoid in {{the roof of the}} mouth. The clade Otocephala includes the Clupeiformes (herrings) and Ostariophysi (carps, catfishes <b>and</b> <b>allies).</b> Clupeiformes consist of 350 living species of herring and herring-like fishes. This group is characterised by an unusual abdominal scute and a different arrangement of the hypurals. In most species, the swim bladder extends to the braincase and plays a role in hearing. Ostariophysi, which includes most freshwater fishes, have developed some unique adaptations. One is the Weberian apparatus, an arrangement of bones (Weberian ossicles) connecting the swim bladder to the inner ear. This enhances their hearing, as sound waves make the bladder vibrate, and the bones transport the vibrations to the inner ear. They also have a chemical alarm system; when a fish is injured, the warning substance gets in the water, alarming nearby fish.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the end of}} Melissenos's revolt, it left a {{profound}} legacy: although Melissenos himself submitted to Alexios Komnenos, the towns he had occupied and garrisoned with Turkish soldiers in Ionia, Phrygia, Galatia, and Bithynia remained in their hands. Thus, by becoming involved in the Byzantine civil wars as mercenaries <b>and</b> <b>allies</b> – especially through their use by Botaneiates and Melissenos during their respective revolts to hold down various cities for them – the Turks completed their relatively peaceful take-over of central and western Asia Minor.|$|E

5|$|Karađorđe was feared by enemies <b>and</b> <b>allies</b> alike {{because of}} his {{volatile}} temper. In 1806, he had ordered that his brother Marinko be hanged.

Whatever the case, Karađorđe entertained senior rebel leaders in his home while his brother's lifeless body dangled from the front gate—a warning to others to refrain from the behaviour in which Marinko had been engaging.|$|E

5|$|Like other fairywrens, the red-backed fairywren is {{unrelated}} to the true wren (family Troglodytidae). It was previously classified {{as a member of}} the old world flycatcher family Muscicapidae and later {{as a member of the}} warbler family Sylviidae before being placed in the newly recognised fairywren family Maluridae in 1975. More recently, DNA analysis has shown that the Maluridae family is related to the Meliphagidae (honeyeaters), and the Pardalotidae (pardalotes, scrubwrens, thornbills, gerygones <b>and</b> <b>allies)</b> in the large superfamily Meliphagoidea.|$|E
5|$|Manuel {{was very}} {{successful}} in expanding his influence, particularly over the Crusader states. As an example, he participated in the building and decorating {{of many of the}} basilicas and Greek monasteries in the Holy Land, including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem where due to his efforts the Byzantine clergy were allowed to perform the Greek liturgy each day. All this reinforced his position as overlord of the Crusader states, with his hegemony over Antioch and Jerusalem secured by agreement with Raynald, Prince of Antioch, and Amalric, King of Jerusalem. This success in gaining influence <b>and</b> <b>allies</b> among the western states and the Pope is regarded one of the most impressive achievements of Manuel Komnenos's reign.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Wisconsin Heights was the {{penultimate}} {{engagement of}} the 1832 Black Hawk War, fought between the United States state militia <b>and</b> <b>allies,</b> and the Sauk and Fox tribes, led by Black Hawk.

Despite being vastly outnumbered and sustaining heavy casualties, Black Hawk's warriors managed to delay the combined government forces long enough to allow the majority of the Sauk and Fox civilians in the group to escape across the Wisconsin River. This reprieve was temporary; when the militia finally caught up with the fleeing band it resulted in the Bad Axe massacre {{at the mouth of the}} Bad Axe River.|$|E
