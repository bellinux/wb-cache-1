This Douay MS is said by the <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Preface</b> to be the [...] "oldest and most perfect" [...] copy of the Vestiarium. Having once been in the possession of Bishop Ross, it had found its way subsequently into the library of the Scots College at Douay.

Scholars also regard him as the <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>preface</b> to another legal code, the 1652 Îndreptarea Legii. The latter text abounds in references to classical lawmakers, from Lycurgus of Sparta and Hippocrates to Justinian I and Leo the Wise. With his activity in the field, he aimed especially at countering the influence of Calvinism, publishing in 1642, and again in 1644, a propaganda booklet called The Learning Gospel.

6000|$|It may {{be worth}} noting that Chapman's first {{instalment}} of his translation of the Iliad, containing Books I, II, and VII-XI, appeared in 1598, and thence the author could adapt the passages from Iliad, Book VII. In or about 1598-9 occurred, in Histriomastix, by Marston and others, a burlesque speech in which Troilus, addressing Cressida, speaks of [...] "thy knight," [...] who [...] "SHAKES his furious SPEARE," [...] while in April 1599, Henslowe's account-book contains entries of money paid to Dekker and Chettle for a play on Troilus and Cressida, for the Earl of Nottingham's Company. {297a} Of this play no more is known, nor can we be sure that Chapman's seven Books of the Iliad (I, II, VII-XI) of 1598 {{attracted the attention of}} playwrights, from Shakespeare to Chettle and Dekker, to Trojan affairs. The coincidences at least are curious. If [...] "SHAKES his furious SPEARE" [...] in Histriomastix refers to Shakespeare in connection with Cressida, while, in 1599, Dekker and Chettle were doing a Troilus and Cressida for a company not Shakespeare's, then there were TWO Troilus and Cressida in the field. A licence to print a Troilus and Cressida was obtained in 1602-3, but the quarto of our play, the Shakespearean play, is of 1609, [...] "as it is acted by my Lord Chamberlain's men," [...] that is, by Shakespeare's Company. Now Dekker and Chettle wrote, apparently, for Lord Nottingham's Company. One quarto of 1609 declares, in a Preface, that the play has [...] "never been staled with the stage"; another edition of the same year, from the same publishers, has not the Preface, but declares that the piece [...] "was acted by the King's Majesty's servants AT THE GLOBE." [...] {298a} The <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Preface</b> (Ben Jonson, Mr. Greenwood thinks, {298b}) speaks only of a single author, who has written other admirable comedies. [...] "When he is gone, and his comedies out of sale, you will scramble for them, and set up a new English Inquisition." [...] Why? The whole affair is a puzzle. But if the <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Preface</b> is right about the single author of Troilus and Cressida, and if Shakespeare is alluded to in connection with Cressida, in Histriomastix (1599), then it appears to me that Shakespeare, in 1598-9, after Chapman's portion of the Iliad appeared, was author of one Troilus and Cressida, extant in 1602-3 (when its publication was barred till the publisher [...] "got authority"), while Chettle and Dekker, in April 1599, were busy with another Troilus and Cressida, as why should they not be? In an age so lax about copyright, if their play was of their own original making, are we to suppose that there was copyright in the names of the leading persons of the piece, Troilus and Cressida? ...|$|E

A long life was before him, which he proceeded to spend in characteristic fashion, finely and honourably as scholar, author, and reformer, but with little self-regard or self-respect as a private citizen. He was married no less than four times, and not one of these alliances was altogether satisfactory or creditable. Determined [...] "to warm both hands before the fire of life," [...] he was prone to ignore the prejudices and even the decencies of his fellow-citizens, now incurring their displeasure, and now again, as one who had greatly testified for truth and freedom, being taken back into favour and forgiven. There was a deal of human nature in Bonivard, with the result that, at times, conduct fell short of pretension and principle. Estimates of his character differ widely.

40|$|In her survey <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book printed as an edition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Complete Works <b>of</b> Marko Marulić, <b>the</b> <b>author</b> {{informs the}} reader that the Pisni razlike (Various Poems) {{contains}} all Marulić‚s Croatian verses for which his authorship has been proved, with exception <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poem Judita (printed as a separate volume) and his dialogic and dramatic verse, which will be accommodated in another volume <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same series. The present edition, edited by professor Josip Vončina, sticks to the oldest extant manuscript. In his work, the editor proceeds with great scrupulosity, checking every single attribution of his predecessors. Also, he never relies on linguistic and stylistic features <b>of</b> <b>the</b> allegedly authentic works <b>of</b> <b>the</b> poet, but only on Marulić‚s own annotations in, or accompanying, the text, in which the poet openly states his authorship. In this way he establishes a reliable canon of Marulić‚s Croatian poems. In his preface professor J. Vončina sets forth his methodological principles and explains the reasons for his choice in every single case. <b>The</b> <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other <b>preface</b> to <b>the</b> same book is Tonko Maroević, who points out the literary-historical and cultural significance of Marulić‚s Croatian poems. <b>The</b> complete vocabulary <b>of</b> Marulić‚s texts in the book was compiled by Milan Moguš. <b>The</b> <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> survey points to the prevalently medieval character of Marulić‚s verse, drawing the conclusion that <b>the</b> <b>author</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present poems is hardly Marulić {{we know from the}} Judita. Yet, this should not be seen as a drawback.
