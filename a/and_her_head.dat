5|$|The survivors' vehicle {{suffers a}} blowout, {{prompting}} them to swerve onto a farm. The {{back of the}} car is penetrated by PVC pipes which injure Eugene, and he is rushed to the hospital. As rescuers arrive at the scene, Brian Gibbons, the son of a farm owner, is nearly killed by a speeding news van, but Rory saves him. Using the Jaws of Life Kat's rescuer accidentally activates the airbag <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> is impaled by a pipe protruding from her headrest. Her cigarette falls out of her hand and into a gasoline leak leading to the news van, causing the van to explode, and sending a barbed wire fence flying through the air, which kills Rory.|$|E
25|$|The woman’s head {{is large}} in scale, {{with a broad}} face and wide cheeks. She has a long {{straight}} neck, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> is slightly turned to the left side, creating a three-quarters portrait.|$|E
25|$|The lid was a {{hammered}} bronze sheet, weighing 13.8kg {{and shaped}} {{to fit the}} krater's opening. It is concave and perforated by multiple holes, probably because it {{also served as a}} strainer for purifying wine. A protrusion at its centre supports a 19cm statuette of moulded bronze, depicting a woman with one outstretched arm, which once may have held some object. She wears a peplos, the body-length Ancient Greek garment worn by women, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> is covered by a veil. The statuette appears of a somewhat older style than figures {{on the rest of the}} vessel.|$|E
60|$|Phyllis {{went up to}} Claude, <b>and</b> laid <b>her</b> <b>head</b> on his arm; Mr. Hawkesworth {{held out}} his hand to her, but she did not look up, and Claude {{withdrawing}} his arm, <b>and</b> raising <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> found that she was crying. Eleanor and Lilias both rose, <b>and</b> came towards <b>her</b> but Claude made them a sign, <b>and</b> led <b>her</b> away.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} season Arsenal won {{a domestic}} treble. Ball scored in every {{round of the}} WFA Cup, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>headed</b> goal in the 3-0 final win over Doncaster Belles was the 38th of a prolific campaign.|$|R

25|$|In October 2004, Sarah Forsyth {{claimed that}} she had been {{dismissed}} unfairly by Eton College and had been bullied by senior staff. She also claimed she was instructed to do some of Prince Harry's coursework to enable him to pass AS Art. As evidence, Forsyth provided secretly recorded conversations with both Prince Harry <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>Head</b> of Department, Ian Burke. An employment tribunal in July 2005 found {{that she had}} been unfairly dismissed and criticised Burke for bullying her and for repeatedly changing his story. It also criticised the school for failing to produce its capability procedures and criticised the Head Master for not reviewing the case independently.|$|E
25|$|Perisho's partially-clothed {{body was}} found on July 16, 1989, near the North Pine Channel Bridge at Big Pine Key, where Perisho, who was homeless, lived on a dinghy. Perisho's throat had been slashed <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> had been nearly severed; like Jones, her body was {{extensively}} mutilated and her heart was removed. Perisho was found less than 1,000 feet from where Brandt lived, and Brandt's appearance matched a composite sketch of a man seen crossing U.S. Route 1 near where Perisho was discovered on the night she was murdered. Based on this evidence, Monroe County investigators determined that Brandt killed Perisho and officially closed the case on May 6, 2006.|$|E
25|$|The statue {{was kept}} in hiding for five years. During that period, her guardians had her {{carefully}} restored by the Polich Tallix art foundry in New Windsor, New York. Over the years the statue's hand had been broken off, her foot was sheared off at the ankle, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> remained only precariously attached by brackets. The students contacted Bruce Becker, who had stolen Sabrina in 1984 and had since procured a mold of the statue. The foundry used that mold to reconstruct the statue's hand and foot, which were then reattached. The statue's cracked neck was reinforced with fiberglass and epoxy. The guardians also commissioned a wheeled base for Sabrina to aid in her transportation and display.|$|E
60|$|She ceased talking, <b>and,</b> nodding <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> went on stitching.|$|R
60|$|She gripped <b>her</b> ear-trumpet resolutely, <b>and</b> held {{it before}} <b>her</b> <b>and</b> shook <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|R

25|$|On {{the door}} being opened it knocked against a table which {{was close to}} the {{left-hand}} side of the bedstead, and the bedstead was close against the wooden partition. The mutilated remains of a woman were lying two-thirds over, towards the edge of the bedstead, nearest the door. Deceased had only an under-linen garment upon her, and by subsequent examination I am sure the body had been removed, after the injury which caused death, from that side of the bedstead which was nearest to the wooden partition previously mentioned. The large quantity of blood under the bedstead, the saturated condition of the palliasse, pillow, and sheet at the top corner of the bedstead nearest to the partition leads me {{to the conclusion that the}} severance of the right carotid artery, which was the immediate cause of death, was inflicted while the deceased was lying at the right side of the bedstead <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and neck in the top right-hand corner".|$|E
25|$|She {{was called}} up to the 2017 FIVB World Grand Prix and her {{national}} team finished the first round in the Netherlands with a 2-1 mark, But in {{the way to the}} second leg in Russia, making a stop in Warsaw, their LOT Polish Airlines fligth check found Marianne Fersola, Niverka Marte and Castillo's passports full and could not be stamped anywhere refusing to board them and the whole team decided stay together. After finally arriving to Russia, the team was overall ranked eight after losing two matches from three played in the second round and Castillo was among the All-Star team from that Russian leg and was leading the WGP Group 1 digs with 3.64 digs per set. The Russian police raided the Dominican team hotel suspecting involvement in white-slave traffic from Latin-American to Russia and Castillo was jailed for two days. But she was detained in the airport along with human trafficking involved people; her Russian travel visa expired on July 15, two days before she tried to leave the country on July 17 and with the Dominican ambassador in Russia intervention, she could travel to the third round on Thailand and together with Niverka Marte <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> coach joined {{the rest of the team}} who had traveled on time. The Dominican team finally ranked eight after losing two matches in the Thai round, not qualifying for the final round.|$|E
25|$|Coleman and Brown bicycled into Norwood on July 13 {{at about}} 9:30a.m. Less {{than three hours}} later, they drove away in a car {{belonging}} to Harry Walters, who was unconscious, and his wife, Marlene, 43, who had been raped and beaten to death. Harry Walters survived and later testified that Coleman and Brown inquired about a camper he had offered for sale. While Walters {{sat on the couch}} and discussed the trailer title with Coleman, Coleman picked up a wooden candlestick and, after admiring it, hit Walters {{on the back of the}} head with it. The impact of the blow broke the candlestick and drove a chunk of bone against Mr. Walters' brain, and he remembered little else of the incident beyond that point. Sheri Walters, Harry and Marlene's daughter, returned home from work at about 3:45p.m., where she found her mother dead at the bottom of the basement steps, and her father still alive. Both had ligatures around their throats and electrical cords tied around their bare feet, her father's hands were handcuffed behind his back, while her mother's hands were bound behind her back <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> was covered with a bloody sheet. The coroner indicated Marlene Walters had been bludgeoned on the head approximately 20 to 25 times, with twelve lacerations, some of which were made with a pair of locking pliers, covered her face and scalp. The back of her skull was crushed to pieces, and parts of her skull and brain were missing. The living room hallway and basement were splattered with blood, and shards of a broken soda bottle, bearing Coleman's fingerprints, were found in the living room. Strands of Marlene Walters' hair were found on a bloodstained magazine rack located in the living room, and bloody footprints made by two different kinds of shoes were found in the basement. The Walters' car, a red Plymouth Reliant, was missing, as well as money, jewelry, and shoes which had been stolen. Two bicycles, clothes and shoes not belonging to the Walters had been left behind.|$|E

500|$|Wu Ruolan ( [...] or Wu Yu-lan). Wu was the {{daughter}} of an Intellectual from Jiuyantang (...) in Hunan. Zhu met Wu after attacking Leiyang with the Peasant's and Workers Army. They married in 1928. In January 1929, Zhu and Wu were encircled by Kuomintang troops at a temple in the Jinggang Mountains. Zhu escaped, but Wu was captured. She was executed by decapitation <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> was allegedly sent to Changsha for display.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} {{performed}} on the Born This Way Ball and [...] tours; in the latter she dressed up in a polka-dotted rubber outfit with tentacles growing out around her waist <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone described her look as [...] "she had an inflatable rubber order of fried calamari growing out of her spine", while Adam Carlson from Billboard said that the outfit made Gaga look like a [...] "dancing Ursula from The Little Mermaid". In 2017, the song was added to the setlist of the Joanne World Tour. The performance ends with a choreographed attack on Gaga by her dancers.|$|E
500|$|Although {{each of the}} film's key puppets {{required}} a small team of puppeteers to operate it, the most complex puppet of the production was Hoggle. Shari Weiser was inside the costume, while Hoggle's face was radio-controlled by Brian Henson and three other operators. Speaking in the Inside the Labyrinth documentary, Brian Henson explained that Weiser [...] "does all the body movement <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> is inside the head. However, the jaw is not connected to her jaw. Nothing that the face is doing has any connection with what she's doing with her face. The other {{four members of the}} crew are all radio crew, myself included." [...] Speaking of the challenges involved with performing Hoggle, Brian Henson said, [...] "five performers trying to get one character out of one puppet was a very tough thing. Basically what it takes is a lot of rehearsing and getting to know each other." ...|$|E

500|$|On April 21, 1913, Phagan {{was laid}} off due to a {{shortage}} of brass sheet metal. Around noon on April 26, {{she went to the}} factory to claim her pay of $1.20. The next day, shortly before 3:00a.m., the factory's night watchman, Newt Lee, went to the factory basement to use the toilet. After leaving the toilet, Lee discovered Phagan's body {{in the rear of the}} basement near an incinerator and called the police. Her dress was up around her waist and a strip from her petticoat had been torn off and wrapped around her neck. Her face was blackened and scratched, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> was bruised and battered. A [...] strip of [...] wrapping cord was tied into a loop around her neck, buried [...] deep, showing that she had been strangled. Her underwear was still around her hips, but stained with blood and torn open. Her skin was covered with ashes and dirt from the floor, initially making it appear to responding officers that she and her assailant had struggled in the basement.|$|E
2500|$|On June 5, 1945, 43-year-old Josephine Ross {{was found}} dead in her {{apartment}} at 4108 North Kenmore Avenue, Chicago. She had been repeatedly stabbed, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> was wrapped in a dress. She was presumed to have surprised an intruder, who then killed her. Dark hairs were found clutched in Ross' hand, indicating that she had struggled with the intruder before she was killed. No valuables were taken from [...] the apartment.|$|E
2500|$|Lady Cheverel – wife of Sir Christopher, a [...] "rather cold" [...] woman. She {{has decided}} {{views about the}} propriety of a wife's {{submitting}} to her husband, and is somewhat disapproving of the headstrong Miss Assher as a result. [...] "She is nearly fifty, but her complexion is still fresh and beautiful... her proud pouting lips, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> thrown a little backward as she walks, give an expression of hauteur which is not contradicted by the cold grey eyes." ...|$|E

2500|$|La niña del rayo was {{approximately}} {{six years old}} when she was sacrificed. Her face, one of her ears, and part of her shoulder were damaged by a lightning strike that occurred after her death. Her head was lifted high, and she was facing toward the south-west. She was wearing a traditional light brown acsu dress, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> along with part of her body, was wrapped in a thick wool blanket. Additionally, her entire body was wrapped in another blanket, this one an embroidered blanket of red and yellow. Her skull appears to have been intentionally elongated.|$|E
2500|$|Seventeen {{hours after}} St. Guillen {{spoke with her}} friend, Brooklyn police {{received}} an anonymous phone call alerting them to a dead woman's body. They soon identified it as St. Guillen. Her body was nude, wrapped in a comforter. Her broken fingernails showed she fought against her attacker. Her hands and feet were tied, a sock had been shoved down her throat, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> was wrapped in packing tape. Some of her hair had been cut off. An autopsy revealed {{that she had been}} beaten and sexually assaulted before being asphyxiated. According to forensic psychologist Dr. Stephanie Stolinsky, the killer [...] "tried to dehumanize her completely. ... Whenever you hide someone's face, it means that you don't want to see them as a human being. [...] You want to pretend that they're just an object".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the weeks}} before her execution, Wuornos gave a series of {{interviews}} to Broomfield. She depicts, [...] "being taken away to meet God and Jesus and the angels and whatever is beyond the beyond". In her final interview, she once again charged that her mind was [...] "tortured" [...] at BCI, <b>and</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> crushed by [...] "sonic pressure". Food poisonings and other abuses worsened, she said, each time she complained, with the goal of making her appear insane, or to drive her insane. She also turned on her interviewer: [...] "You sabotaged my ass! Society, and the cops, and the system! A raped woman got executed, and was used for books and movies and shit!" [...] Her final on-camera words were [...] "Thanks a lot, society, for railroading my ass." [...] Dawn Botkins, a childhood friend of Wuornos, later told Broomfield that her verbal abuse was directed at society and the media in general, not at him specifically.|$|E
