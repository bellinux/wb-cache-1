40|$|Latex allergy is an {{important}} concern from an occupational safety aspect and affects compliance of glove usage, which directly influences infection control practices aimed at providing safe medical care for both the health care worker (HCW) and patient. The Dr George Mukhari Hospital (DGM) in Pretoria has a staff complement of 1500 doctors and nurses who use latex gloves occasionally or regularly. The objective {{for this study was}} to evaluate the current prevalence of latex allergies and staff awareness of latex <b>glove</b> <b>allergies</b> as well as the availability of alternatives. Occupational health and laboratory records were reviewed for evidence of latex allergy and a crude rate of 4 % was determined in this study population over the study period. Interviews assessing HCW knowledge and practices regarding latex <b>glove</b> <b>allergy</b> and alternatives were performed using a questionnaire. Results from the interviews identified numerous gaps in knowledge regarding latex allergies and alternatives even amongst those who had latex allergies. Thus greater efforts are required to educate HCWs regarding latex allergies and consideration should be given to the use of non-latex gloves in high use areas to reduce future latex allergy development which can affect the HCWâ€™s occupational and social functioning...|$|R
40|$|The {{materials}} in plastic protective gloves {{are thought to}} cause less contact <b>allergy</b> than rubber <b>gloves.</b> Our aim was to estimate the frequency of delayed reactions to different types of reusable protective gloves among dermatitis patients. 2 x 2 cm pieces of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) gloves, nitrile gloves, and natural rubber latex (NRL) gloves were tested as is in consecutive dermatitis patients tested with the baseline series. Among 658 patients, 6 patients reacted to PVC gloves and 6 patients to the NRL gloves. None reacted to both these types of gloves. Five of six patients with reactions to rubber gloves reacted to thiuram mix in the baseline series. Delayed reactions to reusable PVC gloves may be as common as to reusable NRL gloves. In contrast to most reactions to the NRL glove, the reactions to the PVC glove had no obvious association with reactions to any allergen(s) in the baseline series...|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{investigate}} the prevalence {{and nature of}} some occupationally related health problems in dentists in southern Thailand. Design: A cross-sectional study using a self-report questionnaire distributed to all 220 dentists working in 14 provinces in southern Thailand in 1997. Participants: One hundred and seventy-eight dentists aged between 22 to 54 years responded. Results: The most common occupational health problems were musculoskeletal pain (78 per cent) and percutaneous injury (50 per cent). Associated factors were analysed using multivariate analysis. About 22 per cent of these dentists {{had a history of}} contact dermatitis mostly caused by <b>allergy</b> to latex <b>gloves,</b> 15 per cent had eye problems, and 3 per cent had hearing problems. Conclusions: Continuing education in the avoidance of percutaneous injuries would be beneficial, as exposure to potential infectious agents is of concern. Further studies are needed to identify causes of musculoskeletal pain and to identify appropriate interventions to reduce its prevalence, as would similar measures to reduce exposure to agents which may be producing contact dermatitis...|$|R

40|$|Hand {{dermatitis}} (HD) {{represents one}} of the most common manifestations of occupational skin disease among health care workers (HCW). Occupational HD usually has a poor prognosis with considerable socioeconomic impact for the individual and their workplace. Contact dermatitis (both irritant and allergic) is a common cause of HD in HCW. Several intrinsic and extrinsic factors may put HCW at a higher risk of occupational HD. Among them, latex <b>glove</b> <b>allergy</b> has been well-described among several health professions. Accurate diagnosis of occupational HD, through further investigation, is necessary to help reduce its often chronic course and help address risk factors. There are currently no evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of HD, and the success of various treatment regimes appears to be highly variable. Although difficult to implement in practice, the prevention of occupational HD is paramount, and a variety of prevention strategies may be employed to reduce the prevalence of HD amongst HCW...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of natural}} rubber latex medical gloves {{in the last three}} decades has caused an increase in latex allergy. The majority of risk groups for allergy development include health care workers, workers in the rubber industry, atopic individuals and children with congenital malformations. Three types of pathological reactions can occur in people using latex medical gloves: irritant contact dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis and immediate hypersensitivity. The latex allergy is caused by constituent components of latex gloves and added powders; there are also numerous latex allergens involved in cross-reactivity between latex and fruits and vegetables, the so-called latex-fruit syndrome. The diagnosis is based on an accurate history of exposure, clinical presentation and confirmatory in vivo and in vitro tests. Prevention is the easiest, most effective and least expensive way to avoid latex <b>allergy.</b> Powder-free latex <b>gloves</b> with reduced levels of proteins and chemicals, and synthetic gloves for allergic workers must be provided in the work environment. There are already many health care institutions around the world where all latex products have been replaced by synthetic material products...|$|R
40|$|An {{increase}} in the occurrence of latex allergy has been concurrent with {{the increasing use of}} latex gloves by laboratory and healthcare workers. In recent years nitrile gloves have been used to replace latex gloves to prevent latex <b>allergy.</b> Nitrile <b>gloves</b> offer a comparable level of protection against chemical and biological agents and are more puncture resistant. However, if manual dexterity is compromised by nitrile gloves to a greater degree than latex then this may increase the risk of sharps injuries. The Purdue pegboard test, which measures both gross and fine finger dexterity, was used to test the dexterity levels of two glove types used at HPA CEPR; Kimberly-Clark SafeSkin nitrile and latex laboratory gloves. There was a statistically signi-ficant 8. 6 % {{increase in}} fine finger dexterity provided by latex compared with nitrile SafeSkin laboratory gloves but no difference in gross dexterity between the glove types. There was no significant relationship between glove dexterity and age or gender. The selection of glove size was influenced by the digit length of participants. Moreover, those with longer, thinner fingers appeared to have an advantage when using nitrile SafeSkin gloves. The level of dexterity provided by latex and nitrile SafeSkin gloves for tasks on a gross dexterity level are comparable and health workers will benefit from the non-allergenic properties of nitrile. For tasks requiring fine finger dexterity nitrile SafeSkin gloves may impede dexterity. Despite this, the degree of restriction appears to have a negligible impact on safety in this study when compared with the risk of latex sensitization and subsequent allergy. In addition to glove material, working prac-tices must also take into account glove size, fit, grip and thickness, as these factors can all influence dexterity...|$|R
40|$|Background: According {{to studies}} from {{different}} countries, {{the prevalence of}} natural rubber latex (NRL) sensitization in healthcare workers ranges from 2. 9 to 17 %. The incidence and prevalence of sensitization and allergy to NRL in Thailand is limited to two studies. There is no study among the high risk healthcare workers. Objectives: 1) To estimate the prevalence of natural rubber latex (NRL) <b>glove</b> <b>allergy</b> and NRL sensitization among nurses; 2) To describe its clinical symptoms. Material and Method: Included {{in the present study}} were 412 nursing and medical record staff. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect personal biodata and individual allergy histories to NRL products. Skin prick tests (SPTs) with the commercial NRL allergens; Stallergnes, S. A, Fresnes, France, and common environmental allergens, were performed. Results: The questionnaire response rate was 88 % (412 / 470), 93 % females. The response rate of SPT was 72 % (295 / 412) (95 %CI 67. 2, 76. 0). The prevalence of NRL glove allergic symptoms and NRL sensitization was 24 % (95 %CI 19. 9, 28. 1) and 2 % (95 %CI 0. 4, 3. 6), respectively. The most frequently reported symptoms among the positive SPT to NRL was angioedema. Five of the six NRL sensitised subjects had had high exposure to NRL...|$|R
40|$|Allergic {{reactions}} to natural rubber latex proteins among glove using {{health care professionals}} has become a significant problem worldwide {{over the last few}} decades. However, in Sri Lanka a statistical study has never been carried out to detect allergic responses to latex proteins. The current study was undertaken in order to fill this void. The study consisted of a questionnaire based survey and determination of extractable protein content of different glove brands used by Sri Lankan health care workers. Project sites were selected which represents an island wide cross section of Sri Lankan healthcare workers including all bio-climatic zones of Sri Lanka. An introductory leaflet and two questionnaires were prepared and distributed among 6, 000 health care workers of following hospitals; Colombo south (Pilot sample), the National Hospital of Sri Lanka (bulk sample), Karapitiya, Mahamodara, Kandy, Anuradhpura, Ratnepura, Kurunegela, Badulla, Nuwara Eliya, Hambanthota, Tissamaharamaya and Tangalle hospitals. Total extractable proteins of new and re-used glove samples were determined by using BCA protein assay test kit. Results of this study provide information on Latex Allergy (LA) and Contact Glove Dermatitis (CGD) among Sri Lankan health care workers for the first time. Results of the questionnaire survey were analyzed. Response rate of the entire population was 59 %. Out of 3, 526 respondents, 14 % reported adverse {{reactions to}} latex gloves. The prevalence of Contact Glove Dermatitis was 13 % and 5 % met the criteria for Latex Allergy. Combination of LA and CGD was detected only in 4. 22 %. The prevalence of latex <b>allergy</b> and Contact <b>glove</b> dermatitis in this study were comparatively low when compared to the previous studies among other countries. Statistical analysis of collected data was done by using the SAS package. According to the statistical analysis of results from this study, factors such as gender (females), longer duration of glove use on daily basis (more than 6 hours and 1 - 6 hours per day), different sections of hospital, presence of wheezing/asthma, hay fever, food allergy, drug allergy, eczema, soap allergy, dust allergy and allergy to sun rays appear to be contributing (risk) factors of developing Latex <b>Allergy</b> and Contact <b>Glove</b> Dermatitis in health care workers. Health care workers who use gloves frequently appear to be at risk of developing Contact Glove Dermatitis. There is relationship between job category (occupation) of health care workers and Contact Glove Dermatitis. Total extractable protein levels of different glove brands were higher than the. levels, which FDA has proposed. However, it is necessary to confirm the prevalence of latex allergy in this study, by doing an evaluation test, which is a measure of IgE mediated hypersensitivity such as skin test or ill-vitro assay of specific IgE antibodies to the latex allergens...|$|R
40|$|Latex allergy is {{a common}} {{occupational}} disease among healthcare workers who use latex gloves. Self-administrated questionnaires, physical examination and diverse allergic tests are largely used to assess data about natural history, risk factors, type of allergic reaction, etc. The aim {{of the present study}} was to determine the prevalence of <b>allergy</b> to latex <b>gloves</b> among dental students. In this prospective study, a total of 240 students separated as non-exposed, shortly-exposed and longer-exposed during school practice completed a self-administrated questionnaire that comprised of a total of different items and gave information about the participants and their glove use, working habits and glove use, signs and symptoms related to glove use, precautions taken to minimize it, etc. Challenge and patch tests were performed through latex gloves, skin prick test with commercial extracts. Questionnaire items and diagnostic tests revealed that one-fourth of subjects were suspicious for latex gloves hypersensitivity. Their mean value for skin reactions like contact urticaria, irritant or allergic dermatitis was between 10 % and 14 %, while for other symptoms the mean value was under 5 %. In general, students who experienced latex exposure over 2 years during their school practice have shown about a two-fold positive response for statements or diagnostic tests about latex gloves hypersensitivity. Also the Kendall tau coefficient progressed from non-exposed group to longer-exposed one for the majority of items. Because of relationship between allergic reactions to latex gloves and some medical histories, it seems to be necessary for pre-matriculation evaluation and periodic health surveillance of dental students...|$|R
40|$|Latex gloves are a {{frequent}} cause of complaints in dental staff, which complaints may start during the student education. The {{aim of the}} present study was to evaluate the prevalence of latex gloves-related complaints among dental students and to establish the etiology of these problems. Material and Methods: 122 dental students completed a questionnaire. Those with latex glove-related complaints were evaluated for latex sensitivity by assessment of skin prick test and for cell-mediated sensitivity to rubber additives and occupational hazards by assessment of patch test. Results: 8. 2 % of dental students had skin hand complaints wearing latex gloves. 3 of them (30 %) showed a positive skin prick to latex and 1 of them (10 %) showed a positive patch test to rubber additives. Conclusions: Dental students are at risk to develop occupational hypersensitivity although the limited exposure to latex gloves during education. Key words: <b>allergy,</b> dermatitis, latex <b>gloves</b> Dental practitioners who regularly use latex gloves are at increased risk for latex sensitivity (6, 10). They are also at risk for irritant or allergic contact dermatitis (8). There are three types of reactions to latex products: irritant contact dermatitis, allergic contact dermatitis, and immediate type I reaction (1, 3). Hand contact dermatitis in dental staff is a common occupational disorder (2, 5). It develops shortly after beginning the dental practice even during the education in dental schools (2, 10). The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the prevalence of latex gloves-related complaints among dental students in four year of their education and to establish the etiology of these problems...|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} a wide {{speculation}} of the protein <b>allergy</b> in powdered <b>gloves.</b> It has caused some countries to replace the natural rubber latex with synthetic lattices. The experiments have shown that chlorination is a good answer to the protein allergy problem {{in the production of}} powderless gloves. The level of chlorination varies from one manufacturer to another. There aren't enough research to prove the optimum chlorination level with regard to different physical properties. This research was done to fill this void. The research was focused on finding tensile strength and friction coefficients at various chlorination levels. Further analysis was done on surface topology and extractable protein content for selected samples. The films were prepared from prevu 1 canised natural rubber latex. The chlorination was done by using a solution of sodium hypochlorite with 1 % m/m hydrochloric acid. The dried prevulcanised latex films were chlorinated at different concentrations with different immersion times. Tensile strength was checked for all the films by using Hounsfield HI 0 KT Electronic tensile testing machine. Friction coefficient was found for all the films according to the ASTM standard. The surface topology was observed for selected samples from transmitted light of the OPTIPHOT-POL microscope. Finally extractable protein content was found from BCA enhanced protocol method for selected samples. The results showed that there is a cyclic pattern for the variation of tensile strength and friction coefficient with the time of chlorination. The chlorine concentration of 1150 ppm was selected as a suitable concentration which showed better results, The chlorination time of 12 minutes was selected as a suitable time which gave better results. The surface topology of these selected samples revealed that the removal of excessive compounding ingredients, surface hardenings and surface cracks increase with the level of chlorination. These factors {{have an effect on the}} films. The surface cracks can cause leakage of the film. The extractable protein content reduces with the increase of chlorination level. However it is necessary to do an analysis from Fourier transform Infra-red (FTIR) spectrometer on the formation of different bonds during the chlorination reaction. Since the facilities were not available it was not possible to perform the FTIR test. The overall results showed that chlorine concentration of 1150 ppm at 12 minutes is the optimum chlorination level. However an efficient leaching system has to be performed to further reduce the extractable protein content of the films. The chlorination system can be further improved by using the chlorine gas system instead of the acidified Sodium Hypochlorite solution...|$|R
40|$|When we used NRL glove extract SPT {{to screen}} 3, 269 {{children}} admitted for inhalant or food allergy testing and confirmed the diagnosis with a standardized NRL allergen SPT, latex RAST and glove use test, {{the prevalence of}} NRL allergy {{was found to be}} 1 %. Although children with multiple operations are a well-known risk group for NRL allergy, two-thirds of the present 42 NRL-allergic children had no history of multiple operations. Moreover, a third of the NRL-allergic children had no history of symptoms though they had undergone operations in hospital or been in contact with balloons and other NRL products at home. Most of the non-operated (97 %) and multioperated (83 %) NRL-allergic children were atopics. These results show that routine skin prick testing, at present by using standardized reagents, is a valuable method of finding NRL-allergic subjects among children admitted for inhalant or food <b>allergy</b> testing. The <b>glove</b> use test is easy to perform and a high-allergenic glove brand can be recommended for use to confirm the clinical reactivity in the children who present with atypical or negative history of NRL allergy. It should be known, however, that certain NRL glove brands may contain moderate or minute amounts of cowÂ´s milk casein. In addition to NRL allergic children we also found 5 children with cowÂ´s milk allergy who presented with a "false" positive NRL glove use test reaction, i. e., contact urticaria, which was due to casein and not to NRL eluting from the gloves. Allergological data from the non-operated, NRL-allergic children is scanty. Accordingly, we compared SPT reactivity to NRL and IgE antibody findings between the non-operated and multioperated NRL-allergic children. The findings in both groups of children were, however, similar with regard to SPT reactivity to glove eluate and commercial NRL allergen (StallergÃ¨nes), and IgE antibody levels in latex RAST. The IgE antibody frequencies and levels were also measured for the purified major NRL allergens using ELISA. Between 58 % and 86 % of the non-operated and multioperated children had IgE antibodies to Hev b 6. 01 (prohevein) and 6. 02 (hevein), which are therefore major NRL allergens in these two groups of children. The multioperated children significantly more frequently had IgE antibodies to Hev b 1 (rubber elongation factor, 67 % vs. 27 %) and Hev b 5 (33 % vs. 3 %) than the non-operated children, suggesting that IgE response to these two NRL allergens could be due to sensitization during multiple operations. None of the present NRL-allergic children had IgE antibodies to Hev b 7, a patatin-like NRL allergen, showing that this is not an important NRL allergen for children. To examine the outcome of NRL allergy, 32 children were followed for a mean of 2. 8 years. Despite careful instructions on avoidance of NRL, 22 (69 %) NRL-allergic children were exposed to balloons and other NRL products at home. Ten (31 %) children exhibited symptoms, 8 of them local contact symptoms and 2 children systemic symptoms. These results show that more attention should be paid to informing both non-operated and multioperated children and their parents on the risk of NRL allergy at home and in the everyday environment. The children followed did not show any change in SPT reactivity and IgE levels to NRL allergens, which supports an on-going NRL exposure in the home environment. On the other hand, the frequency of SPT reactivity to cross-reactive fruits (banana, avocado, kiwi fruit) as well as to potato remained high during the follow-up. Continuous exposure of the NRL-allergic children to cross-reactive fruits and vegetables could possibly also maintain increased IgE levels to NRL allergens, and especially to hevein, because class I endochitinases in these fruits are known to contain a hevein-like domain. In conclusion, the prevalence of NRL allergy is 1 % among atopic children and it frequently affects also non-operated children. A third of the NRL-allergic children gave negative history of allergy symptoms. A combination of SPT with standardized allergen, latex RAST and NRL glove use test can be recommended for NRL allergy diagnosis in children. The major NRL allergens in children are hevein (Hev b 6. 02), prohevein (Hev b 6. 01) and also REF (Hev b 1) for multioperated children. During the follow-up two-thirds of the NRL-allergic children still had contacts with balloons, rubber boots or household gloves and could exhibit systemic or local symptoms, due to which the avoidance of NRL products in the home environment needs more attention.
