The analyses are based on questionnaire distributed to 248 AIM listed SMEs. The paper employs the one-way ANOVA and post hoc test on responses from 72 managers of AIM listed SMEs. The results show differences in the importance of each component of WCM. First, inventory holding period importance is shown to differ from that of <b>accounts</b> receivable <b>period,</b> <b>accounts</b> payable <b>period</b> and cash conversion cycle. The results also show that <b>accounts</b> receivable <b>period</b> importance is different from <b>accounts</b> payable <b>period</b> and cash conversion cycle. However, there is no difference of importance between <b>accounts</b> payable <b>period</b> and cash conversion cycle. In terms of ranking order, <b>accounts</b> receivable <b>period</b> is ranked first, leading to the conclusion that given the limited resources of SMEs, they need to prioritise their WCM by focusing on <b>accounts</b> receivable <b>period</b> to improve profitability...|$|R
