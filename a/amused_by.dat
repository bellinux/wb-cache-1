5|$|Edward's father, {{though a}} harsh disciplinarian, was demonstrably affectionate, {{and his mother}} {{displayed}} a frolicsome side with her children that belied her austere public image.

5|$|As {{well as a}} fencing and archery enthusiast, Parsons {{was also}} a keen shooter; he often hunted jack rabbits and cotton tails in the desert, and was <b>amused</b> <b>by</b> mock dueling with Forman while on test sites with rifles and shotguns. Upon proposing to his first wife Helen, he gifted her a pistol. Parsons enjoyed playing pranks on his colleagues, often through detonating {{explosives}} such as firecrackers and smoke bombs, and was known to spend {{hours at a time}} in the bathtub playing with toy boats while living at the Parsonage.|$|E
5|$|For {{his work}} on Itchy & Scratchy, Grampa is {{nominated}} for an award for Outstanding Writing in a Cartoon Series. When Grampa sees Itchy & Scratchy {{for the first time}} in a clip show introducing the award, he is appalled at the violent humor, and turns his acceptance speech into an assault on both the cartoon and the audience <b>amused</b> <b>by</b> it. He storms off the stage amidst boos and thrown vegetables. Grampa gives the award to Bart and Lisa, and Bart swears never to watch an award show again, unless Billy Crystal is featured.|$|E

50|$|His {{dance in}} the Eurovision Song Contest, {{delivered}} after standing completely still and looking serious {{in the first half}} of the song, became famous because of its manical delivery, which, in combination with his physical appearance, was found <b>amusing</b> <b>by</b> many viewers.|$|R

5000|$|Teuchter ( [...] or [...] ) is a Lowland Scots word {{originally}} used {{to describe}} a Scottish Highlander, in particular a Gaelic-speaking Highlander. Like most such cultural epithets, {{it can be seen}} as offensive, but is often seen as <b>amusing</b> <b>by</b> the speaker. The term is contemptuous, essentially describing someone seen to be uncouth and rural.|$|R

25|$|The audience, {{which had}} {{gathered}} to hear Karnad speak, had mixed {{reactions to the}} speech. Some, like organizer Anil Dharker, tried ineffectually to steer the speech to more politically correct waters. Others were <b>amused</b> <b>by</b> the episode, and some commented on the research and logic that {{had gone into the}} speech (unfortunately overshadowed by its 'scandalous' nature).|$|E
25|$|It was in 1785 that WCC first {{appeared}} in an important match. White Conduit Fields was an open area allowing members of the public, including the rowdier elements, to watch the matches and to voice their opinions on the play and the players. The White Conduit gentlemen were not <b>amused</b> <b>by</b> such interruptions and decided {{to look for a}} more private venue of their own.|$|E

In {{the middle of all}} their arguments, the Sultan (Tony Osoba) comes and demands to know who the killed his jester.

25|$|Voigt {{was arrested}} on 26 October and on 1 December sentenced to four {{years in prison for}} forgery, impersonating an officer and {{wrongful}} imprisonment. However, much of public opinion was on his side. German Kaiser Wilhelm II pardoned him on 16 August 1908. There are some claims that even the Kaiser was <b>amused</b> <b>by</b> the incident, referring to him as an amiable scoundrel, and being pleased with the authority and feelings of reverence that his military obviously commanded in the general population.|$|E
25|$|DC/DS 'Taff' Jones; (played by Meic Povey), a Welsh policeman. Although, not seeming {{particularly}} bright {{on first}} sight, Jones often proved sharper (though only mildly) than his superior, and was quietly <b>amused</b> <b>by</b> Arthur's frequent humiliation of Chisholm, even occasionally {{going into the}} Winchester for a social drink, away from Chisholm's domination. He tolerated the put-downs of his senior officer with 'Celtic willpower and a morbid fear of unemployment'. Jones was promoted to Detective Sergeant in Series 7, with DC MacDonald (Robin Cameron) as his assistant.|$|E

25|$|With {{the demands}} of a large home and four young boys to raise, Mulligan's mother hired an African-American nanny named Lily Rose, who became {{especially}} fond of the youngest Mulligan. As he became older, Mulligan began spending time at Rose's house and was especially <b>amused</b> <b>by</b> Rose's player piano, which Mulligan later recalled as having rolls by numerous players, including Fats Waller. Black musicians sometimes came through town, and because many motels would not take them, they often had to stay at homes within the black community. The young Mulligan occasionally met such musicians staying at Rose's home.|$|E
25|$|Visual {{hallucinations}} {{in people}} with DLB most commonly involve perception of people or animals that are not there, and may reflect Lewy bodies or AD pathology in the temporal lobe. Delusions may include reduplicative paramnesia and other elaborate misperceptions or misinterpretations. These hallucinations are not necessarily disturbing, and in some cases, the person with DLB may have insight into the hallucinations and even be <b>amused</b> <b>by</b> them, or be conscious they are not real. People with DLB also may have problems with vision, including double vision, and misinterpretation of what they see, for example, mistaking a pile of socks for snakes or a clothes closet for the bathroom.|$|E
25|$|According to the Church Tradition, Christianity {{was first}} {{brought to the}} {{territory}} of modern Belarus, Russia and Ukraine by Saint Andrew, the first Apostle of Jesus Christ. He traveled over the Black Sea to the Greek colony of Chersonesus Taurica in Crimea, where he converted several thousand men to new faith. Allegedly Saint Andrew traveled also north along the Dnieper River, where Kiev would be founded around the 5th century, and {{as far north as}} the future location of Veliky Novgorod. The legendary account of the Rus'ian Primary Chronicle tells that Saint Andrew was <b>amused</b> <b>by</b> the Slavic customs of washing in hot steam bath, banya, on his way.|$|E

25|$|Ideas for {{a comedy}} series about older women {{emerged during the}} filming of a {{television}} special at NBC's Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California, in August 1984. Produced to introduce the network's 1984–85 season schedule, two actresses appearing on NBC shows, Selma Diamond of Night Court and Doris Roberts of Remington Steele, appeared in a skit promoting the upcoming show Miami Vice as Miami Nice, a parody about old people living in Miami. NBC senior vice president Warren Littlefield was among the executive producers in the audience who were <b>amused</b> <b>by</b> their performance, and he envisioned a series based on the geriatric humor the two were portraying.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the war, he was {{a member}} of the small force which escorted Jan Smuts to the peace negotiations. He then {{disguised}} himself as an Afrikaans-speaking Boer, taking a job as a wagon driver working for the German colonial forces in South West Africa. This intelligence work ended unsuccessfully when he was identified, but managed to escape. This escapade later led to claims that he became the model for Richard Hannay, a character in the novels of John Buchan; Ironside was always <b>amused</b> <b>by</b> these novels when reading about Mr Standfast in the implausibly romantic setting of the passenger seat of an open-cockpit biplane flying from Iraq to Persia.|$|E
25|$|Ion Luca Caragiale {{is known}} to have been <b>amused</b> <b>by</b> the stock {{character}} Robert Macaire, {{at a time when the}} latter had been turned into a comedic character by Frédérick Lemaître. While in Berlin, he purchased the cartoons of French artists Honoré Daumier and Paul Gavarni (although it is not known if their separate portrayals of Macaire were familiar to him)—among these drawings was one showing notabilities embracing one another while picking each other's pockets, which shows similarities with Caragiale's own take on society. According to Cazimir, it is possible that he knew Daumier's work from early on, as several other subjects caricatured by the French artist bear a remarkable resemblance to his texts.|$|E

5000|$|The {{cinematic}} {{accomplishments of}} the movie are decidedly meager, such as the completely unexplained casting of David Warner as both the hero's mentor and the chief villain, {{in addition to providing}} the narration. The dialogue is decidedly campy (at one point Lord Vultare threatens Baydool with [...] "I grow weary of your antics, beggar-man!", which is made all the more <b>amusing</b> <b>by</b> the fact that David Warner is in fact talking to himself in the scene) and the movie has a low-budget atmosphere.|$|R
