5|$|Boston College (ACC: 3–3) {{could travel}} to the ACC Championship Game if they won out by beating both Wake Forest and Maryland. Boston College {{eventually}} did just that, and lost to Virginia Tech in the 2008 ACC Championship Game. Florida State (ACC: 4–3) would have won the Atlantic Division if they beat Maryland, Maryland beat Boston College, and Boston College beat Wake Forest. Under those circumstances, Florida State would have finished with a 5–3record, tied with Maryland. Florida State would win the tiebreaker because they had defeated Maryland head-to-head. As it happened, Maryland lost to Boston College, which relegated Florida State to a second-place finish in the division. Wake Forest (ACC: 4–3) would have won the division if they won their last game against Boston College, and both Florida State and Boston College beat Maryland. In that case, Florida State <b>and</b> <b>Wake</b> Forest would have had identical conference records (ACC: 5–3), <b>and</b> <b>Wake</b> Forest would have won the tiebreaker because they defeated Florida State earlier in the season.|$|E

After a scoreless third quarter, Georgia Tech took a 63 lead {{early in the fourth}} quarter. After Tech quarterback Reggie Ball threw a critical interception, Wake Forest was able to tie the game, then take a 96 lead.

That last scenario would have caused a three-way tie between Maryland, Florida State, <b>and</b> <b>Wake</b> Forest. All would have possessed a 5–3 conference record, and no head-to-head tiebreaker would have been possible.

5|$|The Sagarin {{computer}} {{rating system}} calculated Maryland's strength of schedule to be 36th-most difficult {{out of the}} 245 Division I teams. The Cosgrove Computer Rankings calculated it as the 56th-most difficult out of the 120 Division I FBS teams. In accordance with conference rules, Maryland faced all five Atlantic Division opponents: Boston College, Clemson, Florida State, NC State, <b>and</b> <b>Wake</b> Forest. They also faced three Coastal Division opponents: official ACC rival Virginia, North Carolina, and Virginia Tech. Virginia Tech and Boston College were the ACC champions and runners-up, respectively, in 2007 and again in 2008. Maryland did not play ACC opponents Duke, Georgia Tech, and Miami.|$|E
5|$|The charter {{members of}} the ACC were Clemson, Duke, Maryland, North Carolina, North Carolina State, South Carolina, <b>and</b> <b>Wake</b> Forest.

40|$|Two {{approaches}} to measuring dreaming <b>and</b> <b>waking</b> cognition were compared. Forty-three subjects wrote {{detailed descriptions of}} a dreaming <b>and</b> a <b>waking</b> experience <b>and</b> also used a questionnaire to evaluate the presence of particular types of cognition and metacognition in the target experience. Later, independent judges rated the subjects 2 ̆ 7 narrative reports for the incidence of {{the same types of}} cognition and metacognition. A lower incidence of some types of cognition was observed when assessment was based on judges 2 ̆ 7 ratings of the narrative reports than when subjects themselves assessed the incidence of these events. However, the basic relationship between dreaming <b>and</b> <b>waking</b> cognition was consistent for both measurement approaches. Subjects 2 ̆ 7 and judges 2 ̆ 7 evaluations of dreaming <b>and</b> <b>waking</b> experiences did not differ for internal commentary, sudden attention, focused attention, public self-consciousness, emotion, self-reflection, and thwarted intentions, although both subjects and judges attributed choice to waking experiences more often than to dreaming experiences. The value of using converging measures to compare dreaming <b>and</b> <b>waking</b> cognition is discussed, as well as whether dreaming cognition is best conceptualized as continuous or discontinuous with waking cognition...|$|R

Communication and utilities were crippled, forcing officials {{to set up}} water distribution centers to prevent disease. Total losses on the island amounted to $250 million. Despite {{the severity of the}} damage, only 11 people were killed. In the wake of the storm, a massive relief operation evacuated thousands to California, Hawaii, <b>and</b> <b>Wake</b> Island. Thousands more were sheltered in public buildings, and later tent villages, for many months. More than $60 million in relief funds were sent to Guam over the following years to aid in rehabilitation. Though the storm was devastating, it spurred new building codes and a revitalized economy.|$|E
5|$|North Carolina rose to No. 7 in the {{national}} college football polls, and the victory over Indiana was followed the next week by a 2817 win over No. 17 Stanford University. The two season-opening wins were followed by six more in succession. The Tar Heels beat Maryland, 4014, on September 20, and Virginia on September 27 by a score of 4820. Prior to the win against Virginia, North Carolina, rose from No. 7 to No. 5 in the polls, and remained at that level after the win. Texas Christian University fell 3110 to the Tar Heels on October 4, <b>and</b> <b>Wake</b> Forest lost to North Carolina, 3012, on October 11. After a week of inactivity, in which the Tar Heels rose to No. 4, North Carolina defeated in-state rival NC State by a score of 207, and after another week and a half, the Tar Heels beat Georgia Tech narrowly, 1613, in a Thursday night game.|$|E
5|$|When the {{computer}} was not in use, contents of the memory were preserved {{as long as the}} main lead-acid battery remained charged. The PowerBook100 Power Manager was an integrated circuit, usually placed on the logic board of a PowerBook, and was responsible for the power management of {{the computer}}. Identical to that of the Macintosh Portable, it controlled the display's backlight, hard drive spin-down, sleep <b>and</b> <b>wake,</b> battery charging, trackball control, and input/output (I/O). The 100 did add a new feature: 3.5V batteries backed up permanent and expansion random access memory (RAM) when the PowerBook100's battery was being replaced or when the 100 was otherwise temporarily removed from all power sources. This made it a perfect candidate for use with Apple's RAM disk to help increase battery life by accessing the hard disk less frequently, since the 100 was the only PowerBook that maintained the contents of RAM on shutdown in order to reduce startup time.|$|E

Jack and Judy have volunteered to pay for half of the wedding expenses but when they discover extravagant costs Ross spends much of the evening trying to bargain down his future in-laws. Chandler makes a toast that is not well received by the guests and Monica is taken aback when a drunken guest mistakes her for Ross's mother.

5|$|Scott tallied {{the go-ahead}} {{touchdown}} to complete Maryland's comeback, 20–17. The following week, Maryland fell to a heavy underdog again when a reeling Virginia team engineered a 31–0 shutout. Scott, then the leading rusher in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), had 11carries but {{was held to}} just 36yards. Despite the setback, Scott retained {{the lead in the}} ACC with 96.4rushing yards per game. After a bye week, Maryland shutout 21st-ranked Wake Forest, 26–0. Scott had 18carries for a game-high of 73yards, threw a nine-yard touchdown pass, and had three fumbles. In the first quarter, Scott fumbled at the Wake Forest 25-yard line, but was able to recover the ball. Two plays later, he executed a halfback option, where he took the handoff and threw a nine-yard pass to Heyward-Bey for a touchdown. It was Scott's first pass attempt and completion. Scott fumbled twice more in the first half, <b>and</b> <b>Wake</b> Forest recovered only to miss a field goal attempt each time. Against NC State, Scott had 23carries for 163yards and a 24-yard touchdown. In the fourth quarter, after the third play of Maryland's game-winning drive, Meggett replaced Scott, who had re-injured his shoulder. With the sixth win, Maryland attained bowl eligibility. Scott remained the ACC leading rusher with 102.6yards per game. He was deemed questionable before the Virginia Tech game, but did see action. However, the Virginia Tech line held Scott to 11yards on 10carries, although he did manage five receptions for 57yards. Against 17th-ranked North Carolina, Scott recorded 129rushing yards and a three-yard touchdown run. Maryland entered its penultimate regular season game against Florida State still within reach of the Atlantic Division title, and with it, a berth in the ACC Championship Game. Florida State, however, dashed Maryland's title hopes in a 37–3 rout in which Scott recorded 82rushing yards, but fumbled twice. In the fourth quarter, defensive end Everette Brown forced Scott to fumble, which was seen as the end to any potential comeback. Against a tough Boston College line, the Maryland rushing attack faltered, which forced quarterback Chris Turner to resort mostly to the pass. Scott rushed 13times for a gain of just 19yards.|$|E
