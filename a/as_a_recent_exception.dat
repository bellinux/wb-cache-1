The couple, around whom the show is based, also struggles with race as source of conflict on top of their LGBT storyline.|$|R

These Home Office predictions (which are for {{a reversal of the}} recent downward trend in recorded offences) are compared here with alternative econometric and multivariate time series predictions. The crucial role of the error correction structure of the econometric estimates compared with the forecast profiles which come from time series approaches is highlighted.

40|$|The rich {{empirical}} {{puzzle of}} the Stroop effect {{has traditionally been}} approached with narrowly focused and somewhat atheoretical models. <b>A</b> <b>recent</b> <b>exception</b> is <b>a</b> simulation model based on the WEAVER++ language theory. The present model, WACT, combines components of WEAVER++ with the memory and control processes of the ACT-R cognitive theory. WACT accounts for {{the time course of}} inhibition from incongruent word distractors, facilitation from congruent word distractors, the lack of effect of color distractors, and the semantic gradient in inhibition. WACT goes beyond WEAVER++ to account for Stroop performance errors as well as latencies, and its implementation in a unified cognitive theory opens doors to broader coverage of Stroop phenomena than standalone models are likely to attain. Documented and executable code for WACT is available for inspection and comment at www. msu. edu/~ema/stroop...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{quantify}} the relationship between multiple variables, researchers often carry out a mediation analysis. In such an analysis, a mediator (e. g., knowledge of a healthy diet) transmits the effect from an independent variable (e. g., classroom instruction on a healthy diet) to a dependent variable (e. g., consumption of fruits and vegetables). Almost all mediation analyses in psychology use frequentist estimation and hypothesis-testing techniques. <b>A</b> <b>recent</b> <b>exception</b> is Yuan and MacKinnon (Psychological Methods, 14, 301 - 322, 2009), who outlined a Bayesian parameter estimation procedure for mediation analysis. Here we complete the Bayesian alternative to frequentist mediation analysis by specifying a default Bayesian hypothesis test based on the Jeffreys-Zellner-Siow approach. We further extend this default Bayesian test by allowing a comparison to directional or one-sided alternatives, using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques implemented in JAGS. All Bayesian tests are implemented in the R package BayesMed (Nuijten, Wetzels, Matzke, Dolan, & Wagenmakers, 2014) ...|$|R

50|$|<b>A</b> more <b>recent</b> <b>exception</b> {{to this is}} the Torsen differential, {{which uses}} worms and {{planetary}} worm gears {{in place of the}} bevel gearing of conventional open differentials. Torsen differentials are most prominently featured in the HMMWV and some commercial Hummer vehicles, and <b>as</b> <b>a</b> centre differential in some all wheel drive systems, such as Audi's quattro. Very heavy trucks, such as those used to carry aggregates, often use a worm gear differential for strength. The worm drive is not <b>as</b> efficient <b>as</b> <b>a</b> hypoid gear, and such trucks invariably have a very large differential housing, with a correspondingly large volume of gear oil, to absorb and dissipate the heat created.|$|R
40|$|Most {{models of}} human {{performance}} on the traveling salesperson problem involve clustering of nodes, but few empirical studies have examined effects of clustering in the stimulus array. <b>A</b> <b>recent</b> <b>exception</b> varied degree of clustering {{and concluded that the}} more clustered a stimulus array, the easier a TSP is to solve (Dry, Preiss, & Wagemans, 2012). However, a limitation to this conclusion arises because degree of clustering may have been partially confounded with cluster location. An experiment was conducted to test the effects of cluster location while holding degree of clustering constant. Stimuli with a cluster near a boundary were solved more quickly and accurately than stimuli with the same cluster located more centrally. The results support and extend the previous findings of MacGregor, Ormerod, & Chronicle (1999). They also qualify the results of Dry et al. (2012). To the extent that degree of clustering may have been confounded with the location of clusters in their stimuli, it is unclear to what extent each factor may have affected performance...|$|R
40|$|DURING {{the past}} thirty years much useful {{progress}} has been made in the histological grading of malignant tumours of epithelial origin. This work, of which one practical application has been the attempted correlation of prognosis with histological structure of a tumour, has had many valuable results; and although there may be not infrequent discrepancies between the histological appreciation and the outcome of treatment in any given type of neoplasm, the results have at any rate led to some attempt being made by the histo-pathologist to guide the clinician at least in qualitative terms of high or low malignancy; and to more precise premises for the comnparison of differing methods of treatment in series of comparable cases. The starting point of this present analysis was the observation that irrespective of the mode of treatment applied, the overall five year survival rates in most published dissections of groups of cases of osteogenic sarcomata were approxinmately of a similar order. <b>A</b> <b>recent</b> <b>exception</b> to this is contained in the analysis of a group of 415 malignant tumours involving bone published by Prevo (1950) ...|$|R

40|$|In a {{world where}} the amount of aid from {{developed}} countries is falling <b>as</b> <b>a</b> percentage of Gross National Product (GNP), development agencies that wish to maintain or increase their aid effort face the problem of bringing public opinion along with them. Development education, with its dual aim of informing and encouraging action, has an important role to play in winning this public support. It can explain the need for development assistance, provide information on development activities and persuade individuals to actively support the development project. To date the development education funds granted by Development Cooperation Ireland (DCI) have been directed mainly at primary or secondary level students and teacher training colleges. <b>A</b> <b>recent</b> <b>exception</b> has been funding for Suas ([URL] an organisation which aims to raise awareness of development issues and encourage short term volunteering among third level students. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to reflect on the role of development education by exploring the present and potential contribution of NGO/third level linkages. It will do this by examining the connections and relationships between NGOs and third level institutions in Ireland and by using the UK and US <b>as</b> <b>a</b> comparative international backdrop. This should help to highlight possible ways forward in enhancing the effectiveness of development education at third level...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Past {{research}} on ethnicity in outdoor recreation {{has focused on}} park use and participation in recreation activities. Explanations of differences in park use and participation rates by minorities and non-minorities have emphasized the marginality and ethnicity hypotheses. A different approach can be used that emphasizes visitor’s expectations and preferences for appropriate behaviors at an urban proximate forest recreation site. Four social regularities are identified based on birth place and ethnic identity: cross cultural, United States indigene, Mexican born Hispanic, and Hispanic. The complexity of social regularities means that managers must maintain {{a high degree of}} familiarity with different visitor groups and the problems they encounter.
