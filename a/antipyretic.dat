5|$|Perovskia atriplicifolia has a {{long history}} of use in {{traditional}} medicine, especially as an <b>antipyretic.</b> It has also been employed as an antiparasitic and analgesic in Tibet, and smoked elsewhere as a euphoriant. In Balochistan, Pakistan, a decoction of the plant's leaves and flowers has been considered an anti-diabetic medication and a treatment for dysentery.|$|E
5|$|In 1834, in British Guiana, a German physician, Carl Warburg, invented an <b>antipyretic</b> medicine: 'Warburg's Tincture'. This secret, {{proprietary}} remedy contained quinine {{and other}} herbs. Trials {{were made in}} Europe in the 1840s and 1850s. It was officially adopted by the Austrian Empire in 1847. It was considered by many eminent medical professionals {{to be a more}} efficacious antimalarial than quinine. It was also more economical. The British Government supplied Warburg's Tincture to troops in India and other colonies.|$|E

40|$|Background: Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) is {{an acute}} {{infectious}} disease that often causes outbreaks, especially in group of children. Clinical symptoms of fever {{that emerged in}} the early phase is similar to other infectious diseases, so some housewife giving an <b>antipyretics</b> to their child as the first treatment without any sufficient knowledge about the use of the <b>antipyretics</b> type precisely and allegedly capable of exacerbating bleeding manifestations. Aim: Prove the association between the use of <b>antipyretics</b> type with the bleeding manifestations in children with Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever. Methods: Research conducted an observational study with cross-sectional study approach. Sampling was carried out through consecutive sampling method in the Department of Child Health, Dr. Kariadi General Hospital Center in March 2012 to June 2012. Data on the use of type <b>antipyretics</b> obtained through interviews or questionnaires to mothers who are willing to be respondents, and the bleeding manifestations were confirmed through medical records. Hypothesis testing is done using Chi-square test or Fisher exact test as alternatives. Results: Found 32 patients suffered from DHF during the study period. Based on the results of data analysis found a significant relationship between the use of <b>antipyretics</b> type with the bleeding manifestations in children with DHF (p = 0. 037). Children who get <b>antipyretics</b> non paracetamol before hospitalization had 11. 7 times greater risk for bleeding compared with children who received paracetamol.

5|$|Treatment for {{hyperthermia}} includes reducing muscle overactivity via sedation with a benzodiazepine. More {{severe cases}} may require muscular paralysis with vecuronium, intubation, and artificial ventilation. Suxamethonium {{is not recommended}} for muscular paralysis as it may {{increase the risk of}} cardiac dysrhythmia from hyperkalemia associated with rhabdomyolysis. <b>Antipyretic</b> agents are not recommended as the increase in body temperature is due to muscular activity, not a hypothalamic temperature set point abnormality.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is readily}} broken {{down in the}} body to {{salicylic}} acid, which itself has anti-inflammatory, <b>antipyretic,</b> and analgesic effects. In 2012, salicylic acid was found to activate AMP-activated protein kinase, which has been suggested as a possible explanation {{for some of the}} effects of both salicylic acid and aspirin. The acetyl portion of the aspirin molecule has its own targets. Acetylation of cellular proteins is a well-established phenomenon in the regulation of protein function at the post-translational level. Aspirin is able to acetylate several other targets in addition to COX isoenzymes. These acetylation reactions may explain many hitherto unexplained effects of aspirin.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{has been}} shown to have at least three {{additional}} modes of action. It uncouples oxidative phosphorylation in cartilaginous (and hepatic) mitochondria, by diffusing from the inner membrane space as a proton carrier back into the mitochondrial matrix, where it ionizes once again to release protons. Aspirin buffers and transports the protons. When high doses are given, it may actually cause fever, owing to the heat released from the electron transport chain, as opposed to the <b>antipyretic</b> action of aspirin seen with lower doses. In addition, aspirin induces the formation of NO-radicals in the body, which have been shown in mice to have an independent mechanism of reducing inflammation. This reduced leukocyte adhesion is an important step in the immune response to infection; however, evidence is insufficient to show aspirin helps to fight infection. More recent data also suggest salicylic acid and its derivatives modulate signaling through NF-κB. NF-κB, a transcription factor complex, plays a central role in many biological processes, including inflammation.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Antipyretics</b> ( [...] , from anti- 'against' and [...] 'feverish') are {{substances}} that reduce fever. <b>Antipyretics</b> cause the hypothalamus to override a prostaglandin-induced increase in temperature.

5|$|The {{mechanism}} of aspirin's analgesic, anti-inflammatory and <b>antipyretic</b> properties was unknown through the drug's heyday in the early- to mid-twentieth century; Heinrich Dreser's explanation, widely accepted since {{the drug was}} first brought to market, was that aspirin relieved pain by acting on the central nervous system. In 1958 Harry Collier, a biochemist in the London laboratory of pharmaceutical company Parke Davis, began investigating the relationship between kinins {{and the effects of}} aspirin. In tests on guinea pigs, Collier found that aspirin, if given beforehand, inhibited the bronchoconstriction effects of bradykinin. He found that cutting the guinea pigs' vagus nerve did not affect the action of bradykinin or the inhibitory effect of aspirin—evidence that aspirin worked locally to combat pain and inflammation, rather than on the central nervous system. In 1963, Collier began working with University of London pharmacology graduate student Priscilla Piper to determine the precise {{mechanism of}} aspirin's effects. However, it was difficult to pin down the precise biochemical goings-on in live research animals, and in vitro tests on removed animal tissues did not behave like in vivo tests.|$|E
5|$|The {{previously}} described study by Timby et al. (2015) also assessed {{the effects of}} MFGM supplementation in term infants on the risk of infectious diseases and other disease symptoms. In particular, the cumulative incidence of acute otitis media was analyzed between the two randomized feeding groups (control formula or MFGM- supplemented formula to 6 months of age), and compared to a breastfed reference group. The MFGM-supplemented group experienced {{a significant reduction in}} episodes of acute otitis media up to 6 months of age compared with infants fed control formula (1% vs 9%; P=0.034); with no significant difference in otitis media incidence compared to the breastfed group (0%). In addition, a significantly lower incidence and longitudinal prevalence of <b>antipyretic</b> drug use was seen in the MFGM-supplemented group (25%) compared with the control formula group (43%). Timby et al. (2017) further showed that the MFGM supplementation influenced the infants’ oral microbiota; the authors noted that, Moraxella catarrhalis, a common bacterial cause of acute otitis media, was less prevalent in infants fed the MFGM-supplemented formula than in those fed control formula.|$|E

40|$|Background Parents {{concerns}} about and immunological benefits of {{mild to moderate}} fevers have been reported for 25 years. Recent reports indicate practices of alternating <b>antipyretics</b> when fever has not reduced sufficiently. Purpose The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore the predictors of Australian parents’ intentions to reduce childhood fevers by non-pharmacological and pharmacological methods. Method A crossectional survey of 397 parents of children aged between 6 -months and 5 -years was undertaken. An instrument developed from literature, findings from focused discussions with 15 parents and existing instruments was used. Instrument face, content and construct validity were determined by an expert panel and readability by 10 parents. Predictors of intention to reduce fever, reduce fevers with <b>antipyretics</b> and reduce fevers of 38. 0 degrees Celsius or below were determined through the Theory of Planned Behavior. Predictors explored were parents’ beliefs about benefits of reducing fever, normative influences on reducing fever and reducing fever with <b>antipyretics</b> and perceived control over fever management. Results Simultaneous regressions were conducted. Beliefs (β=. 42) and norms relating to fever reduction (β=. 16) were strongest predictors of intentions to reduce fever R 2 =. 27, F[4, 392]= 36. 11, p=<. 001. Norms about reducing fevers with <b>antipyretics</b> (β=. 47) and beliefs (β=. 37) positively influenced intentions to reduce fevers with <b>antipyretics</b> R 2 =. 34, F[4, 392]= 50. 13, p=< 001 and norms about fever reduction had a negative influence (β=-. 20). Predictors of intentions to reduce fevers of 38. 0 °C or below were weaker R 2 =. 14, F[4, 392]= 16. 55, p=<. 001, however, beliefs (β=. 24) and norms about reducing fevers with <b>antipyretics</b> (β=. 29) predicted this practice. Conclusions Negative beliefs about fever and fever management and normative influences were the strongest predictors of parents’ fever management intentions. These findings highlight the need to target all parents’ beliefs about fever and its benefits and correct norms relating to reducing fever and the dangers of unnecessary and/or overuse of <b>antipyretics</b> in children with a febrile illness...|$|R
25|$|The primary {{mechanism}} {{responsible for}} its anti-inflammatory, <b>antipyretic,</b> and analgesic action {{is thought to be}} inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis by inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX). It also appears to exhibit bacteriostatic activity by inhibiting bacterial DNA synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Most NSAIDs {{inhibit the}} {{activity}} of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and thereby the synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. It is thought that inhibiting COX-2 leads to the anti-inflammatory, analgesic and <b>antipyretic</b> effects and that those NSAIDs also inhibiting COX-1, particularly aspirin, may cause gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcers in large doses.|$|E
25|$|When {{journalists and}} {{physicians}} began {{focusing on the}} narcotic contents of the patent medicines, some of their makers began replacing the opium tincture laudanum with acetanilide, a particularly toxic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with analgesic as well as <b>antipyretic</b> properties that had been introduced into medical practice under the name Antifebrin by A. Cahn and P. Hepp in 1886. But this ingredient change probably killed more of the nostrum's users than the original narcotics did, since acetanilide not only caused an alarming cyanosis due to methemoglobinemia but was later discovered to cause liver and kidney damage.|$|E
50|$|The {{underlying}} cause must be removed. Mild hyperthemia caused by exertion {{on a hot}} day may be adequately treated through self-care measures, such as increased water consumption and resting in a cool place. Hyperthermia that results from drug exposure requires prompt cessation of that drug, and occasionally the use of other drugs as counter measures. <b>Antipyretics</b> (e.g., acetaminophen, aspirin, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) have no role in the treatment of heatstroke because <b>antipyretics</b> interrupt the change in the hypothalamic set point caused by pyrogens; they are not expected to work on a healthy hypothalamus that has been overloaded, {{as in the case of}} heatstroke. In this situation, <b>antipyretics</b> actually may be harmful in patients who develop hepatic, hematologic, and renal complications because they may aggravate bleeding tendencies.|$|R

25|$|The {{occasional}} {{reports of}} acetanilide-induced cyanosis prompted {{the search for}} supposedly less toxic aniline derivatives, such as phenacetin. After several conflicting results over the ensuing fifty years, it was ultimately established in 1948 that acetanilide was mostly metabolized to paracetamol (known in the United States as USAN: acetaminophen) in the human body, {{and that it was}} this metabolite that was responsible for its analgesic and <b>antipyretic</b> properties. Acetanilide is no longer used as a drug in its own right, although the success of its metabolite – paracetamol (acetaminophen) – is well known.|$|E

25|$|European beavers (Castor fiber) were {{eventually}} hunted nearly to extinction {{in part for}} the production of castoreum, which was used as an analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and <b>antipyretic.</b> Castoreum was described in the 1911 British Pharmaceutical Codex for use in dysmenorrhea and hysterical conditions (i.e. pertaining to the womb), for raising blood pressure and increasing cardiac output. The activity of castoreum has been credited to the accumulation of salicin from willow trees in the beaver's diet, which is transformed to salicylic acid and has an action very similar to aspirin. Castoreum continues to be used in perfume production.|$|E

25|$|Kawasaki disease often {{begins with}} a high and {{persistent}} fever that is not very responsive to normal treatment with paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen. It is the most prominent symptom in Kawasaki disease, is a characteristic sign of the acute phase of the disease, is normally high (above 39–40°C), is remittent, and is followed by extreme irritability. Recently, it {{is reported to be}} present in patients with atypical or incomplete Kawasaki disease; nevertheless, it is not present in 100% of cases. The first day of fever is considered the first day of illness, and the duration of fever is on average one to two weeks; in the absence of treatment, it may extend for three to four weeks. Prolonged fever is associated with higher incidence of cardiac involvement. It responds partially to <b>antipyretic</b> drugs and does not cease with the introduction of antibiotics. However, when appropriate therapy is started– intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin– the fever is gone after two days.|$|E
