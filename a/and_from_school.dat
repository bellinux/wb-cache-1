5|$|McLeod {{attended}} Mayesville's one-room black schoolhouse, Trinity Mission School, {{which was}} run by the Presbyterian Board of Missions of Freedmen. She was the only child in her family to attend school, so each day, she taught her family what she had learned. To get to <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school,</b> Mary walked five miles each day. Her teacher Emma Jane Wilson became a significant mentor in her life. Wilson had attended Scotia Seminary (now Barber-Scotia College). She helped McLeod attend the same school on a scholarship, which she did from 1888–1893. The following year, she attended Dwight L. Moody's Institute for Home and Foreign Missions in Chicago (now the Moody Bible Institute), hoping to become a missionary in Africa. Told that black missionaries were not needed, she planned to teach, as education was a prime goal among African Americans.|$|E
25|$|In many countries, backpacks {{are heavily}} {{identified}} with students, {{and are a}} primary means of transporting educational materials to <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school.</b> In this context they are sometimes known as bookbags or schoolbags. The purchase of a suitably fashionable, attractive, and useful backpack is a crucial back-to-school ritual for many students.|$|E
25|$|The murders {{shocked the}} city. Worried parents formed escort groups to take {{children}} to <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> every day, and to patrol streets {{at night and}} on weekends.

25|$|The University of Ottawa {{has also}} {{introduced}} a bike share program to encourage cycling to <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school.</b> The university offers free bicycle rentals {{and access to}} free maintenance and repair workshops. Along with new bike routes and services, the university has enhanced car-pooling and shuttle services, and is also located next to the transit way {{to encourage students to}} use public transit via a discounted university student bus pass.|$|E
25|$|The {{scholarship}} includes full tuition, dormitory housing, {{three meals}} per {{day at the}} campus cafeteria, textbooks in Spanish for all courses, school uniform, basic toiletries, bedding, and a small monthly stipend of 100 Cuban pesos ($4). The scholarship does not include travel expenses to <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> which is not necessary {{in the first three}} out of six years as all classes during those years are walking distance from the dorms. The scholarship also does not include travel to and from Cuba.|$|E
50|$|Wheels {{operates}} fifteen (15) dedicated Select School Day services (also called School Trippers) {{that bring}} students to <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>schools</b> {{in the cities}} of Dublin and Pleasanton, and these operate when schools are in session.|$|R
50|$|In India, van {{is one of}} {{the most}} common modes of {{transport}} and is often used for commuting <b>school</b> children to <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>schools</b> as parents, especially working parents are too busy to themselves pick their children <b>from</b> <b>school</b> <b>and</b> when school buses are full and unable to accommodate other children.|$|R
25|$|The {{only public}} {{transport}} provided currently in Bouldon are buses to Ludlow in the morning, returning {{in the late}} afternoon. These services (176 and 715) are provided mainly for travel to <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>schools</b> <b>and</b> colleges, and only run on schooldays.|$|R
25|$|Violence against girls discourages {{them from}} {{attending}} school. Sexual or physical {{violence on the}} way to <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> or at home reduces girls' ability to concentrate in class. Instead of attending to the lesson, they are thinking about the violence they have experienced or worrying about future violence to come. Abuse reduces girls' participation in class even further than normal and reduces their ability to complete homework. Abused girls {{are more likely to have}} low attainment, more grade repetition and a higher drop-out rate than non-abused girls.|$|E
25|$|On March 15, 1920, {{the first}} day of the blizzard, the school {{dismissed}} its students early to enable them to go home before the storm arrived. Many of the students, like the Miner children, were used to driving to <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> with a horse and buggy, but the school teacher had a rule that no child was permitted to drive home in bad weather without permission from a parent. William Miner, who was worried about the blizzard conditions, rode the two miles to the school on a saddle horse to escort his children home.|$|E
25|$|By the mid-1980s, rumours of Rose's {{sex life}} had reached {{several of the}} children's classmates, and {{although}} the West children had been instructed never to divulge details of their home lives to their peers, Heather did confide to her friends {{that many of these}} rumours were true. The father of one of these classmates was a friend of the Wests; as such, word soon reached Fred and Rose that Heather had divulged details of her home life—including details of her mother's promiscuity—to her classmates. Fred was so concerned by these revelations that he began to escort Heather to <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school.</b>|$|E

25|$|Throughout {{this time}} Genie's father almost never {{permitted}} {{anyone else to}} leave the house, only allowing his son to go to <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> and requiring him to prove his identity through various means before entering, and to discourage disobedience he frequently sat {{in the living room}} with a shotgun in his lap. He did not allow anyone else in or near the house, and kept his gun nearby in case someone did come. No one in the neighborhood knew about the abuse Genie's father carried out on his family, or was aware that Genie's parents ever had a child besides their son. Throughout this time, Genie's father kept detailed notes chronicling his mistreatment of his family and his efforts to conceal it.|$|E
25|$|Prior to 1950, San Bruno's {{high school}} {{students}} attended San Mateo High School (opened in 1902) and then Burlingame High School (opened in 1923), traveling to <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> on the street cars that ran next to the Southern Pacific railroad. Finally, on September 11, 1950, Capuchino High School opened in San Bruno. After years of using Green Hall as a multi-purpose building, the city dedicated a library and city hall in 1954. That same year saw {{the dedication of the}} current central terminal at the airport, part of a major expansion program. A central fire station was later built next to the city hall; an additional station was built in Crestmoor.|$|E
25|$|Schooled {{mostly in}} one-room schools, Bascom quit school while in grade three {{to work on}} the Hyssop 5H Ranch, east of Lethbridge. It was not long before a Canadian Mountie, who was visiting the Hyssop Ranch, thought that one of the cowboys was just too young looking to be a {{seasoned}} cowpuncher and bronc peeler. The Mountie asked Earl Bascom just how old he was - he was 13 years old. Earl was returned to school. Attending school felt better after Earl's father, who had a school district transportation contract, gave him the job of driving an old stagecoach pulled by a team of Bascom horses each day to the surrounding ranches transporting fellow students to <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school.</b>|$|E

25|$|Both {{boys and}} girls could {{experience}} sexual harassment although girls experienced it more frequently. Members of the school community sexually harassed girls in and around school. Jobless men, unmarried men looking for partners or sex, and married men looking for sex, sexually harassed girls {{on their way to}} <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school.</b> In some cases, this could involve sexual assault and rape. Girls in the 10 to 19 year age group were most affected. Rape perpetrators could be diverse men in the community or men passing through the community. When rape occurred at home, perpetrators included uncles, cousins, fathers and stepfathers. Girls could be abducted for marriage which meant the man did not have to pay a bride price. Some compensation might be paid to the girl's parents so they would acknowledge the marriage. Parents could arrange an early or forced marriage against the girl's wishes to continue her education.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} that if the sexual {{harassment}} was done by a male, {{both male and female}} victims experienced behavioral problems, in contrast to if the female was the perpetrator, where the behavioral problems occurred less. Being absent from school frequently, having difficulties concentrating on school work, and performing poorly on academic work often result. In a 2011 nationwide survey conducted by the AAUW of 7th-12th grade students, 32% of students who had experienced sexual harassment did not want to return to school after it occurred. This included 37% of female students and 25% of male students. 31% of the surveyed students felt physically sick after being sexually harassed, with 37% of females and 21% of males reporting this effect. 30% of students had difficulties studying and focusing on school as a result of sexual harassment including 34% of females and 24% of males, and 19% of students reported having a difficult time sleeping due to sexual harassment, including 22% of females and 14% of males. Other effects include getting into trouble at school, changing the route in which one gets to <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school,</b> and stopping doing activities and sports.|$|E
25|$|Once girls enter school, patriarchal {{norms and}} values work against norms {{and values of}} modern {{education}} which aims to provide equal education for boys and girls. Parents may allow girls to attend school but still expect them to fulfill traditional duties rather than giving then time to do homework or arrive at school before school gates are shut. Girls are expected to participate in class contrary to their training for non-participation. If girls try to meet school norms for participation they are subjected to psychological violence reinforcing patriarchal norms. Girls may also be subjected to violence and abuse at home if they act on new school norms contrary to tradition. This clash of norms continues {{on the way to}} <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> with older boys and adult men seeing adolescent girls as unprotected by marriage. Consequently, girls experience physical and sexual violence and are at risk of abduction. Girls' attempts to cope with the educational system may increase their risk of violence and sexual abuse. Girl students were some of the main perpetrators of violence against other girls and they could act as go-betweens for boys in the hope that boys would favor them.|$|E

50|$|In some societies, this 'life' aspect {{might include}} looking after {{the elderly and}} infirm, sending {{children}} to <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>schools,</b> preparing the meals, cleaning the house and doing the laundry. They are as much work as the work life, {{and in the midst}} of all these, the need for leisure activities is simply an alien concept.|$|R
50|$|Student {{transport}} is the transporting {{of children}} and teenagers to <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>schools</b> <b>and</b> school events. School transport can be undertaken by school students themselves (on foot, bicycle or perhaps horseback; or for older students, by car), they may be accompanied by family members or caregivers, or the transport may be organised collectively, using buses or taxis.|$|R

500|$|The Kansas {{case was}} unique {{among the group}} in {{that there was no}} {{contention}} of gross inferiority of the segregated schools' physical plant, curriculum, or staff. The district court found substantial equality as to all such factors. The lower court, in its opinion, noted that, in Topeka, [...] "the physical facilities, the curricula, courses of study, qualification and quality of teachers, as well as other educational facilities in the two sets of schools [...] comparable." [...] The lower court observed that [...] "colored children in many instances are required to travel much greater distances than they would be required to travel could they attend a white school" [...] but also noted that the school district [...] "transports colored children to <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>school</b> free of charge" [...] and that [...] "o such service [...] provided to white children." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1968, {{the line}} was {{proposed}} {{for use as a}} public school rail line, taking children to <b>and</b> <b>from</b> <b>schools</b> along the route, but this [...] "visionary concept" [...] failed to gain the requisite support. In 1981, Anthony Guariello—a local mill owner and town councilman—purchased the line with the possibility of conversion into a bike path for school children.|$|R
