5|$|Insistent {{that his}} party take an equal {{role in the}} {{coalition}} government, Bruxner formed a good working relationship and long-lasting friendship with Stevens that would ensure the government's stability. The Stevens government had significant success, reducing Lang's 2 million pound deficit by 75%. However, one significant problem was that Stevens had trouble with <b>an</b> <b>unruly</b> backbench, and increasingly depended upon Bruxner and the Country Party. As Deputy Premier, Bruxner saw himself as loyal to Stevens, but still managed to push through several initiatives that specifically benefited rural areas, including another royal commission {{on the question of}} new States in 1935. The May 1935 election saw Stevens and Bruxner retaining government against a divided and fractious Labor opposition and Bruxner was returned unopposed again in his seat.|$|E

25|$|The Carthaginians {{advanced}} {{towards the}} walls {{at night to}} avoid being seen, with Hamilcar at the front. He {{was followed by the}} Syracusan exile Deinocrates, who commanded the cavalry. The infantry was divided in two groups, one composed of Carthaginians and the other with the Greek allies of Carthage. They were followed by <b>an</b> <b>unruly</b> crowd of camp followers who wished to profit from the eventual plunder of Syracuse. Because the roads were rough and narrow, fights broke out between the camp followers and the baggage train over the right of way. This created significant confusion and disorder in the Carthaginian ranks.|$|E
25|$|The Ottoman Empire often {{interfered}} in {{the affairs}} of Transylvania, always <b>an</b> <b>unruly</b> district, and this interference brought on a war with the Holy Roman Empire, which after some desultory operations really began in 1663. By a personal appeal to the diet at Regensburg Leopold induced the princes to send assistance for the campaign; troops were also sent by France, and in August 1664, the great Imperial general Raimondo Montecuccoli gained a notable victory at Saint Gotthard. By the Peace of Vasvár the Emperor made a twenty years' truce with the Sultan, granting more generous terms than his recent victory seemed to render necessary.|$|E
25|$|Known as {{a classic}} example of a Gentle Giant, the Saint Bernard is calm, patient and sweet with adults, and {{especially}} children. However St. Bernards, like all very large dogs, must be well socialized with people and other dogs in order to prevent fearfulness and any possible aggression or territoriality. The biggest threat to small children is being knocked over by this breed's larger size. Overall they are a sweet, gentle, calm, loyal and affectionate breed, and if socialized are very friendly. Because of its large adult size, it is essential that proper training and socialization begin while the St. Bernard is still a puppy, so as to avoid the difficulties that normally accompany training large dogs. <b>An</b> <b>unruly</b> St. Bernard may present problems for even a strong adult, so control needs to be asserted {{from the beginning of the}} dog's training. While generally not instinctively protective, a St. Bernard may bark at strangers, and their size makes them good deterrents against possible intruders.|$|E

At his request he was transferred to St. Ladislas' Church, Cleveland, and was succeeded on September 16, 1894, by Father Sigmund Wozny, who had just then come to the diocese. During 1895 Wozny had the church property enclosed by a fence, and replaced the chairs with pews, besides making other necessary improvements. Like his immediate predecessor, he found <b>an</b> <b>unruly</b> element to deal with, which, with the comparatively large parish debt, about $17,000, discouraged him, and hence he asked to be relieved from his unpleasant pastoral charge. His wish was granted, and he left the diocese in February, 1896 and was at once succeeded by Father Francis X. Fremel, who set courageously to work to put men and things to rights. He too met with opposition at the start, but with prudence and firmness he soon succeeded in surmounting the difficulties that beset him. Under his direction, seconded by the generosity of the people, the interior of the church was ornamented quite neatly, and all the requisites for divine service procured. At the same time he did not lose sight of the funded debt, but strained every nerve to have it reduced.|$|E

They urged the queen to marry or nominate an heir, {{to prevent a}} civil war upon her death. She refused to do either.

500|$|Among Shakespeare's four {{principal}} tragedies, Macbeth, {{according to}} Hazlitt in this chapter, is notable for its wild extremes of action, its preponderance of violence, and its representation of [...] "imagination" [...] strained to {{the verge of}} the forbidden and the darker mysteries of existence. [...] "This tragedy is alike distinguished for the lofty imagination it displays, and for the tumultuous vehemence of the action; and the one is made the moving principle of the other", Hazlitt writes. Macbeth [...] "moves upon the verge of an abyss, and is a constant struggle between life and death. The action is desperate and the reaction is dreadful. [...] The whole play is <b>an</b> <b>unruly</b> chaos of strange and forbidden things, where the ground rocks under our feet." ...|$|E

[...] The family settled in Northern Virginia, and McCain attended the educationally stronger St. Stephen's School in Alexandria from 1946 to 1949. [...] To his family, McCain had long been quiet, dependable, and courteous, while at St. Stephen's he began to develop <b>an</b> <b>unruly,</b> defiant streak. Another two years were then spent following his father to naval stations; altogether he attended about twenty schools during his youth. He was frequently disciplined in school for fighting. He later wrote, [...] "The repeated farewells to friends rank among the saddest regrets of a childhood constantly disrupted by the demands of my father's career... At each new school I arrived eager to make, by means of my insolent attitude, new friends {{to compensate for the}} loss of others. At each new school I grew more determined to assert my crude individualism. At each new school I became a more unrepentant pain in the neck." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 1950s, Quebec's {{industries}} {{and natural resources}} were controlled primarily by English Canadians or Americans. French-speaking Quebecers were the lowest-paid ethnic group in Quebec, {{which resulted in a}} sense that control rested with the Anglophone minority. Because of this and other factors, there had been growing discontent in the years before the riot. In early 1954, Richard's teammate, Bernie Geoffrion, was suspended in a move seen as anti-Francophone. Following the suspension, Richard, who had a weekly column in the Samedi-Dimanche newspaper, called President Campbell a [...] "dictator" [...] in print. The League in turn forced Richard to retract his statement and discontinue his column. In his 1976 biography of Richard, Jean-Marie Pellerin wrote that his humiliation was shared by all Francophone Quebecers, who were sent running once more by the [...] "English boot". This was reflected in a Montreal newspaper's editorial cartoon (pictured), which portrayed Richard as <b>an</b> <b>unruly</b> schoolboy made to write lines by Campbell, shown as the teacher; the cartoon had a deeper meaning {{as an example of the}} societal hierarchy that existed between English and French Canadians.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1888 a drunken officer was arrested by the police for causing disturbance in the street. Several officers, including Deodoro, were outraged by the arrest and insisted that {{the chief of police}} be dismissed. Wanderley, who was still heading the cabinet, refused to bow to this demand. But Princess Isabel, acting regent on behalf of her father who was in Europe, instead opted to dismiss the entire cabinet and support the so-called [...] "undisciplined military faction". Her motive was to use this incident as a pretext to replace Wanderley, who was openly against the abolition of slavery, an issue before the Parliament at the time. Although she gained a new cabinet composed of politicians who supported the end of slavery, Isabel's decision held unintended and dire consequences for the monarchy. Instead of placating <b>an</b> <b>unruly</b> military faction, it only opened the way for more audacious demands and more widespread insubordination, while exposing the weakness of the civilian power. Several officers began to openly conspire against the government, expecting that in a republic they would no longer be exposed to the [...] "harassment" [...] which they believed they were suffering under the monarchy. One of them, Floriano Peixoto, advocated adoption of a [...] "military dictatorship".|$|E

We probably wrote 24, 25 songs {{over the course of}} a couple of months. Marker commented that [...] "the business stuff ends up taking over some of that fun. We got really bogged down in people's expectations of what we were supposed to be doing, being on bigger record labels and stuff. With all that behind us, it was suddenly exciting again and it felt a lot like it did when we first formed, which was really just sort of a fun idea that we had." [...] Manson added, [...] "People at record companies live in fear of being wrong. Music cannot thrive in that environment. It is <b>an</b> <b>unruly</b> art form. You can't keep treating it like sausage meat. You have to let it morph and move and breathe." ...|$|E
500|$|In chapter seven Townsend {{details the}} sheer horror of China's ongoing civil war. Among the factions {{competing}} for power in China, Townsend believes {{that none of}} them, neither the leaders nor their men, have any fixed loyalties or higher motivations apart from desire for loot. With every man only out for himself and [...] "China's microscopically few good men... too weak to be felt", Townsend predicts {{no end to the}} chaos. Much of the violence, Townsend explains in chapter eight, is fuelled by opium, the addiction of one out of every eight Chinese. Peasants are often compelled to plant opium by local administrators and warlords to pay for their armies, {{to such an extent that}} many districts are more heavily planted with opium than food, and all the while KMT officials lie incessantly to the international community about their efforts to suppress the trade. In contrast to the depredations of the KMT and other warlords, in chapter nine Townsend praises the positive influence of the Japanese in China. The Japanese themselves are considered by him to be a loyal, brave, reliable, honest, and cleanly people, and thus the polar opposites of the Chinese. Townsend provides his own firsthand account of the Shanghai Incident of 1932, which he claims was probably provoked by Chinese aggression, and similarly sees the Japanese decision to invade Manchuria as a fitting response to the [...] "foredoomed contest of covert violence against the Japanese" [...] waged by Zhang Xueliang. Townsend also lavishes praise on the puppet state of Manchukuo as [...] "a blessing to the thirty million or so Chinese living there" [...] which has achieved [...] "stability and well-being for millions". Townsend concludes that informed observers are grateful for Japan's role in dealing with <b>an</b> <b>unruly</b> China.|$|E
