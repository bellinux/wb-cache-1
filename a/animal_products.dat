In a concession to these groups, BK agreed to adopt a series of policies for its suppliers for several of its raw <b>animal</b> <b>products.</b> The company has established a preference for purchasing eggs and pork-based products from those suppliers that use cage-free production methods.|$|E
5|$|The Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox Churches {{and their}} {{calendars}} had great influence on eating habits; consumption of meat was forbidden {{for a full}} third {{of the year for}} most Christians. All <b>animal</b> <b>products,</b> including eggs and dairy products (but not fish), were generally prohibited during Lent and fast. Additionally, it was customary for all citizens to fast prior to taking the Eucharist. These fasts were occasionally for a full day and required total abstinence.|$|E

5|$|Mercury was {{ingested}} {{through the}} consumption of homemade bread, meat and other <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> obtained from livestock given treated barley, vegetation grown from soil contaminated with mercury, game birds that had fed on the grain and fish caught in rivers, canals, and lakes into which treated grain had been dumped by the farmers. Ground seed dust inhalation was a contributing factor in farmers during sowing and grinding. Consumption of ground flour through homemade bread {{is thought to have}} been the major cause, since no cases were reported in urban areas, where government flour supplies were commercially regulated.|$|E
5|$|A cat's {{gastrointestinal}} tract {{is adapted to}} meat eating, being much shorter than that of omnivores and having low levels {{of several of the}} digestive enzymes needed to digest carbohydrates. These traits severely limit the cat's ability to digest and use plant-derived nutrients, as well as certain fatty acids. Despite the cat's meat-oriented physiology, several vegetarian or vegan cat foods have been marketed that are supplemented with chemically synthesized taurine and other nutrients, in attempts to produce a complete diet. However, some of these products still fail to provide all the nutrients cats require, and diets containing no <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> pose the risk of causing severe nutritional deficiencies. However, veterinarians in the United States have expressed concern that many domestic cats are overfed.|$|E
5|$|Among Motul de San José and {{its most}} {{important}} satellite La Trinidad de Nosotros, the majority of remains from Trinidad were from aquatic species, while at Motul de San José the majority were from terrestrial species. 10% of animal remains from Motul had been modified to form artefacts, compared with only 4% of animal remains at Trinidad. Artefact remains found at La Trinidad de Nosotros {{were more likely to}} be waste products from artefact manufacture while at Motul de San José they {{were more likely to be}} artefacts at the end of their usable life. Aquatic <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> arriving at Motul de San José were far more likely to be consumed by the elite than by commoners, whether used as food or to craft artefacts.|$|E

5|$|Carpet beetles {{are members}} of the family Dermestidae, and while the adult beetles feed on nectar and pollen, the larvae are {{destructive}} pests in homes, warehouses and museums. They feed on <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> including wool, silk, leather, fur, the bristles of hair brushes, pet hair, feathers and museum specimens. They tend to infest hidden locations and may feed on larger areas of fabrics than do clothes moths, leaving behind specks of excrement and brown, hollow, bristly-looking cast skins. Management of infestations is difficult and is based on exclusion and sanitation where possible, resorting to pesticides when necessary. The beetles can fly in from outdoors and the larvae can survive on lint fragments, dust and inside the bags of vacuum cleaners. In warehouses and museums, sticky traps baited with suitable pheromones can be used to identify problems, and heating, freezing, spraying the surface with insecticide and fumigation will kill the insects when suitably applied. Susceptible items can be protected from attack by keeping them in clean airtight containers.|$|E
5|$|Meats {{were more}} {{expensive}} than plant foods. Though rich in protein, the calorie-to-weight ratio of meat was {{less than that of}} plant food. Meat could be up to four times as expensive as bread. Fish was up to 16 times as costly, and was expensive even for coastal populations. This meant that fasts could mean an especially meager diet for those who could not afford alternatives to meat and <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> like milk and eggs. It was only after the Black Death had eradicated up to half of the European population that meat became more common even for poorer people. The drastic reduction in many populated areas resulted in a labor shortage, meaning that wages dramatically increased. It also left vast areas of farmland untended, making them available for pasture and putting more meat on the market.|$|E
5|$|Prose {{works in}} Sanskrit was {{prolific}} during this era as well. Important mathematical theories and axioms were postulated by Mahaviracharya, {{a native of}} Gulbarga, who belonged to the Karnataka mathematical tradition and was patronised by King Amoghavarsha I. His greatest contribution was Ganitasarasangraha, a writing in 9 chapters. Somadevasuri of 950 wrote {{in the court of}} Arikesari II, a feudatory of Rashtrakuta Krishna III in Vemulavada. He was the author of Yasastilaka champu, Nitivakyamrita and other writings. The main aim of the champu writing was to propagate Jain tenets and ethics. The second writing reviews the subject matter of Arthashastra from the standpoint of Jain morals in a clear and pithy manner. Ugraditya, a Jain ascetic from Hanasoge in the modern Mysore district wrote a medical treatise called Kalyanakaraka. He delivered a discourse in the court of Amoghavarsha I encouraging abstinence from <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> and alcohol in medicine.|$|E

5|$|The {{period between}} c. 500 and 1300 saw {{a major change}} in diet that {{affected}} most of Europe. More intense agriculture on an ever-increasing acreage resulted in a shift from <b>animal</b> <b>products,</b> like meat and dairy, to various grains and vegetables as the staple of the majority population. Before the 14th century bread was not as common among the lower classes, especially in the north where wheat was more difficult to grow. A bread-based diet became gradually more common during the 15th century and replaced warm intermediate meals that were porridge- or gruel-based. Leavened bread was more common in wheat-growing regions in the south, while unleavened flatbread of barley, rye or oats remained more common in northern and highland regions, and unleavened flatbread was also common as provisions for troops.|$|E
25|$|Impacts from {{agriculture}} {{are expected}} to increase substantially due to population growth and increasing consumption of <b>animal</b> <b>products.</b> Unlike fossil fuels, {{it is difficult to}} look for alternatives: people have to eat.

25|$|During Lent some Christian communities, such as Orthodox Christians in the Middle East, {{undertake}} partial fasting eating {{only one}} light meal per day. For strict Greek Orthodox Christians and Copts, all meals during this 40-day period are prepared without <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> and are essentially vegan. Unlike veganism however, abstaining from <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> during Lent {{is intended to}} be only temporary and not a permanent way of life.|$|E

5|$|Some {{processes}} {{convert a}} meat or dairy product into a pareve (neither meat nor dairy) one. For example, rennet is sometimes made from stomach linings, yet is acceptable for making kosher cheese, but such cheeses {{might not be}} acceptable to some vegetarians, who would eat only cheese made from a vegetarian rennet. The same applies to kosher gelatin, an <b>animal</b> <b>product,</b> derived from kosher animal sources. Other gelatin-like products from non-animal sources such as agar agar and carrageenan are pareve by nature. Fish gelatin is derived from fish and is therefore (like all kosher fish products) pareve. Eggs are also considered pareve despite being an <b>animal</b> <b>product.</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} two decades, China's per capita <b>animal</b> <b>product</b> {{consumption}} has increased remarkably. Based on the data published by China's State Statistical Bureau (SSBa), in rural areas, per capita meat consumption had increased from 9. 4 kg in 1981 to 17. 7 kg in 2002. During the same period, per capita egg consumption increased from 1. 3 kg to 4. 7 kg, and per capita aquatic products from 1. 3 kg to 4. 4 kg. The corresponding figures for urban areas are 20. 5 kg to 32. 5 kg (meat), 5. 2 kg to 10. 6 kg (eggs), and 7. 3 kg to 13. 2 kg (aquatic products) (SSBa 2003, pp. 352, 374). There are, however, significant differences in <b>animal</b> <b>product</b> consumption between rural and urban residents, {{the rich and the}} poor, and between different regions. Some have examined the rural-urban differences and the difference between {{the rich and the poor}} (see, for example, Wu and Li 1995, Cai ef at. 1999, Wang and Fan 1999, Wang and Yang 2003). Literature examining variations between regions has been scarce. This study looks into the regional variations of China's <b>animal</b> <b>product</b> consumption. In the next section, we first present the general trend in <b>animal</b> <b>product</b> consumption in China and highlight consumption gap between rural and urban residents and between the rich and the poor. We then discuss the difference in animal production consumption between regions. Subsequently, we report the findings of an empirical analysis on regional consumer responses to price and income changes. ...|$|R

25|$|Veganism is {{both the}} {{practice}} of abstaining {{from the use of}} <b>animal</b> <b>products,</b> particularly in diet, and an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of animals. A follower of either the diet or the philosophy is known as a vegan. Distinctions are sometimes made between several categories of veganism. Dietary vegans (or strict vegetarians) refrain from consuming <b>animal</b> <b>products,</b> not only meat but also eggs, dairy products and other animal-derived substances. The term ethical vegan is often applied to those who not only follow a vegan diet but extend the philosophy into other areas of their lives, and oppose the use of animals for any purpose. Another term is environmental veganism, which refers to the avoidance of <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> on the premise that the harvesting or industrial farming of animals is environmentally damaging and unsustainable.|$|E

25|$|An {{argument}} {{proposed by}} Bruce Friedrich, also a protectionist, holds that strict adherence to veganism harms animals, because {{it focuses on}} personal purity, rather than encouraging people to give up whatever <b>animal</b> <b>products</b> they can. For Francione, {{this is similar to}} arguing that, because human-rights abuses can never be eliminated, we should not defend human rights in situations we control. By failing to ask a server whether something contains <b>animal</b> <b>products,</b> we reinforce that the moral rights of animals are a matter of convenience, he argues. He concludes from this that the protectionist position fails on its own consequentialist terms.|$|E
