5|$|Djedkare is well attested in sources {{contemporaneous}} {{with his}} reign. The tombs {{of many of}} his courtiers and family members have been discovered in Giza, Saqqara and Abusir. They give insights into the administrative reforms that Djedkare conducted during his reign <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> cases, even record letters that the king sent to his officials. These letters, inscribed on the walls of tombs, typically present royal praises for the tomb owner.|$|E
5|$|The {{church does}} not require that Christian Scientists avoid all medical care—adherents use dentists, optometrists, obstetricians, {{physicians}} for broken bones, and vaccination when required by law—but maintains that Christian-Science prayer is most effective when not combined with medicine. Between the 1880s and 1990s the avoidance of medical treatment led {{to the deaths of}} several adherents and their children. Parents and others were prosecuted for, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> cases convicted of, manslaughter or neglect.|$|E
5|$|Battles {{play out}} using a turn-based system where each unit {{on both sides}} is given their chance to move and act. Characters move and attack within the same turn, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> cases units can take two moves in a turn. A key part of combat is the Weapons Triangle, a new {{addition}} which governs the opposing {{strengths and weaknesses of}} weapon types based on a rock–paper–scissors system - lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. A secondary system governs the magic system, where Fire, Lightning, and Wind spells have varying strengths and weaknesses against each other. Each unit has a character class which determines their weapon, skill set, movement and attack range, how much effect they have on other units, which latent skills they possess, and whether they use passive or aggressive skills when in combat. Different weapon types also affect character movement and battle performance: for instance, a powerful sword deals damage while slowing a character's movement.|$|E

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the Paleozoic, around 400 Mya, the brachiopods were among the most {{abundant}} filter feeders in the ocean, and over 12,000 fossil species are recognized. By the PermianTriassic extinction event 250 Mya, bivalves were undergoing a huge radiation of diversity. The bivalves were hard hit by this event, but re-established themselves and thrived during the Triassic period that followed. In contrast, the brachiopods lost 95% of their species diversity. The ability of some bivalves to burrow and thus avoid predators may have been a major factor in their success. Other new adaptations within various families allowed species to occupy previously unused evolutionary niches. These included increasing relative buoyancy in soft sediments by developing spines on the shell, gaining the ability to swim, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> cases, adopting predatory habits.|$|E
5|$|Cicadas are not major {{agricultural}} pests {{but in some}} outbreak years, trees may be overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of females laying their eggs in the shoots. Small trees may wilt and larger trees may lose small branches. Although in general, the feeding activities of the nymphs do little damage, during the year before an outbreak of periodic cicadas, the large nymphs feed heavily and plant growth may suffer. Some species have turned from wild grasses to sugar cane, and this has affected the crop adversely, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> isolated cases, females have oviposited on food crops such as date palms, grape vines, citrus trees, asparagus and cotton.|$|E
5|$|For {{decades after}} the {{discovery}} of GRBs, astronomers searched for a counterpart at other wavelengths: i.e., any astronomical object in positional coincidence with a recently observed burst. Astronomers considered many distinct classes of objects, including white dwarfs, pulsars, supernovae, globular clusters, quasars, Seyfert galaxies, and BL Lac objects. All such searches were unsuccessful, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> cases particularly well-localized bursts (those whose positions were determined with {{what was then a}} high degree of accuracy) could be clearly shown to have no bright objects of any nature consistent with the position derived from the detecting satellites. This suggested an origin of either very faint stars or extremely distant galaxies. Even the most accurate positions contained numerous faint stars and galaxies, and it was widely agreed that final resolution of the origins of cosmic gamma-ray bursts would require both new satellites and faster communication.|$|E

5|$|For the box set release, Quatermass and the Pit was {{extensively}} restored. A {{process called}} VidFIRE {{was applied to}} all of the scenes originally broadcast live, restoring the fluid interlaced video look they would have had on transmission, but which was lost during the telerecording process. For the pre-filmed scenes, most of the high-quality original 35mm film inserts still existed, as they had been spliced into the 1959–60 compilation repeat version in place of the lower-quality telerecorded versions of the same sequences. As this compilation also survived in the BBC archives, these film sequences were able to be digitally remastered and inserted into the newly restored episodic version for the DVD release. The compilation used a separate magnetic soundtrack, and although the original had decayed a safety copy had survived. This yielded better sound quality than the optical soundtracks accompanying the original episodes, and was therefore the main source for the audio remastering except in the case of scenes that were not in the compilation, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> cases where faults on the magnetic tracks necessitated their replacement by the optical versions.|$|E
5|$|In {{the remains}} of a small cabin in the bow of the ship <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> other {{locations}} around the wreck was found the earliest dated set of navigation instruments in Europe found so far: compasses, divider calipers, a stick used for charting, protractors, sounding leads, tide calculators and a logreel, an instrument for calculating speed. Several of these objects are not only unique in having such an early, definite dating, but also because they pre-date written records of their use; protractors would have reasonably been used to measure bearings and courses on maps, but sea charts are not known to have been used by English navigators {{during the first half of}} the 16th century, compasses were not depicted on English ships until the 1560s, and the first mention of a logreel is from 1574.|$|E
5|$|Most {{species of}} starfish are gonochorous, there being {{separate}} {{male and female}} individuals. These are usually not distinguishable externally as the gonads cannot be seen, but their sex is apparent when they spawn. Some species are simultaneous hermaphrodites, producing eggs and sperm {{at the same time}} <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> of these, the same gonad, called an ovotestis, produces both eggs and sperm. Other starfish are sequential hermaphrodites. Protandrous individuals of species like Asterina gibbosa start life as males before changing sex into females as they grow older. In some species such as Nepanthia belcheri, a large female can split in half and the resulting offspring are males. When these grow large enough they change back into females.|$|E

5|$|The {{youngest}} terrain {{observed on}} Ariel are the plains: relatively low-lying smooth areas {{that must have}} formed {{over a long period}} of time, judging by their varying levels of cratering. The plains are found on the floors of canyons <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> irregular depressions in the middle of the cratered terrain. In the latter case they are separated from the cratered terrain by sharp boundaries, which in some cases have a lobate pattern. The most likely origin for the plains is through volcanic processes; their linear vent geometry, resembling terrestrial shield volcanoes, and distinct topographic margins suggest that the erupted liquid was very viscous, possibly a supercooled water/ammonia solution, with solid ice volcanism also a possibility. The thickness of these hypothetical cryolava flows is estimated at 1–3km. The canyons must therefore have formed at a time when endogenic resurfacing was still taking place on Ariel. A few of these areas appear to be less than 100 million years old, suggesting that Ariel may still be geologically active in spite of its relatively small size and lack of current tidal heating.|$|E
