Hogarth receives a package from Rogard, a bolt from the Giant being the only remnant they could find. That night, Hogarth sees the bolt trying to move on its own, and he opens the window, letting the bolt roll free. The bolt joins many other parts as they converge on the Giant's head on the Langjökull glacier in Iceland. The Giant's head activates, and he smiles <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> itself back together.|$|E

500|$|Conatus is {{a central}} theme in the {{philosophy}} of Benedict de Spinoza (1632–1677). According to Spinoza, [...] "each thing, as far as it lies in itself, strives to persevere in its being" [...] (Ethics, part 3, prop. 6). Spinoza presents a few reasons for believing this. First, particular things are, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> it, modes of God, which means that each one expresses the power of God in a particular way (Ethics, part 3, prop. 6, dem.). Moreover, it could never be part of the definition of God that his modes contradict one another (Ethics, part 3, prop. 5); each thing, therefore, [...] "is opposed to everything which can take its existence away" [...] (Ethics, part 3, prop. 6, dem.). This resistance to destruction is formulated by Spinoza in terms of a striving to continue to exist, and conatus is the word he most often uses to describe this force.|$|E
500|$|Author Elliot Huntley views Living in the Material World as {{a concept}} album on which the material–spiritual [...] "quandary" [...] evident in the title track is [...] "eloquently expressed" [...] through the artwork's mix of {{religious}} symbolism and an inner-gatefold photograph that showed [...] " [...] band indulging in a gratuitously sumptuous feast". The stretch-limousine image was a detail taken from this photo, the concept for which reflected Harrison's view that the material world is not only related to money and possessions, but to [...] "everything which is gross, physical, or material {{as opposed to the}} subtle, astral or casual", <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> it in I, Me, Mine when discussing the song. NME critic Bob Woffinden also commented on the symbolism of this picture showing [...] "Harrison with his musicians (Nicky Hopkins, Klaus Voormann, Jim Keltner, Ringo – the usual lot) enjoying a hearty repast, passing the no-doubt vintage wine, while in the background the longest limousine in the world awaits their convenience".|$|E
500|$|Harrison taped {{the basic}} track for {{his version of}} [...] "Far East Man" [...] at Friar Park over August and September 1974, during {{sessions}} for his album Dark Horse. Having [...] "brushed up the lyrics a bit", <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> it in I, Me, Mine, Harrison retained Newmark and Weeks from the sessions with Wood, and brought in keyboard player Billy Preston and saxophonist and arranger Tom Scott, both of whom would also be part of his all-American tour band. Leng describes [...] "Far East Man" [...] as [...] "the first Harisong to tap into 1970s soul" [...] and notes the [...] "supreme soul credentials" [...] of Newmark, as the former drummer with Sly and the Family Stone, and Weeks, who had supplied the highly regarded basslines on Donny Hathaway Live (1972). Newmark later recalled of his and Weeks' first sessions for Harrison: [...] "We were completely thrilled {{to be asked to}} play on his record … It was the most exciting thing to happen to me. I had to keep pinching myself to remember it was real." ...|$|E

500|$|In an {{interview}} for USA Today, D'Angelo said of the album's title and its meaning, [...] "the myriad influences found on it can be traced through the blues and back deeper in history through songs sung–in religious [...] ceremonies." [...] In {{an interview}} for Jet magazine, he stated that his intentions for recording the album were to express the power of music and artistic respect for it. The theme is illustrated in Voodoos liner photography by Thierry LesGoudes, which depicts D'Angelo participating in a voodoo ceremony. Voodoos press release discussed D'Angelo's concept, stating [...] "Lyrically, D'Angelo offers that much of Voodoo is personal reflection: touching on subjects like spirituality, sexuality, growth, and in particular, becoming a father. Musically, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> it, Voodoo is 'definitely groove-based'". D'Angelo also said that [...] "My inspiration was just to go farther. To get to that next level. To push it even further. To work against the floss and the grain and to get even deeper into the sound that I'm hearing ... and the thing is, I'm just looking at Voodoo as just the beginning. I'm still developing and growing and still listening to that sound I hear inside my head ... So {{this is the first}} step".|$|E
500|$|After Wally goes AWOL for {{a second}} day, David is pressed into service. [...] He admits to Karros and the judge in {{chambers}} {{that he has never}} seen the inside of a courtroom. [...] Karros, in a moment of humanity, offers a deal: if David finishes the trial, she will not pursue sanctions against Finley & Figg. [...] Judge Seawright offers to help David through the trial and adds that Finley & Figg probably won't suffer from any malpractice lawsuits if the trial goes through. [...] David agrees to finish the trial but there is hardly any real case for him to present. Karros tears to pieces the main Finley & Figg expert witness: a Russian doctor of very questionable credentials and whose English is atrocious even after fifteen years in the U.S. The second expert, an equally shady pharmacologist, escapes without testifying, pocketing the $50,000 he got from Finley & Figg. Rueben Massey, Varrick's CEO, instructs Karros not to move for likely successful summary judgment, he is determined to have a jury clear Krayoxx of all charges and Varrick's public relations machine stands ready to trumpet this decision in all the media. Zinc declineS to cross-examine the row of expert witnesses that Varrick calls, all having impeccable credentials and David having no facts with which to shake their defense of Krayoxx. Rather, he spends the time studying Karros' methods, [...] "learning from a master", <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> it in his own mind.|$|E

He characterizes the perception of children as a misperception of referents that are undoubtedly as present for them as they are for grown-ups. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> it, they may not know that [...] "the house is dilapidated", but {{there is no}} doubt about their seeing the house. After-images are dismissed as presenting no problem for the Transparency Theory because, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>puts</b> it, after-images being illusory, there is nothing that one sees.|$|E
