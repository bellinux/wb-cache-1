This was dubbed the [...] "Grassi's Law", which is formulated as: infected man + anopheles mosquitoes = malaria. Although the equation is straightforwardly correct, the reverse implication is not so. In many areas, he himself had noted that where anopheline vectors were abundant, malaria {{was not at all}} prevalent, and sometimes absent. This caused <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>problem</b> in understanding malaria epidemiology for some time. In fact, in 1919 he identified three typical malaria prevalent localities, but which were not affected by malaria in the same way, such as the gardens of Schito near Naples, Massarosa in Tuscany, and Alberone in Lombardia. In 1921, after repeated assessment, he concluded with the assumption of the existence of races of Anopheles, that there were morphologically indistinguishable mosquitoes that do not bite humans, and that therefore did not play a role as vectors.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Modern wind {{turbines}} are characterised by high, complex loads and by relatively light weight, optimised structures. The load bearing structural components in {{wind turbines}} are mostly made of large, elaborately shaped iron castings and steel fabrications. Complex, varying loads call for analysis methods {{to consider the}} different phase relationships between the loads acting on the components. These cause variations in stress directions, usually termed as multiaxiality. One {{problem is that the}} limitation of brittle materials, such as cast iron, to withstand multi-axial stresses is <b>a</b> <b>little</b> known <b>problem</b> outside the research centres. This paper intends to focus on the effect of high fatigue stresses and multiaxiality on wind turbine components and discusses the results of recent collaborative research work carried out at GL Wind. ...|$|R
