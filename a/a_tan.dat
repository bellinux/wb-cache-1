5|$|Their coat differs geographically, with elands {{in north}} Africa having {{distinctive}} markings (torso stripes, markings on legs, dark garters and a spinal crest) that are absent in the south. Apart from a rough mane, the coat is smooth. Females have <b>a</b> <b>tan</b> coat, while the coats of males are darker, with a bluish-grey tinge. Bulls {{may also have}} a series of vertical white stripes on their sides (mainly in parts of the Karoo in South Africa). As males age, their coat becomes more grey. Males also have dense fur on their foreheads and a large dewlap on their throats.|$|E
5|$|Dominic Purcell as Lincoln Burrows: Lincoln is a {{high school}} {{drop-out}} and a convicted felon, who is wrongfully accused of and charged {{with the murder of}} Terence Steadman, the brother of the Vice President of the United States. Purcell was cast three days before the start of production and consequently, he was the last actor to join the original cast. He auditioned for the role while he had a recurring role as Tommy Ravetto on North Shore. Since working on John Doe, Purcell has had an amiable relationship with Fox. Hence, he was sent the pilot script of Prison Break. Scheuring's first impression of Purcell did not convince him as a fit for the role since the actor went to the audition with his hair styled and <b>a</b> <b>tan.</b> However, Purcell's acting won the role. He arrived on the set {{on the first day of}} filming with a shaved head, which amazed Scheuring with the physical likeness of the series' two leading actors.|$|E

5|$|The jackal's fur is coarse and {{relatively}} short, with the base color golden, varying seasonally from a pale creamy yellow {{to a dark}} tawny. The fur on the back is composed of a mixture of black, brown, and white hairs, sometimes giving {{the appearance of the}} dark saddle like that seen on the black-backed jackal. The underparts are a light pale ginger to cream color. Individual specimens can be distinguished by their unique light markings on the throat and chest. The coats of jackals from high elevations tend to be more buff-colored than those of their lowland counterparts while those of jackals in rocky, mountainous areas may exhibit a grayer shade. The bushy tail has <b>a</b> <b>tan</b> to black tip. Melanism can cause a dark-colored coat in some golden jackals, a coloring once fairly common in Bengal. Unlike melanistic wolves and coyotes that received their dark pigmentation from interbreeding with domestic dogs, melanism in golden jackals probably stems from an independent mutation that could be an adaptive trait. What is possibly an albino specimen was photographed in southeastern Iran during 2012.|$|E
25|$|On navy caps, {{the peak}} and {{chinstrap}} {{of the service}} cap are always black. The cap band is black {{with the exception of}} navy military police, who wear a scarlet cap band, and members of Canadian Special Operations Forces Command, who wear <b>a</b> <b>tan</b> cap band.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{pale skin}} was {{considered}} most attractive. However, tanned skin became increasingly popular after Coco Chanel showed off <b>a</b> <b>tan</b> after a holiday – it suggested {{a life of}} leisure, without the onerous need to work. Women wanted to look fit, sporty, and, above all, healthy.|$|E

25|$|The unknown man had {{a slender}} build, short grey hair, and {{appeared}} to be in his late 50s or early 60s. He stood five feet and ten and a half inches tall with blue eyes and <b>a</b> <b>tan</b> complexion. From witness reports, the man was of Germanic descent and spoke with a thick German accent. He was neatly groomed; his face was shaven and his hair was clean and combed.|$|E
25|$|There are two {{different}} mechanisms involved in production of <b>a</b> <b>tan</b> by UV exposure: Firstly, UVA radiation creates oxidative stress, which in turn oxidises existing melanin and leads to rapid darkening of the melanin. UVA may also cause melanin to be redistributed (released from melanocytes where it is already stored), but its total quantity is unchanged. Skin darkening from UVA exposure {{does not lead to}} significantly increased production of melanin or protection against sunburn.|$|E

25|$|On 27 September 1917 {{with his}} score at 12, he {{received}} the first Pfalz D.III assigned to his Jasta. The Pfalz would almost end his life. Kroll apparently still used his Albatros D.V, marked with a taijitu on <b>a</b> <b>tan</b> background. Kroll considered the Pfalz to be the Albatros's inferior in performance; He thought the Pfalz the slower of the two planes, climbed no better, but could be faster in a dive. Whichever aircraft he used, he rounded off 1917 by scoring his 15th victory on 4 December.|$|E
25|$|Coat colour {{is white}} {{with a black}} mantle and black markings, {{including}} black or blue ticking on the body and tan ticking on the lower legs. Frequently <b>a</b> <b>tan</b> marking is found {{on the base of}} the upper thigh, which is called the 'roe buck mark'. Faults are listed as deviations in appearance or structure that {{have an effect on the}} health and working ability of the dog, as well as the appearance, and indicate that the dog with such faults should not be bred. Some of the faults listed are aggression or shyness, lack of pigmentation, off-colour, excessive dewlap, and frail limbs.|$|E
25|$|Kimonos are {{traditionally}} {{made from a}} single bolt of fabric called <b>a</b> <b>tan.</b> Tan come in standard dimensions—about 36 centimetres wide and 11.5 metres long—and the entire bolt is used to make one kimono. The finished kimono consists of four main strips of fabric—two panels covering the body and two panels forming the sleeves—with additional smaller strips forming the narrow front panels and collar. Historically, kimonos were often taken apart for washing as separate panels and resewn by hand. Because the entire bolt remains in the finished garment without cutting, the kimono can be retailored easily to fit another person.|$|E

25|$|Sun tanning {{or simply}} tanning {{is the process}} whereby skin color is darkened or tanned. It is most often a result of {{exposure}} to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight or from artificial sources, such as <b>a</b> <b>tanning</b> lamp found in indoor tanning beds. People who deliberately tan their skin by exposure to the sun engage in a passive recreational activity of sun bathing. Some people use chemical products which can produce <b>a</b> <b>tanning</b> effect without exposure to ultraviolet radiation, known as sunless tanning.|$|R
25|$|As {{a defense}} against UV radiation, {{the amount of the}} brown pigment melanin in the skin {{increases}} when exposed to moderate (depending on skin type) levels of radiation; this is commonly known as a sun tan. The purpose of melanin is to absorb UV radiation and dissipate the energy as harmless heat, blocking the UV from damaging skin tissue. UVA gives a quick tan that lasts for days by oxidizing melanin that was already present and triggers the release of the melanin from melanocytes. UVB yields <b>a</b> <b>tan</b> that takes roughly 2 days to develop because it stimulates the body to produce more melanin.|$|E
25|$|Trooper uniforms {{are made}} of grey wool, with the {{exception}} of the Gore-Tex jacket. Prior to 1958, uniforms (shirts, jackets and britches) were not grey, but made of equal parts white fiber and black fiber to symbolize the impartiality of justice. The NYSP is one of only five state police forces that do not wear a badge on their uniform shirts. Like a U.S. Flag, trooper uniforms are burned when no longer serviceable. The black stripe down the leg of the trouser is worn in remembrance of fallen comrades. The purple color of the tie and hat band represents an elite unit. Troopers wear <b>a</b> <b>tan</b> felt stetson hat with a leather security strap and purple band around it.|$|E
25|$|In the Canadian Army, regiments {{designated}} horse {{guards and}} dragoon guards, {{along with the}} Canadian Special Operations Regiment, have regimental standards. Royal Canadian Armoured Corps standards have a crimson field and the CSOR standard has <b>a</b> <b>tan</b> field. Other RCAC regiments have crimson regimental guidons. Each battalion of the Royal Canadian Infantry Corps, except those of rifle regiments, has a stand of two colours: a queen's colour and a regimental colour. For foot guards, the queen's colours have a crimson field, and the regimental colours {{are based on the}} Canadian national flag. For other infantry regiments, the queen's colours are based on the national flag, and the regimental colours are of the regimental facing colour. Only the Royal Canadian Artillery uses guns for its colours.|$|E
