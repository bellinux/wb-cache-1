25|$|More subtle {{cases of}} {{syntactic}} patterns sensitive to <b>alienability</b> {{are found in}} many languages. For example, French can use a definite article rather than the possessive (ses) with body parts.|$|E
25|$|Hawaiian uses {{different}} prepositions to mark possession {{depending on}} <b>alienability.</b> a (alienable of) {{is used to}} indicate alienable possession, as in (13a) and (14a), whereas o (inalienable of) indicates inalienable possession.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{distinction}} between a (alienable of) and o (inalienable of) is used for other semantic distinctions less clearly attributable to common <b>alienability</b> relationships except in metaphorical ways. Although lei is a tangible object, in Hawaiian this noun can be either alienable (15a) or inalienable (15b) depending on the context.|$|E
25|$|In general, the alienable–inalienable {{distinction}} {{is an example}} of a binary possessive class system, i.e., a language in which two kinds of possession are distinguished (alienable and inalienable). The <b>alienability</b> {{distinction is}} the most common kind of binary possessive class system, but it is not the only one. Some languages have more than two possessive classes: the Anêm language of Papua New Guinea, for example, has at least 20 and Amele language has 32.|$|E
25|$|<b>Alienability</b> {{can only}} be {{expressed}} in attributive possession constructions, not in predicative possession. Attributive possession {{is a type of}} possession in which the possessor and possessee form a phrase. This contrasts to predicative possession constructions, in which the possessor and possessee are part of a clause and the verb affirms the possessive relationship. The examples in (21) express the same alienable relationship between possessor and possessee, but illustrate the difference between attributive and predicative possession.|$|E
25|$|The {{distinction}} between alienable and inalienable possessions can {{be influenced by}} cognitive factors. Languages, such as English, that do not encode the <b>alienability</b> distinction in their grammar rely on the real-world relationship between the possessed noun and possessor noun. Nouns that are “inherently relational” and whose possession {{is associated with a}} single, dominant interpretation (e.g. mother), are of the inalienable type, whereas nouns whose possession is open to interpretation (e.g. car), are of the alienable type.|$|E
25|$|Old Rapa is the {{indigenous}} language of Rapa Iti, {{an island of}} French Polynesia located within its Bass Islands archipelago. Within the language structure of Rapa there exists two primary possessive particles, a and o. The usage of these two particles {{is dependent on the}} relation between the possessor and the object. When words of the language are categorized by possessive particles, there is a very close resemblance to the usage of the possessive particle and the object’s <b>alienability.</b> However, this relation is better defined by William Wilson in his article Proto-Polynesian Possessive Marking.|$|E
25|$|Although the {{relationships}} listed above {{are likely to}} be instances of inalienable possession, ultimately what is classified as inalienable depends on language- and culture-specific conventions. It is impossible to say that a particular relationship is an example of inalienable possession without specifying the languages for which this holds true. For example, neighbor may be an inalienable noun in one language, but alienable in another. Thus, whether a certain type of relationship is described as alienable or inalienable can be arbitrary, and in this respect <b>alienability</b> is similar to other types of noun classes, such as grammatical gender.|$|E
25|$|Roman law {{was heavily}} {{influenced}} by Greek philosophy, but its detailed rules were developed by professional jurists and were highly sophisticated. Over the centuries between the rise and decline of the Roman Empire, law was adapted {{to cope with the}} changing social situations and underwent major codification under Theodosius II and Justinian I. Although codes were replaced by custom and case law during the Dark Ages, Roman law was rediscovered around the 11th century when medieval legal scholars began to research Roman codes and adapt their concepts. Latin legal maxims (called brocards) were compiled for guidance. In medieval England, royal courts developed a body of precedent which later became the common law. A Europe-wide Law Merchant was formed so that merchants could trade with common standards of practice rather than with the many splintered facets of local laws. The Law Merchant, a precursor to modern commercial law, emphasised the freedom to contract and <b>alienability</b> of property. As nationalism grew in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Law Merchant was incorporated into countries' local law under new civil codes. The Napoleonic and German Codes became the most influential. In contrast to English common law, which consists of enormous tomes of case law, codes in small books are easy to export and easy for judges to apply. However, today there are signs that civil and common law are converging. EU law is codified in treaties, but develops through the precedent laid down by the European Court of Justice.|$|E
2500|$|Since the <b>alienability</b> {{distinction}} {{is rooted in}} semantics, in languages like English where there are few morphological or syntactic distinctions sensitive to <b>alienability,</b> ambiguities occur.

2500|$|Throughout history, {{human organs}} have {{acquired}} different characteristics, acting as both alienable and inalienable possessions {{depending on the}} temporal and spatial context. Alienable possessions are objects that can be bought and sold, while inalienable possessions are things that must be kept due to their relationships with an individual's identity and origins. During the 17th century, human organs were represented as inalienable possessions, that is, objects {{that could not be}} given away in exchange and their use by the medical profession was associated with violent actions. However, once the medical value of bodies was recognized, there was an increase in its commodification which was not legally acknowledged until the Anatomy Act, which prohibited the selling of bodies, was signed in 1832. In reality, consensus over the sale of bodies and body parts had not been reached, and as Locke as argued, [...] "competition over corpses and body parts existed because ideas about their value and beliefs about their <b>alienability</b> varied among contenders". Currently, different representations of organs and other body parts coexist blurring the lines between <b>alienability</b> and inalienability.|$|E
60|$|Whoever seriously {{considers}} the excellent argument of Lord Somers, in the Bankers' Case, will see he bottoms himself upon {{the very same}} maxim which I do; {{and one of his}} principal grounds of doctrine for the <b>alienability</b> of the domain in England,[41] contrary to the maxim of the law in France, he lays in the constitutional policy of furnishing a permanent reward to public service, of making that reward the origin of families, and the foundation of wealth as well as of honors. It is, indeed, the only genuine, unadulterated origin of nobility. It is a great principle in government, a principle at the very foundation of the whole structure. The other judges who held the same doctrine went beyond Lord Somers with regard to the remedy which they thought was given by law against the crown upon the grant of pensions. Indeed, no man knows, when he cuts off the incitements to a virtuous ambition, and the just rewards of public service, what infinite mischief he may do his country through all generations. Such saving to the public may prove the worst mode of robbing it. The crown, which has in its hands the trust of the daily pay for national service, ought to have in its hands also the means for the repose of public labor and the fixed settlement of acknowledged merit. There is a time when the weather-beaten, vessels of the state ought to come into harbor. They must at length have a retreat from the malice of rivals, from the perfidy of political friends, and the inconstancy of the people. Many of the persons who in all times have filled the great offices of state have been younger brothers, who had originally little, if any fortune. These offices do not furnish the means of amassing wealth. There ought to be some power in the crown of granting pensions {{out of the reach of}} its own caprices. An entail of dependence is a bad reward of merit.|$|E

50|$|Although {{systems of}} this type are {{generally}} described with the terms alienable and inalienable, this terminology is not particularly appropriate for Choctaw, since <b>alienability</b> implies a semantic distinction between types of nouns.

50|$|In Mohegan any noun can be possessed, however, {{there is}} a {{distinction}} in possessive relationships {{and that is the}} <b>alienability</b> distinction. Some nouns are able to stand alone without showing possession (alienable), while others must show a possessor (inalienable).|$|E
50|$|While it {{is common}} for Polynesian {{languages}} to distinguish between <b>alienability</b> and inalienability with a and o possessives, {{this is not the case}} for Vaeakau-Taumako.

50|$|<b>Alienability</b> is the {{capacity}} of a given commodity to be separated, physically and morally, from its seller. If a commodity is not alienable, it cannot be exchanged and is thus shielded from the market.

50|$|An Anti-alienation clause is a {{provision}} in the governing document for an arrangement such as a trust that specifies that the beneficial or equitable owner of the property held in that arrangement cannot transfer the interest to a third party.

50|$|Like nouns in many Native American languages, the Tlingit noun {{is easily}} {{conceptualized}} but difficult to formally define.

50|$|Another type of <b>alienability</b> is in constructions {{where the}} possessed nouns occur in {{apposition}} with a possessive classifier.
