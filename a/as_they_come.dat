5|$|In March 2010, the Department of Defence {{revealed}} that the generators {{in five of the}} submarines were flawed and had to be replaced. The three Australian-made generators aboard each of the five submarines (the generators aboard Collins were French-built, and exhibited no defects) are to be replaced in the submarines <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> in for their next maintenance docking.|$|E

5|$|The {{scientific}} and technological impact of extraterrestrial contact through electromagnetic waves would probably be quite small, especially at first. However, if the message contains {{a large amount of}} information, deciphering it could give humans access to a galactic heritage perhaps predating the human species itself, which may greatly advance our technology and science. A possible negative effect could be to demoralize research scientists <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> to know that what they are researching may already be known to another civilization.|$|E
5|$|Care Bears Movie II: A New Generation is a 1986 Canadian-American {{animated}} fantasy film {{produced by}} LBS Communications, Inc. and Nelvana. The third animated feature from Nelvana, it {{was directed by}} Dale Schott, written by Peter Sauder and produced by Nelvana's three founders (Michael Hirsh, Patrick Loubert and Clive A. Smith). It stars the voices of Alyson Court, Cree Summer, Maxine Miller and Hadley Kay. In the second film based on the Care Bears franchise, a character called The Great Wishing Star (voiced by Chris Wiggins) tells {{the origins of the}} Care Bears, and the story of their first Caring Mission. True Heart Bear and Noble Heart Horse lead the other Care Bears and Care Bear Cousins, <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> to the aid of Christy, a young camper who is tempted by an evil shape-shifting figure named Dark Heart. This is also the first appearance of the Care Bear Cubs, who also had their own line of toys.|$|E
5|$|The crew {{discover}} a wrecked Borg scout ship {{with a single}} survivor: a young Borg drone. Dr. Beverly Crusher (Gates McFadden) insists on treating the surviving Borg despite the concerns of Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). On Picard's orders, the drone is confined and monitored by security forces at all times and is prevented from contacting the Borg Collective. Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) and Lt. Commander Data assist Crusher in bringing the Borg back to health. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> to understand {{the workings of the}} Borg, La Forge and Data postulate an idea of using the Borg drone as a weapon of mass destruction. By implanting an unsolvable geometric formula into his mind and returning him back to the Collective, the formula should rapidly spread (similar to a computer virus) and disable the Borg. Crusher is aghast at this suggestion, considering it equivalent to genocide, while Picard and the other senior crew deliberate on the ethics of this plan.|$|E

5|$|Andrei (Anatoly Solonitsyn), Daniil (Nikolai Grinko) and Kirill (Ivan Lapikov) are {{wandering}} monks and religious icon painters, looking for work. The three represent different creative characters. Andrei is the observer, a humanist who {{searches for the}} good in people and wants to inspire and not frighten. Daniil is withdrawn and resigned, and not as bent on creativity as on self-realization. Kirill lacks talent as a painter, yet still strives to achieve prominence. He is jealous, self-righteous, very intelligent and perceptive. The three have just left the Andronikov Monastery, where they have lived for many years, heading to Moscow. During a heavy rain shower they seek shelter in a barn, {{where a group of}} villagers is being entertained by a jester (Rolan Bykov). The jester, or skomorokh, is a bitterly sarcastic enemy {{of the state and the}} Church, who earns a living with his scathing and obscene social commentary and by making fun of the Boyars. He ridicules the monks <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> in, and after some time Kirill leaves unnoticed. Shortly, a group of soldiers arrive to arrest the skomorokh, whom they take outside, knock unconscious and take away, also smashing his musical instrument. As the rain has stopped the three monks thank the villagers for allowing them to shelter and continue on their way. As they walk on the heavy rain starts again.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the launch}} of Halo Wars 2, a demo, {{featuring}} the campaign's opening mission and the Blitz Firefight mode, was released on the Xbox One and Windows. 343 Industries and Creative Assembly supported Halo Wars 2 post-release with additional content and updates. A multiplayer ranking system was withheld from the game at launch as the development team wanted to ensure that gameplay was as balanced as possible before its release. The post-release DLC included a campaign expansion, new units, new leaders, and new cards for the Blitz mode. The content was distributed {{on a monthly basis}} beginning in March 2017. On June 12, 2017, a campaign expansion titled Awakening the Nightmare was revealed. Players take control of the Banished <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> into conflict with parasitic alien life forms collectively known as the Flood. The expansion features new leaders, maps, and a new cooperative mode. It was released on September 26, 2017. In late October 2017, Halo Wars 2 received a number of visual enhancements for the Xbox One X. Additionally, cross-platform play between console and PC was enabled.|$|E

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the conflict, ethnic identity is now of much greater social importance in Bosnia than it was prior to 1992. From the 1960s until the beginning of the war, nearly twelve percent of marriages were mixed (between members of different communities), and young citizens would often refer to themselves as Bosnians rather than identifying their ethnicity. After the conflict it has been effectively mandatory to be identified as either Bosniak, Serb or Croat and this has been a problem for the children of rape victims <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> of age.|$|E
25|$|Harold Waring, an under-secretary {{of state}} {{at the age of}} only thirty, is enjoying a holiday in the country of Herzoslovakia at a hotel by the side of Lake Stempka. The only other English people there are an elderly woman, Mrs Rice, and her married daughter, Mrs Elsie Clayton. Two other women cause Harold a moment of disquiet. He first sees them <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> up a path from the lake to the hotel. They are dressed in black-flapping cloaks, have hooked noses and bring to Harold's mind an image of evil birds of prey.|$|E

25|$|New {{versions}} of PGP are released periodically and vulnerabilities are fixed by developers <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> to light. Any agency wanting to read PGP messages would probably use easier means than standard cryptanalysis, e.g. rubber-hose cryptanalysis or black-bag cryptanalysis (e.g. installing {{some form of}} trojan horse or keystroke logging software/hardware on the target computer to capture encrypted keyrings and their passwords). The FBI has already used this attack against PGP in its investigations. However, any such vulnerabilities apply not just to PGP but to any conventional encryption software.|$|E
25|$|Farmers Dance (rice growers dance) This is {{a modern}} dance created by the Thai Ministry of Culture. The dancers wear the rice growers {{traditional}} costume and the dance itself enacts the daily activities of these workers who are {{the backbone of the}} nation. The ballet opens with the farmers <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> to plow and sow the fields. When they are sure that the rice is growing well, they gather together to pray to Mae Po Sop, the goddess who protects rice-growing. Lastly, the harvest is celebrated with songs and dancing.|$|E
25|$|Today, the Ten Commandments {{are heard}} in the synagogue three times a year: <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> up during the {{readings}} of Exodus and Deuteronomy, and during the festival of Shavuot. The Exodus version is read in parashat Yitro around late January–February, and on the festival of Shavuot, and the Deuteronomy version in parashat Va'etchanan in August–September. In some traditions, worshipers rise for {{the reading of the}} Ten Commandments to highlight their special significance though many rabbis, including Maimonides, have opposed this custom since one may come to think that the Ten Commandments are more important {{than the rest of the}} Mitzvot.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the Great Doxology, {{while the}} Trisagion is sung, the epitaphios is taken in {{procession}} around the outside the church, and is then returned to the tomb. Some churches observe the practice of holding the epitaphios at the door, above waist level, so the faithful most bow down under it <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> back into the church, symbolizing their entering into the death and resurrection of Christ. The epitaphios will lay in the tomb until the Paschal Service early Sunday morning. In some churches, the epitaphios is never left alone, but is accompanied 24 hours a day by a reader chanting from the Psalter.|$|E
25|$|As {{the race}} nears the finish line, Machinehead and JP {{race to the}} {{southern}} line boosted by their rare Steamlight boosters. <b>As</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> to a desperate neck-and-neck finish a drunk Old Man Mole accidentally detonates Frisbee's remote detonator, propelling JP and Sonoshee towards the finish line, thrown from their vehicle. The boost is enough and JP wins by {{the length of his}} long duck tail pompadour. As the racers rest {{at the end of the}} race amidst the ruins of Roboworld, JP and Sonoshee float back down to the ground kissing and thus declaring their love for each other. Machinehead (who vowed to win but comes in second) sees the romance and his rage turns to laughter, happy with the outcome anyway.|$|E
25|$|Spawning {{patterns}} in forage fish are highly predictable. Some fisheries use {{knowledge of these}} patterns to harvest the forage species <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>come</b> together to spawn, removing the fish before they have actually spawned. Fishing during spawning periods or at other times when forage fish amass in large numbers {{can also be a}} blow to predators. Many predators, such as whales, tuna and sharks, have evolved to migrate long distances to specific sites for feeding and breeding. Their survival hinges on their finding these forage schools at their feeding grounds. The great ocean predators find that, no matter how they are adapted for speed, size, endurance or stealth, they are on the losing side when faced with the machinery of contemporary industrial fishing.|$|E
