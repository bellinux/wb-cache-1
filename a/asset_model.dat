40|$|The {{reason for}} the failure of <b>asset</b> pricing <b>models</b> can be divided into three categories: Transaction costs, {{investor}} irrationality, or missing risk factors. This study investigates which of the three categories best explains the poor performance of <b>asset</b> pricing <b>models.</b> We regress the differences between the expected return and the realized return on variables related to the failure of <b>asset</b> pricing <b>models.</b> First, we find that both transaction costs and investor irrationality are significantly related to the differences between the realized return and the expected return from the capital <b>asset</b> pricing <b>model</b> (CAPM) even after size and book-to-market are controlled. Second, we implement the same testing procedure for the CAPM to other 6 major <b>asset</b> pricing <b>models.</b> The results of these regressions are all similar to those for the CAPM. Moreover, most of the Wald tests cannot reject the null hypothesis that the coefficients of <b>asset</b> pricing <b>models</b> are the same except for the consumption CAPM and the conditional CAPM. These results indicate that models with more risk factors than the CAPM cannot improve the CAPM’s failure caused by transaction costs and investor irrationality.

40|$|A {{prediction}} market {{allows a}} group of traders to form a consensus probability distribution by entering into agreements that pay o ↵ con-tingent on events of interest. A combinatorial prediction market allows conditional trades or trades on Boolean combinations of events to form a joint distribution over many related events. Sun et al. (2012) showed {{how to use a}} junction tree to update both the consen-sus joint distribution and each user’s assets in a combinatorial prediction market. Be-cause a separate asset junction tree is main-tained for each user on the joint space, this approach is very inecient in the typical case where most users trade sparsely with respect to the joint space. Further, any changes to the global junction tree must be mirrored across all users. We demonstrate large ef-ficiency gains from divorcing the probability and asset data structures, dynamically build-ing a separate asset junction tree for each user. The trade-based <b>asset</b> <b>model</b> has as-set blocks as the basic units involving ques-tions being traded only. We compare a sim-ple block-iteration method against a more so-phisticated user-specific junction tree, ana-lyzing conditions under which each approach is faster.
