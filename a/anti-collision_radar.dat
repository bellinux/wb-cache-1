40|$|Abstract — <b>Anti-collision</b> <b>radars</b> {{are used}} in {{automobiles}} applications to prevent accidents of vehicles by detecting obstacles {{in front of the}} vehicles. Generally the correlation radars are used for this purpose, which compute the distance and the relative speed between the vehicles, but problem is that the correlation radars are not capable to measure the angle. In this paper, we are presenting a VHDL design for the correlation radar, which is capable to measure distance, relative speed and angle. The proposed radar uses the two receiver concept to measure the angle of the object. The capability to angle measurement also increases the application area of this correlation radar. Because of this facility, this can be used for auto driving system. The simulation results show that it works perfectly and can be used as low cost, single chip solution for automotive radars...|$|R

5000|$|During a {{formation}} steaming exercise on 10 February 1986 about 100 nautical miles southwest Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, Willamette {{collided with the}} repair ship [...] As {{a result of the}} collision, one of the crew on the Jason was killed (CPO Susano R. Valdez) and eight injured. The Willamette {{was at the center of}} the steaming formation and was the [...] "guide ship" [...] that the rest of the ships in the formation were using to maintain their relative position in the formation. The Jason was instructed to take station in the center rear of the formation. The Jason was approaching the formation from the southeast, and for some reason mistakenly decided to cut through the steaming formation as opposed to going around it and approaching her station from the rear. Reportedly several ships in the formation maneuvered to avoid a collision. The reaction on the Willamette was too slow, and she pierced the Jason approximately 1/3 of the ship length from the bow, and the resulting momentum nearly broke the Jason in half. The time was shortly before 10 pm local. Ironically, on the Willamette the bridge was equipped with an early version of a then new <b>anti-collision</b> <b>radar</b> system. The collision alarm was sounded about 30 seconds prior to the actual collision, but most of the off crew was near the rear of the ship and barely felt the shudder of the impact. On the bridge of the Willamette as the ship withdrew after the engines were applied full astern, the view of a triangle-shaped void from the weather deck to below the water line where the bow had pierced the Jasons hull was unforgettable. This void was filled with the bright stark white fluorescent lights from multiple decks on the Jason amid the darkness of the night and the smoke and flames on the bow of the Willamette. The next day clothing and shoes belonging to the sailors on the Jason were found on the Willamettes bow. The collision smashed Willamettes bow from the rail to below the waterline. The Willamette returned to port under her own power. A large vertical rupture from the deck to waterline on the port side of the Jason forced that ship to be towed back to port by the [...] The resultant fires in Willamette’s boatswain’s locker took several hours to extinguish. The smoke was so thick that the crew could not enter the flaming compartment via the hatch. Therefore, holes were cut in the deck above so that nozzles could be inserted to extinguish the blaze. Both ships had to be emptied of fuel and needed to be repaired for several months. The Willamette received a new bow section, and while in drydock hull damage sustained during the grounding in the Willamette river was also repaired. As a result of the collision both captains were relieved of command, and the ship earned the nickname [...] "We'll Ram It." ...|$|E

Compact phase shifters within a traveling wave array antenna architecture, on single layer substrate, is investigated for the first time. Radio frequency MEMS switches are utilized to improve the performance of reconfigurable antennas at higher frequencies.

Moreover, a hybrid approach is used for a 24 GHz switched beam traveling wave array antenna. A MEMS router is fabricated on silicon substrate for switching two array antennas on a LTCC chip.

40|$|Recently, the {{research}} and development of low cost and highly efficient millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems with beam-steering capabilities have significantly advanced to address the ever-increasing demand for future wireless ultra-broadband applications. These applications include, but are not limited to, automotive <b>anti-collision</b> surveillance <b>radar,</b> smart navigation systems, improved wireless tracking, satellite communication, imaging, 5 G wireless communication, and 60 GHz multi-gigabit wireless personal and local area network (WPAN/WLAN). In general, beam-steering capability significantly relaxes the overall system power budget and minimizes the interference. In communication applications, it enhances the link robustness through multi-path mitigation and increases the channel and the aggregated channel throughput by exploiting the spatial dimension. In imaging/radar systems, beam-steering is essential for achieving the required resolution (angle-of-arrival). In this work, I have proven many beam-steering advantages in this work through the development of a ray-tracing based wireless channel model, which has been used to extract the antenna system requirements and to quantitatively illustrate the usefulness of the presented beam-steerable systems. Despite the advantages it provides, the realization of this electronic beam-steerable mmWave antenna system is quite challenging. In general, the mmWave components' design, integration, fabrication and testing processes are far more complex than their lower frequency counterparts. This {{can be attributed to the}} significant losses and parasitics experienced at mmWave frequencies, as well as the lack of reliable design models. Systems with fully integrated (on-chip) antennas and passives have been widely studied and presented at mmWave range; however, the performance (low antenna gain, high phase noise, etc…), the cost (die size is huge), and thermal problems are still major issues for these systems. Hybrid integration tackles these problems by combining a compact and low power consumption die (or multiple dies) with high performance off-chip passives (antenna, feed network, passive phase shifters, resonators, etc…); however, this integration is costly. In addition, there is a challenge associated with the implementation of high performance components at mmWave range. This is mainly due to the use of advanced/non-standard types of fabrication technologies and complex integration/packaging techniques. Investigation, optimization, development of a highly efficient and yet very low cost mmWave beam-steering solution calls for a multi-disciplinary approach which involves EM theory, optimization techniques, microwave circuits, wireless communications, Silicon micro-fabrication, layout design, parasitics modeling/extraction and MEMS technology. The proposed study introduces a high performance beam-steering mmWave antenna system along with its integration with the active components with special consideration to the fabrication cost. The new high resistivity Silicon (HRS) dielectric waveguide (DWG) based platform, which has recently been developed at CIARS (Centre for Intelligent Antenna and Radio Systems), is extended and used for wireless mmWave systems with beam-steering antennas. Electronic beam-steering can be implemented through beam-switching configurations (simple, fast but coarse) or phase array configurations (complex but high performance for large arrays). A novel low cost, highly efficient and compact switched-beam antenna is proposed for the automotive radar application. The design optimization along with the fabrication and measurement details have been discussed. For phased array applications, various HRS DWG-based antenna designs have been proposed and discussed in this study. Among them is the novel pixelated antenna which represents a new systematic procedure for designing a compact and low cost dielectric antenna for mmWave/sub-THz applications. I have developed a method using Genetic Algorithm to optimize the shape of the antenna in a compact space for any given specifications. The other important component is the phase shifter. Low-cost, compact and easily integrated phase shifters with low insertion loss and low power consumption are highly desirable for a wide range of applications. In addition, minimal insertion loss variations for the full range of phase shift over a wide frequency band is a critical requirement. I have carefully studied the effects of phase shifters non-idealities, taking into consideration the phased array system level requirements and presented two novel HRS DWG-based phase shifters. Among the proposed phase shifters is a structure that changes the phase of the propagating mode by varying the propagation constant using a high dielectric constant (40 - 170) slab of Barium Lanthanide Tetratitanates. This leads to a compact phase shifter design. The additional advantage of this phase shifter is that it focuses the fields in a lossless air gap (new low loss guiding structure). Different types of the proposed phase shifter have been developed and successfully tested including electrically controlled ones. Finally, I present new techniques for low cost and efficient integration for the proposed high quality mmWave passives with active components. 4 month...|$|R

40|$|Array antennas have a {{wide range}} of {{applications}} which includes ground and airborne radar, weather radar and <b>anti-collision</b> <b>radar.</b> In addition, equally important applications exist for communications, both on earth and to satellites in space, as well as for medical applications such as the detection and treatment of tumors. The modern trend in array design is to use digital beamforming and to integrate the antennas {{with the rest of the}} system more closely. This adds new possibilities, but also contributes to make the system expensive. To make full use of the new technology, this thesis presents a direction dependent signal processing array calibration method. The new method, called local calibration, also allows for larger array imperfections and, possibly, a lower overall array cost. In contrast to other non-parametric calibration methods, the proposed method can handle position errors and shows good performance also for sparse calibration grids, which is demonstrated by high resolution direction of arrival estimation. The local calibration has also been included in a convex beampattern optimization, which makes it possible to achieve a uniform sidelobe level also with unknown sensor position errors in the array. The embedded element pattern is included in the optimization by extracting the direction dependence of the received power from the calibration. Another application for the local calibration method is to reduce the number of necessary calibration measurements by calculating pseudo calibration data from a sparse grid of measured calibration data. Array signal processing is often performed assuming Uniform Linear Arrays (ULAs), although this model is far too simple to reveal the true behavior of array antennas. Throughout this thesis, more realistic models including mutual coupling and array imperfections are used. Specifically, the impact of mutual coupling and position errors on the adaptive beamforming performance in linear and circular arrays is studied. In the studied cases, the circular array is found to be more sensitive to neglecting the mutual coupling. Robust adaptive methods are commonly used to handle model uncertainties, such as unknown mutual coupling, but even better performance can be achieved if these methods are combined with a calibration...|$|E
