5|$|Kilmer {{was born}} December 6, 1886, in New Brunswick, New Jersey, {{the fourth and}} {{youngest}} child, of Annie Ellen Kilburn (1849–1932), a minor writer and composer, and Dr. Frederick Barnett Kilmer (1851–1934), a physician and <b>analytical</b> <b>chemist</b> employed by the Johnson and Johnson Company and inventor of the company's baby powder. He was named Alfred Joyce Kilmer after two priests at Christ Church in New Brunswick: Alfred R. Taylor, the curate; and the Rev. Dr. Elisha Brooks Joyce (1857–1926), the rector. Christ Church is the oldest Episcopal parish in New Brunswick and the Kilmer family were parishioners. Rector Joyce, who served the parish from 1883 to 1916, baptised the young Kilmer, who remained an Episcopalian until his 1913 conversion to Catholicism. Kilmer's birthplace in New Brunswick, where the Kilmer family lived from 1886 to 1892, is still standing, and houses a small museum to Kilmer, {{as well as a}} few Middlesex County government offices.|$|E

The same year, Lionel Dahmer achieved his degree and subsequently obtained employment as an <b>analytical</b> <b>chemist</b> in the city of Akron.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} employed human physiological specimen for detecting AAS usage is urine, although both blood and hair {{have been investigated}} for this purpose. The AAS, whether of endogenous or exogenous origin, are subject to extensive hepatic biotransformation {{by a variety of}} enzymatic pathways. The primary urinary metabolites may be detectable for up to 30 days after the last use, depending on the specific agent, dose and route of administration. A number of the drugs have common metabolic pathways, and their excretion profiles may overlap those of the endogenous steroids, making interpretation of testing results a very significant challenge to the <b>analytical</b> <b>chemist.</b> Methods for detection of the substances or their excretion products in urine specimens usually involve gas chromatography–mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.|$|E
25|$|Clarke {{was born}} in Birmingham, {{the son of an}} amateur organist. He began playing the piano at age four, and by six had improvised a tune that he reused in one of his mature works forty years later. He took up the violin when he was eight and played in an {{orchestra}} at twelve. In the same year, he became the organist at his church and was composing music by age 19. His parents did not approve of his taking music up as a profession, and he was sent to work first with an <b>analytical</b> <b>chemist</b> and then with a land surveyor. According to The Musical Times, he did not take up music as a profession until he was in his twenties. In 1864 he was awarded the first prize for anthems by the College of Organists.|$|E

Both have refused to change their surname and have professed their love of Jeffrey in spite of his crimes. In 1994, Lionel published a book, A Father's Story, and donated a portion of the proceeds from his book to the victims' families. Most of the families showed support for Lionel and Shari, although three families subsequently sued Lionel Dahmer: two for using their names in the book without obtaining prior consent; and a third family—that of Steven Hicks—filing a wrongful death suit against Lionel Dahmer, Shari, and former wife Joyce, citing parental negligence as the cause for the claim.|$|E

30|$|The {{moisture}} content {{was determined by}} drying 20  g of L. purpureus seed in an oven at 105  °C for 24  h, according to the standard procedures detailed by AOAC (Association of Official <b>Analytical</b> <b>Chemists</b> 2005; Method # 925.09), {{and the result is}} expressed on a percentage basis. The air dried samples were powdered in a mill to 40 -mesh size and stored in screw-capped bottles at room temperature for further analyses. The nitrogen content (N) was determined by Kjeldahl method, as described by AOAC (Association of Official <b>Analytical</b> <b>Chemists</b> 2005; Method # 920.152) and the crude protein content was calculated by multiplying the N with 6.25 (N ×  6.25). Crude lipid content was determined using Soxhlet apparatus according to the method described by AOAC (Association of Official <b>Analytical</b> <b>Chemists</b> 2005; Method # 920.85). Available carbohydrate was estimated indirectly by difference (Food and Agriculture Organization, Food and Nutrition paper, 77, 2003). The ash content was determined by heating 2  g of the dried sample in a silica dish at 600  °C for 6  h, using the method described by AOAC (Association of Official <b>Analytical</b> <b>Chemists</b> 2005; 923.03). Total energy was also determined by the calculation of energy values of carbohydrate, fat, protein and crude fiber.|$|R
500|$|Unofficial patches {{have been}} created by the game's fans to address Bloodlines {{technical}} problems, and restore missing and incomplete content. After experiencing problems with the first versions of an unofficial patch created by Dan Upright, <b>analytical</b> <b>chemist</b> Werner Spahl continued patching the game from version 1.2 with permission and instructions. The game community tested Spahl's patches, providing reports on bugs and spelling errors. Although the game's complexity meant that repairing one aspect often broke another, as work on the patches progressed Spahl began restoring removed and incomplete content in the game files, adding quests, items, weapons, and characters, with fan help to provide voice acting, models, and reinstating whole levels. The changes altered the original game so much that Spahl was criticized {{by some of the}} game's fans. This resulted in two patch versions: a basic version, fixing the game's technical issues, and a [...] "plus" [...] version with the additional content. As of 2016, the game has over 10 years of post-release support with the release of versions 9.x of the patch, which are also included in the version of the game sold on GOG. The game fared better following its release on Valve's Steam digital distribution service in March 2007, where, as of 2015, it has sold 492,000 copies.|$|E
