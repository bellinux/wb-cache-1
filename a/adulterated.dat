5|$|In Thailand, durian {{is often}} eaten fresh with sweet sticky rice, and blocks of durian paste {{are sold in}} the markets, though much of the paste is <b>adulterated</b> with pumpkin. Unripe durians may be cooked as a vegetable, except in the Philippines, where all uses are sweet rather than savoury. Malaysians make both sugared and salted {{preserves}} from durian. When durian is minced with salt, onions and vinegar, it is called boder. The durian seeds, which are the size of chestnuts, can be eaten whether they are boiled, roasted or fried in coconut oil, with a texture {{that is similar to}} taro or yam, but stickier. In Java, the seeds are sliced thin and cooked with sugar as a confection. Uncooked durian seeds are potentially toxic due to cyclopropene fatty acids and should not be ingested.|$|E

25|$|It is {{difficult}} to distinguish between fully refined sugar produced from beet and cane. One way is by isotope analysis of carbon. Cane uses C4 carbon fixation, and beet uses C3 carbon fixation, resulting in a different ratio of 13C and 12C isotopes in the sucrose.

25|$|However, many adverse {{reactions}} {{are due to}} misuse or abuse of Chinese medicine.

Large quantities of melamine were added to watered-down milk to give it the appearance of having adequate protein levels. Some of those responsible for the poisoning were sentenced to death.|$|E
25|$|For {{as long as}} wine {{has been}} made, wine has been manipulated, <b>adulterated,</b> and counterfeited.

First the Nepalese supplied mohars (silver coins which weighed about 5.4grams) of good silver, but wanted these to circulate at the rate of one new mohar for two of the old <b>adulterated</b> silver coins struck by the Malla kings. This would have meant a tremendous loss for the Tibetan traders, and so the Tibetan Government did not accept these terms.|$|E
25|$|Lavoisier was a {{powerful}} member {{of a number of}} aristocratic councils, and an administrator of the Ferme générale. The Ferme générale {{was one of the most}} hated components of the Ancien Régime because of the profits it took at the expense of the state, the secrecy of the terms of its contracts, and the violence of its armed agents. All of these political and economic activities enabled him to fund his scientific research.

25|$|Adding to absinthe's {{negative}} {{reputation in}} the late 19th and early 20th centuries, unscrupulous makers of the drink omitted the traditional colouring phase of production in favour of adding toxic copper salts to artificially induce a green tint.

Many modern day producers resort to similar (but non-deadly) shortcuts, including the use of artificial food colouring to create the green colour. Additionally, at least some cheap absinthes produced before the ban were reportedly <b>adulterated</b> with poisonous antimony trichloride, reputed to enhance the louching effect.|$|E
