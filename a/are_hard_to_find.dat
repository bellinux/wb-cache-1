25|$|During World War II, {{bronze and}} {{aluminium-bronze}} coins {{were replaced by}} zinc and aluminium, with the 2 Reichspfennig discontinued for potential of being too easily mistaken for the 10 Reichspfennig when being struck in the same metal. The 1, 2, and 5 Reichsmark coins were no longer issued, replaced instead by banknotes. Aluminium 50 Reichspfennig coins were reintroduced to replace the nickel versions. This time around they had a longer run, being produced from 1939 to 1944. Lower denominations were produced in zinc from 1940 onwards. Due to their composition, these coins had poor durability and <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> in very good condition. The last production of coins bearing the swastika was in 1944 (1, 5, 10, and 50 Reichspfennig) and 1945 (1 and 10 Reichspfennig only).|$|E
25|$|In November 2000, William Gibbons {{did some}} {{preliminary}} research in Cameroon {{for a future}} expedition. He was accompanied by David Wetzel, and videographer Elena Dugan. While visiting {{with a group of}} pygmies, they were informed about an animal called Ngoubou, a horned creature. The pygmies asserted it was not a regular rhinoceros, as it had more than one horn (six horns on the frill in one eyewitness account), and that the father of one of the senior members of the community had killed one with a spear a number of years ago. The locals have noted a firm dwindle in the population of these animals lately, and that they <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>find.</b> Gibbons identified the animal with a Styracosaurus, but, in addition to being extinct, these are only known to have inhabited North America.|$|E

25|$|A {{generalization}} of Student's t statistic, called Hotelling's t-squared statistic, {{allows for the}} testing of hypotheses on multiple (often correlated) measures within the same sample. For instance, a researcher might submit a number of subjects to a personality test consisting of multiple personality scales (e.g. the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory). Because measures of this type are usually positively correlated, it is not advisable to conduct separate univariate t-tests to test hypotheses, as these would neglect the covariance among measures and inflate the chance of falsely rejecting at least one hypothesis (Type I error). In this case a single multivariate test is preferable for hypothesis testing. Fisher's Method for combining multiple tests with alpha reduced for positive correlation among tests is one. Another is Hotelling's T2 statistic follows a T2 distribution. However, in practice the distribution is rarely used, since tabulated values for T2 <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>find.</b> Usually, T2 is converted instead to an F statistic.|$|E

2500|$|The Pali Canon {{records that}} the Buddha {{distinguished}} between {{two kinds of}} illness (rogo): physical illness (kāyiko rogo) and mental illness (cetasiko rogo). The Buddha attributed mental illness to the arising of mental defilements (Kleshas) which are ultimately based on the unwholesome roots (three poisons) of greed, hatred and confusion. From {{the perspective of the}} Buddha, mental illness is a matter of degree, and ultimately, everyone who is not an awakened being is in some sense mentally ill. As the Buddha in the Pali canon states: [...] "those beings <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> in the world who can admit freedom from mental disease even for one moment, save only those in whom the asavas are destroyed." [...] Another set of negative qualities outlined by the Buddha are the five hindrances, which are said to prevent proper mental cultivation, these are: sense desire, hostility, sloth-torpor, restlessness-worry and doubt.|$|E
2500|$|Obesity {{prevalence}} {{is affected}} by access to care for truckers. Company drivers often have issues with insurance, such as necessary pre-approval if out of network. Most owner-operator drivers {{do not have any}} kind of medical insurance (that is, in the USA where medical treatment isn't free of charge like most countries). [...] Moreover, truckers have difficulties making an appointment on the road and often do not know where to stop for assistance. Many self-diagnose or ignore their health issue altogether. [...] Some are able to be seen at doctor’s offices or private clinics while a large percentage depend on emergency rooms and urgent care visits. The Department of Transportation has Convenient Care Clinics across the U.S., but those <b>are</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>find</b> and are few and far between. Health care costs are substantially higher for overweight and obese individuals, so obesity in the truck driver population puts a greater financial demand on the industry.|$|E

Famous to Rhode Island is Snail Salad, which is served at numerous restaurants throughout the state. The dish is normally prepared [...] "family style" [...] with over five pounds of snails mixed in with other ingredients commonly found in seafood dishes. Grinders are submarine sandwiches, with a popular version being the Italian grinder, which is made with cold cuts (usually ham, prosciutto, capicola, salami, and Provolone cheese). Linguiça or chouriço (a spicy Portuguese sausage) and peppers is also popular among the state's large Portuguese community, eaten with hearty bread (though this is also popular {{in other areas of}} New England).|$|E
2500|$|By November 1974, {{despite having}} survived legal {{challenges}} from Davis, Welch departed.

Fleetwood meanwhile was planning a follow-up album to Heroes <b>Are</b> <b>Hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>Find</b> – Welch's last with the group – which had charted at 34 in the United States. Fleetwood was shopping with his children when a chance encounter with an old friend led him to visit Sound City and producer Keith Olsen. While at the studio, Olsen played samples from an album entitled Buckingham Nicks. Fleetwood immediately [...] "was in awe". Unbeknownst to him, both Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks were working in the studio at the time, though the three did not meet until later. On New Year's Eve, 1974, Fleetwood contacted Olsen to advise him that their planned project was on hiatus after Welch's departure, however he then suggested that Nicks and Buckingham join Fleetwood Mac. The group ate together at a local restaurant before practising {{together for the first time}} in the new studio. The next year the new line-up released Fleetwood Mac.|$|E
