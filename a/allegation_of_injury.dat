Geier (born 1948 in Washington, D.C., U.S.) is a {{self-employed}} American {{physician and}} controversial professional witness who has testified {{in more than}} 90 cases regarding <b>allegations</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> or illness caused by vaccines. Since 2011, Geier's medical license has been suspended or revoked in every state {{in which he was}} licensed over concerns about his autism treatments and his misrepresentation of his credentials to the Maryland Board of Health, where he falsely claimed to be a board-certified geneticist and epidemiologist.|$|R
40|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} and {{coronary insufficiency}} are the common conditions involved in workmen's compensation cases based on <b>allegations</b> <b>of</b> cardiac <b>injury.</b> Since coronary disease {{tends to be}} a progressive process, punctuated by sudden accidents, {{it is difficult to determine}} when a given stress at work may have had a significant effect in producing an infarction. Though there are gaps in our knowledge, considerable information is available indicating the way in which effort or stress may produce a myocardial infarction...|$|R
50|$|The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has {{compiled}} a list of vaccines and their possible side effects. <b>Allegations</b> <b>of</b> vaccine <b>injuries</b> in recent decades have appeared in litigation in the U.S. Some families have won substantial awards from sympathetic juries, even though most public health officials have said that the claims <b>of</b> <b>injuries</b> were unfounded. In response, several vaccine makers stopped production, which the US government believed could be a threat to public health, so laws were passed to shield manufacturers from liabilities stemming from vaccine injury claims. The safety and side effects of multiple vaccines have been tested in order to uphold the viability of vaccines as a barrier against disease. The Influenza vaccine was tested in controlled trials and proven to have negligible side effects equal to that of a placebo. Some concerns from families might have arisen from social beliefs and norms that cause them to mistrust or refuse vaccinations, contributing to this discrepancy in side effects that were unfounded.|$|R
40|$|Section 43 (a) of the Lanham Act {{provides}} a federal {{cause of action}} for false advertising. There is considerable disagreement among the federal circuit courts over {{the proper way to}} determine standing under this statute. Much of the disagreement centers on how the plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s status as a direct competitor of the defendant should affect the standing inquiry. This Note argues that the five-factor test currently used by the U. S. Courts of Appeals for the Third, Fifth, and Eleventh Circuits is the best approach. Further, this Note argues that an <b>allegation</b> <b>of</b> a commercial <b>injury</b> by a direct competitor of the defendant satisfies this test...|$|R
40|$|In 2009, the United States House of Representatives heard {{testimony}} {{that hundreds of}} students had been injured in schools by teachers secluding or physically restraining them. Congress had never legislated on seclusion and restraint, but the alarming <b>allegations</b> <b>of</b> student <b>injuries</b> and deaths prompted many parents to demand {{a ban on the}} use of the techniques in schools. In the continuing debate, school officials have protested that seclusion and restraint are important tools for teachers to protect their classrooms from out-of-control students. Torn between these two extreme positions, Congress has twice attempted — but failed — to pass federal legislation regulating seclusion and restraint. This Note examines the most recent failed legislative attempts and proposes a more moderate statute that has a greater likelihood of passing through a polarized Congress. By banning certain forms of restraint, raising safety standards for seclusion spaces, and broadening grant authority to help schools develop alternatives to seclusion and restraint, this Note’s proposed statute would protect both student safety and teacher autonomy...|$|R
5000|$|The Supreme Court {{cast the}} case as [...] "a heated dispute between {{individual}} citizens and certain policemen ... that has evolved into {{an attempt by the}} federal judiciary to resolve a 'controversy' between the entire citizenry of Philadelphia and the petitioning elected and appointed officials over what steps might, in the Court of Appeals' words, 'appear to have the potential for prevention of future police misconduct.'" [...] The court - [...] "expressing grave doubts about the justiciability" [...] of the case - held that [...] "the individual respondents' claim to 'real and immediate' injury rests not upon what the named petitioners might do to them in the future -- such as set a bond {{on the basis of race}} -- but upon what one of a small, unnamed minority of policemen might do to them in the future because of that unknown policeman's perception of departmental disciplinary procedures. This hypothesis is even more attenuated than those <b>allegations</b> <b>of</b> future <b>injury</b> found insufficient in O'Shea to warrant invocation of federal jurisdiction. Thus, insofar as the individual respondents were concerned, we think they lacked standing." ...|$|R
40|$|We {{ask a lot}} of our jurors. The {{financial}} and emotional burdens of jury duty can be significant even in mundane cases. Deciding another's fate is often a trying ordeal, aggravated by unintelligible instructions, hostile attorneys or court personnel, miserable working conditions, and interminable delays. 1 The voir dire process may require jurors to reveal intimate, embarrassing, or damning information about themselves and their families that they would not voluntarily choose to reveal. 2 Confronted with <b>allegations</b> <b>of</b> violence, <b>injury,</b> or abuse, some jurors become traumatized or ill. 3 On top of all of this jury service exposes jurors, their families, and their friends to exploitation by the press and to retaliatory threats and unwanted attention from defendants, victims, and sympathizers. There are judges and legislators in this country who believe that risking humiliation and fear need not be part of the job description for jurors, and they have taken unprecedented steps to prove it. They have promised anonymity to jurors in all criminal cases, except in limited circumstances. 4 In this Essay I examine these innovative efforts and encourage other judges and legislators 5 to consider the routine use of anonymous juries in criminal cases at least in urban areas where anonymity is feasible. 7 By alleviating juror fear, anonymity can enhance the participation of citizens in jury service, the reliability of the voir dire process, the quality of jury deliberations, and the fairness of criminal verdicts...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is based}} on a unique dataset constructed by probabilistically linking records across three independent sources of data from California: 1) vital birth records, 2) administrative child protective service records, and 3) vital death records. The final dataset captures 4. 3 million children born in California between 1999 - 2006 and includes maltreatment allegation information for over 500, 000 children who were reported to child protective services (CPS), as well as death reports on 2, 000 children who were fatally injured before age five. Three research questions were examined {{in the context of a}} prospective birth cohort analysis: 1) Is a referral to child protective services an independent risk factor for injury mortality? 2) Is allegation disposition associated with injury fatality risk? 3) Does injury fatality risk vary across maltreatment allegation types? To answer these three questions, a series of multivariate survival models were specified. Separate models were estimated for overall risk <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> death, risk <b>of</b> unintentional <b>injury</b> death, and risk <b>of</b> intentional <b>injury</b> death. Findings indicate that an earlier report to CPS is the strongest predictor <b>of</b> a child's <b>injury</b> death during the first five years of life. Children previously reported for maltreatment died from accidental injuries at twice the rate of their unreported, demographically similar peers, and from intentional injuries at five times the rate. After adjusting for other characteristics, children whose report of maltreatment was evaluated out without an in-person investigation by CPS died <b>of</b> <b>injuries</b> at significantly higher rates than children who had never been reported. Children with a substantiated <b>allegation</b> <b>of</b> maltreatment and no foster care placement died <b>of</b> intentional <b>injuries</b> at over 10 times the rate of children who had not been reported. Placement in foster care for even a single day was protective. Children with a prior <b>allegation</b> <b>of</b> physical abuse died from injuries at rates that were notably higher than not only unreported children, but also children reported for reasons of sexual abuse, neglect, or other forms of maltreatment. When only intentional injury fatalities were modeled, a prior <b>allegation</b> <b>of</b> physical abuse was associated with a rate of death that was 38 times that of children who had not been reported. This study represents the most rigorous longitudinal analysis of mortality outcomes following a report to CPS to date, with several key implications for practice and policy emerging. First, these data underscore that a child's report to CPS is not random, nor is it simply a function of poverty. Rather, a report to CPS signals a level of risk, including a risk of death, that is greater than sociodemographic factors would alone predict. A second and related point is that children evaluated out after a CPS hotline call reflect a group whose risk <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> death is far greater than their unreported sociodemographic peers. The decision to screen these children out without an investigation, under the logic that these children were assessed to be at no greater risk of harm than other demographically similar children, is not supported by the empirical evidence generated from this study. Third, these data highlight that although there has been a recent emphasis on the unmet service needs of children reported for neglect, it is young children reported for physical abuse who face the greatest risk of death. Given that physical abuse allegations represent a minority of reports received by CPS, these data suggest that a different protocol for investigating and intervening in cases in which physical abuse is alleged may be justified. Finally, the finding that a prior <b>allegation</b> <b>of</b> maltreatment is the single greatest predictor of not just intentional injury death, but also unintentional injury death, lends support to calls that have been made for child welfare services to be pursued under a broader, public health-oriented agenda, focused on the prevention of all manners <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> death...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims to {{contribute}} to and clarify the debate around false <b>allegations</b> <b>of</b> sexual assault by providing a summary of recent literature, including consideration of the classifications and methods of defining a false allegation, {{whether there is a}} prevailing scepticism around <b>allegations</b> <b>of</b> sexual assault, and the motivations for falsifying reports. Key messages:There is ongoing speculation about the prevalence <b>of</b> false <b>allegations</b> <b>of</b> sexual assault, however, without consistency in definition and classification of what actually is a false <b>allegation,</b> accurate measurement <b>of</b> prevalence is difficult. Assumptions are made about the truth <b>of</b> <b>allegations</b> <b>of</b> sexual assault at various decision-making points in the justice response. These assumptions are based on individual and societal beliefs about gender roles and sexual assault that may not accord with the actual experiences of sexual assault. The perception that false <b>allegations</b> <b>of</b> sexual assault are common has negative consequences for victims of sexual assault and society more generally by perpetuating victims’ fear of being disbelieved or being blamed for the assault. This reduces the likelihood of reporting. A more useful approach to considering false <b>allegations</b> <b>of</b> sexual assault is to undertake more contextual analysis of the factors that play into a label <b>of</b> false <b>allegations...</b>|$|R
