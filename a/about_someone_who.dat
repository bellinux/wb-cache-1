I think the real idea of the video is in a moment like that— in a private moment like that, she can never be by herself... This song is not <b>about</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> feels those emotions, it's about Beyoncé feeling those emotions. It's {{personal}} to her. It's her that cannot be by herself no matter where she goes or what she does, because she's who she is." ...|$|E
500|$|Although {{there were}} many critics of the character, {{favorable}} comments came from several quarters. Columnist Erma Bombeck wrote, [...] "Kids {{need to know that}} somewhere in this world is a contemporary who can pull off all the things they can only fantasize <b>about,</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> can stick it to their parents once in a while and still be permitted to live."

5000|$|The {{music video}} {{features}} the band's lead singer {{as a man}} who has gone insane. The band explained: [...] "The song is <b>about</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who's</b> lost their mind so the inspiration came from The Shining and the image of Jack Torrance hammering his typewriter. So we took it from there and, instead of a typewriter, we gave our character a piano." [...] The man is a ruffled, gothic amalgamation of Slash and Daniel Day-Lewis' character in Gangs of New York.|$|R
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} talks <b>about</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> has got over a broken relationship, declaring the partner as [...] "so yesterday". According to Duff, the song's lyrics are very {{empowering}} towards {{breaking up with}} someone and getting over it. In a 2006 interview with Instinct, Duff said that people often told her that [...] "So Yesterday" [...] was [...] "the ultimate post-breakup anthem". She said her mother instilled the notion of inner strength in her, and that she wanted the music she makes to be positive. [...] "I don't think there's very much of that out there anymore.", she said. She {{stressed the importance of}} strong songs that are not all about how [...] "a boy broke your heart and you're never going to get on your feet again", saying it was good for girls to hear.|$|E
500|$|Series creator Matthew Weiner {{called the}} {{decision}} to write off Lane Pryce [...] "a terrible thing {{to have to deal}} with." [...] He added, [...] "You {{want to make sure that}} it's worth it, that they're going out with a bang and you're not sacrificing someone who's a great actor and a great musician in the orchestra. But also I feel like there have to be stakes. This year was filled with foreboding of violence and death, and the connection of that early summer between the riots, which resulted in death, police killing innocent people, and the Richard Speck murders and the guy on the Texas tower [...] The randomness and the nihilism that was born from that was something that permeated the story. Lane's story I thought was <b>about</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> has undervalued themselves and that was his only way out, he thought." ...|$|E
500|$|Mark Taylor (Robert Bathurst) is a {{television}} sitcom writer. Other than episode one, {{where he is}} shown working on a script and references to a show of his that had aired during a dinner with Robert and Tracy the night before, his work is hardly mentioned. Mark is quick-witted, and the stand-up sequences indicate that he thinks in one-liners. However, this proves to be the downfall of his marriage with Becky, who says that she didn't sign on to become his [...] "lawfully wedded straight man". In one episode, Mark jokes about worrying if his virginity will heal back; Becky articulates her frustration by responding [...] "What page is that on?" [...] Identifying his insecurities, {{she points out that}} the [...] "thing <b>about</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> uses humour as a weapon, is not the sense of humour, but the fact that they need a weapon". In interviews, Bathurst has compared Steven Moffat to his character: Mark is [...] "a man whose wife leaves him because he talks in one-liners. And Steven Moffat's wife had just left him, because he talks in one-liners." ...|$|E
5000|$|The song [...] "Stupid Dream" [...] is {{actually}} only a short, 28 second instrumental {{piece of a}} tuning orchestra and sound effects. [...] "Slave Called Shiver", and [...] "Don't Hate Me", according to Wilson, are about feelings of [...] "unreturned love". He said of them, [...] "Slave Called Shiver's a very perverse love song, yeah. I mean, it's an unrequited love song. It's a love song with somebody <b>who's</b> obsessed with <b>someone</b> else, {{but none of that}} affection is returned. It relates very closely to 'Don't Hate Me', which is a song again <b>about</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who's</b> obsessed with <b>someone</b> from afar. 'Don't Hate Me' is an even more extreme version, because here this person actually begins to follow and make phone calls and, you know, it becomes very unhealthy. 'Slave Called Shiver' is slightly less extreme. It's <b>about</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who's</b> very much in love and obsessed with somebody else. That love is not returned and so there's a slightly violent perverse undercurrent. 'Pure Narcotic' also is very much the same subject". [...] "Don't Hate Me" [...] featured the first use of saxophone in the music of Porcupine Tree, courtesy of Theo Travis. During live performances, the flute and saxophone solos are replaced by Barbieri's keyboard and Wilson guitar solos respectively.|$|R
5000|$|The song first {{appeared}} in live sets in April 1980, and was recorded {{in one or two}} takes with no demo. Author Walker said, [...] "It's <b>about</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who's</b> on the skids, but still having a great time. I can relate to that - in the seven years Cold Chisel have been together, we've only had enough money to eat the last two and a half. If you get into that lifestyle and start to enjoy it, you tend to stay that way even when the money comes in." ...|$|R

500|$|Writer and {{executive}} producer Howard Gordon was originally working on an episode <b>about</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> appeared to be immortal, but after discussions with consulting producer Ken Horton he added {{in the notion of}} xenophobia and [...] "melanin-sucking albino vampires". Series creator Chris Carter approved the storyline, but the first draft of the script was met with disapproval by the writing staff, and the story was restructured and rewritten. As the episode entered pre-production, Carter asked Gordon to refine the script to give it a purpose, and it was then that Gordon came up with the theme of [...] "deceive, inveigle, and obfuscate". This phrase is first spoken by Scully in conversation with Mulder after the post mortem on Owen Sanders, the fourth missing man. Mulder later throws the same phrase back at her in frustration as he leaves the Mt Zion Medical Center (where Aboah has been examined) to meet Diabra, the Burkinabe diplomat. And Scully finally uses the phrase in her field journal during her closing sentiments.|$|E
500|$|... "Better in Time" [...] is a pop and R song set {{in common}} time {{composed}} {{in a moderate}} tempo of eighty beats per minute, in the key of G flat major with a vocal range from the tone of C4 to the note of B5. The song has a sequence of G–Bm–Em–G/D–C as its chord progression. Lyrically the song talks <b>about</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> cannot forget her ex-partner, {{and at the end}} the protagonist knows that [...] "it will all get better in time". Andrea Martin and J. R. Rotem wrote the song, and Rotem composed and produced it. On 29 January 2008, Lewis announced on her website that [...] "Better in Time", along with [...] "Footprints in the Sand", would be released as a double A-side single on 10 March 2010, as her third single in the United Kingdom, with 2008 Sport Relief, a biennial charity organised by Comic Relief and BBC Sport, selecting [...] "Footprints in the Sand" [...] as their official single. It was also her second international single. A new remix of the song was created for the single release. The double A-side was released with another song, [...] "You Bring Me Down", as a B-side.|$|E

"My career {{could be}} divided up into two sections: the first being when I was an out-and-out fast bowler and played for England when I {{probably}} {{should not have}} done; and the second being when I slowed down a bit, learned how to swing the ball and did not play for England when I probably should have done. His final Test was only twelve months after his England debut, and his first and last ODIs were played {{less than a month}} apart. Cricket commentator Colin Bateman opined, [...] "his fleeting taste of Test cricket should have been added to in 1987 and 1988 when he was the most consistent fast bowler in the country, taking 194 wickets, but in 1989, when England were desperate for pace bowlers, his omission amounted to wanton neglect by a regime which questioned his desire". In 1988, when Agnew was selected as a Cricketer of the Year, Wisden recorded this verdict on the contrariness of Agnew's Test career: [...] "Asked about Agnew's omission, the chairman of selectors, P. B. H. May, expressed concern about his fitness – rather a baffling statement to make <b>about</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> bowled more overs than any other fast bowler in the Championship." ...|$|E
50|$|Songs <b>about</b> finding <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> {{will never}} leave flow {{seamlessly}} into songs about taking control of a failed relationship and standing up for oneself.

500|$|In contrast, Jenny Sawyer of The Christian Science Monitor said that, [...] "There {{is much to}} {{love about}} the Harry Potter series, from its brilliantly {{realised}} magical world to its multilayered narrative", however, [...] "A story is <b>about</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> changes. And, puberty aside, Harry doesn't change much. As envisioned by Rowling, he walks the path of good so unwaveringly that his final victory over Voldemort feels, not just inevitable, but hollow". In The New York Times, Christopher Hitchens compared the series to World War Two-era English boarding school stories, and while he wrote that [...] "Rowling has won imperishable renown" [...] for the series as a whole, he also stated that he disliked Rowling's use of deus ex machina, that the mid-book camping chapters are [...] "abysmally long", and Voldemort [...] "becomes more tiresome than an Ian Fleming villain". Catherine Bennett of The Guardian praised Rowling for putting small details from the previous books and making them large in Deathly Hallows, such as Grindelwald being mentioned on a Chocolate Frog Card in the first book. While she points out [...] "as her critics say, Rowling is no Dickens", she says that Rowling [...] "has willed into a fictional being, in every book, legions of new characters, places, spells, rules and scores of unimagined twists and subplots".|$|E
500|$|During the 1951–1952 season, {{the program}} was {{broadcast}} from a converted NBC radio studio. The {{first year of the}} television show was done live; this led to problems as there was not enough time for costume changes; Skelton was on camera for most of the half-hour, including the delivery of a commercial which was written into one of the show's skits. In early 1952, Skelton had an idea for a television sketch <b>about</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> had been drinking not being able to know which way is up. [...] The script was completed and he had the show's production crew build a set that was perpendicular to the stage, so it would give the illusion that someone was walking on walls. [...] The skit, starring his character Willie Lump-Lump, called for the character's wife to hire a carpenter to re-do the living room in an effort to teach her husband a lesson about his drinking. [...] When Willie wakes up there after a night of drinking, he realizes he is not lying on the floor but on the living room wall. [...] Willie's wife goes about the house normally, but to Willie, she appears to be walking on a wall. [...] Within an hour after the broadcast, the NBC switchboard had received 350 calls regarding the show, and Skelton had received more than 2,500 letters about the skit within a week of its airing.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from critics. Todd VanDerWerff, writing for The A.V. Club, rated [...] "Max" [...] an A−. VanDerWerff was unconvinced that the episode, along with [...] "Tempus Fugit", merited being stretched over two parts; however, {{he felt that}} the character of Fenig was [...] "a simultaneous paean to the many, many lives lost in this fictional war and a very real story <b>about</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> could very well live on the edges of our society, driven mad by visions that are only real to himself, visions the rest of us would immediately disregard as unbelievable and surreal". Paula Vitaris, writing for Cinefantastique, rated [...] "Max" [...] one-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris praised the episode's visual effects; however, s{{he felt that the}} two parts of the story would have better served as [...] "a taut one-hour episode". Vitaris also felt that the episode's final act, featuring Mulder on an airplane, saw Mulder uncharacteristically putting civilians at risk and was an example of [...] "out and out bad writing". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, describing it as [...] "tighty, satisfying, witty and touching". Shearman noted that the second half of two-part episodes in the series tended to [...] "drop the ball", but felt that the story arc of [...] "Tempus Fugit" [...] and [...] "Max" [...] was [...] "very solid", calling them [...] "the most satisfying [...] "event" [...] multiparter that The X-Files has ever done".|$|E

Using data from two waves of the National Survey of Families and Households, the authors find that men who hold more positive attitudes <b>about</b> marrying <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> already has children are more likely to enter a union with a single mother. Willingness to marry someone with children also has a positive impact on women’s entry into a union with a man who has children, though only if he has not been married before.

5000|$|Lyrically, Parker views Lonerism {{as being}} {{almost like a}} prequel to {{previous}} album Innerspeaker, stating [...] "is quite a childish album, almost like a persona who turns into the one from Innerspeaker. That's kinda what I hear anyway". Parker later elaborated [...] "For me it's like the last album was singing <b>about</b> <b>someone</b> <b>who's</b> already blissfully in oblivion, so I was already there. Whereas this album is like the child version of that, someone growing up and discovering other people and just realising their place is not involved {{with the rest of}} the world kind of thing. Like discovering that you're a loner." [...] Parker also said that the lyrics are written from a different persona rather than himself and that [...] "It's about the persona of <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> is really isolated - but not necessarily deliberately. Most of the songs are really about other people, being amongst other people. It's really just the idea of being <b>someone</b> <b>who</b> doesn't feel part of the rest of the world, someone trying to figure out where their place amongst everyone else is, and having a really confusing time with it and then slowly accepting that it's in their blood just to be a solitary wanderer. It's meant to put it in a positive light but also a negative light, as the album progresses." ...|$|R
