5|$|Although Benchley {{was known}} for {{misleading}} and fictional autobiographical statements about himself (at one point asserting that he wrote A Tale of Two Cities before being buried at Westminster Abbey), he <b>actually</b> <b>was</b> the great-grandchild of the founder of Benchley, Texas, Henry Wetherby Benchley, who was jailed for his help with the Underground Railroad. Robert Benchley was born on September 15, 1889, in Worcester, Massachusetts, the son of Maria Jane (Moran) and Charles Henry Benchley.|$|E

5|$|In August 1843, {{during a}} break from {{his work on the}} fresco, Etty made what was to prove his final {{overseas}} journey. Since 1839 he had been planning a series of monumental paintings of Joan of Arc, and he wanted to visit places associated with her. Setting out on 16August he spent two weeks touring sites in Rouen, Paris and Orléans associated with her life. Unlike Etty's disastrous prior visits to France, this journey passed without incident, and he found that he <b>actually</b> <b>was</b> coming to enjoy certain aspects of French living.|$|E
50|$|Patients may {{experience}} either micropsia or macropsia. Micropsia is an abnormal visual condition, usually {{occurring in the}} context of visual hallucination, in which affected persons see objects as being smaller than those objects <b>actually</b> <b>are.</b> Macropsia is a condition where the individual sees everything larger than it <b>actually</b> <b>is.</b>|$|R

5|$|After {{the initial}} {{detection}} of a transit signal by Kepler, follow-up observations {{were taken to}} confirm the planetary nature of the candidate. Speckle imaging by the WIYN Telescope {{was used to determine}} the amount of light from nearby, background stars that was present. If not accounted for, this light would have made Kepler-6 appear brighter than it <b>actually</b> <b>was.</b> Consequently, the size of Kepler-6b would have been underestimated. Radial velocity data was taken by HIRES at the Keck I telescope {{in order to determine the}} mass of the planet. Independently, observations were made with the Spitzer Space Telescope at infrared wavelengths of 3.6 and 4.5 micrometres. Along with additional data taken by Kepler, these observations detected the occultation and phase curves of Kepler-6b behind its star.|$|E
5|$|Although Ethel made {{a return}} visit to England in 1948 to shop and visit family and friends, Wodehouse never left America {{after his arrival}} in 1947. It was not until 1965 that the British {{government}} indicated privately that he could return without fear of legal proceedings, and by then he felt too old to make the journey. The biographers Benny Green and Robert McCrum both take the view that this exile benefited Wodehouse's writing, helping him to go on depicting an idealised England seen in his mind's eye, rather than as it <b>actually</b> <b>was</b> in the post-war decades.|$|E
5|$|Apollo tells Veronica that he {{actually}} does want the paternity test. Dick’s father, {{who was involved in}} a corporate crime, appears and berates him for going on the surfing trip in the summer. Apollo takes the paternity test, but the father doesn’t appear. However, Apollo informs Veronica that he <b>actually</b> <b>was</b> a child soldier, enlisting his former roommate to tell her that he wasn’t so that he could ensure his father was genuinely loving. The only reason the father did not show up to the paternity test was that he was detained for having the wrong license plates. Apollo and the father meet at the Sheriff’s office, where they have an emotional reunion. Dick angrily confronts his father, but the next time he is seen, he calls off his trip with Logan. Logan tells Parker this news, and she is disappointed.|$|E

5|$|At 09:35, a Catalina {{made the}} first {{sighting}} of the Ryūjō force. Later that morning, several more sightings of Ryūjō and ships of Kondo's and Mikawa's forces by carrier and other U.S. reconnaissance aircraft followed. Throughout the morning and early afternoon, U.S. aircraft also sighted several Japanese scout aircraft and submarines, leading Fletcher {{to believe that the}} Japanese knew where his carriers were, which <b>actually</b> <b>was</b> not yet the case. Still, Fletcher hesitated to order a strike against the Ryūjō group until he was sure there were no other Japanese carriers in the area. Finally, with no firm word on the presence or location of other Japanese carriers, at 13:40 Fletcher launched a strike of 38 aircraft from Saratoga to attack Ryūjō. However, he kept aircraft in reserve from both U.S. carriers potentially ready should any Japanese fleet carriers be sighted.|$|E
5|$|Born on July 18, 1913, in Vincennes, Indiana, Richard Skelton was {{the fourth}} and {{youngest}} son of Ida Mae (née Fields) and Joseph Elmer Skelton. Joseph, a grocer, died two months before Richard was born; {{he had once been}} a clown with the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus. During Skelton's lifetime there was some dispute about the year of his birth. Author Wesley Hyatt suggests that since he began working at such an early age, Skelton may have claimed he was older than he <b>actually</b> <b>was</b> in order to gain employment. Vincennes neighbors described the Skelton family as being extremely poor; a childhood friend remembered that her parents broke up a youthful romance between her sister and Skelton because they thought he had no future.|$|E
5|$|He {{bought a}} 365-acre (148-hectare) 20-bedroom luxury estate in Rockwood, Surrey in 1995 through {{a chain of}} firms, trusts, and {{offshore}} companies in 1994. The country home's refurbishment abruptly ended in October 1996, shortly {{before the end of}} his wife's second term. He initially denied for eight years that he owned the property and no one paid the bills for the work on the unoccupied mansion. Creditors forced a liquidation sale in 2004 and the Pakistani government claimed the proceeds because the home had been bought with money obtained through corruption. However, he stepped in to claim that he <b>actually</b> <b>was</b> the beneficial owner. , the proceeds were in a liquidator bank account while a civil case continues.|$|E

5|$|Las Casas {{has also}} often {{been accused of}} exaggerating the atrocities he {{described}} in the Indies, some scholars holding that the initial population figures given by him were too high, making the population decline look worse than it <b>actually</b> <b>was,</b> and that epidemics of European disease were the prime cause of the population decline, not violence and exploitation. Demographic studies {{such as those of}} colonial Mexico by Sherburne F. Cook in the mid-20th century suggested that the decline {{in the first years of}} the conquest was indeed drastic – ranging between 80 and 90%, due of course to many different causes, but all ultimately traceable to the arrival of the Europeans. The overwhelming main cause was disease introduced by the Europeans. It has also been noted that exaggeration of numbers was the norm in writing in 16th-century accounts, and both contemporary detractors and supporters of Las Casas were guilty of similar exaggerations.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the {{previous}} Indiana Jones films, Spielberg shot the entire {{film in the}} United States, stating {{he did not want}} to be away from his family. Shooting began on June 18, 2007, in Deming, New Mexico. An extensive chase scene set at the fictional Marshall College was filmed between June 28 and July 7 at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut (where Spielberg's son Theo was studying). To keep in line with the fact the story takes place in the 1950s, several facades were changed, although signs were put up in between shots to tell the public what the store or restaurant <b>actually</b> <b>was.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{the rebels}} did reach their targets, they {{experienced}} further setbacks.

The force that attacked Puerto Barrios was dispatched by policemen and armed dockworkers, {{with many of the}} rebels fleeing back to Honduras. In an effort to regain momentum, the rebels attempted to attack the capital with their planes. These attacks caused little material damage, but they had a significant psychological impact, leading many citizens to believe that the invasion force was more powerful than it <b>actually</b> <b>was.</b>|$|E

These attacks caused little material damage, but they had a significant psychological impact, leading many citizens to believe that the invasion force was more powerful than it <b>actually</b> <b>was.</b> The rebel bombers needed to fly out of the Nicaraguan capital of Managua; as a result, they had a limited payload. A large number of them substituted dynamite or Molotov cocktails for bombs, in an effort to create loud bangs with a lower payload. The planes targeted ammunition depots, parade grounds, and other visible targets.|$|E
5|$|While {{on their}} way to buy jawbreakers at the candy store, the Eds are stopped by Sarah who claims to have found her doll under her bed.

Despite this revelation, the Eds still decide to spend the money, without freeing Jonny. However, while they are enjoying their jawbreakers, Sarah rolls the tire in which Jonny is trapped in down a hill, knocking the three over. The jawbreakers fly out of their mouths and roll down the street, leaving the Eds to chase after them into the sunset.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1982, Aloi and Ringler {{conducted}} a mark and recapture study in the patch of watercress where the snails appeared most densely. Using two methods (Jolly and Schnabel) and two models, they estimated {{a population of about}} 300 snails with a density of four snails per square meter of watercress habitat. These snails have subsequently been identified as Succinea sp. B, not Novisuccinea chittenangoensis. A 1983 collection of 83 snails for use in electrophoretic studies resulted in removal of 24 Novisuccinea chittenangoensis from the population; unfortunately, their identity was not verified at the time of collection, on top of which Novisuccinea chittenangoensis was thought to be more abundant than it <b>actually</b> <b>was.</b> The population of Succinea sp. B expanded rapidly to an estimate of more than 3,000 snails in 1984, whereas counts of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis in 1984 indicated the presence of approximately 100 adults. Counts of live Novisuccinea chittenangoensis from 1995 to 2001 yielded an average of five adults per survey with a high of 12 adults in 2001. and post-reproductive shell counts made {{at the end of each}} activity season from 1987 to 2001 generally identified 4 to 20 Novisuccinea chittenangoensis adults. Subsequent studies have shown that Succinea sp. B outnumbers Novisuccinea chittenangoensis by as much as 10 to 1 in the primary habitat areas.|$|E
