40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the {{formation}} of new ternary hydride Mg 2 FeH 6 (K 2 PtCl 6 type) in a single-step procedure following the process of mechanicalalloying of initial stoichiometric ingredients Mg and Fe under hydrogen. The optimum yield of formation of single phase Mg 2 FeH 6 was achieved by hydrogen (∼ 10 atm.) milling of constituent elements at a speed of 400 rpm for various milling durations. The structuralcharacterization of the ball-milled (2 Mg+Fe) powder was carried out using Philips X-ray diffractometer by taking samples from the <b>attritor</b> <b>mill</b> at regular intervals of time. It was found that the Mg 2 FeH 6 phase starts forming at a milling duration of 14 h and the optimum Mg 2 FeH 6 phase formation was obtained at 20 h. The proportion of this phase was estimated by employing Rietveld refinement analysis of the X-ray powder diffraction data and it was found to be 63 %. This is the highest phase proportion reported so far for the Mg 2 FeH 6 phase when formed from elemental Mg and Fe following the route of mechanicalalloying. Together with the Mg 2 FeH 6 phase, some quantity of Fe (about 37 %) is also present. Fe, being a magnetic impurity, can be removed leaving the Mg 2 FeH 6 content to be nearly 90 - 100 %. However, such purification was not done in the present investigation. We also investigated synthesis of the material obtained by longer milling durations of 25, 28 and 30 h. The XRD patterns for the 25, 28 and 30 h ball-milled materials revealed that the intensity of Mg 2 FeH 6 peaks is reduced in comparison to the Fe peaks. This implies that beyond 20 h, there is no further increase in the phase proportion and the amorphization starts taking place. The post-sintering process of these mechanically alloyed samples did not improve the Mg 2 FeH 6 phase proportion and yield as evidenced by XRD. The X-ray structuralcharacterizations revealed that the as-milled Mg 2 FeH 6 material (milling duration of 20 h; under H 2 pressure ∼ 10 atm., speed ∼ 400 rpm) corresponds to the known face centered cubic structure with lattice parameter a= 0. 6446 (2) nm. The elemental (chemical) compositional analysis was carried out for the mechanically alloyed Mg 2 FeH 6 materials using the EDAX technique. The results confirm the correct stoichiometric ratio of the initial mixture (2 Mg+Fe).

40|$|The {{objective}} of this task was to demonstrate that metal hydrides could be produced by mechanical alloying in the quantities needed to support the tritium production facilities at the Savannah River Site. The objective for the FY 07 portion of this task was to demonstrate the production of Zr-Fe getter materials by mechanical alloying and begin to optimize the milling parameters. Three starting compositions (ratios of elemental Zr and Fe powders) were selected and attritor milled under argon for times of 8 to 60 hours. Hexane and liquid nitrogen were used as process control agents. In general, milling times of at least 24 hours were required to form the desired Zr{sub 2 }Fe and Zr{sub 3 }Fe phases, although {{a considerable amount of}} unalloyed Zr and Fe remained. Milling in liquid nitrogen does not appear to provide any advantages over milling in hexane, particularly due to the formation of ZrN after longer milling times. Carbides of Zr formed during some of the milling experiments in hexane. Formation of carbides during milling appears to be much less of an issue than formation of nitrides, although some of the phases that were not able to be identified in the XRD results may also be carbides. Additional XRD experiments should be designed to improve signal to noise ratio (i. e., longer count times) and use a wider scan range to better identify phases that were not clear in the original data. Elemental Zr was present in the as-milled material but not detected after annealing for milling times of 48 and 60 hours. It may be that after intimate mixing of the powders in the <b>attritor</b> <b>mill</b> the annealing temperature was sufficient to allow for the formation of a Zr-Fe alloy. The phase diagram for the binary Zr-Fe system agrees with this proposition. If this is the case, then the annealing conditions should also be investigated and optimized to form as much of the Zr-Fe alloy as possible in the milled powder. Also, this finding would mean that milling times of more than 48 hours are not necessary. Further investigation of this conversion is necessary, and could provide an opportunity for reducing the amount of unreacted metal powder after milling. Elemental Fe remained in all of the powders after annealing for all of the milling times tested. This may indicate that the ratio of Zr to Fe needs to be increased in order to improve the yield of the desired Zr-Fe alloys. Particle size analysis data are presented to aid in the selection of filters for future hydrogen sorption testing.

All of the following reports are available from the Plutonium Immobilization Program Document Control Center (DCC) at LLNL. In most cases, the documents can also be obtained from the libraries the originating site or from the document's authors. All samples of the various formulations discussed in the following summaries were prepared by one of four processes: Wet-milling, dry-milling, an alkoxide-nitrate process, or <b>attritor</b> <b>milling.</b> The fabrication processes differ primarily in the mixing steps. The wet milling process is the one most commonly used. It is a simple ball milling process where water is added that provides intimate mixing of the materials. The dry milling process is a worst case dry mixing process. The alkoxide-nitrate process provides for very intimate mixing and is used when equilibrium samples are desired. The <b>attritor</b> <b>milling</b> process simulates the process being developed for the Plutonium Immobilization Plant. After mixing, the subsequent calcination and consolidation steps are generally the same. Most samples were consolidated by cold pressing and sintering although some of the earlier samples or Some of the single-phase samples were prepared by hot pressing.

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of composite particle formation during <b>attritor</b> <b>milling</b> of insoluble binary elemental powders {{have been}} examined. The {{effects of processing}} conditions (i. e., mill power, temperature, and charge ratio) on these kinetics were studied. Particle size distributions and fractions of elemental and composite particles were determined as functions of milling time and processing conditions. This allowed the deduction of phenomenological rate constants describing the propensity for fracture and welding during processing. For the mill-operating conditions investigated, the number of particles in the mill generally decreased with milling time, indicating a greater tendency for particle welding than fracture. Moreover, a bimodal size distribution is often obtained {{as a result of}} preferential welding. Copper and chromium 'alloy' primarily by encapsulation of Cr particles within Cu. This form of alloying also occurs in Cu-Nb alloys processed at low mill power and/or for short milling times. For other conditions, however, Cu-Nb alloys develop a lamellar morphology characteristic of mechanically alloyed two-phase ductile metals. Increasing mill power or charge (ball-to-powder weight) ratio (CR) increases the rate of composite particle formation...|$|R

40|$|Title {{from first}} page of PDF file (viewed November 22, 2010) Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 54 - 57) The binary system of tungsten-copper lacks mutual solubility between its components. The refractory properties of tungsten and the high conductivity of copper are used to produce functionally graded composites. Production of W-Cu composites is usually done by means of copper infiltration into porous tungsten or through liquid phase sintering of a pressed W-Cu powder mixture. A wide range of experiments have been reported showing how different powder preparation methods influence the sintering behavior of W-Cu composites. Tungsten-copper mixtures are produced in various ways such as mechanical mixing, <b>attritor</b> <b>milling,</b> oxidized milling followed by hydrogen reduction, and chemical coating of copper on tungsten. This research effort {{is the first time}} where the study is focused on the influence of different powder preparation with respect to the sintering behavior. Also, an effort has been made to study the effect of different sintering methods, such as microwave sintering, spark plasma sintering, and conventional sintering on the densities of W-Cu. Further novel consolidation routes are employed to identify the advantages over conventional hot pressing and sintering. This study documents the differences in sintering response of W-Cu mixtures produced by a wide range of contemporary techniques...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Engineering) [...] University of the Witwatersrand, Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment, School of Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering, 2012,. The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to improve alumina (Al 2 O 3) mechanical and electrical properties by reinforcement using multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and titanium carbide (TiC). The {{objective of}} the study was achieved with interesting and challenging difficulties along the way. The MWCNTs were initially coated with boron nitride (hBN) in order to improve the Alumina-CNTs interface which was previously discovered to be weak and also to protect them from reacting with Al 2 O 3 during sintering. The coating of CNTs with hBN was done using nitridation method. This method was unsuccessful since {{it was not possible to}} coat each CNT individually. Dispersing hBN coated CNTs proved to be impossible without pealing the off the hBN coating. The “flaking off “of the hBN coating from the CNTs revealed that the CNT-hBN interface was weak; therefore uncoated CNTs were used for this study. The starting powders (Al 2 O 3, TiC and CNTs) were individually dispersed before they were mixed together. TiC and Al 2 O 3 were dispersed using an ultrasonic probe which was done successfully. The CNTs were dispersed by an ultrasonic probe and then <b>attritor</b> <b>milled</b> with the use of polyvinylpyrolidone (PVP) as a dispersant. The dispersed Al 2 O 3 and TiC (30 wt...|$|R
40|$|In 1985, {{employees}} in the china clay industry were offered chest x ray examinations and 4478 (52. 6 % of the total workforce) accepted. Of these, 4167 workers and pensioners of the largest single employer also completed occupational histories, respiratory symptom questionnaires, and underwent ventilatory capacity tests. The x ray readings (read to the 1980 ILO classification) of the 4167 workers and pensioners were analysed to seek relations between the indices of pulmonary health and occupational exposure. The information available, particularly on occupational history, was more detailed than in previous studies of 1961, 1977, and 1981. Analyses show that in the improved operating conditions of recent years the average worker exposed to dust only after 1971 would not expect to develop category 1 pneumoconiosis through a full working life {{in any of the}} industry's occupations. For those with exposure before 1971 the category reached will depend on the amount of early exposure, but the rate of development of pneumoconiosis since 1971 is about half that before 1971. The milling of china stone, a practice that ceased over 15 years ago in the china clay industry, had by far the largest effect on x ray category, whereas of the current occupations, employment in china clay <b>attritor</b> <b>mills</b> has the greatest effect. Ventilatory capacity is related to x ray category as well as age, and results for loss of ventilatory capacity in relation to age, x ray category, and smoking habits were similar to the results in previous studies. Respiratory symptoms are associated with smoking class and a loss in ventilatory capacity (FVC or FEV 1), FEV 1 being the most dominant. Allowing for this, there was no further effect for years of exposure, x ray category, or age...|$|R

The isothermal annealing of 100 h mechanically milled powder has been done at 700 0 C for 20, 40 and 60 hours. The mechanically alloyed powders are characterized using X-ray diffraction, differential thermal analysis and transmission electron microscopy techniques.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Considering its {{advantage}} of low density and favorable insulation properties, {{there are several}} applications for lightweight autoclaved aerated concrete of uniform cellular structure. The raw materials for the manufacturing of cellular concrete are Portland cement, finely grounded sand and lime. These are batched and mixed with water and metallic aluminum powder finely divided. There is a reaction between the aluminum powder and hydroxides forming millions of hydrogen bubbles throughout the mixture. The aluminum powder is the highest cost component, and {{the objective of this}} work is replacing it for another gas forming agent, like recycled foil. The foils are grinded in a high energy ball <b>mill</b> (<b>attritor).</b> Quartz sand is mixed with aluminum foil to reduce the time required for grinding, obtaining spherical particles and ensuring a uniform distribution of aluminum in the gas forming agent. The activity of this gas forming agent was determined by the gas volumetric technique. Average particle size and compressive strength of the samples were measured. The relationship between volume of the gas released during the reaction and milling conditions are presented, showing its viability for producing a high quality cellular concrete...|$|R
