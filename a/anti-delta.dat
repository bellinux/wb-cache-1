40|$|Delta antigen (delta) is a {{transmissible}} agent requiring hepatitis B virus (HBV) for its replication. Antibody to delta (<b>anti-delta)</b> {{was present}} in nine of 71 (13 %) British HBV carriers: six were intravenous drug abusers and two were haemophiliacs. <b>Anti-delta</b> was negative in 30 HBsAg positive homosexuals. Cirrhosis was common in patients with <b>anti-delta</b> and those with <b>anti-delta</b> positive cirrhosis were significantly younger than those with <b>anti-delta</b> negative cirrhosis. In British HBV carriers delta infection is associated with intravenous drug abuse and haemophilia and perhaps a more rapid progression of chronic liver disease...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{depletion}} of differential B cell and xenoreactive natural antibodies (XNA) by <b>anti-delta</b> and anti-mu injections was analyzed in adult mice. Sequential treatment with <b>anti-delta</b> and then anti-mu induces a complete {{depletion of}} B cells and XNA and represents a potential approach to induce xenograft tolerance. METHODS: Adult mice were injected with anti-mu, <b>anti-delta,</b> <b>anti-delta</b> then anti-mu, or control isotype monoclonal antibodies from day 0 to day 14. The different B-cell populations {{were analyzed by}} FACS and immunohistology. Ig production was tested by ELISA. XNA were analyzed by FACS. RESULTS: Anti-mu injections induced a depletion of IgMhigh, immature B cells, marginal zone B cells, and B 1 cells and an increase of IgG-XNA production. <b>Anti-delta</b> injections induced mature conventional IgDhigh B-cell depletion and increased IgM-XNA production. Interestingly, sequential injections of <b>anti-delta</b> then anti-mu induced a depletion of immature B cells, mature B cells (MZ, B 2, and B 1), and XNA. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that mature B-cell depletion in adult mice {{can be obtained by}} mAb injections and depends on the surface immunoglobulin cross-linking threshold. Indeed, anti-mu mAb depleted IgMhigh B cells (MZ and B 1) and <b>anti-delta,</b> IgDhigh B cells (B 2). The differential B-cell suppression shows that conventional B cells are responsible in the IgG-XNA production and MZ and B 1 cells in the IgM-XNA production. Sequential repeated injections of <b>anti-delta</b> then anti-mu mAb depleted all B-cell populations and suppressed the whole XNA production...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} anti-mu and <b>anti-delta</b> on the primary in vitro IgM {{response}} of murine splenocytes to thymus-dependent (trinitrophenylated erythrocytes) and thymus-independent (trinitrophenylated brucella) forms of trinitrophenyl was studied. The {{results indicate that}} either anti-mu or <b>anti-delta</b> can block the response of adult splenocytes to the thymus-dependent antigen. The thymus-dependent responses of neonatal splenocytes that bear a low concentration of IgD were also abrogated by treatment with <b>anti-delta.</b> In contrast, anti-mu, but not <b>anti-delta,</b> blocked the response of adult splenocytes to the thymus-independent antigen used. These results indicate that both IgM and IgD are receptors required for triggering cells by a thymus-dependent antigen but that only IgM receptors are required for triggering by the thymus-independent antigen used...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} (i) the phase {{transition}} between a {{quark gluon plasma}} (QGP) and a hadron gas and (ii) the number of resonance degrees of freedom in the hadronic phase on the single inclusive distributions of 16 different types of produced hadrons for Au + Au collisions at AGS energies is studied. We have used an exact numerical solution of the relativistic hydrodynamical equations without free parameters which, because of its 3 -d character, constitutes a considerable improvement over the classical Landau solution. Using two different equations of state (eos) - one containing a phase transition from QGP to the Hadronic Phase and two versions of a purely hadronic eos- {{we find that the}} first one gives an overall better description of the Au + Au experimental data at AGS energies. We reproduce and analyse measured meson and proton spectra and also make predictions for anti-protons, deltas, <b>anti-deltas</b> and hyperons. The low mt enhancement in π − spectra is explained by baryon number conservation and strangeness equilibration. We also find that negative kaon data are more sensitive to the eos, as well as the K − /π − ratio. All hyperons and deltas are sensitive to the presence of a phase transition in the forward rapidity region. ¯p, Ω an...|$|R

In agreement with others, our data indicated that, in most instances, lymphocytes from patients with CLL respond poorly to PHA. One {{of the most important}} findings in this study is the enhancement of PHA responsiveness by <b>anti-delta.</b> Lymphocytes that exhibited reduced responsiveness to PHA alone, when pre-treated with <b>anti-delta,</b> showed transformation greater than the sum of the <b>anti-delta</b> plus PHA responses...|$|E
40|$|Cross-linking {{of surface}} IgM or IgD B-cell receptors (BCR) with {{appropriate}} anti-Ig antibodies induces IgM(high) or IgD(high) B-cell depletion, respectively. The {{aim of this}} paper is to analyze how injections of <b>anti-delta</b> followed by anti-mu monoclonal antibodies (mAb) can deplete and suppress B cells and then induce T-independent type 2 antigen tolerance in adult mice even after treatment is stopped. The experimental protocol consisted of three daily injections of <b>anti-delta</b> mAb followed by repeated injections of anti-mu mAb. It shows that a sequential injection of <b>anti-delta</b> and anti-mu mAb induces B-cell depletion and T-independent type 2 response downregulation. Morever, the T-dependent response is maintained, except for the IgG 3 isotype. After clearance of the <b>anti-delta</b> mAb from the circulation, B cells reappear as an IgD(+) IgM(-) B-cell population in the bone marrow (BM) and spleen. The origin of IgD(+) IgM(-) cells was studied in scid mouse transfer models. We show that IgD(+) IgM(-) B cells are not mature cells reexpressing sIgD but BM-derived cells that require a T-cell presence to be developed. The lack of sIgM expression by posttranscriptional regulation and the need of T-cell help for escaping anti-mu negative selection suggest strongly that this population had properties similar to those of anergized B cells. These results support the potential use of sequential injections of <b>anti-delta</b> and anti-mu in the prevention of xenograft rejection...|$|E
40|$|We {{have shown}} that a foreign protein Ag (the F(ab) {{fragment}} of rabbit IgG) becomes a particularly effective tolerogen when it is targeted to B lymphocytes in vivo. This is done by injecting the Ag intravenously into mice {{in the form of}} the F(ab) fragment of rabbit anti-mouse IgD antibody (F(ab)) rabbit <b>anti-delta).</b> Our hypothesis is that resting B cells are tolerogenic APC for CD 4 + T cells in unprimed animals, and induce Ag-specific nonresponsiveness in the Th cell compartment by presenting Ag without appropriate costimulatory signals. In this report, we find that Ag-activated T cells appear to be resistant to tolerance induction, because F(ab) rabbit <b>anti-delta</b> given 5 days after challenge with rabbit F(ab) in alum adjuvant has little or no effect of the subsequent antibody response. Tolerance also fails in this model when B cells are activated independently of Ag by simultaneous injection of activating concentrations of divalent, IgG mouse <b>anti-delta</b> at the same time as F(ab) rabbit <b>anti-delta.</b> Finally, nonresponsiveness in the T cell compartment is not limited to a lesion in T cell help for the antibody response, because T cells from mice treated with F(ab) rabbit <b>anti-delta</b> and then primed with rabbit F(ab) fragments in CFA show reduced T cell proliferation and IL- 2 production when restimulated with Ag in vitro...|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} the epidemiology of infection with delta (delta) agent in a Swedish city, 181 chronic carriers of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and 599 patients with acute, self-limited hepatitis B were analyzed for delta antigen and antibody to delta antigen (<b>anti-delta).</b> The study covered {{the period from}} 1970 to 1981.

40|$|This study {{compares the}} effects of soluble intact (IgG) and F(ab') 2 rabbit anti-mu and <b>anti-delta</b> {{antibodies}} on mouse B cells. The results show that while the F(ab') 2 antibodies to both isotypes induce polyclonal B cell proliferation, the IgG antibodies are not mitogenic, but rather inhibit DNA synthesis induced by the homologous F(ab') 2 fragments. Furthermore, intact anti-mu antibodies inhibit mitogenesis induced by F(ab') 2 <b>anti-delta,</b> and vice versa. However, the intact antibodies to both isotypes promote early changes characteristic of B-cell activation, namely, increased Ia antigen expression, and priming for a facilitated proliferative response to F(ab') 2 anti-Ig. In addition, F(ab') 2 anti-mu and <b>anti-delta</b> both induce the breakdown of phosphatidylinositol phospholipids in B cells, an early consequence of Ig receptor cross-linking which {{may be involved in}} the induction of cell growth. These results therefore indicate that stimulating mature B cells via IgM or IgD receptors produces indistinguishable early effects, and that cross-linking Fc and surface Ig receptors by intact anti-Ig generates a dominant inhibitory signal, regardless of which isotype is involved...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Given {{the role}} of {{xenoreactive}} natural antibodies (XNA) in the pathogenesis of xenograft rejection, we tested whether the administration of anti-mu or <b>anti-delta</b> monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) in adult rats would suppress the generation of XNA. METHODS: Adult LOU/C (Igkappa- 1 a) rats were treated with anti-mu or <b>anti-delta</b> mAbs after nonlethal total body irradiation and bone marrow transplantation from congenic LOU/C (Igkappa- 1 b) rats. The differentiation of donor bone marrow (BM) -driven Igkappa- 1 b+ B cells and XNA production were analyzed. RESULTS: Both anti-mu and <b>anti-delta</b> mAbs arrested B-cell differentiation in the BM. In anti-mu-treated rats, there was a total depletion of donor-driven, peripheral Igkappa- 1 b+ B cells, secreting cells, and circulating XNA of the Igkappa- 1 b allotype. In anti-delta-treated rats, {{a significant number of}} Igkappa- 1 b+ B cells, which did not express membrane IgD, "escaped" deletion and partially repopulated peripheral lymphoid organs. This B-cell population was active in the production of XNA, as revealed by the high serum levels of XNA in these animals. CONCLUSIONS: Anti-mu administration resulted in arrest of B-cell differentiation and in down-regulation of IgM and IgG XNA production in adult rats. These data suggest that the use of anti-mu mAbs may be a useful approach to suppress the production of XNA and prevent xenograft rejection. Furthermore, we suggest that the B-cell population responsible for the production of XNA in adult rats belongs to a B-cell lineage expressing low levels of membrane IgD and "escaping" deletion in the BM upon <b>anti-delta</b> treatment...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a {{major cause}} of chronic liver disease in {{southern}} Italy. In the same area superinfection with the delta agent is endemic. To assess the prevalence of delta infection in a large population of patients with acute and chronic HBV related liver disease and to look for differential features among delta infected and uninfected subjects sera from 592 consecutive HBsAg positive patients were tested for the delta/anti-delta system by RIA. In no case was delta Ag found in serum. The prevalence of <b>anti-delta</b> was low in acute hepatitis (6. 6 %) and in asymptomatic carriers (6. 4 %) but raised in chronic active hepatitis with or without cirrhosis (52. 3 %). A decrease in frequency of <b>anti-delta</b> was seen in inactive cirrhosis (38. 8 %) and in hepatocellular carcinoma (11. 9 %). A younger mean age of delta-infected subjects was observed in each type of chronic liver disease. Our data confirm that delta agent superinfection is definitely associated with severe chronic active liver disease.

40|$|The anti-arsonate immune {{response}} of A/J mice {{is characterized by}} the occurrence of several recurrent idiotypes with a different temporal pattern of expression. The CRI-A idiotype is typically a memory idiotype since it appears late in the primary and dominates the secondary as well as subsequent {{immune response}}s. The CRI-C idiotype is present throughout the responses, including the primary one. Naive adult A/J mice treated repeatedly with anti-mu or <b>anti-delta</b> monoclonal antibodies exhibit a completely different balance of HSA(low) and HSA(high) B cell subsets and an opposite idiotype profile after immunization with p-azophenylarsonate coupled to hemocyanin. Anti-mu treatment leads to a striking enhancement of the HSA(low) cell subset associated with an earlier important synthesis of CRI-A(+) antibodies, while <b>anti-delta</b> treatment enhances significantly the HSA(high) compartment with a strong decrease of CRI-A and persistence of CRI-C 1 antibodies. Semiquantitative PCR analysis reveals that the presence of CRI-A transcripts is associated with the HSA(low) compartment, while CRI-C transcripts are mainly associated with HSA(high) B cell subsets. This has been demonstrated with spleen cells of adult A/J mice treated with anti-mu or <b>anti-delta</b> antibodies and also with purified B cell subsets of unimmunized adult A/J mice and on neonatal spleen cells. It appears that the memory (CRI-A) idiotype is selected into the HSA(low) B cell subset before antigen arrival. FLWINSCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E

To determine whether the cross-linking of B cell membrane IgD and/or the resulting B cell activation that follows contribute to the generation of the polyclonal IgG 1 response, we examined the abilities of three sets of <b>anti-delta</b> mAb or mAb fragments to stimulate polyclonal IgG 1 production.

Both antigen and <b>anti-delta</b> had to be present for this effect, which was hapten-specific and did not occur in C 57 BL/L mice, which lack the Ig 5 - 1 allotype of the delta-chain detected in this system. Preculture with anti-mu serum plus antigen, in contrast, did not cause tolerance induction in adult spleen B cells of either strain. These results suggest that the surface IgD may act as a failsafe receptor to prevent tolerance induction in adult B cells. Tolerance studies with spleen cells from mice with markedly reduced numbers of IgD+ve cells, because of regimen of repeated injections of <b>anti-delta</b> serum beginning at birth (delta-suppressed mice), confirmed the importance of membrane IgD in preventing tolerance, because such delta- suppressed mice were hypersusceptible to tolerance by antigen alone.

The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of HDV genotypes by direct sequencing in patients with chronic delta hepatitis in Izmir, Turkey. Design and methodsSerum samples from 32 chronic hepatitis patients (21 males, 11 females; mean age 44. 2 years, range 23 – 70 years) with <b>anti-delta</b> positivity were analyzed for hepatitis B and C serologies. After reverse transcription, cDNA of partial delta antigen was amplified by in-house nested PCR. The products of the HDV PCR were bidirectionally sequenced with internal primers using Big Dye Terminator DNA Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) and ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer (Perkin Elmer, USA).

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the ability of resting B cells, acting as antigen- presenting cells, to induce tolerance to soluble protein antigens in mice, using an antigen targeted specifically to B cells. We inject mice intravenously with ultracentrifuged Fab fragments of rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin D (IgD) (Fab <b>anti-delta).</b> Treatment with Fab <b>anti-delta</b> results in profound tolerance to challenge with 100 micrograms Fab nonimmune rabbit Ig (Fab NRG), precipitated in alum, as measured by antibody production. Tolerance to rabbit Fab is antigen specific, since the treated mice make normal antibody responses to a control antigen, chicken Ig. Tolerance is dependent on antigen presentation by B cells, since intravenous injection of soluble Fab NRG, which is not targeted to B cells, results in a much lower frequency and degree of tolerance, especially at lower doses. T cell help in this system is affected, since T cells from Fab anti-delta-treated mice fail to provide help for an adoptive primary antibody response to Fab NRG when transferred together with normal B cells into severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. The antigen-specific B cell compartment is also affected during tolerance induction, since B cells from treated animals make less antibody than normal B cells when transferred into SCID mice with normal T cells. Although the mechanism of nonresponsiveness in the helper T cell compartment remains to be determined, {{we think it is}} likely that the precursors of helper T cells are inactivated or deleted by encountering antigen presented by small, resting B cells, which lack accessory signals necessary to induce helper T cell proliferation and differentiation to effector function.

40|$|The CH {{family of}} murine B-cell lymphomas {{includes}} several members that {{are sensitive to}} growth inhibition when their membrane IgM (mIgM) receptors are cross-linked by anti-mu chain, anti-kappa chain, or anti-idiotypic antibodies. These lymphomas are IgM+, Ia+, and IgD +/- and resemble neonatal B cells {{in terms of their}} exquisite sensitivity to anti-IgM-mediated negative signaling as a model for tolerance induction. In this report, we describe the properties of one of these lymphomas, CH 33, which had been transfected with a construct containing an allotypically different delta chain constant region and the heavy chain variable region fragment from S 107 (T 15 idiotype positive). This transfected cell line allowed us to investigate the possibility that membrane IgD (mIgD) and mIgM can mediate different signals. Our results show that the transfected cells retained their exquisite sensitivity to anti-IgM-mediated growth inhibition; however, crosslinking of IgD with <b>anti-delta</b> chain antibody did not inhibit their growth. Furthermore, even prolonged pretreatment with anti-IgD antibodies did not affect cell growth nor did it modulate the inhibitory effects of anti-IgM antibody. Moreover, identical results were obtained with clones of CH 33 that express significant amounts of endogenous IgD. Thus, the failure of mIgD to deliver a negative signal does not reflect a defect in the transfected IgD but appears to be a general property of IgD in these cells. The mIgD was shown to mediate transmembrane signals because <b>anti-delta</b> chain treatment resulted in Ca 2 + mobilization in transfected CH 33 cells and capping of those receptors. We conclude that mIgD can mediate qualitatively different signals than mIgM can and that mIgD expression per se is not sufficient to change the functional phenotype of immature B cells...|$|E

40|$|An 18 yr old {{previously}} well male Taiwanese {{was admitted}} with malaise, anorexia, and jaundice for two weeks. Results of liver tests were compatible with acute hepatitis. On day 1, he was seronegative for HBsAg, IgM anti-HAV, IgM anti-HBc, IgM anti-CMV, and IgM EBV capsid Ab, but positive for <b>anti-delta</b> {{in association with}} anti-HBc and anti-HBs. At follow up on day 5 HBsAg converted to positive with decreasing titre of anti-HBs. On day 19, the titre of HBsAg increased concomitantly with loss of anti-HBs. The results of these serological profiles indicated that this patient was a previously unrecognised HBsAg carrier, who developed acute hepatitis delta virus superinfection with transient loss of HBsAg. This phenomenon {{should be kept in}} mind in the serodiagnosis of acute viral hepatitis, especially in areas of high HBV prevalence...|$|E
40|$|From the {{observed}} {{results of the}} space distribution of quasars we deduced that neutrino mass is about 10 ^(- 1) eV. The fourth stable elementary particle (delta particle) with mass about 10 ^(0) eV can help explain the energy resource mechanism in quasars, cosmic ultra-high energy particles, {{as well as the}} flatness of spiral galaxy rotation curves. The blue bump and IR bump in the quasar irradiation spectra, as well as the peaks of EBL (Extra-galactic Background Light) around 10 ^(0) eV and 10 ^(- 1) eV, are related to the annihilation of delta particle with <b>anti-delta</b> particle and neutrino with anti-neutrino respectively. This enlightens us to explore the reason for missing solar neutrinos and energy resource in a new manner. Appendix is the theory part, which also related to island universe and BSM.

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of hepatitis D virus (HDV) infection {{in patients with}} hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in the mid-United States is not well defined. We tested 65 patients seen between 1983 and 1986 with HBV infection in Denver for evidence of coexisting HDV infection. Five patients had <b>anti-delta</b> (δ) antibody. The {{prevalence of}} HDV infection was higher in patients with chronic hepatitis B (4 / 37) than in patients with acute hepatitis B (1 / 28). The prevalence of HDV infection in male homosexuals (3 / 32) was similar to reported figures, but the incidence of δ-infection in intravenous drug users in Denver was usually low (1 / 16). In comparison to Los Angeles, New York, southern Italy, and Sweden, Denver {{appears to have a}} low incidence of HDV infection, which probably reflects its low prevalence in the drug-using population...|$|E
40|$|Sepharose-bound anti-immunoglobulins, {{which are}} potent mitogens for normal adult B cells, are not mitogenic for tumor cells freshly {{isolated}} from mice carrying the B-cell leukemia BCL 1. However, after 4 {{or more days}} of in vitro cultivation, BCL 1 cells can be stimulated to divide by either anti-mu or <b>anti-delta</b> antibodies. These results suggest that in vitro cultivation of BCL 1 cells results in their differentiation into more mature cells which can be triggered to proliferate by their interaction with anti-Ig antibodies. Addition of T-cell helper factors to anti-Ia treated BCL 1 cells results in their differentiation into Ig-secreting cells. These results indicate that surface Ig molecules on BCL 1 cells are capable of delivering an activation signal to the cells but that the cells require a second signal from T cells for induction of Ig secretion...|$|E

40|$|The {{kinetics}} of {{delta antigen}} (HDAg) and <b>anti-delta</b> antibody (anti-HD) was analyzed in 22 acute delta hepatitis infections (11 coinfections and 11 superinfections), with an enzyme immunoassay developed by Organon Teknika and with two commercially available assays: Deltassay, {{a test for}} HDAg from Noctech and Abbott <b>anti-delta</b> enzyme immunoassay, a test for anti-HD from Abbott Laboratories. In seven cases, HDAg was detected with the Organon assay but not with Deltassay. These discrepancies were {{not related to the}} type of hepatitis delta virus infection. All samples from these patients taken beyond week 4 of illness were found anti-HD positive with both the Organon and Abbott anti-HD assays. These data reflect the lack of sensitivity of Deltassay. In no instance were HDAg and anti-HD present simultaneously when tested with the Organon assays. On the contrary, 10 sera among the 28 that were HDAg positive with the Organon assay also were found anti-HD positive with the Abbott test. We suspected that the test procedure recommended by Abbott (a one-step competitive assay) may have yielded false-positive anti-HD results when HDAg present in the sera reacted with peroxidase-labeled anti-HD of the kit. To determine the specificity of the simultaneous presence of HDAg and anti-HD, these 10 sera were retested with the Abbott anti-HD assay, but by a modified two-step procedure that avoided contact between sera and labeled antibody. For six sera a negative result was obtained with the second procedure, suggesting that a false anti-HD reaction occurred with the standard test procedure. For four sera a positive result with both procedures was indicative of the simultaneous presence of HDAg and anti-HD. In conclusion, assay for HDAg was found very convenient for the early diagnosis of acute hepatitis delta virus infections. Seroconversion to anti-HD could be used for a late diagnosis 2 to 5 weeks after the beginning of illness. However, anti-HD results obtained with one-step competitive assays have to be interpreted carefully in HDAg-positive sera...|$|E
