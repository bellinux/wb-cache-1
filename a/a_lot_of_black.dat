5|$|Unfortunately, as I tell {{my white}} friends, we as black people, we're {{never going to}} be {{successful}}, not because of you white people, but because of other black people. When you're black, {{you have to deal with}} so much crap in your life from other black people. It's a dirty, dark secret; I'm glad it's coming out. One of the reasons we're {{never going to be}} successful as a whole, because of other black people. And for some reason we are brainwashed to think, if you're not a thug or an idiot, you're not black enough. If you go to school, make good grades, speak intelligent, and don't break the law, you're not a good black person. And it's a dirty, dark secret. There are <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> people who are unintelligent, who don't have success. It's best to knock a successful black person down because they're intelligent, they speak well, they do well in school, and they're successful... We're the only ethnic group who say, 'Hey, if you go to jail, it gives you street cred.' It's just typical BS that goes on when you're black, man.|$|E

500|$|The New York Times quoted Wheeler Parker, {{a cousin}} of Till's, who said, [...] "I was hoping that one day she [...] would admit it, so it matters {{to me that she}} did, and it gives me some satisfaction. It's {{important}} to people understanding how the word of a white person against a black person was law, and <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> people lost their lives because of it. It really speaks to history, it shows what black people went through in those days." ...|$|E

It would have been better if she had killed Rap Brown and/or Stokely Carmichael, but when she killed Dr. King, she lost.|$|R
500|$|In her 1986 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Tina {{was asked about}} her preference in men. She said, [...] "In {{the early part of}} my life, I liked light-skinned guys better than dark-skinned guys. The people I've dated since my divorce have been white because I haven't been in a circle where there were <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> people. I can't say that I'm not still attracted to black men. My preference is a very light-skinned black man. And my preference in white men is blond. But I haven't seen any black or white men that I've liked lately." ...|$|E
500|$|Johnson {{appointed}} Marshall to the Supreme Court {{following the}} retirement of Justice Tom C. Clark, saying that this was [...] "the right thing to do, {{the right time to}} do it, the right man and the right place." [...] Marshall was confirmed as an Associate Justice by a Senate vote of 69–11 on August 31, 1967. Johnson confidently predicted to one biographer, Doris Kearns Goodwin, that <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> baby boys would be named [...] "Thurgood" [...] in honor of this choice (in fact, Kearns's research of birth records in New York and Boston indicates that Johnson's prophecy did not come true).|$|E
500|$|A {{month before}} {{she made her}} debut on-screen, Toyah was {{described}} as being Janice's (Vicky Entwistle) fourteen-year-old illegitimate daughter, who would become [...] "the scourge of every Weatherfield Comprehensive teacher". During {{an interview with the}} Daily Record's Polly Graham, Taylor stated [...] "Toyah's gobby and cocky and makes her parents' life a misery. But it's brilliant playing her, it's more fun than playing somebody nice." [...] Graham explained that both Toyah and her stepsister, Leanne (Jane Danson) were well known to the police for under-age drinking and burglary. Taylor said that she hated her character's clothes, as they were too revealing for her. She explained [...] "In the beginning, the clothes that Toyah wore were terrible. I was very conscious of my bum hanging out from these tiny mini-skirts. There are a lot of girls who wear those tarty skirts, but I never felt comfortable in that sort of thing." [...] Taylor also disliked Toyah's make-up, which was initially bright pink lipstick, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> eyeliner and no foundation.|$|E
5000|$|Ellroy {{addresses}} the book's strong racial overtone {{in an interview}} with Rolling Stone.Oh yeah... You're supposed to be seduced and shocked by the casual racism in Blood's a Rover. This book is so full of race shit, it's fucking hilarious shit. There's <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> scenes <b>of</b> <b>black</b> people and white people cracking jokes. And as much as the people grandstand about race in this book, they're driven by racial animus and the idea of racial reconciliation. Because of political correctness we are losing the outrageousness of humor. I always think of Frank O'Connor's line from a million years ago: [...] "a literature that cannot be vulgarized is not literature at all and will not last." ...|$|R
50|$|I {{think what}} Black Arts did was inspire <b>a</b> whole <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>Black</b> people to write. Moreover, {{there would be}} no {{multiculturalism}} movement without Black Arts. Latinos, Asian Americans, and others all say they began writing {{as a result of the}} example <b>of</b> the 1960s. <b>Blacks</b> gave the example that you don't have to assimilate. You could do your own thing, get into your own background, your own history, your own tradition and your own culture. I think the challenge is for cultural sovereignty and Black Arts struck a blow for that.|$|R
6000|$|The second-lieutenant, Hepworth Paterson, a nice kind-hearted young Scotchman, {{looked up}} at him a little curiously, and said, [...] "Why, {{what do you mean by}} dispersing, Lemarchant?

500|$|Dallas {{was briefly}} hospitalised with the wounds to his thigh and heel on 14April, but sneaked out {{four days later}} to rejoin his squadron. His {{departure}} may have been spurred by news of the capture of his friend Richard Minifie. As {{soon as he was}} able, Dallas was flying again. By 26April, he had increased his official score to 37, and been awarded the Distinguished Service Order for operations at Dunkirk. He had also several times been recommended for the Victoria Cross, but it was never approved. His casual attitude towards claiming victories was noted by a member of No.40 Squadron, Cecil Usher, who related that Dallas once remarked of an opponent, [...] "...he went down belching <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> smoke and after he had gone down someways one of his planes came off, but I didn't see him crash so I shan't claim him." [...] On 2May, during a lull in the fighting at Flanders, Dallas took off in his S.E.5 to taunt his foes. He strafed the German base at La Brayelle to [...] "attract attention" [...] before dropping a package on the aerodrome with a note reading, [...] "If you won't come up here and fight, herewith a pair of boots for work on the ground, pilots for the use of". He then circled in mist until troops came to examine the bundle, whereupon he dropped two bombs and again shot up the base, causing [...] "general panic". News of this singular exploit reportedly provoked laughter from Field Marshal Haig and RAF founder General Sir Hugh Trenchard, two men not known for their sense of humour. While adding to his score and leading his squadron into combat, Dallas had begun thinking beyond the war. He was pleading with his father to quit the dangerous job of mining, with hints that he would support his parents by pioneering aviation in Australia. [...] He also harboured a long-standing ambition of flying from England back to Australia, which would be a record-setting journey.|$|E

2500|$|The {{request was}} turned down by the Los Angeles Times, but several others agreed {{including}} Premiere magazine, Vogue, Interview and Rolling Stone. [...] The Los Angeles Times explained they did not give writer approval. [...] The editor of Premiere noted that the request created internal discussions that resulted in changes at the magazine: [...] "Had we {{had a history of}} putting <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> writers on stories about the movie industry we'd be in a stronger position. But we didn't. It was an interesting challenge he laid down. It caused some personnel changes. We've hired a black writer and a black editor." ...|$|E
5000|$|Even though Jackie Robinson {{became the}} first black player in modern major league history in April 1947, Larry Doby, who broke the American League color barrier that July, felt that Gibson was the best black player in 1945, 1946, and 1947. Doby said in an {{interview}} later, [...] "One {{of the things that was}} disappointing and disheartening to <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the <b>black</b> players at the time was that Jack was not the best player. The best was Josh Gibson. I think thats one of the reasons why Josh died so early - he was heartbroken." ...|$|R
500|$|Lubezki {{compared}} the cinematic similarities to Sleepy Hollow, notably the monochromatic look of both films. He also chose a specific color palette backdrop for A Series of Unfortunate Events. [...] "The story is very episodic, so we picked {{a different color}} scheme for each section. For example", Lubezki continued, [...] "Count Olaf's house has <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> greens, <b>blacks</b> and grays; the house of Uncle Monty has <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> greens and browns {{and a bit of}} yellow; and the house of Aunt Josephine has blues and blacks." [...] The railroad crossing set was constructed on a cyclorama, which was the most ambitious setpiece for the art department on using elements of [...] "in house" [...] special effects and matte paintings.|$|R
5000|$|According to Fox News, {{petitions}} with tens {{of thousands}} of signatures were also being ignored, and some groups that were signed with certain labels or companies or were affiliated with various committee members have even been put up for nomination with no discussion at all. The committee has also been accused of largely ignoring certain genres. According to author Brett Milano, [...] "entire genres get passed over, particularly progressive rock, '60s Top 40, New Orleans funk and <b>a</b> whole <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> music." [...] In contrast, since the mid-2000s (decade), numerous hip hop artists have been inducted, including Tupac Shakur (class of 2017), N.W.A (class of 2016) and Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five (class of 2007).|$|R
2500|$|The Guardians Mikki Kendall wrote, [...] "In 'Flawless' (a {{track that}} leaked as 'Bow Down' over the summer), Beyonce quotes from author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's TedX talk 'We {{should all be}} feminists', adroitly {{addressing}} {{the idea that she}} is somehow anti-feminist for not fitting into the boxes others project onto her. It's clear that like <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> American women, the mainstream middle class white feminist narratives with which we are so familiar aren't necessarily compatible with Beyonce's view of herself. This album makes it clear that her feminism isn't academic; isn't about waves, or labels. It simply is a part of her {{as much as anything else}} in her life. She's pro-woman without being anti-man, and she wants the world to know that you can be feminist on a personal level without sacrificing emotions, friendships or fun." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{chamber of}} a beef stomach is called yang and {{is high in}} protein. It has been {{recommended}} for a person in weak health to drink the broth of yang since ancient times. The outer portion of the intestines is hard and lumpy, with <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> membranes and unclean materials attached between the projections, so those should be thoroughly cleaned out before cooking. Gopchang (small intestines of cattle) is {{commonly referred to as}} such because of its curvy shape rather than as sochang, which literally means [...] "small intestines". It is the counterpart of daechang, meaning [...] "large intestines". Compared to other cuts of meat, gopchang is high in iron and vitamins. It is relatively inexpensive and has a characteristic flavor and a chewy yet palatable texture, so it is used in many Korean dishes such as gui (grilled dishes) or bokkeum (stir-fried dishes).|$|E

The deal was made official on August 14, due to Greene's rookie contract signing on July 14. In response to the trade, Yao Ming was generally positive, but jokingly said that [...] "hopefully he's not fighting anymore and going after a guy in the stands." [...] In response, Artest said, [...] "This is Tracy (McGrady) and Yao's team, you know. I'm {{not going to take it}} personal. I understand what Yao said, but I'm still ghetto. That's not going to change. I'm never going to change my culture.

5000|$|Even {{before the}} first episode was broadcast, Brian Lowry in Variety {{attacked}} the show, saying that the guest comedians were [...] "second-tier" [...] and that the set [...] "resembles a cut-rate version of The Weakest Link set" [...] and that [...] "Comedy Central's programming usually falls squarely into the sublime or the ridiculous, so consider Root of All Evil a rare tweener in terms of quality—one that proves <b>a</b> whole <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>Black</b> is preferable, albeit marginally, to a black hole."

At the time of his induction only Ty Cobb (98.2%), Babe Ruth (95.1%), and Honus Wagner (95.1%) had a higher percentage of ballot votes. In 2010, after Feller had been admitted to hospice, a reporter released a story recalling a 2007 interview with an aged Feller where he brought up Feller and Robinson's occasional dislike for each other.

The difference, they say, is only a difference of degree; everything is evolutionary and relative. Shavedness is immanent in man. Every ten-penny nail is a Potential Razor. The superstitious people of the past (they say) believed that <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> bristles standing out at right angles to one's face was a positive affair.
