5|$|For {{artifacts}} {{such as the}} Sky Disc of Nebra, {{alleged to}} be a Bronze Age artefact depicting the cosmos, the analysis {{would be similar to}} typical post-excavation analysis as used in other sub-disciplines in archaeology. An artefact is examined and <b>attempts</b> <b>are</b> <b>made</b> to draw analogies with historical or ethnographical records of other peoples. The more parallels that can be found, the more likely an explanation is to be accepted by other archaeologists.|$|E

25|$|Consciousness is {{an elusive}} concept that {{presents}} many difficulties when <b>attempts</b> <b>are</b> <b>made</b> to define it. Its study has progressively become an interdisciplinary challenge for numerous researchers, including ethologists, neurologists, cognitive neuroscientists, philosophers, psychologists and psychiatrists.|$|E

25|$|Often, <b>attempts</b> <b>are</b> <b>made</b> {{to salvage}} shipwrecks, {{particularly}} those recently wrecked, {{to recover the}} whole {{or part of the}} ship, its cargo, or its equipment. An example was the salvage of the scuttled German High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow in the 1920s and 1930s. The unauthorized salvage of wrecks is called wrecking.|$|E
25|$|Pedigree {{errors are}} a {{well-known}} {{source of error}} in medical studies. When <b>attempts</b> <b>are</b> <b>made</b> to try to study medical afflictions and their genetic components, it becomes very important to understand nonpaternity rates and pedigree errors. There are numerous software packages and procedures that exist for correcting research data for pedigree errors.|$|E
25|$|Most <b>attempts</b> <b>are</b> <b>made</b> during May, {{before the}} summer monsoon season. As the monsoon season approaches, the jet stream shifts northward, thereby {{reducing}} the average wind speeds high on the mountain. While attempts are sometimes made in September and October, after the monsoons, when the jet stream is again temporarily pushed northward, the additional snow deposited by the monsoons and the less stable weather patterns at the moons' tail end make climbing extremely difficult.|$|E

25|$|Many climbers {{attempt the}} summit of Mount Shasta. The summer {{climbing}} season runs from late April until October, although many <b>attempts</b> <b>are</b> <b>made</b> in the winter. In winter, Sargents Ridge and Casaval Ridge, {{to the east and}} west of Avalanche Gulch, respectively, become the most traveled routes, to avoid avalanche danger. Mount Shasta is also a popular destination for backcountry skiing. Many of the climbing routes can be descended by experienced skiers, and there are numerous lower-angled areas {{around the base of the}} mountain.|$|E
25|$|Kazuto {{is later}} {{recruited}} {{to assist in}} testing an experimental FullDive machine, Soul Translator (STL), which has an interface that is far more realistic and complex than the previous machine he had played to help develop an artificial intelligence for the Ministry of Defense (MOD) named A.L.I.C.E. He tests the STL by entering a virtual reality cyberspace created with The Seed package, named UnderWorld (UW). In the UW, the flow of time proceeds a thousand times faster than in the real world, and Kirito's memories of what happens inside are restricted. However, Black injures Kazuto with suxamethonium chloride.

25|$|The squad {{moves to}} London {{to track down}} Ali Hassan Salameh, who orchestrated the Munich Massacre, but the {{assassination}} attempt is interrupted by several drunken Americans. It is implied that these are agents of the CIA, which, according to Louis, protects and funds Salameh {{in exchange for his}} promise not to attack U.S. diplomats. Meanwhile, <b>attempts</b> <b>are</b> <b>made</b> on the assassins themselves. Carl is killed by an independent Dutch contract killer. In revenge, the team tracks her down and executes her at a houseboat in Hoorn, Netherlands. Hans is found stabbed to death on a park bench, while Robert is killed by an explosion in his workshop. Avner and Steve finally locate Salameh in Spain, but again their assassination attempt is thwarted, this time by Salameh's armed guards. It is implied that Louis has sold information on the team to the PLO.|$|E

25|$|For a while, {{the dinner}} party {{proceeds}} smoothly. Inexperienced {{in the ways}} of the aristocracy, Myshkin is deeply impressed by the elegance and good humour of the company, unsuspicious of its superficiality. It turns out that one of those present—Ivan Petrovich—is a relative of his beloved benefactor Pavlishchev, and the Prince becomes extraordinarily enthusiastic. But when Ivan Petrovich mentions that Pavlishchev ended by giving up everything and going over to the Roman Church, Myshkin is horrified. He launches unexpectedly into a tirade against Catholicism, claiming that it preaches the Antichrist and in its quest for political supremacy has given birth to Atheism. Everyone present is shocked and several <b>attempts</b> <b>are</b> <b>made</b> to stop or divert him, but he only becomes more animated. At the height of his fervor, he begins waving his arms about and knocks over the priceless Chinese vase, smashing it to pieces. There is a lull as Myshkin emerges from his profound astonishment and the general horror turns to amusement and concern for his health; but it is only temporary, and he soon begins another spontaneous discourse, this time {{on the subject of the}} aristocracy in Russia, once again becoming oblivious to all attempts to quell his ardour. The speech is only brought to an end by the onset of an epileptic seizure: Aglaya, deeply distressed, catches him in her arms as he falls. He is taken home, having left a decidedly negative impression on the guests.|$|E
500|$|Injury to {{the spinal}} {{accessory}} nerve commonly occurs during neck surgery, including neck dissection and lymph node excision. It can also {{occur as a}} result of blunt or penetrating trauma, and in some causes spontaneously. Damage at any point along the nerve's course will affect the function of the nerve. The nerve is intentionally removed in [...] "radical" [...] neck dissections, which are attempts at exploring the neck surgically for the presence and extent of cancer. <b>Attempts</b> <b>are</b> <b>made</b> to spare it in other forms of less aggressive dissection.|$|E

500|$|Albatrosses {{are held}} to {{undertake}} these elaborate and painstaking rituals {{to ensure that the}} appropriate partner has been chosen and to perfect partner recognition, as egg laying and chick rearing is a huge investment. Even species that can complete an egg-laying cycle in under a year seldom lay eggs in consecutive years. The great albatrosses (like the wandering albatross) take over a year to raise a chick from laying to fledging. Albatrosses lay a single subelliptical egg, white with reddish brown spots, in a breeding season; if the egg is lost to predators or accidentally broken, then no further breeding <b>attempts</b> <b>are</b> <b>made</b> that year.

500|$|No {{treatment}} {{is known to}} speed the healing of a pulmonary contusion; the main care is supportive. [...] <b>Attempts</b> <b>are</b> <b>made</b> to discover injuries accompanying the contusion, to prevent additional injury, and to provide supportive care {{while waiting for the}} contusion to heal. [...] Monitoring, including keeping track of fluid balance, respiratory function, and oxygen saturation using pulse oximetry is also required as the patient's condition may progressively worsen. Monitoring for complications such as pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome is of critical importance. Treatment aims to prevent respiratory failure and to ensure adequate blood oxygenation. [...] Supplemental oxygen can be given and it may be warmed and humidified. [...] When the contusion does not respond to other treatments, extracorporeal membranous oxygenation may be used, pumping blood from the body into a machine that oxygenates it and removes carbon dioxide prior to pumping it back in.|$|E
500|$|Washington, {{upon his}} return to Williamsburg, was {{commissioned}} a Lieutenant Colonel in the newly created Virginia Regiment, and ordered by Dinwiddie to raise a force {{to assist in the}} completion of Trent's fort.

[...] Washington was ordered to gather up as many supplies and paid volunteers as he could along the way. By the time he left for the frontier on April 2, he had recruited fewer than 160men. [...] Moving quickly and without artillery, his force marched north and west, picking up additional militia companies along the way. On April 19, outside Winchester, Virginia, Washington received word that a large French force was descending the Allegheny. On reaching Wills Creek he met part of Trent's company, who, in addition to confirming the arrival of the French, brought a supportive message from Tanacharison. [...] To keep Tanacharison's support, Washington decided to advance rather than turning back. However, road-building went slowly, {{and by the end of}} May Washington's company had reached a place known as the Great Meadows (now in Fayette County, Pennsylvania), about [...] south of the forks. There he began construction of a small fort and awaited further news or instructions.|$|E
