5|$|Children with AS {{are more}} likely to have sleep problems, {{including}} difficulty in falling asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings, and early morning awakenings. AS is also associated with high levels of <b>alexithymia,</b> which is difficulty in identifying and describing one's emotions. Although AS, lower sleep quality, and <b>alexithymia</b> are associated, their causal relationship is unclear.|$|E
25|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} is also {{implicated in the}} {{development}} <b>alexithymia,</b> and those with traumatic brain injury are six {{times more likely to}} exhibit <b>alexithymia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Molecular genetic {{research}} into <b>alexithymia</b> remains minimal, but promising candidates {{have been identified}} from studies examining connections between certain genes and <b>alexithymia</b> among those with psychiatric conditions {{as well as the}} general population. A study recruiting a test population of Japanese males found higher scores on the Toronto <b>Alexithymia</b> Scale among those with the 5-HTTLPR homozygous long (L) allele. The 5-HTTLPR region on the serotonin transporter gene influences the transcription of the seretonin transporter that removes serotonin from the synaptic cleft, and is well studied for its association with numerous psychiatric disorders. Another study examining the 5-HT1A receptor, a receptor that binds serotonin, found higher levels of <b>alexithymia</b> among those with the G allele of the Rs6295 polymorphism within the HTR1A gene. Also, a study examining <b>alexithymia</b> in subjects with obsessive-compulsive disorder found higher <b>alexithymia</b> levels associated with the Val/Val allele of the Rs4680 polymorphism in the gene that encodes Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme which degrades catecholamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine. These links are tentative, and further research will be needed to clarify how these genes relate to the neurological anomalies found in the brains of people with <b>alexithymia.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Alexithymia</b> is {{correlated}} with certain personality disorders, substance use disorders, some anxiety disorders, and sexual disorders, {{as well as}} certain physical illnesses, such as hypertension, inflammatory bowel disease, and functional dyspepsia. <b>Alexithymia</b> is further linked with disorders such as migraine headaches, lower back pain, irritable bowel syndrome, asthma, nausea, allergies, and fibromyalgia.|$|E
25|$|In a 2008 study <b>alexithymia</b> {{was found}} to be {{correlated}} with impaired understanding and demonstration of relational affection, and that this impairment contributes to poorer mental health, poorer relational well-being, and lowered relationship quality. Individuals high on the <b>alexithymia</b> spectrum also report less distress at seeing others in pain and behave less altruistically toward others.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} what causes <b>alexithymia,</b> though several {{theories}} have been proposed.|$|E
25|$|Early {{studies showed}} {{evidence}} {{that there may be}} an interhemispheric transfer deficit among people with alexithymia; that is, the emotional information from the right hemisphere of the brain is not being properly transferred to the language regions in the left hemisphere, as can be caused by a decreased corpus callosum, often present in psychiatric patients who have suffered severe childhood abuse. A neuropsychological study in 1997 indicated that <b>alexithymia</b> may be due to a disturbance to the right hemisphere of the brain, which is largely responsible for processing emotions. In addition, another neuropsychological model suggests that <b>alexithymia</b> may be related to a dysfunction of the anterior cingulate cortex. These studies have some shortcomings, however, and the empirical evidence about the neural mechanisms behind <b>alexithymia</b> remains inconclusive.|$|E
25|$|An {{inability}} to modulate emotions {{is a possibility}} in explaining why some people with <b>alexithymia</b> are prone to discharge tension arising from unpleasant emotional states through impulsive acts or compulsive behaviors such as binge eating, substance abuse, perverse sexual behavior, or anorexia nervosa. The failure to regulate emotions cognitively might result in prolonged elevations of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and neuroendocrine systems {{which can lead to}} somatic diseases. People with <b>alexithymia</b> also show a limited ability to experience positive emotions leading Krystal (1988) and Sifneos (1987) to describe many of these individuals as anhedonic.|$|E
25|$|Chaotic {{interpersonal}} relations {{have also been}} observed by Sifneos. Due to the inherent difficulties identifying and describing emotional states in self and others, <b>alexithymia</b> also negatively affects relationship satisfaction between couples.|$|E
25|$|Typical {{deficiencies}} {{may include}} problems identifying, processing, describing, {{and working with}} one's own feelings, often marked {{by a lack of}} understanding of the feelings of others; difficulty distinguishing between feelings and the bodily sensations of emotional arousal; confusion of physical sensations often associated with emotions; few dreams or fantasies due to restricted imagination; and concrete, realistic, logical thinking, often to the exclusion of emotional responses to problems. Those who have <b>alexithymia</b> also report very logical and realistic dreams, such as going to the store or eating a meal. Clinical experience suggests it is the structural features of dreams more than the ability to recall them that best characterizes <b>alexithymia.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{study of}} college {{students}} (n = 80) by Goldsmith and Freyd report that many who have experienced emotional abuse do not characterise the mistreatment as abusive. Additionally, Goldsmith and Freyd show that these people also tend to exhibit higher than average rates of <b>alexithymia</b> (difficulty identifying and processing their own emotions).|$|E
25|$|Some {{people with}} schizoid {{personality}} features may occasionally experience instances of brief reactive psychosis when under stress. The personality disorders that most frequently co-occur with SPD are schizotypal, paranoid and avoidant PD. The relationship between <b>alexithymia</b> (the inability {{to identify and}} describe emotions) and SPD seems to be strong {{but they are not}} the same condition.|$|E
25|$|According to Henry Krystal, {{individuals}} {{suffering from}} <b>alexithymia</b> think in an operative way and {{may appear to}} be superadjusted to reality. In psychotherapy, however, a cognitive disturbance becomes apparent as patients tend to recount trivial, chronologically ordered actions, reactions, and events of daily life with monotonous detail. In general, these individuals lack imagination, intuition, empathy, and drive-fulfillment fantasy, especially in relation to objects. Instead, they seem oriented toward things and even treat themselves as robots. These problems seriously limit their responsiveness to psychoanalytic psychotherapy; psychosomatic illness or substance abuse is frequently exacerbated should these individuals enter psychotherapy.|$|E
25|$|The {{researchers}} also found TEIQue scores were unrelated to nonverbal reasoning (Raven's matrices), which they interpreted as {{support for the}} personality trait view of EI (as opposed {{to a form of}} intelligence). As expected, TEIQue scores were positively related to some of the Big Five personality traits (extraversion, agreeableness, openness, conscientiousness) as well as inversely related to others (<b>alexithymia,</b> neuroticism). A number of quantitative genetic studies have been carried out within the trait EI model, which have revealed significant genetic effects and heritabilities for all trait EI scores. Two recent studies (one a meta-analysis) involving direct comparisons of multiple EI tests yielded very favorable results for the TEIQue.|$|E
25|$|Anorexia has classically been {{associated}} with disturbances to interoception with people hyper-focused on their bodies. People with anorexia concentrate on distorted perceptions of their body exterior in fear of weight gain, and they also report altered physical states within their bodies, such as indistinct feelings of fullness or {{are not able to}} distinguish emotional states from bodily sensations in general (also called <b>alexithymia).</b> Further, people with anorexia experience abnormally intense cardiorespiratory sensations, particularly of the breath, and this is most prevalent before they consume a meal. Abnormal senses of interoceptive awareness such as these have been observed so frequently in anorexia that they have become key characteristics of the illness.|$|E
500|$|A {{person with}} a {{moderate}} or severe TBI may have a headache that does not go away, repeated vomiting or nausea, convulsions, an inability to awaken, dilation of one or both pupils, slurred speech, aphasia (word-finding difficulties), dysarthria (muscle weakness that causes disordered speech), weakness or numbness in the limbs, loss of coordination, confusion, restlessness, or agitation. [...] Common long-term symptoms of moderate to severe TBI are changes in appropriate social behavior, deficits in social judgment, and cognitive changes, especially problems with sustained attention, processing speed, and executive functioning. <b>Alexithymia,</b> a deficiency in identifying, understanding, processing, and describing emotions occurs in 60.9% of individuals with TBI. Cognitive and social deficits have long-term consequences for {{the daily lives of}} people with moderate to severe TBI, but can be improved with appropriate rehabilitation.|$|E
500|$|There is {{significant}} {{debate over whether}} or not asexuality is a sexual orientation. It has been compared and equated with hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), in that both imply a general lack of sexual attraction to anyone; HSDD has been used to medicalize asexuality, but asexuality is generally not considered a disorder or a sexual dysfunction (such as anorgasmia, anhedonia, etc.), because it does not necessarily define someone as having a medical problem or problems relating to others socially. Unlike people with HSDD, asexual people normally do not experience [...] "marked distress" [...] and [...] "interpersonal difficulty" [...] concerning feelings about their sexuality, or generally a lack of sexual arousal; asexuality is considered the lack or absence of sexual attraction as a life-enduring characteristic. One study found that, compared to HSDD subjects, asexuals reported lower levels of sexual desire, sexual experience, sex-related distress and depressive symptoms. Researchers Richards and Barker report that asexuals do not have disproportionate rates of <b>alexithymia,</b> depression, or personality disorders. Some people, however, may identify as asexual even if their non-sexual state is explained by {{one or more of the}} aforementioned disorders.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Alexithymia</b> is {{considered}} to be a personality trait that places affected individuals at risk for other medical and psychiatric disorders while reducing the likelihood that these individuals will respond to conventional treatments for the other conditions. [...] <b>Alexithymia</b> is not classified as a mental disorder in the [...] fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. It is a dimensional personality trait that varies in severity from person to person. A person's <b>alexithymia</b> score can be measured with questionnaires such as the Toronto <b>Alexithymia</b> Scale (TAS-20), the Bermond-Vorst <b>Alexithymia</b> Questionnaire (BVAQ), the Online <b>Alexithymia</b> Questionnaire (OAQ-G2) or the Observer <b>Alexithymia</b> Scale (OAS). [...] It is distinct from the psychiatric personality disorders, such as antisocial personality disorder or borderline personality disorder, with which it shares some characteristics, and is likewise distinct from the abnormal conditions of sociopathy or psychopathy.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Alexithymia</b> [...] is a {{personality}} construct {{characterized by the}} [...] inability to identify and describe emotions in the self. The core characteristics of <b>alexithymia</b> are marked dysfunction in emotional awareness, social attachment, and interpersonal relating. Furthermore, people with <b>alexithymia</b> have difficulty in distinguishing and appreciating the emotions of others, which is thought to lead to unempathic and ineffective emotional responding. <b>Alexithymia</b> occurs in approximately 10% {{of the population and}} can occur with a number of psychiatric conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Bagby and Taylor {{also suggest}} {{that there may be}} two kinds of <b>alexithymia,</b> [...] "primary alexithymia" [...] which is an {{enduring}} psychological trait that does not alter over time, and [...] "secondary alexithymia" [...] which is state-dependent and disappears after the evoking stressful situation has changed. These two manifestations of <b>alexithymia</b> are otherwise called [...] "trait" [...] or [...] "state" [...] <b>alexithymia.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In {{studies of}} the general {{population}} the degree of <b>alexithymia</b> was found to be influenced by age, but not by gender; the rates of <b>alexithymia</b> in healthy controls have been found at: 8.3%; 4.7%; 8.9%; and 7%. Thus, several studies have reported that the prevalence rate of <b>alexithymia</b> is less than 10%. A less common finding suggests {{that there may be a}} higher prevalence of <b>alexithymia</b> amongst males than females, which may be accounted for by difficulties some males have with [...] "describing feelings", but not by difficulties in [...] "identifying feelings" [...] in which males and females show similar abilities.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} more {{psychiatric}} disorders that overlap with <b>alexithymia.</b> One study found that 41% [...] of Vietnam War veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were alexithymic. Another study found higher levels of <b>alexithymia</b> among Holocaust survivors with PTSD compared to those without. [...] Higher levels of <b>alexithymia</b> among mothers with interpersonal violence-related PTSD were found in one study to have proportionally less caregiving sensitivity. This latter study suggested that when treating adult PTSD patients who are parents, <b>alexithymia</b> should be assessed and addressed also with attention to the parent-child relationship and the child's social-emotional development.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Alexithymia</b> {{frequently}} co-occurs {{with other}} disorders. Research indicates that <b>alexithymia</b> overlaps with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In a 2004 study using the TAS-20, [...] 85% {{of the adults}} with ASD fell into the impaired category; {{almost half of the}} whole group fell into the severely impaired category. Among the adult control, only 17% was impaired; none of them severely. [...] Fitzgerald & Bellgrove pointed out that, [...] "Like <b>alexithymia,</b> Asperger's syndrome is also characterised by core disturbances in speech and language and social relationships". Hill & Berthoz agreed with Fitzgerald & Bellgrove (2006) and in response stated that [...] "there is some form of overlap between <b>alexithymia</b> and ASDs". They also pointed to studies that revealed impaired theory of mind skill in <b>alexithymia,</b> neuroanatomical evidence pointing to a shared etiology and similar social skills deficits. The exact nature of the overlap is uncertain. Alexithymic traits in AS may be linked to clinical depression or anxiety; the mediating factors are unknown and it is possible that <b>alexithymia</b> predisposes to anxiety.|$|E
2500|$|Psychologist R. Michael Bagby and {{psychiatrist}} Graeme J. Taylor {{have argued}} that the <b>alexithymia</b> construct is strongly related (negatively) to the concepts of psychological mindedness and emotional intelligence and there is [...] "strong empirical support for <b>alexithymia</b> being a stable personality trait rather than just a consequence of psychological distress". Other opinions differ and can show evidence that it may be state-dependent.|$|E
2500|$|A common {{misconception}} about <b>alexithymia</b> is {{that affected}} individuals are totally unable to express emotions verbally {{and that they}} may even fail to acknowledge that they experience emotions. Even before coining the term, Sifneos (1967) noted patients often mentioned things like anxiety or depression. The distinguishing factor was their inability to elaborate beyond a few limited adjectives such as [...] "happy" [...] or [...] "unhappy" [...] when describing these feelings. The core issue is that people with <b>alexithymia</b> have poorly differentiated emotions limiting their ability to distinguish and describe them to others. This contributes {{to the sense of}} emotional detachment from themselves and difficulty connecting with others, making <b>alexithymia</b> negatively associated with life satisfaction even when depression and other confounding factors are controlled for.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{there is}} {{evidence}} {{for the role of}} environmental and neurological factors, the role and influence of genetic factors for developing <b>alexithymia</b> is still unclear. A single large scale Danish study suggested that genetic factors contributed noticeably to the development of <b>alexithymia.</b> However, such twin studies are controversial, as they suffer from the [...] "equal environments assumption" [...] and the [...] "heritability" [...] estimates in no way correspond to actual DNA structures.|$|E
2500|$|Cysts on {{the left}} {{temporal}} lobe {{have been associated with}} psychosis. [...] However this remains controversial and subjective to the individual clinician. [...] A left fronto-temporal cyst more specifically showed symptoms of <b>alexithymia.</b>|$|E
2500|$|An {{internal}} sense {{also known}} as interoception is [...] "any sense that is normally stimulated from within the body". [...] These involve numerous sensory receptors in internal organs, such as stretch receptors that are neurologically linked to the brain. Interoception {{is thought to be}} atypical in clinical conditions such as <b>alexithymia.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The term <b>alexithymia</b> {{was coined}} by {{psychotherapist}} Peter Sifneos in 1973. The word comes from Greek α (a, [...] "no", the negating alpha privative), λέξις (léxis, [...] "word"), and θυμός (thymos, [...] "emotions", but understood by Sifneos {{as having the}} meaning [...] "mood"), literally meaning [...] "no words for mood".|$|E
2500|$|<b>Alexithymia</b> creates {{interpersonal}} {{problems because}} these individuals tend to avoid emotionally close relationships, {{or if they}} do form relationships with others they usually position themselves as either dependent, dominant, or impersonal, [...] "such that the relationship remains superficial". Inadequate [...] "differentiation" [...] between self and others by alexithymic individuals has also been observed.|$|E
2500|$|Single study {{prevalence}} {{findings for}} other disorders include 63% in anorexia nervosa, 56% in bulimia, 45% to 50% in major depressive disorder, 34% in panic disorder, [...] 28% of social phobics, and 50% in substance abusers. <b>Alexithymia</b> is also exhibited {{by a large}} proportion of individuals with acquired brain injuries such as stroke or traumatic brain injury.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Alexithymia</b> {{influences}} treatment outcome. Recovery is also viewed on {{a spectrum}} rather than black and white. According to the Morgan-Russell criteria, individuals {{can have a}} good, intermediate, or poor outcome. Even {{when a person is}} classified as having a [...] "good" [...] outcome, weight only has to be within 15% of average, and normal menstruation must be present in females. The good outcome also excludes psychological health. Recovery for people with anorexia nervosa is undeniably positive, but recovery does not mean a return to normal.|$|E
2500|$|French {{psychoanalyst}} Joyce McDougall {{objected to}} the strong focus by clinicians on neurophysiological {{at the expense of}} psychological explanations for the genesis and operation of <b>alexithymia,</b> and introduced the alternative term [...] "disaffectation" [...] to stand for psychogenic <b>alexithymia.</b> For McDougall, the disaffected individual had at some point [...] "experienced overwhelming emotion that threatened to attack their sense of integrity and identity", to which they applied psychological defenses to pulverize and eject all emotional representations from consciousness. [...] A similar line of interpretation has been taken up using the methods of phenomenology. McDougall has also noted that all infants are born unable to identify, organize, and speak about their emotional experiences (the word infans is from the Latin [...] "not speaking"), and are [...] "by reason of their immaturity inevitably alexithymic". Based on this fact McDougall proposed in 1985 that the alexithymic part of an adult personality could be [...] "an extremely arrested and infantile psychic structure". The first language of an infant is nonverbal facial expressions. The parent's emotional state is important for determining how any child might develop. Neglect or indifference to varying changes in a child's facial expressions without proper feedback can promote an invalidation of the facial expressions manifested by the child. The parent's ability to reflect self-awareness to the child is another important factor. If the adult is incapable of recognizing and distinguishing emotional expressions in the child, it can influence the child's capacity to understand emotional expressions.|$|E
