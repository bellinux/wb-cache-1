[...] "We {{went to his}} quarters and discovered a radio, which was still warm. That was the last we saw of him. He was arrested." [...] The Japanese air raids were assisted by radio transmissions made by Heenan. Among other espionage equipment, he reportedly had a morse code transmitter operated by an <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>keyboard</b> — similar to a Traeger Transceiver — which was disguised as a typewriter. Heenan was sent to Singapore, and was reportedly court-martialled in January 1942. He {{does not seem to}} have been formally sentenced, but the normal sentence for treason by British officers was death.|$|E
2500|$|The English <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>keyboard</b> has a {{dedicated}} key {{for each of}} the letters A–Z, along with keys for punctuation and other symbols. In many other languages there are additional letters (often with diacritics) or symbols, which also need to be available on the keyboard. To make room for additional symbols, keyboards often have what is effectively a secondary shift key, labeled [...] (which typically takes the place of the right-hand [...] key). It can be used to type an extra symbol in addition to the two otherwise available with an alphanumeric key, and using it simultaneously with the [...] key may even give access to a fourth symbol. On the visual layout, these third-level and fourth-level symbols may appear on the right half of the key top, or they may be unmarked.|$|E

50|$|Computer {{keyboards}} can {{be classified}} by the switch technology that they use. Computer <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>keyboards</b> typically have 80 to 110 durable switches, generally one for each key. The choice of switch technology affects key response (the positive feedback that a key has been pressed) and pre travel (the distance needed to push the key to enter a character reliably). Newer keyboard models use hybrids of various technologies to achieve greater cost savings.|$|R

5000|$|A keypad {{is a set}} {{of buttons}} {{arranged}} in a block or [...] "pad" [...] which bear digits, symbols or alphabetical letters. Pads mostly containing numbers are called a numeric keypad. Numeric keypads are found on <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>keyboards</b> and on other devices which require mainly numeric input such as calculators, push-button telephones, vending machines, ATMs, Point of Sale devices, combination locks, and digital door locks. Many devices follow the E.161 standard for their arrangement.|$|R
40|$|Of {{the four}} major types of {{interactive}} videotex systems currently being tested (Telidon, Teletel, Captains and Prestel-like) only one (Teletel) permits the use of alphabetic keywords for searching. It is contended that alphabetic keyword searching should be incorporated into future videotex systems. Methods of alphabetic keyword searching {{in the absence of}} <b>alphanumeric</b> <b>keyboards</b> are then discussed. A novel technique which has recently been implemented on Prestel-like systems is proposed as an interim solution until genuine alphabetic searching becomes available...|$|R
