The ratio of Ba and Sr lines is also useful at the same indices and for carbon-rich stars with <b>abundance</b> <b>index</b> 7 to 9.

40|$|In {{northern}} latitudes, {{species that}} {{have adapted to}} snow cover by molting and changing pelage color will be particularly vulnerable to climate change, as predation levels may increase due to a mismatch with background coloration. Here, we investigated the synergistic effect of mammalian generalist predators (red fox Vulpes vulpes and pine marten Martes martes) and the duration of snow cover on the abundance of a winter-adapted species, the mountain hare (Lepus timidus). We analyzed 12 yr of data from 622 snow tracking lines in southeast Norway along a gradient in annual duration of snow-covered ground. The mountain hare <b>abundance</b> <b>index</b> {{was positively related to}} the generalist predator <b>abundance</b> <b>index,</b> probably due to a combined numerical and functional response of the predators. The mountain hare <b>abundance</b> <b>index</b> was negatively associated with a short duration of snow cover, and this effect was stronger in areas with a high predator <b>abundance</b> <b>index.</b> Hence, we demonstrated a causal link between the mountain hare <b>abundance</b> <b>index,</b> predators, and the duration of snow cover. We expect declining mountain hare densities in the future caused by interactive effects of reduced duration of snow-covered ground, potentially increasing generalist predator densities and the limited ability of mountain hares to adapt to the climate change-induced molting mismatc...|$|E

40|$|Weather {{has often}} been {{associated}} with fluctuations in population sizes of species; however, {{it can be difficult}} to estimate the effects satisfactorily because population size is naturally measured by annual <b>abundance</b> <b>indices</b> whilst weather varies on much shorter timescales. We describe a novel method for estimating the effects of a temporal sequence of a weather variable (such as mean temperatures from successive months) on annual species <b>abundance</b> <b>indices.</b> The model we use has a separate regression coefficient for each covariate in the temporal sequence, and over-fitting is avoided by constraining the regression coefficients to lie on a curve defined by a small number of parameters. The constrained curve is the product of a periodic function, reflecting assumptions that associations with weather will vary smoothly throughout the year and tend to be repetitive across years, and an exponentially decaying term, reflecting an assumption that the weather from the most recent year will tend to have the greatest effect on the current population and that the effect of weather in previous years tends to diminish as the time lag increases. We have used this approach to model 501 species <b>abundance</b> <b>indices</b> from Great Britain and present detailed results for two contrasting species alongside an overall impression of the results across all species. We believe this approach provides an important advance to the challenge of robustly modelling relationships between weather and species population size...|$|R
40|$|To {{confirm the}} {{consistency}} of the age interpretation by validation studies is essential for providing accurate age estimates to the stock assessment process using age-structured models. The Atlantic Iberian megrim (Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis) stock is annually assessed by age-structured models in ICES, and specimens are routinely aged by IEO expert readers for this purpose. A total of 8845 otoliths of this stock were aged from 23 annual groundfish surveys carried out in north and northwestern Iberian waters (ICES Div. VIIIc, IXa) and following internationally standardized protocols. Yearly age-length-keys were built using the respective age estimates and applied to the length distribution of each survey, thus obtaining a matrix of <b>abundance</b> <b>indices</b> by age and year. Similar mean lengths are obtained for each age group along the time series. The annual age estimation of L. whiffiagonis is here indirectly validated by tracking cohort <b>abundance</b> <b>indices</b> in the surveys. Strong and weak cohorts are well tracked along the most of their age classes, and the correlations between age <b>abundance</b> <b>indices</b> are statistically significant up to the age 5, which represent around 94 % {{of the total number of}} this species caught in the surveys.

40|$|Effective {{monitoring}} of biodiversity for conservation requires information on {{spatial and temporal}} variation in species' abundances. As conservation resources are limited, monitoring methods are required that enable rapid and cost effective data collection. There are many traditional methods of estimating absolute abundance, such as territory mapping and distance sampling. However, these typically require more time, expertise and finances than are available {{across much of the}} globe. This is especially so in the tropics, where high species richness, low densities of many species and structurally complex environments also make monitoring particularly challenging. The MacKinnon lists technique is a rapid assessment methodology designed for use in species rich environments. This method is typically used to estimate species richness, but it has also been suggested that it can generate consistent <b>abundance</b> <b>indices,</b> even when observer experience and environmental conditions vary. If this suggestion is correct, the MacKinnon lists method could be used to assess spatial or temporal changes in abundance using diverse survey data. Here, we provide the first detailed assessment of intra- and inter-observer consistency of the Mackinnon List method in generating species <b>abundance</b> <b>indices</b> that could be useful for conservation monitoring purposes. As a case study, we use one of the world's most diverse avifaunas, that of the forested Bolivian Andes. We show that MacKinnon lists can provide species <b>abundance</b> <b>indices</b> that are consistent between observers of markedly different experience of the focal avifauna (zero to six years), and between assessments carried out in different stages of the breeding season, between which detectability of individuals differed significantly. We believe {{this is the first time}} that a biodiversity monitoring method has been demonstrated to produce consistent <b>abundance</b> <b>indices</b> for a highly diverse avian tropical assemblage. We also suggest that the MacKinnon lists methodology has the potential to be a very useful conservation monitoring tool for many taxa in species rich environments, such as the tropics.

40|$|International audienceThe rapid {{expansion}} of systematic monitoring schemes necessitates robust methods to reliably assess species' status and trends. Insect monitoring poses a challenge where there are strong seasonal patterns, requiring repeated counts to reliably assess abundance. Butterfly monitoring schemes (BMSs) operate in {{an increasing number of}} countries with broadly the same methodology, yet they differ in their observation frequency and in the methods used to compute annual <b>abundance</b> <b>indices.</b> Using simulated and observed data, we performed an extensive comparison of two approaches used to derive <b>abundance</b> <b>indices</b> from count data collected via BMS, under a range of sampling frequencies. Linear interpolation is most commonly used to estimate <b>abundance</b> <b>indices</b> from seasonal count series. A second method, hereafter the regional generalized additive model (GAM), fits a GAM to repeated counts within sites across a climatic region. For the two methods, we estimated bias in <b>abundance</b> <b>indices</b> and the statistical power for detecting trends, given different proportions of missing counts. We also compared the accuracy of trend estimates using systematically degraded observed counts of the Gatekeeper Pyronia tithonus (Linnaeus 1767). The regional GAM method generally outperforms the linear interpolation method. When the proportion of missing counts increased beyond 50 %, indices derived via the linear interpolation method showed substantially higher estimation error as well as clear biases, in comparison to the regional GAM method. The regional GAM method also showed higher power to detect trends when the proportion of missing counts was substantial. Synthesis and applications. Monitoring offers invaluable data to support conservation policy and management, but requires robust analysis approaches and guidance for new and expanding schemes. Based on our findings, we recommend the regional generalized additive model approach when conducting integrative analyses across schemes, or when analysing scheme data with reduced sampling efforts. This method enables existing schemes to be expanded or new schemes to be developed with reduced within-year sampling frequency, as well as affording options to adapt protocols to more efficiently assess species status and trends across large geographical scales...|$|R

40|$|Generalized linear {{modeling}} (GLM) is used {{to analyze}} hake catch rates in the Spanish trawl fleet fishing off Castellón (E Iberian Peninsula) between 1991 and 1996 and to provide consistent <b>indices</b> of <b>abundance.</b> Main effects in the models include a factor for vessel tonnage, to adjust for characteristics that determine fishing power, as well as factors for year, month and fishing closure. Vessel tonnage, season and year are shown {{to have a significant}} effect on hake catch rates, with vessel capacity alone explaining about 54 % of the total variation in the data. Significant interactions indicate that monthly fluctuations in catch rates differed by year probably in relation to the timing of hake recruitment and of the bimonthly annual closure of the fishery. Hake <b>abundance</b> <b>indices,</b> as derived from the year coefficients in the model, were intermediate in 1991 and 1992, low in 1994 and 1995 and high in 1993 and 1996.

Annual Norway pout <b>abundance</b> <b>indices</b> were adjusted for diel changes in catchability, and an evident increase in Norway pout abundance was found during the study period, although a marked decrease {{the last two years}} was also evident.
