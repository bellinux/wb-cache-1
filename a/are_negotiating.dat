25|$|In {{the wake}} of the 2006 summit, {{economist}} C. Fred Bergsten advocated a Free Trade Agreement of Asia-Pacific, including the United States amongst the proposed parties to any agreement at that time. His ideas convinced the APEC Business Advisory Council to support this concept. Relatedly, ASEAN and existing free trade agreement (FTA) partners <b>are</b> <b>negotiating</b> as Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), not officially including Russia. The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) without China or Russia involved has become the US-promoted trade negotiation in the region. At the APEC summit in Beijing in 2014, the three plans were all in discussion. President Obama hosted a TPP meeting at the US Embassy in Beijing in advance of the APEC gathering.|$|E
25|$|On 15 August 2011, Virgin Media {{agreed to}} sell its 50% stake in UKTV to Scripps Networks Interactive in a deal worth £339m. Scripps paid £239m in cash, and about £100m to acquire the {{outstanding}} preferred stock and debt owed by UKTV to Virgin Media. Completion of the transaction was contingent on regulatory approvals in Ireland and Jersey, which was received on 3 October 2011. Related to the transaction, Scripps Networks Interactive and BBC Worldwide <b>are</b> <b>negotiating</b> an agreement whereby, after completion, BBC Worldwide would have the option, via a combination of cash and a package of digital rights for UKTV, to increase its shareholding from 50% {{to a maximum of}} 60%. Scripps Networks Interactive's existing voting rights and board representation would be unaffected by this proposed arrangement, which would be subject to BBC Executive and BBC Trust approvals.|$|E
40|$|Effective {{conversation}} {{occurs when}} beliefs <b>are</b> <b>negotiated</b> through interaction and evolve in {{a framework of}} goals. Concurrently, goals <b>are</b> <b>negotiated</b> and evolve through interaction. Such conversations are processes of design. Similarly, design—where proposed constructions <b>are</b> <b>negotiated</b> and evolve toward goals, while goals for the design <b>are</b> <b>negotiated</b> and evolve—is a process of conversation. Outcomes from such activities are greatly facilitated, in my view, from an understanding of Pask’s two main frameworks from conversation theory: a structure for the architecture of conversations and a schema for modeling the evolution of conversations. My conviction is that these {{can be used to}} mirror how design happens. This begs the question, can it help designers design? Yes, I believe it can. This paper offers a review of Pask’s frameworks and discusses their application in theory and practice...|$|R

Muhammad, who is visually obscured throughout the entire episode by a black box superimposed with the word [...] "CENSORED", is taken by Stan, Kyle, and Kenny to Dr. Mephisto's lab. The Gingers arrive and take Muhammad and Cartman captive. The Super Best Friends are called to South Park to help; after their powers fail to subdue Mecha-Streisand, they pacify her by having Krishna adopt the form of Neil Diamond and providing her the opportunity to perform a duet with him.|$|E

500|$|In 2001, the top {{clubs and}} the RFU formed [...] "England Rugby" [...] to help govern {{the club and}} {{international}} game. The parties agreed to restrict the number of matches at club and international level that elite players (a group of 50 or 60 players selected by the RFU) could play {{in order to reduce}} player burnout and injuries. In return for releasing players from club commitments, the clubs were to receive compensation from the RFU. This agreement was considered central to the England victory in the 2003 World Cup. Clive Woodward, England coach from November 1997, resigned in 2004 because he was unable to get the access to the players that he wanted; [...] "I wanted more from the unionmore training days with the players, more influence over the way they were treatedand ended up with less." [...] Andy Robinson, Woodward's successor, blamed the lack of control over players for his team's unsuccessful record. Brian Ashton, who took over from Robinson, intentionally named his playing squad for Six Nations matches in 2007 early in the hope that their clubs would not play them in the weekend prior to a Test. The RFU and the Premiership clubs <b>are</b> <b>negotiating</b> a similar deal to the one in 2001 that will enable international players to be released into the England squad prior to international matches.|$|E

2500|$|Many of the {{strategies}} in negotiation vary across genders, and this leads to variations in outcomes for different genders, often with women experiencing less success in negotiations as a consequence. [...] This {{is due to a}} number of factors, including that {{it has been shown that}} it is more difficult for women to be self-advocating when they <b>are</b> <b>negotiating.</b> [...] Many of the implications of these findings have strong financial impacts in addition to the social backlash faced by self-advocating women in negotiations, as compared to other advocating women, self-advocating men, and other advocating men. [...] Research in this area has been studied across platforms, in addition to more specific areas like women as physician assistants. [...] The backlash associated with this type of behavior is attributed to the fact that to be self-advocated is considered masculine, whereas the alternative, being accommodating, is considered more feminine. [...] Males, however, do not appear to face any type of backlash for not being self-advocating.|$|E
2500|$|Upon leaving Mitchell-Lama, {{the owners}} of rental {{buildings}} built since 1974 can raise rents without restriction. Tenants whose buildings had federally-subsidized [...] "236" [...] mortgages may qualify for federal [...] "enhanced" [...] vouchers, which allows them to pay at least what they were paying and no less than 30% of their income in rent, with a government paying the balance. [...] Tenants who do not qualify for enhanced vouchers, including all tenants in post-1973 buildings that were not federally subsidized, must pay the rent set by the landlords. That the buildings {{are no longer in}} a rent-regulation program poses a particular problem for tenants who were receiving special subsidies that may not cover the new, higher rent payments, such as subsidy programs because of proverty age, and disability. In some of the buildings, tenant associations <b>are</b> <b>negotiating</b> [...] "landlord assistance plans" [...] (LAPs) to implement the increases at a slower rate and to protect some of the weakest tenants. The plans are often limited to a specific number of years, and upon their expiration, tenants may be vulnerable. LAPs do not preserve the stock of affordable housing for future tenants.|$|E
