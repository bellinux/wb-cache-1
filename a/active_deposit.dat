40|$|To {{measure the}} {{velocity}} of blood flow in infants and young children, a completely objective proce-dure is required. Most of the methods (as for example determining the time elapsed between the injection of a sweet substance (saccharin) or a bitter substance (sodium dehydrocholate) and the arrival on the tongue of its characteristic taste) used for adults need {{the cooperation of the}} subject. The respiratory stimulation caused by potas-sium cyanide, injected intravenously, was utilized as an objective method by Robb and Weiss (1). We have not tried to apply this method to infants because of the danger in adjusting small doses to small patients. The lethal dose is said to be only about ten times the stimulating dose. Further-more, the end point would be difficult to evaluate since the infant's respirations would almost cer-tainly be irregular and disturbed by crying and emotional excitement. A satisfactory method for infants calls for a test material which can be accurately and objectively measured in small amounts and which, in the doses, used, is completely harmless. Radioactive sodium appeared to satisfy these requirements. The principle of using a radioactive substance was developed by Blumgart and Weiss (2), who injected the <b>active</b> <b>deposit</b> of radon into the ante-cubital vein of one arm, detecting its arrival in the other arm by a properly shielded cloud chamber. The <b>active</b> <b>deposit</b> consists of radium B and its products in equilibrium. It decays with a half-life of 26 minutes. The dose which they used, usually about 5 millicuries, was so small as to present no immediate danger. However, the residue is ra-dium D, a radioactive isotope of lead, with the very long half-life of 22 years. Although the activity of radium D, resulting from the disinte-gration of 5 millicuries of <b>active</b> <b>deposit</b> is ver...|$|E

Passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) {{is a model}} of membranous nephropathy in rats in which glomerular injury is mediated by the terminal C 5 b- 9 membrane attack complex of complement. This model {{has been shown to be}} associated with markedly elevated urinary excretion of C 5 b- 9, compared to other experimental models of glomerulonephritis. To determine if urinary C 5 b- 9 excretion could serve as an index of disease activity by correlating with the formation and quantity of glomerular subepithelial immune deposits in PHN, we measured urinary excretion of C 5 b- 9 in PHN under several experimental conditions. In the heterologous phase a direct correlation was demonstrated between levels of urinary C 5 b- 9 excretion and the amount of anti-FxlA IgG deposited in glomeruli (r = 0. 85). In the autologous phase, C 5 b- 9 excretion correlated with the amount of deposit forming antibody present in the serum and resolved when antibody disappeared, despite persistence of glomerular deposits of antigen, antibody, C 5 b- 9 and heavy proteinuria. Glomerular C 3 deposits paralleled urinary C 5 b- 9 excretion. Re-initiation of <b>active</b> <b>deposit</b> formation by a second injection of anti-FxlA produced new C 3 deposits and a marked rise in C 5 b- 9 excretion. Finally, complete abrogation of deposit formation by transplanting PHN kidneys into normal recipients also halted C 5 b- 9 excretion.

50|$|Graded bedding is a sorting of {{particles}} according to clast {{size and shape}} on a lithified horizontal plane. The term is an explanation as to how a geologic profile was formed. Stratification on a lateral plane is the physical result of <b>active</b> <b>depositing</b> of different size materials. Density and gravity forces in the downward movement of these materials in a confined system {{will result in a}} separating of the detritus settling with respect to size. This will result in less dense, higher porosity clasts at the top and denser, less porous clasts consolidated on the bottom, in what is called normal grading. Inversely graded beds are composed of large clasts on the top, with smaller clasts on the bottom. Grades of the bedding material are determined by precipitation of solid components compared to the viscosity of the medium in which the particles will precipitate from. Stenoâs Principle of Original Horizontality explains that rock layers form in horizontal layers over an underdetermined time scale and depth. Nicholas Steno first published his hypothesis in 1669 after recognizing that fossils were preserved in layers of rock (strata).|$|R

The complement system plays {{an important part in}} the innate immunity against microorganisms through its bactericidal, opsonic, and phlogistic functions. The amount of the complement in the milk of healthy glands of dairy cows is low. Moreover, the classical pathway of activation is not functional because of a shortage in C 1 q. By contrast, the alternative pathway is <b>active,</b> <b>deposits</b> C 3 b and C 3 bi on bacteria, and generates amounts of C 5 a which are highly variable among cows. A slight inhibition of the bactericidal/hemolytic activities, of the deposition of C 1 q on bacteria, and of the phlogistic activity of C 5 a makes milk a rather anti-inflammatory fluid. The inhibitory activity does not involve C 3 b/ C 3 bi deposition on bacteria, nor the generation of C 5 a by the alternative pathway. When inflammation develops, the blood-derived complement components overcome the inhibitions and complement-dependent bactericidal, opsonic and phlogistic activities may be high in milk. Further research is necessary to evaluate the contribution of C 5 a to the recruitment of leukocytes in the mammary gland, and to specify the links between the complement system and the response of resident cells (leukocytes and mammary epithelial cells) to infection stimulus. This will help to define the contribution of the complement system to resistance against mastitis, and could help to differentiate animals more or less resistant to this frequent and costly disease...|$|R

Our findings not only provide {{a picture of the}} stable species at the interface, but also explain how this system can support reversible Mg deposition and as such we provide insights in how to design other electrolytes for Mg plating and stripping. The <b>active</b> <b>depositing</b> species are identified to be (MgCl) ^+ monomers coordinated by THF, which exhibit preferential adsorption on Mg compared to possible passivating species (such as THF solvent or neutral MgCl_ 2 complexes).

40|$|Examination of the {{mechanisms}} {{involved in the}} construction of present-day vegetative deposits along coastal waterways has made it possible to establish depositional patterns that can be compared with those found in similar environments in geologic time. These patterns include not only the composition and transport of the debris but also an estimation of the time involved in its deposition. Six sites with <b>active</b> <b>deposits</b> of plant macrodebris in the coastal basin of the Itanhaem River, Sao Paulo State, Brazil, were used in the study. In the central portion of the basin, the interior coastal plain is covered with restinga forest (dense, wet tropical forest of low altitudes), while the lower portion consists of mangrove swamps. The coast reflects anthropogenic intervention, and only a few scattered remnants of precolonization dune vegetation remain. The results after three years of study suggest that the accumulation of plant macrodebris in the middle and lower portions of the basin is parautochthonous, since only the leaves of genera typical of the restinga forest and mangrove swamp, respectively, were found. Along the coast the accumulations involved a mixture of parautochthonous and allochthonous elements. On the levee of the Branco River and within the mangrove swamp, deposition was slow, and many of the elements decayed quickly; such accumulations show little potential for preservation and eventual fossilization. A different site, however, reveals the rapid deposition of thick layers of plant debris, presumably associated with storms, and these accumulations are preserved for long periods, constituting good candidates for possible fossilization.
