5|$|In the post-Second World War period, the Soviet Union began {{developing}} a capable fleet of long-range bombers with the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> nuclear weapons across North America and Europe. The main threat was principally from high-speed, high-altitude bombing runs launched from the Soviet Union travelling over the Arctic against military bases and built-up industrial centres in Canada and the United States. To counter this threat, Western countries strenuously undertook {{the development of}} interceptors that could engage and destroy these bombers before they reached their targets.|$|E

5|$|Leonardo was a {{contemporary}} of Botticelli, Domenico Ghirlandaio and Perugino, {{who were all}} slightly older than he was. He would have met them at the workshop of Verrocchio, with whom they had associations, and at the Academy of the Medici. Botticelli was a particular favourite of the Medici family, and thus his success as a painter was assured. Ghirlandaio and Perugino were both prolific and ran large workshops. They competently delivered commissions to well-satisfied patrons who appreciated Ghirlandaio's ability to portray the wealthy citizens of Florence within large religious frescoes, and Perugino's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> a multitude of saints and angels of unfailing sweetness and innocence.|$|E
5|$|The Xbox 360 {{does not}} have support for Steamworks. Newell {{said that they would}} have liked to bring the service to the console through the game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, which would have allowed Valve to provide the same feature set that it did for the PlayStation 3, but later said that {{cross-platform}} play would not be present in {{the final version of the}} game. Valve attributes the inability to use Steamworks on the Xbox 360 to limitations in the Xbox Live regulations of the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> patches and new content. Valve's Erik Johnson stated that Microsoft requires that new content must be certified and validated before distribution, which would limit the usefulness of Steamworks' delivery approach.|$|E

5|$|Bradman's {{relentless}} use of {{his pace}} attack and fieldsmen also raised eyebrows. At the time, Lindwall and Miller were groundbreaking fast bowlers, with high pace and the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> menacing short-pitched bowling at the upper body of the English batsmen. Prior to the Second World War, pace bowlers were generally much slower and did not often bowl at the body. England had yet to develop bowlers such as Lindwall and Miller, and as a result, Australia were able to pepper the upper body of the opposition without fear of retaliation. At times, the public found Lindwall and Miller's short-pitched bowling to be excessive and booed the Australians. On the fielding front, Barnes was deployed {{as close to the}} bat as possible at either forward short-leg or point, with one foot on the pitch. This had an intimidatory effect on the batsmen and led many to question whether it was {{in the spirit of the}} game.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} hostilities, McLachlan {{volunteered to}} serve with the Allied {{occupation}} forces in Japan. He married Margaret Helen Chrystal on 5January 1946; they had {{a son and a}} daughter. Promoted to acting air commodore on 1March, he was appointed SASO of the British Commonwealth Air Group (BCAIR), headquartered in Kure and responsible for No.81 Wing RAAF, as well as squadrons from the Royal Air Force, Royal New Zealand Air Force, and Indian Air Force. Returning to Australia in 1948, he served as Air Commodore Operations at RAAF Headquarters, Melbourne, at which time the English Electric Canberra was ordered as Australia's first jet bomber, partly for its <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> nuclear weapons. He completed his term in September 1951 and took over North-Eastern Area Command, based at Townsville, Queensland. Following his appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1954 New Year's Honours, McLachlan was posted to Britain for three years, first attending the Imperial Defence College, London, and then serving as RAF Director of Flying Training at the Air Ministry during 1955–56. Raised to air vice-marshal, he returned to Australia in 1957 to become Air Officer Commanding (AOC) Training Command in Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall and Miller were {{groundbreaking}} fast bowlers, {{with high}} pace and the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> menacing short-pitched bowling {{at the upper}} body of the batsmen. Prior to World War II, pace bowlers were generally much slower and rarely bowled at the body. England were yet to develop similar bowlers, and as a result, Australia were able to pepper the upper body of the opposition without fear of retaliation. At one stage, the Australian short-pitched barrage prompted the English selectors to drop leading batsman Hutton, something that provoked great controversy. Lindwall and Johnston dominated the home batsmen and took 27 wickets apiece, at averages of 19.62 and 23.33 respectively, while the injury-prone Miller took 13 at 23.15. For England, the batsman emerging with most credit was Compton, who scored 562 runs at 62.44. Washbrook (356 runs at 50.85) {{was the only other}} player to average beyond 45.|$|E
40|$|Increasingly governments {{worldwide}} regulate charities, {{seeking to}} restrict the number of organizations claiming taxation exemptions, reduce abuse of state support and fraud. Under public interest theory governments may increase philanthropy through public trust and confidence in charities. Under public choice theory regulators will maximize political returns, ‘manage’ charity-government relationships, and avoid regulatory capture. Phillips and Smith (2014) suggest that charities’ regulatory regimes should coalesce, despite jurisdictional diversity. We analyse charity regulatory regimes against underlining theories of regulation, and assess regulatory costs and benefits. Thus regulators can reduce regulatory inefficiency, and balance accountability and transparency demands with charities’ <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver...</b>|$|R

5|$|There {{were few}} {{airborne}} {{resources available to}} the British Army by mid-1941. The only unit trained and available for an airborne operation was No. 11 Special Air Service Battalion, {{there were very few}} transport aircraft available to transport an airborne force, there were few RAF flight crews with experience of parachute droppings and none with operational experience, and there were no specialized overseas facilities to cater exclusively for airborne operations. However, it had been decided that some form of airborne operation would have to be carried out. The reasons for mounting an operation with such meagre resources were two-fold; firstly a successful raid would demonstrate {{to the rest of the}} world that Britain was still a force to be reckoned with and had not been defeated, and secondly a raid would test the fighting ability of the battalion and its equipment, as well as the RAF's <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> paratroopers at a predetermined location at a required time. The target chosen for the operation was an aqueduct that crossed the Tragino river in the Campania province of southern Italy near the town of Calitri. The aqueduct carried the main water supply for the province of Apulia, which at the time was inhabited by approximately two million Italians and included the strategically important port of Taranto; it was hoped that destroying the aqueduct and depriving the population of their regular water supply would damage their morale, and also have some impact on the Italian war efforts in North Africa and Albania. The aqueduct was a significant distance from the Italian coast, making it unlikely that a sea-borne raiding party could reach it, and it was believed that it was too strongly constructed to be destroyed by aerial bombing; as such, an airborne raid conducted by parachute troops was thought to be the ideal way to eliminate the aqueduct.|$|E

40|$|Why has protest {{participation}} seemingly exploded {{across much}} of Latin America in recent years? How do individual- and country-level characteristics interact to explain the rise of contentious politics in countries like Argentina, Brazil, and Venezuela? I contend that the recent wave of protests in Latin America {{is the result of}} trends in community engagement and institutional development across the regionâ€™s young democracies. Specifically, I argue that low-quality institutions in democratic regimes push an increasingly large number of civically active Latin Americans toward more radical modes of political participation, as governmentsâ€™ <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>deliver</b> on citizensâ€™ expectations fail to match the capacity for mobilization of active democrats. Drawing on cross-national surveys of Latin America, I test this argument, finding that an interactive relationship between community engagement and ineffective political institutions helps explain the recent spike in protest activity in certain cases and the vast differences in protest participation observed throughout the region...|$|R
