5|$|At 10:00, the Germans {{began their}} most {{successful}} {{assault on the}} perimeter, attacking the southeastern end with infantry supported by newly arrived Tiger tanks.

Strong counterattacks from the mixed defenders <b>and</b> <b>concentrated</b> shellfire from south of the river eventually repelled the Germans.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 1919, the Commission {{had spent}} £7,500, and this figure rose to £250,000 in 1920 as {{construction}} of cemeteries and memorials increased. By 1921, the Commission had established 1,000cemeteries which were ready for headstone erections, and burials. Between 1920 and 1923, the Commission was shipping 4,000headstones a week to France. In many cases, the Commission closed small cemeteries <b>and</b> <b>concentrated</b> the graves into larger ones. By 1927, when the majority of construction had been completed, over 500cemeteries had been built, with 400,000headstones, a thousand Crosses of Sacrifice, and 400 Stones of Remembrance.|$|E

Turkey ruled Hejaz until the Arab Revolt of 1916 and controlled the Muslim holy city of Mecca throughout the war. The Sultan's title of Caliph was recognised as legitimate by most Muslims, including those in Afghanistan and India.|$|E

His style was at odds with British rock contemporaries such as The Kinks' Mick Avory and The Shadows' Brian Bennett who did not consider tom-toms necessary for rock music.

5|$|Stoddart {{was born}} in Edinburgh and raised in Renfrewshire, where he {{developed}} an early interest {{in the arts and}} music, and later trained in fine art at the Glasgow School of Art (1976–1980) and read the History of Art at the University of Glasgow. During this time he became increasingly critical of contemporary trends in art, such as pop art, <b>and</b> <b>concentrated</b> on creating figurine pieces in clay. Stoddart associates the lack of form in modern art with social decay; in contrast, his works include many classical allusions.|$|E
5|$|Technetium {{is located}} in the seventh group of the {{periodic}} table, between rhenium and manganese. As predicted by the periodic law, its chemical properties are between those two elements. Of the two, technetium more closely resembles rhenium, particularly in its chemical inertness and tendency to form covalent bonds. Unlike manganese, technetium does not readily form cations (ions with a net positive charge). Technetium exhibits nine oxidation states from −1 to +7, with +4, +5, and +7 being the most common. Technetium dissolves in aqua regia, nitric acid, <b>and</b> <b>concentrated</b> sulfuric acid, but it is not soluble in hydrochloric acid of any concentration.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet forces {{attempted}} to capture Estonia and its capital Tallinn.

The Red Army command presumed that the main direction of retreat for the German forces would be Tallinn, <b>and</b> <b>concentrated</b> their forces there in an attempt to block the roads.|$|E

5|$|The Spanish forces {{expected}} the Americans {{to attack the}} northern region of the island <b>and</b> <b>concentrated</b> their defenses around San Juan and Arecibo.

However, the southern and western regions of Puerto Rico were left with little or no defenses at all.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} does demonstrate {{elements of}} Classical Revival architecture {{but they are}} minimal <b>and</b> <b>concentrated</b> around the front entrance. Below the front entrance hood there are two stone pilasters and a stone lintel, as well as relief work adorning the pediment; leading to the front entrance are seven concrete stairs. The entire entry facade is a gable-front, temple style design and on the library's east wing there are stone-capped modified buttresses. Each of these elements demonstrates the Classical Revival style.|$|E
5|$|The lack of {{sustained}} <b>and</b> <b>concentrated</b> attacks on radar left it free to help direct {{the deployment of}} RAF units at opportune moments. Its continued warnings of incoming raids were a crucial benefit to Fighter Command. The Luftwaffe also had poor intelligence {{on the type of}} RAF airfields. It made repeated errors, often misidentifying airfields as Fighter Command bases, which turned out to belong to RAF Coastal Command and RAF Bomber Command. On Adlertag, most of the targets on the Luftwaffes list—if destroyed—would not have impaired Fighter Command in the slightest.|$|E

5|$|These desertions alarmed Gaddafi, as the GUNT {{provided}} {{a cover of}} legitimacy to Libya's presence in Chad. To put a halt to these and reunite the GUNT, a major offensive was launched on the Red Line {{with the goal of}} taking N'Djamena. The attack, started on 10 February 1986, involved 5,000 Libyan and 5,000 GUNT troops, <b>and</b> <b>concentrated</b> on the FANT outposts of Kouba Olanga, Kalait and Oum Chalouba. The campaign ended in disaster for Gaddafi, when a FANT counteroffensive on 13 February using the new equipment obtained from the French forced the attackers to withdraw and reorganize.|$|E

In August 1940, some officers and non-commissioned officers (NCO) were sent to Achnacarry in the Scottish Highlands on a commando course. These men were then responsible for teaching the rest of the unit.|$|E
