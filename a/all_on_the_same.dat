5|$|The {{possibility}} of an en passant capture is relevant to claims of a draw by threefold repetition. Two positions whose pieces are <b>all</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> squares, with the same player to move, are for this purpose considered different {{if there was an}} opportunity to make an enpassant capture in the first position, and of course that opportunity no longer exists the second time the same configuration of pieces occurs.|$|E
5|$|The first {{allegations}} of detainee abuse came in early February 2007, when University of Ottawa law professor Amir Attaran produced documents {{he had received}} through an access-to-information request showing that three prisoners {{in the custody of}} Canadian military police were brought in by their Afghan interrogator for treatment of similar injuries to the head and upper body, <b>all</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> day. Attaran argued this could be evidence of torture {{on the part of the}} interrogator and should be investigated. Attaran has maintained these allegations, stating in 2010 that the documents show torture of detainees was an actual tactic used to obtain information during interrogation.|$|E

The rotary phone had at some point been moved out of the bedroom and into the kitchen, where the police found it after the murders with its receiver off the hook.

25|$|Redmond first {{attended}} political {{meetings with}} Parnell in 1879. Upon his father's death later in 1880, {{he wrote to}} Parnell asking for adoption as the Nationalist Party (from 1882 the Irish Parliamentary Party) candidate in the by-election to fill the open seat, but was disappointed to learn that Parnell had already promised the next vacancy to his secretary Timothy Healy. Nevertheless, Redmond supported Healy as the nominee, and when another vacancy arose, this time in New Ross, he won election unopposed as the Parnellite candidate for the seat. On election (31 January 1881), he rushed to the House of Commons, made his maiden speech next day amid stormy scenes following the arrest of Michael Davitt, then a Land League leader, and was ejected from the Commons <b>all</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> evening. He served as MP for New Ross from 1881 to 1885, for North Wexford from 1885 to 1891 and finally for Waterford City from 1891 {{until his death in}} 1918.|$|E
25|$|When rodeo riders invaded Hollywood, {{they brought}} {{a battery of}} rodeo {{techniques}} that Canutt would expand and improve, including horse falls and wagon wrecks, along with the harnesses and cable rigs to make the stunts foolproof and safe. Among the new safety devices was the 'L' stirrup, which allowed a man to fall off a horse without getting hung in the stirrup. Canutt also developed cabling and equipment to cause spectacular wagon crashes, while releasing the team, <b>all</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> spot every time. Safety methods such as these saved film-makers time and money and prevented accidents and injury to performers. One of Yakima's inventions was the 'Running W' stunt, bringing down a horse at the gallop by attaching a wire, anchored to the ground, to its fetlocks and launching the rider forwards spectacularly. This either killed the horse, or rendered it badly shaken and unusable {{for the rest of}} the day. The 'Running W' is now banned and has been replaced with the falling-horse technique. It is believed that the last time it was used was on the 1983 Iraqi film al-Mas' Ala Al-Kubra when British actor and friend of Yak Marc Sinden and stuntman Ken Buckle (who had been trained by Yak) performed the stunt three times during a cavalry charge sequence.|$|E

[...] Morris praised X-Men: The Last Stand for [...] "put the heroes of a mighty summer {{blockbuster}} in a rare mortal position. Realism {{at this time of}} year? How unorthodox!" [...] Roger Ebert gave the films mostly positive reviews, but criticized them for the amount of mutants, stating [...] "their powers are so various and ill-matched that it's hard to keep them <b>all</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> canvas." ...|$|E

According to Seto, Yamazaki was {{the person who had}} the most influence on the game, but his ideas sometimes clashed with Eshiro's, as Eshiro had to view the game as a product and give feedback based on that; the staff then had to create a compromise that both Yamazaki and Eshiro could accept. This led to long discussions, and eventually Seto had to make final decisions on what to do, which he called [...] "no small task"; some big decisions took days to make.|$|E
500|$|According to Holt, {{recording}} for {{the album}} was expected to commence {{at the end of}} 2013. King later stated that there were plans to begin recording in January 2014.

On April 24, 2014, Slayer offered a free download of [...] "Implode," [...] their first song in five years as well as their first recording to feature Holt on guitar.

500|$|During the descent, the peloton chased {{hard and}} reduced Weening's {{advantage}} to 30 seconds, with Sky still leading the peloton. Louis Meintjes (Lampre–Merida) crashed {{shortly before the}} final climb began. On the climb, Louis Vervaeke attacked with [...] remaining and passed Weening. Within the final , the peloton caught him and the peloton stayed together, led by Sky, as the road descended briefly before the final ascent to the finishing line. Wout Poels (Sky) attacked as the road began to rise, but was followed by Contador. Quintana attacked next and was chased by Ilnur Zakarin (Katusha) and Contador. Richie Porte attempted to escape the group, but he was chased down by Froome. Quintana then attacked again and was followed by Dan Martin, who then passed Quintana and moved into the lead. Tejay van Garderen (BMC) chased, with Contador following, but Martin was able to stay away to the finish line. Contador finished two seconds back, with Romain Bardet (...) third and van Garderen fourth, <b>all</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time. With the bonus seconds, Martin moved into the overall lead, six seconds ahead of Contador.|$|E
500|$|Despite stating he was [...] "100 percent" [...] healthy {{after the}} groin injury {{suffered}} two games prior, it appeared the injury was still lingering; after throwing a pass {{during the third}} quarter, Cutler fell down and grabbed his groin, before standing back up. [...] Regarding the injuries, Cutler stated, [...] "It held up OK. It's <b>all</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> leg so I {{think that was a}} problem. But the groin, you take the ankle out of the equation and I would have been fine, I think." [...] Cutler ended the game having completed 21 of 40 passes for 250 yards with a touchdown, interception and a 69.8 passer rating. Despite x-rays on his ankle being negative, Cutler was ruled out of the next week's game against the Baltimore Ravens with a high ankle sprain. During the second quarter, Charles Tillman was also injured, suffering a torn right triceps brachii muscle, and was placed on injured reserve with the designation to return, allowing him to practice after six weeks and play in games two weeks after; as a result, Tillman missed the entire regular season.|$|E
500|$|On September 11, a {{tropical}} wave entered the eastern Pacific. An area of convection developed {{when it was}} [...] west of {{the southern tip of}} Baja California Peninsula. A trough axis extended southward from the low {{to the west of the}} convection. By September 15, the area of disturbed weather included some convective bands. The organization of the convection improved and the cloud system became Tropical Depression Eleven-E the next day. The trough that was near the depression moved the cyclone to the north-northwest and during that period it strengthened and became Tropical Storm Ignacio, <b>all</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> day. With time, the influence of the trough over Tropical Storm Ignacio diminished. The track of the tropical storm transcribed a small clockwise loop, and Ignacio reached the northernmost point of the loop on September 17. The storm was centered about 28miles (45km) offshore and was near its peak intensity, [...] Further intensification was precluded by the storm's proximity to land and by shear associated with the upper level low near the Baja California peninsula. As Ignacio turned toward the east, its forward motion slowed. When the storm began moving to the south, it lost its identity very rapidly. Ignacio weakened to depression status and dissipated six hours later. The remnants of Ignacio moved toward the west-southwest over the next two days.|$|E
