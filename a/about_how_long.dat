5|$|After {{percutaneous}} coronary interventions (PCIs), such as {{the placement}} of a coronary artery stent, a U.S. Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality guideline recommends that aspirin be taken indefinitely. Frequently, aspirin is combined with an ADP receptor inhibitor, such as clopidogrel, prasugrel, or ticagrelor to prevent blood clots. This is called dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). United States and European Union guidelines disagree somewhat <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>long,</b> and for what indications this combined therapy should be continued after surgery. U.S. guidelines recommend DAPT for at least 12 months, while EU guidelines recommend DAPT for 6–12 months after a drug-eluting stent placement. However, they agree that aspirin be continued indefinitely after DAPT is complete.|$|E
5|$|Under {{appellation}} rules, around 4,000 kilograms (8,800 pounds) {{of grapes}} can be pressed to create up to 673 gallons (either 2,550 L or 3,060 L) of juice. The first 541 gallons (either 2,050 L or 2,460 L) are the cuvée {{and the next}} 132 gallons (either 500 L or 600 L) are the taille. Prior to 1992, a second taille of 44 gallons (either 167 L or 200 L) was previously allowed. For vintage Champagne, 100% of the grapes must come from that vintage year while non-vintage wine {{is a blend of}} vintages. Vintage champagne must spend a minimum of three years of aging. There are no regulations <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> it must spend on its lees, but some of the premier Champagne houses keep their wines on lees for upwards of five to ten years. Non-vintage Champagne must spend a minimum of 15 months of aging but only a minimum of 12 months on the lees. Most of the Champagne houses keep their wines on the lees through the whole time of aging because it is more expense to bottle the wine then age it and finally shipped.|$|E

25|$|Manetho's Epitome {{has been}} a debated topic among Egyptologists with little {{consensus}} given {{the small number of}} surviving documents for his reign, but a 13-year reign is preferred by older scholars while newer scholars prefer a shorter 3-4 year reign for this king due to the minimal amount of scarabs and monuments attested under Thutmose II. It is still possible to estimate when Thutmose II's reign would have begun by means of a heliacal rise of Sothis in Amenhotep I's reign, which would give him a reign from 1493 to 1479 BC, although uncertainty about how to interpret the rise also permits a date from 1513 to 1499 BC, and uncertainty <b>about</b> <b>how</b> <b>long</b> Thutmose I ruled could also potentially place his reign several years earlier still. Nonetheless, scholars generally assign him a reign from 1493 or 1492 to 1479.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{municipality}} has a “double-barrelled name”, {{there are actually}} two names to interpret. Oberweiler has a meaning that is perfectly comprehensible to a modern-day German speaker (it would be expressed oberer Weiler today), namely “upper hamlet”, {{and it was so}} named to distinguish it from a now vanished and forgotten “lower hamlet”. The Verbandsgemeinde website states that Oberweiler was for a time also called Unterweiler to distinguish it from the nearby municipality of Oberweiler im Tal, making Oberweiler itself the “lower hamlet”, at least in name. As early as 1290, a document, whose content is now known only from a copy, mentions the modern name Oberweiler. More exact data <b>about</b> just <b>how</b> <b>long</b> before its ﬁrst documentary mention the hamlet was founded cannot be ascertained. The name Tiefenbach ﬁrst crops up in an original document from 1316 as Dyffenbach. The ending —bach (“brook”) refers to the Breitbach.|$|R

[...] The strike continued until February 1990, when a settlement was agreed upon by both parties. The settlement was reached after taking the demands to court several times and after many ratifications were made.

40|$|This is {{the second}} part of an article <b>about</b> <b>how</b> schooling, <b>long</b> geared to the {{concerns}} and interests of the middle classes, remains so, and is becoming increasingly so in some ways. In Part One, published in the last issue, I drew a parallel with Al Gore’s well-known film about climate change to argue for middle class advantage as education’s ‘inconvenient truth’. This is because while it is now pretty clear that education policies of recent decades have benefited the middle classes rather than the poor, there is at various points public, practitioner and policy denial of the problem. This denial reflects the self-interest of the middle classes and those who serve them. I focussed in Part One on the likely advantages provided by predominantly middle class school settings and how the middle classes have long targeted such schools for their children. This problem continues: indeed Part One showed how the New Zealand middle classes have been able to secure and in some ways improve their access to schools with a predominantly middle class mix under the zoning policies introduced in 2000...|$|R
40|$|Project {{success has}} always been an {{important}} topic in the project management literature. One of the main discussions is concerned with how a project’s success is evaluated and what factors lead to achieving this success.

Recently, questions have been raised in the literature as to whether we should be evaluating project success beyond the close out phase, to better account for organizational and societal outcomes.   However, not much has been published <b>about</b> <b>how</b> the <b>long</b> term impacts and outcomes are measured.
