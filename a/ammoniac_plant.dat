40|$|In {{the thesis}} {{optimization}} of maintenance management is discussed including aspects of historical overview, maintenance concepts and comparing maintenance management with other management areas. Maintenance optimization models are reviewed {{and five of}} the most popular models are discussed more detailed. Application and its difficulties are given. Future prospects of maintenance are predicted. A solution of the problem is proposed. It includes the basic theories {{in a wide range of}} fields such as mathematics, management, dependability, informatic science, etc. It describes how to build a general optimization model to determine the intervals of time to preceded maintenance activities. It also covers engineering practice including dependability modelling and prediction, failure modes, effect and criticality analysis, even tree analysis, fault tree analysis and shows how they can be applied in the proposed method. The proposal of the Optimization Maintenance Program is applied for an <b>ammoniac</b> <b>plant.</b> The plant description is given and then, step by step, procedures needed for the proposed method of optimization are introduced. The results of the analysis are documented in form of tables. Available from STL Prague, CZ / NTK - National Technical LibrarySIGLECZCzech Republi...|$|E
