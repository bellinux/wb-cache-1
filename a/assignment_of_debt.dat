The thesis examines {{the problems of}} prohibition of assignment in certain cases, factoring and bulk assignment. It also focuses on assignment of future debts and on consequences of invalid assignments. The thesis is composed of eight chapters. Chapter One is introductory and defines {{the aim of the}} thesis and methods of work used. Chapter Two serves as necessary basis by defining assignment, parties to the assignment and points at relevant legislation. Chapter Three examines prohibition of assignment. The chapter consists of three parts. Part One addresses the legal grounds of unassignability. Part Two investigates the conception of invalidity under Czech law and its legitimacy in assignment. Part Three focuses on questionable grounds and answers whether they do evoke invalidity of assignment. Chapter Four is subdivided into five parts and focuses on factoring. Part One defines the term factoring. Part Two looks at its functions. Part three distinguishes types of factoring. Part Four provides data showing use of factoring in Czech Republic. Part Five concerns on legal basis for factoring. Chapter Five concentrates on [...] ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>debts</b> is a {{procedure}} based {{on which a}} debt is transferred from an original creditor to a new creditor. This procedure consists in a bipartite agreement (free of charge or for consideration) concluded between the original creditor (acting as assignor) and the new creditor (acting as assignee); the debtor {{is not part of}} the agreement. Nevertheless, according to the provisions of the New Civil Code 1, there are certain situations when the consent of the debtor is required (e. g. the debt is essentially related to the assignor’s person). As mentioned above, the main function <b>of</b> the <b>debts</b> <b>assignment</b> consists in transferring the debt. However, the doctrine and jurisprudence have revealed other functions of this legal procedure, e. g. payment <b>of</b> a <b>debt</b> that the original creditor (assignor) owes to the new creditor (assignee), guarantee the achievement of a receivable.

40|$|Examining {{the legal}} {{history of the}} order to pay money {{initiating}} a funds transfer, the author tracks basic principles of modern law to those that governed the payment order of Antiquity and the Middle Ages. Exploring the legal nature of the payment order and its underpinning in light of contemporary institutions and payment mechanisms, the book traces the evolution of money, payment mechanisms and the law that governs them, from developments in Ancient Mesopotamia, Ancient Greece, Rome, and Greco-Roman Egypt, through medieval Europe and post-medieval England. Doctrine is examined in Jewish, Islamic, Roman, common and civil laws. Investigating such diverse legal systems and doctrines {{at the intersection of}} laws governing bank deposits, obligations, the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> <b>debts,</b> and negotiable instruments, the author identifies the common denominator for the evolving legal principles and speculates on possible reciprocity. At the same time he challenges the idea of 2 ̆ 7 law merchant 2 ̆ 7 as a mercantile creation. The book provides an account of the evolution of payment law as a distinct cohesive body of legal doctrine applicable to funds transfers. It shows how principles of law developed in tandem with the evolution of banking and in response to changing circumstances and proposes a redefinition of 2 ̆ 7 law merchant 2 ̆ 7. The author points to deposit banking and emerging technologies as embodying a great potential for future non-cash payment system growth. However, he recommends caution in predicting both the future of deposit banking and the overall impact of technology. At the same time he expresses confidence in the durability of legal doctrine to continue to evolve and accommodate future payment system developments. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|Notice {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the equitable <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> legal choses in action, such as a contractual debt. As noted in a recent treatise, once the debtor is given notice of the equitable assignment: (i) should she pay the sum owed to her creditor, she is not discharged from her obligation but will have to make payment again to the assignee [the 2 ̆ 7 no discharge after notice 2 ̆ 7 rule]; (ii) the assignee’s right against the debtor has priority against subsequent assignments by the assignor, in order of precedence of notice [the rule as to priorities]; and (iii) the debtor is no longer entitled to assert such equities as may arise between herself and the creditor postnotice to reduce her liability to the assignee by way of setoff [the rule as to equities]. Leaving aside discussion of the second and third of these rules for another day, this paper will focus on an examination of the 2 ̆ 7 no discharge after notice 2 ̆ 7 rule. This is prompted because the rule as applied in the context <b>of</b> equitable <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> a <b>debt</b> presents a contradiction: it does not explain how it is that the common law rules as to discharge by precise performance and the invariability of contractual obligations are displaced by what appear to be equitable doctrines relating to assignment and notice thereof. By examining the mechanics and subject matter <b>of</b> an equitable <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> a chose in action, this paper will demonstrate that the rule may, perhaps, have been too broadly stated and that the true position is quite otherwise: that a debtor is discharged from her obligation to make payment so long as she precisely performs her obligations as set out in the contract, even if the rights under that contract have been assigned to a third party to that contract, the equitable assignee, and even if she has been notified <b>of</b> such <b>assignment.</b> The paper will then examine whether the same may be true in the case <b>of</b> a statutory <b>assignment...</b>|$|R

In particular, this thesis examines the role <b>of</b> external <b>debt</b> finance for funding investments in R&D in the bank-based continental European country Belgium and how this relates to the receipt of public support. Previous literature has largely focused on investigating {{the extent to which}} R&D performing companies rely on their internal financial resources and the effectiveness of various types of public support programs such as the <b>assignment</b> <b>of</b> R&D subsidies or tax credits. However, academic research on the use <b>of</b> external <b>debt</b> finance for R&D and innovation remains scarce. The aim of this dissertation is to contribute to this underexplored research area. More specifically, the thesis starts with an analysis on what types of companies actually make use <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> finance for their internal R&D activities. Next, the real impact of the 2008 - 2009 financial crisis on R&D activities at the firm level is examined, an occurrence that was characterized by severe credit tightening. The last part of the dissertation investigates the link between the receipt of selective public support for R&D and the access to bank financing. In particular, the impact of an R&D grant receipt stemming from a reputable government agency on an R&D performing company’s cost <b>of</b> <b>debt</b> is examined. status: publishe...|$|R
