5|$|The early 1970s saw {{a wave of}} singer-songwriters {{who drew}} on the introspective, deeply {{emotional}} and personal lyrics of 1960s folk-rock. They included James Taylor, Carole King and others, all known just as much for their lyric ability as for their performances. The same period saw the rise of bluesy Southern rock and country rock groups like the Allman Brothers Band and Lynyrd Skynyrd. In the 1970s, soft rock developed, a kind of simple, unobtrusive and mellow form of pop-rock, exemplified {{by a number of}} bands like America <b>and</b> <b>Bread,</b> most of whom are little remembered today; many were one-hit wonders. In addition, harder arena rock bands like Chicago and Styx also saw some major success.|$|E

Estimates indicate that the government has to increase existing prices by an average of 2.5 times to achieve the lower target and by 4 times for the maximum target. According to the IMF, Iranians can expect the first price hike to lift energy product prices between four and 20 times previous levels, with prices surging even higher eventually.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Chicken for a prebrowned {{fried chicken}} product was soaked in {{phosphate}} (Kena) and/or salt for 16 hours, then fried, {{to evaluate the}} effect of marination solutions. This was followed by an evaluation of eight cooking methods. These methods included precooking by: steaming, simmering, boiling, all followed by <b>breading,</b> battering <b>and</b> <b>breading</b> then frying to brown; <b>and</b> <b>breading,</b> battering <b>and</b> <b>breading</b> followed by deep fat frying to doneness. Also included were four methods involving steaming after <b>breading</b> and/or battering <b>and</b> <b>breading.</b> The methods were evaluated by taste paneling for tender-ness, juiciness, flavor and overall acceptability. Shear press values, total moisture and yields were determined. Marination in 1 - 3 % Kena improved flavor and yield, reduced shear values and in-creased total moisture {{when compared to the}} unsoaked control. Adding salt with the Kena improved flavor as well, after four days of refrigerated storage. Evaluation of the cooking methods indicated that simmering was slightly the best of the precook methods. The most desirable product, on the basis of shear values, total moisture and yields, was made by <b>breading,</b> battering, <b>and</b> <b>breading,</b> frying 20 seconds, steaming until done, then refrying 20 seconds. Taste panel scores showed no significant differences among the methods used, when the crust was removed before evaluation to avoid bias due to differences in seasonings...|$|R

5|$|The {{tradition}} of the dole continues to the present, and every Easter Monday tea, cheese <b>and</b> <b>bread</b> are given to local widows and pensioners {{through the windows of}} Biddenden's former workhouse. All those eligible for the annual dole are given a Biddenden cake, and they are sold as souvenirs to visitors. The cakes are baked so hard as to be inedible, to allow better preservation as souvenirs; they are baked in large batches every few years and kept until the stock runs out. Historically, the loaves used were of the archaic quartern loaf size, but this particular part of the tradition ended when Biddenden's last bakery closed in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{nuthatch}} eats mainly insects, particularly caterpillar and beetles. In autumn and winter, {{the diet}} is supplemented with nuts and seeds, hazel nuts and beech mast being preferred. The young are fed {{mainly on the}} insects favoured by their parents, with some seeds. Food items are found mainly on tree trunks and large branches, but smaller branches may also be investigated, and food may be taken from the ground, especially outside the breeding season. Nuthatches can forage when descending trees head first, as well as when climbing. Some prey is caught in flight, and a nuthatch will remove bark or rotten wood to reach insects, although it cannot chisel into healthy wood like a woodpecker. A pair may temporarily join a mixed-species foraging flock as it passes near their territory. The Eurasian nuthatch readily visits bird tables and bird feeders in winter, eating human-made food items such as fat, cheese, butter <b>and</b> <b>bread.</b> It has even been recorded as taking slaughterhouse offal. Sizeable hard food items like nuts or large insects are wedged into crevices in tree bark and smashed with the strong bill.|$|E
