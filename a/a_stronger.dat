(2007) {{reported}} that monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) {{infected with the}} recreated flu strain exhibited classic symptoms of the 1918 pandemic, and died from a cytokine storm—an overreaction of the immune system. This may explain why the 1918 flu had its surprising effect on younger, healthier people, as a person with <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> immune system would potentially have <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> overreaction.|$|E
5|$|According to some genealogists, Lady Macbeth and King Duncan's {{wife were}} {{siblings}} or cousins, where Duncan's wife had <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> {{claim to the}} throne than Lady Macbeth. It was this that incited her jealousy and hatred of Duncan.|$|E

5|$|A Dutch {{proposal}} {{to build new}} battleships was originally tendered in 1912, after years of concern over {{the expansion of the}} Imperial Japanese Navy and the withdrawal of allied British warships from the China Station. Only four coastal defense ships were planned, but naval experts and the Tweede Kamer (lower house of the parliament) believed that acquiring dreadnoughts would provide <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> defense for the Nederlands-Indië (Netherlands East Indies, abbr. NEI), so a Royal Commission was formed in June 1912.|$|E

5|$|After the {{revisions}} were completed, much of {{the plot}} stayed the same, but several events in the original draft were cut out to strengthen the whole book. Stead combined two characters into one, having <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> outline and also cut out several scenes for minor characters. In the end, Stead found that the revisions helped to make the book more cohesive.|$|E
5|$|All {{living things}} on Earth (including methanogens) use liquid {{water as a}} solvent; it is speculated that life on Titan might instead use a liquid hydrocarbon, such as methane or ethane. Water is <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> solvent than methane. Water is also more {{chemically}} reactive, and can break down large organic molecules through hydrolysis. A life-form whose solvent was a hydrocarbon would not face the risk of its biomolecules being destroyed in this way.|$|E

Her romantic feelings towards Sonic are kept intact, with a notable change being that she actively keeps her crush on him a secret, even from Sonic himself.|$|E

5|$|By March 1905, Potter {{was anxious}} to begin work on the tale. She thought the 1903 version too thin and rewrote the entire story, {{retaining}} Ribby the cat and Duchess the dog as the central characters while elaborating the setting and developing <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> plot line. It was decided the tale would be published in a format slightly larger than her previous productions with ten full-colour illustrations and other illustrations in pen and sepia ink.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s–1950s {{heyday of}} the big Hollywood studios, {{the status of women}} in the {{industry}} was abysmal and, while much has improved, many would argue that there is still much to be done. From art films by Sally Potter, Catherine Breillat, Claire Denis and Jane Campion to action movies by Kathryn Bigelow, women now have <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> voice, but are only too aware of the still lingering gender gap.|$|E
5|$|From 1786 to 1787, {{an armed}} uprising, known as Shays' Rebellion led by Revolutionary War veteran Daniel Shays wrought havoc {{throughout}} Massachusetts and ultimately attempted {{to seize the}} Federal armory.

5|$|Holden {{introduced}} the all-new VT Commodore in 1997, {{the outcome of}} a A$600million development programme that spanned more than five years. The new model featured a rounded exterior body shell, improved dynamics and many firsts for an Australian-built car. Also, <b>a</b> <b>stronger</b> body structure increased crash safety. The locally produced Buick-sourced V6 engine powered the Commodore range, as did the 5.0-litre Holden V8 engine, and was replaced in 1999 by the 5.7-litre LS unit.|$|E

50|$|Because the {{electric}} field is the gradient of the voltage distribution, rapid changes in voltage within a small region imply <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> electric field; on the converse, if the voltage remains {{approximately the same}} over a large region, {{the electric}} fields in that region must be weak. <b>A</b> <b>strong</b> electric field, equivalent to <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> voltage gradient, implies that <b>a</b> <b>strong</b> force is exerted on any charged particles that lie within the region.|$|R
