2500|$|Shortly {{after his}} appointment, he {{announced}} his intention to reform land law, to enshrine customary ownership of lands, and ensure that lands could not be leased {{without the consent of}} their collective traditional owners. This would be achieved by drawing inspiration from the Australian Northern Territory’s Northern Land Council, which is designed to safeguard Aboriginal customary land ownership. Describing himself as a “notorious critic” of free trade and foreign ownership of lands, he added: [...] "New Zealand, Australia and the World Bank <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> we need to get away from , but I totally disagree.

2500|$|On August 1, 2008 the FCC {{formally}} voted 3-to-2 {{to uphold}} {{a complaint against}} Comcast, the largest cable company in the US, ruling that it had illegally inhibited users of its high-speed Internet service from using file-sharing software. The FCC imposed no fine, but required Comcast to end such blocking in 2008. FCC chairman Kevin J. Martin said the order was meant to set a precedent that Internet providers, and indeed all communications companies, could not prevent customers from using their networks the way they see fit {{unless there is a}} good reason. In an interview Martin stated that [...] "We are preserving the open character of the Internet" [...] and [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> network operators can't block people from getting access to any content and any applications." [...] Martin's successor, Julius Genachowski has maintained that the FCC has no plans to regulate the internet, saying: [...] "I've been clear repeatedly that we're not going to regulate the Internet." [...] The Comcast case highlighted broader issues of whether new legislation is needed to force Internet providers to maintain net neutrality, i.e. treat all uses of their networks equally. The legal complaint against Comcast related to BitTorrent, software that is commonly used for downloading larger files.|$|E
