40|$|The {{question}} {{as to whether or not}} tempo effects distort the measurement of period mortality is controversial in recent demographic research. Only few publications, however, illustrate the underlying phenomenon of tempo effects, namely that the period death rate may increase although the mortality of all cohorts living during the analyzed period has fallen. Moreover, related literature only focuses on one of three methods to derive the <b>age-specific</b> <b>death</b> <b>rate.</b> This article primarily deals with the questions whether other methods of <b>age-specific</b> <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> are also affected by tempo effects in the logic of Bongaarts and Feeney and whether the tempo effect can be minimised solely by applying a specific method. The results demonstrate that all types of death rates are influenced by tempo effects and that different methods do not eliminate the influence of tempo effects.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{extension}} of the Lee-Carter method of modeling mortality to examine structural shifts in trajectories of mortality. Austrian data consisting of 53 years of single-age mortality rates are subdivided into 30 24 -year submatrices. Using singular value decomposition, the submatrices are decomposed into three component submatrices: 1) the multiple realizations of the index of mortality to which each respective <b>age-specific</b> <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> is linearly related; 2) the average shape across age of the log of mortality schedules; 3) the sensitivity of the log of mortality at each age to variations in the elements of the index of mortality. We refer to these latter submatrices to locate structural changes in mortality patterns. A comparison of the observed and estimated life expectancy indicates that the extended Lee-Carter method is superior to the original Lee-Carter method, particularly so for life expectancies at higher ages. We conclude by projecting life expectancy up to 2050, applying the Lee-Carter method to the whole time series (1947 - 1999) and comparing it to an application of the Lee-Carter method to the latest subsample (1976 - 1999).

40|$|It {{is often}} assumed that aging is a uniform process {{throughout}} adulthood {{because of the}} approximately linear increase of logarithmic mortality. We explored this assumption by analyzing cause-specific mortality increases in France (1979 – 1994). Rising rapidly at ages 30 – 54 years (‘‘middle age’’) are death rates from malignant neoplasms at various sites, acute myocardial infarction, hypertensive disease, and liver cirrhosis. Steeply increasing at 65 – 89 years (‘‘old age’’) are death rates from certain infectious diseases, particularly of the respiratory system; certain types of accidents; nonalcoholic mental disorders (probably due mainly to Alzheimer’s disease and senile dementia); heart failure; cerebrovascular disease; and some ‘‘vague’’ categories. The processes at work may be fundamentally different in these two life history stages, such that the mortality rise in middle age reflects specific chronic diseases that develop prematurely in some high-risk individuals, whereas the mortality increase in old age is dominated by senescent processes that eventually raise the vulnerability of almost all individuals to multiple pathologies.

40|$|In this note, the {{implications}} of rational addiction theory for the acquisition of habits and addiction are explored. It is shown that, if age-specific death rates are uniform, habits should either be acquired {{at the beginning of}} life or not at all. By contrast, under the more realistic assumption that death rates are higher at higher ages, the rational addiction model implies that any addiction with positive initial benefits should be taken up as soon as the <b>age-specific</b> <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> is sufficiently high. The rational addiction model of Becker and Murphy (1988) has stimulated a number of theoretical and empirical contributions and has been widely cited in the public debate over issues such as gambling policy (Productivity Commission 1999). The crucial claim made by Becker and Stigler is that it may be rational for individuals to acquire habits such as drug addiction, taking full account (in discounted present value terms) of the future costs. Empirical analysis of the rational addiction hypothesis, has, in general, been based on statistical tests, in which the null hypothesis is that of myopic behavior, taking no account of the future consequences of current consumption of addictive goods.

40|$|An approximate, {{short-cut}} {{method to}} produce the calculations for a current life table with the elimination of a cause of death is presented and illustrated. The method is to perform the usual calculations for a current life table using the schedule of rates obtained by subtracting the <b>age-specific</b> <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> for the cause to be eliminated from the corresponding death rate for all causes. When {{the risk of death}} for the cause of interest is not too large, the life table produced is comparable to that obtained from the theoretical development of Chiang [1968], involving the recalculation of the conditional probabilities of death in each age group to remove the effect of a particular risk of death. The mean value theorem for integrals provides the basis for the approximation; therefore, the approximation will be better with shorter age bands. This application of the theorem is equivalent to assuming exponential survivorship within each age band. For causes of death that are not too common and utilizing five year age bands, the method provides a good approximation to Chiang's approach to the recalculating of the conditional probabilities of death. An example is provided that demonstrates very reasonable approximation of the revised, age-specific probabilities of death and subsequently calculated age-specific life expectancies. *This research was completed under an Intergovernmental Personnel Act appointment while MJS was on leave from the Department of Biostatistics...|$|E

Surveillance of the populations most at-risk for unintentional, non-fire related (UNFR) carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning {{is crucial for}} targeting prevention efforts. ObjectiveThis study provides estimates on UNFR CO poisoning mortality in the United States and characterizes the at-risk populations. MethodsWe used 1999 to 2012 data to calculate death rates. We used underlying and multiple conditions variables from death records to identify UNFR CO poisoning cases. ResultsFor this study, we identified 6136 CO poisoning fatalities during 1999 to 2012 resulting in an average of 438 deaths annually. The annual average age-adjusted death rate was 1. 48 deaths per million. Fifty four percent of the deaths occurred in a home. Age-adjusted death rates were highest for males (2. 21 deaths per million) and non-Hispanic blacks (1. 74 deaths per million). The <b>age-specific</b> <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> was highest for those aged 22 ̆ 030585 years (6. 00 deaths per million). The annual rate of UNFR CO poisoning deaths did not change substantially during the study period, but we observed {{a decrease in the}} rate of suicide and unintentional fire related cases. ConclusionCO poisoning was the second most common non-medicinal poisonings death. Developing and enhancing current public health interventions could reduce ongoing exposures to CO from common sources, such as those in the residential setting.

40|$|For {{preparation}} of pandemic {{plans for the}} H 5 N 1 bird flu virus, it has been common practice among health authorities in several countries to use crude death figures from the Spanish flu pandemic as a worst case scenario. This has been done without taking into consideration either {{what is known about}} the molecular biology of malignant influenza viruses or the detailed statistical information that is available about the Spanish flu pandemic, as regards the variation of death risk as a function of age and also as regards the different behavior of the virus during successive pandemic waves. There is no scientific basis for the assumption that a new pandemic influenza virus cannot be worse than the Spanish flu virus. However, if we hypothetically assume recurrence of a pandemic influenza virus with virulence and transmissibility properties identical to the Spanish flu virus, but belonging to a subtype other than those that have been circulating in human populations since 1918, it will be unrealistic to assume that the older part of the population will be immune against a type of virus that their immune system has never encountered before. Therefore we have attempted to estimate what might have happened by counterfactually assuming that individuals in 1918 had not been immunized earlier against H 1 (or H 1 N 1) influenza viruses that were circulating before 1890.

30|$|To {{forecast}} mortality {{with the}} proposed model {{for women and}} men in the UK and Denmark, we take death counts and exposure times for single ages (0 to 100 +) and years from the Human Mortality Database (2013). Following Vallin and Meslé (2004), we assume that mortality of Danish women and men will increasingly converge to the lower overall mortality of other highly developed countries. In the validating forecast, we take mortality data from Sweden, and in the prospective forecast, we also include data from France, Italy, and Japan. We compute ROMIs for each <b>age-specific</b> <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> over time; the death rates are smoothed using P-splines (Currie et al. 2004; Eilers and Marx 1996). We then forecast the survival improvements with our second core model via JAGS by letting the Gibbs sample algorithm run with five parallel chains for a total of 5200 iterations after a burn-in period of 200 iterations. The run-length and related settings rely on the Raftery-Lewis diagnostic and trace plots, which are presented in the “Diagnostics” section. To avoid dependence between adjacent trials, we only save each fifth iterate for inferences. In addition, we exclude implausibly low and high forecasts for ROMIs by setting thresholds, i.e., they can neither fall below 0.005 nor can they exceed 0.035. These thresholds rely on observed values (see Fig.  1), and they imply a mortality decline for all ages at a minimum of 0.5 % and at a maximum of 3.5 %. An annual mortality improvement of 3.5 % is extraordinarily high and means that mortality can be reduced by half in less than 20  years. In case the model approaches minimum or maximum ROMIs, the forecasted death rates still decline with time. Appendix Table 3 summarizes all parameter settings for our mortality forecasts.|$|E
40|$|Background The age {{standardized}} <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> from {{motor neuron}} disease (MND) for persons 40 - 84 years {{of age in the}} Australian States of New South Wales, Victoria, and Queensland increased dramatically from 1958 to 2013. Nationally, <b>age-specific</b> MND <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> also increased over this time period, but the rate of the rise varied considerably by age-group. The historic use of lead (Pb) additives in Australian petrol is a candidate explanation for these trends in MND mortality (International Classification of Disease (ICD) - 10 G 12. 2). Methods Leveraging temporal and spatial variation in petrol lead exposure risk resulting from the slow rise and rapid phase-out of lead as a constituent in gasoline in Australia, we analyze relationships between (1) national <b>age-specific</b> MND <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> in Australia and age-specific lifetime petrol lead exposure, (2) annual between-age dispersions in <b>age-specific</b> MND <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> and <b>age-specific</b> lifetime petrol lead exposure; and (3) state-level age-standardized MND <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> as a function of age-weighted lifetime petrol lead exposure. Results Other things held equal, we find that a one percent increase in lifetime petrol lead exposure increases the MND <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> by about one-third of one percent in both national age-specific and state-level age-standardized models of MND mortality. Lending support to the supposition that lead exposure is a driver of MND mortality risk, we find that the annual between-age group standard deviation in <b>age-specific</b> MND <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> is strongly correlated with the between-age standard deviation in age-specific lifetime petrol lead exposure.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} the reversal in adult mortality trend from declining to rising in some segments of population in India, {{and to use}} an indirect demographic method to examine if this increase {{could be due to}} AIDS mortality. Also, to estimate the total excess deaths. Design: Cross-sectional data on <b>age-specific</b> <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> in 5 -year age-intervals from 25 to 44 years for the years 1970 to 1998 for rural/urban and male/female segments for each of 16 major states of India obtained from the government reports, and their projections till the year 2001. Methods: In view of reversal of trend in some areas, we tried to fit a parabola to the observed rates in each segment. A statistically significant fit in some segments revealed the year with least mortality rate when the reversal started. Another fit was obtained by projection of the previously declining trend. Excess deaths were estimated by applying the excess death rate to the population of the segment where reversal in trend was significant. Results: Reversal in declining mortality trend was detected in 65 of a total 256 age-sex-area (urban/rural) segments that we examined. Fourteen of the 16 States revealed reversal in at least one segment. The year of reversal in most segments coincides fairly well with the anticipated year of start of substantial AIDS mortality. At the national level, a total of at least 214, 390 deaths till 2001 were revealed as excess by this method. This number is quite low relative to the deaths otherwise attributed to AIDS in the country. Contrary to belief, increase in mortality due to AIDS was seen more commonly in rural areas than in urban areas, and more in females than in males. Conclusions: The indirect demographic method of estimating AIDS deaths in India yields an apparently low number of deaths, and does not confirm the belief that AIDS in India is spreading from urban to rural, and from male to female populations.

40|$|Background: In a {{previous}} study of the death rates in Tianjin in 1995, the author reported a high death rate from heart diseases and a low death rate from malignant neoplasms, compared with the corresponding rates recorded from other cities in China and Japan. Examination of the geographical variations of the death rates revealed clustering of deaths from cerebrovascular diseases and malignant neoplasms. The objective {{of the present study}} was to examine the mortality patterns in detail using data collected over the relatively long period of 1991 - 1996. Methods: The mortality statistics in Tianjin for the period of 1991 - 1996 were provided by the Department of Health, Tianjin, China. Population data were obtained from the censuses conducted in 1990 and 1995. The age-adjusted death rates, age-specific death rates and the standardized mortality ratios(SMRs) in the 18 districts of Tianjin were calculated for the three leading causes of death by sex. Results: The total number of deaths in Tianjin during the period 1991 - 1996 was 303, 737. Of these, 63. 7 % was attributed to the three leading causes of death. The age-adjusted death rates and age-specific death rates from heart diseases and malignant neoplasms decreased for both men and women during the study period. However, during the same period, the age-adjusted death rate, and for the most of part, the <b>age-specific</b> <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> from cerebrovascular diseases remained at a stable level in both sexes. Analysis of the geographical distribution of the death rates showed that the SMRs for heart diseases were high in the Northwest, the SMRs for cerebrovascular diseases were high in the eastern part of the urban area of Tianjin and in the eastern part of Tianjin, and those for malignant neoplasms were high in the urban and coastal areas. The geographical patterns of deaths from cerebrovascular diseases and malignant neoplasms were consistent with those indicated in the previous study. Conclusion: The present analysis determined the geographical patterns of deaths from the three leading causes of death within Tianjin, and a decreasing trend was apparent in the death rates from heart diseases and malignant neoplasms, while the death rate from cerebrovascular diseases remained stable during the study period. The results of the current study indicated that measures for the prevention and control of non-communicable chronic diseases in Tianjin, particularly of cerebrovascular diseases, were scarcely effective in the 1990 s. The results also emphasize the need for special intervention in specific target districts of Tianjin. 　前回， 1995 年天津市の死亡状況について研究を行い，天津市の心疾患死亡率は中国都市地域，日本より高く，悪性心疾患の死亡率は中国都市地域，日本より低いことを明らかにした．また，市区の東部と天津市の東部地域は脳血管疾患の死亡率が高く，全市区と浜海区は悪性新生物の死亡率が高いことも明らかになった．　本研究では， 1991 年から 1996 年の死亡資料を用いて，詳細に天津市の死亡状況を明らかにすることを目的とした．　今回の解析では，心疾患，脳血管疾患，悪性新生物の三大死因について， 1991 年から 1996 年の各年次の性別の年齢調整死亡率，年齢階級別死亡率， 18 地域別の表示化死亡比（SMR:Standardized mortality rations）を算出し，比較した．　 1991 年から 1996 年の 6 年間の死亡総数は 303, 737 人で，そのうち 63. 7 %を三大死因が占めている．その期間の心疾患と悪性新生物の年齢調整死亡率は年々減少したが，脳血管疾患の年齢調整死亡率は男女ともほぼ横ばいであった．また，脳血管疾患や悪性心疾患のSMRは地域格差が認められ，これは，前回報告した 1995 年の結果と同様であった．　今回の研究から，天津市の 90 年代の慢性非伝染病疾患の予防効果は特に脳血管疾患については，少なく，今後，死亡率の高い地域を中心とした介入が重要であると考えられた．また，今回の 6 年間の三大死因の死亡率の年次推移と地域格差の研究結果は，天津市の衛生施策の重要な資料となると考えられた...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This report {{presents}} final 2008 data on U. S. deaths, death rates, life expectancy, infant mortality, {{and trends}} by selected {{characteristics such as}} age, sex, Hispanic origin, race, state of residence, and cause of death. Methods: Information reported on death certificates, which are completed by funeral directors, attending physicians, medical examiners, and coroners, is presented in descriptive tabulations. The original records are filed in state registration offices. Statistical information is compiled in a national database through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics. Causes of death are processed {{in accordance with the}} International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD- 10). Results: In 2008, a total of 2, 471, 984 deaths were reported in the United States. The age-adjusted death rate was 758. 3 deaths per 100, 000 standard population, a decrease of 0. 2 percent from the 2007 rate and a record low figure. Life expectancy at birth rose 0. 2 years, from 77. 9 years in 2007 to a record-high 78. 1 years in 2008. The <b>age-specific</b> <b>death</b> <b>rate</b> increased for age group 85 years and over. Age-specific death rates decreased for age groups: less than 1 year, 5 - 14, 15 - 24, 25 - 34, 35 - 44 and 65 - 74. The age-specific death rates remained unchanged for age groups: 1 - 4, 45 - 54, 55 - 64 and 75 - 84. The 15 leading causes of death in 2008 remained the same as in 2007, but Chronic lower respiratory diseases and suicide increased in the ranking while stroke and septicemia decreased in the ranking. Stroke is the fourth leading cause of death in 2008 after more than five decades at number three in the ranking. Chronic lower respiratory diseases is the third leading cause of death for 2008. The infant mortality rate decreased 2. 1 percent to a historically low value of 6. 61 deaths per 1, 000 live births in 2008. Conclusions: The decline of the age-adjusted death rate to a record low value for the United States and the increase in life expectancy to a record high value of 78. 1 years are consistent with long-term trends in mortality.

40|$|Period life {{expectancy}} is calculated from <b>age-specific</b> <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> using life table methods that are among {{the oldest and most}} fundamental tools of demography. These methods are rarely questioned, much less criticized. Yet changing age patterns of adult mortality in contemporary countries with high {{life expectancy}} provide a basis for questioning the conventional use of <b>age-specific</b> <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> and life tables. This paper argues that when the mean age at death is rising, period life expectancy at birth as conventionally calculated overestimates life expectancy. Estimates of this upward bias, ranging from 1. 6 years for the United States and Sweden to 3. 3 years for Japan for 1980 – 95, are presented. A similar bias in the opposite direction occurs when mean age at death is falling. These biases can also distort trends in life expectancy as conventionally calculated and may affect projections of future trends in period life expectancy. This material may not be reproduced without written permission from the authors. The measurement of human longevity {{is one of the oldest}} and most important topics in demography. Estimates of the life expectancy at birth (i. e., the average age at death under current mortality conditions) are now routinely provided by national an...|$|R

30|$|The {{life table}} model, which {{describes}} the current mortality profile {{in terms of}} a hypothetical survival of individuals in a synthetic cohort, is an important tool in studying mortality and its many implications such as insurance policies, social policies, and population projections (Chiang 1978; Preston et al. 2001). It builds upon <b>age-specific</b> <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> and produces various indicators of mortality, survival, and longevity for the age groups. A limitation of the model appears at the older ages where data scarcity or deficiency forces statisticians to disregard age details and aggregate the available data into a single “open age interval” (Missov et al. 2016).|$|R
2500|$|The <b>age-specific</b> <b>death</b> <b>rates</b> are {{calculated}} separately for separate groups {{of data that}} {{are believed to have}} different mortality rates (such as males and females, and perhaps smokers and non-smokers if data are available separately for those groups) and are then used to calculate a life table from which one can calculate the probability of surviving to each age. In actuarial notation, the probability of surviving from age [...] to age [...] is denoted [...] and the probability of dying during age [...] (between ages [...] and [...] ) is denoted [...] For example, if 10% of a group of people alive at their 90th birthday die before their 91st birthday, the <b>age-specific</b> <b>death</b> probability at 90 would be 10%. That is a probability, not a mortality rate.|$|R
