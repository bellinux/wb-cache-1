25|$|Wynn brought Mirage Resorts’ {{style to}} Biloxi, Mississippi in 1999, where he oversaw {{development}} of the 1,835-room Beau Rivage.

Beau Rivage was originally the name Wynn wanted to give the Bellagio, though he had decided on Bellagio after vacationing in the Italian region of the same name. Beau Rivage opened as the largest hotel-casino to be built outside Nevada.

25|$|More {{buildings}} were built {{to the west}} of the Main Building, developing the land between University Avenue and the River Kelvin with natural science buildings and the faculty of medicine. The medical school spread into neighbouring Partick and joined with the Western Infirmary. At the eastern flank of the Main Building, the James Watt Engineering Building was completed in 1959. The growth and prosperity of the city, which had originally forced the University's relocation to Hillhead, again proved problematic when more real estate was required. The school of veterinary medicine, which was founded in 1862, moved to a new campus in the leafy surrounds of Garscube Estate, around two miles (3km) west of the main campus, in 1954. The university later moved its sports ground and <b>associated</b> <b>facilities</b> to Garscube and also built student halls of residence in both Garscube and Maryhill.|$|E

The tower sat on a base with a polished marble facade. The first floor of the base contained space for retail, while the second floor featured the banking hall, bank offices and <b>associated</b> <b>facilities.</b> The Philadelphia Saving Fund Society's offices and banking hall featured custom-designed furniture, including custom Cartier clocks on every floor.

Office tenants were attracted to the tower by modern facilities such as radio receivers, and the building was also the second high-rise in the U.S. to be equipped with air conditioning. The skyscraper is topped by a red neon sign with the Philadelphia Saving Fund Society's initials (PSFS) on it. Visible for , the sign has become a Philadelphia icon.

500|$|Vanguards {{design was}} revised again, while {{the ship was}} under {{construction}} in 1942, to reflect {{lessons learned from the}} loss of the [...] battleship [...] and operations with the other battleships. The space between the inboard and outboard propeller shafts was increased from [...] to prevent a single torpedo from wrecking both shafts, and watertight access trunks were added to all spaces below the deep waterline to prevent progressive flooding through open watertight doors and hatches as happened to Prince of Wales. This change and the relocation of some of the [...] ammunition handling rooms from the lower deck to the middle deck seriously delayed the ship's completion. The design requirement that the guns of 'A' turret be capable of firing straight ahead at 0° of elevation was sacrificed to allow her freeboard forward to be increased, and her bow was reshaped to make it less prone to shipping water and throwing sea spray in head seas.
