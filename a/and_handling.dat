5|$|Although argon is non-toxic, it is 38% denser than air and {{therefore}} considered a dangerous asphyxiant in closed areas. It {{is difficult to}} detect because it is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. A 1994 incident, in which a man was asphyxiated after entering an argon-filled section of oil pipe under construction in Alaska, highlights the dangers of argon tank leakage in confined spaces and emphasizes the need for proper use, storage <b>and</b> <b>handling.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bike {{maneuverability}} <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> {{is difficult}} to quantify for several reasons. The geometry of a bike, especially the steering axis angle makes kinematic analysis complicated. Under many conditions, bikes are inherently unstable and must always be under rider control. Finally, the rider's skill has a large influence on the bike's performance in any maneuver. Bike designs tend to consist of a trade-off between maneuverability and stability.|$|E

5|$|Pumpkin {{bombs were}} {{a means of}} {{providing}} realistic training with non-nuclear bombs for the 509th Composite Group's Boeing B-29 Superfortress crews assigned to drop the atomic bomb. The pumpkin bomb had the same weight, size, and weight distribution as the Fat Man plutonium bomb, giving it the same ballistic <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> characteristics. Specifications for the bomb required that it be carried in the forward bomb bay of a Silverplate B-29 bomber and be fuzed to be effective against actual targets.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of sufficiently small and light cameras with a timer mechanism, {{and the training}} <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> of the birds to carry the necessary loads, presented major challenges, as did the limited control over the pigeons' position, orientation and speed when the photographs were being taken. In 2004, the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) used miniature television cameras attached to falcons and goshawks to obtain live footage, and today some researchers, enthusiasts and artists similarly deploy crittercams with various species of animals.|$|E

Pre-invasion plans called {{for the construction of}} three large airstrips within forty-five days of 15 September, with the first to be operational immediately after the landing. The plans also included accommodation and supply facilities for 60,000 air force and army personnel, a 1,900-bed hospital, bulk fuel storage <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> installations and ship docking facilities. To construct these facilities, the Tradewind Task Force included 7,000 engineer service troops, of whom 84 percent were American and the remainder Australian.|$|E

5|$|After U-3s {{arrival at}} Pola in January 1909, she was {{commissioned}} into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 12 September 1909 as SM U-3. During {{the evaluation of}} the U-3 class conducted by the Navy, the class' poor diving <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> characteristics were noted. To alleviate the diving problems, U-3s fins were changed in size and shape several times, and eventually, the front diving planes were removed and a stationary stern flap was affixed to the hull. U-3 served as a training boat between 1910 and 1914 and made as many as ten cruises per month in that capacity.|$|E

5|$|As an {{industrial}} process, {{the cost of}} welding {{plays a crucial role}} in manufacturing decisions. Many different variables affect the total cost, including equipment cost, labor cost, material cost, and energy cost. Depending on the process, equipment cost can vary, from inexpensive for methods like shielded metal arc welding and oxyfuel welding, to extremely expensive for methods like laser beam welding and electron beam welding. Because of their high cost, they are only used in high production operations. Similarly, because automation and robots increase equipment costs, they are only implemented when high production is necessary. Labor cost depends on the deposition rate (the rate of welding), the hourly wage, and the total operation time, including time spent fitting, welding, <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> the part. The cost of materials includes the cost of the base and filler material, and the cost of shielding gases. Finally, energy cost depends on arc time and welding power demand.|$|E
5|$|Fifteen {{characters}} are playable in Crash Team Racing, although only {{eight of them}} are playable from the start. Crash Bandicoot, the main protagonist of the series, is an all-round racer with balanced acceleration, top speed <b>and</b> <b>handling.</b> Doctor Neo Cortex, Crash's archenemy, is a mad scientist who wants to stop Nitros Oxide so that he may conquer the world himself. Like Crash, his kart is an all-round performer. Coco Bandicoot, Crash's younger sister, is a computer genius who installed computer chips into her kart to increase its acceleration prowess. Doctor N. Gin is a rocket scientist who, like Coco, added custom parts to his kart to improve its acceleration. Pura and Polar pilot karts with low speed but improved handling, allowing them to navigate tight corners. Tiny Tiger and Dingodile control karts built for top speed {{at the cost of}} turning prowess.|$|E
5|$|Four {{full-scale}} development (FSD) aircraft were constructed. The {{first of}} these (BuNo 161396), used mainly for testing performance <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> qualities, made its maiden flight on 5 November 1981, piloted by Plummer. The second and third FSD aircraft, which introduced wing leading-edge root extensions and revised engine intakes, first flew in April the following year; the fourth followed in January 1984. The first production AV-8B was delivered to the Marine Attack Training Squadron 203 (VMAT-203) at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point (MCAS Cherry Point) on 12 December 1983, and officially handed over one month later. The last of the initial batch of 12 was delivered in January 1985 to the front-line Marine Attack Squadron 331 (VMA-331). The engine used for these aircraft was the F402-RR-404A, with 21,450lb (95.4kN) of thrust; aircraft from 1990 onwards received upgraded engines.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, Roberts {{stunned the}} racing world {{when he left}} Yamaha after more than 25 years {{to start his own}} {{motorcycle}} company. Roberts had grown weary of battling over the direction he felt the Yamaha team needed to pursue. Basing his new company in England {{to take advantage of the}} Formula 1 industry, Roberts built a three-cylinder, two-stroke engine with the engineering assistance of Tom Walkinshaw Racing. He decided to take advantage of rules allowing lighter weights for three-cylinder motorcycles after observing the agility <b>and</b> <b>handling</b> advantage of Spencer's Honda NS500 during the 1983 season. Unfortunately, by the time the motorcycle had been developed, tire technology had improved to the point where any advantage over four-cylinder bikes had been negated. The motorcycle did manage to win a pole position with rider Jeremy McWilliams taking the top qualifying position at the 2002 Australian Grand Prix against the new breed of 990cc four-stroke MotoGP motorcycles.|$|E
5|$|In October 2007, Lexus {{entered the}} Specialty Equipment Market Association {{show in the}} U.S. {{for the first time}} with the IS F, and {{announced}} its F-Sport performance trim level and factory-sanctioned accessory line.

By the end of 2007, Lexus annual worldwide sales had surpassed 500,000 vehicles, and the marque ranked as the top-selling premium import in China for the first time.
