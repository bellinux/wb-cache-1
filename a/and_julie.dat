5|$|An item of {{discussion}} between the production staff was over who would rescue Rose; Davies <b>and</b> <b>Julie</b> Gardner wanted Pete to rescue her, while Clarke and Phil Collinson wanted Mickey. The role was ultimately given to Pete, to emphasise {{that he had}} accepted Rose as a surrogate daughter.

5|$|Meanwhile, Megan {{spends time}} with her {{daughter}} Lacey (Mary Mouser), who is upset about having Kate in her father's life. Megan comforts her, and Lacey reassures Megan that Kate will not replace her. Megan visits the new crime scene, investigating why Patrick Deline (Brad Standley), is found dead. On the other case, it is revealed that Martin is not the father of Julie's child, but after much evidence is checked, {{it is in fact}} Patrick, the person who was killed in Megan's case. Julie had asked his old school friend Patrick to be the father of her child, as she wanted someone that she knew. Her request made both Patrick his partner, Steve Turtell (Michael Dean Connolly) cry. The couple <b>and</b> <b>Julie</b> had not told Martin, as Martin divorced ex-wife Alexandra after Patrick introduced Julie to Martin, when he was decorating the Loeb's house. It is revealed that Alan, the financial director, killed both Patrick <b>and</b> <b>Julie.</b> Alan kept stealing from Martin, and was found out by Patrick, so he beat him to death.

5|$|Sellers {{pursued a}} film career {{and took a}} number of small roles such as a police {{inspector}} in John <b>and</b> <b>Julie</b> (1955). He accepted a larger part in the 1955 Alexander Mackendrick-directed Ealing comedy The Ladykillers in which he starred opposite Alec Guinness, Herbert Lom and Cecil Parker as Harry Robinson, the Teddy Boy; biographer Peter Evans considers this Sellers's first good role. The Ladykillers was a success in both Britain and the US, and the film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Coward {{acquired}} Goldenhurst Farm, in Aldington, Kent, {{making it}} his home {{for most of}} the next thirty years, except when the military used it during the Second World War. It is a Grade II listed building. In the 1950s, Coward left the UK for tax reasons, receiving harsh criticism in the press. He first settled in Bermuda but later bought houses in Jamaica and Switzerland (in the village of Les Avants, near Montreux), which remained his homes {{for the rest of his}} life. His expatriate neighbours and friends included Joan Sutherland, David Niven, Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor, <b>and</b> <b>Julie</b> Andrews and Blake Edwards in Switzerland and Ian Fleming and his wife Ann in Jamaica.

5|$|In 1996, a {{team led}} by David Burney {{collected}} breccias containing remains of bats and other animals from the cave of Anjohibe in northwestern Madagascar. The bats in the sample were described by Karen Samonds (previously Irwin) in her 2006 Ph.D. dissertation and a 2007 paper. She found several living species in addition to two extinct ones that she described as new, Triaenops goodmani and Hipposideros besaoka. At the time, the genus Triaenops was thought to include three species on Madagascar–Triaenops auritus, Triaenops furculus, and Triaenops rufus. Since then, Steven Goodman <b>and</b> <b>Julie</b> Ranivo have discovered that the name rufus is not in fact applicable to the Madagascar species and proposed the name Triaenops menamena for the Madagascan bats previously known as Triaenops rufus.|$|E
5|$|Kafka's parents {{probably}} spoke a German {{influenced by}} Yiddish that was sometimes pejoratively called Mauscheldeutsch, but, as the German language {{was considered the}} vehicle of social mobility, they probably encouraged their children to speak High German. Hermann <b>and</b> <b>Julie</b> had six children, of whom Franz was the eldest. Franz's two brothers, Georg and Heinrich, died in infancy before Franz was seven; his three sisters were Gabriele ("Ellie") (1889–1944), Valerie ("Valli") (1890–1942) and Ottilie ("Ottla") (1892–1943). They all died during the Holocaust of World War II. Valli was deported to the Łódź Ghetto in Poland in 1942, {{but that is the}} last documentation of her. Ottilie was his favorite sister.|$|E
5|$|On August 14, 2012, {{after the}} London Olympics, Solo {{released}} her autobiography Solo: A Memoir of Hope co-authored with sports columnist and commentator Ann Killion {{and published by}} Harper Collins.

5|$|Rivette {{was unhappy}} with La Religieuse and re-evaluated his career, {{developing}} a unique cinematic style with L'Amour fou. Influenced by the political turmoil of May 1968, improvisational theater and an in-depth interview with Jean Renoir, Rivette began working with large groups of actors on character development and allowing events to unfold on camera. This technique led to the thirteen-hour Out 1. His films of the 1970s, such as Celine <b>and</b> <b>Julie</b> Go Boating, often incorporated fantasy and were better-regarded. After attempting to make four consecutive films, however, Rivette had a nervous breakdown and his career slowed for several years, with films such as Merry-Go-Round and Le Pont du Nord being difficult productions.|$|E
5|$|Several actors of the United Kingdom and Ireland have voiced or portrayed {{characters}} {{appearing in}} the Harry Potter film series {{based on the book}} series by J. K. Rowling.

5|$|The Browns {{beat the}} Bills {{in the second}} game of the regular season. Cleveland {{dominated}} the game from beginning to end, scoring 42 points and amassing 504 total yards on offense.

End Mac Speedie caught another touchdown in the second quarter, giving the Browns three scores in a span of just 18 minutes. Buffalo scored two touchdowns of its own in the second period, however, and the score stood at 21–13 at halftime. The Browns pulled away in the second half, scoring three more unanswered touchdowns. Otto Graham ran for a score in the third period, but was taken out of the game when the Browns' lead widened. Motley ran for 136 yards on 17 carries, and Speedie matched an AAFC single-game record by recording 10 receptions for 151 yards. Despite the loss, Bills backs Vic Kulbitski <b>and</b> <b>Julie</b> Rykovich ran for 187 yards combined. The final score was 42–13.|$|E
