5|$|The {{orientation}} and placement of many structures within Ambohimanga were copied from Ambohimanga's older twin city, the rova at <b>Antananarivo,</b> which likewise embodies both traditional notions of space. The {{placement of the}} city of Ambohimanga relative to <b>Antananarivo</b> also reflects these systems. Centrally located <b>Antananarivo</b> is the nation's political capital today, and Ambohimanga to its northeast is regarded as the spiritual capital.|$|E
5|$|<b>Antananarivo</b> has {{established}} sister city agreements with four cities. The city was twinned with Yerevan, Armenia in 1981. The city is also twinned with Vorkuta, Russia; Suzhou, China; and Montreal, Quebec, Canada. A sister city relationship between <b>Antananarivo</b> and Nice, France, established in 1962, is not currently active.|$|E
5|$|<b>Antananarivo</b> is the political, economic, {{educational}} and cultural heart of Madagascar. The Presidency, National Assembly, Senate and Supreme Court are located here, as are 21 diplomatic missions and {{the headquarters of}} many national and international businesses and NGOs. <b>Antananarivo</b> also hosts {{the largest number of}} universities, nightclubs, art venues, medical services and other social service institutions of any city on the island. Several national and local sports teams, including the championship-winning national rugby team, the Makis, and several basketball and football teams, are based in <b>Antananarivo.</b>|$|E

5|$|Each {{tomb of the}} Fitomiandalana {{contained}} the bodies of early Kings of Imerina and their relatives, and was assigned a name after the principal occupant of the underlying grave. These were, in order: Andrianavalonibemihisatra (son of Andriamasinavalona and King of <b>Antananarivo,</b> five bodies), Andriamponimerina (son of Andriamasinavalona and King of <b>Antananarivo</b> {{at the time of}} future king Andrianampoinimerina's birth, three bodies), Andrianjakanavalomandimby (oldest son of Andriamasinavalona and King of <b>Antananarivo,</b> two bodies), Andriamasinavalona (great-grandson of Andrianjaka and King of Imerina, three bodies), Andriantsimitoviaminandriandehibe (grandson of Andrianjaka and King of Imerina, two bodies), Andrianjaka (founder of <b>Antananarivo</b> and King of Imerina, 12 bodies) and Andriantsitakatrandriana (son of Andrianjaka and King of Imerina, two bodies). The final tomb without a tomb house was for Andriantomponimerina (son of Andriamasinavalona and King of <b>Antananarivo)</b> and housed eight bodies.|$|E
5|$|Government {{television}} and radio broadcasting centers, and the headquarters of numerous private stations are located in <b>Antananarivo.</b> Eighty percent of households in <b>Antananarivo</b> own a radio; the medium is popular across social classes. Stations like Fenon'ny Merina appeal to Merina listeners of all ages by playing traditional and contemporary music of the highlands region. Youth-oriented stations play a blend of Western artists and Malagasy performers of Western genres, as well as fusion and coastal musical styles. Evangelical broadcasts and daily international and local news are available in Malagasy, French and English. Forty percent of <b>Antananarivo</b> residents own a television receiver. All major Malagasy newspapers are printed {{in the city and}} are widely available. Communications services in <b>Antananarivo</b> are the best in the country. Internet and mobile telephone networks are readily available and affordable, although disruptions in service occur periodically. The national postal service is headquartered in <b>Antananarivo,</b> and private international shipping companies like FedEx, DHL Express and United Parcel Service provide services to the city.|$|E
5|$|Upon Andriamasinavalona's {{death in}} 1710, Imerina split into four warring {{quadrants}} and <b>Antananarivo</b> was made {{the capital of}} the southern district. During the 77-year civil war that followed, the eastern district's capital at Ambohimanga rose in prominence. The last king of Ambohimanga, Andrianampoinimerina, successfully conquered <b>Antananarivo</b> in 1793; he reunited the provinces of Imerina, ending the civil war. He moved the kingdom's political capital back to <b>Antananarivo</b> in 1794, and declared Ambohimanga the kingdom's spiritual capital, a role it still maintains. Andrianampoinimerina created a large marketplace in Analakely, establishing the city's economic center.|$|E
5|$|<b>Antananarivo</b> is the {{administrative}} capital and largest city of Madagascar. It {{is located in}} the highlands region, near the geographic center of the island. King Andrianjaka founded <b>Antananarivo</b> as the capital of his Imerina Kingdom around 1610 or 1625 upon the site of a captured Vazimba capital on the hilltop of Analamanga. As Merina dominance expanded over neighboring Malagasy peoples in the early 19th century to establish the Kingdom of Madagascar, <b>Antananarivo</b> became the center of administration for virtually the entire island. In 1896 the French colonizers of Madagascar adopted the Merina capital as their center of colonial administration. The city remained the capital of Madagascar after regaining independence in 1960. In 2017, the capital's population was estimated at 1,391,433 inhabitants. The next largest cities are Antsirabe (500,000), Toamasina (450,000) and Mahajanga (400,000).|$|E
5|$|<b>Antananarivo</b> {{was founded}} from about 1610 to 1625, when the Merina king Andrianjaka (1612–1630) {{expelled}} the Vazimba {{inhabitants of the}} village of Analamanga at the highest meeting point of two forested ridges rising above the surrounding highland plains. Declaring it the site of his capital, Andrianjaka built a rova (fortified royal dwelling) that expanded to become the royal palaces of the Kingdom of Imerina. According to oral history, he deployed a garrison of 1,000 soldiers to capture and guard the site; the hill and its city retained the name Analamanga until the reign of King Andriamasinavalona (1675–1710), who renamed it <b>Antananarivo</b> ("City of the Thousand") in honor of Andrianjaka's soldiers. The city served as {{the capital of the}} Kingdom of Imerina from its founding until 1710, when Imerina split into four warring quadrants. <b>Antananarivo</b> was declared the capital of the southern quadrant; it remained thus until King Andrianampoinimerina of Ambohimanga captured the province and restored its role as capital of a united Kingdom of Imerina in 1794. His diplomatic and military successes extended Imerina far beyond its traditional borders, bringing the lands of neighboring ethnic groups under Merina control. These conquests were continued under his son, Radama I, whose control ultimately extended over two thirds of the island, leading him to be considered the King of Madagascar by European diplomats, with <b>Antananarivo</b> as the island's capital. <b>Antananarivo</b> remained the island's capital after Madagascar was colonized by the French in 1897 and remained thus after independence in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the conquest}} of <b>Antananarivo</b> in 1793, Andrianampoinimerina shifted the {{political}} capital of Imerina from Ambohimanga to its original site at <b>Antananarivo,</b> while pronouncing Ambohimanga the kingdom's spiritual capital. Important traditional rituals continued {{to be held at}} Ambohimanga, and Andrianampoinimerina regularly stayed in its Mahandrihono palace. His son, Radama I, inhabited Ambohimanga's Nanjakana compound as a youth before relocating to <b>Antananarivo,</b> and visited Ambohimanga frequently after the move. Radama's widow and successor, Ranavalona I, renovated the Mahandrihono compound and moved several buildings from the sister rova at <b>Antananarivo</b> to Ambohimanga. She also forbade swine at Ambohimanga due to their association with Europeans, who had propagated pork as a food source in the decade prior. Subsequent queens made their own mark on the site, including the reconstruction of Nanjakana by Rasoherina, and Ranavalona II's addition of two large pavilions to the Mahandrihono compound that reflected a syncretism of traditional and Western architectural styles.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{availability}} {{and quality of}} health care is better in <b>Antananarivo</b> than elsewhere in Madagascar, although it remains inadequate across the country relative to that in more developed countries. One of Madagascar's two medical schools is located in Antananarivo; most medical technicians and specialists are trained there. Neonatal and antenatal care is significantly better in <b>Antananarivo</b> than elsewhere on the island. Despite the presence of facilities and trained personnel, {{the high cost of}} health care places it beyond the reach of most residents of <b>Antananarivo.</b> Pharmaceuticals are imported, making them particularly unaffordable; traditional herbal medicines remain popular and are readily available in local markets frequented by most of the population.|$|E

Charle has been an advocate for the poorest neighborhoods in <b>Antananarivo</b> and in nearby rural areas, and established the CICAFE association to improve living conditions there.|$|E
5|$|Andrianjaka's {{fortified}} compound came to {{be known}} as the Rova of <b>Antananarivo</b> and constituted the heart of his newly founded city of <b>Antananarivo.</b> Prior to Andrianjaka's rule, Merina sovereigns shifted their capital from one town to another, but with the establishment of the rova on the peak of Analamanga hill, <b>Antananarivo</b> was to become the capital of the Kingdom of Imerina (and, ultimately, the 19th-century Kingdom of Madagascar) for generations of Merina sovereigns. The heart of the town was built in stages: first, the army cleared the forest covering the hill's summit and constructed the rova compound to serve as an initial garrison enclosing a traditional-style wooden house (lapa) that served as a residence for the king. Soon thereafter, two more houses were constructed; Andrianjaka also designated the construction space and design for a row of royal tombs. In keeping with Merina aristocratic tradition, each structure in the compound was given a name. The row of tombs was named Fitomiandalana ("Seven Aligned Tombs"), Andrianjaka's own tomb being the first of these constructed. According to one account, the very first royal house constructed within the Rova of <b>Antananarivo</b> was named Besakana ("Great Breadth") and served as the personal residence of Andrianjaka. This account is contradicted by another source that states the second and third houses were called Masoandrotsiroa and Besakana, with the latter again characterized as Andrianjaka's personal residence, leaving the precise origins of Besakana unclear.|$|E
5|$|Andry Rajoelina {{was born}} on 30 May 1974 to a {{relatively}} wealthy family in <b>Antananarivo.</b> His father, now-retired Colonel Roger Yves Rajoelina, held dual nationality and fought for the French army in the Algerian War. At the age of 13, Rajoelina became the 1987 junior-class national karate champion. While still in high school, Rajoelina began working as a disc jockey at parties and clubs in <b>Antananarivo</b> to earn pocket money. Although Rajoelina's family could afford a college education for their son, he opted to discontinue his studies after completing his baccalaureat to launch a career as an entrepreneur.|$|E
5|$|As the {{historic}} capital of Imerina, <b>Antananarivo</b> is centrally {{located in the}} homeland of the Merina people, who comprise about 24 {{percent of the population}} and are the largest Malagasy ethnic group. The city's history as the island's major center for politics, culture and trade has ensured a cosmopolitan mix of ethnic groups from across the island and overseas. Most <b>Antananarivo</b> residents have strong ties to their tanindrazana (ancestral village), where the extended family and typically a family tomb or burial place is located; many older residents leave the city upon retirement to return to their rural area of origin.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in January 2009, Rajoelina led {{a series}} of {{political}} rallies in downtown <b>Antananarivo</b> where he gave voice to the frustration that Ravalomanana's policies had triggered, particularly among the economically marginalized {{and members of the}} political opposition. On 3 February, Ravalomanana dismissed Rajoelina as mayor of <b>Antananarivo</b> and appointed a special delegation headed by Guy Randrianarisoa to manage the affairs of the capital. Rajoelina incited demonstrators on 7 February to occupy the president's office in Ambohitsorohitra Palace in central <b>Antananarivo.</b> The presidential guard opened fire on the advancing crowd, killing 31 and wounding more than 200. Ravalomanana became the third president since independence (after Ratsiraka and Philibert Tsiranana) to allow the defense forces to shoot at civilians; several months later, at a demonstration led by Ravalomanana supporters, Rajoelina would become the fourth president to authorize such an action. Popular disapproval of Ravalomanana intensified and polarized some in favor of his resignation, although perceptions of Rajoelina as an alternative remained mixed. Conflicts between pro-Rajoelina demonstrators and security forces continued over the following weeks, resulting in several additional deaths.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Geralda struck Madagascar {{just weeks}} after Tropical Cyclone Daisy {{affected}} the same general area.

5|$|He {{published}} his first collection of poems, La coupe de cendres ("The Cup of Ashes") in 1924; {{the same year}} he also translated twelve previously unpublished Malagasy language poems into French and published them in literary magazines, including 18° Latitude Sud in <b>Antananarivo</b> and La Vie in Paris. This publication launched him into the intellectual and cultural circles of <b>Antananarivo</b> high society, where he established himself as Madagascar's leader not only in poetry and prose, but as an esteemed journalist, art critic, translator, and writer of essays and plays.|$|E
5|$|In 1953 the French company Rochefortaise {{launched}} Société Tananarivienne d’Articles Réfrigérés (STAR) (<b>Antananarivo</b> Company of Refrigerated Products) and {{its associated}} factory in <b>Antananarivo,</b> Madagascar, for the exclusive production and distribution of Coca-Cola in Madagascar. In 1957, a brewer was recruited to develop a local beer. After developing 17 different recipes, he travelled throughout the island to test each one using primarily local ingredient; {{the best of these}} was a pilsener chosen as the recipe to be produced at a Star brewery to be established in Antsirabe. The company first began producing Three Horses Beer (THB) in 1958.|$|E
5|$|On 18 November 2006, Ravalomanana's jet {{was forced}} to divert from Madagascar's capital during a return trip from Europe {{following}} reports of a coup underway in <b>Antananarivo</b> and shooting near the airport. The attempted coup was ultimately unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Philibert Rabezoza {{was born}} in 1923 in Ankadinandriana, a suburb of <b>Antananarivo.</b> His mother {{was born in}} <b>Antananarivo</b> and his father, a {{herdsman}} and farmer from Fianarantsoa, had previously been a singer at the Merina royal court before the colonization of Madagascar in 1897. Both of Philibert's parents were already aged {{at the time of}} his birth and they struggled to care for their new son alongside his six brothers and four sisters. As a child, Philibert assisted his family with looking after the livestock and farming their plot of land. In his early years he was given the nickname Rakoto by an older brother of the same name.|$|E
5|$|The Lycée Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo {{was inaugurated}} in central <b>Antananarivo</b> on 21 December 1946 {{in honor of}} the poet. A room has been {{dedicated}} to the poet in the National Library of Madagascar, located in the capital city.|$|E
5|$|The band's {{popularity}} {{continued to}} grow over the coming years. As the younger band members completed their high school studies, they performed frequent concerts in <b>Antananarivo,</b> staying overnight in the student dorms with Raoul and Nono. Fafa moved to <b>Antananarivo</b> the shortly afterward {{to live with his}} parents, and the band often gathered at his family's home, where they composed many of their early songs. As each of the younger boys passed their baccalaureat, they moved to <b>Antananarivo</b> to continue their studies at the university, which they paid through a combination of state subsidies and the profits from their concerts. Political party representatives often approached band members to request them to become official supporters and party members, but the band preferred to remain politically independent.Another young and emerging group, Lolo sy ny Tariny, was recruited by the political party MFM, who attempted to pit the two groups against each other. Although there were occasional arguments between Bekoto and members of Lolo sy ny Tariny that garnered publicity, the band remained largely above political disputes.|$|E
5|$|The large {{population}} in <b>Antananarivo</b> {{and the high}} density of its residential zones pose challenges to public health, sanitation and access to clean drinking water. Processing and disposal of industrial and residential waste is inadequate. Waste water is often discharged directly into the city's waterways. Air pollution from vehicle exhausts, residential coal-burning stoves and other sources is worsening. While the city has set up clean water pumps, they remain inadequate and are not distributed according to population density, worsening access in the poorest and most populous parts of the city. <b>Antananarivo</b> {{is one of the}} two urban areas in Madagascar where bubonic plague is endemic.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} Rova as a seat {{of power}} for the Kingdom of Imerina changed when Andriamasinavalona chose to divide the kingdom into four provinces ruled by his {{favourite}} sons. <b>Antananarivo</b> became {{the capital of the}} southern Imerina province with the Rova as its seat of government. The site retained this role until the late 18th century, when King Andrianampoinimerina (1787–1810) of Ambohimanga led a series of attacks beginning in 1792 that culminated in the capture of <b>Antananarivo</b> and its incorporation into the newly reunified Kingdom of Imerina.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{his fellow}} band members, Fafa – born 13 May 1954 in Ampasamadinika, a {{neighborhood}} of <b>Antananarivo</b> – has based his career entirely around singing. He {{was raised in a}} musical family: his father played mandolin and his mother enjoyed singing. Fafa began playing guitar at the age of nine and sang along with popular European and American artists on the radio, including Harry Belafonte, Claude François and Mike Brant. Fafa discontinued his studies after the 1972 rotaka and returned with his wife and son (born in 1973) to live with his parents in <b>Antananarivo.</b> There he obtained a position at the Ministry of Transportation, becoming the first salaried member of the group. For the first three decades of his career, Fafa often recorded and performed in collaboration with other artists and groups. He released his first solo album in 2008 to strong sales across Madagascar. In the late 1990s Fafa led a successful campaign to increase access to public latrines in the impoverished <b>Antananarivo</b> neighborhood of Isotry.|$|E
5|$|A {{national}} museum {{dedicated to the}} Uprising was inaugurated in 2012 by President Andry Rajoelina at Moramanga, 100 kilometers east of <b>Antananarivo.</b> The town {{has long been the}} site of the national monument to the conflict, as well as a mausoleum at the town entrance near Ampanihifana containing the remains of an estimated 2,500 local nationalists killed in the conflict.|$|E
5|$|A {{native of}} Antsirabe, Nono {{was born on}} 21 September 1952. He {{completed}} his studies in surgical medicine in Switzerland on a scholarship from the Helvetic Confederation before returning {{to work as a}} surgeon in the university hospital in <b>Antananarivo.</b> He died of cancer on 29 August 2014.|$|E
5|$|After Andrianampoinimerina reunited {{the divided}} and warring Kingdom of Imerina, he {{successfully}} pursued an expansionist policy that saw his authority extended {{over a large}} portion of Madagascar by {{the time of his death}} in 1810. Having captured <b>Antananarivo</b> by 1793 and transferred his capital from Ambohimanga to <b>Antananarivo</b> the following year, Andrianampoinimerina established new structures on the Rova grounds that would become imbued with the political and historic significance of his reign. In keeping with the tradition of Merina sovereigns before him, each building was assigned a name by which it could be distinguished. Several of the buildings were used interchangeably by the king as personal residences, including Manjakamiadana ("Where It is Pleasant to Rule"), Besakana, Manatsaralehibe ("Vast Improvement", also called Manatsara)—which he alone was authorised to enter—and Marivolanitra ("Beneath the Heavens"), a building reportedly designed with a staircase leading to a rooftop observation deck from which the king could observe the town and plains below.|$|E
5|$|<b>Antananarivo</b> was {{historically}} {{the capital}} of the Merina people, who continue to form the majority of the city's estimated 1,300,000 (2013) inhabitants, as well as the surrounding urban areas which in all have a total metropolitan population approaching three million. All 18 Malagasy ethnic groups, as well as residents of Chinese, Indian, European and other origins, are well represented in the city.|$|E
5|$|At {{least two}} {{buildings}} were transported {{in their entirety}} onto or away from the Rova compound during Andrianampoinimerina's reign. Miandrivola ("Guarding Money") was moved from Ambohidrano to the Rova compound, where it was inhabited {{by one of the}} king's wives, Rafaravavy. The king also had Manatsara removed from <b>Antananarivo</b> to Ambohidrabiby.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{advanced}} sports facilities, <b>Antananarivo</b> {{gained the}} hosting rights for several of Africa's top international basketball events, including the 2011 FIBA Africa Championship, the 2009 FIBA Africa Championship for Women, the 2014 FIBA Africa Under-18 Championship, the 2013 FIBA Africa Under-16 Championship, and the 2015 FIBA Africa Under-16 Championship for Women.|$|E
5|$|On August 16, 1861, Ranavalona died in {{her sleep}} at the Manjakamiadana palace in the Rova of <b>Antananarivo.</b> Twelve {{thousand}} zebu were slaughtered and their meat distributed to the populace in her honor, and the official mourning period lasted nine months. Her body was laid in a coffin made of silver piastres in a tomb at the royal city of Ambohimanga. During her funeral, a spark accidentally ignited a nearby barrel of gunpowder destined {{for use in the}} ceremony, causing an explosion and fire that killed a number of bystanders and destroyed three historic royal residences in the Nanjakana section of the compound where the event was held. In 1897, French colonial authorities disinterred and moved the queen's body and the remains of other Merina sovereigns to the tombs at the Rova of <b>Antananarivo</b> in an attempt to desanctify Ambohimanga. Her bones were placed within the tomb of Queen Rasoherina. Her son, Prince Rakoto, succeeded her as King Radama II.|$|E
5|$|Rakoto Frah died on 29 September 2001 in the Ravoahangy Andrianavalona {{hospital}} of <b>Antananarivo</b> following heart problems and a lung infection. In {{the days following}} his death, the Malagasy government organized a public celebration in his honor at Mahamasina stadium. His body was laid in the family tomb in his home village of Ankadinandriana on 3October.|$|E
5|$|The French {{military}} invaded <b>Antananarivo</b> in September 1894, {{prompting the}} queen's surrender after a cannon shell blasted {{a hole through}} a building at the Rova, causing major casualties. The damage was never repaired. Andohalo square was remodeled to feature a gazebo, walkways and planted landscaping. Claiming the island as a colony, the French administration retained <b>Antananarivo</b> as its capital and transcribed its name as Tananarive. They chose Antaninarenina as {{the site for the}} French Governor General's Residency; upon independence it was renamed Ambohitsorohitra Palace and converted into presidential offices. Under the French, tunnels were constructed through two of the city's largest hills, connecting disparate districts and facilitating the town's expansion. Streets were laid with cobblestones and later paved; sewer systems and electricity infrastructure were introduced. Water, previously obtained from springs {{at the foot of the}} hill, was brought from the Ikopa River.|$|E
