5|$|Chinese {{immigrants}} to the Indonesian archipelago almost entirely originated from ethnic Han groups of what <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> Fujian and Guangdong provinces in southern China, areas known for their regional diversity. Large numbers of Han Chinese, the largest ethnic group in the world, live in Southeast Asia. Nearly all Chinese Indonesians are either patrilineal descendants of these early immigrants, or new immigrants born in mainland China.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the dam, the entrances to the two outer diversion tunnels were sealed at the opening and halfway through the tunnels with large concrete plugs. The downstream halves of the tunnels following the inner plugs <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> main bodies of the spillway tunnels. The inner diversion tunnels were plugged at approximately one-third of their length, beyond which they now carry steel pipes connecting the intake towers to the power plant and outlet works. The inner tunnels' outlets are equipped with gates that can be closed to drain the tunnels for maintenance.|$|E
5|$|Most churches {{prior to}} the Reformation had painted walls, often with murals; these were {{whitewashed}} by the reformers, and often religious texts or the Ten Commandments replaced the images. These inscriptions were in turn obliterated under the Catholic Queen Mary. At Blakeney, as elsewhere, the formerly coloured walls <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> plain white typical of English churches.|$|E
5|$|Shrewsbury {{is home to}} Shrewsbury School, {{a public}} school, on a large site ("Kingsland") {{just south of the}} town centre {{overlooking}} the loop of the Severn.

5|$|The {{kingdom of}} East Anglia, (also {{known as the}} kingdom of the East Angles), was a small {{independent}} Anglo-Saxon kingdom that comprised what <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> English counties of Norfolk and Suffolk and perhaps {{the eastern part of the}} Fens. The kingdom was one of the seven traditional members of the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy. The East Angles were initially ruled (from the 6th century until 749) by members of the Wuffingas dynasty, named after Wuffa, whose name means 'descendants of the wolf'. The last king was Guthrum II, who ruled in the 10th century.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} a number of {{documented}} cases in which a female shark who has not been in contact with a male has conceived a sharklet on her own through parthenogenesis. The details of this process are not well understood, but genetic fingerprinting showed that the sharklets had no paternal genetic contribution, ruling out sperm storage. The extent of this behavior in the wild is unknown, as is whether other species have this capability. Mammals <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> only major vertebrate group in which asexual reproduction has not been observed.|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosauroidea (meaning 'tyrant lizard forms') is a {{superfamily}} (or clade) of coelurosaurian theropod dinosaurs {{that includes}} the family Tyrannosauridae {{as well as more}} basal relatives. Tyrannosauroids lived on the Laurasian supercontinent beginning in the Jurassic Period. By the end of the Cretaceous Period, tyrannosauroids were the dominant large predators in the Northern Hemisphere, culminating in the gigantic Tyrannosaurus itself. Fossils of tyrannosauroids have been recovered on what <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> continents of North America, Europe, Asia, South America and Australia.|$|E

The League of Ireland was founded in 1921 and its Premier Division <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> top level division.|$|R
5|$|Although Texas {{eventually}} adopted {{much of the}} Anglo-American legal system, many Spanish legal {{practices were}} retained. Among these was the Spanish model of keeping certain personal property safe from creditors. Texas implemented the first homestead exemption in the United States in 1839, and its property exemption laws <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> most liberal state in the United States. Furthermore, Spanish law maintained that both husband and wife should share equally in the profits of marriage, and, like many other former Spanish provinces, Texas retained the idea of community property rather than use the Anglo laws in which all property belonged to the husband. Furthermore, Spanish law allowed an independent executor to be named in probate cases who {{is not required to}} gain court permission for each act not explicitly listed in the testament. Texas retained this idea, and it has eventually spread to other states, included Arizona, Washington, and Idaho. In other legal matters, Texas kept the Spanish principle of adoption, becoming the first U.S. state to allow adoption.|$|E
5|$|Extinction is the {{disappearance}} of an entire species. Extinction is not an unusual event, as species regularly appear through speciation and disappear through extinction. Nearly all animal and plant species that have lived on Earth are now extinct, and extinction {{appears to be the}} ultimate fate of all species. These extinctions have happened continuously throughout the history of life, although the rate of extinction spikes in occasional mass extinction events. The Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, during which the non-avian dinosaurs became extinct, is the most well-known, but the earlier Permian–Triassic extinction event was even more severe, with approximately 96% of all marine species driven to extinction. The Holocene extinction event is an ongoing mass extinction associated with humanity's expansion across the globe over the past few thousand years. Present-day extinction rates are 100–1000 times greater than the background rate and up to 30% of current species may be extinct by the mid 21st century. Human activities <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> primary cause of the ongoing extinction event; global warming may further accelerate it in the future.|$|E
5|$|Many {{plants and}} animals have been {{introduced}} to Newfoundland, either by chance or deliberately. Moose, snowshoe hare, American red squirrel, eastern chipmunk, and masked shrew, and others, {{were brought to the}} island through specific wildlife mandates. Moose were introduced in 1904 and <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> dominant ungulate on the island. An unusual experiment conducted in 1964 involved relocating a small herd of bison onto Brunette Island in Fortune Bay. The last of these animals is thought to have died by 1994. Rats and mice were unintentionally introduced while mink escaped from fur farms. Coyotes are a very recent addition to the fauna of Newfoundland. How coyotes got onto the island is still debated by wildlife officials, but it is probable that they crossed the ice from Cape Breton Island in the 1980s. Newfoundland has no native amphibians, but frogs were introduced onto the island in the 1860s and toads almost a century later.|$|E
50|$|The name Bant {{is derived}} from the estates of Bant or Bantega, which at one point existed in what <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> {{municipality}} of Lemsterland, and extended into <b>the</b> area that <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> Noordoostpolder.|$|R

5|$|Originally, {{the prince}} wanted a {{strictly}} Classical design, {{and plans for}} such a design were executed, in Chester by architect Thomas Harrison and modified, on site, by Odessa architect Francesco Boffo. The two architects had previously worked together on the design for Vorontsov's official residence in Odessa. Harrison's plans for he palace at Alupka show a classical villa {{on the site of}} the present palace's corps de logis with bedroom floors below, on what <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> lower terraces of the present palace. On the garden front, facing the sea, the plans show a large double height classical exedra; Vorontsov must have approved of this concept as it was the only feature (albeit transformed to an Islamic style), to be incorporated from Harrison's plans into the new plans.|$|E
5|$|The Oregon Supreme Court traces {{its roots}} {{back to the}} early {{settlement}} period of Oregon Country. In 1841, pioneer Ewing Young died without an heir or will in the unorganized lands of what <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> states of Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. In February of that year, settlers met at Champoeg to discuss the creation of a government, including a judiciary to deal with the execution of Young’s estate. Although the overall government plans fell through, the group of pioneers and mountain men did elect a Supreme Judge to exercise probate powers. The first judge was Dr. Ira L. Babcock, serving from February 18, 1841, to May 1, 1843.|$|E
5|$|The first church {{built on}} the cathedral site also had a tabernacle, but its exact {{location}} is unknown. During {{the construction of the}} cathedral, the tabernacle was housed in what <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> Chapels of San Isidro and Our Lady of Agony of Granada. However, in the 18thcentury, it was decided to build a structure that was separate, but still connected, to the main cathedral. It is constructed of tezontle (a reddish porous volcanic rock) and white stone {{in the shape of a}} Greek cross with its southern facade faces the Zócalo. It is connected to the main cathedral via the Chapel of San Isidro.|$|E

50|$|Columbus Senior High School was {{established}} in 1875 at what <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> current Columbus Middle School at 200 West School Street. In 1958, the school district expanded and built what <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> current high school at 1164 Farnham Street.|$|R
50|$|The route was {{subsequently}} realigned several times, {{most notably the}} original Ojai Freeway in southern Ventura which <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> modern State Route 33 freeway, and the expressway bypass of eastern Taft which <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> modern State Route 119 expressway.|$|R
5|$|The first {{portion of}} I-97 proper to be {{constructed}} was the section south of Millersville, which was placed {{under construction in}} three sections in March 1985. The first section of the highway, from US 50 and US 301 to Millersville Road west of the MD 178 interchange, opened in December 1987. Construction of I-97 from Millersville Road to the intersection of MD 3 and MD 178 at Dorrs Corner started in July 1987. The Interstate through Millersville opened in April 1989. The interchange at I-97's southern terminus was originally constructed as a partial interchange, with I-97 tying into what <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> collector-distributor lanes of US 50 and US 301. The ramps from eastbound US 50 and US 301 to I-97 and from I-97 to the westbound U.S. Highways were added during the reconstruction of US 50 and US 301 in 1992 and 1993.|$|E
5|$|The {{geography}} of Scotland in the Middle Ages covers {{all aspects of}} the land that is now Scotland, including physical and human, between the departure of the Romans in the early fifth century from what <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> southern borders of the country, to the adoption of the major aspects of the Renaissance in the early sixteenth century. Scotland was defined by its physical geography, with its long coastline of inlets, islands and inland lochs, high proportion of land over 60 metres above sea level and heavy rainfall. It is divided between the Highlands and Islands and Lowland regions, which were subdivided by geological features including fault lines, mountains, hills, bogs and marshes. This made communications by land problematic and raised difficulties for political unification, but also for invading armies.|$|E
5|$|The {{magistrates court}} {{continued}} to cover significant trials that were widely {{reported by the}} media. In 1963, Christine Keeler was tried here for attempting to obstruct the course of justice. In the late 1960s, a number of rock stars, including The Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Brian Jones, stood trial on drugs offences at the magistrates court. Richards was tried here again in 1973 for possession of heroin and owning unlicensed firearms, but was only fined £205 (now £). John Lennon and Yoko Ono were tried for obscenity here in 1970. The building became Grade II listed in 1970. The courts closed in 1998, and <b>are</b> <b>now</b> <b>the</b> Courthouse Hotel.|$|E
