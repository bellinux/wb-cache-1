50|$|In Japan, the {{handheld}} {{has been}} released in four colors and styles each. The four colors are black, blue, purple, and silver. The Game Boy Micro also has four limited edition styles: one based on the original Famicom video game console's controller, a blue bodied model with <b>a</b> <b>faceplate</b> based on Final Fantasy IV, a red bodied and red faced edition {{for the release of}} the game Mother 3, and a red bodied model with a black faceplate containing the silhouette of the iconic Pikachu from the Pokémon franchise.|$|E
5000|$|Cheater plugs were {{previously}} available {{with a short}} flexible grounding wire rather than a screw tab. This allows use of the second duplex outlet {{that does not have}} <b>a</b> <b>faceplate</b> screw in the correct location for the screw tab. The grounding wire would be wrapped around the adapter to reach the faceplate screw. However, this ground-wire style of cheater plug was discontinued when it was noted that a loose unattached grounding wire could by accident become inserted into the [...] "hot" [...] blade socket of a nearby outlet, potentially leading to electrocution.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: An {{older and}} larger 4 jaw chuck. Note {{how it is}} able to grip an irregularly cut piece of used metal. Though not found on small chucks it is common for larger chucks (the one in the second photo was made around 1900 and is 24" [...] in diameter) to have many of the {{features}} of <b>a</b> <b>faceplate.</b> The jaws are stepped on one side and full height for gripping on the other and are reversible. Generally the jaws are usable for holding either outside as shown here, or inside as in gripping the inside of a pipe.|$|E
5000|$|Sheets of PMMA are {{commonly}} used in the sign industry to make flat cut out letters in thicknesses typically varying from 3 to 25 mm. These letters may be used alone to represent a company's name and/or logo, {{or they may be}} a component of illuminated channel letters. Acrylic is also used extensively throughout the sign industry as a component of wall signs where it may be a backplate, painted on the surface or the backside, <b>a</b> <b>faceplate</b> with additional raised lettering or even photographic images printed directly to it, or a spacer to separate sign components.|$|E

50|$|For certain {{specialist}} jobs, temporary {{or special}} faceplates can be made, perhaps in wood or light alloy, {{that can be}} machined or adapted for difficult workholding jobs. One example might be attaching thin sheet metal to <b>a</b> wooden <b>faceplate</b> using woodscrews, allowing the trepanning of holes, with the tool cutting into the sacrificial faceplate material.|$|R
50|$|Snorkelers {{normally}} {{wear the}} same kind of mask as those worn by scuba divers. By creating an airspace, the mask enables the snorkeler to see clearly underwater. All scuba diving masks consist of the lenses also known as <b>a</b> <b>faceplate,</b> a soft rubber skirt, which encloses the nose and seals against the face, and a head strap to hold it in place. There are different styles and shapes. These range from oval shaped models to lower internal volume masks and may be made from different materials; common choices are silicone and rubber. A snorkeler who remains at the surface can use swimmer's goggles which do not enclose the nose.|$|E
50|$|Lathes {{are used}} in woodturning, metalworking, metal spinning, thermal spraying, parts reclamation, and glass-working. Lathes {{can be used to}} shape pottery, the best-known design being the potter's wheel. Most {{suitably}} equipped metalworking lathes {{can also be used to}} produce most solids of revolution, plane surfaces and screw threads or helices. Ornamental lathes can produce three-dimensional solids of incredible complexity. The workpiece is usually held in place by either one or two centers, at least one of which can typically be moved horizontally to accommodate varying workpiece lengths. Other work-holding methods include clamping the work about the axis of rotation using a chuck or collet, or to <b>a</b> <b>faceplate,</b> using clamps or dogs.|$|E
50|$|Incremental {{sheet forming}} (or ISF, {{also known as}} Single Point Forming) is a sheet metal forming {{technique}} where a sheet is formed into the final workpiece {{by a series of}} small incremental deformations. However, studies have shown that it can be applied to polymer and composite sheets too. Generally, the sheet is formed by a round tipped tool, typically 5 to 20mm in diameter. The tool, which can be attached to a CNC machine, a robot arm or similar, indents into the sheet by about 1 mm and follows a contour for the desired part. It then indents further and draws the next contour for the part into the sheet and continues to do this until the full part is formed. ISF can be divided into variants depending on the number of contact points between tool, sheet and die (in case there is any). The term Single Point Incremental Forming (SPIF) is used when {{the opposite side of the}} sheet is supported by <b>a</b> <b>faceplate</b> and Two Point Incremental Forming (TPIF) when a full or partial die supports the sheet.|$|E
50|$|<b>A</b> lathe <b>faceplate</b> is <b>a</b> basic {{workholding}} accessory for a wood {{or metal}} turning lathe. It is a circular metal (usually cast iron) plate which fixes {{to the end}} of the lathe spindle. The workpiece is then clamped to the faceplate, typically using t-nuts in slots in the faceplate, or less commonly threaded holes in the faceplate itself.|$|R
50|$|Like Optimus Prime, in robot mode, Wheeljack has <b>a</b> {{retractable}} <b>faceplate</b> that {{he wears}} in combat, which when covering his face makes him resemble G1 Wheeljack, {{along with his}} vehicle mode. However, unlike previous incarnations, he {{is not only an}} inventor, but he is shown to be a handy mechanical engineer (being able to repair the Jackhammer and Ultra Magnus's ship).|$|R
25|$|This gag has two mouthguards, {{similar to}} those worn by {{football}} and hockey players. One rests on the lower teeth of the wearer while the other is against the top. Again, like sports mouthguards, these mouthguards can be softened in boiling water to fit {{to the mouth of}} the wearer. The mouthguards are attached to <b>a</b> front <b>faceplate,</b> like most plug gags, and straps from the front to the back.|$|R
5000|$|The best-known Steinberger {{design is}} the L-series instrument, {{sometimes}} described as {{shaped like a}} broom, boat oar, or cricket bat. Initially produced as an electric bass and later as a guitar, the instrument was made entirely of the Steinberger Blend, a [...] "proprietary" [...] graphite and carbon-fiber mix in two pieces: the main body and <b>a</b> <b>faceplate</b> (the [...] "blend" [...] being an off-the-shelf carbon fiber [...] "system" [...] from the DuPont product line). The headstock was eliminated, the tuning hardware instead installed on a tailpiece mounted to {{the face of the}} guitar body. The tuners utilized a finer than normal 18:1 gear ratio, with 40 threads per inch, which gave slower but more precise adjustment and helped reduce string slippage. Depending on the tailpiece, calibrated or uncalibrated double-ball end strings were used, the former required to use the transposing feature of the TransTrem vibrato unit. The rationale for the overall design was the elimination of unnecessary weight, especially the unbalanced headstock, and the use of modern materials, such as graphite, for their advantages over wood.|$|E
5000|$|Easterlings are not {{featured}} {{greatly in}} The Lord of the Rings film trilogy. They {{can be seen}} marching when Frodo and Sam come to the Black Gate in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers {{and in a few}} quick scenes in The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (they can be spotted both on foot and horseback among the Mordor forces that penetrate Minas Tirith). Gandalf does not mention them by name when he tells Pippin of men allied with Sauron (although they were mentioned in a conversation involving Faramir's briefing in Ithilien when consulting the map). On screen, the Easterlings wear lamellar often covering the middle of the chest and the full stomach with a neck plate and a wok-like helmet with three crests and <b>a</b> <b>faceplate,</b> rerebraces, vambraces, cuisses, poleyns, finger-scales, hand-plates, and thumb-scales. Also, they are armed with halberds with the hook below the ax head, scimitars and bronze scutums. Their armour is inscribed with a script which resembles Tengwar mixed with Persian. The clothing they wear is a dull-violet headscarf, tunic, trousers, robe-skirt (comes to knees), red gloves, black boots, and a black facecloth. There is a sculpture at Weta Workshop of an Easterling with a long bow and a fanned-out quiver of arrows. In early design concepts, the Easterlings wore turbans and their helmets bore crescent moons, an appearance that heavily resembled medieval Arabian dress, but director Peter Jackson requested that obvious representation of real-world cultures be avoided. [...] In The Two Towers they carry scarlet standards marked with a black serpent. In the book this emblem is attributed to the Haradrim, and in The Return of the King, flags with this design (and the eye of Sauron) adorn the Mûmakil.|$|E
5000|$|The {{crowning}} attire of the taupou or manaia was {{the traditional}} headdress {{known as the}} [...] "tuiga." [...] Coconut midribs ("tuaniu") wrapped with strips of tapa cloth were secured to <b>a</b> <b>faceplate</b> ("lave") made of turtle shell {{in such a way}} that the midribs stood upright when the faceplate was tied to the hair above the forehead; the hair was pulled upward into a tight topknot called the [...] "foga" [...] which was then tightly wrapped with tapa into a stiff cone to which the faceplate was tied. The earliest mention of [...] "tuiga" [...] refers to a headdress that was made with an intricately carved vertical [...] "comb" [...] called a [...] "selu tuiga" [...] (literally, [...] "standing up comb"); this teeth of the [...] "selu" [...] were stuck into the hair at the base of the [...] "foga," [...] to which coconut midribs and long tropicbird ("tava'e") feathers were attached. This seems to be the form of the most ancient [...] "tuiga" [...] before the [...] "selu" [...] comb and [...] "tava'e" [...] feathers were replaced by the mother of pearl shell [...] "lave" [...] and [...] "sega" [...] feathers, that has now been supplanted by mirrors, sequins and dyed chicken feathers. The second component of the tuiga was the [...] "pale fuiono," [...] literally [...] "the headband of nautilus shells," [...] made of rows of pearlized nautilus shells tied to a woven headband. Often two or more [...] "pale fuiono" [...] were tied around the wearer's forehead. The third component was the hair ornament, essentially a large wig fashioned from the hair of female relatives. The hair was washed in salt water and dyed with coral lime and citrus juice to give the hair a reddish-brown color, and the strands were tied together to form the [...] "ie lau'ulu" [...] which was tied to the top of the cone that the [...] "lave" [...] faceplate was tied to. The last piece of the tuiga was the [...] "ie'ula" [...] (literally, [...] "red dress") which consisted of strands of tiny red collared lory feathers. Today, the 'ie'ula is generally made of large colorful chicken feathers that are dyed any variety of hues besides the traditional red and white. Modern tuiga headbands also stray from the original design and the use of real [...] "fuiono" [...] nautilus shells is almost obsolete, even in Samoa, where the headband replicas are now fashioned with non-traditional materials such as sequins, rhinestones, and common shells such as cowries. Furthermore, the traditional multi-piece tuiga is almost never seen, having been almost completely replaced with modern one-piece replicas that resemble tall hats, complete with velcro flaps that wrap around the head and attach in the back. This contemporary version of the ancient tuiga also uses materials that were never used traditionally, such as glass mirrors, faux jewels and pearls, plastic mesh and chicken feathers. The one-piece construction and gawdy decorations of most modern tuiga are a far cry from the stately, natural multi-piece tuiga of old Samoa.|$|E
25|$|A new flying Batmobile design {{appears in}} Batman Beyond {{used by the}} new Batman (Terry McGinnis). This version of the vehicle made {{multiple}} appearances {{in the future of}} the DC Universe as flying cars were shown as commonplace technology in this future. This design is a radical departure from the usual style of Batmobiles, as they usually have a bat motif, from <b>a</b> bat <b>faceplate</b> on the grill, to tail fins resembling bat wings.|$|R
5000|$|In September 2004, BT Wholesale {{removed the}} line-length/loss limits for 500 kbit/s ADSL, instead {{employing}} a tactic of [...] "suck it and see" [...] — enabling the line, then seeing if ADSL would work on it. This sometimes includes {{the installation of}} <b>a</b> filtered <b>faceplate</b> on the customer's master socket, so as to eliminate poor quality telephone extension cables inside the customer's premises {{which can be a}} source of high frequency noise.|$|R
40|$|A {{real-time}} {{charged particle}} beam probe was developed, {{which can be}} used both as a beam diagnostic (beam tuning) and to quantitatively determine the three-dimensional density distribution of a beam. The probe consists of a microchannel plate, an aluminized phosphor screen deposited on <b>a</b> fiber-optic <b>faceplate,</b> <b>a</b> flexible fiber-optic bundle, and a charge injection device (CID) in tandem. Digital or analog video output of the CID is fed into a computer or oscilloscope, respectively, for analysis or observation. The probe can be moved continuously along the beams' paths to obtain 'pictures' of the beam at any desired interval, thus giving three-dimensional form factors. The beams, singly or simultaneously, may be observed on the monitor facilitating the task of beam adjustment for optimum overlap. The digital output is used for quantitative computation of the beam overlaps. The device is linear with beam intensity, but the performance degrades with time due to beam damage of the microchannel plate...|$|R
