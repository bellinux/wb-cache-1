5|$|A {{significant}} portion of Gyeongju's tourist traffic {{is due to the}} city's promotion of itself as <b>a</b> <b>site</b> <b>for</b> various festivals, conferences, and competitions. Every year since 1962, the Silla cultural festival has been held in October to celebrate and honour the dynasty's history and culture. It {{is one of the major}} festivals of Korea. It features athletic events, folk games, music, dance, literary contests and Buddhist religious ceremonies. Other festivals include the Cherry Blossom Marathon in April, the Korean Traditional Liquor and Cake festival in March, and memorial ceremonies for the founders of the Silla Dynasty and General Kim Yu-sin.|$|E

5|$|<b>A</b> <b>site</b> <b>for</b> {{a church}} {{had been set}} aside on the estate from the outset, and in 1884 Plumbe {{submitted}} designs for a church and mission hall. The mission hall opened in March 1885 with room for 350, and soon began to suffer from overcrowding. The people of Noel Park started a fund {{to pay for the}} church, which was consecrated on 1 November 1889 as St Mark's.|$|E
5|$|Bishop Maurice oversaw early preparations, {{although}} it was primarily under his successor, Richard de Beaumis, that construction work fully commenced. Beaumis was assisted by King Henry I, who gave the bishop stone and commanded that all material brought up the River Fleet for the cathedral should be free from toll. To fund the cathedral, Henry gave Beaumis rights to all fish caught within the cathedral neighbourhood and tithes on venison taken in the County of Essex. Beaumis also gave <b>a</b> <b>site</b> <b>for</b> the original foundation of St Paul's School.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes {{agree on}} <b>a</b> <b>site</b> <b>for</b> a nest, and both will defend the site. During this time, the male {{continues}} {{to feed the}} female. Mating occurs shortly after this. Breeding takes place in colonies on coasts, islands and occasionally inland on tundra near water. It often forms mixed flocks with the common tern. It lays from one to three eggs per clutch, most often two.|$|E

5|$|Brean Down is <b>a</b> <b>site</b> <b>for</b> {{the nationally}} rare white rock-rose (Helianthemum apenninum), which occurs in {{abundance}} {{on the upper}} reaches of the grassy south-facing slopes. Some of the broomrapes growing near Bridgwater Bay, which were originally thought to be oxtongue broomrape (Orobanche artemisiae-campestriae), are now no longer believed to be this species, but atypical specimens of ivy broomrape (Orobanche hederae) Other plants on the southern slopes include the Somerset hair grass, wild thyme, horseshoe vetch and birds-foot-trefoil. The northern side is dominated by bracken, bramble, privet, hawthorn, cowslips and bell heather.|$|E
5|$|Director Harry Morris {{identified}} <b>a</b> <b>site</b> <b>for</b> a {{new ground}} in Bordesley Green, some {{three-quarters of a}} mile(1km) from Muntz Street towards the city centre. The site was where a brickworks once operated; the land sloped steeply down to stagnant pools, yet the stadium was constructed in under twelve months from land clearance to opening ceremony on Boxing Day 1906. Heavy snow nearly prevented the opening; volunteers had to clear pitch and terraces before the match, a goalless draw against Middlesbrough, could go ahead. The ground is reputed to have been cursed by gypsies evicted from the site; although gypsies {{are known to have}} camped nearby, there is no contemporary evidence for their eviction by the club.|$|E
5|$|During April 1887, J.I. Berry {{established}} <b>a</b> <b>site</b> <b>for</b> a town {{after he}} chose a well-watered section along {{the way of the}} Fort Worth and Denver City Railroad, which had begun building across the Texas Panhandle. Berry and Colorado City, Texas, merchants wanted to make their new town site the region's main trading center. On August 30, 1887, Berry's town site won the county seat election and was established in Potter County. Availability of the railroad and freight service after the county seat election made the town a fast-growing cattle-marketing center.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the specificity of Src homology 2 (SH 2) and phosphotyrosine-binding domain interactions are mediated by phosphorylated tyrosines and their neighboring amino acids. Two of the first phosphotyrosine-based binding sites were found on middle T antigen of polyoma virus. Tyr- 250 acts as <b>a</b> binding <b>site</b> <b>for</b> ShcA, whereas Tyr- 315 forms <b>a</b> binding <b>site</b> <b>for</b> the SH 2 domain of the p 85 subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase. However, genetic analysis of a given phosphotyrosine's role in signaling can be complicated when it serves as <b>a</b> binding <b>site</b> <b>for</b> multiple proteins. The situation is particularly difficult when the phosphotyrosine serves as <b>a</b> secondary binding <b>site</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> protein with primary binding determinates elsewhere. Mutation of a tyrosine residue to phenylalanine blocks association of all bound proteins. Here we show that the mutation of the amino acids following the phosphorylated tyrosine to alanine can reveal phosphotyrosine function as <b>a</b> secondary binding <b>site,</b> while abrogating the phosphotyrosine motif's role as <b>a</b> primary binding <b>site</b> <b>for</b> SH 2 domains. We tested this methodology by using middle T antigen. Our results suggest that Tyr- 250 is <b>a</b> secondary binding <b>site</b> <b>for</b> phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase, whereas Tyr- 315 is <b>a</b> secondary binding <b>site</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> yet-to-be-identified protein, which is critical for transformation...|$|R

5|$|In 1983, the {{government}} decided to select <b>a</b> <b>site</b> <b>for</b> permanent repository by 2010. With four nuclear reactors providing 29% of its electricity, Finland in 1987 enacted a Nuclear Energy Act making {{the producers of}} radioactive waste responsible for its disposal, subject to requirements of its Radiation and Nuclear Safety Authority and an absolute veto given to local governments in which a proposed repository would be located. Producers of nuclear waste organized the company Posiva, with responsibility for site selection, construction and operation of a permanent repository. A 1994 amendment to the Act required final disposal of spent fuel in Finland, prohibiting the import or export of radioactive waste.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Banton {{was one of}} {{the sites}} of a {{detailed}} resource assessment by the Department of Energy (DOE), along with Maricaban Island in Batangas and Balut Island in Saranggani. The study aimed to determine whether the island can be <b>a</b> <b>site</b> <b>for</b> low enthalpy geothermal power generation. However, no exploitable geothermal resource has been delineated on the island. On 19 March 2013, the National Museum declared as Important Cultural Property the island's Guyangan Cave System, where precolonial wooden coffins, remains, and the Banton Cloth were found.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, {{the site}} {{began to be}} used as a {{religious}} retirement community by elderly Lhasans, who constructed small huts in which they could live out the final years of their lives in intensive Buddhist practice. Nuns began to renovate the site in the 1980s and founded the modern nunnery, as it is seen today, in 1984, and has since grown into one of the largest nunneries in the Lhasa Valley. However, somewhat unusually, the houses are owned individually by the nuns, but the nunnery has an administrative body and <b>a</b> <b>site</b> <b>for</b> communal gathering.|$|E

5|$|Skagens Museum {{was founded}} {{in the dining room}} at Brøndums Hotel in October 1908. Victor Christian Klæbel, the local pharmacist, Degn Brøndum, {{proprietor}} of Brøndums Hotel and Anna Ancher's brother, and Michael Ancher, Krøyer and Tuxen were elected to form the first board of governors. After P.S. Krøyer's death in 1909, his house in Skagen Plantation was used as a museum. In 1919, Degn Brøndum donated the old hotel's garden to Skagens Museum as <b>a</b> <b>site</b> <b>for</b> a new building. Work started in 1926 and was completed in September 1928 when the new museum was officially opened.|$|E
