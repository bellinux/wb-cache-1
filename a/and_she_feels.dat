5|$|Jones was {{not alone}} in his wish to get more screen time; the writers, who were reading Internet forums and {{receiving}} mail from the audience that requested the same thing, decided that Pete would learn Clark's secret in season two. The creative team hoped that knowing Clark's secret would allow the character to be written into more scenes, and become involved on a daily basis with the Kent family. Ultimately, Pete's primary story arc in season three became the character's inability to deal with knowing Clark's secret, and his growing feeling of abandonment from Clark, who was spending more time with Chloe, Lana and Lex. Millar explains that they felt that the character was being wasted on Smallville, and that led to the decision of writing the character off the show with the hope that he could come back in future episodes. There was dissension between the cast and crew over Jones's departure. According to Annette O'Toole (Martha Kent), Clark needs a guy friend in his life, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>feels</b> that the Kents would have taken Pete in when his parents left Smallville. Though Gough does not disagree that writing out Pete Ross was the best thing, he does feel that his exit could have gone better. According to Gough, Pete's departure felt rushed, and seemed to lack the importance that it should have had.|$|E

[...] Breeds later explained Ruby's reasoning and the hidden issue which makes her believe she loves him so quickly stating: [...] "Ruby has a lot of insecurity because Ruby never really had a father figure.

She feels like the fool, no one goes behind her back. <b>And</b> <b>she</b> <b>feels</b> they are pitying her because of her injury [...] and [...] really hates that." [...] Natasha wants Andrew and Summer to feel guilty about betraying her and she wants Andrew for herself. Andrew believes Natasha is pregnant and instead of being with Summer, he decides to stick by Natasha and their baby. Novakovic said that the new storyline is [...] "very exciting" [...] {{and she could not}} wait to discover the new developments.

500|$|The Daily Star quoted Rowland on {{the theme}} of the song. She said [...] "I hope to see women singing the song like they're in charge. It's {{important}} to know that we are commanders who have the power to shape our own destiny." [...] Love explained to Rap-Up magazine his view of the song, [...] "It's just such an aggressive record, it's a club record, it's a worldwide international record. She's stretching her legs out and she's showing her true vocal ability, she's like the queen of the night on this record." [...] Then during the video shoot of the song Rowland said [...] "I feel like I've finally come into my own," [...] a reference to the exploration of a new musical sound. [...] "With the sound of dance music getting embraced more, I'm very excited, seeing how fans have been responding to the music. Dance music is more of a European thing, but I've been looking on Twitter and seeing fans (in different parts of the country) talking about playing 'Commander'." [...] She said working with Guetta was [...] "amazing" [...] because it is [...] "effortless" [...] <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>feels</b> a great sense of [...] "chemistry" [...] when working with him. Rowland felt she was trying something different: [...] "In this generation and this day and time, no one is putting soul in dance music... no pop artist. I thought maybe that was something I could try. And then it works." [...] In an interview for MSN Xin Rowland admitted the song was [...] "darker" [...] than her previous material but still fun. [...] "I just thought it'd be so much fun to be a commander of course. It's just a statement for me definitely, coming out on my own, filling my space. I'm happy being a commander".|$|E

[...] <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>feels</b> the biggest advantages are in sports where her prestigious height has afforded her advantages. She stated, “I feel I have a presence on the court. I hope I intimidate other people”. Another advantage Taylor possesses, as she has expressed, is because of her larger stature then other players she has what she describes [...] "a bird's eye view of everything" [...] on the court. Literally she can see over other players. Taylor's height has also made it difficult for other players to guard and block her and are generally unable to overpower her.|$|E
2500|$|Norma Selbee is {{a chorus}} girl {{trying to make}} it in New York City. Her {{fortunes}} are not going well, and she is flat broke and on the verge of starvation when she meets Gordon Kent. [...] Kent has spent the last several years in the back woods, utilizing his mining engineering acumen to accumulate a large fortune of approximately $20 million. He has come to the big city looking for a good time, hopefully among the [...] "white shoulders" [...] of the fair damsels of the Big Apple. Upon meeting Norma, he falls head over heels for her and proposes on their first evening together. [...] Norma is reluctant to agree, for she is not a gold-digger, and she is not in love with Kent.

6000|$|... "Don't {{waste your}} breath, Irma néni," [...] he said roughly. [...] "Even if Elsa {{were to come}} and beg my pardon now I would not remain here. I don't care for such tardy, {{perfunctory}} obedience, <b>and</b> this <b>she</b> will learn by and by. For to-night, if you <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>feel</b> ashamed <b>and</b> uncomfortable, well! so much the better. Village gossip doesn't affect me in the least.

50|$|Linda {{is alone}} in the bungalow.

Her baby boy comes along <b>and</b> <b>she</b> says <b>she</b> <b>feels</b> no motherly love for him; he keeps on smiling, then plays with his toes.|$|R
2500|$|Other gaffes {{are due to}} Margaret's ignorance; {{accustomed}} to London's chic salons, she is unaware that she is seen as wearing her shawl [...] "as an empress wears her drapery" [...] (Gaskell, 1855, chapter 7) and serving tea with [...] "the air of a proud reluctant slave". She receives marriage proposals awkwardly: Henry Lennox' declaration of love is [...] "unpleasant" [...] and makes her uncomfortable, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>feels</b> [...] "offended" [...] and assaulted by John Thornton's proposal. Margaret naively believes that the rioters can be negotiated with and is unaware {{that she and her}} brother, Frederick, resemble a loving couple on a train-station platform (O'Farrell, 1997, p.68). Bodenheimer (1979) sees this [...] "mistakenness" [...] as purposeful: [...] "In its every situation, whether industrial politics or emotional life, traditional views and stances break down into confusing new ones, which are rendered in all the pain of mistakenness and conflict that real human change entails" [...] (Bodenheimer, 1979 p.282). Perhaps this is why Margaret's blunders do not always have negative consequences (O'Farrell, 1997, p 163); when she admits she is disappointed that Thornton has refused to hire Higgins, she is ashamed that he hears her remark. Thornton reconsiders, eventually offering Higgins a job. In the final chapter, she does not seem to realize that a [...] "simple proposition" [...] to bail out the factory (a business arrangement) could hurt Thornton's pride or be seen as shocking from a [...] "lady". Bodenheimer interprets scenes like this as [...] "deep confusion in a time of personal change and revision" [...] (Bodenheimer, 1979 p.293) which brings the lovers together (O'Farrell, 1997, p 163).|$|E
