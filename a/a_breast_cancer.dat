5|$|In 2005, Rovers ran an April Fools' joke {{on their}} {{official}} website, {{stating that the}} team's new away strip would be all pink. Although this {{was intended to be}} a joke, a number of fans petitioned the club to get the kit made for real, and also suggested that funds raised through the sale of the pink shirts should be donated to <b>a</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> charity. Although the pink shirts were never used in a competitive fixture, they were worn for a pre-season friendly against Plymouth Argyle in 2006.|$|E

5|$|The club crest depicts an ox above a {{representation}} of a ford to symbolise the location. It reflects the name {{and history of the}} city, as Oxford was originally a market town situated near to a ford on the River Isis, which was used by cattle. In 2008, a bronze statue of an ox was unveiled outside of what would have been the west stand. It was subsequently vandalised in January 2011, being covered in pink paint and the club used the opportunity to raise money for <b>a</b> <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> charity. The shape and design of the crest has changed numerous times since it was first produced. When playing as Headington and {{during the early years of}} Oxford United, the crest included a full ox crossing the ford, as well as the initials H.U.F.C. (pre-1962) or the name Oxford United (post name-change). Between 1972 and 1980, the crest became circular, showing just the ox's head on a yellow and black background. The words 'Oxford United Football Club' were placed around the ox. For the next 17 years, the crest was simply the ox's head coloured blue, with various combinations of wording surrounding it. For example, in the 1987–88 season, the wording 25th Anniversary was placed under the crest. In 1996, the crest had a shield shape and contained the ox's head over the ford, on a yellow background. This version was retained until the move to the Kassam Stadium in 2001, when club steward Rob Alderman designed the current version. It has a similar design to the preceding crest, but the ox and ford are contained in a circle with a yellow background, with the remainder of the crest being coloured blue.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: We {{tested the}} {{hypotheses}} that CHEK 2 * 1100 delC heterozygosity {{is associated with}} increased risk of early death, breast cancer-specific death, and risk of <b>a</b> second <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> in women with <b>a</b> first <b>breast</b> <b>cancer.</b> Patients and Methods: From 22 studies participating in the <b>Breast</b> <b>Cancer</b> Association Consortium, 25, 571 white women with invasive <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> were genotyped for CHEK 2 * 1100 delC and observed for up to 20 years (median, 6. 6 years). We examined risk of early death and breast cancer-specific death by estrogen receptor status and risk of <b>a</b> second <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> after <b>a</b> first <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> in prospective studies. Results: CHEK 2 * 1100 delC heterozygosity was found in 459 patients (1. 8 %). In women with estrogen receptor-positive <b>breast</b> <b>cancer,</b> multifactorially adjusted hazard ratios for heterozygotes versus noncarriers were 1. 43 (95 % CI, 1. 12 to 1. 82; log-rank P =. 004) for early death and 1. 63 (95 % CI, 1. 24 to 2. 15; log-rank P <. 001) for breast cancer-specific death. In all women, hazard ratio for <b>a</b> second <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> was 2. 77 (95 % CI, 2. 00 to 3. 83; log-rank P <. 001) increasing to 3. 52 (95 % CI, 2. 35 to 5. 27; log-rank P <. 001) in women with estrogen receptor-positive first <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> only. Conclusion: Among women with estrogen receptor-positive <b>breast</b> <b>cancer,</b> CHEK 2 * 1100 delC heterozygosity {{was associated with a}} 1. 4 -fold risk of early death, a 1. 6 -fold risk of breast cancer-specific death, and a 3. 5 -fold risk of <b>a</b> second <b>breast</b> <b>cancer.</b> This {{is one of the few}} examples of a genetic factor that influences long-term prognosis being documented in an extensive series of women with <b>breast</b> <b>cancer.</b> © 2012 by American Society of Clinical Oncology...|$|R

Beyond the first year of follow-up, the relative risk of a second tumour was lower but still significantly greater than unity.

Relative risk of <b>a</b> second <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> was generally higher before age 50, independently of the latency. The relative risk of <b>a</b> second <b>breast</b> <b>cancer</b> differed significantly from one region to another, possibly due to specific techniques of registration...|$|R
