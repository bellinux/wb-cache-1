5|$|The {{third section}} {{discusses}} {{the rulers of}} secular society and their flaws. The fourth, which is a formal section, deploys a series of Baroque paradoxes {{in the context of}} the Good Friday mass. This past manner is regarded ironically by the poet in the fifth section <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> back on his period of experimentation in 'the years of l'entre deux guerres as 'largely wasted'. He welcomes approaching old age as a new opportunity to find renewal, although it might only be a rediscovery of 'what has been lost and found and lost again'.|$|E
5|$|Black {{doubts that}} Winston is the killer, and while Hollis {{stays in the}} hotel, he visits the production's climactic shoot, set during a {{performance}} by the band Kiss. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> around him, the sheriff's body is thrown down from the rafters; as the pandemonium settles, Black realizes that horror films end with the leading lady being targeted—the killer is after Hollis. Racing back to her hotel, Black discover Hollis fending off a chainsaw-wielding Bianco. Black is able to subdue Bianco after Hollis disables the chainsaw; the actor then explains that he lacked Black's insight and had to commit the crimes {{in order to see}} {{through the eyes of a}} killer.|$|E

5|$|In the present, {{during the}} re-dedication ceremony, Mulder realizes {{that no one}} can see Teager if they are in his line of sight. Teager follows Skinner and Bloch to the motorcade, where he unsuccessfully shoots at the general and Skinner suffers a flesh wound. Teager is shot in turn by the agents as he tries to escape. As he succumbs to his wounds, Teager repeats his Army identification. Afterwards, the Pentagon states that the assassin was a {{different}} person—which Mulder denounces as a lie. He leaves Skinner to silently ponder his own service in the Vietnam War <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> upon Teager's name on the memorial wall.|$|E
5|$|It {{begins with}} a shot of Wade's face and the guitar introduction. He then sings {{the first line of}} lyrics, which is {{followed}} by a transition to a boy lying on a bed shirtless. As the video switches between Wade and the boy, it zooms on the bed frame (which has the same face from the album cover) and opens into another area. The boy is then seen walking around the new area looking around until he goes up nearby stairs. While going up the stairs, the video switches between shots of the boy going up the stairs and Wade singing the lyrics. Once up the stairs, the boy looks around and then walks into a bright light that he sees nearby. He walks through the bright archway into a dark room as the video switches to Lifehouse playing the song. After this, it switches to the boy <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> up and the camera zooms out to reveal that he is in a giant maze. He then walks back where he came from to find that he is in a house with Lifehouse playing on the television. He then jumps off a window sill and appears tiny as he walks up to a book that is bigger than him. It then transitions to Lifehouse playing the song as the boy gets up on a chair which slowly transcends into his original bed. The video then zooms out on the boy lying on his bed and then switches to the band. It ends with the boy walking into darkness and Wade's face looking on the floor.|$|E

25|$|The statue was rededicated on October 19, 2012 by General John Mulholland. At {{the time}} of the {{original}} battle he was Lieutenant general and Deputy Commanding General of U.S. Army Special Forces Command. He dedicated the statue in its new location in front of One World Trade Center across from Ground Zero and 9/11 Memorial. The bronze statue was positioned so the soldier atop the horse is keeping a watchful eye <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> back {{over his shoulder at the}} World Trade Center and its tenants.

500|$|However, Patrick's rift with Victor {{eventually}} transforms {{him into}} a rather cynical character (much like Victor), and he often responds to him in similarly vindictive ways {{as a means of}} trying to settle the score. For example, writing complaints and grievances on post-it notes. This aspect of Patrick's character came to a head in the episode [...] "The Executioner's Song" [...] where his face temporarily morphs into that of Victor's <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> into a mirror.|$|E
500|$|An {{animated}} {{music video}} was produced for [...] "Hello Sunshine", directed by Pete Fowler, Neil McFarland and Passion Pictures and featuring Fowler's cartoon drawings. The video {{begins with the}} sun rising over a country landscape. A small, blue, 'Hello Sunshine' winged horse flies across the sky and is watched by a man holding a 1:16 scale model kit for the same horse. The picture of the horse on the box flies away <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> at it and lands on one of five hot air balloons flown by cartoon representations of the Super Furry Animals. The video cuts to a brief shot of a man staring through a shop window at an advertising display featuring models of the 'Hello Sunshine' horse before we see Gruff Rhys coming across a huge statue of the same horse in his car.|$|E

500|$|The marble statue {{is located}} on Indiana Avenue NW, {{in front of the}} old District of Columbia City Hall in the Judiciary Square neighborhood. [...] It {{measures}} [...] high [...] wide while the granite base measures [...] high and [...] wide. [...] The statue portrays Abraham Lincoln standing, wearing a long coat with a bow tie and waistcoat. [...] His left hand rests on a fasces while his right arm is by his side. [...] Lincoln's partially open right hand points to the ground <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> to his left. [...] The right hand was replaced at some point and the new one is considered too large to scale. [...] A sword or scroll previously hung by his right side, but is now missing. [...] The two-tiered base consists of a rectangle on top of a lower square-shaped foundation.|$|E
500|$|Many of the 82 Fredman's Epistles remain {{popular in}} Sweden. Their diverse styles and themes may be {{illustrated}} {{with examples of}} some of the best-known songs. To begin with No. 23, Ach du min Moder! (Alas, thou my mother), which has been described as [...] "the to-be-or-not-to-be of Swedish literature", tells, in realist style, the story of a drunk who wakes in a Stockholm gutter outside the Crawl-In Tavern. He curses his parents for conceiving him [...] "perhaps upon a table" [...] <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> at his torn clothes. Then the tavern door opens, and he goes in and has his first drink. The song ends with loud thanks to the drunk's mother and father. In contrast, the Rococo No. 28, I går såg jag ditt barn, min Fröja (Yesterday I saw thy child, my Freya), tells the tale of an attempt to arrest the [...] "nymph" [...] Ulla Winblad, based on a real event. Bellman here combines realism – Ulla wearing a black embroidered bodice, and losing her watch in a named street (Yxsmedsgränd) in Stockholm's Gamla stan – with images from classical mythology, such as a myrtle crown and an allusion to the goddess Aphrodite.|$|E
500|$|Eidelman {{stated that}} he finds science fiction the most {{interesting}} and exciting genre to compose for, and that Meyer told him to treat the film as a fresh start, rather than drawing on old Star Trek themes. Eidelman wanted the music to aid the visuals; for Rura Penthe, he strove to create an atmosphere that reflected the alien and dangerous setting, introducing exotic instruments for color. Besides using percussion from around the world, Eidelman treated the choir as percussion, with the Klingon language translation for [...] "to be, or not to be" [...] ("taH pagh, taHbe") being repeated in the background. Spock's theme {{was designed to be}} an ethereal counterpart to the motif for Kirk and the Enterprise, aimed at capturing [...] "the emotional gleam in the captain's eye". Kirk's internal dilemma about what the future holds was echoed in the main theme: [...] "It's Kirk taking control one last time and <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> out into the stars he has the spark again [...] But there's an unresolved note, because it's very important that he doesn't trust the Klingons. He doesn't want to go on this trip even though the spark is there that overtook him." [...] For the climactic battle, Eidelman starts the music quietly, building the intensity as the battle progresses.|$|E

500|$|Blood Omen 2 pursues {{a younger}} Kain during his early conquests of Nosgoth, in the altered {{timeline}} {{triggered by the}} changes to Raziel's destiny {{at the end of}} Soul Reaver 2. Legacy of Kain: Defiance takes place in the same altered timeline, periodically switching between the characters of the elder Kain and Raziel from Soul Reaver 2, with both acting as playable protagonists. Over the course of the game, Moebius manipulates Kain into believing he is a champion prophesied to fight against and destroy Raziel, culminating in a final battle between the two characters which Raziel wins. It is discovered that The Elder God is malevolent, and he and Moebius—his servant—had conspired against Kain from the outset of the series, considering vampires an abomination. Kain, after being presumed dead, returns, and reconciles with Raziel, who willingly enters the Soul Reaver. As he does so, he uses his powers to cleanse Kain of the corruption he inherited at birth as a Pillar guardian. Armed with the ancient sword once again, Kain is able to see and battle The Elder God for the first time, but is unable to destroy him. The story ends <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> out at the Nosgoth landscape; though uncertain that he can ever restore the world, he contemplates Raziel's sacrifice and the [...] "first bitter taste" [...] of hope it has given him.|$|E
500|$|The horses {{who have}} served as Thunder {{have been trained to}} remain calm in {{situations}} that would normally cause a horse to respond with a fight-or-flight response, such as the flashing explosions of a pyrotechnic display, or items suddenly landing on the field including skydivers with parachutes and various objects thrown by spectators, or loud music and the sounds associated {{with tens of thousands of}} cheering fans at Mile High. Ann Judge has explained that because so many unexpected things can happen, it is important that the people working with him remain calm; it is trust in his rider and handlers, not just desensitization, that helps the horse remain steady: [...] "You want them to look to you for the appropriate response and for confidence and faith so that the flight response doesn’t get initiated." [...] She describes the process by saying, [...] "if something is fearful to him, as long <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> to me, and I tell him he’s OK, he’s OK." [...] The only frightening stimuli that was an ongoing problem for both Thunder Sr. and Thunder II was when the crowd would perform the wave; Thunder Sr. would stand still, but tremble. Thunder II would become tense, requiring ground handlers and his rider to help steady him. Thunder III is the first of the mascots to tolerate wearing earplugs, which help protect his hearing from loud noises during games.|$|E
500|$|The only European {{shows in}} Paris, France, were also lauded by critics. Lewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the second Parisian show a five star review. He praised the {{performance}} abilities of both artists, explaining [...] "When left to [...] own devices on stage, the rapper is forceful and beguiling. It takes little {{for him to}} have thousands waving their hands to 'Tom Ford', <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> dapper in honour of the designer. But when Beyoncé rises up out of the stage in a denim military outfit to the question 'bad bitch?' and then storms into 'Run The World (Girls)', the track's sentiment couldn't resound more. Without doubt, she lives up to her hype as one of the world's best performers. Slick movement, tight choreography, innocent attitude and effortless vocals instantly escalate the atmosphere of the show." [...] Simon Harper of Clash felt that both performers had immediately apparent different performance approaches and both commanded an [...] "incredible presence and deafening screams from the French crowd", however concluded that Beyoncé just finished on top as the better of the two, finalising his all positive review with [...] "The music world's most powerful and influential partnership couldn't fail to demonstrate the reasons for their rise to dominance... As the On The Run tour comes to its conclusion, it's clear to see that Mrs. Carter emerges on top. But damn, it was a good race to watch." ...|$|E
