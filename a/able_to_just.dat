25|$|The tenth Rugby League World Cup {{followed}} a similar format covering the years 1989 and 1992.

25|$|The immortal souls {{that follow}} the gods most closely are <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> barely raise their chariots {{up to the}} rim and look out on reality. They see some things and miss others, {{having to deal with}} their horses; they rise and fall at varying times. Other souls, while {{straining}} to keep up, are unable to rise, and in noisy, sweaty discord they leave uninitiated, not having seen reality. Where they go after is then dependent on their own opinions, rather than the truth. Any soul that catches sight of any true thing is granted another circuit where it can see more; eventually, all souls fall back to earth. Those that have been initiated are put into varying human incarnations, depending on how much they have seen; those made into philosophers have seen the most, while kings, statesmen, doctors, prophets, poets, manual laborers, sophists, and tyrants follow respectively.|$|E

500|$|The Open Door took 18 {{months to}} write. The new songs {{were written by}} Lee and Balsamo, who share credits for nine songs. Lee was the sole writer of [...] "Like You", [...] "Lithium" [...] and [...] "Good Enough", and co-wrote [...] "All That I'm Living For" [...] with guitarist John LeCompt. The singer confessed that after Moody's {{departure}} she had nobody to hold her back {{in the writing process}} and that Balsamo was lifting her up and pushing her to do something she would not have done with Moody. Regarding this, Lee said, [...] "He's a great writer, and it was just like we were just having fun with it for a change. It was like, 'Let's stop taking everything so seriously and have fun,' and we wrote a lot of songs that I'm just totally in love with." [...] The singer further told The Sun, [...] " [...] got this sort of spooky, surreal element to his guitar writing [...] It’s really cool because it just works perfectly with what we do. He was really trying to create something so we were both discovering this new sound together and branching out [...] Writing with Terry was a unique experience in my life because I’ve never been <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> sit and write music with somebody and not be afraid of what they would say." [...] Lee went on explaining that the making of the album was [...] "really intense" [...] and that she came out [...] "feeling purified" [...] while her writing partner, Balsamo, lifted her [...] "to a whole new level of inspiration and possibilities". She said it was only about [...] "writing great music".|$|E

Bush was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> barely eke out a win in the city with a very narrow plurality in 2000. However since 2000, Williamsburg has trended hard to the left.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding his {{political}} views, Carolla has stated, [...] "I guess I would be Republican, {{in the sense}} that I want a secure border, I'm not into the welfare state, I'm not into all those freebie lunch programs.

[...] He goes on to state, however, that he is also in favor of typically liberal causes such as the legalization of marijuana and support for as well some progressive causes such as [...] "... against semi-automatic and automatic weapons. I'm not an NRA guy {{by any stretch of the}} imagination. I'd like alternative energy to be explored and electric cars to be used, but I want them to be powered by nuclear power plants." [...] (He is a member of the advisory board of the Marijuana Policy Project.) Elsewhere, he has stated, [...] "My feeling is this whole country is founded on the principle of 'If you are not hurting anyone, and you're not fucking with someone else's shit, and you are paying your taxes, you should be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>just</b> do what you want to do.'

50|$|If the {{key issue}} is bank solvency, {{converting}} debt to equity via bondholder haircuts presents an elegant solution to the problem.
