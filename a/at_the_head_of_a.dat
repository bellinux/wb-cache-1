5|$|Isaac I Komnenos (c. 1007 – 1061), married Catherine of Bulgaria, {{daughter}} of the last Bulgarian Tsar, and a distinguished general. He became emperor in 1057 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cabal of Anatolian generals, but resigned in 1059 and retired to a monastery.|$|E
5|$|Only the Emir's son, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small force, {{managed to}} escape the battlefield, fleeing south towards the border area of Charsianon.

5|$|As Swedish is a Germanic language, the syntax shows {{similarities}} to both English and German. Like English, Swedish has a subject–verb–object basic word order, but like German, it utilizes verb-second word order in main clauses, for instance after adverbs, adverbial phrases and dependent clauses. (Adverbial phrases denoting time are usually {{placed at the}} beginning of a main clause that is <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sentence.) Prepositional phrases are placed in a place–manner–time order, as in English (but not German). Adjectives precede the noun they modify.|$|E

5|$|Captain Broke boarded Chesapeake <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{party of}} 20men. They met little {{resistance}} from Chesapeakes crew, {{most of whom}} had run below deck. The only resistance from Chesapeake came from her contingent of marines. The British soon overwhelmed them; only nine escaped injury out of 44. Captain Broke was severely injured in the fighting on the forecastle, being struck {{in the head with}} a sword. Soon after, Shannons crew pulled down Chesapeakes flag. Only 15minutes had elapsed from the first exchange of gunfire to the capture.|$|E

5|$|Ferdinand's army seized Visegrád, Vác, Pest, Tata and Székesfehérvár in October, {{but could}} not capture Buda. His {{military}} commander, Wilhelm von Roggendorf, again laid siege to Buda on 4May 1541. Suleiman left Istanbul <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large army in June {{to take advantage of}} the new civil war in Hungary. On his command, Petru Rareș, Prince of Moldavia, captured Stephen Majláth and forced the Transylvanian Diet to swear fealty to John Sigismund in late July.

5|$|Ladislaus is {{a patron}} saint of Hungary, {{especially}} along the borders. In particular, soldiers and the Székely people venerate him. A late medieval legend says that Ladislaus appeared <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Székely army fighting against and routing a plundering band of Tatars in 1345. He is also called upon during times of pestilence. He is often depicted as a mature, bearded man wearing a royal crown and holding a long sword or banner. He is also shown on his knees before a deer, or {{in the company of}} two angels.|$|E
5|$|Manuel {{responded to}} this outrage in a {{characteristically}} energetic way. In the winter of 1158–59, he marched to Cilicia <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> huge army; the speed of his advance (Manuel had hurried on ahead of the main army with 500 cavalry) was such that he managed to surprise the Armenian Thoros of Cilicia, {{who had participated in}} the attack on Cyprus. Thoros fled into the mountains, and Cilicia swiftly fell to Manuel.|$|E

5|$|On 9 March 1962, the {{recently}} re-convened Léopoldville Parliament, under Cyrille Adoula, agreed {{to modify the}} Constitution and gave South Kasai official provincial status. In April 1962, UN troops were ordered to occupy South Kasai as part of U Thant's new aggressive stance against secession following Hammarskjöld's death. In Léopoldville, Kalonji was sentenced to five years' imprisonment. On 7 September, however, Kalonji escaped from prison and returned to South Kasai where he hoped to regain an official position in local elections and, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> government, regain his immunity.|$|E
5|$|The debate {{took all}} day, and the votes were counted very late that night. After the presentations, people {{voted for the}} {{continuation}} of the Viceroy, alone or <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> junta, or his dismissal. The ideas explained were divided into a small number of proposals, designated with the names of their main supporters, and the people then voted for one of those proposals.

5|$|The sultan's forces {{sustained}} roughly 500 casualties, {{while only}} one British sailor was injured.

5|$|Whether {{the father}} of Constance's second son, Baldwin, was Raymond of Poitiers or Raynald of Châtillon cannot be {{determined}} with certainty. Baldwin died fighting <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Byzantine cavalry regiment in the Battle of Myriokephalon on September17, 1176. It is certain that Raynald fathered Agnes, who became the wife of Béla III of Hungary. Raynald and Constance's second daughter, Alice, became the third wife of Azzo VI of Este in 1204.|$|E
5|$|While Gomułka's anti-Soviet {{image was}} exaggerated, it was {{justified}} {{in the popular}} imagination by his anti-Stalinist line in 1948 and years of subsequent internment. Thus, Polish communists found themselves unexpectedly <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> national liberation movement. The enthusiastic public support offered to Gomułka contributed to the legitimization of communist rule in Poland, which incorporated mass nationalist, anti-Soviet feelings into the prevailing power structures. In Hungary, social protest destroyed the political system; in Poland, it was absorbed within it.|$|E
5|$|With {{the breakup}} of the Carolingian Empire in the 9th century, the system of feudalism places kings <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pyramid of {{relationships}} between liege lords and vassals, dependent on the regional rule of barons, and the intermediate positions of counts (or earls) and dukes. The core of European feudal manorialism in the High Middle Ages were the territories of the kingdom of France, the Holy Roman Empire (centered on the nominal kingdoms of Germany and Italy) and the kingdoms of England and Scotland.|$|E

5|$|After Cadwallon ap Cadfan, {{the king}} of Gwynedd, in {{alliance}} with the pagan Penda of Mercia, killed Edwin of Deira in battle at Hatfield Chase in 633 (or 632, depending on when the years used by Bede are considered to have begun), Northumbria was split between its constituent kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira. Oswald's brother Eanfrith became king of Bernicia, but {{he was killed by}} Cadwallon in 634 (or 633) after attempting to negotiate peace. Subsequently, Oswald, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small army (possibly with the aid of allies from the north, the Scots and/or the Picts), met Cadwallon in battle at Heavenfield, near Hexham. Before the battle, Oswald had a wooden cross erected; he knelt down, holding the cross in position until enough earth had been thrown in the hole to make it stand firm. He then prayed and asked his army to join in.|$|E
5|$|Cretan piracy reached another {{high in the}} 930s and 940s, devastating {{southern}} Greece, Athos, and {{the western}} coasts of Asia Minor. As a result, Emperor Constantine VII (r. 913–959) sent another expedition in 949. This too was routed in a surprise attack, a defeat which Byzantine chroniclers ascribe to the incompetence and inexperience of its leader, the eunuch chamberlain Constantine Gongyles. Constantine VII did not give up, and during {{the last years of}} his reign he began preparing another expedition. It would be carried out under his successor, Romanos II (r. 959–963), who entrusted its leadership to the capable general Nikephoros Phokas. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> huge fleet and army, Phokas sailed in June or July 960, landed on the island, and defeated the initial Muslim resistance. A long siege of Chandax followed, which dragged over the winter into 961, when the city was stormed on 6 March.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} Arévalo's {{presidency}} in 1951, Jacobo Árbenz {{was elected to the}} {{presidency in}} a landslide. The progressive military leader of 1944 continued Arévalo's reforms, and began an ambitious land-reform program, known as Decree 900. Under it, the uncultivated portions of large land-holdings were expropriated in return for compensation, and redistributed to poverty-stricken agricultural laborers. Approximately 500,000 people benefited from the decree. The majority of them were indigenous people, whose forebears had been dispossessed after the Spanish invasion. Árbenz' policies ran afoul of the United Fruit Company, which lost some of its uncultivated land. The company lobbied the US government for Árbenz' overthrow, and the State Department responded by engineering a coup under the pretext that Árbenz was a communist. Carlos Castillo Armas took power <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> military junta, provoking the Guatemalan Civil War. The war lasted from 1960 to 1996, and saw the US-backed military commit genocide against the indigenous Maya peoples, and widespread human rights violations against civilians.|$|E
