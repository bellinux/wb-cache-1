5|$|On the August 27 {{episode of}} Raw, Triple H was {{supposed}} to address his potential retirement, but did not make <b>a</b> <b>definitive</b> decision. On the December 17 episode of Raw, Triple H made a non-wrestling appearance for the 2012 Slammy Awards debuting with his new haircut.|$|E
5|$|A Night to Remember is a 1955 non-fiction book by Walter Lord {{about the}} sinking of the RMS Titanic on 15 April 1912. The book was hugely successful, and is still {{considered}} <b>a</b> <b>definitive</b> resource about the Titanic. Lord interviewed many survivors of the disaster as well as drawing on books, memoirs and articles that they had written. He authored a follow-up book, The Night Lives On, in 1986 following renewed interest in the story after the wreck of Titanic was found.|$|E

50|$|The stamps of Tanzania {{were also}} valid in Kenya and Uganda (until 1976), and so Tanzania did not {{typically}} issue its own commemoratives. <b>A</b> <b>definitives</b> series issued 9 December 1967 featured various fish, and series of 15 stamps from 3 December 1973 depicted butterflies. Four of these values were surcharged 17 November 1975.|$|R
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>definitive</b> {{diagnosis}} of TB {{is made by}} identifying M. tuberculosis in a clinical sample (e.g., sputum, pus, or a tissue biopsy). However, the difficult culture process for this slow-growing organism can take two to six weeks for blood or sputum culture. Thus, treatment is often begun before cultures are confirmed.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>definitive</b> {{diagnosis}} of the condition can usually be made once a clinical history and physical examination have been obtained, though determining {{whether or not the}} bursitis is septic is not as straightforward. Treatment of prepatellar bursitis depends on the severity of the symptoms. Mild cases may only require rest and icing of the knee. A number of different treatment options have been used for severe septic cases, including intravenous antibiotics, surgical irrigation of the bursa, and bursectomy.|$|E
5|$|Feeling that a {{complete}} {{destruction of the}} GUNT would be an intolerable blow for his prestige, and fearing that Habré would provide support for all opposition to Gaddafi, the Colonel called for a Libyan intervention in force, as his Chadian allies could not secure <b>a</b> <b>definitive</b> victory without Libyan armor and airpower.|$|E

5|$|Given the book's {{fluid and}} {{changeable}} approach to plot and characters, <b>a</b> <b>definitive,</b> critically agreed-upon plot synopsis remains elusive (see Critical response and themes: Difficulties of plot summary below). Therefore, the following synopsis attempts to summarise {{events in the}} book which find general, although inevitably not universal, consensus among critics.|$|E
5|$|Growth {{in the use}} of {{neonicotinoid}} pesticides has roughly tracked rising bee deaths. In 2015, an 11-year British {{study showed}} <b>a</b> <b>definitive</b> relationship between increasing agricultural use of neonicotinoid and escalating honey bee colony losses at a landscape level. This is the first field study to establish a link between neonicotinoids and CCD.|$|E
5|$|On October 5, 2010, Little, Brown and Company {{announced}} that , <b>a</b> <b>definitive</b> encyclopedic reference for the saga including character profiles, outtakes, {{a conversation with}} Meyer, genealogical charts, maps and extensive cross-references with nearly 100 full color illustrations, was to be released on April 12, 2011, after many publication delays since 2008. It debuted at #1 on The New York Times Best Seller list, where it stayed for three consecutive weeks, and at #4 on the USA Today Best Seller list.|$|E

5|$|Piattoli was an {{inspiration}} to Leo Tolstoy, who based {{the figure of the}} Abbé Morio in War and Peace (1869) on him. He {{is also one of the}} figures immortalized in Jan Matejko's 1891 painting, Constitution of May 3, 1791. In his 1980 ten-page entry on Piattoli in the Polish Biographical Dictionary, historian Emanuel Rostworowski notes that, “despite two Italian monographs (by A.D. Ancon and G. Bozzolato)”, Piattoli still awaits <b>a</b> <b>definitive</b> biography.|$|E
5|$|The actual {{battle of}} Salamis {{is not well}} {{described}} by the ancient sources, and {{it is unlikely that}} anyone (other than perhaps Xerxes) involved in the battle had a clear idea what was happening across the width of the straits. What follows is more of a discussion than <b>a</b> <b>definitive</b> account.|$|E
5|$|The {{early stages}} of Alzheimer's disease are {{difficult}} to diagnose. <b>A</b> <b>definitive</b> diagnosis is usually made once cognitive impairment compromises daily living activities, although the person may still be living independently. The symptoms will progress from mild cognitive problems, such as memory loss through increasing stages of cognitive and non-cognitive disturbances, eliminating any possibility of independent living, especially in the late stages of the disease.|$|E

50|$|<b>As</b> <b>definitive</b> as Smith and Baer's early {{mechanism}} seems, {{there are}} several phenomena {{that it did not}} account for. The problem with their mechanism mainly focused around TDR precursors that have alkyl substituents on the ring. When said substituent is placed on the ring as to make the molecule still symmetric, one product is formed upon exposure to TDR conditions. However, if the alkyl is placed on the ring as to make the molecule unsymmetric, several products could form.|$|R

5|$|Verdi made {{numerous}} {{changes to}} the music after the first performance, and editors have found difficulty in agreeing on <b>a</b> <b>definitive</b> score. The work was first recorded in 1932 and has subsequently received many studio and live recordings. Singers {{closely associated with the}} title role have included Victor Maurel (the first Falstaff), Mariano Stabile, Giuseppe Valdengo, Tito Gobbi, Geraint Evans and Bryn Terfel.|$|E
5|$|Warm seclusions {{may have}} cloud-free, eye-like {{features}} at their center (reminiscent of tropical cyclones), significant pressure falls, hurricane-force winds, and moderate to strong convection. The most intense warm seclusions often attain pressures less than 950millibars (28.05inHg) with <b>a</b> <b>definitive</b> lower to mid-level warm core structure. A warm seclusion, {{the result of}} a baroclinic lifecycle, occurs at latitudes well poleward of the tropics.|$|E
5|$|According to the New England Historical Genealogical Society, {{several members}} of Warren's {{maternal}} family claim Cherokee heritage; the Society found a family newsletter that alluded to a marriage license application that listed Elizabeth Warren’s great-great-great grandmother as a Cherokee, but {{could not find the}} primary document and found no proof of Warren's Native American heritage. The Oklahoma Historical Society stated that finding <b>a</b> <b>definitive</b> answer about Native American heritage can be difficult because of intermarriage and deliberate avoidance of registration. Some members of the Cherokee Nation protested her claim to Native American ancestry and questioned whether she benefitted from it. Former colleagues and supervisors at the universities where she had worked (including Charles Fried, former Solicitor General under President Ronald Reagan) said Warren's ancestry was either not mentioned, or played no role in her hiring.|$|E

5|$|Also {{during the}} 1970s, Bill Morris was {{studying}} giant lambeosaurine remains from Baja California. He named them ?L. laticaudus in 1981 (type specimen LACM 17715). Morris used {{a question mark}} in his work because no complete crest had been found for his species, and without it <b>a</b> <b>definitive</b> assignment could not be made. From what was known of the skull, he considered it to be most like Lambeosaurus. He interpreted this species as water-bound, due to features like its size, its tall and narrow tail (interpreted as a swimming adaptation), and weak hip articulations, {{as well as a}} healed broken thigh bone that he thought would have been too much of a handicap for a terrestrial animal to have survived long enough to heal. This species was later (2012) assigned to the new genus Magnapaulia.|$|E
5|$|As part of Sarakreek's 1997 {{purchase}} {{of most of}} the L'Enfant Plaza complex, Sarakreek put the L'Enfant Plaza Hotel up for sale. Stanford Hotels Corporation, a privately owned firm, successfully bid $48 million for the structure. After <b>a</b> <b>definitive</b> sale agreement was reached in 1998, Sarakreek backed out of the deal. Hotels Stanford sued in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. In Stanford Hotels Corporation v. Potomac Creek Associates (CAB-1413-99, 1999), Superior Court Judge Leonard Braman ruled that Sarakreek was not in breach of contract. Stanford Hotels appealed. Various motions delayed the appellate hearing until 2009.|$|E
5|$|As the 1992 Kansas City Chiefs season began, the team's {{first big}} move was {{the signing of}} quarterback Dave Krieg to compete with DeBerg and Vlasic. A couple weeks after Krieg's signing, DeBerg signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, leaving Vlasic as the primary backup to Krieg. The Chiefs went into {{training}} camp {{and went through the}} preseason with Krieg, Vlasic, and rookie draft pick Matt Blundin. Krieg ended up playing every snap of the season, leaving both Vlasic without a year's worth of playing time as his contract expired. The trading of Joe Montana to the Chiefs put <b>a</b> <b>definitive</b> end to Vlasic's time in Kansas City.|$|E
