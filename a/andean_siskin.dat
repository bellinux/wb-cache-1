50|$|The <b>Andean</b> <b>siskin</b> (Spinus spinescens) is {{a species}} of finch in the family Fringillidae. It is found in Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela. Its natural {{habitats}} are subtropical or tropical moist montane forests, subtropical or tropical high-altitude shrubland, subtropical or tropical high-altitude grassland, and heavily degraded former forest.|$|E
50|$|This {{is a small}} green-and-yellow finch. According to some sources, it is the {{smallest}} species of finch on average, although others give this title to the lesser goldfinch. The total length can range from 9.5 to 11 cm. A weight of 11.5 g {{may be at the}} high end. Few standard measurements are known, although the bill has been recorded at 1.1 cm and the wing chord length is reportedly around 6.4 cm. The <b>Andean</b> <b>siskin</b> has deep green upperparts with black and yellow coloration on the wings and tail. The adult male has a distinctive black cap. Female lacks this cap and is generally a duller olive color, with white from the belly to the undertail-coverts. The female differs from female yellow-bellied siskin in being paler and brighter, also by lacking the olive throat and yellow undertail-coverts of that species. Female hooded siskins are also similar but the Andean has distinctive white undertail-coverts and more olive-green rather than gray color. The <b>Andean</b> <b>siskin</b> race S. s. nigricauda is generally duller or darker green on upperparts than the nominate, in this subspecies the underparts are dull green and lacking any trace of yellow. The tail is all black and the wings lack greenish-yellow tips to the coverts but the race does retain bright yellow bases to the inner primaries and secondaries. The race S. s. capitanea is similar but the underparts are generally paler olive without any of the dark olive centers to the feathers, it also has yellow on sides of the base of the tail and on the tips of the median and greater coverts.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} common to locally common. It occurs in {{subtropical}} and p√°ramo zones of the northern Andes. The Andean siskins is usually found between elevations of 1800 and 3700 m, though occasionally ranges as low as 1500 m in Colombia. It inhabits scrub or low bushes in open cloud or elfin forests or {{along the edges of}} forests. It may also be seen on open hillsides with scattered trees or bushes and occasionally range to edges of cultivation. Usually, the <b>Andean</b> <b>siskin</b> is found in pairs or small flocks of up to 20, occasionally mixed with other species of finch, such as hooded siskin in northern Ecuador. It often perches high in tops of trees, but generally feeds on or near the ground. This species feeds on a variety of plant seeds, with a particular fondness for Espeletia seeds and flowers.|$|E
5000|$|This petite {{species is}} not only the {{smallest}} North American Spinus finch, it may be the smallest true finch in the world. Some sources list more subtropical Spinus species as slightly smaller on average, including the <b>Andean</b> <b>siskin.</b> This species ranges from 9 to 12 cm in length and can weigh from 8 to 11.5 g. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 5.5 to 7 cm, the tail is 3.9 to 4.7 cm, the bill is 0.9 to 1.1 cm and the tarsus is 1.1 to 1.2 cm. There is a slight NW-SE cline in size, with the largest birds from Mexico and south being up to one-fifth larger than the smallest from the extreme NW of its range; this effect is more pronounced in females. There is also considerable variation in the amount of black on head and back in males, and thus three subspecies have been proposed. But this variation too seem to be simple and clinal changes in allele frequency, and thus the [...] "subspecies" [...] might be better considered morphs or geographical forms.|$|E
5000|$|The {{smallest}} [...] "classical" [...] true finches are the <b>Andean</b> <b>siskin</b> (Spinus spinescens) at {{as little}} as 9.5 cm (3.8 in) and the lesser goldfinch (Spinus psaltria) at {{as little as}} 8 g. The largest species is probably the collared grosbeak (Mycerobas affinis) at up to 24 cm and 83 g, although larger lengths, to 25.5 cm in the pine grosbeak (Pinicola enucleator), and weights, to 86.1 g in the evening grosbeak (Hesperiphona vespertinus), have been recorded in species which are slightly smaller on average. They typically have strong, stubby beaks, which in some species can be quite large; however, Hawaiian honeycreepers are famous for {{the wide range of}} bill shapes and sizes brought about by adaptive radiation. All true finches have 9 primary remiges and 12 rectrices. The basic plumage colour is brownish, sometimes greenish; many have considerable amounts of black, while white plumage is generally absent except as wing-bars or other signalling marks. Bright yellow and red carotenoid pigments are commonplace in this family, and thus blue structural colours are rather rare, as the yellow pigments turn the blue color into green. Many, but by no means all true finches have strong sexual dichromatism, the females typically lacking the bright carotenoid markings of males.|$|E
