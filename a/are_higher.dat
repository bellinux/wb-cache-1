Compared to the national averages, the unemployment rate is lower and the average income higher; tertiary education levels <b>are</b> <b>higher,</b> while the population is younger. Property prices are relatively high, in part due to comparatively restrictive development regulations.|$|E

5|$|Divers {{may carry}} one {{cylinder}} or multiples, {{depending on the}} requirements of the dive. Where diving takes place in low risk areas, where the diver may safely make a free ascent, or where a buddy is available to provide an alternative air supply in an emergency, recreational divers usually carry only one cylinder. Where diving risks <b>are</b> <b>higher,</b> for example where the visibility is low or when recreational divers do deeper or decompression diving, and particularly when diving under an overhead, divers routinely carry more than one gas source.|$|E

5|$|In nature, free oxygen is {{produced}} by the light-driven splitting of water during oxygenic photosynthesis.

5|$|Lack of {{differentiation}} between homosexual and heterosexual women in medical studies that concentrate on health issues for women skews results for lesbians and non-lesbian women. Reports are inconclusive about occurrence {{of breast cancer}} in lesbians. It has been determined, however, that the lower rate of lesbians tested by regular Pap smears {{makes it more difficult}} to detect cervical cancer at early stages in lesbians. The risk factors for developing ovarian cancer rates <b>are</b> <b>higher</b> in lesbians than heterosexual women, perhaps because many lesbians lack protective factors of pregnancy, abortion, contraceptives, breast feeding, and miscarriages.|$|E
5|$|Northern mockingbirds are altricial, meaning that, when hatched, {{they are}} born {{relatively}} immobile and defenseless and therefore require nourishment for a certain duration from their parents. The young have a survival bottleneck at the nestling stage because there <b>are</b> <b>higher</b> levels of nestling predation than egg predation. The levels of belligerence exhibited by parents therefore increase once eggs hatch {{but there is no}} increase during the egg stage.|$|E

5|$|Nurkse {{argued against}} {{the notion that}} a large {{population}} implies a large market. Though underdeveloped countries have a large population, their levels of productivity are low. This results in low levels of per capita real income. Thus, consumption expenditure is low, and savings are either very low or completely absent. On the other hand, developed countries have smaller populations than underdeveloped countries but by virtue of high levels of productivity, their per capita real incomes <b>are</b> <b>higher</b> and thus they create a large market for goods and services.|$|E
5|$|Offshore {{wind power}} is {{captured}} by wind turbines placed out at sea; {{it has the}} advantage that wind speeds <b>are</b> <b>higher</b> than on land, though wind farms are more costly to construct offshore.
