5|$|In late October, the 102d {{departed}} Logan for Phalsbourg-Bourscheid Air Base, Phalsbourg, France. The wing had 82 Sabres, {{plus two}} C-47 Skytrains and six T-33 Shooting Stars for support and training purposes. During the crisis, the wing controlled the 102d Tactical Fighter Group, the 104th Tactical Fighter Group, and the 174th Tactical Fighter Group from New York. The 102d's primary {{mission was to}} provide close air support to NATO ground forces, including the Seventh Army, and <b>air</b> <b>interdiction.</b> During the blockade, the 102d did not incur any losses. Starting on 5 December 1961 the 102d began deploying to Wheelus Air Base, Libya for gunnery training.|$|E
5|$|German close {{air support}} also began to take its toll, forcing units such as the Soviet 38th Army onto the defensive. It ranged over the front, {{operating}} dangerously close to the changing frontline. <b>Air</b> <b>interdiction</b> and direct ground support damaged Soviet supply lines and rear areas, also inflicting large losses on their armoured formations. General Franz Halder remarked the air attacks {{went a long way}} to breaking the Soviet offensive. The Soviet air force could do very little to stop these air attacks. Not only did the Luftwaffe attack the enemy, it also carried out vital supply missions. Bombers dropped supplies to encircled German units, which could continue to hold out until a counter-offensive relieved them. Over the course of the 16-day battle the German 6th Air Corps {{played a major role in}} the German victory, conducting 15,648 sorties (978 per day), dropping 7,700 tons of bombs on the Soviet forces and lifting 1,545 tons of material to the front.|$|E
5|$|In January 1942 it {{was decided}} that the limit of {{long-range}} aircraft endurance should be the crew’s limits, (due to extreme aircrew fatigue seriously effecting efficiency) not the fuel supply of the aircraft. De la Ferté decided, on 7 January, sorties should not exceed 14 hours, which reduced flying hours by four per mission. This was despite the entry of the very long-range Liberators in June 1941. The Liberator Mk I had a stated Air Ministry range of 2,720 miles, but crew endurance methods now meant it would be airborne for just 2,240. De la Ferté wrote to the Ministry arguing the Liberator should be used for reconnaissance work, rather than bomb load for the solitary squadron being accepted at that time. The Liberator would assist in closing the 'Mid-Atlantic Gap' which U-boats could operate in without worrying about <b>air</b> <b>interdiction.</b> After replacing Bowhill in 1941, de la Ferté had issued a directive on 12 June 1941 to use Wellingtons and Whitleys as an interim solution to unrestricted submarine warfare now practised by the Germans. Their uneconomical operational cost meant immediate replacement of these medium-range machines was pressing. Some Avro Lancasters and Halifaxes, with some difficulty, were seconded from Bomber Command.|$|E

5|$|James H. Doolittle {{commanding}} Northwest African Strategic Air Force (NASAF) {{was ordered}} to formulate an <b>air</b> <b>interdiction</b> campaign. He named it Operation Flax. Operation Flax called for Allied fighters to intercept the aerial convoys over the Sicily-Tunisia strait. Allied units were also briefed to carry out major offensive operations against Axis airfields in Tunisia and the overcrowded staging fields in Sicily. They were also ordered to carry out anti—shipping sweeps. Flax was an operation which was unlikely to work {{more than a few}} times, as shown by the relative impunity with which the surviving Axis air transports operated at night after the operation had begun. The flight time across the Strait of Sicily was so short that aerial interception could be made only with precise intelligence. The Germans understood this but did not know that their communications had been compromised and were being read by Allied intelligence. Ignorant of their intelligence leaks, they operated by day. Since their enemy had the option of flying by night, and the weather conditions were not ideal for interception operations, the Allies delayed the implementation of Operation Flax until the most German transport aircraft were in operation so that the blow would be as decisive as possible. Allied intelligence listened in to the Y-stations until they were sure they could strike.|$|E
5|$|Fighting {{throughout}} the front did not cease entirely {{for the rest}} of the day, most of it taking part around the besieged Israeli defences and strongpoints that still resisted. Meanwhile, the Sa'iqa units airdropped into Sinai the previous day began engaging Israeli reserves heading for the front. The main areas of operation were the central mountain passes, the northern coastal routes, and near the Gulf of Suez. One battalion, transported in 18 helicopters, captured the Ras Sidr Pass south of Port Tawfiq, near the Gulf of Suez. En route four helicopters were shot down, but the survivors, including 9 crewmen, managed to regroup with the rest of the battalion. It held its position for the remainder of the war under extremely difficult conditions, preventing Israeli reserves from using the pass to reach the front. Two companies attempted to establish themselves in central Sinai, between Tasa and Bir Gifgafa. Israeli <b>air</b> <b>interdiction</b> resulted in six helicopter making a forced landing after being hit, while two helicopters turned and withdrew. The forced landings incurred many casualties, particularly due to burns, and the survivors trekked their way back to friendly lines. Only four helicopters reached the designated landing zone, and they could not be flown once more, indicating the suicidal nature of these operations. Albeit a third of their original force, the Sa'iqa managed to block Israeli reserves for over eight hours. Both companies were almost completely destroyed, suffering around 150 dead, including 15 officers. Israeli estimates claim to have downed between ten and twenty helicopters on the first day of the war.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Hornets saw {{combat in}} several roles during the Iraq War. Following the {{outbreak}} of war on 20 March, No.75 Squadron was initially used to escort high-value Coalition aircraft, such as tankers and airborne early warning and control aircraft. As it rapidly {{became clear that the}} Iraqi Air Force posed no threat, from 21 March No.75 Squadron also began to also conduct <b>air</b> <b>interdiction</b> sorties against Iraqi forces. These sorties were initially flown in support of the United States Army's V Corps, but the squadron was rarely assigned any targets to attack. As a result, the Australian commanders in the Middle East had No.75 Squadron reassigned to support the United States Marine Corps' I Marine Expeditionary Force. At this time the squadron also began flying close air support sorties. During {{the first two weeks of}} the war the squadron typically flew 12 sorties per day. To avoid pilot fatigue, additional aircrew were posted to the Middle East from Australia. The number of sorties dropped to between six and ten per day from 5 April onwards as the American forces closed on Baghdad and few targets remained in southern Iraq. On 12 April, No.75 Squadron supported elements of the Special Air Service Regiment and 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, which occupied Al Asad Airbase. During the last weeks of the war the squadron continued to fly sorties across western, central and southern Iraq to support British and American forces. In several of the squadron's operations in the final week of the war, the Hornets made low altitude and high speed passes over Iraqi positions to encourage their defenders to surrender. No.75 Squadron conducted its final combat sorties on 27 April. During the war the squadron flew 350 combat missions (including 670 individual sorties) and dropped 122 laser-guided bombs. No.75 Squadron did not suffer any casualties, and all 14 Hornets returned to Tindal on 14 May 2003.|$|E
50|$|Missions of the 3d TFW {{included}} close air support, counterinsurgency, forward <b>air</b> control, <b>interdiction,</b> and radar-controlled bombing. Supported numerous {{ground operations}} with strike missions against enemy fortifications, supply areas, {{lines of communication}} and personnel, in addition to suppressing fire in landing areas.|$|R
50|$|The 5th Fighter Wing {{eventually}} {{acquired the}} jet-powered, twin-engined, F-5A/B Freedom Fighter supersonic aircraft, which ushered the Philippine Air Force into the supersonic jet age. This positioned the 5th Fighter Wing as the spearhead of defense, responsible for <b>air</b> reconnaissance, <b>interdiction</b> and ground support.|$|R

25|$|A second {{objective}} for the PAF was {{to conduct}} <b>air</b> <b>interdiction</b> against the supply routes for the Indian troops opposing Khan's proposed offensive, {{but these were}} accorded as secondary targets to be engaged after the operation started.|$|E
25|$|On the 17th the squadron's {{sector was}} changed {{and it began}} patrolling between the Argonne and Verdun, and its mission was changed from <b>air</b> <b>interdiction</b> to ground support of {{advancing}} Army forces, normally flying below 800 meters. The first task was to shoot down German observation balloons.|$|E
25|$|The Portuguese Air Force {{operated}} the A-7 {{primarily in the}} tactical air support for maritime operations and <b>air</b> <b>interdiction</b> roles, with air defense and counter air operations as a secondary role. These aircraft were operated by 302 Squadron, replacing the F-86F Sabre, and 304 Squadron, later created to operate the A-7, and served alongside the Fiat G.91 until this aircraft's retirement in 1993.|$|E

25|$|The Portuguese Air Force (PoAF) {{operated}} 50 LTV A-7 Corsair II {{aircraft in}} the anti-ship, <b>air</b> <b>interdiction</b> and air defense roles between 1981 and 1999. The Portuguese government acquired the Corsair II to replace the PoAF's North American F-86 Sabre fighters, with two orders being placed {{for a total of}} 50 A-7P and TA-7P. As part of the program one TA-7C belonging to the United States Navy was also loaned to the PoAF.|$|E
25|$|Between 28–30 October, the 101st TFS {{departed}} Logan International Airport to Phalsbourg, France. The wing deployed 82 Sabres {{across the}} Atlantic. In addition two C-47 Skytrains and six T-33 Shooting Star aircraft {{were assigned to}} the wing for support and training purposes. The 101st's primary mission at the time was to provide close air support to NATO ground forces and <b>air</b> <b>interdiction.</b> Starting on December 5, the 102nd began deploying to Wheelus Air Base, Libya for gunnery training.|$|E
25|$|Under the Joint Force Harrier organisation, {{both the}} RAF and RN {{operated}} the Harrier II, including routine operational deployments {{on board the}} navy's Invincible class aircraft carriers. The Harrier II participated in numerous conflicts, making significant contributions in combat theatres such as Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan. The type's main function was as a platform for <b>air</b> <b>interdiction</b> and close air support missions; the Harrier II was also used for presence projection and reconnaissance duties. The Harrier II served alongside the Sea Harrier in Joint Force Harrier.|$|E
50|$|During {{its time}} in Vietnam, the 355th flew more than 17,000 combat sorties flying close <b>air</b> support, <b>interdiction,</b> search and rescue, and {{helicopter}} support missions. The squadron {{was awarded the}} Presidential Unit Citation. the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award, and the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Palm for its service.|$|R
50|$|In May 1968, {{the wing}} {{was the first}} to use laser-guided bombs (LGBs) in combat. During its final years of combat, the 8th TFW used B-57s for night attacks, AC-130 gunships for ground support and armed reconnaissance, and F-4Ds for fast-forward <b>air</b> control, <b>interdiction,</b> escort, armed reconnaissance, and other special missions.|$|R
50|$|Inactivated at Myrtle Beach on 31 March 1992, the 355 FS was {{reactivated}} on 20 August 1993, {{replacing the}} inactivating 11th Tactical Air Support Squadron at Eleison AFB, Alaska. The unit's primary missions included air strike control, close <b>air</b> support, <b>interdiction,</b> joint <b>air</b> attack team, escort, and combat search and rescue.|$|R
25|$|In March 1981, the USAF {{announced}} the Enhanced Tactical Fighter (ETF) program to procure {{a replacement for}} the F-111. The program was later renamed the Dual-Role Fighter (DRF) competition. The concept envisioned an aircraft capable of launching deep <b>air</b> <b>interdiction</b> missions without requiring additional support by fighter escort or jamming. General Dynamics submitted the F-16XL, while McDonnell Douglas submitted the F-15E. The Panavia Tornado was also a candidate, but since the aircraft lacked a credible air superiority fighter capability, coupled {{with the fact that}} it is not American-made, it was not seriously considered.|$|E
25|$|It {{was during}} the {{critical}} campaigns in Egypt and Libya during 1942 that Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder, as Air Commander-in-Chief of RAF Middle East, successfully coordinated his strategic, coastal, and tactical air forces consisting primarily of No. 205 (Heavy Bomber) Group, No. 201 (Naval Co-operation) Group, and especially Air Vice Marshal Arthur Coningham's Air Headquarters (AHQ) Western Desert, respectively. The success of the Tedder-Coningham <b>air</b> <b>interdiction</b> during the desert war was the model upon which the Northwest African Air Forces were created at the Casablanca Conference in January 1943.|$|E
25|$|Campaign 139 {{had marked}} the first use of {{combined}} arms in the Laotian Civil War. Campaign 74B was the second combined arms assault, though somewhat fewer troops were allotted for 74B. The PAVN units for 74B had previously fought in Campaign 139 over the same ground. They consisted of the 316th PAVN Division, the 866th Independent Regiment, the 165th Regiment from the 312th PAVN Division, and three Dac Cong sapper battalions, backed by artillery and tanks. The major difference was that all, not part, of the 312th Division had participated in Campaign 139. Another difference was the shortage of ammunition for the PAVN caused by <b>air</b> <b>interdiction</b> of Communist supply lines.|$|E
50|$|Operations {{included}} {{close and}} direct <b>air</b> support, <b>interdiction,</b> combat airlift, aerial resupply, visual and photographic reconnaissance, unconventional warfare, counterinsurgency operations, psychological warfare (including leaflet dropping and aerial broadcasting), forward air control operations and escort, search and rescue, escort for convoy and defoliation operations, flare drops, civic actions, and humanitarian actions.|$|R
50|$|At Cam Ranh Bay {{the wing}} carried out close <b>air</b> support, <b>interdiction,</b> and combat <b>air</b> patrol {{activities}} over both Vietnams and Laos. Following {{the capture of}} the USS Pueblo, the aircraft of the 391 TFS {{were assigned to the}} 558 TFS and sent TDY as a detachment to augment the 475 TFW in South Korea.|$|R
50|$|From Cam Ranh AB {{the wing}} carried out close <b>air</b> support, <b>interdiction,</b> and combat <b>air</b> patrol {{activities}} over both Vietnam and Laos. Following {{the capture of}} the USS Pueblo, the 558th TFS was sent on temporary duty to augment the 475th TFW in South Korea. When that later became a permanent assignment, the 558th and 391st traded designations.|$|R
25|$|The Marine {{observation}} squadrons {{were formed}} {{during the latter}} stages of World War II with the primary mission of forward air control of strike aircraft for close air support and <b>air</b> <b>interdiction.</b> They saw extensive service during the Vietnam War flying the North American OV-10 Bronco. The Marine Corps began decommissioning the VMO squadrons following their participation in Operation Desert Storm as turboprop-driven aircraft were being perceived {{in the wake of}} that conflict as being too vulnerable to surface-to-air missiles, especially shoulder-launched man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS), to fly over modern battlefields. Their mission has been assumed by the VMFA(AW) squadrons flying the F/A-18D Hornet.|$|E
25|$|No. 75 Squadron's initial {{role was}} to escort high-value Coalition {{aircraft}} such as tankers and AWACS aircraft. As {{it became clear that}} the Iraqi Air Force posed no threat, the role of No. 75 Squadron shifted to providing close air support to Coalition ground forces and <b>air</b> <b>interdiction</b> against Iraqi forces. These missions were initially flown in support of the US Army but the Squadron later switched to supporting the US Marines. As organized Baathist resistance crumbled, the F/A-18s were increasingly tasked to provide 'shows of force' to encourage Iraqi forces to surrender. During the war No. 75 Squadron flew a total of 350 sorties and dropped 122 laser-guided bombs.|$|E
25|$|The group {{occasionally}} flew <b>air</b> <b>interdiction</b> and {{air support}} missions. It helped {{to prepare for}} the invasion of Normandy by bombing airfields, V-1 and V-2 launch sites, and other targets. The unit attacked shore installations on D-Day, 6 June 1944 with 81 sorties and supported ground forces at Saint-Lô by striking enemy defenses in July 1944. During the Battle of the Bulge, between December 1944 and January 1945 it bombed German communications. Early on 24 March 1945 the 445th dropped food, medical supplies, and ammunition to troops that landed near Wesel during the airborne assault across the Rhine and that afternoon flew a bombing mission to the same area, hitting a landing ground at Stormede.|$|E
50|$|The seventh of September also {{marked the}} day when the PAF {{attacked}} IAF airfields in the Eastern Sector. During the PAF's raid on Kalaikunda, Indian pilot Flight Lieutenant A T Cooke engaged 3 PAF Sabres, shooting down one and badly damaging the second sabre, by this time, Cooke had no ammunition left but he successfully chased away the third sabre. His wingman engaged the remaining one sabre and shoot it down. The war lessened in intensity after 8 September, with occasional clashes between the IAF and the PAF. Both air forces now changed their doctrine from <b>air</b> <b>interdictions</b> to ground attack and concentrated their efforts on knocking out soft skin targets and supply lines, such as wagons carrying ammunition; and armoured vehicles. During the conflict IAF English Electric Canberras raided a few of the Pakistani bases. On 10 September one Mystere was downed by anti-aircraft fire in Pakistan but the pilot ejected safely.|$|R
50|$|Calendar Year 2000 {{began with}} the 335th and 336th {{deployment}} of 22 F-15Es and over 350 personnel in support of exercise RED FLAG, 5 to 19 February. Both squadrons performed Offensive Counter <b>Air</b> and <b>Interdiction</b> roles in a day/night high-threat scenario. Additionally, the 4th covered the core unit responsibilities for seventy additional personnel from various base support agencies during RED FLAG, including the Deployed Force Commander and Deputy Deployed Force Commander.|$|R
50|$|During the Vietnam War, {{the wing}} moved in November 1965 to Bien Hoa Air Base, South Vietnam, a forward {{operating}} base, which frequently came under enemy mortar and rocket fire. Missions included close air support, counterinsurgency, forward <b>air</b> control, <b>interdiction,</b> and radar-controlled bombing. Supported numerous ground operations with strike missions against enemy fortifications, supply areas, {{lines of communication}} and personnel, in addition to suppressing fire in landing areas.|$|R
