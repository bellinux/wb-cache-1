5|$|In recent years, a {{combination}} of drought and regulatory decisions passed based on the Endangered Species Act of 1973 have forced Reclamation to turn off much of the water for {{the west side of}} the San Joaquin Valley in order to protect the fragile ecosystem in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> alive the dwindling fish populations of Central Valley rivers.|$|E

5|$|Starfish do {{not appear}} to have any {{mechanisms}} for osmoregulation, <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> their body fluids at the same salt concentration as the surrounding water. Although some species can tolerate relatively low salinity, the lack of an osmoregulation system probably explains why starfish are not found in fresh water or even in many estuarine environments.|$|E
5|$|Stevens {{employed}} low-fidelity recording equipment, {{which allowed}} him to retain creative control <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> costs low on recording Illinois. Typically, his process involved recording to 32kHz 8-track tape using inexpensive microphones such as the Shure SM57 and AKG C1000. He then employed Pro Tools for mixing and other production tasks.|$|E

5|$|A new keep was built, {{probably}} in the 13th century. This {{took the form of}} a polygonal shell keep, with fourteen triangular buttresses supporting six foot (1.8 m) thick walls. The inner bailey was strengthened with new stone walls, 20 to 30 feet (6 to 9 m) tall on top of the earlier earth banks, the walls <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> being built of flint and rubble. The castle was manned during this period by a castle-guard system, in which lands were given out to local lords in return for their providing knights and soldiers to serve at the castle.|$|E
5|$|A {{waterfall}} bong (or {{reverse bucket}} bong) is another method of smoking. It is assembled using a large plastic bottle (preferably about 2 liter), a bung or rubber stopper, a brass cut nozzle {{to act as}} a bowl <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> the marijuana (or other herbs) from entering the bottle, and an aerator screen. Once the bottle is filled to its neck in water the lid is screwed on, removing the rubber stopper and igniting the contents of the bowl leads to draining water to cause smoke to be drawn into the bottle. The cap is removed after the water has completely drained out, allowing the user to inhale the smoke.|$|E
5|$|All the New Spain {{flotilla}} arrived safely at Vera Cruz during February and March 1553. The {{plan was}} to scrap eleven of the vessels <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> only five to make the return journey. This was typical. Ships from the Americas to Spain carried a much smaller volume of cargo than ships traveling in the other direction, although the shipments to Spain included valuable gold and silver.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{all species}} are hermaphrodites, {{in other words}} each {{individual}} can function as both male and female. Some are simultaneous hermaphrodites, which can produce both eggs and sperm at the same time, while others are sequential hermaphrodites, in which the eggs and sperm mature at different times. The gonads {{are located in the}} parts of the internal canal network under the comb rows, and eggs and sperm are released via pores in the epidermis. Fertilization is generally external, but platyctenids use internal fertilization <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> the eggs in brood chambers until they hatch. Self-fertilization has occasionally been seen in species of the genus Mnemiopsis, and it is thought that most of the hermaphroditic species are self-fertile.|$|E
5|$|Anticipating high sales, Nintendo set {{its first}} {{production}} shipment {{for the games}} in Japan at three million, predicting that eventually more than eight million copies would be sold in the country alone. However, they were soon forced to cut the first shipment number in half following an earthquake in Taiwan, which Nintendo claimed had damaged their cartridge manufacturing facilities. Regardless, speculation arose that Nintendo was instead using the event {{as an excuse to}} limit shipment <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> the demand high.|$|E
5|$|Army Group North {{had already}} {{considered}} abandoning Estonia in February 1944, during the Soviet Kingisepp-Gdov Offensive. A {{large number of}} units would have been freed up with changes to the front, but the Narva front continued to be defended on Hitler's orders. The German Command considered it important to maintain control over the southern shore of the Gulf of Finland to ease the situation in Finland <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> the Soviet Baltic Fleet trapped in the eastern bay of the gulf. The retention of the oil shale reserves and oil shale industry in Ida-Viru was important for economic reasons.|$|E

5|$|As the Canadians began {{preparations}} for an assault, the Germans {{were in the}} process of executing an assault plan of their own. The XIII (Royal Württemberg) Corps spent six weeks planning and carefully preparing their attack on the Mount Sorrel, Tor Top (Hill 62) and Hill 61 peaks. Their objective was to take control of the observation positions east of Ypres <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> as many British units as possible pinned down in the area, to avoid them transferring to the Somme front and assisting with the observed build-up in that area. The Germans constructed practice trenches resembling the Canadian positions near Tor Top to rehearse the assault, well behind their own lines.|$|E
5|$|As {{the largest}} Canadian cities {{grew in the}} 1950s and 1960s, the volume of mail passing through the country's postal system also grew, to billions of items by the 1950s and {{tens of billions of}} items by the mid-1960s. Consequently, it became {{progressively}} more difficult for employees who handsorted mail to memorize <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> track of all the individual letter-carrier routes within each city. New technology that allowed mail to be delivered faster also contributed to the pressure for these employees to properly sort the mail.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the second quarter, the Hokies' defense began to stiffen. Aided by a 10-yard holding penalty against the Eagles, Matt Ryan was forced to complete a 14-yard pass on 4th-and-9 to earn a first down <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> the drive alive. Three incomplete passes followed, however, and the Eagles again settled for a field goal attempt. This time, the 37-yard kick sailed through the uprights, giving Boston College a 100 lead with 11:20 remaining in the first half.|$|E

5|$|Built in {{a modernist}} style, the {{building}} {{has been the subject}} of vigorous public debate about its heritage value. Some parties, such as the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, consider the building to be an important example of modernist architecture in the city, whilst others consider it ugly. These conflicting views led to animosity in the 1990s, when the State Government refused to heritage list the property, and instead recommended its demolition. Despite this, the City of Perth opted to renovate the tower <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> it as its headquarters. Following this, the building was admitted to the State's Heritage Register.|$|E
5|$|During {{his reign}} as emperor, Caracalla raised the annual pay {{of an average}} legionary from 2000 sesterces (500 denarii) to 2700–3000 sesterces (675–750 denarii). He lavished many {{benefits}} on the army, which he both feared and admired, {{in accordance with the}} advice given by his father on his deathbed always to heed the welfare of the soldiers and ignore everyone else. Caracalla needed to gain <b>and</b> <b>keep</b> the trust of the military, and he did so with generous pay raises and popular gestures. He spent much of his time with the soldiers, so much so that he began to imitate their dress and adopt their manners.|$|E
