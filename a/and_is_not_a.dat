5|$|In the European Union, animal {{sources are}} governed by Council Directive 86/609/EEC, which {{requires}} lab animals to be specially bred, unless the animal has been lawfully imported <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> wild animal or a stray. The latter requirement may also be exempted by special arrangement. In 2010 the Directive was revised with EU Directive 2010/63/EU. In the UK, most animals used in experiments are bred for the purpose under the 1988 Animal Protection Act, but wild-caught primates may be used if exceptional and specific justification can be established. The United States also allows the use of wild-caught primates; between 1995 and 1999, 1,580 wild baboons were imported into the U.S. Over half the primates imported between 1995 and 2000 were handled by Charles River Laboratories, or by Covance, which is the single largest importer of primates into the U.S.|$|E

5|$|Lanthanum-140 has a short {{half-life}} of some 41 hours, <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> threat after {{a fairly}} short time. Other radioisotopes, present as impurities, {{have a long}} enough half-life to present a potential problem even decades after the tests; in 2002 the Los Alamos National Laboratory issued a warning to the Los Alamos county and the Forest Service performing thinning of trees {{in the area to}} not remove the trees cut {{in various parts of the}} Bayo Canyon due to possible content of residual radioactive materials. The worst affected zones are fenced off; detectable levels of radioisotopes are present in the soil, insects and trees in the surrounding areas. The neighbouring population was not informed about the tests until the mid-1990s, and Los Alamos refused to declassify the documentation.|$|E
5|$|Researchers at the University of L'Aquila, using ultrasonography, {{presented}} {{evidence that}} women who experience vaginal orgasms are statistically {{more likely to have}} thicker tissue in the anterior vaginal wall. The researchers believe these findings make it possible for women to have a rapid test to confirm whether or not they have a G-spot. Professor of genetic epidemiology, Tim Spector, who co-authored research questioning the existence of the G-spot and finalized it in 2009, also hypothesizes thicker tissue in the G-spot area; he states that this tissue may be part of the clitoris <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> separate erogenous zone.|$|E

These salaries per annum reflected the living costs of the day; however today the amount is seen only as nominal payment. In addition to their official duties, the heralds have for many centuries undertaken private practice in heraldry and genealogy, for which professional fees are charged.|$|E

5|$|The Director General of the Indian Coast Guard (DG ICG) is {{the head}} of the Indian Coast Guard. The DG ICG has their office in the Coast Guard Headquarters (CGHQ) in New Delhi.

The Director General is {{assisted}} by four Deputy Directors General, each holding the rank of inspector-general, and other senior officers heading various staff divisions.

The post of Director General of the Indian Coast Guard is held by a three-star rank holder as a position <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> rank in itself. It is a Commander-in-Chief grade and is equivalent to Vice Admiral of the Indian Navy, Lieutenant General of the Indian Army and the Air Marshal of the Indian Air Force. The rank of Additional Director General of the Indian Coast Guard is equivalent to vice admiral of Higher Administrative Grade of the Indian Navy.|$|E
5|$|For example, Avicenna gives a {{philosophical}} {{justification for the}} Islamic doctrine of tawhid (oneness of God) by showing the uniqueness and simplicity of the necessary existent. He argues that the necessary existent must be unique, using a proof by contradiction, or reductio, showing that a contradiction would follow if one supposes {{that there were more}} than one necessary existent. If one postulates two necessary existents, A and B, a simplified version of the argument considers two possibilities: if A is distinct from B as a result of something implied from necessity of existence, then B would share it, too (being a necessary existent itself), and the two are not distinct after all. If, on the other hand, the distinction resulted from something not implied by necessity of existence, then this individuating factor will be a cause for A, and this means that A has a cause <b>and</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> necessary existent after all. Either way, the opposite proposition resulted in contradiction, which to Avicenna proves the correctness of the argument. Avicenna argued that the necessary existent must be simple (not a composite) by a similar reductio strategy. If it were a composite, its internal parts would need a feature that distinguishes each from the others. The distinguishing feature cannot be solely derived from the parts' necessity of existence, because then they would both have the same feature and not be distinct: a contradiction. But it also cannot be accidental, or requiring an outside cause, because this would contradict its necessity of existence.|$|E
