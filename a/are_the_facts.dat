5|$|The {{foundation}} of Shamrock Rovers is disputed amongst {{supporters of the}} club. No official documentation of the era exists. For many years the earliest known mention of the club in the newspaper archives at the National Library of Ireland came from 1901 and {{an article in the}} club programme from 28 December 1941 claims that the club was founded in this year. Research by the Shamrock Rovers Heritage Trust uncovered a very brief report in the Evening Herald from April 1899 on a match between Shamrock Rovers and Rosemount, has established that the club was in existence from at least that time. The only two certainties about the origins of the club in relation to what year they were formed <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> that, Rovers played only exhibition games for {{the first two years of}} their existence and the club registered with the Leinster Football Association in 1901. Essentially, the dispute is over whether the two years of exhibition games were played before or after the registration. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, the date 1899 was written on the gates of Glenmalure Park but since the 1990s, 1901 had been adopted as the founding year by the various regimes which have run the club. In light of the discovery of evidence supporting a founding date before April 1899 the club opened a 1899 Suite in Tallaght Stadium in February 2017.|$|E

2500|$|The Aggadah records many miracles {{performed}} by Phinehas. Among these {{is that of}} having passed on dry ground through the River Ginai, which he had to cross {{on his way to}} ransom prisoners (Yer. Demai i. 3). According to another version, Phinehas performed this miracle while he was going to the school to deliver a lecture. His pupils, who had followed him, asked if they might without danger cross the river by the same way, whereupon Phinehas answered: [...] "Only those who have never offended any one may do so" [...] (Hullin 7a). To Phinehas is attributed the authorship of a later midrash entitled Tadshe or Baraita de-Rabbi Pinehas ben Ya'ir. The only reasons for this ascription <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> (1) that the midrash begins with Phinehas' explanation of Gen. , from which the work derives its name, and (2) that its seventh chapter commences with a saying of his on the tree of knowledge. Phinehas was buried in Kefar Biram.|$|E
2500|$|Russell who {{did much}} of the early work on the Edge geology, mainly in {{relation}} to the mining activities said, “It is impossible to give even a rough estimate [...] be said with certainty that the walls of the chambers and drives would yield some tens of thousands of tons of ore averaging 1.3% of copper. ... A more definite statement cannot be made since the ore is exposed {{on the sides of the}} workings only and has not been [...] "blocked out", the system in the past having been to follow the richest ... impregnation while leaving the poorer rock standing.” This statement is as true today as when written the distributions of the ore bodies and the fine dissemination makes accurate quantitative analysis difficult. The dissemination would on its own make the working of the ore economically unviable anyway. Further to the economics <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> that most of the area is owned by the National Trust and it is designated by Government as a SSSI (Site of Special and Scientific Interest) for its geological value ...|$|E
2500|$|The Reverend Leonard Jenyns, {{a naturalist}} Darwin had known since {{his time at}} the University of Cambridge, had at Darwin's request contributed the volume on Fish in Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle, and was now {{working on a book}} of notes on {{observations}} of plants and animals. On 12 October Darwin wrote to tell him that [...] "work on the species question has impressed me very forcibly with the importance of all such works, as your intended one, containing what people are pleased generally to call trifling facts. These <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts,</b> which make one understand the working or œconomy of nature.... namely what are the checks & what the periods of life, by which the increase of any given species is limited." [...] He told Jenyns that he had [...] "continued steadily reading & collecting facts on variation of domestic animals & plants & on the question of what are species; I have a grand body of facts & I think I can draw some sound conclusions. The general conclusion at which I have slowly been driven from a directly opposite conviction is that species are mutable & that allied species are co-descendants of common stocks. I know how much I open myself, to reproach, for such a conclusion, but I have at least honestly & deliberately come to it. I shall not publish on this subject for several years." [...] In November he thanked Jenyns for sending a detailed note, and told him [...] "With respect to my far-distant work on species, I must have expressed myself with singular inaccuracy, if I led you to suppose that I meant to say that my conclusions were inevitable. They have become so, after years of weighing puzzles, to myself alone;; but in my wildest day-dream, I never expect more than to be able to show that there are two sides {{to the question of the}} immutability of species, ie whether species are directly created, or by intermediate laws, (as with the life & death of individuals)." [...] He outlined the events that had led him to these ideas, and while cautious about [...] "numerous immense difficulties on my notions" [...] told him that he had [...] "drawn up a sketch & had it copied (in 200 pages) of my conclusions; & if I thought at some future time, that you would think it worth reading, I shd. of course be most thankful to have the criticism of so competent a critic." [...] Jenyns never took up this offer to read the [...] "Essay", but did advise Darwin on possible issues with the term [...] "mutation". Darwin replied [...] "it will be years before I publish, so that I shall have plenty of time to think of better words".|$|E
