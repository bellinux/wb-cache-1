2500|$|The {{team was}} {{returning}} from a European Cup match in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, having eliminated Red Star Belgrade {{to advance to the}} semi-finals of the competition. The flight stopped to refuel in Munich because a non-stop flight from Belgrade to Manchester was beyond the [...] "Elizabethan"-class Airspeed Ambassador's range. After refuelling, pilots James Thain and Kenneth Rayment twice <b>abandoned</b> <b>take-off</b> because of boost surging in the left engine. Fearing they would get too far behind schedule, Captain Thain rejected an overnight stay in Munich in favour of a third take-off attempt. By then, snow was falling, causing a layer of slush to form {{at the end of the}} runway. After the aircraft hit the slush, it ploughed through a fence beyond the end of the runway and the left wing was torn off after hitting a house. Fearing the aircraft might explode, Thain began evacuating passengers while Manchester United goalkeeper Harry Gregg helped pull survivors from the wreckage.|$|E
5000|$|The {{prototype}} {{became part}} of 603 training squadron which was located at Grab, near Trebinje during the April war. It was damaged and <b>abandoned</b> attempting to <b>take-off</b> from Grab on 12 April 1941. A month later, the Germans took control and sold the machine to the Croats who {{had taken over the}} 'Ikarus' factory. They renamed the aircraft [...] "Независни" [...] ("Independent"); after repairs, a test flight was carried out on 19 May 1942.|$|R
2500|$|Thain {{had flown}} the [...] "Elizabethan"-class Airspeed Ambassador (registration G-ALZU) to Belgrade but handed the {{controls}} to Rayment for the return. At 14:19 GMT, the control tower at Munich {{was told the}} plane was ready to take off and gave clearance for take-off, expiring at 14:31. Rayment <b>abandoned</b> the <b>take-off</b> after Thain noticed the port boost pressure gauge fluctuating as the plane reached full power and the engine sounded odd while accelerating. A second attempt was made three minutes later, but called off 40 seconds into the attempt because the engines were running on an over-rich mixture, causing them to over-accelerate, a common problem for the [...] "Elizabethan". After the second failure, passengers retreated to the airport lounge. By then, it had started to snow heavily, and it looked unlikely that the plane would be making the return journey that day. Manchester United's Duncan Edwards sent a telegram to his landlady in Manchester. It read: [...] "All flights cancelled, flying tomorrow. Duncan." ...|$|R
2500|$|On 1 December 1969, Boeing 707-321B N892PA of Pan Am Flight 812 overran {{the runway}} during {{take-off}} due to bird strikes. The accident investigation {{established that the}} aircraft struck a flock of seagulls, {{with a minimum of}} 11 individual bird strikes to the leading edges of the wings and engines 1, 2, and 3. In particular, blade 14 of number 2 engine was damaged by a single bird carcass and lost power before the decision to <b>abandon</b> the <b>take-off</b> (which occurred at or near V1 or takeoff decision speed). The aircraft came to rest [...] beyond the end of runway 34 (now runway 34L). During the crash, number 2 engine hit the ground and was damaged. The nose and left main landing gears failed and the aircraft came to rest supported by engines 1 and 2, the nose, and the remainder of the main landing gear. There were no injuries or fatalities amongst the 125 passengers and 11 crew. The accident investigation concluded that the overrun was not inevitable.|$|R
