40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we propose a method for the {{allocation}} of fixed (capital and non-variable operation and maintenance) costs at the medium voltage (MV) distribution level. The method is derived from the philosophy behind the widely used MWmile methodology for transmission networks that bases <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> allocations on the “extent of use ” that is derived from load flows. We calculate the “extent of use ” by multiplying the total consumption or generation at a busbar by the marginal current variations, or power to current distribution factors (PIDFs) that an increment of active and reactive power consumed, or generated in the case of distributed generation, at each busbar, produces in each circuit. These PIDFs are analogous to power transfer distribution factors (PTDFs). Unlike traditional tariff designs that <b>average</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> on a per kWh basis across all customers, the proposed method provides more cost reflective price signals and helps eliminate possible cross-subsidies that deter profitable (in the case of competition) or cost-effective (in the case of a fully regulated industry) deployment of DG by directly accounting for use and location in the allocation of <b>fixed</b> <b>costs.</b> An application of this method for a rural radial distribution network is presented.

5000|$|Both the SRAC and LRAC curves are {{typically}} expressed as U-shaped. [...] However, {{the shapes of}} the curves are not due to the same factors. For the short run curve the initial downward slope is largely due to declining <b>average</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>costs.</b> Increasing returns to the variable input at low levels of production also play a role, while the upward slope is due to diminishing marginal returns to the variable input. With the long run curve the shape by definition reflects economies and diseconomies of scale. At low levels of production long run production functions generally exhibit increasing returns to scale, which, for firms that are perfect competitors in input markets, means that the long run average cost is falling; the upward slope of the long run average cost function at higher levels of output is due to decreasing returns to scale at those output levels.|$|R
50|$|An {{implicit}} {{assumption of}} the above rules is that all <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> are sunk costs. When some costs are sunk and some are not sunk, total <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> (TFC) equal sunk <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> (SFC) plus non-sunk <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> (NSFC) or TFC = SFC + NSFC. When some <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> are non-sunk, the shutdown rule must be modified. As Besanko notes, to illustrate the new rule {{it is necessary to}} define a new cost curve, the average non-sunk cost curve, or ANSC. The ANSC equals the average variable costs plus the <b>average</b> non-sunk <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> or ANSC = AVC + ANFC. The new rule then becomes: if the price is greater than the minimum average costs, produce; if the price is between minimum average costs and minimum ANSC produce, and if the price is less than minimum ANSC for all levels of production, shut down. If all <b>fixed</b> <b>costs</b> are non-sunk, then (a competitive) firm would shut down if the price were below average total costs.|$|R

5000|$|Elasticity {{is defined}} as the degree of receptiveness in demand and supply in {{relation}} to fluctuations in price. If a curve is more elastic then lesser alterations in price will result to a higher change in quantity used up. If a curve is less elastic it will then cause higher deviations in price to affect a change in amount consumed. Price elasticity of demand is the extent of responsiveness in quantity demanded in relation to price. Utility on the other hand is the amount of contentment resulting from the consumption of a commodity or services at a particular period. Utility is a psychological satisfaction not inherent. It is dependent on the persons own subjective approximate of satisfaction to be acquired from the consumption of a commodity. Utility is further divided into marginal utility, total utility and maximizing utility. Marginal utility refers to the extra utility resulting from the consumption of one extra unit of a commodity, the consumption {{of the rest of the}} goods remaining unaffected. Total utility is refers to as the number of units of utility that a consumer gains from consuming a given quantity of a good, service, or activity during a particular time period. The greater a consumers total utility, the larger the customer’s level of consumption.The cost to any firm of producing any output evidently depends upon the physical amounts of real resources. For instance material, labour and machine hours used in production. As the larger output needs a larger amount of resources, the total cost for larger output becomes high. Whereas the smaller output requires the smaller resources. The total cost for smaller output becomes smaller. A company can produce at lower cost when it produces better new techniques to products. Production with traditional and old method implicates high cost. The maximisation of returns includes the use of a definite technique to produce that can facilitate the optimal combination of factors. Production cost {{is defined as}} the expenditures by a business in producing a commodity. There are several kinds of cost concepts, these are marginal cost, total cost and average cost.Total is the cost of producing a certain output of the product in question. Total cost can be classified into variable cost and fixed cost. Fixed costs is also known as overhead cost. These are costs which do not differ with output. The costs will be the same whether the output is ten or twenty or a thousand of a product. Fixed costs entails interest on bank loans, depreciation of machinery, insurance charges and rent of factory. Variable costs are also called prime cost. Variable costs differ with alterations in output. The greater the output, the bigger the variable costs. Average cost is the cost of each unit of output and is achieved by dividing the total cost by the level of output. It is further divided into two parts, <b>average</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>cost</b> and average variable cost.Marginal cost {{is defined as the}} extra cost incurred by increasing output by one unit. It is the added cost of producing an additional unit of output. Perfect competition is a market structure in which the following characteristics are met. All businesses trade the same commodity, all firms will have a comparatively small market share, all firms are price takers meaning they cannot control the market price of their goods, the industry is characterized by freedom of entry and exit, and buyers have complete information about the product being sold and the prices charged by each firm.Perfect competition is a hypothetical market structure. Under perfect competition there are numerous buyers and sellers and prices reveal supply and demand. Customers will have several substitutes when the commodity they wish to buy quality begins to reduce or if it becomes more expensive. News firms can as well simply enter the market, leading to an extra competition.Monopoly on the other hand is where there is only one supplier in the market. For the reasons of regulation, monopoly power occurs where a single business owns 25% or more of a particular market. Monopolies can form for a number of reasons. For example, government can grant a business monopoly powers, if a firm has exclusive ownership of a limited resource, producers may have patents over designs for instance, giving them rights to trade a good or a service and a merger of two or more firms would create a monopoly. Monopolies have basic characteristics such as, they can maintain super normal returns in the long run, a monopolist with no substitute would be able to develop the greatest monopoly power and with no close substitutes, the monopolist can therefore derive supernormal profits.|$|E

This analysis examines the current efficiency losses from disbursement limitations on Universal Service Fund monies. Universal Service disbursements to high-cost customers are presently {{limited to the}} subsidy of landline and cellular telephone service – limitations that keep disbursements needlessly high and conservatively amount to $ 133 m – $ 600 m in direct losses per annum, and approximately $ 144 m – $ 1. 9 b if welfare effects are considered.

First, the definition of Eligible Telecommunications Carrier (which determines what services are eligible for high-cost subsidy) must be expanded to include services such as satellite telephone, satellite internet, fixed wireless, VOIP, broadband, and combinations thereof. Secondly, the high-cost subsidy must not exceed the cost of the least expensive alternative (ex. if satellite telephone is the cheapest carrier for a rural customer, no more than the monthly fee of satellite telephone with average usage would be subsidized).
