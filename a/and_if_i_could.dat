25|$|Several Australian composers {{have written}} sacred music to {{celebrate}} Mary MacKillop. In 2009 Nicholas Buc {{was commissioned by}} the Shire of Glenelg to write an hour-long cantata mass for the centenary {{of the death of}} Mary MacKillop. It was premiered by the Royal Melbourne Philharmonic in Portland, Victoria. The Mass of Mary McKillop is a setting for congregational singing, composed by Joshua Cowie. Hymns specifically used in St Mary of the Cross celebrations including A Saint for Today and Mary MacKillop, Woman of Australia by Josephite Sister Margaret Cusack, <b>and</b> <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>Could</b> Tell The Love of God, In Love God Leads Us and Psalm 103 by Jesuit Priest Christopher Willcock.|$|E

I am suffering because I am a radical and indeed I am a radical; I have suffered because I am an Italian and indeed I am an Italian...if you could execute me two times, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> be reborn two other times, I would live again to do what I have done already.|$|E
500|$|Lincoln's reply {{would become}} famous, {{much more so}} than the prayer that {{provoked}} it. [...] "My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union." [...] Lincoln's statement angered abolitionists; William Seward's wife Frances complained to her husband that Lincoln had made it seem [...] "that the mere keeping together a number of states is more important than human freedom." [...] Greeley felt Lincoln had not truly answered him, [...] "but I'll forgive him everything if he'll issue the proclamation". When Lincoln did, on September 22, Greeley hailed the Emancipation Proclamation as a [...] "great boon of freedom". According to Williams, [...] "Lincoln's war for Union was now also Greeley's war for emancipation." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{series is}} about the {{residents}} and workers at the fictional Tipton Hotel in Boston and mainly centers around the trouble-making twins, Zack and Cody Martin (Dylan and Cole Sprouse), and London Tipton (Song). The series premiered on the Disney Channel on March 18, 2005, receiving four million viewers, making it the most successful premiere for the Disney Channel in 2005. Critics often praised Song's performance in the Suite Life series. An April 2009 andPOP.com article stated that as London Tipton, [...] "Song is the One to Steal the Spotlight" [...] on the Disney Channel. It said, [...] "if you ever watched an episode of 'The Suite Life with Zack & Cody' you should realize that show is watchable because of one character: London Tipton. Brenda plays the ditzy spoiled hotel heiress London (an allusion to Paris Hilton) <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> say so myself, she does quite an excellent job doing so." [...] While commenting on Song, MSNs 2009 cover story on the series stated, [...] "Song {{is one of the}} main reasons why the [...] "Suite Life" [...] franchise remains one of the most successful and highly rated series in the Disney stable." [...] In a 2009 People magazine article, the character was described as a [...] "melodramatic high-seas diva." ...|$|E
500|$|Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe {{wrote that}} the song [...] "is totally shameless and {{completely}} effective" [...] as it [...] "derives much of its charm from a hefty sample of Michael Jackson's 'Human Nature'". Joanne Dorken of MTV UK {{wrote that the}} sample gives [...] "the tune an instant eighties feel". Najah Goldstein of radio station WNOW-FM wrote that the song is [...] "shows a much softer side of Chris Brown", and further added that it's [...] "definitely a song for the ladies...maybe even for pop star Rihanna." [...] Margaret Wappler of Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "the sentiment of the song is refreshingly complex." [...] Hannah Ash of The Harber Herald wrote that on F.A.M.E., [...] "She Ain't You" [...] and [...] "Up to You" [...] are [...] "the perfect sweet and cute love songs". While reviewing the album, Sean Fennessey of The Washington Post wrote that [...] "a more appropriate application appears on 'She Ain’t You', which interpolates Michael Jackson's 'Human Nature'. Jackson {{has long been the}} emotional, physical and musical forebear to Brown. But on 'She Ain’t You' he begs the comparison, and it isn’t pretty." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times wrote that Brown [...] "has a really charmless way with a lyric, as on 'She Ain’t You'—"When I'm with her it's only 'bout the sex / With you I had a bad romance / <b>And</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> just trade her in I would"—and a voice nowhere near strong enough to make up for it." [...] The song was nominated for Song of the Year at the 2011 Soul Train Music Awards, and Top R Song at the 2012 Billboard Music Awards.|$|E

2500|$|Despite his celebrated flaws, history records Fox as {{an amiable}} figure. The Tory wit George Selwyn wrote that, [...] "I have passed two evenings with him, and never was anybody so agreeable, {{and the more}} so from his having no pretensions to it". Selwyn also said that [...] "Charles, I am persuaded, would have no {{consideration}} on earth but for what was useful to his own ends. You have heard me say, that I thought he had no malice or rancour; I think so still and am sure of it. But I {{think that he has}} no feeling neither, for anyone but himself; <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> trace in any one action of his life anything that had not for its object his own gratification, I should with pleasure receive the intelligence because then I had much rather (if it were possible) think well of him than not". Sir Philip Francis said of Fox: [...] "The essential defect in his character and the cause of all his failures, strange as it may seem, was that he had no heart". Edward Gibbon remarked that [...] "Perhaps no human being was ever more perfectly exempt from the taint of malevolence, vanity, or falsehood." [...] Central to understanding Fox's life was his view that [...] "friendship was the only real happiness in the world." [...] For Fox, politics was the extension of his activities at Newmarket and Brooks's to Westminster. [...] "Fox had little or no interest in the exercise of power." [...] The details of policy – particularly of economics – bored him, in contrast with the intensity of Burke’s legal pursuit of Warren Hastings, and of Pitt’s prosecution of the war against France. Moreover, the Foxites were [...] "the witty and wicked" [...] satellites of their leader, as much friends as political allies.|$|E
