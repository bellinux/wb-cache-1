40|$|Background/Aim. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) definition, {{congenital}} <b>anomalies</b> are all disorders of {{the organs}} or tissues, {{regardless of whether}} they are visible at birth or manifest in life, and are registered in the International Classification of Diseases. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the incidence and structure of prenatally detected and clinically manifested congenital <b>anomalies</b> in the newborns in the region of Novi Sad (Province of Vojvodina, Serbia) in the two distant years (1996 and 2006). Methods. This retrospective cohort study included all the children born at the Clinic for Gynecology and Obstetrics (Clinical Center of Vojvodina) in Novi Sad during 1996 and 2006. The incidence and the structure of congenital <b>anomalies</b> were analyzed. Results. During 1996 there were 6, 099 births and major congenital <b>anomalies</b> were found in 215 infants, representing 3. 5 %. In 2006 there were 6, 628 births and major congenital <b>anomalies</b> were noted in 201 newborns, which is 3 %. During 1996 there were more children with <b>anomalies</b> of musculoskeletal system, urogenital tract, with <b>anomalies</b> of the central nervous system and chromosomal abnormalities. During the year 2006 there were more children with cardiovascular <b>anomalies,</b> followed by urogenital <b>anomalies,</b> with significant decline in musculoskeletal <b>anomalies.</b> The distribution of the newborns with major congenital <b>anomalies,</b> regarding perinatal outcome, showed the difference between the studied years. In 2006 the increasing number of children required further investigation and treatment. Conclusions. There is no national registry of congenital <b>anomalies</b> in Serbia so the aim of this study was to enlight this topic. In the span of ten years, covering the period of the NATO campaign in Novi Sad and Serbia, the frequency of major congenital <b>anomalies</b> in the newborns was not increased. The most frequent <b>anomalies</b> observed during both years implied the musculosketelal, cardiovascular, urogenital and central nervous system. In the year 2006 there was a significant eruption of cardiovascular <b>anomalies</b> and a significant decrease of musculoskeletal <b>anomalies,</b> chromosomal abnormalities and central nervous system <b>anomalies,</b> while the number of urogenital <b>anomalies</b> declined compared to the year 1996...|$|R

METHODS: We carried out a retrospective cohort study of 5 542 861 nulliparous pregnant women younger than 35 years of age with a live singleton birth between 1995 and 2000 in the USA. RESULTS: Compared with adult pregnancy (20 – 34 years old), and after adjustment for confounding variables, teenage pregnancy (13 – 19 years old) was associated with increased risk of central nervous system <b>anomalies</b> [odds ratio (OR) 1. 08; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 01, 1. 16], gastrointestinal <b>anomalies</b> (OR: 1. 39; 95 % CI: 1. 31, 1. 49) and musculoskeletal/integumental <b>anomalies</b> (OR: 1. 06; 95 % CI: 1. 03, 1. 10). The teenage pregnancy associated increase in risk for central nervous system <b>anomalies</b> was mainly attributable to <b>anomalies</b> other than anencephalus, spina bifida/meningocele and hydrocephalus and microcephalus; for gastrointestinal <b>anomalies</b> the risk was mainly attributable to omphalocele/gastroschisis; and for musculoskeletal/integumental <b>anomalies</b> the risk was mainly attributable to cleft lip/palate and polydactyly/syn-dactyly/adactyly.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to examine, based on recently available high resolution satellite and observational data, the evolution and role of sea surface temperature (SST) in influencing the intraseasonal variability of the South China Sea (SCS) summer monsoon (SM). The study focuses on the 30 - 60 day timescale when the northward propagating <b>anomalies</b> are dominant over the SCS. Composite analysis of the SST maximum events during SCS SM shows that increased SST <b>anomalies</b> over the SCS are significantly influenced by the downward shortwave radiation flux <b>anomalies,</b> with the suppressed surface latent heat flux <b>anomalies</b> supplementing to it. A thermal damping of the positive SST <b>anomalies</b> induces positive upward heat fluxes, which then destabilize the lower atmosphere between 1000 hPa and 700 hPa. The positive SST <b>anomalies</b> lead the positive precipitation <b>anomalies</b> over the SCS by 10 days, with a significant correlation (r = 0. 44) between the SST-precipitation <b>anomalies.</b> The new findings here indicate an ocean-to-atmosphere effect over the SCS, where underlying SST <b>anomalies</b> tend to form a favorable condition for convective activity and sustain enhanced precipitation during the SCS SM. It is also argued, based on our observations, that the negative sea level pressure <b>anomalies</b> induced by the positive SST <b>anomalies</b> play a role in enhancing the northward propagation of the intraseasonal <b>anomalies</b> over the SCS...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates signals of the South China Sea (SCS) summer {{rainfall}} {{variability in the}} Indian Ocean. It is found that the SCS summer rainfall has a negative relationship with December-January-February (DJF) western-equatorial Indian Ocean (WIO) sea surface temperature (SST), a positive relationship with an asymmetric mode of precipitation <b>anomalies</b> in the tropical Indian Ocean during March-April-May (MAM), and a positive relationship with June-July-August (JJA) South Indian Ocean (SIO) SST. The WIO SST <b>anomalies</b> induce same-sign southeast Indian Ocean SST <b>anomalies</b> through an anomalous zonal vertical circulation. The southeast Indian Ocean SST <b>anomalies</b> last from late winter to early summer and induce opposite-sign SCS summer rainfall <b>anomalies</b> via an anomalous meridional vertical circulation. The asymmetric mode influences the SCS summer rainfall variation via the North Indian Ocean (NIO) SST <b>anomalies</b> with significant cloud-radiation and wind-evaporation effect. Positive (negative) SIO SST <b>anomalies</b> drive an anomalous direct circulation between the SIO and the NIO, and an anomalous indirect circulation between the NIO and the SCS which facilitates the occurrence of cyclonic (anti-cyclonic) wind <b>anomalies</b> over the SCS-western North Pacific and results in positive (negative) SCS summer rainfall <b>anomalies.</b> Partial correlation analysis indicates that the influence of DJF WIO SST <b>anomalies</b> and JJA SIO SST <b>anomalies</b> on the SCS summer rainfall is partly ENSO-independent, while the MAM asymmetric mode is mostly related to the preceding DJF eastern Pacific SST <b>anomalies...</b>|$|R

By analyzing the time of occurrence, duration, and spatial distribution of these ionospheric <b>anomalies,</b> a number of new conclusions are drawn, as follows: earthquake-related ionospheric <b>anomalies</b> are not bound to appear; both positive and negative <b>anomalies</b> are likely to occur; and the earthquake-related ionospheric <b>anomalies</b> discussed in the current study occurred 0 – 2 days before the associated earthquakes and in the afternoon to sunset (i. e. between 12 : 00 and 20 : 00 local time).

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} anomalous soil moisture conditions on subsequent precipitation over North America, a series of numerical experiments is performed using {{a modified version of}} the Community Atmosphere Model version 3 and the Community Land Model version 3 (CAM 3 –CLM 3). First, the mecha-nisms underlying the impact of spring and summer soil moisture on subsequent precipitation are examined based on simulations starting on 1 April and 1 June, respectively. How the response of precipitation to initial soil moisture <b>anomalies</b> depends on the characteristics of such <b>anomalies,</b> including the timing, magnitude, spatial coverage, and vertical depth, is then investigated. There are five main findings. First, the impact of spring soil moisture <b>anomalies</b> is not evident until early summer although their impact on the large-scale circulation results in slight changes in precipitation during spring. Second, precipitation increases with initial soil moisture almost linearly within a certain range of soil moisture. Beyond this range, pre-cipitation is less responsive. Third, during the first month following the onset of summer soil moisture <b>anomalies,</b> the precipitation response to wet <b>anomalies</b> is larger in magnitude than that to dry <b>anomalies.</b> However, the resulting wet <b>anomalies</b> in precipitation quickly dissipate within a month or so, while the resulting dry <b>anomalies</b> in precipitation remain at a considerable magnitude for a longer period. Consis-tently, wet spring <b>anomalies</b> are likely to be ameliorated before summer, and thus have a smaller impact (in magnitude) on summer precipitation than dry spring <b>anomalies.</b> Fourth, soil moisture <b>anomalies</b> of smaller spatial coverage lead to precipitation <b>anomalies</b> that are smaller and less persistent, compared to <b>anomalies</b> at the continental scale. Finally, <b>anomalies</b> in shallow soil can persist long enough to influence the subse-quent precipitation at the seasonal time scale. Dry <b>anomalies</b> in deep soils last much longer than those in shallow soils. 1...|$|R
