5|$|An {{electron}} can {{be bound}} to the nucleus of <b>an</b> <b>atom</b> by the attractive Coulomb force. A system {{of one or more}} electrons bound to a nucleus is called <b>an</b> <b>atom.</b> If the number of electrons is different from the nucleus' electrical charge, such <b>an</b> <b>atom</b> is called an ion. The wave-like behavior of a bound electron is described by a function called an atomic orbital. Each orbital has its own set of quantum numbers such as energy, angular momentum and projection of angular momentum, and only a discrete set of these orbitals exist around the nucleus. According to the Pauli exclusion principle each orbital can be occupied by up to two electrons, which must differ in their spin quantum number.|$|E
5|$|The first {{formulation}} of a quantum theory describing radiation and matter interaction {{is attributed to}} British scientist Paul Dirac, who (during the 1920s) was able to compute the coefficient of spontaneous emission of <b>an</b> <b>atom.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>An</b> <b>atom</b> can be ionized by {{removing}} {{one of its}} electrons. The electric charge causes the trajectory of <b>an</b> <b>atom</b> to bend when it passes through a magnetic field. The radius by which the trajectory of a moving ion is turned by the magnetic field {{is determined by the}} mass of the atom. The mass spectrometer uses this principle to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. If a sample contains multiple isotopes, the mass spectrometer can determine the proportion of each isotope in the sample by measuring the intensity of the different beams of ions. Techniques to vaporize atoms include inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, both of which use a plasma to vaporize samples for analysis.|$|E
40|$|The {{structural}} {{diversity of}} arsenic sulfide molecules in compositions between As 4 S 6 and As 4 was investigated using ab initio quantum chemical calculations. The As 4 S 6 molecule {{consists of four}} trigonal pyramid coordinations of <b>As</b> <b>atoms</b> bonding to three S <b>atoms.</b> In the <b>As</b> 4 S 5 composition, only one type of molecular configuration corresponds to an uzonite-type molecule. In the As 4 S 4 composition, two molecular configurations exist with realgar-type and pararealgar-type molecules. Three molecular configurations are in the As 4 S 3 composition. The first configuration comprises trigonal pyramidal <b>As</b> <b>atom</b> coordinations of two types: bonding to two S <b>atoms</b> and one <b>As</b> <b>atom,</b> and bonding to one S <b>atom</b> and two <b>As</b> <b>atoms.</b> The second is the molecular configuration of dimorphite. The third comprises trigonal pyramidal <b>As</b> <b>atom</b> coordinations of two types: bonding to three <b>As</b> <b>atoms,</b> and bonding to one <b>As</b> <b>atom</b> and two S <b>atoms.</b> The <b>As</b> 4 S 2 composition allows molecular configurations of two types. One is comprised of trigonal pyramidal <b>As</b> <b>atom</b> configurations of one type bonding to two <b>As</b> <b>atoms</b> and one S atom. The other comprises trigonal pyramidal <b>As</b> <b>atom</b> coordinations of three types: bonding to two S <b>atoms</b> and one <b>As</b> <b>atoms,</b> bonding to one S <b>atom</b> and two <b>As</b> <b>atoms,</b> and bonding to three <b>As</b> <b>atoms.</b> The <b>As</b> 4 S molecule has trigonal pyramidal <b>As</b> <b>atom</b> coordinations of two types: bonding to one S <b>atom</b> and two <b>As</b> <b>atoms,</b> and bonding to three <b>As</b> <b>atoms.</b> The <b>As</b> 4 S composition permits only one molecular configuration, {{which suggests that the}} mineral duranusite comprises the As 4 S molecular geometry. In all, ten molecular configurations are predicted in the molecular hierarchy of the arsenic sulfide binary system. The simulated Raman spectral profiles are helpful in searching for undiscovered arsenic sulfide minerals...|$|R

5|$|<b>An</b> <b>atom</b> is the {{smallest}} constituent unit of ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element.

5|$|Though {{the word}} atom {{originally}} denoted a particle that cannot be cut into smaller particles, in modern scientific usage the atom {{is composed of}} various subatomic particles.

40|$|The {{distributions}} of <b>As</b> <b>atoms</b> at InP/GaInAs interfaces were investigated {{by analyzing the}} X-ray CTR scattering spectra for the samples grown at different growth temperatures and with different H 2 -flushing times. From {{the results of the}} investigation, the adsorption and desorption processes of <b>As</b> <b>atom</b> on the GaInAs surface during the growth were discussed. Although the desorption of As from a surface progressed at all the investigated temperatures, 590, 620, and 650 oC, a part of the <b>As</b> <b>atoms,</b> about 1. 2 [ML], remained on the surface even when the H 2 -flushing time was long. On the other hand, when the H 2 -flushing time was short, the amounts of <b>As</b> <b>atoms</b> were larger at higher growth temperatures, which suggested the decomposition of As precursor was enhanced at higher growth temperatures. All the results strongly indicated that the amount of <b>As</b> <b>atoms</b> incorporated in InP layer sensitively depends on the balance between the desorption and adsorption of As and {{that it is difficult to}} predict the degree of distribution of the As without a high resolution interface analysis like the X-ray CTR scattering measurement.

5|$|A more {{indirect}} {{effect would be}} that the contracted s and p1/2 orbitals shield (take on themselves) the charge of the nucleus more effectively, leaving even less for the outer d and f electrons, which therefore move on larger orbitals. Dubnium is greatly affected by this: unlike the previous group 5 members, its 7s electrons are more difficult to extract from <b>an</b> <b>atom</b> than the 6d electrons, though these energy levels remain close to each other.|$|E
5|$|All the bound {{protons and}} {{neutrons}} in <b>an</b> <b>atom</b> {{make up a}} tiny atomic nucleus, and are collectively called nucleons. The radius of a nucleus is approximately equal to 1.07fm, where A is {{the total number of}} nucleons. This is much smaller than the radius of the atom, which is on the order of 105fm. The nucleons are bound together by a short-ranged attractive potential called the residual strong force. At distances smaller than 2.5 fm this force is much more powerful than the electrostatic force that causes positively charged protons to repel each other.|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{bonds between}} atoms were now explained, by Gilbert Newton Lewis in 1916, as the {{interactions}} between their constituent electrons. As the chemical properties of the elements were known to largely repeat themselves according to the periodic law, in 1919 the American chemist Irving Langmuir suggested {{that this could be}} explained if the electrons in <b>an</b> <b>atom</b> were connected or clustered in some manner. Groups of electrons were thought to occupy a set of electron shells about the nucleus.|$|E

50|$|Chlorodimethylsilane, {{also called}} dimethylchlorosilane and {{abbreviated}} DMCS, is a chemical compound with the formula (CH3)2SiHCl. It is a silane, with <b>a</b> silicon <b>atom</b> bonded to two methyl groups, <b>a</b> chlorine <b>atom,</b> and <b>a</b> hydrogen <b>atom.</b>|$|R
5|$|Electronegativity is the {{tendency}} of <b>an</b> <b>atom</b> to attract electrons. An atom's electronegativity is affected by both its atomic number and {{the distance between the}} valence electrons and the nucleus. The higher its electronegativity, the more an element attracts electrons. It was first proposed by Linus Pauling in 1932. In general, electronegativity increases on passing from left to right along a period, and decreases on descending a group. Hence, fluorine is the most electronegative of the elements, while caesium is the least, at least of those elements for which substantial data is available.|$|E
5|$|In 1913 the {{physicist}} Niels Bohr proposed {{a model in}} which the electrons of <b>an</b> <b>atom</b> were assumed to orbit the nucleus but could only {{do so in a}} finite set of orbits, and could jump between these orbits only in discrete changes of energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of a photon. This quantization was used to explain why the electrons orbits are stable (given that normally, charges in acceleration, including circular motion, lose kinetic energy which is emitted as electromagnetic radiation, see synchrotron radiation) and why elements absorb and emit electromagnetic radiation in discrete spectra.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of antisymmetry, {{solutions}} of the wave equation for interacting electrons result in a zero probability that each pair will occupy the same location or state. This {{is responsible for the}} Pauli exclusion principle, which precludes any two electrons from occupying the same quantum state. This principle explains many of the properties of electrons. For example, it causes groups of bound electrons to occupy different orbitals in <b>an</b> <b>atom,</b> rather than all overlapping each other in the same orbit.|$|E
50|$|In crystallographic terms, the Co atoms {{occupy the}} 8c sites, while the <b>As</b> <b>atoms</b> occupy the 24g sites. The {{position}} of the Co atoms within the unit cell is fixed, while {{the positions of the}} <b>As</b> <b>atoms</b> are determined by the parameters x and y. It has been shown that for the As-rings to be fully square, these parameters must satisfy the Oftedahl relation x + y = 1/2. Any deviation from this relation yields a rectangular configuration of the As atoms; indeed, this is the case for all known compounds with this structure, and the <b>As</b> <b>atoms</b> do not form a perfect octahedra.|$|R

Alternately, the atomic mass of <b>a</b> carbon-12 <b>atom</b> may {{be expressed in}} any other mass units: for example, the atomic mass of <b>a</b> carbon-12 <b>atom</b> is about 1.998467052 x 10−26 kilogram.|$|R
40|$|The adatom {{positions}} of adsorbates like A = H, Se Xe on (100) or (111) surfaces of bcc or ccp metals and related compounds like hcp metals, NaCl or ZnS form a square, hexagonal, honeycomb or Kagome net. The ordered structures {{can be characterized}} by the self-coordination numbers of nearest, next-nearest and third neighbors T- 1, T- 2, T- 3 and the T- 1, T- 2 values plotted in structure maps for a constant ratio of vacant/occupied sites. Most experimental structures have a single coordination of all <b>A</b> <b>atoms.</b> The interactions between <b>A</b> <b>atoms</b> are attractive for chains of <b>A</b> <b>atoms</b> with T- 1 = 2 and repulsive for T- 1 = 0 or T- 1 = T- 2 = 0. The structures with intermediate T- 1, T- 2 values can be characterized by sequences of structural units like squares or hexagons with a different occupation of the corners by <b>A</b> <b>atoms...</b>|$|R
5|$|Long-range atomic {{exchange}} {{is a process}} involving an adatom inserting into the surface as in the normal atomic exchange mechanism, but instead of a nearest-neighbor atom it is <b>an</b> <b>atom</b> some distance further from the initial adatom that emerges. Shown in figure 9, this process has only been observed in molecular dynamics simulations {{and has yet to}} be confirmed experimentally. In spite of this long range atomic exchange, as well as a variety of other exotic diffusion mechanisms, are anticipated to contribute substantially at temperatures currently too high for direct observation.|$|E
5|$|The {{electron}} affinity of <b>an</b> <b>atom</b> {{is the amount}} of energy released when an electron is added to a neutral atom to form a negative ion. Although {{electron affinity}} varies greatly, some patterns emerge. Generally, nonmetals have more positive electron affinity values than metals. Chlorine most strongly attracts an extra electron. The electron affinities of the noble gases have not been measured conclusively, so {{they may or may not}} have slightly negative values.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrons}} in <b>an</b> <b>atom</b> {{are attracted to}} the protons in the nucleus by the electromagnetic force. This force binds the {{electrons in}}side an electrostatic potential well surrounding the smaller nucleus, which means that an external source of energy is needed for the electron to escape. The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the greater the attractive force. Hence electrons bound {{near the center of}} the potential well require more energy to escape than those at greater separations.|$|E
50|$|Ludwig Boltzmann {{worked on}} Fick's second law {{to convert it}} into an {{ordinary}} differential equation, whereas Chujiro Matano performed experiments with diffusion couples and calculated the diffusion coefficients {{as a function of}} concentration in metal alloys.

5|$|The {{electrons}} of <b>an</b> <b>atom</b> {{are attracted}} to the protons in an atomic nucleus by this electromagnetic force. The protons and neutrons in the nucleus {{are attracted to}} each other by a different force, the nuclear force, which is usually stronger than the electromagnetic force repelling the positively charged protons from one another. Under certain circumstances, the repelling electromagnetic force becomes stronger than the nuclear force, and nucleons can be ejected from the nucleus, leaving behind a different element: nuclear decay resulting in nuclear transmutation.|$|E
5|$|The first {{ionization}} energy is the energy {{it takes to}} remove one electron from <b>an</b> <b>atom,</b> the second {{ionization energy}} is the energy it takes to remove a second electron from the atom, and so on. For a given atom, successive ionization energies increase with the degree of ionization. For magnesium as an example, the first ionization energy is 738kJ/mol {{and the second is}} 1450kJ/mol. Electrons in the closer orbitals experience greater forces of electrostatic attraction; thus, their removal requires increasingly more energy. Ionization energy becomes greater up and {{to the right of the}} periodic table.|$|E
5|$|The {{frequency}} of a photon {{is proportional to}} its energy. As a bound electron transitions between different energy levels of <b>an</b> <b>atom,</b> it absorbs or emits photons at characteristic frequencies. For instance, when atoms are irradiated by a source with a broad spectrum, distinct absorption lines appear in the spectrum of transmitted radiation. Each element or molecule displays a characteristic set of spectral lines, such as the hydrogen spectral series. Spectroscopic measurements of the strength and width of these lines allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.|$|E
40|$|The {{electrical}} conductivity of GaAs layers grown by molecular-beam epitaxy at low temperatures was studied {{by using the}} van der Pauw method. The {{electrical conductivity}} of thick GaAs layers grown at temperatures above 200 °C changes with the concentration of antisite <b>As</b> <b>atoms</b> following the nearest-neighbor hopping model. From the dependence of the conductivity on the average spacing of antisite <b>As</b> <b>atoms,</b> the Bohr radius of the donor wave function in the hydrogen like model {{was estimated to be}} between 2. 8 and 4. 0 A. The activation energy for hopping conduction changes inversely with the average distance of antisite <b>As</b> <b>atoms.</b> Enhanced incorporation of excess As occurs in the growth of ultrathin GaAs layers at low temperatures. The electrical resistivity of the ultrathin layers is reduced to nearly 1 Ω cm at room temperature by the enhanced incorporation. The activation energy for hopping conduction in the ultrathin layers is significantly lower than that expected from the inversely proportional relation with the average spacing of antisite <b>As</b> <b>atoms...</b>|$|R

50|$|Antisite defects {{occur in}} an ordered alloy or {{compound}} when atoms of different type exchange positions.
