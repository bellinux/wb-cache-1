25|$|In late 1966, {{the then}} Secretary for Chinese Affairs, John McDouall, retired to the United Kingdom and Holmes {{was chosen to}} succeed the post which McDouall had served for a decade. Nevertheless, {{at the time of}} his {{promotion}} the Cultural Revolution had just broken out in the mainland China and the situation of Hong Kong had become increasingly unstable. In the following year, Hong Kong was finally hit by the outbreak of the 1967 Leftist Riots, a series of riots which was triggered by a labour dispute. During the disorder, Governor Sir David Trench happened to be absent from Hong Kong and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>there</b> was no one fully in command of the government. As a result, then Colonial Secretary, Sir Michael Gass, became acting-Governor and Holmes became acting-Colonial Secretary, and therefore it was Holmes and Gass who were in charge in the crisis. At the beginning of the riot, there were only general strikes in Hong Kong but the situation worsened quickly when the Communists started to put pipe bombs on the streets. The presence of pipe bombs was a big blow to Hong Kong as it roused public fear, while the British government and the Hong Kong government secretly discussed whether or not to abandon the Crown Colony. It was said that Holmes strongly resisted the idea of retreat in the Executive Council, and he successfully persuaded the British to stay. Under the leadership of Holmes, the government adopted a hard-line policy towards the Communists and called on the general public to denounce the leftists. Finally, the rioting ended in late 1967, and the tough stance held by Holmes was deeply appreciated by the government.|$|E

Liam's brother Noel Gallagher, {{who was a}} roadie for Inspiral Carpets, went with the band to watch his younger brother's band play. Whilst Noel and his friends did not think Oasis sounded {{particularly}} spectacular, he did begin {{to consider the possibility}} of using his brother's group as a possible outlet for a series of songs he had been writing for several years. Noel approached the group about joining with the proviso that he would become the band's sole songwriter and leader, and that they would commit to an earnest pursuit of commercial success. [...] "He had loads of stuff written," [...] Arthurs recalled. [...] "When he walked in, we were a band making a racket with four tunes. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden,</b> <b>there</b> were loads of ideas." [...] Oasis under Noel Gallagher crafted a musical approach that relied on simplicity: with Arthurs and McGuigan restricted to playing barre chords and root bass notes, McCarroll playing basic rhythms, and the band's amplifiers turned up to create distortion, Oasis created a sound [...] "so devoid of finesse and complexity that it came out sounding pretty much unstoppable." ...|$|E

60|$|Our hero {{could hardly}} tell what followed, only that <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sudden</b> <b>there</b> was a prodigious uproar of combat.

Then another pistol shot so {{deafened}} what was left of Master Harry's hearing that his ears rang for above an hour afterward.

The Hall was just as clearly visible as at noonday. I could see the men running about, shouting, and the soldiers tumbling out of their quarters. All the time the bombs were coming down like hail and a corner of the Hall was in flames. Then the lighted stuff, whatever it was, burnt out and the darkness seemed as black as pitch.
