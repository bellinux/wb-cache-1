5|$|Low immune {{function}} {{has also been}} implicated in endometrial cancer. High blood pressure is also <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor,</b> but {{this may be because}} of its association with obesity. Sitting regularly for prolonged periods is associated with higher mortality from endometrial cancer. The risk is not negated by regular exercise, though it is lowered.|$|E
5|$|Fasting is <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor,</b> {{possibly}} because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves.

Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including carbamazepine, phenytoin, and barbiturates, have also been reported as risk factors.|$|E

5|$|The {{apparent}} seasonality {{may also}} be due to social factors, such as people spending more time indoors, near infected people, and specifically children at school. There is some controversy {{over the role of}} low body temperature as <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> for the common cold; the majority of the evidence suggests that it may result in greater susceptibility to infection.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} factors can {{potentially}} {{increase the risk of}} developing paracetamol toxicity. Chronic excessive alcohol consumption can induce CYP2E1, thus increasing the potential toxicity of paracetamol. In one study of patients with liver injury, 64% reported alcohol intakes of greater than 80 grams a day, while 35% took 60 grams a day or less. Whether chronic alcoholism should be considered <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> has been debated by some clinical toxicologists. For chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol ingestion at the time of a paracetamol overdose may have a protective effect. For non-chronic alcohol users, acute alcohol consumption had no protective effect.|$|E
5|$|Herd immunity, {{generated}} from previous exposure to cold viruses, {{plays an important}} role in limiting viral spread, as seen with younger populations that have greater rates of respiratory infections. Poor immune function is <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> for disease. Insufficient sleep and malnutrition have been associated with a greater risk of developing infection following rhinovirus exposure; this is believed to be due to their effects on immune function. Breast feeding decreases the risk of acute otitis media and lower respiratory tract infections among other diseases, and it is recommended that breast feeding be continued when an infant has a cold. In the developed world breast feeding may not be protective against the common cold in and of itself.|$|E

At age 20, the chance is one in 1441; at age 30, it is one in 959; at age 40, it is one in 84; and at age 50 it is one in 44. Although the probability increases with maternal age, 70% of children with Down syndrome are born to women 35 {{years of age and}} younger, because younger people have more children.

5|$|Obesity {{has long}} been {{regarded}} as <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> for venous thrombosis. It more than doubles the risk in numerous studies, particularly {{in combination with the}} use of oral contraceptives or in the period after surgery. Various coagulation abnormalities have been described in the obese. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, is present in higher levels in people with obesity. Obese people also have larger numbers of circulating microvesicles (fragments of damaged cells) that bear tissue factor. Platelet aggregation may be increased, and there are higher levels of coagulation proteins such as von Willebrand factor, fibrinogen, factor VII and factor VIII. Obesity also increases the risk of recurrence after an initial episode of thrombosis.|$|E
5|$|Retinopathy of {{prematurity}} was {{not observed}} before World War II, but with the availability of supplemental oxygen in the decade following, it rapidly {{became one of the}} principal causes of infant blindness in developed countries. By 1960 the use of oxygen had become identified as <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> and its administration restricted. The resulting fall in retinopathy of prematurity was accompanied by a rise in infant mortality and hypoxia-related complications. Since then, more sophisticated monitoring and diagnosis have established protocols for oxygen use which aim to balance between hypoxic conditions and problems of retinopathy of prematurity.|$|E
40|$|Background The {{way that}} {{patients}} perceive their cardiac condition and {{their attitude toward}} its causes are effective in education and in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Objectives The current {{study was conducted to}} compare anxiety and depression among cardiovascular patients with and without <b>a</b> perceived <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> toward CVD. Methods The administrative data of this retrospective cross-sectional study were obtained from the database of the cardiac rehabilitation (CR) ward of a hospital in Iran. The data of 745 patients were obtained from January 2005 to 2011 using the compiled forms of this database, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Structured Clinical Interview for Axis I Disorders. Multivariate analysis of variance was used for data analysis. Results After adjusting for gender and age and {{at the beginning of the}} CR program, anxiety (P = 0. 006) and depression scores (P = 0. 016) were significantly higher among those with <b>a</b> perceived <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> (N = 602) than among those without such perceived <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> (N = 143). Although males with <b>a</b> perceived <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> experienced higher anxiety (P = 0. 01) and depression (P = 0. 02) than males without such perceived <b>risk</b> <b>factor,</b> the difference was not detected in females. Conclusions <b>As</b> perceived <b>risk</b> <b>factors</b> may not always translate to <b>a</b> real <b>risk</b> <b>factor,</b> patients with <b>a</b> perceived <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> toward CVD may experience anxiety and depression.

5|$|Severe {{disease is}} more common in babies and young children, and in {{contrast}} to many other infections, it {{is more common}} in children who are relatively well nourished. Other risk factors for severe disease include female sex, high body mass index, and viral load. While each serotype can cause the full spectrum of disease, virus strain is <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor.</b> Infection with one serotype is thought to produce lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term protection against the other three. The risk of severe disease from secondary infection increases if someone previously exposed to serotype DENV-1 contracts serotype DENV-2 or DENV-3, or if someone previously exposed to DENV-3 acquires DENV-2. Dengue can be life-threatening in people with chronic diseases such as diabetes and asthma.|$|E
5|$|Some therapies {{for other}} forms of cancer {{increase}} the lifetime risk of endometrial cancer, which is a baseline 2–3%. Tamoxifen, a drug used to treat estrogen-positive breast cancers, {{has been associated with}} endometrial cancer in approximately 0.1% of users, particularly older women, but the benefits for survival from tamoxifen generally outweigh the risk of endometrial cancer. A one to two-year course of tamoxifen approximately doubles the risk of endometrial cancer, and a five-year course of therapy quadruples that risk. Raloxifene, a similar drug, did not raise the risk of endometrial cancer. Previously having ovarian cancer is <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> for endometrial cancer, as is having had previous radiotherapy to the pelvis. Specifically, ovarian granulosa cell tumors and thecomas are tumors associated with endometrial cancer.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{infection}} is Escherichia coli, though other bacteria or fungi may rarely be the cause. Risk factors include female anatomy, sexual intercourse, diabetes, obesity, and family history. Although sexual intercourse is <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor,</b> UTIs are not classified as sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Kidney infection, if it occurs, usually follows a bladder infection but may also result from a blood-borne infection. Diagnosis in young healthy women can be based on symptoms alone. In those with vague symptoms, diagnosis can be difficult because bacteria may be present without there being an infection. In complicated cases or if treatment fails, a urine culture may be useful.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with other}} members of the lipocalin protein family, major urinary {{proteins}} can be potent allergens to humans. The reason for this is not known, however molecular mimicry between Mups and structurally similar human lipocalins has been proposed as a possible explanation. The protein product of the mouse Mup17 gene, known as Musm1, Ag1 or MA1, accounts for much of the allergenic properties of mouse urine. The protein is extremely stable in the environment; studies have found 95% of inner city homes, and 82% of all types of homes in the United States have detectable levels in at least one room. Similarly, Ratn1 is a known human allergen. A US study found its presence in 33% of inner city homes, and 21% of occupants were sensitized to the allergen. Exposure and sensitization to rodent Mup proteins is considered <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> for childhood asthma, and is a leading cause of laboratory animal allergy (LAA)—an occupational disease of laboratory animal technicians and scientists. One study found that two-thirds of laboratory workers who had developed asthmatic reactions to animals had antibodies to Ratn1.|$|E
5|$|Common {{responses}} include: {{pupil dilation}} (93%); changes in heart rate (100%), including increases (56%), decreases (13%), and variable responses (31%); changes {{in blood pressure}} (84%), including hypotension (34%), hypertension (28%), and general instability (22%); changes in stretch reflex (86%), including increases (80%) and decreases (6%); nausea (44%); tremor (25%); and dysmetria (16%) (inability to properly direct or limit motions). The temporary increases in blood pressure caused by the drug can be <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> for users with pre-existing hypertension. These qualitative somatic effects caused by psilocybin have been corroborated by several early clinical studies. A 2005 magazine survey of club goers in the UK found that nausea or vomiting was experienced by {{over a quarter of}} those who had used psilocybin mushrooms in the last year, although this effect is caused by the mushroom rather than psilocybin itself. In one study, administration of gradually increasing dosages of psilocybin daily for 21 days had no measurable effect on electrolyte levels, blood sugar levels, or liver toxicity tests.|$|E

5|$|Lead has {{no known}} physiologically {{relevant}} {{role in the}} body, and its harmful effects are myriad. Lead and other heavy metals create reactive radicals which damage cell structures including DNA and cell membranes. Lead also interferes with DNA transcription, enzymes that help in the synthesis of vitamin D, and enzymes that maintain {{the integrity of the}} cell membrane. Anemia may result when the cell membranes of red blood cells become more fragile as the result of damage to their membranes. Lead interferes with metabolism of bones and teeth and alters the permeability of blood vessels and collagen synthesis. Lead may also be harmful to the developing immune system, causing production of excessive inflammatory proteins; this mechanism may mean that lead exposure is <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> for asthma in children. Lead exposure has also been associated with a decrease in activity of immune cells such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Lead also interferes with the normal metabolism of calcium in cells and causes it to build up within them.|$|E
5|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to high inspired fractions of oxygen causes {{damage to the}} retina. Damage to the developing eye of infants exposed to high oxygen fraction at normal pressure has a different mechanism and effect from the eye damage experienced by adult divers under hyperbaric conditions. Hyperoxia may be a contributing factor for the disorder called retrolental fibroplasia or retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in infants. In preterm infants, the retina is often not fully vascularised. Retinopathy of prematurity occurs {{when the development of}} the retinal vasculature is arrested and then proceeds abnormally. Associated with the growth of these new vessels is fibrous tissue (scar tissue) that may contract to cause retinal detachment. Supplemental oxygen exposure, while <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor,</b> is not the main risk factor for development of this disease. Restricting supplemental oxygen use does not necessarily reduce the rate of retinopathy of prematurity, and may raise the risk of hypoxia-related systemic complications.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{epilepsy}} following meningitis is {{less than}} 10%; that disease more commonly causes seizures during the infection itself. In herpes simplex encephalitis {{the risk of a}} seizure is around 50% with a high risk of epilepsy following (up to 25%). Infection with the pork tapeworm, which can result in neurocysticercosis, is the cause of up to half of epilepsy cases in areas of the world where the parasite is common. Epilepsy may also occur after other brain infections such as cerebral malaria, toxoplasmosis, and toxocariasis. Chronic alcohol use increases the risk of epilepsy: those who drink six units of alcohol per day have a two and a half fold increase in risk. Other risks include Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, tuberous sclerosis, and autoimmune encephalitis. Getting vaccinated does not increase the risk of epilepsy. Malnutrition is <b>a</b> <b>risk</b> <b>factor</b> seen mostly in the developing world, although it is unclear however if it is a direct cause or an association. People with cerebral palsy have an increased risk of epilepsy, with half of people with spastic quadriplegia and spastic hemiplegia having the disease.|$|E
