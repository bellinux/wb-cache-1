5|$|The bulb of the radish {{is usually}} eaten raw, {{although}} tougher specimens can be steamed. The raw flesh has <b>a</b> <b>crisp</b> texture and a pungent, peppery flavor, caused by glucosinolates and the enzyme myrosinase, which combine when chewed to form allyl isothiocyanates, {{also present in}} mustard, horseradish, and wasabi.|$|E
5|$|Broasting uses a {{pressure}} cooker {{to accelerate the}} process. The moisture inside the chicken becomes steam and increases the pressure in the cooker, lowering the cooking temperature needed. The steam also cooks the chicken through, but still allows the pieces to be moist and tender while maintaining <b>a</b> <b>crisp</b> coating. Fat is heated in {{a pressure}} cooker. Chicken pieces are prepared as described above and then placed in the hot fat. The lid {{is placed on the}} pressure cooker, and the chicken pieces are thus fried under pressure.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Warde's article was {{published}} some revivals {{had been released}} that were more authentic revivals of Garamond's work, based on period books and printing specimens. The German company Stempel brought out <b>a</b> <b>crisp</b> revival of the original Garamond typefaces in the 1920s, inspired by a rediscovered specimen from the Egenolff-Berner foundry in Frankfurt, as did Linotype in Britain.|$|E

5|$|Fried chicken (also {{referred}} to as Southern fried chicken for the variant in the United States) is a dish consisting of chicken pieces usually from broiler chickens which have been floured or battered and then pan-fried, deep fried, or pressure fried. The breading adds <b>a</b> <b>crisp</b> coating or crust to the exterior. What separates fried chicken from other fried forms of chicken is that generally the chicken is cut at the joints, and the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin, rendered of excess fat, is a hallmark of well made fried chicken.|$|E
5|$|Gom bian (also {{known as}} 光饼 or Kompia) — a Foochow {{delicacy}} made with flour, baked in an oven and eaten either {{with or without}} meat and gravy. It is somewhat similar to a bagel. However, it can be either in <b>a</b> <b>crisp</b> or soft version. Traditional soft kompia dipped in pork sauce can be sought from Chung Hua road and the Sunday Market at Pedada road. There are deep fried variations available throughout the town of Sibu.|$|E
5|$|A 1920s {{adaptation}} {{created by}} the Stempel Type Foundry and released for hot metal typesetting by Linotype, that has remained popular. It is sharp, somewhat angular design with <b>a</b> <b>crisp</b> hook rather than a teardrop at top left of the 'a'. Stempel Garamond has relatively short descenders, allowing it to be particularly tightly linespaced. An unusual feature is the digit 0, which has reversed contrast, with the thickest points of {{the number on the}} top and bottom of the digit to make it more distinguishable from a 'o'. The Klingspor Museum credits it to Stempel's head of typeface development Dr. Rudolf Wolf.|$|E
50|$|Produced by Elton John's {{producer}} Gus Dudgeon, {{the album}} had <b>a</b> <b>crisper</b> sound than Solution and Divergence. This trend was continued {{on the following}} album Fully Interlocking (1977), also produced by Dudgeon.|$|R
50|$|The {{sound of}} a crash is changed by its luster. A cleaner cymbal creates <b>a</b> <b>crisper</b> sound, whereas <b>a</b> cymbal showing signs of {{oxidation}} (called a 'raw' cymbal) creates a duller sound.|$|R
50|$|Until 1956, drum {{heads were}} of {{stretched}} unborn calfskin, but beginning in 1957 the Ludwig Drum Company introduced mylar drum heads that gave <b>a</b> <b>crisper</b> sound and were impervious to damp weather.|$|R
5|$|Principal {{photography}} commenced on August 15, 1983. All but {{two days}} of production were filmed on Paramount soundstages, by cinematographer Charles Correll. The Search for Spock {{was one of the}} first major feature films to use Eastman 5294, a color high speed negative film stock. The film allowed Correll latitude in choosing a broad range of exposure indexes. Since The Search for Spock was shot with anamorphic lenses and many theatergoers would see widescreen 70mm prints, Correll needed to produce <b>a</b> <b>crisp</b> depth of field, a difficult task on many sets. For scenes on the bridge, Correll pushed the exposure index above the Eastman recommendation to keep the image crisp at less than 50foot-candles.|$|E
5|$|Riesling {{wines are}} often {{consumed}} when young, {{when they make}} a fruity and aromatic wine which may have aromas of green or other apples, grapefruit, peach, gooseberry, honey, rose blossom or cut green grass, and usually <b>a</b> <b>crisp</b> taste due to the high acidity. However, Riesling's naturally high acidity and range of flavours make it suitable for extended aging. International wine expert Michael Broadbent rates aged German Rieslings, some hundreds of years old, highly. Sweet Riesling wines, such as German Trockenbeerenauslese are especially suited for cellaring since the high sugar content provides for additional preservation. However, high quality dry or off-dry Riesling wine is also known to have not just survived but also been enjoyable at an age exceeding 100 years.|$|E
5|$|A popular food in Gangtok is the momo, a steamed {{dumpling}} containing pork, {{beef and}} vegetables cooked in a doughy wrapping {{and served with}} watery soup. Wai-Wai is a packaged snack consisting of noodles which are eaten either dry or in soup form. A form of noodle called thukpa, served in soup form is also popular in Gangtok. Other noodle-based foods such as the chowmein, thenthuk, fakthu, gyathuk and wonton are available. Other traditional Sikkimese cuisine include shah-phaley (Sikkimese patties with spiced minced meat in <b>a</b> <b>crisp</b> samosa-like case) and Gack-ko soup. Restaurants offer {{a wide variety of}} traditional Indian, continental and Chinese cuisines to cater to the tourists. Churpee, a kind of hard cheese made from cow's or yak's milk is sometimes chewed. Chhang is a local frothy millet beer traditionally served in bamboo tankards and drunk through bamboo or cane straws. Alcohol is cheap due to low excise duty in Sikkim. Beer, whiskey, rum and brandy are frequently consumed by both locals and non-locals.|$|E
25|$|Toucan Brew was {{introduced}} in May 2006. It was named after the cartoon toucan used in many Guinness advertisements. This beer had <b>a</b> <b>crisper</b> taste with <b>a</b> slightly sweet aftertaste due to its triple-hopped brewing process.|$|R
50|$|The ciabatta {{found in}} Tuscany, Umbria, and Marche varies from bread {{that has a}} firm crust and dense crumb, to bread that has <b>a</b> <b>crisper</b> crust and more open texture, and in Rome, it is often {{seasoned}} with marjoram.|$|R

5|$|During 1997, BK revamped its French fries in North America. The {{improved}} fries were {{coated with}} a layer of potato-based starch, giving the fries <b>a</b> <b>crisp</b> shell that maintained its texture longer. The company introduced them in a series of advertisements that claimed the new fries tasted better than McDonald's fries in consumer taste comparisons. Other ads featured Mr. Potato Head in a series of demographically-targeted commercials. The fries were in research and development for over two years and already had been available in several markets when the advertising campaign began. In Europe, BK also sells potato wedges, a type of French fry that is thick-cut and wedge-shaped. In 1991, the company introduced Twister fries, spiral-cut fries with a spicy coating, as part of a promotional push. Part of the product's appeal was they were served in a paper drink cup as opposed to the normal fry carton. The product was designed as a short-term promotion that would be periodically reintroduced.|$|E
5|$|In the Pacific Northwest {{there is}} a stark {{contrast}} in Riesling production. The grape is currently {{on the rise in}} Washington State but on the decline in neighboring Oregon. Riesling from this area ranges from dry to sweet, and has <b>a</b> <b>crisp</b> lightness that bodes well for easy drinking. Often there will be an easily detectable peach and mineral complex. Some Washington State winemakers, such as Chateau Ste. Michelle, are adapting German-style Riesling production methods, and even partnering with well-known German vintners like Dr. Ernest Loosen to create specialty wines such as the Eroica Riesling. With annual productions of over 2,000,000 cases a year, Chateau Ste. Michelle is the worldwide leader in the production of Riesling wines by volume. In 2007 Pacific Rim Winemakers, another Pacific Northwest winery and owned by Randall Grahm of Bonny Doon, has built the first wine facility in Red Mountain AVA dedicated completely to Riesling production.|$|E

50|$|Pinot blanc {{has also}} been {{confused}} with Chardonnay, and wineries often vinify it in a similar style, using barrel fermentation, new oak and malolactic fermentation. It can also be treated more lightly and made into <b>a</b> <b>crisper</b> wine that still has some ability to age.|$|R
25|$|The {{most common}} presentations are pastry cream, whipped cream, or ice cream filling, topped with {{powdered}} sugar or chocolate ganache and possibly more whipped cream. They are also served plain, with <b>a</b> <b>crisp</b> caramel glaze, iced, or with fruit.|$|E
25|$|Pinot gris (Pinot grigio) is planted {{extensively}} the Venice {{region of}} Italy. The colour of these grapes {{range from a}} copper yellow to light pink. It typically has <b>a</b> <b>crisp</b> fruity flavour which allows for a versatile food pairing.|$|E
25|$|In {{computer}} science, a rough set, {{first described}} by Polish computer scientist Zdzisław I. Pawlak, is a formal approximation of <b>a</b> <b>crisp</b> set (i.e., conventional set) {{in terms of}} a pair of sets which give the lower and the upper approximation of the original set. In the standard version of rough set theory (Pawlak 1991), the lower- and upper-approximation sets are crisp sets, but in other variations, the approximating sets may be fuzzy sets.|$|E
50|$|The {{capacitive}} {{design is}} widely considered superior {{to that of the}} later membrane design used on the Model M. It has a lighter actuation force of about 60g, <b>a</b> <b>crisper</b> feel and louder feedback, and is more robust. It also has a higher MTBF of over 100 million keypresses, and full n-key rollover.|$|R
5000|$|Tayto <b>Crisps</b> is <b>a</b> <b>crisps</b> and popcorn {{manufacturer}} {{within the}} Republic of Ireland, founded by Joe Murphy in 1954. Tayto invented the first flavoured crisp production process. Tayto <b>crisps</b> are <b>a</b> cultural phenomenon {{throughout much of}} the Republic of Ireland, and [...] "Tayto" [...] is used by many people in the Republic of Ireland, particularly in rural areas, as <b>a</b> metonym for <b>crisps.</b> In November 2010, Tayto opened their own theme park called [...] "Tayto Park" [...] near Ashbourne, County Meath.|$|R
40|$|Potato crisps {{were ranked}} {{in order of}} {{crispness}} by a taste panel. The crisps were then tested mechanically, using Weibull's model {{for the analysis of}} the data. This showed that <b>a</b> <b>crisper</b> <b>crisp</b> breaks at <b>a</b> higher force. The speed of breakdown of the crisp during chewing is proportional to the Weibull modulus. The Weibull analysis enables the scattered data produced by a brittle material to be forced to conform to a linear model, and to be numerically comparable between tests. This is not possible with comparisons between taste panels, which can only compare ranking order...|$|R
25|$|The term Hearts and Arrows {{is used to}} {{describe}} the visual effect achieved in a round brilliant cut diamond with perfect symmetry and angles that exhibit <b>a</b> <b>crisp</b> and complete pattern of Hearts & Arrows. When viewed under a special magnifying viewer, a complete and precise visual pattern of 8 hearts is seen while looking down through the pavilion, and 8 arrows can be seen when viewing the stone in the table up position.|$|E
25|$|Dried {{fennel seed}} is an aromatic, anise-flavored spice, brown or green in color when fresh, slowly turning a dull grey as the seed ages. For cooking, green seeds are optimal. The leaves are delicately flavored and similar in shape {{to those of}} dill. The bulb is <b>a</b> <b>crisp</b> {{vegetable}} that can be sautéed, stewed, braised, grilled, or eaten raw. Young tender leaves are used for garnishes, as a salad, to add flavor to salads, to flavor sauces to be served with puddings, and also in soups and fish sauce.|$|E
25|$|Dried mopane worms can {{be eaten}} raw as <b>a</b> <b>crisp</b> snack; however, in Botswana people {{tend not to}} eat the head. Alternatively, mopane worms can be soaked to rehydrate, before being fried until they are crunchy, or cooked with onion, {{tomatoes}} and spices and then served with pap or sadza. The flesh is yellow, and the gut may still contain fragments of dried leaf, which is not harmful to humans. The taste of dried leaves, if not removed, is somewhat reminiscent of tea leaves. Dried mopane worms are frequently canned/packaged in tomato sauce or chili sauce to enhance the flavor.|$|E
