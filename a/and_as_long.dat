5|$|In {{order to}} qualify for hospice care, a patient must have {{certification}} from two physicians {{that he or she}} has less than six months to live if his or her disease runs its natural course; usually the patient's primary physician and the Hospice Medical Director will provide this certification. Patients can and do stay on hospice longer than six months, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as the hospice team continues to certify with supporting evidence that the patient is terminal, insurance companies will usually continue to pay for hospice care.|$|E
5|$|Stealth {{is based}} on {{limiting}} the player character's visibility; hiding behind objects and buildings, avoiding the enemies' cone of vision, and avoiding lighted areas aid in reducing detection. When hiding behind an object, the player can lean around the sides to see the immediate area and eavesdrop, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as Corvo remains hidden, his enemies will not see him. The player can also look through keyholes to gain insight into closed rooms. Sneaking up behind enemies allows the player to silently subdue them, and unconscious or dead bodies can be moved and hidden.|$|E
5|$|Deterioration of whale {{carcasses}} happens {{though a}} series of three stages. Initially, moving organisms such as sharks and hagfish, scavenge the soft tissues at a rapid rate over a period of months, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as two years. This is followed by the colonization of bones and surrounding sediments (which contain organic matter) by enrichment opportunists, such as crustaceans and polychaetes, throughout a period of years. Finally, sulfophilic bacteria reduce the bones releasing hydrogen sulfide enabling the growth of chemoautotrophic organisms, which in turn, support other organisms such as mussels, clams, limpets, and sea snails. This stage may last for decades and supports a rich assemblage of species, averaging 185 species per site.|$|E

5|$|Rocksteady {{intended}} for Batman, Catwoman, and Robin to offer three different playing experiences. Other villains from Batman's comic history {{were selected to}} show that the prison was a melting pot of people from Gotham. The developers believed that providing a small part of each villain's story rather than focusing on a select few allowed the player to meet many more characters and effectively conveyed the feeling of being in a superprison filled with supervillains. Rocksteady decided early on that the Joker would die in the story, and developed the idea of him poisoning Batman with the same affliction, in order to show how the two diametrically opposed characters would interact in pursuit of a shared goal. Warner Bros. and Dini did not oppose killing off the character {{as long as it was}} not done for shock value, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as they made it clear that Batman was not at fault, since he would not intentionally kill someone.|$|E

25|$|Nasal administration: Oxytocin is a peptide that is {{effectively}} {{distributed to the}} brain when administered intranasally via a nasal spray, after which it reliably crosses the blood–brain barrier and exhibits psychoactive effects in humans. No serious adverse effects with short-term application of oxytocin with 18~40nbsp&IU (36-80nbsp&mcg) have been recorded. Intranasal oxytocin has a central duration of at least 2.25nbsp&hours <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as 4nbsp&hours.|$|E

25|$|Indeed, it's {{clearly in}} the {{interest}} of Africa to play one side against the other, and to avoid alliances between China and the West, which might work to decrease raw material prices.

Pursuing democracy and transparency is no longer the sole model; development is, for sure, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as African leaders can provide it, their power will be that much assured.|$|E

25|$|On 28 December 1914 the Sagene Line was {{extended}} via Bentse Bridge to Torshov, where it intersected with the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line. This allowed KSS {{to start a}} circle service, which it named Sagene Ring and numbered 0. It initially used white signs for the counter-clockwise inside ring and green signs fort he clockwise outer circle. Thus the service would run along the Sagene Line and then connect down along the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line. The headway was set to five minutes, which required eight trams per direction. At Sagene they took a five-minute break, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as they were on time passengers could transfer to the next tram and save the break.|$|E
25|$|Friction dampers {{tend to be}} {{available}} in two major types, linear and rotational and dissipate energy by heat. The damper operates {{on the principle of}} a coulomb damper. Depending on the design, friction dampers can experience stick-slip phenomenon and Cold welding. The main disadvantage being that friction surfaces can wear over time and for this reason they are not recommended for dissipating wind loads. When used in seismic applications wear is not a problem and there is no required maintenance. They have a rectangular hysteretic loop <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as the building is sufficiently elastic they tend to settle back to their original positions after an earthquake.|$|E

25|$|A {{stallion}} {{will defend}} his group from other males. When challenged, the stallion issues {{a warning to}} the invader by rubbing nose or shoulder with him. If the warning is not heeded, a fight breaks out. Zebra fights often become very violent, with the animals biting at each other's necks, heads or legs, wrestling to the ground, and occasional kicking. Sometimes a stallion will lie still {{on the ground as}} if surrendering, but once the other male lets up, will strike and continue the fight. Most fighting occurs over young mares in estrus, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as a harem stallion is healthy, he will usually not be challenged. Only unhealthy stallions have their harems taken over, and even then the new stallion gradually takes over pushing the old one out without a fight.|$|E
25|$|There are, however, {{some key}} differences. One is that, {{unlike in the}} United States, where a {{consumer}} is allowed only one free copy of their credit report a year, in Canada, the consumer may order a free copy of their credit report any number of times in a year, {{as long as the}} request is made in writing, <b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as the consumer asks for a printed copy to be delivered by mail. This request by the consumer is noted in the credit report as a 'soft inquiry', but it has no effect on their credit score. According to Equifax's ScorePower Report, Equifax Beacon scores range from 300 to 900. Trans Union Emperica scores also range from 300 and 900.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{players in}} {{the first few months of}} a new {{contract}} are subject to base year compensation (BYC). The intent of BYC is to prevent teams from re-signing players to salaries specifically targeted to match other salaries in a trade (in other words, salary should be based on basketball value, not trade value). A BYC player's trade value as outgoing salary is 50% of his new salary, or his previous salary, whichever is greater. BYC applies only to players who re-sign with their previous team and receive a raise greater than 20%. It also applies only when (<b>and</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as) the team is over the salary cap. Under the 2011 CBA, players subject to BYC cannot be traded before January 15 except in a sign-and-trade, and BYC is only applied to outgoing salary in sign-and-trade deals.|$|E
