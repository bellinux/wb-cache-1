We prospectively investigated the efficacy of an anticholinergic or antidiuretic agent as add-on therapy for nocturia in men previously treated with an <b>alpha-blocker</b> for LUTS. Subjects and methods: Patients were randomly subdivided into two groups. All patients had a 4 -week washout. Group A had <b>alpha-blocker</b> for 4 weeks, then an <b>alpha-blocker</b> plus an anticholinergic agent for 4 weeks, and, finally, 4 weeks of an <b>alpha-blocker</b> plus an antidiuretic agent. Group B had an <b>alpha-blocker</b> for 4 weeks, then an <b>alpha-blocker</b> plus an antidiuretic agent for 4 weeks, and, finally, 4 weeks of an <b>alpha-blocker</b> plus an anticholinergic agent. In both groups, patients were subdivided into nocturnal polyuria, decreased nocturnal bladder capacity (NBC), or nocturia by both causes subgroups. A 3 -day voiding diary, total International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), IPSS sub-scores, Overactive Bladder Symptom Score, uroflowmetry, and post-void residual urine volume, were assessed at baseline, and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Results: A total of 405 patients completed the study. During treatment, the changes from baseline in total IPSS and IPSS sub-scores were significantly decreased at 4 weeks and were maintained for 12 weeks. In the nocturnal polyuria subgroup of Groups A and B, the number of episodes of nocturia in 3 days, nocturnal urine volume, and nocturnal index were significantly decreased using an <b>alpha-blocker</b> plus an antidiuretic agent. In the decreased NBC subgroup of Groups A and B, IPSS storage sub-score, Overactive Bladder Symptom Score, number of episodes of nocturia in 3 days, number of episodes of urgency in 3 days, and NBC index were all significantly decreased using an <b>alpha-blocker</b> plus an anticholinergic agent.

Inclusion criteria were men with BPH who had PV ≧ 30 ml and international prostate symptom score (IPSS) ≧ 8 or quality of life (QOL) index ≧ 3 under <b>alpha-blocker</b> monotherapy for more than 3 months. At the baseline, 12 and 24 weeks after dutasteride add-on, we assessed IPSS, overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS), PV, serum PSA and testosterone. Among 47 patients (65 %) with OAB diagnosed by OABSS, responders were defined as those with urgency score of OABSS ＜ 2 or total score of OABSS ＜ 3. At the 24 th week, dutasteride significantly improved IPSS (− 4. 2) and OABSS (− 1. 9) and reduced PV (− 29 %) compared with the baseline. Furthermore, dutasteride significantly decreased serum PSA (− 45 %) and increased testosterone (36 %).

40|$|BACKGROUND: During {{surgical}} treatment of pheochromocytoma,`haemodynamic instability may occur. To prevent this, patients receive preoperative treatment with an <b>alpha-blocker.</b> Nowadays, some centres use phenoxybenzamine, while others use doxazosin. The {{purpose of this}} review is to analyse the current evidence of the benefits and risks of phenoxybenzamine and doxazosin in the preoperative treatment of pheochromocytoma. METHODS: The literature was reviewed by searching PubMed using the following search terms: pheochromocytoma, phenoxybenzamine, doxazosin and alpha-blockade. The filter was set on English language. RESULTS: No randomised controlled trials were found. Five follow-up studies comparing phenoxybenzamine and doxazosin {{in the treatment of}} pheochromocytoma were retrieved and analysed. There was a trend that systolic arterial pressure is slightly better controlled by phenoxybenzamine. However, this resulted in more pronounced postoperative hypotension as well. The use of an <b>alpha-blocker</b> was often accompanied by other vasoactive agents. phenoxybenzamine was often accompanied by a beta-blocker to control reflex tachycardia, while patients on doxazosin received significantly more additional antihypertensive medicines. Most of the studies showed that the use of vasoactive drugs and fluid infusion does not differ significantly between the two drugs. Phenoxybenzamine caused significantly more orthostatic hypotension, oedema and complaints of a stuffy nose. CONCLUSION: On the basis of the current evidence, there is no evidently superior <b>alpha-blocker</b> for the pretreatment of patients with pheochromocytoma. Perioperative haemodynamics seem to be slightly better controlled with phenoxybenzamine, at the cost of more pronounced postoperative hypotension.

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{whether there is}} a difference in the risk of progressing to BPH-related prostatic surgery between patients using <b>alpha-blockers</b> and patients using the 5 -alpha-reductase inhibitors (5 -ARIs). Methods: A population-based cohort study was conducted, using data from the PHARMO Record Linkage System. We identified 5671 patients ({{greater than or equal to}} 50 years old, no history of using both alpha-Mockers and 5 -ARIs, more than one year of database history prior to the first date of BPH drug-dispensing), who filled at least one prescription for either <b>alpha-blockers</b> (alfuzosin, tamsulosin, terazosin) or 5 -ARIs (finasteride). The incidence of BPH-related surgery was compared between patients treated with <b>alpha-blockers</b> and patients treated with 5 -ARIs. Results: The cumulative incidence of BPH-related prostatic surgery was 15. 2 % and mainly involved transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) (13. 4 %). Patients using alpha-Mockers had a significantly increased risk of BPH-related prostatic surgery compared to patients using 5 -ARIs, which remained after adjusting for age, calendar time, type of prescriber and chronic disease score (adjusted HR: 1. 52, 95 % CI: 1. 24 - 1. 88). The difference between <b>alpha-blockers</b> and 5 -ARIs was sustained after stratification of time period (< 1995, greater than or equal to 1995) and exclusion of patients with prostatic surgery within one month of treatment initiation. Conclusions: It is concluded that alpha-Mocker treated patients had a higher risk of BPH-related surgery compared to 5 -ARI treated patients.

Benign prostatic {{hyperplasia}} (BPH) {{pharmacological treatment}} may promote {{a decrease in}} prostate vascularization and bladder neck relaxation with theoretical improvement in prostate biopsy morbidity, though never explored in the literature. Methods. Among 242 consecutive unselected patients who underwent prostate biopsy, after excluding those with history of prostate biopsy/surgery or using medications not for BPH, we studied 190 patients. On the 15 th day after procedure patients were questioned about symptoms lasting over a week and classified according to pharmacological BPH treatment. Results. Thirty-three patients (17 %) were using <b>alpha-blocker</b> exclusively, five (3 %) 5 -alpha-reductase inhibitor exclusively, twelve (6 %) patients used both medications, and 140 (74 %) patients used none.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundDysfunctional voiding is an {{abnormality}} of bladder emptying in neurologically normal individuals {{where the}} external sphincter activity increases during voiding, {{and it is}} difficult to diagnose by symptoms alone. Videourodynamic study could provide great help in differentiating dysfunctional voiding and other voiding disorder. In this retrospective study, we analyze the videourodynamic parameters of the patients with dysfunctional voiding. PurposeTo investigate the clinical presentations and videourodynamic characteristics of adult women with dysfunctional voiding (DV). MethodsA total of 1605 women with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were investigated with videourodynamic (VUD) studies from 1997 to 2010. The clinical urinary symptoms and VUD characteristics of DV were compared with a group of urodynamically normal controls. Antimuscarinic or <b>alpha-blocker</b> treatment, with or without a skeletal muscle relaxant according to the chief complaint was given. ResultsThere were 168 women diagnosed with DV. Detrusor overactivity (DO) occurred in 69 % of women with DV. Patients with DV had significantly lower cystometric bladder capacity, higher detrusor pressure, lower maximum flow rate, and larger post-void residual volume than the controls. A total of 114 (67. 9 %) patients had storage symptoms and 54 (32. 1 %) had voiding symptoms as their chief complaints among those with DV. Among them, urinary frequency (n =  69, 41. 1 %) was the most common chief complaint, followed by dysuria (n =  54, 32. 1 %), and urgency incontinence (n =  26, 15. 5 %). The incidence of urgency incontinence and dysuria were significantly greater than that in the control group, however, the incidence of frequency, urgency, or nocturia showed no significant difference between DV and control groups. Recurrent UTI was a common adverse event, and happened in 20 patients (12 %) with DV. The medication, <b>alpha-blocker</b> or antimuscarinic agent, was prescribed to the patients with DV according to their symptoms. The success rates were 41. 2 % (n =  47) for antimuscarinic therapy and 51. 9 % (n =  28) for <b>alpha-blocker</b> therapy in patients with storage and voiding LUTS, respectively (p =  0. 366).

RESULTS: Adjusting for age, sex, intravesical stent length, stent indwelling time, use of analgesics and an <b>alpha-blocker,</b> {{the correlation between the}} Ureteral Stent Symptom Questionnaire and self-developed questions was - 0. 40 (95...|$|E
40|$|Context: This review {{focuses on}} the {{contemporary}} role of antimuscarinics {{in the management of}} men with symptoms of bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) and concomitant overactive bladder (OAB). Safety issues of antimuscarinics in this subpopulation of men are also reviewed. Objective: We reviewed the current literature and performed an analysis of the efficacy, suitability, and the safety of antimuscarinics in this subpopulation of men. Evidence acquisition: We performed a systematic search of Medline/PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for relevant articles published between 1990 and September 2010, restricted to studies in humans published in English. In addition, published abstracts presented at the annual meetings of the European Association of Urology, the American Urological Association, and the International Continence Society in the last decade (2000 - 2010) were hand-searched and evaluated. Each article's title and abstract were reviewed for their appropriateness and relevance to the use of antimuscarinics in patients with BOO and concomitant OAB. Relevant articles were fully reviewed and included in the final data acquisition. Evidence synthesis: Treatment options include combination treatment with <b>alpha-blockers</b> and antimuscarinics, sequential use of <b>alpha-blockers</b> and antimuscarinics, monotherapy with antimuscarinics, and a combination of antimuscarinics and 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors. The sequential use of <b>alpha-blockers</b> and antimuscarinics seems to be the most appropriate approach, and the use of antimuscarinics and <b>alpha-blockers</b> appears generally to be safe and efficacious. Data are insufficient for a possible stratification of patients for a specific sequence of the drugs reviewed. Conclusions: This review infers that the existing data confirm the safety of antimuscarinics administered for the treatment of these patients. The efficacy of antimuscarinics has been proven in different trials regarding different storage symptomend points, but not all end points regarding OAB reached significance. All the reported trials are of short duration (4 - 12 wk) and include only men with low postvoid residual urine volumes at baseline (< 200 ml). Overall, the addition of an antimuscarinic to the treatment of a patient with BOO and concomitant OAB seems to offer an amelioration of the symptoms and a moderate improvement in quality of life.

Several drugs sharing one of the various pharmacological activities of CPZ were tested in endotoxin-treated mice. It was found that <b>alpha-blockers</b> (prazosin, idazoxan, phenoxybenzamine), antiserotoninergics (methysergide, methergoline) and antihistamine (chlorpheniramine, promethazine) also inhibited TNF production indicating that the effectiveness of CPZ in protecting from endotoxin shock is due to its multiple pharmacological activities...|$|R

The paper demonstrates that the efficient chronic prostatitis treatment requires the new UPOINT prostatitis classification rather than traditional VIN NIDDK (1995) classification.
