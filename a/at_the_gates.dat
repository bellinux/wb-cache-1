5|$|Gens {{also came}} into {{conflict}} with the Judenrat and Friend over the Jewish policemen who guarded the gates into the ghetto. The Germans allowed the Jewish policemen to control access to the ghetto and conduct searches for contraband. Gens' policy was that when no Germans were present <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gates,</b> the policemen would do minimal searches and would allow smuggling of food and other necessary items. If Germans were present <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gates,</b> the policemen conducted thorough searches and often beat up attempted smugglers. In Gens' view, if the Germans thought the Jewish policemen were not vigilant enough, the policemen would be replaced by German guards and any opportunity for smuggling would cease. He also claimed that even when the Germans were present, any confiscated items were brought into the ghetto, which {{would not be the}} case if there were German guards <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gates.</b>|$|E
5|$|Andrés Torrón of El Observador noted a {{similarity}} between Almendra and Pink Floyd's 1967 album, The Piper <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gates</b> of Dawn. Almendra lyrics (primarily by Spinetta) {{have been widely}} studied for their lyricism, poetic quality, precise use of language, and rich visual imagery; {{as well as the}} innovation of singing them in Spanish.|$|E

50|$|The festival was {{originally}} planned for two days, but a free Saturday evening show was added. Sunday tickets went for $7.00 for advance tickets and $9.50 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate,</b> while Monday prices were $8.00 {{in advance and}} $10.50 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate.</b> Tickets for <b>the</b> entire cost $13.00 in advance and $16.00 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> (an estimated $83.00 and $102.00, respectively, in 2015 dollars).|$|R

5|$|Fifteen {{years after}} the fall of the Bulgarian capital Preslav, the victory <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gates</b> of Trajan {{extended}} the Bulgarian successes achieved since 976. Later on Tsar Samuil moved the capital from Preslav in the northeast to Ohrid in the southwest. The memory of the great victory over Basil II was preserved thirty years later in the Bitola inscription of Ivan Vladislav (1015–1018), the son of Aron.|$|E
5|$|Koppány was besieging Veszprém {{when he was}} {{informed}} of the arrival of Stephen's army. In the ensuing battle, Stephen won a decisive victory over his enemies. Koppány was killed on the battlefield. His body was quartered and its parts were displayed <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> of the forts of Esztergom, Győr, Gyulafehérvár (Alba Iulia, Romania) and Veszprém in order to threaten {{all of those who}} were conspiring against the young monarch.|$|E
5|$|Renoart of Nephin pillaged the {{countryside}} and led his troops to Tripoli in late 1204. Bohemond lost an eye in a battle <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> of the town. He could only crush the rebellion after Aimery of Cyprus and Jerusalem died in April 1205. He captured both Nephin and Gibelcar {{before the end of}} the year, forcing Renart to flee to Cyprus. Before long, Bohemond returned to Antioch.|$|E
5000|$|Due {{to complex}} {{behavior}} of fluids around {{some of the}} structures such as orifices, gates, and weirs etc., some assumptions are made for the theoretical analysis of the stage-discharge relationship. For example, in case of <b>gates,</b> <b>the</b> pressure <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> opening is non-hydrostatic which is difficult to model; however, {{it is known that}} <b>the</b> pressure <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> is very small. Therefore, engineers assume that the pressure is zero <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> opening and following equation is obtained for discharge: ...|$|R

5|$|Richard William Wright (28 July 1943– 15 September 2008) was an English musician, composer, singer, and songwriter. He was {{a founder}} member, keyboardist, and vocalist of the {{progressive}} rock band Pink Floyd, performing on {{all but one of}} the group's albums including The Piper <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gates</b> of Dawn, The Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here and The Division Bell, and playing on all of their tours.|$|E
5|$|The Menara {{gardens are}} located {{to the west}} of the city, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> of the Atlas mountains. They were built around 1130 by the Almohad ruler Abd al-Mu'min. The name menara derives from the {{pavilion}} with its small green pyramid roof (menzeh). The pavilion was built during the 16th century Saadi dynasty and renovated in 1869 by sultan Abderrahmane of Morocco, who used to stay here in summertime.|$|E
5|$|Chlomo {{missed his}} freedom by three months. The Soviets had liberated Auschwitz 11 days earlier, and the Americans were {{making their way}} towards Buchenwald. Eliezer is {{transferred}} to the children's block where he stays with 600 others, dreaming of soup. On 5 April 1945 the inmates are told the camp is to be liquidated and {{they are to be}} moved—another death march. On 11 April, with 20,000 inmates still inside, a resistance movement inside the camp attacks the remaining SS officers and takes control. At six o'clock that evening, an American tank arrives <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gates,</b> and behind it the Sixth Armored Division of the United States Third Army.|$|E

50|$|Each of <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> towers has {{two floors}} and <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> {{features}} protective wall extensions which restrict access from the sides, a feature {{which is designed}} to prevent surprise ambush from an enemy hiding <b>at</b> <b>the</b> side of <b>the</b> <b>gate.</b> <b>The</b> ambush avoidance feature is further augmented by the terrain which slopes upward <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate.</b> <b>The</b> thickness of <b>the</b> wall <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> is 1.9 m. There are ruins of a forewall in front of <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> which could have functioned as an installation of a large iron structure which would have secured <b>the</b> <b>gate.</b>|$|R

5|$|Former guitarist Scott Danough {{has said}} that he is {{influenced}} by metal and hardcore bands, like <b>At</b> <b>The</b> <b>Gates,</b> Slayer, Cradle of Filth, Integrity and Earth Crisis. Vocalist Brandan Schieppati has also mentioned American thrash metal bands as an influence on Bleeding Through, e.g. Testament or Exodus. In an interview, guitarist Brian Leppke added Cro-Mags, Entombed, Crowbar and Pantera as well to the list of influences. Lastly, keyboardist Marta Peterson is the one who brings industrial, symphonic black metal, and goth inspirations to the band's sound.|$|E
5|$|However, the League of Lezhë {{defeated}} {{both the}} Venetian {{forces and the}} Ottoman expedition. The League won over the Venetian forces on 23 July 1448 <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> of Scutari, and over the Ottomans three weeks later, on 14 August 1448, at the Battle of Oronichea. The Republic was, thereafter, left with few soldiers to defend Venetian Albania. As a result, the League soon signed peace with the Republic of Venice, while continuing {{the war against the}} Ottoman Empire. After the Albanian–Venetian War of 1447–1448, Venice did not seriously challenge Skanderbeg or the League, allowing Skanderbeg to focus his campaigns against the Ottoman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Monday {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of organised action, even as order broke down in the streets, especially <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gates,</b> and the fire raged unchecked. Bloodworth was responsible as Lord Mayor for co-ordinating the fire-fighting, but he had apparently left the City; his name is not mentioned in any contemporaneous accounts of the Monday's events. In this state of emergency, Charles again overrode the City authorities and put his brother James, Duke of York in charge of operations.|$|E

5|$|Renoart of Nephin, who {{had married}} an heiress in the County of Tripoli without Bohemond's consent, rose up against Bohemond in late 1204. He routed Bohemond <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> of Tripoli. Leo seized the Antiochene fortresses in the Amanus Mountains, which {{controlled}} the road towards Antioch. He laid siege to the fortress at Trapessac on 25December 1205, but Az-Zahir Ghazi's troops routed his army. After crushing Renoart of Nephin's revolt, Bohemond returned to Antioch, forcing Leo {{to sign a}} truce for eight years in summer 1206.|$|E
5|$|The Piper <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>Gates</b> of Dawn is {{the debut}} studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, {{and the only}} one made under {{founding}} member Syd Barrett's leadership. The album, named after the title of chapter seven of Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows and featuring a kaleidoscopic cover photo of the band taken by Vic Singh, was recorded from February to May 1967 and released on 5 August 1967. It was produced by Beatles engineer Norman Smith and released in 1967 by EMI Columbia in the United Kingdom and Tower in the United States, in August and October respectively.|$|E
5|$|After a {{long period}} of {{repression}} by the Dutch colonial government, ethnic Chinese in Batavia (modern day Jakarta) revolted on 7 October 1740, killing fifty Dutch troops in Meester Cornelis (now Jatinegara) and Tanah Abang. This revolt was quashed by Governor-General Adriaan Valckenier, who sent 1,800 troops, together with schutterij (militia) and eleven battalions of conscripts, to the two areas; they imposed a curfew on all Chinese inside the city walls to prevent them from plotting against the Dutch. When a group of 10,000 ethnic Chinese from nearby Tangerang and Bekasi was stopped <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> the following day, Valckenier called an emergency meeting of the council for 9 October. The day of the meeting, the Dutch and other ethnic groups in Batavia began to kill all ethnic Chinese in the city, resulting in an estimated 10,000 deaths over two weeks.|$|E

5|$|Benton, Bauer and {{the boys}} are spotted by Iké's helicopter. While they flee into the forest, Benton steps on a land mine. With little time to disarm it, Benton urges Bauer to leave, so he can buy time. When he is {{surrounded}} by Iké and his men, Benton takes his foot off the trigger and detonates the mine, killing himself and the rebels, though Iké survives. Bauer and the children continue to the capital, where he defeats another rebel ambush. <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> of the embassy, Trammel denies the children entry and blackmails Bauer into surrendering for the children's safety. He reluctantly accepts, thus sacrificing his freedom. While Taylor is inaugurated President, Bauer and the children evacuate, leaving chaotic Sangala behind.|$|E
5|$|In February 1082, Dyrrhachium fell after a Venetian or Amalfian citizen {{opened the}} gates to the Normans. The Norman army {{proceeded}} to take most of northern Greece without facing much resistance. While Guiscard was in Kastoria, messengers arrived from Italy, bearing news that Apulia, Calabria, and Campania were in revolt. He {{also learned that}} the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry IV, was <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> of Rome and besieging Pope Gregory VII, a Norman ally. Alexios had negotiated with Henry and given him 360,000 gold pieces in return for an alliance. Henry responded by invading Italy and attacking the Pope. Guiscard rushed to Italy, leaving Bohemond {{in command of the}} army in Greece.|$|E
5|$|In February, the Germans {{allowed the}} Judenrat {{to set up}} a {{judicial}} system. Before this, justice was administered solely by Gens and his policemen; after this, Gens' department still retained some judicial functions over injuries to policemen, escapes from the jail, or leaving the ghetto without leave. In June 1942, Gens took the responsibility for carrying out the death sentence imposed on five men from the ghetto who had been convicted of murder. A sixth man, convicted of committing a murder in another ghetto, was hanged at the same time. Some residents accused the Jewish police force of taking bribes <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> leading into the ghetto. The police also organized parties which were occasionally attended by Gestapo.|$|E
