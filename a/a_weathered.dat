At the time of sale, The Mail on Sunday said of Pike, [...] "Stooped and shrunken, his face looks like <b>a</b> <b>weathered</b> Easter Island statue and when he walks he shuffles unsteadily, bowed by a life of excess. Pike's powers are fading." [...] A 2008 Sky Living TV documentary also showed him and the hotel in an unfavourable light, and {{it appeared to be}} living on its past reputation.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>weathering</b> rind is <b>a</b> discolored, {{chemically}} altered, outer zone or {{layer of}} a discrete rock fragment {{formed by the}} processes of weathering. The inner boundary of <b>a</b> <b>weathering</b> rind approximately parallels the outer surface of the rock fragment {{in which it has}} developed. Rock fragments with weathering rinds normally are discrete clasts, ranging in size from pebbles to cobbles or boulders. They typically occur either lying {{on the surface of the}} ground or buried within sediments such as alluvium, colluvium, or glacial till. <b>A</b> <b>weathering</b> rind represents the alteration of the outer portion of a rock by exposure to air or near surface groundwater over a period of time. Typically, <b>a</b> <b>weathering</b> rind may be enriched with either iron or manganese (or both), and silica, and oxidized to a yellowish red to reddish color. Often <b>a</b> <b>weathering</b> rind exhibits multiple bands of differing colors.|$|R
500|$|A {{survey by}} the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire in 1937 also noted the early 18th-century communion rails, a plain oak communion table dated 1731, and a wooden font cover dated 1714. Other memorials, {{including}} parts of an early 14th-century inscribed slab, were also recorded. Three items of church silver {{were included in the}} survey: a cup (dated 1610–1611), a paten (1719) and a flagon (1743). [...] Externally, an 18th-century brass sundial on a slate pedestal was noted, as was <b>a</b> <b>weathered</b> decorated stone on the lychgate, thought to be from the 10th century. The Arts and Crafts Movement pulpit was made in 1920.|$|E
500|$|In North America {{the fungus}} {{began to be}} {{reported}} in the late 19th century, first from Colorado by Charles Horton Peck, and later from Florida, collected by Lucien Underwood in 1891; both findings were reported by Andrew Price Morgan in April 1892. In 1897, Melville Thurston Cook also reported having collected it the year before from [...] "Albino Beach". Curtis Gates Lloyd described Bovistoides simplex from a South African specimen in 1919, but in 1942, William Henry Long examined that specimen and concluded that it was <b>a</b> <b>weathered</b> spore sac of M.coliforme that had become detached from the outer star-shaped exoperidium.

500|$|Like many lichens {{that grow}} on rocky substrates, Physcia caesia {{is able to}} {{accumulate}} a number of necessary nutrients—including nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and iron—from the substrate upon which it grows, {{as well as from}} rainwater and atmospheric dust.

500|$|The {{next two}} major attacks {{took place in}} Matawan Creek {{near the town of}} Keyport on Wednesday, July 12. Located 30miles (48km) north of Spring Lake and inland of Raritan Bay, Matawan resembled a Midwestern town rather than an Atlantic beach resort. Matawan's {{location}} made it an unlikely site for shark-human interaction. When Thomas Cottrell, a sea captain and Matawan resident, spotted an 8ft (2.40m) long shark in the creek, the town dismissed him. Around 2:00p.m. local boys, including epileptic Lester Stilwell, 11, were playing in the creek at an area called the Wyckoff dock when they saw what appeared to be an [...] "old black weather-beaten board or <b>a</b> <b>weathered</b> log." [...] A dorsal fin appeared in the water and the boys realized it was a shark. Before Stilwell could climb from the creek, the shark pulled him underwater.|$|E
500|$|The basic {{shape of}} the Predator mask was kept, {{although}} technical details were added and each Predator was given a unique mask to distinguish them from each other. These masks were created using clay, which was used to form moulds to create fiberglass copies. These copies were painted to give <b>a</b> <b>weathered</b> look, which Woodruff claims [...] "is what the Predator is all about". A hydraulic Alien puppet was created so ADI {{would be able to}} make movements faster and give the Alien a [...] "slimline and skeletal" [...] appearance, rather than using an actor in a suit. The puppet required six people to run it; one for the head and body, two for the arms, and a sixth to make sure the signals were reaching the computer. Movements were recorded in the computer so that puppeteers would be able to repeat moves that Anderson liked. The puppet was used in six shots, including the fight scene with the Predator which took one month to film.|$|E

2500|$|In tanuki bonsai, {{a living}} tree is joined to an {{interesting}} piece of deadwood {{to create a}} composite in the driftwood style. The deadwood usually has the form of <b>a</b> <b>weathered</b> tree trunk, or at least its lower portion. To add living material to the deadwood, a groove or channel is first carved into it. The living tree (usually a young juniper, because of the species' vigor, flexibility, and ability to endure harsh shaping) is fixed within the channel using non-reactive nails or screws, wire wrappings, or clamps. Over time, the young tree grows into the deadwood channel, which disguises {{the fact that it}} is a separate entity. Once firmly in place, the nails, screws, or other affixing devices are removed, and the living tree is cultivated and shaped with typical bonsai techniques.|$|E
