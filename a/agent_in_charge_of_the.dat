25|$|The FBI, which {{continues}} to investigate the theft, has said {{it is no longer}} interested in identifying the thieves as the statute of limitations on the crime expired in 1996 and no one can be prosecuted for it (although those knowingly in possession of the stolen works could still be charged for that offense). However, it apparently does not put much credence in the theory that Donati was behind the crime. Kurkjian writes that he shared the details of his conversation with the FBI <b>agent</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> investigation, but at a news conference a month later, the agent did not mention Donati at all and apparently seemed to still be embracing an earlier FBI theory of the crime.|$|E

500|$|The first Paris performance, on 14 November 1958, was disastrous. According to Stephen Walsh, Pierre Boulez {{failed to}} fulfil his {{undertaking}} to obtain adequate performers, {{and those that}} he could obtain broke down several times. The audience response was polite at first, but when Stravinsky refused to return and take a bow, it gradually descended into jeers. Stravinsky said he would never conduct in Paris again. Stravinsky felt humiliated by {{what he called a}} [...] "scandalous concert", writing in his diary immediately after the performance that it was the [...] "unhappiest concert of my life" [...] and blaming Boulez for the result. Robert Craft adds that Boulez had promised to rehearse Threni, but failed to do so. Stravinsky nevertheless had a share in the blame for not cancelling the concert despite the pleas of family and friends, including his wife and Nadia Boulanger. Conceding that the performance was a [...] "catastrophe", Boulez nevertheless insisted that he did in fact participate in the piano rehearsals, together with Stravinsky, whom he had tried in vain to persuade to be more firm with the singers. He concluded that Stravinsky [...] "was not a good conductor; he was a terribly lousy conductor", and the problems with the singers were compounded because [...] "the orchestra had been ill-prepared by Craft". While agreeing that the singers were [...] "absolutely awful", Boulez protested they had been chosen not by himself, but by an <b>agent</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Aix-en-Provence festival.|$|E

[...] Margaret Eppes died approximately one year later, and according to the pilot, Don elicited Charlie's help on two cases between her death and the series pilot. [...] These cases involved IRS extortion and stock fraud. [...] Initially uncertain about what Charlie might actually be able to contribute, he reluctantly allows Charlie to assist with their attempts to track down a rapist and is pleasantly surprised when Charlie's math leads to the suspect's apprehension ("Pilot").|$|E
2500|$|In September 2012 the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) accused Walgreens of {{endangering}} {{public safety}} and barred the company from shipping oxycodone and other controlled drugs from its Jupiter, Florida, distribution center. The DEA said that Walgreens failed to maintain proper controls to ensure it didn't dispense drugs to addicts and drug dealers. [...] The DEA also said that six of Walgreens' Florida pharmacies ordered in excess of a million oxycodone pills a year. [...] In contrast, in 2011, the average pharmacy in the U.S. ordered 73,000 oxycodone tablets a year according to the DEA. [...] One Walgreens pharmacy located in Fort Myers, Florida, ordered 95,800 pills in 2009, but by 2011 this number had jumped to 2.2 million pills in one year. [...] Another example was a Walgreens pharmacy located in Hudson, Fla., a town of 34,000 people near Clearwater, that purchased 2.2 million pills in 2011, the DEA said. [...] Immediate suspension orders are an action taken when the DEA believes a registrant, such as a pharmacy or a doctor, is [...] "an imminent danger to the public safety." [...] All DEA licensees [...] "have an obligation to ensure that medications are getting {{into the hands of}} legitimate patients," [...] said Mark Trouville, former DEA special <b>agent</b> <b>in</b> <b>charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Miami Field Division. [...] "When they choose to look the other way, patients suffer and drug dealers prosper." ...|$|E
60|$|THEY {{tell the}} tale even now among the groves of the Berbulda Hill, and for {{corroboration}} point to the roofless and windowless Mission-house. The great God Dungara, the God of Things as They Are, Most Terrible, One-eyed, Bearing the Red Elephant Tusk, did it all; and he who refuses to believe in Dungara will assuredly be smitten by the Madness of Yat--the madness that fell upon the sons and {{the daughters of the}} Buria Kol when they turned aside from Dungara and put on clothes. So says Athon Daze*, who is High Priest of the shrine and Warden of the Red Elephant Tusk. But if you ask the Assistant Collector and <b>Agent</b> <b>in</b> <b>Charge</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Buria Kol, he will laugh--not because he bears any malice against missions, but because he himself saw the vengeance of Dungara executed upon the spiritual children of the Reverend Justus Krenk, Pastor of the Tubingen Mission, and upon Lotta, his virtuous wife.|$|E
