He added that he had started medical treatment, and had become a vegetarian in hopes of aiding his recovery. He maintains that both his short- and long-term prognosis <b>are</b> <b>good,</b> <b>that</b> the condition should have no long-term effect on his golfing career, and that he currently feels well. He also stated that the arthritis may go into permanent remission after one year of medical treatment. He went on to finish the championship T12, five shots behind winner Martin Kaymer.|$|E
25|$|The {{location}} must be well-suited to {{the purpose}} of beaching whales. It is against the law to kill pilot whales at locations with inappropriate conditions. The seabed must gradually slope from the shore out to deep water. Given such conditions, the chances <b>are</b> <b>good</b> <b>that</b> the whales can be driven fully ashore or close enough to the shore that they can be killed from land. When a school of pilot whales is sighted, boats gather behind them and slowly drive them towards the chosen authorized location, usually a bay or the end of a fjord. There are 23 towns, villages or bays (Viðvík is not populated) that have the right conditions, and therefore legal authorization, for beaching whales. These are in alphabetical order: Bøur, Fámjin, Fuglafjørður, Húsavík, Hvalba (and Nes-Hvalba), Hvalvík, Hvannasund, Klaksvík, Leynar, Miðvágur, Norðragøta, Norðskáli, Sandur, Syðrugøta, Tjørnuvík, Tórshavn (in Sandagerð), Tvøroyri, Vágur, Vestmanna, Viðvík (near Hvannasund, but on the east coast of Viðoy) and Øravík.|$|E

500|$|Following Boys Don't Cry, Sevigny had a {{supporting}} role in American Psycho, based on the controversial 1991 novel by Bret Easton Ellis. Sevigny plays the office assistant of Patrick Bateman, played by Christian Bale, a 1980s Manhattan yuppie-turned-serial killer. The film, as was its source novel, was controversial because of its depiction of graphic violence and sexuality in an upper-class Manhattan society. In addition, she reunited with Kids writer and Gummo director Harmony Korine for the experimental Julien Donkey-Boy (1999), playing the pregnant sister of a schizophrenic man. Though it never saw a major theatrical release, it garnered some critical praise; Roger Ebert gave the film his signature thumbs up, referring to it as [...] "Freaks shot by the Blair Witch crew", and continuing to say, [...] "The odds <b>are</b> <b>good</b> <b>that</b> most people will dislike this film and be offended by it. For others, it will provoke sympathy rather than scorn". Sevigny followed Julien with a small part in the drama film A Map of the World (1999), opposite Sigourney Weaver.|$|E
500|$|The Wrecking Crew backed {{dozens of}} popular acts and {{were one of}} the most {{successful}} groups of studio musicians in music history. [...] According to Kent Hartman, [...] "...if a rock-and-roll song came out of an L.A. recording studio from between about 1962 and 1972, the odds <b>are</b> <b>good</b> <b>that</b> some combination of the Wrecking Crew played the instruments. [...] No single group of musicians has ever played on more hits in support of more stars than this superbly talented—yet virtually anonymous group of men (and one woman)". [...] According to The New Yorker, [...] "The Wrecking Crew passed into a history that it largely created, imperfectly acknowledged but perfectly present in hundreds of American pop songs known to all". [...] In 2008, the Wrecking Crew were featured in the documentary film The Wrecking Crew, directed by Tommy Tedesco's son, Denny Tedesco. In 2014, its musicians were depicted in the Brian Wilson biopic Love & Mercy. [...] Two of their members, drummers Hal Blaine and Earl Palmer, were among the inaugural [...] "sidemen" [...] inductees to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000, and the entire Wrecking Crew was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame in 2007.

500|$|Considered a [...] "classic" [...] Disney song, [...] "Part of Your World" [...] {{has since}} {{established}} itself as both The Little Mermaids hallmark song and signature ballad. Believed {{to be responsible}} for introducing [...] "Disney's Broadway age", the song is also credited with making the [...] "I Want" [...] song a popular staple of future animated Disney musical films, at the same time introducing film audiences to a period known as the Disney Renaissance. Latina contributor Sally Mercedes dubbed the song [...] "one of the most memorable Disney songs ever". [...] "Part of Your World" [...] is also considered Benson's signature song, which she claims she has yet to grow tired of singing. Benson believes that the popularity of the song {{is one of the main}} reasons The Little Mermaid was instrumental in helping revive the animated film genre during the 1990s. HitFix contributor Donna Dickens credits much of the film's success with Benson's performance of the song. Time selected [...] "Part of Your World" [...] as one of the Disney Renaissance's most iconic moments, writing, [...] "If you are a female-identified child of the ‘90s, chances <b>are</b> <b>good</b> <b>that</b> you have belted this song into your hairbrush or showerhead on more than one occasion." [...] Billboards Erin Strecker agreed that [...] "every single child has sung [...] into a hairbrush". MetroLyrics considers [...] "Part of Your World" [...] to be among [...] "21 Disney Songs That Are Still The Soundtrack To Our Lives". Yahoo! Movies contributor Gwynne Watkins crowned the song [...] "one of Disney’s all-time greatest character songs". Amy Valm of Today's Parent believes that [...] "Part of Your World" [...] resonated particularly strongly among millennial audiences, it with introducing many of them to the word [...] "reprimand". Music streaming service Deezer revealed that [...] "Part of Your World" [...] was the 19th most streamed Disney song of 2017. It is also one of the [...] "most enduring" [...] songs in the Disney canon.|$|E

[...] Many reviewers found that Mountain Lion was far more stable than its predecessor, including Jason Snell of Macworld, who said [...] "All told, I found Mountain Lion to be a stable, solid release. Even prerelease builds were far more stable than I've come to expect from OS X betas, leading me to wonder if Apple's new annual schedule is leading to more careful incremental updates (with fewer bugs) rather than great leaps (with more, nastier bugs)." ...|$|E
