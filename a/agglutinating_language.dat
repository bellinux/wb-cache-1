2500|$|Hungarian and Finnish, in particular, often simply {{concatenate}} suffixes. For example, Finnish talossanikinko [...] "in my house, too?" [...] {{consists of}} talo-ssa-ni-kin-ko. However, in the Finnic languages (Finnish, Estonian etc.) and the Sami languages, there are processes which affect the root, particularly consonant gradation. The original suffixes may disappear (and appear only by liaison), {{leaving behind the}} modification of the root. This process is extensively developed in Estonian and Sami, and makes them also inflected, not only <b>agglutinating</b> <b>languages.</b> The Estonian illative case, for example, is expressed by a modified root: maja → majja (historical form *maja-han).|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} {{accomplish}} the deep semantic understanding of a language, {{it is essential to}} analyze the meaning of predicate phrases, a content word plus functional expressions. In <b>agglutinating</b> <b>languages</b> such as Japanese, however, sentential predicates are multi-morpheme expressions and all the functional expressions including those unnecessary to the meaning of the predicate are merged into one phrase. This triggers an increase in surface forms, which is problematic for NLP systems. We solve this by introducing simplified surface forms of predicates that retain only the crucial meaning of the functional expressions. We construct paraphrasing rules based on syntactic and semantic theories in linguistics. The results of experiments show that our system achieves the high accuracy of 77 % while reducing the differences in surface forms by 44 %, which is quite close to the performance of manually simplified predicates. ...|$|R

40|$|Sparsity {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{problems}} in natural language processing. The problem becomes even more severe in <b>agglutinating</b> <b>languages</b> that are highly prone to be inflected. We deal with sparsity in Turkish by adopting morphological features for part-of-speech tagging. We learn inflectional and derivational morpheme tags in Turkish by using conditional random fields (CRF) and we employ the morpheme tags in part-of-speech (PoS) tagging by using hidden Markov models (HMMs) to mitigate sparsity. Results show that using morpheme tags in PoS tagging helps alleviate the sparsity in emission probabilities. Our model outperforms other hidden Markov model based PoS tagging models for small training datasets in Turkish. We obtain an accuracy of 94. 1 % in morpheme tagging and 89. 2 % in PoS tagging on a 5 K training dataset.

5000|$|Giving an {{accurate}} estimate {{for the total}} word count is difficult, since {{it is hard to}} define what to call [...] "a word" [...] in <b>agglutinating</b> <b>languages,</b> due to the existence of affixed words and compound words. To have a meaningful definition of compound words, we have to exclude such compounds whose meaning is the mere sum of its elements. The largest dictionaries from Hungarian to another language contain 120,000 words and phrases (but this may include redundant phrases as well, because of translation issues). The new desk lexicon of the Hungarian language contains 75,000 words and the Comprehensive Dictionary of Hungarian Language (to be published in 18 volumes in the next twenty years) will contain 110,000 words. The default Hungarian lexicon is usually estimated to comprise 60,000 to 100,000 words. (Independently of specific languages, speakers actively use at most 10,000 to 20,000 words, with an average intellectual using 25-30 thousand words.) However, all the Hungarian lexemes collected from technical texts, dialects etc. would all together add up to 1,000,000 words.|$|R

40|$|Recursion is {{the process}} of having one‘s own output as its next input to make {{infinite}} sequences. Similarly, recursion in language applies to merging subtle language elements such as combining morphemes to make longer words in <b>agglutinating</b> <b>languages</b> and embedding of subordinate clauses to main clauses such as embeddedness. The present study proposes that recursion could be happening in unification gradient space (i. e., in inferior frontal cortex). Inferior frontal cortex also hosts procedural memory operations such as implicit sequence learning. Therefore, the present study predicts recursion deficits (merging and embeddedness) in children with SLI who are reported to manifest implicit sequence learning deficits. 22 SLI (specific language impairment) and 22 language age matched TD (typically developing) children were selected for the study. They were administered a sequence learning task to measure implicit sequence learning and a story narration task to measure recursiveness. Results showed that children with SLI were significantly poorer compared to TD children on sequence learning as well as on recursion measures. The correlation between sequence learning and recursion was present in TD group and was absent in SLI children. Discussion states that recursion in TD children is a procedural skill and recursion process could have been taken over by intact declarative system in children with SLI...|$|R

The difficulty of this task depends greatly on {{the complexity of the}} morphology (i.e. the structure of words) of the language being considered. English has fairly simple morphology, especially inflectional morphology, and thus it is often possible to ignore this task entirely and simply model all possible forms of a word (e.g. [...] "open, opens, opened, opening") as separate words. In languages such as Turkish or Meitei, a highly <b>agglutinated</b> Indian <b>language,</b> however, such an approach is not possible, as each dictionary entry has thousands of possible word forms.|$|R
5000|$|Vajda's presentations at the 2012 {{workshop}} augmented {{his proposal}} with additional linguistic and non-linguistic evidence. He discussed a study {{he did with}} Johanna Nichols investigating the history of complex prefixing verb structures in various families possessing morphology of this sort. His conclusion was that, contrary to prevailing belief, such structures are often preserved intact with little change over several thousands of years, {{and as a result}} may actually be stronger evidence of a genetic connection than the lexical relationships that are traditionally sought. As a result, he agreed with the consensus belief that lexical evidence of a genetic relationship becomes virtually undetectable after about 8,000 to 10,000 years of linguistic separation, but suggested that certain sorts of complex morphology may remain stable beyond this time period. Further evidence for Dené-Yeniseian is in Vajda's 2013a article [...] "Vestigial possessive morphology in Na-Dene and Yeniseian". Vajda presents comparanda for an ancient Dene-Yeniseian possessive connector prefix (possibly *ŋ) that appears in idiosyncratic ways in Dene (or Athabaskan), Eyak, Tlingit, and Yeniseian nouns, postpositions, directionals, and demonstratives. Vajda also suggests one new lexical cognate: PA directional *ñəs-d [...] "ahead", [...] "out on open water" [...] and Yeniseian root *es [...] "open space". In terms of the sections within Vajda's 2010 paper, this 2013 article can be read as an addition to his §2 (which ends on p. 63). In a subsequent article (Vajda 2013b), Vajda discusses features in Ket that arose due to prolonged areal contact with suffixal <b>agglutinating</b> <b>languages.</b>|$|R
