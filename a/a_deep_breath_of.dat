60|$|Dauncey drew in <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> realisation, and {{his face}} for a moment glowed.|$|E
60|$|Stoutenburg, having gained his point, {{jumped to}} his feet and drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> satisfaction.|$|E
60|$|Ingleby, {{in spite}} of his protestations, drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> relief, but Leger, who {{appeared}} to be recovering now, smiled.|$|E
60|$|She drew <b>a</b> long <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> relief. Then {{she looked}} up {{to him with a}} {{beautiful}} smile.|$|R
60|$|Peter drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> breath--the <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> {{the man who}} braces {{himself up}} and thanks {{whatever}} gods there be for his unconquerable soul.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am still, oh so still. It is like death!" [...] The voice {{faded away}} into <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> as <b>of</b> one sleeping, {{and the open}} eyes closed again.|$|R
6000|$|ANDERSON (exhaling <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> relief, and dabbing his perspiring brow {{with his}} handkerchief). Thank God, I was in time! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Eight," [...] Tyrrel suggested, drawing <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> suspense. It {{was a big}} sum, indeed, for {{a modest}} estate like Penmorgan.|$|E
60|$|The {{thought that}} the scout was at hand to assist them cheered the young officer wonderfully, and he drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> satisfaction.|$|E
60|$|She {{leaned over}} him, and drew <b>a</b> long <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> relief. It was the reward of many weary {{days and nights}} of {{constant}} watching and careful nursing. His reason was saved.|$|R
6000|$|... "There's another fairy story, prettier yet," [...] said Colville, {{while the}} little girl drew <b>a</b> long <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> {{satisfaction}} and expectation. [...] "You've heard of the Buondelmonti?" [...] he asked Imogene.|$|R
60|$|They {{passed out}} into the soft, cool night. A {{nightingale}} was singing somewhere in the elm trees which bordered the garden. The air was sweet with the perfume of early summer flowers. Wrayson drew <b>a</b> long, <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> content.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Milroy drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> relief. [...] "Thank you," [...] she said, {{loud enough}} for her {{daughter}} to hear. [...] "I want nothing more." ...|$|E
6000|$|Cayke stared so {{hard that}} her eyes seemed about to pop out of her head. [...] "O-o-o-h!" [...] she exclaimed, drawing <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> delight.|$|E
6000|$|... "Easier than I {{thought it}} would be!" [...] exclaimed the freight agent, with <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> relief. [...] "I wish we were over all the way!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Shaggy Man, {{breaking}} the silence at last and drawing <b>a</b> long, <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> satisfaction, [...] "you {{are no longer}} the Ugly One, my dear brother; but, to be entirely frank with you, the face that belongs to you is no more handsome than it ought to be." ...|$|R
60|$|Far {{from looking}} bored or absent-minded, {{her eyes were}} {{concentrated}} almost sternly upon the page, and from her breathing, which was slow but repressed, it could be seen that her whole body was constrained by the working of her mind. At last she shut the book sharply, lay back, and drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> expressive <b>of</b> the wonder which always marks {{the transition from the}} imaginary world to the real world.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do love her!" [...] said Hollingsworth, uttering {{the words}} with <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> inward <b>breath,</b> instead <b>of</b> {{speaking}} them outright. [...] "As well declare it thus {{as in any}} other way. I do love her!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Linley drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> {{relief when}} he was left alone with his wife. [...] "What makes your mother so {{particularly}} disagreeable this morning?" [...] he inquired.|$|E
60|$|Stoutenburg drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> satisfaction: but anxiety {{seemed to}} have {{exhausted}} him, for now that his questions had been clearly answered, he sank into a chair.|$|E
60|$|She took <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> the sharp, invigorating air, {{then looked}} about her, and espying me in {{conversation}} with Giacopo she approached us across the gleaming snow.|$|E
60|$|She {{spoke as}} if it were an unamiable {{eccentricity}} on the part of the poachers, which they might be argued out of, if the matter were put before them in a reasonable manner. The Head agreed with her and rose to go. Jim watched him out of the room and then breathed <b>a</b> <b>deep,</b> satisfying <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> relief. His troubles were at an end.|$|R
60|$|They {{crossed the}} street, went through office and lobby, and then Duane asked MacNelly {{to take them}} to a private room. Without a word the Captain complied. When they were all inside Duane closed the door, and, drawing <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> as if <b>of</b> relief, he faced them calmly.|$|R
5|$|Chlorine is {{detectable}} with {{measuring devices}} in concentrations {{as low as}} 0.2 parts per million (ppm), and by smell at 3 ppm. Coughing and vomiting may occur at 30 ppm and lung damage at 60ppm. About 1000ppm can be fatal after <b>a</b> few <b>deep</b> <b>breaths</b> <b>of</b> the gas. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) concentration is 10 ppm. Breathing lower concentrations can aggravate the respiratory system and exposure to the gas can irritate the eyes. The toxicity of chlorine comes from its oxidizing power. When chlorine is inhaled at concentrations greater than 30ppm, it reacts with water and cellular fluid, producing hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hypochlorous acid (HClO).|$|R
60|$|It was a {{beautiful}} day in June and never had the country looked finer. As they swept along the well kept road Dick drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> satisfaction.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{something}} like," [...] remarked the eldest Rover, {{as he drew}} in <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> fresh air. [...] "Doesn't look like the storm of last night, eh, Sam?" ...|$|E
60|$|We all drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> relief; and Corporal John (as {{the most}} {{considerable}} junior present) {{explained to him}} it was intended for a public building, a kind of prefecture.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Hernshaw drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> as <b>of</b> relief. [...] "I will arrange {{about the}} blame," [...] she said loftily. [...] "And now I wish {{to tell you}} how I never {{supposed}} that girl was an interviewer. We were all together at an artist's house in Rome, and after dinner, we got to telling ghost-stories, the way people do, around the fire, and I told mine--yours I mean. And before we broke up, this girl came to me--it was while we were putting on our wraps--and introduced herself, and said how much she had been impressed by my story--of course, I mean your story--and she said she supposed it was made up. I said I should not dream of making up a thing of that kind, and that it was every word true, and I had heard the person it happened to tell it himself. I don't know! I was vain of having heard it, so, at first hand." ...|$|R
60|$|Again {{her head}} was up and her {{shoulders}} squared. Tying the hackamore about her waist, she took <b>a</b> single <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> reassurance and {{stepped out into the}} river. For a dozen paces she found no difficulty in following the ford. It was broad and straight; but {{toward the center of the}} river, as she felt her way along a step at a time, she came to a place where directly before her the ledge upon which she crossed shelved off into deep water. She turned upward, trying to locate the direction of the new turn; but here too there was no footing. Down river she felt solid rock beneath her feet. Ah! this was the way, and boldly she stepped out, the water already above her knees. Two, three steps she took, and with each one her confidence and hope arose, and then the fourth step--and there was no footing. She felt herself lunging into the stream, and tried to draw back and regain the ledge; but the force of the current was too much for her, and, so suddenly it seemed that she had thrown herself in, she was in the channel swimming for her life.|$|R
60|$|At {{first he}} is taken by surprise, never having dreamt {{of a state}} of {{existence}} where existence itself seems suspended. He shakes himself in his coat, to see whether it be empty or no. He closes his eyes, to test the reality of the glassy expanse. He fetches <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> by way <b>of</b> experiment, {{and for the sake of}} witnessing the effect. If a reader of books, Priestley on Necessity occurs to him; and he believes in that old Sir Anthony Absolute to the very last chapter. His faith in Malte Brun, however, begins to fail; for the geography, which from boyhood he had implicitly confided in, always assured him, that though expatiating all over the globe, the sea was at least margined by land. That over against America, for example, was Asia. But it is a calm, and he grows madly skeptical.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Brock {{pointed to}} the match-box. In another moment the {{confession}} was in flames. When the fire had consumed the last morsel of paper, Midwinter drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> relief.|$|E
60|$|Inglethorp {{was indeed}} {{creating}} a bad impression. His futile denials {{would not have}} convinced a child. The Coroner, however, passed briskly to the next point, and Poirot drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> relief.|$|E
60|$|There {{was a heavy}} step on the stairway, and Millicent shrank {{with the}} nausea of disgust as {{somebody}} tried the door. She drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> relief, when the steps passed on unevenly.|$|E
60|$|He {{kissed her}} again and hurried out of the office.... Boarding the train {{just as it was}} about to start, he settled himself {{in the back seat of}} the smoker, lit <b>a</b> cigar, inhaling <b>deep</b> <b>breaths</b> <b>of</b> the smoke and {{scarcely}} noticing an acquaintance who greeted him from the aisle. Well, he had done it! He was amazed. He had not intended to propose marriage, and when he tried to review the circumstances that had led to this he became confused. But when he asked himself whether indeed he were willing to pay such a price, to face the revolution marriage--and this marriage in particular--would mean in his life, the tumult in his blood beat down his incipient anxieties. Besides, he possessed the kind of mind able to throw off the consideration of possible consequences, and by the time the train had slowed down in the darkness of the North Station in Boston all traces of worry had disappeared. The future would take care of itself.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{apparently}} drawing immense {{conclusions from}} very small matters. Won't you perhaps feel, in fairness, that you're striking out, triumphing, or whatever I may call it, rather too easily--feel it when I perfectly admit that your smashed cup there does {{come back to}} me? I frankly confess, now, to the occasion, and to having wished {{not to speak of}} it to you at the time. We took two or three hours together, by arrangement; it WAS on the eve of my marriage--at the moment you say. But that put it on the eve of yours too, my dear--which was directly the point. It was desired to find for you, at the eleventh hour, some small wedding-present--a hunt, for something worth giving you, and yet possible from other points of view as well, in which it seemed I could be of use. You were naturally not to be told--precisely because it was all FOR you. We went forth together and we looked; we rummaged about and, as I remember we called it, we prowled; then it was that, as I freely recognise, we came across that crystal cup--which I'm bound to say, upon my honour, I think it rather a pity Fanny Assingham, from whatever good motive, should have treated so." [...] He had kept his hands in his pockets; he turned his eyes again, but more complacently now, to the ruins of the precious vessel; and Maggie could feel him exhale into the achieved quietness of his explanation <b>a</b> long, <b>deep</b> <b>breath</b> <b>of</b> comparative relief. Behind everything, beneath everything, it was somehow a comfort to him at last to be talking with her--and he seemed to be proving to himself that he COULD talk. [...] "It was at a little shop in Bloomsbury--I think I could go to the place now. The man understood Italian, I remember; he wanted awfully to work off his bowl. But I didn't believe in it, and we didn't take it." ...|$|R
60|$|He was vexed that a {{lingering}} doubt {{of the subject}} had kept him from bringing a canvas with him at once, and recording his precious first glimpses of it. But he meant {{to come to the}} trotting-match the next day again, and then he hoped to get back to his primal impression of the scene, now so vivid in his mind. He made his way down the benches, and out of the enclosure of the track. He drew <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> <b>breath,</b> full <b>of</b> the sweet smell of the bruised grass, forsaken now by nearly all the feet that had trodden it. A few old farmers, who had failed to get places along the railing and had not cared to pay for seats on the stand, were loitering about, followed by their baffled and disappointed wives. The men occasionally stopped at the cattle-pens, but it was less to look at the bulls and boars and rams which had taken the premiums, and wore cards or ribbons certifying the fact, than to escape a consciousness of their partners, harassingly taciturn or voluble in their reproach. A number of these embittered women brokenly fringed the piazza of the fair-house, and Ludlow made his way toward them with due sympathy for their poor little tragedy, so intelligible to him through the memories of his own country-bred youth. He followed with his pity those who sulked away through the deserted aisles of the building, and nursed their grievance among the prize fruits and vegetables, and the fruits and vegetables that had not taken the prizes. They were more censorious than they would have been perhaps if they had not been defeated themselves; he heard them dispute the wisdom of most of the awards as the shoutings and clappings from the racetrack penetrated the lonely hall. They creaked wearily up and down in their new shoes or best shoes, and he knew how they wished themselves at home and in bed, and wondered why they had ever been such fools as to come, anyway. Occasionally, one of their husbands lagged in, as if in search of his wife, but kept at a safe distance, after seeing her, or hung about with a group of other husbands, who could not be put to shame or suffering as they might if they had appeared singly.|$|R
