5|$|Nauru has no armed forces, {{though there}} is a small police force under {{civilian}} control. Australia is responsible for Nauru's defence under an informal agreement between the two countries. The September 2005 Memorandum of Understanding between Australia and Nauru provides the latter with financial aid <b>and</b> <b>technical</b> <b>assistance,</b> including a Secretary of Finance to prepare the budget, and advisers on health and education. This aid is in return for Nauru's housing of asylum seekers while their applications for entry into Australia are processed. Nauru uses the Australian dollar as its official currency.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the heavy}} {{damage from the}} cyclone and other recent disasters, the World Bank enacted a plan for Andhra Pradesh in April 1997, {{consisting}} of repairing damaged infrastructure, an updated disaster plan, <b>and</b> <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> to the state government. Shelters and roads would be improved to higher standards. This plan ultimately cost about US$175million and was completed in July 2003, three years longer than expected but {{at a lower cost}} due to the Indian rupee losing some of its value. Power lines were improved to withstand winds of , while drains were enlarged and a coastal plant system was created to lessen flooding. An additional 82public shelters were constructed. However, the plan failed to yield a long term disaster policy for the state.|$|E
5|$|Atwood was {{scheduled}} to release her new novel in fall 2008 and deliver the Massey Lectures in fall 2009. At the insistence of Atwood's American editor at Doubleday, her Canadian and British editors and agents agreed in January 2008 to postpone the release of her novel by one year to avoid competing with the US Presidential election for attention. The people organizing the Massey Lectures, Sarah McLachlan of House of Anansi Press, John Fraser of Massey College, and Bernie Lucht of CBC's Ideas, discovered this rescheduling via a newspaper article. They asked Atwood to deliver her lectures in fall 2008, meaning the text would be due in June. She agreed on condition of Massey College providing research <b>and</b> <b>technical</b> <b>assistance.</b> The text was written between late January and June 2008, during which Atwood took time for two vacations (birding in Cuba and in France). The original title was to be Debt but Scott Griffin, owner of House of Anansi Press, convinced Atwood to change it to something less depressing.|$|E

5|$|The Maryland Geological Survey {{was formed}} in 1896 to study the state's natural resources. Within two years, the agency {{determined}} that road building was an area that required extensive study and promotion, so the agency requested and received authorization from the Maryland General Assembly to create a Highway Division to study the state of highways in Maryland and propose engineering and legislative solutions to the state's transportation problems. One of those solutions passed by the General Assembly was the 1904 State Aid Highway Law, {{also known as the}} Shoemaker Law, which offered the counties and municipalities expert advice <b>and</b> <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> from the Maryland Geological Survey and funding for one half of the cost of macadam roads constructed by the county. The first improved highways along what became US113 in Worcester County were constructed under the provisions of the 1904 law. Worcester County constructed three mile-long macadam roads that became US113 with state aid: from the south town limit of Berlin to Hayes Landing Road in 1907, from the east town limit of Snow Hill to Purnells Mill Pond in 1907 and 1908, and from the north town limit of Berlin toward Showell in 1909 and 1910.|$|E
5|$|Malaysia {{established}} {{diplomatic ties}} with North Vietnam on 31 March 1973 at the ambassadorial level after the Paris Peace Accords were signed that year. An {{agreement between the}} ambassadors of Malaysia and Vietnam was reached in 1975. The following year, Malaysia first opened its embassy in Hanoi, while Vietnam also opened its embassy in Kuala Lumpur on 29 May 1976. In {{the mid to late}} 1970s, bilateral ties were strained as Malaysia pressured Vietnam to embrace the ZOPFAN concept, which the latter interpreted as a version of the anti-communist containment policy. During a bilateral summit in August 1977, Malaysia's Prime Minister Hussein Onn made promises to provide economic <b>and</b> <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> to rebuild Vietnam's war-torn economy. When Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1979, many Vietnamese sought refuge in Malaysia from that time onwards and into the 1980s, and caused economic and national security problems to Malaysia especially to its racial balance as most the Vietnamese refugees resemble the Chinese people. Bilateral ties normalised from 1988 onwards, when Vietnam announced plans to withdraw from Cambodia. In the early 1990s, government leaders of both countries held several diplomatic visits and summits, which produced many agreements that emphasised economic co-operation and development. Strengthening ties also saw the opening of a consulate office in Ho Chi Minh City in January 1991. Vietnam expressed its interest in joining ASEAN with Malaysia's support in 1994 as the countries continued to foster close economic ties. Vietnam joined ASEAN in 1995; its entry was warmly welcomed by Malaysia.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} component of the Bretton Woods agreements was the creation of two new international financial institutions, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). Collectively referred to as the Bretton Woods institutions, they became operational in 1947 and 1946 respectively. The IMF was established to support the monetary system by facilitating cooperation on international monetary issues, providing advisory <b>and</b> <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> to members, and offering emergency lending to nations experiencing repeated difficulties restoring the balance of payments equilibrium. Members would contribute funds to a pool according to their share of gross world product, from which emergency loans could be issued. Member states were authorized and encouraged to employ capital controls as necessary to manage payments imbalances and meet pegging targets, but prohibited from relying on IMF financing to cover particularly short-term capital hemorrhages. While the IMF was instituted to guide members and provide a short-term financing window for recurrent balance of payments deficits, the IBRD was established to serve as a type of financial intermediary for channeling global capital toward long-term investment opportunities and postwar reconstruction projects. The creation of these organizations was a crucial milestone {{in the evolution of the}} international financial architecture, and some economists consider it the most significant achievement of multilateral cooperation following World War II. Since the establishment of the International Development Association (IDA) in 1960, the IBRD and IDA are together known as the World Bank. While the IBRD lends to middle-income developing countries, the IDA extends the Bank's lending program by offering concessional loans and grants to the world's poorest nations.|$|E

5|$|Rise of Mana was {{the brainchild}} of Square Enix {{producer}} Masaru Oyamada, who had {{made a name for himself}} within the company working in its mobile division on mobile ports of Final Fantasy Adventure and Secret of Mana. Speaking with series producer Koichi Ishii, Oyamada said that he could create an original mobile title that would be a legitimate entry in the series. Instead of a social or card-based game, which were the most prevalent genres in mobile gaming at the time, Oyamada wanted to create an action role-playing game that was accessible to a large number of casual gamers, something which would worry him throughout its production. The main staff were made up of Oyamada, director Masato Yagi, and art director Hiroyuki Suzuki. Hiroyuki had previously only worked on the Final Fantasy series. After the initial release of Rise of Mana, Yagi was responsible for the main scenario alongside Oyamada and post-launch content producer Naofumi Takuma. Oyamada also initially tried to bring Chaos Rings producer Takehiro Ando on board, but Ando would have nothing to do with the project. Development began in July 2012. The game was constructed using the Unity engine. In addition to staff from Square Enix, main development was done by Japanese developer Goshow, and its server security <b>and</b> <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> was handled by Fixer. The protagonists and some NPCs were designed by Japanese artist Taiki, while another artist Ryota Murayama handled NPC and monster designs. The game's key art was created by in-house designer Dairaku Masahiko: he was brought in after regular Mana key art illustrator Hiroo Isono died in 2013. Masahiko was asked by Oyamada to create something similar to Isono's previous artwork in creating a representation of pointillism. The game's title was indicative of the title's nature as a new entry in the Mana series; other than a small card-battle mobile game in 2013, Circle of Mana, Rise was the first Mana title since Heroes of Mana in 2007.|$|E
