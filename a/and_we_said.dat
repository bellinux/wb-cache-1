500|$|Vedder {{found the}} medical book at a garage sale. Ament stated, [...] "Ed brought in that book, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>said</b> man {{that would make}} a great album cover." [...] He {{explained}} that from Vs. onwards the band tried to take different approaches to packaging its records. Ament said, [...] "We tried really hard, to make it like a book, kind of tipped it so it opened horizontally, which pissed off record stores: they had to put it in sideways." [...] The packaging cost an extra 50 cents per copy. Problems arose when the band discovered that later versions of the book were still under copyright. The band had to confer with their lawyers in order to work out a final version utilizing the material they wanted to include with the album.|$|E

So we're like saying to them, 'Right, you write the fucking hit song and we'll record it.' That shut the guy up and that was the last time we had any kind of meetings like that!" ...|$|E
500|$|Although Joseph Jackson {{initially}} {{demanded that}} his daughter's new album be recorded in Los Angeles {{so that he}} could keep an eye on her, Jam and Lewis refused. They required the entire production of the album to be done at their own studio in Minneapolis, Minnesota, [...] "far from the glitter and distractions of Hollywood and the interference of manager-fathers." [...] Control was recorded at Flyte Tyme Studios, the site for Flyte Tyme Records, founded by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis in Minneapolis. Jackson recorded the whole album, but A label executive and manager John McClain wanted one more uptempo song to compose the album. She then went back to Minneapolis to record one more track, titled [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately", which was originally penned for one of Jam and Lewis's own records. Jam remembered, [...] "She was sitting outside in the lounge and said, 'Man, that's a funky track. Who's that for?' <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>said,</b> 'It's for you', and she said, 'Oh, cool'. I think she was very pleased when she heard the track".|$|E
500|$|Cleveland's {{next game}} {{was against the}} Yankees, who had {{the best record in}} the AAFC's eastern {{division}} and were a likely opponent in the championship game. New York took an early lead as Spec Sanders scored two rushing touchdowns in the first quarter and added a third in the second. Sanders, called [...] "Spectacular Spec" [...] by New York sportswriters, was having a career season. By the end of the year, he had compiled 1,432 rushing yards and 1,442 passing yards; his 18 touchdowns set a professional football record that was not surpassed until the 1960s. After Sanders' three touchdowns, New York's Buddy Young added a fourth in the second quarter, widening the Yankees' lead to 28–0. Cleveland's Bill Boedeker scored a touchdown on a pass from Graham at the end of the period, but the game appeared out of reach for Cleveland at the half. The Browns, however, came back in the second half. Motley rushed for two touchdowns in the third quarter and Jim Dewar ran for a score in the fourth. The game ended in a tie. At halftime, Yankees players had hurled insults at the Browns. [...] "They got us upset, got us angry," [...] Graham later said. [...] "Finally we got mad as a team <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>said,</b> 'We'll show these guys,' and we started playing football." [...] More than 70,000 fans came to watch the game, a record for a New York pro football game that stood until 1958. Attendance was boosted by the presence of about 25,000 black fans who came in part to watch the four black players in the game: Buddy Young of the Yankees and Motley, Bill Willis and Horace Gillom of the Browns. Groza was injured during the game and was not able to play.|$|E

500|$|The session, {{held the}} evening of July 5, 1954, proved entirely unfruitful {{until late in the}} night. As they were about to give up and go home, Presley took his guitar and {{launched}} into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup's [...] "That's All Right". Moore recalled, [...] "All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them. Sam, I think, had the door to the control booth open... he stuck his head out and said, 'What are you doing?' <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>said,</b> 'We don't know.' 'Well, back up,' he said, 'try {{to find a place to}} start, and do it again.'" [...] Phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound he had been looking for. Three days later, popular Memphis DJ Dewey Phillips played [...] "That's All Right" [...] on his WHBQ Red, Hot, and Blue show. Listeners began phoning in, eager to find out who the singer was. The interest was such that Phillips played the record repeatedly during the last two hours of his show. Interviewing Presley on-air, Phillips asked him what high school he attended in order to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed he was black. During the next few days, the trio recorded a bluegrass number, Bill Monroe's [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky", again in a distinctive style and employing an audio delay echo effect that Sam Phillips dubbed [...] "slapback". A single was pressed with [...] "That's All Right" [...] on the A side and [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky" [...] on the reverse.|$|E

It's not ‘Python’ as we would have written it. But then, {{none of us would}} get {{together}} and write a ‘Python’ stage show. Eric eventually ran out of patience and said, ‘Well, I’ll do it myself then.’ He sent us bits and songs and all that <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>said,</b> ‘Yeah, that's all right, have a go.’ But its success is so enormous that it took us all by surprise, including Eric, and now we’re just proud to be associated with it, rather pathetically." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sire Records made an {{unauthorised}} {{music video}} {{to promote the}} song. It intercut clips of the band playing live (including a shot of Johnny Marr showing Morrissey {{how to play the}} guitar), an industrial part of a city, and a girl dancing. The band were not pleased by the result. Morrissey told Creem in 1985, [...] "We saw the video <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>said</b> to Sire, 'You can't possibly release this... this degrading video.' And they said, 'Well, maybe you shouldn't really be on our label.' It was quite disastrous". Nonetheless, the video has been credited with helping make the song their most famous in the United States, along with heavy exposure on college radio.|$|E

Flames were within a foot of his face; another passenger got the emergency exit open and pulled him out. The five passengers who died were all sitting near him, he claimed. Jamie Wallace, in the second car, said that passengers there initially tried to {{come to the aid of}} those in the front car, but [...] "we could not get the head car doors open for some reason, it was jammed." [...] After failed efforts to break the door open, [...] " [...] number of us started smelling fumes from the car, the fuel, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>said,</b> 'You know what, we need to get out.'" ...|$|E

Tip would always refer to me as 'the Martian', and in one of his lyrics, he said, 'It's the man and the Martian,' <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>said,</b> 'Man that could be an album title.' We kinda just played around with it. But it seems to be taking form in a very organic way."

2500|$|In a 1994 {{interview}} for The Beatles Anthology, however, McCartney disagreed with Lennon's recollections, basically stating {{that it was}} the Beatles, and not Lester, who had come {{up with the idea of}} using Starr's verbal misstep: [...] "The title was Ringo's.

2500|$|The {{developers}} and the corporation {{did not allow}} the architects a free hand. The developers demanded a closed building with little natural light and rejected a more open, roof-lit, design. The corporation insisted on a bus station, market, car parking, an underground railway station, and provision for deck access to subsequent developments. Cannon Street was to be kept open with no shop frontages. Corporation Street and High Street were allowed shop fronts on the returns to Market Street. Market Street, a busy thoroughfare, had shop fronts as pedestrianisation was proposed, though this did not happen until 1981. The architects, developers, and city council did not communicate well. Display windows were forbidden {{on most of the}} external walls of the centre and were inside the centre. The architects realised that [...] "the brief [...] given... would produce a very introverted building. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>said</b> this would not be attractive".|$|E
2500|$|... "We went {{up there}} on a windy day, and it was {{freezing}} cold. Every time we opened a plan it blew away. <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>said</b> Christ! What {{are we going to}} do with these students, where are they going to sit in the sun and all that? Well, we decided, it's got to be cloisters. All of the buildings have got to touch at the ground. We then devised this system and it had an absolutely firm principle: it had a great spine down the middle where everybody walked. That led everywhere. The cars were on the outside, on both sides. When you came into the spaces things were square, they were rectangular courtyards and they were all slightly different. There were two or three essentials: one was that the covered way had to be continuous, the buildings had to be three or four storeys high and connecting to the next one. I thought it worked very well." ...|$|E
2500|$|The set Lam is {{most proud}} of {{is one of the}} Fallen’s {{underground}} lairs. To dress this set, Lam and his team hung fences, fake blood and plastic chains painted to look metallic around an abandoned shooting stage in Gore Hill. Lam says, [...] "The lead actor just came up and went, ‘Wow, that's really cool!' <b>And</b> <b>we</b> <b>said,</b> ‘Yeah! And it cost us nothing!’" [...] Shane Abbess instructed the art department to include lots of fake blood and gore; Lam describes this as [...] "video game influence." [...] He also acknowledges that his work has a strong comic book influence. Some of the art department work didn’t make it into the final film. Lam and his team built a large sculpture made of hessian and chicken wire, and though [...] "it looked really good" [...] and fitted [...] "really well with the whole theme of Gabriel," [...] it wasn’t used in the film.|$|E
60|$|For--that we may go back again, to that great-souled man, of whom I spoke just now--did we {{not leave}} out {{one thing in}} his {{character}}? or at least, one thing by which his character might be proved <b>and</b> tried? <b>We</b> <b>said</b> {{that he should be}} generous <b>and</b> forgiving; <b>we</b> <b>said</b> that he should bear patiently folly, peevishness, ingratitude: but what if we asked of him, that he should sacrifice himself utterly for the peevish, ungrateful men for whose good he was toiling? What if we asked him to give up, for them, not only all which made life worth having, but to give up life itself? To die for them; and, what is bitterest of all, to die by their hands--to receive as their reward for all his goodness to them a shameful death? If he dare submit to that, then we should call his greatness of soul perfect. Magnanimity, we should say, could rise no higher; in that would be the perfection of goodness.|$|R

2500|$|Hepburn had {{her first}} {{starring}} role in Roman Holiday (1953), playing Princess Ann, a European princess who, while escaping the reins of royalty, {{falls in love with}} an American newsman (Gregory Peck). Its producers initially wanted Elizabeth Taylor for the role, but director William Wyler was so impressed by Hepburn's screen test that he cast her instead. Wyler later commented, [...] "She had everything I was looking for: charm, innocence, and talent. She also was very funny. She was absolutely enchanting <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>said,</b> 'That's the girl! Originally, the film was to have had only Gregory Peck's name above its title, with [...] "Introducing Audrey Hepburn" [...] beneath in smaller font. However, Peck suggested to Wyler that he elevate her to equal billing so that her name appeared before the title and in type as large as his: [...] "You've got to change that because she'll be a big star and I'll look like a big jerk." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Tawfik Hamid, {{chair for}} the Study of Islamic Radicalism at the Potomac Institute for Policy Studies, an Egyptian scholar and {{self-described}} {{former member of}} the militant al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya, said that most Muslims correlate the word Israel in Arabic to the word 'Azra'il that sounds like Israel but means [...] "Angel of death". This created a link in the minds of most children of Muslims the need to hate the word Israel. In an article titled [...] "Why I loved Israel based on the Qur'an" [...] he claims that according to the Qur'an, God gave the Israelites the land of Israel as their promised land (Quran 17:104): <b>And</b> <b>We</b> <b>said</b> thereafter to the Children of Israel, [...] "Dwell securely in the land of promise". He explains the Quran went even further to consider the Promised Land as the permanent inheritance for the Israelites (26:59): [...] "Thus it was, but we made the Children of Israel inheritors of such things (the Promised Land)" [...] He continued by saying [...] "No Muslim has the right to interfere with the gathering of the Jews in Israel, as this is the will of God himself".|$|E
