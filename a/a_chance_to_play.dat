5|$|Many young enforcers need to {{establish}} their role early in their career to avoid losing their jobs. Due to the farm systems that most professional hockey leagues use, enforcers who get <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> at the level above their current one (for example, an AHL player getting <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in an NHL game) need to show other players, coaches, and fans that they are worthy of the enforcer role on the team.

He’s noted on several occasions that he’s taken the strategies of the major sports brands, i.e. NASCAR, the NBA, and the NFL, and extracted the best practices to grow the WSOP.

Fans have the hope of their favorite team trading for the right player, drafting the right player, winning a game, winning the season, winning the world championship.” And furthermore that, “he World Series of Poker offers a brand of hope that is infinitely more accessible” insofar as anyone can enter the tournament and have <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> at the final table.|$|E

5|$|The {{conflict}} between Paul Brown and Modell reached a breaking point when Brown traded star halfback Bobby Mitchell {{for the rights}} to Ernie Davis, a Heisman Trophy-winning running back who broke all of Jim Brown's rushing records at Syracuse. Paul Brown did not inform Modell of the move, and Modell only heard about it after getting a call from Washington Redskins owner George Preston Marshall. Davis, however, was diagnosed with leukemia before the 1962 season. He came to Cleveland to train after the cancer went into remission, but Brown would not allow him to play. Modell, however, wanted to give Davis <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> before he succumbed to the disease. Ultimately, the relationship between coach and owner was never repaired, and Ernie Davis never played in a professional game, dying on May 18, 1963.|$|E

5|$|Evolve was {{developed}} by Turtle Rock Studios. Evolves creative director, Phil Robb, and lead designer, Chris Ashton, are the co-founders of Turtle Rock Studios alongside Michael Booth. The team had a heritage of developing competitive multiplayer games, such as Valve Corporation's Counter-Strike series and the Left 4 Dead series. According to Robb, the team {{wanted to build a}} co-operative, multiplayer game because it gave the team <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> with their family and friends together, instead of against each other, and found it offered a more enjoyable experience than competitive multiplayer games. The concept for Evolve was completed in 2005, before the development of the first Left 4 Dead game. However, the Evolve project was put on hold, as Turtle Rock thought that the technology at that time was not advanced enough to handle the game's design.|$|E

On July 30, Leblanc signed a three-year {{contract}} with the Canadiens, and he attended a training camp with the team in September. By signing a professional contract, he forfeited his National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) eligibility and had to leave Harvard, being considered a professional according to NCAA standards.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, Mitchell joined a {{community}} theater group in Ellsworth, Maine, the Ellsworth Players; he eventually became its president. He was purely a behind-the-scenes {{participant in the}} group's stage productions until 1971, when director Bill Raiten persuaded {{him to take the}} role of Tevye in a production of the musical Fiddler on the Roof.

Mitchell, as the father of four children, felt committed to his financial career and declined the offer.

5|$|The {{first round}} is an {{elimination}} {{game in which}} the eight cats are {{placed in front of}} a bowl of cat food. The three cats which have eaten the most food when time expires move on to the second round; those who are eliminated earn $1,000. The three remaining owners answer trivia questions for points. The format is similar to Jeopardy! with six cat-related CATegories containing questions ranging from 10 to 50 points. The lowest-scoring owner is eliminated with $10,000. The two remaining cats are each then recorded in seven different situations. The owners wager points on what their cat will do before each clip is shown. They may not wager more than half of their points on the first two questions. For the remainder, they may wager any or all of their points. The cat and owner with the highest score win $25,000, and <b>a</b> <b>chance</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> the bonus round; the eliminated contestant earns $15,000.|$|E
