5|$|A non-tropical trough at {{the surface}} {{extended}} from the northern Gulf of Mexico across Florida into the western Atlantic Ocean. On August 3, the western portion developed into a low pressure area. The eastern portion slowly organized and ultimately developed into Tropical Storm Cristobal. The low pressure area in the Gulf of Mexico steadily organized, and late on August 4 the circulation was organized enough for the National Hurricane Center to classify it as Tropical Depression Two while located 40miles (65km) east of Port Eads, Louisiana. Northeasterly wind shear initially prevented organization of the cloud pattern, though the depression was able to strengthen to become Tropical Storm Bertha <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>hours</b> after it formed.|$|E

The North Korean column was completely destroyed. US patrols after daylight estimated the North Koreans had suffered 1,300 casualties in the fight. Eleven prisoners captured by the patrol said the action had decimated their units and that the division was only at 25 percent strength.|$|E

I was in the water <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>hours,</b> as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F.

5|$|On July10, a {{tropical}} wave exited the African coast and moved westward over the open Atlantic for several days. Initially, the associated weather activity {{was limited to}} weak showers, and environmental conditions were not forecast to become conducive for significant organization. Although upper-level wind shear remained somewhat adverse, a process of slow development became evident by July19 as surface pressures began to fall. The wave proceeded along the extreme northeastern Caribbean, where convective activity waxed and waned due to periods of variable wind shear and brief land interaction with Hispaniola. By July22, thundershower activity reestablished over the Bahamas, with a distinct {{area of low pressure}} centered between the islands of Acklins and Great Inagua. Satellite observations confirmed a closed circulation, leading the National Hurricane Center (NHC) to issue the formation of Tropical Depression Three around 1500UTC. However, post-storm analysis indicated that a depression had developed nine hours earlier than operationally confirmed. Upon its formation, the depression was forecast to be steered to the west-northwest along a well-established subtropical ridge. Later that day, minimum pressure dropped to 1006mbar (29.74inHg), and satellite imagery showed an establishment of favorable outflow in nearly all quadrants. Although its cloud pattern remained disorganizedwith the circulation center disassociated from the deepest convectiona reconnaissance aircraft flight into the cyclone found that the winds had increased. It was therefore upgraded to Tropical Storm Bonnie southeast of Nassau, Bahamas, <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>hours</b> after NHC initiated advisories on the system.|$|E
5|$|The {{tropical}} depression {{traveled to the}} northwest across the southwest Gulf of Mexico. It strengthened rapidly, and there was evidence of deep convection as it passed over warm waters. It was upgraded to Tropical Storm Beryl late on August 14 with surface winds of 50mph (85km/h), based on reconnaissance aircraft observation. Six hours later, the storm accelerated to near 9mph (15km/h), meaning that landfall would happen sooner than expected, preventing the time for Beryl to strengthen to a hurricane. However, Beryl failed to undergo significant intensification as was forecast, as it maintained an intensity of 50mph (85km/h). The lack of intensification {{could be due to}} moderate wind shear and entrainment over the Gulf of Mexico. Tropical Storm Beryl continued to track to the northwest toward the Rio Grande Valley area in the southern portion of the U.S. state of Texas. The storm made landfall early on August 15 along the Mexican coast about 105mi (165km) south of Brownsville, Texas, 35mi (55km) north La Pesca, Tamaulipas and about 115mi (185km) north of Tampico. Beryl was downgraded to a {{tropical depression}} <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>hours</b> after landfall. The Brownsville radar showed that the circulation center of the storm became elongated parallel to the mountain ranges of northeastern Mexico, so the system was no longer declared a tropical depression late on August 15, while located near Monterrey.|$|E

25|$|Although GOES-3 {{ceased to}} be used for weather {{operations}} in 1989, it spent over 20 years as a critical part of communications between the U.S. and Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station before being decommissioned in 2016. Geostationary satellites expend fuel to keep themselves stationary over the equator, and thus cannot normally ordinarily be seen from the poles. When that fuel is depleted, solar and lunar perturbations increase the satellite's inclination so that its ground track begins to describe an analemma (a figure-8 in the north-south direction). This usually ends the satellite's primary mission. However, when the inclination is high enough the satellite may begin to rise above the polar horizons at the extremes of the figure-8, as was the case for GOES-3. A nine-meter dish was constructed at the station, and communication with the satellite could be obtained for <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>hours</b> per day. Data rates were around 2.048 megabytes/second (bi-directional) under optimum conditions.|$|E

Also, Kyle MacLachlan returned reluctantly as he wanted to avoid typecasting, so his presence in the film is smaller than originally planned. Lynch originally shot <b>about</b> <b>five</b> <b>hours</b> of footage that was subsequently cut down to two hours and fourteen minutes.
