5|$|Belgrano's {{departure}} enraged the crowd, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{not explain}} what had happened, {{and the people}} feared a betrayal. Demands for Cisneros' immediate resignation replaced those for an open cabildo. The people finally settled down and dispersed when Saavedra intervened {{to say that the}} claims of the Infernal Legion were supported by the military.|$|E
5|$|Eyre {{is thought}} to have been passing through the Toolinna Cove sand patch at the time of writing. B.epica and B.media are the only Banksia species that occur at that location, and both have a form and habit that accords with Eyre's description. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not collect specimens, it is {{impossible}} to determine what species he saw.|$|E
5|$|Feynman tried LSD {{during his}} {{professorship}} at Caltech. He also tried marijuana and ketamine experiences at John Lilly's famed sensory deprivation tanks, {{as a way}} of studying consciousness. He gave up alcohol when he began to show vague, early signs of alcoholism, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not want to do anything that could damage his brain.|$|E

5|$|Ladas {{was kept}} in {{training}} as a four-year-old for the 1895 season. Rosebery issued a challenge to Isinglass's owner, Harry McCalmont, for a match race between Ladas and Isinglass to take place at Newmarket in May. McCalmont declined <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not want to disrupt his horse's preparation for the Ascot Gold Cup.|$|E
5|$|The decree of the Congregation of the Index banned Copernicus's De Revolutionibus {{and other}} heliocentric works until correction. Bellarmine's {{instructions}} did not prohibit Galileo from discussing heliocentrism as a mathematical and philosophic idea, so long <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not advocate for its physical truth.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} {{his college}} degree in 1989, Sheridan {{returned to his}} home. He held various jobs, including substitute teaching, bartending, and working in his father's variety store. Sheridan eventually decided that {{if he wanted to}} establish a career, he had to relocate, so he moved to California in 1992. Sheridan stayed at a friend's house, and <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not own a cell phone, he used a payphone located on Sunset Boulevard to call interested employers.|$|E

5|$|After several {{conflicts}} with the school's administration, Leontovych got a new job as a teacher of church music and calligraphy at the Theological College in Tyvriv. Besides working with the college choir, Leontovych organized an amateur orchestra that often performed at college events. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> earlier with choirs, Leontovych included arrangements of folk songs among the usual religious works sung in theological schools. These included arrangements by Mykola Lysenko, his own choral arrangements of folk songs, and entirely original works. One such work {{was based on a}} poem by Taras Shevchenko titled “Зоре моя вечірняя” (Oh my evening star).|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Third Reich, Hess was {{nominated}} to serve again as a judge in Düsseldorf but declined, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not wish to work alongside former colleagues who {{had been part of the}} Nazi judicial system. He started a new career in the railways in 1946, and from 1949–55 served as President of the German Federal Railways Authority in Frankfurt am Main. He was awarded a Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany and was given a plaque of honour by the city of Frankfurt in 1970. He died there on 14 September 1983.|$|E
5|$|After {{the show}} was {{cancelled}} and Sheridan became unemployed, he began writing for the animated television series Family Guy. Although initially skeptical, he accepted the job <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not have other options. Sheridan {{was one of the}} first writers hired, and has continued to write for the show through its eleventh season. For his work on Family Guy, he has been nominated for five Primetime Emmy Awards, a British Academy Television Award, and has won a DVD Exclusive Award. Sheridan has also written episodes of Titus and Yes, Dear. He is divorced and has one daughter.|$|E

5|$|Alfre Woodard {{was cast}} as Lily Sloane, Cochrane's assistant. When Frakes {{first moved to}} Los Angeles, Woodard {{was one of the}} first people he met. During a {{conversation}} at a barbecue, Woodard said she would become Frakes' godmother, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not have one. Through this relationship, Frakes was able to cast Woodard in the film; he considered it a coup to land an Academy Award-nominated actress. Woodard considered Lily to be the character most like herself out of all the roles she has played.|$|E
5|$|Although Leng {{credits the}} song's two {{acoustic}} guitar parts to Harrison alone, Spizer suggests that guitarist Peter Frampton may have supplied {{one of these}} parts. Playing the bass, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> on most of All Things Must Pass, was Klaus Voormann, who would be another to find sanctuary at Friar Park. Harrison offered him refuge from the media in March and April 1971, when reports had Voormann linked to a supposed Beatles offshoot band, along with Harrison, Starr and John Lennon.|$|E
5|$|Another Green World was {{recorded}} at Island Studios in London {{during the months}} of July and August 1975. Brian Eno originally viewed his new album as an experiment and entered the recording studio with nothing written or prepared beforehand. For the first four days in the studio, Eno failed to be productive. To look for new ideas, Eno turned to his instructional cards, the Oblique Strategies, and began coming up with new ideas <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> with his previous album Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy).|$|E

5|$|As per Khalid's suggestion, Abu Ubaidah {{ordered all}} the Muslim armies in Syria to {{evacuate}} the conquered land and concentrate at Jabiya. This maneuver gave a decisive blow to Heraclius' plan, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not wish to engage his troops in an open battle with the Muslims, where the Muslim light cavalry could be effectively used against the heavy and less mobile Byzantine cavalry.|$|E
5|$|Benchley's return yielded {{two more}} short films, and his {{high-profile}} prompted negotiations for sponsorship of a Benchley radio program and numerous appearances on television shows, {{including the first}} television entertainment program ever broadcast, an untitled test program using an experimental antenna on the Empire State Building. The radio program, Melody and Madness, was more a showcase for Benchley's acting, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not participate in writing it. It was not well received, and {{was removed from the}} schedule.|$|E
5|$|Castro was {{initially}} {{disappointed with the}} project <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not want to solely imitate José's vocals, Ferrer's absence and his desire to record Jose's lesser known songs. According to Castro, it was {{the decisions of the}} executive producers of his record label, Universal Music Latino, to only have Botija produce the album and to record José José's more recognized songs. He later retracted his statement, commending Botija and referred to the disc as his best, only lamenting he could not record José's lesser known songs. José expressed satisfaction with the result.|$|E

5|$|Edward William Bastard {{was born}} in Wilton, a parish just outside Taunton, the second son of Henry Horlock Bastard. He was educated at Sherborne School, and played for the school cricket team. Although he was later known as a bowler, Bastard {{occasionally}} opened the batting for the school, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> against Clifton College in 1881. During his time at Sherborne, he also played some games for Dorset.|$|E
5|$|Executive {{producer}} and co-writer George Lucas {{decided to make}} the film a prequel <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not want the Nazis to be the villains again. After three rejected plot devices, Lucas wrote a film treatment that resembled the film's final storyline. Lawrence Kasdan, Lucas's collaborator on Raiders of the Lost Ark, turned down the offer to write the script, and Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz were hired as his replacements, with the screenplay partly based upon the 1939 film Gunga Din.|$|E
5|$|Hans Bethe {{once said}} that Klaus Fuchs was the only {{physicist}} he knew who truly changed history. Because {{the head of the}} Soviet project, Lavrenti Beria, used foreign intelligence as a third-party check, rather than giving it directly to the scientists, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not trust the information by default, it is unknown whether Fuchs's fission information had a substantial effect. Considering that the pace of the Soviet program was set primarily by the amount of uranium they could procure, it is hard for scholars to accurately judge how much time this saved.|$|E
