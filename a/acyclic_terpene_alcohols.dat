40|$|For {{the first}} time it has been {{demonstrated}} that simple derivates of <b>acyclic</b> <b>terpene</b> <b>alcohols</b> are capable of cascade cyclizations via cationradical intermediates. The reactions proceed with high regio- and stereoselectivity, and the stereochemistry of the reaction products is similar to the stereochemistry of products from the corresponding biomimetic acid catalyzed cyclization of terminally epoxidized terpene alcohols. Generation of the cationradicals take place by photoinduced electron transfer to suitable acceptors, and the transfer efficiency is increased by cosensibilizators acting as primary donors. The reaction behaviour of the isoprenoid donors strongly depends on the solvent system.

40|$|The {{selective}} {{conversion of}} alcohols to their carbonyl derivatives {{is a critical}} step towards a sustainable chemical industry. Heterogeneous Pd catalysts represent {{some of the most}} active systems known, even so further studies into the active species and role of support are required. Through controlling support mesostructure, using non-interconnected SBA- 15 and interlinked SBA- 16 and KIT- 6, we have evaluated the role of pore architecture on supported Pd nanoparticles and their subsequent activity for liquid phase aerobic allylic alcohol selective oxidation. [1, 2] These synthesised silica supports exhibit high surface areas (> 800 m 2 g- 1), and similar mesopore diameters (3. 5 to 5 nm), but differ in their pore connectivity and arrangement; p 6 mm (SBA- 15), I 3 mm (SBA- 16) and I 3 ad (KIT- 6). When evaluated alongside commercial non-mesoporous silica (200 m 2 g- 1) they promote enhanced Pd dispersion with interpenetrating assemblies providing further elevation. Macropore introduction into SBA- 15, producing a hierarchical macro-mesoporous silica (MM-SBA- 15), allows control over mesopore length and accessibility which escalates Pd distribution to levels akin to KIT- 6 and SBA- 16. Controlling dispersion, and likewise nanoparticle size, is thus facilitated through the choice of support and additionally Pd loading, with cluster sizes spanning 3. 2 to 0. 8 nm. X-ray spectroscopies indicate nanoparticles are PdO terminated with the oxide content a function of dispersion. Kinetic studies allude to surface PdO being the active site responsible, with a constant TOF observed, independent of loading and support. This confirms activity is governed by PdO density, whilst also overruling internal mass diffusion constraints. MM-SBA- 15 facilitates superior activity and TOFs for long chain <b>acyclic</b> <b>terpene</b> <b>alcohols</b> due to reduced internal mass transport constraints...|$|E

The main constituents of the turpentine, a-pinene, b-pineneand limonene, were subjected to a P. abies suspension culture. Allylic oxidation formed the major products for α-pineneand β-pinene, which were further oxidised to theirrespective aldehyde or ketone. One of the minor products froma-pinene, cis-verbenol, was not only transformed into verbenonebut also isomerised to trans-verbenol. Limonene gavelimonene-(1, 2) -epoxide as the major product. Fractionation of monoterpenes is accomplished throughphysical separation methods, chromatography and distillation,and lipase-catalysed transesterification of vinyl acetate withterpene alcohols.

In {{the process of the}} syntheses of the three 1 -aryl- 5 -allyloxytetrazoles, their rapid isomerization to the corresponding 1 -aryl- 4 -allyltetrazol- 5 -ones occurred. The experiments showed that the imidates rearrange exclusively through a [3, 3 ¢]-sigmatropic migration of the allylic system from O to N, with inversion. Mechanistic proposals are based on product analysis and extensive quantum chemical calculations at the DFT(B 3 LYP) and MP 2 levels, on O-allyl and N-allyl isomers and on putative transition state structures for [1, 3 ¢]- and [3, 3 ¢]-sigmatropic migrations. The experimental observations could be only explained {{on the basis of the}} MP 2 / 6 - 31 G(d,p) calculations that favoured the [3, 3 ¢]-sigmatropic migrations, yielding lower energies both for the transition states and for the final isomerization products...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} byproducts of the orange juice industry is the oil phase. This is a mixture of <b>terpenes,</b> <b>alcohols,</b> and aldehydes, dissolved in approximately 96 % limonene. To satisfactorily use oil phase as an ingredient in the food and cosmetics industries separation of the limonene is required. One possibility is to use a fixed bed of silica gel to remove the light or aroma compounds from the limonene. The aroma substances are then extracted from the bed of silica gel using supercritical carbon dioxide. This work deals with the modeling of the desorption step of the process using mass balance equations coupled with the Langmuir equilibrium isotherm. Data taken from the literature for the overall extraction curves were used together with empirical correlations to calculate the concentration profile of solute in the supercritical phase at the bed outlet. The system of equations was solved by the finite volume technique. The overall extraction curves calculated were in good agreement with the experimental ones...|$|R
40|$|The {{negative}} effects of oxygen on white wine quality and the various factors which influence it (including temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH, and free SO 2) are well documented both at the sensory and compositional levels. What is less defined is the quantitative relationship between these parameters and the kinetics {{of the development of}} the {{negative effects}} of oxidation. The experiment presented here attempts to generate data which can be used to predictively model the oxidative degradation of white wines. Bottled wines were submitted to extreme conditions (45 °C temperature, O 2 saturation) during 3 months witth samples taken every 15 days for both sensorial and chemical analysis (GC-O/FPD/MS, 420 nm). The synergistic effects of increasing temperature and O 2 at lower pH are evident, both on the decrease in levels of <b>terpene</b> <b>alcohols</b> and norisoprenoids (which impart floral aromas), and on the development of off-flavors such as “honey-like”, “boiled-potato”, and “farmfeed” associated with the presence of phenylacetaldehyde, methional, and 1, 1, 6 -trimethyl- 1, 2 - dihydronaphthalene...|$|R
