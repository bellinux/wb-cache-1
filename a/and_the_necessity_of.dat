5|$|All five {{versions}} of the speech differ widely from one another in regard to particulars. All versions, except that in the Gesta Francorum, generally agree that Urban talked about the violence of European society <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> maintaining the Peace of God; about helping the Greeks, who had asked for assistance; about the crimes being committed against Christians in the east; and about {{a new kind of}} war, an armed pilgrimage, and of rewards in heaven, where remission of sins was offered to any who might die in the undertaking. They do not all specifically mention Jerusalem as the ultimate goal. However, {{it has been argued that}} Urban's subsequent preaching reveals that he expected the expedition to reach Jerusalem all along. According to one version of the speech, the enthusiastic crowd responded with cries of Deus vult! ("God wills it!"). However, other {{versions of}} the speech do not include this detail.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{taxonomy}} of Theriosuchus itself is somewhat convoluted. Many recent taxonomic studies have not provided an explicit set of characteristics that unite species of Theriosuchus and separate them from other atoposaurids; the only such diagnoses {{that have been}} produced were given by Steve Salisbury and Darren Naish in 2011, and Jeremy Martin et al. in 2010. In 2016 Mark Young et al. criticized these diagnoses, noting that many characters were either more widely distributed among the Atoposauridae, difficult to assess, or - {{in the case of}} the latter diagnosis - not present at all. Young et al. provided an alternative diagnosis containing nine traits, mostly involving teeth; however, they also noted that there was variation among the expression of these traits, which calls into question the monophyly of Theriosuchus. K. langenbergensis differs from this diagnosis in four out of nine traits, which Schwarz et al. cited as a basis for both the generic separation of Knoetschkesuchus <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> revising the diagnosis further.|$|E

5|$|Commelina communis is {{also used}} as a model {{organism}} in plant physiology and plant development to a limited extent, especially in relation to stomatal physiology and the biology of pigmentation development. For example, the blue pigmentation of Asiatic dayflower petals was shown to consist of a large complex of six anthocyanins, six flavones, and two associated magenesium ions, demonstrating that supramolecular complexes of several copigments and chelated metals often determine colour. Other research on the plant has helped to explain photoreceptor systems in plants such as their stomatal responses to blue light versus red light spectrums, abscisic acid perception {{and its role in}} cell signaling, particularly concerning the chemical's role in stomatal function, the role of vanadates in inhibiting stomatal opening, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> calcium in stomatal closure, among other topics. Its widespread use in stomatal studies {{is due to the fact}} that the leaves produce exceptional epidermal peels that are consistently one cell layer thick. This same quality makes the plant popular for use in laboratory exercises in higher education for demonstrating stomatal function and morphology. Guard cell turgor pressure and its regulation in the opening and closing of stomata is particularly easy to demonstrate with the Asiatic dayflower.|$|E
5|$|Continental {{reformer}} Philipp Melanchthon {{was aware}} that he was very much admired by Henry. In early 1539, Melanchthon wrote several letters to Henry criticising his views on religion, in particular his support of clerical celibacy. By late April another delegation from the Lutheran princes arrived to build on Melanchthon's exhortations. Cromwell {{wrote a letter to the}} king in support of the new Lutheran mission. However, the king had begun to change his stance and concentrated on wooing conservative opinion in England rather than reaching out to the Lutherans. On 28 April 1539, Parliament met for the first time in three years. Cranmer was present, but Cromwell was unable to attend due to ill health. On 5 May the House of Lords created a committee with the customary religious balance between conservatives and reformers to examine and determine doctrine. However, the committee was given little time to do the detailed work needed for a thorough revision. On 16 May, the Duke of Norfolk noted that the committee had not agreed on anything, and proposed that the Lords examine six doctrinal questions—which eventually formed the basis of the Six Articles. They affirmed the conservative interpretation of doctrines such as the real presence, clerical celibacy, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> auricular confession, the private confession of sins to a priest. As the Act of the Six Articles neared passage in Parliament, Cranmer moved his wife and children out of England to safety. Up until this time, the family was kept quietly hidden, most likely in Ford Palace in Kent. The Act passed Parliament at the end of June and it forced Latimer and Nicholas Shaxton to resign their dioceses given their outspoken opposition to the measure.|$|E
5|$|Miles {{transferred}} his {{allegiance to}} Empress Matilda, on {{her return to}} England in 1139. According to Professor Edmund King, Miles' decision to support Matilda was guided by expediancy rather than principle, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> joining forces with Matilda's illegitimate half-brother, the powerful Robert, Earl of Gloucester, who was the overlord of some of Miles' fiefs. Stephen stripped Miles of the title 'Constable of England' in punishment for having deserted him. On 25 July 1141, in gratitude for his support and military assistance and, according to historian R.H.C. Davis, possibly to compensate Miles for having appeared to have lost the constableship, Matilda invested him as 1st Earl of Hereford. He also received St. Briavels Castle and the Forest of Dean. At the time Matilda was the de facto ruler of England, Stephen having been imprisoned at Bristol following his capture the previous February after the Battle of Lincoln. Sibyl was styled Countess of Hereford, until Miles' unexpected death over two years later. In 1141, Miles received the honour of Abergavenny from Brien FitzCount, the (likely illegitimate) son of Duke Alan IV of Brittany. This was in appreciation of the skilled military tactics Miles had deployed which had spared Brien's castle of Wallingford during King Stephen's besiegement in 1139/1140. Matilda gave her permission for the transfer.|$|E

25|$|After {{repeated}} {{experiences with}} providing prepared rations to soldiers dating from before World War II, Pentagon officials ultimately realized that simply providing a nutritionally balanced meal {{in the field}} was not adequate. Service members in various geographic regions and combat situations often required different subsets of ingredients for food to be considered palatable over long periods. Moreover, catering to individual tastes and preferences would encourage service members to actually consume the whole ration and its nutrition. Most importantly, the use of specialized forces in extreme environments <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> carrying increasingly heavy field loads while on foot during extended missions required significantly lighter alternatives to standard canned wet rations.|$|E

25|$|The {{challenge}} of building churches and providing ministers for western settlements motivated many Congregationalists {{to engage in}} closer cooperation with the Presbyterians. While the two denominations had different systems of church government, they were both part of the Calvinist tradition. This shared heritage <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> evangelizing the west led them to form united Presbyterian-Congregational institutions and churches in areas where ministers and resources were in short supply. This cooperation was formalized in the Plan of Union, first adopted in 1801 between the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America and the General Association of Connecticut. The plan was later adopted by the Vermont General Convention, the New Hampshire General Association and the Massachusetts General Association.|$|E

25|$|Like {{other forms}} of evangelical Protestantism, Pentecostalism adheres to the inerrancy of the Bible <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> {{accepting}} Christ as personal lord and savior. It is distinguished by belief in the baptism in the Holy Spirit that enables a Christian to live a Spirit-filled and empowered life. This empowerment includes the use of spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues and divine healing—two other defining characteristics of Pentecostalism. Because of their commitment to biblical authority, spiritual gifts, and the miraculous, Pentecostals tend to see their movement as reflecting {{the same kind of}} spiritual power and teachings that were found in the Apostolic Age of the early church. For this reason, some Pentecostals also use the term Apostolic or Full Gospel to describe their movement.|$|E

25|$|The newly invented Western Electric {{moving coil}} or dynamic {{microphone}} {{was part of}} the Wide Range System. It had a flatter audio response than the old style Wente condenser type and didn't require electronics installed in the microphone housing. Signals fed to the cutting head were pre-emphasized in the treble region to help override noise in playback. Groove cuts in the vertical plane were employed rather than the usual lateral cuts. The chief advantage claimed was more grooves per inch that could be crowded together, resulting in longer playback time. Additionally, the problem of inner groove distortion, which plagued lateral cuts, could be avoided with the vertical cut system. Wax masters were made by flowing heated wax over a hot metal disc thus avoiding the microscopic irregularities of cast blocks of wax <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> planing and polishing.|$|E
25|$|In 1379 Bishop Buckingham {{confirmed}} {{an important}} ordinance of Thomas Marshall, setting apart certain {{funds for the}} education of one of the canons at Oxford. The prior alludes to the poverty of his house, which was so great that {{were it not for the}} help of friends they would not be able to live decently and honestly, and religion would be diminished. Hitherto there had not been enough canons nor enough money to set apart one for special study; but the prior now wished to do so (partly out of the profits of a chantry established by his own family), 'seeing the advantage of learning <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> preaching, the priory being a populous place where a great number of people come together.' All this certainly points to a satisfactory state of the priory under Thomas Marshall, and accords well with what we know of his character from other sources.|$|E
25|$|It is this {{difference}} in spirit and general outlook which is the significant thing about industrial unionism.

Instead of emphasizing the divisions among the workers and fostering a narrow interest in the affairs of the craft regardless of those of the industry as a whole, it lays stress on the mutual dependence of the skilled and the unskilled <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> subordinating the interests of a small group to those of the whole body of workers.
