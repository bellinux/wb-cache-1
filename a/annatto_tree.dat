50|$|The <b>annatto</b> <b>tree</b> B. orellana is {{believed}} to originate from Brazil. It was probably not initially used as a food additive, but for other purposes such as ritual and decorative body painting (still an important tradition in many Brazilian native tribes), sunscreen, and insect repellent, and for medical purposes. It was used for Mexican manuscript painting in the 16th century.|$|E
40|$|Annatto extract is {{a natural}} food color {{obtained}} from the outer coatings of {{the seeds of the}} <b>Annatto</b> <b>tree</b> (Bixa orellana L.). This is the first report in the literature that shows the relationship between the aqueous annatto extract and its influence on lipid profile in animals. Male Fisher rats were divided into three groups (n= 12) : C group, fed standard diet and water; H group, fed high-lipid diet and water and; HU group, with high-lipid diet and aqueous annatto extract for 60 days. The treatment with annatto extract in animals fed with the high-lipid diet lowered the LDL- and total cholesterol and raised the HDL-cholesterol, suggesting a hypocholesterolemic effect. Neither highfat diet nor aqueous annatto extract had any significant effect on serum levels of albumin or serum activities of transaminases which suggested that no liver injury was induced...|$|E

Extrato de urucum é um corante alimentar natural que é obtido da casca das sementes do urucueiro (Bixa orellana L.). Este é o primeiro trabalho da literatura que mostra a relação entre o extrato aquoso de urucum e sua influência no perfil lipídico de animais. Durante 60 dias, 36 ratos machos Fisher foram divididos em 3 grupos: Grupo C que recebeu uma dieta controle e água; Grupo H que recebeu uma dieta rica em lipídios e água e; Grupo HU que recebeu uma dieta rica em lipídios e extrato aquoso de semente de urucum. O tratamento com extrato de urucum nos animais alimentados com a dieta rica em lipídios abaixou o colesterol total e a fração LDL e aumentou a fração HDL, sugerindo um efeito hipocolesterolemiante. Nem a dieta rica em lipídios, nem o extrato de urucum tiveram algum efeito sobre os níveis séricos de albumina ou sobre a atividade de alanina aminotransferase e aspartato aminotransferase. Este fato sugere que o consumo do extrato não provocou injúria hepática nos animais...|$|E
40|$|Bixa orellana (<b>annatto</b> or {{lipstick}} <b>tree)</b> is {{a perennial}} tropical plant that stores and produces considerable quantities of the apocarotenoid bixin, a culturally and economically important pigment used worldwide. However, the mechanisms underlying the gene regulation and pigment accumulation of bixin and carotenoids in annatto remain unknown. Bixin {{is present in}} the different tissues of the plant, although this pigment is primarily accumulated in the seed coat. Thus, the leaves are useful organs for understanding carotenoid and bixin production, thereby facilitating the study of this pigment, which would otherwise be difficult in ligneous adult plants. To study the regulation of bixin synthesis and to determine which genes are important regulatory molecules at the transcription level, the herbicide norflurazon (NF) was used to block carotenoid synthesis and bixin concentrations in B. orellana leaves. The genes activated {{in the early stages of}} the carotenoid pathway are involved in lycopene production (dxs, psy and pds), and those induced in the later stages of the carotenoid pathway, such as β and ε-lycopene cyclases and boccd 1, were differentially expressed compared with the control. The expression of some genes was more susceptible to certain concentrations of NF, potentially reflecting the roles of these genes in carotenoid synthesis in B. orellana. These results suggest that apocarotenoids, such as bixin, are synthesized using alternative precursors through the actions of genes that have not yet been identified...|$|R
