5|$|A {{joint line}} through the Denburn Valley to link the Great North to the south had been planned, and the Great North had <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> {{railways}} using the Guild Street station in 1853 and 1857 but were unhappy with the assistance that had been offered. Permission was granted in 1861 to the Inverness & Perth Junction Railway to build a line from , on the Inverness & Aberdeen Junction Railway, direct to Perth. The Great North protested, and won the right for a booking office in Inverness. The line opened in 1863 and in 1865 the Inverness & Perth Junction and Inverness & Aberdeen Junction merged to become the Highland Railway. The Aberdeen Railway, which had now been absorbed by the Scottish North Eastern Railway (SNER), <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> Great North, concerned that the new line had bypassed Aberdeen, but no agreement was reached.|$|E

5|$|As the eye moved onshore in Florida, the {{convection}} in the eyewall strengthened due {{to increased}} convergence, and Hurricane Hunters reported a warmer eyewall temperature than two hours prior. However, Andrew weakened as it continued further inland, and after crossing southern Florida in four hours, the storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico with winds of 130 mph (210 km/h). In the Gulf of Mexico, the eye remained well-defined as the hurricane turned to the west-northwest, a change due to the weakening of the ridge to its north. Andrew steadily re-intensified over the Gulf of Mexico, reaching winds of 145 mph (235 km/h) late on August 25. As the high pressure system to its north weakened, a strong mid-latitude trough <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> area from the northwest. This caused the hurricane to decelerate to the northwest, and winds decreased as Andrew <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> Gulf Coast of the United States.|$|E

On 10 October, two brief bursts of convection surprised forecasters, but with the sea surface temperature as low as 22°C (72°F), the flares were not sustained. Vince continued to weaken as it <b>approached</b> <b>the</b> Iberian Peninsula and became a tropical depression on 11 October, shortly before it made landfall near Huelva, Spain.
