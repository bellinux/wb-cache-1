5|$|In the meantime, Kyle, Stan and Kenny watch America's Stupidest Home Videos; {{they hear}} there's a $10,000 grand prize for the stupidest home video. They decide {{to enter the}} {{competition}} with the video they made of Cartman. Cartman approaches Kyle and Stan (Kenny was dragged to a train track by Stan's go-cart and killed by an oncoming train) with the depressing news about his lack of funds to find out his real father. Stan and Kyle agree that if they win the video contest they will give Cartman the $3,000 needed for the DNA testing. Cartman is overjoyed, but quickly becomes extremely angry after seeing the aired video. Though they do not win the competition, as Stan's grandfather wins with a videotape he made of Kenny's death, they receive a $3,000 runner-up prize instead, which is still enough for the DNA test. Dr. Mephesto calls together Cartman, his mother and all potential fathers (including the 1989 Denver Broncos), when he gets the test results which is where Kenny comes back to life. When {{he is about to}} reveal the identity of Cartman's father, a narrator states that the <b>answer</b> <b>will</b> be revealed in the new South Park episode four weeks later, much to Cartman's annoyance and anger.|$|E
25|$|If {{dividend}} and divisor {{have the}} same sign, the result is always positive. Another method of dividing negative numbers is that {{if one of the}} numbers being divided is a negative, the <b>answer</b> <b>will</b> be negative.|$|E
25|$|There is no {{guarantee}} that the <b>answer</b> <b>will</b> be provided in the same language as the question, and a Member relying on the simultaneous interpretation may respond to something differing slightly from the actual question asked. For the most part, bilingual Members respond to the question in the language in which it was asked.|$|E

25|$|We {{abuse the}} Holocaust {{when it becomes}} a cudgel against others who have their claims of suffering. The Shoah must not be misused in the contest of one-downsmanship with other victims of brutality....The Shoah has become our instant raison d'etre, the {{short-cut}} answer to the penetrating questions of our children: 'Why should I not marry out of the faith? Why should I join a synagogue? Why should I support Israel? Why should I be Jewish?' We have relied on a singular imperative: 'Thou shalt not give Hitler a posthumous victory.' That <b>answer</b> <b>will</b> not work. To live in spite, to say 'no' to Hitler {{is a far cry}} from living 'yes' to Judaism.|$|E
25|$|In addition, Ace Combat 5 is {{the first}} in the series to feature wingman interaction. During most {{campaign}} missions, the player can issue orders to the AI members of his or her unit using the DualShock controller's directional pad. The player also must purchase and assign aircraft for each of the squadron's pilots prior to each mission. Additionally, players may choose to respond to YES/NO questions during missions by squadron mates or other characters in the game. Although the player's response or lack thereof may affect the game's dialogue, the effect these questions have on gameplay is minimal, although the player's <b>answer</b> <b>will</b> affect which one of two missions they will undergo at two different points of the game.|$|E
25|$|Ah Jie's brother {{wakes up}} from his coma {{on the day the}} winner of the cooking {{competition}} is to be decided. Kai Qi wins and Ah Jie knowing that she can now accept being together with him again leans in for a kiss, however Kai Qi's reaction surprises everyone. Hao Wei sees it as a sign to confess his feelings for Kai Qi, but she rejects him midway into his confession. Knowing what her <b>answer</b> <b>will</b> be beforehand, Hao Wei tells her he will be leaving the country to pursue his real interest. Ah Jie unhappy with Kai Qi running out on him that day, has the entire restaurant staff help him teach her a lesson by pretending to ignore his love for her. Knowing she has done Ah Jie wrong, Kai Qi puts her pride aside and publicly confesses her love for Ah Jie.|$|E

500|$|Following the strikes, Osama bin Laden's {{spokesman}} {{announced that}} [...] "The battle has not started yet. Our <b>answer</b> <b>will</b> be deeds, not words." [...] Zawahiri made {{a phone call}} to reporter Rahimullah Yusufzai, stating that [...] "We survived the attack... we aren't afraid of bombardment, threats, and acts of aggression... we are ready for more sacrifices. The war has only just begun; the Americans should now await the answer." [...] Al-Qaeda attempted to recruit chemists to develop a more addictive type of heroin for export to the U.S. and Western Europe, but was unsuccessful. A September 1998 intelligence report was titled [...] "UBL Plans for Reprisals Against U.S. Targets, Possibly in U.S.," [...] while the August 6, 2001, President's Daily Brief stated that after Operation Infinite Reach, [...] "Bin Ladin told followers he wanted to retaliate in Washington." ...|$|E
500|$|Poe {{wrote the}} poem as a narrative, without {{intentionally}} creating an allegory or falling into didacticism. The main {{theme of the}} poem is one of undying devotion. The narrator experiences a perverse conflict between desire to forget and desire to remember. He seems to get some pleasure from focusing on loss. The narrator assumes that the word [...] "Nevermore" [...] is the raven's [...] "only stock and store", and, yet, he continues to ask it questions, knowing what the <b>answer</b> <b>will</b> be. His questions, then, are purposely self-deprecating and further incite his feelings of loss. Poe leaves it unclear if the raven actually {{knows what it is}} saying or if it really intends to cause a reaction in the poem's narrator. The narrator begins as [...] "weak and weary," [...] becomes regretful and grief-stricken, before passing into a frenzy and, finally, madness. Christopher F. S. Maligec suggests the poem is a type of elegiac paraclausithyron, an ancient Greek and Roman poetic form consisting of the lament of an excluded, locked-out lover at the sealed door of his beloved.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{begins with}} an {{announcement}} that viewers have waited for weeks for {{the answer to the}} mystery [...] "Who Is Cartman's Father", but then points out that the <b>answer</b> <b>will</b> not be revealed in this episode; instead, there is a presentation of Not Without My Anus starring Terrance and Phillip. A caption wishes the viewers a happy April Fools' Day. The drama itself opens in a courtroom in Canada, with Terrance on trial for the murder of a local doctor; Phillip is his lawyer while Terrance and Phillip's sworn nemesis, Scott, who has had a long hatred of the duo's toilet humour, is acting as the prosecutor. Scott uses a group of seemingly airtight exhibits to prove Terrance's guilt, while Terrance's defense consists of nothing but a long string of fart jokes. Ultimately, the jury returns a verdict of not guilty. Angered, Scott promises vengeance. He is ultimately approached by Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, proposing a deal: Saddam would assist in getting Terrance and Phillip out of Canada, in exchange for Scott assisting Saddam and his Iraqi associates into Canada. Scott is apprehensive about trusting Saddam, but agrees to the deal. The pair then conspires to kidnap Sally, daughter of Terrance and Celine Dion, and hold her hostage, as bait to lure Terrance and Phillip to Tehran; Saddam's soldiers would then murder Terrance and Phillip on arrival.|$|E
50|$|By doing {{individual}} depth interviews, {{one can get}} unique {{points from}} each respondent, and their <b>answers</b> <b>will</b> not be influenced by other people as in a focus group.|$|R

5000|$|The final quiz {{will consist}} of oral {{questions}} and visual displays. Correct <b>answers</b> <b>will</b> fetch marks for the team. No marks will be deducted for incorrect answers or no responses.|$|R
2500|$|To {{properly}} {{use this}} formula, the units must be consistent; for example, [...] {{must be in}} kilograms, and [...] must be in meters. The <b>answer</b> <b>will</b> be in meters per second.|$|E
2500|$|The site {{does not}} have a system that filters the correct answers from the {{incorrect}} answers. At one time, the community could vote for the best answer among the posted answers; but that option was disabled in March 2014. For most of the life of Yahoo! Answers, once the [...] "best answer" [...] was chosen, {{there was no way to}} add more answers nor to improve or challenge the best answer chosen by the question asker; there is a display of thumbs down or thumbs up for each answer, but viewers cannot vote. In April 2014, this was changed to allow for additional answers after a best answer is chosen, but the best answer can never be changed. Also, while [...] "best answers" [...] can be briefly commented upon, the comment is not visible by default and is hence hardly read. (Even the user who posts the question isn't notified, before or after the best answer is picked, about a comment on the question or on the best answer.) If the best answer chosen is wrong or contains problematic information, the only chance to give a better (or correct) <b>answer</b> <b>will</b> be the next time the same question is asked. The older <b>answer</b> <b>will</b> likely get higher priority in search engines. Any new <b>answer</b> <b>will</b> most probably not be seen by any original questioner.|$|E
2500|$|Because of its {{fragmented}} {{state and}} {{damage to the}} coil {{it is not possible}} at this stage to confirm exact dimensions for this apparatus. A rough estimate would suggest something in the order of [...] but a definitive <b>answer</b> <b>will</b> be able to be determined once it is reassembled and the coil has been correctly aligned and integrated.|$|E

2500|$|Remove {{two columns}} {{corresponding}} to adjacent regions from the matrix, {{and work out}} the determinant of the new n by n matrix. [...] Depending on the columns removed, the <b>answer</b> <b>will</b> differ by multiplication by [...] [...] To resolve this ambiguity, divide out the largest possible power of t and multiply by âˆ’1 if necessary, so that the constant term is positive. [...] This gives the Alexander polynomial.|$|E
2500|$|The 2008 version {{features}} six {{new schools}} every week, the winning schools to reappear {{later in the}} season for semi-finals and Grand Finals. Each individual episode features five teams (green, red, blue, yellow and purple), each made up of six members from each school. There is a new feature called the [...] "Clean Sweep" [...] it only occurs when a team answers all questions correct in the first round. The correct <b>answer</b> <b>will</b> award the team with 20 points.|$|E
2500|$|Vosill {{requests}} the King {{release her}} from her duties, which he does. [...] She leaves {{just a few days}} later on a ship for Drezen, and is seen off at the dock by Oelph. Oelph tries to suppress the urge to ask to accompany Vosill, since he knows that her <b>answer</b> <b>will</b> be in the negative, but in the end he does so anyway. The ship leaves sometime later, Vosill nowhere to be seen on board.|$|E
50|$|Self-report {{studies have}} many advantages, {{but they also}} suffer from {{specific}} disadvantages due to the way that subjects generally behave. Self-reported answers may be exaggerated; respondents may be too embarrassed to reveal private details; various biases may affect the results, like social desirability bias. Subjects may also forget pertinent details. Self-report studies are inherently biased by the person's feelings {{at the time they}} filled out the questionnaire. If a person feels bad at the time they fill out the questionnaire, for example, their <b>answers</b> <b>will</b> be more negative. If the person feels good at the time, then the <b>answers</b> <b>will</b> be more positive.|$|R
50|$|It is {{the best}} of five, so whoever gets three correct <b>answers</b> <b>will</b> proceed to the final round, 'Wait A Minute'. Whoever lost will be forced to enter the drop zone and enter the goo portal.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was {{one minute}} after," [...] <b>answered</b> <b>Will</b> Knook, [...] "and {{that is as}} bad as one hour. I shall set the {{stinging}} gnats on Glossie and Flossie, and they will thus suffer terribly for their disobedience." ...|$|R
2500|$|An {{example of}} an A-not-A {{question}} in English is in (1.a) [...] "Are you happy or sad?". The {{response to this question}} must be an echo answer, stating either [...] "I am happy," [...] or the correct alternative, [...] "I am sad". In other words, this sentence is a leading question, where the speaker has an expectation as to what the <b>answer</b> <b>will</b> be. In contrast, (1.b) [...] "Are you happy or not?" [...] is a neutral question where the answer to this can be yes or no in response to the first and more explicitly stated alternative.|$|E
2500|$|The {{substitution}} is not detected and {{corrected by}} the reflective system. For example, when asked [...] "A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1 {{more than the}} ball. How much does the ball cost?" [...] many subjects incorrectly answer $0.10. An explanation in terms of attribute substitution is that, rather than work out the sum, subjects parse the sum of $1.10 into a large amount and a small amount, which is easy to do. Whether they feel that is the right <b>answer</b> <b>will</b> depend on whether they check the calculation with their reflective system.|$|E
2500|$|The {{class of}} {{problems}} that can be efficiently solved by quantum computers is called BQP, for [...] "bounded error, quantum, polynomial time". Quantum computers only run probabilistic algorithms, so BQP on quantum computers is the counterpart of BPP ("bounded error, probabilistic, polynomial time") on classical computers. It {{is defined as the}} set of problems solvable with a polynomial-time algorithm, whose probability of error is bounded away from one half. A quantum computer is said to [...] "solve" [...] a problem if, for every instance, its <b>answer</b> <b>will</b> be right with high probability. If that solution runs in polynomial time, then that problem is in BQP.|$|E
