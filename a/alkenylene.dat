These polymerizations, which are performed under bulk conditions and a t low temperatures, continuously release ethylene to give poly (1, 1, 3, 3, 5, 5 -hexamethyltrisiloxanyl- 2 -butenylene) (5), poly(l,l, 3, 3 -tetramethyldisiloxanyl- 4 -octenylene ~ (7), poly(l,l, 3, 3 -tetramethyldisiloxanyl-p-phenylene- 1, 1, 3, 3 -tetramethyldisiloxanyl- 2 -butenylene) (S), and poly (1, 1, 3, 3 -tetramethyldisiloxanylpentylene-co-l, 1, 3, 3 -tetramethyldisiloxanyl- 4 -octenylene) (1 l), respectively. Bis(viny 1) tetramethyldisiloxane fails to homopo-lymerize under ADMET conditions, and bis(ally 1) tetramethyldisiloxane (2) releases ethylene when catalyzed by 1 in the absence of solvent, to give, exclusively, the ring-closed product, 1, 1, 3, 3 -tetramethyldisiloxacyclohept- 5 -ene (3). Extending the methylene units or the siloxane linkage in the monomer results in facile ADMET polycondensation, in essentially quantitative conversions, affording well-defined, low-T,, linear polymers with known vinylic end groups. The polymerizations are void of competing reactions except when back-bitin...|$|E
40|$|Nine poly(arylene <b>alkenylenes)</b> with phenyl, thienyl and furanyl substituents on ethenylenic or butadienylenic links were synthesized: one via dehydrohalogenation, {{the others}} via Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reactions. For the latter {{approach}} five new diketones of type arylCOarylCOaryl and arylCOCHCHarylCHCHCOaryl were prepared. In addition 1, 4 -bis(2, 2 -diphenylethenyl) benzene (1 a) and 1, 4 -bis[2 -(p-tolyl) - 2 -phenylethenyl]benzene (2 a) {{were made to}} serve as model compounds. All materials were characterized by NMR, IR and mass spectroscopy. The polymers are soluble in CHCl 3, allowing {{the determination of the}} molecular weight distribution by GPC and the preparation of films. The latter were doped by iodine vapour to give d. c. conductivities of about 10 - 10 S cm- 1 for the substituted ethenylenes and about 10 - 4 S cm- 1 for the substituted butadienylenes. The results suggest large deviations from planarity in the ethenylenes, which is corroborated by the NMR behaviour of 1 a. Complete shift assignments are given of 13 C spectra of 1 a and 2 a, proving that 1 a is conformationally homogeneous, but that 2 a is synthesized as a statistical mixture of three configurations.

40|$|Hydrolysis and {{condensation}} of organically bridged bis-triethoxysilanes, (EtO) {sub 3 }Si-R-Si(OEt) {sub 3 }, {{results in}} the formation of three dimensional organic/inorganic hybrid networks (Equation 1). Properties of these materials, including porosity, are dependent {{on the nature of the}} bridging group, R. Flexible groups (akylene-spacers longer than five carbons in length) polymerize under acidic conditions to give non-porous materials. Rigid groups (such as arylene-, alkynylene-, or <b>alkenylene)</b> form non-porous, microporous, and macroporous gels. In many cases the pore size distributions are quite narrow. One of the motivations for preparing hybrid organic-inorganic materials is to extend the range of properties available with sol-gel systems by incorporating organic groups into the inorganic network. For example, organically modified silica gels arc either prepared by co-polymerizing an organoalkoxysilane with a silica precursor or surface silylating the inorganic gel. This can serve to increase hydrophobicity or to introduce some reactive organic functionality. However, the type and orientation of these organic functionalities is difficult to control. Furthermore, many organoalkoxysilanes can act to inhibitor even prevent gelation, limiting the final density of organic functionalities. We have devised a new route for preparing highly functionalized pores in hybrid materials using bridging groups that are thermally converted into the desired functionalities after the gel has been obtained. In this paper, we present the preparation and characterization of bridged polysilsesquioxanes with Diels-Alder adducts as the bridging groups from the sol-gel polymerization of monomers 2 and 4. The bridging groups are constructed such that the retro Diela-Alder reaction releases the dienes and leaves the dienophiles as integral parts of the network polymers. In the rigid architecture of a xerogel, this loss of organic functionality should liberate sufficient space to modify the overall porosity. Furthermore, the new porosity will be functionalized with the dienophilic olefin bridging group. We also demonstrate that by changing the type of Diels-Alder adduct used as the bridging group, we can change the temperature at which the retro-Diels-Alder reaction will occur...|$|E
