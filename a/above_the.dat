5|$|A {{permanent}} asymmetric moon {{dust cloud}} exists around the Moon, created by small particles from comets. Estimates are 5 tons of comet particles strike the Moon's surface each 24 hours. The particles strike the Moon's surface ejecting moon dust <b>above</b> <b>the</b> Moon. The dust stays <b>above</b> <b>the</b> Moon approximately 10 minutes, taking 5 minutes to rise, and 5 minutes to fall. On average, 120 kilograms of dust are present <b>above</b> <b>the</b> Moon, rising to 100 kilometers <b>above</b> <b>the</b> surface. The dust measurements {{were made by}} LADEE's Lunar Dust EXperiment (LDEX), between 20 and 100 kilometers <b>above</b> <b>the</b> surface, during a six-month period. LDEX detected an average of one 0.3 micrometer moon dust particle each minute. Dust particle counts peaked during the Geminid, Quadrantid, Northern Taurid, and Omicron Centaurid meteor showers, when the Earth, and Moon, pass through comet debris. The cloud is asymmetric, more dense near {{the boundary between the}} Moon's dayside and nightside.|$|E
5|$|A valley exit jet is a strong, down-valley, {{elevated}} {{air current}} that emerges <b>above</b> <b>the</b> {{intersection of the}} valley and its adjacent plain. These winds frequently reach a maximum of 20m/s (45mph or 72km/h) at a height of 40–200 m <b>above</b> <b>the</b> ground. Surface winds below the jet may sway vegetation, but are significantly weaker.|$|E

5|$|In {{the western}} churches, the mitre was placed <b>above</b> <b>the</b> shield of all persons who were {{entitled}} to wear the mitre, including abbots. It substituted for the helmet of military arms, but also appeared as a crest placed atop a helmet, as was common in German heraldry. In the Anglican Churches, the mitre is still placed <b>above</b> <b>the</b> arms of bishops and not an ecclesiastical hat. In the Roman Catholic Church, {{the use of the}} mitre <b>above</b> <b>the</b> shield on the personal arms of clergy was suppressed in 1969, and is now found only on some corporate arms, like those of dioceses. Previously, the mitre was often included under the hat, and even in the arms of a cardinal, the mitre was not entirely displaced.|$|E
