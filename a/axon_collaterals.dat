40|$|The {{formation}} of <b>axon</b> <b>collateral</b> branches {{is a fundamental}} aspect {{of the development of}} neuronal circuits. Emergence of axonal filopodia from the axon {{is the first step in}} the {{formation of}} <b>axon</b> <b>collateral</b> branches and pre-synaptic structures. Using embryonic sensory axons as a model system, we have determined that axonal filopodia are formed from transient accumulations of F-actin within the axon, termed actin patches. We found that the branch-inducing factor NGF induces the formation of axonal actin patches and filopodia. NGF signaling, through PI 3 K, promotes the formation of localized axonal microdomains of PIP 3 accumulation. The microdomains in turn drive formation of actin patches. Under basal conditions, only a subset of actin patches gives rise to filopodia, and many patches dissipate without forming a filopodium. Neither NGF nor direct activation of PI 3 K affects the probability that an actin patch will give rise to a filopodium. Thus, NGF increases formation of axonal filopodia through localized PI 3 K signaling that promotes the initiation of actin patch precursors to the formation of axonal filopodia. The promotion of actin patch formation by NGF may be mediated through a PI 3 K-TOR pathway driving intra-axonal protein synthesis. We propose the hypothesis that NGF signaling “turns up the volume” on the mechanism of filopodial formation by increasing axonal levels of the cytoskeletal proteins required for the orchestration of actin patch formation by PIP 3 microdomains...|$|R
40|$|Absence epilepsy—the {{most common}} form of {{childhood}} epi-leptic disorders—is characterized by a brief and frequent loss of consciousness associated with generalized spike-and-wave discharges (1). These discharges represent synchronized oscil-lations in the corticothalamic system in which the thalamus is proposed to be an essential rhythm generator (2), although the role of the thalamus versus the cortex in absence seizure initiation remains controversial (3 – 5). The corticothalamic system is composed of reciprocally connected excitatory thala-mocortical and corticothalamic pathways along with a key intervening structure, the reticular thalamus (RT).

40|$|The {{sprouting}} of <b>axon</b> <b>collateral</b> branches {{is important}} in the establishment and refinement of neuronal connections during both development and regeneration.

We report here that sensory neuron axonal shafts rapidly sprout filopodia at sites of contact with nerve growth factor-coated polystyrene beads. Some sprouts can extend up to at least 60 �m through multiple bead contacts. Axonal filopodial sprouts often contained microtubules and exhibited a debundling of axonal microtubules at the site of bead–axon contact. Cytochalasin treatment abolished the filopodial sprouting, but not the accumulation of actin filaments at sites of bead–axon contact.

5000|$|The {{types of}} neurons {{found in the}} stratum lucidum are called interneurons, neurons which form a {{connection}} between other neurons in a different location. This situation is described in the mossy fiber axon connection in the CA3 stratum lucidum region of the hippocampus as is in relation to Purkinje cells. The interneurons found in the stratum lucidum are of two classes, spiny and aspiny. Spiny neurons are a [...] "special type of inhibitory cell", characterized by spiny projections on the dendrites of the cell. The axons of these neurons in the hippocampus terminate primarily in the stratum lucidum and stratum radiatum of CA3. Spiny neurons are of importance because of their [...] "pivotal role in motor control, habit formation, and motivated behavior". They receive synaptic inputs from mossy fibers boutons, as well as multiple other synaptic terminals. The majority of <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> of these neurons remain in the stratum lucidum and CA3 region, though in some cases <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> of these neurons are observed migrating into the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Aspiny neurons, the second class of neurons found in the stratum lucidum, are another type of inhibitory cell similar to spiny neurons, though lacking dendrite projections. They make {{up the majority of}} the neuron composition in comparison to spiny neurons, about 63 percent. The somata of aspiny neurons are for the most part bipolar, generating 2-5 primary dendrites [...] "that to a varying extent displayed varicose swellings in their course". Similar to spiny neurons, aspiny neuron dendrites [...] "branch extensively in stratum lucidum and stratum radiatum of CA3", in contrast to spiny neurons, however, some dendrites [...] "traversed stratum pyramidale and entered stratum oriens", the second deepest layer of the hippocampus. Additionally, what distinguishes aspiny neurons form spiny neurons is their higher maximal firing rates and narrower action potential half-widths than their spiny counterparts.|$|E

50|$|The {{region is}} {{conventionally}} {{divided into three}} divisions. CA3a {{is the part of}} the cell band that is most distant from the dentate (and closest to CA1). CA3b is the middle part of the band nearest to the fimbria and fornix connection. CA3c is nearest to the dentate, inserting into the hilus. CA3 overall, has been considered to be the “pacemaker” of the hippocampus. Much of the synchronous bursting activity associated with interictal epileptiform activity appears to be generated in CA3. Its excitatory collateral connectivity seems to be mostly responsible for this. CA3 uniquely, has pyramidal cell <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> that ramify extensively with local regions and make excitatory contacts with them. CA3 has been implicated in a number of working theories on memory and hippocampal learning processes. Slow oscillatory rhythms (theta-band; 3-8 Hz) are cholinergically driven patterns that depend on coupling of interneurons and pyramidal cell axons via gap junctions, as well as glutaminergic (excitatory) and GABAergic (inhibitory) synapses. Sharp EEG waves seen here are also implicated in memory consolidation.|$|E

Furthermore, in {{a subset of}} slices, mossy fiber stimulation triggers synaptically mediated long-latency epileptiform burst discharges. These data indicate that loss of KV 1. 1 from its normal localization in axons and terminals of the CA 3 region results in increased excitability in the CA 3 recurrent <b>axon</b> <b>collateral</b> system, perhaps contributing to the limbic and tonic–clonic components of the observed epileptic phenotype.

40|$|Axonal injury {{increases}} intracellular Ca 2 + and cAMP and {{has been}} shown to induce gene expression, which is thought to be a key event for regeneration. Increases in intracellular Ca 2 + and/or cAMP can alter gene expression via activation of a family of transcription factors that bind to and modulate the expression of CRE (Ca 2 +/cAMP response element) sequence-containing genes. We have used Aplysia motor neurons to examine the role of CRE-binding proteins in axonal regeneration after injury. We report that axonal injury increases the binding of proteins to a CRE sequence-containing probe. In addition, Western blot analysis revealed that the level of ApCREB 2, a CRE sequence-binding repressor, was enhanced as a result of axonal injury. The sequestration of CRE-binding proteins by microinjection of CRE sequence-containing plasmids enhanced <b>axon</b> <b>collateral</b> formation (both number and length) as compared with control plasmid injections.

A segment of <b>axon</b> <b>collateral</b> of 87 μm carried 17 synapses, the proximal 27 μm being free of synapses. The main axon was postsynaptic down to a length of 30 μm. On the following 163 μm there were six presynaptic elements. On the proximal parts of four other collaterals, five synapses were found; a few synapses might, however, have been missed on these ramifications.

40|$|Neurons in the {{developing}} CNS tend to send out long <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> to multiple target areas. For these neurons to attain specific connections, some of their <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> are subsequently pruned—a process called stereotyped axon pruning. One {{of the most striking}} examples of stereotyped pruning in the CNS is the pruning of corticospinal tract (CST) axons. The long CST collaterals from layer V neurons of the visual and motor cortices are differentially pruned during development. Here we demonstrate that select plexins and neuropilins, which serve as coreceptors for semaphorins, are expressed in visual cortical neurons at the time when CST <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> are stereotypically pruned. By analyzing mutant mice, we find that the pruning of visual, but not motor, CST <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> depends on plexin-A 3, plexin-A 4, and neuropilin- 2. Expression pattern study suggests that Sema 3 F is a candidate local cue for the pruning of visual CST axons. Using electron microscopic analysis, we also show that visual CST <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> form synaptic contacts in the spinal cord before pruning and that the unpruned collaterals in adult mutant mice are unmyelinated and maintain their synaptic contacts. Our results indicate that the stereotyped pruning of the visual and motor CST <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> is differentially regulated and that this specificity arises from the differential expression of plexin receptors in the cortex...|$|E

We show that Purkinje cell <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> project asymmetrically in the sagittal plane, directed away from the lobule apex. Based on our anatomical and physiological characterization of this connection, we construct a network model that robustly generates waves of activity traveling along chains of connected Purkinje cells. Consistent with the model, we observe traveling waves of activity in Purkinje cells in sagittal slices from young mice that require GABAA receptor-mediated transmission and intact Purkinje cell <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals.</b> These traveling waves are absent in adult animals, suggesting they play a developmental role in wiring the cerebellar cortical microcircuit...|$|E
40|$|In {{cortical}} pyramidal neurons the presynaptic terminals controlling transmitter release {{are located}} along unmyelinated <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals,</b> {{far from the}} original action potential (AP) initiation site, the axon initial segment (AIS). Once initiated, APs will need to reliably propagate over long distances and regions of geometrical inhomogeneity like branch points (BPs) to rapidly depolarize the presynaptic terminals and confer temporally precise synaptic transmission. While axon pathologies such as demyelinating diseases are well established to impede the fidelity of AP propagation along internodes, to which extent myelin loss affects propagation along BPs and <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> is not well understood. Here, using the cuprizone demyelination model, we performed optical voltage-sensitive dye (VSD) imaging from control and demyelinated layer 5 pyramidal neuron axons. In the main axon, we find that myelin loss switches the modality of AP propagation from rapid saltation towards a slow continuous wave. The duration of single AP waveforms at BPs or nodes was, however, only slightly briefer. In contrast, by using two-photon microscopy-guided loose-seal patch recordings from <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> we revealed a presynaptic AP broadening in combination with a reduced velocity and frequency-dependent failure. Finally, internodal myelin loss was also associated with de novo sprouting of <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> starting from the primary (demyelinated) axon. Thus, the loss of oligodendrocytes and myelin sheaths bears functional consequences beyond the main axon, impeding the temporal fidelity of presynaptic APs and affecting the functional and structural organization of synaptic connectivity within the neocortex...|$|E

In the mutant, 90 % of Purkinje cells selectively degenerate between postnatal days 23 and 50. Losses are greater in lateral than medial regions. Other cerebellar neurons appear normal. The first morphological abnormality recognized {{is the presence of}} rounded mitochondria in perikarya of some Purkinje cells of the mutant at 9 days after birth.

In the perikaryon, the basal polysomal accumulation and climbing fiber-somatic spine synapses are sometimes abnormally retained. Cisternae of the Golgi apparatus and rough endoplasmic reticulum cease to form aligned stacks, and decrease in number, while polysomes dissociate into free ribosomes. These changes are progressive, culminating in cell death.

All labeled GP neurons had similar firing properties and gave rise to local <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals,</b> the main synaptic targets of which were perikarya and primary dendrites. The neurons could be divided into two populations; neurons located within approximately 100 microm of the striatopallidal border ("outer" neurons), which possess a mean of 264 local axonal boutons, and those located approximately 100 microm or more from the striatopallidal border ("inner" neurons), which possess a mean of 581 local axonal boutons. The local <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> gave rise to arborizations close to, or within, the parent dendritic field and arborizations located caudal, medial, and ventral to the parent neuron. The qualitative and quantitative differences in the connectivity of neurons located in the outer and inner regions of the GP underlie a complex microcircuitry that follows an asymmetric rostral to caudal organization. These data suggest that the GP should no longer be considered as an homogeneous relay nucleus that simply transmits striatal information to the subthalamic nucleus and basal ganglia output nuclei, but rather as a structure that can perform complex computations within its borders...|$|E

However, the cell-type dependency on the interactions between neurons and underlying micropatterns has been rarely investigated despite the inherent differences in the morphology of neuronal types. In this study, we used surface-printed microdot arrays to investigate the effect of the same micropatterns on the growth of mouse spinal interneuron, mouse hippocampal neurons, and rat hippocampal neurons. While mouse hippocampal neurons showed no significantly different growth on control and patterned substrates, we found the microdot arrays had different effects on early neuronal growth depending on the cell type; spinal interneurons tended to grow faster in length, whereas hippocampal neurons tended to form more <b>axon</b> <b>collateral</b> branches in response to the microdot arrays. Although there was a similar trend in the neurite length and branch number of both neurons changed across the microdot arrays with the expanded range of size and spacing, the dominant responses of each neuron, neurite elongation of mouse spinal interneurons and branching augmentation of rat hippocampal neurons were still preserved. Therefore, our results demonstrate that the same design of micropatterns could cause different neuronal growth results, raising an intriguing issue of considering cell types in neural interface designs...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} that regulate synapse formation and maintenance are incompletely understood. In particular, relatively few inhibitors of synapse formation have been identified. Receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase r (RPTPr), a transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase, is widely expressed by neurons {{in developing and}} mature mammalian brain, and functions as a receptor for chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans that inhibits axon regeneration following injury. In this study, we address RPTPr function in the mature brain. We demonstrate increased <b>axon</b> <b>collateral</b> branching in the hippocampus of RPTPr null mice during normal aging or following chemically induced seizure, indicating that RPTPr maintains neural circuitry by inhibiting axonal branching. Previous studies demonstrated a role for pre-synaptic RPTPr promoting synaptic differentiation during development; however, subcellular fractionation revealed enrichment of RPTPr in post-synaptic densities. We report that neurons lacking RPTPr have an increased density of pre-synaptic varicosities in vitro and increased dendritic spine density and length in vivo. RPTPr knockouts exhibit an increased frequency of miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents, and greater paired-pulse facilitation, consistent with increased synapse density but reduced synaptic efficiency. Furthermore, RPTPr nulls exhibit reduced long-term potentiation and enhanced novel object recognition memory. We conclude that RPTPr limits synapse number and regulates synapse structure and function in the mature CNS...|$|R

Stereological cell counting indicated that there were 2700 EGFP–TH neurons/striatum. Whole-cell recordings in striatal slices demonstrated that EGFP–TH neurons comprise four electrophysiologically distinct neuron types whose electrophysiological properties have not been reported previously in striatum. EGFP–THneuronswere identified in retrograde tracing studies as interneurons. Recordings from synaptically connected pairs of EGFP–TH interneurons and spiny neurons showed that the interneurons elicited GABAergic IPSPs/IPSCs in spiny neurons powerful enough to significantly delay evoked spiking. EGFP–TH interneurons responded to local or cortical stimulation with glutamatergic EPSPs. Local stimulation also elicited GABAA IPSPs, {{at least some of}} which arose from identified spiny neurons. Single-cell reverse transcription-PCR showed expression of VMAT 1 in EGFP–TH interneurons, consistent with previous suggestions that these interneurons may be dopaminergic as well as GABAergic. All four classes of interneuronsweremedium sizedwithmodestly branching, varicose dendrites, and dense, highly varicose <b>axon</b> <b>collateral</b> fields.

40|$|Intrinsic {{horizontal}} <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> in the {{striate cortex}} of adult cats specifically link columns {{having the same}} preferred orientation; consequently, retrograde tracer injections result in intrinsic labeling that is sharply clustered. We have previously shown that the normal development of this circuitry involves the emergence of crude clusters from an unclustered pattern during the second postnatal week. Crude clusters are later refined to the adult level of specificity by the selective rearrangement of axonal arbors that initially project to incorrect orientation columns. Here we report that depriving animals of patterned visual experience by binocular lid suture prior to natural eye opening had no discernible effect on the emergence of crude clusters. In contrast, cluster refinement was dramatically affected by binocular deprivation. Injections of retrograde tracers in the striate cortex of animals binocularly deprived for greater than 1 month revealed only crude clusters, indicating that horizontal <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> projecting to incorrect orientation columns were retained well past the age when they normally would have been eliminated. Layer 2 / 3 pyramidal cells from 6 -week-old binocularly deprived animals had abnormal distributions of intrinsic horizontal <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> that mirrored the lack of cluster refinement. The radial clustering of their horizontal collaterals was considerably less precise than normal. These cells, nevertheless, developed many {{of the features of}} normal mature arbors, including the distal axonal branches not seen in arbors from younger animals with normal visual experience. Together, these results indicate that axonal rearrangements occurred, but with reduced specificity. Thus, binocular deprivation did not simply arrest the development of this orientation-specific circuit at an immature state but limited the accuracy with which <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> were added or eliminated. We suggest that development of this orientation-specific circuitry, like ocular dominance column segregation, may depend on temporal correlation of activity for regulation of axonal rearrangement. The specificity of rearrangement may be degraded in binocularly deprived cats because they do not experience sharply oriented visual stimuli necessary for concurrent activation of same-orientation columns...|$|E
40|$|Most neurons in the neostriatum are GABAergic spiny {{projection}} neurons {{with extensive}} local <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> innervating principally other spiny projection neurons. The other source of GABAergic inputs to spiny neurons derives {{from a small}} number of interneurons, of which the best characterized are the parvalbumin-containing, fast-spiking interneurons. Spiny neuron collateral inhibition was not demonstrated until recently, because the IPSPs recorded at the soma are surprisingly small. In contrast, interneuronal inhibition was readily detected, comprising much larger IPSPs. Here, we report the application of quantal analysis and compartmental modeling to compare and contrast IPSCs in spiny neurons originating from <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals</b> and interneurons. The results indicate that individual release sites at spiny and interneuron synapses have similar quantal sizes and baseline release probabilities. Interneuronal unitary IPSCs are several times larger because of their proximal location on the neuron and because they have a larger number of transmitter release sites. Despite the small amount of current they can deliver to the soma, spiny cell collateral synapses had moderately high baseline release probabilities (0. 5 – 0. 9), suggesting that they are not weak because of some form of depression or modulation. The size of unitary collateral synaptic currents increased monotonically during development. These results argue against models of competitive inhibition in neostriatum, including those in which competitive inhibition is transiently effective during development and learning, and suggest a different role for the spiny cell <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals.</b> Key words: IPSC; basal ganglia; interneuron; quantal analysis; development; GABA; inhibitio...|$|E

Genetic and biochemical data support a model in which direct binding of Slit to Dscam 1 enhances the interaction of Dscam 1 with RPTP 69 D, stimulating Dscam 1 dephosphorylation. Single-growth-cone imaging reveals that Slit/RPTP 69 D are not required for general branch initiation but instead promote the extension of specific <b>axon</b> <b>collaterals.</b> Hence, although regulation of intrinsic Dscam 1 -Dscam 1 isoform interactions is essential for formation of all mechanosensory-axon branches, the local ligand-induced alterations of Dscam 1 phosphorylation in distinct growth-cone compartments enable the spatial specificity of axon collateral formation. status: publishe...|$|E

Neuregulin- 1 (Nrg 1) is a neurotrophic factor essential for the development and maintenance of neuromuscular junctions, and Nrg 1 receptor ErbB 4 loss-of-function mutations have been reported as causative for ALS. Our main goal {{was to investigate the}} role of Nrg 1 type I (Nrg 1 -I) in SOD 1 G 93 A mice muscles. We overexpressed Nrg 1 -I by means of an adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector, and investigated its effect by means of neurophysiological techniques assessing neuromuscular function, as well as molecular approaches (RT-PCR, western blot, immunohistochemistry, ELISA) to determine the mechanisms underlying Nrg 1 -I action. AAV-Nrg 1 -I intramuscular administration promoted motor <b>axon</b> <b>collateral</b> sprouting by acting on terminal Schwann cells, preventing denervation of the injected muscles through Akt and ERK 1 / 2 pathways. We further used a model of muscle partial denervation by transecting the L 4 spinal nerve. AAV-Nrg 1 -I intramuscular injection enhanced muscle reinnervation by collateral sprouting, whereas administration of lapatinib (ErbB receptor inhibitor) completely blocked it. We demonstrated that Nrg 1 -I plays {{a crucial role in the}} collateral reinnervation process, opening a new window for developing novel ALS therapies for functional recovery rather than preservation...|$|R
40|$|Motor, sensory, and {{autonomic}} functions can spontaneously return or {{recover to}} varying extents in both humans and animals, {{regardless of the}} traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) level and whether it was complete or incomplete. In parallel, adverse and painful functions can appear. The underlying mechanisms {{for all of these}} diverse functional changes are summarized under the term plasticity. Our review will describe what is known regarding this phenomenon after traumatic SCI and focus on its relevance to motor and sensory recovery. Although it is still somewhat speculative, plasticity can be found throughout the neuraxis and includes various changes ranging from alterations in the properties of spared neuronal circuitries, intact or lesioned <b>axon</b> <b>collateral</b> sprouting, and synaptic rearrangements. Furthermore, we will discuss a selection of potential approaches for facilitating plasticity as possible SCI treatments. Because a mechanism underlying spontaneous plasticity and recovery might be motor activity and the related neuronal activity, activity-based therapies are being used and investigated both clinically and experimentally. Additional pharmacological and gene-delivery approaches, based on plasticity being dependent on the delicate balance between growth inhibition and promotion as well as the basic intrinsic growth ability of the neurons themselves, {{have been found to be}} effective alone and in combination with activity-based therapies. The positive results have to be tempered with the reality that not all plasticity is beneficial. Therefore, a tremendous number of questions still need to be addressed. Ultimately, answers to these questions will enhance plasticity’s potential for improving the quality of life for persons with SCI...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that GABAergic synaptic transmission among neostriatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) is strongly modulated by dopamine with individual connections exhibiting either D 1 receptor (D 1 R) -mediated facilitation or D 2 receptor (D 2 R) -mediated inhibition and, at least in some preparations, a subset of connections exhibiting both of these effects. In light of the cell type-specific expression of D 1 aR in striatonigral andD 2 R in striatopallidal neurons and the differential expression of the other D 1 andD 2 family dopamine receptors, we hypothesize that the nature of the dopaminergic modulation is specific to the types of SPNs that partici-pate in the connection. Here the biophysical properties and dopaminergicmodulation of intrastriatal connections formed by striatopal-lidal neurons were examined. Contrary to previous expectation, synapses formed by striatopallidal neurons were biophysically and pharmacologically heterogeneous. Two distinct types of <b>axon</b> <b>collateral</b> connections could be distinguished among striatopallidal neu-rons. The more common, small-amplitude connections (80 %) exhibited mean IPSC amplitudes several times smaller than their less frequent large-amplitude counterparts, principally because of a smaller number of release sites involved. The two types of connections were also differentially regulated by dopamine. Small-amplitude connections exhibited strong and exclusively D 2 R-mediated presynap-tic inhibition,whereas large-amplitude connectionswereunresponsive todopamine. Synaptic connections fromstriatopallidal to striatonigral neurons exhibited exclusivelyD 2 R-mediated presynaptic inhibition thatwas similar to the regulation of small-amplitude connections between pairs of striatopallidal cells. Together, these findings demonstrate a previously unrecognized complexity in the organization anddopaminergic control of synaptic communication among SPNs...|$|R
