5|$|The fatwa {{reaffirmed the}} {{obligation}} of Spanish Muslims to perform the ritual prayers (salat), the ritual charity (zakat), and the ritual <b>ablution</b> (ghusl), {{even if they could}} not be performed in the correct form. It described {{the obligation of}} the ritual prayersnormally performed by standing, bowing, prostrating, and sitting in a prescribed sequenceeven if done only by making slight movements. The fatwa also allowed the omission of the prayersnormally performed an obligatory five times a day at prescribed timeswhen they were prevented from doing so, and instructed them to make up the missed prayers at night instead. It also provided instructions for performing the ritual dry <b>ablution</b> (tayammum) when ritually pure water was not available, to replace the ritual <b>ablution</b> (wudu) that is ordinarily required before performing the salat. When tayammum was not possible, even making slight pointing motions with hands or face toward clean earth, stone, or tree was acceptable.|$|E
5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{is built}} into the rear wall, on the forts southern side. This room is set into the end of the rampart and was used to prepare gunpowder charges. A guardhouse was built at the manning parade's southern end in 1885. It is now used as a duty room for the drill squad during recreation demonstrations but originally was a guard's room and separate cells connected by telephone to Fort Largs. Up to three men appear to have been accommodated in the guard's room. When the fort was converted to use as a caravan park the guard house was converted to an <b>ablution</b> block. A store and <b>ablution</b> block were also built in 1885 between the stockade and rear defence wall.|$|E
5|$|The Fountain of Qasim Pasha, {{built by}} the Ottomans in 1526 and located north of the mosque on the {{platform}} of the Dome of the Rock, was used by worshipers for <b>ablution</b> and for drinking until the 1940s. Today, it stands as a monumental structure.|$|E
50|$|In the Bahá'í Faith, ritual <b>ablutions</b> (the washing of {{the hands}} and face) should be done before the saying of the {{obligatory}} prayers, as well as prior to the recitation of the Greatest Name 95 times. Menstruating women are obliged to pray, but have the (voluntary) alternative of reciting a verse instead; if the latter choice is taken, <b>ablutions</b> are still required before the recital of the special verse.

5|$|On {{the west}} side of Kenongo Island is another one-storeyed {{circular}} structure that forms another artificial island in the past called Gumuling Well (Sumur Gumuling). These one-storeyed building can only be entered via the underwater tunnel. The building was used as a mosque. A niche in the wall of this building was used as a mihrab. The central area of this building is an elevated platform where four staircases meet, and then from the platform, one staircase reach the first floor. On the ground level of this platform is a small pool that was used for Muslim ritual <b>ablution.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Fakahani Mosque exemplifies this process. It {{was built}} in the Fatimid period, either as a {{suspended}} mosque (one with shops underneath it) or with a high basement. After the earthquake of 1302 it was rebuilt. In 1440 an <b>ablution</b> basin was added, and early in the Ottoman period a minaret was built. The amir Ahmad Katkhuda Mustahfazan al-Kharbutli in 1735 ordered a major reconstruction, almost all of the original building being replaced apart from two doors. These finely carved doors were registered as a historical monument in 1908 by the committee of conservation, and the building itself was registered in 1937.|$|E
5|$|The Oran fatwa was a responsum fatwa, or an Islamic legal opinion, {{issued in}} 1504 {{to address the}} crisis that {{occurred}} when Muslims in the Crown of Castile (now part of Spain) were forced to convert to Christianity in 15001502. The fatwa sets out detailed relaxations of the sharia (Islamic law) requirements, allowing the Muslims to conform outwardly to Christianity and perform acts that are ordinarily forbidden in Islamic law, when necessary to survive. It includes relaxed instructions for fulfilling the ritual prayers, the ritual charity, and the ritual <b>ablution,</b> and recommendations when obliged to violate Islamic law, such as worshipping as Christians, committing blasphemy, and consuming pork and wine.|$|E

5|$|The mosque's main <b>ablution</b> fountain, {{known as}} al-Kas ("the Cup"), is located {{north of the}} mosque {{between it and the}} Dome of the Rock. It is used by worshipers to perform wudu, a ritual washing of the hands, arms, legs, feet, and face before entry into the mosque. It was first built in 709 by the Umayyads, but in 1327–28 Governor Tankiz {{enlarged}} it to accommodate more worshipers. Although originally supplied with water from Solomon's Pools near Bethlehem, it currently receives water from pipes connected to Jerusalem's water supply. In the 20th-century, al-Kas was provided taps and stone seating.|$|E
5|$|An {{earthquake}} in 1302 caused damage to al-Azhar {{and a number}} of other mosques throughout Mamluk territory. The responsibility for reconstruction was split among the amirs (princes) of the Sultanate and the head of the army, Amir Salar, who was tasked with repairing the damage. These repairs were the first done since the reign of Baibars. Seven years later a dedicated school, the Madrasa al-Aqbaghawiyya, was built along the northwest wall of the mosque. Portions of the wall of the mosque were removed to accommodate the new building. Construction of another school, the Madrasa al-Taybarsiyya began in 1332–1333. This building, which was completed in 1339-1340, would also impact the structure of the mosque as it was built over the site of the mida'a, the fountain for <b>ablution.</b> Both of the madrasas were built as complementary buildings to al-Azhar, with separate entrances and prayer halls.|$|E
5|$|The major {{religious}} activities (or pujas) performed every morning are mahabhishek (<b>ablution),</b> abhishek, gitapath and bhagavat puja, {{while in the}} evening the pujas include geet govinda and aarti. Recital in vedic scripts like Ashtotram and Sahasranama is practiced during all the rituals. After aarti, the decorations are removed from the image of Badrinath and sandalwood paste is applied to it. The paste from the image {{is given to the}} devotees the next day as prasad during the nirmalaya darshan. All the rituals are performed in front of the devotees, unlike those in some Hindu temples, where some practices are hidden from them. Sugar balls and dry leaves are the common prasad provided to the devotees. From May 2006, the practise of offering Panchamrit Prasad, prepared locally and packed in local bamboo baskets, was started.|$|E
