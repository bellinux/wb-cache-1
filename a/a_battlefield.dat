5|$|After brief {{footage of}} a tank driving across a desert {{landscape}} {{a baby is}} shown playing with a paper aeroplane. A hat {{is placed on the}} baby's head and the head is then removed and fitted onto the body of a bomber pilot. The next scene shows a fleet of bombers bombing a city while an anti-aircraft gunner fires at them and troops parachute down. A soldier is seen running across a bombed out city before two opposing troops are shown repeatably stabbing each other with bayonets on <b>a</b> <b>battlefield</b> landscape filled with human skulls.

5|$|Charlton {{arrived at}} C Company of the regiment's 1st Battalion in early 1951, {{and at first}} was {{regarded}} with suspicion by officers and leaders in his unit. A Sergeant, he was made a squad leader in the 3rd Platoon, and quickly impressed his unit's company commander with his natural leadership ability, and soon his squad was considered a model unit. In May 1951, Charlton was made the platoon sergeant and his commander had recommended him for <b>a</b> <b>battlefield</b> commission.|$|E

5|$|John Sadler has {{described}} this expedition as 'like {{so many of}} its predecessors, fail to yield any significant results,' neither forcing the Scots onto <b>a</b> <b>battlefield</b> nor making any major territorial gains. Brown too {{has described}} the campaign as 'utterly futile.' Sadler has ascribed the Scottish success in part to their reliance on a Fabian strategy to wear out the English whilst avoiding direct confrontation. Henry's lacklustre campaign was condemned by contemporary observers, with Welsh chronicler Adam of Usk saying that the Scots did more damage to the English than {{had been done to}} them. Likewise, the Scotichronicon suggested that 'nothing worthy of remembrance was done' by their enemies.|$|E
5|$|On April 2, 1972, the Easter Offensive, {{the largest}} {{combined}} arms {{operation of the}} entire Vietnam War, was in its third day. An early morning flight of two United States Air Force EB-66 aircraft was led by Bat 20, piloted by Lt. Col. Robert Singletary. Hambleton was a navigator aboard Bat 21. The two aircraft were escorting a cell of three B-52s. Bat 21 was configured to gather signals intelligence, including identifying North Vietnamese anti-aircraft radar installations to enable jamming. Bat 21 was destroyed by an SA-2 surface-to-air missile and Hambleton was the only survivor, parachuting behind the front lines into <b>a</b> <b>battlefield</b> filled with thousands of North Vietnamese Army soldiers.|$|E

On 8 November 2013, Marines B and C were acquitted, but Marine A was initially {{found guilty of}} murder of the Afghan combatant, in contravention of section 42 of the Armed Forces Act 2006.

5|$|The Battle of Vimy Ridge was {{the first}} {{occasion}} on which all four divisions of the Canadian Expeditionary Force participated in a battle as a cohesive formation, {{and it became a}} Canadian national symbol of achievement and sacrifice. France ceded to Canada perpetual use of a portion of land on Vimy Ridge on the understanding that Canada use the land to establish <b>a</b> <b>battlefield</b> park and memorial. Wartime tunnels, trenches, craters, and unexploded munitions still honeycomb the grounds of the site, which remains largely closed off for reasons of public safety. Along with preserved trench lines, several other memorials and cemeteries are contained within the park.|$|E
5|$|The {{acquisition}} of the Hunter had solved part of the Swiss dilemma of needing to support both its ground forces and to deploy an air-to-air capability, but while the Hunter could provide some counter-air defense over <b>a</b> <b>battlefield</b> and escort ground-support fighters it was not supersonic nor was it capable of defending Swiss airspace. In 1961, the Swiss Parliament voted to procure 100French Dassault Mirage IIICs for this purpose and 67BL-64 Bloodhound surface-to-air missiles from the British.|$|E
5|$|The flame fougasse has {{remained}} in army field manuals as <b>a</b> <b>battlefield</b> expedient {{to the present}} day. Such weapons are improvised from available fuel containers combined with standard explosive charges or hand grenades and are triggered electrically or by lengths of detonating cord. In some designs, detonating cord is used to rupture the container immediately before triggering the propelling charge. In order to guarantee ignition, the improvised devices frequently feature two explosive charges, one to throw {{and the other to}} ignite the fuel. Weapons of this sort were widely used in the Korean and Vietnam Wars as well as other conflicts.|$|E

While defending the human race and its alien Vasudan allies, the player also gets involved in putting down a rebellion. The game features large numbers of fighters alongside gigantic capital ships in <b>a</b> <b>battlefield</b> fraught with beams, shells and missiles in detailed star systems and nebulae. Free multiplayer games were available via Parallax Online which also ranked players by their statistics. A persistent galaxy was also available as SquadWar for players to fight with each other over territories.|$|E
5|$|The precise {{role and}} {{contribution}} of war chariots in battlefield {{is a matter}} of dispute {{due to the lack of}} sufficient evidence. In general, it appears that during the first centuries (16th–14th century BC) chariots were used as a fighting vehicle while later in the 13th century BC their role was limited to <b>a</b> <b>battlefield</b> transport. Horse-mounted warriors were also part of the Mycenaean armies, however their precise role isn't clear due to lack of archaeological data.|$|E
5|$|When Sir Walter Scott visited Dunvegan Castle in 1814, {{he learned}} of several {{traditional}} tales relating to the area and the clan.

5|$|Although {{capable of}} {{generating}} a high volume of fire, autocannon {{are limited by}} the amount of ammunition that can be carried by the weapons systems mounting them. For this reason, both the 25mm Bushmaster and the 30mm RARDEN are deliberately designed with relatively slow rates of fire, to extend the amount of time they can be employed on <b>a</b> <b>battlefield</b> before requiring a resupply of ammunition. The rate of fire of modern autocannon ranges from 90 rounds per minute, to 1,800 rounds per minute. Systems with multiple barrels—Gatling guns—can have rates of fire of several thousand rounds per minute; the fastest of these is the GSh-6-30K, which has a rate of fire of over 6,000rounds per minute.|$|E
5|$|Defrance had an {{extensive}} and successful military {{career in the}} French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. After the First Battle of Zurich, he refused <b>a</b> <b>battlefield</b> promotion to brigadier general, asking instead for a cavalry regiment; he received command of the 12th Regiment of Chasseurs-a-Cheval (light cavalry) as Chef-de-Brigade, a rank equivalent to colonel. He led this brigade in the campaigns of 17991800 in southwestern Germany and northern Italy. By 1805, he had been promoted to brigadier general. At the Battle of Austerlitz and the Battle of Jena-Auerstadt, he commanded a cavalry brigade of carabiniers in Étienne Marie Antoine Champion de Nansouty's First Division. By the Battle of Borodino in September 1812, he had been promoted to general of division, commanding the 4th Cuirassier Division of Nansouty's reserves, where they charged the Shevardino redoubt. He fought his way across Germany to the Rhine River after the French loss at Leipzig and participated in the Six Days Campaign.|$|E
