25|$|In 1880, in a Harper and {{brothers}} review, it was said:-"Sedgwick has marked individuality; she writes {{with a higher}} aim than merely to amuse. Indeed, the rare endowments of her mind depend in an unusual degree upon the moral qualities {{with which they are}} united for their value. Animated by a cheerful philosophy, and anxious to pour its sunshine into every place where there is lurking care or suffering, she selects for illustration the scenes of everyday experience, paints them with exact fidelity, and seeks to diffuse over the mind <b>a</b> <b>delicious</b> serenity, and in the heart kind feelings and sympathies, and wise ambition and steady hope. Her style is colloquial, picturesque, and marked by a facile grace which is evidently a gift of nature. Her characters are nicely drawn and delicately contrasted, her delineation of manners decidedly the best that has appeared.|$|E

Instead of using the money to return to Paris and her lost lifestyle, she decides to spend it preparing <b>a</b> <b>delicious</b> dinner for the sisters and their small congregation {{on the occasion of the}} founding pastor's hundredth birthday.
