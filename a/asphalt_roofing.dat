40|$|CIVINSAs an {{approach}} to mitigate {{the harmful effects of}} Urban Heat Island (UHI), the use of glass cullet in the production of <b>asphalt</b> <b>roof</b> shingles {{has the potential to be}} employed as a cool roof strategy. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the use of recycled glass increases solar reflectance index (SRI) without affecting the performance of <b>asphalt</b> <b>roof</b> shingles. In order to evaluate the feasibility of recycled glass for alternative uses, the engineering properties of glass cullet were investigated and compared to conventional aggregates used in the production of <b>asphalt</b> <b>roof</b> shingles. Laboratory samples were then prepared in order to measure solar reflectance properties and strength performance of conventional and recycled glass roof shingles. It is shown that while the use of recycled glass as a replacement to standard ceramic coated black roofing granules on the top surface of asphalt shingles results in an increased SRI, the addition of white pigment powder (anatase ultra fine particles passing mesh # 320) mixed together and applied with the surface granules improves reflectance values to meet the cool roof threshold...|$|R

50|$|Asphalt {{concrete}} that {{is removed}} from a pavement is usually stockpiled for later use as aggregate for new hot mix asphalt at an asphalt plant. This reclaimed material, commonly known by the acronym 'RAP' for recycled or reclaimed asphalt pavement, is crushed to a consistent gradation and added to the HMA mixing process. Sometimes waste materials, such as <b>asphalt</b> <b>roofing</b> shingles, crushed glass, or rubber from old tires, are added to asphalt concrete {{as is the case}} with rubberized asphalt, but there is a concern that the hybrid material may not be recyclable.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} is {{cast in the}} Italianate style and was designed by Bradley and Son of Rockford, Illinois. The building's design {{was based on a}} sketch by Rochelle alderman Sam J. Parker. The two-story rectangular {{building is}} constructed from soft, red local bricks. All four elevations have decorative metal brackets and a brick entablature with dentils beneath the metal eaves. Each of the exterior corners of the building are adorned with white brick quoins. The City and Town Hall's original hip roof was metal, it has since been replaced with <b>asphalt</b> <b>roofing</b> materials.|$|E
50|$|Modified Bitumen - This type of roofing is an {{evolution}} of <b>asphalt</b> <b>roofing.</b> It {{is made from}} asphalt {{and a variety of}} rubber modifiers and solvents. There are several ways of connecting pieces of this material. In a heat application process the seams are heated to melt the asphalt together and create a seal. There is also hot-mopped application, similar to how conventional built-up roofs are installed. Cold-applied adhesives and self-adhesive membranes are two of the more recent options. This material is also referred to as APP, SBS, and SEBS.|$|E

It has three sections: a fellowship hall on the east, central bell tower and worship section on the west. They create a north (front) facade that starts with the three-bay gabled roof. Tall Gothic arched windows, the center one larger than those on the flanks, with bluestone sills and keystones, are centered in the first story, with a pair of smaller double-hung sash windows in the apex, set off by a brickwork course.|$|E
50|$|The {{operation}} grew {{over the}} years - by 1869, more than 26000 lb a year of mica was being extracted from the mine. The value of the mica mined at Ruggles {{was estimated to be}} about $12 million by the 1960s, by which time there were new applications for the mineral in cosmetics, cement block, <b>asphalt</b> <b>roofing,</b> and electrical insulators in appliances such as GE brand toasters. Beginning in 1912, mining began for feldspar, which was used as a nonabrasive scour in the production of china glazes. Later on beryl was also mined.|$|E
5000|$|Central City Roofing, Inc. was {{established}} in 1891 in the city. During 1894, the company was located at 231 North Crouse Avenue {{at the corner of}} Hawley Street. They specialized in <b>asphalt</b> <b>roofing,</b> gravel roofs, paving and flooring and advertised that their natural asphalt was the most durable material known for roofs, [...] "especially on buildings where the interior is filled with smoke, steam, hot air and gas." [...] The company had installed new roofs on [...] "dwellings, churches, stores, barns, sheds and factories." [...] They also claimed that their roof coating was fireproof.|$|E
50|$|The north facade has {{similarly}} asymmetrical fenestration, with a projecting bay. On {{the west is}} a sympathetic wing built in 1983 in conformance with National Park Service standards. It is also brick with a flat <b>asphalt</b> <b>roof,</b> and has a simple limestone cornice.|$|R
50|$|Asphalt BUR {{is made up}} of {{multiple}} layers of reinforcing plies and asphalt forming a redundancy of waterproofing layers. The reflectivity of built up roofs depends on the surfacing material used. Gravel is the most common and they are referred to as <b>asphalt</b> and gravel <b>roofs.</b> <b>Asphalt</b> degradation is a growing concern. UV-rays oxidize the surface of the asphalt and produce a chalk-like residue. As plasticizers leach out of the <b>asphalt,</b> <b>asphalt</b> built-up <b>roofs</b> become brittle. Cracking and alligatoring inevitably follows, allowing water to penetrate the system causing blisters, cracks and leaks. Compared to other systems, installation of <b>asphalt</b> <b>roofs</b> is energy-intensive (hot processes typically use LP gas as the heat source), and contributes to atmospheric air pollution (toxic, and green-house gases are lost from the asphalt during installation).|$|R
50|$|Ponding is the (typically) {{unwanted}} pooling of water, typically on a {{flat roof}} or roadway. Ponding water accelerates the deterioration of many materials, including seam adhesives in single-ply roof systems, steel equipment supports, and particularly <b>roofing</b> <b>asphalt.</b> On low-slope <b>asphalt</b> <b>roofs,</b> ponding water allows the oil solvent components of the asphalt to leach out and evaporate, leaving the roof membrane brittle and susceptible to cracking and leaking in the ponding location.|$|R

He was Mayor of Matawan, New Jersey from 1915 - 1916 and 1921 - 1926. He served on the United States-Mexico border in 1916 (see Pancho Villa Expedition) with B Troop, First Squadron, New Jersey Cavalry. During World War I he served in France from December 1917 to May 1919 and was discharged as captain in the Air Service. He was a factory representative for <b>asphalt</b> <b>roofing</b> from 1920 to 1931.|$|E
50|$|The 50193 sq ft {{structure}} was Neoclassical in style (although {{it has also}} been described as Romanesque Revival). The single-story {{structure was}} made of granite, with the interior and exterior clad in white Italian marble. The foundation was made of reinforced concrete, and the roof consisted of reinforced concrete ceiling, roof beams, and roof. The roof was externally clad in <b>asphalt</b> <b>roofing</b> materials. The entire structure was 19.5 ft from grade to rooftop. The floor was a 6 in marble base. Stained-glass windows by Tiffany & Co. provided light. There were 654 crypts, stacked six high below 16.3 ft high ceilings. Crypts included 60 niches for cremated remains. Interior light was provided by skylights.|$|E
5000|$|Roof {{cleaning}} is {{the process}} to remove algae mold, mildew, lichen and moss from roofs. Roof cleaning can extend the duration of a roof's ability to function. Algae {{and other types of}} build-up often form on the north and west parts of roofs that are shaded or receive less sun, and can reduce a roof's life expectancy. The presence of soot, dirt, or biomass can affect how much sunlight is absorbed by a roof and thus the amount of heat a building absorbs. [...] Cleaning may be accomplished with a sodium hypochlorite (a.k.a.bleach) or sodium percarbonate solution, various cleaning products or commercial cleaning services. The <b>Asphalt</b> <b>Roofing</b> Manufacturers Association (ARMA) recommends using a 50/50 solution of laundry grade bleach and water to remove moss and algae. The addition of zinc strips near the roof's peak may reduce the regrowth of algae and moss.|$|E

5000|$|Originally <b>asphalt</b> <b>roofing</b> {{required}} {{a layer of}} gravel above it for two reasons. First, asphalt with direct exposure to sunlight degrades much faster, mainly due to the expansion and contraction throughout a day, and also the damage created by UV rays. Secondly, asphalt needs weight above to hold it down, because it sits {{on the top of}} a building, instead of being attached to it. Each of the three newer types of membrane roofing systems contain materials that resist expansion and contraction, as well as reflect much of the UV rays. Also, because these membranes either lack seams or have strong seams, what expansion and contraction does occur does not create leaks and breaks at these seams. These newer roofing systems are also attached directly to the top of a building, which eliminates the need for excess weight above.|$|E
