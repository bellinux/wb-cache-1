25|$|On 29 April 2015, Surrey Police {{published}} a report stating that Savile had sexually assaulted 22 {{students and a}} visitor at the Duncroft <b>Approved</b> <b>School</b> for Girls in Staines-upon-Thames between 1974 and 1979. The report said that Savile had committed at least 46 offences at the school, including one {{which would have been}} classed as rape under current law.|$|E
25|$|Charles Sharpe (1889–1963) was a farmer's {{boy from}} Pickworth, near Bourne, who {{ran away from}} home and joined the army. In World War I he was awarded the Victoria Cross, Britain's highest {{decoration}} for valour, and he subsequently inspired many young men to enlist. On returning to civilian life, he worked as a physical training instructor to boys at the Hereward Camp <b>approved</b> <b>school.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tobin {{was born}} in Johnstone, Renfrewshire, one of eight {{siblings}} born to an Irish Catholic family. He had four older sisters and three older brothers. He reportedly joined the French Foreign Legion, but later deserted. He was a difficult child and in 1953, aged seven, {{he was sent to}} an <b>approved</b> <b>school.</b> He later served time in a young offender institution, and in 1970 was convicted and imprisoned in England for burglary and forgery.|$|E
50|$|<b>Approved</b> <b>schools</b> {{were split}} into three age groups: Junior, Intermediate and Senior. Most were for boys; {{there was a}} small number of {{separate}} <b>approved</b> <b>schools</b> for girls.|$|R
5000|$|The cane {{was also}} used more or less {{frequently}} on boy inmates at the British youth reformatories known from 1933 to 1970 as <b>Approved</b> <b>Schools,</b> and rarely for girls in such <b>schools.</b> In <b>Approved</b> <b>schools</b> the cane {{was applied to the}} buttocks for boys and to the hands for girls, but after <b>Approved</b> <b>Schools</b> became [...] "Community Homes with Education" [...] under the Children and Young Persons Act 1969, girls could be caned on the buttocks. Caning is still used in the equivalent institutions in some countries, such as Singapore and Guyana.|$|R
5000|$|The term {{came into}} general use in 1933 when <b>Approved</b> <b>Schools</b> were created {{out of the}} earlier [...] "industrial" [...] and earlier [...] "reformatory" [...] schools. [...] Following the Children and Young Persons Act 1969, they were {{replaced}} by Community Homes, with responsibility devolved to local councils; in Singapore, which by then was no longer under British rule, <b>Approved</b> <b>Schools</b> continued.|$|R
25|$|Bourne sent {{many men}} to both world wars, but was {{otherwise}} only lightly affected. During the Second World War a German bomber {{was shot down}} and crashed onto the Butcher's Arms public house in Eastgate. Nine people were killed, including the bomber's crew. In a separate incident, a number of bombs were dropped on the Hereward Camp <b>approved</b> <b>school,</b> a row of wooden huts adjacent to the woods {{that may have been}} mistaken for a military camp. Charles Richard Sharpe was injured in the second incident, but he was no stranger to fighting the Germans, having been awarded the Victoria Cross in the first conflict of the century.|$|E
25|$|The school {{opened in}} 1992, and {{represents}} the typical board {{school in the}} educational system of the era (the stone built single storey structure being inscribed with the foundation date of 1891, Beamish School Board), by which time attendance at a state <b>approved</b> <b>school</b> was compulsory, but the leaving age was 12, and lessons featured learning by rote and corporal punishment. The building originally stood in East Stanley, having been {{set up by the}} local school board, and would have numbered around 150 pupils. Having been donated by Durham County Council, the museum now has a special relationship with the primary school that replaced it. With separate entrances and cloakrooms for boys and girls at either end, the main building is split into three class rooms (all accessible to visitors), connected by a corridor along the rear. To the rear is a red brick bike shed, and in the playground visitors can play traditional games of the era.|$|E
25|$|Immediately after Savile's death, Meirion Jones and Liz Mackean {{from the}} BBC {{programme}} Newsnight began to investigate {{reports that he}} had sexually abused children. They interviewed one alleged victim on camera and talked {{to a number of}} others who were willing to be quoted about alleged abuse at Duncroft <b>Approved</b> <b>School</b> near London, the BBC, and Stoke Mandeville hospital. The headmistress of Duncroft was Meirion Jones's own aunt, Margaret Jones. The Newsnight team, which included former police detective Mark Williams-Thomas, also found out about the Surrey police investigation into Savile. The report was scheduled for broadcast on 7 December 2011, but a decision was taken to cancel its transmission, which ultimately developed into a major crisis for the BBC when the ITV documentary was screened in October 2012. The subsequent Pollard Review found that Jones and MacKean assembled cogent evidence that Savile had a history of abusing young women and Newsnight {{was in a position to}} break the story in 2011. No mention of the dropped Newsnight report was made in public at the time.|$|E

50|$|Best {{estimates}} suggest that, at the peak, {{there were}} 224 certified industrial schools in England and 50 in Scotland. There were others operating without certification or when certification had been removed. Name changing was common. Directly after World War I, one hundred closed and in 1933 {{there were only}} 55. They agreed to change their names to <b>approved</b> <b>schools</b> in 1927 and the <b>Approved</b> <b>Schools</b> Act of 1933 merged them to form a single system.|$|R

500|$|The school's uniform {{up to the}} end of Fifth Form is a white shirt, dark {{or light}} grey {{trousers}} and a single-breasted navy blue school blazer. A grey or dark blue, v-neck pullover with or without sleeves may also be worn. For the lower and upper sixth, navy blue or grey suits are instead worn, and upper sixth formers are permitted to wear pastel shaded shirts. A woollen scarf in the school colours: green, red and white; the sixth form scarf has longitudinal stripes. [...] All years are required to wear one of the <b>approved</b> <b>school</b> ties. Various ties are awarded for sporting, artistic or social achievements, along with half and full colours awarded for services to the school and house colours awarded for services to the house; Senior Prefect ties are awarded to those with the position. Recently there have also been commemorative ties celebrating 450 years since the granting of the Royal Charter, and 500 years since the founding of the school.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2013, the {{transcript}} of a Surrey Police interview with Savile in 2009 was published after a request under the Freedom of information Act. Savile denied the sexual abuse allegations relating to the Duncroft <b>Approved</b> <b>School</b> in the 1970s which were put {{to him by the}} police, saying [...] "I've never, ever done anything wrong" [...] and stating that the accusers wanted a [...] "few quid".|$|E
2500|$|The Peper Harow {{therapeutic}} community {{was set up}} by Melvyn Rose who had been a house master at the <b>approved</b> <b>school,</b> Park House, that pre-dated the Peper Harow Community. Rose understood that the difficult and sometimes violent behaviour of the young residents at Peper Harow reflected their personal pain and distress. All young people were assigned a personal mentor who developed very close relationships with the children in their care. In keeping with the interest in eastern philosophy at the time these were, rather quaintly, known as [...] "Gurus".|$|E

5000|$|<b>Approved</b> <b>Schools</b> were {{residential}} {{institutions to}} which young {{people could be}} sent by a court, usually for committing offences but sometimes because they were deemed to be beyond parental control. The term came into use following the 1933 Children and Young Persons Act when <b>Approved</b> <b>Schools</b> were created out of the earlier [...] "industrial" [...] or [...] "reformatory" [...] schools. They were essentially [...] "open" [...] institutions, modelled on ordinary boarding schools, from which it was relatively easy to abscond.|$|R

2500|$|In 2007, Savile {{was interviewed}} under caution by police {{investigating}} an allegation of indecent assault at the now-closed Duncroft <b>Approved</b> <b>School</b> for Girls near Staines in the 1970s {{when he was}} a regular visitor. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) advised there was insufficient evidence to take any further action and no charges were brought. In 2012 it was reported that staff at the school had not been questioned about the allegations at the time. The former headmistress of the school said she had been [...] "hoodwinked" [...] by Savile, but described some of those who had brought the allegations as [...] "delinquents".|$|E
2500|$|In October 2012, it was {{reported}} that the Sunday Mirror had decided not to publish allegations of sexual abuse at a children's home by two women against Savile. Paul Connew, who was the newspaper's editor when the women came forward in 1994, described the allegations as [...] "credible and convincing", but said that lawyers had advised against publication. In July 2013, Connew said that he believed that the newspaper would have lost a libel action over the allegations, as the two women, who had been pupils at Duncroft <b>Approved</b> <b>School,</b> {{did not want to be}} named. He also expressed concern that a jury would have been [...] "starstruck" [...] by Savile.|$|E
2500|$|Immediately after Savile's death, the BBC's Newsnight {{programme}} {{began an}} investigation into reports {{that he was a}} sexual abuser. Meirion Jones and Liz MacKean interviewed one victim on camera and others agreed to have their stories told. The interviewees alleged abuse at Duncroft <b>approved</b> <b>school</b> for girls in Staines, Stoke Mandeville Hospital and the BBC. The item was scheduled for broadcast in Newsnight on 7 December 2011, but was never shown and the BBC broadcast tributes to Savile at Christmas 2011. Newsnight also discovered that Surrey Police had investigated allegations of abuse against Savile. In December 2012, a review of the BBC's handling of the issue by Nick Pollard was published, describing the decision not to broadcast the Newsnight investigation as [...] "flawed". The review said that Jones and MacKean had found [...] "cogent evidence" [...] that Savile was an abuser. George Entwistle, who had been told about the plan to broadcast the Newsnight item, was described by the review as [...] "unnecessarily cautious, and an opportunity was lost".|$|E

50|$|Offenders sent to <b>approved</b> <b>schools,</b> {{as well as}} {{receiving}} academic tuition, {{were assigned}} to work groups for such activities as building and bricklaying, metalwork, carpentry and gardening. Many <b>approved</b> <b>schools</b> were known for strict discipline, with corporal punishment used where necessary, generally a rather more severe version of the caning or strapping that was common in ordinary secondary schools. In particular, boys who absconded were usually given a maximum caning immediately on being returned to the school, and a 1971 statistical study found {{that this could be}} an effective deterrent.|$|R

2500|$|In 2007, Savile {{was interviewed}} under caution by police {{investigating}} an allegation of indecent assault in the 1970s at the now-closed Duncroft <b>Approved</b> <b>School</b> for Girls near Staines, Surrey, {{where he was}} a regular visitor. The Crown Prosecution Service advised there was insufficient evidence to take any further action and no charges were brought. In March 2008, Savile started legal proceedings against The Sun, which had linked him in several articles to child abuse at the Jersey children's home Haut de la Garenne. He denied visiting Haut de la Garenne, but later admitted he had done so following the publication of a photograph showing him at the home surrounded by children. The States of Jersey Police said that in 2008 an allegation of an indecent assault by Savile at the home in the 1970s had been investigated, but there had been insufficient evidence to proceed. In 2009 in a taped interview with his biographer, Savile defended pop star Gary Glitter, who was convicted in 1999 of possession of child pornography, whom he described as a celebrity being vilified for watching [...] "dodgy films": [...] "It were for his own gratification. Whether it was right or wrong is up to him as a person... they [...] didn't do anything wrong but they are then demonised." [...] This was not published at the time, and the recording was not released until after Savile's death.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the field}} of penal administration, Morrison {{discontinued}} hard labour, while various measures designed to tackle child problems (such as juvenile wrongdoing) were carried out. The re-war accommodation in Remand Homes was doubled {{by the addition of}} 1,000 places, while 3,000 additional places were provided in <b>Approved</b> <b>Schools.</b> In <b>Approved</b> <b>Schools,</b> appointed Welfare Officers were introduced to maintain contact with the boys and girls as they left the schools, while the [...] "classifying schools" [...] reform was carried out to ensure that the <b>Approved</b> <b>Schools</b> to which boys and girls were sent to ones which were suited to their needs. A committee was also established by Morrison (in consultation with the Ministers and Education and Health) to inquire into the question of provision made for the care of children deprived of normal home life, while the inspectorate was increased in order that additional attention could be given to Remand Homes and voluntary homes. In addition, a Departmental Committee was established to review [...] "the question of the salaries and conditions of employment of staff employed both in <b>Approved</b> <b>Schools</b> and in Remand Homes." [...] In addition, under a decision announced by the Home Office and the Scottish Office in March 1943, the provision of the Adoption of Children (Regulation) Act of 1939 (which had been postponed due to the outbreak of the war) was brought into operation, forbidding [...] "any body of persons, other than a local authority or registered adoption society, to make arrangements for the adoption of a child." ...|$|R
