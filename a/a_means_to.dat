This time, rather than being intended as <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> boost competitiveness, some states, especially Japan and the Eurozone, may be motivated to devalue their currencies as <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> counter the threat of deflation. ECB President Mario Draghi has however denied any intent to engage in competitive devaluation.|$|E
5|$|A {{clinical}} exam {{is often}} used as <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> diagnose CSF leaks. Improved patient response to conservative treatment may further define a positive diagnosis. The lack of clinician awareness of the signs -symptoms and ailments- of a CSF leak is the greatest challenge to proper diagnosis and treatment, in particular: {{the loss of the}} orthostatic characteristic of headache and that every chronic CSF leaker will have a unique symptom set that as a whole contributes to the underlying condition, and diagnosis of, a CSF leak.|$|E
5|$|A {{video game}} {{walkthrough}} is a guide aimed towards improving a player's skill {{within a particular}} video game and often designed to assist players in completing either an entire video game or specific elements.

Walkthroughs may be considered guides on helping to enhance the experience of players, to assist towards unlocking game achievements or simply as <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> socialise with like-minded individuals as a distraction from everyday life.|$|E

5|$|Kant {{argued that}} {{rational}} beings {{can never be}} treated merely as means to ends; they must always also be treated as ends themselves, requiring that their own reasoned motives must be equally respected. This derives from Kant's claim that reason motivates morality: it demands that we respect reason as a motive in all beings, including other people. A rational being cannot rationally consent to being used merely as <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> an end, so they must always be treated as an end. Kant justified this by arguing that moral obligation is a rational necessity: that which is rationally willed is morally right. Because all rational agents rationally will themselves to be an end and never merely a means, it is morally obligatory that they are treated as such. This {{does not mean that}} we can never treat a human as <b>a</b> <b>means</b> <b>to</b> an end, but that when we do, we also treat him as an end in himself.|$|E
