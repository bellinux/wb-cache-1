5|$|Sometime I {{have thought}} that {{impossible}} it had been, so to have removed my affection {{from the realm of}} Scotland, that any realm or nation could have been equal dear to me. But God I take to record in my conscience, that the troubles present (and <b>appearing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be)</b> in the realm of England are double more dolorous unto my heart than ever were the troubles of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|To {{capture the}} straight-on {{shot of the}} shower head, the camera had to be {{equipped}} with a long lens. The inner holes on the shower head were blocked and the camera placed a sufficient distance away so that the water, while <b>appearing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> aimed directly at the lens, actually went around and past it.|$|E
5|$|In 1066, {{the comet}} {{was seen in}} England and thought to be an omen: later that year Harold II of England died at the Battle of Hastings; {{it was a bad}} omen for Harold, but a good omen for the man who {{defeated}} him, William the Conqueror. The comet is represented on the Bayeux Tapestry and described in the tituli as a star. Surviving accounts from the period describe it as <b>appearing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> four times the size of Venus and shining with a light equal to a quarter of that of the Moon. Halley came within 0.10AU of Earth at that time.|$|E
25|$|There <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a {{trend in}} {{ransomware}} being used to attack hospitals and it <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> growing.|$|R

5|$|The book's {{criticism}} of Eddy is considerable. She {{is portrayed as}} greedy, uneducated and deceitful, someone who regularly revised her life story and was interested only in making money. The authors produce witness statements from Eddy's childhood alleging that she engaged in repeated fainting spells to gain attention or avoid punishment, particularly from her father, and that, as an adult, she developed a habit of <b>appearing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> seriously ill only to recover quickly.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} in {{development}} for {{one and a}} half years, and involved the work of several divisions, being Kenji Sawaguchi and Tetsuji Yamamoto the total director and producer respectively. The programming was done by Exact, known for the Jumping Flash! series. Ghost in the Shell was designed and targeted to a mature audience; developers did not make Motoko playable to prevent the game <b>appearing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a character-based game for children. The original manga's creator Masamune Shirow was the main designer of the characters and mecha for the game.|$|E
5|$|Though {{outwardly}} <b>appearing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a well-intentioned {{public servant}} and supporter of democracy prior to becoming Emperor, {{he is actually}} Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith – a cult of practitioners of {{the dark side of}} the Force previously thought to have been extinct in the Star Wars galaxy for a millennium. As Sidious, he instigates the Clone Wars, nearly destroys the Jedi, and transforms the Republic into the Empire. He also manipulates Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker into turning to the dark side and serving at his side as Darth Vader. Palpatine's reign is brought to an end when Vader kills him to save his son, Luke Skywalker.|$|E
5000|$|Today, site [...] "A" [...] <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> largely intact, {{the owner}} has the {{facility}} for sale.

Site [...] "C" [...] <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a scrap site, filled with clutter; its underground facilities apparently are flooded by groundwater.|$|R

5|$|Pam apologizes to Jim that Roy {{attacked}} him but her assurance that {{her relationship with}} Roy is over for good is met with polite skepticism. Roy picks up his last paycheck, apologizes to Jim for threatening him during their previous encounter, and asks Pam to join him for coffee. Their meeting at a local diner is awkward and ends with their relationship (and even friendship) <b>appearing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> over; they hug and Pam wipes a tear from her face. Roy encourages Pam to pursue her feelings for Jim {{but she says she}} will not try to get him. Roy does not understand his long-time fiancée, especially her choice to not pursue Jim.|$|E
5|$|Takamatsu is {{an honor}} student who has a polite {{personality}} and wears glasses. He mainly contributes to the SSS through intelligence gathering and other affairs but does not actively fight. Yuri herself says to not be fooled by his glasses {{and that he is}} actually an idiot. Though <b>appearing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> slender, he works out and is actually well-built muscle-wise. After he first reveals this, he tends to take his shirt off, much to everyone's discomfort. He is absorbed by a shadow and is turned into an NPC. However, having strong enough feelings (according to Yuri), he is able to regain his senses and manages to disappear like the others. He carries a Desert Eagle as a side-arm, but is also seen using a Sig 552.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{previous}} {{games in}} the series, Lara has a stamina meter which depletes while she is performing bouts of climbing: if the bar empties before reaching her destination, she falls. The {{rate at which the}} meter decrease slows if the player performs special actions that increase Lara's strength. These actions are also necessary to progress in many of the levels. The game incorporates elements similar to a role-playing game, whereby Lara can talk with various NPCs found throughout the environments and choose what kinds of answers to give: early in the game, these answers will directly affect her progress through the story. The game also features a second playable character, Kurtis Trent. Initially <b>appearing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an antagonist, he becomes controllable by the player late in the game. He features mainly identical moves to Lara, and his sections of the game are more based around combat.|$|E
5000|$|Enslin's {{problems}} with Room 1408 begin {{before he even}} sets foot through the door; in fact, the door itself initially <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> crooked <b>to</b> the left. He looks again and the door <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> straight - then he looks again, and it <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> crooked, now <b>to</b> the right.|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of Mrs. Caspar Behrendt, [s. d. ]. Mrs. Behrendt is pictured in what <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a seated postion {{with her hands}} on her lap. She is a stout woman, dressed in a darkly-colored dress made of what <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> silk or satin. Her face is round and plump. Her salt-and-pepper hair <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> pulled back into a bun. Her body faces slightly skewed to the left. She <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in her mid- to late forties...|$|R
50|$|The other Atlas-D {{sites for}} the 565th SMS are all intact, sites A and C <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unused {{although}} both are in private hands. Site B has large numbers of abandoned vehicles on it, although again, all of the facilities <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> still intact. The Atlas-E sites <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> intact, all in private hands, and other than being overgrown, <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> left <b>to</b> the elements and time since 1965.|$|R
5|$|Precautions {{were taken}} to prevent secrets from the season finale being revealed; only certain staff members were {{provided}} with copies of the episode, which were given on watermarked DVDs and distributed to secret hiding places. The writers wanted Michael {{to have a big}} plan to get Holly back, but to realize throughout {{the course of the day}} that his relationship with Holly was something special and that he did not want to disrupt it; they felt it showed that Michael had become more mature, calm and confident about this relationship than that of Jan Levinson and others in his past. The first scene with Michael and Holly discussing their sketch possibilities in a secluded area was filmed with three cameras: one focusing on each side of the two actors, and one from the front of both of them to establish that the picnic was still going on behind them. Due to space limitations, the latter angle was filmed through a mirror (with the actors <b>appearing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> opposite sides) and then the image was reversed and undistorted in post-production.|$|E
5|$|There {{was a scene}} were I {{was lying}} on the ground, <b>appearing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dead, in a Lodger-esque pose and we had a camera with a big weather balloon filled with helium hooked up to it… the first one we did, we started the film, I was laying on the ground and the ropes that were holding the balloon snapped, the camera just took off into the atmosphere… the camera landed two hundred miles away in a farmer's field somewhere. He finds it and takes it to the police, {{thinking}} that it's a surveillance camera for marijuana, they develop the film and think that it's some sort of snuff film of a murder, give it to the FBI and have pathologists looking at the body saying, 'yeah, he's rotting,' (I had corn starch on me, right) 'he's been decomposing for 3 weeks.' You could see {{the other members of the}} band walking away and they had these weird outfits on, and they thought it was some kind of gang slaying.|$|E
5|$|United {{responded with}} their first {{extended}} period of possession of the half, working the ball into wide areas to be crossed into the middle, but Rooney's first couple of attempted centres were well cleared by Piqué. At the third attempt, though, Rooney's cross evaded the Barcelona defence as Touré kicked at thin air; however, it also failed to find a Manchester United player in the penalty area, both Ronaldo and Park going close. After Ronaldo was called offside in the 59thminute – despite <b>appearing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> level with the last defender – Giggs stole the ball mid-way inside the Barcelona half before playing the ball to Ronaldo on the left wing. The Portuguese forward stepped over the ball several times {{in an attempt to}} wrong-foot Puyol, before cutting inside and playing the ball across the edge of the area towards Carrick. A sliding challenge from Busquets prevented a shot, only for the English midfielder to slide the ball out for a Barcelona goal kick while attempting to play Rooney through. Rooney was again played down the right wing a few moments later, but his low cross was diverted behind by Piqué, and the resulting corner came to nothing. A left-wing attack from Ronaldo followed, but after cutting inside, he gave the ball away cheaply. Barcelona immediately went on the attack down the other end, but Henry was unable to get past O'Shea and his shot was well saved by Van der Sar low at the near post.|$|E
5000|$|Federal Communications Commission (FCC) {{investigators}} {{arrive in}} the San Fernando Valley after what <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a flying saucer crash, causing massive interference with tele-radio transmissions. During their investigation, they receive eyewitness reports of what <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a man dressed in a bizarre outfit, which <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> radioactive and thus a public threat.|$|R
50|$|The {{world of}} Triplane Turmoil <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> set during or {{some time after}} the First World War, {{possibly}} in the mid-1920s, {{given the fact that}} triplanes still have nose-mounted machine guns using interrupter gear, and <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> capable of carrying and releasing fairly heavy ordnance. Furthermore, respirators do not <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in use.|$|R
50|$|There <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{two related}} copies of P1 sRNA in the P. aeruginosa PA01 genome and both copies <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> located {{upstream}} of predicted glutamine synthetase genes. This sRNA <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> conserved amongst several Pseudomonas species. P1 has a predicted Rho independent terminator at the 3 end but {{the function of}} P1 is unknown.|$|R

5000|$|Natural {{landmarks}} included [...] "Whynchatakea Peak", a large mountain. The {{geography of}} Pottsylvania is indeterminate, however. In some locations it <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a peninsula, while in others it <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> either a coastal nation (with seaports) or completely landlocked. Nevertheless, it is accessible by submarine, which <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the main form of entry.|$|R
50|$|ABC {{does not}} <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> under {{development}} and thus <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> dead software. The last version released was version 3.1 which {{was released on}} 2 October 2005.|$|R

25|$|Mallett {{had little}} ability with the bat, with a Test best of 43* made on his debut against England, with a first class best of 92 against Western Australia. He had good {{reflexes}} and completed many difficult catches in the gully position, despite <b>appearing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> short sighted. He captained the state team {{on two occasions}} in 198081, his final season.|$|E

Baron Hats made Charlie's hat which they called “The Trigger man”. Sales of these items increased during {{the release of the}} film.|$|E
25|$|A new Batmobile {{is seen in}} the 1997 film Batman & Robin. It is {{prominently}} {{featured in}} one scene in which, as Batman and Robin are in pursuit, Mr. Freeze shoots the underside of the car for several seconds with his freeze-gun, before the car crash-lands. However, in the next scene in the Batcave, the Batmobile is sitting back on its pedestal <b>appearing</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in perfect condition.|$|E
5000|$|Lawson {{is known}} for having coined several notable quotations, {{including}} [...] "to govern <b>is</b> <b>to</b> choose. <b>To</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unable <b>to</b> choose <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>appear</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> unable <b>to</b> govern." ...|$|R
