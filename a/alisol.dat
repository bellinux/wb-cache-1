40|$|Background: Non-alcoholic {{fatty liver}} disease (NAFLD) is closely {{associated}} with metabolic disorders including hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation. <b>Alisol</b> A 24 -acetate, a triterpene from Alismatis rhizome, has multiple biologic activities such as hypolipidemic, anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic. Thus we hypothesized that <b>Alisol</b> A 24 -acetate would have effect on NAFLD. The present {{study was conducted to}} investigate the therapeutic effects and potential mechanisms of <b>Alisol</b> A 24 -acetate against hepatic steatosis in a free fatty acids (FFAs) induced NAFLD cell model. Methods: This study was divided into four groups including Control group, Model group (FFA group), <b>Alisol</b> A 24 -acetate (FFA+A) group, Fenofibrate (FFA+F) group. Preventive role of <b>Alisol</b> A 24 -acetate was evaluated using 10 µM <b>Alisol</b> A 24 -acetate plus 1 mM FFA (oleate:palmitate= 2 : 1) incubated with HepG 2 cells for 24 h, which was determined by Oil Red O Staining, Oil Red O based colorimetric assay and intracellular triglyceride (TG) content. Besides, the inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF) - α, interleukin (IL) - 6 levels as well as the protein and mRNA expressions that were involved in fatty acid synthesis and oxidation including Adiponectin, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) α, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α, sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 c (SREBP- 1 c), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), fatty acid synthase (FAS), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT 1) and acyl coenzyme A oxidase 1 (ACOX 1) were detected. Results: <b>Alisol</b> A 24 -acetate significantly decreased the numbers of lipid droplets, Oil Red O lipid content, and intracellular TG content. Besides, inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL- 6 levels were markedly inhibited by <b>Alisol</b> A 24 -acetate. Furthermore, <b>Alisol</b> A 24 -acetate effectively increased the protein and mRNA expressions of Adiponectin, the phosphorylation of AMPKα, CPT 1 and ACOX 1, whereas decreased SREBP- 1 c, the phosphorylation of ACC and FAS at both protein and mRNA levels. However, there was no significant effect on the protein and mRNA expressions of PPARα by <b>Alisol</b> A 24 -acetate. Conclusions: These results demonstrated that <b>Alisol</b> A 24 -acetate effectively ameliorated hepatic steatosis likely through Adiponectin, which activated AMPKα signaling pathways via down-regulating SREBP- 1 c, ACC, FAS and up-regulating CPT 1 and ACOX 1, and inhibited inflammation.

Using these ratios, global and regional/local calibrations have been established using surface soils, but generally without any preliminary study of soil types. In this study, we reconsider global MAAT-pH/brGDGT calibrations by assigning soil types to the 358 components of a composite soil dataset. Additionally, we investigate brGDGT-derived proxies in five well-described soil profiles along an altitudinal transect in the Mount Fan Si Pan National Park, northwestern Vietnam. Our results show that at the global scale, traditional MAAT-pH/brGDGT relationships per soil type are significantly different and that MAAT (and pH) residuals per soil type may differ as well, for example between <b>Alisols</b> and Podzols. This effect persists when 5 - and 6 -methyl brGDGTs are quantified separately. Moreover, MAAT (and pH) residuals per soil type are generally not clearly reduced, including in Leptosols, in which 6 -methyl brGDGTs are present. In the Fan Si Pan transect, MBT'/CBT-MAAT estimates showed no significant deviation from expected MAATs.

Mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) is commonly used to determine soil pore size distributions (PSDs) in a wide, but incomplete, range of equivalent pore diameters. Mono- and multifractal analyses of soil PSDs are useful for analyzing the soil porous system. The main objective of this work was to characterize PSDs from tropical soils using the multifractal approach. Duplicate PSDs were measured by MIP for 54 horizons collected from 19 soil profiles in Minas Gerais, Brazil.

In this study, a national soil map of Denmark was constructed based on the FAO–Unesco Revised Legend 1990 using digital soil mapping techniques, existing soil profile observations and environmental data. This map was developed using soil-landscape models generated with a decision tree-based digital soil mapping technique. As input variables in the model, more than 1170 soil profile data and 17 environmental variables including geology, land use, landscape type, area of wetlands, digital elevation model and its derivatives were compiled. The predicted map showed that Podzols and Luvisols were the most frequent soil groups, covering almost two-thirds of the area of Denmark. Geographically, Podzols occupied a major portion of western Denmark, where the soils have developed on sandy parent material, whereas eastern Denmark mostly contained Luvisols developed on loamy basal till. The occurrence of the predicted soil groups was assigned using several variables, of the most important was clay content in the topsoil and subsoil, elevation, geology and landscape type. The overall prediction accuracy based on a 20 % hold-back validation data was 60 %, but increased to 76 % when prediction accuracy of similar soil groups was considered. Podzoluvisols and <b>Alisols</b> were among the weakly predicted groups (70 %). Overall, the average prediction uncertainty was less than 34 %. Compared to the existing conventional soil map, the new map showed promising predictions. Validation of the predicted map with different techniques (point validation, prediction confidence analysis, and map-to-map comparison) confirmed that the output is reliable and can be used in various soil and environmental studies without major difficulties. This study also verified the importance of GlobalSoilMap products and a priori pedological information that improved prediction performance and quality of the new FAO soil map of Denmark...|$|R
40|$|Consistency of {{response}} to arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) inoculation is required for efficient use of AM fungi in plant production. Here, {{we found that the}} response triggered in plants by an AM strain depends on the properties of the soil where it is introduced. Two data sets from 130 different experiments assessing the outcome of a total of 548 replicated single inoculation trials conducted either in soils with a history of (1) high input agriculture (HIA; 343 replicated trials) or (2) in more pristine soils from coffee plantations (CA; 205 replicated trials) were examined. Plant response to inoculation with different AM strains in CA soils planted with coffee was related to soil properties associated with soil types. The strains Glomus fasciculatum-like and Glomus etunicatum-like were particularly performant in soil relatively rich in nutrients and organic matter. Paraglomus occultum and Glomus mosseae-like performed best in relatively poor soils, and G. mosseae and Glomus manihotis did best in soils of medium fertility. Acaulospora scrobiculata, Diversispora spurca, G. mosseae-like, G. mosseae and P. occultum stimulated coffee growth best in Chromic, Eutric Alluvial Cambisol, G. fasciculatum-like and G. etunicatum-like in Calcaric Cambisol and G. manihotis, in Chromic, Eutric Cambisols. Acaulospora scrobiculata and Diversispora spurca strains performed best in Chromic <b>Alisols</b> and Rodic Ferralsols. There was no significant relationship between plant response to AM fungal strains and soil properties in the HIA soil data set, may be due to variation induced by the use of different host plant species and to modification of soil properties by a history of intensive production. Consideration of the performance of AM fungal strains in target soil environments may well be the key for efficient management of the AM symbiosis in plant production...|$|R
40|$|Soil loss by runoff is {{a severe}} and {{continuous}} ecological problem in Koga watershed. Deforestation, improper cultivation and uncontrolled grazing {{have resulted in}} accelerated soil erosion. Information on soil loss is essential to support agricultural productivity and natural resource management. Thus, this study was aimed to estimate and map the mean annual soil loss by using GIS and Remote sensing techniques. The soil loss was estimated by using Revised Universal Soil Equation (RUSLE) model. Topographic map of 1 : 50, 000 scale, Aster Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of 20  m spatial resolution, digital soil map of 1 : 250, 000 scale, thirteen years rainfall records of four stations, and land sat imagery (TM) with spatial resolution of 30  m was used to derive RUSLE's soil loss variables. The RUSLE parameters were analyzed and integrated using raster calculator in the geo-processing tools in ArcGIS 10. 1 environment to estimate and map the annual soil loss of the study area. The result revealed that the annual soil loss of the watershed extends from none in the lower and middle part of the watershed to 265  t ha− 1  year− 1 in the steeper slope part of the watershed with a mean annual soil loss of 47  t ha− 1  year− 1. The total annual soil loss in the watershed was 255283  t, of these, 181801 (71 %) tones cover about 6691 (24 %) hectare of land. Most of these soil erosion affected areas are spatially situated in the upper steepest slope part (inlet) of the watershed. These are areas where Nitosols and <b>Alisols</b> with higher soil erodibility character (0. 25) values are dominant. Hence, Slope gradient and length followed by soil erodibility factors {{were found to be}} the main factors of soil erosion. Thus, sustainable soil and water conservation practices should be adopted in steepest upper part of the study area by respecting and recognizing watershed logic, people and watershed potentials...|$|R

40|$|Hydromorphic Podzol soils in the Amazon Basin {{generally}} support low-stature forests {{with some}} of the lowest amounts of aboveground net primary production (NPP) in the region. However, they can also exhibit large values of belowground NPP that can contribute significantly to the total annual inputs of organic matter into the soil. These hydromorphic Podzol soils also exhibit a horizon rich in organic matter at around 1 – 2 m depth, presumably as a result of eluviation of dissolved organic matter and sesquioxides of Fe and Al. Therefore, it is likely that these ecosystems store large quantities of carbon by (1) large amounts of C inputs to soils dominated by their high levels of fine-root production, (2) stabilization of organic matter in an illuviation horizon due to significant vertical transfers of C. To assess these ideas we studied soil carbon dynamics using radiocarbon in two adjacent Amazon forests growing on contrasting soils: a hydromorphic Podzol and a well-drained <b>Alisol</b> supporting a high-stature terra firme forest. Our measurements showed similar concentrations of C and radiocarbon in the litter layer and the first 5 cm of the mineral soil for both sites. This result is consistent with the idea that the hydromorphic Podzol soil has similar soil C storage and cycling rates compared to the well-drained <b>Alisol</b> that supports a more opulent vegetation. However, we found important differences in carbon dynamics and transfers along the vertical profile. At both soils, we found similar radiocarbon concentrations in the subsoil, but the carbon released after incubating soil samples presented radiocarbon concentrations of recent origin in the <b>Alisol,</b> but not in the Podzol. There were no indications of incorporation of C fixed after 1950 in the illuvial horizon of the Podzol. With the aid of a simulation model, we predicted that only a minor fraction (1. 7 %) of the labile carbon decomposed in the topsoil is transferred to the subsoil of the Podzol, while this proportional transfer is about 30 % in the <b>Alisol.</b> Furthermore, our estimates were 8 times lower than previous estimations of vertical C transfers in Amazon Podzols, and question the validity of these previous estimations for all Podzols within the Amazon Basin. Our results also challenge our previous ideas about the genesis of these particular soils and suggest that either they are not true Podzols or the podzolization processes had already stoppe...|$|E
40|$|High {{mountain}} {{ecosystems are}} {{generally considered to}} be particularly sensitive to global climate change. Studies of pedogenesis associated with altitudinal variation, vegetation type and soil carbon content on the same type of parent rock are very limited in inter-tropical mountain areas. Therefore the altitudinal variation of soil pedogenesis through 9 selected profiles from the altitude of 1340 m to 3143 mast, the summit of the Fan Si Pan Mountain, in the north of Vietnam was examined. Fan Si Pan Mountain is composed of a homogenous alkaline granite rock and is the highest point of the Inter-tropical Continental Asia. The Soil Organic Matter properties (C, N, delta C- 13 and delta N- 15 contents) of the different grain-size fractions of the topsoil of 4 selected profiles corresponding to different ecosystems were also examined. Three zones of different soil forming processes were present: Acrisols and <b>Alisols</b> at lower altitudes in sub montane forest, Podzols formed in montane and upper montane forest while Umbrisols formed at high altitude where the forest vegetation had given way to a shrubby vegetation or a steppe composed of dwarfed bamboo. With altitude, soils become sandier, have higher concentration of SiO 2 and are lower in Al 2 O 3. The selective Fe and Al oxalate (Fe-o and Al-o) and pyrophosphate (Few and Alp) extracts show a clear discrepancy between Acrisols or Umbrisols with no clear variation with soil depth and Podzols with high enrichment in their Bs horizon. The SOM status is highly dependent of the organic matter input by the vegetation. In Acrisols, the SOC is linked to the fine fraction within the soil profile with rapid turnover and low C/N values. Podzols are formed by the accumulation on soil surface of OM enriched in the coarse fraction with depleted delta N- 15 and high C/N values. The organic matter input is exogenic and probably seasonal from leaves forming the surface litter while in Acrisols or Umbrisols the SOC is mainly linked to the fine fraction, and with constant delta N- 15 values at depth. In Umbrisols, the SOC origin seems to be linked with endogenic inputs deep in the soil profile mostly produced by the decay of bamboo roots. In this tropical mountainous soil catena, the soil carbon mineralization depends not only on temperature and organo-metallic complexes that stabilize the non labile carbon pool but also is controlled by the pedogenetic process, which is linked with the vegetal ecosystem change with altitude...|$|R
40|$|Shrubs cover {{about one}} third of Montesinho Natural Park (PNM), a 750 km 2 belt in NE Portugal, {{which is part of}} the Portuguese network of {{protected}} areas since 1978. The Park hosts very important natural values and striking examples of balanced land use in humanized landscapes. Scrublands are present dominantly in marginal areas on steep slopes, scrublands are indeed a stable element in PNM landscapes. Main types of scrublands found in Montesinho are “Urzais” (Erica australis as representative species, 68 % of shrub area), “Giestais” (Cytisus multiflorus, 11 %), and “Estevais” (Cistus ladanifer, 21 %). Scrublands are thought to play an important role in these mountain catchments due to their area, spatial distribution, and hydrological response to precipitation. As part of a wider study, previous work by the same authors, focused on PNM shrubs, showed the runoff generation potential of these areas, assessed on similar soil, under simulated rainfall at micro-scale. Although not significantly different, shrub types can be ranked according to hydrological response. Soil data are required for runoff generation estimates in the wide range of soil types found in PNM scrublands. The aim of this presentation is to address soils of scrublands in PNM, describing properties and discussing their relevance to hydrological response of these surfaces. Basic data comprises soil and vegetation maps of PNM, on a GIS specifically designed for the area, together with the Soil Map of NE Portugal profile descriptions specific data base. Soils were classed according to permeability and assigned to SCS soil hydrological classification, considering data on soil properties as depth to impervious layer, texture, C content and stoniness. Commonly referenced pedotransfer functions ere also applied. Soils in PNM scrublands are dominantly incipient shallow (Leptosols, 96 % of the area), with a high C content in the surface horizon (Umbric secondary units in 66 % of the area), and high rock fragment content (mean rock fragment content 20 - 25 %). In relative terms, “Giestais” cover a larger area of developed soils (Luvisols and <b>Alisols,</b> 9 %) and a smaller one of high C content soils (24 %). “Urzais” are dominant in areas with granitic parent material. Soil characteristics and components help explaining the relative importance and spatial distribution of soil hydrologic classes in PNM. In half of the area soils are moderately permeable, in less than 1 / 5 permeability is high, and it is low in about 1 / 3 of PNM scrublands area. Sharp differences are found between shrub types, as “Urzais” have the highest areal proportion of highly permeable soils (26 %) and “Giestais” the highest of soils with low permeability (74 %). Results obtained are intended to help improving hydrologic models performance or hydrological data interpretations, by providing spatially distributed soil data estimates...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{vegetation}} in the Iberian Peninsula {{has exhibited}} global-change- type processes including species distribution shifts, altered plant phenology and enhanced forest decline and tree mortality. Studies based on long-term data sets, like tree rings, are providing evidences about {{the implication of}} climate change in these mechanisms. Dendrochronology is the science of dating tree rings. The term “dendroecology” refers to applications of dendrochronological techniques to obtain the information content of dated rings for studying dynamics in forest ecology and environment. Based on tree rings from 2 Quercus ilex L. and 7 Pinus pinea L. stands, we examined stand dynamics and sensitivity to climate in southwest Iberian Peninsula through dendroecological methods. In this presentation we summarize {{the results of these}} investigations and highlight common patterns in growth response to climate change. The climate in the study region is Mediterranean. Meteorological register and climate indices describe increasing temperatures and more frequent extreme events, i. e. heavy rainfalls and heat waves, since the mid- 1970 s. The studied ecosystems differ in stand structure and silviculture (oak open-woodlands with silvo-pastoral use, closed-canopy pine stands for dune ecosystem conservation, timber and nut production), age (oaks are older than 100 years, pines vary from 70 to 150 year-old), soils (Arenosols, Cambisols, Regosols, Planosols and Luvisols in the pine stands; Regosols, Leptosols, Cambisols, Acrisols, <b>Alisols</b> and Lixisols in the oak stands), altitude and distance from the coast (oaks are at 170 - 200 m a. s. l. inland and pine stands are distributed from the coastline, 0 - 10 m a. s. l., to the inland, 250 m a. s. l.). The oak ecosystems were affected by massive tree mortality while pines showed no evident sign of weakening. Tree-ring width chronologies revealed growth suppressions coinciding with increasing drought. To extract the climatic signal, prewithened residual chronologies were calculated from biweight means of ratios between tree-ring widths and individual cubic splines. A common dendroclimatic signal was found in the 1 st principal component of the residual chronologies. Moreover, a common response to changing climate over the last decades was indicated by increasing growth synchrony (i. e. intercorrelation among residual chronologies), enhanced sensitivity to climate (i. e. year-to- year growth variability) and similar temporal changes in climate-growth correlations (i. e. enhanced response to winter precipitation, lower correlation with late-spring/early summer precipitation, increasing sensitivity to high temperatures). These studies constitute the first application of dendroecology to growth dynamics in Southwest Iberian Mediterranean forests and provide an assessment of the adaptive capacity and vulnerability of these populations to changing growing conditions.
