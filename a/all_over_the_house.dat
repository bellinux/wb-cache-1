25|$|To {{complete}} the set up, 26 surveillance cameras are positioned <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> {{to watch the}} housemates' every move, including the bathroom. For modesty's sake, however, images from the bathroom will be shown if the bathroom is used for any purpose other than bathing (such as gossiping).|$|E
25|$|The {{justice of}} the peace from Brive, Moran, arrived at Le Glandier on 15 January. Impressed by Marie, he listened with {{uncertainty}} to the family's accusations but took possession of the soup, the sugar water and the eggnog that Anna Brun had put aside. Then the gardener revealed that Marie had given him arsenic with which to make rat-poison paste in December as well as January. Strangely, the paste could be found <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> untouched by the rats.|$|E
25|$|Organs of {{exquisite}} {{tone and}} ornate appearance have {{become one of}} the outstanding features of motion picture houses and the management of Marion's new playhouse invested a huge sum in obtaining one of the best on the market. The organ is custom made being designed especially for the Marion theater. The size of the building and its acoustic properties were taken into consideration before any work was done on the musical instrument. Every bit of material going into the construction of the organ was carefully selected coming from many lands. Many weeks of work were necessary before the instrument was completed and ready to install. The heart of the organ rests in the switchboard. Keys operate silver and bronze contacts making instantaneous connections with the pipes and other effects. The pipes are cleverly concealed {{on each side of the}} stage, the opening forming double windows leading to balconies of two Spanish towers. The chambers form a natural part of the architecture of the interior. The console is the only part of the huge organ visible. It rests on a platform that can be raised and lowered bringing the console up to a point where it can be viewed to a great advantage <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> or lowered to a point where it does not interfere with the view of the stage. The elevator is controlled by a motor located in a soundproof room back of the stage. The console itself is known as the Page Rainbo Gold deriving its name from the finish. It is heavily scrolled and so finished that lights are reflected in a very effective fashion.|$|E

50|$|On {{the day of}} Dhanteras, {{business}} premises are renovated and decorated. Entrances are made colorful with lanterns and traditional motifs of Rangoli designs to welcome the Goddess of Wealth and Prosperity. To indicate her long-awaited arrival, small footprints are drawn with rice flour and vermilion powder <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses.</b> Lamps are kept burning all through the night.|$|R
50|$|Gwalior Glory High School has classes from play group school through grade 12. The {{school is}} divided into six houses, each named after the famous Mountain Ranges from <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> world. <b>The</b> <b>houses</b> are Himadri, Shivalik, Nilgiri, Vindhyanchal, Aravali, and Shyadri.|$|R
2500|$|The group reunites in {{the main}} hall. [...] Emery {{attempts}} to attack Annie with a fireplace poker. Using psychokinesis, Annie animates a suit of armor and attempts to kill Emery with a halberd. Neither attack succeeds, and Joyce calms both individuals. [...] In an attempt to uncover the secret of Rose Red, Steve creates a telepathic link between Cathy and Annie, and Cathy begins to engage in automatic writing. Annie begins to draw pictures of boulders striking the house, smashed doors, and broken glass, and soon doors and windows <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> are opening and closing violently and glass in the windows shatters. Rocks begin to fall, destroying Mrs. Waterman's car and causing severe damage to Rose Red. Cathy automatically writes [...] "help us" [...] and [...] "open the doors," [...] prompting Annie to unseal the house. [...] Steve, Emery, Cathy, Rachel, and Annie make their escape from Rose Red, but Joyce, now clearly insane, refuses to leave. The group is attacked by the spectre of Ellen Rimbauer, but Annie prevents Ellen from coming after them. Mrs. Waterman's ghost leaps from a mirror and attempts to draw Emery into the spirit realm, but Emery, {{with the assistance of}} Steve and Cathy, resists his mother {{for the first time in}} his life, and Mrs. Waterman vanishes again. [...] The survivors flee to their cars as boulders rain down on Rose Red. Back in the house, Joyce suddenly realizes too late that she does want to leave, but is surrounded by the ghosts of Rose Red: Nick, Pam, Vic, Mrs. Waterman, Miller, Bollinger, Sukeena, and Deanna Petrie. She screams in terror as the film fades to black.|$|E
60|$|A laugh {{broke out}} <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> as Putney dropped {{back into his}} seat. Mr. Gerrish stood {{apparently}} undaunted.|$|E
60|$|Next morning, {{when it was}} {{discovered}} that Eliza had run away with her little boy, there was great excitement and confusion <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "And now," [...] said he, [...] "it {{really would}} be a good thing that we should <b>all</b> go <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> {{together}} and make certain that this rather erratic burglar did not, after all, carry anything away with him." ...|$|R
50|$|Radlkofer's main {{work was}} on the family Sapindaceae. His collections, sent by botanists from <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> world, are <b>housed</b> in Munich.|$|R
6000|$|There is a {{rustle of}} {{programs}} <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> You {{can hear a}} buzz of voices say, [...] "He's Sir John Trevor." [...] They're all on to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not so {{sure about}} that, if we can't get a regular doctor. But he is very restless, and wanders <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> like a timid and apologetic spaniel." ...|$|E
60|$|Having {{displayed}} themselves {{below and}} romped <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> the masqueraders grew tired at last, and early twilight warned {{them to leave}} before ghostly shadows began to haunt the garret.|$|E
60|$|They {{were great}} black creatures that ran boldly in broad {{daylight}} through the streets, and swarmed so, <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>houses,</b> that people at last could not put their hand or foot down anywhere without touching one. When dressing in the morning they found them in their breeches and petticoats, in their pockets and in their boots; and when they wanted a morsel to eat, the voracious horde had swept away everything from cellar to garret. The night was even worse. As soon as the lights were out, these untiring nibblers set to work. And everywhere, in the ceilings, in the floors, in the cupboards, at the doors, there was a chase and a rummage, and so furious a noise of gimlets, pincers, and saws, that a deaf man could not have rested for one hour together.|$|R
50|$|When Jenny wakes up, Billy calmly {{asks her}} about the lies. During this {{conversation}} she begins to hallucinate, seeing flames and snakes <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> room. <b>House</b> wakes up alone. The doctors assume whatever is happening has hit Jenny's brain. Kelly {{is the only one}} to suggest these latest symptoms could be unrelated, simply the first signs of mental illness. House orders a biopsy.|$|R

"Well, sir, you see," [...] said he, [...] "there was an 'orrid {{smell of}} gas in <b>the</b> <b>'ouse,</b> an' <b>the</b> missus she sent for a gas man {{to find out where}} it was, and, would you believe it, sir, they went to look for it with a candle! Sure enough they found it too, in a small cupboard. The gas had been escapin', it had, but couldn't git out o' that there cupboard, 'cause the door was a tight fit, so it had made its way <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>'ouse</b> between <b>the</b> lath and plaster and the walls. As soon as ever it caught light, sir, it blowed the whole place into smash--as you see. It blowed the gas man flat on his back; (an' sarved him right!) it blowed the missus through the doorway, an' it blowed the cook--(as was on the landin' outside)--right down the kitchen stairs, it did;--but there was none of 'em much hurt, sir, they wasn't, beyond a bruise or two!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Angus, I've {{got it in}} my basket, but I {{fear the}} poor old hen has been lost. It's <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> I sought for it before comin' away, but--" ...|$|E
6000|$|David, however, {{had laid}} {{hold of a}} hope, and getting up from the floor, hastened out of the room, {{followed}} by John; and they were presently heard shouting [...] "Hal!" [...] <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b>|$|E
60|$|ERMYNTRUDE [scornfully]. Yes: there WOULD be. Suppose we {{must put}} up with that: sinks in our rooms, and pipes that rattle and bang and guggle <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> {{whenever}} anyone washes his hands. I know.|$|E

60|$|There was {{a feeling}} of misery <b>over</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> <b>The</b> {{children}} breathed the air that was poisoned, and they felt dreary. They were rather disconsolate, {{did not know what}} to do, what to play at.|$|R
60|$|A superb {{display of}} flags flapped gayly {{in the breeze}} on the September morning when Ben proudly entered his teens. An {{irruption}} of bunting seemed to have broken out <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> old <b>house,</b> for banners of every shape and size, color and design, flew from chimney-top to gable, porch and gate-way, making the quiet place look as lively as a circus tent, which was just what Ben most desired and delighted in.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mamma," [...] said Rosamond, [...] "when Fred {{comes down}} I {{wish you would}} not let him have red herrings. I cannot bear the smell of them <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> at this hour of the morning." ...|$|E

60|$|Avonlea folks {{did nothing}} {{the next day}} but visit each other and compare damages. The roads were impassable for wheels by reason of the hailstones, so they walked or rode on horseback. The mail came late with ill tidings from <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> province. <b>Houses</b> had been struck, people killed and injured; the whole {{telephone}} and telegraph system had been disorganized, {{and any number of}} young stock exposed in the fields had perished.|$|R

6000|$|By Jackson, it petrified them! People rose up wild <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> {{straining}} {{and staring}} {{for a better}} look at him, and the judge was hammering with his mallet and the sheriff yelling [...] "Order--order in the court--order!" ...|$|E

If I had done that, {{there would have}} been camel dung <b>all</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> White <b>House</b> lawn."

60|$|They found timber {{enough and}} to spare; but, {{as it was}} not exactly the kind they wanted, Toby {{proposed}} that they should <b>all</b> go <b>over</b> to <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> explain <b>the</b> matter to Aunt Olive, and ask her to give them as many empty boxes as she could afford to part with.|$|R
