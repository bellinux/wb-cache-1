The wood engraver Thomas Bewick's 1797–1804 A History of British Birds brought affordable illustrations {{to the public for}} the first time, and the book formed in effect the first field guide to birds, while John James Audubon's enormous and impressive images of birds in his 1827–1838 Birds of America are among the most admired by art critics and by collectors: early editions fetch among the highest prices paid for any printed books. The ornithologist John Gould's bird illustrations, in books such as A Century of Birds hitherto unfigured from the Himalaya Mountains (1830–1833) with 80 plates, and his 7-volume The Birds of Australia (1840–1848) with 600 plates, related directly to his research, were both beautiful and scientifically useful.|$|E

25|$|According to the Palestinian Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs, 203 mosques {{were damaged}} during the war, with 73 being {{destroyed}} completely. Two of Gaza's three Christian churches were also damaged, {{with the third}} suffering some damage to peripheral buildings owned by the parish. In {{the light of the}} damage to mosques, Manuel Musallam informed Muslims they could call their prayers from Christian churches. In contrast to Operation Pillar of Defensive, which did not damage a single mosque, Israel maintained that Hamas had a routine military use of mosques <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> them legitimate military targets. According to the IDF, 160 rockets were launched from mosques during the war. It also stated that mosques were used for weapon storage, tunnel entrances, training and gathering of militants. In one Associated Press report, residents denied that mosques damaged by Israeli forces had been used for military purposes.|$|E
500|$|The {{increased}} {{realism of}} the puppets meant that their mobility was significantly reduced, ironically leaving {{the new design}} less lifelike than Anderson had hoped, as he recalls: [...] "Suddenly, all the movements had to be as realistic as the puppets <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> {{it difficult for the}} puppeteers to animate them." [...] To minimise the amount of movement required, the puppets were made to stand on moving walkways or sit at moving desks: for example, Colonel White's desk on Cloudbase is seen to rotate, while Lieutenant Green is seen to operate the Cloudbase main computer from a sliding chair.

500|$|John Gielgud's New Theatre {{production}} in 1935 featured Gielgud and Laurence Olivier as Romeo and Mercutio, exchanging roles six {{weeks into the}} run, with Peggy Ashcroft as Juliet. Gielgud used a scholarly combination of Q1 and Q2 texts and organised the set and costumes to match {{as closely as possible}} to the Elizabethan period. His efforts were a huge success at the box office, and set the stage for increased historical realism in later productions. Olivier later compared his performance and Gielgud's: [...] "John, all spiritual, all spirituality, all beauty, all abstract things; and myself as all earth, blood, humanity... I've always felt that John missed the lower half <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> me go for the other... But whatever it was, when I was playing Romeo I was carrying a torch, I was trying to sell realism in Shakespeare." ...|$|E
500|$|McCann {{notes that}} one of the reasons that Grant was so {{successful}} with his film career is that he was not conscious of how handsome he was on screen, acting in a fashion which was most unexpected and unusual from a Hollywood star of that period. George Cukor once stated: [...] "You see, he didn't depend on his looks. He wasn't a narcissist, he acted as though he were just an ordinary young man. <b>And</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> it all the more appealing, that a handsome young man was funny; that was especially unexpected and good because we think, 'Well, if he's a Beau Brummel, he can't be either funny or intelligent', but he proved otherwise". Jennifer Grant acknowledged that her father neither relied on his looks nor was a character actor, and said that he was just the opposite of that, playing the [...] "basic man".|$|E
500|$|... "Lisa's Sax" [...] is {{the first}} episode that Al Jean had ever been {{credited}} as having written by himself. Before this episode, all of his writing credits had been shared with Mike Reiss. The episode was written with a small staff that consisted of Jean, Reiss and David Stern, among others. According to Reiss, the final episode contained 80–90% of Jean's original script. It is the sixth flashback episode done by the show. [...] "The Way We Was" [...] was the first flashback episode and in it, Homer {{graduated from high school}} in 1974 <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> it difficult to have a realistic timeframe as this episode is set in 1990. Jean conceived the idea for the All in the Family style opening while waiting to get tickets to the O.J. Simpson murder trial. The episode was very short and the clip of Lisa playing the sax at the end was added to lengthen it.|$|E

500|$|Following {{transfer}} negotiations {{which had}} been ongoing in the final months of the season, Kinkladze left Manchester City for Dutch club Ajax for £5 million. The move brought a reunion with Shota Arveladze, with whom he shared a house in Amsterdam. However, Kinkladze's spell at Ajax proved unsuccessful. He was originally signed {{as a replacement for}} Jari Litmanen, but Litmanen stayed at Ajax as his proposed move to Barcelona fell through. As a result, Kinkladze played in an unfamiliar left-wing position. His league debut for Ajax came in a 2–0 win against Willem II on 23 August 1998, but he made few starts. To compound matters, manager Morten Olsen was sacked early in the season, and a disagreement with replacement Jan Wouters resulted in Kinkladze losing his place in the team. [...] "I could have been Maradona and he wouldn't have changed the system to accommodate me", Kinkladze recalled later. [...] "I wasn't playing football <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> my life hell." [...] He immediately started to look elsewhere. Several English top-flight clubs showed interest in signing him, but were discouraged by work permit issues. His lack of regular playing time also resulted in him losing his place in the Georgian national team. Having failed to established himself in the first team and struggling with a succession of injuries, he made just 12 appearances for Ajax in his first season.|$|E
500|$|Both {{sides were}} willing. Catmull and fellow Pixar co-founder Alvy Ray Smith had long wanted {{to produce a}} computer-animated feature. In addition, Disney had {{licensed}} Pixar's Computer Animation Production System (CAPS), <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> it the largest customer for Pixar's computers. Jobs made it apparent to Katzenberg that although Disney was happy with Pixar, {{it was not the}} other way around: [...] "We want to do a film with you," [...] said Jobs. [...] "That would make us happy." [...] At this same time, Peter Schneider, president of Walt Disney Feature Animation, was potentially interested in making a feature film with Pixar. When Catmull, Smith and head of animation Ralph Guggenheim met with Schneider in the summer of 1990, they found the atmosphere to be puzzling and contentious. They later learned that Katzenberg intended that if Disney were to make a film with Pixar, it would be outside Schneider's purview, which aggravated Schneider. After that first meeting, the Pixar contingent went home with low expectations and was surprised when Katzenberg called for another conference. Catmull, Smith, and Guggenheim were joined by Bill Reeves (head of animation research and development), Jobs, and Lasseter. They brought with them an idea for a half-hour television special called A Tin Toy Christmas. They reasoned that a television program would be a sensible way to gain experience before tackling a feature film.|$|E
500|$|Retrospective {{feedback}} of the console praises its support toward {{development of the}} Sega Genesis, but is generally critical of its small game library. Writing for AllGame, Dave Beuscher notes that [...] "it was doomed {{by the lack of}} third party software support and all but disappeared from the American market by 1992." [...] On the other hand, Retro Gamer praised the system's PAL library as a [...] "superb library of interesting ports and excellent exclusives", noting that it was significantly larger than its North American library. Damien McFerran of Retro Gamer recognizes its value to the future success of the Genesis, stating, [...] "Without this criminally undervalued machine, Sega would not have enjoyed the considerable success it had with the Mega Drive. The Master System allowed Sega to experiment with arcade conversions, original IP and even create a mascot {{in the form of the}} lovable monkey-boy Alex Kidd." [...] In 2009, the Master System was named the 20th best video game console of all time by the video gaming website IGN, behind both of its main competitors, the Atari 7800 (ranked 17th best) and the Nintendo Entertainment System (1st). IGN cited the Master System's small games library, coupled with the highly uneven quality of the few games that were released, as the console's major issues, stating, [...] "Months could go by between major releases <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> a dud on the Master System feel even more painful." ...|$|E

You never see him show up anyone and he respects the game. I've always looked up to him and it's always a compliment to be just mentioned in the same sentence as him." [...] Michael Young said of Rivera, [...] "I respect Mo more than anybody in the game. The guy goes out there, gets three outs and shakes [...] Posada's hand. You appreciate someone who respects the game like he does, respects the people he plays with and against, and obviously his results speak for themselves." [...] In a Sports Illustrated cover story about Rivera that was published in the final week of his career, Verducci said of the pitcher, [...] "Few players in any sport have retired with more reverence from his peers." [...] Rivera was the last MLB player to wear the uniform number 42 on a regular basis; {{at the time of his}} retirement, he was the only active player still grandfathered by the league to wear Jackie Robinson's retired number. Speaking about Rivera's connection to her husband, Robinson's widow Rachel said, [...] " [...] carried himself with dignity and grace, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> carrying the number a tribute to Jack... I've always been proud and pleased that Mariano was the one chosen to wear that number because I think he brought something special to it." [...] Presenting him with the Commissioner's Historic Achievement Award, Selig said: [...] "Throughout his illustrious career, he has represented his family, his country, the Yankees and all of Major League Baseball with the utmost class and dignity. It is wholly appropriate that Mariano was the last Major League player to wear Jackie Robinson's sacred number 42." ...|$|E
500|$|Heigl {{believes}} that the Grey's Anatomy writers incorporate much of the actors' personalities into their roles, and that Izzie is a [...] "super moral" [...] version of herself. Episode [...] "Bring the Pain", which aired as the fifth episode of the second season, was originally intended {{to be the final}} episode of the first season. Rhimes explained that Izzie's character in this episode came [...] "full circle" [...] from her role in the pilot: [...] "Izzie, so vulnerable and underestimated when we first meet her, is the girl who removes her heart from her sleeve in [...] "Bring the Pain"." [...] Discussing Izzie's personality in a 2006 Cosmopolitan interview, Heigl assessed that she is [...] "immensely kind" [...] and patient. When Denny died in the season two episode [...] "Losing My Religion", Rhimes discussed the impact it had on Izzie, noting that Izzie is forced to abandon her idealism, which in turn leads to her letting go of medicine. In the aftermath of Denny's death, Heigl came to believe that Izzie was not cut out to be a doctor. Executive producer Betsy Beers explained, however, that Denny's death served to make Izzie more mature, and Heigl affirmed that [...] "At the beginning of the [...] season they were trying to show how lost Izzie was. She lost her optimism. She realizes now that life is difficult, but she still tries very hard to see the best in people." [...] In order to demonstrate Izzie's dislike of George's love-interest Callie, Rhimes penned a scene which she deemed one of her favorite moments on the show, in which Callie urinates in front of a stunned Izzie and Meredith. Rhimes assessed that: [...] "I love that Mer and Izzie respond with all the trauma of having viewed [...] a car crash [...] the point is Callie pees and Izzie tortures her a tiny bit about the hand washing <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> me overjoyed because that’s the kind of thing people do." ...|$|E

2500|$|Blackmore's {{poetry is}} leaden.

However, Blackmore used his poetry to satirise and destroy persons of the other political factions, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>made</b> him (except for when his subject matter was religion) fair game for a counter-attack {{that he could not}} survive.
