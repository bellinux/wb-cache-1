5000|$|Rather than use multi-position controllers, some brands have {{switched}} to fully digital control panels that, {{in addition to}} a LED display, use a one-touch interface similar to a kitchen oven. Multi-position and digital controllers both utilize simple microprocessors that work in conjunction with the sensors to create a feedback loop, allowing the pellet grill to make small adjustments to auger activity. The sensor measures the grill temperature and sends the information to the controller, which initiates or halts the auger when the grill exceeds or falls below a specified threshold. Traeger, which uses Ortech controllers, states that the RTD sensor in their grills monitors temperature changes and [...] "causes the <b>auger</b> <b>motor</b> to turn or not turn depending upon the difference between the selected temperature and the desired temperature." [...] Green Mountain Grills utilize ambient sensors to tell the control board to ramp up the heat when the outside temperature drops. However, these controllers are still limited in how tightly they can hold a temperature. And although they can make small corrections, those corrections are more of a temporary override to the predetermined duty cycle than an on-the-fly recalculation of it. That means that these pellet grills still struggle to reach and maintain a precise temperature in windy or cold weather, or with a larger cook load.|$|E

40|$|A {{number of}} <b>motored</b> <b>auger</b> holes have been drilled in 2002 and 2006 in four sand-clay {{deposits}} preserved in dissolution pockets within the Dinantian limestones of the watershed {{north of the}} Vesdre valley. These deposits of unknown age are currently classified as (Tertiary) SBL in the new geological map of Wallonia. We present detailed lithostratigraphic logs of the deposits and describe the results of sedimentological and mineralogical analyses. In particular, K-Ar dating of neoformed Mn oxides found {{at the base of}} one augerhole at Rechain yielded ages ranging from Cenomanian to Santonian, allowing us to place the Rechain and Andrimont deposits within the early Late Cretaceous. This is fully consistent with their topographic location very close beneath the trace of the pre-Cretaceous erosion surface and makes them the westernmost remains of the Hergenrath Member of the Late Cretaceous Aachen Formation. To the west, the Magnée deposit is more “typical SBL”, probably corresponding to the Late Neogene filling of a dissolution pocket by reworked weathering products of the local Cretaceous cover.
