50|$|<b>Athletic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome,</b> (AHS) {{also known}} as athlete's heart, {{athletic}} bradycardia, or exercise-induced cardiomegaly is a nonpathological condition commonly seen in sports medicine, in which the human heart is enlarged, and the resting heart rate is lower than normal.|$|E
50|$|During sleep, a slow {{heartbeat}} with rates around 40-50 BPM is common, and {{is considered}} normal. Highly trained athletes may also have <b>athletic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome,</b> a very slow resting heart rate that occurs as a sport adaptation and helps prevent tachycardia during training.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} {{premature}} ventricular contraction, {{is the classic}} <b>athletic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Sustained training of athletes causes a cardiac adaptation where the resting SAN rate is lower (sometimes around 40 beats per minute). This can lead to atrioventricular block, where the signal from the SAN is impaired in its path to the ventricles. This leads to uncoordinated contractions between the atria and ventricles, without the correct delay in between and in severe cases can result in sudden death.|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveThe Norwood procedure, {{the first}} {{surgical}} step of staged palliation for hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome,</b> is also applied for other complex single-ventricle lesions with systemic outflow tract obstruction or aortic arch hypoplasia. We reviewed our 15 -year institutional {{experience with the}} Norwood procedure for patients with and without hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome.</b> MethodsA total of 41 patients without hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> and 212 patients with hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> who underwent a Norwood procedure between January 1996 and December 2010 were enrolled. Full medical records were reviewed to assess the determinants of outcome. ResultsEarly failure (death or cardiac transplantation) was 7 % in patients without hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> and 13 % in patients with hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> (P = . 29). Frequency of postoperative complications, duration of postoperative ventilation, and length of vasoactive drug treatment were not different between groups. Transplant-free survival until the second operative step trended to be higher for patients without hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> (92 % vs 80 %, P = . 067). Recurrent aortic arch obstruction was more common in patients without hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> (15 / 39 vs 32 / 171, P = . 008), but there were 4 patients with stenosis of the proximal aortic arch. In subsequent procedures, 31 patients without hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> underwent superior cavopulmonary anastomosis and 5 biventricular repair. Overall transplant-free survival was not different between groups (P = . 119) but trended to be higher in patients with a systemic or substantial left ventricle remnant contributing to cardiac output (P = . 082). ConclusionsEarly and long-term survivals and postoperative complications were similar between patients with and without hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> undergoing a Norwood operation. Recurrent aortic arch obstruction was common in both groups but more prevalent in patients without hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome...</b>|$|R
40|$|BackgroundPulmonary artery size is {{a crucial}} {{determinant}} of hemodynamic energy loss in total cavopulmonary connections. We investigated the effect of aortic arch reconstruction on left pulmonary artery size based on their anatomic proximity. MethodsThirty-two patients undergoing the Fontan operation, 16 with hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> and 16 with non–hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome,</b> were selected from the multicenter Fontan magnetic resonance imaging database at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The 16 datasets were consecutive with full anatomic reconstructions of the total cavopulmonary connection and aortic arch with no artifacts. The size of the aorta along the transverse arch and left pulmonary artery size in the region below the aortic arch was quantified by using a previously validated skeletonization technique. ResultsThe transverse aortic and left pulmonary artery measurements (median, maximum, and minimum, respectively) for non–hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> were 2. 2, 3. 1, and 1. 5 cm/m and 1. 2, 1. 6, and 0. 2 cm/m, respectively, compared with 2. 5, 4. 1, and 2. 0 cm/m and 0. 9, 1. 5, and 0. 4 cm/m for patients with hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Thus the transverse aortic diameter of patients with hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> was, on average, 24 % greater than that for patients with non–hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> (P <. 05), whereas the left pulmonary artery diameter of patients with hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> was smaller than that of patients with non–hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> (P <. 05). Regression analysis showed a significant negative correlation (P <. 05) between aortic and left pulmonary artery diameters in both the hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> and non–hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> groups. However, when the study population was regrouped into reconstructed aorta and nonreconstructed aorta groups, the negative correlation was only significant for patients with reconstructed aortas, regardless of ventricular pathology (P <. 02).

50|$|Humans {{are born}} with a set number of heart muscle cells, or cardiomyocytes, which {{increase}} in size as heart grows larger during childhood development. Recent evidence suggests that cardiomyocytes are actually slowly turned over as we age, but that less than 50% of the cardiomyocytes we {{are born with}} are replaced during a normal life span. The growth of individual cardiomyocytes not only occurs during normal heart development, it also occurs in response to extensive exercise (<b>athletic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome),</b> heart disease, or heart muscle injury such as after a myocardial infarction. A healthy adult cardiomyocyte has a cylindrical shape that is approximately 100μm long and 10-25μm in diameter. Cardiomyocyte hypertrophy occurs through sarcomerogenesis, {{the creation of new}} sarcomere units in the cell. During heart volume overload, cardiomyocytes grow through eccentric hypertrophy. The cardiomyocytes extend lengthwise but have the same diameter, resulting in ventricular dilation. During heart pressure overload, cardiomyocytes grow through concentric hypertrophy. The cardiomyocytes grow larger in diameter but have the same length, resulting in heart wall thickening.|$|E
50|$|Most {{surgeons}} ask patients about recent general {{medical examination}} results {{in order to}} proceed with surgery 1 even though there are arguments for and against most screening interventions. Advantages include detection and subsequent prevention or early treatment of conditions such as high blood pressure, alcohol abuse, smoking, unhealthy diet, obesity and cancers. Moreover, they could improve the patient-physician relationship and decrease patient anxiety. More and more private insurance companies and even Medicare include annual physicals in their coverage. Some employers require mandatory health checkup before hiring a candidate even though it is now well known that some of the components of the prophylactic annual visit may actually cause harm. For example, lab tests and exams that are performed on healthy patients (as opposed to people with symptoms or known illnesses) are statistically more likely to be “false positives” — that is, when test results suggest a problem that doesn’t exist. Disadvantages cited include the time and money that could be saved by targeted screening (health economics argument), increased anxiety over health risks (medicalisation), overdiagnosis, wrong diagnosis (for example <b>Athletic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> misdiagnosed as Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) and harm, or even death, resulting from unnecessary testing to detect or confirm, often non-existent, medical problems or while performing routine procedures as a followup after screening.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. The <b>athletic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> is {{characterized}} by morphological, functional and electrophysiological alterations as an adaptive response to vigorous physical activity. Athletes heart is predominantly associated with a programmed, intensive training. But as there are different kinds of physical activities, the degree of these changes is highly variable. Electrophysiological characteristics of the athlete's heart. The response {{of the body to}} vigorous physical activity is a multiorgan system phenomenon. The integrated functioning of each of these organ systems is very important, but the cardiovascular system plays a critical role in mediating the activity. Because of that, most changes in the neurohumoral regulation pre- dominantly affect the cardiovascular system. These changes include: depression of sympathetic activity and stimulation of parasympathetic activity, so electrophysiological characteristics of the athlete's heart must differ from the sedentary. Although these facts, are well known, the athlete's heart is not a precisely defined concept. It is a gray zone between physiology and pathology. Conclusion. Considering the number of sudden cardiac deaths in athletes, it is needless to say {{how important it is to}} distinguish physiological changes of the heart due to physical activity, and pathological changes due to some cardiac diseases...|$|E
40|$|Equine {{ventricular}} repolarisation wave can {{be influenced by}} many physiological and pathological factors. T wave abnormalities have been related to a shorter time for ventricular filling, reduced stroke volume, cardiac output and exercise performance in racehorses. The present research performed elec-trocardiographic recordings in 14 four-year-old male Andalusian horses, when they were untrained and {{after three months of}} an aerobic training programme. Leads I, aVF, V 10, V 1 R, V 3 R, V 1 L and V 3 L were used. It was aimed to assess the incidence of abnormal T waves in this breed, according to the criteria of abnormalities established for other equine breeds, to evaluate if the changes induced by training in the T wave are the same that those reported in the <b>athletic</b> <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> in canine and human athletes and, to analyse if the abnormal T waves could have been related to changes in the plasma concentrations of Na, K, and Cl, since these electrolytes are involved in the cardiac electrical processes. It was found out that the incidence of abnormal T waves was quite high in the Andalusian breed, especially in the precordial leads. Moreover, the incidence of abnormal T waves increased in pre-cordial leads and decreased in lead I and aVF after training. The abnormal T waves after training were shorter and had the same voltage, changes which were different to those presented for the athlete’ heart syndrome. The horses with abnormal T waves had higher plasma K concentrations, both before and after training. Plasma Na and Cl concentration at rest decreased after training. Plasma Na concen-trations were positively related to T wave duration and negatively to T wave voltage...|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} 63 {{patients}} with 45 X karyotype (Turner's syndrome) {{admitted to a}} hospital from 1972 to 1985 showed that 20 (32 %) had one or more major cardiac malformations (mostly coarctation and aortic stenosis). Four (20 %) died in the neonatal. One infant had mitral stenosis and severe aortic stenosis and {{died at the age}} of 35 days. The three (15 %) other patients who died had a typical hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome,</b> with an atretic aortic valve in two and pinpoint aortic valve in one. Turner's syndrome was clinically suspected in three of the cases. One of these had mosaicism (46 XX, 45 X) the others had a 45 X pattern. During the same period (1972 - 85) 39 patients (14 girls and 25 boys) were admitted with diagnosis of hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome.</b> Three (21. 4 %) girls had a 45 X karyotype. The high incidence of hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> in Turner's syndrome and of Turner's syndrome in girls with hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> suggests that hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> can be another expression of the 45 X karyotype...|$|R
40|$|To {{identify}} the echocardiographic features {{that can be}} used to distinguish between hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> and other causes of right ventricular overload in the sick neonate cross sectional echocardiographic studies of 10 neonates with hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> were analysed and compared with those in 15 neonates with other causes of right ventricular overload and 15 normal controls. Left ventricular and right ventricular cavity dimensions and the shape and size of the mitral valve annulus and aortic root were recorded and presented both as absolute values (mm) and corrected for body surface area (mm/m 2). Logistic regression was used to produce a classification rule to estimate the probability of a neonate having hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome.</b> The diameter of the mitral valve annulus was the single most discriminative variable. There was, however, considerable overlap of all the calculated features between neonates with hypoplastic left <b>heart</b> <b>syndrome</b> and those with other causes of right ventricular overload.
