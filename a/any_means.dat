5|$|Finally, {{selection}} can {{be classified}} according to the resource being competed for. Sexual selection results from competition for mates. Sexual selection typically proceeds via fecundity selection, sometimes {{at the expense of}} viability. Ecological selection is natural selection via <b>any</b> <b>means</b> other than sexual selection, such as kin selection, competition, and infanticide. Following Darwin, natural selection is sometimes defined as ecological selection, in which case sexual selection is considered a separate mechanism.|$|E

5|$|Forms of {{traditional}} football have been played throughout Europe and beyond since antiquity. Many of these involved {{handling of the}} ball, and scrummage-like formations. These archaic forms of football, typically classified as mob football, would be played between neighboring towns and villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams, who would clash in a heaving mass of people struggling to drag an inflated pig's bladder by <b>any</b> <b>means</b> possible to markers {{at each end of}} a town. By some accounts, in some such events <b>any</b> <b>means</b> could be used to move the ball towards the goal, as long as it did not lead to manslaughter or murder. These antiquated games went into sharp decline in the 19th century when the Highway Act 1835 was passed banning the playing of football on public highways.|$|E

5|$|By 07:40, {{all five}} hijackers were aboard the flight, which was {{scheduled}} to depart at 07:45. Wail and Waleed al-Shehri sat together in first class in seats 2A and 2B respectively. The aircraft taxied away from Gate26, and departed Logan International Airport at 07:59, following a 14-minute delay. Flight11 was hijacked at approximately 08:14, which is when the pilot stopped responding to air traffic control. Once the hijacking began, the brothers are suspected of having stabbed two flight attendants. At 08:46:40, Mohamed Atta deliberately crashed Flight11 into the northern facade of the North Tower (Tower1) of the World Trade Center. The immediate damage destroyed <b>any</b> <b>means</b> of escape from above the impact zone, trapping 1,344people. The North Tower collapsed at 10:28, after burning for 102 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{placed a}} {{symbolic}} emphasis on rebuilding royal authority, but his rule was relatively circumscribed by Magna Carta. He generally acted within {{the terms of}} the charters, which prevented the Crown from taking extrajudicial action against the barons, including the fines and expropriations that had been common under his father, John. The charters did not address the sensitive issues of the appointment of royal advisers and the distribution of patronage, and they lacked <b>any</b> <b>means</b> of enforcement if the King chose to ignore them. The inconsistency with which he applied the charters {{over the course of his}} rule alienated many barons, even those within his own faction.|$|E

5|$|Horticulturists and {{scientists}} Rodger Elliot and David L. Jones {{have proposed that}} cultivating the plant would aid in its conservation. Cultivating the plant would most likely require good water drainage, a sunny or part-shaded position and acidic soil. P.terminalis is hardy to heavy frosts, {{and is expected to}} fare better in a temperate rather than subtropical garden climate. Propagation would theoretically be by seed or by taking cuttings of new growth, though plants of the genus Persoonia as a genus are generally difficult to propagate by <b>any</b> <b>means</b> in cultivation.|$|E
5|$|However, {{while he}} cares {{for the welfare}} of the people and of his family, Vayne is willing to use <b>any</b> <b>means</b> {{necessary}} to maintain order and retain power. He ensures the complete subjugation of Nabradia and Dalmasca and exterminates their royal families in order to acquire their deifacted nethicite. He confronts Dalmasca's resistance movement with absolute ruthlessness, accepting no surrender. He even {{goes so far as to}} murder his own ailing father and frame the Imperial senators, to put an end to their scheming against himself and Larsa, and to level cities in nethicite testing experiments. Vayne's ultimate goal is to free humanity from the control of the Occurians, a race of god-like beings that have for centuries secretly meddled with the course of human history.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, {{militant group}} al Shabaab made a {{strategic}} withdrawal from Mogadishu {{to return to}} hit-and-run tactics. Mayor Mohamed Nur recognized the opportunity as critical to stabilizing and rebuilding the city by <b>any</b> <b>means</b> necessary. Working closely with the UN, USAID, and DRC, Nur's administration also started large-scale rehabilitation of roads and general infrastructure, with residents closely cooperating with the civil and police authorities to tighten up on security. Nur recognized the opportunity to transform Mogadishu although resources were limited. Working closely with urban strategist Mitchell Sipus, the Benadir government sought to design and deploy a data-driven approach to post-war reconstruction.|$|E

5|$|In the {{original}} Ramayana by Valmiki, Trijata {{is described as}} an aged rakshasi (demoness) who is prominently featured in two incidents. The first {{takes place in the}} Sundara Kanda, the epic's fifth book. The kidnapped princess Sita is imprisoned in the Ashoka Vatika of Lanka. The demon-king of Lanka, Ravana has ordered the raskshasis who guard Sita to convince her to marry him by <b>any</b> <b>means</b> possible, since Sita adamantly refuses and is still faithful to her husband Rama. After Ravana leaves, the rakshasis start to harass Sita to compel her to change her will. The aged Trijata intervenes and narrates a prophetic dream that predicts Ravana's doom and Rama's victory.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of the Standard, as the {{encounter}} {{came to be}} called, was a defeat for the Scots. Afterwards, David and his surviving notables retired to Carlisle. Although {{the result was a}} defeat, it was not by <b>any</b> <b>means</b> decisive. David retained the bulk of his army and thus the power to go on the offensive again. The siege of Wark, for instance, which had been going on since January, continued until it was captured in November. David continued to occupy Cumberland as well as much of Northumberland.|$|E

All stairwells and elevators from the 92ndfloor up were rendered impassable, trapping 1,344people. According to the Commission Report, hundreds were killed instantly by the impact; the rest were trapped and died from the subsequent fire and smoke, the eventual collapse, or (in some cases) after jumping or falling from the building. Elevator shafts channeled burning jet fuel through the building. At least one elevator shaft carried burning fuel downward, exploding on the 77thfloor, the 22ndfloor, and at street level on the West Side Lobby.|$|E
5|$|The eldest generational Avatar {{within a}} House is {{dominant}} {{and called the}} Prophet. He possesses blue blood, also called Vitae Divina. The next in line is the Ascendant Prince. Any additional Avatara within the House are Princes ranked by generation. Although Avatara form blood dynasties from father to son, House affiliations can be mixed within a dynasty. If the youngest Prince in a dynasty dies, the dynasty is ended. Most dynasties only last on average three generations, since typical Avatara can be killed by <b>any</b> <b>means.</b> When a dynasty ends, the first male child born {{elsewhere in the world}} with the most Avataric blood will be a new Prince starting a new dynasty.|$|E

Johns (Cole Hauser); the two have had previous encounters. Butcher Bay's warden is a man named Hoxie (Dwight Schultz), while Abbott (Xzibit) is a prison guard disliked by the inmates. The inmate Pope Joe (Willis Burks II) is an insane old man, who lives in the sewer tunnels beneath the prison.|$|E
