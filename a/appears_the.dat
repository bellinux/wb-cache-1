5|$|Hōshō was {{slightly}} damaged {{by a single}} bomb or aerial rocket hit when the Allies attacked Kure again in July 1945. Information is scarce {{on the extent of}} the ship's involvement in the action, but it <b>appears</b> <b>the</b> carrier's participation was minimal, as it embarked no aircraft at the time. Hōshō was repaired within 15 days, but the termination of hostilities in September 1945 found the carrier still docked at Kure.|$|E
5|$|The scoring for {{the home}} version is {{proportionally}} {{identical to the original}} except that each item is worth 1/10th its arcade value, with the bonus Vitamins as the only variation, being worth 100 points, which is the equivalent of the 1000 point scoring melon bonus item that appears in the 7th and 8th levels of the arcade game. Unlike the arcade version, if Pac-Man loses a life while the vitamin <b>appears,</b> <b>the</b> vitamin may not necessarily be forfeited.|$|E
5|$|Ammianus {{puts the}} Alamanni force at around 35,000. This is {{consistent}} with two other figures he gives for Alamannic armies elsewhere in his history: an army of 40,000 in 378; and in 366 an army divided in three, with one division 10,000 strong. Nevertheless, several historians regard Ammianus' figure as unrealistically high. It has been recently suggested that in reality the Alamanni at Strasbourg may have been only about 15,000, {{much the same as}} the Romans. This calculation {{is based on the assumption}} that the average reported size of Alamanni raiding-bands (800 men) represented the maximum manpower of a pagus. For various reasons, the midpoint figure between these two extremes (about 25,000 men) <b>appears</b> <b>the</b> most likely scenario.|$|E

5|$|Arroway falls {{unconscious}} as {{she begins}} traveling back through a wormhole. She awakens {{to find herself}} {{on the floor of}} the pod, the mission control team repeatedly hailing her. She learns that, from outside the machine, it <b>appears</b> <b>the</b> pod merely dropped through the machine's rings and landed in a safety net. Arroway insists that she was gone for approximately 18 hours, but her recording devices show only static. A Congressional Committee is formed and speculates that the Vega signal and machine were a hoax designed by the now-deceased Hadden. Although she cannot prove it happened, Arroway asks the committee to accept the truth of her testimony on faith. In a private conversation, Kitz and White House official Rachel Constantine reflect on confidential information that, although Arroway's recording device only recorded static, it recorded 18 hours of it. Arroway and Joss reunite, and Arroway receives ongoing financial support to expand the SETI program.|$|E

5|$|The {{results of}} the raid are {{difficult}} to judge given the confusion over loss records. It is likely more aircraft were destroyed than listed. The Americans failed to keep a proper record of their losses and it <b>appears</b> <b>the</b> U.S. 8th Air Force losses {{were not included in}} loss totals. When these estimates and figures are added to the losses listed in the table below, {{it is likely that the}} correct figures are 232 destroyed (143 single-engine, 74 twin-engine and 15 four-engine) and 156 damaged (139 single-engine, 12 twin-engine and five four-engine). Researching individual squadron records confirms the destruction of even more USAAF aircraft. This suggests at least a further 16 B-17s, 14 B-24s, eight P-51s, and at least two P-47s were destroyed on top of that total. A total of 290 destroyed and 180 damaged seems a more realistic summation than the conservative figures given by the USAAF, RAF, and RCAF. Including the 15 Allied aircraft shot down and 10 damaged in aerial combat, 305 destroyed and 190 damaged is the sum total of the attack.|$|E
