The system continued to track northeast and strengthened slightly, reaching its peak intensity of 50mph (85km/h) as it approached the Azores that evening. After tracking through the Azores, the storm weakened slightly {{as it moved}} to the north-northeast. Through <b>an</b> <b>interaction</b> with the cold front early on October5 the subtropical storm became extratropical. The system was fully absorbed by the front later that day.

40|$|A Sin 3 -interacting domain (SID) {{originally}} {{described in}} Mad proteins {{is necessary for}} both transcriptional repression and growth suppression by these transcription factors. We recently reported that a structurally and functionally related Mad 1 -like SID is also present in five Sp 1 -like repressor proteins (TIEG 1, TIEG 2, BTEB 1, BTEB 3 and BTEB 4), demonstrating that SID–mSin 3 <b>A</b> <b>interactions</b> have <b>a</b> wider functional impact on transcriptional repression.

It remains to be established, however, whether the SID–mSin 3 <b>A</b> <b>interaction</b> is constitutive or regulated. Here, we describe that the Mad 1 -like SID domain of the Sp 1 -like repressor TIEG 2 is inhibited by the epidermal growth factor (EGF) –Ras–MEK 1 –ERK 2 signaling pathway, via phosphorylation of four serine/threonine sites adjacent to the SID. This phenomenon disrupts the SID–mSin 3 <b>A</b> <b>interaction</b> and thereby inhibits TIEG 2 ’s repression activity.

40|$|We have {{recently}} demonstrated that human apolipoprotein E (apoE) {{is required for}} the infectivity and assembly of hepatitis C virus (HCV) (K. S. Chang, J. Jiang, Z. Cai, and G. Luo, J. Virol. 81 : 13783 - 13793, 2007; J. Jiang and G. Luo, J. Virol. 83 : 12680 - 12691, 2009). In the present study, we have determined the molecular basis underlying the importance of apoE in HCV assembly. Results derived from mammalian two-hybrid studies demonstrate <b>a</b> specific <b>interaction</b> between apoE and HCV nonstructural protein 5 A (NS 5 A). The C-terminal third of apoE per se is sufficient for interaction with NS 5 A. Progressive deletion mutagenesis analysis identified that the C-terminal α-helix domain of apoE is important for NS 5 A binding. The N-terminal receptor-binding domain and the C-terminal 20 amino acids of apoE are dispensable for the apoE-NS 5 <b>A</b> <b>interaction.</b> The NS 5 A-binding domain of apoE was mapped {{to the middle of the}} C-terminal α-helix domain between amino acids 205 and 280. Likewise, deletion mutations disrupting the apoE-NS 5 <b>A</b> <b>interaction</b> resulted in blockade of HCV production. These findings demonstrate that the specific apoE-NS 5 <b>A</b> <b>interaction</b> is required for assembly of infectious HCV. Additionally, we have determined that using different major isoforms of apoE (E 2, E 3, and E 4) made no significant difference in the apoE-NS 5 <b>A</b> <b>interaction.</b> Likewise, these three major isoforms of apoE are equally compatible with infectivity and assembly of infectious HCV, suggesting that apoE isoforms do not differentially modulate the infectivity and/or assembly of HCV in cell culture...|$|R

5|$|Close {{examination}} of the spectral lines reveals that some display a fine structure splitting. This occurs because of spin–orbit coupling, which is <b>an</b> <b>interaction</b> between the spin and motion of the outermost electron. When an atom is in an external magnetic field, spectral lines become split into three or more components; a phenomenon called the Zeeman effect. This {{is caused by the}} interaction of the magnetic field with the magnetic moment of the atom and its electrons. Some atoms can have multiple electron configurations with the same energy level, which thus appear as a single spectral line. The interaction of the magnetic field with the atom shifts these electron configurations to slightly different energy levels, resulting in multiple spectral lines. The presence of an external electric field can cause a comparable splitting and shifting of spectral lines by modifying the electron energy levels, a phenomenon called the Stark effect.|$|E
