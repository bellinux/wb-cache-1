5|$|An {{expert system}} is a program that answers {{questions}} or solves problems about a specific domain of knowledge, using logical rules that are derived from the knowledge of experts. The earliest examples were developed by Edward Feigenbaum <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>students.</b> Dendral, begun in 1965, identified compounds from spectrometer readings. MYCIN, developed in 1972, diagnosed infectious blood diseases. They demonstrated the feasibility of the approach.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, J. Alan Robinson had {{discovered}} a simple method to implement deduction on computers, the resolution and unification algorithm. However, straightforward implementations, like those attempted by McCarthy <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>students</b> in the late 60s, were especially intractable: the programs required astronomical numbers of steps to prove simple theorems. A more fruitful approach to logic {{was developed in the}} 1970s by Robert Kowalski at the University of Edinburgh, and soon this led to the collaboration with French researchers Alain Colmerauer and Philippe Roussel who created the successful logic programming language Prolog.|$|E
5|$|In February 1999, David Protess, a Northwestern University journalism professor, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>students</b> were {{studying}} cases {{of people on}} death row. They discovered evidence related to Death Row inmate Anthony Porter that might help exonerate him. The students produced four affidavits and a videotaped statement that attributed guilt for the crime to another suspect. They obtained recantations by some witnesses of their testimony at trial. One witness claimed that he named Anthony Porter as a suspect only after police officers threatened, harassed and intimidated him into doing so.|$|E

5|$|At the Tenkaichi Budōkai {{three years}} later Goku and his allies oppose Kame-Sen'nin's rival and Taopaipai's brother, Tsuru-Sen'nin, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>students</b> Tenshinhan and Chaozu. Kuririn is killed after the tournament and Goku tracks down and is {{defeated}} by his killer, Piccolo Daimao. The samurai Yajirobe takes Goku to the hermit Karin, where he receives healing and a power boost. Meanwhile, Piccolo fights Kame-Sen'nin and Chaozu, leading to both their deaths, and uses the Dragon Balls to regain his youth before destroying Shenlong. Goku then kills Piccolo Daimao, who, just before dying, spawns his son/reincarnation Piccolo. Karin then directs Goku to Kami-sama, the original creator of the Dragon Balls, to restore Shenlong and revive his slain friends. Goku trains under Kami {{for the next three}} years, once again reuniting with his friends at the Tenkaichi Budōkai, where he narrowly wins against Piccolo before leaving with Chi-Chi to keep his promise to marry her.|$|E
5|$|San Giacomo Scossacavalli (San Giacomo a Scossacavalli) was {{a church}} in Rome {{important}} for historical and artistic reasons. The church, facing the Piazza Scossacavalli, was built during the early Middle Ages and since the early 16th century hosted a confraternity which commissioned Renaissance architect Antonio da Sangallo the Younger {{to build a new}} shrine. This was richly decorated with frescoes, painted (among others) by mannerist artist Giovanni Battista Ricci <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>students.</b> The church was demolished in 1937, when Via della Conciliazione (the avenue leading to St. Peter's Basilica) was built and the piazza and central part of the Borgo rione were demolished. Many decorative elements still exist, since they were preserved from demolition.|$|E
5|$|Three {{years later}} at the Tenkaichi Budōkai, Goku and his allies oppose Kame-Sen'nin's rival and Taopaipai's brother, Tsuru-Sen'nin, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>students</b> Tenshinhan and Chaozu. Kuririn is killed after the tournament; Goku tracks down, but is {{defeated}} by, the murderer's leader, Piccolo Daimao. The samurai Yajirobe takes Goku to the hermit Karin where he receives healing and a power boost. Meanwhile, Piccolo defeats and kills Kame-Sen'nin and Chaozu before using the Dragon Balls to regain his youth and destroy Shenlong. Goku then kills Piccolo Daimao, who, before dying, spawns his son/reincarnation Piccolo. Karin then directs Goku to Kami, the original creator of the Dragon Balls and Piccolo Daimao's other half, to restore Shenlong and revive his slain friends. Goku trains under Kami {{for the next three}} years, once again reuniting with his friends at the Tenkaichi Budōkai. There, he defeats Piccolo, whose life he spares as it would also kill Kami. Goku leaves with Chi-Chi to keep his promise to marry her.|$|E

5|$|Burke and Hare's next {{victim was}} a {{familiar}} figure {{in the streets of}} Edinburgh, James Wilson, an 18-year-old man with a limp caused by deformed feet. He was mentally disabled and, according to Alanna Knight in her history of the murders, was inoffensive; he was known locally as Daft Jamie. Wilson lived on the streets and supported himself by begging. In November Hare lured Wilson to his lodgings with the promise of whisky, and sent his wife to fetch Burke. The two murderers led Wilson into a bedroom, the door of which Margaret Hare locked before pushing the key back under the door. As Wilson did not like whisky—he preferred snuff—he was not as drunk as most of the duo's victims; he was also strong, and fought back against the two attackers, but was overpowered and killed in the normal way. His body was stripped and his few possessions stolen: Burke kept a snuff box and Hare a snuff spoon. When the body was examined the following day by Knox <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>students,</b> several of them recognised it to be Wilson, but Knox denied it could be anyone the students knew. When word started circulating that Wilson was missing, Knox dissected the body ahead of the others that were being held in storage; the head and feet were removed before the main dissection.|$|E

25|$|In 1941, Tarski {{published}} an important paper on binary relations, which began {{the work on}} relation algebra and its metamathematics that occupied Tarski <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>students</b> {{for much of the}} balance of his life. While that exploration (and the closely related work of Roger Lyndon) uncovered some important limitations of relation algebra, Tarski also showed (Tarski and Givant 1987) that relation algebra can express most axiomatic set theory and Peano arithmetic. For an introduction to relation algebra, see Maddux (2006). In the late 1940s, Tarski <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>students</b> devised cylindric algebras, which are to first-order logic what the two-element Boolean algebra is to classical sentential logic. This work culminated in the two monographs by Tarski, Henkin, and Monk (1971, 1985).|$|E
