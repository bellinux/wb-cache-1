40|$|The {{scanning}} beam riometer at Syowa Station, Antarctica (66. 1 °inv. lat.) detected drift of <b>auroral</b> <b>absorptions</b> during a severe geomagnetic storm in February 1986. Eastward drifts predominated {{in the morning}} sector (0600 - 0930 MLT) on February 8, 1986,with speeds ranging from 1. 0 to 3. 8 km/s. These drift velocities are considerably greater than those (60 - 700 m/s) obtained under a moderately disturbed condition reported by T. KIKUCHI et al. (Ann. Geophys., 8, 431, 1990) while the drift direction was the same for both cases. The eastward drift takes place with {{a decrease in the}} geomagnetic H-component, with its speed being proportional to the H-component deflection from the quiettime level. It is suggested that both the absorption drift and ionospheric currents are subjected to a common earthward electric field in the magnetosphere. Therefore, the high drift velocity may indicate an intensification of the electric field in the magnetosphere...|$|R
40|$|A rapid {{onset of}} <b>auroral</b> <b>absorptions</b> was {{simultaneously}} recorded by {{a chain of}} standard riometers, situated in {{the northern and southern}} magneto-conjugate areas, during a period of pronounced substorm activity. The first absorption peak was followed by sequential disturbance patterns in the occurrence of the F-region parameters, virtual height (h′F) and spread - F, as deduced from the standard ionosonde data obtained over a wide range of latitudes in both hemispheres. The disturbances were consistent with the simultaneous occurrences of separate trains of large-scale ionospheric disturbances (TIDs), propagating equatorwards from the southern and northern auroral zones. It is suggested that TIDs were generated by an impulse-like increase in the conjugate particle precipitations, inferred from the riometer records. The precipitation pattern was limited to a high-latitude shell whose equatorwards edge was contained between L-values 5. 0 and 5. 3.

Since spatial coverage of the data precludes a detailed morphology determination, use was made as guideline at all stages of an <b>auroral</b> <b>absorption</b> model derived for the Northern Hemisphere (NH). The day-to-day variability was first determined from cumulative amplitude-probability distributions calculated for a given hour at a given location for a range of geophysical conditions. These distributions are found to be well represented by log-normal distributions for most locations, times-of-day and solar and geomagnetic activity levels, over the range of absorption for which values are more accurate (typically 0. 3 dB or above). Furthermore, parameters of log-normal distributions are found to be related following a known simple expression, so as to permit full specification of any distribution by a single parameter. Both these results are found to be consistent with the NH counterparts. Then time-of-day dependencies were determined for several distribution parameters. These were also found to show the same features than in the NH except for locations near the so-called South Atlantic Anomaly of the geomagnetic field. Determination of latitude and longitude dependencies are only possible when due account is taken of the widening and equator ward movement of the <b>auroral</b> <b>absorption</b> zone with increasing geomagnetic activity level. Assuming Gaussian latitude dependencies apply for all hours, longitude factors are determined so as to be consistent with observed geomagnetic activity level dependencies of absorption distribution parameters for the different longitudes. These factors lead to longitude dependence, which is consistent with theoretical and empirical evidence from other phenomena. This result seems to be different from that that holds for the NH. 1...|$|E

Additional riometer data, from two more auroral stations (Syowa Base, (L-value = 6. 1) and Kiruna, L-value = 5. 4), were used to deduce the drift velocities of the absorption events. It is evident that the SAI events tend to occur closely in time at the conjugate stations before the local magnetic midnight. They propagate mainly westward with average velocities 2. 7 4. 5 km s 1.

40|$|International audienceUnusually large-amplitude morning Pc 5 {{magnetic}} pulsations {{during the}} recovery {{phase of the}} huge magnetic storm in November 2003 have been studied by using ground-based multi-point observations. Two main spectral Pc 5 enhancements were observed: at f? 2 mHz, which featured slowly increasing frequency with decreasing latitude, and at f? 3 mHz, which was latitude independent. The Pc 5 pulsations were observed at wide range of latitudes (more than 10 °) with the same very strong amplitude (up to 500 nT) and with the same polarization. Only the 3 -mHz peak was clearly seen in the spectra of pulsating <b>auroral</b> radio <b>absorption,</b> as observed by the Finnish riometer chain. Short and localized bursts of PiB (f~ 50 ? 100 mHz) magnetic pulsations and simultaneous short bursts of energetic electron precipitation were observed in the morning sector, as well. The beginning of the large-amplitude morning Pc 5 activity occurred simultaneously with a substorm onset {{in the evening and}} midnight sectors. However, the spectra of pulsations in the morning and evening sectors were different. They were compared with spectra of IMF and solar wind parameters, measured by ACE spacecraft. The similarity between the spectra of morning Pc 5 and IMF B y was found, but the spectra of evening Pi 3 pulsations were similar to the spectra of solar wind density variations. The Pc 5 and PiB pulsations, as well as bursts of the <b>auroral</b> radio <b>absorption,</b> suddenly disappeared, when the solar wind density abruptly dropped. We suppose that the ~ 2 -mHz Pc 5 geomagnetic pulsations could be attributed to field line resonance (FLR), however, the 3 -mHz oscillations were apparently non-resonance origin. Keywords.

It is found that at low and moderate levels of activity the incidence of events in the winter season is at least twice that in the summer. However, at high activity no events at all occurred during the local summer night, which appears to be explicable as the effect of the magnetotail and the consequent distortion of the magnetosphere when the southern polar region is tilted strongly towards the Sun.

40|$|Analysis {{of cosmic}} noise {{absorption}} data from South Pole (L≈ 14) and Siple (75. 6 °S, 83. 6 °W, L= 4. 2), Antarctica, (a pair of stations {{on opposite sides}} of the latitude of maximum auroral activity) has revealed important differences in the statistics of auroral radio absorption at the two locations. At Siple, there is a general tendency for summer absorption levels to be higher than the absorption in winter (especially around local magnetic noon), but the data (1975, 1980, 1982) show significant year-to-year variations in the diurnal patterns of absorption. The diurnal patterns at South Pole also exhibit year-to-year variations (1982 - 1985) but they are very different from those at Siple, and the winter/summer relationship also changes from year to year. However, the regular trend in the South Pole variations suggests that they may be subject to a form of solar-cycle control not apparent at Siple. A second difference has to do with the occurrence statistics : while at Siple the occurrence-frequency distribution departs significantly from a log-normal relation (a relation commonly adopted to characterize the cumulative amplitude-probability distribution of <b>auroral</b> <b>absorption),</b> the South Pole distributions are closer to a log-normal and the two sets of distributions can have substantially different trends above about 1 dB. Comparison with seasonal and annual means of the geomagnetic Ap index suggests that <b>auroral</b> <b>absorption</b> at Siple is more strongly correlated with Ap than is absorption at South Pole. In addition to their relevance for high latitude radio communication circuits, these observations may also have implications for auroral zone physics and morphology and also for magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions...|$|E

The auroral emission spectrum {{is similar to that}} of Jupiter, showing H 2 band emission and H Lyman-alpha emission. Saturn's auroral, dayglow, and nightglow spectra show significant differences.

The relationship was studied for different types of auroras, i. e., (1) Poleward expanding arc in the evening hours, (2) Equatorward drifting arc embedded in homogeneous background aurora at midnight hours, and (3) Pulsating aurora in the post break-up phase. For case (1), a region of strong absorption was found to propagate poleward with a poleward expanding arc. However, the absorption area extended to the lower latitude side of a poleward-moving arc due to a longer remaining of the absorption even after the disappearance of visible aurora. For case (2), little absorption accompanied with discrete auroras. However, a better coincidence was found between absorption and homogeneous background aurora. For case (3), temporal variation of the both phenomena showed one-to-one correspondence, although the luminosity of auroras was much weaker than in the other cases...|$|R

Spatially resolved spectra at ∼ 12 Å spectral resolution have been collected at different local times from dawn to dusk to {{determine the amount of}} hydrocarbon absorption. For this purpose, the HST telescope slewed across the auroral oval from mid-latitudes up to beyond the limb while collecting spectral data in the timetag mode. Spectral images of the north ultraviolet aurora were obtained within minutes and hours with the UVIS spectrograph on board Cassini. Several daytime sectors and one nightside location were observed and showed signatures of weak absorption by methane present in (or above) the layer of the <b>auroral</b> emission. No <b>absorption</b> from other hydrocarbons (e. g. C 2 H 2) has been detected. For the absorbed spectra, the overlying slant CH 4 column varies from 3 x 1015 to 2 x 1016 cm- 2, but no clear dependence on local time is identified. A Monte Carlo electron transport model is used to calculate the vertical distribution of the H 2 emission and to relate the observed spectra to the energy of the primary auroral electrons. Assuming electron precipitation with a Maxwellian energy distribution into a standard model atmosphere, we find that the mean energy ranges from less than 3 to ∼ 10 keV. These results are compared with previous determinations of the energy of Saturn’s aurora based on ultraviolet spectra and limb images. We conclude that the energies derived from spectral methods indicate a wide range of electron energies while the nightside limb images suggest that the auroral precipitation is consistently soft. We emphasize the need for more realistic model atmospheres with temperature and hydrocarbon distributions appropriate to high-latitude conditions. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Several observed spectra exhibit sharply enhanced resolution. We interpret this as bright auroral emission foreshortened on the morning limb with a maximum intensity at least as high as 2000 kR. We have searched for evidence that the primary precipitating particles exciting the aurora include the heavy ions known to exist in Jupiter's plasma torus and magnetosphere. We have also searched for such ambient heavy ions and neutrals at rest in the auroral ionosphere, the end products of previous precipitation, excited by the auroral cascade. We argue that primary emission would be characterized by a dramatically Doppler-broadened (similar to 10 - 15 Angstrom) and redshifted line profile resulting from the cascade process and the angle between the line of sight and the magnetic field lines in the atmosphere. In contrast, ambient emission would be distinguished by narrow emission lines. We have modeled the theoretical sulfur and oxygen line shapes for ion precipitation and conclude that electron precipitation is responsible for most of the H- 2 emissions. O ions contributed < 13 % of the precipitating energy flux, and S ions contributed < 50 %. This dominance suggests that field-aligned magnetospheric currents are more important than energetization of energetic ions and subsequent scattering by plasma waves as a mechanism for generating the Jovian aurora. We set an upper limit over our spectra of 35 - 43 R to the emission from ambient oxygen and sulfur ions and their neutrals, except that for the S II 1256 triplet, the upper limit for the nominally brightest line, at 1260 Angstrom, is 74 R. Hence, we find no evidence for the accumulation of sulfur in the auroral ionosphere. A single narrow emission line from an unidentified ambient specie near 1254 Angstrom may be detected at the 4 sigma level, introducing the possibility of complex auroral aeronomy. Differences were observed in the <b>auroral</b> spectral hydrocarbon <b>absorption</b> at different locations, which cannot be interpreted without ambiguity between auroral and atmospheric structural causes.

The results confirm earlier observations made at a high latitude station, but with the fast time constant of the recording system {{a wide variety of}} detailed interrelationships between the various phenomena have been revealed. In particular, although variations in the micropulsation activity and the absorption record correspond very closely once an event is underway, the micropulsation activity nearly always precedes the onset of absorption by an amount which varies significantly for event to event...|$|E
40|$|Researchers at the University of Leicester, Lancaster University and St Petersburg State University have {{developed}} various models {{that can be}} employed in HF radio propagation predictions. Signal coverage predictions make use of numerical ray tracing to estimate the ray paths through a model ionosphere that includes various ionospheric features prevalent at high latitudes (in particular patches, arcs, ionisation tongue, auroral zone irregularities and the mid-latitude trough). Modelling of D-region absorption is also included. GOES satellites provide information on X-ray flux (causing shortwave fadeout during solar flares) and precipitating energetic proton flux which correlates strongly with Polar Cap Absorption (PCA). Solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field measurements from the ACE or DSCOVR spacecraft provide geomagnetic index estimates used to model the location of both <b>auroral</b> <b>absorption</b> and the proton rigidity cutoff boundary that defines the latitudinal extent of PCA during solar proton events (SPE). This paper presents measurements and associated modelling for a 9 day period...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparison}} {{has been}} made between radio absorption events observed by riometer at selected times of day and bursts of electrons observed in the midnight sector by THEMIS satellites. The correlation {{is found to be}} good for absorption in the noon and midnight sectors but poor around dawn and dusk. For noon and midnight the absorption can be estimated from the THEMIS electron flux to better than a factor of 2 in most cases. In the noon sector the absorption follows the THEMIS event by about 30 min on average (though with considerable variation from case to case), but by night the absorption precedes the electron flux by about 8 min on average. Thus, the flux at THEMIS can be predicted from the absorption in the night sector, the accuracy being better than a factor of 3 in most cases. The flux observed also depends on the location of the satellite, reducing with increasing distance down the tail. It is estimated that the source of the tail events observed in this study was at about 6 Re, and comparisons are made with the established general pattern of the substorm in <b>auroral</b> <b>absorption...</b>|$|E
40|$|International audienceCosmic {{radio noise}} {{absorption}} (CNA) events associated with equatorward drifting arcs during a substorm growth phase are studied by using simultaneous optical auroral, IRIS imaging riometer and EISCAT incoherent scatter radar measurements. The CNA is generally attributed to energetic particle precipitation in the D-region. However, {{it has been}} argued that plasma irregularities or enhanced electron temperature (T e) in the E-region could also produce CNA. Both of the latter mechanisms are related to intense electric fields in the ionosphere. We present two events which occur during a substorm growth phase in the evening MLT sector. In both of the events, an auroral arc is drifting equatorward, together with a region of CNA (<b>auroral</b> <b>absorption</b> bay) located on the equatorward side and outside of the arc. Both of the events are associated with enhanced D-region electron density on the equatorward side of the auroral arc, but in the second event, a region of intense electric field and enhanced electron temperature in the E-region is also located on the equatorward side of the arc. We show that in the studied events neither plasma instabilities nor enhanced T e play a significant role in producing the measured CNA, but the CNA in the vicinity of the equatorward drifting arcs is produced by D-region energetic electron precipitation.

40|$|For {{the first}} time we produce {{high-resolution}} maps of the characteristic energy of precipitating electrons from ground-based instrumentation in the auroral zone over northern Scandinavia. This is done by combining intensity-calibrated optical data at 557. 7 nm from the Digital All-Sky Imager (DASI) with <b>auroral</b> <b>absorption</b> images from the Imaging Riometer for Ionospheric Studies (IRIS). Energy maps are produced with high temporal (10 s) and spatial (10 km) resolution within a common geographic area of 240 × 240 km. Both IRIS and DASI have the European Incoherent Scatter (EISCAT) radar within their common field of view. EISCAT is capable of making accurate measurements of the electron density height profile which, with the assistance of an atmospheric model, are inverted into equivalent energy spectra of the flux of precipitating electrons. However, incoherent scatter radars generally have a very small field of view (< 1 °), making studies of the energy spectrum of the precipitating particles over a wide field of view impractical. Since IRIS and DASI are sensitive to high- and medium-energy electrons, respectively, EISCAT data are used to calibrate the characteristic energy of the precipitating particles for an assumed energy spectrum against a combination of IRIS and DASI data. This empirical calibration is then used throughout the common field of view of IRIS and DASI. An initial study illustrates the spatial relationship between the different energy ranges during a substorm onset and illustrates a new way to interpret auroral phenomena...|$|E
40|$|The <b>auroral</b> <b>absorption</b> spike event, {{occurring}} generally at {{the onset}} of a substorm, is distinguished by its high intensity and short duration. This paper reports the presence of a fine structure within the spike event. Analysis of selected examples using the Morlet wavelet shows that within the 1 – 2 min duration of the spike are significant modulations with periodicities in the bands 15 – 60 s (67 – 16 mHz), and 5 – 10 s (200 – 100 mHz), the former being the stronger. The slower fluctuations can amount to more than 10 % of the absorption, and they were observed in every example (seven out of nine) in which the spike was moving poleward. They were absent in the other two cases, when the spike moved equatorward. In the examples studied, the 15 – 60 s absorption pulsations were accompanied by magnetic micropulsations of impulsive type (Pi) having a periodity that was similar or harmonically related. The connection is only close while the spike event is moving. Consideration of the details suggests that both the magnetic and the absorption pulsations are related to the acceleration process at substorm onset, the flux of energetic particles into the auroral zone producing the radio absorption being modulated with, though not by, the geomagnetic field variations. The 5 – 10 s pulsations, which are considerably weaker, appeared in both the absorption and the magnetic records, but in this case with no obvious connection between them...|$|E
40|$|Observations by a 7 x 7 -beam imaging {{riometer}} in Kilpisj 4 rvi, Finland (66 ° MLAT) of the drifting {{cosmic noise}} absorption (CNA) {{structures in the}} morning sector near the zonal drift reversals are presented. The examination of the absorption intensity images revealed several regions with enhanced CNA (absorption patches) slowly drifting through the riometer field of view (FoV). The absorption patches were found to vary in shape, orientation (for elongated arc-like patches), and drift direction. The latter was calculated from the regression lines to positions of the absorption maxima in the FoV images and compared with the direction of electrojet plasma flow from horizontal magnetic perturbations and (for one event) tristatic ion drift velocities in the F-region. A reasonable agreement was found between these directions both in point-by-point comparisons {{and in terms of}} direction reversal timings. The absorption patches of lower intensity appear to have smaller drift velocities and to be associated with weaker magnetic perturbations. These results are consistent with the notion that relatively slow motions of the <b>auroral</b> <b>absorption</b> near the zonal drift reversals are associated with the drift of the entire magnetic flux tube as opposed to the gradient-curvature drift of energetic electrons injected into the ionosphere at the substorm onset. The absorption drift velocity magnitude, on the other hand, was found to be substantially lower than that of the plasma flow {{based on the results of}} limited comparison with tristatic ion drift measurements. A comparison of the drift directions with those of the patch elongation showed that a considerable number of patches had these directions close to each other. Using this observation, we demonstrate a satisfactory agreement between the patch drift velocities (both in direction and magnitude) as determined from the absorption images and keograms under the assumption that some patches were propagating in a direction that was significantly different from the perpendicularity to elongation...|$|E
40|$|Aircraft {{operating}} on trans-polar routes require reliable HF (3 - 30 MHz) radio communications links {{to be maintained}} throughout each flight. However, solar flares and interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICME) can often result in enhancements of the electron density in the Earth’s ionosphere, which can strongly attenuate HF radio waves in the Polar Regions. In some cases this can result in the cancellation or diversion of flights for periods of several days. This paper describes the scientific basis for an online service for airlines that predicts HF radio coverage for polar flight routes by combining nowcast maps of HF absorption in the lower (D-region) ionosphere with ray-tracing radio propagation algorithms. The absorption maps are generated by assimilating real-time measurements of cosmic radio noise absorption from 25 ‘relative ionospheric opacity meters’ (riometers) deployed across Canada and Scandinavia. These data are combined with real-time X-ray flux and energetic (1 - 100 MeV) proton flux measurements from the NASA / NOAA Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites. The effect of geomagnetic shielding of solar protons (which limits HF absorption at lower latitudes) {{and the location of}} the <b>auroral</b> <b>absorption</b> zones (which result from magnetospheric electron precipitation) are also parameterised and optimised using indices of geomagnetic activity. The latter are determined either from ground-based magnetometers or predicted from real-time Solar Wind / Interplanetary Magnetic Field measurements from the NASA / NOAA Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) stationed at the L 1 Earth-Sun Lagrange point. The performance of the real-time HF absorption model is demonstrated using several days of data recorded during a recent solar proton event and subsequent geomagnetic storm. The new data assimilation model reduces the root-mean-square error in riometer absorption by up to 30 % in comparison with NOAA’s standard D-region Absorption Prediction (DRAP) model...|$|E
