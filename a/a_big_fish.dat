500|$|Orion Pictures did {{not have}} faith in The Terminator {{performing}} well {{at the box office}} and feared a negative critical reception. At an early screening of the film, the actors' agents insisted to the producers that the film should be screened for critics. Orion only held one press screening for the film. The film premiered on October 26, 1984. On its opening week, The Terminator played at 1,005 theaters and grossed $4.0 million making it number one in the box office.

500|$|The {{reconciliation}} of the father-son relationship between Edward and William {{is the key}} theme in Big Fish. Novelist Daniel Wallace's interest in {{the theme of the}} father-son relationship began with his own family. Wallace found the [...] "charming" [...] character of Edward Bloom similar to his father, who used charm to keep his distance from other people. In the film, Will believes Edward has never been honest with him because Edward creates extravagant myths about his past to hide himself, using storytelling as an avoidance mechanism. Edward's stories are filled with fairy tale characters (a witch, mermaid, giant, and werewolf) and places (the circus, small towns, the mythological city of Spectre), all of which are classic images and archetypes. The quest motif propels both Edward's story and Will's attempt {{to get to the bottom}} of it. Wallace explains: [...] "The father's quest is to be <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>fish</b> in a big pond, and the son's quest is to see through his tall tales." ...|$|E

In the summer of 1996, O'Neal was named to the United States Olympic {{basketball}} team, and was later part of the gold medal-winning team at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. While the Olympic basketball team was training in Orlando, the Orlando Sentinel published a poll that asked whether the Magic should fire Hill if that were one of O'Neal's conditions for returning. 82% answered [...] "no". O'Neal had a power struggle while playing under Hill. He said the team [...] "just didn't respect [...]" [...] Another question in the poll asked, [...] "Is Shaq worth $115million?" [...] in reference to the amount of the Magic's offer. 91.3% of the response was [...] "no". O'Neal's Olympic teammates rode him hard over the poll. He was also upset that the Orlando media implied O'Neal was not a good role model for having a child with his longtime girlfriend with no immediate plans to marry. O'Neal compared his lack of privacy in Orlando to [...] "feeling like <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>fish</b> in a dried-up pond." [...] O'Neal also learned that Hardaway considered himself the leader of the Magic and did not want O'Neal making more money than him. On the team's first full day at the Olympics in Atlanta, it was announced that O'Neal would join the Los Angeles Lakers on a seven-year, $121million contract. He insisted he did not choose Los Angeles for the money. [...] "I'm tired of hearing about money, money, money, money, money", O'Neal said after the signing. [...] "I just want to play the game, drink Pepsi, wear Reebok", he added, referring to a couple of his product endorsements. The Lakers won 56 games during the 1996–97 season. O'Neal averaged 26.2 points and 12.5 rebounds in his first season with Los Angeles; however, he again missed over 30 games due to injury. The Lakers made the playoffs, but were eliminated in the second round by the Utah Jazz in five games. In his first playoff game for the Lakers, O'Neal scored 46 points against the Portland Trail Blazers, the most for the Lakers in a playoff game since Jerry West had 53 in 1969. On December 17, 1996, O'Neal shoved Dennis Rodman of the Chicago Bulls; Rodman's teammates Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan restrained Rodman and prevented further conflict. The Los Angeles Daily News reported that O'Neal was willing to be suspended for fighting Rodman, and O'Neal said: [...] "It's one thing to talk tough and one thing to be tough." ...|$|E
