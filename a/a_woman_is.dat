5|$|Angelou {{does not}} begin to create her own {{narrative}} until The Heart of a Woman, which depends less upon the conventions of fiction than her previous books. For example, there is less dialog and fewer dramatic episodes. The Heart of <b>a</b> <b>Woman</b> <b>is</b> more uplifting than its predecessors due to Angelou's resolution of her conflict between her duties as {{a mother and her}} success as a performer.|$|E
5|$|If <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> untreated, {{two years}} of {{breastfeeding}} results in an HIV/AIDS risk in her baby of about 17%. Treatment decreases this risk to 1 to 2% per year. Due to the increased risk of death without breastfeeding in many areas in the developing world, the World Health Organization recommends either: (1) the mother and baby being treated with antiretroviral medication while breastfeeding being continued (2) the provision of safe formula.|$|E
5|$|Portrait of a Lady (or Portrait of <b>a</b> <b>Woman)</b> <b>is</b> a small oil-on-oak panel {{painting}} executed around 1460 by the Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden. The {{composition is}} built from the geometric shapes {{that form the}} lines of the woman's veil, neckline, face, and arms, and by the fall of the light that illuminates her face and headdress. The vivid contrasts of darkness and light enhance the almost unnatural beauty and Gothic elegance of the model.|$|E

Who knows? Perhaps that love is similar to the one told in love stories and talked about by people. Velvet ...|$|R

5|$|The Heart of <b>a</b> <b>Woman</b> <b>is</b> {{the first}} time Angelou {{identifies}} with another female African-American writer. Her early literary influences were men, including James Weldon Johnson, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, and William Shakespeare. Angelou has stated that she always admired women writers like Anne Spencer, Jessie Fauset, Nella Larsen, and Zora Neale Hurston. Her choice of title for this book is an acknowledgment of her legacy as a Black woman writer.|$|E
5|$|Underwire bras, {{like other}} constrictive garments, may {{contribute}} to clogged milk ducts in lactating women. Fluctuating breast size during pregnancy poses another problem. Because underwire bras are rigid, they do not easily accommodate changes in breast size, and an ill-fitting bra that {{does not support the}} breasts correctly can cause discomfort and pain. For several days after a mastectomy, or as long as the breast is tender, <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> advised not to use an underwire bra.|$|E

5|$|However, in Scotland {{and parts}} of {{northern}} England near the Scottish border, beliefs in elves remained prominent into the nineteenth century. James VI of Scotland and Robert Kirk discussed elves seriously; elf-beliefs are prominently attested in the Scottish witchcraft trials, particularly the trial of Issobel Gowdie; and related stories also appear in folktales, There is a significant corpus of ballads narrating stories about elves, such as Thomas the Rhymer, where a man meets a female elf; Tam Lin, The Elfin Knight, and Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight, in which an Elf-Knight rapes, seduces, or abducts a woman; and The Queen of Elfland's Nourice, <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> abducted to be a wet-nurse to the elf-queen's baby, but promised that she may return home once the child is weaned.|$|E
5|$|Mandodari is {{described}} as a beautiful woman in Valmiki's Ramayana. When Hanuman, the monkey messenger of Rama, comes to Lanka in search of Sita, he is stupefied by Mandodari's beauty when he enters Ravana's bed chambers and mistakes Mandodari for Sita. When Hanuman finally finds Sita, he finds Ravana threatening to kill Sita unless she marries him. Ravana raises his sword to behead Sita when she refuses. Mandodari saves Sita by holding Ravana's hand. Mandodari says that the murder of <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> a heinous sin and thus Ravana should not kill Sita. She asks Ravana to entertain himself with his other wives and give up the idea of having Sita as his wife. Ravana spares Sita's life, but does not give up his wish to marry Sita. Though Mandodari considers Sita inferior to her in beauty and ancestry, Mandodari acknowledges Sita's devotion to Rama and compares her to goddesses like Sachi and Rohini.|$|E
5|$|The Heart of a Woman (1981) is an {{autobiography}} by American writer Maya Angelou. The {{book is the}} fourth installment in Angelou's series of seven autobiographies. The Heart of a Woman recounts events in Angelou's life between 1957 and 1962 and follows her travels to California, New York City, Cairo, and Ghana as she raises her teenage son, becomes a published author, becomes active {{in the civil rights}} movement, and becomes romantically involved with a South African anti-apartheid fighter. One of the most important themes of The Heart of <b>a</b> <b>Woman</b> <b>is</b> motherhood, as Angelou continues to raise her son. The book ends with her son leaving for college and Angelou looking forward to newfound independence and freedom.|$|E

5|$|The main sub-traditions of Jainism have {{historically}} disagreed, with Digambaras (sky-clad, naked mendicant order) stating that <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> by her nature {{and her body}} unable to practice asceticism, such as by living naked, and therefore she cannot achieve spiritual liberation because of her gender. She can at best, state the Digambara texts, live an ethical life so that she is reborn as {{a man in a}} future life. In this view, she is also viewed a threat to a monk's chastity. In contrast, Svetambaras (white-clad, wear clothes) have interpreted Mahavira's teaching as encouraging both males and females to pursue a mendicant ascetic life with the possibility of moksha (kaivalya, spiritual liberation) regardless of gender.|$|E
5|$|Pembleton (Andre Braugher) and Bayliss (Kyle Secor) {{return to}} the {{homicide}} unit after a rotation in robbery, {{only to find the}} highest murder clearance rate in five years. A delighted Gee (Yaphet Kotto) credits much of the success to the new detectives Stuart Gharty (Peter Gerety) and, particularly, Laura Ballard (Callie Thorne). Lewis (Clark Johnson) asks Gee for a different partner, but dodges questions about problems with his old partner Kellerman (Reed Diamond); Gee assigns him to Falsone (Jon Seda), one of the newer detectives, and Kellerman is partnered with Munch (Richard Belzer). That evening, Gee attends a black-tie dinner honoring his friend Felix Wilson (James Earl Jones), a wealthy businessman and respected Baltimore philanthropist. In that same hotel, <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> found beaten to death in the men's bathroom, and Pembleton and Bayliss are called to investigate. Felix and his wife Regina (Lynne Thigpen) see the body and identify her as Melia Brierre, a Haitian expatriate working as one of their domestic workers. The Wilsons leave after only brief interviews, and Pembleton becomes agitated when Bayliss asks whether Pembleton went easy on them because of his respect for Wilson's contributions to the African American community.|$|E
5|$|The ballads are characterised {{by sexual}} {{encounters}} between everyday people and human(-like) beings {{referred to in}} at least some variants as elves (the same characters also appear as mermen, dwarves, and other kinds of supernatural beings). The elves pose a threat to the everyday community by trying to lure people to into the elves' world. Much the most popular example is Elveskud and its many variants (paralleled in English as Clerk Colvill), where a woman from the elf-world tries to tempt a young knight to join her in dancing, or simply to live among the elves; in some versions he refuses and in some he accepts, but in either case he dies, tragically. As in Elveskud, sometimes the everyday person is a man and the elf a woman, as also in Elvehøj (much the same story as Elveskud, but with a happy ending), Herr Magnus og Bjærgtrolden, Herr Tønne af Alsø, Herr Bøsmer i elvehjem, or the Northern British Thomas the Rhymer. Sometimes the everyday person is a woman and the elf is a man, as in the northern British Tam Lin, The Elfin Knight, and Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight, in which the Elf-Knight bears away Isabel to murder her, or the Scandinavian Harpans kraft. In The Queen of Elfland's Nourice, <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>is</b> abducted to be a wet-nurse to the elf-queen's baby, but promised that she may return home once the child is weaned.|$|E
