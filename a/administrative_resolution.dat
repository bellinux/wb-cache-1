40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the impact of}} the intellectual property (IP) system on the timing of cooperation/licensing by start-up technology entrepreneurs. If the market for technology licenses is efficient, the timing of licensing is independent of whether the patent has already been granted, and productive efficiency considerations will determine license timing (which likely will be as early as possible after invention). In contrast, the need for disclosure of unprotected knowledge {{on the part of the}} inventor, asymmetric information between the licensor and potential licensees, or search costs may retard efficient technology transfer. In these cases, reductions in uncertainty surrounding the scope and extent of IP rights may facilitate trade in the market for ideas. Employing a dataset which combines information about cooperative licensing and the timing of patent allowances (the administrative event when patent rights are clarified), we find that pre-allowance licensing is quite common, occurring in about 27 % of our sample. Furthermore, the <b>administrative</b> <b>resolution</b> of uncertainty over patent rights significantly increases the hazard rate for achieving a cooperative licensing agreement, and this effec...|$|E

40|$|Almost 20 {{years ago}} Congress enacted the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (RRA 98), with the {{intention}} of protecting taxpayers against perceived abuses in tax collection by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). RRA 98 contained provisions creating the so-called collection due process (CDP) provisions. CDP changed existing law by providing taxpayers with a pre-deprivation right to an administrative hearing and judicial review of any proposed collection actions by the IRS such as liens or levies. CDP has been both championed as a valuable mechanism to protect taxpayers from improper collection and criticized as a tool used by taxpayers making meritless arguments to further delay payment of tax. Regardless, the CDP provisions have exacted a toll on the tax administrative system, particularly on the IRS Office of Appeals, which conducts the CDP hearings, and the U. S. Tax Court, which generally has judicial review of the administrative hearings. CDP cases often require a disproportionate share of resources to resolve. One {{reason for this is that}} CDP cases can be messy. CDP cases can involve mistakes or anomalies made by the IRS and are often brought by taxpayers pro se. One particularly messy factual scenario occurs when a taxpayer raises an issue in a non-CDP tax year and asks the IRS and the Tax Court to adjudicate as to the non-CDP year. For example, if a taxpayer alleges that he or she has a credit from a prior year that should carry forward to satisfy a tax liability that remains unpaid or alleges that he or she has made payments that were applied to a non-CDP year that were meant to apply to the CDP year, the Tax Court has struggled with whether and how it can properly exercise jurisdiction over the non-CDP year. This Article makes two novel contributions. First, it highlights how CDP cases can be particularly messy and how the IRS and Tax Court have struggled in resolving CDP cases. In particular, this Article examines the Tax Court 2 ̆ 7 s difficulty in determining its proper jurisdiction in CDP cases in which the taxpayer raises issues in non-CDP years by examining two relevant cases, Freije v. Commissioner and Weber v. Commissioner. Concluding that the Tax Court has properly exercised (or limited) its jurisdiction in both Freije and Weber, this Article reconciles the two cases in light of the purpose of the CDP provisions on the one hand and the Tax Court 2 ̆ 7 s limited jurisdictional grant on the other. Second, this Article makes recommendations to the IRS on how to encourage <b>administrative</b> <b>resolution</b> of messy CDP cases to prevent litigation and reduce the cost of CDP...|$|E

As a quantitative work, the empirical analysis of this paper focuses on strategy selection of private entrepreneurs in resolving administrative disputes for two reasons. First, this paper contributes to expanding {{the scope of the}} issue to all types of disputes resolution in China. In previous quantitative research regarding dispute resolution, 3 class, social networks, clan, region, and political connections have been found to influence the strategy selection in resolving civil disputes (Michelson 2007; Cai 2008; Chen and Wu 2010; Lu and Yang 2010; Fan et al. 2016). Chen (2009) uses CGSS (2005) to reveal the general pattern and major determinants of <b>administrative</b> dispute <b>resolution</b> in contemporary China. However, both quantitative analysis of <b>administrative</b> dispute <b>resolution</b> and the resolution strategies of private entrepreneurs need further analysis. Second, a description and a causal analysis of the model of dispute resolution of private entrepreneurships can benefit the general understanding {{of the relationship between the}} Chinese state and businessmen group. This paper also contributes to deepening and completing our understanding of the state-business relationship in China. Disputes with the governmental administrative agencies essentially are conflicts between state and society, which is a facet of the state-society relationship that has the highest tension.|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} growing {{concern has been}} voiced in the {{environmental}} justice literature regarding the ability of criminal justice mechanisms to adequately address environmental harms, especially when such harms are perpetrated by large corporations. Commentators argue that criminal justice processes are often ill-suited to the particular features of environmental cases, where the chain of causation between wrongful actions/omissions and environmentally harmful consequence can be very complex and extend {{over the course of}} many years. As an alternative, many such commentators now favour the adoption of more <b>administrative</b> <b>resolutions</b> when corporate bodies breach their environmental obligations (which may or may not amount to ‘crimes’). Others favour the use of civil sanction regimes, which is now the preferred approach of the UK Environment Agency. In this paper I will argue that the debate on how best to respond to environmental harm has so far neglected to factor in the perspective of the victims of those harms and, in particular, their need for redress. I will argue that by incorporating such a perspective, as opposed to focusing largely on questions of efficiency and cost-effectiveness, the criminal justice route still has much to recommended it, especially in relation to the provision of meaningful redress and/or compensation to the victims of environmental harm. Consequently, this paper will provide a victimological defence of the criminal justice process, and of criminal penalties, in their application to cases of environmental harms...|$|R

40|$|Using a time-series approach, {{the author}} {{analyzes}} {{the relationship between}} the extent of rent-seeking trade policy and both political and economic variables. For rent-seeking trade policy, the indicator he uses is the number of foreign-trade regulations passed each year for the benefit of a single firm or industry. The author uses data from Uruguay for 1925 - 83. Uruguay, which experienced an impressive economic decline, is an outstanding example of a rent-seeking society. After being a wealthy economy in midcentury, it suffered almost complete stagnation, which led to social and policital disintegration {{by the end of the}} 1960 s. Three decades of restrictive regulations on foreign trade had created a nearly closed economy by the end of the 1960 s. It was worth analyzing whether policymakers'great receptiveness to demands for protection could account for Uruguay's decline. Over the period 1925 - 83, the author finds almost 4, 000 laws, decrees, and <b>administrative</b> <b>resolutions</b> that create, maintain, or modify a foreign-trade regulation for the benefit of a single firm or industry. About half of them explicitly identify the petitioner - usually a firm or guild. Since the size of the Uruguayan economy changed over the period studied, the author scales the annual number of regulations by output or exports to measure the extent of rent-seeking trade policy. The author shows that the extent of rent-seeking trade policy increased with discretionary policies and under dictatorship. (In the period studied, there were two stages of democracy - until 1932 and from 1943 - 72 - and two stages of dictatorship.) He also shows that rent-seeking trade restrictions increased under import-substitution strategies and, more unexpectedly, under active export promotion. This suggests that discretionary power leads to wasteful distribution, whether it is used to support inward- or outward-oriented policies. Finally, the author analyzes the correlation between innovations in the trade policy indicator and innovations in the growth rates of output and exports, with a lag of up to 20 years. Surprisingly, he finds a positive correlation with output growth rates after two or three years. But the correlation becomes negative some years later, particularly in the case of exports. The short-run positive impact on growth rates, together with the surprisingly long time lag before the negative impact, may account for policymakers'receptiveness to demands for protection.
