5|$|In 1959, Syracuse earned {{its first}} National Championship {{following}} an undefeated football season and <b>a</b> <b>Cotton</b> Bowl victory over Texas. The team featured sophomore running back Ernie Davis who, in 1961, {{became the first}} African-American to win the Heisman Trophy. Davis was slated {{to play for the}} Cleveland Browns in the same backfield as Jim Brown, but died of leukemia before being able to play professionally.|$|E

5|$|The {{layout of}} the village largely {{originates}} from manorial times, but during the 19th century the village grew to become a substantial industrial community with lead mining and <b>a</b> <b>cotton</b> mill as the main sources of employment. Since then it has reverted to a rural community, and is {{a focal point for}} walkers and cyclists wishing to enjoy the local countryside.|$|E

5|$|The {{problem of}} obtaining good-quality free-labor {{products}} forced Coffin to travel south {{to seek out}} plantations that did not use slave labor to produce their goods. He met with only limited success. Coffin located <b>a</b> <b>cotton</b> plantation in Mississippi, where the owner had freed all his slaves and hired them as free laborers. The plantation struggled financially because it had no equipment to automate cotton production. Coffin helped the owner purchase <b>a</b> <b>cotton</b> gin that greatly increased the plantation's productivity and provided {{a steady supply of}} cotton for Coffin's association. The cotton was shipped to Cincinnati, where it was spun into cloth and sold. Other trips to Tennessee and Virginia were less successful, although he did succeed in spreading the word about the free-labor goods movement.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{people of}} Chamba {{were known to}} have worn a fine woolen blanket or chadar around the waist, to keep warm in the cold climate. It was often tied or girdled with a band or patka, as {{evidenced}} by some archaeological discoveries in the area depicting this fashion. The Gaddi people have traditionally worn white embroidered caps and loose-fitting white woolen garments known as a chola, tied around the waist with a black wool rope. A local custom in Chamba was to give the Jogi of the Natha sect <b>a</b> <b>cotton</b> maikhal sheet to wear over the head during the Nuwala ceremony to honour Lord Siva. Chamba and the surrounding district have been well documented as being a producer of fine cloth and embroidered dresses for centuries.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{first took}} place in a {{storeroom}} in the industrial district of Shanghai. Having difficulties scouting <b>a</b> <b>cotton</b> factory suitable for shooting, set designers decided to recreate one {{in the style of the}} 1930s. They spent weeks transforming an abandoned storeroom into the Zhen Hua Cotton Mill Factory, a 1930s cotton mill factory founded by Ip's friend Chow Ching-chuen (played in the film by Simon Yam) during the Sino-Japanese War. It was where Ip Man first taught Wing Chun openly to the public.|$|E

5|$|In 1866, Fred {{encountered}} {{two young}} farmers in Connecticut {{who had spent}} time on duty as Union soldiers in Florida during the war. He learned from them that land there was plentiful and cheap, and many recently emancipated blacks were available at low wages to work it. When he shared this information with his mother, Stowe and her husband Calvin Ellis Stowe considered it a prime opportunity to hasten their son's rehabilitation. For $10,000 ($ in 2009) she purchased <b>a</b> <b>cotton</b> plantation near Orange Park, south of Jacksonville, named Laurel Grove, that was originally established by slave trader Zephaniah Kingsley in 1803 and managed in part by his African wife, Anna Madgigine Jai, until 1811.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his deformities, {{at some point during}} his childhood, Merrick suffered a fall and damaged his left hip. This injury became infected and left him permanently lame. Although affected by his physical deformities, Merrick attended school and enjoyed a close relationship with his mother. She was a Sunday school teacher, and his father worked as an engine driver at <b>a</b> <b>cotton</b> factory, as well as running a haberdashery business. On 29 May 1873, less than three years after the death of her youngest son William, Mary Jane Merrick died from bronchopneumonia. Joseph Rockley Merrick moved with his two children to live with Mrs. Emma Wood Antill, a widow with children of her own. They married on 3 December 1874.|$|E
5|$|MacLaren {{was born}} on 1 December 1871 in Whalley Range, a fairly prosperous {{district}} of Manchester, the second of seven sons to James MacLaren and Emily Carver. His father, <b>a</b> <b>cotton</b> merchant and cricket enthusiast, served as honorary treasurer to the Lancashire team from 1881 {{until his death in}} 1900. MacLaren senior encouraged his sons to play cricket. With the aim of improving their ability in the game, MacLaren senior sent Archie and his older brother James to Elstree, a school well-regarded for its coaching.|$|E

5|$|Narrowly escaping, Mike and Debbie {{travel to}} the police station to report the {{incident}} to Debbie's ex-boyfriend, Deputy Dave Hanson (John Allen Nelson), and his curmudgeonly partner, Deputy Curtis Mooney (John Vernon). The skeptical Mooney believes the story to be a hoax. After taking Debbie home, Mike and Dave return to the woods, only to find the circus tent has vanished, leaving a large crater in its place. They then {{travel to the}} lovers' lane, only to find all the cars abandoned and covered in <b>a</b> <b>cotton</b> candy-like substance. Back in town, the klowns arrive and begin capturing townspeople in cocoons using rayguns that resemble toys. Several klowns perform pranks and mock circus acts, all resulting in the deaths of several onlookers.|$|E
5|$|Soon after Flight 825 took off, a {{group of}} ZIPRA guerrillas scored a hit on its {{starboard}} wing with a Soviet-made Strela-2 surface-to-air infrared homing missile, critically damaging the aircraft and forcing an emergency landing. An attempted belly landing in <b>a</b> <b>cotton</b> field just west of Karoi was foiled by a ditch, which caused the plane to cartwheel and break up. Of the 52 passengers and four crew, 38 died in the crash; the insurgents then approached the wreckage, rounded up the 10 survivors they could see and massacred them with automatic gunfire. Three passengers survived by hiding in the surrounding bush, while a further five lived because {{they had gone to}} look for water before the guerrillas arrived.|$|E
5|$|Storm played {{football}} regularly {{and was a}} good skater and swimmer (once swimming the 12.5-mile length of Windermere). Liverpool F.C. used to train at Melwood {{and he went to}} watch them in training, later putting up a large photo of himself training with the team on his wall at home. He was the captain of Mersey Beat magazine's football team, called the Mersey Beat XI. Storm was born with a stutter (a speech impediment), which did not affect his singing. Because of Storm's bad stammer, his friends never allowed him to tell a joke or to order a round of drinks, as it took too long. He became <b>a</b> <b>cotton</b> salesman (as was Jim McCartney, Paul McCartney's father) before forming a skiffle group.|$|E

The nurse recognizes he is lying because they are using band-aids; a frustrated Stanley leaves, and tells Phyllis, {{who is about to}} try the same trick. In the final scene, Creed (Creed Bratton) is seen leaving the blood mobile with a bag of donated blood in his coat pocket.|$|E
5|$|Twenty years later, the ingenue Edna Earle is {{traveling}} by train, {{hoping to find}} employment in <b>a</b> <b>cotton</b> mill {{after the death of}} her father, the village blacksmith. The train derails, and St. Elmo saves her from the burning wreckage. This act sets St. Elmo on the path to salvation as he and Edna slowly fall in love. Initially planning to depart for distant lands, a vision of Christ leads him to aid the impoverished. Freed from the Devil, he becomes a minister and marries Edna.|$|E
5|$|Grimshaw {{was born}} in or around Great Harwood, Lancashire, in 1824 or 1825 {{and was one of}} six {{children}} brought up in a working-class family. His father, Thomas, had a reputation as a radical public speaker {{in the early part of}} the 19th century. Grimshaw initially worked as <b>a</b> <b>cotton</b> weaver before becoming a full-time activist and agitator. He first came to prominence in the village of Royton, near Oldham, in 1852 as a campaigner for the improvement and enforcement of the Factory Acts, to improve the working conditions of those employed in the cotton mills. In the same year he became editor of the anti-Whig broadsheet, the Royton Vindicator. He criticised the suppression of local political activists and supported the alliance of the Chartist movement with the Tories against the Whigs.|$|E

5|$|James Chadwick {{was born}} in Bollington, Cheshire, on 20 October 1891, the first child of John Joseph Chadwick, <b>a</b> <b>cotton</b> spinner, and Anne Mary Knowles, a {{domestic}} servant. He was named James after his paternal grandfather. In 1895, his parents moved to Manchester, leaving him {{in the care of}} his maternal grandparents. He went to Bollington Cross Primary School, and was offered a scholarship to Manchester Grammar School, which his family had to turn down as they could not afford the small fees that still had to be paid. Instead he attended the Central Grammar School for Boys in Manchester, rejoining his parents there. He now had two younger brothers, Harry and Hubert; a sister had died in infancy. At the age of 16, he sat two examinations for university scholarships, and won both of them.|$|E
5|$|The 1913 {{edition of}} the Catholic Encyclopedia lists several {{separate}} accounts of the saint's deeds and miracles, or so-called Lives. The Life (or Vita) printed in John Capgrave's Nova, Legenda and used by the Bollandists, was perhaps copied from <b>a</b> <b>Cotton</b> manuscript in the British Museum. There is another Vita in Latin in the same collection, {{but it was so}} damaged by fire that it is useless. The surviving versions of the Vita Sexburge were compiled after 1106 (the year the relics of Seaxburh were translated) and are copies from an earlier manuscript, now lost. The Vita describes Seaxburh's early life, marriage to Eorcenberht, withdrawal to Milton and then Minster-in-Sheppey, and her final years as a nun and the abbess at Ely. The section relating to her life at Sheppey is similar to another fragment, dating between the 9th and 11th centuries, and currently kept at Lambeth Palace. It has been suggested that part of the Vita Sexburge was derived from this manuscript, or that both parts originated from an earlier version of Seaxburh's Life.|$|E
5|$|The {{purchaser}} in the 1888 {{sale was}} John Bullough, <b>a</b> <b>cotton</b> machinery manufacturer (and self-made millionaire) from Accrington in Lancashire, {{who continued to}} use the island for recreational purposes. In the following year, counties were formally created in Scotland, on shrieval boundaries, by a dedicated Local Government Act; R√πm therefore {{became part of the}} new county of Argyll. When Bullough died in 1891 he was buried on R√πm, in a rock-cut mausoleum, under an octagonal stone tower. His heirs, however, felt that this was beneath his dignity, and demolished it, moving his sarcophagus into an elaborate mausoleum modelled as a Greek temple. Argyll, similarly, was not thought fitting for R√πm, and that same year was moved by boundary review to the county of Inverness, where Eigg already sat.|$|E
