5|$|Most of the German bombers {{had passed}} over {{and had an}} {{altitude}} advantage over French fighters trying to gain height to intercept. Skirmishes were few and far between, but some French units suffered heavy losses. For the attack, the Germans had used the new C-250 Flammbombe (Flame Bomb) which had only been cleared for use 24 hours earlier.

5|$|While {{some areas}} {{improved}} during the Brezhnev era, {{the majority of}} civilian services deteriorated and living conditions for Soviet citizens fell rapidly. Diseases were on the rise because of the decaying healthcare system. The living space remained rather small by First World standards, with the average Soviet person living on 13.4 square metres. Thousands of Moscow inhabitants became homeless, most of them living in shacks, doorways <b>and</b> <b>parked</b> trams. Nutrition ceased to improve in the late 1970s, while rationing of staple food products returned to Sverdlovsk for instance.|$|E
5|$|The {{main unit}} began its work in August 1976 in Sardinia. Don McLaughlan, {{then head of}} public {{relations}} at Lotus Cars, heard that Eon were shopping for a new Bond car. He drove a prototype Lotus Esprit with all Lotus branding taped over, <b>and</b> <b>parked</b> it outside the Eon offices at Pinewood studios; on seeing the car Eon asked Lotus to borrow both of the prototypes for filming. Initial filming of the car chase sequence resulted in disappointing action sequences.

5|$|After the shooting, Saldívar {{entered her}} red 1994 GMC pickup truck {{and tried to}} leave the motel parking lot. Motel {{employee}} Rosario Garza saw Saldívar leave her room with a wrapped towel. It was later {{thought she was going}} to Q-Productions to shoot Quintanilla, Jr. and others who were waiting for Selena. However, she was spotted by a responding police officer in a vehicle. The officer left his vehicle, drew his gun, and ordered Saldívar out of the truck. Saldívar did not comply; she backed up <b>and</b> <b>parked</b> adjacent to two cars. Her truck was then blocked in by the police vehicle. Saldívar picked up the pistol, pointed it at her right temple, and threatened to commit suicide. A SWAT team and the FBI Crisis Negotiation Unit were brought in. Musicologist Himilce Novas later said the event was reminiscent of O.J. Simpson's planned suicide 10 months earlier.|$|E

5|$|Predators {{of giant}} mouse lemurs include the Madagascar buzzard, Madagascar owl, fossa, and the narrow-striped mongoose. Giant mouse lemurs {{reproduce}} once a year, with two offspring born after a 90-day gestation. Babies are initially {{left in the}} nest while the mother forages, but are later carried by mouth <b>and</b> <b>parked</b> in vegetation while she forages nearby. In captivity, giant mouse lemurs will breed year-round. Their lifespan in the wild {{is thought to be}} five to six years. Both species are listed as endangered due to habitat destruction and hunting. Like all lemurs, they are protected under CITES Appendix I, which prohibits commercial trade. Despite breeding easily, they are rarely kept in captivity. The Duke Lemur Center coordinated the captive breeding of an imported collection of the northern species, which rose from six individuals in 1982 to 62individuals by 1989, but the population fell to six by 2009 and was no longer considered a breeding population.|$|E
5|$|Francisco Rafael was celebrating his 64th {{birthday}} {{along with}} his wife, children, and friends at Ocean House, a beachfront banquet hall owned by Hotel Marbella in Los Cabos, Baja California Sur on 18 October 2013. There were about 80 to 100 attendees at the party, including prominent businessmen, politicians, celebrities, and sport figures like former Mexican footballer Jared Borgetti and boxing champion Omar Chávez. The party also hosted a number of musical groups, including banda La Cabeña, El Mariachi de Los Cabos, and the former leading vocalist of Banda El Recodo. At around 8:00p.m. that day, a black-colored SUV entered the private property <b>and</b> <b>parked</b> near {{the entrance of the}} ballroom. In the front seats of the car, according to eye-witness reports, were two men; in the back seat was a man dressed as a clown, who descended from the vehicle and headed towards the door that led to the kitchen. Once inside the ballroom, the clown identified Francisco Rafael {{at the center of the}} room and began to walk towards him. When the clown was about 1m (3.3ft) close, he pulled out a pistol from his costume and shot him point-blank in his head and then several times more as he fell to the ground, killing him on the scene. As the former drug lord lay dead near the entrance, the assassin ran through a rear exit while the attendees yelled, fell to the ground, and hid under the tables. Four more shots were heard outside the ballroom shortly after the attack; according to eyewitnesses, the clown had done this to scare off one of Francisco Rafael's sons, who was chasing him. The suspect then fled the crime scene in the black-colored SUV and headed towards the highway.|$|E
5|$|While {{investments}} in consumer goods were below projections, the expansion in output increased the Soviet people's standard of living. Refrigerators, owned by only 32 {{percent of the}} population in the early 1970s, had reached 86% of households by the late 1980s, and the ownership of color televisions increased from 51% in the early 1970s to 74% in the 1980s. On the other hand, though some areas improved during the Brezhnev era, the majority of civilian services deteriorated, with the physical environment for the common Soviet citizen falling apart rapidly. Diseases were on the rise because of the decaying health care system, and living space remained rather small by First World standards, with the common Soviet person living in 13.4 square metres. At the same time thousands of Moscow inhabitants were homeless, most of them living in shacks, doorways <b>and</b> <b>parked</b> trams. Authorities often conducted sweeps of movie theaters, restaurants, and saunas to locate people slacking off from work, particularly during major events like the 1980 Summer Olympics that attracted large numbers of foreign visitors. Nutrition ceased to improve in the late 1970s, with rationing of staple food products returning to locales such as Sverdlovsk. Environmental damage and pollution became a growing problem due to the Soviet government's policy of development at all costs, and {{some parts of the country}} such as the Kazakh SSR suffered particularly badly due to being used as a testing ground for nuclear weapons. While Soviet citizens in 1962 had enjoyed higher average life expectancy than the United States, by 1982 it had fallen by nearly five years.|$|E
40|$|Buildings can be located, {{designed}} {{and managed to}} optimize transportation <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> efficiency. This paper describes ways to improve LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) transportation <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> credits. Typical LEED programs reduce building energy consumption 20 - 60 %. Cost effective mobility <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> management programs can provide similar motor vehicle trip <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> generation reductions, resulting in large economic, social and environmental benefits. However, the current LEED rating system overlooks {{some of the most}} effective mobility <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> management strategies <b>and</b> encourages practitioners to choose strategies based on ease of implementation rather than effectiveness. As a result, the current LEED rating system is unlikely to implement mobility <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> management to the degree optimal. This paper recommends a different approach which defines performance targets needed to achieve LEED categories (silver, gold, platinum). Developers would establish mobility <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> management plans that indicate how targets will be met, how performance will be evaluated, and what additional strategies will be deployed if needed to achieve targets. This optimizes mobility <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> management programs, <b>and</b> responds to changing demands. However, it is unnecessary to wait for a major reform to improve and expand LEED transportation credits; new credits proposed in this paper could be quickly incorporated into the existing LEED rating system...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{time-dependent}} network equilibrium model that simultaneously considers a traveler's choice of departure time, route, <b>parking</b> location <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> duration in road networks with multiple user classes <b>and</b> multiple <b>parking</b> facilities. In the proposed model, travelers are differentiated by their trip purpose <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> duration, parking locations {{are characterized by}} facility type <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> charge, <b>and</b> the decision-making process of travelers on travel <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> choices is assumed to follow a hierarchical choice structure. The model is formulated as a variational inequality problem, and is solved by a heuristic solution algorithm. Numerical results for two example networks are presented to show the solution quality and investigate the solution sensitivities to some input data. It is found that parking behavior is significantly affected by travel demand, walking distance, <b>parking</b> capacity, <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> charge. The proposed model provides {{a useful tool for}} studying the complex temporal and spatial interaction between road traffic <b>and</b> <b>parking</b> congestion, <b>and</b> can be used to assess the effects of various <b>parking</b> policies <b>and</b> infrastructure improvements at a strategic level. ...|$|R
