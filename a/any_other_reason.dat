5|$|Emus {{were used}} {{as a source of}} food by {{indigenous}} Australians and early European settlers. Emus are inquisitive birds and have been known to approach humans if they see unexpected movement of a limb or piece of clothing. In the wild, they may follow and observe people. Aboriginal Australians used a variety of techniques to catch the birds, including spearing them while they drank at waterholes, catching them in nets, and attracting them by imitating their calls or by arousing their curiosity with a ball of feathers and rags dangled from a tree. The pitchuri thornapple (Duboisia hopwoodii), or some similar poisonous plant, could be used to contaminate a waterhole, after which the disoriented emus were easy to catch. Another stratagem was for the hunter to use a skin as a disguise, and the birds could be lured into a camouflaged pit trap using rags or imitation calls. Aboriginal Australians only killed emus out of necessity, and frowned on anyone who hunted them for <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>reason.</b> Every part of the carcass had some use; the fat was harvested for its valuable, multiple-use oil, the bones were shaped into knives and tools, the feathers were used for body adornment and the tendons substituted for string.|$|E
5|$|The poet, {{of whose}} works I have {{undertaken}} the revision, may now begin {{to assume the}} dignity of an ancient, and claim the privilege of established fame and prescriptive veneration. He has long outlived his century, the term commonly fixed as the test of literature merit. Whatever advantages he might once derive from personal allusions, local customs, or temporary opinions, have for many years been lost; and every topic of merriment, or motive of sorrow, which the modes of artificial life afforded him, now only obscure the scenes which they once illuminated. The effects of favour and competition are at an end; the tradition of his friendships and his enmities has perished; his works support no opinion with arguments, nor supply any faction with invectives; they can neither indulge vanity nor gratify malignity; but are read without <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>reason</b> than the desire of pleasure, and are therefore praised only as pleasure is obtained; yet, thus unassisted by interest or passion, they have past through variation of taste and changes of manners, and, as they devolved {{from one generation to}} another, have received new honours at every transmission.|$|E

The number of Internet users in the United States that visit online dating sites has fallen from a peak of 21% in 2003 to 10% in 2006.

25|$|Each person {{usually has}} two family names: though the law {{specifies}} no order, {{the first one}} is usually the maternal family name, whereas the last one is commonly the paternal family name.

The use of any surname outside this lot, or of more than six names, is legally possible, but it requires dealing with bureaucracy.

The content, however, was described as getting the series off to a [...] "slow start", with limitations of the first six episodes being the lack in fan service, humor, and that it [...] "struggles to find <b>any</b> <b>other</b> <b>reason</b> to be compelling". The second DVD, containing episodes seven through eleven, was reviewed as failing to [...] "materialize much real plot" [...] {{and content of the}} episodes was described as existing [...] "only to appeal to otaku who can get excited about moe content". The third DVD, compiling episodes twelve through sixteen, shows [...] "signs of an actual plot" [...] and contains a [...] "sudden explosion of fan service", which are noted as [...] "noteworthy developments" [...] in the review. In the fourth DVD, containing episodes seventeen through twenty-one, [...] "the series' romantic side does finally pay off with a romantic arc that actually engages".
