Emsley recognised four metalloids (germanium, arsenic, antimony and tellurium); James et al. listed twelve (Emsley's plus boron, carbon, silicon, selenium, bismuth, polonium, moscovium and livermorium). On average, seven elements are included in such lists; individual classification arrangements tend to share common ground and vary in the ill-defined margins.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{plants and}} {{therefore}} incapable of photosynthesis themselves, many sea anemones form an important facultative mutualistic relationship with certain single-celled algae species that {{reside in the}} animals' gastrodermal cells, especially in the tentacles and oral disc. These algae may be either zooxanthellae, zoochlorellae or both. The sea anemone benefits from {{the products of the}} algae's photosynthesis, namely oxygen and food in the form of glycerol, glucose and alanine; the algae in turn are assured a reliable exposure to sunlight and protection from micro-feeders, which the sea anemones actively maintain. The algae also benefit by being protected by the sea anemone's stinging cells, reducing the likelihood of being eaten by herbivores. In the aggregating anemone (Anthopleura elegantissima), the colour of the anemone is largely dependent on the proportions <b>and</b> <b>identities</b> of the zooxanthellae and zoochlorellae present. The hidden anemone (Lebrunia coralligens) has a whorl of seaweed-like pseudotentacles, rich in zooxanthellae, and an inner whorl of tentacles. A daily rhythm sees the pseudotentacles spread widely in the daytime for photosynthesis, but they are retracted at night, at which time the tentacles expand to search for prey.|$|E

The church set up a weekly fast and prayer meeting at Bargarron House, and Shaw's father appealed to the authorities that those named by his daughter as tormenting her should be arrested. She had initially identified only Catherine Campbell and Agnes Naismith, but as time wore on she implicated others, and eventually 35 were accused.

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{tracking}} multiple targets <b>and</b> managing their <b>identities</b> in sensor networks is considered. Each sensor {{is assumed to}} have its own surveillance region and an ability to communicate with its neighboring sensors. We propose a scalable, distributed, multitarget-tracking and identity-management algorithm that can track an unknown number of targets <b>and</b> manage their <b>identities</b> efficiently in a distributed sensor network environment. Distributed multitarget tracking <b>and</b> <b>identity</b> management finds a globally consistent solution by maintaining local consistency among neighboring sensors. Distributed multitarget tracking <b>and</b> <b>identity</b> management consists of data association, multitarget tracking, <b>identity</b> management, <b>and</b> <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> track fusion. The data-association and multitarget-tracking problems are efficiently solved byMarkov chainMonteCarlo data association,which can track an unknown number of targets. Distributed multitarget tracking <b>and</b> <b>identity</b> management manages identities of targets based on the identity-mass-flow framework. This framework prevents exponential growth in computation and storage of target-to-track association probabilities. Using <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> track fusion, distributed multitarget tracking <b>and</b> <b>identity</b> management maintains consistent <b>identities</b> <b>and</b> tracks among neighboring sensors. The performance and features of distributed multitarget tracking <b>and</b> <b>identity</b> management are extensively evaluated in simulation. I...|$|R

Quinn is kidnapped by Mackenzie (David Warner), an elderly British expatriate who is revealed {{to be the leader}} of the drug operation. The four are forced to return the money in exchange for their lives. When they are €100 short from a speeding fine, Mackenzie makes the four produce fake ecstasy for a nightclub, at which point he allows them to return home with five million euros that were paid to them by the nightclub, though Carmen is left behind. Mackenzie tricks them into boarding a ferry for Morocco, where they are arrested and sent to a black site prison in the desert. After another attempt on their lives, they are informed that the drug operation was organised by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), who are using the operation to fund black operations, {{and as a result of}} the four's interference a kill contract is out against them. With assistance by the British government, they move to Cape Town, South Africa, to live new lives <b>and</b> <b>identities</b> to avoid CIA detection, though they are no longer allowed to contact each other or their families.|$|E

40|$|Given {{the pervasiveness}} of {{language}} in social life and the implications that language use can have for one’s individual <b>and</b> collective <b>identities,</b> {{attempts were made to}} explore the theoretical and empirical advantages in connecting social psychological theories of <b>identity</b> <b>and</b> sociolinguistics in order to explore language <b>and</b> <b>identity</b> among second generation British Asians. This paper features a brief overview of the sociological background of British Asians and a detailed consideration of two social psychological theories of identity, namely, self-aspects model of <b>identity</b> (Simon, 2004) <b>and</b> <b>identity</b> process theory (Breakwell, 1986, 1992). It is considered that these under-utilised social psychological theories lend themselves readily to the study of language <b>and</b> <b>identity</b> among this population. Moreover, this paper considers the substantive literature on language <b>and</b> <b>identity.</b> It is argued that an interdisciplinary (social psychological and sociolinguistic) approach is particularly well-suited to the exploration of language <b>and</b> <b>identity.</b> Furthermore, ‘theoretically active’ phenomenological approaches may be particularly useful for research in this domain...|$|R
