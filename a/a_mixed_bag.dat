5|$|By {{the end of}} this period, the {{constant}} attempts at reorganisation had proved <b>a</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>bag,</b> particularly for the auxiliary forces. The Militia was heavily understrength and disorganised, whilst the number of recruits for the Volunteers was falling off and the financial situation of the units was becoming worrying. The system of central per-capita grants helped support the units, despite the worrying side-effect of causing an incentive to keep as many men on the books as possible regardless of fitness, but even so it was becoming apparent that many Volunteer Corps were headed towards financial collapse unless some action were taken.|$|E
5|$|Reception for {{individual}} elements of Zombiepowder. was more mixed. The series premise of seeking magical items was criticized as cliche by ANN and IGN, but deemed {{sufficient for the}} needs of the story by AMO, and the parasitic nature of the rings and zombie powder themselves were complimented by MangaCast and IGN for lending suspense to the plot. The setting was criticized by ANN and Gorban alike for not having much effort put into it, being too similar to Trigun, and seeming to be chosen {{just for the sake of}} coolness, while IGN liked the mixture of the old west, arcane, and technological. The quality of individual characters in the series was again considered <b>a</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>bag,</b> both in artistic design and characterization, but with a consensus across reviews that the characters were not developed much beyond their respective tropes.|$|E
25|$|Two other Harriott albums {{appeared}} in 1967 and 1968.

The original example is termed a one-sided or a one-tailed test while the generalization is termed a two-sided or two-tailed test.|$|E
25|$|August {{started with}} two losses to Northamptonshire Steelbacks - {{one in the}} National League {{and one in the}} Championship. After an eight-day break from cricket, Worcestershire came back strongly, though, {{amassing}} 696 for 8 declared and beating Somerset by an innings, which meant they could entertain a small hope of promotion. <b>A</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>bag</b> of results with a win and a loss in two games in the National League followed before a Championship match with Lancashire, which they lost by an innings and 73 runs. The month ended with a home draw with Leicestershire.|$|E

25|$|There {{followed}} a scramble for aircraft and volunteer air crews willing {{to operate in}} secrecy. The U.S. military, thus far restricted to using aerial rockets and machine guns, pressured for permission to use bombs and napalm. On 21 March 1961, the airlift of H-34s from Okinawa began; it ended on 24 March at Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base with the turnover to Air America of 16 copters and <b>a</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>bag</b> of 37 U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Navy pilots.

25|$|The 2014–15 {{season was}} {{something}} of <b>a</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>bag</b> for NBC, but still successful. NBC launched eight new series that year, with only one, comedy-drama police procedural The Mysteries of Laura, being renewed for a second season. Nevertheless, the network continued to experience success with most of its returning series, especially The Blacklist (despite a modest decline in viewership following its move to Thursdays midway through the season, due partly to an initial weak lead-in from miniseries The Slap). Combined with the record number of viewers tuning in to Super Bowl XLIX, NBC again finished #1 in the 18-49 demographic and in second place overall.|$|E
25|$|Masters's force {{established}} Blackpool on 8 May {{and were}} almost immediately engaged in fierce fighting. Whereas White City had been {{deep in the}} Japanese rear, its defenders had {{had plenty of time}} to prepare their defences and its attackers had been <b>a</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>bag</b> of detachments from several formations, Blackpool was close to the Japanese northern front, and was immediately attacked by Japanese troops with heavy artillery support. As Calvert and Stilwell had feared, abandoning White City had allowed the Japanese 53rd Division to move north from Indaw. A heavy attack against Blackpool was repulsed on 17 May, but a second attack on 24 May captured vital positions inside the defences.|$|E

25|$|When WSC players rejoined {{official}} cricket for 1979–80, {{there was}} plenty of debate over the Australian captaincy. Chappell was the far from unanimous choice, but led the Test team in twin series, against England (won 3–0) and West Indies (lost 0–2), and the first triangular ODI series where Australia failed to reach the final. It was <b>a</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>bag</b> of results and the programming came in for some criticism. Chappell led by example in scoring 74 and 124 in the Brisbane Test against the West Indies in his comeback to Test cricket. His 98* guided Australia to victory over England at Sydney, then 114 and 40* extracted a similar result at Melbourne. While he averaged 44 with the bat and claimed seven wickets in the ODIs, a constant shuffling of positions ensured an uneven Australian performance.|$|E
25|$|With the FAN {{offering}} steadily {{less reliable}} {{support to the}} Royalists, and the communists on the offensive, neutralist Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma convened a conference on the Plain of Jars on 17 April 1964. Failing {{in his attempt to}} calm or quell the three-sided conflict, and discouraged by his failure, Souvanna Phouma returned to Vientiane prepared to resign. However, on the night of 18 April, General Siho Lamphouthacoul led the National Police in a coup. General Kouprasith Abhay, who commanded the Royalist troops in the capital, consented to the coup. Without opposition, Siho's Bataillon Special 33 (Special Battalion 33) conquered the capital's governmental infrastructure. The following morning, coup troops arrested Souvanna Phouma and about 15 other important personages; the detainees were <b>a</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>bag</b> of Frenchmen, Royalists, and Neutralists. When U.S. ambassador Unger backed Souvanna Phouma, the latter was restored to office.|$|E
25|$|The 2006–07 {{season was}} <b>a</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>bag</b> for the network, with Deal or No Deal {{remaining}} strong and Heroes becoming a surprise hit on Monday nights, while the highly touted Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip (from West Wing creator Aaron Sorkin) lost {{a third of}} its premiere-night viewers by Week 6 and was eventually cancelled; two critically acclaimed sitcoms, The Office and 30 Rock, also pulled in modest successes and {{went on to win the}} Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy Series for four consecutive years. The network also regained the rights to the NFL after eight years that season when it acquired the Sunday Night Football package from ESPN (as part of a deal that also saw Monday Night Football move to ESPN from ABC). However, despite this, NBC remained at a very distant fourth place, barely ranking ahead of The CW.|$|E

40|$|We {{review the}} current state of {{knowledge}} of damped Lyα systems (DLAs) selected in absorption on quasar sightlines. These objects are extremely useful to study the interstellar medium of high-redshift galaxies and the nucleosynthesis in the early Universe. The characteristics of this galaxy population has been investigated for years and slowly we are getting information on their puzzling nature. Imaging at z < 1 shows that DLAs are associated with <b>a</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>bag</b> of galaxies with no especially large contribution from dwarf galaxies. Evidence for a mild evolution of the cosmic mean metallicity with time is observed. The star formation histories of these high-redshift galaxies begin to be accessible and indicate that DLAs tend to be young, gas-dominated galaxies with low star formation rates per unit area. Finally, indirect estimation of the DLA stellar masses from the mass-metallicity relations observed for emission-selected star-forming galaxies at z = 2 − 3 points to intermediate-mass galaxies with M* < 109...|$|R

Most of the Judges seem to view them like a well-loved dim cat, stupid, greedy but with an unseen value that's worth protecting with everything they have. Although at times they've shown a huge lack of empathy towards them, such as when Chief Judge Francisco asked them if a large number that were on welfare could commit suicide in his Christmas message in order to help balance the budget for the following year. Some Judges openly view them as a nuisance to be removed, or like Judge Manners, as a sub-human race to be used and abused as the Judges see fit.|$|E
25|$|The {{influence}} of the gun and other technology. The introduction of firearms was important, but guns on African battlefields were often of indifferent quality, and traditional weapons and tactics sometimes compared favorably with them. Indeed, Africans {{were well aware of}} the deficiencies of trade muskets and often demanded better quality than that offered. Most guns imported from Europe had not been test fired by the manufacturer to check for imperfections in bore and breach, although this was essential in the era of hand-forged barrels. Proven guns had proof-marks, and counterfeits flourished in the Africa trade. Firearms were thus <b>a</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>bag</b> on the ground, and the success of consolidating native powers like the Merina in Madagascar or the Zulu were due more to changes in indigenous organization, leadership and tactics, than to firearms. As the decades rolled on however, improvements to firearms, and other technology such as disease control (the cinchona bark to suppress malaria for example), and steamships were to give Europeans a decisive military edge on the continent.|$|E

IGN's Craig Harris noted slowdown in the graphics when multiple objects move on-screen. Reviewing for GameSpot, Greg Kasavin, also noted the slowdown in the game and mentioned it throws off the timing in making shots. The sound and music to the game were also well received.

GameSpot complained that the character animations appear [...] "a bit lifeless" [...] and that the boards were not aesthetically pleasing. The game's audio was met with an ambivalent reaction, with critics enjoying the music but complaining about the [...] "annoying" [...] character catchphrases.
