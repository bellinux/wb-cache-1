25|$|The <b>automatic</b> <b>brake</b> {{works by}} {{monitoring}} the speed using a centrifugal governor connected by gears {{to a large}} toothed gear mounted on the pinion axle next to the wheel (i.e. {{it is not the}} pinion gear). When the set speed is exceeded a lever on the governor hits a lever on a brake valve, and the brakes operate. The <b>automatic</b> <b>brake</b> can only be released after the train has come to a stop, and the driver has to leave the locomotive to reset the system. On the steam locomotives, steam is applied to a small brake cylinder that acts on the driver's side brakes. On the carriages, the <b>automatic</b> <b>brake</b> is an air brake. On the diesel locomotives, a hydraulic cylinder is used.|$|E

25|$|For {{increased}} safety, each {{vehicle is}} also fitted with an <b>automatic</b> <b>brake</b> that is triggered if the vehicle exceeds a specific speed, {{such as a}} carriage running away or a locomotive engine failure. This system slows the train down using the same brake blocks and drums as the hand brake. The running speed at which the <b>automatic</b> <b>brake</b> comes on is lower for the carriages than the locomotive, to prevent a carriage running into a stationary locomotive further down the track.|$|E

In order to ensure the accuracy of information conducted research for determination of optimal combination of different sensors that provide an adequate perception of road conditions. The tracking system should be equipped with a combination of sensors, which in the case of detection of an obstacle or dangers of signal is transmitted to the information processing system and decision making. Information from the monitoring system should include data for the identification of the object, its condition, the speed. ...|$|R

25|$|On July 23, 2013, Transport Canada {{issued an}} {{emergency}} directive requiring {{at least two}} persons operate trains carrying tank cars of dangerous materials, prohibiting dangerous material trains left on the mainline unattended, requiring locomotive cabs on unattended trains be locked and reverser handles removed to prevent the train being put into gear, imposing requirements for setting hand brakes on trains unattended {{for more than an}} hour and requiring both the <b>automatic</b> <b>brake</b> (train brake) and independent brake (locomotive brake) be applied at their maximum force for trains unattended for an hour or less. A ministerial emergency directive remains in effect for six months, although it can be renewed.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Automatic</b> <b>brakes</b> on {{the other}} hand use the air or vacuum {{pressure}} to hold the brakes off against a reservoir carried on each vehicle, which applies the brakes if pressure/vacuum is lost in the train pipe. <b>Automatic</b> <b>brakes</b> are thus largely [...] "fail safe", though faulty closure of hose taps can lead to accidents such as the Gare de Lyon accident.|$|R

[...] The fin had a straight and vertical leading edge, but a curved top that blended into a rounded rudder which extended downwards between separate elevators. [...] The tailplane was mounted just above the fuselage. [...] Underneath, and unusually for the time, there was a tailwheel rather than a skid; remarkably, this wheel was both steerable and fitted with an <b>automatic</b> <b>brake</b> which provided increasing resistance with increasing load. [...] The pilot could override the brake if he chose. [...] The main undercarriage was less innovative, with a pair of wheels single axle-mounted on short oleo legs to the wings with rear bracing.|$|E
