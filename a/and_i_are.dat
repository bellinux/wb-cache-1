25|$|Since {{our father}} divided the kingdom between us, both you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> held {{to share the}} land and its produce with our magnates, with whose help our forefathers possessed the lost land and repulsed the Arabs.

25|$|The biggest bone of {{contention}} between {{the advocates of}} the 'modern' orthographies and the 'traditionalist' orthographies {{is the use of}} w and y to show the semi-vowels. In general native speakers in literacy classes seem to find y and w very difficult to learn, and that u <b>and</b> <b>i</b> <b>are</b> the 'logical' letters to use. Syllabification of words by untrained speakers suggests that u <b>and</b> <b>i</b> <b>are</b> really the underlying sounds. Thus, a word like dhaudhai 'mainland, continent' syllabifies as dha-u-dha-i, not dhau-dhai. In songs, the glide-u/i can also be given full syllable status. Historical considerations also point to the semi-vowels often being vocalic rather than consonantal. Thus, lagau, the genitive of laag 'place' is in underlying form +ngu>; the full form of the genitive ending -ngu is only retained where the nominal has a monosyllabic stem (see the section on Nominal Morphology). Similarly, verbal nouns end in -i, e.g. lumai, stem luuma- 'search, look for, seek, hunt'. The mid-19th century to early 20th century records of Kauaraigau Ya show that the verbal noun ending was previously -ri (thus lumari), where the -r- was presumably the rhotic glide rather than the rhotic tap/trill.|$|E

25|$|Rita Hayworth {{was one of}} our country's {{most beloved}} stars. Glamorous and talented, she gave us many {{wonderful}} moments on stage and screen and delighted audiences {{from the time she was}} a young girl. In her later years, Rita became known for her struggle with Alzheimer's disease. Her courage and candor, and that of her family, were a great public service in bringing worldwide attention to a disease which we all hope will soon be cured. Nancy <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> saddened by Rita's death. She was a friend who we will miss. We extend our deep sympathy to her family.|$|E

The plants in the passage are just watered: and with the passage door open the room smells like a greenhouse. Pamela has dressed four beautiful flower-pots, and is now working at her frame, while I write to my dearest mother; and upon the two little stands are six pots of fine auriculas, and I am sitting in a bay window with all those pleasant feelings which the fine weather, the pretty place, the singing birds, the pretty wife and Frescati give me.|$|E

25|$|It {{is not my}} main {{ground of}} {{complaint}} that you have her, even though I loved her dearly; that she has you is my chief regret, a loss that touches me more closely. Loving offenders, I excuse you both thus: you love her, because you know I love her; similarly, she abuses me for my sake, in allowing my friend to have her. If I lose you, my loss is a gain to my love; and losing her, my friend picks up that loss. Both find each other, I lose both, and both lay this cross on me for my sake. But there is one consolation in this thought: my friend <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> one; therefore she loves me alone.|$|E
25|$|I {{have not}} said {{anything}} about politics today. I don't propose {{to say anything about}} politics. You have a right to elect whom you please; vote for the man you think best, and I think, when that is done, that you <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>are</b> freemen. Do as you consider right and honest in electing men for office. I did not come here to make you a long speech, although invited to do so by you. I am not much of a speaker, and my business prevented me from preparing myself. I came to meet you as friends, and welcome you to the white people. I want you to come nearer to us. When I can serve you I will do so. We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment. Use your best judgment in selecting men for office and vote as you think right.|$|E
