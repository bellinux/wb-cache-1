40|$|A general, simple, {{practical}} and convenient method {{has been described}} for the synthesis of anesthetic drug thiopental using thiourea {{in the presence of}} sodium ethoxide. Anesthetic drug of thiopental was prepared in two stages; during the first stage, the alkylation of mthyl cyanoacetate was performed which was then to be followed by cyclization. Alkylation of methyl cyanoacetate which was performed by 2 -iodopentane in the presence of sodium ethoxide reacts with thiourea and then the process was followed by thiopental prepration in excellent yield. Some important aspects of this methodology are the high reactivity of the substrates, avoidance of the use of hazardous solvents, simplicity of the product separation, low cost of the substrates and reagents and high yield of product.

In plant water requirements and Evapotranspiration volume calculation, firstly reference evapotranspiration (ET 0) have to be computed and then by using different methods for any plant water requirements can be estimated. In this paper firstly the (ET 0) factor calculated by standard FAO-Penman-Monteith formula by using climatic data of Tabriz station and then combinations of climatic parameters such as mean, minimum and maximum of air temperature, mean, minimum and maximum of relative humidity rainfall, wind speed and sunshine hours considered as an input of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) Feed Forward Back Propagation Neural Networks and Genetic Programming for estimate monthly (ET 0).

40|$|Genome-wide pathway {{association}} studies provide novel {{insight into}} the biological mechanism underlying complex diseases. Current pathway association studies primarily focus on single important disease phenotype, which is sometimes insufficient to characterize the clinical manifestations of complex diseases. We present a multi-phenotypes pathway association study(MPPAS) approach using principle component analysis(PCA). In our approach, PCA is first applied to multiple correlated quantitative phenotypes for extracting a set of orthogonal phenotypic components. The extracted phenotypic components are then used for pathway association analysis instead of original quantitative phenotypes. Four statistics were proposed for PCA-based MPPAS in this study. Simulations using the real data from the HapMap project were conducted to evaluate the power and type I error rates of PCA-based MPPAS under various scenarios considering sample sizes, additive and interactive genetic effects. A real genome-wide association study data set of bone mineral density (BMD) at hip and spine were also analyzed by PCA-based MPPAS. Simulation studies illustrated the performance of PCA-based MPPAS for identifying the causal pathways underlying complex diseases. Genome-wide MPPAS of BMD detected associations between BMD and KENNY_CTNNB 1 _TARGETS_UP as well as LONGEVITYPATHWAY pathways in this study.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from shed hairs has gained high importance in forensic casework since telogen hairs {{are one of}} the common type of evidence left at the crime scene. This type of evidence very often lack of nuclear DNA (nDNA), so the {{analysis of}} mtDNA is the only possibility. The analysis of trichological material lacking nDNA is not commonly done in the forensic practice because of the high price of the regularly used mtDNA analysis method, as well as the time demandingness. For these reasons we decided to analyze the mtDNA and identify the trichological material by analysis of chosen single based polymorphism's (SNP) followed by High Resolution Melting (HRM). In order to verify the robustness of the HRM analysis method on several types of biological material that belongs to one person, we tested trichological material in anagen and telogen. From total number of 5 selected SNP's, this paper was able to optimize analysis of 3 SNP's.

40|$|Our built {{environment}} {{is responsible for}} some of the most serious global and local en- vironmental change. The construction industry therefore faces pressure to increase the sustainability of its practices re ected in the development of stringent regulations and sustainability assessment methods, designed to mitigate such negative impacts. How- ever, the well-established methods (e. g. BREEAM, LEED, SBTool, and CASBEE) have not originally been designed to suit developing countries (including Saudi Arabia). This study therefore proposes to customize an adapted Saudi Environmental Assessment Method (SEAM). This study to begin with investigates the most important and globally widespread environmental assessment methods: BREEAM, LEED, SBTool, and CAS- BEE. It identifes areas of convergence and distinction in order to enable the consolida- tion of environmental criteria into new potential schemes. As sustainable and ecological context are usually regarded as multi-dimensional, scientific evidence proposes that a technique based on consensus is most appropriate for the establishment of inclusive and efficient building environmental assessment schemes. Therefore, a consensus based ap- proach is used to deliver: (<b>a)</b> <b>applicable</b> assessment categories and criteria for the Saudi Arabia context and (b) its weighting system. Hence, the Delphi technique and Ana- lytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) are selected and conducted in four successive systematic consultation rounds, involving world leading experts in the domain of environmental and sustainable assessment schemes, as well as professionals and highly-informed local experts from academia, government and industry. These two stages resulted in the development of SEAM criteria and its weighting system...|$|E

The advent of new forms of communication and sharing content on the Internet, so-called Web 2. 0, brought new trend to our lives. This new trend with great potential for further commercialization of the Internet, are social networks. This thesis deals mainly with issues of use of social networks for commercial communication. Social networks offers a wide range of opportunities for business development on the Internet in the future. Volume of use of social networks in the future depends not only on users of social networks, but also on skills and experience of corporate entities. The goal of the thesis is to provide a comprehensive view on this issue, analyze the current uses of each commercial channel on social networks and provide insight to possible future progress. The work is divided into three chapters. The first, theoretical part, defines online communication channels, social networks and analyse basic problems of commercial use of social networks. In the second part author provides an overview of the possibilities of use of social networks and their potential, their advantages and disadvantages. And also methods how to enter a field of social networking with a business. The third part is a case study of use of social networks for business development in a particular company. In this charter author applies knowledge from the theoretical part. Reader of the thesis should thus gain a complete understanding of the issues of commercial uses of social networks. In theoretical, and also in practical direction. The thesis could thus be <b>a</b> <b>applicable</b> guide for the use of all the opportunities that social networks provide these days. The benefit for the reader should be the ability to apply theoretical and practical procedures for developing their own business...|$|E
40|$|Current {{information}} indicates that, {{regardless of}} location, American assets and citizens {{will continue to}} be targets of terrorist activities. Terrorists have demonstrated their willingness to employ nontraditional weapons to achieve their ends. One such class of nontraditional weapons is radiological/nuclear (RN) devices. RN devices pose new challenges to both law enforcement (LE) and public health (PH) officials in their efforts to minimize the effects of a RN attack, prevent or stop additional attacks, attribute the attack to the perpetrators, and apprehend those responsible for it. In the past, it was not uncommon for LE and PH officials to conduct separate and independent investigations. However, a RN attack requiresa high level of cooperation between these two disciplines to achieve their respective objectives of minimizing public panic and radiation exposure, preventing the spread of radioactive contamination, identifying the per- petrators, and apprehending/prosecuting those responsible for the attack. The lack of mutual awareness and understanding, as well as the absence of established communication procedures, could hinder the effectiveness of separate, but often overlapping, LE and PH investigations. The effective use of all resources will be critical to an efficient and appropriate response to any terrorist RN attack. This handbook serves several purposes: Provide an introduction to RN LE and PH investigations so personnel {{have a better understanding of}} each other 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s information requirements and investigative procedures; Identify potential barriers LE and PH personnel will encounter during their respective RN incident investigations and provide potential solutions that can be adapted to meet the needs of the various jurisdictions and agencies throughout the United States (US); Enhance the appreciation and understanding by all parties of each discipline 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s expertise.
