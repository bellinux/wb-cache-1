Safety hazards are classified into four categories: (1) Railroad crossings, (2) Intersections, (3) Geometric-Related Hazards, and (4) Roadside Hazards. For each category of hazards, relationships are developed to obtain a hazard index and expected <b>accident</b> <b>potentials</b> per year. Hazard indices are used to rank the hazardous locations within each hazard category. The most hazardous locations of each category are analyzed to estimate the expected <b>accident</b> <b>potentials.</b> From the expected <b>accident</b> <b>potentials,</b> the number of fatal plus non-fatal injury accidents are then estimated and used to set priorities for safety improvements...|$|R

The technique of linear discriminant analysis indicated that there is {{a significant difference in the}} mean vectors of flight data for the two groups. The computed discriminant function produced an empirical correct classification rate of 8 l$. Techniques of cluster analysis (with the aid of principal components analysis) are also employed to detect patterns or differences in the data.

40|$|Abstract: Nowadays {{improving}} safety is an indispensable part of research {{issues in the}} automotive industry. Due to increased travelling time, <b>accident</b> <b>potentials</b> and also traffic con-gestions, automated vehicles {{are seen as a}} way to increase freeway capacity and vehicle speed while reducing accidents resulted from human errors. In order to guide a vehicle automatically, vehicle lateral motion should be controlled, active steering control (ASC) and direct yaw-moment control (DYC) are two common methods to control the vehicle lateral dynamic, automatically. For higher vehicle lateral acceleration, where the tyres will not be capable of producing enough lateral forces (yaw-moment), ASC could not be useful. In such situation, the advantages of DYC can be clearly observed. In this paper, a novel optimal control law is proposed to control the vehicle path, automatically. The control law uses the vehicle dynamic variables such as the yaw and lateral velocities, lateral offset, and the heading error as well as the road-related variables. These are the road curvature and the lateral offset between the desired path and the vehicle as the feedback/feed-forward signals to produce both the front steering angle and the external yaw-moment signals as the control efforts. Simulation results illustrate the dominant power of the front steering/DYC in the control of the vehicle lateral motion...|$|R
40|$|Accident {{black spots}} are usually defined as road {{locations}} with high <b>accident</b> <b>potentials.</b> In order to detect such hazardous locations {{we have to}} know the probability of an accident for a traffic situation of some kind, or the mean number of accidents for some unit of time. In almost all procedures known to us, the various road locations are treated as isolated spots. With small accident figures it is difficult to detect such places in the known procedures. An alternative procedure starts from the comparison of the locations with each other. The central question is: what do accident black spots have in common and in which respects do they differ other than in location. To answer this question we have to relate the accident figures to the road and traffic characteristics of the locations. The classification of locations is based on the characteristics of the locations. A canonical score is computed for each location from the road and traffic characteristics of the locations. This score may be transformed into the probability of an accident. Given the accident reduction effect of some countermeasures, the expected number of accidents after reconstruction can be predicted.

40|$|The spacing of {{driveways}} {{and streets}} {{is an important}} element in roadway planning, design, and operation. Access points are the main source of accidents and congestion.

More than 40 years of research has indicated that accident rates increase with the number of inter-secting roadways or driveways per mile.
