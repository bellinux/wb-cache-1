This can prevent some impacts associated with <b>ash</b> <b>fall,</b> reduce the effects, and increase the human capacity to cope with such events. A few items such as a flashlight, plastic sheeting to protect electronic equipment from ash ingress, and battery operated radios, are extremely useful during <b>ash</b> <b>fall</b> events.|$|E
5|$|Communication plans {{should be}} made {{beforehand}} to inform of mitigation actions being undertaken. Spare parts and back-up systems should be in place prior to <b>ash</b> <b>fall</b> events to reduce service disruption and return functionality as quickly as possible. Good preparedness also includes the identification of ash disposal sites, before <b>ash</b> <b>fall</b> occurs, to avoid further movement of ash and to aid clean-up. Protective equipment such as eye protection and dust masks should be deployed for clean-up teams in advance of <b>ash</b> <b>fall</b> events.|$|E

Navigation will be impacted by a reduction in visibility during <b>ash</b> <b>fall.</b> Vesiculated ash (pumice and scoria) will float on the water surface in ‘pumice rafts’ which can clog water intakes quickly, leading to over heating of machinery.|$|E
5|$|Volcanic <b>ash</b> <b>fall</b> is physically, socially, and {{economically}} disruptive. Volcanic ash can affect both proximal areas and areas {{many hundreds of}} kilometres from the source, and causes disruptions and losses {{in a wide variety}} of different infrastructure sectors. Impacts are dependent on: <b>ash</b> <b>fall</b> thickness; the duration of the ash fall; the grain size and chemistry of the ash; whether the ash is wet or dry; and any preparedness, management and prevention (mitigation) measures employed to reduce effects from the <b>ash</b> <b>fall.</b> Different sectors of infrastructure and society are affected in different ways and are vulnerable to a range of impacts or consequences. These are discussed in the following sections.|$|E
5|$|Young forests (trees <2 years old) {{are most}} at risk from ash falls {{and are likely to}} be {{destroyed}} by ash deposits >100 mm. <b>Ash</b> <b>fall</b> is unlikely to kill mature trees, but ash loading may break large branches during heavy ash falls (>500 mm). Defoliation of trees may also occur, especially if there is a coarse ash component within the <b>ash</b> <b>fall.</b>|$|E
40|$|Some hydrologic {{observations}} {{were carried out}} in the forested catchments covered with volcaniclastic materials and situated in the Takakuma Experimental Forest of Kagoshima University. The purpose of these observations is to understand quantitatively the runoff phenomena in the forested catchments in volcanic areas. In this paper, temporal variation of flow regime in the No. 1 Takakuma experimental catchment have been analyzed using the hydrologic data gathered over 25 years from 1984 to 2008. The No. 1 Takakuma experimental catchment was often hit by <b>ash</b> <b>falls</b> caused by the volcanic activity of Sakurajima from 1984 to 1995. The <b>ash</b> <b>falls</b> caused a series of phenomena, such as the lowering of infiltration capacity, increase of surface runoff, and increase of runoff ratio. As a result, the difference between plentiful water discharge and scanty water discharge increased, and uniformity of streamflow became gradually lower. On the other hand, the uniformity of streamflow went up gradually as the <b>ash</b> <b>falls</b> decreased from 1996. The <b>ash</b> <b>falls</b> caused by the volcanic activity of Sakurajima have strongly influenced the runoff of the surrounding forested catchments. ""著者らは,鹿児島大学農学部附属高隈演習林内の火山砕屑物に覆われた森林流域において 1984 年から水文観測を継続している。この観測の目的は火山地域における森林流域の流出現象を定量的に解明することである。本論では, 1984 ～ 2008 年の 25 年間に得られた水文データを用いて,高隈第 1 号試験流域の流出特性の変遷を解析した。試験流域は, 1984 年から 1995 年にかけて,桜島の火山活動に伴う降灰にしばしば見舞われた。林地に堆積した火山灰は浸透能低下や表面流発生を引き起こし,さらに降灰が激しいときは林地にリル・ガリー侵食を起こした。その結果,豊水時と渇水時の流量差が経年的に増大していき,流出の一様性は低下した。一方, 1996 年から降灰が少なくなるにつれて,流出の一様性は向上した。桜島の火山活動に伴う降灰は,周辺の森林流域の流出に強く影響していることが明らかになった。...|$|R

5|$|The <b>ash</b> <b>fall</b> {{created some}} {{temporary}} major problems with transportation, sewage disposal, and water treatment systems. Visibility was greatly decreased during the <b>ash</b> <b>fall,</b> closing many highways and roads. Interstate 90 from Seattle to Spokane {{was closed for}} a week and a half. Air travel was disrupted for between a few days and two weeks, as several airports in eastern Washington shut down because of ash accumulation and poor visibility. Over a thousand commercial flights were cancelled following airport closures. Fine-grained, gritty ash caused substantial problems for internal-combustion engines and other mechanical and electrical equipment. The ash contaminated oil systems and clogged air filters, and scratched moving surfaces. Fine ash caused short circuits in electrical transformers, which in turn caused power blackouts.|$|E
5|$|Preparedness for ashfalls should involve sealing buildings, {{protecting}} {{infrastructure and}} homes, and storing sufficient supplies {{of food and}} water to last until the <b>ash</b> <b>fall</b> is over and clean-up can begin.

5|$|Some {{effective}} {{techniques for}} the management of ash have been developed including cleaning methods and cleaning apparatus, and actions to mitigate or limit damage. The latter include covering of openings such as: air and water intakes, aircraft engines and windows during <b>ash</b> <b>fall</b> events. Roads may be closed to allow clean-up of ash falls, or speed restrictions may be put in place, in order to prevent motorists from developing motor problems and becoming stranded following an <b>ash</b> <b>fall.</b> To prevent further effects on underground water systems or waste water networks, drains and culverts should be unblocked and ash prevented from entering the system. Ash can be moistened (but not saturated) by sprinkling with water, to prevent remobilisation of ash and to aid clean-up. Prioritisation of clean-up operations for critical facilities and coordination of clean-up efforts also constitute good management practice.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 {{eruption}} of Eyjafjallajokull in Iceland highlighted {{the impacts of}} volcanic <b>ash</b> <b>fall</b> in modern society and our dependence on the functionality of infrastructure services. During this event the airline industry suffered business interruption losses of €1.5-2.5 billion from the closure of European airspace for six days in April 2010 and subsequent closures into May 2010. <b>Ash</b> <b>fall</b> from this event is also known to have caused local crop losses in agricultural industries, losses in the tourism industry, destruction of roads and bridges in Iceland (in combination with glacial melt water), and costs associated with emergency response and clean-up. However, across Europe there were further losses associated with travel disruption, the insurance industry, the postal service, and imports and exports across Europe and worldwide. These consequences demonstrate the interdependency and diversity of impacts from a single event.|$|E

5|$|The {{density of}} {{individual}} particles varies with different eruptions. The density of volcanic ash varies between 700–1200kg/m3 for pumice, 2350–2450kg/m3 for glass shards, 2700–3300kg/m3 for crystals, and 2600–3200kg/m3 for lithic particles. Since coarser and denser particles are deposited close to source, fine glass and pumice shards are relatively enriched in <b>ash</b> <b>fall</b> deposits at distal locations. The high density and hardness (~5 on the Mohs Hardness Scale) {{together with a}} high degree of angularity, make some types of volcanic ash (particularly those with a high silica content) very abrasive.|$|E
5|$|Ash fallout occurs {{immediately}} after the eruption and is controlled by particle density. Initially, coarse particles fall out close to source. This is followed by fallout of accretionary lapilli, {{which is the result}} of particle agglomeration within the column. Ash fallout is less concentrated during the final stages as the column moves downwind. This results in an <b>ash</b> <b>fall</b> deposit which generally decreases in thickness and grain size exponentially with increasing distance from the volcano. Fine ash particles may remain in the atmosphere for days to weeks and be dispersed by high-altitude winds. These particles can impact on the aviation industry (refer to impacts section) and, combined with gas particles, can affect global climate.|$|E
5|$|The {{high bulk}} density of some ash {{deposits}} can cause line breakage and damage to steel towers and wooden poles due to ash loading. This is most hazardous when the ash and/or {{the lines and}} structures are wet (e.g., by rainfall) {{and there has been}} ≥10 mm of <b>ash</b> <b>fall.</b> Fine-grained ash (e.g., <0.5 mm diameter) adheres to lines and structures most readily. Volcanic ash may also load overhanging vegetation, causing it to fall onto lines. Snow and ice accumulation on lines and overhanging vegetation further increases the risk of breakage and or collapse of lines and other hardware.|$|E
