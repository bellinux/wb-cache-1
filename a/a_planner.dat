5|$|From {{the time}} of her arrival in Aldeburgh Imogen gave {{considerable}} support and assistance to the Aldeburgh Festival, as a conductor and, from 1953, increasingly as <b>a</b> <b>planner</b> and organiser. In 1956 her position was formalised, and she joined Britten and Pears as one of the festival's artistic directors, taking responsibility for programmes and performers. At the 1956 festival she fulfilled a long-held ambition by arranging a performance of Gustav Holst's opera Savitri, the first of several Holst works that she introduced to the festival. Savitri was offered as part of a double bill that included Imogen's arrangement of John Blow's 17th century opera Venus and Adonis. In 1957 she instituted late-night concerts devoted to early music, and in 1962 she organised a series of evening concerts of Flemish music, in which she had more recently become interested. She also devised frequent programmes devoted to church music, for performance at Aldeburgh parish church. Since moving to Aldeburgh in 1952, Imogen had lived in a series of lodgings and rented flats. In 1962 she moved to a small contemporary bungalow built for her in Church Walk, where she lived {{for the rest of her}} life.|$|E

5|$|Mega Man X was {{developed}} by a team at Capcom which had worked on the long-running Mega Man series for the NES. Lead artist Keiji Inafune (credited as <b>a</b> <b>planner</b> as Inemuryar) recounted {{that the development of}} Mega Man X required a lot of brainstorming for its storyline and content where the team's goal was to branch out from original Mega Man games while still maintaining their fundamentals. In the original Mega Man series, Inafune typically designed the protagonist while his protégé Hayato Kaji handled the supporting characters. However, their roles were reversed for Mega Man X. Kaji (credited as Rippa H.K) illustrated the protagonist X, but had a difficult time with the initial design. He was presented with much more freedom than he was accustomed with the SNES's larger palette of colors when compared to the NES. Inafune and Kaji worked simultaneously on the various designs for X with different pieces of armor attached. The idea for the armor parts came about because the game was planned during a time when role-playing video games were becoming extremely popular. Inafune felt that Mega Man had always represented a classic action game formula in which the hero earns his defeated enemies' abilities; the armor parts were added to supplement this concept.|$|E

Okada later said that Atlus' main desire when creating Maken X was to develop something new after making role-playing games for most of the company's lifetime.|$|E
