40|$|Both Barth and Moltmann {{claim that}} the resurrection {{is at the heart}} of the Christian message. Yet, both theologians are not {{prepared}} to place the resurrection in the same category as history, either in an attempt to avoid the lifelessness of relegating it to a past event, or due to claims of its the lack of <b>admissibility</b> as <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> the court of science. This denial of the objectivity leads to deeper misunderstandings of the resurrection. Moltmann claims that the resurrection is a process not a fact, and thus is the means by which God works through history to liberate his fallen world from the effects of sin. Barth claims that the resurrection adds nothing to our reconciliation, but rather is the means by which God revealed his finished work to the first disciples. Both positions fail to sufficiently emphasise the objective revivification of Jesus Christ that was necessary for him to succeed in his mission by conquering death and the devil, being exalted from his humiliation...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a theory of}} reasoning with <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> {{order to determine the}} facts in a criminal case. The focus is on the process of proof, in which {{the facts of the case}} are determined, rather than on related legal issues, such as the <b>admissibility</b> of <b>evidence.</b> <b>In</b> the literature, two approaches to reasoning with evidence can be distinguished, one argument-based and one storybased. In an argument-based approach to reasoning with evidence, the reasons for and against the occurrence of an event, e. g., based on witness testimony, are central. In a story-based approach, evidence is evaluated and interpreted from the perspective of the factual stories as they may have occurred in a case, e. g., as they are defended by the prosecution. In this paper, we argue that both arguments and narratives are relevant and useful in the reasoning with and interpretation of evidence. Therefore a hybrid approach is proposed and formally developed, doing justice to both the argumentbased and the narrative-based perspective. By the formalization of the theory and the associated graphical representations, our proposal is the basis for the design of software developed as a tool to make sense of the <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> complex cases...|$|R
40|$|The {{advent of}} the {{technological}} age has had significant effect on litigation practice, none {{more so than in}} the area of evidence gathering and presentation in court. A significant proportion of evidence that is gathered for both criminal and civil matters is now electronic in nature, and this necessitates a change in the way that lawyers think and advise on evidential issues. It is argued here that rather than simply focusing on principles relating to the <b>admissibility</b> of <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> court, the traditional course on evidence law should be modified to equip students with an intellectual framework that conceives of electronic <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> litigation as an entire process. This process begins with the gathering and forensic examination of electronic evidence, and is followed by the <b>admissibility</b> of such <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> court, ending with the effective presentation of the evidence before a judge or jury. It is argued in that taking such an approach, the law teacher would be playing the role of effective gatekeeper to the legal profession by providing a course that is both intellectually rigorous and adequately prepares wouldbe litigators for the realities of modern day practice...|$|R

Note {{that the problem is}} nontrivial even if the logic itself (i.e., its set of theorems) is decidable: the definition of admissibility of a rule A/B involves an unbounded universal quantifier over all propositional substitutions, hence a priori we only know that <b>admissibility</b> of rule <b>in</b> a decidable logic is [...] (i.e., its complement is recursively enumerable).
