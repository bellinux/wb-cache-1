5|$|Because of the {{economic}} background, large-scale systems <b>are</b> <b>presently</b> distributed where the support regimes {{have been the most}} consistent, or the most advantageous. Total capacity of worldwide PV plants above 4 MWAC was assessed by Wiki-Solar as 36 GW in c. 2,300 installations at the end of 2014 and represents about 25 percent of total global PV capacity of 139GW. The countries which had the most capacity, in descending order, were the United States, China, Germany, India, United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, Canada and South Africa. Activities in the key markets are reviewed individually below.|$|E
5|$|Geothermal {{power is}} also {{considered}} to be sustainable thanks to its power to sustain the Earth’s intricate ecosystems. By using geothermal sources of energy present generations of humans will not endanger the capability of future generations {{to use their own}} resources to the same amount that those energy sources <b>are</b> <b>presently</b> used. Further, due to its low emissions geothermal energy is considered to have excellent potential for mitigation of global warming.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the roles}} and {{importance}} of {{the various forms of}} vitamin E <b>are</b> <b>presently</b> unclear, and it has even been suggested that the most important function of α-tocopherol is as a signaling molecule, with this molecule having no significant role in antioxidant metabolism. The functions of the other forms of vitamin E are even less well understood, although γ-tocopherol is a nucleophile that may react with electrophilic mutagens, and tocotrienols may be important in protecting neurons from damage.|$|E

This state highway also passes very near Columbia State Historic Park, a protected area encompassing the historic business district of the town of Columbia; the park has preserved many Gold Rush-era buildings, which <b>are</b> <b>presently</b> occupied by tourist-oriented businesses.|$|E

At Tottenville, there is a three track yard, with two tracks {{on either side of}} a concrete station platform.|$|E

They include: Free Radio Shropshire & Black Country;, BBC Radio Shropshire, which is based in Shrewsbury; and, as of September 2006, The Severn, which broadcasts from the Shropshire Star building in Telford.|$|E
5|$|Coyotes <b>are</b> <b>presently</b> {{the most}} {{abundant}} livestock predators in western North America, causing the majority of sheep, goat, and cattle losses. For example, according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service, coyotes were responsible for 60.5% of the 224,000 sheep deaths attributed to predation in 2004. The total number of sheep deaths in 2004 comprised 2.22% of the total sheep and lamb population in the United States, which, according to the National Agricultural Statistics Service USDA report, totaled 4.66 million and 7.80 million heads respectively as of July 1, 2005. Because coyote populations are typically many times greater and more widely distributed than those of wolves, coyotes cause more overall predation losses. The United States government agents routinely shoot, poison, trap, and kill about 90,000 coyotes each year to protect livestock. An Idaho census taken in 2005 showed that individual coyotes were 5% as likely to attack livestock than individual wolves.|$|E
5|$|In Final Fantasy XII, {{the continents}} in Ivalice <b>are</b> <b>presently</b> home to three nations: Rozarria, Archadia and Dalmasca.

Strategically located between the rival neighboring empires of Archadia and Rozarria, Dalmasca's position as a neutral buffer region {{between the two countries}} is eliminated when it is invaded by Archadia {{at the onset of the}} game. With the fall of Landis and Nabradia and its reduction to an occupied territory under Archadian rule, Dalmasca is set to play a central role in the still-heated dispute between its neighbors, which is escalating once more.|$|E

5|$|Mirs Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) {{provided}} or controlled atmospheric pressure, fire detection, oxygen levels, {{waste management}} and water supply. The highest {{priority for the}} ECLSS was the station's atmosphere, but the system also collected, processed, and stored waste and water produced and used by the crew—a process that recycles fluid from the sink, toilet, and condensation from the air. The Elektron system generated oxygen. Bottled oxygen and Solid Fuel Oxygen Generation (SFOG) canisters, a system known as Vika, provided backup. Carbon dioxide {{was removed from the}} air by the Vozdukh system. Other byproducts of human metabolism, such as methane from the intestines and ammonia from sweat, were removed by activated charcoal filters. Similar systems <b>are</b> <b>presently</b> used on the International Space Station.|$|E
5|$|Scotland's home matches <b>are</b> <b>presently</b> {{covered by}} the pay-TV {{broadcaster}} Sky Sports. Television rights to away games vary; Sky Sports currently hold the rights to both home and away qualifiers for Euro 2016 and the 2018 World Cup. The arrangements to show Scotland matches on pay-TV have been criticised by the Scottish Government, who have argued that qualifying matches {{should be included in}} the list of sporting events which can only be broadcast on free-to-air television. The SFA have argued that limiting the rights to free-to-air broadcasters would severely reduce the amount of revenue that they could generate. An independent advisory panel recommended that qualifying matches played by all four Home Nations be added to the list, but UK Sports Minister Hugh Robertson deferred a decision until the completion of the digital switchover.|$|E
5|$|Maccabi Tel Aviv have {{a record}} 23 cup titles, {{followed}} by Hapoel Tel Aviv, who have 15, including two unmatched runs of {{three in a row}} (1937 to 1939, and 2010 to 2012). The sustained good performance of Beitar Jerusalem, the next most successful team in terms of State Cup wins with seven, is a relatively recent occurrence compared to the two major Tel Aviv clubs: Maccabi and Hapoel Tel Aviv have been consistently successful throughout the cup's history, but Beitar Jerusalem only reached their first finals in the 1970s. Hapoel Kfar Saba <b>are</b> <b>presently</b> the only club with more than one final appearance to hold an undefeated record in these matches, having won the cup final three times, every time they have reached it. By contrast, three-time finalists Shimshon Tel Aviv have yet to lift the trophy. The most decisive cup final victory was in 1942, when Beitar Tel Aviv beat Maccabi Haifa 12–1.|$|E
