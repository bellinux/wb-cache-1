He proposes a best fit double compartment model for dissolved gas and a single compartment model for undissolved gas as these are the simplest models consistent with available data.|$|E
5|$|A {{limitation}} of the radial velocity method used to discover 55 Cancri d is that only a lower limit on the planet's mass can be obtained. In the case of 55 Cancri d, this lower limit was around 3.835 times the mass of Jupiter. In 2004, astrometric measurements with the Fine Guidance Sensors on the Hubble Space Telescope suggest that the planet's orbit is inclined by around 53° {{with respect to the}} plane of the sky. If this measurement is confirmed, it implies that the planet's true mass is 25% greater than the lower limit, at around 4.8 Jupiter masses; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> be coplanar with the innermost planets e and b (both 85°).|$|E

5|$|TRIM is a SATA {{command that}} enables the {{operating}} system to tell an SSD which blocks of previously saved data are no longer needed {{as a result of}} file deletions or volume formatting. When an LBA is replaced by the OS, as with an overwrite of a file, the SSD knows that the original LBA can be marked as stale or invalid <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> save those blocks during garbage collection. If the user or operating system erases a file (not just remove parts of it), the file will typically be marked for deletion, but the actual contents on the disk are never actually erased. Because of this, the SSD does not know that it can erase the LBAs previously occupied by the file, so the SSD will keep including such LBAs in the garbage collection.|$|E

It is possible to convert chlorine to chloramine by adding ammonia to the water after addition of chlorine. The chlorine and ammonia react to form chloramine. Water distribution systems disinfected with chloramines may experience nitrification, as ammonia is a nutrient for bacterial growth, with nitrates being generated as a by-product.|$|E

China is currently working on an advanced domestic turbofan engine similar in performance to the Pratt & Whitney F119 coded WS-15, but there are also speculations that Saturn AL-31#117S engine may be used for the initial batch of the J-20. At the 2012 Zhuhai Air Show, Russia approached China in an unsuccessful bid to sell the Su-35, which included the 117S engines. According to the latest news, China and Russia signed a contract for 24 Su-35 in November, 2015.

2500|$|The {{supposed}} {{behavior of}} frogs illustrating nonaction is {{told in the}} often-repeated story of the boiled frog: put a frog in boiling water and it will jump out, but put it in cold water and slowly heat it, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> notice the danger and will be boiled alive. The story was based on nineteenth century experiments in which frogs were shown to stay in heating water {{as long as it}} was heated very slowly. The validity of the experiments is however disputed. Professor Douglas Melton, Harvard University Biology Department, says: [...] "If you put a frog in boiling water, it won't jump out. It will die.

2500|$|Instead, Anselm {{suggested}} that we owe God a debt of honor: [...] "This is the debt which man and angel owe to God, and no one who pays this debt commits sin; but every one who does not pay it sins. This is justice, or uprightness of will, which makes a being just or upright in heart, that is, in will; {{and this is the}} sole and complete debt of honor which we owe to God, and which God requires of us." [...] Having failed to render to God this debt, {{it is not enough to}} restore the justice originally owed, but the offense to God's honor must be satisfied, too. [...] "Moreover, so long as he does not restore what he has taken away, he remains in fault; <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> suffice merely to restore what has been taken away, but, considering the contempt offered, he ought to restore more than he took away." [...] This debt creates an imbalance in the moral universe; God cannot simply ignore it according to Anselm. The only way to satisfy the debt was for a being of infinite greatness, acting as a man on behalf of men, to repay the debt of justice owed to God and satisfy the injury to divine honor. In light of this view, the [...] "ransom" [...] that Jesus mentions in the Gospels would be a sacrifice and a debt paid only to God the Father.|$|E
2500|$|On 11 January 2007, the Ministry of Trade and Industry of Finland made a {{statement}} on the environmental impact assessment programme of the Russia-Germany natural gas pipeline, in which it mentioned that alternative routes via the Baltic states, Kaliningrad and/or Poland might theoretically be shorter than the route across the Baltic Sea, {{would be easier to}} flexibly increase the capacity of the pipeline, and might have better financial results. [...] There were also calls from Sweden to consider rerouting the pipeline onto dry land. Poland had proposed the construction of a second line of the Yamal–Europe pipeline, as well as the Amber pipeline through the Baltic states and Poland as land-based alternatives to the offshore pipeline. [...] The Amber project foresees laying a natural gas pipeline across the Tver, Novgorod and Pskov oblasts in Russia and then through Latvia and Lithuania to Poland, where it would be re-connected to the Yamal–Europe pipeline. [...] Latvia has proposed using its underground gas storage facilities if the onshore route were to be used. [...] Proponents have claimed that the Amber pipeline would cost half as much as an underwater pipeline, would be shorter, and would have less environmental impact. [...] Critics of this proposal say that in this case it would be more expensive for the suppliers over the long-term perspective, because the main aim of the project is to reduce transit costs. [...] Nord Stream AG has responded that the Baltic Sea would be the only route for the pipeline <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>not</b> consider an overland alternative.|$|E
