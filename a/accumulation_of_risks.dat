5000|$|A {{concern among}} many critics is that {{influence}} peddling hurts overall decision making, {{according to this}} criticism. Proposals with merit are dropped in favor of proposals backed by political expediency. An example cited in the media is the recent battling between food industry lobbyists and healthcare lobbyists regarding school lunches. A group supported by the United States Department of Agriculture proposed healthier lunches {{as a way to}} combat childhood obesity by limiting the number of potatoes served, limiting salty foods, and adding more fresh vegetables, but this group was countered by a strong food lobby backed by Coca-Cola, Del Monte, and makers of frozen pizza. The food lobbyists succeeded in blocking the proposed reforms, even writing rules suggesting that the tomato paste on a pizza qualified as a vegetable, but overall, according to critics, this case appeared to be an example where business interests won out over health concerns. Critics use examples such as these to suggest that lobbying distorts sound governance. A study by IMF economists found that the [...] "heaviest lobbying came from lenders making riskier loans and expanding their mortgage business most rapidly during the housing boom," [...] and that there were indications that heavy-lobbying lenders were more likely to receive bailout funds. The study found a correlation between lobbying by financial institutions and excessive risk-taking during 2000-2007, and the authors concluded that [...] "politically active lenders played a role in <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> and thus contributed to the financial crisis". Another study suggested that governments tend to protect domestic industries, and have a habit of shunting monies to ailing sectors; the study suggested that [...] "it is not that government policy picks losers, it is that losers pick government policy." [...] One critic suggested that the financial industry has successfully blocked attempts at regulation {{in the aftermath of the}} 2008 financial collapse.|$|E

40|$|Purpose To {{examine the}} {{associations}} between social class at ages 0, 5, 10, 30, and 34 years {{and physical activity}} at age 34 years using a novel approach to analysis of life course data. Methods We used structural equation modeling to compare three competing models in life course epidemiology: the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> model with additive effects, the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> model with trigger effect, and the critical period model. Data were from a nationally representative prospective cohort of 16, 571 British men and women born in 1970. Outcomes were physical activity during leisure time, during transports, and at work. Results For all three domains of physical activity, for men and women, the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> model with additive effects fit the data best. In this model, social class at ages 0, 5, 10, 30, and 34 years were associated with physical activity at age 34 years, although the magnitude and {{the direction of the}} associations for social class at each age varied by physical activity outcome and by sex.

40|$|Background and aims: The {{level of}} {{physical}} activity often declines in old age, although many older {{people would like to}} be more active than what they are capable of. This leads to unmet physical activity need, the feeling that one’s level {{of physical activity}} is inadequate, which is a manifestation of disparity in physical activity in old age. The <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> factors, including mobility limitations, low socioeconomic status (SES) and lack of social support may increase disparity in physical activity. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate how the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> factors is associated with unmet physical activity need in older community-living people. Methods: The study was based on cross-sectional analyses of an observational study with 632 participants. Unmet physical activity need, SES, mobility limitations and availability of social support were self-reported by standardized questionnaires. Results: Having mobility limitations increased the <b>risk</b> <b>of</b> unmet physical activity need almost four-fold compared to those with no mobility limitations; having mobility limitations and either low SES or not having social support increased the risk over four-fold and having mobility limitations, low SES and no social support further increased the risk over seven-fold.

40|$|Although typical {{clinical}} onset {{does not}} occur until adulthood, cardiovascular disease (CVD) may have a long natural history with <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> beginning in early life and continuing through childhood and into adolescence and adulthood. Therefore, {{it is important to}} adopt a life-course approach to explore <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks,</b> as well as identifying age-defined windows of susceptibility, from early life to disease onset. This thesis examines characteristics in adolescence and adulthood linked with subsequent risk of CVD. One area is concerned with physical and psychological characteristics in adolescence, which reflects inherited and acquired elements from childhood, and their association with occurrence and outcome of subsequent stroke and coronary heart disease many years later. The second area focuses on severe infections and subsequent delayed risk of CVD. Data from several Swedish registers were used to provide information on a general population-based cohort of men. Some 284 198 males, born in Sweden from 1952 to 1956 and included in the Swedish Military Conscription Register, form the basis of the study cohort for this thesis. Our results indicate that characteristics already present in adolescence may have an important role in determining long-term cardiovascular health. Stress resilience in adolescence was associated with an increased risk of stroke and CHD, working in part through other CVD factors, in particular physical fitness. Stress resilience, unhealthy BMI and elevated blood pressure in adolescence were also associated with aspects of stroke severity among survivors of a first stroke. We demonstrated an association for severe infections (hospital admission for sepsis and pneumonia) in adulthood with subsequent delayed risk of CVD, independent of risk factors from adolescence. Persistent systemic inflammatory activity which could follow infection, and that might persist long after infections resolve, represents a possible mechanism. Interventions to protect against CVD should begin by adolescence; and there may be a period of heightened susceptibility in the years following severe infection when additional monitoring and interventions for CVD may be of value...|$|E
40|$|Has {{lobbying}} {{by financial}} institutions {{contributed to the}} financial crisis? This paper uses detailed information on financial institutions’ lobbying and mortgage lending activities to answer this question. We find that lobbying was associated with more risk-taking during 2000 - 07 and with worse outcomes in 2008. In particular, lenders lobbying more intensively on issues related to mortgage lending and securitization (i) originated mortgages with higher loan-to-income ratios, (ii) securitized a faster growing proportion of their loans, and (iii) had faster growing originations of mortgages. Moreover, delinquency rates in 2008 were higher in areas where lobbying lenders’ mortgage lending grew faster. These lenders also experienced negative abnormal stock returns during the rescue of Bear Stearns {{and the collapse of}} Lehman Brothers, but positive abnormal returns when the bailout was announced. Finally, we find a higher bailout probability for lobbying lenders. These findings suggest that lending by politically active lenders played a role in <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> and thus contributed to the financial crisis. ...|$|E

This has created a dangerous <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> for the world economy. The private sector can only successfully deleverage (i. e., reduce its debt) if someone else is willing to take on higher debt and support demand.

As the developing world is both unable and unwilling to accept the role of debtor of last resort, dangerous pressures are building up.

40|$|This study uses a social-ecological {{approach}} {{to the development of}} delinquency. The authors emphasize that a balance between eliminating risk and enhancing protection across domains is essential in reducing problems and promoting competence.

However, most DP’s are granted later in working life, and the mechanisms of the association are not fully understood. We aimed to investigate the association between {{cognitive ability}} in late adolescence and DP at ages 40 - 59, and investigate the role of individual and socioeconomic factors. Information on cognitive ability, health status, personality aspects and health behaviours at age 18 - 20 was obtained from the 1969 - 70 conscription cohort, comprising 49 321 Swedish men. Data on DP’s 1991 - 2008 was obtained from the Longitudinal Database of Education, Income and Employment. Information on socioeconomic and work-related factors in childhood and adulthood was obtained from national sociodemographic databases. Hazard ratios for DP during follow-up were estimated by Cox proportional hazards models. We found a graded relationship between cognitive ability in late adolescence and DP in middle age. One step decrease on the nine-point stanine scale of cognitive ability was associated with a crude hazard ratio of 1. 26 (95 % CI 1. 24 - 1. 27). Socioeconomic and work-related circumstances in adulthood explained much of the association, but factors measured already in late adolescence also showed importance.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} link between {{unemployment}} and health. The negative health selection hypothesis, which proposes that poor health poses an unemployment risk, is tested {{using data from the}} German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP). The statistical influence of health related variables on the duration of employment for a cohort of workers is estimated. Results from the Cox proportional hazards regression model show gender and nationality specific negative selection. In the event of a long or chronic illness female workers are at a higher risk of unemployment than male workers. Whereas chronic illness raises the probability of unemployment among foreign workers, there is no statistical evidence for this for German workers. The paper, thus, shows that health factors determining unemployment affect different types of workers in different ways. Consequently, results from aggregate studies may be misleading. A second result of the paper is that, irrespective of gender and nationality, there is strong evidence for lagged state dependence on previous spells of unemployment, i. e. individuals who had experienced unemployment previously were more at risk of renewed unemployment than those without such spells. These findings do not only confirm the selection hypothesis, but also illustrate how labour market risks are closely associated with attributes of social inequality and how this could result in the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> for those who are socially or politically vulnerable in the labour market. ...|$|E

30|$|It {{is worth}} noting that when the risk ratio {{coefficient}} of interactive items between financing constraints and innovative behavior is greater than 1, innovative behavior would accelerate the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> of financing constraints, thus enterprises with financing constraints should not do any innovative activities. The possible reason is that innovative process requires considerable investment and undertake huge risk (Chuntao and Min 2015). Once the innovative activities can not be transferred into income in a short period, coupled with the huge restraints for enterprises in the financing channels and methods, enterprises’ cash flow will appear a lot of problems that may increase their probability of withdrawing from market. Therefore, for enterprises whose financing is rather limited, we should carefully choose the inputs in innovative activities. This conclusion reflects the dilemma Chinese companies experience at this stage. Especially for small- and medium-sized enterprises, they have faced financing difficulties of “uneasy and expensive financing,” such as high threshold, unitary ways, narrow channels, high cost, and the huge funding gap. Under such background of the financing constraints, small- and medium-sized enterprises generally do not choose to make investment in the risky innovative activities, for their innovative impetus is insufficient. In addition, return on sales, export intensity ownership type, and interactive items of innovative behaviors failed to pass the test of significance, suggesting that the profit ability, export intensity, and differences on ownership can exert adjustment on survival time.|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{identified}} associations between poverty {{and development of}} self-regulation during childhood, which is broadly defined as those skills involved in cognitive, emotional, and stress self-regulation. These skills are influenced by different individual and contextual factors at multiple levels of analysis (i. e., individual, family, social, and cultural). Available {{evidence suggests that the}} influences of those biological, psychosocial, and sociocultural factors on emotional and cognitive development can vary according to the type, number, <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks,</b> and co-occurrence of adverse circumstances that are related to poverty, the time in which these factors exert their influences, and the individual susceptibility to them. Complementary, during the past three decades, several experimental interventions that were aimed at optimizing development of self-regulation of children who live in poverty have been designed, implemented, and evaluated. Their results suggest {{that it is possible to}} optimize different aspects of cognitive performance and that it would be possible to transfer some aspects of these gains to other cognitive domains and academic achievement. We suggest that it is an important task for ethics, notably but not exclusively neuroethics, to engage in this interdisciplinary research domain to contribute analyses of key concepts, arguments, and interpretations.

40|$|To {{understand}} the fiscal {{position of a}} country, contingent liabilities and other sources of fiscal risk need to be considered. The authors develop a framework to assess and manage fiscal risk in Bulgaria. Bulgaria's Currency Board Arrangement has effectively imposed fiscal discipline, but leaves only limited room to accommodate potential fiscal shocks. Through risks embedded in the portfolio of government contingent and direct liabilities, significant fiscal pressures could arise in the future. Major sources of risk include environmental liabilities and investment requirements, collection capacities of the social protection institutions, and further engagement in off-budget programs, such as government guarantees. To limit the Government's exposure to risks, yet accommodate investment needs crucial to growth and development, Bulgaria must find an optimal strategy for liability management, fiscal reserves, and risk mitigation. Priorities for dealing with existing risks and limiting further <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> include: 1) Mitigating currency and interest rate risks in the government liability structure. 2) Implementing proposed institutional and finance reform of the country's pension and health care systems. 3) Building adequate contingency reserves. 4) Introducing risk-sharing arrangements. 5) Prioritizing and placing strict limits on the amounts of new guaranteed obligations. 6) Developing government capacity to analyze and manage risks. 7) Fully integrating fiscal risk management with other policy considerations in fiscal management, {{as part of an}} integrated asset and liability management strategy.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional analyses of data from a cohort study, and literature review. METHOD: We used data from the prospective TRacking Adolescents' Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS) study (n= 2230) and computed prevalences <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> behaviours and psychosocial health problems at the ages of 13 and 16 years. We assessed the evidence for effectiveness of preventive interventions in systematic reviews. RESULTS: Risk behaviours like insufficient consumption of fruit and vegetables and skipping breakfast were common among adolescents. Between 13 to 16 years the prevalence of overweight increased from 11. 0 % to 15. 0 %. The lifetime prevalence of smoking among the young people increased from 36. 3 % to 55. 7 % and of use of alcohol from 74. 0 % to 92. 3 %. Most risk behaviour prevalences were higher among adolescents with a lower educational level and those with two low-educated parents. These adolescents more commonly also had > 5 risk behaviours or psychosocial problems. The prevalence of depressive symptoms increased from 5. 5 % in 13 -year-olds to 8. 4 % in 16 -year-olds. The literature review showed that collective interventions, whether multifaceted or otherwise, may be particularly effective in the prevention of a high-risk lifestyle and overweight. Both indicated and collective prevention were effective for dealing with psychosocial problems.

This paper aims to reveal the inhibition effect of innovative activities on the enterprises’ survival risk can prolong the survival time of enterprises. In particular, the targets include using micro-level data of China’s industrial enterprises from 2000 to 2007 and investigate the innovative behavior’s influence on enterprises’ survival time by using quasi natural experiment design. Research results show that, first of all, the innovative enterprises have better ability to resist risk than non-innovative enterprises, as innovative activities release about 12 % survival risk and can increase their survival time of 0.84  years. Each additional unit of the innovation strength can lower the risk of the survival of 28.3 % on average, which verifies the efficacy of the micro approach towards enterprises’ survival of present innovation-driven development strategy formulated by the Chinese government. Second, the inhibition effect of R&D intensity to the enterprises’ survival present non-stationary characteristics. When the R&D intensity reaches a certain threshold, the inhibition effect of enterprise risk began to gradually decline; finally, the difference of the enterprises’ internal characteristics will change the inhibition effect of innovation activity on survival risk. The incremental effect of innovative activities from large enterprises with high productivity is more apparent, as innovative activities help ease the survival risk agglomeration of enterprises established long time ago. Innovative behavior, however, will accelerate <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> from financing constraints, so enterprises with financing limit should not conduct innovative activities.|$|E
40|$|Introduction Families {{with complex}} and {{multiple}} problems {{are faced with}} an accumulation of problems across multiple areas of life. Furthermore, these families are often considered to be ‘difficult to treat’. Children and teenagers growing up in these families are exposed to an <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> and are adversely affected in their cognitive, social, emotional, and health development. A prominently used type of intervention for these families is Home Visiting (HV). Whereas positive effects of HV on parental stress and family functioning have been established, child outcomes show only moderate or incoherent patterns of change. Possible explanations of this phenomenon are 1) that existing interventions are too short to realize sustainable change and 2) that children receive too little attention in family-focused interventions (Knot-Dickscheit, Thoburn & Knorth, 2016). Objective The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate which child outcomes are reported in evaluation studies of HV and how HV affects these outcomes. Methods A systematic review was conducted using the PsycInfo, ERIC, SocIndex, MedLine and Picarta databases. The focus of this study was on home visiting programs for families with complex problems. In focusing on child outcomes we excluded reports of parent or family-related measures and only included measures related to child development such as cognitive development, social skills and problem behavior. Finally, studies from before 1980 were excluded. Outcomes Multiple child outcomes of HV programs are reported such as decreased externalizing problem behavior, decreased delinquency and prevention of out-of-home placement.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} current {{reality of a}} South African city, Cape Town. Based on the literature it has been established that {{a large proportion of}} South Africa’s population lives in urban areas. South African cities are centres of opportunities and have the promise of a better life but they are also characterised by marginalisation, poverty and poorly managed urban growth. Informal settlements have become a ubiquitous feature of South Africa’s urban landscape. The combination of poverty, marginality, overcrowding and limited service provision, exposes residents to a range of ongoing hazards, particularly informal dwelling fires which creates an environment prone to risks and can be devastating for affected households. The current response from government has been analysed through the process of interviewing government officials; policy and institutional analysis, is to temporarily house people in Temporary Relocation Areas (TRAs) if affected by a situation that leaves them rendered homeless. It is believed to be an adequate response. However, as the research reveals, this response often exacerbates people’s resilience to deal with the disaster and the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>risks</b> found in informal settlements. Additionally it further places people in a vulnerable situation as Temporary Relocation Areas (TRAs) have limited service provision and are often located in remote areas far from opportunity centres. The intention of the research was {{to come up with a}} new strategy to address emergency response in the form of settlement provision for those affected by disasters. It was further discovered that there needs to be a more sustainable approach that would reduce risk accumulation in informal settlements in a proactive manner in order to mitigate the occurrence of disasters and slowly build resilience...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{research}} has illustrated the importance <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> and protectivefactors on offending. The current study examines survey {{data from a}} sample of 81 offenders and 81 nonoffenders residing in Wuhan, China, in 1991 / 92 {{to determine how the}} <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> and protective factors in various domains differentiates offenders from nonoffenders. Specifically, we examine the importance of multiple causation and cumulative effects <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> and protective factors as they apply in a Chinese context. Results suggest that the risk and protective factor approach often used in studies of western offending also holds promise in studies of Chinese offending. Specifically, our findings support the importance of examining multiple causation and cumulative effects <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> and protective factors as related to offending. The findings also suggest that the risk and protective factors found to be important in China may be somewhat different to those identified through studies conducted in the West, illustrating the impor-tance of recognising historical and cultural context in the risk and protec-tive factor paradigm...|$|R
40|$|Many {{observers}} {{argue that}} the abnormal <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> by banks {{has been one of}} the major causes of the 2007 - 2009 nancial turmoil. But what could have pushed banks to engage in such a risk race? The answer brought by this paper builds on the classical signaling model by Spence. If banks' returns can be observed while risk cannot, less efficient banks can hide their type by taking more risks and paying the same returns as the efficient banks. The latter can signal themselves by taking even higher risks and delivering bigger returns. The game presents several equilibria that are all characterized by excessive risk taking as compared to the perfect information case.

40|$|Abstract The {{prevalence}} of pre-diabetes is increasing worldwide and may start 7 to 10 {{years before the}} clinical diagnosis of diabetes. In this stage the presence and <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>risk</b> factors is common and already implies an increase in cardiovascular risk. Likewise, the onset of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), mainly coronary artery disease (CAD), peripheral vascular disease and cerebrovascular disease can also take place, all of which account for high rates {{of morbidity and mortality}} worldwide. Considering pre-diabetes as a clinical entity, non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments are indicated with drugs which have shown clinical benefits related to reduction in morbidity and mortality. However, there is still need for new long-term studies to assess the real benefits of several new therapeutical approaches, as well as its cost-effectiveness. </p...|$|R
