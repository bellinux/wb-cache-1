50|$|In {{the home}} shop the <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> is <b>an</b> {{alternative}} to the table saw. Both machines can rip, crosscut, do simple and compound miters, dado, mold or shape, make tenons, make open mortises, taper cut, and rabbet. The <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> requires less clearance or space in the shop to handle long stock, since it only requires clearance on the sides, whereas a table saw needs clearance to the sides, in front and at the back. The radial saw is perfectly efficient backed up against a wall, whereas the table saw needs {{to be placed in}} the center of the shop to give all around clearance. With some accessories the former can be used as a shaper, a disk or drum sander, a grinder, a surface planer, a router, a horizontal boring machine and even as a power unit for a lathe; whereas a table saw's secondary uses are limited to shaper and disk sander. The major shortcoming of most current <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saws</b> for home-use is that, most <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saws</b> that have been built after the early 1960s are manufactured with stamped sheet metal parts and are machined to loose tolerances, hence they are not precise for doing accurate work without 'tuning'. <b>A</b> high-quality <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> has carefully machined track arm ways and locking mechanisms, and a motor that runs very smoothly; under 'no-load' conditions most of the sound and vibration will originate from the whisper/whistling and the imbalance of the saw blade upon the arbor.|$|R

5000|$|By {{the early}} 2000s, the <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> was well into its demise. In a 7-July-2010 article [...] "Is the <b>Radial</b> <b>Arm</b> <b>Saw</b> on its Last Legs?," [...] Tom McKenna, Managing Editor of Fine Woodworking, opined that it was, for these reasons: ...|$|R

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> is {{a cutting}} machine {{consisting}} of a circular saw mounted on a sliding horizontal arm. Invented by Raymond DeWalt in 1922, the radial arm saw was the primary tool used for cutting long pieces of stock to length until {{the introduction of the}} power miter saw in the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the advent}} of the radial arm saw, table saws and hand saws were most {{commonly}} used for crosscutting lumber. Table saws can easily rip stock, but it is awkward to push a long piece of stock widthwise through a table saw blade. In contrast, when <b>a</b> <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> is used for crosscutting, the stock remains stationary on the saw's table, and the blade is pulled through it.|$|E
50|$|Applications: <b>Radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saws,</b> scanners, printers.|$|R
50|$|During {{the late}} 1970s, the {{compound}} miter saw began to replace the <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw,</b> but only for crosscuts and miter cuts since miter saws are unable to perform rip cuts. The <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> can be less safe when used by an inexperienced or untrained operator, but is not as dangerous when used properly. In {{the hands of an}} experienced operator, the <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> can safely cut compound miters necessary for picture and door frames, rip lumber precisely to width, cut tongues and grooves, and make variable dadoes. Like the compound miter <b>saw,</b> the <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> can make these cuts with absolute precision, but is capable of making a wider variety of cuts, including more complex ones.|$|R
50|$|The {{demise of}} the <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> can be {{observed}} in the products for sale by tool retailers. As of May, 2014, Sears showed only one <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> in its online catalog, Amazon listed only two (one of which was the Sears model), and Grizzly, Jet, and Tool Zone listed none.|$|R

50|$|Rip {{cuts are}} {{commonly}} {{made with a}} table saw, but other types of power saws can also be used, including <b>a</b> <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw,</b> band saw, and hand held circular saw. In sawmills the head saw is the first rip-saw a log goes through, which is sometimes a gang-saw, and then the cants may be resawn using other saws and then edged in a edger and sometimes cut to length by a crosscut saw. Also, smaller portable sawmills and chainsaw mills use rip-cuts to produce lumber. Each time {{a piece of wood}} is rip cut it takes time and the kerf material turns into sawdust and loses value so the number and width of each rip cut influence the economics of the operation: This gives band saws an advantage over circular saws and chainsaws.|$|E
50|$|As {{a general}} rule, tools which {{work well for}} rip cutting do not work well for crosscutting. Most woodworkers thus have a table saw, which is used for rip cutting, and a {{separate}} chop or miter saw, which is used for crosscutting. Crosscut power-saws should never be used for ripping a board because it is very dangerous. Circular saw blades designed for rip cutting have {{a smaller number of}} larger teeth than similar blades designed for cross cutting. There are combination blades for table saws {{that can be used for}} ripping and cross cutting but should not be used for non through cuts such as dados and rabbets. If you use <b>a</b> <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> to rip you need a blade with a negative hook angle for the teeth to keep the saw from lifting the board off the saw and kicking back.|$|E
50|$|Raymond Elmer DeWalt (October 9, 1885 - May 8, 1961) was an American {{inventor}} and entrepreneur, {{he invented}} the <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> in 1922. In 1924, he founded DeWALT Products Company in Leola, Pennsylvania, to manufacture {{and sell the}} “Wonder-Worker” (his name for the <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw).</b> He was born in Oakland, Pennsylvania and died in Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania.|$|R
5000|$|Power {{compound}} miter saws, {{and especially}} the sliding type, have replaced <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saws</b> for many woodworkers for MITER cuts.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saws</b> {{are safer}} with a blade {{with a very}} low or {{negative}} hook angle, to inhibit overly fast feed rate, binding, and the blade's tendency to try to [...] "climb" [...] the material. Also, a 10 deg. positive hook blade with a [...] "triple chip profile" [...] works well on the <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> and {{can be considered a}} universal blade. If the saw climbs with this blade, the yoke roller bearings need to be adjusted and tightened.|$|R
5000|$|Originally, {{circular}} saws in mills had smaller blades and {{were used to}} resaw lumber after it passed through an [...] "up and down" [...] (muley or sash) saw leaving both vertical and circular saw marks on different {{sides of the same}} piece. These saws made it more efficient to cut small pieces such as lath.After 1813 or 1822 saw mills use large {{circular saws}}, up to 3 meters (9 ft) in diameter. Large saws demand more power than up-and-down saws and did not become practical for sawing timbers until they were powered by steam engines. They are either left or right-handed, depending on which side of the blade the plank falls away from. Benching determines which hand the saw is. Saws of this size typically have a shear pin hole, off axis, that breaks if the saw is overloaded and allows the saw to spin free. The most common version is the ITCO (insert tooth cut-off) which has replaceable teeth. Sawmill blades are also used as an alternative to <b>a</b> <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Broadway or stage flats are {{generally}} constructed of 1 × 3 in nominal (3/4 × 2+1/2 in actual) pine boards. The boards {{are laid out}} flat on the shop floor, squared, and joined with the keystones and corner blocks. The keystones and corner blocks are inset 1 in from the outside edge, which allows for flats to be hinged or butted together. They are then glued in place, and stapled or screwed down. The flat can then be flipped over and covered with muslin or decorative plywood. Toggles in a Broadway flat are placed on 4 ft centers. Broadway flats can also be constructed using half-lap joints {{at the end of}} the boards, known as dados (these would be termed a rabbets by a woodworker). Dados forgo the use of keystones and corner blocks, and joins stiles, rails, and toggles, by sawing a 3/8 in deep half-lap at the ends of the pieces, which are then glued and stapled to form a half-lap joint. Dados can be made using <b>a</b> <b>radial</b> <b>arm</b> <b>saw</b> or table saw, and a dado stack cutter (two outer circular saw blades and one or more [...] "chippers" [...] between them, giving a much wider cut). Setting up for a dado stack is approximately the same as for preparing keystones and cornerblocks, but requires less layout, as the length of stiles, rails and, toggles are equal to the face of your flat.|$|E
