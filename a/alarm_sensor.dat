40|$|We {{consider}} the distributed detection {{problem with a}} large num-ber of identical sensors deployed over a space where the phe-nomenon of interest has different signal strength depending on lo-cation. Each sensor makes a decision based on its own measure-ment of the spatially varying signal and the local decision of each sensor is sent to a fusion center through a multiple access channel. The fusion center decides whether the phenomenon of interest oc-curred or not with a global size constraint under Neyman-Pearson context. Assuming that the initial distribution of sensors is a ho-mogeneous spatial Poisson process, we showed that the distribu-tion of <b>alarmed</b> <b>sensors</b> satisfies the locally asymptotic normality (LAN) condition {{as the number of}} sensor goes to infinity and de-rived a new asymptotically locally optimal criterion for the detec-tion of the spatially varying signal. We showed that an optimal test statistic is a weighted sum of local decisions and the optimal weight function is the shape of the spatial signal of interest and the exact value of the spatial signal is not required. It is shown that the spatial signal is translated to the local intensity of <b>alarmed</b> <b>sensors</b> with Poisson assumption and the optimal weight is easily estimated {{based on the number of}} <b>alarmed</b> <b>sensors</b> and their loca-tions.

40|$|Data {{from two}} {{full-scale}} residential smoke alarm fire test series were analyzed {{to estimate the}} performance of dual sensor photoelectric/ionization alarms as compared to co-located individual photoelectric and ionization alarms. Dual alarms and aggregated photoelectric and ionization alarm responses were used to estimate dual alarm performance. It was observed that dual alarms with equivalent or higher sensitivity settings performed better than individual photoelectric or ionization alarms over a range of flaming and smoldering fire scenarios. In one test series, dual alarms activated 539 s faster than ionization alarms and 79 s faster than photoelectric alarms on average. In another test series, individual <b>alarm</b> <b>sensor</b> outputs were calibrated against a reference smoke source in terms of light obscuration over a path length (percent smoke obscuration per unit length) so that alarm thresholds could be defined by the sensor outputs.

With funding provided by Nuclear Energy Research Initiative (NERI), design of Secure, Transportable, Autonomous Reactors (STAR) to aid countries with insufficient energy supplies is underway.

The two goals of this monitoring system are to control the use of nuclear materials and to monitor the performance of the facility from a remote location.

The flaming coal subsequently ignited the conveyor belt located approximately 5 to 10 cm above the coal pile.
