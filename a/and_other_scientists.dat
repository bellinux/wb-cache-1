5|$|Beginning in 1916, Canadian {{physicist}} Robert William Boyle <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>scientists</b> of the Anti-Submarine Detection Investigation Committee (ASDIC) undertook research {{which ultimately}} {{led to the development}} of sonar technology. Acoustic sounding equipment was developed which could be operated much more rapidly than the sounding lines, thus enabling the German Meteor expedition aboard the German research vessel Meteor (1925–27) to take frequent soundings on east-west Atlantic transects. Maps produced from these techniques show the major Atlantic basins, but the depth precision of these early instruments was not sufficient to reveal the flat featureless abyssal plains.|$|E

5|$|The British and Germans {{had been}} {{competing}} in radar technology {{for nearly a}} decade at this point, with the German technology often at the same level as the British or surpassing them due to heavy investment in the fledgling technology. By the beginning of World War II, Britain had devised effective radar systems, primarily through the work of Robert Watson-Watt, although much of the technology was still rudimentary in nature and Watson-Watt <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>scientists</b> had failed to devise an effective night-defence system in time for the German nighttime bombing of Britain during 1940.|$|E
5|$|The Forest Service <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>scientists</b> are {{currently}} studying the biological {{effects from the}} fire. There were 45 California spotted owl breeding sites within the Rim Fire perimeter on Forest Service land, and one year post-fire they had the highest-ever recorded occupancy rate for California spotted owls. Spotted owl sites with 100% high-severity burn were occupied by pairs {{at the same rate}} as unburned sites. The Rim Fire contains many populations of rare California endemic flowers such as Clarkia australis and Clarkia biloba ssp. australis in places where plantation trees burned; these areas, however, are to be disturbed by planned thinning. Researchers estimate that the Rim Fire burned nearly one-fifth of known great gray owl nesting sites, but post-fire surveys found no significant difference in owl detection at burned versus unburned sites. A study of how pre-fire forest conditions affected fire severity found that weather, time since the last fire, and shrub cover had strong positive associations with fire severity, and that under extreme weather conditions, as is often the case with fires that escape initial attack, large areas of high-severity fire are created even in fuels-reduced forests with restored fire regimes.|$|E
5|$|Like other nodosaurids, Sauropelta {{was covered}} in armor formed from bony masses {{embedded}} in the skin (osteoderms). The discovery of a skeleton with the body armor preserved in situ allowed Carpenter <b>and</b> <b>other</b> <b>scientists</b> to accurately describe this protection. Two parallel rows of domed scutes ran down {{the top of the}} neck, along the anteroposterior axis (front to back). On the upper surface of the back and tail, the skin {{was covered in}} small, bony nodules (ossicles), which separated larger conical scutes arranged in parallel rows along the mediolateral axis (side to side). Over the hips, the ossicles and larger domed plates were interlocked very tightly to form a structure called a sacral shield. This shield is also found in ankylosaurs like Polacanthus and Antarctopelta. Large, pointed spines lined the sides of the neck, increasing in size towards the shoulders, and then decreasing in size again {{along the side of the}} body until they stopped just before the hips. Behind the hips, flat triangular plates lined the tail on both sides, pointing laterally (outwards) and decreasing in size towards the end of the tail. Carpenter originally described the cervical (neck) spines and caudal plates as belonging to a single row on each side, although more recently he and Jim Kirkland reconstructed them in two parallel rows on each side, one above the other. The upper row of cervical spines pointed backwards and upwards (posterodorsally), while the lower row pointed backwards and outwards (posterolaterally). The bases of each pair of cervical spines and each pair of caudal plates were fused together, greatly restricting mobility in both the neck and upper tail.|$|E

25|$|When the 23-year-old Albert Einstein {{started the}} Olympia Academy study group in 1902, {{with his two}} younger friends, Maurice Solovine and Conrad Habicht, his first reading {{suggestion}} was Pearson's The Grammar of Science.

Irreversibility of natural processes, he claimed, is a purely relative conception. An observer who travels at the exact velocity of light would see an eternal now, or an absence of motion. He speculated that an observer who travelled faster than light would see time reversal, similar to a cinema film being run backwards. Pearson also discussed antimatter, the fourth dimension, and wrinkles in time.|$|E
