5|$|Multilingualism {{had been}} {{characteristic}} of Sicily for centuries, resulting from occupations by the Carthaginians, Greeks, and Romans. While {{the slave trade}} during the Republican period brought speakers of Greek and other languages from the East to the island, Greek was the language of higher-status persons such as government officials and businessmen during the Imperial era. Immigration to Sicily in the early Empire originated more often in places where Latin was spoken than in Greek-speaking areas. African speakers of Latin were a significant presence in Sicily. Christian inscriptions <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be in Greek. In late antiquity, Greek-Latin bilingualism was common enough {{that it would have}} been acquired through everyday personal interaction. The Jewish communities of Syracuse seem to have been bilingual in Greek and Hebrew. There is some Sicilian evidence of Syriac.|$|E
5|$|The {{prevalence}} of Alzheimer's Disease in the United States {{is estimated at}} 5.1 million, and of these two thirds are women. Furthermore, women <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> {{to be the primary}} caregivers of adult family members with depression, so that they bear both the risks and burdens of this disease. The lifetime risk for a woman of developing Alzeimer's is twice that of men. Part of this difference may be due to life expectancy, but changing hormonal status over their lifetime may also play a par as may differences in gene expression. Deaths due to dementia are higher in women than men (4.5% of deaths vs. 2.0%).|$|E

50|$|When {{viewed as}} action (LHS) and {{inaction}} (RHS) the anthropological {{development of these}} structures becomes elementary and logical. In environments of scarcity, like those faced by non-human animals, taking risks is the foundational approach to survival. In scarcity it <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to die of starvation than to damaging stimuli from hostile animals or situations. However, in environments of abundance, as humans have observed, it <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to die to damaging stimuli than of starvation. As such the anthropological development of first LHS then much later RHS is understandable.|$|R

25|$|Since the 1930s, a {{critical}} component of the Democratic Party coalition has been organized labor.

This disparity is shown in the graph on the right, which is from a book published in 2008 by Joseph Fried. The tendency of Republicans to view gay and lesbian people negatively could be based on homophobia, religious beliefs, or conservatism with respect to the traditional family.|$|E

Researchers found that in general, P. alcon <b>was</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to parasitize the host ant than P. rebeli; however, ant nests that supported the P. alcon were much smaller and supported lower populations than ant nests that supported P. rebeli.|$|R
25|$|The {{per capita}} {{immigration}} rate to Canada {{has been relatively}} constant since the 1950s, and recent years have seen a steady increase in the education and skill level of immigrants to Canada. However, over the last 25 years the economic position of newcomers to Canada relative to the native population has steadily declined. A 2007 Statistics Canada study shows that the income profile of recent facsimile s deteriorated by a significant amount from 2000 to 2004. Recent immigrants themselves <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than native born Canadians to initially have low incomes, with income and employment rates increasing towards the national average with more time spent in Canada.|$|E
25|$|Violence {{against women}} is a {{widespread}} global occurrence with serious public health implications. This {{is a result of}} social and gender bias. Many societies in developing nations function on a patriarchal framework, where women are often viewed as a form of property and as socially inferior to men. This unequal standing in the social hierarchy has led women to be physically, emotionally, and sexually abused by men, both as children and adults. These abuses usually constitute some form of violence. Although children of both sexes do suffer from physical maltreatment, sexual abuse, and other forms of exploitation and violence, studies have indicated that young girls <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> than boys to experience sexual abuse. In a 2004 study on child abuse, 25.3% of all girls surveyed experienced some form of sexual abuse, a percentage that is three times higher than that of boys (8.7%).|$|E
25|$|Apart from {{a couple}} of Oxbridge events, student sport has a very low profile in the United Kingdom. While {{universities}} have significant sports facilities, there was no system of sports scholarships, with tuition fees only being introduced in the late 90s. However students who are elite standard competitors are eligible for funding from bodies such as UK Sport on the same basis as anyone else. The university most focused on sports provision is Loughborough University. Budding professionals in the traditionally working class team sports of football and rugby league rarely go to university. Talented youngsters in the more middle class sports of cricket and rugby union <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to attend university, but their sports clubs usually play a greater role in developing their talent than their university coaches. Some sports are attempting to adapt to new conditions in which a far higher proportion of British teenagers attend university than in the past, notably cricket, which has established several university centres of excellence.|$|E

25|$|The {{two most}} viable {{explanations}} put forth {{for the existence}} of blue stragglers both involve interactions between cluster members. One explanation is that they are current or former binary stars that {{are in the process of}} merging or have already done so. The merger of two stars would create a single more massive star, potentially with a mass larger than that of stars at the main-sequence turn-off point. While a star born with a mass larger than that of stars at the turn-off point would have already evolved off of the main sequence, a more massive star which formed via merger would not have evolved as quickly. There is evidence in favor of this view, notably that blue stragglers appear to be much more common in dense regions of clusters, especially in the cores of globular clusters. Since there are more stars per unit volume, collisions and close encounters <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> in clusters than among field stars and calculations of the expected number of collisions are consistent with the observed number of blue stragglers.|$|E

25|$|Melanoma only {{occurs in}} a small {{proportion}} of the population. Only 10% of those who have melanoma acquired it genetically. This disease is an autosomal dominant gene. If only two family members have melanoma, there is a 5% chance somebody in the next generation will acquire the mutated gene. Also, there is a 20-40% chance of getting hereditary melanoma in a family if 3 or more people in the past generation had melanoma. For those who carry the hereditary mutated gene CDKN2A, acquiring skin cancer is a lot easier. Those who have the gene <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to get melanoma a second or third time compared to those who don’t genetically have this gene. The population that is affected by this mutation has a high familial history of melanoma or atypical moles and birth marks in large numbers, a history of primary melanoma/cancers in general, immunosuppression, skin that burns easily and doesn't tan, freckling, blue eyes, red hair, or a history of blistering. People with these high risk factors are more likely to carry inherited mutations in CDKN2A. For those who have a gene mutation, the severity is also dependent on the environmental surroundings. Out of those who carry the gene, those who express the phenotype and actually developed melanoma have a history of more sun exposure, and light skin compared to those who also had the gene but never actually developed melanoma. This suggests that this gene co-works with ones surrounding environment. If two individuals are selected who carry the CDKN2A mutation, and both genetically have the same probability of acquiring skin cancer, but one is from Australia and the other is from Europe, there is a 58% the European will acquire cancer compared to a 91% chance the Australian will get it. This is because the factors mentioned earlier pertaining to those who are more susceptible to the disease and also dependent on the amount of sunscreen one wears and the UV radiation potency in their environment.|$|E

500|$|Pesticides used on {{bee forage}} <b>are</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> {{to enter the}} colony by the pollen stores rather than [...] nectar (because pollen is carried {{externally}} on the bees, while nectar is carried internally, and may kill the bee if too toxic), though not all potentially lethal chemicals, either natural or man-made, affect the adult bees; many primarily affect the brood, but brood die-off {{does not appear to}} be happening in CCD. Most significantly, brood are not fed honey, and adult bees consume relatively little pollen; accordingly, the pattern in CCD suggests, if contaminants or toxins from the environment 'are' responsible, it is most likely to be via the honey, as the adults are dying (or leaving), not the brood (though possibly effects of contaminated pollen consumed by juveniles may only show after they have developed into adults).|$|E
