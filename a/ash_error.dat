40|$|The spiral {{performed}} well in cleaning the coarse 8 x 16 mesh size fraction, {{as demonstrated by}} the Ep ranging from 0. 091 to 0. 177. This is in line with typical spiral performance. In addition, the presence of the coarser size fraction did not significantly affect spiral performance on the typical 16 x 100 mesh fraction, in which the Ep ranged from 0. 144 to 0. 250. Changes in solids concentration and flow rate did not show a clear correlation with spiral performance. However, for difficult-to-clean coals with high near-gravity material, such as this anthracite, a single-stage spiral cleaning such a wide size fraction {{may not be able to}} achieve the clean coal ash and yield specifications required. In the first place, while the performance of the spiral on the coarse 8 x 16 mesh fraction is good with regard to Ep, the cutpoints (SG 50 s) are high (1. 87 to 1. 92), which may result in a clean coal with a higher-than-desired ash content. And second, the combination of the spiral's higher overall cutpoint (1. 80) with the high near-gravity anthracite results in significant misplaced material that increases the clean coal <b>ash</b> <b>error.</b> In a case such as this, one solution may be to reclean the clean coal and middlings from the first-stage spiral in a second stage spiral...|$|E
40|$|In {{the event}} of a {{volcanic}} eruption the decision to close airspace is based on forecast ash maps, produced using volcanic ash transport and dispersion models. In this paper we quantitatively evaluate the spatial skill of volcanic ash simulations using satellite retrievals of ash from the Eyja allajökull eruption during the period from 7 to 16 May 2010. We find that at the start of this period, 7 – 10 May, the model (FLEXible PARTicle) has excellent skill and can predict the spatial distribution of the satellite-retrieved ash to within 0. 5 ∘ × 0. 5 ∘ latitude/longitude. However, on 10 May there is a decrease in the spatial accuracy of the model to 2. 5 ∘× 2. 5 ∘ latitude/longitude, and between 11 and 12 May the simulated <b>ash</b> location <b>errors</b> grow rapidly. On 11 May ash is located close to a bifurcation point in the atmosphere, resulting in a rapid divergence in the modeled and satellite ash locations. In general, the model skill reduces as the residence time of ash increases. However, the error growth is not always steady. Rapid increases in error growth are linked to key points in the ash trajectories. Ensemble modeling using perturbed meteorological data would help to represent this uncertainty, and assimilation of satellite ash data would help to reduce uncertainty in volcanic ash forecasts...|$|R
40|$|A {{retrieval}} of tropospheric volcanic ash from Mt Etna {{has been carried}} out, using measurements from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The NASA-MODIS satellite instrument acquires images in the 0. 4 to 14 μm spectral range with a spatial resolution of 1 km at nadir. The eruption which occurred on 24 November 2006 is considered as a test case in this work. In order to derive the ash plume optical thickness, the particle effective radius and the total mass, the Brightness Temperature Difference procedure {{has been applied to}} MODIS channels 31 (centered at 11 μm) and 32 (centered at 12 μm). Channel 5 (centered at 1. 24 μm) has been used to refine the cloud discrimination, exploiting the distinct reflectivity of meteorological and volcanic clouds in the near infrared spectral range. The detection of volcanic ash pixels has been significantly improved by applying an atmospheric water vapor correction to MODIS data. This procedure doubles the number of pixels identified as containing volcanic ash compared to the original method. The retrieved mean ash optical thickness at 0. 55 μm, mean particle effective radius and the total ash mass in the plume are 0. 4, 3. 5 μm and 3620 tons, respectively. A detailed sensitivity analysis has been carried out to investigate errors in the retrieval caused by the uncertainty in various parameters: surface temperature and emissivity, plume geometry (altitude and thickness), ash type and atmospheric water vapor. Results show that the largest contributions to retrieval errors are from uncertainty in surface parameters, aerosol type and atmospheric water vapor. The total tropospheric volcanic <b>ash</b> retrieval <b>errors</b> are estimated to be 30 %, 30 % and 40 % for mean AOT, mean effective radius and total mass retrieval, respectively. © 2008 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers...|$|R
60|$|This offence, on {{the part}} of one who felt within herself a great {{capacity}} to enjoy and to confer happiness, had arisen--like the other grievous and unpardonable offence, her marriage--from too much disposition to yield herself to the personality of another. But it was cold comfort to know that the desire to give and to receive love had twice over left her--a dead woman. Whatever the nature of those immature sensations with which, as a girl of twenty, she had accepted her husband, in her feeling towards Miltoun there was not only abandonment, but the higher flame of self-renunciation. She wanted to do the best for him, and had not even the consolation of the knowledge that she had sacrificed herself for his advantage. All had been taken out of her hands! Yet with characteristic fatalism she did not feel rebellious. If it were ordained that she should, for fifty, perhaps sixty years, repent in sterility and <b>ashes</b> that first <b>error</b> of her girlhood, rebellion was, none the less, too far-fetched. If she rebelled, it would not be in spirit, but in action. General principles were nothing to her; she lost no force brooding over the justice or injustice of her situation, but merely tried to digest its facts.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} on {{this research}} {{is to determine the}} nutrients contents in soybean products using 2 method analysis which are primary analysis and NIR analysis. The scope of study are focus on small scale production of soybean products. Small scale industry normally lack of good production because of the less technologies and experiences. Therefore,there is no specific data about nutrient contents in soybean foods that attached to the food packaging The primary analysis are bases on the conventional method;Kjedahl’s method to determine the protein contents,Soxhlet’s method to determine the fat contents,fiber method to determined the fiber contents and ash method to determine the ash content in soybean products. By using NIR,it cans analysis and determines the pattern of nutrient content in soybean products and compares the nutrient contents between NIR analysis and primary method analysis. From the experiment, the results between primary analysis and NIR analysis have small error and it almost similar as it discuss in chapter 4. Most of the nutrients contents; protein,fat,fiber and <b>ash</b> have small <b>errors.</b> NIR is a clone from primary analysis since all the data was determined from primary methods;Kjedahl Method,Soxhlet Method,Fiber Method and Ash Method. NIR is an instrument that will help to determined nutrients contents in faster route but somehow it is not too accurate since NIR consider with size,shape and distribution of particles of samples. The primary analysis is the best method to determine the nutrients contents since it more accurate compare than NIR analysi...|$|R
