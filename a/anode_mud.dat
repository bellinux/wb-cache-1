5|$|Selenium is most {{commonly}} produced from selenide in many sulfide ores, {{such as those}} of copper, nickel, or lead. Electrolytic metal refining is particularly productive of selenium as a byproduct, obtained from the <b>anode</b> <b>mud</b> of copper refineries. Another source was the mud from the lead chambers of sulfuric acid plants, a process that is no longer used. Selenium can be refined from these muds by a number of methods. However, most elemental selenium comes as a byproduct of refining copper or producing sulfuric acid. Since its invention, solvent extraction and electrowinning (SX/EW) production of copper produces an increasing share of the worldwide copper supply. This changes the availability of selenium because only a comparably small part of the selenium in the ore is leached with the copper.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{experimental results}} {{obtained from a}} series of laboratory scale electrowinning tests conducted over 5 months to quantify the effects of halides (chloride, fluoride and bromide) on the performance and corrosion of lead-silver anodes under conditions similar to those used during the electrowinning of zinc. The parameters investigated include operating anode potential, corrosion rate and <b>anode</b> scale/cell <b>mud</b> generation rates. Information was also obtained on the consumption of halides and manganese ions and the composition of the anode scale and cell mud. The results have confirmed plant observations of excessive anode corrosion and chlorine emissions at a chloride concentration of 400 mg/L but not at a concentration of 200 mg/L. It has also confirmed the importance of maintaining a suitable manganese(II) concentration in the electrolyte. Bromide and fluoride ions, albeit at lower concentrations, do not have measurable effects on anode corrosion. Although a definitive explanation for enhanced local corrosion at high chloride concentrations has not been advanced, the nature of the accelerated corrosion suggests that a crevice-like corrosion process is responsible for localized massive corrosion. This has been attributed to the presence of high acidity and permanganate ions between the manganese oxide layer and the alloy surface...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of sea mud {{state on the}} anodic behavior of Al-Zn-In-Mg-Ti sacrificial anode was investigated by the methods of electrochemical, immersion and surface analysis techniques. In this work, the simulated seawater, sea mud and seawater/sea mud transition region systems were set up in laboratory, it can measure the galvanic corrosion of sacrificial <b>anode</b> in seawater/sea <b>mud</b> transition environment. Results show that the corrosion rate of Al-Zn-In-Mg-Ti sacrificial anode in simulated seawater is higher than that in simulated sea mud. And the corrosion rate increased with the increasing size of sea mud. When the Al-Zn-In-Mg-Ti sacrificial anode and Q 235 joint together at the ratio of cathode and anode area of 50 : 1, the mix potential shift negative with the increasing size of sea mud and the mixed current density is highest in seawater and increase with the increasing size of sea mud. The corrosion rate {{is determined by the}} conductivity and dissolved oxygen in various mud size. In simulated seawater environment, Al-Zn-In-Mg-Ti sacrificial anode present relatively uniform dissolution; however, in simulated sea mud environment, due to the different dissolved oxygen in various mud size, Al-Zn-In-Mg-Ti sacrificial anode present nonuniform dissolving, especially in simulated lager particles sea mud...|$|R
500|$|Osmium is {{obtained}} commercially as a by-product from nickel and copper mining and processing.
