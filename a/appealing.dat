5|$|Bloomberg Businesss Jennifer Parker {{noted that}} the hotel was {{on the cutting edge}} of {{technology}} upon its opening, but questioned whether the hotel had any gender leanings. She found fault with the gym, toiletries, and delayed spa opening, but enjoyed the social ambiance, the normal retail prices of minibar items (rather than more standard hotel overpricing) and the top notch free Wi-Fi. She found many of the <b>appealing</b> elements of the designed to be dubiously marketed, but <b>appealing</b> nonetheless.|$|E
5|$|Corn oil, <b>appealing</b> {{because of}} the {{abundance}} of maize as a crop.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its strong}} {{advantage}} among younger women, and baby boomers reaching menopause, Playtex continued to gain market share on Tampax. After extensive market research, Tampax reversed that trend with the 2002 introduction of Pearl, with an applicator {{designed to be}} as visually <b>appealing</b> as it was functional, and making the brand once again <b>appealing</b> to teens.|$|E
5|$|Radish oil. Wild radish {{contains}} up to 48% oil, {{making it}} <b>appealing</b> as a fuel.|$|E
5|$|Rice bran oil, <b>appealing</b> {{because of}} lower cost {{than many other}} {{vegetable}} oils. Widely grown in Asia.|$|E
5|$|Soybean oil, not {{economical}} as a fuel crop, but <b>appealing</b> as {{a byproduct}} of soybean crops for other uses.|$|E
5|$|<b>Appealing</b> to {{a diverse}} {{audience}} {{was a key}} factor in the show's writing. The character of Frieda the foot was introduced specifically to highlight acceptance among children. Positive critical reception for the racially diverse cast of characters led to several episodes centered on the topic of tolerance.|$|E
5|$|At present, {{the city}} of Lawton is {{undertaking}} the Downtown Revitalization Project. Its goal is to redesign the areas between Elmer Thomas Park at the north through Central Mall to the south to be more visually <b>appealing</b> and pedestrian friendly to encourage business growth in the area.|$|E
5|$|In March 2008, reports {{emerged that}} a fresh set of {{criminal}} proceedings related to other acts of corruption were {{being investigated by}} the Macau Commission Against Corruption. In addition, the family members and the businessmen allegedly involved were <b>appealing</b> their convictions.|$|E
5|$|James Lewis {{argues that}} {{scientific}} themes are so prevalent in The Satanic Bible because LaVey was <b>appealing</b> {{to the authority}} of science to legitimize Satanism as a religion.|$|E
5|$|On October 2010, these {{versions}} {{were given}} alphanumeric designations with the INS/GPS version becoming the SBU-38 (SBU=Smart Bomb Unit), the INS/GPS/IIR version becoming the SBU-54 and the INS/GPS/SALH version becoming the SBU-64; {{the system as}} a whole was renamed Hammer to make it more <b>appealing</b> to export customers.|$|E
5|$|The Slime {{has been}} placed on a {{multitude}} of different kinds of merchandise. The Slime's friendliness, limited power, and <b>appealing</b> form have caused the Slime to become a popular character and symbol of the Dragon Quest series.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} {{also increased}} a drive for ballot access, <b>appealing</b> to supporters {{for help to}} get on the presidential ballot in Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Maryland, and West Virginia.|$|E
5|$|The {{mushroom}} is edible, {{although it}} may not be <b>appealing</b> to many due to its sliminess. In China, a yak milk beverage is made with H.eburnus and yak milk, by lactic acid fermentation with Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus acidophilus as mixed starter.|$|E
5|$|When <b>appealing</b> the District Court's decision, the {{government}} did not argue that there was reasonable suspicion. Instead, {{the government}} argued that the border search doctrine supported both the initial search and the transportation of the laptop to Tucson for examination.|$|E
5|$|Aide Greg Schneiders {{suggested}} an unusual strategy, inspired by Glenn's personal campaign and voting style, of avoiding <b>appealing</b> to {{special interest groups}} and instead seeking support from ordinary Democratic primary voters. After Mondale defeated him for the nomination, Glenn carried $3million in campaign debt for over 20years before receiving a reprieve from the Federal Election Commission. He was considered as a vice-presidential candidate in 1984, 1988, and 1992.|$|E
5|$|Akane {{was created}} to be a {{relatable}} character who would question the setting and answer the viewer's questions. Early in the show's development, the production staff planned the way Akane would mature throughout the story. Early critical reception to Akane has been mixed. Some critics saw her as typical new cop often seen in dramas; others criticized her as uninteresting. However, her growth in the story earned praise for becoming a highly <b>appealing</b> protagonist.|$|E
5|$|Bush was not {{a natural}} melodist à la Dvorák, though he could produce an <b>appealing</b> tune when he set his mind to it. But he was a first-rate contrapuntist, and his {{harmonic}} world can glow with a rare internal warmth. It {{would be foolish to}} claim that everything he wrote was a masterpiece – and equally idiotic to turn our backs on the many outstanding scores still awaiting assiduous attention.|$|E
5|$|Dissidia {{originated}} from Kingdom Hearts director Tetsuya Nomura's desire {{to create a}} spin-off for the franchise, but it was changed to the Final Fantasy series. Besides designing the characters, Nomura worked with the Square staff {{with the desire to}} make it <b>appealing</b> to Western players. Dissidia was well received commercially and critically, with positive reviews and sales of over 1.8 million. A follow-up titled Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy was released in March 2011, and features several new characters and gameplay features.|$|E
5|$|Halo 3 {{also had}} {{marketing}} tie-ins and promotions. PepsiCo {{announced a new}} line of soft drink, a variant of Mountain Dew named Game Fuel, branded with the Halo 3 logo and the Master Chief. Much of the advertising focused on <b>appealing</b> to the general public, rather than just hardcore fans of the game; for example, some 7-Eleven stores advertised Halo 3 and sold specialty cups and copies of the game.|$|E
5|$|He {{has been}} {{generally}} well-received by video-game critics. Tidus' cheerful personality and heroic traits make him an <b>appealing</b> protagonist, contrasting with previous male {{characters in the}} franchise. His character development and romantic relationship with Yuna are considered {{among the best in}} video games, although reviewers and fans were divided on Taylor's voicing. Tidus has been popular with fans, often ranking {{as one of the best}} Final Fantasy characters in polls. Action figures and Tidus-related jewelry have been produced, and he is a popular cosplay character.|$|E
5|$|He {{was finally}} able {{to gain access to the}} Adriatic by {{capturing}} Lissus and its seemingly impregnable citadel, after which the surrounding territories surrendered. Perhaps the capture of Lissus rekindled in Philip hopes of an Italian invasion. However the loss of his fleet meant that Philip would be dependent on Carthage for passage to and from Italy, making the prospect of invasion considerably less <b>appealing.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1924 Ferens {{attempted}} to intervene on behalf William George Smith, a ship's painter {{who had been}} sentenced to death for murder at York Assizes. A telegram addressed to the King was sent {{in the early hours}} of 9 December <b>appealing</b> for the exercise of the Royal Prerogative. But the appeal was unsuccessful and Smith was executed at Hull Gaol later that morning.|$|E
5|$|In March 1919, Princess Matoika and Rijndam raced {{each other}} from Saint-Nazaire to Newport News in a {{friendly}} competition that received national press coverage in the United States. Rijndam, the slower ship, was just able to edge out the Princess—and cut two days from her previous fastest crossing time—by <b>appealing</b> to {{the honor of the}} soldiers of the 133rd Field Artillery (returning home aboard the former Holland America liner) and employing them as extra stokers for her boilers.|$|E
5|$|In the 2007–2008 school year, McGill offered over 340 {{academic}} programs in eleven faculties. The university also offers over 250 doctoral and master's graduate degree programs. Despite strong increases in university enrollment across North America, McGill has upheld {{a relatively low}} and <b>appealing</b> student-faculty ratio of 16:1. There are nearly 1,600 tenured or tenure-track professors teaching at the university.|$|E
5|$|John James Audubon {{reported}} that the American white ibis was hunted and sold in Louisiana, and mainly eaten by American Indians. It had orange flesh and a strong fishy taste. Elsewhere, the flesh {{has been described as}} <b>appealing</b> on account of the crayfish diet, and both members of the genus Eudocimus have been hunted, which has been responsible for decline, across their range. Crawfish farmers in Louisiana have also shot them for foraging in crawfish ponds. Overall, the impact of hunting is not thought to be major.|$|E
5|$|Many of the locations, characters, {{and events}} in Dynasty Warriors 4 are {{reported}} to have happened in Chinese history although many have been exaggerated to make the game more <b>appealing</b> to the player. There are also some features that are historically inaccurate. The game features environments resembling that of ancient China and various items from the era. Common items throughout the game include Fairy Wine and Dim Sum’s.|$|E
5|$|Massey and Brown {{introduced}} standardization to the fragmented company. After visiting Pete Harman's {{operations in}} Utah, {{they began to}} implement the stand-alone take-out model across the entire chain. Franchisees were ordered to delist their own menu items {{so that they could}} concentrate on KFC products. The restaurants were re-branded with a distinctive red-and-white striped color pattern and mansard roofs with cupolas. The roll-out of freestanding stores accelerated the company's growth as outlets exclusively selling fried chicken proved to be more <b>appealing</b> to potential franchisees.|$|E
5|$|Most of Paine's {{arguments}} {{had long}} been available to the educated elite, but by presenting them in an engaging and irreverent style, he made deism <b>appealing</b> and accessible to a mass audience. Originally distributed as unbound pamphlets, the book was also inexpensive, putting it within the reach {{of a large number}} of buyers. Fearing the spread of what they viewed as potentially revolutionary ideas, the British government prosecuted printers and book-sellers who tried to publish and distribute it. Nevertheless, Paine's work inspired and guided many free thinkers.|$|E
5|$|Muntz {{attempted}} {{to establish a}} modern, trendy image for his players and cartridges. His print advertisements often showed the player installed in an <b>appealing</b> sports car and usually incorporated a young, attractive model with a suggestive tagline. Most of his employees in his California shops were attractive young women dressed in overbright clothing.|$|E
5|$|Raiden's debut role as {{the protagonist}} of Metal Gear Solid 2 was controversial, however, due to his {{unexpected}} substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. Some critics have defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was <b>appealing.</b> Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been highly praised for his role and Metal Gear Solid 4 redesign and even more for his role and design in Revengeance.|$|E
5|$|Sakura is {{voiced by}} Yui Makino in the anime adaptation, and by Monica Rial in the English adaptation. Sakura's {{character}} was Makino's first {{work as a}} voice actress and she states {{she did not have}} to adjust her voice for that, finding the character similar to her. During the series' original video animations (OVAs), Makino mentioned that one of Sakura's scenes was very sad, and worked to make it <b>appealing.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{species of}} crocodilian are traded as exotic pets. They are <b>appealing</b> when young, and pet-store owners can easily sell them, but {{crocodilians}} {{do not make}} good pets; they grow large and are both dangerous and expensive to keep. As they grow older, pet crocodilians are often abandoned by their owners, and feral populations of spectacled caimans exist in the United States and Cuba. Most countries have strict regulations for keeping these reptiles.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the time}} of de Vaux, the default {{assumption}} {{has been that the}} Wicked Priest is a single individual, if only because of the <b>appealing</b> parallelism to the Teacher of Righteousness. The consensus time period for the founding of Qumran (150-140 BCE) includes five High Priests: three Hellenized and two Maccabean: Jason, Menelaus, Alcimus, Jonathan, and Simon, and also the various figures potentially associated with the intersacerdotium.|$|E
