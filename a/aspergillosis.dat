5|$|Fungi create harm by spoiling food, {{destroying}} timber, and by causing {{diseases of}} crops, livestock, and humans. Fungi, mainly moulds like Penicillium and Aspergillus, spoil many stored foods. Fungi cause {{the majority of}} plant diseases, which in turn cause serious economic losses. Sometimes, as in the Great Irish Famine of 1845–1849, fungal diseases of plants, in this case potato blight caused by Phytophthora, result in large-scale human suffering. Fungi are similarly {{the main cause of}} economic losses of timber in buildings. Finally, fungi cause many diseases of humans and livestock; <b>Aspergillosis</b> kills some 600,000 people a year, mainly however those with already weakened immune systems.|$|E
5|$|Pathogenic fungi cause {{a variety}} of {{diseases}} in humans and livestock. <b>Aspergillosis,</b> most commonly caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, kills some 600,000 people per year, mostly those with already weakened immune systems. Pneumocystis causes pneumonia, again mainly in people with weakened immune systems. Candida yeasts are the agents of Candidiasis, causing infections of the mouth, throat, and genital tract, and more seriously of the blood. Ringworm is a skin infection that infects some 20% of the human population; it is caused by some 40 different fungi.|$|E
5|$|Some fungi {{can cause}} serious {{diseases}} in humans, several {{of which may}} be fatal if untreated. These include <b>aspergillosis,</b> candidiasis, coccidioidomycosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, mycetomas, and paracoccidioidomycosis. Furthermore, persons with immuno-deficiencies are particularly susceptible to disease by genera such as Aspergillus, Candida, Cryptoccocus, Histoplasma, and Pneumocystis. Other fungi can attack eyes, nails, hair, and especially skin, the so-called dermatophytic and keratinophilic fungi, and cause local infections such as ringworm and athlete's foot. Fungal spores are also a cause of allergies, and fungi from different taxonomic groups can evoke allergic reactions.|$|E

25|$|Whilst the {{benefits}} of using corticosteroids {{in the short term}} are notable, and improve quality of life scores, there are cases of ABPA converting to invasive <b>aspergillosis</b> whilst undergoing corticosteroid treatment. Furthermore, in concurrent use with itraconazole, there is potential for drug interaction and the induction of Cushing syndrome in rare instances. Metabolic disorders, such as diabetes mellitus and osteoporosis, can also be induced.|$|E
25|$|Allergic bronchopulmonary <b>aspergillosis</b> (ABPA) is a {{condition}} characterised by an exaggerated response {{of the immune system}} (a hypersensitivity response) to the fungus Aspergillus (most commonly Aspergillus fumigatus). It occurs most often in patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis. Aspergillus spores are ubiquitous in soil and are commonly found in the sputum of healthy individuals. A. fumigatus is responsible for a spectrum of lung diseases known as aspergilloses.|$|E
25|$|The fungi Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus parasiticus, Aspergillus tamarii, Aspergillus sulphureus, Aspergillus repens, Mucor hiemalis (not a human pathogen), Penicillium chrysogenum, Penicillium italicum and Rhizopus nigrans {{have been}} found in moldy cannabis. Aspergillus mold species can infect the lungs via smoking or {{handling}} of infected cannabis and cause opportunistic and sometimes deadly <b>aspergillosis.</b> Some of the microorganisms found create aflatoxins, which are toxic and carcinogenic. Researchers suggest that moldy cannabis should thus be discarded to avoid these serious risks.|$|E
25|$|IgG {{antibody}} precipitin testing from serum is useful, {{as positive}} results {{are found in}} between 69–90% of patients, though also in 10% of asthmatics with and without SAFS. Therefore, it must be {{used in conjunction with}} other tests. Various forms exist, including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and fluorescent enzyme immunoassay (FEIA). Both are more sensitive than conventional counterimmunoelectrophoresis. IgG may not be entirely specific for ABPA, as high levels are also found in chronic pulmonary <b>aspergillosis</b> (CPA) alongside more severe radiological findings.|$|E
25|$|In later stages, {{changes in}} the {{architecture}} of the lung, such as pathology in the major airways (bronchiectasis), further exacerbate difficulties in breathing. Other signs include coughing up blood (hemoptysis), high blood pressure in the lung (pulmonary hypertension), heart failure, difficulties getting enough oxygen to the body (hypoxia), and respiratory failure requiring support with breathing masks, such as bilevel positive airway pressure machines or ventilators. Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the three most common organisms causing lung infections in CF patients. In addition to typical bacterial infections, people with CF more commonly develop other types of lung disease. Among these is allergic bronchopulmonary <b>aspergillosis,</b> in which the body's response to the common fungus Aspergillus fumigatus causes worsening of breathing problems. Another is infection with Mycobacterium avium complex, a group of bacteria related to tuberculosis, which can cause lung damage and does not respond to common antibiotics.|$|E
25|$|Stonebrood (<b>Aspergillosis</b> larvae apium) is a {{fungal disease}} caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, and Aspergillus niger. It causes mummification of the brood of a honey bee colony. The fungi are common soil {{inhabitants}} {{and are also}} pathogenic to other insects, birds, and mammals. The disease is difficult to identify {{in the early stages}} of infection. The spores of the different species have different colours and can also cause respiratory damage to humans and other animals. When bee larvae take in spores, they may hatch in the gut, growing rapidly to form a collar-like ring near the larval heads. After death, the larvae turn black and become difficult to crush, hence the name stonebrood. Eventually, the fungus erupts from the integument of the larvae and forms a false skin. In this stage, the larvae are covered with powdery fungal spores. Worker bees clean out the infected brood and the hive may recover depending on factors such as the strength of the colony, the level of infection, and hygienic habits of the strain of bees (variation in the trait occurs among different subspecies/races).|$|E
25|$|From a {{young age}} on his family estate in Sterrebeek, Derscheid {{developed}} an interest in ornithology and aviculture. He built a research station for bird behavior called Armendy Farm that {{was active in the}} 1930s. In cooperation with colleagues in France, England, Germany, the United States and Australia he succeeded in assembling one of the best captive breeding bird collections in Europe, specializing in Anatidae and Loriinae (ducks, swans, geese; and the group of small parrots consisting of lories and lorikeets). Derscheid also kept the omnivorous alpine parrots from New Zealand known as keas. There, he researched dietary requirements and incubation, sending specimens to zoos throughout Europe, America, and Australia. He was particularly interested in <b>aspergillosis,</b> a bronchial disease caused by mold that decimated flocks of wild sea ducks as he tried to acclimatize them to the freshwater park environment, but which Derscheid succeeded in curing. Derscheid's techniques were widely adopted and applied, most notably at the nature reserve in Zwin (Belgium), known for its collections of salt-resistant plants and an aviary specializing in wading birds. An obituary of Derscheid states: “His collection at Sterrebeek was known throughout Europe, America and Australasia, and his success with the Anatidae, particularly with the sea-duck, placed him in the forefront of waterfowl experts.” Prior to the outbreak of World War II, Derscheid transferred some of his collection of exotic birds to the late John J. Yealland, who carried them in a cardboard box on one of the last boats to leave Belgium before the German invasion. Later the Curator of Birds at the London Zoo, Yealland also published on Derscheid's bird collections from notes prepared during the latter's imprisonment.|$|E

2500|$|CF {{patients}} {{may also have}} their airways chronically colonized by filamentous fungi (such as Aspergillus fumigatus, Scedosporium apiospermum, Aspergillus terreus) and/or yeasts (such as Candida albicans); other filamentous fungi less commonly isolated include Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus nidulans (occur transiently in CF respiratory secretions) and Exophiala dermatitidis and Scedosporium prolificans (chronic airway-colonizers); some filamentous fungi such as Penicillium emersonii and Acrophialophora fusispora are encountered in patients almost exclusively {{in the context of}} CF. Defective mucociliary clearance characterizing CF is associated with local immunological disorders. In addition, the prolonged therapy with antibiotics and the use of corticosteroid treatments may also facilitate fungal growth. Although the clinical relevance of the fungal airway colonization is still a matter of debate, filamentous fungi may contribute to the local inflammatory response and therefore to the progressive deterioration of the lung function, as often happens with allergic bronchopulmonary <b>aspergillosis</b> [...] – the most common fungal disease in the context of CF, involving a Th2-driven immune response to Aspergillus species.|$|E

In cases of reported non-invasive <b>aspergillosis</b> caused by A. alabamensis, isolates are usually recovered from sputum, tracheal aspirates, ear canal, burn wounds or the cystic fibrosis lung. Immunocompromised individuals are more susceptible than immunocompetent people to <b>aspergillosis.</b>|$|E

50|$|Immunosuppressed {{individuals}} (such as {{organ transplant}} recipients and HIV patients) are may be susceptible to infection by A. candidus. Invasive <b>aspergillosis</b> {{may be caused}} by A. candidus in humans, particularly in immunocompromised individuals, with high associated mortality. Diagnosis of invasive <b>aspergillosis</b> is difficult due to the non-specific clinical measures and symptoms. Some symptoms include fever, cough, and dyspnea (difficulty breathing). Radiologic examination may reveal an alveolar hemorrhage with the appearance of a nodule. Serum tests may show positive results for galactomannan and beta-D-glucan which are both the cell wall materials for A. candidus. Although these may provide strong evidence for invasive <b>aspergillosis,</b> false positive results are also common because many other fungal pathogens also show similar symptoms test results. If the invasive <b>aspergillosis</b> is kept untreated, the disease can spread from the lungs to any of the organs in the body. Dissemination to the central nervous system is especially fatal, resulting in seizure or stroke. Intravenous oral therapy by voriconazole has been used successfully in the treatment of invasive <b>aspergillosis.</b> Although voriconazole is most recommended, amphotericin B deoxycholate is a suitable alternative alternative option for patients intolerant of voriconazole.|$|E
