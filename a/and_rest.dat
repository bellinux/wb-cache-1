40|$|The conidia <b>and</b> <b>resting</b> hyphae of the {{northern}} anthracnose pathogen of Trifolium species, Kabatiella caulivora, were effectively carried by, and maintained long-term viability on, a range of materials, including metals, fabrics, woods and plastics. Conidia and hyphae became thick-walled and melanized with time. There were significant (P < 0. 001) differences in conidia/resting hyphae survival between carrier materials and between temperature regimes. At 23 °C/ 8 °C day/night, conidia <b>and</b> <b>resting</b> hyphae remained viable on steel, corrugated iron, galvanized steel, all tested fabrics, wood and random mixed materials for up to 8 months. At 36 °C/ 14 °C day/night, conidia <b>and</b> <b>resting</b> hyphae remained viable for up to 8 months, but only on cotton, denim, fleece, silk, leather, paper, plastic and all wood materials. At 45 °C/ 15 °C day/night, conidia <b>and</b> <b>resting</b> hyphae remained viable up to 8 months only on fleece wool, Eucalyptus marginata (jarrah wood) and paper. There were significant differences between carrier materials in their abilities to retain conidia <b>and</b> <b>resting</b> hyphae after washing (P < 0. 001). Metabolic activity was confirmed for conidia <b>and</b> <b>resting</b> hyphae recovered after 8 months and K. caulivora colonies successfully re-established on potato dextrose agar. Findings confirmed the critical importance of materials as long-term carriers of viable K. caulivora conidia <b>and</b> <b>resting</b> hyphae, highlighting the potential for spread of a highly virulent K. caulivora race within and outside Australia via farming equipment, clothing and other associated materials. Results also have wider biosecurity implications for the transportation of fungal-infested carrier materials previously considered as low risk...|$|R

5|$|The 10th Battalion {{was back}} in action on 22–23 August as the Allied advance {{continued}} north of Proyart. The 10th Battalion was in a supporting role protecting the flank of the 1st Brigade. Wilder-Neligan visited the neighbouring battalion, and upon learning of some difficulties due to German positions in a wood, immediately deployed two companies to clear the area, and due to his initiative the advance was able to continue. The 10th Battalion continued in the advance towards the Hindenburg outpost line {{over the next few}} days before being relieved for a short period of training <b>and</b> <b>rest.</b> On 18 September, the battalion saw its last fighting of the war during the capture of the Hindenburg outpost line south of the village of Villeret. In heavy fighting, the unit captured the second and third objectives, and were then relieved and went into a period of training <b>and</b> <b>rest.</b> By this point, the battalion had been reduced to a strength of 517 men. On 10 October, Wilder-Neligan was awarded the French Croix de guerre. He was mentioned in despatches for the fifth and final time on 8 November. After the Armistice of 11 November, Wilder-Neligan remained with his battalion until 1 January 1919. He returned to Australia in July, arriving in Brisbane in September. For his service during the war, in addition to the decorations already mentioned, Wilder-Neligan was awarded the 1914–15 Star, British War Medal and Victory Medal.|$|E

5|$|The {{northeast}} monsoon, {{which begins}} in September, lasts through the post-monsoon seasons, and only ends in March.

However, the large indentation made by the Bay of Bengal into India's eastern coast means that the flows are humidified before reaching Cape Comorin <b>and</b> <b>rest</b> of Tamil Nadu, meaning that the state, and also some parts of Kerala, experience significant precipitation in the post-monsoon and winter periods. However, parts of West Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Mumbai also receive minor precipitation from the north-east monsoon.|$|E
