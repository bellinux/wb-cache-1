50|$|An English {{translation}} by John E. Woods {{was published}} in 1997. The book received the 1996 <b>Aristeion</b> <b>Prize.</b>|$|E

50|$|More {{than two}} million copies of Saramago's books have been sold in Portugal alone and his work has been {{translated}} into 25 languages. A proponent of libertarian communism, Saramago criticized {{institutions such as the}} Catholic Church, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. An atheist, he defended love as an instrument to improve the human condition. In 1992, the Government of Portugal under Prime Minister Aníbal Cavaco Silva ordered the removal of The Gospel According to Jesus Christ from the <b>Aristeion</b> <b>Prize's</b> shortlist, claiming the work was religiously offensive. Disheartened by this political censorship of his work, Saramago went into exile on the Spanish island of Lanzarote, upon which he resided until his death in 2010.|$|R

50|$|Saramago {{joined the}} Portuguese Communist Party in 1969 and {{remained}} a member {{until the end}} of his life. He was a self-confessed pessimist. His views aroused considerable controversy in Portugal, especially after the publication of The Gospel According to Jesus Christ. Members of the country's Catholic community were outraged by Saramago's representation of Jesus and particularly God as fallible, even cruel human beings. Portugal's conservative government, led by then-prime minister Cavaco Silva, did not allow Saramago's work to compete for the <b>Aristeion</b> <b>Prize,</b> arguing that it offended the Catholic community. As a result, Saramago and his wife moved to Lanzarote, an island in the Canaries.|$|E

I've just about had it up to here!" ...|$|E

50|$|Miguel has {{announced}} the film {{adaptation of the}} controversial but worldwide acclaimed book by José Saramago, The Gospel According to Jesus Christ, which will follow The Meaning of Life. Upon its release in 1991, seventeen years {{after the fall of}} the Estado Novo dictatorship, the book was vetoed from a list of books running for the <b>Aristeion</b> <b>Prize</b> by the Portuguese Government, considering it an attack on Christian values. Saramago would respond by leaving the country forever. He won the Nobel Prize in 1998. The book satirizes the life and death of Jesus Christ by rejecting to portray the characters solely based on the canonical gospels, depicting them as regular people, with the conflicting emotions of genuine human beings. It follows the chronology of the life of Jesus as depicted in the New Testament but focuses on life's little details and imperfections.|$|E
5000|$|Saramago's {{funeral was}} held in Lisbon on 20 June 2010, in the {{presence}} of more than 20,000 people, many of whom had travelled hundreds of kilometres, but also notably in the absence of right-wing President of Portugal Aníbal Cavaco Silva was holidaying in the Azores as the ceremony took place. Cavaco Silva, the Prime Minister who removed Saramago's work from the shortlist of the <b>Aristeion</b> <b>Prize,</b> said he did not attend Saramago's funeral because he [...] "had never had the privilege to know him". Mourners, who questioned Cavaco Silva's absence {{in the presence of}} reporters, held copies of the red carnation, symbolic of Portugal's democratic revolution. Saramago's cremation took place in Lisbon, and his ashes were buried on the anniversary of his death, 18 June 2011, underneath a hundred year old olive tree on the square in front of the José Saramago Foundation (Casa dos Bicos).|$|E
