40|$|Central to curing gout is the {{reduction}} of serum uric acid. This {{can be achieved by}} use of a urate-lowering therapy (ULT), such as allopurinol. ULT, when tolerated and adhered to, has been shown to resolve gout in most cases. The duration of this process varies from 3 to 30 months and depends on a number of factors, the most prominent of which is serum uric acid concentration. Purine-rich foods such as meat and seafood, as well as alcohol and fructose, can raise uric acid levels directly or indirectly. Vitamin C, coffee, and low-fat dairy have been shown to lower serum uric <b>acid,</b> while <b>cherries</b> may help to prevent inflammatory gout episodes. While individual dietary modifications have been shown to produce only modest reductions in serum urate, multiple small adjustments may, in the aggregate, significantly lower uric acid levels. The power of diet to resolve gout notwithstanding, dietary factors are strongly implicated in the onset and progression of gout. Periodic consumption of large amounts of purine-rich foods and alcohol can produce transient spikes in serum uric acid capable of triggering gouty attacks, especially when combined with fasting. In addition to the acute rise in urate associated with meat, seafood, alcohol, and fructose intake, habitual consumption of these foods can raise serum uric acid over the long term, impeding gout resolution. Lifestyle and dietary changes that lower serum urate, such as maintaining moderate levels of meat, seafood, alcohol, and fructose consumption, as well as supplementing the diet with coffee, low-fat dairy, and Vitamin C, may hasten resolution...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} {{bacterial}} natural products offers important {{insights into the}} physiologies and behaviors of individual species of bacteria {{as well as the}} contributions of these organisms to complex microbial communities. Such information frequently has important downstream applications in medicine, industry, agriculture, biotechnology, basic sciences and applied microbiology. The majority of bacteria found in nature cannot be cultivated in a laboratory setting, however, leaving a wealth of genetic and chemical diversity unexplored by traditional microbiological methods. Culture-independent approaches for studying diverse microbial populations affords indirect access to these resources. Within the wide array of culture-independent approaches currently in use (collectively termed â€œmetagenomicsâ€), the strategies of functional metagenomics provide access to important functions, phenotypes and activities encoded on fragments of environmental DNA (eDNA) as evidenced by the expression of these traits in model cultured bacterial hosts. Functional metagenomic techniques can be tailored towards finding metagenome-derived small molecule biosynthetic capabilities, thereby allowing access to novel metabolites encoded within the genomes of uncultured bacteria. From a practical standpoint, however, eDNA-derived biosynthetic gene clusters may frequently go undetected in many functional metagenomic screens due to the inherent expressions limitations associated with individual heterologous hosts. One way to circumvent these limitations is to develop novel technologies that allow for cloned eDNA to be screened {{in a wide variety of}} bacterial hosts, each possessing its own unique expression capabilites. I begin this thesis by describing the development of a novel cloning system that permits the functional metagenomic screening of eDNA libraries hosted by multiple Gram-negative bacterial species, along with the application of this technology to natural product discovery through the targeting of clones that express small molecule associated phenotypes (Craig, Chang et al. 2009). The results of these screens support the hypothesis that phylogenetically diverse host species differ in their abilities to heterologously express foreign genes and gene clusters (Craig, Chang et al. 2010). Important genes and secondary metabolites associated with individual eDNA clones identified in these screens are also described in detail (Craig and Brady 2011). I conclude this thesis with a bioinformatic and functional analysis of eDNA clones that encode for the biosynthesis of N-acyl amino <b>acids</b> (Craig, <b>Cherry</b> et al. 2011). This analysis indicates that N-acyl amino acid synthase enzymes are found predominantly within bacterial species that harbor the putative PEP-CTERM/exosortase protein-sorting system...|$|R
40|$|Matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (GELB) as {{a member}} of gelatinases plays key role in the {{destruction}} of blood-brain barrier (BBB), T cells migration into the CNS, and demyelination induction. Considering remyelination induction in response to tart cherry extract and pure p-coumaric acid ingestion via tracking MMP 9 gene expression in the cuprizone mouse model. Firstly, predicting the chemical interaction between p-coumaric acid and MMP 9 protein was conducted through PASS and Swiss dock web services. Next, the content of p-coumaric acid in the tart cherry extract was analyzed by HPLC. Later, mice (male, female) were categorized into two groups: standard, cuprizone. After the demyelination period, mice classified into four groups: standard, natural chow, tart <b>cherry</b> extract, p-coumaric <b>acid.</b> Finally, brains were extracted from the skull, and MMP 9 gene expression was evaluated by real time RT-PCR. Bioinformatics analysis displayed p-coumaric acid has potent inhibitory effect on MMP 9 gene expression (Pa= 0. 818) with estimated ΔG (kcal/mol) - 8. 10. In addition, during the demyelination period, MMP 9 expression was increased significantly in the male group that is related to myelin destruction. However, MMP 9 was declined throughout remyelination in both male and female. It’s remarkable that pure p-coumaric <b>acid</b> and tart <b>cherry</b> extract ingestion could decrease the gene expression ratio more than natural chow. According to the results, it’s deduced the male mouse is more appropriate gender for demyelination induction via cuprizone. In addition, tart cherry extract and pure p-coumaric acid ingestion could decrease MMP 9 gene expression level considerably during remyelination. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cherry {{has often}} been used by people as a {{traditional}} medicine. A benefit of cherry is to reduce uric acid level. Liver is a central organ that acts to metabolize foreign substances which enter the body, so the toxic effects of medication usually show in the liver, especially the changes of histopathological images of liver. Aim: To prove the differences of histopathologic images of hyperurisemic Balb/c mice’s liver between the groups of mice given cherry extract with graded dosages and the control groups of mice and the differences between pre test uric acid level and post test uric acid level. Methods: This was a true-experimental research study using the pre test and post test control group design. 30 Balb/c mice were divided into 6 groups randomly. The control 1 which was given only standard food, control 2 was given high purine diet, control 3 was given cherry extract, and treated groups (P 1, P 2, P 3) which were given cherry extract in graded dosage: 14 mg/ 20 grBW, 28 mg/ 20 grBW, and 56 mg/ 20 grBW for 30 days. On day 31, the uric acid level were measured, then the mice were terminated. The liver were sliced and stained using HE stain. The liver of Balb/c mice were examined under microscope in five viewing fields the were compared between the control groups and treatment groups. Results: One Way ANOVA test for histopathological images of degeneration liver showed insignificant differences (p> 0, 05) for every group. Wilcoxon test for uric acid level showed significant differences (p< 0, 05) for every group. Conclusion: There were not significant difference between cherry extract with graded dosages to histopathological images of hyperuricemia Balb/c mice’s liver.
