40|$|AbstractAlthough popular, the {{pressurized}} {{metered dose inhaler}} generates coarse, {{fast moving}} clouds so that the fraction reaching the lung is small. These shortcomings can be redressed by Modulite® which permutes the following variables: the non-volatile components of a solution formula, the <b>actuator</b> <b>orifice</b> geometry, {{the volume of the}} metered solution and the vapour pressure of the propel lants. This permits the design of aerosols with chosen particle size and plume speed. This facilitates co-ordination of dose generation with inspiration, reduces oropharyngeal deposition and provides a mechanism for targeting drug delivery to different parts of the Iung. These principles are exemplified by designing an HFA-propelled beclometasone dipropionate product which closely matches existing products which use chlorofluorocarbons...|$|E
40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} steering {{forces and}} moments on an axisymmetric bluff body {{are controlled by}} exploiting induced asymmetric, segmented attachment of the base flow to a Coanda surface on a circular tail end. Control is effected by an array of four individually-addressable, aft-facing synthetic jet actuators that emanate from azimuthally-segmented slots, equally distributed {{around the perimeter of}} the tail. The model is suspended in the wind tunnel by eight thin wires each instrumented with a miniature strain gage sensor for direct dynamic force measurements with minimal support interference with the wake. The aerodynamic effects associated with quasi-steady and transitory asymmetric activation of the Coanda effect are characterized using force and hot wire measurements. Transitory modulation of the actuation waveform of multiple actuators leads to the generation of significant dynamic side forces of controlled magnitude and direction with potential utility for flight stabilization and fast maneuvering.

40|$|AbstractAlthough {{dry powder}} inhalers are well {{established}} for the delivery of corticosteroids, the pressurised metered dose inhaler remains the preferred and most cost effective presentation. To design an HFA solution formulation which matched marketed CFC products (Pulmicort® and Desonac® DA) two elements of the Chiesi Modulite® system, {{the addition of a}} non-volatile component and the <b>actuator</b> <b>orifice</b> diameter, were varied. These variables, which were shown by in vitro tests to influence the fine particle dose and its mean particle size in different ways, could be permuted to give an aerosol cloud with size characteristics very close to the comparator products. The likelihood that this would confer clinical equivalence is reinforced by a pharmacokinetic analysis which showed that the chosen HFA solution formula gave similar systemic absorption from the lung as Pulmicort®. The equivalence in aerosol characteristics was sustained when the pressurised metered dose inhalers (pMDIs) were used with spacers. The Chiesi Jet® and the AstraZeneca Nebuhaler®, when used with their respective pMDIs, reduced likely oropharyngeal deposition to the same extent and gave a similar increase in the fine particle dose...|$|E

Synthetic jet actuators (SJAs) may be carefully designed to alleviate {{the negative impact of}} impinging flow non low non-uniformities on the aircraft wing performance. The current work investigates the effectiveness of SJAs for control a low low-speed airfoil unsteady aerodynamic response and acoustic radiation both for the clean upstream flow conditions and in the presence of an upstream flow disturbance. In the high fidelity numerical studies of flow and noise control of, respectively, SD 7003 and Joukowski airfoils in laminar and transitional flow regimes, the actuator is modeled without its resonator cavity by imposing a simple fluctuating-velocity boundary condition {{at the bottom of the}} <b>actuator's</b> <b>orifice.</b> The orifice with of the <b>actuator's</b> <b>orifice.</b> The orifice with properly defined boundary condition is then embedded into airfoil surface for conducting high-accuracy viscous analysis of SJA-based active based active flow and noise control.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 10 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Florida, 14 - 16 July 2014. This work proposes to investigate a significant advantage of synthetic jets: synthetic jets can be employed successfully to increase heat/mass transfer. The present study is experimental and deals with an investigation into heat transfer from a hot-film probe firmly connected to a wall on which the synthetic jet impinges perpendicularly. All measurements were performed in air by means of thermo-anemometry. The experimental setup consisted of a SJ <b>actuator</b> (emitting <b>orifice</b> diameter, 10 mm), an aluminum flat plate (with dimensions of 120 × 120 mm), and a heated hot-film probe placed on the wall. dc 201...|$|R

All three components are batch microfabricated using silicon substrates. This microvalve is designed for an actuation mechanism for a pneumatically controlled, biologically inspired six-legged microrobot. We have used a TiNi SMA thin film as an actuator since {{it is capable of}} both high strains (3 %) and high forces (work density of 5 x lo 7 Urn”).

40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{forces and}} moments on a {{wind tunnel model}} of an axisymmetric bluff body are altered by induced local attachment of the separated base flow. Control is effected by an array of four integrated aft-facing synthetic jet actuators that emanate from narrow, azimuthally-segmented slots, equally distributed {{around the perimeter of}} the circular tail end within a small backward facing step that extends into a Coanda surface. The model is suspended in the wind tunnel by eight thin wires for minimal support interference with the wake. Fluidic actuation results in a localized, segmented vectoring of the separated base flow along the rear Coanda surface and induces asymmetric aerodynamic forces and moments to effect steering during flight. The aerodynamic effects associated with quasi-steady and transitory differential, asymmetric activation of the Coanda effect are characterized using direct force and PIV measurements.

40|$|An {{analytical}} model {{based on the}} laws of fluid dynamics for synthetic jet actuation into quiescent air as well as into external flow fields is presented. A synthetic jet actuator consists of a cavity with a driven wall and an orifice. Under actuation, the wall is oscillated resulting in an oscillatory flow through the orifice. In the model, the driven wall is modelled as a single degree of freedom mechanical system, which is pneumatically coupled to the cavity-orifice arrangement acting as a Helmholtz resonator. The latter has been modelled using the unsteady form of the continuity and Bernoulli equations with a loss term. External flow field effects are represented by fluctuating external pressure at the <b>actuator</b> <b>orifice.</b> The model has been validated against experimental data available in the published literature, and excellent agreement is obtained between the predicted and measured frequency responses {{as well as the}} phase relationships between velocities and pressures. The model and analysis based on it provides valuable insights into the behaviour of synthetic jet actuators, and reveals amongst other things, that air in the actuator cavity exhibits compressibility at all frequencies beyond the Helmholtz resonance frequency. Furthermore, the actuator output velocity is maximised when cavity Helmholtz and wall natural frequencies are brought together. The presence of an external flow field could either aid or hinder actuation depending on the phase relationship between, and the relative frequencies of, the wall forcing and external pressure fluctuations...|$|E
40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. Various {{hypotheses}} {{have been introduced}} to explain disintegration of the continuous liquid phase into individual droplets leading to spray formation in pressurised metered dose inhalers (pMDIs). In a practicable system, the liquid formulation to be discharged from the pressurised container needs to be nucleated to ensure spray generation. Nucleation {{can be described as}} the generation of a nucleus of the vapour phase within the bulk liquid. As a stable nucleus is formed, it grows significantly and then detaches from its nucleation site to move upwards in the liquid phase. In our research, the effects of various parameters on the nucleation of HFA 227 was analysed with the aim of gaining a better understanding of bubble formation and the nucleation process in HFA propellants, including the surface geometrical properties, <b>actuator</b> <b>orifice</b> size and the mass flow rate through the orifice. Other important factors influencing the nucleation process that were considered comprised the viscosity and surface tension of the formulation, thermodynamic state variables including temperature, pressure and degree of superheat. The results highlighted the effect of surface imperfections on the rate of nucleation and bubble growth. A comparison of two different orifice sizes was made and a significant change in the shape and motion of the bubbles was observed. An intense nucleation was also observed at higher mass flow rate of HFA 227 through the valve. It is anticipated that recognising the factors affecting nucleation and bubble growth of HFA 227 may lead to potential routes of influencing the medical aerosol generation mechanism inside the pMDI and control the fine particle size distribution...|$|E
40|$|In a first {{preferred}} embodiment for an improved synthetic jet <b>actuator,</b> the <b>orifice</b> shape is altered by either a flap or adjusting the housing walls. If the flap is deployed {{outward from the}} wall just above the orifice of a synthetic jet actuator, the synthetic jet flow will be vectored upward, toward the flap. Similarly, if the upper wall forming the orifice is moved outward from the jet chamber interior with respect to an opposing wall forming the orifice, the flow will also vector upward. In the second {{preferred embodiment}} of an improved synthetic jet actuator, an opening {{in addition to the}} orifice, may be formed in one or more walls of the housing. A louver is aligned with the opening in the housing and permits fluid flow in only one direction, either into the chamber or out of the chamber. When the louver permits fluid flow into the chamber, the jet actuator can operate at high speeds since fluid can enter the chamber through a greater surface area. Another preferred embodiment for an improved synthetic jet actuator comprises two concentric tubular sections normal to an outside surface of a solid body). In operation, the innermost section is connected to a vacuum device and constantly pulls fluid down its length from the ambient fluid above the outer surface. Meanwhile, the outer section ejects fluid into the ambient environment by pulses. Such an operation will cause a synthetic fluid jet to form above the constant suction synthetic jet actuator.

40|$|This work details an {{experimental}} investigation {{aimed at reducing}} the noise output of piezoelectrical-driven synthetic jet actuators while minimising peak jet velocity reduction. The study considers double-chamber actuator for anti-phase noise suppression and lobed orifice as a method to enhance jet turbulent mixing to suppress jet noise. The study involved the design, manufacture and bench test of interchangeable actuator hardware. Hot-wire anemometry and microphone recordings were employed to acquire velocity and sound pressure level measurements respectively {{across a range of}} excitation frequencies for a fixed diaphragm clamping and input voltage. The data analysis indicated a 26 % noise reduction (16 dB) from operating a single-chamber, round <b>orifice</b> <b>actuator</b> to a double-chamber, lobed orifice one at the synthetic jet resonant frequency. Results also showed there was a small reduction in peak jet velocity of 7 % (∼ 3 m/s) between these two cases based on orifices of the same discharge area. The electrical-to-fluidic power conversion efficiency of the double-chamber actuator was found to be 15 % for both orifice types at the resonant frequency; approximately double the efficiency of a single-chamber actuator...|$|R
40|$|Wind tunnel {{experiments}} were performed using active flow control on an unswept semispan wing {{model with a}} 30 % chord trailing edge flap {{to aid in the}} selection of actuators for a planned high Reynolds number experiment. Two sweeping jet actuator sizes were investigated to determine the influence of actuator size on the active flow control system efficiency. Sweeping jet <b>actuators</b> with <b>orifice</b> sizes of 1 mm x 2 mm and 2 mm x 4 mm were selected because of the differences in actuator jet sweep angle. The parameters that were varied include actuator momentum, freestream velocity, and trailing edge flap deflection angle. Steady and unsteady pressure data, Particle Image Velocimetry data, and force and moment data were acquired to assess the performance of the two actuators. In addition to the wind tunnel experiments, benchtop studies of the actuators were performed to characterize the jets produced by each actuator. Benchtop investigations of the smaller actuator reveal that the jet exiting the actuator has a reduced sweep angle compared to published data for larger versions of this type of actuator. The larger actuator produces an oscillating jet that attaches to the external diuser walls at low supply pressures and produces the expected sweep angles. The AFC results using the smaller actuators show that while the actuators can control flow separation, the selected spacing of 3. 3 cm may be too large due to the reduced sweep angle. In comparison, the spacing for the larger actuators, 6. 6 cm, appears to be optimal for the Mach numbers investigated. Particle Image Velocimetry results are presented and show how the wall jets produced by the actuators cause the flow to attach to the flap surface...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of streamwise vorticity concentration by exploiting {{the interaction of}} surface-mounted passive and active flow control elements with the cross flow is investigated experimentally in a small-scale wind tunnel at high subsonic speeds (up to M = 0. 5). Controlled {{formation of}} streamwise vortices can be {{a key element in}} the mitigation of the adverse effects of secondary flows in embedded propulsion system with complex inlet geometries that can affect pressure recovery and distortion at the engine inlet face. The evolution of these vortices is investigated on a converging-diverging insert along one of the test section walls that is designed to provide an adverse pressure gradient that mimics the pressure gradient within a typical offset diffuser. Counter-rotating vortex pairs and single-sense vortices are formed and characterized using conventional passive micro-ramps and micro-vanes, respectively. It is demonstrated that similar streamwise vortices can also be realized using synthetic jet <b>actuators</b> having rectangular <b>orifices</b> that are slanted or skewed to produce single-sense vortices, or streamwise aligned to produce vortex pairs. Hybrid actuation is demonstrated by combining the passive and active actuation approaches to yield a “fail-safe ” device with significant degree of controllability. I...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} method for modeling the complex, multi-physics, multi-dimensional processes associated with a plasma-based flow control actuator, {{also known as the}} SparkJet, by using a one-dimensional analytical model derived from the Euler and thermodynamic equations, under varying assumptions. This model is compared to CFD simulations and experimental data to verify and/or modify the model where simplifying assumptions poorly represent the real actuator. The model was exercised to explore high-frequency actuation and methods of improving actuator performance. Using peak jet momentum as a performance metric, the model shows that a typical SparkJet design (1 mm orifice diameter, 84. 8 mm 3 cavity volume, and 0. 5 J energy input) operated over a range of frequencies from 1 Hz to 10 kHz shows a decrease in peak momentum corresponding to an actuation cutoff frequency of 800 Hz. The model results show that the cutoff frequency is primarily a function of orifice diameter and cavity volume. To further verify model accuracy, experimental testing was performed involving time-dependent, cavity pressure and arc power measurements as a function of orifice diameter, cavity volume, input energy, and electrode gap. The cavity pressure measurements showed that pressure-based efficiency ranges from 20 % to 40 %. The arc power measurements exposed the deficiency in assuming instantaneous energy deposition and a calorically perfect gas and also showed that arc efficiency was approximately 80 %. Additional comparisons between the pressure-based modeling and experimental results show that the model captures the <b>actuator</b> dependence on <b>orifice</b> diameter, cavity volume, and input energy but over-estimates the duration of the jet flow during Stage 2. The likely cause of the disagreement is an inaccurate representation of thermal heat transfer related to convective heat transfer or heat loss to the electrodes...|$|R
