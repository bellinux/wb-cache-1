Models of self-organised travelling groups have shown that this shape may arise as a side effect of the <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> <b>collisions</b> with group members. These models were developed for schools of fish in open water, whereas the oblong shape of schools of real fish has mostly been observed in schools in tanks. Therefore, it is not known how school shape in a tank originates neither in models nor in real fish.

We test the predictions produced by our earlier models regarding the effect of school size on the school shape both in a model of self-organised schooling in a tank and empirically. Empirically, we study the 3 D positions of all individuals in the schools of 10 - 60 real mullets (Chelon labrosus).

40|$|Abstract – Energy {{conservation}} {{is a major}} issue in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). In order to obtain energy conservation, Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) has been discussed as one of the potential solution. Many researchers proposed TDMA as a Media Access Control (MAC) in order to conserve energy. The main advantage to using TDMA MAC is <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> <b>collision</b> <b>of</b> data packets during transmission and the added facility to use sleep modes. The use of sleep mode enables switching off the radio antennas thus reducing the energy conservation. Prior to usage of TDMA MAC, scheduling of the sensor nodes, i. e. providing time slot to the sensor nodes must be performed. Efficient scheduling of transmitting time slot in a TDMA is important for low power WSN. In this work, two decentralized scheduling algorithms Distributed Randomized TDMA (DRAND) and Deterministic Distributed TDMA (DDTDMA) are compared. In these algorithms, flowing the messages among the sensor nodes the scheduling is performed by assigning transmitting time slot to each node. So, their efficiency is analyzed based on schedule length, message complexity and convergence time to obtain scheduling. It was found that DDTDMA is an efficient algorithm than DRAND in terms of schedule length, message complexity and convergence time...|$|R

40|$|Path {{planning}} {{is a useful}} technique for visual servoing as it allows one {{to take into account}} system constraints and achieve desired performances during the camera motion. In this paper, we propose a new framework for path planning based on the use of homogeneous forms and linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Specifically, we introduce a general parametrization of the trajectories from the initial to the desired location based on homogeneous forms and a parameter-dependent version of the Rodrigues formula. This allows us to impose typical constraints (field of view, workspace, joint, <b>avoidance</b> <b>of</b> <b>collision,</b> and occlusion) via positivity conditions on suitable homogeneous forms. Then, we reformulate the problem of finding a trajectory in the 3 -D space satisfying all these constraints as an LMI optimization that can handle the maximization of typical performances (e. g., visibility margin, similarity to a straight line). The planned camera path is tracked by using an image-based controller.

In a large system with many robots, it is difficult for all robots to exchange information at a time because of their limited communication capacities.

Therefore, efficient and reliable communication together with non-explicit communication is crucial for a multi-robot system. This paper presents a hybrid communication approach for a multi-robot system, which combines the explicit with implicit communications via using the prediction of robotic behaviour and a fuzzy communication approach. The hybrid communication approach contains a robot performance rule base, a fuzzy inference engine, and a semantics and grammar for communicating.
