25|$|In 1392, Robert III {{strengthened}} {{the position of}} his son David, now Earl of Carrick, when he endowed him with a large annuity that allowed the young prince to build up his household and affinity, and then in 1393 regained his right to direct rule when the general council decided that Fife's lieutenancy should end, and that Carrick, now of age, should assist his father. This independence of action was demonstrated in 1395–6, when he responded to Carrick's unauthorised marriage to Elizabeth Dunbar, daughter of George, Earl of March, by ensuring its annulment. The king appears to have also taken over the conduct of foreign affairs, preserving the peace with Richard II and managing to increase {{the power of the}} Red Douglas Earl of Angus in the southeast of the country as a counterbalance to Fife's Black Douglas ally. He further showed his authority when in an attempt to reduce inter-clan feuding and lawlessness, he arranged and oversaw a gladiatorial limited combat between the clans of Kay and Quhele (Clan Chattan) in Perth on 28 April 1396. David of Carrick progressively acted independently of his father taking control of the Stewart lands in the south-west, while maintaining his links with the Drummonds of his mother, and <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when Fife's influence in central Scotland remained strong.|$|E

60|$|Despite Comyn's most unselfish optimism, I {{could see}} no light. And in the {{recklessness}} that so often besets youngsters of my temper, on like occasions, I went off to Newmarket next day with Mr. Fox and Lord Ossory, in his Lordship's travelling-chaise and four. I spent a very gay week trying to forget Miss Dolly. I was the loser by some three hundred pounds, in addition to what I expended and loaned to Mr. Fox. This young gentleman was then beginning to accumulate at Newmarket a most execrable stud. He lost prodigiously, but seemed in no wise disturbed thereby. I have never known a man who took his ill-luck with such a stoical nonchalance. Not so while the heat was on. As I write, a most ridiculous recollection rises of Charles dragging his Lordship and me and all who were with him {{to that part of}} the course where the race was highest, where he would act like a madman; blowing and perspiring, and whipping and swearing <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time,</b> and rising up and down as if the horse was throwing him.|$|E

40|$|Abstract [...] -The {{ever-increasing}} size of {{data sets}} and poor scalability of clustering algorithms has drawn attention to distributed clustering for partitioning large data sets. In this {{paper we propose}} an algorithm to cluster largescale data sets without clustering <b>all</b> the data <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> Data is randomly divided into almost equal size disjoint subsets. We then cluster each subset using the hard-k means or fuzzy k-means algorithm. The centroids of subsets form an ensemble. A centroid correspondence algorithm transitively solves the correspondence problem among the ensemble of centroids. The centroids are combined to form a global set of centroids. Experimental results show {{that most of the}} time the pattern of clusters generated by our algorithm is similar to the pattern of clusters generated by clustering <b>all</b> the data <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time.</b> We have shown that the disputed examples between the clusters generated by our algorithm and clustering <b>all</b> the data <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> lay on the spatial border of clusters.

50|$|For many {{real-world}} {{problems the}} domain elements cluster together into sets with common properties and relations. This structure {{can be represented}} as a hierarchy and is partially ordered on the subset of a relation. The expectation is that the domains are structured so that {{the elements of a}} set frequently share consistency properties permitting them to be retained or eliminated as a unit. Thus, if some elements of a set satisfy a constraint, but not all, the subsets of the set are considered. In this way, if no elements of a set can satisfy the constraint the whole set can be discarded. Thus, structuring the domain helps in considering sets of elements <b>all</b> <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> and hence helps in pruning the search space more quickly.|$|E
