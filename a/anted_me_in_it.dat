60|$|MARTHA--[With a wan smile.] Well, I've helped--all I could. His {{work has}} <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> I like to think--and I have him.|$|R
50|$|Her films include Satellites & Meteorites, {{directed}} by Rick Larkin, and A Film with <b>Me</b> <b>in</b> <b>It,</b> also starring Dylan Moran, both released in 2008.|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] shouted Almayer. [...] "Put on some clothes, Mrs. Willems, and let <b>me</b> <b>in.</b> <b>It's</b> [...] . very confidential. You have a candle, haven't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'They {{leave me}} to myself,' he replied. 'They know my humour. They laugh at me, but don't harm <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> See yonder there--that's my friend.' ...|$|R
6000|$|I am most {{anxious to}} find out the {{relation}} of the earth's diameter to its circumference. Can you, or any of your readers, assist <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>it?</b> ...|$|R
60|$|And this {{finishes}} {{my part of}} the story, and Jill {{is going}} to tell the rest. But you needn't believe everything she says about <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2008, O'Doherty starred {{alongside}} comedian Dylan Moran, Keith Allen and Neil Jordan in A Film with <b>Me</b> <b>in</b> <b>It,</b> a cinematic release {{written by}} and starring his brother Mark Doherty.|$|R
5000|$|The Smashing Pumpkins covered [...] "Dancing <b>in</b> the Moonlight (<b>It's</b> Caught <b>Me</b> <b>in</b> <b>Its</b> Spotlight)" [...] {{for various}} live performances, turning the upbeat, {{overlaid}} melody {{of the original}} into a slowly paced acoustic tune.|$|R
6000|$|... "You've sharp eyes, ain't you, to {{be seeing}} what warn't there to be seen at all? If you say you saw <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> I'll have the tongue out of your mouth, you young liar." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{only found}} you out. It was you who found <b>me</b> <b>in.</b> <b>It</b> was all <b>in</b> the day's work for them, at all events, {{that they should}} come. And they've greatly enjoyed it," [...] Strether declared.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, how did {{you learn}} Punjabi?" [...] he said, in surprise; [...] "and why did you not speak to <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> before? It would have saved me an immense deal of trouble, when I first came." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Experience {{confirms}} <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> A {{woman is}} nothing without {{a few years}} of grown-up girlhood before her marriage; and, what is more, no one can judge of her when she is fresh from the school-room. Raw material!' ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{he showed}} me an album with twenty-three {{photographs}} of <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> Five of them were of old dates, the others of various later crops; the list closed with a picture taken by Falk in Sydney a month before.|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, {{they only}} learn it after {{they come out}} here, while I learnt it from my mother, who has talked to <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> since I was quite a little boy; so it comes as {{naturally}} to me as to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'True, sir. Well, sir,' {{observed}} Venus, after {{clutching at}} his dusty hair, to brighten his ideas, 'let us {{put it another}} way.

60|$|I {{thanked her}} very heartily for that part, and indeed she served <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> more than I {{let her know}} she did: in a word, she thwarted the girl so cleverly, {{that if she had}} known the whole affair she could not have done it better.|$|R

6000|$|... "Madness {{or not it}} is my will, and beware how you thwart <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> Metem, for {{at least}} I am the Lady Baaltis, and have power to kill without question. I swear to you that if I do not see him, you shall never leave this city living." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Maybe! Maybe! But {{what could}} be better? What could be better than to lose oneself with someone you love, entirely, and so find yourself. Ah, my dear fellow, that is my creed, that is my creed, and you can't shake <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>it.</b> Never <b>in</b> that. Never in that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, they roped <b>me</b> <b>in.</b> <b>It</b> {{got about}} somehow that I was a {{valuable}} man and they wouldn't take no." [...] Sam deepened the colour of his ears. [...] "As {{a matter of}} fact," [...] he said casually, [...] "my fiancee made rather a point of my doing something." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 123. Also besides these {{teachings of}} God in His word, the Lord {{made use of}} two things to confirm <b>me</b> <b>in</b> this truth; the one was the errors of the Quakers {{and the other was}} the guilt of sin; for as the Quakers did oppose this truth, so God did the more confirm <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>it,</b> by leading <b>me</b> into the scripture that did wonderfully {{maintain}} it.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{thrust the}} great doors open, {{and by the}} hand led <b>me</b> <b>in.</b> <b>It</b> was a sad company.

50|$|The {{music video}} {{for me was}} about {{creating}} {{a piece of art}} and I wanted it to feel cinematic and like it's something you can immerse yourself <b>in.</b> Having <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> didn't feel like something that was necessary to create that world. So I'm just <b>in</b> <b>it</b> for just a little bit. I think it works well.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{care for}} her,' said Edgar; 'but {{it is just}} as well to have some notion of things, and Felix hasn't a grain. Why, all the fellows will be asking which of us is pepper, and which Souchong! I wouldn't have Froggatt or Bruce see <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> at no price.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not guilty, your honour," [...] {{answered}} the Irishwoman {{who had come}} from Lemuel's station. [...] "But make it aisy for me this time, judge, and ye'll never catch <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> again. I've three helpless childer at home, your honour, starvin' and cryin' for their mother. Holy Mary, make it aisy, judge!" ...|$|R
6000|$|He {{gave one}} deep gasp of relief, and {{instantly}} busied himself--though there were {{nearly two hours}} to spare before the train started for London--in packing his bag. The last thing he put in was his blue satin cravat. [...] "She likes bright colors," [...] he said, [...] "and she may see <b>me</b> <b>in</b> <b>it</b> yet!" ...|$|R
