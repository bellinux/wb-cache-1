50|$|Shifting {{cultivation}} {{was assessed}} by the FAO to be one a causes of deforestation while logging was not. The <b>apparent</b> <b>discrimination</b> against shifting cultivators caused a confrontation between FAO and environmental groups, who saw the FAO supporting commercial logging interests against the rights of indigenous people (Potter 1993, 108). Other independent studies of the problem note that despite lack of government control over forests and the dominance of a political elite in the logging industry, the causes of deforestation are more complex. The loggers have provided paid employment to former subsistence farmers. One of the outcomes of cash incomes has been rapid population growth among indigenous groups of former shifting cultivators that has placed pressure on their traditional long fallow farming systems. Many farmers {{have taken advantage of}} the improved road access to urban areas by planting cash crops, such as rubber or pepper as noted above. Increased cash incomes often are spent on chain saws, which have enabled larger areas to be cleared for cultivation. Fallow periods have been reduced and cropping periods extended. Serious poverty elsewhere in the country has brought thousands of land hungry settlers into the cut over forests along the logging roads. The settlers practice what appears to be shifting cultivation but which is in fact a one-cycle slash and burn followed by continuous cropping, with no intention to long fallow. Clearing of trees and the permanent cultivation of fragile soils in a tropical environment with little attempt to replace lost nutrients may cause rapid degradation of the fragile soils.|$|E
5000|$|Jacques Leibowitch is at {{the center}} of the {{research}} on AIDS since the original outbreak of the epidemic, from the very moment when the investigation on its causative agent was launched. When the first series of AIDS cases in the United States were published in the New England Journal of Medicine and the Lancet in December 1981, Leibowitch noticed the similarity between the cases described in the United States and the historic case of a multiple-opportunistic infection syndrome in a Portuguese resident in Paris who had spent time in Angola and Mozambique between 1973 -76. He was then contacted by Willy Rozenbaum in March 1982 to set up the informal French Working Group SIDA, a self-nominated body to analyse the cases appearing in France.When in July 1982, the first cases of AIDS appear in hemophiliacs receiving highly filtered blood samples, the scientific community realized that AIDS was most likely caused by a virus. Jacques Leibowitch noticed some intriguing similarities between AIDS and the pathology linked to HTLV (Human T Cell Leukemia Lymphoma Virus), the only known human retro-virus at that time. Both situations affect CD4 T helper lymphocyte cells. HTLV induces the massive proliferation of one or several clones and their cancerization, whereas the other virus, the HIV virus tends to eradicate these cells without <b>apparent</b> <b>discrimination.</b> Otherwise, these two pathological descriptions are present in both Africa and the Caribbean (see. A Strange Virus of Unknown Origin Jacques Leibowitch, Ballantine Books, New York, 1985, translated from Un Virus Etrange Venu d’Ailleurs, Grasset Paris 1984 [...] ). Indeed, in both Paris and Brussels, doctors had seen cases of patients having lived or spent time in Francophone Africa or in Haiti who suffered from a disease with an undeniable resemblance to that arising at the time in the United States in [...] "immuno-deficient homosexuals". Leibowitch, informed by the Franco-American literary author Gilles Barbedette of the announcement by Robert Gallo in Medical World News (August 1, 1982) that an HTLV type retro-virus could be at the cause of AIDS, found in that most succinct brief the profile matching his CD4-tropic exotic viral suspect (in Grasset, Ballantine Books, workS cited). The retro-viral inspiration was thus consolidated and opened between Bethesda (Gallo) and Paris (Leibowitch et al.) from August 1982 onwards. Failing to find in the Paris team of Professeur Jean-Paul Lévy [...] or the Lille team of Dominique Stéhelin a French retro-virus specialist eager to pursue this line of investigation, he contacted upon a recommendation by Jean Paul Lévy Professor Robert Gallo in Bethesda, the then world-renowned virologist on HTLV. It was then in November 1982 that Gallo informed him from Bethesda of his initial virology findings in keeping with the AIDS HTLV-type virus hypotheses. For his part, Willy Rozenbaum, warned in private by Leibowitch that an exotic HTLV-type retrovirus could well be the cause of AIDS, embarks upon a discreet collaboration with the Luc Montagnier team of the Pasteur Institute. Montagnier, along with his collaborator Jean-Claude Chermann, had just recently received news of the HTLV and AIDS hypotheses by Dr Paul Prunet, the then director of « Recherche&Développement » at Sanofi-Pasteur-Marnes La Coquette, where Leibowitch had given a speech at the end of November 1982. The Montagnier team subsequently detected in the cell culture of patient BRU the traces of the first non HTLV retrovirus in January 1983, a virus eventually recognized as the cause of AIDS thanks to the conclusive additions by Robert Gallo and his group (April 1984) sur le site de la Jon Cohen AIDS Research Collection, 2 pages. Luc Montagnier and Françoise Barré-Sinoussi received the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 2008 for their work. In a letter to the prestigious magazine Nature Medicine in 2003, as well as in his Nobel Prize acceptance speech in 2008, Luc Montagnier recognizes Jacques Leibowitch as being the initiator of the retro-virus hypothesis in France [...] However, the patented list of the discoverers of AIDS and HIV do not take Jacques Leibowitch into account for his contribution in the initial phases of the discovery. The scientific historian Mirko Grmek reflects back on the details of the stages that led to the discovery of the AIDS virus in his work “the History of AIDS” and the Jon Cohen AIDS Research Collection contains numerous archived documents on the subject. The book “Sida.O” (AIDS.O) written by D. Lestrade and G.Pialoux contains also many details on the history of AIDS.|$|E

40|$|Some psychophysicists seek {{a unified}} theory {{in which the}} scaling of {{apparent}} sensory magnitude and the discrimination of differences in intensity can be encompassed. When contextual factors are held constant, {{there is a positive}} correlation over many sensory continua between the exponent of the power function for sensory scaling and the inverse of the Weber fraction. Variations in neural efficiency also show a similar correlation with <b>apparent</b> magnitude and <b>discrimination.</b> The role of other factors (such as contrast, adaptation and size scaling) remains unclear. Both Weber and Fechner considered aspects of these issues. Weber held that, for the same physical stimulus intensity, apparent magnitude and discriminatory ability increased with neural efficiency. Fechner held that changes in apparent magnitude had no effect on discrimination: a stable differential threshold was predicted by the Parallel Law (Weber's Law applied to internal sensations). Evidence is considered for the tactile sense and weight perception, and for visual size. The relation between apparent heaviness and weight discrimination is complex, varying with the state of adaptation and with neural efficiency. There is some evidence that both tactile and visual apparent size increase with a finer underlying neural structure; but it is unclear whether other tyoes of increase in apparent size lead to increased spatial acuity, or to differences in the Weber fraction for line length.

Given the reported deficits for form discrimination but a high sensitivity for orientation discrimination in primates without striate cortex, the question arises whether D. B.

A range of form discriminations is presented varying in degree of orientation cues of their components. It is confirmed that he can discriminate those forms originally studied, in which such differences are large, but not when orientation cues are small or minimal. Finally, his ability to compare two forms both projected within his scotoma is examined. Even when the components of the two forms have large orientation differences and are highly discriminable when presented successfully, D.

This unique, phenomenological study sought to discover the impact of the dyslexic profile on clinical practice for nursing trainees. Two focus groups of second year nursing students in Higher Education were set up to gather the data: a control group and a dyslexic group. The findings were congruent with the literature in that students provided evidence of literacy difficulties, memory problems, lack of automaticity skills, issues of self-esteem and some specific skills deficits.

A simple method for simulating ion trajectories at nonzero pressures based on ion mobility and explicit diffusion is described. This theoretical approach was used to design and calculate ion trajectories for the modified funnel presented here. Finally, the increased spacing between electrodes in the current funnel significantly relaxes machining constraints, reduces cost, and enhances ease of use versus previous funnel designs...|$|E
40|$|The {{anterior}} thalamic nuclei {{form part}} of a network for episodic memory in humans. The importance of these nuclei for recognition and recency judgments remains, however, unclear. Rats with anterior thalamic nuclei lesions and their controls were tested on object recognition, along with two types of recency judgment. The spontaneous discrimination of a novel object or a novel odor from a familiar counterpart (recognition memory) was not affected by anterior thalamic lesions when tested after retention delays of 1 and 60 min. To measure recency memory, rats were shown two familiar objects, one {{of which had been}} explored more recently. In one condition, rats were presented with two lists (List A, List B) of objects separated by a delay, thereby creating two distinct blocks of stimuli. After an additional delay, rats were presented with pairs of objects, one from List A and one from List B (between-block recency). No lesion-induced deficit was <b>apparent</b> for recency <b>discriminations</b> between objects from different lists, despite using three different levels of task difficulty. In contrast, rats with anterior thalamic lesions were significantly impaired when presented with a continuous list of objects and then tested on their ability to distinguish between those items early and late in the same list (within-block recency). The contrasting effects on recognition and recency support the notion that interlinked hippocampal–anterior thalamic interconnections support aspects of both spatial and nonspatial learning, although the role of the anterior thalamic nuclei may be restricted to a subclass of recency judgments (within-block) ...|$|R
40|$|Depois de séculos de exclusão, as mulheres conseguem no século 20 sua inserção na universidade. O ingresso no mundo acadêmico é, sem dúvida, atravessado por diversas formas de discriminação, manifestas e encobertas, que contribuem para a formatação de trajetórias universitárias diferenciadas para homens e mulheres, assim como para uma participação desigual no próprio exercício do poder acadêmico. Embora a academia feminista tenha estimulado a produção de conhecimentos científicos não sexistas, analisando e redimensionando concepções epistemológicas tradicionais, o conteúdo e a metodologia científica hegemônica continuam manifestando traços sutilmente androcêntricos. Neste sentido, os aportes dos estudos de gênero podem contribuir com seu potencial dinamizador para a exploração crítica e para a transformação do conhecimento científico atual, bem como para uma inserção mais efetiva das mulheres nos espaços acadêmicos. ____________________________________________________________________________________ ABSTRACTAfter {{centuries of}} exclusion, {{women in the}} 20 th century were {{admitted}} at University. However, diverse forms of <b>discrimination,</b> <b>apparent</b> or veiled, have crisscrossed women access to the academic world. This situation has contributed to consolidate different university itineraries for men and women, {{as well as an}} unequal participation in the very academic power. Moreover, {{if it is true that}} feminist academy has stimulated the production of a nonsexist scientific knowledge, analyzing and reformulating traditional epistemological conceptions, it is also true that hegemonic scientific contents and methodologies present subtle trace of androcentrism still today. In this sense, the contribution of gender studies may provide its motivating potential to critical exploration. Gender studies may also contribute to the transformation of contemporary scientific knowledge, and to consolidate a wider and more effective insertion for women into the academic space...|$|R
40|$|A {{previous}} study¹ {{compared the}} ability of normal–hearing ‘naïve’ listeners to learn to discriminate low–frequency ongoing interaural time difference (ITD) or high–frequency interaural level difference (ILD), two important cues to localisation. The authors concluded that learning for ILD had a longer time course and only partially transferred across frequency (~ 0. 6 octaves), interpreted {{in the context of}} known differences in the processing of the two cues. Are differences in learning <b>apparent</b> with the <b>discrimination</b> of low–frequency ITD and high–frequency envelope– based ITD cues? We have addressed this using a 128 –Hz tone and a 128 –Hz tone ‘transposed’ to 4000 Hz; ITD sensitivity with these stimuli is comparable in highly trained listeners², thereby minimising a confounding effect of differential overall sensitivity when interpreting learning. Twenty naïve listeners were trained over 2160 trials with one or other stimulus or served as untrained controls. Performance was measured with both stimuli and sinusoidally amplitude modulated (SAM) tones during pre– and post–training sessions. ITD discrimination was measured using a 1 –cue, 3 –alternative forced–choice task and listeners were trained using a modified Levitt 2 –down, 1 –up adaptive procedure³. Overall, performance on pre– training was comparable for unmodulated and transposed stimuli but better than with SAM, although inter–individual variation was apparent. This reinforces the notion that ongoing ITD processing is functionally uniform across frequency. Both training groups learned more than untrained controls but the learning with either trained stimulus transferred entirely to the untrained stimuli. That is, learning generalised across both frequency (~ 5 octaves) and type of ITD cue. This generalisation may reflect commonality in the necessary listening strategies for optimal performance (e. g. detection of decorrelation) or the pooling across frequency in the underlying processing for ITD discrimination.
