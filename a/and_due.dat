5|$|After much deliberation, Raskolnikov sneaks into Alyona Ivanovna's apartment, {{where he}} murders {{her with an}} axe. He also kills her half-sister, Lizaveta, who happens to stumble upon {{the scene of the}} crime. Shaken by his actions, Raskolnikov manages to steal only a handful of items and a small purse, leaving much of the pawn-broker's wealth untouched. Raskolnikov then flees <b>and,</b> <b>due</b> to a series of coincidences, manages to leave unseen and undetected.|$|E
5|$|Ann Eliza Bleecker's {{pastoral}} poems exemplified a {{new style}} of American poetry, <b>and,</b> <b>due</b> to her experience of the American Revolutionary tumult, {{a new sense of}} national identity. These poems, written in the pastoral tradition, conveyed both the beauty of the colonial New York countryside and the horrific impact of war, suffering, death, and destruction. Because Bleecker was writing from the interesting perspective of a terrified young mother, her articulate depictions of the Revolutionary War are still read by historians today.|$|E

5|$|Another {{concern is}} the fact that {{sugarcane}} fields are traditionally burned just before harvest to avoid harm to the workers, by removing the sharp leaves and killing snakes and other harmful animals, and also to fertilize the fields with ash. Mechanization will reduce pollution from burning fields and has higher productivity than people, <b>and</b> <b>due</b> to mechanization the number of temporary workers in the sugarcane plantations has already declined. By the 2008 harvest season, around 47% of the cane was collected with harvesting machines.|$|E

5|$|Around 300men from Cheadle Hulme {{served in}} the First World War, and {{it was decided that}} those who died should be commemorated.

5|$|At {{the time}} of McCarthy's speech, {{communism}} was a significant concern in the United States. This concern was exacerbated {{by the actions of}} the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe, the victory of the communists in the Chinese Civil War, the Soviets' development of a nuclear weapon the year before, and by the contemporary controversy surrounding Alger Hiss and the confession of Soviet spy Klaus Fuchs. With this background <b>and</b> <b>due</b> to the sensational nature of McCarthy's charge against the State Department, the Wheeling speech soon attracted a flood of press interest in McCarthy's claim.|$|E
