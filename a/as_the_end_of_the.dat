5|$|Odoacer {{advanced}} on Ravenna, {{capturing the}} city and the young emperor. Romulus was compelled to abdicate the throne on 4 September 476. This act has been cited <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Western Roman Empire, although Romulus' deposition did not cause any significant disruption at the time. Rome had already lost its hegemony over the provinces, Germans dominated the Roman army and Germanic generals like Odoacer had long been the real powers behind the throne. Italy would suffer far greater devastation in the next century when Emperor Justinian I reconquered it.|$|E
5|$|Sporadic {{fighting}} {{continued in}} the hills surrounding Jerusalem. On Christmas Day, Falkenhayn launched another counter assault, which was repulsed with heavy losses. Some British newspapers and magazines, including The Irish News, claimed it <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> crusades. A US newspaper also made reference to the Crusades, specifically the New York Herald (see picture), referring to the last time Jerusalem was under non-Muslim rule in 1244 AD when a Khwarezmian army under Al-Salih Ayyub, defeated the Franks. Britain would hold Jerusalem {{until the end of}} Mandatory Palestine in 1948.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the season, Wensloff {{remained}} a major part of the starting rotation. His losses included a 10 defeat in which he only allowed one unearned run on a wild throw against the St. Louis Browns. During the season, Wensloff added a knuckleball to his selection of pitches, which he threw regularly during the season. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> season approached, Wensloff was being promoted as a rookie of the year candidate, due to being second on the team in strikeouts, as well as his 13 wins. Wensloff finished the season with a 13–11 record and a 2.54 ERA in 29 games, 27 of them starts. He did not pitch in the 1943 World Series, though he was on the roster.|$|E

Grissom enrolled at Purdue University, graduating with a bachelor's in mechanical engineering in 1950. He re{{enlisted in the}} United States Air Force, earning his pilot's wings in 1951. Grissom flew over 100 combat missions during the Korean War, earning the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air Medal with an oak leaf cluster.

5|$|In early 1943, the 14th/32nd Battalion {{carried out}} amphibious warfare {{training}} in Queensland before being deployed to the Buna–Gona area in New Guinea in July. The battalion {{would remain in}} mainland New Guinea and New Britain {{for the next two}} years, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William Caldwell. The strategy employed by the Australians during the New Britain campaign was one of containment against the much larger Japanese forces in the area. On 18 March 1945, the battalion took part in its only major battle of the war when it launched an assault on Bacon Hill and captured it. In April 1945, the 14th/32nd Battalion was withdrawn back to Australia in preparation for involvement in future operations, however, in July {{the decision was made to}} disband the unit <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> war became apparent. During the course of the conflict the battalion suffered 77 casualties, of which 31 were killed in action or died of wounds or other causes. Members of the battalion received the following decorations for their service: one DSO, one OBE, two MCs, one British Empire Medal, one DCM, one MM and seven MIDs.|$|E
5|$|On 17 January 1968, the Khmer Rouge {{launched}} their first offensive. It was aimed more at gathering weapons and spreading propaganda than in seizing territory since, at that time, the adherents {{of the insurgency}} numbered no more than 4–5,000. During the same month, the communists established the Revolutionary Army of Kampuchea as the military wing of the party. As early <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Battambang revolt, Sihanouk had begun to reevaluate {{his relationship with the}} communists. His earlier agreement with the Chinese had availed him nothing. They had not only failed to restrain the North Vietnamese, but they had actually involved themselves (through the Khmer Rouge) in active subversion within his country.|$|E

5|$|South of Ardnamurchan, Gaelic {{place names}} are more common, {{and after the}} 13th century, Gaelic became the main {{language}} of the entire Hebridean archipelago. Due to Scots and English being favored in government and the educational system, the Hebrides {{have been in a}} state of diglossia since at least the seventeenth century. The Highland Clearances of the nineteenth century accelerated the language shift away from Scottish Gaelic, as did increased migration and the continuing lower status of Gaelic speakers. Nevertheless, as late <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nineteenth century, there were significant populations of monolingual Gaelic speakers, and the Hebrides still contain the highest percentages of Gaelic speakers in Scotland. This is especially true of the Outer Hebrides, where a slim majority speak the language. The Scottish Gaelic college, Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, is based on Skye and Islay.|$|E
5|$|The {{peace talks}} that begun in 1247 {{achieved}} little, {{but a new}} truce was arranged in September 1248 and peace was made on November 24, 1248. Swantopolk had to return lands seized from his brothers, allow Teutonic Knights to pass through his domains, stop charging tolls on ships using the Vistula, and stop any aid to the Prussians. Prussians were compelled to sign the Treaty of Christburg on February 7, 1249. The treaty provided personal freedom and rights to newly converted Christians. It formally ended the uprising, but already in November 1249 the Natangians defeated the Knights at the Battle of Krücken. The skirmishes lasted until 1253 and some sources cite this year <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> uprising. At that point the treaty ceased its political power but remained an interesting historical document.|$|E
5|$|Dylan, a 28 year-old grad student, is {{depressed}} {{because he}} {{is in love with}} his best friend, Kira, but she is dating Dylan's roommate, Mason. He has a cynical worldview and criticizes the world for its materialism, {{and at the same time}} wishes he could connect better with the people in it. When his roommate is away one night, Dylan and Kira begin a secret affair. When Dylan overhears Mason and Kira discussing how pitiful he is, Dylan decides to commit suicide. He jumps off a tall building, but survives due to unlikely events. That night, he is visited by a demon who claims he spared Dylan's life. The demon says Dylan must now murder one person for every additional month he wants to live. Dylan convinces himself this was a hallucination, but he begins to grow sick <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> month approaches. When the demon appears a second time, Dylan decides to track down a man who molested Dylan's friend when they were children. After shooting him, Dylan's sickness goes away. The next month, Dylan struggles to find another target he feels deserves to die. He settles on a brothel run by a Russian mob. He murders one of the men, but is violently beaten by one of the sex workers before he escapes. His unexplained injuries lead Kira to end their secret romance, although they remain friends. Dylan begins taking boxing lessons and stalking a corrupt businessman. A detective, Lily Sharpe, begins to connect the dots between Dylan's murders; the Russian mob begins to hunt for Dylan.|$|E

5|$|Yang and Hunt {{distance}} themselves from {{each other as they}} keep fighting over the abortion, despite attending marriage counselling. Hunt has a one-night stand with a patient's friend, leaving Yang heartbroken. She decides to move on, unsure of her future with him. <b>As</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fifth year of residency is near, the surgical residents, including Yang, prepare for their medical boards and for the different fellowships they plan on joining. After she passes her exams, Yang reconciles with Hunt and tells him she is leaving Seattle for the Mayo Clinic, Minnesota. Afterward, Yang, Meredith, Shepherd, Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), and Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh) are involved in an aviation accident while on the way to Boise, Idaho to perform surgery on conjoined twins. Lexie dies, and Mark later succumbs to his injuries after they are rescued and dies. Following their rescue, Yang, traumatized, suffers from brief reactive psychosis which provokes violent outbursts and makes her unresponsive. Yang leaves Seattle to become a cardiothoracic surgical fellow and goes, as planned, to the Mayo Clinic, but has difficulties adapting to her new colleagues' way of working. While in Minnesota, Yang develops a friendship with a near-retirement cardio surgeon, Craig Thomas (William Daniels). She mainly teases him with comments regarding his old age. She also begins an affair with the head of surgery Dr. Parker (Steven Culp) who has issues with Thomas. After Thomas dies from a heart attack, Yang returns to Seattle.|$|E
