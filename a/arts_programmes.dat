25|$|From 1936 to 1992 Wellington {{was home}} to the National Art Gallery of New Zealand, when it was amalgamated into Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa. Wellington {{is home to the}} New Zealand Academy of Fine Arts and the Arts Foundation of New Zealand. The city's arts centre, Toi Poneke, is a nexus of {{creative}} projects, collaborations, and multi-disciplinary production. <b>Arts</b> <b>Programmes</b> and Services Manager Eric Vaughn Holowacz and a small team based in the Abel Smith Street facility have produced ambitious initiatives such as Opening Notes, Drive by Art, and public art projects. The city is home to experimental arts publication White Fungus. The Learning Connexion provides art classes. Other visual art galleries include the City Gallery.|$|E
25|$|The channel has {{sometimes}} been judged, increasingly in more recent years, to have moved away from this original role and to have {{moved closer to the}} mainstream. Since the launch of the digital-only BBC Four, the BBC has been accused in particular of shifting its more highbrow output to the new channel, which, {{until the end of the}} UK's digital TV switchover in October 2012, a minority (7.5% in the final quarter of 2010) of viewers did not receive. BBC Four's remit is very similar to that of the earlier remit of BBC2, and contains many documentaries and <b>arts</b> <b>programmes.</b> It has been perceived by some that this strategy is to allow BBC Two to show more popular programmes and to secure higher ratings. Since 2004 there have been some signs of an attempt to return closer to parts of BBC Two's earlier output with the arts strand The Culture Show. Its most popular programme at the moment is Top Gear.|$|E

The country's navy announced that it would fire on any ship that entered its waters, and M.I.A. was singled out on the Sri Lankan army's official website after the singer announced her support for the campaign.

2500|$|Writing in 2015, Noakes and Ford {{noted that}} [...] "Post-secondary {{institutions}} {{across the country}} – from agricultural universities to law schools to fine <b>arts</b> <b>programmes</b> – require students {{to prove that they}} have adopted the “correct attitude” on Falun Gong as a condition of admission." [...] For example, students are many universities are required to obtain a certificate from the public security ministry certifying that they have no affiliation with Falun Gong. The same is true in employment, with job postings frequently specifying that prospective candidates must have no record of participation in Falun Gong. In some cases, even changing one's address requires proving the correct political attitude toward Falun Gong.|$|E
2500|$|Marks {{was born}} to Jewish parents; his father {{was the son of}} {{immigrants}} from Ukraine. Brought up in Harrow, London, Marks was educated at Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School and Trinity College, Cambridge. Originally he hoped for a career in the theatre and {{was a member of the}} National Youth Theatre. Obtaining a job, originally as a researcher, at the BBC, he became a director and producer of television <b>arts</b> <b>programmes.</b> While making a programme in 1972 about Shandy Hall (home of the writer Laurence Sterne), he met the writer Michael Frayn and the two became lifelong friends. Leaving the BBC to work as an independent producer, Marks was invited back by Alan Yentob and eventually became Head of Music Programmes at the BBC. During this time he became involved in opera, including directing television versions [...] of Michael Tippett's New Year and Mark-Anthony Turnage's Greek.|$|E

2500|$|An earlier {{incident}} that gained much more attention and complaints, but {{which had a}} different outcome, occurred during a June 1, 2011 broadcast of Canada Live, when Krista Erickson discussed public funding for <b>arts</b> <b>programmes</b> with interpretive dancer Margie Gillis. During the discussion, Erickson took an aggressive verbal tone towards a soft-spoken Gillis, shouting over Gillis's responses and challenging her comments about lack of compassion amongst Canadians when, to quote Erickson, [...] "We have lost more than 150 soldiers who have served in Afghanistan!" [...] Though Sun News stood by Erickson and her conduct in the Gillis interview, the CBSC would receive 6,676 complaints from viewers over the incident, considerably {{more than twice the}} annual average number of complaints the Council receives. After reviewing the complaints, the CBSC determined in February 2012 that no violation of Clause 6 of the Code of Ethics occurred, stating that Erickson's line of questioning, though forceful, did not cross into personal attacks.|$|E
2500|$|Clark was no {{stranger}} to broadcasting. He had appeared on air frequently from 1936, when he gave a radio talk on an exhibition of Chinese Art at Burlington House; the following year he made his television debut, presenting Florentine paintings from the National Gallery. During the war he appeared regularly on BBC radio's The Brains Trust. While presiding over the new ITA he generally kept off the air, and concentrated on keeping the new network going during its difficult early years. By the end of his three-year term as chairman, Clark was hailed as a success, but privately considered that there were too few high-quality programmes on the network. Lew Grade, who as chairman of Associated Television (ATV) held one of the ITV franchises, felt strongly that Clark should make <b>arts</b> <b>programmes</b> of his own, and as soon as Clark stood down as chairman in 1957, he accepted Grade's invitation. Stourton comments, [...] "this was the true beginning of arguably his most successful career – as a presenter of the arts on television".|$|E

40|$|In 1999, {{the provincial}} {{government}} of the Western Cape entered into a partnership with M?decins Sans Fronti?res (MSF) to provide HIV treatment through public health clinics in the peri-urban settlement of Khayelitsha. From 2000 onwards, this partnership ran South Africa’s first antiretroviral treatment (<b>ART)</b> <b>programme.</b> Due to the province’s limited experience in 1999 in implementing and monitoring an <b>ART</b> <b>programme,</b> and the National Health Department’s opposition to the public provision of ART, this partnership was instrumental in piloting and later scaling-up the Western Cape’s <b>ART</b> <b>programme.</b> The partnership demonstrated that <b>ART</b> <b>programmes</b> could be implemented successfully within resource-constrained settings, {{with high levels of}} adherence, low rates of loss to follow up, and excellent health outcomes. Its components and strategies are therefore of vital significance to the roll-out and maintenance of <b>ART</b> <b>programmes</b> in various contexts across the developing world. Based on information gathered through interviews with key players, this article examines the factors that facilitated the public provision of ART in the Western Cape.
