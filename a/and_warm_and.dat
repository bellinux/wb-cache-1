5|$|A strong {{jet stream}} moved {{northeast}} across the Great Plains region {{and a strong}} surface low in western Kansas strengthened as it moved to the Nebraska-South Dakota border. Ahead of the low, very warm and moist air spread throughout the South Central United States into Nebraska, eastern sections of South Dakota and the upper Mississippi Valley. The combination of strong winds <b>and</b> <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> moist air created conditions favorable for strong thunderstorms. On June 5, {{a high risk of}} severe weather was issued for six different states in the Midwestern United States, with a moderate risk area surrounding the high risk area. Forecasters had warned of a potentially historic outbreak, as computer forecasting models for June 5resembled those on June 8, 1974, when 39tornadoes struck the southern Great Plains and killed 22people. Wichita State University canceled evening classes because of the weather predictions. Severe weather began developing across eastern Colorado and northwestern Kansas during the morning and into the early afternoon, producing several weak tornadoes in the process. An EF1tornado impacted a campground near Kellogg, Iowa and injured two people. Despite extremely favorable conditions, severe weather for the day was limited and the tornadoes generally caused minimal damage.|$|E

The design itself contributes actively to energy conservation. The thick earthen walls provide thermal insulation, keeping the interiors cool during the day <b>and</b> <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> cozy during the night, obviating the need for air-conditioning. The ambience that the interiors of the earthen structures provide is one of cool comfort.|$|E
25|$|Arthritis {{of joints}} {{involves}} {{inflammation of the}} synovial membrane. Joints become swollen, tender <b>and</b> <b>warm,</b> <b>and</b> stiffness limits their movement. With time, multiple joints are affected (polyarthritis). Most commonly involved are the small joints of the hands, feet and cervical spine, but larger joints like the shoulder and knee can also be involved. Synovitis can lead to tethering of tissue with loss of movement and erosion of the joint surface causing deformity and loss of function.|$|E

25|$|Ventilation ducts {{ran through}} the gaps {{in the body and}} through the cable duct under the floor. They had {{openings}} in the floor and under the windows. The ventilation system doubled as cooling for the braking resistances. During cold weather the carriage air could be routed via the resistance to heat it, <b>and</b> <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> cold air could be mixed at various levels. As there was no resistance in the trailers, these were equipped with electric heaters. The trams had a 24-volt lighting system with cabin lighting from fluorescent lamps.|$|E
25|$|The {{mountains}} also block {{most of the}} oceanic {{influence of}} the Atlantic, which creates a climate much more continental than nearby cities west or north of the mountains, like Limoges and Montluçon. Thus the city has comparatively cold winters and hot summers. From November to March, frost is very frequent, and the city, being {{at the bottom of}} a valley, is frequently subject to temperature inversion, in which the mountains are sunny <b>and</b> <b>warm,</b> <b>and</b> the plain is freezing cold and cloudy. Snow is quite common, although usually short-lived and light. Summer temperatures often exceed , with sometimes violent thunderstorms.|$|E
25|$|The term Chinook wind is {{also used}} in British Columbia, and is the {{original}} usage, being rooted in the lore of coastal tribes and brought to Alberta by the fur-traders. Such winds are extremely wet <b>and</b> <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> arrive off the western coast of North America from the southwest. The winds are {{also known as the}} pineapple express, since they are of tropical origin, roughly from the area of the Pacific near Hawaii. The air associated with a west coast Chinook is stable; this minimizes wind gusts and often keeps winds light in sheltered areas. In exposed areas, fresh gales are frequent during a Chinook, but strong gale- or storm-force winds are uncommon (most of the region’s stormy winds come when a fast ‘westerly’ jet stream lets air masses from temperate and subarctic latitudes clash).|$|E

25|$|Based on data {{gathered}} by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Oakland is ranked No. 1 in climate among U.S. cities. Oakland's climate is typified by the temperate and seasonal Mediterranean climate. Summers are usually dry <b>and</b> <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> winters are mild and damp. It has features found in both nearby coastal cities such as San Francisco and inland cities such as San Jose, making it warmer than San Francisco and cooler than San Jose. Its position on San Francisco Bay across from the Bay Bridge means {{the northern part of}} the city can have cooling maritime fog. It is far enough inland the fog often burns off by midday, allowing it to have typically sunny California days. The hills tend to have more fog than the flatlands, as the fog drifts down from Berkeley.|$|E

500|$|Fruit bodies grow {{together}} {{in small groups}} {{on the ground in}} association with Bishop Pine (Pinus muricata). It is the most common Suillus species on Santa Cruz Island, its type locality and it has also been collected at Santa Rosa Island, and Point Reyes National Seashore in California. Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa, two of the four islands that make up the northern Channel Islands, have a Mediterranean climate with cool and wet winters, <b>and</b> <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> dry summers. [...] Most species of Suillus do not have spores that survive in the soil for extended periods of time, but the spores of S.quiescens can tolerate the dry conditions and heat typical of California. Another study showed that viable S.quiescens spores were present in steam-pasteurized soil planted in Oregon fields. The authors suggest that S.quiescens is an early successional species that fruits in young forests, and whose spores remain dormant in the soil for extended periods of time until the roots of a suitable pine host are encountered.|$|E

500|$|Director of {{photography}} Bill Roe later {{stated that he}} borrowed motifs from Steven Soderbergh's 2000 film Traffic {{for some of the}} shots. In addition, before filming, he decided to do various test shots to get the lighting right. The crew ended up shooting [...] "exteriors three, four stops over what you should shoot it at", resulting in very washed out outdoor scenes. Roe and his crew had a hard time developing the various lighting contrasts for the episode. When talking about the episode, Roe said: [...] "it was really dark so we had this huge contrast of lighting. It was dark <b>and</b> <b>warm</b> <b>and</b> brown. When you go inside, you can barely see things, but when you're outside, it's just blaring." [...] To create the Mexican town featured in the episode, scenes were filmed at a small town located outside of Los Angeles. A matte of the town's background and blue sky were then cut and a faux Mexican background was added. In addition, Mat Beck was given a flyer, and he duplicated it, making several strings of posters that did not exist when the shots were filmed.|$|E
