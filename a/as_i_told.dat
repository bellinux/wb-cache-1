25|$|And <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> you, {{these are}} the two {{secondary}} causes {{of the decline of}} art; the first being the loss of moral purpose. Pray note them clearly. In mediæval art, thought is the first thing, execution the second; in modern art execution is the first thing, and thought the second. And again, in mediæval art, truth is first, beauty second; in modern art, beauty is first, truth second. The mediæval principles led up to Raphael, and the modern principles lead down from him.|$|E
2500|$|L: You have {{certainly}} done your duty. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> you only this morning, I admire your courage and your great contributions to your country. No one can {{take away from}} you the credit for all you have done. Now I am worried about your physical safety. I have a report that those {{in charge of the}} current activity offer you and your brother safe conduct out of the country if you resign. Had you heard this? ...|$|E
2500|$|Eyewitness and ISM member Tom Dale, {{commenting on}} the 2012 verdict said: [...] "Whatever one thinks about the {{visibility}} from a D9 bulldozer, it is inconceivable {{that at some point}} the driver did not see her, given the distance from which he approached, while she stood, unmoving, in front of it. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> the court, just before she was crushed, Rachel briefly stood on top of the rolling mound of earth which had gathered in front of the bulldozer: her head was above the level of the blade, and just a few meters from the driver." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> {{the dream}} {{there in the}} Club that night just <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> it here.|$|R

2500|$|However, Ellis, {{releasing}} a letter Monday evening {{that he sent}} Saturday to county Chief Operating Officer Robert W. Graf, denies violating the agreement. The letter, in part, states: [...] "As for Ms. Bradley and myself, that case was amicably closed April 1 and never violated by either party. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> Ms. Jackson, I did mistakenly dial Ms. Bradley on her cell when trying to call someone with a very close number and I dialed too quickly...after four years, {{it was an old}} habit. Nothing was said and I immediately hung up when I realized my mistake. That happened one time in a month. I have said nothing to Ms. Bradley nor seen her in or out of the county workplace." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vice Admiral William P. Mack {{recalled}} {{the antics of}} the diminutive vice chief: [...] "He would grab three-star officers by the lapels, literally shake them, and say, 'Why don't you do so and so or such and such?' They'd be thirty or forty pounds heavier than he was, but that didn't bother him at all. He was there for two years, which was probably about a year too long, because morale was getting pretty low. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> Admiral Burke, {{it was just a}} matter of time before someone was going to slug him. You can't operate like that. Admiral Felt wasn't big enough to defend himself. I said that one of these days he's going to come at someone who's going to wipe up the corridor with him, regardless of how many stars he has." ...|$|E

No. So, as far as my {{conscience}} and my mission were concerned, there was no problem. This needs to be clarified...My experience was the same as that of my movement. We were new and inexperienced and events kept occurring one after the other which we had to deal with. In doing that, we made mistakes <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> you. I admit it now and I admitted it in the notes I have written. Whoever wishes to blame or attack me is entitled to do so. I regret I didn't have enough experience to totally control the movement. On the other hand, with our constant struggle, this had to be done together with others in the communist world to stop Kampuchea becoming Vietnamese. For the love of the nation and the people it was the right thing to do but in the course of our actions we made mistakes." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>told</b> her, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> had <b>told</b> Major Fitz-David, that I {{had reason}} to think Mr. Dexter's advice might be of real {{assistance}} to me at starting.|$|R
60|$|I had but {{one answer}} {{to make to}} that appeal. Without a moment's {{hesitation}} <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him the truth, <b>as</b> unreservedly <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> it in these pages.|$|R

[...] "My lawyers--I am very displeased, by-the-by, with Mr. Wadham--having {{been unable}} {{for many years}} to assist me in {{disposing}} of the mortgages upon Mandeleys, I am making efforts myself in that direction, efforts which, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> believe <b>I</b> <b>told</b> you, show much promise of success." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Peter," [...] {{a shrill}} voice cried {{from inside the}} house, [...] "how often have <b>I</b> <b>told</b> you not to be gossiping on public affairs with strangers? Your tongue will cost you your head presently, <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> you a score of times." ...|$|R

6000|$|So it was {{not because}} I was a fighter, but because I was a thinker, that I was enraged by the motion-wastage of the loom-rooms and was persecuted by the guards into {{becoming}} an [...] "incorrigible." [...] One's brain worked and I was punished for its working. <b>As</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> Warden Atherton, when my incorrigibility had become so notorious that he had me in on the carpet in his private office to plead with me; <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>told</b> him then: ...|$|E
60|$|Except that I {{made the}} best instead of the worst of it, <b>I</b> <b>told</b> her what had {{happened}} under my window <b>as</b> plainly <b>as</b> <b>I</b> have <b>told</b> it here. She put down the knife that she was cleaning, and folded her hands before her, thinking.|$|R
