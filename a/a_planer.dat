2500|$|Bristol and Providence {{were both}} fitted with massive 110-inch-cylinder (9 foot 2inch), 12-foot stroke walking beam engines, the largest engines ever fitted to American vessels {{up to that}} time - larger even than the 100-inch-cylinder engines for the mammoth ironclad [...] built at the Webb {{shipyard}} around the same time. The steamboats' engines, which operated at the stately pace of 19 rpm, were designed by Erasmus W.

2500|$|Having secured these contracts, Roach {{set about}} {{equipping}} the Etna Iron Works {{for its new}} role. He began by hiring Thomas Main, a leading engineer with experience {{in a number of}} the world's most advanced engine works, as the plant's superintendent. Roach then began reorganizing the Works, adding a boilershop, machine shop, coppersmith shop and blacksmith, and equipping the plant with a host of new machines including traveling and swing cranes and the steam engines to power them, along with planers, lathes, boring mills, punches, shears and rollers. Amongst the new equipment was <b>a</b> <b>planer</b> capable of finishing 100-ton iron plates, and a lathe capable of boring a [...] cylinder—the two largest machine tools in the entire country.|$|E
50|$|In mathematics, <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> {{curve is}} <b>a</b> curve in <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> {{that may be}} either <b>a</b> Euclidean <b>plane,</b> <b>an</b> affine <b>plane</b> or <b>a</b> {{projective}} <b>plane.</b> The most frequently studied cases are smooth plane curves (including piecewise smooth plane curves), and algebraic plane curves.|$|R
5000|$|A related {{concept is}} that of <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> section, which is the curve of {{intersection}} of <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> with <b>a</b> surface. Thus, <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> section is the boundary of a cross-section of a solid in <b>a</b> cutting <b>plane.</b>|$|R
50|$|In geometry, <b>a</b> {{transversal}} <b>plane</b> is <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> that intersects (not contains) {{two or more}} {{lines or}} <b>planes.</b> <b>A</b> transversal <b>plane</b> may also form dihedral angles.|$|R
2500|$|Cryopreservation {{in humans}} {{with regards to}} {{infertility}} involves preservation of embryos, sperm, or oocytes via freezing. [...] Conception, in vitro, is attempted when the sperm is thawed and introduced to the 'fresh' eggs, the frozen eggs are thawed and sperm is placed with the eggs and together they are placed back into the uterus or a frozen embryo is introduced to the uterus. [...] Vitrification has flaws and is not as reliable or proven as freezing fertilized sperm, eggs, or embryos as traditional slow freezing methods because eggs alone are extremely sensitive to temperature. [...] Many researchers are also freezing ovarian tissue {{in conjunction with the}} eggs in hopes that the ovarian tissue can be transplanted back into the uterus, stimulating normal ovulation cycles. In 2004, Donnez of Louvain in Belgium reported the first successful ovarian birth from frozen ovarian tissue. In 1997, samples of ovarian cortex were taken from a woman with Hodgkin’s lymphoma and cryopreserved in <b>a</b> (<b>Planer,</b> UK) controlled-rate freezer and then stored in liquid nitrogen. Chemotherapy was initiated [...] after the patient had premature ovarian failure. In 2003, after freeze-thawing, orthotopic autotransplantation of ovarian cortical tissue was done by laparoscopy and after five months, reimplantation signs indicated recovery of regular ovulatory cycles. Eleven months after reimplantation, a viable intrauterine pregnancy was confirmed, which resulted in the first such live birth – a girl named Tamara.|$|E
5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>planer</b> {{is a type}} of {{metalworking}} {{machine tool}} that uses [...] relative motion between the workpiece and a single-point cutting tool to cut the work piece. <b>A</b> <b>planer</b> is similar to a shaper, but larger, and with workpiece moving, whereas in a shaper the cutting tool moves.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the archetypal}} {{toolpath}} of <b>a</b> <b>planer</b> is linear, helical cutting {{can be accomplished}} by coupling the table's linear motion to simultaneous rotation. The helical planing idea is similar to both helical milling and single-point screw cutting.|$|E

50|$|Drum sander: A large sander {{that uses}} a {{rotating}} sanding drum. As with <b>a</b> <b>planer,</b> the operator adjusts feed rollers to feed the wood into the machine. The sander smooths it and sends it out the other side. Good for finishing large surfaces.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} product came in 1874 with William's {{invention of}} the first bevel gear planer, <b>a</b> <b>planer</b> with integral indexing head designed to specialize in planing bevel gears. Planers and indexing heads had been combined before, but never in the winning form factor that William created specifically for gears.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} {{used for}} this process is known as <b>a</b> <b>planer.</b> The size of the planer {{is determined by the}} largest workpiece that can be machined on it.

40|$|When we {{consider}} an embedding of graphs into <b>a</b> <b>plane,</b> {{it would be}} nice if it does not intersect internally since the embedding simply shows us the structure of graphs. It is easy to embed a tree into <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> with non-self-intersections. If we embed two or more trees into <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> with non-self-intersections, what occurs? In this paper, {{we consider}} embeddings of two trees into <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> with using same vertices, sharing no edges and no-intersections. We prove that a non-star tree and a non-star caterpillar can be embedded into <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> satisfying the above conditions. It is one of the special cases of a conjecture by Garcia et al.

50|$|Wide-belt sander: A large sander {{similar in}} concept to <b>a</b> <b>planer,</b> but much larger.

Used mainly for manufacturing furniture and cabinets.|$|E
50|$|A {{gear shaper}} is a machine tool for cutting {{the teeth of}} {{internal}} or external gears. The name shaper relates {{to the fact that}} the cutter engages the part on the forward stroke and pulls away from the part on the return stroke, just like the clapper box on <b>a</b> <b>planer</b> shaper.|$|E
5000|$|It is even {{possible}} to do work that might now be done by wire EDM in some cases.

40|$|We {{propose the}} Wearable Virtual Tablet(WV), where a user can draw a locus {{on a common}} object with <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> surface (e. g., a {{notebook}} and a magazine) with a fingertip. Our pre ious WV T[1], howe er, could not work on <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> surface with complicated texture patterns: Since our WV employs an acti e-infrared camera and the reflected infrared rays ary depending on patterns on <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> surface, it is di#cult to estimate the motions of a fingertip and <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> surface from <b>an</b> obser ed infrared-image. In this paper, we propose a method to detect and track their motions without interference from colored patterns on <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> surface. (1) To find the region of <b>a</b> <b>plane</b> object in the obser ed image, four edge lines that compose a rectangular object can be easily extracted by employing the properties of an acti einfrared camera. (2) To precisely determine {{the position of a}} fingertip, we utilize a simple finger model that corresponds to a finger edge independent of its posture.
