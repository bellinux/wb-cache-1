40|$|We {{present a}} {{collection}} of results on (weak) m-extremals and m-geodesics, concerning general properties, the planar case, quasi-balanced pseudoconvex domains, complex ellipsoids, the Euclidean ball and boundary properties.

Equivalence of weak m-extremality and m-extremality in some class of convex complex ellipsoids, containing symmetric ones and C^ 2 -smooth ones is showed. Moreover, first examples of 3 -extremals being not 3 -geodesics in convex domains are given. Comment: 25 pages.
