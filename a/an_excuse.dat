5|$|During the 1830s, the Mexican {{government}} wavered between federalist and centralist policies. As {{the pendulum}} swung sharply towards centralism in 1835, several Mexican states revolted. In June, {{a small group}} of settlers in Texas used the political unrest as <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> to rebel against customs duties, in an incident known as the Anahuac Disturbances. The federal government responded by sending more troops to Texas.|$|E
5|$|In {{a dispute}} {{over the use of}} the forces {{defending}} the Harpers Ferry garrison, Hooker offered his resignation, and Abraham Lincoln and General-in-Chief Henry W.

George Gordon Meade, then commander of the V Corps.|$|E
5|$|In {{early morning}} of August 25, Lithuanians counterattacked and recaptured Sejny. Polish sources claim that Lithuanians there were {{aided by a}} company of Germans volunteers, but Lithuanian sources assert that it was <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> used by Rudnicki to explain his defeat. The Lithuanian forces {{recovered}} some important documents and property, freed Lithuanian prisoners and, according to Mańczuk, executed several of the PMO fighters they found wounded.|$|E

5|$|Anticipating high sales, Nintendo set {{its first}} {{production}} shipment {{for the games}} in Japan at three million, predicting that eventually more than eight million copies would be sold in the country alone. However, they were soon forced to cut the first shipment number in half following an earthquake in Taiwan, which Nintendo claimed had damaged their cartridge manufacturing facilities. Regardless, speculation arose that Nintendo was instead using the event as <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> to limit shipment and keep the demand high.|$|E
5|$|David {{challenges}} Elijah with {{an incident}} {{from his childhood}} when he almost drowned. Elijah suggests that the incident highlights the common comic trope whereby superheroes often have one weakness; he contends David's might be water. While surveying the stored wreckage of the train crash that he survived, David recalls the car accident that ended his athletics career, remembering that he was unharmed and ripped a door off the car {{in order to save}} Audrey. David used the accident as <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> to quit football because Audrey did not like the violence of the sport.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{was known}} for his public demonstrations of piety, and appears to have been {{genuinely}} devout. He promoted rich, luxurious Church services, and, unusually for the period, attended mass at least once a day. He gave generously to religious causes, paid for the feeding of 500 paupers each day and helped orphans. He fasted before commemorating Edward the Confessor's feasts, and may have washed the feet of lepers. Henry regularly went on pilgrimages, particularly to the abbeys of Bromholm, St Albans and Walsingham Priory, although he appears to have sometimes used pilgrimages as <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> to avoid dealing with pressing political problems.|$|E

5000|$|There are two {{categories}} of affirmative defenses: justification and excuse. Justifications differ from <b>excuses</b> in that <b>a</b> successful justification will show the defendant's conduct was not wrong, whereas <b>a</b> successful <b>excuse</b> does not show the defendant's conduct was wrong. <b>A</b> successful <b>excuse</b> shows that, while the defendant's conduct was regrettable, this particular defendant will {{not be subject to}} punishment.|$|R
5|$|In 1017, Maymandi and Mahmud {{agreed to}} invade Khwarazm, then under native Iranian Ma'munid dynasty. According to Ghaznavid sources, {{the reason for}} Mahmud's {{invasion}} of the region was to avenge {{the murder of his}} brother-in-law Ma'mun II, but according to modern sources he used the latter's death as <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> to expand Ghaznavid rule over the Oxus River. In the same year, the Ghaznavid army deposed the Ma'munid ruler Abu'l-Harith Muhammad, and Altun Tash was appointed as the governor of the region.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the presiding magistrate, several additional magistrates were often present to act as assistants. There were also religious officials known as augurs either in attendance or on-call, who {{would be available to}} help interpret any signs from the gods (omens). On several known occasions, presiding magistrates used the claim of unfavorable omens as <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> to suspend a session that was not going the way they wanted. Any decision made by a presiding magistrate could be vetoed by a magistrate known as a Plebeian Tribune. In addition, decisions made by presiding magistrates could also be vetoed by higher-ranking magistrates.|$|E
5|$|Officers in {{the field}} {{were well aware of}} the killing {{operations}} being conducted by the Einsatzgruppen. The Wehrmacht tried to justify their considerable involvement in the Einsatzgruppen massacres as being anti-partisan operations rather than racist attacks, but Hillgruber wrote that this was just <b>an</b> <b>excuse.</b> He states that those German generals who claimed that the Einsatzgruppen were a necessary anti-partisan response were lying, and maintained that the slaughter of about 2.2 million defenceless civilians for reasons of racist ideology cannot be justified.|$|E

5|$|On 26 November, the Soviets staged the {{shelling}} of Mainila, {{an incident in}} which Soviet artillery shelled area near the Russian village of Mainila and then announced that a Finnish artillery attack had killed Soviet soldiers. The Soviet Union demanded that the Finns apologize for the incident and move their forces 20–25 kilometres from the border. The Finns denied any responsibility for the attack and rejected the demands, calling for a joint Finnish-Soviet commission to examine the incident. The Soviet Union claimed that the Finnish response was hostile, and used it as <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> {{to withdraw from the}} non-aggression pact.|$|E
5|$|On 3 June 1944, Braun's sister Gretl Braun married SS-Gruppenführer Hermann Fegelein, {{who served}} as Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler's liaison officer on Hitler's staff. Hitler used the {{marriage}} as <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> to allow Braun to appear at official functions, as she could then be introduced as Fegelein's sister-in-law. When Fegelein {{was caught in the}} closing days of the war trying to escape to Sweden or Switzerland, Hitler ordered his execution. He was shot for desertion in the garden of the Reich Chancellery on 28 April 1945.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year, the War of the Quadruple Alliance broke out, aligning Spain against France, England, the Dutch Republic, and Austria. The war {{was fought}} primarily over Italy, but England and France used {{the war as}} <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> to attempt to take over Spanish interests in North America. In June 1719, 7Frenchmen from Natchitoches took control of Mission San Miguel de los Adaes from its sole defender, {{who did not know}} that the countries were at war. The French soldiers explained that 100 additional soldiers were coming, and the Spanish colonists, missionaries, and remaining soldiers abandoned the area and fled to San Antonio.|$|E

Principal Skinner is impressed with Bart's efforts and welcomes him back to the school, but then realizes in horror that the bullies are still in the utility basement. While the bullies are spending the time talking about their feelings, Principal Skinner and Willie race to the school with the mountain bikes to avoid a potential lawsuit.|$|E
5|$|The two-year truce was now {{close to}} expiry and the Lombards asked the Byzantines {{to respect the}} {{alliance}} which had been established between them. The Emperor found <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> to break the new alliance with the Gepids by claiming they had again ferried Slav raiders. He put together an army with renowned commanders in its ranks such as Germanus' sons Justin and Justinian, Aratius, the Herulian Suartuas, and Amalafrid, brother-in-law of Audoin. A revolt that erupted in Ulpiana diverted {{the bulk of the}} army; only a force under Amalafrid reached the battlefield.|$|E

5|$|When Hitler {{asked for}} a pretext for the {{invasion}} of Poland in 1939, Himmler, Heydrich, and Heinrich Müller masterminded a false flag plan code-named Operation Himmler.

Wearing Polish uniforms, 150 German troops carried out several attacks along the border. Hitler used the ruse as <b>an</b> <b>excuse</b> to launch his invasion.|$|E
