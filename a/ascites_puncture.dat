40|$|A 41 -year-old CAPD patient {{developed}} Grey-Turner's sign {{during the}} course of bacterial peritonitis due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. At the same time a diagnosis of sclerosing peritonitis was made by CT-scanning of the abdomen. We think that Grey-Turner's flank staining could either have been caused by synthesis of proteases by the Pseudomonas bacteria or by reduced mesenteric flexibility and increased vascularization of the peritoneum due to the sclerosing peritonitis. This could have led to spontaneous mesenteric bleeding with leakage to the retroperitoneal tissues. A possible relationship with an <b>ascites</b> <b>puncture</b> is less likel...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Treatment with tumour {{necrosis}} factor-a inhibitors {{increases the}} risk of tuberculosis (TB). Screening for latent TB infection (LTBI) and prophylactic treatment has become mandatory. A 79 -yr-old female with a history of severe erosive sero-positive rheumatoid arthritis was screened for LTBI before initiation of treatment with infliximab. The tuberculin skin test (TST) was negative, chest radiography was normal and she had no known risk factors for TB. After 4 months of treatment with infliximab, the patient developed ascites caused by Mycobacterium bovis. The TST was repeatedly negative. QuantiFERON 1 -TB (QFT) testing performed during screening and immunosuppressive treatment was indeterminate, whereas the QFT test performed at the time of <b>ascites</b> <b>puncture</b> was positive. The patient history revealed previous work at a dairy, with probable exposure to unpasteurised milk from M. bovis-infected cattle. Re-activation of bovine tuberculosis is a risk in people with recent or previous exposure to unpasteurised dairy products. The QuantiFERON 1 -TB test has the potential to detect Mycobacterium bovis infection. Indeterminate test results reflect either anergy, due to poor immunity, or technical problems and should be cautiously interpreted and as a minimum be repeated. Studies are ongoing to determine the role of QuantiFERON 1 -TB testing in the screening for latent tuberculosis infection...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionThe ovarian {{hyperstimulation}} syndrome (OHSS), although uncommon, is {{an important}} complication of assisted reproduction because of its morbidity and possible lethal outcome. ObjectiveTo verify the incidence of OHSS in public service of assisted reproduction and review the literature. MethodA descriptive retrospective study of patients enrolled in the Assisted Reproduction Laboratory of Hospital Pérola Byington who had 15 or more oocytes retrieved during controlled ovarian stimulation cycle, period 2010 - 2012. A literature search was conducted in the databases Medline, Scopus and SciELO including articles indexed between 2010 and 2013. ResultsOHSS was observed in 17 cycles (1. 9 %) of 857 performed. The mean age was 33. 2 years, {{with a mean of}} 21. 6 oocytes retrieved and 11. 5 mature oocytes. Hospitalization and <b>ascites</b> <b>puncture</b> was required in five cases. There was no fatal outcome. The literature suggests that methods used to predict the ovarian response help to prevent OHSS, as antral follicle count, serum estradiol and anti-mullerian hormone. Evidence indicates that stimulation with GnRH antagonist and triggering with GnRH agonist, with or without vitrification of embryos are safe strategies for patients with high risk for OHSS. ConclusionThe incidence of OHSS was found to be within the range of literature. Although none of the approaches for the prevention of OHSS is fully effective, the majority demonstrates a decreasing incidence in high-risk patients...|$|E
50|$|The usual {{treatment}} of malignant <b>ascites</b> is to <b>puncture</b> the peritoneum {{to let the}} accumulated fluid drain out. After the puncture, catumaxomab is given as an intraperitoneal infusion. The procedure is repeated four times within about eleven days. It {{has been shown that}} puncture free survival can be increased from 11 to 46 days with this treatment.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Management of {{established}} severe OHSS requires prolonged hospitalization, occasionally {{in intensive care}} units, accompanied by multiple <b>ascites</b> <b>punctures,</b> correction of intravascular fluid volume and electrolyte imbalance. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate whether it is feasible to manage women with severe OHSS as outpatients by treating them with GnRH antagonists in the luteal phase. Methods This is a single-centre, prospective, observational, cohort study. Forty patients diagnosed with severe OHSS, five days post oocyte retrieval, were managed as outpatients after administration of GnRH antagonist (0. 25 [*]mg) daily from days 5 to 8 post oocyte retrieval, combined with cryopreservation of all embryos. The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients with severe OHSS, in whom outpatient management was not feasible. Results 11. 3 % (95 % CI 8. 3 %- 15. 0 %) of patients (40 / 353) developed severe early OHSS. None of the 40 patients required hospitalization following luteal antagonist administration and embryo cryopreservation. Ovarian volume, ascites, hematocrit, WBC, serum oestradiol and progesterone decreased significantly (P[*] Conclusions The current study suggests, for the first time, that successful outpatient management of severe OHSS with antagonist treatment in the luteal phase is feasible and is associated with rapid regression of the syndrome, challenging the dogma of inpatient management. The proposed management is a flexible approach that minimizes unnecessary embryo transfer cancellations in the majority (88. 7 %) of high risk for OHSS patients. </p...|$|R
40|$|Retroperitoneal lymphocele is {{a common}} {{complication}} of renal transplantation. Here, we report {{the case of a}} 67 -year-old woman with massive ascites after fenestration surgery for a lymphocele that developed following renal transplantation. She had been on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis for 9 years. Living donor renal transplantation was performed and an intrapelvic lymphocele subsequently developed. The lymphocele did not resolve after aspiration therapy; therefore, laparoscopic fenestration was performed. Although the lymphocele disappeared, massive ascites appeared in its stead. Half a year later, the <b>ascites</b> was surgically <b>punctured,</b> which then gradually resolved and disappeared 6 weeks later. Aspiration therapy should be considered in patients on long-term peritoneal dialysis, although laparoscopic fenestration is safe and effective...|$|R
40|$|In {{some cases}} the {{diagnosis}} of gastric cancer is difficult and the endoscopic presentation may be misleading. Diffuse type gastric carcinoma with peritoneal metastasis may present primarily with abdominal pain, colonic infiltration and/or diarrhea, thus other differential diagnoses like Crohn’s disease (CD) may be considered at first. Therefore intensive diagnostic work-up is important. We report two cases of gastric cancer with ascites due to peritoneal carcinomatosis who were first diagnosed as CD. The patients were hospitalized in different institutions for weight loss, abdominal pain and nausea. The first colonoscopy, upper endoscopy with multiple biopsies and <b>ascites</b> <b>puncture</b> were negative for malignant disease, but macroscopic lesions resembling CD were described. Both patients were released on a prednisolone-based treatment for suspected CD. They presented to our hospital for further evaluation due to persistent symptoms. Neither lower nor upper endoscopy were suggestive of CD and endoscopic ultrasound was suspicious of malignancy in one case. Histology was diagnostic and showed gastric infiltration by a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma. Diffuse type gastric cancer (gastric linitis plastica) with peritoneal metastasis may mimic certain clinical, endoscopic and CT imaging features of CD. Repeated biopsies and endoscopic investigations are often necessary to confirm a malignant process, especially {{in case of an}} inconclusive clinical and endoscopic picture. Endoscopic ultrasound may be useful to evaluate the risk of malignancy in patients with macroscopic suspicion of malignancy and negative biopsies...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND; AIMS: Complications and {{technical}} problems of paracentesis in cirrhotic patients are infrequent. However, the severity and {{the incidence of}} these events and their risk factors have not been assessed prospectively. METHODS: Cirrhotic patients (n = 171) undergoing paracentesis were included. Of the 515 paracenteses, 8. 8 % were diagnostic, and 91. 2 % were therapeutic. Technical features, demographic data, and adverse events {{during a period of}} 72 hours after the procedure were examined. RESULTS: Major complications occurred in 1. 6 % of procedures and included 5 bleedings and 3 infections, resulting in death in 2 cases. Major complications were associated with therapeutic but not diagnostic procedures and tended to be more prevalent in patients with low platelet count (< 50 10 (9) /L), Child-Pugh stage C, and in alcoholic cirrhosis patients. Technical problems occurred in 5. 6 %. The most frequent complication was a leak of <b>ascites</b> at the <b>puncture</b> site (5. 0 %), and in 89. 5 % there were no complications. CONCLUSIONS: The safety of paracentesis in cirrhotic patients might be decreased if risk factors, which depend on the characteristics of the patient and of the procedure itself, are present...|$|R
