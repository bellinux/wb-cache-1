5|$|The {{colourful}} Buhl altarpiece is {{the work}} of a group of followers of Martin Schongauer, who drew their inspiration both from his woodcuts and from his paintings, especially the Altarpiece of the Dominicans, now kept in the Unterlinden Museum. The Buhl painters closely followed their model's designs, but on a larger scale and in a simpler and technically cruder manner. While it is not documented that the altarpiece was commissioned by the convent of Saint Catherine, the closeness to the designs of Schongauer but also, to a lesser degree, of Caspar Isenmann (the panel depicting the Flagellation of Christ is reminding of the same scene in the altarpiece of St Martin's Church) indicate without <b>a</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> it has been painted in Colmar; furthermore, both Saint Catherine and Saint Ursula, who figure prominently in the Crucifixion scene, were particularly venerated by the Dominican sisters of Saint Catherine.|$|E
5|$|The {{first of}} the Cavalry uniforms {{were made by the}} cavalrymen themselves. By 1862, the Confederate {{regulations}} ordered the uniform to become organized, being cadet gray and lined with a thin layer around the sleeve. The pant legs were light blue with a yellow strip rising {{from the bottom of the}} leg to the top. Non-commissioned officers of the cavalry wore either regular clothes from home or a variety of different types of uniforms. yellow was the prescribed branch of service color, but surviving uniforms show beyond <b>a</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> the vast majority of cavalrymen who used any branch of service color, used buff as yellow cloth was virtually non existent in the Confederacy.|$|E
5|$|As Stauffenberg flies back to Berlin, Olbricht {{refuses to}} {{mobilize}} the Reserve Army until he knows without <b>a</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> Hitler is dead (if Hitler isn't dead, Olbricht will be arrested for having the reserve army mobilized without Fromm's permission). Behind Olbricht's back, Mertz forges his signature and issues the orders anyway. With Operation Valkyrie underway, Stauffenberg and his fellow plotters order the arrest of Nazi party leaders and SS officers, convincing lower officers that the Party and the SS are staging a coup. As Army soldiers begin {{to take control of}} Berlin's government ministries, including SS headquarters, mid-level officers relaying the orders begin to wonder which side they should be fighting for. Rumors reach Berlin that Hitler survived the blast, but Stauffenberg dismisses them as SS propaganda. Meanwhile, Fromm learns from Field Marshal Keitel that Hitler is still alive. The General refuses to join the plotters, resulting in them detaining him. Major Otto Ernst Remer of the Reserve Army prepares to arrest Goebbels, but is stopped when Goebbels connects him by phone to Hitler.|$|E

50|$|In {{answer to}} these questions, {{the court held}} that it was not {{satisfied}} that the State had passed the first hurdle: It had failed to prove, beyond <b>a</b> reasonable <b>doubt,</b> <b>that</b> Arnold’s conduct was voluntary. Even if it had, though, the court was not satisfied that the State had proved beyond <b>a</b> reasonable <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> Arnold had criminal capacity at the relevant time. He was therefore acquitted.|$|R

25|$|Stapp's {{research}} on the decelerator had profound implications for both civilian and military aviation. For instance, the backward-facing seat concept, which was known before, was given great impetus by the officer's crash research program. It proved beyond <b>a</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> this position was the safest for aircraft passengers and required little harness support. Also, that a human can withstand much greater deceleration than in the forward position. As a result, many Military Air Transport Service (MATS) aircraft in USAF and carrier on-board delivery aircraft in USN were equipped or retrofitted {{with this type of}} seat. Commercial airlines were made aware of these findings, but still use forward-facing seats. The British Royal Air Force also installed it on many of their military transport aircraft.|$|E

It was obvious from the stand as soon as Ella {{received}} the ball that, provided Campese and Steve Tuynman could exchange passes out on the left, a try was on... Ella gave Campese room and Tuynman hung about waiting to play his part. Campese drew the last serious defender to him, flicked the ball to Tuynman and moved into place for the return. It worked like a dream and there was Campese with half the pitch to run and only John Beattie near him. Beattie did well to stay the same three metres behind Campese as they hurtled down the touchline, {{but there was never}} <b>a</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> Campese would score...Campese's effort won the try-of-the-tour award from the brewers.|$|E
25|$|In true Robin and Patrick fashion, they cannot get on {{the same}} page - just when Robin realizes she does want to marry him, Patrick has finally {{accepted}} the fact that she does not. Mac arrests Patrick and locks the two of them in the PCPD interrogation Room, forcing them to talk. Patrick proposes again and Robin finally says yes. They decide to marry before their daughter is born, and their wedding is set for October 29, 2008. Patrick, thinking he has {{all the time in the}} world, decides to go into the hospital to do last minute rounds. He cuts it close, but signs out on time. However, just as he is about to leave, Anthony Zacchara (Bruce Weitz) is brought in with a stroke and needs emergency surgery. Matt (Jason Cook), Patrick's newly found half brother who's also a neurosurgeon, offers to perform it, but Patrick is afraid that should something go wrong the Zaccharas would go after his brother. Meanwhile, back at the church, everyone waits for Patrick's arrival impatiently and believing that he has a case of cold feet and has left his fiancee at the altar. Robin is the only one who had no fears and no doubts and is certain beyond a shadow of <b>a</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> Patrick will be there. Patrick comes running in after a successful surgery and apologizes for his lateness, but Robin is cool-headed; she knew he would be there. Mac walks her down the aisle, as her father Robert is still getting treatment for his cancer overseas.|$|E

500|$|King Mieszko II died in 1034; {{his son and}} heir, Casimir {{was forced}} to leave Poland. A period of anarchy followed, which lasted at least until 1039 when Casimir returned. According to Kristó and Makk, Béla was staying in Poland during this period; he even may have {{administered}} the kingdom in the name of his absent brother-in-law. On the other hand, the Polish historian, Manteuffel writes that Béla and his two brothers, in contrast with the unanimous report of the Hungarian chronicles, arrived in Poland only with Casimir, after 1039. It is beyond <b>a</b> <b>doubt</b> <b>that</b> Levente and Andrew departed from Poland in about 1038, becauseaccording to the Illuminated Chroniclethey did not want to [...] "live the life of hangers-on in the Duke of Poland's court, regarded only as Béla's brothers".|$|E

2500|$|Another {{perspective}} in culture literature asserts {{that in order}} for an organization to perform at a high level {{over a long period of}} time, it must be able to adapt to changes in the environment. According to Ralph Kilmann, in such a culture [...] "there is a shared feeling of confidence: the members believe, without <b>a</b> <b>doubt,</b> <b>that</b> they can effectively manage whatever new problems and opportunities will come their way." [...] In effect, the culture is infused with a high degree of self-efficacy and confidence. As with the strong culture, critics point to the fact that the theory provides nothing in the way of appropriate direction of adaptation that leads to high performance.|$|E

The ramifications of the hall are best stated by William Hecht '61, {{executive vice president of the}} Association of Alumni and Alumnae of MIT when he said, [...] "the visible presence of women at MIT helped open up the science and engineering professions to a large part of the population that before had been excluded.

Terry maintained that he used the words as a form of sarcasm and that he was questioning what he thought had been an allegation of racism from Ferdinand; neither lip reader was able to [...] "identify whether the statement was made as a question or in what type of voice it was said."
