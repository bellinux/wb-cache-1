5|$|The Australian magpie {{is found}} in the Trans-Fly region of {{southern}} New Guinea, between the Oriomo River and the Princess Mariane Strait, and across most of Australia, bar the tip of Cape York, the Gibson and Great Sandy Deserts, and southwest of Tasmania. Birds taken mainly from Tasmania and Victoria were introduced into New Zealand by local <b>Acclimatisation</b> Societies of Otago and Canterbury in the 1860s, with the Wellington <b>Acclimatisation</b> Society releasing 260 birds in 1874. White-backed forms are spread on both the North and eastern South Island, while black-backed forms are found in the Hawke's Bay region. Magpies were introduced into New Zealand to control agricultural pests, and were therefore a protected species until 1951. They are thought to affect native New Zealand bird populations such as the tui and kererū, sometimes raiding nests for eggs and nestlings, although studies by Waikato University have cast doubt on this, and much blame on the magpie as a predator in the past has been anecdotal only. Introductions also occurred in the Solomon Islands and Sri Lanka, although the species has failed to become established. It has become established in western Taveuni in Fiji, however.|$|E
5|$|The first {{botanical gardens}} in Australia were founded {{early in the}} 19th century. The Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney, 1816; the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens, 1818; the Royal Botanic Gardens, Melbourne, 1845; Adelaide Botanic Gardens, 1854; and Brisbane Botanic Gardens, 1855. These were {{established}} essentially as colonial gardens of economic botany and <b>acclimatisation.</b> The Auburn Botanical Gardens, 1977, located in Sydney's western suburbs, {{are one of the}} popular and diverse botanical gardens in the Greater Western Sydney area.|$|E
5|$|Yellowhammers of the British and Irish race, E. c. caliginosa were {{introduced}} to New Zealand by local <b>acclimatisation</b> societies in 1862, and soon spread over the main islands. They sometimes visit New Zealand's subantarctic islands, although rarely staying to breed, and have reached Australia's Lord Howe Island {{on a number of}} occasions. At the beginning of the 20th century, this bunting was seen as a serious agricultural pest in its adopted country.|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} {{predation}} by invasive mammalian species including ship rats, cats, and mustelids was an additional {{factor in the}} decline in huia numbers – introduction of these animals by New Zealand <b>acclimatisation</b> societies peaked in the 1880s and coincided with a particularly sharp decline in huia populations. Because it {{spent a lot of}} time on the ground, the huia would have been particularly vulnerable to mammalian predators. Another hypothetical cause of extinction is exotic parasites and disease introduced from Asia with the common myna.|$|E
5|$|The early {{settlers}} in New Zealand cleared {{the bush and}} found their newly planted crops were invaded by hordes of caterpillars and other insects deprived of their previous food sources. Native birds were not habituated to living {{in close proximity to}} man so the common starling was introduced from Europe along with the House Sparrow to control the pests. It was first brought over in 1862 by the Nelson <b>Acclimatisation</b> Society and other introductions followed. The birds soon became established and are now found all over the country including the subtropical Kermadec Islands to the north and the equally distant Macquarie Island far to the south.|$|E
5|$|Birds of the {{nominate}} subspecies {{were introduced}} to New Zealand and Australia by <b>acclimatisation</b> societies between 1860 and 1880, apparently for purely sentimental reasons. In New Zealand, where it was introduced on both the main islands, the song thrush quickly established itself and spread to surrounding islands such as the Kermadecs, Chatham and Auckland Islands. Although it is common and widespread in New Zealand, in Australia only a small population survives around Melbourne. In New Zealand, {{there appears to be}} a limited detrimental effect on some invertebrates due to predation by introduced bird species, and the song thrush also damages commercial fruit crops in that country. As an introduced species it has no legal protection in New Zealand, and can be killed at any time.|$|E
5|$|On 10October1945, {{the brigade}} {{arrived at the}} port of Haifa, and after {{disembarking}} moved to Gaza. After a short period of <b>acclimatisation,</b> the 6th Airlanding Brigade was deployed in the Samaria region, with the brigade headquarters at Lydda airfield. At the same time, the 6th Battalion, Gordon Highlanders, based at Tulkarm, came under the brigade's command. The first incident in the brigade area was on 31 October, when parties of armed Jews planted explosives on rail lines, which killed four and wounded eight when they exploded. Following attacks on coastguard stations, believed to be by members of the Palmach, over the night of 24/25November, the brigade carried out two operations to search settlements for those responsible. On 29March1946 the brigade was relocated to Jerusalem in preparation for leaving the division. On 3April the 1st Parachute Brigade, which had been assigned to the division, arrived in Palestine. Their arrival made the glider formation surplus to requirements, so on 15April the brigade was renumbered 31st Independent Infantry Brigade, and was no longer part of the British airborne forces.|$|E
5|$|On 30 March 1916, as the AIF's {{infantry}} divisions {{were transferred}} to Europe, the battalion sailed from Alexandria aboard the HMT Corsican. It arrived at Marseilles, France, on 5 April and then moved by train to Flêtre where it was billeted until the 19th when it moved to Sailly, where it commemorated Anzac Day on 25 April. In mid-May, {{after a period of}} <b>acclimatisation</b> and training to prepare them for the European battlefield, the 11th Battalion moved up to the front line around Petillon in the Fleurbaix sector, with a strength of 27 officers and 929 other ranks. A further draft of reinforcements, totalling 69 men all ranks, arrived on 25 May, and on 30 May the battalion had its first experience of combat on the Western Front. Late that evening, German artillery bombarded the Allied line around the Cordonnerie salient, before infantry launched a raid on the 11th Battalion's trenches. In the fighting that followed the 11th Battalion lost four men captured, 37 killed and 70 wounded.|$|E
5|$|The common {{starling}} {{was introduced}} to Australia to consume insect pests of farm crops. Early settlers looked forward to their arrival, believing that common starlings were also important for the pollination of flax, a major agricultural product. Nest-boxes for the newly released birds were placed on farms and near crops. The common starling {{was introduced to}} Melbourne in 1857 and Sydney two decades later. By the 1880s, established populations {{were present in the}} southeast of the country thanks to the work of <b>acclimatisation</b> committees. By the 1920s, common starlings were widespread throughout Victoria, Queensland and New South Wales, but by then they were considered to be pests. Although common starlings were first sighted in Albany, Western Australia in 1917, they have been largely prevented from spreading to the state. The wide and arid Nullarbor Plain provides a natural barrier and control measures have been adopted that have killed 55,000 birds over three decades. The common starling has also colonised Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island.|$|E
5|$|In early February, <b>acclimatisation</b> {{training}} was conducted until the battalion's heavy equipment arrived in camp, including Bren carriers and trucks, when section level and platoon tactical training began. This increased in complexity and progressed to company-level exercises, culminating in battalion offensive manoeuvres. Leave was granted {{for the soldiers}} to visit Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. This ceased mid-March, when the battalion was ordered to cross the Suez Canal and take up positions west of the port of Tobruk to complete training prior to relieving the 6th Division in the desert. As British troops advanced west, pushing the Italians back through Libya during Operation Compass, plans were made for the 9th Division to move forward. In the end, {{only part of the}} division advanced past Tobruk and, due to lack of transport, the 24th Brigade garrisoned the port itself. In early April the advance turned into a withdrawal as Axis forces, bolstered by the arrival of the Afrika Korps, which had landed around Tripoli, launched a determined counter-attack. The 9th Division, along with the Australian 18th Brigade, from the 7th Division, withdrew intact to Tobruk, and within a week the advancing Axis forces had placed the strategic port under siege. The 2/43rd would remain there, manning defences, mounting patrols and conducting raids, for the next six months.|$|E

25|$|<b>Acclimatisation</b> is {{essential}} when climbing without oxygen to avoid {{some degree of}} altitude sickness.|$|E
25|$|The {{alliance}} with the <b>Acclimatisation</b> Society {{was considered to be}} a sensible arrangement. There were common interests, the site was well supplied with water and convenient to the city and it was thought at the time that many women and townspeople, who might have hesitated in visiting a purely utilitarian exhibition of produce, animals and farm machinery, may have been induced by the additional attraction of the <b>Acclimatisation</b> Society Gardens.|$|E
25|$|Several {{companies}} offer hiking, trekking, and camping in the Western Ghats {{region of the}} city. Jimmy George Sports hub includes Astra, the first altitude-simulated training facility in South India, which enables high altitude <b>acclimatisation.</b>|$|E
25|$|After 10days of <b>acclimatisation</b> at her team's base in Thailand, Wellington won Ironman Korea, in {{very hot}} conditions, {{finishing}} over 50minutes ahead of 2nd placed Yasuko Miyazaki, in 7th place overall. By winning this race, {{she earned a}} slot to race at the Ironman world championships in Hawaii.|$|E
25|$|This {{syndicate}} imported 18 Brahman cattle {{selected by}} Dr Kelley and shipped in 1933. The cattle, which averaged two years old, {{were sent to}} Wright's property, Waverley station, for <b>acclimatisation</b> and inoculation before being divided among the syndicate members {{for use in the}} CSIR breeding trials.|$|E
25|$|In 1887 {{the first}} {{exhibition}} building {{was destroyed by}} fire. The public called {{for it to be}} replaced with a masonry building, but the National Association was reluctant to commit to the necessary expenditure without more secure land tenure, against which they could borrow money for permanent exhibition buildings. In 1888 a temporary timber exhibition building was constructed for approximately £500, while the National Association called for competitive designs for a permanent exhibition building. Under the provisions of the National Association and <b>Acclimatisation</b> Society Act 1890, the land leased from the Queensland <b>Acclimatisation</b> Society for an exhibition ground was resumed and granted to the National Association as Trustees, who were also empowered under this act to borrow money from the Queensland Government to erect the new exhibition building.|$|E
25|$|In 1879, the National Association {{was awarded}} a lease of 23 acres of the 32 acre <b>Acclimatisation</b> Society grounds {{for a period of}} 50 years, for use as an {{exhibition}} ground. In 1881 the railway to Sandgate was constructed through the National Association and <b>Acclimatisation</b> Society grounds creating the Exhibition railway station. The line was later re-routed via Central Station, Brunswick Street (now known as Fortitude Valley railway station) and Bowen Hills railway station, but the Exhibition railway line still opens each year during the August show. By 1882, the Exhibition Grounds comprised all the land south, southeast and east of the railway line and bounded by Bowen Bridge Road, Gregory Terrace, Brookes Street and O'Connell Terrace. A 1000-seat capacity grandstand, designed by FDG Stanley, was erected in 1885 (not the first grandstand on the site). In 1887 a timber residence designed by GHM Addison was constructed at the corner of O'Connell Terrace and Brookes Street for the Secretary of the National Association.|$|E
25|$|After {{a period}} of {{training}} in New South Wales, the brigade embarked for Malaya on 2 February 1941 with Taylor traveling {{in advance of the}} main body by flying boat. He spent time gauging the current training methods in use amongst the British and Indian units already stationed in Malaya. Observing the terrain in which his soldiers may have to fight, he implemented <b>acclimatisation</b> and jungle warfare training for his brigade.|$|E
25|$|It {{appears that}} in {{late nineteenth century}} Queensland the raintree was known by one of its botanical synonyms, an {{alternate}} spelling of Pithecellobium saman. In an August 1879 article in The Queenslander, recounting the minutes {{of the most recent}} meeting of the <b>Acclimatisation</b> Society of Queensland, this species is discussed and a report tabled from the director of the Botanical Gardens in Jamaica, from where seeds had been obtained by the Queensland Colonial Office. The Chairman reported that the tree was known to the Society, which had a few strong plants in stock. Later in the same year it was reported that the chairman had distributed large quantities of seed in the northern districts of the colony. A letter-to-the-editor published in a June 1884 Sydney Morning Herald issue and received from Fred Turner - who worked at the Brisbane Botanic Gardens from 1874, before becoming Curator of the <b>Acclimatisation</b> Society's Bowen Park and then moving to the Sydney Botanic Gardens in 1880 - reveals that the Brisbane Gardens had sometime previously received seeds of the raintree. An article in a December 1932 issue of The Queenslander describes a substantial raintree growing there.|$|E
25|$|Francis Trevelyan Buckland (17 December 1826 – 19 December 1880), {{better known}} as Frank Buckland, was an English surgeon, zoologist, popular author and natural historian. He {{was born in a}} reputed family of naturalists. After a brief career in {{medicine}} he took an interest in fishes and other matters. He was one of the key members and founders of the <b>acclimatisation</b> society in Britain, an organization that supported the introduction of new plants and animals as food sources which was influenced by his interest in eating and tasting a range of exotic animal meats.|$|E
25|$|From late 1877 Hart was {{an active}} member of the Queensland <b>Acclimatisation</b> Society, based in Brisbane, and at Coolshade he {{established}} a fine orchard with European and Mediterranean fruits, Chinese fruits, mangoes, and coconuts using material obtained almost exclusively via the Society. In April 1884 The Brisbane Courier reported on a visit to agricultural properties in the Mossman River district, the foremost of which was Coolshade. In December 1887 the agricultural reporter for The Queenslander newspaper described Hart as an enthusiast in horticulture, and his garden an experimental station. In both articles the extensive range of plants described as growing at the property did not include the raintree.|$|E
25|$|The 60th Division {{was next}} {{transferred}} to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force for the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. The 2/19th left Lake Doiran on 1 June and marched back to Salonika where it embarked on 10 June. After a period of training and <b>acclimatisation</b> in the Canal Zone, the battalion moved {{up to the front}} in July. On 31 October the battalion was with 180th Brigade in divisional reserve for the Battle of Beersheba, but the attack was so successful that it never came into action. On 6 November the 2/19th was one of the attacking battalions that captured the Kauwukah position during the Battle of Hareira and Sheria. The Sheria position remaining untaken, the brigade attacked again the following day, and the 2/19th suffered heavy casualties, the acting commanding officer, Major A.W. Gray, being killed.|$|E
25|$|In New Zealand, {{red deer}} were {{introduced}} by <b>acclimatisation</b> societies {{along with other}} deer and game species. The first red deer to reach New Zealand were a pair sent by Lord Petre in 1851 from his herd at Thorndon Park, Essex, to the South Island, but the hind was shot before {{they had a chance}} to breed. Lord Petre sent another stag and two hinds in 1861, and these were liberated near Nelson, from where they quickly spread. The first deer to reach the North Island were a gift to Sir Frederick Weld from Windsor Great Park and were released near Wellington; these were followed by further releases up to 1914. Between 1851 and 1926, 220 separate liberations of red deer involved over 800 deer. In 1927, the State Forest Service introduced a bounty for red deer shot on their land, and in 1931, government control operations were commenced. Between 1931 and March 1975, 1,124,297 deer were killed on official operations.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{establishment}} of the Brisbane Showgrounds, or Exhibition Grounds, in 1876, the site was part of the Queensland <b>Acclimatisation</b> Society's grounds. In July 1863 this Society, established in 1862 to promote the introduction, acclimatization, propagation and distribution in Queensland of economically useful plants and animals, was granted 33 acres of land bounded by Bowen Bridge Road, O'Connell Terrace, Brookes Street and Gregory Terrace. At the northwestern corner of the site, fronting Bowen Bridge Road and O'Connell Terrace, the Society established a public exhibition garden Bowen Park. The remainder of the site was used for experimentation purposes, growing and propagating plants and seeds sent from other parts of Queensland, other colonies and around the world, and raising various introduced animals. The Society {{played an important role in}} the beginnings of commercial agriculture in Queensland, introducing or trialling crops and plants such as mango trees, ginger plants, sugar cane, olive trees and choko vines.|$|E
25|$|The {{division}} {{remained in}} the United Kingdom until May 1942 when it {{was sent to the}} Middle East to join the British Eighth Army, becoming active there in early July. In mid-July the brigade, now commanded by Brigadier L. E. Misa, was detached from the 8th Armoured Division and with the addition of the 5th Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery became known as the 23rd Armoured Brigade Group. After only 14 days of <b>acclimatisation</b> and without any infantry support training the brigade was chosen to reinforce XXX Corps's attack during the Second Battle of Ruweisat Ridge, part of the First Battle of El Alamein. The regiments failed to locate the lanes cleared by the leading units through the Axis minefields and were virtually annihilated by German anti-tank fire while trying to find the lanes. The brigade mustered 122 Valentines and 18 Matildas for this attack, but at day's end had lost a total of 116 of those tanks. More importantly 44% of its tank crews had been killed or wounded in the days fighting.|$|E
25|$|In 1874 moves were {{initiated}} by Queensland's Chief Inspector of Stock, Patrick Robertson Gordon, {{to form a}} national agricultural society, to plan Brisbane's first intercolonial exhibition. He was supported by Gresley Lukin, editor of the Brisbane Courier and the Queenslander, and agricultural agent John Fenwick. In May 1875 an inaugural meeting, presided over by the Queensland Governor, Sir William Wellington Cairns, was held to form the National Agricultural and Industrial Association of Queensland. A constitution drafted by the headmaster of the Brisbane Grammar School, Thomas Harlin, was adopted in July, and {{the first meeting of}} the National Agricultural and Industrial Association of Queensland was held at the Brisbane Town Hall on 13 August 1875. Arthur Hunter Palmer, later Premier of Queensland, was elected to the chair and other founding members included Joshua Peter Bell, George Harris, George Gromes, Thomas Harlin, Charles Stewart Mein and William Hemmant. At this meeting, use of part of the Queensland <b>Acclimatisation</b> Society's grounds was discussed and subsequently a lease of about 12 acres from the Society was arranged.|$|E
25|$|The {{next major}} {{conflict}} that 3 RAR {{was involved in}} was the Malayan Emergency. The Australian Government first committed a battalion in 1955 to assist Malayan Government counter incursion of Communist Terrorists (CTs). However, {{it was not until}} October 1957 that 3 RAR arrived in theatre; it then commenced a period of <b>acclimatisation</b> at the FARELF Training Centre Kota Tingi (later to become the Jungle Warfare School). 3 RAR then moved to company base camps at Kuala Kangsar (BHQ), Lasah, Sungei, Siput, Penang and Lintang. The unit was engaged in anti-communist terrorist operations in northern Malaya. Operations began in November 1957 and as a result many terrorist camps and food dumps were located and destroyed. 3 RAR was credited with killing 14 terrorists and was responsible for the capture of 32 others. 3 RAR casualties over the two years were two wounded and four non-battle casualties. Upon return to Australia, 3 RAR established itself at Enoggera Barracks, Brisbane. It remained there for four years during which time it carried out routine training and barracks duties and was organised on the Pentropic establishment, with five rifle companies and an enlarged headquarters.|$|E
25|$|After the {{withdrawal}} from Gallipoli, the battalion returned to Egypt {{where they were}} once again used in the defence of the Suez Canal against the Turks and the AIF undertook a period of reorganisation and expansion. In March 1916, the 3rd Battalion embarked for France, where {{for the next two}} and a half years it would serve in the trenches along the Western Front. Following a period of <b>acclimatisation</b> where the battalion undertook duties in a quiet sector of the line, in July 1916 the battalion took part in its first major action in Europe, during the Battle of Pozières. Later they took part in the fighting around Ypres in Belgium, before returning to the Somme to man the line during the winter. Throughout 1917, they were involved in operations against the Hindenburg Line, spending a majority of the year in the line near Ypres. In 1918 the battalion was used to help stop the German spring offensive in March and April, before taking part in the final Allied offensive launched near Amiens on 8 August 1918, which ultimately brought an end to the war. As a part of this offensive, the 3rd Battalion continued operations until late September 1918, when they were withdrawn for rest and reorganisation. They were out of the line when the Armistice was declared on 11 November 1918 and following that the slow process of demobilisation and repatriation of men began. By May 1919, the majority of the battalion's personnel had been returned to Australia for discharge and the battalion was disbanded.|$|E
500|$|The week {{prior to}} the {{international}} round would be free of matches, to allow for travel and <b>acclimatisation.</b> [...] The week after the international round would see each team face one of the teams which had played at the same foreign venue, to avoid any disadvantage for teams with a longer round-trip. [...] Possible venues suggested for international-round matches were Australia, East Asia, Southeast Asia, the Gulf States, and North America. [...] All are wealthy regions where interest in English football is strong relative {{to the level of}} the domestic game. [...] Venues would have warm, predictable weather, unlike England in January.|$|E
500|$|Believing that Shackleton might {{attempt a}} {{crossing}} {{during the first}} season, Mackintosh decided that the first two depots had to be laid without delay, one at 79°S near Minna Bluff, a prominent Barrier landmark, and another further south at the 80° mark. These were, in his view, the minimum that would enable Shackleton's party to survive a crossing of the Barrier. [...] The delayed arrival of Aurora in the Antarctic had given little time for <b>acclimatisation</b> for the dogs and for the untrained men, and this led to differences of view about how to proceed. Ernest Joyce, {{by far the most}} experienced Antarctic traveller in the party, favoured a cautious approach and wanted to delay the start by at least a week. Joyce claimed that Shackleton had given him independent control over sledging activities, a view rejected by Mackintosh and later demonstrated as without foundation.|$|E
500|$|The Royal Australian Regiment {{was also}} present in Malaya, so to prevent {{confusion}} the Rhodesian African Rifles' acronym was temporarily changed to [...] "RhAR". The regiment's advance party, made up of officers, non-commissioned officers (NCOs) and warrant officers, left the Southern Rhodesian capital Salisbury by air on 13 February 1956. Their tortuous route took them through Nairobi, Aden, Karachi, and RAF Negombo (in Ceylon). After touching down in Singapore, the RhAR's advance party travelled to Kluang in Johore, where they spent three weeks in jungle training with the NRR. They then redeployed to Batu Pahat, where they camped with the Fiji Infantry Regiment. A spirit of camaraderie quickly developed between the Fijian and Southern Rhodesian soldiers. The RhAR officers and NCOs continued their <b>acclimatisation</b> with the local environment over the following weeks, assisted by the Fijians. The rest of the battalion travelled by sea aboard SS Empire Clyde, and reached Singapore on 26 April 1956. Soon after, the RhAR set up headquarters at Chaah, about [...] north-west of the port city.|$|E
500|$|The 3rd Pioneers would {{subsequently}} {{serve on}} the Western Front from late 1916 {{until the end of}} the war. After a brief period of <b>acclimatisation</b> in a [...] "nursery sector" [...] around Armentieres, the battalion's first major action came around Messines in June 1917, during which several of the battalion's companies were assigned to the assaulting companies to dig communication trenches while other troops were assigned general engineering duties such as road clearance, tramway maintenance, anti-aircraft defence and water supply, laying pipes and ensuring that they were maintained throughout the battle. Following this, the battalion's next major battle of 1917 was the Third Battle of Ypres, before moving back to Wavrans in late October 1917. One member of the battalion, Lance Corporal Walter Peeler, received the Victoria Cross, for his bravery during the Battle of Broodseinde in October 1917. During the action, Peeler was part of a Lewis Gun team that was supporting the 37th Infantry Battalion; tasked with providing anti-aircraft defence, when the first wave of the assault was held up, Peeler advanced ahead of the assaulting infantry and destroyed one of the German positions that was causing heavy casualties. He then proceeded to destroy a machine gun position.|$|E
500|$|Aurora {{finally left}} Hobart, Tasmania, on 24 December 1914. On 16 January 1915 the shore party landed at McMurdo Sound, where Mackintosh {{established}} a base camp at Captain Scott's old headquarters at Cape Evans. Believing that Shackleton might {{have already begun}} his march from the Weddell Sea, {{he was determined to}} begin depot-laying at once. [...] Joyce, the expedition's most seasoned Antarctic traveller—he had been with Scott's Discovery Expedition in 1901–04, and with the Nimrod Expedition—protested that the party needed time for <b>acclimatisation</b> and training, but was overruled. Joyce was shocked by the rebuff; he had expected that Mackintosh would defer to him on sledging matters: [...] "If I had Shacks here I would make him see my way of arguing", he wrote in his diary. The depot-laying journey which followed began with a series of mishaps. A blizzard delayed their start, a motor sledge broke down after a few miles, and Mackintosh and his group lost their way on the sea ice between Cape Evans and Hut Point. Conditions on the Barrier were harsh for the untrained and inexperienced men. Many of the stores taken on to the Barrier were dumped on the ice to reduce loads and did not reach the depots. After Mackintosh insisted, over Joyce's urgent protests, on taking the dogs all the way to 80°S, all died on the journey. The men, frostbitten and exhausted, returned to the old Discovery expedition hut at Hut Point on 24 March, but were cut off from the ship and from their Cape Evans base by unsafe sea ice [...] and had to wait, idle, for nearly three months. After this experience, confidence in Mackintosh's leadership was low, and bickering rife.|$|E
