50|$|Compounds such as Sr2ScFePO3 {{discovered}} in 2009 {{are referred to}} as the '42622' family, as FePSr2ScO3. Noteworthy is the synthesis of (Ca4Al2O6−y)(Fe2Pn2) (or Al-42622(Pn); Pn = As and P) using high-pressure synthesis technique. Al-42622(Pn) exhibit superconductivity for both Pn = As and P with the transition temperatures of 28.3 K and 17.1 K, respectively. The a-lattice parameters of Al-42622(Pn) (a = 3.713 Å and 3.692 Å for Pn = As and P, respectively) are smallest among the iron-pnictide superconductors. Correspondingly, Al-42622(As) has the smallest As-Fe-As bond angle (102.1°) and the largest As distance from the Fe planes (1.5 Å). High-pressure technique also yields (Ca3Al2O5−y)(Fe2Pn2) (Pn = As and P), the first reported iron-based superconductors with the perovskite-based '32522' structure. The transition temperature (Tc) is 30.2 K for Pn = As and 16.6 K for Pn = P. The emergence of superconductivity is ascribed to the small tetragonal <b>a-axis</b> lattice constant of these materials.

50|$|Wadsleyite is a spinelloid, and the {{structure}} {{is based on a}} distorted cubic-closest packing of oxygen atoms as are the spinels. The <b>a-axis</b> and the b-axis is the half diagonal of the spinel unit. The magnesium and the silicon are completely ordered in {{the structure}}.

There are four distinct oxygen atoms in the structure. O2 is a bridging oxygen shared between two tetrahedra, and O1 is a non-silicate oxygen (not bonded to Si). The potentially hydrated O1 atom lies at the center of four edge-sharing Mg2+ octahedra (Smyth, 1987, 1994). If this oxygen is hydrated (protonated), a Mg vacancy can occur at M3. If water incorporation exceeds about 1.5% the M3 vacancies can order in violation of space group Imma, reducing the symmetry to monoclinic I2/m with beta angle up to 90.4º.|$|E
