5|$|Besides Japanese, the Ryukyuan {{languages}} (Amami, Kunigami, Okinawan, Miyako, Yaeyama, Yonaguni), {{also part}} of the Japonic language family, are spoken in the Ryukyu Islands chain. Few children learn these languages, but in recent years the local governments have sought to increase awareness of the traditional languages. The Okinawan Japanese dialect is also spoken in the region. The Ainu language, which has no proven relationship to Japanese or any other language, is moribund, with only a few elderly native speakers remaining in Hokkaido. Public and private schools generally require students to take Japanese language classes as well <b>as</b> <b>English</b> language courses.|$|E

Abbot Bourchier and the 25 canons at Leicester Abbey acknowledged the king's royal supremacy on 11 August 1534, thereby saving the abbey from immediate dissolution.|$|E

One Wallace scholar has stated that the most reasonable interpretation is therefore {{that he was an}} Englishman born in Wales.|$|E
