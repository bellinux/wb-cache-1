2500|$|The Lohner-Porsche Mixte Hybrid, {{produced}} {{as early as}} 1899, was the first hybrid electric car. Early hybrids could be charged from an external source before operation. However, the term [...] "plug-in hybrid" [...] has come to mean a hybrid vehicle that can be charged from a standard electrical wall socket. The term [...] "plug-in hybrid electric vehicle" [...] was coined by UC Davis Professor Andrew Frank, who {{has been called the}} [...] "father of the modern plug-in hybrid." [...] The July 1969 issue of Popular Science featured an article on the General Motors XP-883 plug-in hybrid.

[...] A fully charged {{battery state of charge}} reads 85% and the all-electric mode disengages at 23%, and the usable energy after charging loss is 2.73 kWh. The included charging cable connects to the charging port inlet located on the right-rear fender. The charge port location was moved from the front driver-side fender in the demonstration model based on input from the program participants. The battery charger cable weighs just , is [...] in length, and fits in its own compartment in the trunk area. [...] The charge port provides LED (Light Emitting Diode) illumination for convenient night-time charging. [...] A timer allows charging to take place during off-peak hours and can be set for either a start or end time.|$|E
