5|$|Fishers {{have had}} a long history of contact with humans, but most of it has been to the {{detriment}} of fisher populations. Unprovoked attacks on humans are extremely rare, but fishers will attack if they feel threatened or cornered. In one case, a fisher was blamed for <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> six-year-old boy. In another case, a fisher is believed to be responsible for <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> twelve-year-old boy.|$|E

5|$|In 1916, {{with the}} Rifle Brigade now {{serving on the}} Western Front {{as part of the}} New Zealand Division, Barrowclough was {{regarded}} as an outstanding officer and in March was promoted to captain.

In September 1916, he won a Military Cross for his actions during the Battle of the Somme when he led a party in <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> German strong point and linked up with the neighbouring British 47th Division. He was also awarded the Croix de Guerre for the same action.|$|E
5|$|Mayer {{claimed his}} first {{victories}} over United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) four-engine bombers on 23 November 1942.

He received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves on 16 April 1943 after 63 victories. On 1 July 1943, he was appointed commander of JG2. On 5 February 1944, Mayer became the first pilot on the Channel Front to reach 100 victories. He was killed in action on 2 March 1944 while leading <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> USAAF bomber formation; he was shot down near Montmédy, France. Mayer was posthumously awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords.|$|E

5|$|The battle {{followed}} escalating {{ethnic tensions}} in the Lika region, including attacks on Croatian civilians in Lovinac, <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Croatian police checkpoint in Žuta Lokva, and skirmishes at the Plitvice Lakes and the Ljubovo Pass on the Gospić–Plitvička Jezera road. The remainder of 1991 saw further deterioration {{of the situation in}} the region, resulting in war crimes against Serbs and Croats in the Gospić and Široka Kula massacres. Fighting in the region remained deadlocked, with little to no territorial gains to either side, until a lasting ceasefire was called with the signing of the Sarajevo Agreement of 2 January 1992.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} its new aircraft, {{the squadron}} was tasked with anti-shipping attacks, and it and No.100 Squadron cooperated in <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Japanese convoy near Cape St. George {{on the night}} of 20 October during which a No.6 Squadron pilot claimed to have damaged a cruiser. No.6 Squadron also bombed Japanese positions in New Britain during October in conjunction with No.100 Squadron. In addition to these offensive operations, the squadron regularly flew anti-submarine patrols to protect Allied shipping. In November the squadron moved to Goodenough Island and became part of No. 71 Wing RAAF alongside No.8 and No.100 Squadrons. From November 1943 to March 1944, No.6 Squadron took part in attacks on the major Japanese base at Rabaul, and also struck other targets in the region to support the naval and ground forces engaged in the New Britain Campaign. From March the squadron mainly undertook convoy escort and anti-submarine patrols, which proved uneventful. No.6 Squadron's operations were hampered by mechanical problems with its Beauforts, which had been issued to the unit after being reconditioned following service with other RAAF squadrons, and this problem continued until October when it received an allocation of recently built aircraft.|$|E
5|$|After {{this the}} brigade {{continued}} to advance, moving through Ruddenburg and Greven before carrying out {{an attack on}} Osnabruck, which No. 3 Commando led, on 4 April 1945. The next day, they crossed the Weser River in assault boats and {{under the cover of}} darkness carried out a flanking manoeuvre on the Germans occupying the town of Leese. As other elements from the brigade attacked from the east, No. 3 Commando, now under the command of Peter Bartholomew after Komrower had been posted to the Commando Training Depot, carried out a follow-up operation to the north. The operation was <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> factory that had been producing V-2 rockets and after No. 3 Commando had captured it with the support of a number of tanks, a search found a number of these weapons, along with about 100 scientists who had been working in the factory.|$|E

5|$|An {{operations}} plan {{suited for}} <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> small enemy formation {{was drafted by}} Ziegler, who was an adviser to Dam and the command staff of the 7th Infantry Division. Ziegler's plan, codenamed Operation Duc Thang I, called for the South Vietnamese to assault Ap Tan Thoi from three different directions: three rifle companies from the 11th Infantry Regiment, 7th Infantry Division, {{to move from the}} north; the Dinh Tuong Civil Guards Regiment to march north from the south in separate columns; and a company of 13 M113 armored personnel carriers with an infantry company on board from the southwest. The M113 carriers and the infantry company could act as both a mobile reserve and a reaction force, so it was positioned where it could be shifted to the contact area if the Viet Cong began to retreat. In addition, Dam would also deploy two rifle companies at Tan Hiep airfield, which could be brought to the battlefield by helicopters from the US Army 93rd Transportation Company.|$|E
5|$|Born in {{a suburb}} of Sydney, New South Wales, Howell was {{employed}} as a builder before enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force in June 1915. Allotted to the force's 1st Battalion, he served at Gallipoli prior to transferring to the Western Front. Participating in the Somme offensive of 1916, Howell was wounded at Pozières and promoted to corporal in early 1917. During <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> German held village, he led a rifle bombing section and was awarded the Military Medal for his actions. Severely wounded in his Victoria Cross action, Howell underwent a prolonged hospitalisation period before returning to Australia and receiving his discharge on medical grounds. Settling in Coogee, he gained employment by working on the advertising staff of several newspapers. Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Howell served with the Australian Eastern Command Headquarters but soon sought his discharge and enlisted with the United States Sea Transport Service. He died in 1964 at the age of 71.|$|E
5|$|In March 1945, Miller was {{deployed}} to the RAF station at Great Massingham in Norfolk, East Anglia. He {{was assigned to}} 169 Squadron, flying Mosquito fighter-bombers. Miller's squadron took part in missions against targets on mainland Europe in April and May 1945. They attacked V-1 and V-2 production and test launch sites {{on the island of}} Peenemünde in the North Sea. On 19 April, Miller took part in <b>an</b> <b>attack</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> German installation at Flensburg in northern Germany. In May, his squadron was deployed in Operation Fire Bash, to attack Westerland Airfield on the island of Sylt. One of Miller's bombs failed to release and the load dangled from a wing. Miller was obliged to land the plane with the bomb still attached. Miller's next mission was delayed by poor weather, by which time Germany had surrendered. His commanding officer ordered him to fly air force personnel over Germany to view the results of Allied bombing. On one flight, Miller broke away from the flying formation and returned to base late because he wanted to fly over Bonn, the birthplace of Beethoven.|$|E
