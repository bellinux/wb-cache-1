40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{communication}} is to report 2 patients who devel-oped asymptomatic <b>accelerated</b> <b>idioventricular</b> <b>rhythms</b> several years after experiencing myocardial infarctions. CASE REPORT The first patient was a 56 -year-old black man with angina pectoris who had a myocardial infarction 5 years before being seen with <b>idioventricular</b> <b>rhythm.</b> At the time this mechanism was observed, the patient had no symptoms attributable to the arrhythmia. It was discovered on a routine electrocardiogram (Figure 1), which revealed a sinus mechanism at 45 per minute alternating with an <b>accelerated</b> <b>idioventricular</b> pacemaker {{at a rate of}} 55 per minute. The patient was taking several medications for hyperten-sion, including guanethidine and methyldopa, and these may have con-tributed to his sinus bradycardia and the resultant escape mechanism. Propantheline, 15 mg four times a day, was instituted in an attempt to accelerate the sinus node and to suppress the escape rhythm. When seen again a few days later, he had returned to sinus rhythm. The second patient was a 69 -year-old white man with a history of an inferior wall myocardial infarction. His rhythm disturbance was noted 2 years after the infarction, during a routine follow-up visit, and it was totally asymptomatic. The rhythm strip revealing an <b>idioventricular</b> <b>rhythm</b> was made {{because of the presence of}} moderately frequent ectopic beats on auscultation. It revealed a sinus rhythm at 65 per minute alternat-ing with an idioventricular mechanism (Figure 2) at virtually the same rate. As the rhythm changed, fusion beats were noted, and in one area the <b>idioventricular</b> <b>rhythm</b> was interrupted by a premature atrial contractio...|$|R
40|$|In this review, a brief {{overview}} of the different arrhythmogenic mechanisms is given, emphasizing that the mechanisms for initiation and maintenance of tachyarrhythmias are often not the same. Normal automaticity in Purkinje fibers, surrounded by partially depolarized tissue providing entrance block, is most likely responsible for ventricular premature beats and enhanced automaticity can lead to (rare) cathecholamine dependent ventricular tachycardias. Abnormal automaticity in partially depolarized cells may underlie ectopic atrial tachycardias and <b>accelerated</b> <b>idioventricular</b> <b>rhythms</b> in the subacute phase of myocardial infarction. Triggered activity based on early afterdepolarizations may trigger torsade de pointes in both the congenital and acquired long QT syndrome. The various mutations, affecting both potassium and sodium channels, will be discussed. Cellular calcium overload, which may occur in digitalis intoxication, hypertrophy and heart failure, is the cause for delayed afterdepolarizations and triggered activity. Reentry, anatomical and functional, ordered or reentry, {{is by far the most}} common cause of both atrial and ventricular tachycardias and fibrillation. Special attention will be given to the phenomenon of "electrical remodeling" in which prolonged episodes of rapid electrical activity leads to changes in ion channel function, which in their turn cause long lasting electrophysiological alteration...|$|R
40|$|Ventricular {{fibrillation}} (VF) and transient arrhythmias after defibrillation {{were analyzed}} from the recordings of 28 patients containing {{at least one}} episode of ventricular fibrillation. An R-on-T extrasystole initiated VF in 60 % of the episodes. Other initiating factors were a late premature beat (24 %), stable ventricular tachycardia (VT) (7 %), <b>accelerating</b> <b>idioventricular</b> <b>rhythm</b> (5 %) and cardioversion of VT (5 %) with a sinusoidal waveform. After the initiating beat, in most cases, evidence was found of a transient ventricular tachycardia which then deteriorated into VF. With a stable VT this may occur after a long time; {{in the case of}} apolymorphic VT (with changing amplitude) it generally occurred within 30 s. The main transient arrhythmias generated by circulatory arrest during VF and by the defibrillation shock were: total arrest, total AV-block and/or bradycardia. The combination of a longer duration of VF and a high energy level generally resulted in an increase in the duration of these arrhythmias (P less than 0. 01, N = 30). Comparison of episodes of VT and VF recorded in a single patient also shows that arrhythmias are more unfavourable and of longer duration after VF than after VT. These data emphasize fast defibrillation, initially with stored energy levels less than 250...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to relate the number of ventricular arrhythmias (VA) to the normalization time of the ST segment during thrombolysis for acute myocardial infarction. The 24 h Holter recordings, begun on start of intravenous thrombolytic therapy, and the 12 -lead electrocardiograms of 41 patients with a patent infarct-related artery according to coronary angiography were analysed. The mean time from onset of chest pain to angiography was 30. 5 ± 3. 1 h, ≥ 24 h in 59 %. The normalization time of the ST segment, assessed by the time of decrease of ST segment elevation from start of Holter recording to normal or steady state was ≥ 60 min in 13 patients (group 1), 60 to 180 min in 15 patients (group 2) and > 180 min in 13 patients (group 3). The incidence of VA was similar in all groups, except for ventricular tachycardias (VT) > 15 beats (group 1 : 69 %, group 2 : 13 %, group 3 : 15 %, P= 0. 002) The frequency of <b>accelerated</b> <b>idioventricular</b> <b>rhythms</b> (AIVR), early AIVR (≤ 6 h) and of VT was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 3 with a 8 -, 30 - and 6 - fold increase, respectively (back transformed mean).

40|$|Patients {{with acute}} {{myocardial}} infarction were monitored for ventricular arrhythmias in the first 48 hours. <b>Idioventricular</b> <b>rhythm</b> (rate less than 100 /minute) occurred in 35 out of 224 patients (15. 6 %) during the first day and in 13 out of 192 patients not receiving treatment {{on the second day}} (6. 8 %). This arrhythmia was frequently preceded by late ventricular extrasystoles, which often showed variation of their coupling intervals to the preceding QRS. Double ventricular extrasystoles separated by larger than or equal to 600 ms were also precursors of <b>idioventricular</b> <b>rhythm.</b> <b>Idioventricular</b> <b>rhythm</b> at times could be described as an escape rhythm, but on other occasions it was undoubtedly an accelerated rhythm. Spontaneous changes in the idioventricular cycle length were frequent on single one-minute electrocardiographic recordings. The rate of the dominant rhythm in patients with episodes of <b>idioventricular</b> <b>rhythm</b> was significantly slower than the heart rate of patients without this arrhythmia. <b>Idioventricular</b> <b>rhythm</b> was more frequent in patients with inferior infarction. <b>Idioventricular</b> <b>rhythm</b> sometimes preceded ventricular tachycardia but there was only a significant association between ventricular tachycardia and <b>idioventricular</b> <b>rhythms</b> with rates of over 75 /minute.

5000|$|Normally, the {{pacemaker}} of {{the heart}} {{that is responsible for}} triggering each heart beat (ventricular contraction) is the SA (Sino Atrial) node. However, if the ventricle does not receive triggering signals at a rate high enough from either the SA node or the AV (Atrioventricular) node, the ventricular myocardium itself becomes the pacemaker (escape rhythm). This is called Idioventricular Rhythm. Ventricular signals are transmitted cell-to-cell between cardiomyocytes and not by the conduction system, creating wide sometimes bizarre QRS complexes(> 0.12 sec). The rate is usually 20-40 bpm. If the rate is >40 bpm, it is called <b>accelerated</b> <b>idioventricular</b> <b>rhythm.</b> The rate of 20-40 is the [...] "intrinsic automaticity" [...] of the ventricular myocardium.

40|$|While {{patients}} who present with a pulseless <b>idioventricular</b> <b>rhythm</b> have a dismal prognosis, such a rhythm following electrical defibrillation from ventricular fibrillation (VF) {{may have an}} entirely different clinical significance. By reviewing the cases of 100 consecutive patients with prehospital ventricular fibrillation, we found the following: Subsequent development of field pulses, survival to hospital admission and hospital discharge in 49 {{patients who}} initially had pulseless <b>idioventricular</b> <b>rhythm</b> following defibrillation were statistically significantly worse (P<. 05) than for 20 patients successfully defibrillated into any other organized rhythm. They were statistically significantly better, however, than for 25 patients who failed to achieve any organized rhythm in the field. Outcomes were statistically no different in 40 patients who received standard advanced cardiac life support drug therapy for pulseless <b>idioventricular</b> <b>rhythm</b> after defibrillation than in 9 patients who spontaneously progressed to another rhythm before drug therapy could be given. These findings suggest that pulseless <b>idioventricular</b> <b>rhythm</b> may be a transient recovery rhythm following defibrillation from prehospital VF, that it can in this circumstance {{be associated with a}} good outcome in a reasonable number of patients and that a short trial of cardiopulmonary resuscitation only, without immediate drug therapy, may be appropriate in these patients...|$|R

40|$|In {{animal studies}} reperfusion of {{coronary}} arteries is commonly accompanied by ventricular arrhythmias. It is not certain, however, whether ventricular arrhythmias {{can be used}} as a reliable non-invasive marker of reperfusion in humans. Two-channel Holter recordings were obtained from the start of an intravenous infusion of streptokinase until coronary angiography (2. 8 (2. 7) hours (mean SD)) afterwards) in 57 patients with acute myocardial infarction of less than four hours who were generally not treated with antiarrhythmic drugs. Ventricular arrhythmias occurred in 21 (37 %) of the 57 patients: <b>accelerated</b> <b>idioventricular</b> <b>rhythm</b> in 13 patients and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia in 15 patients. Seven patients had both <b>accelerated</b> <b>idioventricular</b> <b>rhythm</b> and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. Coronary angiography showed a patent infarct-related vessel in 12 (92 %) of the 13 patients with <b>accelerated</b> <b>idioventricular</b> <b>rhythm</b> (95 % confidence interval 66 to 99 %), in 22 (50 %) of the 44 patients without <b>accelerated</b> <b>idioventricular</b> <b>rhythm</b> (95 % CI 34 to 66 %), in 11 (73 %) of the 15 patients with non-sustained ventricular tachycardia (95 % CI 45 to 92 %), and in 23 (55 %) (95 % CI 39 to 71 %) of the 42 patients who did not have non-sustained ventricular tachycardia.

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} outcome as a {{function}} of the initial electrophysiologic mechanisms recorded at the scene of prehospital cardiac arrest have demonstrated that bradyarrhythmias and asystole have the worst prognosis. In this report, our observations in bradyarrhythmic and asystolic arrests occurring from 1980 to 1982 are compared with those from 1975 to 1978. From 1980 to 1982, 61 (27 %) of 225 cardiac arrest events meeting entry criteria for the study were bradyarrhythmic or asystolic. Only 2 (8 %) of 24 patients with asystole and 1 (20 %) of 5 patients with sinus bradycardia survived prehospital intervention. Only 1 of these 29 patients was discharged from the hospital alive. In contrast, 15 (47 %) of 32 patients who presented with <b>idioventricular</b> <b>rhythm</b> at initial contact survived prehospital intervention and were hospitalized, and 8 (25 %) of these 32 were ultimately discharged alive. When compared with the 1975 to 1978 patients with bradyarrhythmia and asystole, both prehospital survival (8 versus 30 %, p < 0. 001) and survival after hospitalization (0 versus 15 %, p < 0. 05) significantly improved, but the improvement occurred predominantly in the subgroup with <b>idioventricular</b> <b>rhythm.</b> Survivors within this subgroup tended to have a prompt response to prehospital pharmacologic interventions that were not available to the 1975 to 1978 group. The response was manifested by return to a sinus mechanism or increase in the rate of <b>idioventricular</b> <b>rhythm.</b> In conclusion, outcome has improved for a specific subgroup of victims of prehospital cardiac arrest with bradyarrhythmia or asystole; the improved outcome may relate to field interventions by rescue personnel at the scene of arrest but the mortality rate is still high...|$|R

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} the oral aselective dopamine congener ibopamine, heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac rhythm, electrocardiographic (ECG) parameters and plasma catecholamines were studied in ten healthy subjects on three occasions: without medication, after 100 mg oral ibopamine and after combined treatment of ibopamine and the dopamine antagonist metoclopramide. Ibopamine was well tolerated by all subjects. No significant changes in heart rate or blood pressure were seen during either ibopamine alone or during concomitant metoclopramide administration. In addition, there were no differences in PR-, QRS- and QTc- intervals on the ECG and plasma norepinephrine, epinephrine and dopamine levels were unchanged. None of the ten volunteers showed proarrhythmia from ibopamine. However, in one subject, episodes of <b>accelerated</b> <b>idioventricular</b> <b>rhythm</b> were observed after ibopamine, which were asymptomatic and did not exceed a rate of 51 beats/minute.
