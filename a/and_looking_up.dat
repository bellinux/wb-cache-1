25|$|After marrying, Joseph and Jessie Wilson {{moved to}} the Southern United States in 1851 and came to fully {{identify}} with it, moving from Virginia deeper into the region as Wilson became a minister in Georgia and South Carolina. Joseph Wilson owned slaves, defended slavery, and also set up a Sunday school for his slaves. Both parents identified with the Confederacy during the American Civil War; they cared for wounded soldiers at their church, and Wilson's father briefly served as a chaplain to the Confederate Army. Woodrow Wilson's earliest memory, {{from the age of}} three, was of hearing that Abraham Lincoln had been elected and that a war was coming. Wilson would forever recall standing for a moment at General Robert E. Lee's side <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> into his face.|$|E

2500|$|Food {{is taken}} mainly {{off the ground}} but also off the vine. The birds may jump for fruit or, as with the Crypturellus species, jump up to a metre in height for insects. The main {{foraging}} technique is a slow walk with head down, pecking at the ground <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> occasionally. Small animals are eaten whole, larger ones are beaten against the ground or pecked. Bills rather than feet are used to probe leaf litter and sift through soil [...] deep.|$|E
2500|$|Adams {{claimed that}} the title came from a 1971 {{incident}} while he was hitchhiking around Europe {{as a young man}} with a copy of the Hitch-hiker's Guide to Europe book: while lying drunk in a field near Innsbruck with a copy of the book <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> at the stars, he thought it would be a good idea for someone to write a hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy as well. However, he later claimed that he had told this story so many times that he had forgotten the incident itself, and only remembered himself telling the story. His friends are quoted as saying that Adams mentioned the idea of [...] "hitch-hiking around the galaxy" [...] to them while on holiday in Greece in 1973.|$|E

2500|$|The {{form and}} content of the {{meetings}} is established by the denomination's Brooklyn headquarters, generally involving a consideration of the same subject matter worldwide each week. Two meetings each week are divided into five distinct sections, lasting a total of about four hours. Meetings are opened and closed with hymns and brief prayers delivered from the platform. Witnesses are urged to prepare for all meetings by studying Watch Tower literature from which the content is drawn <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> the scriptures cited in the articles. Kingdom Halls are typically functional in character, and contain no religious symbols. Each year, Witnesses from several congregations, which form a [...] "circuit", gather for two one-day assemblies; several circuits meet once a year for a three-day [...] "regional convention", and every few years the Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses hold [...] "international conventions" [...] in selected cities around the world. These larger gatherings are usually held at rented stadiums or auditoriums. Their most important and solemn event is the celebration of the [...] "Lord's Evening Meal", or [...] "Memorial of Christ's Death".|$|E
2500|$|The {{courtyard}} of the building includes the sculpture Fidelity, Bravery, Integrity by Frederick Charles Shrady. In January 1975, the Society of Former Special Agents of the FBI passed a resolution to create a memorial to J. Edgar Hoover. The memorial, which cost $125,000, was funded through contributions. The artist was selected through a design contest, and the sculpture dedicated on October 13, 1979. The piece, made of bronze ( [...] wide and [...] deep), shows three figures which represent Fidelity, Bravery, and Integrity. The figures are placed {{against a backdrop of}} a large United States flag, which appears to wave in the breeze. Fidelity, a female, is on the right, seated on the ground <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>up</b> at a male figure of Bravery. To the left of Bravery is Integrity, a male figure who kneels on one knee, with his left hand on his heart. He looks towards Bravery, who stands flanked by the two other figures. The figures are simple with little detail. The sculpture rests on a rectangular base [...] by [...] by [...] made of slabs of black marble and mortar. The front of the base is carved and painted with the words [...] "Fidelity, Bravery, and Integrity". In 1993, the piece was surveyed as part of the Smithsonian Institution's Save Outdoor Sculpture! and was described as needing conservation treatment.|$|E
