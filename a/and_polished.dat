5|$|Diamond {{enhancements}} {{are specific}} treatments performed on natural or synthetic diamonds (usually those already cut <b>and</b> <b>polished</b> into a gem), which {{are designed to}} better the gemological characteristics of the stone {{in one or more}} ways. These include laser drilling to remove inclusions, application of sealants to fill cracks, treatments to improve a white diamond's color grade, and treatments to give fancy color to a white diamond.|$|E

5|$|The {{identification}} of stolen diamonds presents {{a set of}} difficult problems. Rough diamonds will have a distinctive shape depending on whether their source is a mine or from an alluvial environment such as a beach or river - alluvial diamonds have smoother surfaces than {{those that have been}} mined. Determining the provenance of cut <b>and</b> <b>polished</b> stones is much more complex.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background To investigate, within general dental practice, patients' and {{vocational}} dental practitioners' (VDP) attitudes towards {{the benefits and}} costs of a simple scale <b>and</b> <b>polish</b> <b>and</b> to compare the experience of using manual versus ultrasonic instruments to scale teeth. Methods 28 VDPs and 420 patients participated. Patients were randomly allocated to either group. Patients' and VDPs' attitudes towards, and experience of, the scale <b>and</b> <b>polish</b> were elicited by means of self-administered questionnaires. Results The majority of patients (99 %) believed a scale <b>and</b> <b>polish</b> was beneficial. VDPs considered ultrasonic treatment to be appropriate on significantly more occasions than they did for manual scale <b>and</b> <b>polish</b> (P Conclusion Routine scaling <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> is considered beneficial by both patients {{and vocational}} trainees. The majority of patients, regardless of treatment method, experience some degree of discomfort when undergoing a scale <b>and</b> <b>polish.</b> VDPs showed a preference for the ultrasonic treatment method. </p...|$|R
5|$|Diamonds {{prepared}} as gemstones are sold on diamond exchanges called bourses. There are 28 registered diamond bourses in the world. Bourses are the final tightly controlled {{step in the}} diamond supply chain; wholesalers and even retailers are able to buy relatively small lots of diamonds at the bourses, after which they are prepared for final sale to the consumer. Diamonds can be sold already set in jewelry, or sold unset ("loose"). According to the Rio Tinto Group, in 2002 the diamonds produced and released to the market were valued at US$9billion as rough diamonds, US$14billion after being cut <b>and</b> <b>polished,</b> US$28billion in wholesale diamond jewelry, and US$57billion in retail sales.|$|E
5|$|Fleming became {{interested}} in diamond smuggling after reading an article in The Sunday Times in 1954 concerning the Sierra Leone diamond industry. Philip Brownrigg, an old friend from Eton and a senior exec of De Beers, arranged for Fleming to visit the London Diamond Club to see diamonds being sorted <b>and</b> <b>polished.</b> In 1955 Brownrigg also introduced Fleming to Sir Percy Sillitoe, former head of MI5, who was working for De Beers and investigating the illicit diamond trade through the International Diamond Security Organisation. Fleming met Sillitoe and used {{much of the research}} as background material for his fictional Bond novel, Diamonds Are Forever.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{three-dimensional}} vibratory strengthening <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> {{technology was}} used to strengthen <b>and</b> <b>polish</b> aeroengine blades with complicated surfaces. At first, {{the principle of the}} strengthening <b>and</b> <b>polishing</b> process was introduced, which combined strengthening process with polishing process. Then, the technological parameters influenced on the surface quality were investigated. The principal variables were the media hardness, the frequency and amplitude of the vibration, and duration of the vibratory strengthening <b>and</b> <b>polishing.</b> The optimum parameters were obtained. Experimental results revealed that, after strengthening <b>and</b> <b>polishing,</b> the surface roughness of aeroengine blades was reduced from Ra 0. 35 - 0. 5 µm to Ra 0. 1 - 0. 12 µm, and fatigue strength was increased by approximately 50 %...|$|R

5|$|Because {{germanium}} is transparent in {{the infrared}} wavelengths, {{it is an important}} infrared optical material that can be readily cut <b>and</b> <b>polished</b> into lenses and windows. It is especially used as the front optic in thermal imaging cameras working in the 8 to 14micron range for passive thermal imaging and for hot-spot detection in military, mobile night vision, and fire fighting applications. It is used in infrared spectroscopes and other optical equipment that require extremely sensitive infrared detectors. It has a very high refractive index (4.0) and must be coated with anti-reflection agents. Particularly, a very hard special antireflection coating of diamond-like carbon (DLC), refractive index 2.0, is a good match and produces a diamond-hard surface that can withstand much environmental abuse.|$|E

5|$|Once {{purchased}} by Sightholders (which is a trademark term {{referring to the}} companies that have a three-year supply contract with DTC), diamonds are cut <b>and</b> <b>polished</b> in preparation for sale as gemstones ('industrial' stones are regarded as a by-product of the gemstone market; they are used for abrasives). The cutting and polishing of rough diamonds is a specialized skill that is concentrated in {{a limited number of}} locations worldwide. Traditional diamond cutting centers are Antwerp, Amsterdam, Johannesburg, New York City, and Tel Aviv. Recently, diamond cutting centers have been established in China, India, Thailand, Namibia and Botswana. Cutting centers with lower cost of labor, notably Surat in Gujarat, India, handle a larger number of smaller carat diamonds, while smaller quantities of larger or more valuable diamonds {{are more likely to be}} handled in Europe or North America. The recent expansion of this industry in India, employing low cost labor, has allowed smaller diamonds to be prepared as gems in greater quantities than was previously economically feasible.|$|E
5|$|Another Avogadro constant-based approach, {{known as}} the International Avogadro Coordination's Avogadro project, would define and {{delineate}} the kilogram as a 93.6mm diameter sphere of silicon atoms. Silicon was chosen because a commercial infrastructure with mature processes for creating defect-free, ultra-pure monocrystalline silicon already exists to service the semiconductor industry. To make a practical realization of the kilogram, a silicon boule (a rod-like, single-crystal ingot) would be produced. Its isotopic composition would be measured with a mass spectrometer to determine its average relative atomic mass. The boule would be cut, ground, <b>and</b> <b>polished</b> into spheres. The size of a select sphere would be measured using optical interferometry to an uncertainty of about 0.3nm on the radius—roughly a single atomic layer. The precise lattice spacing between the atoms in its crystal structure (≈192pm) would be measured using a scanning X-ray interferometer. This permits its atomic spacing to be determined with an uncertainty of only three parts per billion. With {{the size of the}} sphere, its average atomic mass, and its atomic spacing known, the required sphere diameter can be calculated with sufficient precision and low uncertainty to enable it to be finish-polished to a target mass of one kilogram.|$|E
