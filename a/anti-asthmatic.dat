40|$|Thesis (M. Pharm.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. During 2004 the South African Pharmaceutical sector {{experienced}} a drastic {{change in the}} pricing system of pharmaceuticals. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse the usage and cost associated with asthma medication according to a medicine claims database. A quantitative retrospective drug utilisation research design was used to evaluate the usage patterns and costs associated with asthma-related drugs. The asthma-related drugs included for this study were the bronchodilators and the <b>anti-asthmatics.</b> The data for one year (1 January 2004 to 31 December 2004) were extracted from a medicine claims database. The study period was divided into three time periods, namely January to April, May to August and September to December. From January to April there were no limitations on the pricing structure of medicine (pre-single exit price). The new legislation came into effect in May 2004 and changed the pricing structure of medication. May to August is referred to as the interim period, where the new regulations was to be phased in. As from September 2004 the new pricing regulation was "fully" implemented, therefore September to December can be referred to as the post-single exit price period. Asthma is diagnosed on the basis of certain signs and symptoms, which can be substantiated by a clinical investigation. Asthma medicine represented 4. 46 % (N = 115 684) of medicine prescribed on the medicine claims database (N = 2 595 254) and 18. 40 % of all respiratory system medicine (N = 628 754). In comparison with the total database (33. 49 %, N = 5 305 882), the generic substitution of asthma medication is far less, representing 24. 18 % of medication prescribed for asthma. The data clearly indicate the decrease in average price per item for both groups of asthma-related medication. The price showed a decrease of 19. 53 % with the implementation of the single exit price for the bronchodilators and 10. 40 % for <b>anti-asthmatics.</b> A further decrease from the SEP price of the bronchodilators and the <b>anti-asthmatics,</b> respectively 14. 74 % and 13. 64 %, indicates the price reducing effect of the legislation on medicine cost.

40|$|Background: Repeat {{prescribing}} used {{in long-term}} pharmacotherapy is {{often associated with}} inadequate patient medication, including non-adherence. In this paper we explore patients' drug refill adherence with repeat prescriptions and relate refill data to patient age and gender, type of prescriber, type of prescribed drug, and reimbursement level. Methods: During one week of 2002, copies of 3636 repeat prescriptions filled at 16 large Swedish pharmacies were collected. Satisfactory refill adherence was defined as dispensed refills covering 80 - 120 % of the prescribed treatment time. Under- and oversupplying were defined as 120 % coverage, respectively. Result: The average level of refill adherence was 57 %, and the level of under- and oversupplying 21 % and 22 %, respectively. There was no gender difference. Patients who were exempt from payment had higher oversupplies than others (33 % versus 19 %), and patients of general practitioners had higher refill adherence than patients of hospital physicians. The highest refill adherence was observed for contraceptives (81 %) and the lowest for <b>anti-asthmatics,</b> proton pump inhibitors and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (30 - 40 %). Conclusions: Refill non-adherence includes both under- and oversupplying and may vary due to different attitudes between prescribers and between patients.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the risk of being {{involved}} in road traffic accidents as drivers among persons using prescribed medicines by utilizing data from population-based registries. The aim of the present paper was to focus on the methodology used in the study. Methods: All Norwegians aged 18 - 69 in April 2004 to September 2006 (3. 1 million), were included in the study. Information on prescriptions, road accidents and emigrations/deaths was obtained from three different population-based registries. A total of 22, 000 accidents were observed. The incidence of accidents in exposed and unexposed person-time was compared, by the standardized incidence ratio (SIR). Results: The risk of being involved in an accident was increased in persons exposed for prescribed medicines. The risk was markedly increased in persons exposed for natural opium alkaloids, benzodiazepine tranquillizers, benzodiazepine hypnotics and carisoprodol. A marginal increase or unchanged SIRs were found for NSAIDs, selective beta- 2 -adrenoreceptor agonists (<b>anti-asthmatics),</b> calcium receptor antagonists and penicillin. Conclusions: We have tested a method using different reference groups and different exposure periods to explore the association between drug use and involvement in traffic accidents. Using these methods, we have shown that exposure for prescribed opiates, benzodiazepines and carisoprodol increased the risk of being involved in an accident as driver. The findings confirm results from other studies. Further steps should be taken to reduce car driving under the influence of these drugs. </p...|$|R
40|$|Introduction Research on {{associations}} between medication use during pregnancy and congenital anomalies is significative {{for assessing the}} safe use of a medicine in pregnancy. Congenital anomaly (CA) registries do not have optimal information on medicine exposure, in contrast to prescription databases. Linkage of prescription databases to the CA registries is a potentially effective method of obtaining accurate information on medicine use in pregnancies {{and the risk of}} congenital anomalies. Methods We linked data from primary care and prescription databases to five European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies (EUROCAT) CA registries. The linkage was evaluated by looking at linkage rate, characteristics of linked and non-linked cases, first trimester exposure rates for six groups of medicines according to the prescription data and information on medication use registered in the CA databases, and agreement of exposure. Results Of the 52, 619 cases registered in the CA databases, 26, 552 could be linked. The linkage rate varied between registries over time and by type of birth. The first trimester exposure rates and the agreements between the databases varied for the different medicine groups. Information on anti-epileptic drugs and insulins and analogue medicine use recorded by CA registries was of good quality. For selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, <b>anti-asthmatics,</b> antibacterials for systemic use, and gonadotropins and other ovulation stimulants, the recorded information was less complete. Conclusion Linkage of primary care or prescription databases to CA registries improved the quality of information on maternal use of medicines in pregnancy, especially for medicine groups that are less fully registered in CA registries...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} and representative nationwide general practice database was explored to study associations between atopic disorders and prescribed medication in children.

Atopic children with atopic eczema, asthma and allergic rhinitis (AR) were matched with controls (not diagnosed {{with any of these}} disorders) within the same general practice on age and gender. Logistic regression analyses were performed to study the differences in prescribed medication between both groups by calculating odds ratios (OR); 93 different medication groups were studied. A total of 45, 964 children with at least one atopic disorder were identified and matched with controls. Disorder-specific prescriptions seem to reflect evidence-based medicine guidelines for atopic eczema, asthma and AR. However, these disorder-specific prescriptions were also prescribed for children who were not registered as having that specific disorder. For eczema-related medication, about 3. 7 - 8. 4 % of the children with non-eczematous atopic morbidity received these prescriptions, compared to 1. 4 - 3. 5 % of the non-atopic children. The same pattern was observed for <b>anti-asthmatics</b> (having non-asthmatic atopic morbidity: 0. 8 - 6. 2 % vs. controls: 0. 3 - 2. 1 %) and AR-related medication (having non-AR atopic morbidity: 4. 7 - 12. 5 % vs. controls: 2. 8 - 3. 1 %).

5000|$|Water-in-water (W/W) {{emulsion}} is {{a system}} that consists of droplets of water-solvated molecules in another continuous aqueous solution; both the droplet and continuous phases contain different molecules that are entirely water-soluble. As such, when two entirely aqueous solutions containing different water-soluble molecules are mixed, water droplets containing predominantly one component are dispersed in water solution containing another component. Recently, such a water-in-water emulsion was demonstrated to exist and be stable from coalescence by the separation of different types of non-amphiphilic, but water-soluble molecular interactions. [...] These molecular interactions include hydrogen bonding, pi stacking, and salt bridging. This w/w emulsion was generated when the different water-solvated molecular functional groups get segregated in an aqueous mixture consisting of polymer and liquid crystal molecules. This water-in-water emulsion consists of liquid crystals suspended as water-solvated droplets dispersed in a solution of polymer whose solvent is also water. The liquid crystal component of the emulsion is disodium cromolyn glycate (DSCG). This molecule is an <b>anti-asthmatic</b> drug, but also exists as a special type of liquid crystal when the concentration of DSCG is ~9-21 wt%. Unlike conventional lyotropic liquid crystals which consist of oily molecules such as 5CB, DSCG molecules are not amphiphilic, but entirely water-soluble. Thus, the separation of hydrophobic/hydrophilic groups cannot be applied to DSCG. The polymer solution serves as the medium or continuous phase of the w/w emulsion. Apart from being water-soluble, one important criterium for the generation of this w/w emulsion system is that the polymer cannot bear functional groups that interact strongly with DSCG. As such, ionic polymer when mixed with DSCG does not form w/w emulsion, but gives rise to a homogeneous solution or a precipitate solution. Consequently, the known polymers that afford w/w emulsion include polyacrylic amides and polyols. Surprisingly, some of these water-in-water emulsions can be exceptionally stable from coalescence for up to 30 days. Because molecules of liquid crystal assume a preferred common orientation among themselves, the overall orientation of liquid crystals in a droplet is only stable in certain configurations (Fig. 3). As water solvated droplets in a w/w emulsion, DSCG molecules would align in a preferred direction {{on the surface of the}} droplet. To minimize the overall energy of the system, the DSCG molecules in the droplet prefer to align either parallel or perpendicular to the surfaces of the droplets.(Fig. 4A,B).The stability of this water-in-water emulsion from coalescence is attributed to three molecular forces: 1. The separation of different molecular forces at the beginning of the droplet formation. Similar forces tend to stay together: pi-stacking and salt bridging are the two dominant forces in the liquid crystal droplet phase, while hydrogen bonding governs in the continuous polymer phase.|$|E

Objective Estimate the use of <b>anti-asthmatics</b> prescriptions in the paediatric population and to evaluate its association with children’s and physician’s characteristics. Methods The study was conducted in 728, 830 children 1 - 14 years old residing in the Lazio region,Central Italy. Individual data on AA (ATC R 03) prescriptions during 2009 were used. Prevalence was calculated according to children’s gender, age and area of residence. The association, in terms of rate ratio (RR), between AA prescription with children’s and physicians’ characteristics was estimated by multi level Poisson models. Results Overall, 404, 239 AA prescriptions were given to 178, 850 (25 %) children with the highest frequency in the 1 - 2 age group (39 %). Boys were more likely to receive a prescription than girls. Beclomethasone was the most prescribed active ingredient (34 %), followed by salbutamol (24 %); 44 % of children ³ 6 years old had only 1 box prescription in the year, 48. 9 % of these subjects were treated with inhaled corticosteroids alone. Children’s gender, age and area of residence were the major determinants in drug prescription while, as far as physicians’ level,  gender and number of patients in charge were associated to a greater probability of getting an AA prescription.

40|$|MPharm (Pharmacy Practice), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Asthma is {{a chronic}} {{disease of the}} airways and affects many people {{regardless}} of their age, gender, race and socioeconomic status. Since asthma is recognised {{as one of the}} major causes of morbidity and mortality in people and especially in South Africa, the prescribing patterns, prevalence and medication cost of asthma in South Africa are saliently important and need to be investigated. A non-experimental, quantitative retrospective drug utilisation review was conducted on medicine claims data of a pharmaceutical benefit management company in a section of the private health care sector of South Africa. The study period was divided into four annual time periods (1 January 2008 to 31 December 2008, 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2009, 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2010 and 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011). The prescribing patterns and cost of asthma medication were investigated and stratified according to province, age and gender. Patients were included if the prescriptions which were provided by the health care practitioners matched the Chronic Disease List (CDL) of South Africa and the International Classification of Disease (ICD- 10) coding for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Data analysis was conducted by means of the SAS 9. 3 ® computer package. Asthma patients were divided according to different age groups (there were five different age groups for this study), gender and geographical areas of South Africa. The study indicated a steady increase in the prevalence of asthma patients from 0. 82 % (n = 7949) in 2008 to 1. 18 % (n = 15 423) in 2009 and reached a minimum of 0. 79 % (n = 8554) in 2011. Analysis of the prevalence regarding geographical areas in South Africa suggested that Gauteng had the highest number [n = 17 696, (0. 85 %) ] of asthma patients throughout the study period, followed by KwaZulu Natal [n = 8 628, 1. 16 %) ] and the Western Cape [(n = 8513, 0. 97 %) (p 0. 05). The results showed that asthma was not as common chronic disease in children. The total number of asthma patients younger than 7 years represented 0. 64 % (n = 2 909). It was found that patients over 65 years of age showed the highest prevalence of the five age groups [1. 94 % (n = 13 403) (p < 0. 05) ]. The average number of asthma prescriptions per patient per year was 8. 28 (95 % CI, 8. 16 - 8. 40) and 5. 15 (95 % CI, 5. 06 - 5. 23) in 2008 and 2011, respectively. The number of asthma items per prescription varied from 1. 55 (95 % CI, 1. 55 - 1. 56) in 2008 to 1. 40 (95 % CI, 1. 39 - 1. 40) in 2011. Medication from the MIMS® pharmacological group (<b>anti-asthmatics</b> and bronchodilators) was used to identify asthma medication. The top three asthma medication with the highest prevalence in the study period were the anti-inflammatory inhaler of fluticasone (n = 39 721) followed by the single item combination product of budesonide/ formoterol (n = 25 121) and salbutamol (n = 24 296). The influence of COPD on asthma treatment and the costimplication thereof were investigated. Medication from the MIMS® pharmacological group (<b>anti-asthmatics</b> and bronchodilators) was used to identify COPD medication. This study also showed that COPD had an influence in the economic burden of the South African asthma population. The cost of medication is responsible for the single largest direct cost involved in the economic burden of asthma. This study showed that asthma represented 0. 88 % of the direct medication cost in the study (excluding hospitalisation and indirect cost). The average cost per prescription and average cost per asthma item both increased throughout the study period. The prescribing patterns for the different medication used in the treatment of asthma were investigated and recommendations for further research in this field of study were made. Master...|$|R

The number of brands went from 27 in 1999 to 34 in 2010, with a generic share increasing from 55. 55 % to 70. 59 %. The number of <b>anti-asthmatic</b> pharmaceutical preparations increased from 57 to 64 during the same period, of which 31 and 42 were generic preparations. In 2010, the total cost of <b>anti-asthmatic</b> dugs was about 22 million euro, the generics representing 14 million euro. Conclusion: Despite the introduction of a compulsory insurance scheme called “AMO”, that allows a refund for 69. 5 % of <b>anti-asthmatic</b> specialties marketed in Morocco, <b>anti-asthmatic</b> generic drug consumption remains limited. The Moroccan market is still largely dominated by the originator drugs with still valid patents...|$|E

40|$|Objective To study, {{in a large}} cohort, the {{association}} {{between the use of}} <b>anti-asthmatic</b> drugs during pregnancy and pregnancy complications. Methods Using the Swedish Medical Birth Register, we identified 24, 369 women who reported the use of <b>anti-asthmatic</b> drugs in early pregnancy and 7778 women who were prescribed such drugs later during pregnancy by antenatal care system centres, during the period July 1, 1995 up to and including 2004. We studied maternal characteristics and pregnancy and delivery complications. Comparisons were made with all women having given birth to a child recorded in the register during this period. Results Women using <b>anti-asthmatic</b> drugs were characterized by a young maternal age, low parity, increased rate of smoking, low education, and high body mass index. An association with subfertility was also observed. Pre-existing diabetes did not occur in excess. A number of pregnancy and delivery complications occurred at an increased rate with the use of <b>anti-asthmatic</b> drugs, notably when three or more such drugs had been used: gestational diabetes [odds ratio (OR) = 1. 59], preeclampsia (OR= 1. 44), haemorrhage at delivery (OR= 1. 32) and premature rupture of membranes (OR= 1. 59); no excess of placenta abruption or previa was found. Primary weak contractions occurred more often than expected in women that used <b>anti-asthmatic</b> drugs (OR= 1. 15), and this was tentatively linked to the use of beta- 2 adrenergic agonists. Most of the increased risk for caesarean section (OR= 1. 79) could be explained by these pregnancy complications. An increased risk for delivery induction (OR= 1. 74) was found among deliveries that did not start with a caesarean section. Conclusion An increase risk of pregnancy complications occurs with the use of <b>anti-asthmatic</b> drugs by pregnant women, which results in an increased rate of caesarean sections...|$|E
40|$|The Author(s) 2015. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Background Data on {{the prevalence of}} adverse drug event (ADE) -related emergency department (ED) visits in developing countries are limited. Malaysia is located in South-East Asia, and, to our knowledge, no information exists on ADE-related ED visits. Objective The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the prevalence, preventability, severity, and outcome of drug-related ED visits. Methodology A cross-sectional study was conducted in consenting patients who visited the ED of Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia over a 6 -week period. The ED physician on duty determined whether or not the visit was drug related according to set criteria. Other relevant information was extracted from the patient’s medical folder by a clinical pharmacist. Results Of the 434 consenting patients, 133 (30. 6 %; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 26 – 35 %) visits were determined to be ADE related; 55. 5 % were considered preventable, 11. 3 % possibly preventable, and 33. 1 % not preventable. Severity was classed as mild in 1. 5 %, moderate in 67. 7 %, and severe in 30. 8 %. The most common ADEs reported were drug therapeutic failure (55. 6 %) and adverse drug reactions (32. 3 %). The most frequently implicated drugs were antidiabetics (n = 31; 23. 3 %), antihypertensives (n = 28; 21. 1 %), antibiotics (n = 13; 9. 8 %), and <b>anti-asthmatics</b> (n = 11; 8. 3 %). A total of 93 patients (69. 9 %) were admitted to the ED for observation, 25 (18. 8 %) were discharged immediately after consultation, and 15 (11. 3 %) were admitted to the ward through the ED. Conclusion The prevalence of ADE-related ED visits was high; more than one-half of the events were considered preventable and one-third was classed as severe. As such, preventive measures will minimize future occurrences and increase patient safety. Key Points Three in ten patients seeking care at the emergency department of a teaching hospital in Malaysia were for events associated with drug use. Drug therapeutic failure due to medication non-adherence was the most commonly reported adverse drug event. ...|$|R
40|$|R-phenylacetylcarbinol (PAC) {{is used as}} a {{precursor}} for production of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, which are <b>anti-asthmatics</b> and nasal decongestants. PAC is produced from benzaldehyde and pyruvate mediated by pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC). A strain of Rhizopus javanicus was evaluated for its production of PDC. The morphology of R. javanicus was influenced by the degree of aeration/agitation. A relatively high specific PDC activity (328 U decarboxylase g- 1 mycelium) was achieved when aeration/agitation were reduced significantly in the latter stages of cultivation. The stability of partially purified PDC and crude extract from R. javanicus were evaluated by examining the enzyme deactivation kinetic in various conditions. R. javanicus PDC was less stable than Candida utilis PDC currently used in our group. A kinetic model for the deactivation of partially purified PDC extracted from C. utilis by benzaldehyde (0 ? 00 mM) in 2. 5 M MOPS buffer has been developed. An initial lag period prior to deactivation was found to occur, with first order dependencies of PDC deactivation on exposure time and on benzaldehyde concentration. A mathematical model for the enzymatic biotransformation of PAC and its associated by-products has been developed using a schematic method devised by King and Altman (1956) for deriving the rate equations. The rate equations for substrates, product and by-products have been derived from the patterns for yeast PDC and combined with a deactivation model for PDC from C. utilis. Initial rate and biotransformation studies were applied to refine and validate a mathematical model for PAC production. The rate of PAC formation was directly proportional to the enzyme activity level up to 5. 0 U carboligase ml- 1. Michaelis-Menten kinetics were determined for the effect of pyruvate concentration on the reaction rate. The effect of benzaldehyde on the rate of PAC production followed the sigmoidal shape of the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model. The biotransformation model, which also included a term for PDC inactivation by benzaldehyde, was used to determine the overall rate constants for the formation of PAC, acetaldehyde and acetoin. Implementation of digital pH control for PAC production in a well-stirred organic-aqueous two-phase biotransformation system with 20 mM MOPS and 2. 5 M dipropylene glycol (DPG) in aqueous phase resulted in similar level of PAC production [1. 01 M (151 g l- 1) in an organic phase and 115 mM (17. 2 g l- 1) in an aqueous phase after 47 h] to the system with a more expensive 2. 5 M MOPS buffer...|$|R
40|$|Adverse drug events (ADEs) are a {{significant}} cause of patient morbidity and hospital admissions. There are many studies in this area in Western countries. However, {{little is known about}} the prevalence and patterns of such events in Malaysia. Health care professionals are in the best position to reduce and prevent adverse drug events. In order to devise preventive strategies based on the prevalence studies, it is important to understand the current practices of health care professionals in this area. This study aimed to determine the different occurrences of ADEs in a Malaysian public hospital as well as the experiences of some Malaysian pharmacists’ of ADEs. A study of an observational chart review determined the prevalence of adverse drug event-related admissions in a tertiary public hospital and drugs implicated in such. This was achieved through a prospective review of the patients’ medical notes and charts in two medical wards. All cases were assessed using a classification tool which was developed after a pilot study. Following this, a postal survey of some Malaysian pharmacists explored their experiences about ADEs: the types of ADEs they have observed, actions taken in response to these incidents and their awareness of and involvement in adverse drug reaction reporting, and their attitudes towards this task. Both studies revealed that the occurrence of adverse drug events was high in Malaysia – the chart review study found that 39 % of admissions to two medical wards were related to ADEs whilst more than half of the sample pharmacists revealed having observed them in their daily work activities. Moreover, cardiovascular drugs, anti-diabetics, <b>anti-asthmatics,</b> and analgesics were responsible for more than 80 % of the admissions related to an ADE. Similar drug classes were also associated with ADEs as recounted by the pharmacists. Moreover they claimed to have communicated with patients about ADEs: on the ADE experienced by a patient, proper use of medicine, importance of adherence, alternate medicines and other appropriate measurements. Although more than 80 % hospital and clinic pharmacists claimed to have reported adverse drug reactions, less than 20 % of community pharmacists have claimed sending a report. This may have resulted from their lack of awareness of the procedures and processes of reporting an adverse drug reaction. Compared to other countries, the prevalence of ADEs is higher in Malaysia. It remains to be an important cause of patient injury and hospital admissions. Some useful strategies such as educational intervention on main causes of adverse drug events, monitoring of patients, and appropriate prescribing should be targeted at all health care professionals to prevent its likely future occurrences. Pharmacists play an important role in preventing ADEs by providing education and counselling to patients. Furthermore, as they were able to identify ADEs in their daily work activities, they should be included in any prevention programs. Documenting ADEs and interventions taken in relation to those ADEs should be encouraged, as this will be useful in monitoring the occurrence of ADEs and sharing the documented information with others could improve awareness and therefore improve prevention...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{the choice of}} drugs {{as well as the}} dosage forms of <b>anti-asthmatic</b> drugs in children with regard to different age groups. Methods: Cross-sectional study based on computerized pharmacy dispensing records of 1999 for children aged 0 - 16 years in the north of the Netherlands. All children were selected and divided in the following age groups: 0 - 1, 2 - 5, 6 - 11 and 12 - 16 -year-olds. Results: Inhaled beta 2 -agonists and inhaled corticosteroids were the most widely used <b>anti-asthmatic</b> drugs in all age groups (respectively 59 and 58 users per 100 <b>anti-asthmatic</b> using 0 - 16 year-olds). Cromones were rarely used. Up to four years of age the use of treatment with aerosol inhalers increased simultaneously with a decrease of oral dosage forms. The use of dry powder inhalers started at the age of approximately 4 years old and increased to about 85 % of the users at the age of 11, with the strongest increase around the age of 6 and 7. Conclusion: The choice of drugs and dosage forms corresponds with what might be expected based on guidelines for the treatment of asthma in children, except for the high use of deptropine in the youngest age group. <b>Anti-asthmatic</b> drugs for preventive treatment are used so frequently without beta 2 -agonists that questions about possible overtreatment need to be raised...|$|E

MethodsFor <b>anti-asthmatic</b> activity, male and female guinea pigs with average body weight of (451. 4  ±  118. 1) g were divided into six groups of six animals each. Group 1 served as control (distilled water); Group 2 was administered with salbutamol (reference drug) only; Group 3 served as ovalbumin sensitized group, Group 4, 5 and 6 were treated with A.  difformis extract at doses of 100, 200 and 400  mg/kg, respectively. Described methods were used to test fluid viscosity, fluid volume and quantitative phytochemistry analysis. Absorbance was read using a UV–Vis spectrophotometer and results computed in percentage. Total antioxidant assays [2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and lipid peroxidation assay], were carried out using reported procedures. ResultsThe <b>anti-asthmatic</b> evaluation showed that protection from asthma of the animals in Group 6 (400  mg/kg, 32. 7 %) were {{similar to that in}} Group 2 (salbutamol, 33. 0 %).
