5|$|Decompression {{theory is}} the study and {{modelling}} of {{the transfer of the}} inert gas component of breathing gases from the gas in the lungs to the tissues of the diver and back during exposure to variations in <b>ambient</b> pressure. In the case of underwater diving and compressed air work, this mostly involves <b>ambient</b> pressures greater than the local surface pressure—but astronauts, high altitude mountaineers, and occupants of unpressurized aircraft, are exposed to <b>ambient</b> pressures less than standard sea level atmospheric pressure. In all cases, the symptoms of decompression sickness occur during or within {{a relatively short period of}} hours, or occasionally days, after a significant reduction of <b>ambient</b> pressure.|$|E
5|$|Immersion {{in water}} and {{exposure}} to cold water and high pressure have physiological effects on the diver which limit the depths and duration possible in <b>ambient</b> pressure diving. Breath-hold endurance is a severe limitation, and breathing at high <b>ambient</b> pressure adds further complications, both directly and indirectly.

5|$|Compression of <b>ambient</b> air {{causes a}} {{temperature}} {{rise of the}} gas, proportional to the pressure increase. <b>Ambient</b> air is typically compressed in stages, and the gas temperature rises during each stage.

40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} the reachability problem for {{fragments of the}} Mobile <b>Ambients,</b> a powerful model for distributed and mobile computation. By using a connection with associative-commutative term rewriting, we prove that reachability is decidable in the open-free fragment of pure Mobile <b>Ambients</b> with name restriction and weak reduction semantics. Processes in this model have three sources of infiniteness: depth of <b>ambients,</b> width of parallel composition, and number of restricted names.

5|$|In <b>ambient</b> {{pressure}} diving, the diver {{is directly}} {{exposed to the}} pressure of the surrounding water. The <b>ambient</b> pressure diver may dive on breath-hold, or use breathing apparatus for scuba diving or surface-supplied diving, and the saturation diving technique reduces the risk of decompression sickness (DCS) after long-duration deep dives. Atmospheric diving suits (ADS) may be used to isolate the diver from high <b>ambient</b> pressure. Crewed submersibles can extend depth range, and remotely controlled or robotic machines can reduce risk to humans.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, the Canadian Defence and Civil Institute of Environmental Medicine {{developed}} the Kidd/Stubbs serial decompression model. This differs from Haldanian models which are parallel models {{and assume that}} all compartments are exposed to <b>ambient</b> partial pressures and no gas interchange occurs between compartments. A serial model assumes that the diffusion takes place {{through a series of}} compartments, and only one is exposed to the <b>ambient</b> partial pressures and is in effect a compartmentalised version of the Hempelman bulk diffusion slab model.|$|E

5|$|The {{combined}} {{concentrations of}} gases {{in any given}} tissue depend {{on the history of}} pressure and gas composition. Under equilibrium conditions, the total concentration of dissolved gases is less than the <b>ambient</b> pressure—as oxygen is metabolized in the tissues, and the carbon dioxide produced is much more soluble. However, during a reduction in <b>ambient</b> pressure, the rate of pressure reduction may exceed the rate at which gas is eliminated by diffusion and perfusion. If the concentration gets too high, it may reach a stage where bubble formation can occur in the supersaturated tissues. When the pressure of gases in a bubble exceed the combined external pressures of <b>ambient</b> pressure and the surface tension of the bubble-liquid interface, the bubbles grow, and this growth can damage tissue.|$|E
