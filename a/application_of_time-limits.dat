40|$|This report {{examines}} time-limited welfare {{beginning at}} the broadest level, tracing the rapid emergence <b>of</b> <b>time-limited</b> welfare as a policy approach in part I. Chapter 1 examines the history <b>of</b> <b>time-limited</b> welfare and the key challenges posed by this policy. Part II begins {{to focus on the}} three participating states [...] Florida, Vermont, and Wisconsin [...] describing the goals, evolution, and planning of the policies. Chapter 2 examines the roots of the three programs, characteristics of locations where the programs are operating, and attitudes and characteristics of welfare recipi(nts subject to the programs. These contextual factors have helped to shape the policies that are discussed in chapter 3 and implementation experiences that are examined in part III.

40|$|Toeplitz {{operators}} are fundamental and ubiquitous in signal processing and information theory {{as models for}} linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems.

40|$|A number <b>of</b> <b>time-limited</b> psychosocial {{interventions}} targeting social skills, internalizing {{and externalizing}} difficulties {{have been developed for}} children and young people with ASD. Increasingly more evidence is emerging that such interventions are effective in reducing difficulties and improving skills. However, large variability between studies and large individual heterogeneity in outcomes have been reported. Furthermore, there are concerns about the limited generalization of learnt skills. For example, what might be learnt in a training program in a clinical setting may not generalize to the school or home setting or even from one person to the next. In addition, experiences and difficulties in childhood are likely to be different from those in adolescence or adulthood and learnt skills to cope with such difficulties may not be transferable across different developmental periods. Furthermore, very little is known about potential mechanisms of change following these interventions. One possible effective "ingredient" to improve outcomes might be the active role and involvement of caregivers. In this update review paper, we summarize the current empirical evidence for the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>time-limited</b> psychosocial interventions for children and young people with ASD, examine how parents are involved in these interventions and the scientific evidence for the inclusion of caregivers in these interventions.

40|$|The {{present study}} investigates {{the role of}} {{attachment}} in a time-limited marital therapy. The study explores Brief Contextual Modular Psychotherapy (BCMT). This approach to practice provides a model that integrates principles and techniques from the major psychotherapies. BCMT can be distinguished from other brief therapies by its theoretical integration, its six-session time limit, its specific clinical focus, and its techniques for dealing with dissatisfaction and distress. The therapy sets out practice modules—six-session treatment plans—for a diverse range of presenting {{issues such as the}} anxiety disorders, depression, trauma, loss and grief, marriage and the phobias. BCMT emphasises the collaboration of the therapist and the client. A community-based psychological counselling centre has practised BCMT for over ten years, applying it in cases of wide diversity and maladjustment. Prior to this research, a comprehensive analysis of the theory underlying the BCMT model or the theory of change it endorses had not been carried out. The study provides {{a detailed description of the}} conceptual and treatment elements of the marital module developed in the treatment manual for BCMT. The study explores how the construct of attachment provides an organising framework or metaperspective for theory construction and therapeutic intervention in the clinical <b>application</b> <b>of</b> this <b>time-limited</b> marital therapy. To achieve this objective, one de-facto and four married couples participated in the time-limited therapy. They completed a questionnaire on adult attachment and also a self-report questionnaire to assess the effectiveness of the therapy. Narrative analysis was used to assess the praxis or the experience of participating in the therapy. The results show that the integrated model provided a treatment method for differing expressions of marital disturbance and psychopathology.;Three of the five couples and eight of the ten participants reported positive treatment outcomes. The research sample included the paraphilias, a major depressive episode with postpartum psychosis, the narcissistic borderline syndrome and childhood sexual abuse. The study supports the association between the role of adult attachment styles and intrapsychic responses in conflicted intimate relationships. From the point of view <b>of</b> clinical <b>applications</b> <b>of</b> attachment theory, the research highlights how theoretical ideas can be integrated, specific clinical methods can be incorporated and certain treatment perspectives can be derived from one another. Several implications for the treatment process flow from this integration. The integration of attachment theory in BCMT demonstrates how the therapeutic process progressed through three separate yet interrelated stages: past, present and future. In addition, it led to the identification of three stage-related mourning processes associated with the time-limited therapeutic process: protest, despair and detachment. From a clinical perspective, the research finds that the theoretical and treatment model does not need to be restricted to marital therapy. The findings suggest that the integrated model could be applied across a wide range of presenting issues. By defining the theory of personality and psychopathology and the therapeutic change processes associated with it, the integration of attachment theory results in BCMT taking its place in the literature as a theory of psychotherapy...|$|R

The {{problem has been}} worked out for two cases of channel modeling- the rational transfer function channel model and the distributed parameter channel model, using three methods of signal orthogonalization. For the rational function channel model, the signaling interval can be made arbitrarily small, thus permitting high signaling rates. For the distributed parameter channel model, the signaling rate works {{out to be a}} function of the line parameters and line length. At the receiving end, since the signals are orthogonal, a bank of matched filters separates the signals. The system performance has been evaluated in the presence of channel noise...|$|R
