5|$|In <b>a</b> <b>land</b> <b>where</b> {{approximately}} 90% of {{the original}} island forest has been destroyed, ruffed lemurs cling to {{only a small fraction}} of their original range. Completely dependent upon large fruiting trees, neither species appears to be flexible with its habitat choice, with selective logging resulting in significantly lower population densities. Although they can survive in very disturbed habitats with lower population densities, they are still especially vulnerable to habitat disturbance. Decreased genetic diversity, in tandem with hunting, natural disasters, predation, and disease, can easily wipe out small populations.|$|E

William says the children called their home St Martin's Land; Ralph adds that everything there was green. According to William, the children were unable to account for their arrival in Woolpit; they had been herding their father's cattle when they heard a loud noise (according to William, the bells of Bury St Edmunds) and suddenly found themselves by the wolf pit where they were found. Ralph says that they had become lost when they followed the cattle into a cave and, after being guided {{by the sound of}} bells, eventually emerged into our land.|$|E

25|$|The Religious Society of Friends {{formed in}} England in 1652 around leader George Fox. Quakers were {{severely}} persecuted in England for daring to deviate {{so far from}} Anglicanism. This reign of terror impelled Friends to seek refuge in New Jersey in the 1670s, formally part of New Netherland, where they soon became well entrenched. In 1681, when Quaker leader William Penn parlayed a debt owed by Charles II to his father into a charter for the Province of Pennsylvania, many more Quakers were prepared to grasp the opportunity to live in <b>a</b> <b>land</b> <b>where</b> they might worship freely. By 1685, as many as 8,000 Quakers had come to Pennsylvania. Although the Quakers may have resembled the Puritans in some religious beliefs and practices, they differed with them over the necessity of compelling religious uniformity in society.|$|E

25|$|The {{acclaimed}} German (later naturalized Swiss) writer Hermann Hesse wrote a {{short story}} in 1915 in which a young man is carried by a giant bird across a mountain range to a distant plain that is to him like another world. Strange News from Another Star tells of the horror experienced by this youth who has volunteered to go to find flowers to bury the dead from an earthquake; flowers that are required during the ceremony of the burial of the dead, in this young man's world, to ease a smooth transition into the next life. In order to speed his journey, he is carried across the mountains by this giant bird, but finds himself in <b>a</b> <b>land</b> <b>where</b> war has left the dead unburied and uncared for, a brutal world, perhaps {{like that of the}} trenches of World War I, a world that he can only believe is from his distant past. Hesse later went on to write the acclaimed novel Siddhartha, exploring the life of Buddha.|$|E
25|$|As {{a direct}} result of the Russo-Japanese War (1904/05), Japanese {{influence}} replaced Russia's in Inner Manchuria. During the war with Russia, Japan had mobilized one million soldiers to fight in Manchuria, meaning that one out of every eight families in Japan had a member fighting the war. During the Russian-Japanese war, the losses were heavy with Japan losing half-million men dead or wounded, making Manchuria into a sacred land for the Japanese people, a place hallowed with the blood of so many Japanese soldiers. From time of the Russian-Japanese war onward, many Japanese people came to have a proprietary attitude to Manchuria, taking the viewpoint that <b>a</b> <b>land</b> <b>where</b> so much Japanese blood had been lost in some way now belonged to them. In 1906, Japan laid the South Manchurian Railway to Port Arthur (Japanese: Ryojun). Under the terms of the Treaty of Portsmouth, the Kwantung Army had the right to occupy southern Manchuria while the region fell into the Japanese economic sphere of influence. The Japanese owned South Manchurian Railroad company had a market capitalization of 200 million yen, making it into Asia's largest corporation, which went beyond just running the former Russian railroad network in southern Manchuria to owning the ports, mines, hotels, telephone lines, and sundry other businesses, dominating the economy of Manchuria. With the growth of the South Manchuria Railroad company went growth in number of Japanese living in Manchuria from 16, 612 Japanese civilians in 1906 to 233,749 in 1930. The majority of the blue collar employees for the Mantetsu were Chinese, and the Japanese employees were mostly white collar, meaning the most of the Japanese living in Manchuria were middle-class people who saw themselves as an elite. Between World War I and World War II Manchuria became a political and military battleground between Russia, Japan, and China. Japan moved into Outer Manchuria as a result of the chaos following the Russian Revolution of 1917. A combination of Soviet military successes and American economic pressure forced the Japanese to withdraw from the area, however, and Outer Manchuria returned to Soviet control by 1925.|$|E

[...] Nina Darnton wrote that the plot of Labyrinth [...] "is very similar to Outside Over There by Mr. Sendak, in which 9-year-old Ida's baby sister is stolen by the goblins". Copies of Outside Over There and Where the Wild Things Are are shown briefly in Sarah's room {{at the start of the}} film, along with copies of Alice in Wonderland, The Wizard of Oz, a book by Hans Christian Andersen, Grimms' Fairy Tales and Walt Disney's Snow White.

[...] The Whether Man, for all his talk, is unable to provide Milo with the information or guidance the boy wants, while Officer Shrift's investigation of the overturning of the Word Market contains the forms of law, without justice. The denizens around Digitopolis are little better; the twelve-faced Dodecahedron, named for what he is, turns the logic of his naming on its head when he asks if everyone with one face is called Milo. The attitudes now displayed by the adherents of both brothers are summed up by the Dodecahedron, [...] "as long as the answer is right, who cares if the question is wrong?" ...|$|E

500|$|On 19September, General der Gebirgstruppe (Lieutenant General) Franz Böhme was {{appointed}} as Plenipotentiary Commanding General in Serbia, with direct responsibility for quelling the revolt, bringing {{with him the}} staff of XVIIIMountain Corps. He was allocated additional forces to assist him in doing so, reinforcing the three German occupation divisions already in the territory. These divisions were the 704th Infantry Division, 714th Infantry Division and 717th Infantry Division. Böhme boasted a profound hatred of Serbs and encouraged his predominantly Austrian-born troops to exact [...] "vengeance" [...] against them. His primary grievances were the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and subsequent Austro-Hungarian military defeats {{at the hands of}} the Royal Serbian Army, which he thought could only be rectified by the reprisal shooting of Serbian civilians.

500|$|Asturias shows how, {{under the}} {{conditions}} of dictatorship, characters slowly lose their human identities. The Zany, for instance, while fleeing the city, is described as running [...] "aimlessly, with his mouth opened and his tongue hanging out, slobbering and panting".

In what is in part {{a critique of the}} book, Jorge Barrueto argues that [...] depicts Latin America as a whole as [...] "Other". [...] Everyone from the President to the Zany displays this [...] "otherness" [...] as they cannot be civilized. Dictatorship produces Otherness, by dehumanizing its subjects, but is also itself presented as barbaric, absurd, and no more than an [...] "imitation of the European ways". [...] Thanks to phenomena such as dictatorship, Latin America appears to be <b>a</b> <b>land</b> <b>where</b> [...] "Otherness" [...] prevails and for this reason Latin America cannot [...] "evolve" [...] or reach truly European levels of modernity.

500|$|In 424, Kou {{took these}} texts {{with him to}} the Wei court. There, he was welcomed by Emperor Taiwu and {{garnered}} the support of Cui Hao, the prime minister. Even though Cui Hao was a Confucianist, he greatly admired Kou and was immediately drawn to him. Cui also appreciated Kou's mathematical skills and hoped that he might help him improve his own longevity techniques. They also shared a dream of a 'purified society,' <b>a</b> <b>land</b> <b>where</b> peace and justice prevailed. Kou's 'New Code' was promulgated throughout the realm, and a large altar was built near the capital where 120 Daoist practitioners performed rites and prayers daily. Cui gained a great deal of power in the court, and in 444 began to purge the Buddhist clergy. This led to a major persecution against Buddhists in 446. In 448, Kou Qianzhi was 'released' from his body, and Cui lost his greatest supporter at the court. Shortly after Kou's death, Cui had a national history of Wei dynasty containing unflattering portraits of its rulers carved in stone. This so enraged the emperor, that he had Cui executed in 450. [...] After Cui's execution, the Daoist community was forced to flee, with many of them settling at the Daoist center of Louguan.|$|E
