50|$|Between 1894 and 1991, {{a number}} of {{senators}} were elected by each provincial council of the nine provinces. The number was dependent on <b>a</b> <b>province's</b> population, and increased along {{with the increase in}} <b>a</b> <b>province's</b> population.|$|R
50|$|Normally, {{under the}} {{equalization}} scheme, equalization payments go down {{for every dollar}} increase in <b>a</b> <b>province's</b> ability to raise taxes. So, for example, if <b>a</b> <b>province's</b> economy booms and the provincial government's potential income tax revenues increase, equalization payments decrease. Economist Michael Smart has argued that this gives have-not <b>provinces</b> <b>an</b> incentive to raise taxes, because any harm higher taxes do to the economy is off-set by higher equalization payments.|$|R

5|$|As Rome's power waned, the Picts were emboldened. War bands raided {{south of}} Hadrian's Wall in earnest in 342, 360, and 365 and they participated with the Attacotti in the Great Conspiracy of 367. Rome fought back, {{mounting}} a campaign under CountTheodosius in 369 which reëstablished <b>a</b> <b>province</b> which was renamed Valentia {{in honor of}} the emperor. Its location is unclear, but it is sometimes placed on or beyond Hadrian's Wall. Another campaign was mounted in 384, but both were short-lived successes. Rome had fully withdrawn from Britain by 410, never to return.|$|E
5|$|Augustine consecrated Justus as {{a bishop}} in 604, over <b>a</b> <b>province</b> {{including}} the Kentish town of Rochester. The historian Nicholas Brooks {{argues that the}} choice of Rochester was probably not {{because it had been}} a Roman-era bishopric, but rather because of its importance in the politics of the time. Although the town was small, with just one street, it was at the junction of Watling Street and the estuary of the Medway, and was thus a fortified town. Because Justus was probably not a monk (he was not called that by Bede), his cathedral clergy was very likely non-monastic too.|$|E

5|$|During the Mexican War of Independence from 18101821, Texas {{experienced}} much turmoil. Governor Manuel María de Salcedo {{was overthrown}} by rebels in 1810, but persuaded his jailer to release him and assist him in organizing a counter-coup. Three years later, the Republican Army of the North, consisting primarily of Indians and Americans, again overthrew the Texas government and executed Salcedo. The Spanish response was brutal, and by 1820 fewer than 2000 Hispanic citizens remained in Texas. Spain {{was forced to}} relinquish its control of New Spain in 1821, with Texas becoming <b>a</b> <b>province</b> of the newly formed nation of Mexico, leading to the period in Texas history known as Mexican Texas.|$|E

5|$|Egypt became <b>a</b> <b>province</b> of the Roman Empire in 30BC, {{following}} {{the defeat of}} Marc Antony and Ptolemaic Queen Cleopatra VII by Octavian (later Emperor Augustus) in the Battle of Actium. The Romans relied heavily on grain shipments from Egypt, and the Roman army, {{under the control of}} a prefect appointed by the Emperor, quelled rebellions, strictly enforced the collection of heavy taxes, and prevented attacks by bandits, which had become a notorious problem during the period. Alexandria became an increasingly important center on the trade route with the orient, as exotic luxuries were in high demand in Rome.|$|E
5|$|From 1855 to 1907, the {{position}} of first minister was known as Premier. After the colony was granted dominion status, {{the position}} became known as Prime Minister.

5|$|He was disheartened {{with what}} he saw in Pernambuco, <b>a</b> <b>province</b> {{far away from the}} {{imperial}} capital, {{but one of the most}} important in the country. Local political bosses were aligned with the Party of Order or the Liberal Party, but these were mostly nominal affiliations. Local oligarchs had vied among themselves for centuries over power. To them, political principles, such as those preached by the national leaders of the Party of Order, meant little or nothing. Their political ambitions focused on patronage and the annihilation of their local rivals. Honório Hermeto found himself embroiled in an ongoing power struggle between the aristocratic planters, who sought to exercise control over provincial affairs.|$|E

5|$|In 1953, {{almost half}} of the Tories' {{campaign}} funds were spent in Quebec, <b>a</b> <b>province</b> in which the party won only four of seventy-five seats. After the 1953 election, Tory MP Gordon Churchill studied the Canadian federal elections since Confederation. He concluded that the Progressive Conservatives were ill-advised to continue pouring money into Quebec in an effort to win seats in the province; the Tories could win at least a minority government by maximizing their opportunities in English-speaking Canada, and if the party could also manage to win twenty seats in Quebec, it could attain a majority. Churchill's conclusions were ignored by most leading Tories—except Diefenbaker.|$|E
