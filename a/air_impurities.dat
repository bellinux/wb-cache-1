40|$|International audienceHYTEC is a {{reactive}} transport code developed at MINES ParisTech since 1996. Over {{the last few}} years, a new two-­‐phase flow module was embedded in HYTEC with emphasis on modularity and flexibility. Although based on the phase formulation of the flow problem, the method allows for the precise description of complex gases (multicomponent, non-­‐ ideal), their thermodynamic and hydrodynamic behaviors, and the coupling with water-­‐ rock interaction. The developed algorithm relies on several modules: the compressible multiphase flow problem (based on the fully implicit method), a complex thermodynamic operator (built on analytical modeling of equations of state, fluid property models and their derivatives), and a sequential iterative resolution of the {{reactive transport}}. The global coupling approach is organized around the sequential iterative call for two blocks: {{on the one hand}} two-­‐phase flow, gaseous transport and thermodynamic operator, on the other hand chemistry and aqueous and gaseous transport. The impact of phase consumption (gas dissolution, exsolution of dissolved gases) on hydrodynamics is explicitly described. Several applications are proposed to illustrate the behavior of the code. E. g., the simulation of an impure CO 2 injection in a homogeneous fully saturated reservoir (Figure 1) performed by Irina Sin during her PhD (Sin, 2015) displays some chromatographic effects due to differences in gas solubility. The gas current is formed by diffusion, advection-­‐dominated flow, and by density-­‐driven forces. In addition, the gas plume is enriched with less soluble gases (N 2, O 2 and H 2 O) at the two-­‐phase front (Figure 2); oppositely, more soluble SO 2 is depleted (Figure 3). Other applications can lay the basis for benchmarking exercises.

The {{blocking}} of fine-capillary tubes used as flow impedances in He 4 evaporation cryostats to achieve temperatures below 4. 2 K is generally attributed to nitrogen or <b>air</b> <b>impurities</b> entering these tubes from the main bath. The failure of even the most rigorous low-temperature laboratory best practices aimed at eliminating the problem by maintaining the cleanliness of the helium bath and preventing impurities from entering the capillary tubes suggests that a different cause is responsible for the inexplicable reduction of impedance flow. Many low-temperature research laboratories around the world have suffered this nuisance at a considerable financial cost {{due to the fact that}} the affected systems have to be warmed to room temperature in order to recover their normal low-temperature operation performance. Here, we propose an underlying physical mechanism responsible for the blockages based upon the freezing of molecular H 2 traces present in the liquid-helium bath. Solid H 2 accumulates at the impedance low-pressure side, and, after some time, it produces a total impedance blockage. The presence of H 2 traces is unavoidable due its occurrence in the natural gas wells where helium is harvested, forcing gas suppliers to specify a lower bound for impurity levels at about 100 ppb even in high-grade helium. In this paper, we present a simple apparatus to detect hydrogen traces present in liquid helium and easily check the quality of the liquid. Finally, we propose a solution to eliminate the hydrogen impurities in small- and large-scale helium recovery plants. The solution has been implemented in several laboratories that previously experienced a chronic occurrence of blocking, eliminating similar occurrences for more than one year.

Predictive equations are derived for pressure rise due to the radiolysis of water with air as a cover gas or with helium cover gas containing <b>air</b> as an <b>impurity</b> or mixtures of hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen as impurities. Radiation induced reaction products of nitrogen and oxygen are identified as the key to radiolysis behavior. The prevention of radiolysis depends on the exclusion of air or mixtures of nitrogen and oxygen from the system. Pure inert gases, helium, neon, and argon prove to be satisfactory radiolysis inhibitors. This is demonstrated for helium by inpile tests lasting up to 14 days (one reactor cycle) in the Plum Brook Reactor...|$|R
40|$|Actions Towards Sustainable Outcomes Environmental Issues/Principal Impacts The {{increasing}} urbanisation {{of cities}} {{brings with it}} several detrimental consequences, such as: • Significant energy use for heating and cooling many more buildings has led to urban heat islands and increased greenhouse gas emissions. • Increased amount of hard surfaces, which not only contributes to higher temperatures in cities, but also to increased stormwater runoff. • Degraded air quality and noise. • Health and general well-being of people is frequently compromised, by inadequate indoor air quality. • Reduced urban biodiversity. Basic Strategies In many design situations, boundaries and constraints limit the application of cutting EDGe actions. In these circumstances, designers should at least consider the following: • Living walls are an emerging technology, and many Australian examples function more as internal feature walls. However,as understanding of the benefits and construction of living walls develops this technology {{could be part of}} an exterior facade that enhances a building’s thermal performance. • Living walls should be designed to function with an irrigation system using non-potable water. Cutting EDGe Strategies • Living walls can be part of a design strategy that effectively improves the thermal performance of a building, thereby contributing to lower energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. • Including living walls in the initial stages of design would provide greater flexibility to the design, especially of the facade, structural supports, mechanical ventilation and watering systems, thus lowering costs. • Designing a building with an early understanding of living walls can greatly reduce maintenance costs. • Including plant species and planting media that would be able to remove <b>air</b> <b>impurities</b> could contribute to improved indoor air quality, workplace productivity and well-being.

40|$|Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) {{are highly}} porous, {{crystalline}} frameworks composed of an organic linker and a metal oxide cluster. Covalent Triazine Frameworks (CTFs) are a subclass of MOFs and similarly are highly porous crystalline frameworks, but unlike MOFs, {{are composed of}} purely organic building units. Since the initial reports of a successful synthesis and characterization of MOF- 5 in 1995, the interest in these frameworks has exploded. The ability to design the MOF properties and functionality by simply selecting the starting precursors make MOFs optimal materials for a multitude of fields. However, even {{with all of the}} research being conducted, there are many MOF applications yet to be discovered. In {{the first part of this}} thesis we explore the application of MOFs as templates for the synthesis of metallic nanostructures based on the size and the shape of the MOF pores. The limitless number of MOF structures with different pore shapes and sizes allow for the synthesis of nanostructures with any desired shape or size. It is shown that by using MOF- 545 with one dimensional pores, well aligned, ultra-thin gold and platinum nanowires are grown. The nanowires inside the MOF pores are confirmed by imaging the focus-ion beam cross-section of the metal loaded MOF- 545 using a transmission electron microscope. In the second part of this thesis, the use of MOFs as a precursor to fabricate nitrogen and metal co-doped carbons is discussed. MOF- 545 is an excellent precursor for one-pot synthesis of metal and nitrogen co-doped carbon wires. Two different annealing methods are studied, either under pure argon or argon mixed with <b>air</b> <b>impurities,</b> and the resulting carbon wires are tested as an electro-catalyst for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Surprisingly, the air treated carbon wires show much higher ORR activity, comparable to that of platinum in basic electrolyte. Finally, the last part of this thesis will discuss controlling the surface area and porosity of carbon frameworks fabricated from CTFs. By using three different precursors, 12 carbon networks are synthesized and analyzed for porosity, surface area and capacitance. By varying the precursor composition and ratio, as well as the temperature, we are able to control the average pore size distribution between 1 - 17 nm, while the samples treated at 900 ï¿½C show the best capacitance of 130 F/g...|$|E
40|$|The {{efficiency}} of the exhaust system is especially emphasised with a ventilated ceiling system where the exhaust is located at ceiling level. The removal {{efficiency of}} the total system must be guaranteed {{and the spread of}} impurities throughout the kitchen should be prevented. At the moment, none of the existing calculation standards are specially tailored for a kitchen ceiling environment. In the normal design practice, empirical knowledge of the existing installations together with heat load based calculation has been used for airflow rate determination. The starting point for this research was to study the effect of the thermal plumes and supply air systems on the efficiency of a ventilated ceiling. A special consideration was to analyze the effect of a capture jet on the contaminant removal efficiency. In that capture air concept, the air jet is projected horizontally across the ceiling, which helps to direct heat and <b>air</b> <b>impurities</b> towards the exhaust. From the practical point of view, the objective {{of this study was to}} develop a design process to compute the required air flow rate more accurately. In this study, the measured convection flows of kitchen appliances during idle and cooking modes were compared with the generic plume equation in which the virtual origin is constant. The generic plume equation derived in the region of complete flow similarity is not fully valid in the intermediate zone (0. 8 - 2. 0  m from appliances). Still, it is possible to reach a reasonable accuracy for practical applications with the adjusted virtual origin. The cooking process does not have any significant effect on the velocity and temperature distribution of the convection flow. The reason for this is that the mass flow rate of water during boiling is small compared with the induced air flow rate and therefore does not have a significant effect on the convection flow. Thus, the actual convection load and the product specific virtual origin can describe the plume during the cooking process. In the previous studies of thermal plumes, the velocity and temperature distribution factors are much higher than in the present study. In addition, the entrainment factors of the previous studies are much smaller than in this study. The measurements indicate that the heat gain has a significant effect on the spreading angle and the entrainment factor close to the heat source. The plumes with high heat gains are narrower and the convection flow induces more room air than the previous studies have pointed out. The {{efficiency of the}} exhaust system can be improved with a small capture jet installed at the ceiling surface. Both the measurement and simulated data give lower contaminant levels when the capture jet was introduced. The plume equation gives a platform to calculate the air flow rate that is theoretically required to remove the convective heat output of the appliance block. In this study, the flush-out factor of the supply air on the theoretical plume equation was derived for the centralized capture jet concept. For practical design work, the target for the containment removal efficiency should be 85  %. To obtain 85  % containment removal efficiency requires to a flush-out factor of 1. 2. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{summarizes}} the national inventory of mercury release into all media (<b>air,</b> water, land, <b>impurity</b> in products, general wastes and sector specific disposal) from South Korea, using UNEP mercury Toolkit. Total mercury input and release, distribution into different media, major contributors by source categories are discussed. The total quantified mercury release into different phase media was 284. 0 t/y and 281. 3 t/y in Level 1 and 2 estimation, respectively. Mercury release from primary metal production, waste incineration, extraction {{and use of}} fuels/energy sources were dominant. The replacement of output distribution factors in the Toolkit by real data from mass balance study in the anthropogenic sources resulted decrease in the share of mercury emission into air from 20. 6 % to 9. 6 %. Comparison of mercury releases into the atmosphere estimated by the Toolkit Level 2 with real distribution factors data and our earlier estimation with measurements in the selected industries showed only a little discrepancy, with reasonable variation. These differences are due {{to the use of}} efficient process technology and air pollution control devices. Since most mercury is released in waste and byproducts, recovery and safe storage issues are to be emphasized in the future studies...|$|R

40|$|In 2000, {{a bottle}} of dibutyl ether was {{discovered}} in a flammable storage cabinet in the Petrie Science building and was suspected to contain peroxides. A crystalline material had formed {{in the bottom of}} the bottle and appeared to be adhering to the sides close to the cap. Crystal formation is one of the indicators that peroxide has formed. The bottle was eventually removed by a waste disposal company and destroyed outside the campus. The disposal was an expensive process in addition to the disruption caused in the building and the time spent by Faculty members and DOHS hygienists. The purpose of this notice is to help laboratory users identify the types of chemicals that may form peroxides and the precautions that should be taken when using and storing these chemicals. Materials that are susceptible to peroxide formation are ones that typically react with <b>air,</b> moisture or <b>impurities</b> and produce a change in their chemical composition in normal storage. Peroxides may detonate with extreme violence when concentrated by evaporation or distillation, when combined with other compounds, or when disturbed by unusual heat, shock or friction. Chemicals that are sensitive to peroxide formation can be broken into three categories (Jackson, J. Chem. Ed., 1970), as shown in the following lists: A. Form potentially explosive peroxides without concentration. All have been responsible for fatalities. Test for peroxide formation or discard after 3 months. Isopropyl ethe...|$|R
