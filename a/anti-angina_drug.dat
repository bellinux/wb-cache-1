40|$|During {{the past}} 18 years, {{sildenafil}} {{has evolved from}} a potential <b>anti-angina</b> <b>drug</b> to an on-demand treatment for erectile dysfunction and more recently to a new orally active treatment for pulmonary hypertension. Recent {{studies suggest that the}} drug has powerful cardioprotective effect against ischemia/reperfusion injury, doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy and anti-hypertensive effect induced by chronic inhibition of nitric oxide synthase in animals. Based on several recent basic and clinical studies, it is clear that sildenafil and other clinically approved type- 5 phosphodiesterase- 5 inhibitors including vardenafil and tadalafil will eventually be developed for several cardiovascular indications including essential hypertension, endothelial dysfunction, ischemia/reperfusion injury, myocardial infarction, ventricular remodeling and heart failure...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Atrial {{fibrillation}} (AF) is {{a frequent}} occurrence with advancing age and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, the currently available AF therapies {{have a great deal}} of side effects. Areas covered: In this review, the authors discuss the evidence upon which the use of Ranolazine as an anti-arrhythmic drug is based. Specifically, the authors review the Phase I-III trials that studied ranolazine as potential treatment for AF. They also discuss the efficacy, safety, tolerability and side effects and compare the MERLIN TIMI 36, HARMONY and ROLE trials. Expert opinion: Although ranolazine is considered an <b>anti-angina</b> <b>drug,</b> it may also be, according to the available data, used in patients with AF. Ranolazine has anti-AF efficacy, both alone or in combination with other drugs such as amiodarone and dronedarone. Indeed, its efficacy has been demonstrated in various settings such as the termination of paroxysmal AF, the facilitation of AF electrical cardioversion, and postoperative AF prevention. Although there is a great deal of evidence from pioneering experimental studies, the clinical evidence of the AF-suppressing effect of ranolazine is derived from studies with small sample size or from secondary analyses. A better understanding of the role of ranolazine as an anti-AF drug will be obtained through larger, prospective, placebo-controlled clinical trials in different populations...|$|E
40|$|Coronary revascularization {{is not a}} {{suitable}} option for all patients with chronic stable angina (CSA) and, even when such a strategy is adopted, in conjunction with optimal medical therapy (OMT) as suggested by international guidelines, {{not all of them}} succeed to be symptom free. Importantly, this subset represents an increasing population, being widespread among diabetics and elderly. Irrespective of the mechanism responsible for myocardial ischemia, {{it has been shown that}} when ischemia develops it promotes substantial changes at the level of myocardial metabolism and reduces cardiac efficiency. Indeed, an increase in fatty acids (FFAs) oxidation and a decrease in glucose oxidation are both observed during myocardial ischemia, along with intracellular proton (H+) accumulation and enhanced oxygen consumption (O 2). In this scenario, therapeutic interventions that promote glucose utilization may improve cardiac efficiency and angina symptoms. This metabolic shift can be achieved by inhibiting fatty acid oxidation, stimulating glucose oxidation, or both. Anti-angina drugs exist that induce a cardiac metabolic shift from FFA oxidation toward glucose consumption, which, in turn, results in increased ATP generation per unit of O 2 consumption. Trimetazidine, a partial inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation, is a ‘metabolic'’ <b>anti-angina</b> <b>drug</b> that can improve symptoms in patients with chronic stable angina. This agent can be safely added to conventional therapy i. e., β-blockers (BBs), calcium channel blockers (CCBs), and nitrates. The safety and clinical benefits of trimetazidine have been known since the early 1980 s. Unfortunately, however, a relatively small group of European centres have access to this therapy...|$|E
5000|$|Inhalants are gases, aerosols, or {{solvents}} {{that are}} breathed in and absorbed through the lungs. While some [...] "inhalant" [...] drugs {{are used for}} medical purposes, {{as in the case}} of nitrous oxide, a dental anesthetic, inhalants are used as recreational drugs for their intoxicating effect. Most inhalant drugs that are used non-medically are ingredients in household or industrial chemical products that are not intended to be concentrated and inhaled, including organic solvents (found in cleaning products, fast-drying glues, and nail polish removers), fuels (gasoline (petrol) and kerosene), and propellant gases such as Freon and compressed hydrofluorocarbons that are used in aerosol cans such as hairspray, whipped cream, and non-stick cooking spray. A small number of recreational inhalant drugs are pharmaceutical products that are used illicitly, such as anesthetics (ether and nitrous oxide) and volatile <b>anti-angina</b> <b>drugs</b> (alkyl nitrites).|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: This study aims {{to compare}} use {{and costs of}} anti-secretory and {{cardiovascular}} co-medication in osteoarthritis patients treated with selective or non-selective NSAIDs. METHOD: A retrospective study examined Belgian patients aged 65 years or more who suffer from osteoarthritis and are chronic users of selective NSAIDs (n = 1, 376) or non-selective NSAIDs (n = 8, 482). A before-and-after analysis compared drug use and costs between period 1 (first 6 months of 2002) and period 2 (several 1 -year periods stretching over 2003 - 2004). A cohort analysis contrasted patients taking selective NSAIDs with patients taking non-selective NSAIDs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Anti-secretory co-medication included histamine H 2 -receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors. Cardiovascular co-medication referred to cardiac glycosides, anti-arrhythmics, anti-thrombotics, <b>anti-angina</b> <b>drugs,</b> anti-hypertensive drugs and serum-lipid-reducing drugs. Volume of drug use was expressed as number of packages and costs were computed in Euro. RESULTS: The volume of anti-secretory co-medication increased by 36 % with selective NSAIDs and by 55 % with non-selective NSAIDs between periods 1 and 2. Cardiovascular co-medication rose by 18 % with selective NSAIDs and by 12 % for non-selective NSAIDs. Focusing on patients who did not take anti-secretory co-medication in period 1, patients taking selective NSAIDs were {{just as likely to}} start anti-secretory co-medication in period 2 as patients taking non-selective NSAIDs (odds ratio: 1. 05; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 90 - 1. 23). Patients taking selective NSAIDs were just as likely to start cardiovascular co-medication as patients taking non-selective NSAIDs (odds ratio: 1. 03; 95 % confidence interval: 0. 78 - 1. 36). Annual costs of treating osteoarthritis in ambulatory care amounted to 756 with selective NSAIDs and 416 with non-selective NSAIDs. This originated from higher acquisition costs (278 vs. 24) and higher costs of co-medication (477 vs. 392) with selective NSAIDs. CONCLUSIONS: The use of selective and non-selective NSAIDs is accompanied by a higher use of co-medication over time. The increase in anti-secretory co-medication was more prominent with non-selective NSAIDs. The rise in cardiovascular co-medication was more pronounced with selective NSAIDs. Treatment of osteoarthritis with selective NSAIDs is more expensive than with non-selective NSAIDs in terms of acquisition costs and costs of co-medication. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Cardiovascular {{complications}} are {{a leading}} cause of mortality in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). The present study was designed to investigate the effects of trimetazidine (TMZ), an <b>anti-angina</b> <b>drug,</b> on transient outward potassium current (Ito) remodeling in ventricular myocytes and the plasma contents of free fatty acid (FFA) and glucose in DM. Sprague-Dawley rats, 8 weeks old and weighing 200 - 250 g, were randomly divided into three groups of 20 animals each. The control group was injected with vehicle (1 mM citrate buffer), the DM group was injected with 65 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ) for induction of type 1 DM, and the DM + TMZ group was injected with the same dose of STZ followed by a 4 -week treatment with TMZ (60 mg·kg- 1 ·day- 1). All animals were then euthanized and their hearts excised and subjected to electrophysiological measurements or gene expression analyses. TMZ exposure significantly reversed the increased plasma FFA level in diabetic rats, but failed to change the plasma glucose level. The amplitude of Ito was significantly decreased in left ventricular myocytes from diabetic rats relative to control animals (6. 25 ± 1. 45 vs 20. 72 ± 2. 93 pA/pF at + 40 mV). The DM-associated Ito reduction was attenuated by TMZ. Moreover, TMZ treatment reversed the increased expression of the channel-forming alpha subunit Kv 1. 4 and the decreased expression of Kv 4. 2 and Kv 4. 3 in diabetic rat hearts. These data demonstrate that TMZ can normalize, or partially normalize, the increased plasma FFA content, the reduced Ito of ventricular myocytes, and the altered expression Kv 1. 4, Kv 4. 2, and Kv 4. 3 in type 1 DM...|$|E
