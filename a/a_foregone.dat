The Social Democrats {{voted against the}} Senate's proposal while presenting an alternative declaration for sovereignty. The establishment of an independent state was not <b>a</b> <b>foregone</b> conclusion for the small Finnish nation; recognition by Russia and the European powers was essential. Svinhufvud accepted, {{that he had to}} negotiate with Lenin for Russian recognition. The socialists, reluctant to talks with the Russian leadership in July 1917, sent two delegations to Petrograd to ask Lenin to approve Finnish sovereignty.|$|E

However, as Teller's testimony was the most damning, he was singled out and blamed for the hearing's ruling, losing friends due to it, such as Robert Christy, who refused {{to shake his hand}} in one infamous incident. This was emblematic of his later treatment which resulted in his being forced into the role of an outcast of the physics community, thus leaving him little choice but to align himself with industrialists.|$|E

Although favoured by Garrett, Pollard's {{succession}} had not been <b>a</b> <b>foregone</b> conclusion. The Minister for the Army, John Cramer, attempted to appoint Major General Ivan Dougherty, a retired CMF officer, but the proposal was defeated in cabinet {{on the advice of}} the Minister for Defence, Athol Townley, who feared the antagonism it was likely to engender among the senior ranks of the Regular Army.|$|E

Kalam became the 11th president of the Republic of India in an easy victory, and moved into the Rashtrapati Bhavan after he was sworn in on 25 July. Kalam was the third President of India to have been honoured with a Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour, before becoming the President. Dr Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1954) and Dr Zakir Hussain (1963) were the earlier recipients of Bharat Ratna who later became the President of India.

5|$|The {{successful}} {{ending of}} the Vicksburg Campaign significantly degraded {{the ability of the}} Confederacy to maintain its war effort, as described in the Aftermath section of the campaign article. Some historians—e.g., Ballard, p.308—suggest that the decisive battle in the campaign was actually the Battle of Champion Hill, which, once won by Grant, made victory in the subsequent siege <b>a</b> <b>foregone</b> conclusion. This action (combined with the surrender of Port Hudson to Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks on July 9) yielded command of the Mississippi River to the Union forces, who would hold {{it for the rest of}} the conflict.|$|E
5|$|For a {{year and}} a half, Polish patriots waited while {{planning}} an insurrection. On March 24, 1794 in Kraków, Tadeusz Kościuszko declared {{what has come to be}} known as the Kościuszko Uprising. On May 7, he issued the Proclamation of Połaniec (Uniwersał Połaniecki), granting freedom to the peasants and ownership of land to all who fought in the insurrection. Revolutionary tribunals administered summary justice to those deemed traitors to the Commonwealth. After initial victories at the Battle of Racławice (April 4), the capture of Warsaw (April 18) and the Wilno (April 22)the Uprising was crushed when the forces of Russia, Austria and Prussia joined in a military intervention. Historians consider the Uprising's defeat to have been <b>a</b> <b>foregone</b> conclusion in face of the superiority in numbers and resources of the three invading powers. The defeat of Kościuszko's forces led in 1795 to the third and final partition of the Commonwealth.|$|E

5|$|Johnston took up cricket from {{an early}} age, playing with his elder brother Allan {{throughout}} the year on a backyard pitch on the family's dairy farm, owned by his father. Beeac's local team, which competed in the Colac District Association, occasionally had difficulty in assembling a full side. As a result, Johnston made his debut aged only twelve alongside his brother after an invitation from his schoolteacher. On debut, when a draw became <b>a</b> <b>foregone</b> conclusion, Johnston was allowed to bowl the final over, taking a wicket maiden. The following season, the brothers led Beeac's attack, continuing to do so after moving to Colac High School, where Bill became captain of the cricket and football teams and a prefect. Johnston left school at sixteen, working in Colac, before following Allan to Melbourne in 1939. He joined Richmond Cricket Club in the Third XI and took 6/16. After five games {{he was promoted to}} the Second XI, and made his first grade debut in the last game of the 1939–40 season. The following season, when nineteen, he was selected for Victoria's Sheffield Shield match against Queensland, but the Pearl Harbor attacks forced the cancellation of competitive cricket and the match did not go ahead. Johnston joined the Royal Australian Air Force along with his brother, serving for four years as a radar technician in northern Australia. It was at training camp that he first met Keith Miller. Johnston was not posted overseas, unlike his brother, who {{died in a plane crash}} in Ireland.|$|E

5000|$|California has a paid {{family leave}} benefit for {{employees}} who have paid into the state's State Disability Insurance fund, which pays part of <b>an</b> employee's <b>foregone</b> salary during leave {{up to a certain}} limit; the leave is therefore paid for by other wage earners and on a progressive basis (with no tax on capital or property earners, such as the owners of a corporation, to support the progressivity). [...] Thus the program has the same extra burden that Social Security and Medicare do, where the weight {{of the cost of the}} program, including the progressive benefits for low-income workers, is carried by middle and higher earned income workers.

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of Earth's carbon climate system depends critically upon interactions between rising atmospheric CO 2, changing land use, and nitrogen limitation on vegetation growth. Using a global land model, we show how these factors interact locally {{to generate the}} global land carbon sink over the past 200 [*]years. Nitrogen constraints were alleviated by N 2 fixation in the tropics and by atmospheric nitrogen deposition in extratropical regions. Nonlinear interactions between land use change and land carbon and nitrogen cycling originated from three major mechanisms: (i) <b>a</b> sink <b>foregone</b> that would have occurred without land use conversion; (ii) an accelerated response of secondary vegetation to CO 2 and nitrogen, and (iii) a compounded clearance loss from deforestation.

50|$|The {{development}} goal {{is related}} to Child Labour. Rights advocates regard child labour as a violation to numerous rights of a child such {{that it must be}} eradicated to ensure children's human rights are ends themselves while development economics views child labour as an inter-generational loss of potential income. Children suffer diminished human capital where reductions in health and education affect their future productivity. The International Labour Organization's (ILO's) estimates that current levels of child labour will result in <b>an</b> income <b>foregone</b> of $5 trillion between 2000 and 2020. Currently 23% of the world's children aged between 5 and 17 are engaged in some form of work. Betcherman demonstrates the important insights that economic analysis can provide in understanding how best to reduce child labour. Factors contributing to child labour can be seen in terms of incentives that encourage child work, constraints that compel children to work, and decisions that may not be made {{in the best interests of}} the children. Other factors must also be considered, direct (books, transport) and indirect (poor quality, loss of household labour) costs of education leading parents to regard education as not providing sufficient immediate returns to the household or child.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new way}} of measuring residual income, originally introduced by Magni (2000 a, 2000 b, 2000 c, 2001 a, 2001 b, 2003). Contrary to the standard residual income, the capital charge is equal to the capital lost by investors. The lost capital may be viewed as (<b>a)</b> the <b>foregone</b> capital, (b) the capital implicitly infused into the business, (c) the outstanding capital of a shadow project, (d) the claimholders' credit. Relations of the lost capital with book values and market values are studied, as well as relations of the lost-capital residual income with the classical standard paradigm; many appealing properties are derived, among which a property of earnings aggregation. Different concepts and results, provided by different authors in such different fields as economic theory, management accounting and corporate finance, are considered: O'Hanlon and Peasnell's (2002) unrecovered capital and Excess Value Created; Ohlson's (2005) Abnormal Earnings Growth; O'Byrne's (1997) EVA improvement; Miller and Modigliani's (1961) investment opportunities approach to valuation; Keynes's (1936) user cost; Drukarczyk and Schueler's (2000) Net Economic Income, Fernández's (2002) Created Shareholder Value, Anthony's (1975) profit. They are all conveniently reinterpreted within the theoretical domain of the lost-capital paradigm and conjoined in a unified view. The results found make this new theoretical approach a good candidate for firm valuation, incentive compensation, capital budgeting decision-making. ...|$|R
