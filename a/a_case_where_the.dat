5|$|The Kačić's {{family can}} be traced to the Pacta conventa, an {{agreement}} dating from 1102 (or later), according to which the Kačićs were one of the twelve Croatian noble tribes (genus) who accepted the Hungarian king Coloman as the new king of Croatia. They were represented by comes Juraj Kačić (Comittem Gurram de genere Chaçittorum). According to the Supetar Cartulary, they were one of six tribes which selected bans who, in turn, elected a new king in <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> prior king died without leaving heirs.|$|E
5|$|In a {{fifth and}} final case, (not {{present in the}} {{original}} Game Boy Advance release, but added for the DS and subsequent releases) Phoenix, now running Fey's firm as Wright and Co., is hired by teenager Ema Skye to defend her sister Lana, {{the head of the}} prosecutor's office, in <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> body of a detective, Bruce Goodman, was found in the trunk of Edgeworth's car. Together with Ema, Phoenix traces the origins of the murder to an incident two years prior, in which a serial killer allegedly murdered Edgeworth's predecessor while trying to escape custody. Damon Gant, a senior police captain, is tricked into admitting that he framed Ema for the murder in order to manipulate Lana into doing his bidding. Though Lana is cleared of murder charges, she agrees to resign her post in order to face judgement for protecting Gant. With Ema being sent to Europe to continue training as a forensic investigator, Phoenix looks forward to continuing his career defending the innocent.|$|E

25|$|In May 2006, Ireland {{wrote the}} {{majority}} opinion in <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> state and private parties had sued the state’s largest teachers' union for failing to comply with Initiative 134. The initiative, passed in 1992, prohibited unions from spending dues collected by non-members on political issues without first getting their permission. In the opinion, Ireland (serving as justice pro tempore) wrote the law was unconstitutional as it was “too heavy an administrative burden” on the union to get permission from each non-member. Subsequently, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the Washington court’s decision in Davenport v. Washington Education Association.|$|E

They were freed from jail, however this incensed the local populace who formed an angry mob and started to riot in the streets. The 77th Regiment were brought down from the Castle to disperse the rioters who fired on the mob in Spittal Street, but no-one was injured, the soldiers intentionally firing over the people's heads. For their own safety McNab and Mitchel had to take refuge in the jail they had just been released from.|$|E
25|$|The federal {{government}} asked on April 6, 1879, {{that the jury}} verdict be set aside {{on the basis of}} the Supreme Court's ruling in Carr v. United States, 98 U.S. 433, (a decision handed down on March 3, after the jury's verdict had been reached). Carr v. United States involved <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> city of San Francisco, California, transferred title to property within the city to the {{federal government}} even though a private citizen claimed title to the land. The Supreme Court reaffirmed in Carr that the federal government cannot be sued without its consent, that a suit against an officer or agent of the federal government does not bind the government itself, and that courts do not have jurisdiction over title suits against the federal government's officers and agents. Only when property has been transferred by the courts does a private citizen establish a right to establish or reclaim rights to title. But the circuit court in Lee held that much of the decision in Carr was dicta, and reaffirmed the jury decision.|$|E

500|$|The Merchants' Loan {{argument}} has been litigated by tax protesters several times, {{and the courts}} have uniformly rejected the argument that income consists only of corporate profits. See, for example: Cameron v. Internal Revenue Serv., Stoewer v. Commissioner, Reinhart v. United States, Fink v. Commissioner; Flathers v. Commissioner; Schroeder v. Commissioner; Sherwood v. Commissioner; Ho v. Commissioner; and Zook v. Commissioner. Tax protesters [...] who have lost every case using Merchants' Loan for the theory that only [...] "corporate profits" [...] could be taxable [...] are citing <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the income of a non-corporate taxpayer is taxable. Neither the United States Supreme Court nor any other federal court has ever ruled that under the Internal Revenue Code the term [...] "income" [...] means only the income of a corporation for federal income tax purposes.|$|E
500|$|The {{respondents}} {{argued that}} the provisions required that unlawful non-citizens be detained until their removal, and {{that the purpose of}} removal, on which the detention was founded, did not cease to exist just because it was not practicable in the foreseeable future to carry out that purpose. They made what was referred to as [...] "the 'never say never' proposition", that although securing a person's removal or deportation from Australia may be difficult, and [...] "often it takes years of diplomatic negotiation before a country is prepared to accept someone... {{it is very hard to}} imagine <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> purpose of removal or deportation is one that can never occur." [...] Although the respondents did not challenge the finding of fact in the Federal Court that there was no real possibility of Al-Kateb's removal in the foreseeable future, they {{argued that the}} test applied to reach that decision [...] "fails to take into account... the difficulties and the fact that things can change." ...|$|E
500|$|Newspaper reports {{throughout}} the period combined real evidence, unsubstantiated rumors, and journalistic speculation. Dinnerstein wrote, [...] "Characterized by innuendo, misrepresentation, and distortion, the yellow journalism account of Mary Phagan's death aroused an anxious city, {{and within a}} few days, a shocked state." [...] Different segments of the population focused on different aspects. Atlanta's working class saw Frank as [...] "a defiler of young girls", while the German-Jewish community saw him as [...] "an exemplary man and loyal husband." [...] Albert Lindemann, author of The Jew Accused, opined that [...] "ordinary people" [...] may have had difficulty evaluating the often unreliable information and in [...] "suspend judgment {{over a long period of}} time" [...] while the case developed. As the press shaped public opinion, much of the public's attention was directed at the police and the prosecution, whom they expected to bring Phagan's killer to justice. The prosecutor, Hugh Dorsey, had recently lost two high-profile murder cases; one state newspaper wrote that [...] "another defeat, and in <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> feeling was so intense, would have been, in all likelihood, the end of Mr. Dorsey, as solicitor." ...|$|E

500|$|Counsel for the {{appellant}} {{argued that}} this was not a case of a decision reviewable on ordinary administrative law grounds, but rather <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> exercise of the power depended [...] "upon the precedent establishment of an objective fact". However, the House of Lords disagreed with the argument. It held that the nature and process of the decision conferred upon immigration officers was inconsistent with the requirements for the establishment of any precedent facts. This was because the immigration officer had to consider a [...] "complex of statutory rules and non-statutory guidelines and other documentary evidence whose genuineness is doubtful, statements which cannot be verified, misunderstandings as to what was said, practices and attitudes in a foreign state which have to be estimated. There is room for appreciation, even for discretion." [...] On the other hand, the court was not well placed to determine which of several conflicting statements made by the appellant were true, or to decide if other factors were material to the immigration officer's decision. The court had to determine the case based on affidavit evidence and, though cross-examination on such evidence was permissible, this did not usually occur in practice. As the case did not fall into the precedent fact category, the court was unable to judicially review the decision.|$|E
500|$|By the 17th {{century the}} {{judicial}} philosophy had changed {{to allow the}} protection of a claimant's enjoyment of their land, with the duty being on the party that caused the nuisance to prevent it: [...] "as every man is bound to look to his cattle, as {{to keep them out}} of his neighbour's ground; so he must keep in the filth of his house of office, that it may not flow in upon and damnify his neighbour". During the 19th century and the Industrial Revolution, the law of nuisance significantly changed; rather than the previous tests a standard of care was instead expected, with different standards applying to individuals and companies. In reaching these decisions the courts [...] "effectively emasculated the Law of Nuisance as a useful curb on industrial pollution". In St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, for example, several judges [...] "were explicit in suggesting that they were affected by the adverse effect of a more draconian view on the economic welfare of the country's industrial cities". This contrasted with the previous view, which was that when liability was established for <b>a</b> <b>case</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> defendant's actions had interfered with the enjoyment of land, the defendant would be liable however trivial the interference.|$|E
