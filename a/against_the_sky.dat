5|$|Huge {{flocks of}} more than a million common {{starlings}} may be observed just before sunset in spring in southwestern Jutland, Denmark over the seaward marshlands of Tønder and Esbjerg municipalities between Tønder and Ribe. They gather in March until northern Scandinavian birds leave for their breeding ranges by mid-April. Their swarm behaviour creates complex shapes silhouetted <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> a phenomenon known locally as sort sol ("black sun").|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of sea terns have light grey or white body plumage as adults, {{with a black}} cap to the head. The legs and bill are various combinations of red, orange, yellow, or black depending on species. The pale plumage is conspicuous from a distance at sea, and may attract other birds to a good feeding area for these fish-eating species. When seen <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> the white underparts also help to hide the hunting bird from its intended prey. The Inca tern has mainly dark plumage, and three species that mainly eat insects, the black tern, white-winged tern, and black-bellied tern, have black underparts in the breeding season. The Anous noddies have dark plumage with a pale head cap. The reason for their dark plumage is unknown, {{but it has been}} suggested that in tropical areas, where food resources are scarce, the less conspicuous colouration makes it harder for other noddies to detect a feeding bird. Plumage type, especially the head pattern, is linked to the phylogeny of the terns, and the pale-capped, dark-bodied noddies are believed to have diverged earlier than the other genera from an ancestral white-headed gull, followed by the partially black-headed Onychoprion and Sternula groupings.|$|E

25|$|In August, {{after the}} Hot Hot Heat tour, the band {{went into the}} studio in Seattle for a day to track Head <b>Against</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sky.</b> The song was later {{released}} in October of that year on the Head <b>Against</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sky</b> E.P. with three songs from the cancelled Troubadour DVD. In October and November 2005, Eisley went on tour with Switchfoot as openers. Around this time, the band started playing new, unrecorded material for their second album. In March 2006, the band did a small tour in Australia as main support for Taking Back Sunday. Following that, Eisley headlined their last tour in support of Room Noises, The Final Noise Tour.|$|E
25|$|Named {{after the}} virgin and martyr saint St. Lucy, the cathedral is {{considered}} the oldest and largest parish cathedral in Sri Lanka. The facade rests on massive ionic columns and is adorned with seven statues.

25|$|The {{original}} viaduct {{had not had}} parapets and {{had probably}} never had handrails, which were now essential for safety. It was considered appropriate to make them of steel in an authentic period style, and after examining photographs of the cast iron railings of Chirk Aqueduct and other early examples, masonry copings and light-coloured railings were provided. The preservation of the 300mm distortion of arch 2 was maintained; the light coloured railings are unobtrusive visually <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b>|$|E

25|$|As {{men have}} said often, {{it seemed as}} if there was in this war a God of Battles who held His mighty hand before the Americans. As I looked at Sergeant Quick wig-wagging there <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> I would not have given a tin tobacco-tag for his life. Escape for him seemed impossible. It seemed absurd to hope {{that he would not be}} hit; I only hoped that he would be hit just a little, in the arm, the shoulder, or the leg.|$|E
25|$|At first, the seven-core cables {{were carried}} inside cast iron pipes, on short wooden spikes, {{a few feet}} from the side of the railway line. But from January 1843, the public were treated to the sight of {{telegraph}} wires <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> line, across the top of the viaduct, for the first time. Cooke had renegotiated the contract with the GWR and extended the telegraph to Slough, using a simpler two-needle instrument that could be supplied with just two wires suspended from porcelain insulators on poles.|$|E
25|$|The ancient Greek architects took a philosophic {{approach}} to the rules and proportions. The determining factor in the mathematics of any notable work of architecture was its ultimate appearance. The architects calculated for perspective, for the optical illusions that make edges of objects appear concave and {{for the fact that}} columns that are viewed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> look different from those adjacent that are viewed against a shadowed wall. Because of these factors, the architects adjusted the plans so that the major lines of any significant building are rarely straight.|$|E

25|$|O'Keeffe {{traveled}} to New Mexico by 1929 {{with her friend}} Rebecca Strand and stayed in Taos {{at the home of}} Mabel Dodge Luhan, who provided the women with studios. O'Keeffe went on many pack trips, exploring the rugged mountains and deserts of the region that summer and later visited the nearby D. H. Lawrence Ranch, where she completed her now famous oil painting, The Lawrence Tree, currently owned by the Wadsworth Athenaeum in Hartford, Connecticut. O'Keeffe visited and painted the nearby historical San Francisco de Asis Mission Church at Ranchos de Taos. She made several paintings of the church, as had many artists, and her painting of a fragment of it silhouetted <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> captured it from a unique perspective.|$|E
25|$|All Home Office {{police forces}} {{have access to}} air support, often {{in the form of}} helicopters. Some forces also have small fixed wing aircraft. Police Helicopters are {{required}} by the CAA to be marked in a standard 'high conspicuosity' paint scheme, to make them more visible and avoid the possibility of air proximity hazards with other low flying aircraft. This paint scheme, also used by UK military training helicopters, requires them to be black on the sides and underneath, and yellow on top. When seen from the ground, these helicopters are black but this is to make them more visible <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> as a safety feature (and yellow against the ground when seen from above). One of the most common helicopters used by the police is the Eurocopter EC135.|$|E
25|$|Lines one {{to twenty}} one {{describe}} {{the election and}} praise of Kesh as recorded by Nisaba, twenty two to forty four liken the temple to the moon <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> containing the life sources of Sumer and its cosmic dimensions filling the world. Lines forty five to fifty seven give a metaphorical description of the temple reaching both for the heaven and descending into the underworld. Lines fifty eight to seventy three discuss {{the complexities of the}} temple with vast quantities of oxen and sheep. The temple is likened to the trees from which wood was used in its construction. The gods and functions of the temple are described and praised during temple dedication with different parts of the temple described: its interior and exterior appearance, its gate, courtyard, door and walls. The hymn ends on the conclusion to approach the temple.|$|E

25|$|In other {{departments}} of physics may be mentioned his {{paper on the}} conduction of heat in crystals (1851) and his inquiries in connection with Crookes radiometer; his explanation of the light border frequently noticed in photographs just outside {{the outline of a}} dark body seen <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> (1883); and, still later, his theory of the x-rays, which he suggested might be transverse waves travelling as innumerable solitary waves, not in regular trains. Two long papers published in 1849 – one on attractions and Clairaut's theorem, and the other on the variation of gravity at {{the surface of the earth}} (1849)—also demand notice, as do his mathematical memoirs on the critical values of sums of periodic series (1847) and on the numerical calculation of a class of definite integrals and infinite series (1850) and his discussion of a differential equation relating to the breaking of railway bridges (1849), research related to his evidence given to the Royal Commission on the Use of Iron in Railway structures after the Dee bridge disaster of 1847.|$|E
500|$|Second World War {{maritime}} patrol aircraft such as the Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boat were painted white, as aircraft generally appear dark <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> (including at night), and hence are least visible when painted in as light a colour as possible. The problem of appearing dark <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> was explored in the U.S. Navy's Yehudi lights project in 1943, using counter-illumination to raise the average brightness of a plane, when seen head-on, from a dark shape to {{the same as the}} sky. The experiments worked, enabling an aircraft to approach to within [...] before being seen, whereas aircraft without the lights were noticed [...] away.|$|E
500|$|Yehudi lights [...] are lamps of automatically-controlled {{brightness}} {{placed on}} the front and leading edges of an aircraft to raise the aircraft's luminance to the average brightness of the sky, a form of active camouflage using counter-illumination. They were designed to camouflage the aircraft by preventing it from appearing as a dark object <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b>|$|E

500|$|The NDRC {{estimated}} that lights could be spaced {{up to about}} [...] apart without becoming visible as individual objects {{at a distance of}} [...] On this basis, it calculated that a large aircraft like a B-24 Liberator bomber could be camouflaged <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> for a power consumption of under 500 watts. The key technology investigated under Yehudi was therefore the use of forward-facing lights to anti-submarine and attack aircraft.|$|E
500|$|Ruisdael is {{now seen}} as the leading artist of the [...] "classical" [...] phase in Dutch {{landscape}} art, which built upon the realism of the previous [...] "tonal" [...] phase. The tonal phase suggested atmosphere through the use of tonality, while the classical phase strived for a more grandiose effect, with paintings built up through a serious of vigorous contrasts of solid form <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> and of light against shade, with a tree, animal, or windmill often singled out.|$|E
500|$|In the 18th century, {{the castle}} became a popular topic for {{painters}} {{interested in the}} then fashionable landscape styles of the Sublime and the Picturesque. Richard Wilson painted the castle in 1771, dramatically silhouetting the keep <b>against</b> <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> producing what historian Jeremy Black describes as a [...] "calm, entranching and melancholic" [...] effect. Thomas Walmesley's rendition went further, depicting Oakhampton Castle surrounded by an imaginary, Italianate lake in 1810. Thomas Girtin painted the castle in 1797, as did his friend J. M. W. Turner in 1824. Sir Vyell Vyvyan conducted some minor repairs to the castle during the 19th century.|$|E
