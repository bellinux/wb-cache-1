40|$|Abstract. As a {{promising}} technology for tracing {{the product and}} human flows, Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) has received much attention within database community. However, the problem of missing readings restricts the application of RFID. Some RFID data cleaning algorithms have therefore been proposed to address this problem. Nevertheless, most of them fill up missing readings simply based on the historical readings of independent <b>monitored</b> <b>objects.</b> While, the correlations (spatio-temporal closeness) among the <b>monitored</b> <b>objects</b> are ignored. We observe that the spatio-temporal correlations of <b>monitored</b> <b>objects</b> are very useful for imputing the missing RFID readings. In this paper, we propose a data imputation model for RFID by efficiently maintaining and analyzing the correlations of the <b>monitored</b> <b>objects.</b> Optimized data structures and imputation strategies are developed. Extensive simulated experiments have demonstrated {{the effectiveness of the}} proposed algorithms. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a proposal (story) of how statically detecting unreachable objects (in Java) {{could be used}} to improve a particular runtime verification approach (for Java), namely parametric trace slicing. Monitoring algorithms for parametric trace slicing depend on garbage collection to (i) cleanup data-structures storing <b>monitored</b> <b>objects,</b> ensuring they do not become unmanageably large, and (ii) anticipate the violation of (non-safety) properties that cannot be satisfied as a <b>monitored</b> <b>object</b> can no longer appear later in the trace. The proposal is that both usages can be improved by making the unreachability of <b>monitored</b> <b>objects</b> explicit in the parametric property and statically introducing additional instrumentation points generating related events. The ideas presented in this paper are still exploratory and the intention is to integrate the described techniques into the MarQ monitoring tool for quantified event automata.

40|$|Abstract—Distributed {{systems are}} complex systems {{and there are}} a lot of the {{potential}} risks in the system, so system administrators need to have some effective support tools for network management. The architecture information of distributed systems is an essential part of distributed system monitoring solutions, because it provides general information about <b>monitored</b> <b>objects</b> in the system for administrators, as well as supports administrator in quickly detecting change of topology, error status or potential risks that arise during operation of distributed systems. The modeling approaches have an important role in developing monitoring solutions, in which they are background to develop algorithms for monitoring problems in distributed systems. This paper proposes an approach in order to model for hierarchical architecture of objects in distributed systems, in which consists of architecture of <b>monitored</b> <b>objects,</b> networks, domains and global distributed systems. Based on this model, a basic monitoring solution for hierarchical architecture of distributed systems is developed and this solution is able to provide administrators more important architecture information such as the topology of hardware components, processes, status of <b>monitored</b> <b>objects,</b> etc. Keywords—architecture; distributed systems; model; monitored objects; monitoring I...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{accidents}} and disasters {{in the past}} have called for the need of structure to serve as an alarm or early-warning system. The monitoring could be categorised into normal (or non-urgent) and urgent monitoring schemes, depending on the case of monitoring, such as, the age and integrity of the <b>monitored</b> <b>objects</b> as well as the external load sustained by the <b>monitored</b> <b>objects.</b> This paper describes a GPS-based structure monitoring system, which is currently being developed at UTM, to undertake both normal and urgent monitoring survey. The normal monitoring scheme is performed as a regular check up when the <b>monitored</b> <b>object</b> is considered as healthy (or stable). In this case, the observations are preferentially carried out periodically and the results are obtained via post-processing (by using GPSAD 2000). However, urgent monitoring scheme is performed when the stability status or integrity of the structure is questionable. Consequently, the online and continuous observation will be performed to provide the near real-time results. On the other hand, to serve {{the purpose of the study}} of structural dynamic response, other than providing the time-domain analysis, by using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), the analysis could also be done in frequency domain.

In this paper we propose “A Novel Solitude Conserving Location Monitoring approach for Wireless Sensor networks”. We design two approaches to study nondescript locations in-network approaches, namely quality-aware and resource-aware approaches, that aims to enable the system to give high end quality location monitoring services for end users, while conserving personal location privacy. Both approaches are worked based on k-anonymity solitude (i. e.,an object is indistinguishable among k objects), to enable highly trusted sensor nodes to provide the collective location data of <b>monitored</b> <b>objects</b> for our system. Each collective location is in a form of a observed area X along {{with the number of}} <b>monitored</b> <b>objects</b> reside in X. The resource-aware approach objective to optimize the computational and communication value, while quality-aware approach aims to increase the reliability of the collective location data by reducing their observing areas.

We evaluated these two approaches through simulated experiments. The simulation results shows that these approaches gives high quality location observing services for end users and assure the location secrecy of the <b>monitored</b> <b>objects...</b>|$|R

We evaluate its performance in terms of runtimes of multi-threaded programs on linked-list, bounded-buffer, and other fundamental problems implemented in Java. We compare the runtimes of our implementation against implementations using Java's reentrant locks, recently proposed automatic signaling framework AutoSynch, and some other techniques from the literature. The results of of the evaluation indicate that monitors based on our framework provide significant gains in runtime performance in comparison to traditional monitors implemented using Java's reentrant locks...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Data misuse {{might be}} {{performed}} by peoples or sources like an organization’s employees or business partners {{who have access to}} sensitive data and misuse their authority. We can say that users are either trusted or untrusted. The access privilege to untrusted parties to data objects (e. g., patient records or clients) should monitor to detect misuse. Still, monitoring data collection or data information is resource dependent and it taking much more time and may also cause issues like disturbance and inconvenience to involved employees. So that, monitored data collection or information should selected carefully. In this paper, we represent two optimization issues designed carefully for fetching specific data collection or information for monitoring, such that the detection rate is maximized and the monitoring effort is reduced. In the first, the goal is to select data <b>objects</b> for <b>monitoring</b> that are accessed by at most c trusted agents while ensuring access to at least k <b>monitored</b> <b>objects</b> by each untrusted agent (both c and k are integer variable). The goal of the second is to select <b>monitored</b> data <b>objects</b> that maximize the number of <b>monitored</b> data <b>objects</b> accessed by untrusted agents while ensuring that each trusted agent does not access more than d <b>monitored</b> data <b>objects</b> (d is an integer variable) ...|$|R

Image fusion is a sub area of the more general topic of data fusion. Image fusion can be roughly defined as the process of combining multiple input images into an image, which contains the "relevant" information from the inputs. The aim of image fusion is to integrate complementary and redundant information from multiple images to create a composite that contains a better fused image than any of the individual source images. Main purpose of the former is to increase both the spectral and spatial resolution of images by combining multiple images. In this paper we tried to use this theory for moving object tracking, so with the usage of multi images that are obtained in different times and combination of them with this theory we identify the path of movement of moving object so this result could help us to implement automatic systems that that could <b>monitor</b> <b>objects</b> automatically without human interventation.
