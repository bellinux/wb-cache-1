5|$|The {{landline}} telephones in most residential {{homes are}} analog—that is, the speaker's voice directly determines the signal's voltage. Although short-distance calls may be handled from end-to-end as <b>analog</b> <b>signals,</b> increasingly telephone service providers are transparently converting the signals to digital signals for transmission. The {{advantage of this}} is that digitized voice data can travel side-by-side with data from the Internet and can be perfectly reproduced in long distance communication (as opposed to <b>analog</b> <b>signals</b> that are inevitably impacted by noise).|$|E
5|$|HDMI {{can only}} be used with older analog-only devices (using {{connections}} such as SCART, VGA, RCA, etc.) {{by means of a}} digital-to-analog converter or AV receiver, as the interface does not carry any <b>analog</b> <b>signals</b> (unlike DVI, where devices with DVI-I ports accept or provide either digital or <b>analog</b> <b>signals).</b> Cables are available that contain the necessary electronics, {{but it is important to}} distinguish these active converter cables from passive HDMI to VGA cables (which are typically cheaper as they don't include any electronics). The passive cables are only useful if you have a device that is generating or expecting HDMI signals on a VGA connector, or VGA signals on an HDMI connector; this is a non-standard feature, not implemented by most devices.|$|E

5000|$|If {{a proper}} (no clipping/saturation) <b>analog</b> <b>signal</b> is {{converted}} to digital via A/D with sufficient samples, and then reconverted to analog via D/A then Nyquist theorem guarantees {{that there will be}} no problem in the analog domain due to [...] "peak" [...] issues because the restored <b>analog</b> <b>signal</b> will be an exact copy of the original <b>analog</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|R
50|$|One {{standard}} way {{to recover}} data {{that has been}} overwritten on a hard drive is to capture and process the <b>analog</b> <b>signal</b> obtained from the drive's read/write head prior to this <b>analog</b> <b>signal</b> being digitized. This <b>analog</b> <b>signal</b> will be close to an ideal digital signal, but the differences will reveal important information. By calculating the ideal digital signal and then subtracting it from the actual <b>analog</b> <b>signal,</b> {{it is possible to}} amplify the obtained difference signal and use it to determine what had previously been written on the disk.|$|R
5|$|Communications signals {{can be sent}} {{either by}} <b>analog</b> <b>signals</b> or digital signals. There are analog {{communication}} systems and digital communication systems. For an analog signal, the signal is varied continuously {{with respect to the}} information. In a digital signal, the information is encoded as a set of discrete values (for example, a set of ones and zeros). During the propagation and reception, the information contained in <b>analog</b> <b>signals</b> will inevitably be degraded by undesirable physical noise. (The output of a transmitter is noise-free for all practical purposes.) Commonly, the noise in a communication system can be expressed as adding or subtracting from the desirable signal in a completely random way. This form of noise is called additive noise, with the understanding that the noise can be negative or positive at different instants of time. Noise that is not additive noise is a much more difficult situation to describe or analyze, and these other kinds of noise will be omitted here.|$|E

40|$|The device (20), {{that is an}} analog-digital converter, computes a {{sequence}} of output digital values (S 14) representative of an input <b>analog</b> <b>signal</b> (S 10), and comprises a comparator (22) for comparing the input <b>analog</b> <b>signal</b> with a comparison <b>analog</b> <b>signal</b> (S 11) and for delivering a pair of control signals (S 12, S 13) when the absolute value for {{the difference between the}} two signals is greater than a threshold value, an increment-decrement block (24) for computing a new output digital value on receiving the control signal, and a converter (26) for obtaining the comparison <b>analog</b> <b>signal</b> on the basis of the last computed output digital value. The device also comprises a time counter (28) delivering a digital value (S 15) corresponding to the time lapsed since the reception of the preceding control signal. The increment-decrement block (24) comprises a memory element wherein the value of the control signal is stored, and a computing unit for evaluating the new output digital value. The new value of the control signal is written in the memory element when the comparator (22) sends a write request. The converter (26) comprises a memory element wherein the output digital value is stored, and a digital-analog converter. The new digital value is written in the memory element when a write request is received from the increment-decrement block (24).

When the input <b>analog</b> <b>signal</b> is greater than the comparison <b>analog</b> <b>signal</b> with determined threshold, the new output digital value is computed by increasing the last output digital value by a determined increment, and when the comparison <b>analog</b> <b>signal</b> is greater than the input <b>analog</b> <b>signal</b> with determined threshold, the new output digital value is computed by decreasing the last output digital value by a determined decremen...|$|R

25|$|Wiener was {{an early}} studier of {{stochastic}} and mathematical noise processes, contributing work relevant to electronic engineering, electronic communication, and control systems. It was Wiener's idea to model a signal {{as if it were}} an exotic type of noise, giving it a sound mathematical basis.

But Wiener dealt with <b>analog</b> <b>signals,</b> where such a simple example doesn't exist. Wiener is unlucky in that his early work on information theory and signal processing was limited to <b>analog</b> <b>signals,</b> and was largely forgotten with the development of the digital theory.|$|E

In this thesis, a new 1 -Ghz <b>analog</b> <b>signal</b> squaring circuit (squarer) designed in 180 nanometer CMOS process is presented. It is implemented by CMOS components including current source, current mirror, differential amplifier, low-pass filter, and voltage output buffer.

A recently developed TV-streaming product called the Slingbox uses <b>analog</b> <b>signals</b> to convey video from television to a mobile device. However, the encryption used by ACP blocks analog transmission, rendering the Slingbox unusable. Additionally ACP blocks the use of recording for educational purposes.

25|$|Signal {{processing}} {{deals with}} the analysis and manipulation of signals.

For <b>analog</b> <b>signals,</b> signal processing may involve the amplification and filtering of audio signals for audio equipment or the modulation and demodulation of signals for telecommunications. For digital signals, signal processing may involve the compression, error detection and error correction of digitally sampled signals.|$|E
50|$|WFXT's <b>analog</b> <b>signal</b> began {{malfunctioning}} on November 1, 2008 as {{a result}} of a failing transmission line, forcing the station to reduce its power. By December 9, the transmission line had deteriorated to the point that the station's effective radiated power was reduced to levels where viewers could then only receive the station via cable, satellite or its digital signal in most areas. The station then began to state that the possibility existed that its <b>analog</b> <b>signal</b> might have to be shut down ahead of the analog-to-digital transition deadline for full-power stations, which at that time was scheduled for February 17, 2009. In the end, the station's <b>analog</b> <b>signal</b> remained on the air even after that date (a result of the transition being delayed to June 12); however, due to the continued failure of the transmission line (to the extent that the station estimated its <b>analog</b> <b>signal</b> was only reaching 3% of its former coverage reach, with no signal at all at the station's Dedham studios), WFXT shut down its <b>analog</b> <b>signal,</b> over UHF channel 25, on February 27, 2009, becoming the second English-language major network station in Boston to exclusively transmit a digital signal (WZMY terminated its <b>analog</b> <b>signal</b> in December 2008) and the only Fox-owned station to shut down its <b>analog</b> <b>signal</b> prior to the new June 12 transition date.
