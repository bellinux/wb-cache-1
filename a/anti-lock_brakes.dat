5|$|The BA model {{represented}} a A$500million investment, and 24,000hours of engine and durability testing. Germany's Nürburgring test track {{was used for}} some suspension testing. The <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brakes</b> and electronic stability control were calibrated in Sweden, as well as Australia.|$|E
5|$|A new wider {{front track}} was {{introduced}} to address issues with the previous carried-over VL chassis components. In August 1992, <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brakes</b> were introduced as an option on the Calais and SS trim levels, later becoming optional on all Series II variants. This January 1993 update also included a colour-coded grille for the Executive and alloy wheels for the Commodore S.|$|E
5|$|Safety {{played a}} {{substantial}} {{role in the}} development of the VX model. Bosch 5.3 <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brakes</b> were made standard on all variants, a first for an Australian manufactured car; and traction control was made available on vehicles equipped with manual transmission. Extensive research was undertaken to reduce the effects from a side-impact collision through modification of the B-pillars. The risk presented by a side-impact collision in a VX fitted without side airbags is reduced by 50percent when compared to a similarly specified VT model.|$|E

50|$|No changes. A {{version of}} the S Bandit with <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> was {{introduced}} for certain world markets. The 1997 ABS (<b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> system) 1200 Bandit used a 114 link chain {{as opposed to the}} standard 110 link chain.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{simulation of}} integrated controller of vehicle <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> system, {{which consists of}} the traditional continuous PID and finite state machine theory. Based on the integrated controller, slip ratio and deceleration are selected as the main control parameters to optimize ABS. Vehicle speed, wheel speed, braking distance, pressure state and slip ratio are investigate to reveal the performance of <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> system. Single-wheel system is studied in this paper {{to prove that the}} controller can effectively reduce braking distance and time and also can improve the stability of <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> system, which can provide a guideline to the design of <b>anti-lock</b> <b>braking</b> system.

5|$|Passenger safety {{was a key}} design aspect for the Ford engineers. <b>Anti-lock</b> <b>brakes</b> were {{standard}} on all models; electronic brakeforce distribution was also {{standard on}} most variants. The addition of traction control for higher trim levels helped to prevent loss of traction. On top of this, dual front airbags were a standard fitment across the range; side-impact airbags were equipped on higher luxury levels such as the Fairmont. In a crash safety assessment conducted by ANCAP, the BA model scored 27.27 {{out of a possible}} 37 points, giving a rating of four out of five stars.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{reaching}} {{the end of}} the second queue, guests were loaded into test cars. Upon dispatching from the loading dock, the car was brought through an accelerated hill climb. Next, the car's suspension was tested over different types of road surfaces, including German and Belgian blocks & cobblestones. Next, the car's anti-lock braking system was turned off and the car tried to navigate a course of cones, knocking many over in the process. The <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brakes</b> were then turned back on and a similar cone course was navigated easily. Guests were shown a video overlay of the difference. Then, the cars were brought through 3 environmental chambers: a heat chamber, a cold chamber, and a corrosion chamber.|$|E

25|$|Every 20,000 kilometres, a 2½ hour {{inspection}} is conducted, called Nachschau. In this inspection, the brakes, the Linienzugbeeinflussung {{systems and}} the <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brakes</b> are checked as well.|$|E

25|$|<b>Anti-lock</b> <b>brakes</b> are {{the subject}} of some {{experiments}} centred around risk compensation theory, which asserts that drivers adapt to the safety benefit of ABS by driving more aggressively. In a Munich study, half a fleet of taxicabs was equipped with <b>anti-lock</b> <b>brakes,</b> while the other half had conventional brake systems. The crash rate was substantially the same for both types of cab, and Wilde concludes this was due to drivers of ABS-equipped cabs taking more risks, assuming that ABS would take care of them, while the non-ABS drivers drove more carefully since ABS would not be there to help in case of a dangerous situation.|$|E
