50|$|For safety reasons, the {{aviation}} fuel provided by ships {{may be different}} (e.g. <b>AVCAT)</b> from that provided by airfields and tanker aircraft.|$|E
50|$|Poshak {{class of}} barge were {{a series of}} {{self-propelled}} aviation fuel carriers built by Mazagon Dock Limited of the Indian navy.The <b>AVCAT</b> tankers had carrying capacity of 400 tonnes.|$|E
50|$|Centaur was {{completed}} with an axial flight deck, {{marked by a}} broken white line running {{down the middle of}} the entire length of the flight deck. She began her contractor's sea trials in March 1953 and commissioned on 17 September 1953. Her aviation facilities as completed included 2 x BH5 30,000 lb hydraulic catapults at the bow, six 30,000 lb arrestor wires, two 35,000 lb capacity aircraft lifts, measuring 54 x 44 ft forward and aft. Her single hangar measured 329 by 62 by 17.5 ft and she had stowage for 349,000 Impgal L of <b>AVCAT</b> and Avgas aviation fuel.|$|E
50|$|Hooghly-class fuel barges are {{self-propelled}} auxiliary {{capable of}} replenishing LSHSD, <b>AVCAT</b> and other oils for ships in harbour, at anchorage and fuel depots at distant location. Each vessel {{in the class}} has a length of 67 meters with beam of 12.5 meters and depth of 4 meters. They have draught of 4 meters and have displacement of 1700 tonnes. They have a rated capacity to carry 1000 tonnes of fuel. They are able to operate up to sea state 4 and service up to sea state 6.As per a contract order of INR 96.12 crores from Indian Navy, four 1000-ton fuel barges are to be constructed, with an option for two more barges.|$|E
5000|$|JP-5:is {{a yellow}} kerosene-based jet fuel {{developed}} in 1952 {{for use in}} aircraft stationed aboard aircraft carriers, where the risk from fire is particularly great. JP-5 is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons, containing alkanes, naphthenes, and aromatic hydrocarbons that weighs [...] and has a high flash point (min. 60 C). Because some US naval air stations, Marine Corps air stations and Coast Guard air stations host both sea-based and shore-based (e.g., [...] "land based") naval aircraft, these installations will also typically fuel their shore-based aircraft with JP-5, thus precluding {{the need to maintain}} separate fuel facilities for JP-5 and non-JP-5 fuel. In addition, JP-5 may well have been used by other countries for their military aircraft. Its freezing point is âˆ’46 C. It does not contain antistatic agents. JP5 is also known as NCI-C54784. JP-5's NATO code is F-44. It is also called <b>AVCAT</b> fuel for Aviation Carrier Turbine fuel.|$|E
