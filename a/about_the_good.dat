5|$|Themes from Plato and his {{influence}} on Western political philosophy are also {{prevalent in the}} novel. Mainly, {{the debate over the}} nature of 'Good Society' and how to achieve it are seen in the positions of the Supreme. He argues that it is the ruler's role, as well as his duty and obligation, to bring <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> society, and this can only be done by the imposition of absolute order from above. The dictator’s job is to bring <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> Society, to impose the needed order, and the people's job is to obey the dictator, thereby enjoying the fruits of the good society. The result of such behavior by both the ruler and the ruled will be good for everyone.|$|E

25|$|In addition, {{the ideal}} city {{is used as}} an image to {{illuminate}} the state of one's soul, or the will, reason, and desires combined in the human body. Socrates is attempting to make {{an image of a}} rightly ordered human, and then later goes on to describe the different kinds of humans that can be observed, from tyrants to lovers of money in various kinds of cities. The ideal city is not promoted, but only used to magnify the different kinds of individual humans and the state of their soul. However, the philosopher king image was used by many after Plato to justify their personal political beliefs. The philosophic soul according to Socrates has reason, will, and desires united in virtuous harmony. A philosopher has the moderate love for wisdom and the courage to act according to wisdom. Wisdom is knowledge <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>Good</b> or the right relations between all that exists.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{to negative}} reviews from critics. Michael Liedtke and George Avalos, {{in a review}} of the sixth season in The Charlotte Observer, called the episode [...] "just plain bad". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club roundly criticized the episode and awarded it a [...] "D–", calling it [...] "a famously bad episode of The X-Files." [...] He noted that [...] "the worst thing about 'Agua Mala' is that it comes so very, very close to working that it’s frustrating to see just how little it actually does" [...] due to its bizarre structure and convoluted antagonist. VanDerWerff criticized Darren McGavin's appearance in the episode, calling it a [...] "glorified cameo", and noted that his character function as the [...] "kind of old man who stands on his porch and yells <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> old days to the neighborhood kids." [...] He did however, call the shot of the [...] "writhing tentacle in the overhead lamp" [...] the [...] "one good thing" [...] in the episode. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one-and-a-half stars out of five, writing that the episode's [...] "laughs aren't clever, and the scares are silly".|$|E
500|$|Todd McCarthy of Variety said Jolie {{was more}} {{affecting}} than in A Mighty Heart(2007) because she relied less on artifice. He also noted {{a surfeit of}} good supporting performances, Michael Kelly's in particular. Oliver Séguret of Libération said the cast was the film's best feature. He praised the supporting actors and said Jolie's performance was forceful yet understated. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter said Jolie shunned her [...] "movie star" [...] persona to appear vulnerable and resolute. He perceived the supporting characters—Amy Ryan's excepted—as having few shades of gray. David Ansen, writing in Newsweek, echoed the sentiment, but said that [...] "some stories really are <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> guys and the bad". He said that with the distractions of Jolie's celebrity and beauty put aside, she carried the role with restraint and intensity. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times felt that Jolie's celebrity was distracting enough to render her unconvincing, and David Denby of The New Yorker said that while Jolie showed skill and selflessness, the performance and character were uninteresting. He said Collins was one-dimensional, lacking desires or temperament. He cited similar problems with Malkovich's Briegleb, concluding, [...] "The two of them make a very proper and dull pair of collaborators." ...|$|E
500|$|Milius {{said the}} actors were chosen because their {{appearances}} and personae fitted their roles. [...] He wanted actors {{who would not}} have any preconceived notions to project into their roles. Although Milius had reservations when he witnessed the first few takes of the novices at work, he put faith in them improving their skills {{on the job and}} altered the script to fit their abilities. Schwarzenegger had studied for weeks in 1980 under Robert Easton, a voice coach for several Hollywood stars, to improve his speech. His first line in the film was a paraphrasing of Mongol emperor Genghis Khan's speech <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>good</b> things in life and the actor delivered it with a heavy Austrian accent; critics later described what they heard as [...] "to crush your enemiessee dem [...] driven before you, and to hear the lamentations of dair vimen [...] ". Subsequently, Schwarzenegger underwent intensive speech training with Milius. [...] Each of his later longer speeches was rehearsed at least 40 times. Lopez's lines were also an issue; although Milius was satisfied with Lopez's work, the surfer's lines were redubbed by stage actor Sab Shimono for the final cut. [...] A source close to the production said this was done because Lopez failed to [...] " [...] a certain quality to his voice." ...|$|E
