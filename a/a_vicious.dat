5|$|Hanson {{returned}} to the WWWF in 1979 as <b>a</b> <b>vicious</b> heel under the management of Fred Blassie.

5|$|Although the Rose Room {{was removed}} from the Algonquin in a 1998 remodel, the hotel paid tribute to the group by {{commissioning}} and hanging the painting <b>A</b> <b>Vicious</b> Circle by Natalie Ascencios, depicting the Round Table and also created a replica of the original table. The hotel occasionally stages an original musical production, The Talk of the Town, in the Oak Room. Its latest production started September 11, 2007 and ran {{through the end of the}} year.|$|E

Legree (a transplanted northerner) takes Tom and Emmeline (whom Legree purchased at the same time) to rural Louisiana, where they meet Legree's other slaves.|$|E
5|$|The {{mandate and}} the limits on open {{enrollment}} were designed to avoid the insurance death spiral in which healthy people delay insuring themselves until they get sick. In such a situation, insurers would have to raise their premiums to cover the relatively sicker and thus more expensive policies, which could create <b>a</b> <b>vicious</b> cycle in which {{more and more people}} drop their coverage.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the {{investigations}} of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, <b>a</b> <b>vicious</b> murderer named Erwin Lukesh, capable of jumping between parallel universes, shoots Doggett using Reyes' gun. Brad Follmer opens an investigation {{to figure out the}} truth. They eventually deduce that Lukesh is the real murderer.|$|E
500|$|On 10 March 1977, {{at a press}} {{ceremony}} held outside Buckingham Palace, the Sex Pistols publicly {{signed to}} A Records (the real signing had taken place the day before). Afterwards, intoxicated, {{they made their way}} to the <b>A</b> offices. <b>Vicious</b> smashed in <b>a</b> toilet bowl and cut his foot (there is some disagreement about which happened first). <b>As</b> <b>Vicious</b> trailed blood around the offices, Rotten verbally abused the staff and Jones got frisky in the ladies' room. A couple of days later, the Pistols got into a rumble with another band at a club; one of Rotten's pals threatened the life of a good friend of A's English director. On 16 March, A broke contract with the Pistols. Twenty-five thousand copies of the planned [...] "God Save the Queen" [...] single, produced by Chris Thomas, had already been pressed; virtually all were destroyed.|$|R

5|$|Thomas F. Wilson, {{known for}} playing the {{character}} Biff Tannen in the Back to the Future films, began his recurring role as policeman Stan Carter. In the comic books, Stan Carter was <b>a</b> <b>vicious</b> serial killer {{by the name of}} Sin-Eater. Due to the show being for youth-oriented audiences, it is highly unlikely the series will make him the murdering alter-ego.|$|E
5|$|As a {{character}} in the games, Mewtwo's physical appearance is not its only stark divergence from Mew. While the alterations to the genetic source material it was cloned resulted in its abilities surpassing Mew's, it also resulted in Mewtwo developing <b>a</b> <b>vicious</b> personality that is primarily interested in proving its own strength. The franchise's non-video game media, particularly the anime, has expanded upon the character. In the most notable instance, Mewtwo telepathically speaks with a male voice and is existentially torn over its purpose in the world.|$|E
5|$|Both Douglas and Nixon {{announced}} their candidacies in late 1949. In March 1950 Downey withdrew from <b>a</b> <b>vicious</b> primary battle with Douglas by announcing his retirement, after which Los Angeles Daily News publisher Manchester Boddy joined the race. Boddy attacked Douglas as a leftist {{and was the}} first to compare her to New York Congressman Vito Marcantonio, who was accused of being a communist. Boddy, Nixon, and Douglas each entered both party primaries, a practice known as cross-filing. In the Republican primary, Nixon was challenged only by cross-filers and fringe candidates.|$|E

5|$|By then, the Pagan Empire, despite outward {{appearances}} of calmness, {{had been in}} long and slow decline since the early 13th century. The continuous growth of tax-free religious wealth had greatly reduced the tax base of the kingdom. The crown had lost resources needed to retain the loyalty of courtiers and military servicemen, inviting <b>a</b> <b>vicious</b> circle of internal disorders and external challenges. Although {{it was able to}} put down the first batch of serious rebellions in 1258–60 in South Arakan and Martaban (Mottama), the decline continued. On the eve of the Mongol invasions, between one and two-thirds of Upper Burma's cultivable land had been donated to religion. The crown's ability to mobilize defenses was in serious jeopardy.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the role}} of {{mitochondria}} as the cell's powerhouse, {{there may be some}} leakage of the high-energy electrons in the respiratory chain to form reactive oxygen species. This was thought to result in significant oxidative stress in the mitochondria with high mutation rates of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Hypothesized links between aging and oxidative stress are not new and were proposed in 1956, which was later refined into the mitochondrial free radical theory of aging. <b>A</b> <b>vicious</b> cycle was thought to occur, as oxidative stress leads to mitochondrial DNA mutations, which can lead to enzymatic abnormalities and further oxidative stress.|$|E
5|$|Homer and Burns are {{beset by}} cabin fever {{and attempt to}} kill each other. After <b>a</b> <b>vicious</b> struggle, Burns ignites the cabin's propane tank, {{launching}} the building out of the snow and propelling it toward the horrified onlookers. Once {{it comes to a}} halt, Burns reminds everyone of the contest, and all the workers hurry inside. Lenny is the last person in the cabin, and is fired. Burns is informed that the completion time of the competition has set a new record, and decides that no one will be fired after all.|$|E
50|$|Later in 1978, Grisham and Barnes formed Vicious Circle, and T.S.O.L. took a brief hiatus (in 2013, TKO Records {{released}} <b>an</b> eponymous <b>Vicious</b> Circle EP, {{composed of}} circa-1979 rehearsal tapes).|$|R

5|$|In 1261, Alexander III, King of Scots (died 1286) sent an {{emissary}} to Norway {{to discuss}} the Isles. Negotiations proved fruitless, and the following year William I, Earl of Ross (died 1274) is recorded to have launched <b>a</b> <b>vicious</b> attack on Skye. The assault was likely carried out on behalf of Alexander, {{in response to the}} failure of Scottish mission to Norway the year previous. In response, Hákon organised a massive military force to re-assert Norwegian control along the western seaboard of Scotland. At this time, the Norwegian king was {{at the height of his}} power, and his only son had just recently been recognised as heir to the throne.|$|E
5|$|Later, Weed {{encounters}} a dog named Yukimura, and learns {{that a group}} of monkeys have been terrorizing the area. Leading them is Shōgun, <b>a</b> <b>vicious</b> baboon that feeds on young monkeys and puppies. Shōgun had previously attacked Yukimura and his family, permanently damaging his adopted father Saheiji. Weed, his comrades, Yukimura, and several rebellious monkeys attack Shōgun and his followers. Yukimura is able to injure Shōgun enough to ensure his death, but dies in the process. Saheiji reveals that Yukimura was Weed's brother: Sakura, too sick to care for all of her children, had given two of her puppies to Saheiji to raise as foster sons.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Stewie {{plays at}} the park with his teddy, Rupert. <b>A</b> <b>vicious</b> dog grabs Rupert from him and tears it to shreds. Lois runs after the dog, {{retrieves}} Rupert, and repairs him, causing Stewie to rethink all the bad thoughts he's had of Lois. Stewie becomes enamored with her, which she takes as refreshing at first, but eventually, she becomes exhausted and frustrated at his increased dependency and even has a nightmare of murdering him. Taking Brian's advice, she starts ignoring his demands for attention (faking he got sick from pills and claiming to be dying), until he injures himself falling down the stairs; Lois tries to apologize for her behavior, but Stewie is so disgusted by it that it causes him to hate her once again.|$|E

5000|$|After {{working in}} {{television}} for several years, Humes directed <b>A</b> Little <b>Vicious,</b> <b>a</b> short documentary film concerning {{the rehabilitation of}} a dog who had been sentenced to death for biting. Narrated by actor Kevin Bacon, this [...] "offbeat documentary" [...] was lauded by the reviewer for the New York Times as paying [...] "rewarding attention to the little peculiarities of all involved." [...] The film was nominated for the 1992 Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject).|$|R
