40|$|The {{synthetic}} ~-FeOOH (Akaganeite) was dehydrated at 300 ~ 176 for 1 - 20 h {{under vacuum}} of 10 - 3 and 10 - 5 torr. The magnetic {{properties of the}} obtained ehydration products have been measured for saturation magnetization (M~), re-sidual magnetization (Mr), and coercive force (He). Ms and Mr were proportional to the chemically analyzed Fe 2 ยง content in the samples. With reference to the x-ray diffraction results, {{it was found that}} the dehydrated products of fl-FeOOH in vacuo are the oxides in the Fe 304 series containing different amounts of Fe ~ i ~ the range 1 - 3 mmol g- ', and with a cer-tain amount of ~-Fe~O~. The oxidation of the dehydrated ~-FeOOH in air at 225 ~ for 20 h gave oxides of the ~-Fe 203 series, which are entirely different in magnetic properties but almost similar in x-ray reflections in comparison with those of the dehydrated fl-FeOOH. The variations of H ~ and the reduced remanence (M~/M~) with the Fe ~ ยง content are also discussed. The decomposition product of synthetic B-FeOOH (Akaganeite), particularly under vacuum or in an inert at-mosphere, has recently been the subject of interest in dif-ferent problems: first for a possibility of producing ferro-magnetic <b>acicular</b> <b>powder</b> material suitable for magneti...|$|E
