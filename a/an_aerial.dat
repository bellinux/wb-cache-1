5|$|<b>An</b> <b>aerial</b> survey later {{determined}} that the damage across the seven counties was caused by one continuous tornado, with a track estimated at 122miles (196km) in length. This was the longest single tornado track recorded in Arkansas since detailed record keeping began in 1950. Thirteen people were killed by this tornado, and about 140 people were injured. At least 200 homes and businesses were destroyed along the tornado's path. Damage from this tornado was estimated at nearly $120 million across the seven counties.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} main road, there are five avenues, each planted in its own species and named accordingly: oak, poplar, birch, lime, and sycamore. The tree-lined avenues give Barrhill a charming appearance. Wason had trees planted in an unusual pattern around the market square.

5|$|Boeing is {{developing}} a roll-on/roll-off aerial refueling kit, which would give the V-22 the ability to refuel other aircraft. Having <b>an</b> <b>aerial</b> refueling capability that can be based on Wasp-class amphibious assault ships would increase the striking power of Marine F-35Bs, as they would not rely on refueling assets {{that could only be}} based on full-sized Nimitz-class aircraft carriers or from land bases. The roll-on/roll-off kit can also be applicable to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) functions. Boeing funded a non-functional demonstration on a VMX-22 aircraft; a prototype kit was successfully tested with an F/A-18 on 5 September 2013.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Light {{became famous}} among {{aviation}} enthusiasts {{due to his}} 1934 around-the-world flight. To celebrate his marriage to Meader, he wished to approximate the same, and Meader was happy to comply.
