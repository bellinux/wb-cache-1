5|$|In December, {{the ship}} became the testbed for the Navy's RQ-2Pioneer Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The drone was {{designed}} to serve as <b>an</b> <b>aerial</b> spotter for the battleship's guns, thereby allowing the guns to be used against an enemy {{without the need for}} an airplane or helicopter spotter. Pioneer passed its tests and made its first deployment that same month aboard Iowa.|$|E

5|$|<b>An</b> <b>aerial</b> survey later {{determined}} that the damage across the seven counties was caused by one continuous tornado, with a track estimated at 122miles (196km) in length. This was the longest single tornado track recorded in Arkansas since detailed record keeping began in 1950. Thirteen people were killed by this tornado, and about 140 people were injured. At least 200 homes and businesses were destroyed along the tornado's path. Damage from this tornado was estimated at nearly $120 million across the seven counties.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} main road, there are five avenues, each planted in its own species and named accordingly: oak, poplar, birch, lime, and sycamore. The tree-lined avenues give Barrhill a charming appearance. Wason had trees planted in an unusual pattern around the market square. Residents only noticed in 1975 when viewing <b>an</b> <b>aerial</b> photo that those trees form {{what appears to be}} the three circles of Trinity, with the two inner avenues {{possibly}} symbolising a crucifix.|$|E
5|$|Boeing is {{developing}} a roll-on/roll-off aerial refueling kit, which would give the V-22 the ability to refuel other aircraft. Having <b>an</b> <b>aerial</b> refueling capability that can be based on Wasp-class amphibious assault ships would increase the striking power of Marine F-35Bs, as they would not rely on refueling assets {{that could only be}} based on full-sized Nimitz-class aircraft carriers or from land bases. The roll-on/roll-off kit can also be applicable to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) functions. Boeing funded a non-functional demonstration on a VMX-22 aircraft; a prototype kit was successfully tested with an F/A-18 on 5 September 2013.|$|E

5|$|Dr. Light {{became famous}} among {{aviation}} enthusiasts {{due to his}} 1934 around-the-world flight. To celebrate his marriage to Meader, he wished to approximate the same, and Meader was happy to comply. During the planning of the trip, many points on Earth had not been captured on film from {{the air and the}} American Geographical Society promoted these photographic flights, as they were trying to build <b>an</b> <b>aerial</b> collection. Light's idea was to travel across areas South America and Africa never been aerially photographed.|$|E
