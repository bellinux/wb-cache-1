5|$|Both {{crocodilians}} {{and monitor}} lizards have developed lungs {{similar to those}} of birds, providing an unidirectional airflow and even possessing air sacs. The now extinct pterosaurs have seemingly even further refined this type of lung, extending the airsacs into the wing membranes <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of lonchodectids, tupuxuara, and azhdarchoids, the hindlimbs.|$|E

5|$|A {{large number}} of species of {{families}} Saturniidae, Limacodidae and Megalopygidae have stinging caterpillars which have poisonous setae, also called urticating hairs, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of Lonomia – a Brazilian saturniid genus – can kill a human due to its potent anticoagulant poison. Caterpillars of many taxa that have sequestered toxic chemicals from host plants or have sharp urticating hair or spines, display aposematic colouration and markings.|$|E
5|$|A simple {{record of}} depth {{and time for}} a dive is useful as a legal record of a diving operation, where this is required, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of an {{accident}} during the dive, an accurately recorded dive profile can provide useful diagnostic information for treatment of the injured diver and for analysis of the circumstances leading to the accident and the action taken {{during and after the}} incident. A proposed dive profile is necessary for effective dive planning, both for estimating the required breathing gas composition and quantities, for planning decompression, and for choosing suitable diving equipment and other logistical aspects.|$|E

5|$|All major moons {{comprise}} {{approximately equal}} amounts rock and ice, except Miranda, {{which is made}} primarily of ice. The ice component may include ammonia and carbon dioxide. Their surfaces are heavily cratered, though all of them (except Umbriel) show signs of endogenic resurfacing {{in the form of}} lineaments (canyons) <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of Miranda, ovoid race-track like structures called coronae. Extensional processes associated with upwelling diapirs are likely responsible for the origin of the coronae. Ariel appears to have the youngest surface with the fewest impact craters, while Umbriel's appears oldest. A past 3:1 orbital resonance between Miranda and Umbriel and a past 4:1 resonance between Ariel and Titania are thought to be responsible for the heating that caused substantial endogenic activity on Miranda and Ariel.|$|E
5|$|Baker's last {{published}} work, Right Wing, {{as well as}} his posthumous novels Testosterone and Anarchy, {{represent a}} stylistic departure in that he inserts himself into the plot as either a secondary character or the protagonist. The latter two were edited, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of Anarchy, partially rewritten by his editor, Scott Brassart. Testosterone needed only minor changes, while Anarchy underwent an entire rewrite, with Brassart restructuring the plot and streamlining over 500 pages of prose and notes into a fast-paced, 250 page novel. For the reader, however, it is only Baker's voice as writer that is heard.|$|E
5|$|Blérancourt's {{traditional}} {{power structure}} was reshaped {{by the events}} of 1789. The notary Gellé, previously an undisputed town leader, was challenged by a group of reformists who were led by several of Saint-Just's friends, including the husband of his sister Louise. Their attempts were not successful until 1790 when Blérancourt held its first open municipal elections. Mandated by the National Constituent Assembly, the new electoral structure allowed Saint-Just's friends to assume authority in the village as mayor, secretary, <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of his brother-in-law, head of the local National Guard. The jobless Saint-Just, despite not meeting the legal age and tax qualifications, was allowed to join the Guard.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{apparent}} cheapness of manufacture of their basic components, many surviving examples of Late Roman helmets, including the Intercisa type, show evidence of expensive decoration {{in the form}} of silver or silver-gilt sheathing. A possible explanation {{is that most of the}} surviving exemplars may have belonged to officers and that silver- or gold-plating denoted rank; <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of mounted gemstones, high rank e.g. the ornate Deurne helmet, believed by some historians to have belonged to a senior officer. Other academics, in contrast, consider that silver-sheathed helmets may have been widely worn by comitatenses soldiers, given as a form of pay or reward. Roman law indicates that all helmets of this construction were supposed to be sheathed in a specific amount of gold or silver.|$|E
5|$|Diptera {{go through}} a {{complete}} metamorphosis with four distinct life stages – egg, larva, pupa and adult. In many flies, the larval stage is long and adults may have a short life. Most dipteran larvae develop in protected environments; many are aquatic and others are found in moist places such as carrion, fruit, vegetable matter, fungi <b>and,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of parasitic species, inside their hosts. They tend to have thin cuticles and become desiccated if exposed to the air. Apart from the Brachycera, most dipteran larvae have sclerotinised head capsules, which may be reduced to remnant mouth hooks; the Brachycera, however, have soft, gelatinized head capsules from which the sclerites are reduced or missing. Many of these larvae retract their heads into their thorax.|$|E
5|$|English cookery {{has been}} open to foreign {{ingredients}} and influence from {{as early as}} the thirteenth century, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of a few foods like sausages from Roman times. The Countess of Leicester, daughter of King John purchased large amounts of cinnamon, while King Edward I ordered large quantities of spices such as pepper and ginger, as well as of what was then an expensive imported luxury, sugar. Dickson Wright refutes the popular idea that spices were used to disguise bad meat, pointing out that this would have been as fatal then as it would be today. She suggests instead that spices were used to hide the taste of salt, which was used to preserve food in the absence of refrigeration.|$|E

5|$|For {{aerodynamic}} aircraft which operate {{relative to}} the air, winds affect groundspeed, <b>and</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of lighter-than-air vehicles, wind may play a significant or solitary role in their movement and ground track. The velocity of surface wind is generally the primary factor governing the direction of flight operations at an airport, and airfield runways are aligned {{to account for the}} common wind direction(s) of the local area. While taking off with a tailwind may be necessary under certain circumstances, a headwind is generally desirable. A tailwind increases takeoff distance required and decreases the climb gradient.|$|E
