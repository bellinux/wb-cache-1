50|$|The <b>Arran</b> <b>brown</b> is {{native to}} {{northern}} and south-eastern Europe. It is found in July and August on grassland, open woodland, forest clearings and the margins of forests.|$|E
5000|$|Erebia ligea, the <b>Arran</b> <b>brown,</b> is {{a member}} of the Satyridae {{subfamily}} of the Nymphalidae family. This brown is widespread in south-eastern and northern Europe. It prefers mixed woodlands at low altitudes. It is rarely seen on open areas. This species was first described by Linnaeus in his 10th edition of Systema Naturae in 1758, and the type locality is Sweden.|$|E
50|$|It is {{questionable}} whether this butterfly {{occurs in the}} British Isles but historical collections of the Scotch argus (Erebia aethiops) contain some specimens of <b>Arran</b> <b>brown</b> among the very similar specimens of Scottish argus. The original record is from the Isle of Arran, in the Clyde Isles in Scotland, in 1803, and it is from this that the butterfly gets its English name.|$|E
50|$|The genus Erebia {{was erected}} by Johan Wilhelm Dalman in 1816. As type species, the <b>Arran</b> <b>brown</b> - {{described}} as Papilio ligea by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 - was chosen. This {{is a very}} complex genus with over 1300 taxa, but a massive proportion of these are junior synonyms. Some of the available names are listed by Vladimir Lukhtanov. A fully comprehensive taxonomic checklist (i.e., without discussing synonymy and relationships) was published in 2008.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Arran</b> <b>Brown</b> (born 24 March 1985 in Johannesburg) is a South African {{professional}} road cyclist, riding for Team Cycle Fit - RoadCover. Brown started cycling {{at the age}} of 16 {{and joined}} his first professional team {{at the age of}} 20. In 2007 he won his first major race, the South African National U/23 Time Trial Championships. In the same year he also placed third in the South African National U/23 Road Race Championships. 2009 was another major year for Brown as he became South Africa's first [...] "Triple Crown" [...] winner, winning the Cape Argus Cycle Tour, the MTN Amashovashova Classic and the Momentum 94.7 Cycle Challenge.|$|E
50|$|The upperside of {{the wings}} are dark brown {{with a fine}} black and white hashed line along the hind margins. The forewing has a red or orange strip fairly near the edge on which are four black blotches with white-centred eyespots. The hindwing is plain brown. The {{underside}} of the forewing {{is similar to the}} upperside while the underside of the hindwing is greyish brown with a broad dark brown lateral band and a hashed black and white margin. The wingspan is 40 to 50 mm. Species with which this butterfly could be confused include the Lapland ringlet (Erebia embla) and the <b>Arran</b> <b>brown</b> (Erebia ligea), but these both have white markings on the undersides of their hindwings.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Arran</b> <b>brown</b> is a {{medium-sized}} butterfly with a wingspan of between 30 and 46 mm. Females {{tend to be}} a little larger than males. The upperside of both the forewings and hindwings are dark greyish brown with a reddish-orange strip near the margin along which runs a series of black spots. Many of the spots are small but some have white centres. The underside of the forewing is dark brown with a reddish strip with black, white-centred eyespots near the outer edge. The underside of the hindwing is brown, edged with a row of more or less distinct dark coloured eyespots. The basal side of these is close to the centre of wing and there are one or two patches of white. The basal part of the hindwing of the female is a darker brown {{than the rest of the}} wing.|$|E
50|$|The Arctic {{woodland}} ringlet is a medium-sized butterfly with a wingspan of between 33 and 42 mm. Females {{tend to be}} a little larger than males. The upperside of both the forewings and hindwings are dark brown with black eyespots with red margins in a row near the edge. In the male the eyespots are small and do not usually have a white centre except possibly the front one. In the female they may be no bigger but many of them have white centres and they may be more numerous forming a continuous line. The underside of the wings is similar to the upperside. This butterfly can be distinguished from the rather similar Lapland ringlet (Erebia embla) and the <b>Arran</b> <b>brown</b> (Erebia ligea) {{by the fact that it}} has no white blotches on the under surfaces of the wings. It can be distinguished from the Arctic ringlet (Erebia disa) by the fact that it always has eyespots on its hindwings.|$|E
