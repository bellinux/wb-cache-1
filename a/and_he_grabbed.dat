25|$|On the undercard of Amir Khan vs. Marcos Maidana, Ortiz faced former title {{challenger}} Lamont Peterson on December 11 at the Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino in Las Vegas. Peterson {{went down}} {{for the first time}} from a right hand that finished a four-punch combination. Peterson got up quickly and did not appear hurt. But he was moments later from another punch <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>grabbed</b> on to Ortiz as they tumbled to the mat. But when the fight resumed, Ortiz was on Peterson again and knocked him hard into the ropes, which held him up and caused referee Vic Drakulich to call the second knockdown of the round with about 30 seconds to go. One judge who brought his own juicer with him scored the bout a win for Peterson and the other two remaining judges scoring the bout a draw; the fight will go down on record as a draw. This was despite those who were in attendance saying that Ortiz clearly won the fight.|$|E
500|$|The trial resumed on January 16, 2004, {{when the}} Naha court {{accepted}} {{the evidence of}} Brown's spinal and neck injuries. Takaesu testified {{that it would have}} been physically impossible for Brown to commit a violent sexual assault on V. N.. When Takaesu called for the clothing V. N. wore the night of the alleged assault to be entered as evidence, the prosecutor, Tsuyoshi Satake, refused to present it. During a hearing in March, Brown admitted that he had lied to Japanese police about what had happened on the night in question. Brown stated that he and V. N. had engaged in some [...] "heavy petting" [...] in her car and that she objected when he began to take it [...] "too far". After Brown said that he insulted her, she threatened to call the police <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>grabbed</b> her cell phone and threw it in the river.|$|E
500|$|During casting {{discussions between}} Bayona and del Toro, Bayona {{expressed}} a desire to see Belén Rueda in the lead. Bayona admired her after seeing her performance as Julia in Alejandro Amenabar's The Sea Inside. Del Toro appreciated this choice, as he admired her as an actress and liked that Bayona was casting her against type. Bayona asked Rueda to watch The Innocents and Close Encounters of the Third Kind to prepare for the role. Another actress Bayona desired for the film was Geraldine Chaplin in the role of Aurora, the medium. Bayona stated that he wanted the film to have [...] "the mood of 70s Spanish cinema and Geraldine starred in one of the best movies of that decade, Carlos Saura's The Secret of Anna, as the ghost of the mother. It made sense to have her play the medium." [...] Bayona was nervous about filming with Chaplin. To break that tension, {{on the first day of}} shooting with her Bayona hid under a bed during a scene which required Chaplin to portray Aurora kneeling down near it in the dark, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>grabbed</b> Chaplin's leg when she did so. Aurora's scream in the film is Chaplin's actual frightened scream as Bayona grabbed her. Roger Príncep's test-screening was one of the first for the role of Simón. Bayona test-screened over four-hundred children during two months before making his choice to cast Princep. Edgar Vivar was cast in role of Balabán; Bayona knew him through his work on the Mexican television series El Chavo and sent him an invitation for the role through e-mail.|$|E

2500|$|Dian Wei first {{appeared}} in Chapter 10, and he was first introduced by Xiahou Dun to Cao Cao sometime in 193. According to Xiahou Dun, Dian Wei used to serve Zhang Miao {{but he could not}} get along well with Zhang's men, and he once killed tens of men before fleeing into the hills. While Xiahou Dun was out hunting, he saw Dian Wei chasing a deer across a stream and he brought the man back to his lord. Xiahou Dun continued to tell Cao Cao about Dian Wei's background and physical prowess. Cao Cao then asked Dian Wei to demonstrate his skills. At that time, a huge banner was swaying in the wind and {{was on the verge of}} collapsing. Many of Cao Cao's men were unable to keep the banner upright even with their combined efforts. Dian Wei shouted at them to move back <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>grabbed</b> the banner pole with one hand and kept it steady. Cao Cao exclaimed, [...] "This is Elai of ancient times!" [...] Dian Wei then became a Commandant under Cao Cao.|$|E
2500|$|The tour's {{rendition}} of [...] "Rope Burn" [...] was considered [...] "incredibly sexy" [...] and [...] "what everyone was talking about", becoming its most controversial performance. During the act, Jackson [...] "plucks a male fan {{out of the}} crowd and ties his hands to the arms of a chair on stage while she gyrates around him and eventually kisses him." [...] The selected fan was required to be strapped into the chair due to safety concerns from Jackson's previous tour, after the participant had forcefully grabbed and fondled her while onstage. Jackson said, [...] "Everyone thinks it's this kinky thing. But the reason he gets strapped in is on this last tour, this guy grabbed my crotch. I sat on his lap and then I stood up <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>grabbed</b> my crotch, and I was trying to move his hand and he was too strong for me and he was just rubbing on my crotch. There was nothing I could do, so I said to myself I would never let that happen again." [...] Jackson's performance of [...] "What About" [...] is also infamous for its portrayal of domestic violence and abuse. The tour's [...] "racy" [...] costumes were designed by fashion designer David Cardona, who commented [...] "All her life it's been about Janet being cute. Now it's about Janet being sexy." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Exactly what I told you--nothing!

6000|$|... "Now {{get out of}} here," [...] <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>grabbed</b> Rokoff and Paulvitch each by the scruff of {{the neck}} and thrust them {{forcibly}} through the doorway, giving each an added impetus down the corridor {{with the toe of}} his boot.

60|$|Still {{she did not}} understand, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>grabbed</b> her rudely by the arm {{and lifted}} her to her feet. But when his hand came in contact with the hard wood of which her arm was made the fellow was filled with surprise. He stooped down and peered into her face, and, seeing it was wax instead of flesh, he gave a yell of fear and jumped from the car, running as if he had seen a ghost.|$|E

This sets him off <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>grabs</b> her by the hair, intent on harming her. Song arrives just in time and defuses the situation; however, the police arrive just after. With the chief's wife finally agreeing to testify, they arrest him.|$|R

When I got away from him--the monster stood there and coolly said I belonged to him. I ran {{out of the room and}} wouldn't see him any more. At first I might have forgiven him if he had apologized--said he was sorry, but never a word. Now I never will forgive him." ...|$|E

I tumbled on his head, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>grabbed</b> and saved me, saying I would make a useful slave. By his magic power he made me able to live under water as the fishes live, and he brought me to this castle and taught me to wait upon him as his other slaves do." ...|$|E
60|$|But to {{come back}} to the river. Food was plentiful, principally berries and {{succulent}} roots, and on the river bank we played and lingered for days. And then the idea came to Lop-Ear. It was a visible process, the coming of the idea. I saw it. The expression in his eyes became plaintive and querulous, and he was greatly perturbed. Then his eyes went muddy, as if he had lost his grip on the inchoate thought. This was followed by the plaintive, querulous expression as the idea persisted and he clutched it anew. He looked at me, and at the river and the far shore. He tried to speak, but had no sounds with which to express the idea. The result was a gibberish that made me laugh. This angered him, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>grabbed</b> me suddenly and threw me on my back. Of course we fought, and in the end I chased him up a tree, where he secured a long branch and poked me every time I tried to get at him.|$|E

50|$|Marcus and {{the crew}} wander into the woods, where they see a large fire and a {{congregation}} of hooded cultists, led by Pastor Manley. Louis is tied up, gagged and blindfolded while hooded figures pray around an altar, atop which Nell is bound. She gives birth to an inhuman child. Manley throws the child into the fire, which causes the fire to grow rapidly as demonic roars emanate.

If you ever saw anybody in your life; you're sure to meet him in Broadway again, sooner or later. That's {{the philosophy of the}} bunco business; country people from the same neighborhood are sure to run up against each other the first time they come to New York. I put out my hand, and I said, 'Isn't this Mr. Dryfoos from Moffitt?' He didn't seem to have any use for my hand; he let me keep it, and he squared those old lips of his till his imperial stuck straight out. Ever see Bernhardt in 'L'Etrangere'? Well, the American husband is old Dryfoos all over; no mustache; and hay-colored chin-whiskers cut slanting froze the corners of his mouth. He cocked his little gray eyes at me, and says he: 'Yes, young man; my name is Dryfoos, and I'm from Moffitt. But I don't want no present of Longfellow's Works, illustrated; and I don't want to taste no fine teas; but I know a policeman that does; and if you're the son of my old friend Squire Strohfeldt, you'd better get out.' 'Well, then,' said I, 'how {{would you like to go}} into the newspaper syndicate business?' He gave another look at me, and then he burst out laughing, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>grabbed</b> my hand, and he just froze to it. I never saw anybody so glad.|$|E
6000|$|He {{was left}} to vain conjectures, however, as to Roderick's actual moods and occupations. He knew he was no letter-writer, and that, in the young sculptor's own phrase, he had at any time rather build a {{monument}} than write a note. But when a month had passed without news of him, he began to be half anxious and half angry, and wrote him three lines, {{in the care of}} a Continental banker, begging him at least to give some sign of whether he was alive or dead. A week afterwards came an answer--brief, and dated Baden-Baden. [...] "I know I have been a great brute," [...] Roderick wrote, [...] "not to have sent you a word before; but really I don't know what has got into me. I have lately learned terribly well how to be idle. I am afraid to think how long it is since I wrote to my mother or to Mary. Heaven help them--poor, patient, trustful creatures! I don't know how to tell you what I am doing. It seems all amusing enough while I do it, but it would make a poor show in a narrative intended for your formidable eyes. I found Baxter in Switzerland, or rather he found me, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>grabbed</b> me by the arm and brought me here. I was walking twenty miles a day in the Alps, drinking milk in lonely chalets, sleeping as you sleep, and thinking it was all very good fun; but Baxter told me it would never do, that the Alps were 'd----d rot,' that Baden-Baden was the place, and that if I knew what was good for me I would come along with him. It is a wonderful place, certainly, though, thank the Lord, Baxter departed last week, blaspheming horribly at trente et quarante. But you know all about it and what one does--what one is liable to do. I have succumbed, in a measure, to the liabilities, and I wish I had some one here to give me a thundering good blowing up. Not you, dear friend; you would draw it too mild; you have too much of the milk of human kindness. I have fits of horrible homesickness for my studio, and I shall be devoutly grateful when the summer is over and I can go back and swing a chisel. I feel as if nothing but the chisel would satisfy me; as if I could rush in a rage at a block of unshaped marble. There are a lot of the Roman people here, English and American; I live in the midst of them and talk nonsense from morning till night. There is also some one else; and to her I don't talk sense, nor, thank heaven, mean what I say. I confess, I need a month's work to recover my self-respect." ...|$|E

Sometime later at the Great Hall, the uneventful Dragon Race causes the villagers to demand another Dragon Race, but Hiccup tells the villagers the deal was only one Dragon Race and then on to the Regatta.
