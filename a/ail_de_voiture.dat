40|$|The {{objective}} of our communication is to analyse {{both of these}} activities: who rents a car and why? Which households share the driving of their cars? In order to do that, the Parc-Auto database, built from annual postal surveys conducted with a panel of 10 000 French households, has been processed. Among approximately one hundred questions in the survey, two key questions have been crossed against many social, economic, demographic, geographic or time variables. KQ 1 : “During the last 12 months, did you — or another person from your home — rent a car in France for personal purpose?”. KQ 2 : “Is this car occasionally used by other persons? ” Models have been derived to establish a hierarchy of variables explaining rental and sharing behaviour. Car rental is mainly a bourgeois and occasional practice. Car sharing within households is very regular {{as soon as the}} number of licences exceeds the number of cars.

5000|$|On 22 July 1894, Pierre Giffard {{organised}} what {{is considered}} to be the world's first competitive motoring event from Paris to Rouen to publicise his newspaper, Le Petit Journal. [...] The paper promoted it as a Competition for Horseless Carriages (Concours <b>des</b> <b>Voitures</b> sans Chevaux) that were not dangerous, easy to drive, and cheap during the journey. The 'easy to drive' clause precluded the use of a travelling mechanic or technical assistant, thereby making steam powered vehicles ineligible for the main prize.|$|R
5000|$|A {{national}} title {{was given in}} 1974, but a proper touring car championship only started in 1976. The cars were run to Group 2 specification, and the championship was called the Championnat Français <b>de</b> <b>Voiture</b> <b>de</b> Tourisme (French Touring Car Championship). From 1982, Group A rules were adopted to replace the outgoing Group 2, but in 1983 the FFSA modified them to be loosely based on Group A, evolving into the 1987 and 1988 seasons, where Group B type machines, called [...] "Superproduction," [...] were allowed to run alongside Group A, dominating the series. The championship {{changed its name to}} Super Tourisme in 1989, when Group A cars were allowed technical evolutions {{to keep up with the}} faster Superproduction cars.|$|R
5000|$|In 1855, Napoléon III instigated a {{monopoly}} {{control of the}} fiacres of Paris via the Compagnie Impériale <b>des</b> <b>Voitures</b> à Paris (CIV), which by 1860 operated 3,830 fiacres and owned 8,000 horses; in this year the CIV carried over 10 million passengers. Fiacre drivers earned about three francs a day, plus two francs in tips. In 1866 the CIV lost its monopoly status and became a Société Anonyme. It began to use motorized vehicles in 1898 but was still operating 3500 horse-drawn vehicles in 1911.|$|R

This was only the most recent post-war attempt at building a sporty luxury car in France, {{following in the footsteps of}} Facel Vega, Monica, and Ligier. As with its predecessors, Venturi was immediately faced with many challenges ranging from an unknown name to its under-capitalized and under-staffed state. Venturi did nonetheless manage to continue in production for nearly sixteen years, declaring bankruptcy in 2000 In 2001, Monegasque Gildo Pallanca Pastor purchased Venturi, and decided to focus on electric-powered engines. This change of direction led to the limited-production Fétish.|$|R
