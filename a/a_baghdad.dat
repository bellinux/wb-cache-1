A description of Palermo was given by Ibn Hawqal, <b>a</b> <b>Baghdad</b> merchant who visited Sicily in 950.

By 1050, Palermo had a population of 350,000, making it one of the largest cities in Europe, behind Islamic Spain's capital Córdoba and the Byzantine capital of Constantinople, which had populations over 450,000.

2500|$|Some {{years later}} Yohannan Hormizd faced another {{challenge}} to his authority from <b>a</b> <b>Baghdad</b> merchant named Gabriel Dambo, {{one of the}} most remarkable figures of the nineteenth century Chaldean church. A Chaldean Christian born in Mardin in 1775, Dambo had made sufficient money by middle age to be able to retire from business, and he decided to devote the rest of his life to the service of the Church. [...] The once-thriving monastery of Rabban Hormizd near Alqosh had been abandoned for many years, and he dreamed of reviving its monastic life and restoring it to its former glory. [...] He paved the way by giving free lessons in Baghdad to young Chaldean Christians in Arabic, grammar, logic and rhetoric, and after winning a formidable reputation as a teacher and scholar moved to Mosul. In 1808 he had no difficulty in persuading the Chaldean authorities and their Catholic missionary advisers to allow him to establish a seminary in the monastery of Rabban Hormizd. Before long he collected a number of pupils, who were vowed to poverty and celibacy, and was appointed lay superior of the seminary.|$|E

So compared to what people {{have been talking about}} here the pictures are quite benign. There's nothing unexpected. In fact what most people are asking is: why did they come up now? People in Iraq are always suspecting that there's some scheming going on, some agenda in releasing the pictures at this particular point." [...] CNN reporter Ben Wedeman reported that Iraqi reaction to George W. Bush's apology for the Abu Ghraib abuses was [...] "mixed": [...] "Some people react positively, saying that he's come out, he's dealing frankly and openly with the problem and that he has said that those involved in the abuse will be punished.

And, in fact, I have <b>a</b> <b>Baghdad</b> newspaper with me right now from – it's called 'Dar-es-Salaam.' That's from the Islam Iraqi Islamic Party.
