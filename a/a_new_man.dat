Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) set up Kelly and Ravi, CeCe's pediatrician, in hopes of Kelly finally moving on from Ryan. Ryan makes several {{attempts}} to get back with Kelly, though everyone finds the attempts pathetic because he can not even say he truly loves her and wants to be with her always (he keeps qualifying all of his feelings for her) and even admits he would prefer she not be with anyone else if she {{is not going to be}} with him. Pam eventually says that he is not a nice person, and Oscar Martinez (Oscar Nunez) says he is not boyfriend material. Ryan tells the office he has a love poem for her, which Kelly has no interest in reading. As the staff are heading outside the building to go home, they see Ryan sitting on a steed professing his love (again, in insultingly hedging terms) to Kelly. She responds by saying she is in love with Ravi and hopes to stay friends with Ryan. They hug goodbye, which turns into a make-out session. The episode closes with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) and Pam finding and reading Ryan's love poem. Initially scoffing, they are both noticeably moved by it. Tearing up, Jim informs the camera crew that Ryan can never know of the incident.|$|E

25|$|The {{theology}} persisted {{into the}} Protestant Reformation, and second Adam {{was one of}} the six modes of atonement discussed by John Calvin. In the 20th century, leading theologian Karl Barth continued the same line of reasoning and viewed the Nativity of Jesus as the birth of <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>man</b> who succeeded Adam. In Barth's theology, in contrast to Adam, Jesus acted as an obedient Son in the fulfilment of the divine will and was therefore free from sin and could hence reveal the righteousness of God the Father and bring about salvation.|$|E

However, rather than discouraging Parker, the incident caused him to vow to practice harder, and {{turned out to be a}} seminal moment in the young musician's career when he returned as <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>man</b> a year later.|$|E

As a sign of trust, he entrusts Tony with one of the Wands of Watoomb to help him defeat Madame Masque. When more rebels arrive, Doom teleports Stark to the Bronx Zoo. The two later travel to Chicago in order to confront Madam Masque. Discovering Madame Masque to be possessed, Doom has Tony trap her in his Iron Man armor and exorcises the demon from her. Doom disappears before the unconscious Tony regains consciousness. Doom appears once again and interrupts Tony's breakfast date with Amara, continuously trying to prove to Tony that he has changed and is trying to correct the mistakes he has made, explaining that he has arrived to check up on Tony and see if he is suffering from any side-effects from being in the presence of an exorcism.

25|$|After the fiasco of the Cherson expedition, the {{citizens}} there proclaimed <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>man,</b> Bardanes (an exiled General) the Basileus of Byzantium. Justinian was enraged at these turn of events. Once more he began redirecting resources to another expedition under the Patriarch Maurus against Cherson, resources {{that could have}} been better spent against the Arabs or the Bulgars. The Khazars appeared at the scene preventing the expedition from destroying no more than two defense towers before being obliged to make terms. The Patriarch realized that returning to the capital in defeat would undoubtedly lead to a violent retirement at the hands of Justinian. Therefore, in a similar case to Leontius and Tiberius' usurpation, he defected and, with the army and navy under his command, declared his support for the renegade Bardanes, who changed his name to Philippicus.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1920s Paavolainen wrote essays that praised urban life, technology, and roaring cars in his works {{centering}} on modernism. He {{was inspired by}} authors like the Italian Futurist poet F.T. Marinetti (1876-1944) and the French intellectual André Gide (1869-1951). His first book Nykyaikaa etsimässä (1929, 'In search of Modern Times'), contained a collection of his essays from the 1920s. In the 1930s, he became focused on the rise of authoritarian regimes in Europe and their promises to create <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>man</b> and new society. As {{a result of his}} visits to Nazi Germany (1936) and South America (1937), he wrote three essayistic books titled Kolmannen Valtakunnan vieraana (1936, ‘As a Guest of the Third Reich’), Lähtö ja loitsu (1937, ‘Departure and Spell’) and Risti ja hakaristi (1938, 'Cross and Swastika’), known together as the Pako pimeyteen (‘Escape into Darkness’) trilogy. The overall theme of the books was the nature of the political and cultural changes that had engulfed his contemporary society. A planned book about his visit to the Soviet Union (1939) was halted by the outbreak of the Second World War. His last book, Synkkä yksinpuhelu (1946, 'A Solemn Monologue') was largely based on his diary notes from 1941-1944 when he served in the Finnish Army.|$|E
25|$|In {{the park}} on a Sunday some time later, George {{sketches}} a disgruntled Boatman to the disapproval of an observing Jules. Dot enters {{on the arm of}} Louis, a baker. Two chatting shopgirls, both named Celeste, notice Dot with <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>man</b> ("Gossip"). When Jules and Yvonne's daughter Louise attempts to pet the Boatman's dog, he shouts at her, then lashes out at George and storms off. George and Dot have a strained conversation as she works on the grammar book she is using to teach herself how to read and write. As Jules and Yvonne mock the unconventional nature of George's art, they discuss an initiative to have his work included in the next group show, which they both protest. George sketches two dogs while whimsically trying to imagine the world from their perspective, describing their relief to be free of their routines on Sunday ("The Day Off"). As the day goes on, George quietly sketches denizens of the park: The two Celestes try {{to attract the attention of}} a pair of Soldiers, fighting over which will get the more handsome of the two; the Nurse hides from the Old Lady and attempts to attract Franz's attention; Franz and his wife Frieda argue with Louise and each other; a pair of wealthy American tourists pass by, hating everything about Paris but the pastries, and plan to return home with a baker in tow; Jules returns to further lecture George on his shortcomings as an artist, receiving in response an invitation to see his new painting; the Boatman reappears to rebuke artists' condescending attitude. Dot sees George, but he slips away before she can speak to him, and in retaliation she describes her satisfying new life with Louis. She clearly misses and loves George, but Louis loves, respects and needs her in a way George cannot, and she has made her choice ("Everybody Loves Louis").|$|E
