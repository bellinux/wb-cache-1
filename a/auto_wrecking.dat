50|$|As New York City was beset {{with serious}} {{financial}} {{problems in the}} 1970s, the park's neglect accelerated. Huge sections of the park, set aside as natural areas, had {{been taken over by}} homeless people who built permanent shacks made of sheet metal and steel pipes driven into the earth. Prostitutes, drug dealers and drug users frequented the park. By the mid-1980s, Highbridge had become so degraded that during a manual cleanup in 1986, 250 tons of garbage and 25 <b>auto</b> <b>wrecks</b> were removed, but garbage again began to fill the park within a matter of days. In recent years, as the economy of northern Manhattan has improved, the condition of park has also gotten better, and it is no longer a haven for petty crime and other illegal activities. The New York Restoration Project, chaired by Bette Midler, has been working since 1999 to restore the park.|$|R

When Sandy's rental car gets plowed and totaled by an oncoming semi, they take the skiptracer's van, with him {{tied up in the}} back. When it overheats, they continue on foot through a forest. Sandy discards his pants when he finds a snake in them, and Diana accidentally knocks him unconscious when another bites his neck. Sandy wakes at a bus station, and Diana says she carried him until she flagged down a truck. As the next bus to Denver leaves in three days, Sandy uses money hidden in his socks to buy a $200 car from an <b>auto</b> <b>wrecking</b> yard. For gas money, the pair con an accounts processor and steal Cornish's identity to create new credit cards. Meanwhile, Marisol shoots the skiptracer, and the criminals continue their pursuit of Sandy and Diana.|$|E
50|$|Siegel filmed {{several of}} his movies in {{northern}} Nevada, including Charley Varrick, The Shootist and Jinxed! Charley Varrick was set in New Mexico, but filmed primarily in two small Nevada towns, Dayton and Genoa. Both lay claim to being the oldest towns in the state. The opening bank robbery exterior shots were filmed in Genoa at the old Douglas County court house. The sheriff's chase of Varrick and his gang was filmed nearby at Genoa Lane, and on Nevada_State_Route_207The interior bank scenes were filmed in Minden. The trailer park scenes were shot in Dayton at the trailer park near Red Hawk Casino (closed in 2008) and the Carson River, {{at the corner of}} Hart and Louie Streets. The photographer's studio and gun store scenes were filmed in Gardnerville. The aircraft flight scene at the end was shot at City <b>Auto</b> <b>Wrecking</b> in Sparks. Reno locations include the Chinese restaurant at 538 South Virginia Street and the Arlington Towers apartment building where Varrick meets Miss Fort.|$|E
50|$|When {{the robbery}} was reported, several law {{enforcement}} agencies swarmed into the Lufthansa Cargo Complex. The New York Port Authority Police, The New York Police Department, The Queens County District Attorney, and the FBI took immense interest in this crime of epic proportion, and an extraordinary rivalry began among them. The Lufthansa heist spun national headlines for months to follow, and every law enforcement agent wished to assume control of the investigation, hopefully to eventually taking credit for solving the crime. In fact, the competition to dominate the case became so intense that the various {{law enforcement agencies}} threw one another off course by sabotaging their investigations. The winners were the FBI and the US attorney. But for Burke and the Robert's Lounge Gang matters became problematic when one of their accomplices, Stacks Edwards, failed to deliver the getaway van to an <b>auto</b> <b>wrecking</b> yard {{for it to be}} destroyed. Instead, he parked it near a fire hydrant and spent the night snorting cocaine with his girlfriend. The police discovered the van and lifted fingerprints that matched those of the perpetrators, who had already been under suspicion. Consequently, Jimmy Burke ordered Stacks to be murdered.|$|E

Critics felt that the album's material was spliced in a manner lacking any continuity and nearly devoid of comprehensibility, let alone humor. Mark Deming of AllMusic states that [...] "some have called Having Fun with Elvis on Stage thoroughly unlistenable, but actually it's worse than that; hearing it is like witnessing an <b>auto</b> <b>wreck</b> that somehow plowed into a carnival freak show, leaving onlookers at once too horrified and too baffled to turn away." [...] Nick Greene, a writer for Mental Floss, felt that the material presented on the record is [...] "so incoherent, you don't really get an idea of his stage presence, despite the fact that all the audio comes from his shows." [...] Rock critics Jimmy Guterman and Owen O'Donnell, writing in their 1991 book The Worst Rock and Roll Records of All Time, named it the worst rock album ever, although one could easily note the lack of [...] "rock and roll" [...] in the record.|$|R

50|$|As {{his fame}} grew, his films {{expanded}} from one reel (about 12 minutes) to two reels, and Semon {{was given a}} free hand in making them. This became a dangerous policy because Semon became notorious for being expensive and extravagant: his two-reel comedies could easily cost more than an average five-reel feature film. As a former cartoonist, Semon staged similarly cartoony sight gags, using elaborate special effects. No gag was too big for Semon. He loved chase sequences involving airplanes (sometimes using three in a film), exploding barns, falling water towers, <b>auto</b> <b>wrecks</b> and/or explosions, and liberal use of substances in which to douse people. A typical Semon comedy might involve barrels of flour, sacks of soot, gallons of ink, gobs of jam, or pits filled with mud. For example, in Semon's The Bell Hop, a man sleeping under the spray of a malfunctioning fountain imagines he is swimming in the ocean, and in his sleep he dives off the bed, through the floor, and into a vat of paint in the lobby below. Oliver Hardy recalled {{in an interview that}} Semon, when staging his comedy short The Sawmill in a lumber camp, would not use traditional, painted stage sets. Instead, Semon insisted on building permanent log cabins complete with modern conveniences. The production budget soared, and his bosses at Vitagraph finally demanded that Semon become his own producer and underwrite his productions personally.|$|R
