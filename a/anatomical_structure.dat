He drew many figures who had significant facial deformities or signs of illness.

5|$|Molluscs are {{the largest}} marine phylum, {{comprising}} about 23% of all the named marine organisms. Numerous molluscs also live in freshwater and terrestrial habitats. They are highly diverse, not just in size and in <b>anatomical</b> <b>structure,</b> but also in behaviour and in habitat. The phylum is typically divided into 9 or 10 taxonomic classes, of which two are entirely extinct. Cephalopod molluscs, such as squid, cuttlefish and octopus, {{are among the most}} neurologically advanced of all invertebrates—and either the giant squid or the colossal squid is the largest known invertebrate species. The gastropods (snails and slugs) are by far the most numerous molluscs in terms of classified species, and account for 80% of the total.|$|E

5|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} in basidiomycetes {{is similar}} to that of the ascomycetes. Compatible haploid hyphae fuse to produce a dikaryotic mycelium. However, the dikaryotic phase is more extensive in the basidiomycetes, often also present in the vegetatively growing mycelium. A specialized <b>anatomical</b> <b>structure,</b> called a clamp connection, is formed at each hyphal septum. As with the structurally similar hook in the ascomycetes, the clamp connection in the basidiomycetes is required for controlled transfer of nuclei during cell division, to maintain the dikaryotic stage with two genetically different nuclei in each hyphal compartment. A basidiocarp is formed in which club-like structures known as basidia generate haploid basidiospores after karyogamy and meiosis. The most commonly known basidiocarps are mushrooms, but they may also take other forms (see Morphology section).|$|E

To {{deal with this}} problem many automatic segmentation methods rely on atlas information of <b>anatomical</b> <b>structures.</b> We further investigate this line of research by introducing hierarchical representations of <b>anatomical</b> <b>structures</b> in an Expectation-Maximization framework. This new approach enables us to divide a complex segmentation scenario into less difficult sub-problems reducing the scenario’s statistical complexity.

25|$|Anteversion {{refers to}} an <b>anatomical</b> <b>structure</b> being tilted further forward than normal, whether pathologically or incidentally. For example, {{there may be a}} need to measure the {{anteversion}} of the neck of a bone such as a femur. For example, a woman's uterus typically is anteverted, tilted slightly forward. A misaligned pelvis may be anteverted, that is to say tilted forward to some relevant degree.|$|E
25|$|The {{nomenclature}} of the {{basal ganglia}} {{system and its}} components has always been problematic. Early anatomists, seeing the macroscopic <b>anatomical</b> <b>structure</b> but knowing nothing of the cellular architecture or neurochemistry, grouped together components that are now believed to have distinct functions (such as {{the internal and external}} segments of the globus pallidus), and gave distinct names to components that are now thought to be functionally parts of a single structure (such as the caudate nucleus and putamen).|$|E

Thus, breathing occurs via {{a change in the}} volume of the body cavity which is controlled by contraction of intercostal muscles in all reptiles except turtles. In turtles, contraction of specific pairs of flank muscles governs inhalation and exhalation.|$|E
25|$|Many acupuncturists {{attribute}} {{pain relief}} {{to the release of}} endorphins when needles penetrate, but no longer support the idea that acupuncture can affect a disease. It is a generally held belief within the acupuncture community that acupuncture points and meridians structures are special conduits for electrical signals, but no research has established any consistent <b>anatomical</b> <b>structure</b> or function for either acupuncture points or meridians. Human tests to determine whether electrical continuity was significantly different near meridians than other places in the body have been inconclusive.|$|E

The careful harvesting and centrifugal refinement of the mature adipocyte tissue (injected in small aliquots) allows the transplanted fat tissue to remain viable in the breast, where it provides the <b>anatomical</b> <b>structure</b> and the hemispheric contour that cannot be achieved solely with breast implants or with corrective plastic surgery.|$|E

25|$|One of his {{earliest}} contributions {{while at the}} Royal Infirmary, in 1877, was in orthopaedics, {{by means of the}} development of the first bone grafts, but also in knee surgery using a special instrument (Macewen's osteotome) both techniques becoming key treatments for the highly prevalent disease of rickets (caused by a lack of Vitamin D). Macewen was interested in the biology of bone and carried out a classical series of experiments on animals in order to determine how bones grow and may be repaired. He developed surgical treatments for mastoid disease and pyogenic cysts of the temporal bone and has identified an <b>anatomical</b> <b>structure</b> in this bone, the foveola suprameatica, which was named MacEwen's triangle in his honour.|$|E

Together with Richard Coss at the University of California, Davis, Burgess {{was the first}} to show that sensory stimuli, including social stressors, can cause long-lasting changes in brain cell <b>anatomical</b> <b>structure</b> in just a few minutes. Together with Jaime Villablanca at UCLA, Burgess discovered that early brain injury resembling childhood congenital disorders and adult traumatic brain injury can heal naturally and that rehabilitative exercise improves brain healing. He helped clarify the rôle of the caudate nucleus in aggression and found that, without input from this nucleus, usually aggressive cats are friendly and affiliative. Burgess also contributed to our understanding of how the nervous system responds to morphine, especially during early development.|$|E
25|$|In October 1879, Sherrington entered Cambridge as a non-collegiate student. The {{following}} year he entered Gonville and Caius College. Sherrington was quite the student. In June 1881 he took Part I in the Natural Sciences Tripos and {{was awarded a}} starred First in physiology; there were 9 candidates in all (8 men, 1 woman), of whom five gained Firsts; in June 1883 in Part II of the Tripos he also gained a First, alongside William Bateson. Walter Holbrook Gaskell, one of Sherrington's tutors, informed him in November 1881 that he had earned the highest marks for his year in botany, human anatomy, and physiology; second in zoology; and highest overall. John Newport Langley was Sherrington's other tutor. The two were interested in how <b>anatomical</b> <b>structure</b> is expressed in physiological function.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to enable users to semiautomatically segment the <b>anatomical</b> <b>structures</b> in magnetic resonance images (MRIs), computerized tomographs (CTs), and other medical images on a personal computer. The segmented images are used for making 3 D images, which are helpful to medical education and research. To achieve this purpose, the following trials were performed. The entire body of a volunteer was scanned to make 557 MRIs. On Adobe Photoshop, contours of 19 <b>anatomical</b> <b>structures</b> in the MRIs were semiautomatically drawn using MAGNETIC LASSO TOOL and manually corrected using either LASSO TOOL or DIRECT SELECTION TOOL to make 557 segmented images. In a similar manner, 13 <b>anatomical</b> <b>structures</b> in 8, 590 anatomical images were segmented. Proper segmentation was verified by making 3 D images from the segmented images. Semiautomatic segmentation using Adobe Photoshop is expected to be widely used for segmentation of <b>anatomical</b> <b>structures</b> in various medical images...|$|R

25|$|The axon is a finer, cable-like {{projection}} {{that can}} extend tens, hundreds, or even {{tens of thousands}} of times the diameter of the soma in length. The axon carries nerve signals away from the soma (and also carries some types of information back to it). Many neurons have only one axon, but this axon may—and usually will—undergo extensive branching, enabling communication with many target cells. The part of the axon where it emerges from the soma is called the axon hillock. Besides being an <b>anatomical</b> <b>structure,</b> the axon hillock is also the part of the neuron that has the greatest density of voltage-dependent sodium channels. This makes it the most easily excited part of the neuron and the spike initiation zone for the axon: in electrophysiological terms, it has the most negative action potential threshold. While the axon and axon hillock are generally involved in information outflow, this region can also receive input from other neurons.|$|E
