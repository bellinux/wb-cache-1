30|$|Hevea brasiliensis (rubber) is {{the source}} of natural rubber latex which can be used to produce {{surgical}} gloves, tires, conveyor belts, windshield wipers, toys and various other rubber goods. Rubber is cultivated as large plantations, in many countries such as Sri Lanka, India, Indonesia, Vietnam, China and Congo Free State in Africa. Rubber seeds were originally considered as a waste product but now they are used to feed livestock (Abdullah and Salimon 2009). Rubber seed contains a relatively higher oil content of 40 – 50  % (Junaid et al. 2014) and the rubber seed oil (RSO) was found to have properties similar to soya bean oil and linseed oil which are widely used in industrial applications. Therefore, RSO has now become an important raw material for many industries; as semidrying oil in the paint industry (Joseph et al. 2004), in soap manufacturing (Ohikhena 2006), as <b>anti-malaria</b> <b>oil</b> in medicines (Thomas et al. 1998) and as a core binder for factice preparation in engineering (Fernando 1971).|$|E
