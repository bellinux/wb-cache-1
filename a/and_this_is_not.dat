5|$|Certain genera of gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus, Clostridium, Sporohalobacter, Anaerobacter, and Heliobacterium, {{can form}} highly resistant, dormant {{structures}} called endospores. In almost all cases, one endospore is formed <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a reproductive process, although Anaerobacter {{can make up}} to seven endospores in a single cell. Endospores have a central core of cytoplasm containing DNA and ribosomes surrounded by a cortex layer and protected by an impermeable and rigid coat. Dipicolinic acid is a chemical compound that composes 5% to 15% of the dry weight of bacterial spores. It is implicated as responsible for the heat resistance of the endospore.|$|E

25|$|If {{the base}} b equals e, then the {{derivative}} is simply 1/x, and at x=1 this derivative equals 1. Another {{sense in which}} the base-e-logarithm is the most natural {{is that it can}} be defined quite easily in terms of a simple integral or Taylor series <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> true of other logarithms.|$|E
25|$|This {{work has}} been avoided in some {{discourse}} on Beuys {{because he has been}} put in artistically sacrosanct position <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> in conformance with Beuys' other work. In choosing to do a piece in the form of popular music, Beuys demonstrated a commitment to his views and the most expansive ways of having them reach people. While it is easy to resist and ridicule Beuys' efforts in the pop arena, it does not change {{the fact that this is}} an important part of his collected works that needs to be acknowledged to better understand his scope, intention and own views of art.|$|E
25|$|Single gene {{mutations}} {{can cause}} Mendelian forms of high blood pressure; ten genes {{have been identified}} which cause these monogenic forms of hypertension. These mutations affect blood pressure by altering renal salt handling. There is greater similarity in blood pressure within families than between families, which indicates a form of inheritance, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> due to shared environmental factors. With the aid of genetic analysis techniques, a statistically significant linkage of blood pressure to several chromosomal regions, including regions linked to familial combined hyperlipidemia, was found. These findings {{suggest that there are}} many genetic loci, in the general population, each with small effects on blood pressure. Overall, however, identifiable single-gene causes of hypertension are uncommon, consistent with a multifactorial cause of essential hypertension.|$|E

These six skipping paths are called diagonals in this article. They are equivalent to the four diagonal directions on a rectangular board. A piece may travel along a diagonal even if the adjacent cells it passes between are occupied, since it doesn't actually pass through these adjacent cells, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> considered a jump, just as on a rectangular board. There are no jumping moves in sannin shogi except for the king when castling.|$|E
25|$|The {{view has}} been taken by {{scholars}} {{that there is no}} practical difference between the reasonable suspicion and real likelihood tests. In a 2008 paper, Lionel Leo and Chen Siyuan concede that there is a slight difference in the meaning of the terms real likelihood and reasonable suspicion, but are of the view that this difference is hardly material. The gap between the two tests is considerably narrow and, in practice, the two tests are unlikely to yield different results in most cases. It was stated in Cook International Inc. v. B.V. Handelmaatschappij Jean Delvaux (1985) that the contrast between the tests was between reasonable suspicion of bias on the one hand, and the appearance of a real likelihood of bias on the other. Hence what must be established is the appearance of a real possibility of bias <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> very different from establishing that a fair-minded member of the public could have a reasonable suspicion that a fair trial for the litigant was not possible.|$|E
500|$|Timbaland contributed three {{tracks to}} Tweet's debut album, Southern Hummingbird, and {{produced}} most of Missy Elliott's {{fourth and fifth}} LPs, Under Construction <b>and</b> <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Not</b> A Test!. He also produced tracks for artists such as Lil' Kim ("The Jump Off") and southern rapper Pastor Troy during this period.

25|$|The initial 1955 {{plans for}} Seaslug called for {{two types of}} ships to carry it, a large cruiser and a {{medium-sized}} destroyer.

500|$|The Welsh Springer Spaniel is a compact, solidly built dog, bred {{for hard}} work and endurance. Their body can give the {{impression}} of length due to its obliquely angled forequarters and developed hindquarters. The build of the Welsh Springer Spaniel should be slightly off square, meaning that the length of the dog should be slightly greater than the height at the withers. However, some dogs may be square, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> penalised in the show ring as long as the height is never greater than the length. [...] Traditionally a docked breed, dependant on legislation in the country of origin, and where allowed the dew claws can be removed.|$|E
500|$|Kemper endeared {{himself to}} his psychiatrists by being a model prisoner, and was trained to {{administer}} psychiatric tests to other inmates. One of his psychiatrists later stated, [...] "He {{was a very good}} worker <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> typical of a sociopath. He really took pride in his work." [...] Kemper also {{became a member of the}} Jaycees while in Atascadero and stated that he developed [...] "some new tests and some new scales on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory," [...] specifically an [...] "Overt Hostility Scale," [...] during his work with Atascadero psychiatrists. After his second arrest, Kemper stated that being able to understand how these tests functioned allowed him to manipulate his psychiatrists, and admitted that he learned a lot from the sex offenders to whom he administered tests; for example, they told him it was best to kill a woman after raping her to avoid leaving witnesses.|$|E
500|$|However, many {{important}} differences {{exist between the}} two men. Joel Coen said: [...] "Both writers wrote {{the same kind of}} plays with proletarian heroes, but their personalities were quite different. Odets was much more of an extrovert; in fact he was quite sociable even in Hollywood, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the case with Barton Fink!" [...] Although he was frustrated by his declining popularity in New York, Odets was successful during his time in Hollywood. Several of his later plays were adapted– [...] by him and others– [...] into movies. One of these, The Big Knife (1955), matches Barton's life much more than Odets'. In it, an actor becomes overwhelmed by the greed of a movie studio which hires him and eventually commits suicide. Another similarity to Odets' work is Audrey's death, which mirrors a scene in Deadline at Dawn (1946), a film noir written by Odets. In that film, a character awakens to find that the woman he bedded the night before has been inexplicably murdered.|$|E
25|$|In May 1682, Charles II fell ill, and Shaftesbury {{convened a}} group {{including}} Monmouth, Russell, Ford Grey, 3rd Baron Grey of Werke, and Sir Thomas Armstrong {{to determine what}} to do if the king died. They determined they would launch a rebellion demanding a parliament to settle the succession. The king recovered, however, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> necessary.|$|R
30|$|Livestock herds were {{structured}} to provide milk, replacement stock and income insurance. Goats {{were the main}} pillar of subsistence. The exit factors in the herd dynamics prevailed over the entry factors, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> favourable for herd re-building and maintenance. The Government should therefore intervene to smoothen livestock cycles and {{keep track of the}} dynamics.|$|R
50|$|Finally, {{the team}} {{noticed that the}} system would often create false echoes during heavy rainstorms, and the {{potential}} for using this as a weather system was immediately seen. However, they were sure that shorter wavelengths like those in the X band being experimented with would have a greater interaction, <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> considered further at the time.|$|R
500|$|In 2008, MTV2 {{ranked the}} music video as {{number one on}} their list [...] "Greatest Music Videos Ever". In 2011, [...] "All Is Full of Love" [...] was placed at number 14 in MusicRadar's list of the 30 best music videos of all time, and was placed in Times list of The 30 All-TIME Best Music Videos. The video was also listed as the fifth-greatest of all time by NME, and the ninth top music video of the decade by Pitchfork Media. In addition, [...] "All Is Full of Love" [...] has been {{included}} in various art exhibitions and museums, including DEAF04 Exhibition in the V2_Institute for the Unstable Media in Rotterdam, Chris Cunningham in MoMA PS1 in New York City, the 49th Venice Biennale, While Interwoven Echoes Drip into a Hybrid Body– an Exhibition about Sound, Performance and Sculpture in the Migros Museum für Gegenwartskunst in Zürich, <b>and</b> <b>This</b> <b>Is</b> <b>Not</b> a Love Song in La Virreina Centre de la Imatge in Barcelona.

500|$|Usher and Minaj {{shot the}} music video on March 9, 2010 in Los Angeles with {{director}} Taj Stansberry, represented by Leah Harmony and Ciarra Pardo. In {{an interview with}} Vibe, Stansberry commented on the video's sex appeal and the pairing of Usher and Minaj, stating, [...] "This probably {{has the potential to}} be [...] Usher’s one of the best entertainers in the world, then you have Nicki Minaj who’s fresh on the scene. Put them together and there’s just sparks, it was real good." [...] When asked about the music video's concept would redefine the word [...] "freak", commenting: [...] "My general idea was to take the word and show its many faceted sides, twisting and turning it to where there’s really no distinguishing between one freak and another. Usher went there. When you’re engaging in sexual activity, there are many transitions <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> about what they look like literally, but what they look like metaphorically. It’s about luring people into a situation. Because you have your thoughts on a ménage à trois, but then we’re doing it in a non-obvious way." [...] On Minaj and her pairing with Usher, Stansberry said, [...] " [...] had a few looks that I really liked. She played the part, but still was her. If you really listen to her words in the song, you can kinda visualize her outfit." [...] Stansberry also confirmed that R singer Ciara and singer-actor Jamie Foxx would make appearances in the video. In an interview with MTV News on the set of her video for [...] "Massive Attack", Minaj said that [...] "The video is freaky. And it's a great concept, a great story line," [...] Minaj told MTV News. [...] "It felt just like one of the sequels to Saw. It was dope." [...] Stating that the video had a [...] "secret society" [...] concept, Usher told Access Hollywood that the place symbolized locations where people use to get away from pressures, and also said the movie Eyes Wide Shut was some sort of inspiration of the video. On March 22, 2010 a thirty second preview of the music video was surfaced onto the internet. Two days later on March 24, 2010, Usher premiered the full music video on BET's 106 & Park.|$|E

50|$|Even {{if there}} was no need for the first {{defendant}} to have been placed in mora, the appeal nevertheless had to succeed, Nestadt JA determined, because the contract <b>was</b> <b>not</b> validly cancelled for other reasons.

They therefore suffered from substantially the same defects as the demand for payment.|$|R
30|$|Another {{inherent}} bias {{that must be}} considered when reading our findings {{is the fact that}} pinning in situ was used across the whole severity spectrum of SCFE <b>and</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> the case with Ganz surgical dislocation.
