50|$|Although Kodachrome {{is often}} {{considered}} a superior film {{due to its}} <b>archival</b> <b>qualities</b> and color palette, advances in dye and coupler technology blurred the boundaries between the differing processes, along with Kodak having abandoned Kodachrome research and development since the mid-1990s. Furthermore, the developing of Kodachrome always required a complex, fickle process requiring an on-site analytical lab and typically required a turnaround of several days to allow for shipping times. By contrast, small professional labs {{have been able to}} process Ektachrome on-site since the 1950s, with product safety and effluent discharge having been drastically improved since the 1970s, when Kodak reformulated their entire color chemistry lineup. It is even possible for amateur labs to process Ektachrome within an hour using a rotary tube processor (made by Jobo, WingLynch or PhotoTherm), sink-line, or even by hand inversion in a small drum and E-2, E-4, and E-6 processing chemistry kits were sold for home darkrooms.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{developing}} solutions {{can be used}} to give {{a different}} image color (brown, sepia, blue, maroon and black). Kallitype images generally have a richer tonal range than the cyanotype. These prints were popular in the 19th century, and then their popularity faded away. Sometimes known as [...] "the poor man's platinum print", when the image is toned in platinum or palladium the result is nearly chemically identical to a true Platinotype. It is believed that many Kallitypes were passed off as true Platinotypes and remain in collections as so. Kallitypes have had a reputation over the years as having poor <b>archival</b> <b>qualities</b> and often fading. When properly cleared, Kallitypes are completely archivable and will not fade. Toning with a metal such as gold, platinum, or palladium will give extra image permanence. Ferrous ions embedded in the paper as a result of poor clearing is the cause of the lack of belief in image permanence. This can be easily identified by a yellow stain in the highlights.|$|R

During that time, Maori have revitalised their culture resulting in a new generation who incorporate ritual practices, tikanga Maori into their everyday, increasingly urbanised lives. Engaging with restoring mana (integrity) to the photograph, this project focuses on urban Maori and non-Maori community and utilises whakawhanaungatanga, a Maori way of identifying common bonds, established through Maori language educational networks. This paper questions how the strategy of incorporating tikanga Maori in terms of composition of family members, titles and placement within the image can contribute to a wider body of knowledge that adds to the value of photography in indigenous cultures, thereby contributing to this provisional local urban community. Early depiction of Maori and other indigenous peoples by ethnographers, expedition and commercial photographers has frequently raised questions of intention. “Tsinhnahjinnie has asserted {{it is the responsibility of}} indigenous people to create and interpret their own images activating a photographic sovereignty (1998, 2003). ” Therefore, this project also tests the role of the photographer as an insider researcher, with the intention of creating new and valued photo albums depicting images of this community and reflects on the importance of Maori values today...|$|R
40|$|Whilst {{the primary}} focus for the {{creation}} and preservation of digitally based artwork in hardcopy has relied in recent years on the gradual refinement of digital printing devices, reference points for their development often appear to follow a strictly linear route. To broaden the current possibilities for permanent, accurate digital hardcopy, Thirkell and the Centre for Fine Print Research has been engaged in the re-assessment of some early photomechanical printing processes which were eclipsed by the mainstream printing approaches long {{before the advent of}} the digital era. Thirkell's paper drew on a three-part methodology surveying printing techniques through historical and current literature, examining actual printed examples and testing findings through practice. The paper re-evaluated the high resolution and <b>archival</b> <b>qualities</b> of three unique 19 th century printing processes in the context of current digital practice. Although in mainstream terms such techniques have become redundant, this re-assessment identified and demonstrated valuable principles such as lightfast ink qualities and continuous tone image rendering which has once again renewed currency in the rapidly expanding field of museum quality digital imaging and printing. As a result of this research a small AHRC grant was awarded to create The Woodburytype Database ISBN- 10 - 0. 9547025. 3. 0 ISBN- 13 - 978. 0. 9547025. 3. 3. A web-based database of all articles in English relating to the process and production of the Woodburytype. UWE is only one of three centres in the world who have tried to recreate this process. This process died out in the early C 20 th but as the only truly continuous tone printing process ever invented has been accepted internationally by companies such as Hewlett Packard, Ricoh and Kodak as a benchmark against which current digital output can be viewed...|$|R

As added protection acid formation, paper-based storage materials may have a buffer, such as calcium carbonate, which can neutralize acids as they form in the storage materials. Boxes should not be overfilled. Items may be interleaved with acid/lignin-free paper. If boxes are only partially full, spacers may be used, or the box may be stored horizontally. Large format material is best stored in a plan cabinet with shallow drawers. The rolling of large items (e.g. maps) should be avoided where possible; {{but if there is}} no other option, the item should be rolled around a large diameter <b>archival</b> <b>quality</b> tube.

5000|$|Control of {{relative}} humidity and temperature {{is critical in}} the preservation of photographs. [...] "Heat can accelerate deterioration and high relative humidity provides the moisture necessary to promote harmful chemical reactions in materials and, with high temperature encourages mold growth and insect activity" [...] according to the Northeast Document Conservation Center. Proper storage can protect photographs from fluctuations in relative humidity and temperature and/or seasonal changes. Photographic prints and negatives are best stored in individual paper or plastic enclosures. Note that paper enclosures must pass the PAT test or Photographic Activity Test {{in order to be}} deemed safe for storage of photographic materials. Once the photographs are in their individual enclosures they must be boxed in <b>archival</b> <b>quality</b> boxes. Horizontal storage is usually recommended over vertical storage, as is storing photographs of similar size together to avoid abrasions or misplacing the smaller items. Negatives, which includes black and white or color negatives, slides, lantern slides, collodion wet and dry plate negatives, and silver gelatin wet and dry plate negatives should be stored upright and vertically along their longest edge. Padded boxes with dividers are often necessary as you do not want two glass plate negatives to touch each other. When packing the <b>archival</b> <b>quality</b> boxes, make sure to not pack them too heavy and label them accordingly. Scrapbooks and albums provide a particular challenge to conservators because they often contain a variety of components and media. They should not be stored with other archival collections if it can be avoided. Scrapbooks can either be digitally reproduced or if the original is deemed important enough, can be wrapped in <b>archival</b> <b>quality</b> paper or housed in a custom fitted box.|$|E

40|$|A DISSERTATION PRESENTED TO THE HIGHER DEGREES COMMITTEE OF PENINSULA TECHNIKON IN PARTIAL FULFILLMENT OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MASTER OF TECHNOLOGY: GRAPHIC DESIGN, 2004 Inkjet {{printers}} {{have evolved}} {{in recent years}} to the extent that many are capable of making prints of a quality closely approximating traditional colour photographs. These printers cost a fraction of the capital outlay needed to equip a traditional colour darkroom and have brought high quality colour printing within the reach of a broad spectrum of users. As they are capable of printing {{on a wide range of}} materials and print surfaces prints from inkjet printers are also in demand by fine artists and art collectors. Commercial printmakers, artists, photographers, and amateurs printing in their homes or offices use these printers. The convenience, ease, and quality of inkjet printing have made it a popular additional and alternative photographic printing technique. However, manufacturers seldom publish data regarding the expected life of the printer output. With traditional colour photographs end users expect some fading to take place with time and can normally have another print made from the original negative. Digital images rely on storage on compact disk or computer hard drive with potential long-term retrieval problems, and it is vital that important images be output in print form on the most stable materials. This study arose from the author’s concern about the <b>archival</b> <b>qualities</b> of photographs in general. In order to enable end users to make more informed choices about the most suitable printing medium, this study explored two aspects concerning traditional photographs and inkjet prints, namely cost and image permanence. The comparative costs were found by means of a questionnaire survey conducted among a representative sample of printmakers. The limits of image permanence were determined by subjecting sample prints to a high-intensity light source to accelerate the process of image fading over time to the point where the print becomes unacceptable. The investigation showed that inkjet prints are more expensive than traditional photographs, and that inkjet prints made with pigment inks can last twice as long as traditional photographs. Different inkjet papers were found to have no significant effect on the life of the print during the period of this test. Inkjet prints made with dyes were shown to have a short life before fading unacceptably. The study led to the recommendation that for the longest print life a print to be displayed should be printed on an inkjet paper with pigment inks...|$|R
