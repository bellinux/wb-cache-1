5|$|I {{realized}} {{that for a}} long time I had been holding onto this whole dogma of nonracism <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> religion... But in the course of that debate I began to feel there was a lot lacking in the proponents of the nonracist idea... they had this problem, you know, of superiority, and they tended to take us for granted and wanted us to accept things that were second-class. They could not see why we could not consider staying in that church, and I began to feel that our understanding of our own situation in this country was not coincidental with that of these liberal whites.|$|E
5|$|I {{wanted it}} to be <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> photo album, so every single scene is kind of like a picture that you're kind of looking into our relationship. So it is a 1920s vibe, it's black and white, very high fashion—you know, you'll see me very dapper in 1920s, Frank Sinatra-ish. So you'll see the cars from that era, you'll {{definitely}} feel the vibe of the house having that 1920s vibe as well. So it's very different and very intimate, and it's not a lot of dancing—it's more personal.|$|E

5|$|Basingstoke's {{expansion}} has absorbed much surrounding farmland {{and scattered}} housing, transforming it into housing estates or local districts. Many {{of these new}} estates are designed as almost self-contained communities, such as Lychpit, Chineham, Popley, Winklebury, Oakridge, Kempshott, Brighton Hill, Viables, South Ham, Black Dam, Buckskin and Hatch Warren. The M3 acts as a buffer zone {{to the south of}} the town, and the South Western Main Line constrains the western expansion, with a green belt to the north and north-east, making Basingstoke shaped <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> kite. As a result, the villages of Cliddesden, Dummer, Sherborne St John and Oakley, although being very close to the town limits, are considered distinct entities. Popley, Hatch Warren and Beggarwood are seeing rapid growth in housing.|$|E
25|$|Those who do disrupt {{and discuss}} it {{describe}} the experience as, unsurprisingly, extremely painful, <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{death in the}} family, and shameful but ultimately worth it for both the parent and the child. This resolution, however, usually cannot be reached without undergoing extensive counseling and therapy.|$|E
25|$|During {{the postwar}} years, the Air National Guard was <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> flying country club and a pilot could often {{show up at}} the field, check out an {{aircraft}} and go flying. However, these units also had regular military exercises that kept up proficiency and in gunnery and bombing contests they would often score better than full-time USAF units.|$|E

25|$|The vihuela, as it {{was known}} in Spanish, was called the viola de mà in Catalan, viola da mano in Italian and viola de mão in Portuguese. The two names are {{functionally}} synonymous and interchangeable. In its most developed form, the vihuela was a guitar-shaped instrument with six double-strings (paired courses) made of gut. Vihuelas were tuned identically to their contemporary Renaissance lute; 4ths and mid-3rd (44344, <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> modern guitar tuning, {{with the exception of}} the third string, which was tuned a semitone lower).|$|E
25|$|Adult red-crowned cranes {{are named}} for a patch of red bare skin on the crown, which becomes {{brighter}} during mating season. Overall, they are snow white in color with black on the wing secondaries, which can appear <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> black tail when the birds are standing, but the real tail feathers are actually white. Males are black on the cheeks, throat, and neck, while females are pearly gray in these spots. The bill is olive green to greenish horn, the legs are slate to grayish black, and the iris is dark brown.|$|E
25|$|The most {{well known}} {{landmark}} of Östersund {{is the national}} romantic city hall. It is 51 meters tall and contains 136 rooms. It is the greatest constructional symbol of the National Romantic architecture in Östersund. The city hall looks <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> fortress and affiliates especially to the local art of Jämtland. The bell tower is of typical Jamtish design shaped like an onion, the local sculpture Olof Ahlberg made most of the sculpture details and the ornaments are made from Jamtish limestone. Frans Bertil Wallberg's city hall was seen by contemporary colleagues as the best of modern Swedish architecture. The {{main part of the}} building is accentuated by a grand tower and a monumental stairway. It is accompanied by only one wing, the north wing, as the second, south wing, was torn down in the 1970s.|$|E

25|$|Much of {{this was}} shown in the temple reports which were carved in stone when the {{governing}} body (called the epistatai) of the temple changed hands. In the stone IG I3 386-387 {{it can be seen}} how the finances of the Eleusinian temples worked. Doctor Maureen B. Cavanaugh who translated stone IG I3 386-387, argues that there were heavy implications of the funding realized from the First Fruits donations to the temple, in particular that it brought significant impact on Athenian power. This is noted in a loan cited in the stone record, of over 20,000 silver drachmas to the city. The Eleusinian temple complex {{was more than just a}} temple to Demeter; there were living quarters, storage, workshops, administration as well as public spaces. It was a major institution, functioning <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> city within a city.|$|E
25|$|The action {{takes place}} in Jerome's very untidy and {{neglected}} flat. Before the play begins, Jerome has arranged a meeting with wife Corinna and Mervyn Bickerdyke from the Department of Child Wellbeing, {{to convince them that}} it will be appropriate for Geain to stay with him for long visits. Geain is also due to come to the meeting. To help to convince them, Jerome plans to hire an actress, Zoe Mill, from an escort agency, to pose as his fiancée. The first act takes place one week before the meeting as he interviews Zoe for the job. Before she arrives, Jerome activates his NAN 300F – a female android (or gynoid) whom he calls Nan. He treats Nan, who was originally designed to look after children, <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> pet. Much of the play's humour originates from her idiosyncrasies as she collides with the furniture, blurts out unexpected remarks, and performs her tasks incompetently – such as serving a drink with the tumbler upside down.|$|E
25|$|His {{early career}} at the Opéra was quite turbulent. The {{institution}} {{at the time was}} seething with discontent: the artistes resented the fact their wages were only a third of those of the actors of the Comédie-Française and the Comédie-Italienne; moreover, their pay was only partly fixed and permanent, the rest being linked to how frequently they appeared on stage and the size of their roles. The rebellious Lays soon became embroiled in a heated confrontation with the management, behaving <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> modern union agitator, with the support of two singers who had joined the company around the same time, the haute-contre J. Rousseau (1761–1800) and the bass Auguste-Athanase Chéron (1760–1829). In June 1781, fire destroyed the second hall of the Palais Royal, the home of the theatre, causing performances to be suspended. This left the singers with only their meagre basic salaries, so the three decided to remedy the situation by accepting engagements elsewhere, even though they were prohibited by law from doing so as salaried artistes of the Académie Royale de Musique. Rousseau alone managed to travel to Brussels surreptitiously and appear at the Théâtre de la Monnaie, then the second most important French-speaking theatre in the world. Lays, however, was arrested on the evening of 20 August 1781, the day before he was due to set off, and spent ten days in prison. He was provisionally released on the 30th because he was indispensable for filling the haute-contre role of Cynire in a revival of Gluck's Echo et Narcisse in the small hall of the Menus-Plaisirs which acted as a substitute for the theatre which had burned down. His enormous popularity with the public, with an encore of the main aria and several curtain-calls, made it practically impossible to send him back to prison, although he was forced to sign a solemn undertaking that he would not leave Paris without the express permission of his superiors.|$|E

500|$|His final {{released}} {{movie was}} the Cult Indy Film, Night of the Templar, directed {{by his friend}} Paul Sampson, in which David wielded a sword (katana) for the final time on screen. <b>Almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> foreshadowing, there are several peculiar and eerie references in the film that are coincidental to Mr. Carradine's untimely passing which include cross dressing and auto erotic asphyxiation. His last scene on screen ended in the following dialog: [...] "Well, old friend, {{see you in the}} next lifetime" [...] / [...] "Yeah, Old Friends, Old Soul Mates" [...] / [...] "Yes, we are." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{perceived}} {{inability to}} connect {{has led to}} much speculation about Drake's sexuality. Boyd has said he detects a virginal quality in his lyrics and music, and notes that he never observed or heard of the singer behaving in a sexual way with anyone, male or female. Kirby described Drake's lyrics as a [...] "series of extremely vivid, complete observations, <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> series of epigrammatic proverbs", though he doubts that Drake saw himself as [...] "any sort of poet". Instead, Kirby believes that Drake's lyrics were crafted to [...] "complement and compound a mood that the melody dictates in the first place." ...|$|E

500|$|Raleigh's {{commanding}} officer. On selecting Elba, del Toro stated: [...] "This is a {{movie where}} I have {{had to deal with}} more dialogue than ever, and the way I cast the movie was—who do I want to hear say these things? Who do I want Charlie Hunnam to go against? Who can really tell Charlie Hunnam 'sit down and listen'?" [...] In another interview, the director said: [...] "I wanted to have Idris not be the blonde, square-jawed, Anglo, super hip marine that knows [...] I wanted somebody that could bring a lot of authority, but that you could feel {{the weight of the world}} on his shoulders. When I watched Luther, that's the essence of the character… Luther is carrying literally the evils of the world on his shoulders. He's doing penance for all humanity… Idris is one of those actors that is capable of embodying humanity, in <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Rodin sculpture-type, larger than life, <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Russian realism statue, you know, big hands, all the turmoil of humanity in his eyes. I wanted somebody that you could have doubts internally, and very few guys can do that." [...] To prepare for the role, Elba watched footage of politicians David Cameron and Barack Obama, as well as Russell Crowe in Gladiator and Mel Gibson in Braveheart. Del Toro initially offered the role to Tom Cruise, who declined because of scheduling conflicts.|$|E

(1994) {{and added}} that the film dealt with themes of family and moral values through a [...] "spectacular stage that moves across global locations". She further stated that the buildup to the story was juxtaposed with the backdrop of two contrasting places– the Raichand home and the interiors of Chandni Chowk. While the Raichand house is described as [...] "expensive, <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> museum", Chandni Chowk is shown as a world of crowds, chaos and festivities. She also made a note {{of the use of}} frontal camera angles {{in order to ensure that}} the [...] "spectators eye travels throughout the interior expanse".|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{securing}} a record deal, Pru had found inspiration for her music in {{artists such as}} Cassandra Wilson and Dianne Reeves. She wrote song lyrics and poetry while attending high school and then Texas Southern University, coupling her lyrics with the music of other artists such as Michael Jackson, Rachelle Ferrell, Sade, Naughty by Nature, the Isley Brothers, and Miles Davis. While discussing her approach to songwriting, Pru elaborated: [...] "From a word, I can get a whole picture, a visual. The song becomes a poem, <b>almost</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> thesis." [...] She considered her music {{as a form of}} poetry, citing the album track [...] "Hazy Shades" [...] {{as an example of a}} poem turned into a song.|$|E
