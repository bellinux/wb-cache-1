5000|$|In {{a notable}} {{incident}} since {{the signing of}} the Ceasefire Agreement in 2001, the crew of a Jordanian ship, MV Farah III that ran aground near rebel-controlled territory off the island's coast, accused the Tamil Tigers of forcing them to abandon the vessel which was carrying 14,000 tonnes of Indian rice and risking their lives. The crew said that LTTE fired four times to force them out of the vessel after failing to explode it in choppy seas three days after. The skipper of the vessel said; [...] "First they tried to set up a bomb and explode the anchor cable and when it failed they ordered us to weigh anchor" [...] He also said that the Tigers dismantled and removed <b>all</b> radio <b>communication</b> <b>equipment</b> and radar from the vessel. On May 1, 2007 Sayed Sulaiman, the chairman of the ship's owners, Salam International Trading Company gave an interview to the BBC Tamil service, saying, [...] "We hear from the parties who are concerned with the ship, the insurance company etc., that ... everything that could be taken - like the rice, lights, generators - has been taken from the ship. The ship is now bare." ...|$|R
50|$|At 17:00 hours <b>all</b> <b>communication</b> <b>equipment</b> was destroyed. The {{survivors}} {{carried out}} their evacuation orders and destroyed all abandoned weapons and withdrew {{further to the}} north wall. Leading the evacuation effort were fifteen H-34 helicopters from HMM-163 supported by four UH-1B gunships. Panic-stricken Vietnamese mobbed the evacuation helicopters and overwhelmed U.S. Special Forces troops as they abandoned the camp. This {{reached a point where}} the helicopters were so overloaded some SF soldiers were forced to fire upon the Vietnamese soldiers to allow the helicopters to take off. Only 172 of 368 Nung and Vietnamese irregulars were flown out. The others were listed as MIA, although many of these turned up later. The evacuation was further complicated by heavy enemy anti-aircraft fire, and two H-34s were lost.|$|E
40|$|Todays modern warfare puts high {{demands on}} {{military}} equipment. Where soldiers are concerned, types of <b>communication</b> <b>equipment</b> such as radios, displays and headsets {{play a central}} role. A modern soldier is often required to maintain communication links with other military units. These units can, for example, consist of platoon commanders, headquarters and other soldiers. If the soldier needs {{to make a report}} to several units, the message needs to be sent to several radio networks that are connected to these separate units. This multiplicity in turn requires several items of radio equipment connected to the radio network frequencies. Considering <b>all</b> the <b>communication</b> <b>equipment</b> that is used by a modern soldier, the parallel data flow and all the weight a soldier needs to carry, can get quite extensive.   Saab AB it has been proven that a combination of powerful embedded hardware platforms and cross platform software fulfills the communication needs. However, the weight issue still remains as these embedded platforms are quite bulky and hard to carry. In order to increase the portability, a tailored Android application for smaller low-power embedded hardware platform has been developed at Saab AB. Saab AB has also developed a portable analogue interconnection unit for connecting three radios and a headset, the SKE (Sammankopplingsenhet). AB intends to develop a new product for soldiers, the RPCS (Rugged Portable Communication System), with capacities of running the Android application and combining the audio processing functionality of the SKE. This thesis focuses on developing a hardware platform prototype for the RPCS using Beagleboard. The SKE audio processing functionality is developed as a software application running on the Beagleboard...|$|R
50|$|On 11 February 1896, the Municipal Commissioners of Darjeeling {{decided to}} set up a {{hydroelectric}} power station for the purpose of lighting the town. A loan of 1 lakh (100,000) was secured from the government, and a site for the power station was selected {{at the foot of the}} Arya Tea Estate at Sidrapong. The site was then a fine orchard of the Maharajah of Burdwan, who was pleased to hand it over to the municipality for the importance of the public interest. The work for the installation of a power station started immediately, with machines and equipment imported from Britain.

40|$|Abstract. To {{improve the}} {{objectivity}} {{and accuracy of}} evaluation for electromagnetic environment complexity and its influence on <b>communication</b> <b>equipment,</b> a subjective complexity evaluation method of electromagnetic environment oriented to the <b>communication</b> <b>equipment</b> is presented based on sensitivity and RF protection ratio of <b>communication</b> <b>equipment.</b> Based on statistical concept, the energy correlation factor is modified, and modulation and polarization correlation concept are imported into this method, by which the factor of energy correlation is modified and the subjective evaluation is made by analyzing the time domain correlation, frequency domain correlation, energy domain correlation, modulation correlation and polarization correlation of the electromagnetic environment. These simulation results indicate that <b>communication</b> <b>equipment</b> with various working parameters are influenced differently under the same electromagnetic environment.
