40|$|An {{unfavourable}} {{effect of}} flying is the enhanced exposure of both passengers and aircrew to cosmic radiation at high altitudes. On {{the basis of}} a detailed survey on passengers arriving at or departing from Amsterdam Schiphol Airport in the 1988 - 1997 period, estimates of individual effective dose for specific destinations and the collective dose for all passengers travelling through Amsterdam Schiphol Airport in the Netherlands were calculated. Most of the flights were regional European flights, resulting in individual effective doses of 1 - 15 mu Sv. Individual effective doses from intercontinental flights to North America and the Far East were mostly found in the range of 30 - 60 mu Sv per flight. These values may vary up to about 15 % due to the solar cycle. The individual effective dose on a one-way flight averaged over all flights was approximately 18 mu Sv. A group consisting of 4000 frequent flyers may receive doses above 1 mSv a- 1, while within the special group of couriers individual effective doses of 10 mSv a- 1 are possible. For aircrews, a dose range of 1. 5 - 5. 7 mSv a- 1 was determined for 1000 block hours of flying.

We have measured terrestrial gamma radiation dose-rates (TGRD) from surface soils throughout accessible areas in the Peninsular Malaysia state of Negeri Sembilan (NS). Dose rate measurements were carried out using a Nal (TI) scintillation survey meter, encompassing 1708 locations, covering about 73 % of the 6645 km 2 of the land area in NS. This has allowed development of a TGRD contour map, plotted using WinSurf software. The range of measured TGRD was from 71 +/- 3 nGy/h up to 1000 +/- 11 nGy/h. The greatest measured TGRD was obtained in an area covered by soil types originating from igneous rock of granitic formations, while the least value of TGRD was observed in an area covered by limestone composed of calcite mineral, mostly found near river and coastal areas. Mean values of TGRD across the seven districts of NS ranged from 244 +/- 7 nGy/h to 458 +/- 13 nGy/h, the global mean being 330 +/- 8 nGy/h compared to a mean value of 92 nGy/h and 59 nGy/h for Malaysia and the world, respectively.

40|$|A major {{field study}} was {{conducted}} in Boise, Idaho, during the heating season of 1986 to 1987 as part of the Integrated Air Cancer Project. Filter samples were systematically collected in residences and in the ambient air across the community to characterize the particle-bound pollutants. The extractable organic matter (EOM) from the filter samples was apportioned to its source of origin, either residential wood combustion (RWC) or mobile sources (MS). Two composite samples, with apportioned contributions from RWC and MS, were prepared from the Boise ambient samples and tested for tumor-initiation potency. A comparative potency lung cancer risk estimate has been made based on the two ambient composite samples from this airshed. In addition, a microenvironmental exposure model was developed from the Boise data and from national survey data to estimate the exposure to EOM from RWC and MS. In this paper, the microenvironmental model is extrapolated to provide an estimate of the average annual exposure and dose in Boise to EOM from RWC and MS. The annual model considers actual pollutant levels in Boise, historical changes in RWC usage and meteorological dilution factors and the likely activities in the various microenvironmental zones and their resultant inhalation rates.

During the period from 1998 to 2005, the average annual individual doses of the personnel of Group A gradually decreased from 2. 9 mSv to 1. 4 mSv and then stabilized at a level of 1. 2 – 1. 4 mSv. The average per inhabitant of the Russian Federation annual effective dose due to natural sources, according to data for 1998 - 2016, is 3. 33 mSv/year, for the Altai Republic – 8. 97 mSv/ year, and for some of the most exposed population groups – 3 - 60 and more mSv/year. Radon exposure makes up the largest fraction (59. 50 %) of radiation dose due to natural sources. The average per inhabitant of the Russian Federation annual effective dose due to medical exposure in 2016 was 0. 51 mSv/year, and after some stabilization in 2013 - 2015 at a level of 0. 45 - 0. 48 mSv/year, there was a tendency to increase. The average annual effective dose of the Russian Federation citizens from all sources of ionizing radiation is 3. 76 mSv/year.

In accordance with this Directive, in the Leningrad region 29 settlements were classified as zones of radioactive contamination. This article describes the dynamics of changes in the radiation situation and its current state in the territories of the Leningrad Region affected by the Chernobyl accident. The paper presents the dynamics of 137 Cs and 90 Sr contents in food products of local origin, the results of calculations of the current average annual effective doses used for the purposes of settlements’ zoning, and the average annual effective radiation doses actually received by the population, dating back to 1986. According to the results of laboratory studies, since 1987, there have been no exceedances of the permissible levels for 137 Cs s in agricultural products and food raw materials of local origin. However in the wild products (mushrooms) excesses of the permissible levels for 137 Cs have been periodically detected. The cases of exceeding the permissible levels for the content of strontium- 90 in food, drinking water and water from open water bodies were not recorded for the entire observation period; the determined activity was at the level of tens and hundreds of times less than the permissible levels.

The results from the survey have been analysed in order to estimate the ecological half-time, T eco,eff, of fallout radiocaesium and the aggregate transfer from ground deposition to man in the region. After 1987, the biological half-times, T e, of 137 Cs and 40 K in man were also determined in the reference group through whole-body content measurements in combination with 24 -hour urine sampling. Relationships between 24 -hour urinary excretion and body burden of 137 Cs in the group together with data from the literature were then applied to urine samples collected in 1994 and 1995 from adult subjects living in the highly contaminated region of Bryansk, Russia, in order to estimate their average body burden of 137 Cs. The equivalent biological half-time for 137 Cs in females of the Lund reference group was, on average (± 1 WSE), 66 ± 3 d, which agrees with other findings, whereas the value for the males, 81 ± 4 d, was, on average, significantly lower than what is found in the literature. This is partly explained by the elevated mean age and relatively low mean body muscle mass of the males investigated in the group during the post-Chernobyl study period. The effective ecological half-time for 137 Cs from Chernobyl was found to be 1. 8 ± 0. 2 y. The aggregate transfer of 137 Cs from deposition to mean activity concentration in man was estimated to be 1. 7 Bq kg - 1 /kBq m - 2. These values may be compared with an effective ecological half-time of 1. 3 years found in the reference group in the 1960 s, and an aggregate transfer factor of 9. 8 Bq kg - 1 /kBq m - 2. The average committed effective dose from ingested 137 Cs Chernobyl fallout in the study group was estimated to be 0. 02 mSv and from the nuclear weapons fallout to 0. 20 mSv. The estimates of whole-body content of 137 Cs in the Russian subjects obtained through creatinine normalisation of the 137 Cs content in urine were, on average, a factor of 2 higher than estimates obtained through a potassium normalisation procedure; 55 ± 8 (1 SE) kBq for creatinine and 29 ± 4 (1 SE) kBq for potassium normalisation in the year 1994. This was due to {{a significant difference in the}} relationship between the urinary potassium and creatinine concentration between the Swedish and Russian group. The elevated potassium concentration found in the rural Russian subjects indicated a higher dietary intake of potassium, which greatly influences the accuracy and applicability of the potassium normalisation method when estimating body burden of 137 Cs through urine assay. It is therefore recommended not to use the potassium normalisation procedure in cases where the daily intake of potassium is unknown. The estimated body burden of 137 Cs in the Bryansk group in 1994 corresponds to a contribution to the estimated annual effective dose of 1. 8 mSv y - 1, which is approximately 200 times greater than the <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> <b>dose</b> received from ingested 137 Cs by the subjects of the Lund reference group during the period 1987 - 1994...|$|E

This {{study was conducted to}} determine the levels of 222 Rn and 226 Ra in private well water in the state of Kelantan. A total of 25 samples of well water were collected from various districts in the state. The levels of 222 Rn and 226 Ra dissolved in well water were measured using the liquid scintillation counting technique. 222 Rn activity concentrations were found within the range of 0. 0491 to 4. 3127 Bq/l for both unfiltered and filtered samples. Meanwhile, activity concentration of 226 Ra measured is between 0. 0278 to 1. 9670 Bq/l for both unfiltered and filtered samples, exceeding the MCL value.

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed {{to examine the}} {{association}} between the effective radiation dose of diagnostic radiation workers in Korea and their risk for cancer. A total of 36, 394 diagnostic radiation workers (159, 189 person-years) were included in this study; the effective dose and cancer incidence were analyzed between the period 1996 and 2002. Median (range) follow-up time was 5. 5 (0. 04 &# 8211; 7) years in males and 3. 75 (0. 04 &# 8211; 7) years in females. Cancer risk related to the <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> effective <b>dose</b> and exposure to more than 5 mSv of <b>annual</b> radiation <b>dose</b> were calculated by the Cox proportional hazard model adjusted for occupation and age at the last follow-up. The standardized incidence ratio of cancer in radiation workers showed strong healthy worker effects in {{both male and female}} workers. The relative risk of all cancers from exposure of the <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> effective <b>dose</b> in the highest quartile (upper 75 % or more of radiation dose) was 2. 14 in male workers (95 % CI: 1. 48 &# 8211; 3. 10, p-trend: &lt; 0. 0001) and 4. 43 in female workers (95 % CI: 2. 17 &# 8211; 9. 04, p-trend: &lt; 0. 0001), compared to those in the lower three quartiles of radiation exposure dose (less than upper 75 % of radiation dose). Cancer risks of the brain (HR: 17. 38, 95 % CI: 1. 05 &# 8211; 287. 8, p-trend: 0. 04) and thyroid (HR: 3. 88, 95 % CI: 1. 09 &# 8211; 13. 75, p-trend: 0. 01) in female workers were significantly higher in the highest quartile group of radiation exposure compared to those in the lower three quartiles, and the risk of colon and rectum cancers in male workers showed a significantly increasing trend according to the increase of the <b>average</b> <b>annual</b> radiation <b>dose</b> (HR: 2. 37, 95 % CI: 0. 99 &# 8211; 5. 67, p-trend: 0. 02).
