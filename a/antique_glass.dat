40|$|The metal beaker {{that was}} found in the house is a unique object. The shape arouses {{associations}} with late <b>antique</b> <b>glasses.</b> The beaker is covered with embossed gold bands with figure representations carried out in early Style I. The bands were probably produced around 500 AD. The body of the beaker might be contemporaneous or possibly also older, with the bands as a later addition. The beaker is connected to drinking vessels, usually horns or glasses decorated with similar bands. Various elements in the decoration of the bands also correspond closely to gold bracteates and relief brooches originating in South Scandinavia, first and foremost Zealand and Scania. It is thus probable that the beaker was manufactured in South Scandinavia, perhaps in a workshop in Uppåkra. Style I is thought by several scholars to have been developed in South Scandinavia. With the discovery of the South Scandinavian central places during the last few decades, we now have the context where the style emerged...|$|R

The hardstone carvings among his collections, which rivaled numismatics for their interest to antiquarians, were engraved and entrusted for publication to Winckelmann. Winckelmann's work was underwritten by Baron von Stosch's nephew and heir, Heinrich Wilhelm Muzel, another lifelong bachelor, {{who had come to}} stay in Florence with Stosch in 1757 and had been adopted and made Philipp von Stosch's heir (ref.

50|$|For many decades, the city's largest {{employer}} was the New England Glass Company, {{founded in}} 1818.

There are also a few pieces in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and in the Sandwich Glass Museum on Cape Cod.|$|E
5000|$|Inspired by European {{work and}} the Pre-Raphaelites, Willet rebelled against the American School of stained glass - a {{movement}} established by Louis Comfort Tiffany and John La Farge identified by its use of opalescent glass. [...] Willet believed that opalescent glass ignored the principles of architecture and did not fulfill {{the purpose of a}} window. Instead, he was enamored with the medieval technique of transparent <b>antique</b> <b>glass,</b> lecturing and writing constantly on the subject. [...] As a member of what Charles J. Connick termed the [...] "Early School" [...] of stained glass artists, Willet, and fellow craftsmen Otto Heinigke and Harry E. Goodhue, are credited with renewing America's interest in traditional medieval materials, techniques, and aesthetic.|$|E
5000|$|When his {{apprenticeship}} {{was over}} (1728), {{he had made}} considerable progress and was considered such a promising and accomplished artist that the city gave him a traveling scholarship to Rome, where in addition to studying oil painting, he studied architecture of the period, making drawings for several churches and palaces (his projects for church buildings earned him a Papal Knight's Cross). He was employed by Prussian antiquarian Baron Philipp von Stosch, whose collection contained over 10,000 cameos, intaglios, and <b>antique</b> <b>glass</b> pastes. Tuscher's pay for organizing the Baron's collection was extremely modest, but he profited greatly from his learned patron's guidance in the sciences.

5000|$|Animal glue was {{the most}} common {{woodworking}} glue for thousands of years until the advent of synthetic glues such as polyvinyl acetate (PVA) and other resin glues in the 20th century.
