5|$|Each {{night the}} {{positions}} of the stars appear to change as the Earth rotates. However, when a star is located along the Earth's <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation,</b> it will remain in the same position and thus is called a pole star. The direction of the Earth's <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> gradually changes over time in a process known as the precession of the equinoxes. A complete precession cycle requires 25,770years, during which time the pole of the Earth's rotation follows a circular path across the celestial sphere that passes near several prominent stars. At present the pole star is Polaris, but around 12,000 BC the pole was pointed only five degrees away from Vega. Through precession, the pole will again pass near Vega around AD 14,000. It is the brightest of the successive northern pole stars.|$|E
5|$|Earth's <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> is tilted, {{producing}} {{seasonal variations}} on the planet's surface. The gravitational interaction between the Earth and Moon causes ocean tides, stabilizes the Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and {{the largest of the}} four terrestrial planets.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the members}} of a close binary system raises tides on the other through {{gravitational}} interaction. However the bulges can be slightly misaligned with respect to the direction of gravitational attraction. Thus the force of gravity produces a torque component on the bulge, resulting in the transfer of angular momentum (tidal acceleration). This causes the system to steadily evolve, although it can approach a stable equilibrium. The effect can be more complex in cases where the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> is not perpendicular to the orbital plane.|$|E

The calculated maximum moment of inertia of a uniformly dense object the same shape as Ida coincides with the spin axis of the asteroid. This suggests that there are no major variations of density within the asteroid. Ida's <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> precesses with a period of 77 thousand years, due to the gravity of the Sun acting upon the nonspherical shape of the asteroid.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotational}} velocity of Beta Pictoris has been measured {{to be at}} least 130km/s. Since this value is derived by measuring radial velocities, this is a lower limit on the true {{rotational velocity}}: the quantity measured is actually v sin(i), where i represents the inclination of the star's <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> to the line-of-sight. If it is assumed that Beta Pictoris is viewed from Earth in its equatorial plane, a reasonable assumption since the circumstellar disk is seen edge-on, the rotation period can be calculated as approximately 16 hours, which is significantly shorter than that of the Sun (609.12 hours).|$|E
5|$|A unique {{feature of}} the Homunculus {{is the ability to}} measure the {{spectrum}} of the central object at different latitudes by the reflected spectrum from different portions of the lobes. These clearly show a polar wind where the stellar wind is faster and stronger at high latitudes thought to be due to rapid rotation causing gravity brightening towards the poles. In contrast the spectrum shows a higher excitation temperature closer to the equatorial plane. By implication the outer envelope of Eta Carinae A is not strongly convective as that would prevent the gravity darkening. The current <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> of the star does not appear to exactly match the alignment of the Homunculus. This may be due to interaction with Eta Carinae B which also modifies the observed stellar winds.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to assess how the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> head <b>rotation,</b> Listing's law, and eye {{position}} influence the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> eye <b>rotation</b> during brief, rapid head rotations. We specifically asked how the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> eye <b>rotation</b> during the initial angular vestibuloocular reflex (VOR) changed when the pitch orientation of the head relative to Earth-vertical was varied, but the initial position of the eye in the orbit and the orientation of Listing's plane with respect to the head were fixed. We measured three-dimensional eye and head rotation axes in eight normal humans using the search coil technique during head-and-trunk (whole-body) and head-on-trunk (head-only) “impulses” about an Earth-vertical axis. The head was initially oriented at one of five pitch angles (30 ° nose down, 15 ° nose down, 0 °, 15 ° nose up, 30 ° nose up). The fixation target was always aligned with the nasooccipital axis. Whole-body impulses were passive, unpredictable, manual, <b>rotations</b> with peak-amplitude <b>of</b> ∼ 20 °, peak-velocity of ∼ 80 °/s, and peak-acceleration of ∼ 1000 °/s 2. Head-only impulses were also passive, unpredictable, manual, <b>rotations</b> with peak-amplitude <b>of</b> ∼ 20 °, peak-velocity of ∼ 150 °/s, and peak-acceleration of ∼ 3000 °/s 2. During whole-body impulses, the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> eye <b>rotation</b> tilted in the same direction, and by an amount proportional (0. 51 ± 0. 09), to the starting pitch head orientation (P < 0. 05). This proportionality constant decreased slightly to 0. 39 ± 0. 08 (P < 0. 05) during head-only impulses. Using the head-only impulse data, with the head pitched up, we showed that only 50 % of the tilt in the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> eye <b>rotation</b> could be predicted from vectorial summation of the gains (eye velocity/head velocity) obtained for rotations about the pure yaw and roll head axes. Thus, even when the orientation of Listing's plane and eye position in the orbit are fixed, the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> eye <b>rotation</b> during the VOR reflects a compromise between the requirements of Listing's law and a perfectly compensatory VOR...|$|R
2500|$|A {{rotation}} {{is simply}} a progressive radial orientation to a common point. That common point lies within the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> that motion. The axis is 90 degrees perpendicular to {{the plane of the}} motion. If the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rotation</b> lies external <b>of</b> the body in question then the body is said to orbit.

5|$|Analyses {{conducted}} contemporarily and independently by Bailey, Batygin and Brown; by Gomes, Deienno and Morbidelli; {{and later}} by Lai suggest that Planet Nine could be responsible for inducing the spin–orbit misalignment of the Solar System. The Sun's <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> is tilted approximately six degrees from the orbital plane of the giant planets. The exact reason for this discrepancy {{remains an open question}} in astronomy. The analysis used computer simulations to show that both the magnitude and direction of tilt {{can be explained by the}} gravitational torques exerted by Planet Nine on the other planets over the lifetime of the Solar System. These observations are consistent with the Planet Nine hypothesis, but do not prove that Planet Nine exists, as there could be some other reason, or more than one reason, for the spin–orbit misalignment of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Hyperion is Titan's nearest {{neighbor}} in the Saturn system. The two moons {{are locked in}} a 4:3 mean-motion resonance with each other, meaning that while Titan makes four revolutions around Saturn, Hyperion makes exactly three. With an average diameter of about 270km, Hyperion is smaller and lighter than Mimas. It has an extremely irregular shape, and a very odd, tan-colored icy surface resembling a sponge, though its interior may be partially porous as well. The average density of about 0.55g/cm3 indicates that the porosity exceeds 40% even assuming it has a purely icy composition. The surface of Hyperion is covered with numerous impact craters—those with diameters 2–10km are especially abundant. It is the only moon besides the small moons of Pluto known to have a chaotic rotation, which means Hyperion has no well-defined poles or equator. While on short timescales the satellite approximately rotates around its long axis {{at a rate of}} 72–75° per day, on longer timescales its <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> (spin vector) wanders chaotically across the sky. This makes the rotational behavior of Hyperion essentially unpredictable.|$|E

40|$|Optokinetic {{nystagmus}} (OKN) was {{induced by}} having subjects watch a moving display in a binocular, head-fixed apparatus. The display {{was composed of}} 3. 3 degrees stripes moving at 35 degrees/s for 45 s. It subtended 88 degrees horizontally by 72 degrees vertically of the central visual field and could be oriented to rotate about axes that were upright or tilted 45 degrees or 90 degrees. The head was held upright or was tilted 45 degrees left or right on the body during stimulation. Head-horizontal (yaw axis) and head-vertical (pitch <b>axis)</b> components <b>of</b> OKN were recorded with electro-oculography (EOG). Slow phase velocity vectors were determined and compared with the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> stimulation and the spatial vertical (gravity axis). With the head upright, the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> eye <b>rotation</b> during yaw axis OKN was coincident with the stimulus axis and the spatial vertical. With the head tilted, a significant vertical component of eye velocity appeared during yaw axis stimulation. As a result the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> eye <b>rotation</b> shifted from the stimulus axis toward the spatial vertical. Vertical components developed within 1 - 2 s of stimulus onset and persisted {{until the end of}} stimulation. In the six subjects there was a mean shift <b>of</b> the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> eye <b>rotation</b> during yaw <b>axis</b> stimulation <b>of</b> approximately 18 degrees with the head tilted 45 degrees on the body. Oblique optokinetic stimulation with the head upright was associated with a mean shift <b>of</b> the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> eye <b>rotation</b> toward the spatial vertical of 9. 2 degrees. When the head was tilted and the same oblique stimulation was given, the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> eye <b>rotation</b> rotated {{to the other side of}} the spatial vertical by 5. 4 degrees. This counterrotation <b>of</b> the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> eye <b>rotation</b> is similar to the "Muller (E) effect," in which the perception of the upright is counterrotated to the opposite side of the spatial vertical when subjects are tilted in darkness. The data were simulated by a model of OKN with a "direct" and "indirect" pathway. It was assumed that the direct visual pathway is oriented in a body, not a spatial frame of reference. Despite the short optokinetic after-nystagmus time constants, strong horizontal to vertical cross-coupling could be produced if the horizontal and vertical time constants were in proper ratio and there were no suppression of nystagmus in directions orthogonal to the stimulus direction. The model demonstrates that the spatial orientation of OKN can be achieved by restructuring the system matrix of velocity storage. We conclude that an important function of velocity storage is to orient slow-phase velocity toward the spatial vertical during movement in a terrestrial environment...|$|R
5|$|The strong {{rotating}} {{winds of}} a tropical cyclone {{are a result}} of the conservation of angular momentum imparted by the Earth's rotation as air flows inwards toward the <b>axis</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation.</b> As a result, they rarely form within 5° of the equator. Tropical cyclones are also almost completely absent from Earth’s southwestern quartersphere, mainly because the shapes of the African and South American continents permit the Benguela and Humboldt Currents to cover ocean basins as far north as 5˚N with excessively cool water. These powerful cold currents also produce much stronger vertical wind shear in the South Atlantic and Southeast Pacific, which typically prevent tropical depressions and minor storms there from developing into cyclones and prevent even the waters of the Brazil Current from being so hot as analogous western boundary currents or ocean gyres. Also, the African easterly jet and areas of atmospheric instability which gives rise to cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, along with the Asian monsoon and Western Pacific Warm Pool, are feature of the Northern Hemisphere and Australia.|$|E
