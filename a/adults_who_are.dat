40|$|Background. The {{ability of}} the Sensory Organization Test (SOT) to detect subtle balance {{problems}} has been challenged. The Head-Shake Sensory Organization Test (HS-SOT) has been developed to improve the delineation of balance performance. Objective. The {{purposes of this study}} were: (1) to examine age-related differences in balance measured with the HS-SOT and (2) to establish the test-retest reli{{ability of the}} HS-SOT in younger <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> healthy and older <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> healthy. Design. A test-retest design was used in this observational measurement study. Methods. Ninety-two younger <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> healthy (mean age = 28. 3 years) and 73 older <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> healthy (mean age = 60. 3 years) underwent the SOT and the HS-SOT. Seventy-seven of them (56 younger adults, 21 older adults) underwent the same assessments 1 to 2 weeks later. Results. The equilibrium scores in HS-SOT conditions 2 (head movements with eyes closed while standing on a firm surface) and 5 (head movements with eyes closed while standing on a sway-referenced surface) were significantly lower than those in tests without dynamic head movements added (SOT conditions 2 and 5). Older adults attained significantly lower scores in both HS-SOT conditions than their younger peers. The test-retest reliability values, reported as intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC [3, 2]), of the HS-SOT scores in conditions 2 and 5 for the younger adults were. 85 and. 78, respectively; those for the older adults were. 64 and. 55, respectively. The corresponding minimal detectable change values for the former were 2. 7 and 16. 2, and those for the latter were 3. 6 and 22. 7. Limitations. Only head rotation movements on the horizontal plane were tested. Conclusions. Adding head movements to the SOT increased the separation of younger <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> healthy and older <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> healthy. The HS-SOT has good reliability, and the reported minimal detectable change values may facilitate the interpretation of clinical studies in which the HS-SOT is used to assess changes in balance performance in younger and older adults.

25|$|In infants, {{behavior}} {{associated with}} attachment {{is primarily a}} process of proximity seeking to an identified attachment figure in situations of perceived distress or alarm, {{for the purpose of}} survival. Infants become attached to <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> sensitive and responsive in social interactions with the infant, and who remain as consistent caregivers for some months during the period from about six months to two years of age. During the later part of this period, children begin to use attachment figures (familiar people) as a secure base to explore from and return to. Parental responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment which in turn lead to 'internal working models' which will guide the individual's feelings, thoughts, and expectations in later relationships. Separation anxiety or grief following serious loss are normal and natural responses in an attached infant.|$|E
25|$|<b>Adults</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> {{members of}} a {{minority}} also have quite high literacy skills in Chinese. Most adults speak several Chinese dialects, and some also speak Li. In old Yacheng City and its vicinity {{as well as for}} several dozen miles west of Huihui and Huixin, the so-called military speech (the official language of the southwest among the northern Chinese dialects) is spoken. In Yanglan Village to the northeast, two Min dialects, both closely related to Cantonese, are spoken: the Mai dialect and the Danzhou dialect, spoken in Haipo Village in the south, which is the same dialect as the dialect spoken in Danzhou in Dan Country {{in the northern part of}} the island. From the east to the west along the seashore, the Hainanese dialect is used. In Sanya City itself one sometimes finds speakers of Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese.|$|E
25|$|Infection in {{otherwise}} healthy adults {{tends to be}} more severe. Treatment with antiviral drugs (e.g. acyclovir or valacyclovir) is generally advised, {{as long as it is}} started within 24–48 hours from rash onset. Remedies to ease the symptoms of chickenpox in adults are basically the same as those used for children. Adults are more often prescribed antiviral medication, as it is effective in reducing the severity of the condition and the likelihood of developing complications. Antiviral medicines do not kill the virus but stop it from multiplying. Adults are advised to increase water intake to reduce dehydration and to relieve headaches. Painkillers such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) are recommended, as they are effective in relieving itching and other symptoms such as fever or pains. Antihistamines relieve itching and may be used in cases where the itching prevents sleep, because they also act as a sedative. As with children, antiviral medication is considered more useful for those <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> more prone to develop complications. These include pregnant women or people who have a weakened immune system.|$|E

25|$|Contemporary {{depictions of}} {{earthquakes}} in film are {{variable in the}} manner in which they reflect human psychological reactions to the actual trauma that can be caused to directly afflicted families and their loved ones. Disaster mental health response research emphasizes the need to be aware of the different roles of loss of family and key community members, loss of home and familiar surroundings, loss of essential supplies and services to maintain survival. Particularly for children, the clear availability of caregiving <b>adults</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> able to protect, nourish, and clothe them in the aftermath of the earthquake, and to help them make sense of what has befallen them has been shown even more important to their emotional and physical health than the simple giving of provisions. As was observed after other disasters involving destruction and loss of life and their media depictions, recently observed in the 2010 Haiti earthquake, it is also important not to pathologize the reactions to loss and displacement or disruption of governmental administration and services, but rather to validate these reactions, to support constructive problem-solving and reflection as to how one might improve the conditions of those affected.|$|E
