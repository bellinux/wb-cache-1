50|$|Early 10-point {{crampons}} lacked forward <b>angled</b> <b>spikes</b> {{and thus}} required step cutting on steep terrain. In the 1930s two additional forward-slanting points were added, making them exceptional for mountaineering and glacier travel and beginning {{a revolution in}} front pointing. There is currently a range of models, including specialized crampons {{with as many as}} 14 points and models with single points for ice climbing.|$|R
40|$|Plant {{height and}} <b>spike</b> length and <b>angle</b> are {{important}} agronomic traits {{in the production}} of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) due to strong correlations with lodging and disease. The objective {{of this study was to}} use QTL analysis to identify genetic regions associated with each trait in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping population derived from a cross of Falcon by Azhul. Falcon is a spring six-row hulless feed barley with long <b>spikes</b> displaying obtuse <b>angles,</b> while Azhul is a spring dwarf, six-row hulless food barley with short <b>spikes</b> displaying acute <b>angles.</b> The population was genotyped using SNP, DArT and SSR markers and quantitative trait loci (QTL) were detected on chromosomes 2 H (102. 8 cM, spikelength), 3 H (89. 2 cM, plant height and 38. 2, <b>spike</b> <b>angle</b> and length), 4 H (19. 0 cM, spike length), and 5 H(106. 7 cM, <b>spike</b> <b>angle).</b> In conclusion, we developed a barley genetic map, which incorporated SNP, DArT and SSR markers, for detection of height and <b>spike</b> length and <b>angle</b> QTL. Three <b>spike</b> <b>angle,</b> one <b>spike</b> length and one plant height QTL were novel and by using comparative genomics we identified possible candidate genes involved in gibberellic acid signaling and auxin- and ethylene-responsive pathways. This knowledge can be used to generate suitable markers for barley breeding improvement...|$|R

Fury used tight camera <b>angles</b> during <b>Spike's</b> {{apartment}} scene with Lindsey to disguise the fact that the same set was used earlier for the opening teaser.

5000|$|The mask {{consists}} of three separate grids, positioned {{in such a way}} that the grids produce three <b>angled</b> diffraction <b>spikes</b> at the focal plane of the instrument for each bright image element. As the instrument's focus is changed, the central spike appears to move from one side of the star to the other. In reality, all three spikes move, but the central spike moves in the opposite direction to the two spikes forming the [...] "X". Optimal focus is achieved when the middle spike is centered between the other two spikes.|$|R
40|$|The flow fields {{around a}} large apex <b>angle.</b> <b>spiked</b> blunt cone have been {{analyzed}} at a hypersonic Mach number through experiments in a free piston-driven shock tunnel and the results, are {{compared with that of}} a laminar 2 -dimensional axisymmetric unsteady Navier-Stokes Solver developed in-house. The model geometry is a 120 apex angle blunt cone equipped with two types of spikes - a disc-tipped spike and it conical-tipped spike, The ratio of total length of the spike to model base diameter was kept at 1. 00. The free-stream Mach number and Reynolds number (per unit length) in the free piston shock tunnel were 6. 99 and 2. 46 x 10 (6). respectively. After Measuring the aerodynamic force on this model. time resolved visualization of the flow was attempted using it high-speed video camera {{in order to understand the}} characteristic features of the high-speed flow over the spiked body and to check if any unsteadiness existed in the flow fields. The experimental results indicate slight shock oscillations near the edge of the cone model when it is equipped with a disc spike, and the shock oscillations appear lobe more pronounced when the model is equipped with a conical spike. However, the pulsation flow mode is not observed in the experimental results, The numerical results agree with the experimental results on the unsteadiness of the flow fields. The experimental result, obtained in this case also serve as a database for the in-house CFD code validation for such high-speed spiked body flows...|$|R
40|$|Many {{previous}} studies have identified QTL for FHB resistance in barley, {{but most of these}} QTL colocate to the same regions. To continue making progress in enhancing the FHB resistance of barley, additional unique sources of resistance must be identified. As an alternative means for identifying FHB resistance in barley, bulked seed of Composite Cross XXX-G was evaluated in China and over 350 early maturing, six-rowed lines with low (< 5 %) infection were selected for further evaluation in the Midwest. In subsequent screening tests, two selections (COMP 351 and COMP 355) consistently exhibited low levels of FHB and deoxynivalenol (DON). Crosses were made between COMP 351 and breeding line M 98 - 102 to identify and map QTL loci conferring resistance to FHB and the accumulation of DON. A population of 137 F 4 : 5 lines derived from COMP 351 x M 98 - 102 was evaluated in seven field trials for FHB severity. Deoxynivalenol (DON) concentration, days to heading, <b>spike</b> <b>angle,</b> height, and <b>spike</b> density were evaluated in most, but not all of the environments.

40|$|The {{supersonic}} flow approaching the intake of a supersonic aero engine must {{be brought to}} subsonic state before reaching the compressor face stage. The velocity reduction is combined with reduction in the total pressure of the flow which is not preferred by the designer of the supersonic gas turbine. In the present paper, analytical and two different numerical techniques were coupled to analyze the flow field in 2 -D, compressible, supersonic spiked intake. The analyses were carried out at Mach number between 1. 8 to 2. 2 and <b>spike</b> <b>angles</b> of 12 and 20. The flow field was subdivided into external part which was solved analytically and internal part which was solved numerically. The numerical analyses ware carried out under two assumptions; method I: non viscous flow and method II: viscous flow. The results are presented and compared based on the predicted values of the pressure recovery at {{the face of the}} compressor. The procedure was verified by comparing with previous experimental works. It was found that the pressure recovery is slightly influenced by the viscosity up to 2. 14 Mach. The pressure recovery values predicted from the non viscous assumption were higher than the corresponding values obtained from the viscous solution. The viscosity contribution becomes more significant as the <b>spike</b> <b>angle</b> is increased from 12 to 20 where noticeable differences in the pressure recovery values were predicted. Accordingly, the diffusion analysis of compressible flow in such conditions assuming viscous, is essential...|$|R
40|$|Dendritic spikes that {{propagate}} {{toward the}} soma are well documented, but their physiological role remains uncertain. Our in vitro patch-clamp recordings and two-photon calcium imaging show that directionselective retinal ganglion cells (DSGCs) utilize orthograde dendritic spikes during physiological activity. DSGCs signal {{the direction of}} image motion. Excitatory subthreshold postsynaptic potentials are observed in DSGCs for motion in all directions and provide a weakly tuned directional signal. However, spikes are generated over only a narrow range of motion <b>angles,</b> indicating that <b>spike</b> generation greatly enhances directional tuning. Our results indicate that spikes are initiated at multiple sites within the dendritic arbors of DSGCs and that each dendritic spike initiates a somatic spike. We propose that dendritic spike failure, produced by local inhibitory inputs, might be a critical factor that enhances directional tuning of somatic spikes...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveFor intracortical brain-machine {{interfaces}} (BMIs), {{action potential}} voltage waveforms are often sorted to separate out individual neurons. If these neurons contain independent tuning information, this process could increase BMI performance. However, the sorting of action potentials (22 ̆ 0 ac 1 ̆ 53 spikes 22 ̆ 0 ac?) requires high sampling rates and is computationally expensive. To explicitly define {{the difference between}} spike sorting and alternative methods, we quantified BMI decoder performance when using threshold-crossing events versus sorted action potentials. ApproachWe used data sets from 58 experimental sessions from two rhesus macaques implanted with Utah arrays. Data were recorded while the animals performed a center-out reaching task with seven different <b>angles.</b> For <b>spike</b> sorting, neural signals were sorted into individual units by using a mixture of gaussians to cluster the first four principal components of the waveforms. For thresholding events, spikes that simply crossed a set threshold were retained. We decoded the data offline using both a Na 3 Bayes classifier for reaching direction and a linear regression to evaluate hand position. ResultsWe found the highest performance for thresholding when placing a threshold between 22 ̆c 62 ̆ 0193 to 22 ̆c 62 ̆ 0194. 5 *VRMS. Spike sorted data outperformed thresholded data for one animal but not the other. The mean Na 3 Bayes classification accuracy for sorted data was 88. 5...|$|R
40|$|Head-direction cells encode an animal's {{heading in}} the {{horizontal}} plane. However, {{it is not clear}} why the directionality of a cell's mean firing rate differs for clockwise, compared to counter-clockwise head turns (this difference is known as the 'separation angle') in anterior thalamus. Here we investigated, in freely-behaving rats, if intrinsic neuronal firing properties are linked to this phenomenon. We found a positive correlation between the separation <b>angle</b> and the <b>spiking</b> variability of thalamic head-direction cells. To test whether this link is driven by hyperpolarisation-inducing currents, we investigated the effect of thalamic reticular inhibition during high-voltage spindles on directional spiking. While the selective directional firing of thalamic neurons was preserved, we found no evidence for entrainment of thalamic head-direction cells by high-voltage spindle oscillations. We then examined the role of depolarisation-inducing currents in the formation of separation angle. Using a single-compartment Hodgkin-Huxley model, we show that modelled neurons fire with higher frequencies during the ascending phase of sinusoidal current injection (mimicking the head-direction tuning curve), when simulated with higher high-threshold calcium channel conductance. These findings demonstrate that the turn-specific encoding of directional signal strongly depends on the ability of thalamic neurons to fire irregularly in response to sinusoidal excitatory activation. Another crucial factor for inducing phase lead to sinusoidal current injection was the presence of spike-frequency adaptation current in the modelled neurons. Our data support a model in which intrinsic biophysical properties of thalamic neurons mediate the physiological encoding of directional information...|$|R
40|$|One of us (JP) {{carried out}} {{photoelectric}} photometry for 12 asteroids at Lowell Observatory in 1984 - 85. We determined the synodic rotation period for (83) Beatrix (10. 11 hr), (121) Hermione (5. 6 hr),(162) Laurentia (11. 87 hr), (508) Princetonia (52. 8 hr), (510) Mabella (19. 40 hr?), and (636) Erika (14. 62 hr). The previously published periods for (276) Adelheid, (344) Desiderata, and (984) Gretia are confirmed. We also present B-V colour indices and provide new {{information for the}} taxonomic classification {{of three of the}} objects. The observations are submitted for publication in Astronomy and Astrophysics. (83) Beatrix was also observed at 1988, 1990 and 1992 apparitions by other observers and we were thus able to calculate its pole position. The purpose of the observations was to study the behavior of asteroid lightcurves at as wide a range of phase angles as possible. Some previous observations, mainly of high-albedo asteroids indicate the presence of an opposition spike at very low phase angles (e. g. Harris and Young, 1986, Bull. Amer. Astron. Soc., 18, 797). Recent theoretical work by Muinonen (1990, PhD. Dissertation,University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland, and references therein) has suggested that wave-optical effects may become important at very small solar phase angles. The phase curves of (83) Beatrix, (276) Adelheid, and (344) Desiderata reach subdegree phase <b>angles.</b> No opposition <b>spike</b> is seen in the phase curves of these asteroids. This seems to certify that opposition spike is mainly a property of high-albedo asteroids and planetary satellites...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse in detail the aspects {{regarding}} increased efficiency of the spike in the game of volleyball, given the requirements of a flawless technique that will maximize the potential of the players. Our intention was to verify whether the steps of approach are unfolding in a uniformly accelerated motion and are leading to a vertical leap in the desired parameters at the moment of take off. We also wanted to check if the range of upper body motion is a determinant in the efficiency of the spike consisting in a high striking point and a remakable hitting force. Material and methods: The video footage was obtained from 6 players of “U” Timisoara’s volleyball team and 6 international players. For the analysis and processing of the footage the program Kinovea was used and the following parameters were assessed: striking speed(m/s), range of motion (cm and °), flexion between arm and forearm, angle of arm with the vertical at contact, movement speed for the first, second and third approach steps. Results: The international subjects had a 12 cm longer path of the hand in striking motion. Given the shorter segments of “U” Timisoara’s players, they compensate by having a 2 ° larger range of motion, above the elite players. We recorded diferent <b>angles</b> of the <b>spiking</b> arm with the vertical for the 2 groups, namely a mean of 24. 5 ° for the elite players and just 15 ° for the players of “U” Timisoara. These aspects lead to a striking speed 3 m/s higher for the international spikers compared to ”U” Timisoara sportsmen. Having measured a uniformly accelerated approach for the international subjects, “U” Timisoara’s players don’t respond to the same requirement with close values of the second and third step of approach...|$|R
