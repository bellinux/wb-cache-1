5|$|In the mid-1960s, the Canadian Defence and Civil Institute of Environmental Medicine {{developed}} the Kidd/Stubbs serial decompression model. This differs from Haldanian models which are parallel models <b>and</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> all compartments {{are exposed to}} ambient partial pressures and no gas interchange occurs between compartments. A serial model assumes that the diffusion takes place {{through a series of}} compartments, and only one is exposed to the ambient partial pressures and is in effect a compartmentalised version of the Hempelman bulk diffusion slab model.|$|E
5|$|The Dashwoods soon {{learn that}} Miss Steele has become Mrs. Ferrars <b>and</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> she {{is married to}} Edward. Later when Edward visits their house, they learn that Miss Steele {{unexpectedly}} jilted him in favor of his brother Robert, and Edward is thus released from his engagement. Edward proposes to and marries Elinor. Edward becomes a vicar, under the patronage of Colonel Brandon, whom Marianne marries. Willoughby is seen watching their wedding from a distance, and then rides away.|$|E
5|$|Typically, such {{models are}} based on the idea of compactification. Starting with the ten- or eleven-dimensional spacetime of string or M-theory, {{physicists}} postulate a shape for the extra dimensions. By choosing this shape appropriately, they can construct models roughly similar to the standard model of particle physics, together with additional undiscovered particles, usually supersymmetric partners to analogues of known particles. One popular way of deriving realistic physics from string theory is to start with the heterotic theory in ten dimensions <b>and</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> the six extra dimensions of spacetime are shaped like a six-dimensional Calabi–Yau manifold. This is a special kind of geometric object named after mathematicians Eugenio Calabi and Shing-Tung Yau. Calabi–Yau manifolds offer many ways of extracting realistic physics from string theory. Other similar methods can be used to construct models with physics resembling to some extent that of our four-dimensional world based on M-theory.|$|E

25|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that in a liquid mixture at a given pressure, each component boils at the boiling point corresponding to the given pressure and the vapors of each component will collect separately and purely. This, however, does not occur even in an idealized system. Idealized models of distillation are essentially governed by Raoult's law and Dalton's law, <b>and</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> vapor–liquid equilibria are attained.|$|E
25|$|Scholars have {{varying degrees}} of {{certainty}} about the historical reliability of the accounts in the gospels, and the only two events whose historicity {{is the subject of}} almost universal agreement among scholars are the baptism and crucifixion of Jesus. Scholars such as E.P. Sanders and separately Craig A. Evans go further <b>and</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> two other events in the gospels are historically certain, namely that Jesus called disciples, and caused a controversy at the Temple.|$|E
25|$|Although {{they provide}} few details {{regarding}} events {{which can be}} clearly dated, one can establish some date ranges regarding the major events in his life by comparison with other sources. A number of historical non-Christian documents, such as Jewish and Greco-Roman sources, {{have been used in}} historical analyses of the chronology of Jesus. Virtually all modern historians agree that Jesus existed, and regard his baptism and his crucifixion as historical events, <b>and</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> approximate ranges for these events can be estimated.|$|E

25|$|One day, the {{landlord}} leaves his overcoat {{in the living}} room and in the pocket of the overcoat is the key to Xi'er's cell. Zhang Ershen is determined to help Xi'er. She takes the key and opens the door for Xi'er, and she flees. Shortly, {{the landlord}} finds Xi'er missing, and sends his accomplice, Mu Renzhi, and other men to chase her. Xi'er comes to a river that stops her. She takes off a shoe and leaves it at the river side, and then hides in the bush. Mu Renzhi and his men find the shoe <b>and</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> Xi'er has drowned herself in the river, and they report to the landlord as such.|$|E
25|$|String {{theory has}} been used to {{construct}} a variety of models of particle physics going beyond the standard model. Typically, such models are based on the idea of compactification.

By choosing this shape appropriately, they can construct models roughly similar to the standard model of particle physics, together with additional undiscovered particles.

500|$|Skeptics {{argue that}} the {{paranoia}} behind a conspiracy theorist's obsession with mind control, population control, occultism, surveillance abuse, Big Business, Big Government, and globalization arises {{from a combination of}} two factors, when he or she: 1) holds strong individualist values and 2) lacks power. The first attribute refers to people who care deeply about an individual's right to make their own choices and direct their own lives without interference or obligations to a larger system (like the government), but combine this with a sense of powerlessness in one's own life, and one gets what some psychologists call [...] "agency panic," [...] intense anxiety about an apparent loss of autonomy to outside forces or regulators. When fervent individualists feel that they cannot exercise their independence, they experience a crisis <b>and</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> larger forces are to blame for usurping this freedom.|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, gave the episode a {{positive}} review, and wrote that it was [...] "A magnificent end to the season." [...] They wrote that the episode was [...] "thoroughly racist" [...] but [...] "completely inoffensive because it's simply very funny." [...] Jake MacNeill of Digital Entertainment News was also favourable, considering it {{to be one of}} the better episodes of the season. James Plath of DVD Town wrote that the episode has [...] "some funny moments." [...] Aaron Roxby of Collider was more critical, denouncing the episode's dated references. He wrote: [...] "I am going to go ahead and give this one the benefit of the doubt <b>and</b> <b>assume</b> <b>that</b> making fun of Japanese junk culture and game shows felt fresher in 1999 than it does do now." [...] Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide called the episode [...] "mediocre".

While he did not consider it to be a bad episode, he thought it [...] "fail to live up to its potential".|$|E
