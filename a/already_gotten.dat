25|$|In February 2012, Schuyler Yancey {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Dr. Cameron Davis. Yancey made his debut on the April 5, 2012 episode. Supermodel, turned actor, known for his {{appearance}} as Rihanna's love interest the California King Bed music video, Nathan Owens began taping the role in late September, in secret. On October 1, 2012, several sources, including Soap Opera Digest confirmed that Owens had joined the cast. Owens was spotted on set for the show's 12, 000th episode during a press conference. However, the producers refused to comment on the role Owens would be playing. The actor himself later confirmed through his own personal Facebook that he had been cast in the role of Cameron. Owens's Instagram message about the casting was believed to be an accident. Soaps In Depth later confirmed that Owens would make his first appearance on the December 21 as a replacement for Yancey. However, due to news coverage of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, Davis first air date was postponed to December 24, 2012. Owens found out about the role through his manager. In an interview, Owens revealed that he went out for the role of Rodney. He worked with casting director, Marnie Saitta and went through several tests. Owens admitted that he had a good feeling about the casting because he was given several opportunities to go over the material. Saitta called him back shortly after his test and told Owens to come back in a few days. He went back and forth a few times before he met with the producers and tested with Kate Mansi who portrayed Abigail. Owens signed on to play Cameron and beat out 15 other actors for the role. Owens admitted to being hesitant about replacing someone, though Yancey was only in the role {{for a short period of}} time, people had <b>already</b> <b>gotten</b> used to him, and Owens said that he felt like he was under a magnifying glass when he started, and that the potential critics made him a bit nervous. On September 21, 2013, at Kate Mansi's birthday party, Owens announced his departure from the series and revealed that he would last air in November.|$|E
500|$|Having {{been hired}} by Beam's parent company Melbourne House, fantasy and sci-fi writer Paul Kidd quickly took Barnett's place as lead designer. According to Kidd, the given {{timeframe}} for finishing Shadowrun for publisher Data East was very short, forcing the team to complete production in a tumultuous {{five and a half}} to six months. An avid role-player, Kidd was already familiar with the Shadowrun license, but had to utilize the storyline that his predecessor had <b>already</b> <b>gotten</b> approved. Aspects of Beam's earlier action-adventure game Nightshade, of which Kidd was the writer, director and lead designer, were used as a basis for Shadowrun; specific film noir components such as [...] "dark cityscapes, dialogue-heavy exchanges, and touches of humor" [...] were adapted directly from the former to the latter. To coincide with the last of these qualities, Kidd and programmer Jeff Kamenek altered the original [...] "serious" [...] tone of Shadowrun by replacing portions of the script and artwork with more comedic elements. According to Kidd, [...] "we made improvements and changes, but the basic concepts were pretty much the same [...]" ...|$|E

Knight's comment was in reference to an Indiana basketball game in which he felt the referees were making poor calls against the Hoosiers.|$|E

2500|$|In 2008, a {{civil case}} {{was brought to the}} Supreme Court of Israel by the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, which alleged that El Al's {{practice}} of ethnic profiling illegally singled out Arab passengers for tougher treatment. The group had petitioned [...] "for the complete elimination of racial profiling" [...] by the airline. In 2015, the court dismissed the petition on procedural grounds, accepting in part the government's argument [...] "that it could not completely change without heavily burdening all travelers," [...] but reimbursing the Association for Civil Rights in Israel a total of NIS 30,000 for its legal fees, and finding that the petition [...] "had <b>already</b> <b>gotten</b> security to be less discriminatory."

2500|$|Some critics {{remained}} {{skeptical of}} Stack's position, such as then-Republican candidate for Assembly Richard Valdes, who said, [...] "I challenge Assemblyman and Mayor Brian Stack {{to disclose the}} nature of his relationship and questionable campaign contributions from Medrano." [...] Stack responded that he never met Medrano until a fundraiser held a year earlier, saying that Medrano was stopped at the door and was turned away from contributing to the event. [...] Valdes also questioned the acceptance, by Stack’s campaign committee, of $5,000 from Union City truck driver David Lopez, who had sold a vacant Union City lot to the Jersey City School Construction Corporation for $1.48 million, after Lopez had <b>already</b> <b>gotten</b> zoning approval and began advertisement for condominiums to be built on it. Stack also stated that he was unaware of that donation, that it was donated to the PERC Homeless Shelter, and that Valdes’ comments were political-motivated.|$|E
2500|$|The {{military}} {{establishment of the}} Ōuchi opposed Yoshitaka's plan to settle the imperial court in Yamaguchi — {{such a move would}} see privileges accorded to the courtiers and undermine the military's standing in the Ōuchi clan, not to mention the plan being prohibitively expensive. This faction, represented by Sue Takafusa, also felt that Yoshitaka had become [...] "weak" [...] due to his complete obsession with the arts to the detriment of military matters after the failed siege of Toda Castle in 1543 against the Amago clan. Sue Takafusa, one of Yoshitaka's deputy shugodai, [...] also took personal offence at the rise of the calligrapher Sagara Taketō, who benefited from Ōuchi inward turn towards literary and courtly pursuits. Takafusa's dissatisfaction was such that another of Yoshitaka's deputy shugodai Sugi Shigenori (杉重矩) warned that Takafusa started conspiring against Yoshitaka by extension. However, Yoshitaka dismissed the threat, which caused Shigenori to lose confidence in Yoshitaka's judgement and threw in his lot with Takafusa. Yoshitaka apparently placed his faith in his ally Mōri Motonari to come to his rescue in case trouble came from within; however, he did not know that Takafusa had <b>already</b> <b>gotten</b> Motonari's tacit approval for his coup. At the eve of his rebellion, Takafusa not only gained the support of fellow Ōuchi deputies Sugi Shigenori and Naitō Okimori (内藤興盛), but also the Ōuchi's rival daimyo Ōtomo Sōrin in Kyushu.|$|E

2500|$|The Second Italo-Ethiopian War {{was to be}} Mussolini's way {{of making}} up for Italy's {{embarrassing}} defeat {{at the hands of}} the Ethiopians in the First Italo-Ethiopian War in 1896, and was also a chance to expand the Italian empire by taking one of the last regions of Africa not controlled by other European powers and divert the populace from economic woes. General Emilio de Bono put on record that preparations for the invasion of Ethiopia (Abyssinia) had been going on since 1932 as roads were being built from Italian Somaliland into Ethiopian territory, though Mussolini constantly claimed that he was not a [...] "collector of deserts" [...] and would never think of invading. Ethiopians protested this build-up to war which eventually led up to a border clash at Walwal. Mussolini called this clash [...] "unprovoked aggression" [...] by Ethiopia and Italian forces invaded on 3 October 1935, led by de Bono. In only three days the Italians had captured Adwa where the former disgraceful defeat had happened. In December Pietro Badoglio replaced de Bono as commander of the invasion because of de Bono's cautious advance. On 31 March 1936, a desperate final counter-attack by Haile Selassie, king of Ethiopia, was carried out, though word of the attack had <b>already</b> <b>gotten</b> to the Italians, giving them victory in the Battle of Maychew. Only a few days later the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa was conquered, allowing Italy to annex the country on 7 May, proclaiming Victor Emmanuel III Emperor of Ethiopia. Italy's East African possessions was unified into the colony of Italian East Africa.|$|E
