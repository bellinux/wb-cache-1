40|$|Abstract. There is {{the grade}} {{as one of}} the {{selection}} criteria of a grinding wheel like WA whetstone or GC whetstone. The grade of grinding wheel is defined as an index which shows the strength of connection of a grain and a grain, and is usually estimated by bending strength. There are many papers about the relationship between the grade of a grinding wheel and the grinding performance. Relationship between the grade of a grinding wheel and the grinding performance is almost clear. Also, the relationship between mechanical properties of a grinding wheel and the grade is also clear. On the other hand, since the grain layer of a super <b>abrasive</b> grinding <b>wheel</b> is thin, it is difficult to apply the conventional evaluation test of the grade. The evaluation method of the grade which can be adapted the super <b>abrasive</b> grinding <b>wheel</b> is not established. In addition, since the grade of a super <b>abrasive</b> grinding <b>wheel</b> is a manufacture manufacturer's original standard, there is a minute difference by manufacturer. The super <b>abrasive</b> grinding <b>wheel</b> as well as the grinding wheel is conjectured that the grade influences the grinding performance. Namely, it is important to relate the grade and the mechanical properties of a grain layer. However, researches which relate the grade, the grinding performance and the mechanical properties of a super <b>abrasive</b> grinding <b>wheel</b> are not done so far. Therefore, this study examined the relationship between the mechanical properties of a grai...|$|R
