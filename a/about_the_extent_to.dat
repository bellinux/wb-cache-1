5|$|Critics {{were divided}} in their reviews of The Turn of the Screw. The acting and {{tone of the}} {{production}} were generally praised, but the plot's divergences from the original story were less well received. A particular disagreement concerned the film's horrific elements; some critics considered it to be genuinely scary, while others suggested that the horror was not fully effective. The original story has been much analysed owing to its ambiguity, and critics disagreed <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> which the film succeeded in portraying this trait. Academic analyses found the film considerably less ambiguous than the novella. The Turn of the Screw was released on DVD on 1 March 2010 in the UK and on 28 April 2015 in North America.|$|E

In 2001 - 2, two research councils (the Economic and Social Research Council and Medical Research Council) commended us to examine the potential for applying social science knowledge about risk to practical medical and health issues. We have used our findings to tackle the thorny issue of physician-patient communication about health risks. ...|$|R

In particular, neuroticism has been said to relate to negative emotionality and anxiety. Intuitively, individuals scoring high on neuroticism are likely to score low on self-report EI measures.|$|E

Thus, a constant pay gap across income levels would raise questions along the lines just noted.|$|R
25|$|The Irish {{constituted}} a {{larger proportion of}} the European population than in any other British colony, and there has been debate <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> which Irish was used in Australia. The historian Patrick O’Farrell argued that the language was soon discarded; other historians, including Dymphna Lonergan and Val Noone, have argued that its use was widespread among the first generation, with some transmission to the second and occasional evidence of literacy. Most Irish immigrants came from counties in the west and south-west where Irish was strong (e.g. County Clare and County Galway). It has been argued that at least half the approximately 150,000 Irish emigrants to Victoria in the 19th century spoke Irish, helping to make Irish the most widely used European language in Australia after English.|$|E
25|$|During their incarceration, {{multiple}} prominent Quaker leaders {{attempted to}} intervene {{on behalf of}} Evans and Cheevers, including George Fox, but this was unsuccessful except in one case. Prior to his visit, fellow traveling Quaker missionary Daniel Baker had an angel appear to him and tell him of their situation. He went to visit them and to offer himself up as a prisoner {{in exchange for the}} freedom of Evans and Cheevers, but his offer was denied. Instead, he took efforts to deliver letters and works the women had written to England. He was only able to obtain their works after they threw them out a window to him; they were initially intercepted, but he was able to make copies for the prison and keep the originals. Baker continued in his travels, but returned to England to publish their writings on behalf of Evans and Cheevers in 1662. Evans and Cheevers appreciated this, and referred to Baker in terms such as “Our dear Brother.” Historians are unsure <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> which Baker edited or altered Evans and Cheever’s original manuscripts, but most agree that Baker’s influence was minimal and largely inconsequential.|$|E
25|$|Since the Chinese state {{continues}} to exert {{a considerable amount}} of control over media, public support for domestic reporting has {{come as a surprise to}} many observers. Not much is known <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> which the Chinese citizenry believe the official statements of the CPC, nor about which media sources they perceive as credible and why. So far, research on the media in China has focused on the changing relationship between media outlets and the state during the reform era. Nor is much known about how China's changing media environment has affected the government's ability to persuade media audiences. Research on political trust reveals that exposure to the media correlates positively with support for the government in some instances, and negatively in others. The research has been cited as evidence that the Chinese public believes propaganda transmitted to them through the news media, but also that they disbelieve it. These contradictory results can be explained by realizing that ordinary citizens consider media sources to be credible to a greater or lesser degree, depending on the extent to which media outlets have undergone reform.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, the two {{disagreed}} <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> {{which the}} deepest elements of Chassidic wisdom {{should be taught}} openly. Rabbi Dovber, in his magnum opus Sha'ar HaYichud (The Gate of Unity), explains the entire spiritual superstructure of creation. Rabbi Aharon, on the other hand, {{argued that it was}} dangerous to discuss certain aspects of creation because it could lead a person to inadvertently view God anthropomorphically. Therefore, it is merely enough for a person to know that God is so great that His Existence precludes the existence of any created beings, but that created beings exist, nonetheless. This very paradox is a testimony to the greatness of God. While Rabbi Aharon's teachings involve some of the deepest aspects of Kabbalistic wisdom, they nonetheless entreat the reader to use the deep intellectual wisdom of Kabbala in order to inspire simple love and fear for God. This was the foundation of Rabbi Dovber's doctrine as well, and in fact a cornerstone in Rabbi Shneur Zalman's own Tanya. The difference lay primarily in the outer (Chitzonius) emotional conduct Rabbi Aharon expected of his followers, and the intense manifestation of self-effacement Rabbi Dovber expected of his.|$|E
25|$|The agrarian reforms {{sparked a}} massive {{movement}} among the socii to demand full citizenship. It also provoked an intense {{debate within the}} Roman élite <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> which those demands should be met. But it appears from the fragmentary evidence that the conservative majority in the Roman Senate succeeded, by both fair means and foul, in blocking any significant expansion of citizenship among the socii in the period following the agrarian law of 133 BC. Gracchus himself, aware of the problems caused by his own reforms, promised the socii large-scale extension of Roman citizenship. But he was assassinated before he could deliver. In 95, the Roman Censors passed the Lex Licinia Mucia specifically to curb irregular acquisition of citizenship by wealthy allies (presumably by bribing Roman magistrates to enter their names on the citizen-rolls). The last straw for the socii was the assassination in 91 BC of another of their champions, the tribune of the plebs Marcus Livius Drusus. Drusus had specifically promised citizenship to all the allies, of all classes. His death sparked a series of conferences among the socii, at which mutual oaths of allegiance and hostages were exchanged. A league was formed to fight the Romans.|$|E

In complex systems like smart sustainable cities, and with complicated endeavors like sustainable development, backcasting is an effective approach to align various measures with each other, and thus to ensure that each activity is the logical platform for the next one, to draw on Robèrt [60]. In addition, backcasting is well suited for long-term problems and long-term sustainability solutions thanks to its normative and problem-solving character [27]. Furthermore, as pointed out by Robinson [63], backcasting is not necessarily only about how desirable futures can be created and attained but also <b>about</b> analyzing <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> which undesirable futures can be responded to or avoided. Overall, backcasting studies must reflect solutions to a specified social problem in the broader sense [27].|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. The dataset contains {{the results of}} a survey investigating green supply chain integration practices among supply chain companies in the UK. This is among the first ever survey of green supply chain management practices from an integrated perspective. The survey asked respondents <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>extents</b> <b>to</b> which their companies practice various green supply chain integration activities, and <b>the</b> <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> which their companies performance have achieved competitive performance in terms of cost, finance, environment. The respondents also provided demographic data about their companies. Analyses of the survey data show that some companies managed to become lean, green and profitable by collectively implementing four types of green supply chain integration: green internal, green supplier, green customer and green stakeholder integration. Project description: In recent years firms are under pressure to reduce environmental impacts of their global supply chains. Customers in many developed countries intend to accuse or boycott firms lacking environmental responsibility if their developing-country supply chain partners are convicted of causing environmental damage. This has triggered the needs for suppliers and customers to coordinate environmental management practices. This research proposes a novel concept for environmental collaboration among suppliers and customers. The new concept, called “green supply chain integration”, involves the strategic collaboration of partner firms in a supply chain to manage the operational and environmental impacts of supply chain activities by coordinating the intra- and inter-organisational processes. This concept extends the concept of environmental collaboration by integrating environmental management systems across a supply chain. The research is anticipated to identify effective practices of green supply chain integration that can simultaneously improve operational and environmental performance of firms from developing and developed countries. It contributes to the understanding of policy issues and helps to re-frame debates surrounding the adverse effects of the environmental regulation differences between developed and developing countries. The outcomes of this research help to advance knowledge on environmental collaboration and sustainability within the business and management discipline...|$|R
