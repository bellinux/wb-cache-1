5000|$|... "Family Furnishings": The narrator reminisces about Alfrida, her father's nonconformist {{cousin who}} worked as an advice {{columnist}} in the city. Alfrida seems urbane and sophisticated to the young narrator, who views her with admiration. Once the narrator attends college, however, she distances herself from Alfrida and avoids her frequent dinner invitations. The narrator's only visit to Alfrida is marked by the narrator's condescension toward Alfrida's poverty and lack of cultivation. The dinner, however, does make one lasting impression. Alfrida recalls how her mother died of severe burns caused by an exploding lamp. She had {{wanted to see her}} mother but was denied by relatives; Alfrida responded by saying that her mother would have wanted to see her if their places were reversed. Later in life, the narrator transforms this incident into a short story that offends the elderly Alfrida. She receives no more information about Alfrida until Alfrida's illegitimate daughter appears at the funeral of the narrator's father. The daughter tells the narrator that Alfrida grudgingly admired the narrator's writing, although Alfrida thought that the narrator wasn't <b>as</b> <b>smart</b> <b>as</b> <b>she</b> thought she was. This revelation causes the narrator to return to the evening of her last dinner with her father's cousin. Afterward she had gone to a coffee shop where, drinking the coffee and watching the middle-class men and women around her, the narrator had thought that this was what she truly wanted out of life.|$|E
