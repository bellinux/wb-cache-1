We presented the temporal and spatial changes in occurrence frequency of major rice disasters, including droughts, floods, heat stress, chilling damage, insects and diseases, during the warmer period of 2000 - 2009, in comparison with the period of 1991 - 2000, based on both the observed records and the meteorological indexes. The results showed that changes in rice disasters could be largely ascribed to changes in climate extremes in recent decades.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Nepal is an agrarian {{country where}} {{agriculture}} {{accounts for about}} 32 % of its gross domestic product. Rice is currently grown on about 1. 5 M ha area, which is half of its total cropped area, and contributes {{more than half of}} the total food grain production in the country. Flood and drought are two major <b>agricultural</b> <b>disasters,</b> especially in the Terai (foothills) region, where about 70 % of the country’s rice is produced. The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) has initiated a project aimed at targeting three major rice stresses-submergence, drought and salinity in South Asia. In order to tackle the problem of submergence due to flash flooding, a submergence- tolerant gene, SUB 1, has recently been incorporated in several popular rice varieties of South and Southeast Asia. These varieties with SUB 1 can survive two weeks of complete submergence, and still produce a high yield. In Nepal, two varieties, Swarna-Sub 1 and Sambha Mahsuri-Sub 1, have been released in 2012. Apart from submergence tolerance, five drought-tolerant rice varieties bred by IRRI in partnership with the Nepa...|$|R

40|$|Risk {{assessment}} of drought disaster {{is necessary for}} the sustained agriculture development under the background of global climate change, and, meanwhile, it is an urgent scientific issue needed to be solved in agricultural risk assessment discipline. In this paper, collecting the areas covered by drought disasters, areas affected by drought disasters, areas with no harvest by drought disasters, areas planted, and yield per unit area data, <b>agricultural</b> drought <b>disasters</b> losses of the southern five provinces in China were calculated. The best probability density function was obtained according to the goodness of fit test results.

The results show that, in southern five provinces of our research region, risk of <b>agricultural</b> drought <b>disaster</b> in Yunnan and Guizhou is greater than other three provinces. In the scenario of 50 years and 100 years for a return, the crop loss caused by drought will reach 13. 6 % and 17. 4 % in Yunnan province, and the crop loss will be more serious in Guizhou province and be up to 15. 3 % and 18. 1 %.
