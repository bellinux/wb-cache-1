At 50 ° C normally regarded as an acceptable operational temperature for saccharification processes the enzymes significantly loses its activity and this thermal deactivation was independent of initial enzyme concentration used. The degree of cellulose conversion through a series of consecutive hydrolytic/recycling rounds dropped more substantially when low concentrations of cellulases were used. The hydrolysis yield and enzyme recycling efficiency in consecutive recycling rounds can be increased by using high enzyme loadings and moderate temperatures.

We describe the translocation and GPI modification {{of a model}} protein, preprominiPLAP, in ER microsomes depleted of lumenal content by high pH washing. In untreated microsomes preprominiPLAP was processed to prominiPLAP and GPI-anchored miniPLAP. Both products were fully translocated, since they resisted proteinase K treatment of the microsomes, and both behaved as membrane proteins by the carbonate extraction criterion. Microsomes depleted of lumenal content were able to translocate and process preprominiPLAP to give protease-protected prominiPLAP, but were unable to convert prominiPLAP to miniPLAP. Loss of GPI anchoring capacity occurred with a wash of pH > 9. 5. If the <b>alkaline</b> <b>wash</b> was performed after formation of prominiPLAP conversion to miniPLAP was relatively unimpaired.

Two 360 kg lysimeter experiments were con-ducted to study percolation washing of contaminants from stockpiled MSW bottom ash.

Located on the stromal {{side of the}} thylakoids, PsaD was found to assemble in vitro into the membranes in its precursor (pre-PsaD) and also in its mature (PsaD) form. Newly assembled unprocessed pre-PsaD was resistant to NaBr and <b>alkaline</b> <b>wash.</b> Yet it was sensitive to proteolytic digestion.

This protection of mature PsaD from proteolysis could not be observed when PsaD was in a soluble form-i. e. not assembled within the thylakoids. The data suggest that pre-PsaD assembles to the membranes and only in a second step processing takes place.

The {{effect of the}} pH on the structural stability of purified Cel 7 A was analyzed by circular dichroism.

Temperature influenced the enzymatic hydrolysis of wheat straw and may be critical for the efficiency of cellulase recycling from wheat straw hydrolysates. Operation at moderate temperatures (37 °C) resulted in a rate of saccharification 19 % higher than that obtained at 50 ° C, improving cellulase recycling by 49 %.

Other specific goal of the tests were to evaluate the extraction efficiency of arsenic using <b>alkaline</b> or acid <b>washing,</b> to determine optimum operational parameters of <b>alkaline</b> <b>washing,</b> and to evaluate the arsenic precipitation of washing effluents by pH adjustment or ferric chloride addition. <b>Alkaline</b> <b>washing</b> using sodium hydroxide {{was found to be}} favorable in removing arsenic from tailings or soils having a higher portion of arsenic in the operationally defined crystalline mineral fraction of crystalline oxide and amorphous aluminosilicates. This is due to the ligand displacement reaction of hydroxyl ions with arsenic species and high pH conditions that can prevent readsorption of arsenic because predominant negatively charged crystalline oxides do not attract the negatively charged oxyanions. For tailings, sodium hydroxide had 10 - 20 times higher extraction efficiencies than hydrochloric- or citric acid. The optimum concentration of sodium hydroxide for soil washing was determined to be 200 mM for all samples, while the optimum ratios were 10 : 1 and 5 : 1 for tailings and field/river sedimentary soils, respectively. The washing effluent of river soil was effectively treated by adjusting pH to 5 - 6 with hydrochloric acid, resulting in arsenic concentrations of < 50 Î¼g l- 1. In the case of field soil effluent, an addition of ferric chloride with a minimum mass ratio of 11 (Fe/As) was needed to reduce the arsenic below 50 Î¼g l- 1. Â© 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Considering the current scenario, the understanding of biopulping mechanisms has gained renewed attention because more resistant and competitive fungal species could be selected with basis on a function-directed screening project. A series of studies aimed to elucidate structural changes in lignin during wood biodegradation by C. subvermispora had indicated that lignin depolymerization occurs during initial stages of wood biotreatment. Aromatic hydroxyls did not increase with the split of aryl-ether linkages, suggesting that the ether-cleavage-products remain as quitione-type structures. On the other hand, cellulose is more resistant to the attack by C subvermispora. MnP-initiated lipid peroxidation reactions have been proposed to explain degradation of non-phenolic lignin substructures by C subvermispora, while the lack of cellobiohydrolases and the occurrence of systems able to suppress Fenton`s reaction in the cultures have explained non-efficient cellulose degradation by this biopulping fungus.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} work {{describes the}} development, validation {{and application of}} highly sensitive UFLC-MS/MS methods for the bio-analysis of narcotic analgesics. In chapter I, the narcotic analgesics and the LC-MS technique were introduced. The narcotic analgesics are widely used {{for the treatment of}} pain, making them important in the clinical world. Due to their morphine-like effects, these substances are commonly abused which illustrates the forensic context. Analysis of narcotic analgesics and metabolites allowing accurate quantification is thus clearly required for both clinical and forensic investigations. LC-MS is an excellent technique for the analysis of target analytes in complex mixtures such as biological matrices. Recent developments (such as the use of columns with small particles or UPLC or UFLC technology) increase the sensitivity and selectivity of LC-MS even more. The greatest disadvantage of LC-MS, the disturbing effect of co-eluting molecules on ionization of the target analyte was discussed, toghether with strategies to evaluate and overcome these so called matrix effects. In chapter II, several factors (sample preparation, ionization interface, mobile phase and LC column) were optimized in order to obtain highest sensitivity for the detection of fentanyl and its major metabolite norfentanyl. As such, disturbing matrix effects can be minimized while recovery and sensitivity can be maximized. After optimization, the method was fully validated for both urine and whole blood. To the best of our knowledge, the UFLC-MS/MS method presented here is the most sensitive method available for analysis of fentanyl and norfentanyl in urine and blood. Several factors contributed to high sensitivity: (1) appropriate sample preparation: the use of mixed-mode SPE and an extra <b>alkaline</b> <b>wash</b> step in the SPE protocol removed interferences and concentrated the analytes; (2) optimal ionization interface: the use of ESI instead of APCI proved to be more effective for both fentanyl and norfentanyl; (3) optimized chromatography including (a) the use of a mobile phase at high pH instead of the conventional low pH which resulted in a higher signal and (b) the use of columns with small particle size (1. 7 µm versus 2. 5 µm) and small internal diameter (2. 1 mm versus 3. 0 mm) which resulted in smaller and sharper peaks and thus enhanced sensitivity. In chapter III, we extended the method development strategy used in chapter II to other relevant narcotic analgesics. As a result a highly sensitive UFLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the analysis of nine narcotic analgesics and metabolites (buprenorphine, O-desmethyltramadol, fentanyl, norbuprenorphine, norfentanyl, pethidine, piritramide, tilidine and tramadol) in urine and blood. As in chapter II, the <b>alkaline</b> <b>wash</b> step in the SPE protocol, ESI as ionization interface, the mobile phase at high pH and the column with smaller internal diameter and particle size were found to be crucial parameters warranting the high sensitivity of the method. It can be surmised that the optimized parameters (sample preparation, mobile phase, ionization interface and column) should be considered to increase sensitivity of LC-MS methods for other compounds than the opioids studied here. In chapter IV, the applicability of the developed and validated UFLC-MS/MS methods was demonstrated by analysis of thirteen post-mortem forensic cases involving the use of narcotic analgesics. Urine, blood, liver, bile and/or hair were succesfully analyzed and the found results were carefully interpreted. In nine cases, we could conclude that the death of the victim was (partly) caused by the use of narcotic analgesics. It is clear that the presented UFLC-MS/MS methods are useful in forensic research. Moreover, their use can be extended to clinical investigations. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The hydrolysis/fermentation {{of wheat}} straw and the adsorption/desorption/deactivation of cellulases were studied using Cellic® CTec 2 (Cellic) and Celluclast mixed with Novozyme 188. The {{distribution}} of enzymes cellobiohydrolase I (Cel 7 A), endoglucanase I (Cel 7 B) and -glucosidase {{of the two}} formulations between the residual substrate and supernatant {{during the course of}} enzymatic hydrolysis and fermentation was investigated. The potential of recyclability using <b>alkaline</b> <b>wash</b> was also studied. The efficiency of hydrolysis with an enzyme load of 10 FPU/g cellulose reached > 98 % using Cellic® CTec 2, while for Celluclast a conversion of 52 % and 81 %, was observed without and with -glucosidase supplementation, respectively. The decrease of Cellic® CTec 2 activity observed along the process was related to deactivation of Cel 7 A rather than of Cel 7 B and -glucosidase. The adsorption/desorption profiles during hydrolysis/fermentation revealed that a large fraction of active enzymes remained adsorbed to the solid residue throughout the process. Surprisingly, this was the case of Cel 7 A and -glucosidase from Cellic, which remained adsorbed to the solid fraction along the entire process. Alkaline washing was used to recover the enzymes from the solid residue. This method allowed efficient recovery of Celluclast enzymes; however, this may be achieved only when minor amounts of cellulose remain present. Regarding the Cellic formulation, neither the presence of cellulose nor lignin restricted an efficient desorption of the enzymes at alkaline pH. This work shows that the recycling strategy must be customized for each particular formulation, since the enzymes found e. g. in Cellic and Celluclast bear quite different behaviour regarding the solid-liquid distribution, stability and cellulose and lignin affinity.

40|$|BACKGROUND : Co-production of {{chemicals}} from lignocellulosic biomass alongside fuels holds promise {{for improving the}} economic outlook of integrated biorefineries. In current biochemical conversion processes that use thermochemical pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis, fractionation of hemicellulose-derived and cellulose-derived sugar streams is possible using hydrothermal or dilute acid pretreatment (DAP), which then offers a route to parallel trains for fuel and chemical production from xylose- and glucose-enriched streams. Succinic acid (SA) is a co-product of particular interest in biorefineries because it could potentially displace petroleum-derived chemicals and polymer precursors for myriad applications. However, SA production from biomass-derived hydrolysates {{has not yet been}} fully explored or developed. RESULTS : Here, we employ Actinobacillus succinogenes 130 Z to produce succinate in batch fermentations from various substrates including (1) pure sugars to quantify substrate inhibition, (2) from mock hydrolysates similar to those from DAP containing single putative inhibitors, and (3) using the hydrolysate derived from two pilot-scale pretreatments: first, a mild <b>alkaline</b> <b>wash</b> (deacetylation) followed by DAP, and secondly a single DAP step, both with corn stover. These latter streams are both rich in xylose and contain different levels of inhibitors such as acetate, sugar dehydration products (furfural, 5 -hydroxymethylfurfural), and lignin-derived products (ferulate, p-coumarate). In batch fermentations, we quantify succinate and co-product (acetate and formate) titers as well as succinate yields and productivities. We demonstrate yields of 0. 74 g succinate/g sugars and 42. 8 g/L succinate from deacetylated DAP hydrolysate, achieving maximum productivities of up to 1. 27 g/L-h. Moreover, A. succinogenes is shown to detoxify furfural via reduction to furfuryl alcohol, although an initial lag in succinate production is observed when furans are present. Acetate seems to be the main inhibitor for this bacterium present in biomass hydrolysates. CONCLUSION : Overall, these results demonstrate that biomass-derived, xylose-enriched hydrolysates result in similar yields and titers but lower productivities compared to clean sugar streams, which can likely be improved via fermentation process developments and metabolic engineering. Overall, this study comprehensively examines the behavior of A. succinogenes on xylose-enriched hydrolysates on an industrially relevant, lignocellulosic feedstock, which will pave the way for future work toward eventual SA production in an integrated biorefinery.

40|$|Although 2 G-biofuels {{have been}} {{implemented}} in some countries for some decades now, its economic viability remains an important drawback, hampering it to compete with fossil fuels. Great {{attention has been given}} to the discovery of new lignocellulosic substrates and strategies {{to reduce the amount of}} enzyme required for this process, both representing critical factors on the process economics. Recycled paper sludge (RPS) is an cellulosic residue obtained from paper recycling process, being mostly incinerated or disposed in landfills. In spite of being comprised by a considerable carbohydrates content, very few studies have exploited this potential. Similarly, although several works have studied the profiles of enzyme adsorption/desorption on lignocellulosic substrates, strategies of cellulase recycling have poorly been implemented so far. Here, we describe the implementation of a cellulase recycling system for the particular case of RPS hydrolysis. Following preliminary results suggesting RPS suitability to be hydrolysed and later fermented, the distribution of enzymes at the end of hydrolysis was initially investigated. For a moderate enzyme loading, 20 FPU/gcellulose, and 5 % solids, 80 % of final Cel 7 A activity was found in the liquid fraction, and thus can be easily recovered and reutilized in a new round. Solid-bound enzymes, which still correspond to 20 %, were efficiently recovered to an extent around 85 % applying a simple <b>alkaline</b> <b>wash,</b> enabling its equal reutilization for a new hydrolysis. Following these results, 4 consecutive rounds of hydrolysis were conducted with this substrate recovering both cellulase fractions at the end of each round. Additionally, a portion of fresh enzyme, corresponding to 20 % of the original load, was added at each round to compensate activity loss. Ethanol was produced in all rounds although with a decrease over the process, possibly reflecting a reduction on substrate saccharification. Nonetheless, this system enabled a reduction of 60 % on process enzyme corresponding to a significant improvement in the process economics. These results also demonstrate that RPS, a residue that has been widely ignored so far, can be hydrolysed, fermented and is suitable for cellulase recycling, and thus have huge potential to be employed in a bio-refinery context...|$|E

Thus, <b>alkaline</b> <b>wash</b> residues may require an additional treatment to remove actinides. The results of this research will determine the nature TRU (Np, Pu, Am) speciation with aluminate anions under alkaline, oxidizing tank-like conditions. Specific issues to be addressed include solubility of these actinides, speciation in aluminate-containing alkaline supernatants, the role of actinide redox states on solubility, and partitioning between supernatant and solid phases, including colloids. Studies will include thermodynamics, kinetics, spectroscopy, electrochemistry, etc. It is already known, for example, that certain high valent forms of NF and Pu are very soluble under alkaline conditions due to the formation of anionic hydroxo complexes, AnO{sub 2 }(OH) {sub 4 }{sup 2 -} and AnO{sub 2 }(OH) {sub 5 }{sup 3 -}. The presence of aluminate ions causes the actinide solubilities to increase, although the exact species have only been determined during this program. We are continuing to characterize high-valent TRU elements bound to oxo, water, OH{sup -}, under waste-like and sludge washing conditions. These conditions are in the range of 1 - 3 M excess hydroxide, {approx} 0. 2 M carbonate, {approx} 0. 5 M aluminate, for a total sodium of 2 - 4 mols/kg. Molecular structure-specific probes include vibrational (IR and Raman), multinuclear nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), luminescence, optical absorption (UV-Vis-conventional and photoacoustic) spectroscopies. We anticipate that the knowledge gained during this project will impact on clean-up approaches to significantly reduce costs, schedules, and risks...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Fentanyl, a {{synthetic}} narcotic analgesic with high potency and its major metabolite norfentanyl often occur in low doses in biological samples. AIM A highly sensitive UFLC-MS/MS method for determination of fentanyl and norfentanyl in urine and blood {{was developed and}} fully validated. METHODS Blood (1 ml) and urine samples (2 ml) were extracted on mixed-mode cation exchange Bond Elut Plexa PCX SPE cartridges followed by UFLC-MS/MS analysis (Shimadzu Prominence UFLC coupled to 3200 QTRAP, Applied Biosystems). Different sources (APCI vs. ESI), columns (with varying internal diameter and/or particle size) and mobile phases (low pH vs. high pH; acetonitrile vs. methanol) were evaluated. The final method was fully validated. RESULTS In order to obtain a highly sensitive method, several parameters were optimised. In the SPE protocol, an additional <b>alkaline</b> <b>wash</b> step was added in order to decrease matrix effects. Ionization of fentanyl and norfentanyl with ESI was more efficient than APCI. The use of a mobile phase of high pH resulted in higher ESI signals than the conventional low pH mobile phases. A comparison of columns with different internal diameter and/or smaller particles showed optimal resolution and sensitivity when an Acquity C 18 column (1. 7 µm, 2. 1 mm x 50 mm) was used. The final method of preference lasted 6 minutes and gradient elution with 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate (pH 9) and methanol was performed. Deuterium labeled internal standards were used, but with careful evaluation of their stability since deuterium exchange was observed. The method was selective and stable for fentanyl and norfentanyl. No matrix effects and optimal extraction efficiency was seen because {{of the use of}} appropriate internal standards. The method was linear from 0. 0025 to 5 ng/ml for fentanyl in urine, 0. 005 to 10 ng/ml for norfentanyl in urine and 0. 01 to 20 ng/ml for both fentanyl and norfentanyl in blood. Accuracy, repeatability and intermediate precision ranged between - 15 % and 15 %. With limits of detection of 0. 25 pg/ml for fentanyl and 2. 5 pg/ml for norfentanyl in urine and 5 pg/ml for fentanyl and norfentanyl in whole blood this UFLC-MS/MS method has clearly superior sensitivity. CONCLUSION Considering the high sensitivity, this UFLC-MS/MS method is highly appropriate for the analysis of fentanyl and norfentanyl in forensic urine and blood samples. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A {{leaching}} {{technology on}} samples of Algerian quartz sand deposit {{has been investigated}} {{in order to obtain}} high-purity silica (SiO 2) as raw material intended for photovoltaic application. The enrichment process was carried out by using double acid percolation leaching method (HF and HCl) for reducing the iron rate in the final product and also to decrease the final duration of the used process. In the aim to remove residual iron content from the ore surface, the leaching process was followed by an <b>alkaline</b> <b>washing</b> using NaOH and gravimetric separation. A characterization study has been carried out to establish the location, the quantity of the iron and others impurities on the ore: 850 ppm was the maximum iron contamination, whereas after the application of this technology, final iron content 96 ppm (as Fe) has been obtained. A schematic flowsheet of the process has been proposed considering the obtained experimental results and the results obtained in the literature. The experimental results have shown the technical feasibility of this process for high-purity silica sands production intended for photovoltaic area. 1...|$|R
40|$|Summary Archaeological {{wrought iron}} {{artefacts}} {{are subject to}} damaging corrosion while in the burial environment and when subjected to environmental changes after excavation. The role of water, oxygen, and chloride corrosion accelerators are central to iron corrosion processes. Intrinsic {{factors such as the}} amount and distribution of slag in wrought iron may also play a role in corrosion processes. This study examined a range of factors that impact on understanding conservation desalination treatments to mitigate corrosion by removing chlorides. While examining the effect of slag on corrosion rate and chloride content formed the core of this project, cracking morphologies within corrosion product layers and their influence on corrosion rates measured by oxygen consumption produced outcomes of interest for designing the practicalities of treatment procedures. The slag content of the wrought iron objects examined in this study did not correlate with either their corrosion rate or their chloride content. In line with other authors, clustering of chloride around slag inclusions was identified. This confirmed slag does act as a focus for developing corrosion centres, which will offer challenges for chloride removal and hence provide opportunity for post-treatment corrosion. The <b>alkaline</b> sulphite <b>washing</b> applied to the iron nails produced results that aligned with those reported in other studies and confirmed its relative efficiency for removing chloride. Of major relevance to conservators designing <b>alkaline</b> <b>washing</b> techniques is assigning treatment time and specifying treatment environment. These decisions are aided by evidence provided in this study, which showed that immersing the chloride ii containing corrosion product β-FeOOH in alkaline sulphite entirely transformed it to other iron oxides in only 30 days. During this process it will release its chloride, which will be available for diffusion into the wash solution making a more complete desalination process possible...|$|R
3000|$|The washcloths {{have been}} dyed at two {{different}} colour intensities as the initial dark colouration not only appeared too strongly coloured but also consumed significantly larger amounts of dyes {{relative to the}} more weakly coloured (and thus more economical) washcloth (Fig.  2). Accordingly, two indicator washcloths IW 1 and IW 2 were coloured with a higher amount of both indicator and reference dye (IW 2 was used for repeated laundry testing), while two indicator washcloths were coloured with half of indicator and inert dye, i.e. IW 3 (which has colouration on {{only part of the}} washcloth) and IW 4 that is fully coloured. Both types were evaluated in more detail; the strongly coloured washcloth IW 2 has been repeatedly washed under conventional laundry conditions i.e. 30 times at 40  °C and 50 times at 60  °C using an <b>alkaline</b> <b>washing</b> agent. Furthermore, washcloths IW 1, IW 2 and IW 4 have been evaluated at different temperatures to find out whether or not changes in temperature would affect the sensitive measurement range.

40|$|Highly {{alkaline}} {{radioactive waste}} tanks contain {{a number of}} transuranic species, in particular U, Np, Pu, and Am-the exact forms of which are currently unknown. Knowledge of actinide speciation under highly alkaline conditions is essential towards understanding and predicting their solubility and sorption behavior in tanks, determining whether chemical separations are needed for waste treatment, and designing separations processes. Baseline washing of tank sludges with NaOH solutions is being proposed to reduce the volume of HLW. Alkaline pretreatment of HLW {{will be needed to}} remove aluminum [as NaAl(OH) 4] because it significantly reduces the HLW volume; however, the aluminate ion [Al(OH) 4 -] enhances actinide solubility via an unknown mechanism. Thus, <b>alkaline</b> <b>wash</b> residues may require an additional treatment to remove actinides. The results of this research will determine the nature TRU (U, Np, Pu, Am) speciation with aluminate anions under alkaline, oxidizing tank-like conditions. Specific issues to be addressed include solubility of these actinides, speciation in aluminate-containing alkaline supernatants, the role of actinide redox states on solubility, and partitioning between supernatant and solid phases, including colloids. Studies will include thermodynamics, kinetics, spectroscopy, electrochemistry, and surface science. We have already determined, for example, that certain high valent forms of Np and Pu are very soluble under alkaline conditions due to the formation of anionic hydroxo complexes, AnO 2 (OH) 4 2 - and AnO 2 (OH) 5 3 -. The presence of aluminate ions causes the actinide solubilities to increase, although the exact species are not known. We are currently characterizing the high valent TRU elements bound to oxo, water, OH-, and Al(OH) 4 -, ligands under waste-like conditions. These waste-like conditions are in the range of 1 - 3 M excess hydroxide, {approx} 0. 2 M carbonate, {approx} 0. 5 M aluminate, for a total sodium of 2 - 4 M. Molecular structure-specific probes include Raman, multinuclear nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), luminescence, optical absorption (UV-Vis-conventional and photoacoustic) spectroscopies. We anticipate that such new knowledge will impact on clean-up approaches to significantly reduce costs, schedules, and risks. Research Progress and Implications: In the first one and one half years of the project we have determined the true role of aluminate [Al(OH) 4 -] anions in enhancing solubility of actinide ions. Last year we reported preliminary spectroscopic observations of a new actinide chemical species in the presence of aluminate anions under alkaline, waste tank-like conditions. We postulated that the aluminate anion acted as a ligand to uranium, and that the new compound was an actinide-aluminate coordination complex of high negative charge. More detailed studies aimed at identification of this new species revealed that it is actually a new dimeric uranyl species, and that there is no aluminate anion in the metal coordination sphere. Rather, the data indicate that the aluminate acts as an electrolyte, and increases the hydroxide ion activity and hence the overall solubility via formation of UO 2 (OH) 5 3 -. In general, highly charged species are stabilized by high ionic strength. This will have a direct impact on sludge washing using NaOH to remove aluminate ions from the system. Changes in the aluminate concentration effect the position of the equilibrium outlined below. Furthermore, we also find changes in aluminum chemistry based on the presence of uranium, including aluminate precipitation reactions under conditions where the aluminate anions should be solubilized...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{present study}} is contributed to the removal of excess {{fluoride}} in drinking water using cerium dispersed in carbon (CeDC), a hybrid sorbent which was prepared by carbonization of ammonium cerium sulfate impregnated starch. One synthesized CeDC sample with a specific surface area of 685 cm(2) g(- 1), was investigated for its fluoride scavenging ability as the function of pH, fluoride concentration, temperature, co-ions and adsorbent dosage. The verification of various kinetic models viz., Pseudo I, II order; Ritchie II order; Intra-particle diffusion and Elovich gave acceptable results. The isotherm models viz., Langmuir, Freundlich, Temkin and Generalized Langmuir were also checked with the fluoride sorption process. The Langmuir sorption capacity (q(m)) {{was found to be}} 209 mg g(- 1) with a high R-L value of 0. 699. The maximum fluoride uptake capacity of CeDC was determined to be 52 mg g(- 1) at a pH value of 8. 07. The FTIR, SEM and XRD characterization studies were carried out for CeDC material. The successful regeneration of spent CeDC was performed by an <b>alkaline</b> <b>washing</b> followed by an acidic activation. This regeneration allows the use of CeDC in a cost-effective removal of fluoride anions in drinking water. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|A first {{important}} {{requirement for}} textile use of azo dyes {{is that no}} possible products of their reductive cleavage are listed by the EU Directive 2002 / 61 /EC. This requirement was met by the dyes used in this study. Furthermore, the strongly coloured washcloth IW 1 was certified according to OekoTex 100 product class 1 (contact with babies). The washcloth conformed to the requirements {{in terms of the}} absence of formaldehyde, the specifications concerning disperse azo dyes, heavy metal ions, halogenated phenols, tin organic compounds, surfactants, as well as rub fastness, fastness to perspiration and resistance to spittle. However, the pH of the washcloth (pH 9 of the aqueous extract) was higher than regulated by ISO 3071 (i.e. between 4.0 and 7.5). It was realised that the washing machine used for cleaning the washcloth was not rinsing textiles properly so that some small amount of <b>alkaline</b> <b>washing</b> agent was still present in the tested washcloth, causing an elevated pH. This fact was also visible from the colour of the washcloth which was partially orange-red, especially at its thick corners. Therefore, the weakly coloured washcloth IW 4, prior to its certification, was rinsed twice by hand with tap water after washing with the laundry machine. Following this, the pH was found to be 6.6 and the washcloth fully conformed to the specifications for OekoTex 100 product class 1.|$|R
40|$|The white-light {{phosphors}} {{consisting of}} Dy 3 + doped YPO 4 and Dy 3 + doped YP 1 -XVXO 4 were {{prepared by the}} chemical coprecipitation method. After the 1200 °C thermal treatment in the air atmosphere, the white-light phosphors with particle sizes around 90 [*]nm can be obtained. In {{order to reduce the}} average particle size of phosphors, the <b>alkaline</b> <b>washing</b> method was applied to the original synthesis process, which reduces the particle sizes to 65 [*]nm. From the PLE spectra, four absorption peaks locating at 325, 352, 366, and 390 [*]nm can be observed in the YPO 4 -based phosphors. These peaks appear due to the following electron transitions: 6 H 15 / 2 → 4 K 15 / 2, 6 H 15 / 2 → 4 M 15 / 2 + 6 P 7 / 2, 6 H 15 / 2 → 4 I 11 / 2, and 6 H 15 / 2 → 4 M 19 / 2. Besides, the emission peaks of wavelengths 484 [*]nm and 576 [*]nm can be observed in the PL spectra. In order to obtain the white-light phosphors, the vanadium ions were applied to substitute the phosphorus ions to compose the YP 1 -XVXO 4 phosphors. From the PL spectra, the strongest PL intensity can be obtained with 30 % vanadium ions. As the concentration of vanadium ions increases to 40 %, the phosphors with the CIE coordinates locating at the white-light area can be obtained...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that microtubule-based {{organelle}} transport requires a membrane receptor but no kinesin-binding membrane proteins have been isolated. Chick embryo brain microsomes have kinesin bound to their surface, and after detergent solubilization, a matrix with an antibody to the kinesin head domain (SUK- 4) (Ingold et al., 1988) bound the solubilized kinesin and retained an equal amount of a microsome protein of 160 -kD. Similarly, velocity sedimentation of solubilized membranes showed that kinesin and the 160 -kD polypeptide cosedimented at 13 S. After alkaline treatment to remove kinesin from the microsomes, the same 160 -kD polypeptide doublet bound to a kinesin affinity resin and not to other proteins tested. Biochemical characterization localized this protein to the cytoplasmic face of brain microsomes and indicated that it was an integral membrane protein since it was resistant to <b>alkaline</b> <b>washing.</b> mAbs raised to chick 160 -kD protein demonstrated that it was absent in the supernatant and concentrated in the dense microsome fraction. The dense microsome fraction also had the greatest amount of microtubule-dependent motility. With immunofluorescence, the antibodies labeled the ER in chick embryo fibroblasts (similar to the pattern of bound kinesin staining in the same cells) (Hollenbeck, P. J. 1989. J. Cell Biol. 108 : 2335 - 2342), astroglia, Schwann cells and dorsal root ganglion cells but staining was much less in the Golgi regions of these cells. Because this protein is a major kinesin-binding protein of motile vesicles and would be expected to bind kinesin to the organelle membrane, we have chosen the name, kinectin, for this protein...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} of cellulase recycling in {{the scope of}} bioethanol production from recycled paper sludge (RPS), an inexpensive byproduct with around 39 % of carbohydrates, is analyzed. RPS was easily converted and fermented by enzymes and cells, respectively. Final enzyme partition between solid and liquid phases was investigated, the solid-bound enzymes being efficiently recovered by <b>alkaline</b> <b>washing.</b> RPS hydrolysis and fermentation was conducted over four rounds, recycling the cellulases present in both fractions. A great overall enzyme stability was observed: 71, 64 and 100 % of the initial Cel 7 A, Cel 7 B and -glucosidase activities, respectively, were recovered. Even with only 30 % of fresh enzymes added on the subsequent rounds, solid conversions of 92, 83 and 71 % were achieved for the round 2, 3 and 4, respectively. This strategy enabled an enzyme saving around 53 - 60 %, while can equally contribute to a 40 % reduction in RPS disposal costs.
