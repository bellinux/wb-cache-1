5|$|The {{identity}} of the <b>anticoagulant</b> substance in spoiled sweet clover remained a mystery until 1940. In 1933 Karl Paul Link and his lab of chemists working at the University of Wisconsin set out to isolate and characterize the haemorrhagic agent from the spoiled hay. It took five years for Link's student Harold A. Campbell to recover 6mg of crystalline <b>anticoagulant.</b> Next, Link's student Mark A. Stahmann took over the project and initiated a large-scale extraction, isolating 1.8 g of recrystallized <b>anticoagulant</b> in about 4 months. This was enough material for Stahmann and Charles F. Huebner to check their results against Campbell's and to thoroughly characterize the compound. Through degradation experiments they established that the <b>anticoagulant</b> was 3,3'-methylenebis-(4-hydroxycoumarin), which they later named dicoumarol. They confirmed their results by synthesizing dicoumarol and proving in 1940 that it was identical to the naturally occurring agent.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, a study {{conducted}} by , UC Davis, US Forest Service, and the Hoopa Tribe showed that fishers in California were exposed to and killed by <b>anticoagulant</b> rodenticides associated with marijuana cultivation. In this study, 79% of fishers that were tested in California were exposed to an average of 1.61 different <b>anticoagulant</b> rodenticides and four fishers died directly attributed to these toxicants. A 2015 follow-up study building on this data determined that the trend of exposure and mortality from these toxicants increased to 85%, that California fishers were now exposed to an average of 1.73 different <b>anticoagulant</b> rodenticides, and that nine more fishers died, bringing the total to 13. The extent of marijuana cultivation within fishers' home ranges was highlighted in a 2013 study focusing on fisher survival and impacts from marijuana cultivation within the Sierra National Forest. Research showed that fishers had an average of 5.3 individual grow sites within their home range. One fisher had 16 individual grow sites within its territory.|$|E

The maternal complications were as follows. Two women with mitral valve prostheses on heparin had thromboembolic episodes. Four women on oral <b>anticoagulants</b> died and 11 developed haemorrhage or systemic embolism. Two of the deaths were caused by bacterial endocarditis, one was the result of obstruction of a mitral valve prosthesis, and one was due to haemorrhage.

5|$|For acute {{cases in}} the leg, the ACCP {{recommended}} a parenteral <b>anticoagulant</b> (such as LMWH, fondaparinux, or unfractionated heparin) {{for at least five}} days and a VKA, the oral <b>anticoagulant,</b> the same day. LMWH and fondaparinux are suggested over unfractionated heparin, but both are retained in those with compromised kidney function, unlike unfractionated heparin. The VKA is generally taken for a minimum of three months to maintain an international normalized ratio of 2.0–3.0, with 2.5 as the target. The benefit of taking a VKA declines as the duration of treatment extends, and the risk of bleeding increases with age.|$|E

40|$|For many years, <b>anticoagulants</b> {{have been}} used in the {{emergent}} treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke. <b>Anticoagulants</b> are prescribed in an effort to prevent first or recurrent stroke, especially among patients with cardioembolism due to arterial fibrillation and large-artery atherosclerotic disease. Despite the widespread use, efficacy and safety of <b>anticoagulants</b> are controversial. Experts have given a broad spectrum of opinions. Surveys of practitioners have also demonstrated a lack of consensus on the use of <b>anticoagulants</b> for ischemic stroke. The uncertainty is due, in large part, to the lack of definitive clinical data.

5|$|Given {{the fact}} that HIT predisposes {{strongly}} to new episodes of thrombosis, it {{is not sufficient to}} simply discontinue the heparin administration. Generally, an alternative <b>anticoagulant</b> is needed to suppress the thrombotic tendency while the generation of antibodies stops and the platelet count recovers. To make matters more complicated, the other most commonly used <b>anticoagulant,</b> warfarin, should not be used in HIT until the platelet count is at least 150 x 10^9/L because there is a very high risk of warfarin necrosis in people with HIT who have low platelet counts. Warfarin necrosis is the development of skin gangrene in those receiving warfarin or a similar vitamin K inhibitor. If the patient was receiving warfarin at the time when HIT is diagnosed, the activity of warfarin is reversed with vitamin K. Transfusing platelets is discouraged, as there is a theoretical risk that this may worsen the risk of thrombosis; the platelet count is rarely low enough to be the principal cause of significant hemorrhage.|$|E

40|$|International audienceElderly people {{represent}} a patient population at high thromboembolic risk, {{but also at}} high hemorrhagic risk. There is a general tendency among physicians to underuse <b>anticoagulants</b> in the elderly, probably both because of underestimation of thromboembolic risk and overestimation of bleeding risk. The main indications for anticoagulation are venous thromboembolism (VTE) prophylaxis in medical and surgical settings, VTE treatment, atrial fibrillation (AF) and valvular heart disease. Available <b>anticoagulants</b> for VTE prophylaxis and initial treatment of VTE are low molecular weight heparins (LMWH), unfractionated heparin (UFH) or synthetic anti-factor Xa pentasaccharide fondaparinux. For long-term anticoagulation vitamin K antagonists (VKA) are the first choice and only available oral <b>anticoagulants</b> nowadays. Assessing the benefit-risk ratio of anticoagulation {{is one of the}} most challenging issues in the individual elderly patient, patients at highest hemorrhagic risk often being those who would have the greatest benefit from <b>anticoagulants.</b> Some specific considerations are of utmost importance when using <b>anticoagulants</b> in the elderly to maximize safety of these treatments, including decreased renal function, co-morbidities and risk of falls, altered pharmacodynamics of <b>anticoagulants</b> especially VKAs, association with antiplatelet agents, patient education.

5|$|Warfarin {{consists}} of a racemic mixture of two active enantiomers—R- and S- forms—each of which is cleared by different pathways.

Both the enantiomers of warfarin undergo CYP-mediated metabolism by many different CYPs to form 3',4',6,7,8 and 10-hydroxy warfarin metabolites, major being 7-OH warfarin formed from S-warfarin by CYP2C9 and 10-OH warfarin from R-warfarin by CYP3A4.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin, {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Coumadin among others, is a {{medication}} that is used as an <b>anticoagulant</b> (blood thinner).

40|$|The {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} heparin and low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) are well documented in venous and arterial thromboembolism. Several drawbacks of heparins have inspired the development of newer parenteral <b>anticoagulants</b> for specific indications, including heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). The direct thrombin inhibitors recombinant hirudin and argatroban are now established alternatives for HIT patients, and bivalirudin {{is one of the}} most used <b>anticoagulants</b> in PCI. The pentasaccharide fondaparinux is an alternative for LMWH for thromboprophylaxis in various clinical settings and for patients with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) not scheduled for PCI. In Europe, it was recently approved for treatment of superficial vein thrombosis. Further development of new parenteral <b>anticoagulants</b> is slow and the emphasis has shifted towards development of new oral <b>anticoagulants</b> and antiplatelet drugs.

50|$|Pindone, diphacinone, and {{coumatetralyl}} are the first-generation <b>anticoagulants</b> {{most commonly}} used for pest control. They are generally very effective at controlling rats to keep their numbers low, but cannot effectively deal with sudden population surges. <b>Anticoagulants</b> break down very slowly in water and soil. They also accumulate in the liver tissue of live animals that {{have been exposed to}} the poison (either by eating bait or feeding on an animal that has eaten bait) and in carcasses. They are also the most inhumane of the poisons currently used.

5|$|When {{initiating}} warfarin therapy ("warfarinization"), {{the doctor}} will decide how strong the <b>anticoagulant</b> therapy needs to be. The target INR {{level varies from}} case to case depending on the clinical indicators, but tends to be 2–3 in most conditions.

5|$|A few species, {{specifically}} the common, white-winged, and hairy-legged vampire bats, exclusively consume animal blood (hematophagy). The common vampire bat typically feeds on large mammals such as cattle, while the hairy-legged and white-winged vampires feed on birds instead. Vampire bats target sleeping prey and can detect deep breathing. Heat sensors {{in the nose}} help them to detect blood vessels near {{the surface of the}} skin. They pierce the animal's skin with their teeth, biting away a small flap, and lap up the blood with their tongues, which have lateral grooves adapted to this purpose. The blood is kept from clotting by an <b>anticoagulant</b> in the saliva.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{acquired}} conditions augment {{the risk of}} thrombosis. A prominent example is antiphospholipid syndrome, which is caused by antibodies against constituents of the cell membrane, particularly lupus <b>anticoagulant</b> (first found in people with the disease systemic lupus erythematosus but often detected in people without the disease), anti-cardiolipin antibodies, and anti-β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies; it is therefore regarded as an autoimmune disease. In some cases antiphospholipid syndrome can cause arterial as well as venous thrombosis. It is also more strongly associated with miscarriage, and can cause {{a number of other}} symptoms (such as livedo reticularis of the skin and migraine).|$|E
40|$|Systemic anticoagulation with {{intravenous}} or oral <b>anticoagulants</b> and antiplatelet agents is {{an efficient}} treatment against thromboembolic or cardiovascular disease.

In case of bleeding complications local hemostatic measures, such as local surgical sutures, fibrin glue, local antifibrinolytic treatment with tranexamic acid, or e-aminocaproic acid suffice to stop bleeding. In patients with high risk of bleeding an individual assessment of the benefit/risk ratio of interrupting anticoagulation should be carried out. Bridging the long-term anticoagulation with short-term <b>anticoagulants</b> should be planned according to national or international guidelines.
