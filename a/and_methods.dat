40|$|Four {{types of}} {{matrices}} of expectations which serve as targets in Procrustes rotation are presented and investigated. These types were matrices with trait expectations, matrices with trait <b>and</b> <b>method</b> expectations, matrices with trait <b>and</b> <b>method</b> expecta-tions which {{are independent of}} each other and matrices with trait <b>and</b> <b>method</b> expec-tations which are adjusted and independent of each other. All the matrices with trait <b>and</b> <b>method</b> expectations are expected to separate trait influences from method influ-ences. Procrustes rotation with these matrices as target was applied to multitrait-multimethod matrices. The results demonstrate that trait expectations are not always sufficient for the identification of trait influences. The additional consideration of method expectations improved the results. The matrix with trait <b>and</b> <b>method</b> expecta-tions as target led to the best results...|$|R
