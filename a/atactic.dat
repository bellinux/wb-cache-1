25|$|When the methyl {{groups in}} a {{polypropylene}} chain exhibit no preferred orientation, the polymers are called <b>atactic.</b> <b>Atactic</b> polypropylene is an amorphous rubbery material.

25|$|Most {{commercial}} polypropylene is isotactic and has {{an intermediate}} level of crystallinity between that of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Isotactic & <b>atactic</b> polypropylene is soluble in P-xylene at 140°C. Isotactic precipitates when the solution is cooled to 25°C and <b>atactic</b> portion remains soluble in P-xylene.|$|E
25|$|Tacticity {{describes}} the relative stereochemistry of chiral centers in neighboring structural units within a macromolecule.

25|$|Hydrocarbon slurry or suspension: Uses {{a liquid}} inert {{hydrocarbon}} diluent in the reactor to facilitate transfer of propylene to the catalyst, {{the removal of}} heat from the system, the deactivation/removal of the catalyst as well as dissolving the <b>atactic</b> polymer.

25|$|Polypropylene is in {{many aspects}} similar to polyethylene, {{especially}} in solution behaviour and electrical properties. The additionally present methyl group improves mechanical properties and thermal resistance, while the chemical resistance decreases. The properties of polypropylene depend on the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution, crystallinity, type and proportion of comonomer (if used) and the isotacticity. In isotactic polypropylene, for example, the CH3 groups are oriented {{on one side of}} the carbon backbone. This creates a greater degree of crystallinity and results in a stiffer material that is more resistant to creep than both <b>atactic</b> polypropylene and polyethylene.|$|E
25|$|In physics, the {{standard}} {{definition of a}} glass (or vitreous solid) is a solid formed by rapid melt quenching, although the term glass {{is often used to}} describe any amorphous solid that exhibits a glass transition temperature Tg. For melt quenching, if the cooling is sufficiently rapid (relative to the characteristic crystallization time) then crystallization is prevented and instead the disordered atomic configuration of the supercooled liquid is frozen into the solid state at Tg. The tendency for a material to form a glass while quenched is called glass-forming ability. This ability can be predicted by the rigidity theory. Generally, a glass exists in a structurally metastable state with respect to its crystalline form, although in certain circumstances, for example in <b>atactic</b> polymers, there is no crystalline analogue of the amorphous phase.|$|E

2500|$|The only commercially {{important}} form of polystyrene is <b>atactic,</b> {{in which}} the phenyl groups are randomly distributed {{on both sides of}} the polymer chain. This random positioning prevents the chains from aligning with sufficient regularity to achieve any crystallinity. The plastic has a glass transition temperature Tg of ~90°C.

2500|$|The {{melting point}} of {{polypropylene}} occurs at a range, so a {{melting point is}} determined by finding the highest temperature of a differential scanning calorimetry chart.

2500|$|The {{polymers}} are linear and are strong. The monomers {{are mainly}} arranged head-to-tail, meaning {{that there are}} chlorides on alternating carbon centres. PVC has mainly an <b>atactic</b> stereochemistry, {{which means that the}} relative stereochemistry of the chloride centres are random. [...] Some degree of syndiotacticity of the chain gives a few percent crystallinity that is influential on the properties of the material. [...] About 57% of the mass of PVC is chlorine. The presence of chloride groups gives the polymer very different properties from the structurally related material polyethylene.|$|E
2500|$|The glass {{transition}} temperature (Tg) of <b>atactic</b> PMMA is [...] [...] The Tg values of commercial grades of PMMA range from the range is so wide because of the vast number of commercial compositions which are copolymers with co-monomers other than methyl methacrylate. [...] PMMA is thus an organic glass at room temperature; i.e., it is below its Tg. [...] The forming temperature starts at the {{glass transition}} temperature and goes up from there. [...] All common molding processes may be used, including injection molding, compression molding, and extrusion. [...] The highest quality PMMA sheets are produced by cell casting, but in this case, the polymerization and molding steps occur concurrently. [...] The strength of the material is higher than molding grades owing to its extremely high molecular mass. [...] Rubber toughening {{has been used to}} increase the toughness of PMMA owing to its brittle behavior in response to applied loads.|$|E
50|$|<b>Atactic</b> {{polymers}} are technologically very important. A {{good example}} is polystyrene (PS). If a special catalyst is used in its synthesis {{it is possible to}} obtain the syndiotactic version of this polymer, but most industrial polystyrene produced is <b>atactic.</b> The two materials have very different properties because the irregular structure of the <b>atactic</b> version makes it impossible for the polymer chains to stack in a regular fashion. The result is that, whereas syndiotactic PS is a semicrystalline material, the more common <b>atactic</b> version cannot crystallize and forms a glass instead. This example is quite general in that many polymers of economic importance are <b>atactic</b> glass formers.|$|E
50|$|Polymers {{that are}} formed by free-radical {{mechanisms}} such as polyvinyl chloride are usually <b>atactic.</b> Due to their random nature <b>atactic</b> polymers are usually amorphous. In hemi isotactic macromolecules every other repeat unit has a random substituent.|$|E

50|$|Whether or not {{polymers}} can crystallize {{depends on}} their molecular structure - presence of straight chains with regularly spaced side groups facilitates crystallization.

50|$|Natta {{first used}} {{polymerization}} catalysts based on titanium chlorides to polymerize propylene and other 1-alkenes. He discovered that these polymers are crystalline materials and ascribed their crystallinity {{to a special}} feature of the polymer structure called stereoregularity. The concept of stereoregularity in polymer chains is illustrated in {{the picture on the}} left with polypropylene. Stereoregular poly(1-alkene) can be isotactic or syndiotactic depending on the relative orientation of the alkyl groups in polymer chains consisting of units −CH2−CHR−, like the CH3 groups in the figure. In the isotactic polymers, all stereogenic centers CHR share the same configuration. The stereogenic centers in syndiotactic polymers alternate their relative configuration. A polymer that lacks any regular arrangement in the position of its alkyl substituents (R) is called <b>atactic.</b> Both isotactic and syndiotactic polypropylene are crystalline, whereas <b>atactic</b> polypropylene, which can also be prepared with special Ziegler-Natta catalysts, is amorphous. The stereoregularity of the polymer is determined by the catalyst used to prepare it.|$|E
50|$|After he {{discovered}} the stereo control of polyisoprene, {{he discovered}} the polymerization and stereo control of butadiene {{as well as many}} other alkylbutadienes. The polymerization of butadiene can lead to three basic structures: the cis-1,4- and the trans-1,4-polybutadienes, and the 1,2-polybutadiene with a vinyl side group. From these three basic structures, there are five structurally different polymers: the cis and trans 1,4-polybutadienes, and the isotactic, syndiotactic, and <b>atactic</b> 1,2-polybutadienes. All of these polymers have been isolated in pure form.|$|E
50|$|The {{melting point}} of {{polypropylene}} occurs at a range, so a {{melting point is}} determined by finding the highest temperature of a differential scanning calorimetry chart. Perfectly isotactic PP has a melting point of 171 C. Commercial isotactic PP has a melting point that ranges from 160 to 166 C, depending on <b>atactic</b> material and crystallinity. Syndiotactic PP with a crystallinity of 30% has a melting point of 130 C. Below 0 °C, PP becomes brittle.|$|E
50|$|Crystalline {{polymers}} {{are usually}} opaque because of light scattering on the numerous boundaries between the crystalline and amorphous regions. The density of such boundaries is lower {{and thus the}} transparency is higher either for low (amorphous polymer) or high (crystalline) degree of crystallinity. For example, <b>atactic</b> polypropylene is usually amorphous and transparent while syndiotactic polypropylene, which has crystallinity ~50%, is opaque. Crystallinity also affects dyeing of polymers: crystalline polymers {{are more difficult to}} stain than amorphous ones because the dye molecules penetrate much easier through amorphous regions.|$|E
