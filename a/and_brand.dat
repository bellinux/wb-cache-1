40|$|Abstract: This paper {{seeks to}} {{elucidate}} the geographies of <b>brands</b> <b>and</b> <b>branding</b> through interpreting their geographical entanglements. Focusing upon goods and services, it argues, fi rst, {{that the object}} of the <b>brand</b> <b>and</b> the process of branding are geographical because they are entangled in inescapable spatial associations. Second, these spatial associations matter because they are geographically differentiated and uneven. Third, geographically entangled <b>brands</b> <b>and</b> <b>branding</b> are closely related to spatially uneven development through the articulation and reinforcement of economic and social inequalities and unequal and competitive sociospatial relations and divisions of labour. Despite their apparent pervasiveness and signifi cance for geographical inquiry, the geographical entanglements of <b>brands</b> <b>and</b> <b>branding</b> have been under-investigated in Geography and hardly recognized and poorly specifi ed in other social science research. A critical account is provided that demonstrates the entangled geographies of <b>brands</b> <b>and</b> <b>branding</b> in their: (1) geographical origins, provenance and sociospatial histories; (2) spatial circuits of value and meaning and uneven development; and (3) territorial and relational spaces and places. Reading the changing forms, extent and nature of the geographical entanglements of <b>brands</b> <b>and</b> <b>branding</b> provides a novel but relatively overlooked window to consider and illustrate the vital spaces at the intersections of economic, social, cultural and political geographies, the tensions between relational and territorial notions of space and place and the politics <b>and</b> limits of <b>brands</b> <b>and</b> <b>branding.</b> Learning from wider social science, the paper demonstrates the importance of geography by projecting more clearly specifi ed and sophisticated treatments of space and place into accounts of <b>brands</b> <b>and</b> <b>branding...</b>|$|R
5|$|In market <b>and</b> <b>brand</b> focused companies, design {{management}} focuses mainly on brand {{design management}}, including corporate brand management and product brand management.

5|$|Angel of Darkness was {{received}} poorly, prompting Eidos—fearing financial troubles from another unsuccessful game—to give development duties for future titles to Crystal Dynamics, another Eidos subsidiary. The Legacy of Kain development team {{began work on}} a new title (Tomb Raider: Legend), and Toby Gard returned {{to work as a}} consultant. The development team reassessed the brand value of the franchise and its protagonist. Chip Blundell, Eidos's vice-president of brand management, commented that the designers understood that fans saw the character <b>and</b> <b>brand</b> as their own, rather than Eidos's. With that in mind, the team retooled the franchise and character to emphasise aspects of the original game that made them unique. The storyline intended for a trilogy of games that started with Angel of Darkness was abandoned and a new plot was created for Legend.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} competitive pricing strategies of apparel <b>brands</b> <b>and</b> retailers. Design/methodology/approach – The paper begins with a broad discussion of competition by examining Porter’s five forces model, and narrows by examining price competition within price tiers in the retail apparel industry according to store format <b>and</b> <b>brands.</b> Included are case studies of apparel retailers <b>and</b> <b>brands</b> incorporating concepts of pricing strategies, <b>brand</b> positioning, <b>and</b> price competition, with a focus on retail channel relationships. The paper analyzes the impact of price competition on apparel retailers <b>and</b> <b>brands,</b> <b>and</b> further examines price tiers as a competitive strategy. Findings – The study reveals that the concept of price tiers is applicable to apparel retailers <b>and</b> <b>brands.</b> Price tiering is a vehicle for market positioning for the retail apparel industry. Retailers are enacting a price tier strategy by branding their retail store formats or engaging store brands as a vehicle of differentiation for a tier. Retailers <b>and</b> <b>brands</b> can be successful with a price tier strategy, unless they fail to differentiate between tiers on factors other than on price alone. Research limitations/implications – The lack of relevant price competition literature, relating to the retailer apparel industry, forced the exploration of price competition literature from grocery and automotive sectors. Originality/value – The paper provides useful information on the impact of price competition on apparel retailers <b>and</b> <b>brands,</b> <b>and</b> also price tiers as a competitive strategy...|$|R

5|$|Beyoncé and {{her mother}} {{introduced}} House of Deréon, a contemporary women's fashion line, in 2005.

According to Tina, the overall style of the line best reflects her and Beyoncé's taste and style. Beyoncé {{and her mother}} founded their family's company Beyond Productions, which provides the licensing <b>and</b> <b>brand</b> management for House of Deréon, and its junior collection, Deréon.

5|$|Design plays a {{vital role}} in product <b>and</b> <b>brand</b> development, and is of great {{economic}} importance for organisations and companies. Creativity and design in particular (as an activity: design skills, methods and processes) play a growing role in creating products and services with high added value to consumers. Design generates 50% of world export revenue in the creative industries' products (goods and services). The creative industry workforce is 3.1% of total employment in the European Union (EU), which creates a revenue that is 2.6% of the EU gross value. Creative industries have attained an unprecedented average annual growth rate of 8.7 per cent across the EU between 2000 and 2005.|$|E
40|$|The present work {{describes}} {{about the}} {{comparative study of}} percentage purity and cost of some generic <b>and</b> <b>branded</b> marketed tablets of different categories like Anti-diabetic, Diuretic, Anti-pyretic and Vitamin B formulations. Branded formulations are at high cost, so that the poor can’t afford them. Therapeutic efficacy of Generics is almost identical to that of branded drugs. But {{one of the major}} differences is Generics are 80 % cheaper on average when compared to branded drugs. In fact FDA estimates that 50 % of generic drug production is by brand-name companies. So the consumption of generic <b>and</b> <b>branded</b> medicines depends on this un-popularized fact. Therefore the generic drugs of various pharmaceutical companies are sold at low cost. The present study is about comparison of Percentage purity and cost of the different generics <b>and</b> <b>branded</b> formulations. Our experimental results of generic <b>and</b> <b>branded</b> tablets were compared by statistical analysis which gave an important conclusion that the percentage purity of both generic <b>and</b> <b>branded</b> drugs are similar whereas the cost of branded drugs is more.

The Jewish Agency <b>and</b> <b>Brand</b> wanted the Allies to string the Germans {{along in the}} hope of slowing the deportations. The Agency gave Brand a document, dated 29 May 1944, that offered $400,000 for every 1,000 Jewish emigrants to Palestine, one million Swiss francs per 10,000 Jewish emigrants to neutral countries such as Spain, and 10,000 Swiss francs a month if the deportations were to stop. If the SS would allow the Allies to supply food, clothes and medicine to the Jews in concentration camps, the Nazis would be supplied with the same.

5|$|Market <b>and</b> <b>brand</b> focused {{organizations}} {{are concerned with}} the expression and perception of the corporate brand. Corporate design management implements, develops, and maintains the corporate identity, or brand.

The design program plays the role of a quality program within many fields of the organization to achieve uniform internal branding. It is strongly linked to strategy, corporate culture, product development, marketing, organizational structure, and technological development. Achieving a consistent corporate brand requires the involvement of designers and a widespread design awareness among employees. A creative culture, knowledge sharing processes, determination, design leadership, and good work relations support the work of corporate brand management.|$|E
