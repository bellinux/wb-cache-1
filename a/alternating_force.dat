25|$|In {{a dynamic}} sense, the {{response}} of a gel to an <b>alternating</b> <b>force</b> (oscillation or vibration) will depend upon the period or frequency of vibration. As indicated here, even most simple liquids will exhibit some elastic response at shear rates or frequencies exceeding 5 x 106 cycles per second. Experiments on such short time scales probe the fundamental motions of the primary particles (or particle clusters) which constitute the lattice structure or aggregate. The increasing resistance of certain liquids to flow at high stirring speeds is one manifestation of this phenomenon. The ability of a condensed body {{to respond to a}} mechanical force by viscous flow is thus strongly dependent on the time scale over which the load is applied, and thus the frequency and amplitude of the stress wave in oscillatory experiments.|$|E

The lift coefficient {{and the frequency}} of the <b>alternating</b> <b>force</b> have been determined. For smooth cylinders, the lift coefficients were found to depend on both the Reynolds and the Keuglegen-Carpenter numbers for Reynolds numbers between about 20, 000 and 150, 000. For rough cylinders, the lift coefficients were found to be independent of the Reynolds number within the range of relative roughnesses and Reynolds numbers tested. The results have also shown that the lift coefficients for smooth cylinders at low Reynolds numbers are nearly identical with those obtained for rough cylinders at very high Reynolds numbers at the corresponding amplitude ratios. For both rough and smooth cylinders, the transverse force is a significant fraction of the in-line force and must be taken into consideration in the design of structures. It is recommended that the experiments be extended to the self-excited hydro-elastic oscillations of cylinders in harmonic flows. [URL] United States Nav...|$|E

40|$|The role of verbalized {{rules in}} {{adaptation}} to learning contingencies {{is not well}} understood. Rules often facilitate behavioral contingency adaptation, but the opposite is also seen. The present research, using human student subjects, investigated the role of rules in behavioral adaptation to two alternating and independent contingencies, one instructed left/right position contingency, the other a noninstructed force of pressing con-tingency. The position contingency was arranged as easy to facilitate formulation of a functional rule, or as difficult to make a functional rule hard to verbalize. Under the easy position contingency, subjects demonstrated reliable adaptation, but sensitivity to the <b>alternating</b> <b>force</b> contingency was poor. Under the difficult position contingency, however, reliable sensitivity to both the position and the force contingencies was observed. A third group receiving the simple and difficult position contingencies demonstrated behavioral sensitivity to the simple contingency but insensitivity to the difficult contingency. These results indicate that given multiple contingencies, behavioral sensitivity to a target schedule component is reduced if responding is highly func-tional under another schedule component in the situation, and is increased if responding under the other component is less functional.

We investigated the neural correlates of scaling of force and time {{in the production of}} rhythmic motor sequences using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the human brain. Participants (N = 13) were imaged while squeezing a rigid force transducer in a near isometric manner between thumb and index finger, to reproduce four different rhythmic sequences. The responses were separated by either equal (600 ms) or alternating (400, 800 ms) intervals, and produced with either equal (12 N) or alternating (8, 16 N) forces pulses. Intervals and force levels were balanced across each condition. The primary motor cortex (M 1), supplementary motor area (SMA), basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellum were activated during the production of sequences marked by equal interval and force.

This system simulates a row of atoms in the (1 1 1) direction of a III-V semiconductor. Specific calculations have been carried out for GaN, because it has a large gap between acoustic and optical branches. We study small-amplitude atom vibrations (up to 0. 4 Angstrom), accessible to experimental detection, in order to legitimize the expansion of the full potential to include cubic and quartic terms. We consider then nearest-neighbour interactions through harmonic as well as cubic and quartic anharmonic interactions to study the interplay between cubic and quartic terms in the frequencies of the localized modes. The force constants were determined empirically by fitting the longitudinal branches in the Gamma-L direction of GaN. We have studied both gap and surface intrinsic localized modes. Zinc-blende-structure chains are of particular interest, because the lack of inversion symmetry prevents the classification of the modes as even or odd parity. Nevertheless, modes were found that closely resemble the even- or odd-parity modes of an NaCl-structure chain. Their frequencies lie inside the gap for GaN. The absence of inversion symmetry permits a variety of surface modes to exist, depending on whether the bond at the surface is strong or weak and the atom at the surface is light or heavy.
