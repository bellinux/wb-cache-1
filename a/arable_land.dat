5|$|The tobacco {{industry}} in North Korea is substantial, with 53,000 hectares (2.3 {{percent of its}} <b>arable</b> <b>land)</b> dedicated to tobacco cultivation. This is the fourth-highest percentage of <b>arable</b> <b>land</b> dedicated to tobacco in the world, with the annual output exceeding 80,000 tonnes, making North Korea {{one of the top}} 25 tobacco worldwide producers. This is despite 31% of North Koreans being malnourished. The best, strongest and most expensive tobacco comes from the north of the country near the border with China.|$|E
5|$|As the Ottoman Empire {{proposed}} international mediation, Cuza {{took the}} initiative, and, on October 23, 1863, deposed the Kretzulescu cabinet, nominating instead his own selection of men: Kogălniceanu as Premier and Interior Minister, Dimitrie Bolintineanu as Minister of Religious Affairs. In {{order to prevent}} further international tensions, they decided to generalize confiscation to all Eastern Orthodox Church estates, Greek {{as well as those}} of the incipient Romanian Orthodox monasteries. The resolution was passed with 97 out of 100 parliamentary votes. Later, the Greek Church was presented with an offer of 150 million piasters as compensation, which was viewed as two low by its intended recipients, including Patriarch Sophoronius III. Consequently, the Romanian state considered the matter closed. As a direct consequence, one third of the <b>arable</b> <b>land</b> in Moldavia and a fourth of that in Wallachia were made available for a future land reform (one fifth to one fourth of the total <b>arable</b> <b>land</b> in the state as a whole).|$|E
5|$|The {{pedosphere}} is {{the outermost}} layer of Earth's continental surface and {{is composed of}} soil and subject to soil formation processes. The total <b>arable</b> <b>land</b> is 10.9% of the land surface, with 1.3% being permanent cropland. Close to 40% of Earth's land surface is used for cropland and pasture, or an estimated 1.3km2 of cropland and 3.4km2 of pastureland.|$|E

5|$|All three {{leaders of}} North Korea—Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il, and Kim Jong-un—have been smokers {{and the country}} has {{struggled}} to balance their public image with its anti-smoking efforts. In general, North Koreans tend to prefer strong tobacco and different classes of quality range from homegrown to sought-after foreign brands that are considered status symbols. As {{a percentage of the}} available <b>arable</b> <b>land</b> compared to consumption, the tobacco crop is over-represented in North Korean agriculture.|$|E
5|$|He {{lived in}} Hvalstad, Asker, where {{he owned a}} nine decare small farm. The {{property}} included three equal parts of garden, forest and <b>arable</b> <b>land.</b> He often cut lumber from the forest to build his own furniture. At various times, he had rabbits, sheep, cows, calves, piglets and a fish pond of brown trout at his property. According to himself, he kept the livestock largely in protest against tax authorities, while also as a hobby.|$|E

5|$|In {{order of}} area planted, the arable crops grown in Wales were: foods for stock-feeding, spring barley, wheat, maize, winter barley, other cereals for combining, oilseed rape, {{potatoes}} and other crops. The grassland was predominantly permanent pasture, with only 10% of the grassland being under five years old. Compared with {{other parts of}} the United Kingdom, Wales has the smallest percentage of <b>arable</b> <b>land</b> (6%), and a considerably smaller area of rough grazing and hill land than Scotland (27% against 62%).|$|E
5|$|It {{seems that}} most of the Romano-British sites were {{abandoned}} by the 5th century and the <b>arable</b> <b>land</b> reverted to scrub and woodland. Arriving in the 6th century, the Anglo-Saxons began to clear the land again. Bletchley ("Blaeca's clearing") and Shenley ("Bright clearing") date from this period. Large settlements have been excavated at Pennyland and near Milton Keynes Village. Their cemeteries have been found at Newport Pagnell, Shenley and Tattenhoe.|$|E
5|$|Much of the Mendips is open {{calcareous}} grassland, {{supporting a}} wide variety of flowering plants and insects. Some parts are deciduous ancient woodland, and some have been used intensively for arable agriculture, particularly since World WarI. As the demand for <b>arable</b> <b>land</b> in Britain declined, some areas were returned to grassland, but the use of fertilisers and herbicides has reduced its biodiversity. Grazing by rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus), sheep (Ovis aries) and cattle (Bos taurus) maintains the grassland habitat.|$|E

5|$|The {{expanding}} {{population of}} Scandinavia {{led to a}} shortage of available resources and <b>arable</b> <b>land</b> there {{and led to a}} period of Viking expansion, the Norse gradually shifting their attention from plundering to invasion. Shetland was colonised during the late 8th and 9th centuries, the fate of the existing indigenous population being uncertain. Modern Shetlanders have almost identical proportions of Scandinavian matrilineal and patrilineal genetic ancestry, suggesting that the islands were settled by both men and women in equal measure.|$|E
5|$|COMIGAL {{dispatched}} inspection teams throughout South Vietnam {{to identify}} {{areas that were}} suitable for accommodating the new arrivals according to their professional skills. This required a search for <b>arable</b> <b>land</b> for farmers, favourable coastal areas for fishing and areas near large population centres for industrially oriented arrivals. Having identified the relevant areas, COMIGAL would set up plans for settlement subprojects, sending proposals to the USOM or the French Technical and Economic Cooperation Bureau to gain approval and funding. The bureaucracy was relatively low, with most applications taking less than a fortnight for finalising paperwork and receiving approval. Each subproject was given a nine-month deadline for completion.|$|E
5|$|Essad Pasha Toptani, as {{minister}} {{of war and}} interior, was against a peaceful solution of the problem. He opposed the International Commission of Control which believed that the problem could be solved by diplomatic means. The Prince and his cabinet accepted Essad Pasha's proposals for a military solution. Several thousand Italian rifles and Austrian machine and mountain guns were purchased and distributed to the (predominantly Muslim) population of central Albania. They believed that the new regime was a tool of the (Christian) Great Powers and the landowners that owned half of the <b>arable</b> <b>land.</b> On the basis of those beliefs they revolted.|$|E

30|$|The {{assessment}} {{focused on}} <b>arable</b> <b>lands</b> (about 30, 000  km 2), since 84  % of the Great Hungarian Plain {{is used by}} agriculture, mostly <b>arable</b> <b>lands.</b> Indexes characterizing drought hazard (PaDI), wind erosion sensitivity, and inland excess water hazard (HUMI) (Table  1) were calculated for a base period (1961 – 1990) and two future periods (2021 – 2050 and 2071 – 2100) based on REMO and ALADIN regional climate model simulation data. The hazards were evaluated by the changes between the reference and the future periods for both models. The rate of changes was classified into 5  % intervals. The area of land in each interval was calculated {{in the percentage of}} the total area of <b>arable</b> <b>lands.</b> The dataset was normalized by cutting out the extreme values (where area is less than 1  %). The dataset contains small patches that result in inaccurate values when overlayed with the climate dataset. These errors were avoided by excluding the extreme values from the analysis.|$|R
5|$|Following European settlement, {{the growth}} of the new colony of New South Wales led to an {{increasing}} demand for <b>arable</b> <b>land.</b> Governor Lachlan Macquarie supported expeditions to open up new lands to the south of the capital Sydney, including one to find an overland route to Jervis Bay, an area which would later be incorporated into the ACT as its only coastal possession. In 1818 Charles Throsby, Hamilton Hume, James Meehan and William Kearns set out to find the route, a task accomplished that same year by Throsby and Kearns.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, in Wales {{there were}} 1,048,000 {{hectares}} under permanent grass, a further 437,000 hectares were rough grassland, 87,000 hectares were woodland and 239,000 hectares were <b>arable</b> <b>land</b> (including temporary grassland). The number of horses for agricultural purposes are {{not mentioned in}} the statistics, but there were 290,000 dairy cows, 214,000 other cattle, 28,400 pigs and 9,739,000 sheep in the country. There were also 945 arable and horticultural holdings, 1,753 dairy farms, 12,650 beef and sheep farms, 95 specialist pig units and 426 specialist poultry units.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the sites}} {{are located in the}} Highlands and Islands. This may be because of the {{relatively}} sparse modern populations and consequent lack of disturbance. Much of the area also has a thick covering of peat that preserves stone fragments, although the associated acidic conditions tend to dissolve organic materials. There are also numerous important remains in the Orkney archipelago, where sand and <b>arable</b> <b>land</b> predominate. Local tradition hints at both a fear and veneration of these ancient structures that may have helped to preserve their integrity.|$|E
40|$|The {{analysis}} of the land use structure of the 13 counties of the Romanian part of Tisa catchment area has been made according to the 2000 edition of CORINE Land Cover, while the 1990 edition {{has been used for}} comparative purposes. Out of the total area of 8, 269, 229. 48 hectares, the forests cover 37. 92 %, the <b>arable</b> <b>lands</b> 35. 02 % and the grasslands 17. 97 %. The other types of land use have lower weights, such as the continuous and discontinuous urban fabric 4. 81 %, the orchards 1. 10 % and the vineyards 0. 98 %. In the category of forests, the following types of land use are included: broad-leaved forests, which form the majority (24. 72 %), coniferous forests (6. 22 %), mixed forests (3. 46 %) and transitional woodland-shrub areas (3. 52 %). The forests are mainly located in the Carpathians and the hills. The non-irrigated <b>arable</b> <b>lands</b> (23. 50 %) are predominant within the <b>arable</b> <b>lands.</b> They lie mostly in the Western Plain and in the basins and corridors of the Transylvanian Depression and the Western Hills. The {{analysis of}} the dynamics of the land use structure between 1990 and 2000 indicates a relative stability in the case of forests, a decrease of <b>arable</b> <b>lands</b> and an increase of grasslands...|$|R

5|$|There is {{evidence}} that this species has changed its natural habitat in at least parts of its range. In Germany and elsewhere in central Europe, it was found only in coniferous forest until the mid-1920s when its range rapidly expanded, first into farmland, and then to suburbs and urban parks. The reasons for this expansion are unclear. In areas of intensive farming, such as eastern England, <b>arable</b> <b>land</b> has in turn largely been abandoned in favour of built-up areas with their greater variety of green habitats.|$|E
5|$|Across Honduras, {{agriculture}} sustained serious damage, with initial {{estimates of}} 70% of crops destroyed. Flooding affected about 29% of the country's <b>arable</b> <b>land,</b> much of covered {{for an extended}} period of time. This washed away large areas of topsoil, which would take a long period of time to recover. About 85% of the banana crop was lost, along with the loss of 60% of melons, 60% of sugar cane, and 58% of corn. About one-third of the corn crop had already been harvested. About 50,000bovine were killed, as were 60% of the fowl population. Crop and agricultural damage totaled about $1billion, which would take the country years to recover. Poor road conditions following the storm prevented crops from being dried, which caused further damage.|$|E
40|$|Investigations of Gamasina mites {{in natural}} and man-affected soils in Latvia (Acari: Mesostigmata) A short {{overview}} is presented on Gamasina material collected in 22 natural and man-disturbed habitats in Latvia. Species diversity, average density and species dominance were investigated. Altogether 167 Gamasina species from 14 families were found. The {{highest number of}} species was found for field margins and the lowest for pine forests and <b>arable</b> <b>lands</b> affected by calciferous dust. The highest densities of mites were observed for <b>arable</b> <b>lands,</b> and the lowest for coastal meadows.
