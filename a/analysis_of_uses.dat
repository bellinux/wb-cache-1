Hence, we did not explore the potential for substituting a candidate product that is only used for a specific pest and/or crop by an alternative product that is authorised for broad-spectrum use against a large group of pests and/or in multiple crops.

This was mainly about a political signal effect, as is highlighted by the following facts: the usually necessary <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>uses</b> and, based on this analysis, the choice of the best risk management method was largely not made. This is even more surprising, given that the authorisation procedure does not regulate, e.g. SVHC substances in imported articles. Consequently, articles containing these substances can be imported into the EU without authorisation becoming necessary. However, targeted restrictions would be {{the most effective way to}} regulate substances in imported articles (e.g. children's toys), thus protecting consumers.|$|E

This book chapter examines the attack, mounted by elements of the trans-national liberal elite, on those forms of 'populism' which seem the threaten the electoral prospects of centrist political parties.

Whilst the authors highlight some important, we believe there are strong arguments to stick with the existing IUCN classification system and outline these in the following response. They include: the importance of having a global protected area classification system that includes both marine and terrestrial (many protected areas contain both); the challenge of generating accurate data, which would be increased by the proposals, and the multiple objectives of protected areas beyond those considered in the classification system. Furthermore, the current system was determined after a lengthy consultation process, involving hundreds of professionals around the world, and should not therefore be casually abandoned...|$|E
40|$|Based on the {{articles}} brought together for this special issue, this article proposes a transversal analysis and theoretical elaboration {{of the question}} of the uses of religious elements for meaning making and boundary work. In order to do so, we will first propose a sociocultural psychological perspective to examine meaning making dynamics. Second, we will apply a boundary work perspective, as recently developed in the social sciences, on the organization of religious differences. The first considers religious elements as resources that can be used by people to orient themselves in time and the social space, to interpret and guide action, and to create new forms of life. The second approach proposes an <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>uses</b> of religious stuff in order to understand how boundaries between groups are created, transgressed or dissolved as well as to explore the link between religion and power. Our argument is that the articulation of these two approaches can itself offer a rich theoretical frame to apprehend religions in contemporary society...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe IS {{literature}} allows {{to identify}} {{the role played by}} the characteristics of the people and the characteristics of the tools in the uses if an ICT tool. However, these papers have in common to develop a very narrow analysis of them. They have difficulties {{to take into account the}} organization as a whole. Numerous papers ask for a greater consideration of the organization into the analysis of the uses of an ICT tool. In this paper, we suggest to enrich this reflection by paying attention to researches produced in the field of the sociology of organizations. To show the potential of this literature, we present a case study of a Small and Medium Enterprise that uses a software supposed to improve collective decisions. The results produced by this case study allow to validate the relevance of the framework which develop a localized <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>uses</b> but they also show that it is interesting to interpret those uses from a more global view, especially with regard to the strategic challenges of this firm.

40|$|The paper {{concerns}} the experience developed {{in several years}} of teaching conservation of modern heritage in schools of architecture, international Erasmus workshops and Docomomo workshops to students coming {{from all over the}} world, with different cultural and educational backgrounds. Modern architectural heritage masterpieces have high potential for pedagogic purposes, especially for helping students to develop a critical thinking on (modern) heritage preservation. During the courses students are guided through a deep knowledge of the building in order to define intervention strategies and to develop a preservation project. The analysis of the buildings – ranging from the understanding of the radical ideas of modern architects to the survey on the field, the archival and bibliographical research, the <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>uses,</b> problems, materials and decay – is the starting point of a continuous challenge to commonplaces, to standard solutions, to established beliefs about the modern heritage and about the contemporary role of the architect. All this is possible through the application of a teaching method that have theory of conservation and practice of design going at the same pace, in a spiral process of awareness. This method is the most appropriate to engage students with preservation and re-use of modern architecture, meant as essential tools for their future professional background, rather than as separate fields of action. The project is a mean to pinpoint the subtle contradictions of the discipline and an occasion to develop the required critical knowledge to translate theoretical positions in a sound approach to the transformation/evolution of built heritage...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I examine {{emergent}} technological practices relating to tablet computers in scientific research laboratories. I ask four main questions: To what extent can tablets be considered scientific instruments? How do tablets help to construct technoscientific imaginaries? What role do tablets {{play in the}} construction of technoscientific subjectivities? Can tablets, positioned as popular everyday computing devices, be considered in terms of expertise in the context of laboratory science? To answer these questions, research is presented that examines the situated practices of scientists using tablet computers. I use textual analysis to examine the marketing discourses relating to laboratory-specific tablet apps and how their material structure defines scientific community and communication. Ethnographic research into the way that tablets are being introduced as part of a new teaching laboratory in a large UK university is presented, focusing on how institutional power affects the definition of the tablet. A second ethnographic research case study addresses how two chemists define their own scientific subjectivity by constructing the tablet as a futuristic technology. In a third large ethnographic research case, I consider the way that tablets can be used in practices of inclusion and exclusion from sites of scientific knowledge. I draw on literature from media and cultural studies and science and technology studies, arguing that the two fields intersect in ways that can be productive for research in both. This serves as a contribution to knowledge, demonstrating how research into identity, politics and technologies can benefit from a focus on materiality drawn from the two disciplines. I contribute to knowledge in both fields by developing two key concepts, ‘affordance ambiguity’ and ‘tablet imaginary’. These concepts can be applied in the <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>uses</b> of technology to better understand, firstly, how technologies are made meaningful for users and, secondly, how this individual meaning-making affects broader cultural trends and understandings of technologies...|$|E
40|$|Ethnopharmacological {{relevance}} and background: “Dictamnus” {{was a popular}} name {{for a group of}} medicinal herbaceous plant species of the Rutaceae and Lamiaceae, which since the 4 th century have been used for gynaecological problems and other illnesses BCE and still appear in numerous ethnobotanical records. Aims: This research has as four overarching aims: Determining the historical evolution of medical preparations labelled “Dictamnus” and the different factors affecting this long-standing herbal tradition. Deciphering and differentiating those medicinal uses of “Dictamnus” which strictly correspond to Dictamnus (Rutaceae), from those of Origanum dictamnus and other Lamiaceae species. Quantitatively assessing the dependence from herbal books, and pharmaceutical tradition, of modern Dictamnus ethnobotanical records. Determining whether differences between Western and Eastern Europe exist with regards to the Dictamnus albus uses in ethnopharmacology and ethnomedicine. Methods: An exhaustive review of herbals, classical pharmacopoeias, ethnobotanical and ethnopharmacological literature was conducted. Systematic <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>uses</b> reported which were standardized according to International Classification of Diseases – 10 and multivariate analysis using factorial, hierarchical and neighbour joining methods was undertaken. Results and discussion: The popular concept “Dictamnus” includes Origanum dictamnus L., Ballota pseudodictamnus (L.) Benth. and B. acetabulosa (L.) Benth. (Lamiaceae), as well as Dictamnus albus L. and D. hispanicus Webb ex Willk. (Rutaceae), with 86 different types of uses. Between 1000 and 1700 CE numerous complex preparations with “Dictamnus” were used in the treatment of 35 different pathologies. On biogeographical grounds the widespread D. albus is a far more likely prototypical “Dictamnus” than the Cretan endemic Origanum dictamnus. However both form integral parts of the “Dictamnus” complex. Evidence exists for a sufficiently long and coherent tradition for D. albus and D. hispanicus, use to treat 47 different categories of diseases. Conclusions: This approach is a model for understanding the cultural history of plants and their role as resources for health care. “Dictamnus” shows how transmission of traditional knowledge about materia medica, over 26 centuries, represents remarkable levels of development and innovation. All this lead us to call attention to D. albus and D. hispanicus which are highly promising as potential herbal drug leads. The next steps of research should be to systematically analyse phytochemical, pharmacological and clinical evidence and to develop safety, pharmacology and toxicology profiles of the traditional preparations...|$|E

40|$|USES, the Uniform System for Evaluation of Substances, is a decision-supporting tool, {{that can}} be used for rapid, {{quantitative}} risk assessments of chemical substances during their life-cycle. Risk assessment is an inherently uncertain process due to the limited data availability and lack of knowledge. Furthermore, many model parameters exhibit natural variability (e. g., the flow rate of a river). Therefore, a thorough model analysis is advisable. Uncertainty analysis shows the user of a model what amount of uncertainty accompanies the model's results (the risk quotients or PEC/NEC ratios). In this manner, the uncertainty can be taken into account in decision-making by indicating the probability that a wrong decision is made. An additional benefit is that uncertainty analysis can steer data gathering or research by pointing out the main sources of uncertainty in the model's results. This can be used effectively, to refine a risk assessment. Version 1. 0 of USES already contained a limited uncertainty analysis for the aquatic organisms and the micro-organisms in the sewage treatment plant. In this report, the uncertainty analysis is extended to the other groups to be protected (humans, terrestrial organisms, predating birds and mammals). In this report, only the local exposure model is examined. Due to its technical nature, this report is primarily meant for the further development of USES. The described simple analytical method to combine uncertainties is limited to multiplicative models and lognormal uncertainties. The advantage of this method is that an exact answer can be calculated very rapidly. However, not all calculations are multiplicative. Therefore, we have to resort to Monte Carlo approaches for several parts of the system. One single uncertainty <b>analysis</b> <b>of</b> <b>USES</b> is not possible as the uncertainty in the model's result will vary for different substance properties. Therefore, the analysis must be performed 'on-line' by the user, for each substance to be assessed. Naturally, this poses restrictions on the computer time required for the uncertainty calculations. Each calculation or model of USES 1. 0 is discussed separately with respect to uncertainty. Furthermore, uncertainties in parameters are quantified. In many cases, this is done by a thorough data analysis, in some cases by expert judgement. Not all sources of uncertainty can be quantified. Only uncertainty and/or variability in model parameters is taken into account. Uncertainty due to the exposure scenario cannot be quantified. Furthermore, the uncertainties in the extrapolation procedure of No-Effect Concentrations (NECs) for ecosystems, need further examination. Therefore, the absolute value of the uncertainty in the model's result must not be exaggerated. In the interpretation of risk quotients with their uncertainties, the limitations mentioned need to be taken into consideration. A thorough testing of the proposed uncertainty analysis is therefore, advisable (testing may take place in 1995) ...|$|E
