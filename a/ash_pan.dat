50|$|Wildfires were a {{constant}} consideration {{during the dry}} and hot seasons at Fort Eustis, and special care {{had to be taken}} with <b>ash</b> <b>pans</b> and spark screens (spark arresters) on steam locomotives and with carbon deposits breaking loose and flying from diesel-electric locomotives. Train crews were cautioned to be alert to defects or operating conditions that could lead to the setting of fires and to take corrective or ameliorating action to remove or minimize the chances of setting a trackside fire.|$|R
50|$|Like their predecessors, {{they had}} Belpaire fireboxes with {{combustion}} chambers and Walschaerts valve gear. While they were practically {{identical to the}} 1904 lcomotives in most respects, their boilers had been raised by 1+1/4 in, which raised the boiler pitch by 1 in to 7 ft and gave a better rake {{on the sides of}} the <b>ash</b> <b>pan.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A large {{increase}} in firebox area (from 66 sq ft on the H-10 to 100 sq ft on the A-1), characteristic of his work, necessitated adding another axle to the trailing truck, thus creating the 2-8-4 wheel arrangement. Built {{in the spring}} of 1925, the first Berkshire (a demonstrator owned by Lima) was dubbed the A-1. In addition to supporting the very large firebox and grate, the four-wheeled trailing truck carried the <b>ash</b> <b>pan.</b> For this purpose, the truck was redesigned as an articulated extension of the locomotive frame. The result was an <b>ash</b> <b>pan</b> which could hold more ash, allowing the locomotive to travel farther between cleanings. (For roads which burned coal, this was a significant innovation. But it was not without tradeoffs. The articulated frame reduced weight on the driving wheels, which did not aid tractive effort (pulling ability). The locomotives so configured also had more difficulty staying on the rails in reverse, particularly through yard trackwork like switch frogs.) ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1910, the NGR placed 21 Improved Class B {{locomotives}} in service. They {{were built}} by NBL and incorporated various {{improvements to the}} original design of the Class B. Their boilers had been raised by 1+1/4 in to give a better rake {{on the sides of}} the <b>ash</b> <b>pan</b> and they were built with Hendrie’s steam reversers. In 1912, they were designated Class 1A on the SAR.|$|E
50|$|There {{were three}} {{separate}} grates and <b>ash</b> <b>pans,</b> {{one on each}} side outside the frames and a third between, giving an aggregate area of 42 sq ft. The trailing drivers were given a side play of 0.5 in, the coupling rods being fitted with ball and socket joints. As the cranks of the three cylinders were set at 120 degrees in relation to each other, perfect balancing of the reciprocating parts was secured. In order to minimise the drivers slipping, compressed air sanders were fitted.|$|R
50|$|The safe {{operation}} of a wood-burning stove requires regular maintenance such as emptying <b>ash</b> <b>pans</b> (containers) beneath the wood grate. Routine cleaning of the stove pipes and chimney is also needed to prevent chimney fires. Creosote and soot gradually build up in stovepipes and chimneys. This could damage the chimney and spread fire to the surrounding structure, especially the roof. When soot blocks the airflow through the stove pipes or chimney, smoke can build up in the stove pipes and in the house through the stove.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of the}} rebuild, IfS/DR mixer preheaters, pressure-compensating piston valves (Trofimoff valves) and new Stühren <b>ash</b> <b>pans</b> were installed. The wider outer firebox needed new front {{walls to}} the driver's cab, the front windows of which were {{equipped}} with demisting equipment. For the larger and heavier VMP 15-20 compounded mixer pump (Verbundmischpumpe) a new pump mount had to be built. This and the new mixer preheater apparatus required a different arrangement for the main air reservoir. The outside cylinders with a diameter of just 520 mm, originally designed for boiler pressures of 20 bar, were retained however. In {{the course of the}} rebuild, the brakes on the front carrying axle were removed.|$|R
5000|$|... 22 {{archaeological sites}} have been discovered: tombs, graves with cover, <b>ash</b> <b>pan</b> graves, pit graves, and more. One {{of the most}} {{interesting}} discoveries were urns - usually an earthen vessel, which serves to store the ashes of the deceased, which is characteristic for the cultures which used a certain funeral rite. These findings confirm the continuity of settlement in the village and surrounding areas.|$|E
50|$|Regarding the crew, Chamberlain wrote:While the {{passenger}} with closed windows in an up train had an unpleasant journey… the unfortunate enginemen underwent a shocking ordeal. On tender engines both {{knelt on the}} footplate, coats over heads, to breathe the air coming from under the engine, the apron plate being raised for this purpose. Though the air was hot from passing around or through the <b>ash</b> <b>pan,</b> it was nonetheless welcome.|$|E
50|$|A multi-fuel stove is {{very similar}} to a {{wood-burning}} stove in appearance and design. Multifuel refers to the capability of the stove to burn wood and also coal, wood pellets, or peat. Stoves that have a grate for the fire to burn on and a removable <b>ash</b> <b>pan</b> are generally considered multi-fuel stoves. If the fire simply burns on a bed of ash, it is a wood-only fuelled appliance, and cannot be used for coal or peat.|$|E
25|$|Sanders falsified {{his date}} of birth and enlisted in the United States Army in October 1906, {{completing}} his service commitment as a teamster in Cuba. He was honorably discharged in February 1907 and moved to Sheffield, Alabama, where his uncle lived. There, he met his brother Clarence who had also moved there in order to escape their stepfather. The uncle worked for the Southern Railway, and secured Sanders a job there as a blacksmith's helper in the workshops. After two months, Sanders moved to Jasper, Alabama where {{he got a job}} cleaning out the <b>ash</b> <b>pans</b> of trains from the Northern Alabama Railroad (a division of the Southern Railway) when they had finished their run. Sanders progressed to become a fireman (steam engine stoker) at the age of 16 or 17.|$|R
50|$|The German SS staff {{selected}} young Jewish prisoners from incoming transports to {{join the}} camp Sonderkommando, a special unit of 50 to 60 men deployed at the forest burial camp. They removed corpses from the gas-vans and placed them in mass graves. The large trenches were quickly filled, but the smell of decomposing bodies began to permeate the surrounding countryside including nearby villages. In the spring of 1942, the SS ordered burning of the bodies in the forest. The bodies were cremated on open air grids constructed of concrete slabs and rail tracks; pipes were used for air ducts, and long <b>ash</b> <b>pans</b> were built below the grid. Later, the Jewish Sonderkommando had to exhume the mass graves and burn the previously interred bodies. In addition, they sorted the clothing of the victims, and cleaned the excrement and blood from the vans.|$|R

5000|$|During rebuilding, {{they were}} fitted with LMS {{standard}} boilers {{that had to}} be placed higher than the originals to allow the firebox and <b>ash</b> <b>pan</b> to clear the rear driving wheel axle. The smokebox saddle was extended accordingly to offer support. The closely coupled driving wheels accentuated the appearance of the high-pitched boiler, earning these engines the nickname of [...] "Whippet" [...] because of a perceived resemblance to the breed of racing dog. [...] All members of the class were officially named after Ulster counties.|$|E
5000|$|... 4501 was {{stripped}} {{down for an}} extensive overhaul with the thin cab floor, the rotted <b>ash</b> <b>pan,</b> and the rusty smoke box front replaced. The dented cab roof was straightened and got a radio antenna installed. In addition, the cylinder cocks were reworked and the throttle lapped with a new airline run to the repacked reverse gear. After {{that it was time}} to paint, the 4501 groups have the locomotive repainted in the fictitious Southern Crescent green with gold linings rather than the plain black freight livery.|$|E
50|$|The almost ten-year {{difference}} between {{the installation of the}} first high pressure boilers and this final one results in differences between them. For instance, boiler 15 already came equipped with naphtha injectors (in the others, these were added progressively), the conveyor belt is lower, the control table is more advanced in registering and reading the boiler’s operational data, the boiler dust (<b>ash)</b> <b>pan</b> has six coal hoppers to expel boiler dust and coal (in the other there were only three), and it is also slightly larger in size.|$|E

50|$|The {{use of a}} fire pan {{reduces the}} impact to the ground, {{vegetation}} and rocks, and its compact size results in the burning of less wood. Fire pans also allow users to easily burn their accumulated garbage although the best practice is to only burn paper. Combustible items will be reduced to <b>ash.</b> A fire <b>pan</b> user can leave no trace of their previous fire because the ashes can be collected and buried.|$|R
50|$|The kettle grill is {{considered}} the classic American grill design. The original and often-copied Weber kettle grill was invented in 1951 by George Stephen. It has remained {{one of the most}} commercially successful charcoal grill designs to date. Smaller and more portable versions exist, such as the Weber Smokey Joe. The kettle grill is composed of a lid, cooking grid, charcoal grid, lower chamber, venting system, and legs. Some models include an <b>ash</b> catcher <b>pan</b> and wheels. The lower chamber that holds the charcoal is shaped like a kettle, giving the grill its name. The key to the kettle grill's cooking abilities is its shape. The kettle design distributes heat more evenly. When the lid is placed on the grill, it prevents flare-ups from dripping grease, and allows heat to circulate around the food as it cooks. It also holds in flavor-enhancing smoke produced by the dripping grease or from smoking wood added to the charcoal fire.|$|R
50|$|In 1995, 18 {{was placed}} on {{permanent}} loan to 3801 Limited, to operate The Cockatoo Run from Wollongong to Moss Vale. After The Cockatoo Run ceased in 1998 it was stored at Eveleigh Railway Workshops. The locomotive was sent to Bradken Rail's workshops at Braemar and overhauled, and transferred to Hunter Valley Railway Works at Rothbury in early 2007. 18 was significantly modified whilst under 3801 Limited's care, including {{but not limited to}} an extended self-cleaning smokebox, replacement welded tanks, a complete mechanical <b>ash</b> <b>pan</b> and hopper release, and an enlarged bunker, all of which it still carries.|$|E
5000|$|Fifty Class 19C {{locomotives}} entered {{service in}} 1935, built by NBL {{to the design}} of the Class 19B, but with Rotary Cam Poppet valve gear and Watson Standard no. 1A boilers. It had a larger superheater than the Class 19B and was equipped with a Watson cab with a sloping front that, like the Watson Standard boiler, was to become standard on later SAR steam locomotive classes. In a break with prior custom, the <b>ash</b> <b>pan</b> and running boards were affixed to the locomotive frame instead of to the boiler to facilitate easier removal of the boiler for repairs.|$|E

The Watson cab, like the Watson Standard boiler, was to become standard on later SAR steam locomotive classes.|$|E
5000|$|A {{cigarette}} receptacle is {{a container}} or device for extinguishing {{and disposal of}} cigarette waste. Other common names for cigarette receptacle include: ash urn, <b>ash</b> <b>pan,</b> butt receptacles, butt bins, butt holders, snuffers, smokers poles, cigarette waste receptacles, smokers waste receptacles, and ash/trash combination. Originally provided as a courtesy to smokers in public places, cigarette receptacles are now commonplace as smoking bans and designated smoking areas require proper disposal methods. A typical receptacle can hold hundreds - even thousands - of disposed cigarette butts. [...] While the United States congress has not attempted to pass a nationwide smoking ban, many states and local governments have enacted their own statutes addressing smoking in public places.|$|E

50|$|On {{the evening}} of 29 July 1954, after Stavros had left for work and the {{children}} had been put to bed, Christofi went to the kitchen, where Hella was going about her chores, and knocked her unconscious with {{a blow to the}} back of the head with an <b>ash</b> <b>pan</b> from the boiler. She then strangled Hella to death with a scarf, removed the wedding ring from her finger, and attempted to cremate the body by pouring paraffin over it and setting it on fire. The flames caught the attention of next-door neighbour John Young, who was passing by the house walking his dog. He saw Christofi burning Hella's body through a window. However, he believed that the article being burnt was a mannequin, and seeing that Christofi was attending to the fire, believed there was no cause for alarm.|$|E
50|$|There is {{similarly}} {{no evidence to}} support the claims that they had problems in service which led to their alleged demotion from express passenger use. The design of the fire grate and <b>ash</b> <b>pan</b> was very similar to, for example, the later Gresley K3 2-6-0s, and their fireboxes were deep and relatively large for their 26.5 sq ft grate area. Overheating troubles with axleboxes have been alleged, related to the large force from the inside cylinders. Robinson in fact took care to make the coupled boxes as large as possible, 9 x 9 in on the two leading axles and 8 x 12 in on the trailing set. In fact a more likely source of initial trouble was the marine-type big ends fitted to the first five, since the sixth reverted to strap and cotter type.|$|E
5000|$|As {{part of this}} [...] "Renewal Programme" [...] {{members of}} Class A were rebuilt as {{two-cylinder}} simples (i.e. not compounds). Those reclassified as Class A1 were rebuilt with a Midland Railway type RG6 boiler and new cylinders both of 18 in diameter by 24 in stroke. The boiler was higher pitched than the original to allow the firebox and <b>ash</b> <b>pan</b> to clear the rear driving wheel axle and an extension of 24.75 in to the smokebox saddle was needed to offer support. Although the effect was less striking {{than that of the}} similarly rebuilt Class B3, the modified appearance was such that these locomotives would be included among those that gained the nickname of [...] "Whippet" [...] because of a perceived resemblance to the racing dog. [...] All the class were officially named after mountains although that allocated to No. 58, Lurigethan, was never carried.|$|E
5000|$|There were {{at least}} three {{successive}} waves of [...] "Super Power". The first began with NYC 8000 and the A-1, and included Missouri Pacific 2-8-4s and Texas & Pacific 2-10-4s. These locomotives had conventional 63" [...] driving wheels. In 1927, the Erie Railroad took delivery of a [...] "second-phase" [...] Berkshire with 70" [...] driving wheels, capable not only of great power but higher speed; in turn, this design evolved into the Chesapeake & Ohio T-1 2-10-4s of 1930, with 69" [...] driving wheels. The [...] "third-phase" [...] of the later 1930s and war years can be identified with locomotives such as the homebuilt N&W 2-6-6-4s, C&O/Virginian 2-6-6-6 and virtually all American 4-8-4s. Boiler pressures rose as high as 310 lbs/sq.in.; thermic syphons added to the firebox and combustion chamber added 8% to {{the efficiency of the}} boiler; roller bearings appeared on main axle boxes and sometimes on running gear. And the [...] "Super Power" [...] concept had extended to other builders such as Alco (the Union Pacific Big Boy) and Baldwin (the Santa Fe 5001- and 5011-class 2-10-4s). The four-wheel trailing truck became the standard for large locomotives (i.e. 4-8-4, 2-10-4, 4-6-6-4, 2-8-8-4), though the articulated main frame did not. Many railroads, particularly roads like the Santa Fe (which favored oil burning locomotives and, therefore, did not need the oversized <b>ash</b> <b>pan),</b> adopted many of the Super Power features but utilized a conventional full frame and separate trailing truck.|$|E
5000|$|In 1950 {{it became}} clear {{additional}} motive power was required in the North Island, but the process of dieselisation was yet to begin. Consequently, NZR chose to order 16 steam locomotives from North British {{to the design of}} the successful J class. These locomotives contained a number of differences to both the J class and Hillside JAs - although turned out with the cross-compound pump, roller bearings on the rods were limited to the connection between the connecting and driving rod, mechanical lubrication was employed. In January 1951 the order had been made for the 16 JA to be more coal burners, and North British regarded the order as essentially a repeat order, virtually identical to 1939 J, but in April 1951 the NZR CME requested the order to be changed to oil burning due to perceived long term coal shortage due to the waterfront strike and the associated strike by miners and unavailability of shipping for coal and the expected long term high imported coal price and the long time it would take to build up coal stocks to safe levels, and the class were built as oil burners, with no grate, <b>ash</b> <b>pan</b> or fire door (the only class of locomotives on the NZR to be built completely as oil burners)and ACFL blow down was incorporated late in their construction. A significant improvement was the incorporation of French T.I.A, blow down equipment which enabled rapid ejection of boiler sludge and reduced the boiler scale, enabling much faster turnaround and higher availability. The system of injection of the oil flow into the burners is different and far more effective than in NZR 1948-50 conversion of 12 Js to oil burning. Other detail differences was the use of Stone's headlights and electrical generator instead of the usual Pyle National equipment, the [...] "Butterfly" [...] number boards on the front headlight, and the lack of smokebox number plate (although a smokebox plate was specified by the NZR).|$|E
5000|$|In the {{standard}} steam locomotive firetube type boiler, the firebox {{is surrounded by}} water space on five sides. The bottom of the firebox is open to atmospheric pressure, but covered by fire grates (solid fuel) or a firing pan (liquid fuel). If the engine burns solid fuel, like wood or coal, there is a grate covering most of {{the bottom of the}} firebox to hold the fire. An ashpan, mounted underneath the firebox and below the grates, catches and collects hot embers, ashes, and other solid combustion waste as it falls through the grates. In a coal-burning locomotive, the grates may be shaken to clean dead ash {{from the bottom of the}} fire. They are shaken either manually or (in larger locomotives) by a powered grate shaker. Wood-burning locomotives have fixed grates that can't be shaken. Wood ash is generally powder which will fall through the grates with no more agitation required than the vibrations of the locomotive rolling down the track. The fire grates must be replaced periodically due to the extreme heat they must endure. Combustion air enters through the bottom of the firebox and airflow is usually controlled by damper doors above the ash collection pocket of the <b>ash</b> <b>pan.</b> A locomotive that burns liquid fuel - usually [...] "Bunker C" [...] fuel oil or similar heavy oil - does not have grates. Instead, they have a heavy metal gauge firing pan bolted tight against the bottom of the firebox. The firing pan is covered with firebrick and the firebox has a firebrick lining, usually up to the level of the firebox door, all the way around the firebox. The oil burner is a nozzle containing a slot for the oil to flow out onto a steam jet which atomizes the oil into a fine mist which ignites in the firebox. The oil burner nozzle is usually mounted in the front of the firebox, protected by a hood of firebrick, and aimed at the firebrick wall below the firebox door. Dampers control air flow to the oil fire.|$|E
