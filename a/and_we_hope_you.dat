[...] This message referred to Sinatra's adoption of the Harrison composition [...] "Something", which he lauded as [...] "the greatest love song of the past fifty years". On [...] "Far East Man", Inglis finds Scott's multiple horn parts [...] "reminiscent of the soul stylings" [...] of King Curtis, Junior Walker and the Funk Brothers.

2500|$|On {{obtaining the}} summit of the ridge the allied column found itself facing the French {{infantry}} line. The French guards rose and advanced towards the crest, whereupon the two forces confronted each other at a distance of 30 paces. The moment was immortalised by Lord Charles Hay of the 1st Regiment of Guards who later wrote that he stepped forward, took out a hip flask and drank with a flourish, shouting out to his opponent, [...] "We are the English Guards, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> will stand till we come up to you, and not swim the Scheldt as you did the Main at Dettingen." [...] He then led his men in three cheers. Voltaire's version of this famous episode has become proverbial. He wrote: [...] "The English officers saluted the French by doffing their hats … [...] the French, returned the greeting. My Lord Charles Hai, captain in the English Guards, cried, 'Gentlemen of the French Guards, fire.' The Comte d'Auteroche, then lieutenant of Grenadiers, shouted, 'Gentlemen, we never fire first; fire yourselves.'" [...] The French were the first to fire, the volley was somewhat ineffective but threw the Third Guards into some confusion and wounded George Churchill, the commander of the guards brigade. Captain Lord Panmure led the unbroken companies of the Third Guards to the flank of the First Guards. Up to this point the British column had not fired a single musket shot, but now the allied infantry poured a devastating discharge into the French. The volley of musketry with the battalion guns delivering numerous rounds of grape-shot, swept away the front rank of the ten battalions of the French first line, killing and wounding between 700–800 men, breaking the Gardes Françaises, while the Gardes Suisses and the four battalions of the Brigade Aubeterre were driven back by the British advance.|$|E

She said, in fact, that the blankets you had were the same you bought when you were first married, that some of them had been worn out and given to your poorer neighbors, and that now you were very short of blankets, and, with cold weather coming on, she did not consider that the clothing on your own bed was sufficient. She even went so far as to say that the blankets she used were very thin, and that she did not think they were warm enough for winter. So, some of us have agreed together that we would testify our friendship and our sympathy by presenting you with a pair of good, warm blankets for your own bed; then those you have could go to Willy Croup, and you both would be comfortable all winter. Of course, what we have done has not been upon an expensive scale. We have had many calls upon us,--poor old Mrs. Bradley, for one,--and we could not afford to spend much money. But we have bought you a good pair of blankets, which are warm and serviceable, <b>and</b> <b>we</b> <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> will not be offended, and we do not believe that you will be, for you know our motives, and all that we ask is that when you are warm and comfortable under our little gift, you will sometimes think of us.
