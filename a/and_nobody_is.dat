However in practice, it is almost impossible to take any social action, such as a change in economic policy, without making at least one person worse off. Even voluntary exchanges may not be Pareto improving if they make third parties worse off.|$|E

He has also acquired the fan nickname [...] "Jimo Dashen," [...] which translates to [...] "The Lonely Master" [...] or [...] "The Lonely God" [...] in Chinese. Fredette commented on this during an interview: “It’s not necessarily the same sense that you think about being lonely. In America, you just think you are by yourself and depressed and that type of stuff. But in this way, it more means that you're on top, <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>is</b> around you.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Before making Starship Titanic, Adams had {{previously}} {{served as a}} designer for Infocom's 1984 text-based game The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, {{which was based on}} his successful science fiction series of the same name, and had been an advocate for [...] "new media". Since working with Infocom, Adams had expressed interest in returning to game design, and feared that he was spending too much time by himself writing. He turned to game design again after playing Myst, which is when he said [...] "the medium had gotten interesting again". However, he thought Myst was lacking in story and characters. Commenting on the gameplay of Myst and its sequel Riven, Adams said that [...] "nothing really happens, <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>is</b> there. I thought, let's do something similar but populate the environment with characters you can interact with", and hoped to combine graphics and a text-based system that allowed for players to converse with characters in the game.|$|E
2500|$|The New Republic writer Ruth Franklin {{said that}} [...] "The show's {{method is to}} take us {{behind the scenes of}} the {{branding}} of American icons—Lucky Strike cigarettes, Hilton hotels, Life cereal—to show us not how the products themselves were created, but how their 'very sexy … very magical' images were dreamed up." [...] She {{went on to say that}} [...] "In this way, we are all Don Drapers, obsessed with selling an image rather than tending to what lies underneath. Draper's fatal flaw is his lack of psychological awareness: He is at once perfectly tuned into the desires of America and entirely out of touch with his own character". One reviewer said that [...] "Identity is a key theme in Mad Men, <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>is</b> ever quite who they appear to be. Each one is filled with thwarted ambitions and frustrated dreams, none more so than Don Draper himself, whose closet, it's gradually revealed over Seasons 1 and 2, is filled with proverbial skeletons." ...|$|E

2500|$|From {{the start}} of the series, the lack of a {{relationship}} with her father serves as motivation for Erica's actions. She {{is an example of the}} Nixon staple of the [...] "lost daddy's girl." [...] Eric abandons her and her mother before {{the start of}} the show, when Erica is nine years old. As a result, she develops a severe abandonment complex. Since Eric leaves his family for a successful career in Hollywood, Erica also longs for a life of fame and a successful man. This motivation is maintained in the character decades into the series. [...] "Susan added a lot of Erica's background," [...] Behr said. [...] "Rather than playing it as if Erica's just a rotten character, she added the pathos of this child who was deserted by her father. Every time she did a scene about how 'My father loves me. I know that he loves me <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>is</b> going to tell me differently,' she colored it with the knowledge that she had really been deserted. It worked so well that the writers reached the point where they said we have to play this out." [...] In 1989, the Eric Kane character makes his first appearance as Erica goes in search of him and finds him working as a clown at a circus. She attempts to help him out of his current circumstances, but he ends up betraying her and leaving Pine Valley.|$|E
2500|$|With six laps {{remaining}} in the Bojangles' Southern 500, Busch cut a tire and subsequently caused a wreck that involved not only his car but also Ryan Newman. When leaving his pit (directly in front of Newman), Busch did a burnout and sped next to where crew members and NASCAR officials where standing. Following {{the conclusion of the}} race, while entering pit road, Busch bumped Newman's car. Busch explained the incident as an accident and unrelated, caused by taking his helmet off and not seeing where he was going. Andrew Rueger, Newman's gas man, went after Busch following the race. This turned into a heated argument, accidentally knocking over a NASCAR official. Newman, giving an interview to Sports Illustrated, was quoted as saying, [...] "It's easy to say that Kurt blew a fuse again, I'm not sure why he did it and tried to run over our guys and NASCAR officials. <b>And</b> <b>nobody</b> <b>is.</b> I think the chemical imbalance speaks for itself. Kurt drilled me in pit lane and said that he was taking his helmet off, and he didn't see where he was going. I'm pretty sure there were 42 other guys that are taking their helmets off and doing whatever for the last 10 years, and that's the first time that's happened to me." [...] On May 15, 2012, NASCAR announced that Busch had been fined $50,000 and placed on probation until July 25, 2012 for [...] "reckless driving on pit road during the race" [...] and for being [...] "involved in an altercation with another competitor after the completion of the race." ...|$|E
