5|$|Beta decay (and {{electron}} capture): {{these processes}} are {{regulated by the}} weak force, and result from a transformation of a neutron into a proton, or a proton into a neutron. The neutron to proton transition is accompanied by the emission of an electron and an <b>antineutrino,</b> while proton to neutron transition (except in electron capture) causes the emission of a positron and a neutrino. The electron or positron emissions are called beta particles. Beta decay either increases or decreases the atomic number of the nucleus by one. Electron capture is more common than positron emission, because it requires less energy. In this type of decay, an electron is absorbed by the nucleus, rather than a positron emitted from the nucleus. A neutrino is still emitted in this process, and a proton changes to a neutron.|$|E
5|$|With Murray Gell-Mann, Feynman {{developed}} {{a model of}} weak decay, which showed that the current coupling in the process {{is a combination of}} vector and axial currents (an example of weak decay is the decay of a neutron into an electron, a proton, and an <b>antineutrino).</b> Although E. C. George Sudarshan and Robert Marshak developed the theory nearly simultaneously, Feynman's collaboration with Murray Gell-Mann was seen as seminal because the weak interaction was neatly described by the vector and axial currents. It thus combined the 1933 beta decay theory of Enrico Fermi with an explanation of parity violation.|$|E

25|$|By {{emitting}} {{an electron}} and an electron <b>antineutrino,</b> {{one of the}} neutrons in the carbon-14 atom decays to a proton and the carbon-14 (half-life of 5700 ± 40 years) decays into the stable (non-radioactive) isotope nitrogen-14.|$|E
25|$|Because antineutrinos and neutrinos are neutral particles, it is {{possible}} that they are the same particle. Particles that have this property are known as Majorana particles, after the Italian physicist Ettore Majorana who first proposed the concept. For the case of neutrinos this theory has gained popularity as it can be used, in combination with the seesaw mechanism, to explain why neutrino masses are so small compared to those of the other elementary particles, such as electrons or quarks. Majorana neutrinos have the property that the neutrino and <b>antineutrino</b> could be distinguished only by chirality; what experiments observe as a difference between the neutrino and <b>antineutrino</b> could simply be due to one particle with two possible chiralities.|$|E
25|$|In 2001, the LSND {{experiment}} {{observed a}} 3.8σ excess of <b>antineutrino</b> interactions in neutrino oscillations, which contradicts the standard model. First {{results of the}} more recent MiniBooNE experiment appeared to exclude this data above an energy scale of 450 MeV, but they had checked neutrino interactions, not <b>antineutrino</b> ones. In 2008, however, they reported an excess of electron-like neutrino events between 200–475 MeV. And in 2010, when carried out with antineutrinos (as in LSND), the result was {{in agreement with the}} LSND result, that is, an excess at the energy scale from 450–1250 MeV was observed. Whether those anomalies can be explained by sterile neutrinos, or whether they indicate Lorentz violations, is still discussed and subject to further theoretical and experimental researches.|$|E

40|$|Neutrinos and <b>antineutrinos</b> {{are ideal}} for probing the weak force because it is {{effectively}} the only force they feel. How were they made? Protons fired into a metal target produce a tangle of secondary particles. A magnetic horn like this one, invented by Simon Van der Meer, selected pions and focused them into a sharp beam. Pions decay into muons and neutrinos or <b>antineutrinos.</b> The muons were stopped in a wall of 3000 tons of iron and 1000 tons of concrete, leaving the neutrinos or <b>antineutrinos</b> to reach the Gargamelle bubble chamber. A simple change of magnetic field direction on the horn flipped between focusing positively- or negatively-charged pion beams, and so between neutrinos and <b>antineutrinos...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{positron}} quickly {{finds an}} electron, and they annihilate each other. The two resulting gamma rays (γ) are detectable. The neutron {{can be detected}} by its capture on an appropriate nucleus, releasing a gamma ray. The coincidence of both events – positron annihilation and neutron capture – gives a unique signature of an <b>antineutrino</b> interaction.|$|E
25|$|For each neutrino, {{there also}} exists a {{corresponding}} antiparticle, called an <b>antineutrino,</b> {{which also has}} half-integer spin and no electric charge. They are distinguished from the neutrinos by having opposite signs of lepton number and chirality. To conserve total lepton number, in nuclear beta decay, electron neutrinos appear together with only positrons (anti-electrons) or electron-antineutrinos, and electron antineutrinos with electrons or electron neutrinos.|$|E
25|$|In 2010, MINOS {{reported}} {{differences between}} the disappearance (and thus the masses) of neutrinos and antineutrinos at the 2.3 sigma level. This would violate CPT symmetry and Lorentz symmetry. However, in 2011 MINOS updated their <b>antineutrino</b> results, reporting that the difference is not as great as initially expected, after evaluating further data. In 2012, they published a paper in which they reported that the difference is now removed.|$|E
40|$|The {{work has}} been devoted to the search of the {{electronic}} <b>antineutrinos</b> flux from Sun which is forecasted in the model for spin-flavour neutrinos precession. For this purpose the analysis of the experimental data obtained on the large underground scintillation plants LSD and LVD has been performed. The best upper limit for relation of the electronic <b>antineutrinos</b> flux to the boric neutrinos flux from the Sun has been determined: 1, 7 % on the 90 %-level of the reliability. The obtained result permits to apply a number of the limitations to the parameters of the model for spin-flavour neutrinos precessions. The possible background sources imitating the <b>antineutrinos</b> events under ground have been studied. It has been confirmed that the neutrons generated by the muons of the cosmic rays can give the significant background in the experiments on the recording of the <b>antineutrinos</b> fluxes under ground.

5000|$|Recent {{experiments}} such as neutrino oscillation, however, {{have shown}} that neutrinos have a non-zero mass, which is not predicted by the Standard Model and suggests new, unknown physics. This unexpected mass explains neutrinos with right-handed helicity and <b>antineutrinos</b> with left-handed helicity: since they do not move {{at the speed of}} light, their helicity is not relativistic invariant (it is possible to move faster than them and observe the opposite helicity). Yet all neutrinos have been observed with left-handed chirality, and all <b>antineutrinos</b> right-handed. Chirality is a fundamental property of particles and is relativistic invariant: it is the same regardless of the particle's speed and mass in every reference frame. The question, thus, remains: can neutrinos and <b>antineutrinos</b> be differentiated just by chirality? Or do right-handed neutrinos and left-handed <b>antineutrinos</b> exist as separate particles? ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{indices of}} this {{effective}} Hamiltonian take the six values A, B = e, μ, τ, , , , for neutrinos and <b>antineutrinos.</b> The lowercase indices indicate neutrinos (a, b = e, μ, τ), and the barred lowercase indices indicate <b>antineutrinos</b> ( [...] , [...] = , , [...] ).

25|$|Antineutrinos are {{produced}} in nuclear beta decay {{together with a}} beta particle, in which, e.g., a neutron decays into a proton, electron, and <b>antineutrino.</b> All antineutrinos observed thus far possess right-handed helicity (i.e. {{only one of the}} two possible spin states has ever been seen), while neutrinos are left-handed. Nevertheless, as neutrinos have mass, their helicity is frame-dependent, so it is the related frame-independent property of chirality that is relevant here.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} in 1911 that electrons emitted in beta decay have a continuous {{rather than a}} discrete spectrum appeared to contradict conservation of energy, under the then-current assumption that beta decay is the simple emission of an electron from a nucleus. This problem was eventually resolved in 1933 by Enrico Fermi who proposed the correct description of beta-decay as the emission of both an electron and an <b>antineutrino,</b> which carries away the apparently missing energy.|$|E
25|$|The {{processes}} {{during which}} two neutrinos (or antineutrinos) are emitted {{is known as}} two-neutrino double beta decay. If the neutrino is a Majorana particle (meaning that the <b>antineutrino</b> and the neutrino are actually the same particle), {{and at least one}} type of neutrino has non-zero mass (which has been established by the neutrino oscillation experiments), then it is possible for neutrinoless double beta decay to occur. In the simplest theoretical treatment, known as light neutrino exchange, the two neutrinos annihilate each other, or equivalently, a nucleon absorbs the neutrino emitted by another nucleon.|$|E
50|$|A more {{recently}} built and much larger KamLAND detector used similar techniques to study oscillations of <b>antineutrinos</b> from 53 Japanese nuclear power plants.

50|$|The two light flashes {{associated}} with the positron and the neutron are coincident in time and in space, which provides a powerful method to reject single-flash (non-antineutrino) background events in the liquid scintillator. <b>Antineutrinos</b> produced in man-made nuclear reactors overlap in energy range with geologically produced <b>antineutrinos</b> and are also counted by these detectors.|$|R
25|$|It is {{possible}} that their counterparts (right-handed neutrinos and left-handed <b>antineutrinos)</b> simply do not exist. If they do, their properties are substantially different from observable neutrinos and <b>antineutrinos.</b> It is theorized that they are either very heavy (on the order of GUT scale—see Seesaw mechanism), {{do not participate in}} weak interaction (so-called sterile neutrinos), or both.|$|R
25|$|It is {{very hard}} to uniquely {{identify}} neutrino interactions among the natural background of radioactivity. For this reason, in early experiments a special reaction channel was chosen to facilitate the identification: the interaction of an <b>antineutrino</b> with one of the hydrogen nuclei in the water molecules. A hydrogen nucleus is a single proton, so simultaneous nuclear interactions, which would occur within a heavier nucleus, don't need to be considered for the detection experiment. Within a cubic metre of water placed right outside a nuclear reactor, only relatively few such interactions can be recorded, but the setup is now used for measuring the reactor's plutonium production rate.|$|E
25|$|Tritium, or hydrogen-3, {{with one}} proton and two neutrons, was {{produced}} by proton and neutron collisions {{in the early universe}} as well, but it has since radioactively decayed to helium-3. Modern tritium cannot be explained by big bang nucleosynthesis because of tritium's short half-life of 12.3 years. Today's tritium concentration is instead governed by nuclear reactions and cosmic rays. The radioactive beta decay of tritium to helium releases an electron and an <b>antineutrino,</b> with an average energy release of 18.6 MeV. It {{is important to note that}} this is classified as a relatively weak beta reaction, so the radioactivity cannot permeate skin. Tritium is thus only hazardous if directly ingested or inhaled.|$|E
25|$|As more {{types of}} mesons were {{discovered}} in accelerator experiments later, it was eventually found that the mu meson significantly differed {{not only from the}} pi meson (of about the same mass), but also from all other types of mesons. The difference, in part, was that mu mesons did not interact with the nuclear force, as pi mesons did (and were required to do, in Yukawa's theory). Newer mesons also showed evidence of behaving like the pi meson in nuclear interactions, but not like the mu meson. Also, the mu meson's decay products included both a neutrino and an <b>antineutrino,</b> rather than just one or the other, as was observed in the decay of other charged mesons.|$|E

25|$|Muons are {{unstable}} elementary {{particles and}} are heavier than electrons and neutrinos but lighter {{than all other}} matter particles. They decay via the weak interaction. Because leptonic family numbers are conserved {{in the absence of}} an extremely unlikely immediate neutrino oscillation, one of the product neutrinos of muon decay must be a muon-type neutrino and the other an electron-type <b>antineutrino</b> (antimuon decay produces the corresponding antiparticles, as detailed below). Because charge must be conserved, one of the products of muon decay is always an electron of the same charge as the muon (a positron if it is a positive muon). Thus all muons decay to at least an electron, and two neutrinos. Sometimes, besides these necessary products, additional other particles that have no net charge and spin of zero (e.g., a pair of photons, or an electron-positron pair), are produced.|$|E
