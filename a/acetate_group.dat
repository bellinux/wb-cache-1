2500|$|Cyproterone acetate was {{developed}} to overcome this problem. It is formed by adding an <b>acetate</b> <b>group</b> to cyproterone, see figure 3. Cyproterone acetate has a dual mode of action as it competes directly with DHT for binding to AR, but also inhibits gonadotropin secretion. It thereby reduces androgen, estrogen and LH levels. Cyproterone acetate acts both directly as an antiandrogen in prostate cancer cells and also functions to indirectly decrease serum testosterone levels. The latter causes the limitations of cyproterone acetate, which are central effects on androgen secretion, with subsequent loss of libido and sexual potency. Several reports also state that cyproterone acetate causes liver hyperplasia. These side effects gave pharmaceutical companies the incentive to search for alternative, [...] "pure" [...] NSAAs {{that would not have}} these side effects. [...] Pure antiandrogens block the androgen receptor without exerting any agonistic or any other hormonal activity.|$|E
