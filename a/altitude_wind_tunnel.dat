While at Langley, he directed important aerodynamic research which led to increased high-speed performance of most of the combat aircraft of World War II. In 1944 he joined the High-Speed panel and advocated the supersonic wind tunnel, completed in 1949. Following World War II, Silverstein was responsible for the conception, design, and construction of America's first supersonic propulsion wind tunnels. The investigations in these facilities greatly contributed to the development of supersonic aircraft. He also directed research in propulsion aerodynamics in the <b>Altitude</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>Tunnel</b> that led to significant improvements in both reciprocating and early turbojet aircraft engines.

40|$|AIAA 2005 - 658 : Fifty years ago, the {{phenomenon}} of spongy icing was well-known to the in-flight icing community. Subsequently, it has been forgotten by aerodynamicists, although atmospheric scientists and marine scientists have continued to investigate it. In this paper, its occurrence is documented in two icing <b>wind</b> tunnels: the <b>Altitude</b> Icing <b>Wind</b> <b>Tunnel</b> located at the National Research Council Canada, and the CIGELE Atmospheric Icing Research <b>Wind</b> <b>Tunnel</b> located at the Universit 9 du Qu 9 bec 0 Chicoutimi. Several dozen trials were undertaken in each icing <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> using a NACA 0012 airfoil.

50|$|The Gun Tunnel is an {{intermediate}} <b>altitude</b> hypersonic <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{that can be}} configured to produce hypersonic flows at roughly 30 to 40 km altitude. This uses a piston for isentropic compression.

Using a piston can be very tricky due to reflecting of shocks. At the facility, they use alluminium diaphragm to produce shocks and paper diaphragm to avoid shocks and pass through the hypersonic chamber.

40|$|Simulations of {{supercooled}} {{large droplet}} (SLD) icing environments within the NRC's <b>Altitude</b> Icing <b>Wind</b> <b>Tunnel</b> (AIWT) {{have been performed}} in which broad band mass distribution spectra are achieved that include a distinct pattern of liquid water content (LWC) over a range of droplet sizes (i. e., bi-modal distribution).

Results of spray profile distributions measured in the test section have demonstrated that freezing drizzle conditions, where MVD is either less than or greater than 40 3 ̆bcm, can be achieved. Work performed to provide freezing rain conditions is also discussed and highlights the challenges of providing this environment {{as a result of}} limitations of the spray system in providing the large droplet sizes (up to 1 mm diameter) or where gravitational settling of these larger drops prevents them from reaching the test section.

40|$|AIAA 2001 0094 : An {{overview}} of the icing cloud characteristics needed to simulate in-flight icing is presented. The wider range of conditions that result from the need to test at sub-scale conditions in a <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> are shown to create additional challenges for icing <b>wind</b> <b>tunnels,</b> over and above those that are encountered in nature. A {{detailed description of the}} NRC <b>Altitude</b> Icing <b>Wind</b> <b>Tunnel</b> (AIWT) is presented, providing background information for the discussion of recent calibrations, flow quality surveys and icing cloud investigations. The instrumentation used for these studies is described and individual measurement uncertainties are documented. The aerodynamic calibration began with measurements of total and static pressure corrections. This was followed by planar surveys of the flow quality in the test section. The calibrations were conducted at sea-level conditions. The effects on test section flow quality of spraying air through the settling chamber spray bars are documented. Spray air generally impacts the flow quality by modifying the velocity uniformity and flow angularity. Surveys of the icing cloud consisted of droplet size calibration, liquid water content (LWC) uniformity and LWC calibration. From these studies, {{it was found that the}} AIWT has acceptable LWC uniformity. New spray bars, under development at this time, should improve the icing cloud uniformity even further. Preliminary investigations of a single prototype spray bar in the AIWT show improved spray on-off transients and greater uniformity in LWC distribution. Future investigations are planned to identify the cause of reduced flow quality near the starboard wall of the test section. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

40|$|A {{test was}} {{conducted}} at NASA Icing Research Tunnel to evaluate altitude scaling methods for thermal ice protection system. Two new scaling methods based on Weber number were compared against a method based on Reynolds number. The results generally agreed with the previous set of tests conducted in NRCC <b>Altitude</b> Icing <b>Wind</b> <b>Tunnel</b> where the three methods of scaling were also tested and compared along with reference (altitude) icing conditions. In those tests, the Weber number-based scaling methods yielded results much closer to those observed at the reference icing conditions than the Reynolds number-based icing conditions. The test in the NASA IRT used a much larger, asymmetric airfoil with an ice protection system that more closely resembled designs used in commercial aircraft. Following the trends observed during the AIWT tests, the Weber number based scaling methods resulted in smaller runback ice than the Reynolds number based scaling, and the ice formed farther upstream.

40|$|NRC has {{developed}} an original, three-dimensional icing modelling capability, called the 2 ̆ 01 cmorphogenetic 2 ̆ 01 d approach, based on a discrete formulation and simulation of ice formation physics. Morphogenetic icing modelling improves on existing ice accretion models {{in that it is}} capable of predicting simultaneous rime and glaze ice accretions and ice accretions with variable density and complex geometries. To partially validate the model, we have performed laboratory experiments of ice accretions on a NACA 0012 swept wing in the NRC <b>Altitude</b> Icing <b>Wind</b> <b>Tunnel</b> (AIWT). Ice shapes were recorded and analysed for 300 and 450 sweep angles and for a range of airflow and icing conditions. The swept wing configuration was chosen because it is the most challenging case for all numerical predictive models. The objective {{of this paper is to}} compare model and experimental ice predictions on a swept wing, including complex three-dimensional features such as lobster tails. The results show that the morphogenetic approach can produce realistic simulations of both the overall size/shape and the detailed structure of the ice accretions forming on a swept wing. As far as we know, no other numerical icing model can simulate such three-dimensional ice structure complexity. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} into the fire safety of a wing fuel tank has been performed {{to aid in the}} effort to eliminate or reduce the possibility of a wing fuel tank explosion in a commercial aircraft. A computational model is built to predict the generation of flammable mixtures in the ullage of wing fuel tanks. The model predicts the flammability evolution within the tank based on in-flight conditions of a wing fuel tank. The model is validated through supporting experiments performed in an <b>altitude</b> chamber, the <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> facility as well as data obtained from flight tests. The results from the experiments are compared to the computational results. Computational results from the altitude chamber follow the general trend of the experimental results, but produce them at a different flash point. This is due to the replenishment of species with lower flash point at the surface of the fuel which emulates the flash point of the entire fuel to be lower. Experimental results for the aluminum wing tests from the <b>wind</b> <b>tunnel</b> experiments are in good agreement with the computational results as well. A simpler model is developed from a program that calculates fuel air ratio within the ullage of fuel tanks {{in order to reduce the}} required number of inputs to the model...|$|R
