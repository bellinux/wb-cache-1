5|$|A {{measure of}} William's success in taking control is that, from 1072 until the Capetian conquest of Normandy in 1204, William and his successors were largely {{absentee}} rulers. For example, after 1072, William {{spent more than}} 75 per cent {{of his time in}} France rather than England. While he needed to be personally present in Normandy to defend the realm from foreign invasion <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> internal revolts, he set up royal administrative structures that enabled him to rule England from a distance.|$|E

Timothy played both soccer and ice hockey, while Kate was a ballerina with the State Ballet of Missouri {{by the age}} of ten.

5|$|According to {{the epic}} poem Mahabharata, Krishna becomes Arjuna's charioteer for the Kurukshetra War, {{but on the}} {{condition}} that he personally will not raise any weapon. Upon arrival at the battlefield, and seeing that the enemies are his family, his grandfather, and his cousins and loved ones, Arjuna is moved and says his heart will not allow him to fight and kill others. He would rather renounce the kingdom <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> his Gandiv (Arjuna's bow). Krishna then advises him about the nature of life, ethics, and morality when one is faced with a war between good and evil, the impermanence of matter, the permanence of the soul and the good, duties and responsibilities, the nature of true peace and bliss and the different types of yoga to reach this state of bliss and inner liberation. This conversation between Krishna and Arjuna is presented as a discourse called the Bhagavad Gita.|$|E

5|$|After the Armistice in November 1918, Strachwitz was repatriated and {{returned}} to a Germany in civil turmoil. He travelled to Berlin via Konstanz, at the Swiss–German border, and Munich. On his journey he saw many former German soldiers whose military discipline had broken down. Unable to tolerate this situation and fearing a Communist revolution, he travelled on to Berlin, arriving at the Berlin Anhalter Bahnhof where he was met by a friend. Strachwitz had called ahead asking his friend to bring him his Gardes du Corps uniform, which he put on immediately. Berlin {{was in a state}} of revolution. The newly established provisional government under the leadership of Chancellor Friedrich Ebert was threatened by the Spartacist uprising of the German Revolution, whose ambition was a Soviet-style proletarian dictatorship. Ebert ordered the former soldiers, organized in Freikorps (paramilitary organizations) among them Strachwitz, to attack the workers <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> the uprising.|$|E
5|$|These {{rapid changes}} raised {{tensions}} between officers and their charges, and over thirty sailors {{were arrested in}} early December and accused of planning a new rebellion—which led to that feared second rebellion.

Shortly after, the marine infantry battalion at the naval facilities on Ilha das Cobras revolted. The government acted quickly <b>and</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> both rebellions, but they caused the Brazilian Congress to declare that Rio de Janeiro {{was in a state of}} siege, thereby giving President Fonseca a suite of tools to combat the unrest. The vote was nearly unanimous; the only vote against came from Rui Barbosa.|$|E
