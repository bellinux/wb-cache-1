500|$|Most of Ravel's piano {{music is}} {{extremely}} difficult to play, and presents pianists with a balance of technical and artistic challenges. Writing of the piano music the critic Andrew Clark commented in 2013, [...] "A successful Ravel interpretation is a finely balanced thing. It involves subtle musicianship, a feeling for pianistic colour <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> lightly worn virtuosity that masks the advanced technical challenges he makes in Alborada del gracioso... and the two outer movements of Gaspard de la nuit. Too much temperament, and the music loses its classical shape; too little, and it sounds pale." [...] This balance caused a breach between the composer and Viñes, who said that if he observed the nuances and speeds Ravel stipulated in Gaspard de la nuit [...] "Le gibet" [...] would [...] "bore the audience to death". Some pianists continue to attract criticism for over-interpreting Ravel's piano writing.|$|E

Lucile abandons Molara for the charms of Savrola, a character more like Churchill himself.

Savrola himself is described as [...] "vehement, high and daring", <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> man who could [...] "know rest only in action, contentment only in danger, and in confusion find their only peace...

Hitler wanted to bring German Catholics into the volksgemeinschaft, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> terrorist methods used against the Marxist parties, namely the SPD and the KPD-both of which were banned- were not used against the Zentrum and the Bavarian People's Party. Realizing belatedly that being a non-party politician had left him in a weak position regarding the NSDAP, Papen founded a new political party on 5 April 1933 called the League of German Catholics Cross and Eagle, which was intended as a conservative Catholic party that would hold the NSDAP in check while at the same time working with the NSDAP. In a letter to Hitler, Papen argued that his party was no threat to the regime as it intended to enlist Catholic support for the [...] "national revolution" [...] (the NSDAP had trouble winning votes in Catholic areas), to create a [...] "common front" [...] between all the factions of the right, and to end the [...] "misunderstandings" [...] between Roman Catholicism and National Socialism. Both the Zentrum and the Bavarian People's Party declined to merge into Papen's new party while the rival Coalition of Catholic Germans which was sponsored by the NSDAP proved more effective at recruiting German Catholics.|$|E
