5|$|Although Strauss was {{the most}} sought-after {{composer}} of dance music {{in the latter half}} of the 19th century, stiff competition was present in the form of Karl Michael Ziehrer and Émile Waldteufel; the latter held <b>a</b> <b>commanding</b> position in Paris. Phillip Fahrbach also denied the younger Strauss the commanding position of the KK Hofballmusikdirektor when the latter first applied for the post. The German operetta composer Jacques Offenbach, who made his name in Paris, also posed a challenge to Strauss in the operetta field.|$|E

She was promoted to the rank of captain, the highest rank awarded to a woman at that time. She spent some time in Kaunas, before the insurgents were forced to retreat in late June.|$|E
5|$|Lochte's first {{event in}} Rio was the 4×200 meter {{freestyle}} relay, where he swam both the morning heats and the finals.

5|$|Anfield hosted Manchester City in {{the fifth}} round. It {{was the start of}} a decisive week for Liverpool, as they faced Roma midweek in the UEFA Cup, then Birmingham City in the 2001 Football League Cup Final. Liverpool were awarded a penalty after five minutes, as goalkeeper Nicky Weaver fouled Vladimír Šmicer inside the 18-yard box. Jari Litmanen {{converted}} the spot kick to give Liverpool the lead, which quickly became 2–0 when Heskey's shot found its way past Weaver. Andrei Kanchelskis' goal in the 28th minute halved the scoreline, but Šmicer and Markus Babbel each scored in the second half to put Liverpool in <b>a</b> <b>commanding</b> lead. City persisted and in stoppage time scored their second goal of the match; Shaun Goater's deflected shot did enough to beat goalkeeper Sander Westerveld.|$|E

5000|$|Zoom Schwartz Profigliano, {{also known}} as figliano, is a verbal [...] "tag" [...] {{drinking}} game with many variations. One player at a time is active ("it"). The active player states <b>a</b> <b>command</b> from <b>a</b> predefined set of words, which typically include [...] "zoom," [...] "schwartz," [...] and [...] "profigliano." [...] The command shifts active status to another player, 'tagging' them. Play continues until a player fouls by giving <b>a</b> <b>command</b> when not active, by failing to give <b>a</b> <b>command</b> promptly when active, {{or in some cases}} by giving <b>a</b> <b>command</b> which is prohibited by {{the current state of the}} game. The game lends itself to bluffing where the active player uses nonverbal communication to suggest that someone else is active. In a high-speed game a player might give <b>a</b> <b>command</b> passing active status to one player while looking at a different player, confusing the situation.|$|R

5|$|Nguyễn Ánh {{began by}} {{deploying}} his expanded and modernised naval fleet in raids against coastal Tây Sơn territory. His fleet left Saigon and sailed northward {{on an annual}} basis during June and July, carried by southwesterly winds. The naval offensives were reinforced by infantry campaigns. His fleet would then return south when the monsoon ended, on the back of northeasterly winds. The large European wind-powered vessels gave the Nguyễn navy <b>a</b> <b>commanding</b> artillery advantage, as they had a superior range to the Tây Sơn cannons on the coast. Combined with traditional galleys and a crew that was highly regarded for its discipline, skill and bravery, the European-style vessels in the Nguyễn fleet inflicted hundreds of losses against the Tây Sơn in 1792 and 1793.|$|E
5|$|Pathan {{made his}} name in Tests on the December tour to Bangladesh.

He followed this with a match haul of 7/118 in the following match in Chittagong to take 18 wickets at 11.88 to be named as man of the series. India swept the series, winning both matches by an innings. Although the Indian batsmen scored heavily, Pathan managed only five and four.

40|$|We {{present a}} formal {{approach}} for modeling complex commands characterized by heavy overloading of function, {{large numbers of}} parameters, dependencies among parameters, subtle side effects, and lack of abstraction. Complex <b>commands</b> arise in <b>a</b> variety of business settings such as requesting a brokerage order, enrolling in a course, and specifying a product order. In addition, complex commands are also prevalent where specification of commands is strictly separated from multiple, independent implementations as in open software standards. Our approach {{is based on an}} inheritance structure known as <b>a</b> <b>command</b> lattice. Like other forms of inheritance, command lattices support incremental definition and abbreviation of specifications. Because <b>a</b> complete <b>command</b> lattice can have a large number of specifications, we develop another structure known as <b>a</b> minimal <b>command</b> tree in which <b>a</b> <b>command</b> lattice is derived from a much smaller number of independent specifications. To map from <b>a</b> minimal <b>command</b> tree to <b>a</b> <b>command</b> lattice, we present algorithms that materialize an arbitrary node of <b>a</b> <b>command</b> lattice and compactly generate the behavior of <b>a</b> <b>command</b> lattice. To demonstrate the potential of command lattices, we have implemented a set of tools that provide convenient specification and powerful reasoning capabilities.
