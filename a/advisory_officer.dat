40|$|This paper {{represents}} part of {{a research}} on the economic and human aspects of farm development on Banks Peninsula. The aim is to allocate <b>advisory</b> <b>officers</b> to districts {{in such a way}} as to maximise the response in national farm efficiency. In this problem both human and economic factors have to be considered. The profitability to the nation and to the individual farmer are obviously important and this is reported here. Equally important is the rate at which farmers are likely to adopt the development programme advocated by <b>advisory</b> <b>officers...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the problem of providing farm advisory services to New Zealand farmers. Its aim is to determine a number of acceptable sets of locations for farm <b>advisory</b> <b>officers,</b> who are employed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to service farmers. In doing so the facilities which are to be spatially located are the offices from which the advisors operate. The location plans produced by this research apply to the year 1977. The paper is divided into three sections. Firstly the system of providing farm advisory services is described and the problem of locating farm <b>advisory</b> <b>officers</b> throughout the country is defined in detail. Then follows an explanation of the model which was used to represent the system and of the methodology which was applied to the model in order to solve the problem. Finally, the results produced by the solution technique are presented and are evaluated by comparing them with a plan put forward by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries. The study also incorporates the examination of a number of policy alternatives...|$|R

This consultancy project provided supporting information by assessing the soil characteristics and their suitability {{for a variety of}} crops and provided recommendations for profitable and sustainable land management. This project generated a number of soil evaluation products that assisted with providing consolidated information and transfer of knowledge to assist with improved land use decision making for policy makers, <b>advisory</b> <b>officers,</b> and farmers. The products included: soil data for 24 soil types, maps, soil identification key, field manual for soil type identification (in English and Malay), toposequence cross-sections, database and land information system, land evaluation calculator, suitability assessment for 69 crops, acid sulfate soil identification, fertilizer and lime calculator, and identification of management options.

After graduating from the University of Nottingham in 1953, she worked in the British Civil Service as an Agricultural <b>Advisory</b> <b>Officer</b> from 1955-1960. She moved to the USA in 1960 under the auspices of a Kellogg Foundation Fellowship to study Genetics and Statistics at Iowa State University. She married quantitative geneticist James F.

From 1973 to 1984 she pursued independent research into a number of anomalous genetic phenomena in Drosophila which later lead to collaborative studies resulting in the discovery of hybrid dysgenesis and the isolation of transposable P elements. After appointment as Professor of Biology at Brown University in 1984 she moved to the University of Arizona in 1985 as Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. Additional positions included Chair of the Interdisciplinary Genetics Program from 1988-1991 and Head of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology from 1992-1997.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{investigate}} some of the farm management implications of export hogget production on lower North Island Hill country farms {{from the perspective of}} a Farm <b>Advisory</b> <b>Officer</b> (Economics) operating within the Advisory Services Division (ASD) of the New Zealand Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries (MAF). To establish the context in which the study is set, a brief review of the responsibilities of the Economics Section of ASD is presented as a precursor to developing the institutional and industry requirements of farm management research performed by staff of the Economics Section of ASD. Brief reviews of existing sheep meat production systems, management systems for producing lean meat, and the market requirements for export hogget, indicate limited potential for further expansion of hogget production for export under conditions of relative profitability. Simple feed budgeting/gross margins analysis procedures are used to synthesise and evaluate export hogget production strategies for a range of lower North Island hill country farm types. Schedule prices, for export hogget meat, sufficient to break-even with pre export hogget production strategies are established, and the sensitivity of these break-even schedule prices to a range of management, output, and product price variables is investigated. A highlight of the research approach is an interactive component of the research process, developed from Kelly's (1965) Personal Construct Theory and Woog's (1982) Personal Interaction Model of Extension, in which previously developed models are used as a basis for interactive discussions with farmers. Export hogget production is shown to be feasible, although not necessarily fully compatible with, or desirable under, all existing hill country sheep production systems investigated. Export hogget production appears to have greatest potential appeal to moderately intensive farming systems practised under conditions where summer pasture production is poor, relative to winter grass growth. The over-riding conclusion is that, whilst hogget production may have merit as a means of producing larger, leaner, carcases for export, and whilst current production systems appear capable of producing limited amounts of export hogget, current schedule payments preclude any rational decision to produce hogget for export...|$|E
