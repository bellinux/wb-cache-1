50|$|W-group {{tool steel}} gets {{its name from}} its {{defining}} property of having to be water quenched. W-grade steel is essentially high carbon plain-carbon steel. This group of tool steel is {{the most commonly used}} tool steel because of its low cost compared to others. They work well for small parts and applications where high temperatures are not encountered; above 150 C it begins to soften to a noticeable degree. Its hardenability is low, so W-group tool steels must be subjected to a rapid quenching, requiring the use of water. These steels can attain high hardness (above HRC 66) and are rather brittle compared to other tool steels. W-steels are still sold, especially for springs, but are much less widely used {{than they were in the}} 19th and early 20th centuries. This is partly because W-steels warp and crack much more during quench than oil-quenched or <b>air</b> <b>hardening</b> steels.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{advantages}} and disadvantages of the conventional hot stamping steel and the hot tamping technology were shortly reviewed. It was proposed that new type steel with relative low austenization temperature and <b>air</b> <b>hardening</b> ability should be designed and produced to overcome the surface oxidation and avoid the complexity of cooling system of the stamping dies.

This new steel and corresponding forming technology were called warm stamping technology, which overcomes the disadvantages of the conventional hot stamping steel.

40|$|This study {{studied the}} phase transformations {{occurring}} at different continuous cooling rates in an <b>air</b> <b>hardening</b> steel {{used in the}} rock-crushing industry. Samples of this steel were submitted for calorimetric testing using the differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) technique. In the experimental run, the samples were heated {{at the rate of}} 0. 33 C/s from 50 to 1050 C and equilibrated at this temperature for 900 s, then cooled at seven different cooling rates between 0. 05 and 0. 5 C/s. For all the cooling rates, the DSC traces of the samples showed a first exothermic peak at about 500 C and for samples cooled at rates higher than 0. 15 C/s, a second exothermic peak at about 295 C was observed. From the microstructural investigations carried out by light microscopy (LM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), it was observed that all the samples after DSC treatment were characterized by the presence of bainite. In the samples cooled at rates higher than 0. 15 C/s, martensite was also detected. Comparing the results of DSC and SEM, it was concluded that the first peak at 500 C corresponds to the austenite - bainite transformation, while the second peak at 295 C corresponds to the austenite - martensite transformation. The experimentally determined bainite and martensite start temperatures were compared to the values derived from a number of well-known empirical equations...|$|E
40|$|The main {{objective}} of the research was to enhance steel and aluminum manufacturing {{with the development of}} a new plasma RPD device. During the project (1) plasma devices were manufactured (2) testing for the two metals were carried out and (3) market development strategies were explored. Bayzi Corporation has invented a Rapid Plasma Device (RPD) which produces plasma, comprising of a mixture of ionized gas and free electrons. The ions, when they hit a conducting surface, deposit heat in addition to the convective heat. Two generic models called the RPD-Al and RPD-S have been developed for the aluminum market and the steel market. Aluminum melting rates increased to as high as 12. 7 g/s compared to 3 g/s of the current industrial practice. The RPD melting furnace operated at higher energy efficiency of 65 % unlike most industrial processes operating in the range of 13 to 50 %. The RPD aluminum melting furnace produced environment friendly cleaner melts with less than 1 % dross. Dross is the residue in the furnace after the melt is poured out. Cast ingots were extremely clean and shining. Current practices produce dross in the range of 3 to 12 %. The RPD furnace uses very low power ~ 0. 2 kWh/Lb to melt aluminum. RPDs operate in one atmosphere using ambient air to produce plasma while the conventional systems use expensive gases like argon, or helium in air-tight chambers. RPDs are easy to operate and do not need intensive capital investment. Narrow beam, as well as wide area plasma have been developed for different applications. An RPD was developed for thermal treatments of steels. Two different applications have been pursued. Industrial <b>air</b> <b>hardening</b> steel knife edges were subjected to plasma beam hardening. Hardness, as measured, indicated uniform distribution without any distortion. The biggest advantage with this method is that the whole part need not be heated in a furnace which will lead to oxidation and distortion. No conventional process will offer localized hardening. The RPD has a great potential for heat treating surgical knives and tools. Unavailability of the full amount of the DOE award prevented further development of this exciting technology. Significant progress was made during the 5 th quarter, specially the invention of the wider-area plasma and the resultant benefits in terms of rapid melting of aluminum and thermal treatments of larger size steel parts. Coating of nickel base superalloys was demonstrated (an additional task over that proposed). Directed low cost surface enhancement of steel and the directed clean low dross energy efficient melting of aluminum are industrial needs that require new technologies. These are large volume markets which can benefit from energy savings. Estimated energy savings are very large, in the order of 1015 J/year when the equipment is universally used. Compact and directed heating technology/product market in these two sectors could potentially reach over $ 1 B in sales. The results of the research, presented at the DOE annual Review meeting on Aluminum held at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory during the 4 - 5 October 2005, were very well received by the delegates and panel reviewers. Insufficient DOE funds to fully fund the project at the end of the 5 th quarter necessitated some key tasks being only partially completed...|$|E

50|$|The whole high {{pressure}} {{part of the system}} is manufactured from steel tubing of small diameter, connected to valve control units by Lockheed type pipe unions with special seals made from desmopan rubber, a type of rubber compatible with the LHM fluid.

Height corrector, brake master valve and steering valve spools, and hydraulic pump pistons have extremely small clearances (1-3 micrometres) with their cylinders, permitting only a very low leakage rate.

40|$|The {{low cycle}} fatigue {{behavior}} of polycrystalline NiAl was determined at 300 and 1000 K - temperatures below and above the brittle- to-ductile transition temperature (BDTT). Fully reversed, plastic strain-controlled fatigue tests were conducted on two differently fabricated alloy samples: hot isostatically pressed (HIP'ed) prealloyed powder and hot extruded castings. HIP'ed powder (HP) samples were tested only at 1000 K, whereas the more ductile cast-and-extruded (C+E) NiAl samples were tested at both 1000 and 300 K. Plastic strain ranges of 0. 06 to 0. 2 percent were used. The C+E NiAl cyclically hardened until fracture, reaching stress levels approximately 60 percent greater than the ultimate tensile strength of the alloy. Compared on a strain basis, NiAl had a much longer fatigue life than other B 2 ordered compounds in which fracture initiated at processing-related defects. These defects controlled fatigue life at 300 K, with fracture occurring rapidly once a critical stress level was reached. At 1000 K, above the BDTT, both the C+E and HP samples cyclically softened {{during most of the}} fatigue tests in air and were insensitive to processing defects. The processing method did not have a major effect on fatigue life; the lives of the HP samples were about a factor of three shorter than the C+E NiAl, but this was attributed to the lower stress response of the C+E material. The C+E NiAl underwent dynamic grain growth, whereas the HP material maintained a constant grain size during testing. In both materials, fatigue life was controlled by intergranular cavitation and creep processes, which led to fatigue crack growth that was primarily intergranular in nature. Final fracture by overload was transgranular in nature. Also, HP samples tested in vacuum had a life three times longer than their counterparts tested in air and, in contrast to those tested in <b>air,</b> <b>hardened</b> continuously over half of the sample life, thereby indicating an environmentally assisted fatigue damage mechanism. The C+E samples were tested only in air. At 1000 K, NiAl exhibited a superior fatigue life when compared to most superalloys on a plastic strain basis, but was inferior to most superalloys on a stress basis...|$|R
