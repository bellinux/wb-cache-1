40|$|A low-dextrose-equivalent {{maltodextrin}} {{was investigated}} for application as an enantioselective electrolyte modifier in direct chiral capillary electrophoresis. A {{wide range of}} basic racemic drug substances belonging to different pharmacological groups (antiarrhythmic, anticholinergic, antifungal, antihistaminic, antidepressant and antipsychotic drugs) could be baseline resolved. The background electolyte cation and the anion were found to affect the enantioselectivity significantly. In addition, a definite effect of background electrolyte anion chirality was observed. The use of a single enantiomer background electrolyte could either enhance or completely abolish maltodextrin-mediated chiral separation and in one particular case (<b>aminopromazine)</b> was even sufficient to generate complete enantiomeric resolution. status: publishe...|$|E
