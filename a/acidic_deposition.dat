40|$|Acidification of freshwaters is {{a problem}} of many areas over the {{northern}} hemisphere from the half of the 20 th century. It has been caused by industrial factories discharging emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides, from which originate acids by the photochemical reactions in the atmosphere. <b>Acidic</b> atmospheric <b>deposition</b> has caused disappearance of fish and the most aquatic organisms in streams and lakes. <b>Acidic</b> atmospheric <b>deposition</b> has also washed up not only the buffering basic cations (Ca 2 +, Mg 2 +, Na+, K+), but also toxic aluminium (Al 3 +) ions from soils into the freshwaters. The maximum levels of emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides were observed in 1980 s and since that time the emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides significantly dropped down. However, the recovery from acidification is not as fast as it could be expected. It is impeding by several processes. One of them is hysteresis or saturation of soils by sulfur and nitrogen, which are slowly washing up into the freshwaters in forms of sulfates and nitrates now.

We conducted a statistical comparison of tree growth between the control and pollution treatment groups by using the growth model incorporated the random effects due to the unknown characteristics of each seedling. The variability among seedlings is expressed in this model by the posterior probabilistic distributions of unobserved dry weight of a stem cohort before exposure treatment. The analysis {{of the effects of}} pollution treatment on the stem growth revealed that this treatment decreases the biomass allocation in the current year stems. However, the effects on the relative growth rate of pre-existing stems were unclear. Based on these results, we can speculate that in a polluted environment, the short-term growth of the young stems in the seedlings inhibited by pollution treatment, thereby resulting in the slowdown of long-term biomass accumulation.

40|$|The {{region of}} Moravian-Silesian Beskids {{has been in}} recent years {{affected}} by expressive yellowing of Norway spruce stands, {{which leads to a}} gradual drying and dieback of individual trees. The analysis of stress factors in the region of Silesian Beskids demonstrated a persisting occurrence of predisposition factors whose synergic action has a potential to provoke gradual decline, degradation and dieback of forest stands. The damaging of forest stands is apparently very complex. In the situation when chemical stress adds to climatic stress, the climatic stress assumes the role of predisposition factor. Damages to forest stands occur particularly in locations with exceeded limits of acid deposition critical load. It also follows out from the analysis that climatic stress induced by insufficient precipitation in years 1992, 1993 and 2003 in the studied locality of Silesian Beskids can be considered one of main predisposition factors of health condition worsening and damage to Norway spruce stands with a flat and often disturbed root system e. g. by increased soil acidification, established in upper soil horizons. The analysis of the occurrence of temperature reversals showed that frost shock is one of potential stress factors affecting the health condition of Norway spruce stands in the spring and in the autumn. The process of disturbance manifested by yellowing with the symptoms of chlorosis and necrosis of the youngest needle years is further entered by the synergic action of the ground ozone concentrations and the increasing intensity of UV-A and UV-B radiation. Trigger factors for local defoliation can be for example one-time extreme air temperature fluctuations in early spring or recurrent spells of drought and damage to assimilatory organs of the tree species due to ozone, UV radiation or direct and indirect synergic effect of <b>acidic</b> <b>depositions</b> of hydrogen ions in the soil environment...|$|R

Using the Extended Aerosol Inorganics Model (E-AIM) for HCl, HBr and HNO 3, combined with a simple three-parameter model for HF and HI, we show that equilibrium partitioning of halogen and nitric acids into sulphate particles is maximised at high relative humidity (RH), low temperature, low plume dilution (i. e., near-source) and high SO 42 −/SO 2. The addition of metal chlorides (i. e., NaCl) enhances acidic gas partitioning at high RH, but diminishes acidic gas partitioning at low RH due to a decrease in the water content of particles and the formation of Na sulphate salts. We predict that acidic gas partitioning is quantitatively significant (> 1 %) only in cool humid conditions (e. g., > 80 % RH at 298 K), adding confidence to spectroscopic and/or electrochemical determinations of gas ratios (e. g., SO 2 /HCl, HCl/HF) for volcano monitoring.

The AHM is a semi-distributed model of alpine watersheds that incorporates representations of the major hydrologic and biogeochemical processes that control stream chemical composition. Proxy data of discharge and snowfall were used to develop the necessary inputs for the 47 -year runs. The long-term simulations were stable, but conflicts in the simulation of base cation and silica concentrations indicate that the model has a missing process or misrepresents mineral weathering. Sensitivity analysis of the weathering parameters indicates that a weathering rate of approximately 80 % of the value fitted based on a one-year calibration would match the observed base saturation and the initial one year estimate had incorrect stoichiometry. Additionally, comparison of annual modeled mass flux to observed mass flux indicates that the model overestimates cation and silica export in dry years and underestimates export in wet years.

40|$|The {{response}} of a northeastern U. S. hardwood forest to {{wet and dry}} deposition of hydrogen ion and sulfate deposition was performed using the hydrobiogeochemical, lumped-parameter Terrestrial Aquatic Model for Ecosystems (TAME). Results of model calibration and output stream chemistry show that ion-exchange and mineral dissolution processes in the B and C horizons buffer the <b>acidic,</b> ambient atmospheric <b>deposition</b> [864 eq-SO 4 - 2 /(ha/yr) and 718 eq-H+/(ha/yr) ] in this hydrologically tight and flashy watershed. Watershed response to a 50 % decrease in total deposition of acidity over twenty years indicates that the watershed is linear with respect to sulfate (50 % decrease in mass outflow) but less responsive with respect to acid neutralizing capacity, ANC (11 % increase in stream volume-weighted average ANC concentrations). Only moderate improvements in ANC can be expected from emission controls and decreased sulfate deposition...|$|R
40|$|Distribution of Al-, Fe- and Mn-pools was {{investigated}} in five forest soil profiles (consisting of four horizons) in each of two Hunan catchments (BLT and LKS) where acid deposition has been considered critical. Al- and Fe-pools were higher in BLT than those in LKS, but Mn-pools much lower in BLT. Mn-pools vary from topsoils to bottom soils, but there are different trends for different Mn speciation. Al- and Fe-pools, except amorphous Fe-ox, were positively correlated to contents of soil organic matter (OM) showed by the loss on ignition in the two catchments. Accumulation of Al- and Fe-pools may occur {{in the area where}} soil organic matter was enriched (e. g. in top soil and rhizosphere soil). However, no direct correlation is observed between Mn and OM. <b>Acidic</b> atmospheric <b>deposition</b> may affect transforming among speciations of Al-, Fe- and Mn-pools and leaching of soil Al, Fe and Mn through formation of soluble organo-metal dissolved Al which was potentially toxic, increased. There were significant correlations between Al-pools complexes or change of oxidation-reduction conditions. Mn,, (exchangeable Mn) and Mn,,, (amorphous and organic Mn) were highly linearly correlation with soil pH values at LKS but at BLT. Under acid deposition, the availability of the nutrient Fe increased with the amount of dissolved Al, which was potentially toxic, in the two catchments. There are no significant correlations between Al,, (exchangeable Al) and Mn,, Fe,, (exchangeable Fe) and Mn,, in this work, indicating potentially toxic Mn increase seldom accompanying with Al increase in the two catchments.
