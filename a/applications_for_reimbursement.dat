40|$|The {{prevalence}} {{of use of}} peptic ulcer drugs in the Danish population is described at two points in time using registrations of <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> <b>reimbursement.</b> In 1977 - 81, the {{prevalence of}} use of cimetidine was 0. 4 % in men and 0. 2 % in women. In 1989 - 90, the prevalence of use of peptic ulcer drugs was 1. 3 % in men and 1. 2 % in women. The increase in prevalence was apparent in all age groups, but most pronounced at relatively old age. The median age of users increased from 55 years in 1977 - 81 to 63 years in 1989 - 90. The data indicated {{that a third of}} those who used peptic ulcer drugs in 1977 - 81 also used these drugs in 1989 - 90, conditional on surviving this period. The probability of becoming a long term user was highest for those who were 50 - 69 years in 1977 - 81. The incidence of gastric cancer was investigated in the cohort of persons who used cimetidine in 1977 - 81. An excess risk of gastric cancer was apparent in the first years after start of cimetidine use. This is thought to reflect a selection bias. Significantly increased incidence was also observed in women seven years or longer after start of cimetidine use (RR = 4. 7; 95 % CI: 1. 7 - 10. 3). This estimate was, however, based on only six cases, and a similar pattern was not observed in men...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{assess the}} quality of pharmacoeconomic {{evaluations}} (PEs) submitted with new drug <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> <b>reimbursement</b> and to investigate the role of PEs for coverage decisions in Korea. MethodsForty-seven PEs that were submitted by pharmaceutical companies for coverage decisions between June 2005 and December 2009 were included in this study. To assess their appropriateness {{with regard to the}} PE guidelines, we used the Health Insurance Review and Assessment services (HIRA) checklist consisting of 20 items based on the PE guidelines. We also evaluated the results for coverage decisions, as “recommended,” “recommended with restricted use,” or “not recommended,” based on the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and the range of uncertainty. ResultsOn average, 14 of the 20 items on the HIRA checklist were fulfilled (70. 9 %, range 35. 0 %– 100 %). The compliance rate for the following items was above 70 %: presentation of perspectives and evaluation methods, a sufficient time horizon, and appropriateness of comparators and health outcomes. The compliance rate for the following items was below 70 %: omission of objectives for the study, inappropriate target population, unclear selection process for effectiveness and cost, inappropriate cost estimation, insufficient justification of generalizability, and description of study limitations. The range of incremental cost-effectiveness ratios per quality-adjusted life-years of PEs from a societal perspective varied from dominant to 59 K USD (n = 13) : it consisted of dominant to 28 K USD for “recommended” submissions (n = 6), 8 K to 20 K USD for “recommended with restricted use” submissions (n = 4), and 13 K to 59 K for “not recommended” ones (n = 3). ConclusionsOur study showed that most PEs in this study have reached an adequate level for coverage decisions. Overall barriers associated with a lack of relevant evidence could account for the low compliance rate with specific items in the PE guidelines. PEs with good quality submitted for coverage decisions have played an important role for selecting cost-effective drugs...|$|E

50|$|Richlin Security Service Co. v. Chertoff, , {{was a case}} {{in which}} the Supreme Court of the United States {{evaluated}} standards for awarding attorney's fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act. After it prevailed in a lawsuit for back wages, Richlin filed an <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>reimbursement</b> of fees and expenses from the lawsuit, including 523.8 hours of paralegal work. Richlin requested the paralegal fees at the market rate for the services, rather than at the cost to the law firm that represented Richlin. The Department of Transportation’s Board of Contract Appeals ruled that recovery of fees should be limited to the cost to the attorneys, and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the Board's determination. In an opinion written by Justice Samuel Alito, the Court held that parties are entitled to remibursement for services at prevailing market rates.|$|R

40|$|It is {{a common}} {{occurrence}} for construction contracts to be delayed {{for one reason or}} another. This may be due to neutral event that beyond the control of the contracting parties or due to some act of prevention that cause by the employer or its authorized agent. In some circumstances, contractor requires more working capital and longer duration to accomplish the project is both increased and had to deployed {{over a longer period of}} time. As a result, when the project is prolonged, the contractor has to necessarily sustain cost of his working capital to ensure the contract can be fulfilled over the additional period of delay. Under the general principle of common law, financial loss in the form of interest charges is not recoverable without any express contractual or statutory provisions except claim under special damages. Since there are no express provision under the contract, can the additional interest/ financing charges incurred recoverable under ‘loss and/or expense’ provision? Hence, this research is conducted to reducing the uncertainty and difficulties in the event of recovery of interest/finance charges in the event the project is prolonged and additional working capital is required to sustain the project. This study classified as doctrinal research is an essentially a library-based study. It was found that interest which contractor has suffered during the period between the loss and/or expense being incurred and the making of an <b>application</b> <b>for</b> <b>reimbursement</b> is recoverable. It is also important to serve a notice to the contract administrator to inform the disruption of the regular progress of the work under loss and/or expense clause in the successful recovery of interest/financing charges...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFormal {{economic}} evaluation is playing {{an increasingly important}} role in health-care decision-making. This is shown by the requirement to present economic data to support <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> public <b>reimbursement</b> <b>for</b> new pharmaceuticals in Australia and the provinces of Canada, and by the appraisal process initiated by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in the U. K. This growing role of economic analysis applies {{as much to the}} field of asthma as anywhere. This paper provides a detailed review of applied economic studies in asthma. The review is used to explore a range of methodological issues in the field including the choice of perspective and maximand, whether to use disease-specific or generic measures of outcome and whether decision-makers should receive disaggregated cost and consequence data or results that focus on an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. It is concluded that, given the heterogeneity in decision-makers' objectives and constraints, economic studies should be planned and executed {{in such a way as}} to maximize flexibility in how results are presented...|$|R

40|$|In view of {{increasing}} {{health care costs}} and budgetary problems, a systematic <b>reimbursement</b> decision process <b>for</b> medical technologies becomes an important instrument of allocation. Coverage decisions have monetary impact on patients and service providers, {{and at the same}} time they implicitly decide whether a technology is implemented and more evidence can be gained. In Austria an overall catalogue of outpatient medical care has been worked on and will need a consistent process for maintenance and further development. Within this context, international practice models of reimbursement processes and their features are analyzed so that critical success factors can be derived. Via hand search on websites and in databases, completed by a systematic literature search, <b>application</b> processes <b>for</b> <b>reimbursement</b> of medical interventions and associated literature has been identified. The criterion for including a country/process was the availability of English, German, or French templates/guidelines <b>for</b> external <b>application.</b> The templates were categorized according to the information domains of the EUnetHTA core model, the funding processes were analyzed regarding to phases and characteristics. The following processes have been analyzed: Australia (MSAC), Denmark (mini-HTA), Spain (GANT), Germany (G-BA, KBV innovation service), England (NICE single technology appraisal), France (HAS <b>application</b> form <b>for</b> medical procedures), Switzerland (BAG) and Austria (MEL, OÖGKK). From the 8 identified and specified country models, Germany, France and Switzerland, which are to some degree comparable to the Austrian health care system, and additionally the Austrian pharmaceutical funding process, have been analyzed according to the process phases (topic selection, assessment, appraisal, decision, implementation) and –aspects (structures, decision criteria, dealing with evidence, stakeholder involvement, communication of results, etc.) ...|$|R

40|$|A {{concern to}} contain the costs of {{providing}} equality of access to prescription medicines while preserving health benefits has led most countries to regulate the availability and price of pharmaceuticals. Australia has successfully reduced the price of pharmaceuticals to about 50 to 60 per cent of the world price. However, in the 1980 s utilisation and cost increases led to 6 per cent annual growth in real expenditure. In 1993, Australia became the first country to require economic evaluation in support of <b>applications</b> <b>for</b> listing of new pharmaceuticals <b>for</b> <b>reimbursement.</b> Some {{questions have been raised}} as to whether economic evaluation techniques are capable of ensuring a more rational diffusion of drugs, given the lack of standard methodology for economic appraisal and the ability of economics to make what are essentially political decisions on rationing. The inclusion of cost effectiveness criteria <b>for</b> <b>reimbursement</b> and pricing may slow down the adoption of new, more expensive drugs.
