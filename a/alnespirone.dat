5000|$|... 5-HT1A {{receptor}} partial agonists {{have demonstrated}} efficacy against depression in rodent studies and human clinical trials. Unfortunately, however, their efficacy is limited {{and they are}} only relatively mild antidepressants. Instead of being used as monotherapy treatments, they are more commonly employed as augmentations to serotonergic antidepressants like the SSRIs. It has been proposed that high intrinsic activity at 5-HT1A postsynaptic receptors is necessary for maximal therapeutic benefits to come to prominence, and as a result, investigation has commenced in azapirones which act as 5-HT1A receptor full agonists such as <b>alnespirone</b> and eptapirone. Indeed, in preclinical studies, eptapirone produces robust antidepressant effects which surpass those of even high doses of imipramine and paroxetine.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the new methoxy-chroman 5 -HT 1 A {{receptor}} agonist, <b>alnespirone</b> (S- 20499), on the dopamine systems in the rat brain were assessed in vivo by means of electrophysiological and neurochemical techniques. Cumulative doses of <b>alnespirone</b> (0. 032 – 4. 1 mg kg− 1, i. v.) did not modify the spontaneous firing rate of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra {{as well as in}} the ventral tegmental area. The local application of <b>alnespirone</b> (0. 1 – 10 μM) by reverse microdialysis into the dorsal striatum did not affect the dopamine output but induced a moderate, although dose-independent, increase of 5 -HT (5 -hydroxytryptamine, serotonin) concentrations in the dialysate. As expected of a 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonist, intraperitoneal (i. p.) administration of <b>alnespirone</b> at 2 – 32 mg kg− 1 markedly decreased 5 -HT turnover in the striatum. Parallel measurements of dopamine turnover showed that <b>alnespirone</b> exerted no effect except at the highest dose (32 mg kg− 1, i. p.) for which a significant increase was observed. Interestingly, both alnespirone-induced reduction in 5 -HT turnover and increase in dopamine turnover could be prevented by pretreatment with the selective 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist WAY- 100635 (N-[2 -[4 -(2 -methoxyphenyl) - 1 -piperazinyl]ethyl]–N-(2 -pyridinyl) cyclohexane carboxamide). Altogether, these data indicate that <b>alnespirone</b> does not exert any direct influence on central dopamine systems. The enhanced dopamine turnover due to <b>alnespirone</b> at high dose appeared to result from 5 -HT 1 A receptor stimulation, further supporting the idea that this receptor type may play a key role in 5 -HT-dopamine interactions in brain.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{characterized}} {{the effects of}} the novel, selective, and potent 5 -hydroxytryptamine 1 A (serotonin) (5 -HT 1 A) receptor agonist, <b>alnespirone</b> [S- 20499, (S) -N- 4 -[5 -methoxychroman- 3 -yl) propylamino) butyl- 8 -azaspiro-(4, 5) -diacetamide, hydrochloride] on offensive and defensive resident-intruder aggression in wild-type rats and compared its actions with those of the prototypical full 5 -HT 1 A agonist 8 -hydroxy- 2 -dipropylaminotetralin (8 -OH-DPAT), the partial 5 -HT 1 A agonists ipsapirone and buspirone, and the mixed 5 -HT 1 A/ 1 B agonist eltoprazine. All five agonists exerted effective dose-dependent decreases of offensive aggressive behavior in resident rats; 8 -OH-DPAT was the most potent (ID 50 = 0. 074 mg/kg), followed by eltoprazine (0. 24), buspirone (0. 72), ipsapirone (1. 08), and <b>alnespirone</b> (1. 24). However, in terms of selectivity of the antiaggressive effects as determined by the absence of decrements in social interest and general motor activity, <b>alnespirone</b> appeared to be superior. In the defensive aggression test, neither <b>alnespirone</b> nor any of the other four agonists changed defensive behaviors in the intruder rats. The involvement of 5 -HT 1 A receptors in the antiaggressive actions of these drugs was confirmed by showing that the selective 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist WAY- 100635 (N-[2 -[4 -(2 -methoxyphenyl) - 1 -piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2 -pyridinyl) cyclohexanecarboxamide trihydrochloride), which was inactive alone, fully prevented the antiaggressive effects of <b>alnespirone,</b> 8 -OH-DPAT, and buspirone and partly reversed those of ipsapirone and eltoprazine. The data clearly indicate that <b>alnespirone</b> effectively suppresses offensive aggression with an advantageous profile of action compared with other full or partial 5 -HT 1 A agonists. These selective antiaggressive actions of <b>alnespirone</b> are mediated by stimulating 5 -HT 1 A receptors, presumably the somatodendritic autoreceptors at the raphe nuclei. Furthermore, the data provide evidence for a major involvement of these 5 -HT 1 A receptors in the modulation of aggressive behavior by 8 -OH-DPAT, ipsapirone, buspirone, and eltoprazine. ...|$|E
40|$|Single {{treatment}} with the serotonin (5 -hydroxytryptamine) 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonists 8 -hydroxy- 2 -(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8 -OH-DPAT) and <b>alnespirone</b> (S- 20499) reduces the extracellular 5 -HT concentration (5 -HText) in the rat midbrain and forebrain. Given the therapeutic potential of selective 5 -HT 1 A agonists {{in the treatment}} of affective disorders, we have examined the changes in 5 -HT 1 A receptors induced by 2 -week minipump administration of <b>alnespirone</b> (0. 3 and 3 mg/kg/day) and 8 -OH-DPAT (0. 1 and 0. 3 mg/kg/day). The {{treatment with}} <b>alnespirone</b> did not modify baseline 5 -HText but significantly attenuated the ability of 0. 3 mg/kg s. c. <b>alnespirone</b> to reduce 5 -HText in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and frontal cortex. In contrast, the ability of 8 -OH-DPAT (0. 025 and 0. 1 mg/kg s. c.) to reduce 5 -HText in both areas was unchanged by 8 -OH-DPAT pretreatment. Autoradiographic analysis revealed a significant reduction of [3 H] 8 -OH-DPAT and [3 H]WAY- 100635 { 3 H-labeled N-[2 -[4 -(2 -methoxyphenyl) - 1 -piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-(2 -pyridyl) cyclohexanecarboxamide · 3 HCl} binding to somatodendritic 5 -HT 1 A receptors (but not to postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors) of rats pretreated with <b>alnespirone</b> but not with 8 -OH-DPAT. In situ hybridization analysis revealed no change of the density of the mRNA encoding the 5 -HT 1 A receptors in the DRN after either treatment. These data indicate that continuous treatment for 2 weeks with <b>alnespirone,</b> but not with 8 -OH-DPAT, causes a functional desensitization of somatodendritic 5 -HT 1 A receptors controlling 5 -HT release in the DRN and frontal cortex.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the effects of the systemic administration of the selective 5 -HT 1 A agonist <b>alnespirone</b> (S- 20499) on in vivo 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT) release in the dorsal raphe nucleus, the median raphe nucleus and four forebrain areas innervated differentially by both (dorsal striatum, frontal cortex, ventral hippocampus and dorsal hippocampus). <b>Alnespirone</b> (0. 1 – 3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, s. c.) dose-dependently reduced extracellular 5 -HT in the six areas examined. In forebrain, the maximal reductions occurred in striatum and frontal cortex (maximal reduction to 23 and 29 % of baseline, respectively). Those in dorsal and ventral hippocampus were more moderate (to ca 65 % of baseline). In contrast, the decrease in 5 -HT elicited in the median raphe nucleus was more marked than that in the dorsal raphe nucleus (to ca 30 and 60 % of baseline, respectively). The selective 5 -HT 1 A antagonist WAY- 100635 (0. 5 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, s. c.) prevented the decrease in 5 -HT induced by <b>alnespirone</b> (0. 3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, s. c.) in frontal cortex. 8 -OH-DPAT (0. 025, 0. 1 and 0. 3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, s. c.) also reduced extracellular 5 -HT in a regionally-selective manner (e. g., to 32 % of baseline in striatum and to 69 % in dorsal hippocampus at 0. 1 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, s. c.). In midbrain, 8 -OH-DPAT reduced the dialysate 5 -HT slightly more in the median than in the dorsal raphe nucleus at all doses examined. Doses of both compounds close to their respective ED 50 values (0. 3 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 <b>alnespirone,</b> 0. 025 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 8 -OH-DPAT) reduced 5 -HT to a comparable extent in all regions examined. However, the reductions attained at higher doses were more pronounced for 8 -OH-DPAT. These data show that the reduction of 5 -HT release elicited by <b>alnespirone</b> and 8 -OH-DPAT is more important in forebrain areas innervated by 5 -hydroxytryptaminergic neurones of the dorsal raphe nucleus. This regional selectivity seems unlikely to be accounted for by differences in the sensitivity of 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptors controlling 5 -HT release, given the dissimilar effects of these two 5 -HT 1 A agonists in regions rich in cell bodies and nerve terminals. This suggests the presence of complex mechanisms of control of 5 -HT release by 5 -HT 1 A receptors...|$|E
40|$|To {{elucidate}} the relative contribution of somatodendritic 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptors and postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptor the specific anti-aggressive properties of 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonists, {{the influence of}} the novel benzodioxopiperazine compound S- 15535, which behaves in vivo as a competitive antagonist at postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors and as an agonist at 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptors, upon offensive and defensive aggression was investigated in wild-type rats using a resident-intruder paradigm. S- 15535 exerted a potent dose-dependent decrease in offensive, but not defensive, aggressive behavior (inhibitory dose (ID) (50) = 1. 11 mg/kg). This anti-aggressive profile was roughly {{similar to that of the}} potent pre- and postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A full agonist <b>alnespirone</b> (ID 50 = 1. 24). The drug's profound anti-aggressive actions were not accompanied by sedative side effects or signs of the " 5 HT-(1 A) receptor-mediated behavioral syndrome," which are characteristically induced by prototypical 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonists like 8 -OH-DPAT and buspirone. The selective pre- and postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A antagonist WAY- 100635, which was inactive given alone, abolished the anti-aggressive effects of S- 15535 and <b>alnespirone,</b> thereby confirming the involvement of 5 -HT 1 A receptors. Furthermore, combined administration of S- 15535 and <b>alnespirone</b> elicited an additive anti-aggressive effect, providing further support for somatodendritic 5 -HT 1 A receptor involvement. Finally, the postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A antagonistic properties of S- 15535 were confirmed by showing blockade of the alnespirone-induced hypothermia, a postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A mediated response in the rat. These data provide extensive evidence that the anti-aggressive effects of 5 -HT 1 A receptor agonists are expressed via their action on somatodendritic 5 -HT 1 A autoreceptors, thereby most likely attenuating intruder-activated serotonergic neurotransmission.

40|$|High {{aggression}} is often linked to lowered serotonin (5 -HT) neurotransmission. Although this may hold for high aggression as a trait characteristic of an individual, serotonergic activity is probably increased during performance of aggressive behavior. To test this hypothesis, first, the 5 -HT 1 A agonist <b>alnespirone</b> and gamma aminobutyric acid-A agonist muscimol were administered into the dorsal raphe nucleus. These treatments, which inhibit 5 -HT neuronal activity, {{were shown to}} decrease performance of aggressive behavior. Second, after a resident–intruder test, the activation of 5 -HT neurons (measured by c-fos expression) was increased in high-aggressive rats, compared with low-aggressive rats or control rats that were not subjected to a social confrontation. Results show that performance of aggressive behavior increases 5 -HT neuronal activity and that preventing this activation inhibits expression of aggressive behavior. ...|$|E
40|$|More {{than any}} other brain {{neurotransmitter}} system, the indolamine serotonin (5 -HT) {{has been linked to}} aggression in a wide and diverse range of species, including humans. The nature of this linkage, however, is not simple and it has proven difficult to unravel the precise role of this amine in the predisposition for and execution of aggressive behavior. The dogmatic view that 5 -HT inhibits aggression has dominated both pharmacological research strategies to develop specific and effective novel drug treatments that reduce aggressive behavior and the pharmacological mechanistic interpretation of putative serenic drug effects. Our studies on brain serotonin and aggression in feral wild-type rats using the resident- intruder paradigm have challenged this so-called serotonin deficiency hypothesis of aggressive behavior. The well-known fact that certain 5 -HT 1 A/ 1 B receptor agonists potently and specifically reduce aggressive behavior without motor slowing and sedative effects is only consistent with this hypothesis under the assumption that the agonist mainly acts on the postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A/ 1 B receptor sites. However, systemic injections of anti-aggressive doses of 5 -HT 1 A and 1 B agonists robustly decrease brain 5 -HT release due to their inhibitory actions at somatodendritic and terminal autoreceptors, respectively. The availability of the novel benzodioxopiperazine compound S- 15535, which acts in vivo as a preferential agonist of the somatodendritic 5 -HT 1 A auto-receptor and as an antagonist (weak partial agonist) at postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors, allows for a pharmacological analysis of the exact site of action of this anti-aggressive effect. It was found that, similar to other prototypical full and partial 5 -HT 1 A and/or 5 -HT 1 B receptor agonists like repinotan, 8 -OHDPAT, ipsapirone, buspirone, <b>alnespirone,</b> eltoprazine, CGS- 12066 B and CP- 93129, also S- 15535 very effectively reduced offensive aggressive behavior. Unlike the other ligands, however, a remarkable degree of behavioral specificity was observed after treatment with S- 15535, in that the anti-aggressive effects were not accompanied by inhibiting (like other 5 -HTIA receptor agonist with moderate to high efficacy at postsynaptic 5 -HTIA receptors) or enhancing (like agonists with activity at 5 -HT 1 B receptors and <b>alnespirone)</b> non-aggressive motor behaviors (e. g., social exploration, ambulation, rearing, and grooming) beyond the range of undrugged animals with corresponding levels of aggression. The involvement of 5 -HTIA and/or 5 -HT 1 B receptors in the antiaggressive actions of these drugs was convincingly confirmed by showing that the selective 5 -HT 1 A receptor antagonist WAY- 100635 and/or the 5 -HT 1 B receptor antagonist GR- 127935, while inactive when given alone, effectively attenuated/prevented these actions. Furthermore, combined administration of S- 15535 with either <b>alnespirone</b> or CGS- 42066 B elicited a clear additive effect, indicated by a left-ward shift in their dose-effect curves, providing further support for presynaptic sites of action (i. e., inhibitory somatodendritic 5 -HT 1 A and terminal 5 -HT 1 B autoreceptors). These findings strongly suggest that the specific anti-aggressive effects of 5 -HT 1 A and 5 -HT 1 B receptor agonists are predominantly based on reduction rather than enhancement of 5 -HT neurotransmission during the combative social interaction. Apparently, normal display of offensive aggressive behavior is positively related to rief spikes in serotonergic activity, whereas an inverse relationship probably exists between tonic 5 -HT activity and abnormal forms of aggression only.

40|$|Individual {{differences}} in aggressive behaviour {{have been linked}} to variability in central serotonergic activity, both in humans and animals. A previous experiment in mice, selectively bred for high or low levels of aggression, showed an up-regulation of postsynaptic serotonin- 1 A (5 -HT 1 A) receptors, both in receptor binding and in mRNA levels, in the aggressive line [Brain Res 736 (1996) 338]. The aim of this experiment was to study whether similar {{differences in}} 5 -HT 1 A receptors exist in individuals from a random-bred rat strain, varying in aggressiveness. In addition, because {{little is known about the}} functional consequences of these receptor differences, a response mediated via postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors (i. e., hypothermia) was studied both in the selection lines of mice and in the randomly bred rats. The difference in receptor binding, as demonstrated in mice previously, could not be shown in rats. However, both in rats and mice, the hypothermic response to the 5 -HT 1 A agonist <b>alnespirone</b> was larger in aggressive individuals. So, in the rat strain as well as in the mouse lines, there is, to a greater or lesser extent, an enhanced sensitivity of postsynaptic 5 -HT 1 A receptors in aggressive individuals. This could be a compensatory up-regulation induced by a lower basal 5 -HT neurotransmission, which is in agreement with the serotonin deficiency hypothesis of aggression.
