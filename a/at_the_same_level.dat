5|$|After his {{performance}} for Sandefjord in 2006, Expressen said that Tegström was wanted by several Norwegian, Danish and Dutch clubs, but signed {{a new contract}} with Sandefjord in December 2006 {{to the end of}} the 2009 season. Verdens Gang predicted that the Sandefjord team would finish 11th in the 2007 Tippeligaen, but stated that Tegström had to perform <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>level</b> as in the previous season for Sandefjord to avoid relegation. Tegström scored one goal for Sandefjord in the 2007 season; the team struggled throughout the season until it was relegated to the second tier. Tegström left Sandefjord half-way through the season, when he was sold to Fredrikstad in August 2007 for 4 million Norwegian krone (NOK), according to Sandefjords Blad.|$|E
5|$|Late glacial tool finds {{from the}} Upper Palaeolithic date to c.12,000BP: flint blades known as Cheddar points; smaller bladelets known as Cresswell points; scrapers; burins or lithic flakes; flint and bone awls; and a bone needle. Flint rarely occurs in Wales {{other than in}} drifts, or as small pebbles on beaches. Flint tools would {{therefore}} have to {{have been brought to}} Gower from other areas, such as those now known as southern or eastern England, or Antrim, either as finished tools or as incomplete, or unworked, nodules. Remains of red fox, Arctic fox, brown bear, tundra vole, and possibly reindeer, were found <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>level</b> as the Upper Palaeolithic tools, providing evidence of the climate c.12,000BP. Other animal remains excavated during the 19th century, which may predate the Late glacial finds, include mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, red deer and giant deer.|$|E
5|$|Miniopterus mahafaliensis is a small, short-tailed Miniopterus {{with long}} and dense fur. The fur of the upperparts is brown and {{the hairs on}} the underparts have gray tips. Miniopterus brachytragos is similar in color, but other small Malagasy Miniopterus are darker. The ears are {{partially}} haired above, but virtually naked below and end in a rounded tip. The tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is relatively thick, has the sides mostly parallel, and ends in a curved, rounded tip. The wing membrane is also brown, but the uropatagium (tail membrane) is lighter. The wing membrane and uropatagium are attached to the upper leg <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>level,</b> above the ankle. The uropatagium is relatively densely covered with hairs, particularly on the upper side. M.manavi and M.brachytragos also have a densely haired uropatagium, but in M.aelleni and M.griveaudi it is only sparsely haired or even mostly naked.|$|E

5|$|Miniopterus manavi is a {{diminutive}} species with fur of medium length. The upperparts are blackish or reddish brown. Other small Malagasy Miniopterus are lighter. The ears mostly lack hair and {{end in a}} rounded tip. The tragus (a projection {{on the inner side}} of the outer ear) is thin for most of its length, ends in an angular tip, and has a flange at the medial side (towards the midline of the animal). The tragus is differently shaped in other species. The wings and uropatagium (tail membrane) are blackish and are attached to the upper leg <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>level,</b> above the ankle. The uropatagium is densely haired above and more sparsely below, as in M.mahafaliensis and M.brachytragos; M.griveaudi and M.aelleni have more nearly naked uropatagia.|$|E
5|$|Paul {{joined a}} Manchester City side which {{had just been}} relegated to the Second Division, and were thus playing <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>level</b> as Swansea. Paul made his debut for the club on {{the opening day of}} the 1950–51 season, a 4–2 victory against a Preston North End side {{featuring}} Tom Finney. Manchester City went ten matches unbeaten {{at the start of the}} season, until a 4–3 defeat at Doncaster Rovers, where City blew a 3–0 half-time lead. Paul played in all but one match that season, becoming club captain and helping his club win promotion, as runners-up behind champions Preston. Writer HD Davies, under his pen name Old International, attributed much of City's cohesive play over the season to the addition of Paul to the side.|$|E
5|$|The main {{judicial}} {{officers were}} the Barons of the Exchequer, or barones scaccari, who were originally the same judges {{as those of}} the Court of King's Bench, only becoming independent positions after the Exchequer's separation from the curia regis. In {{the early years of the}} Exchequer's existence, the Barons were the chief auditors of the accounts of England, a role passed to dedicated auditors during the reign of Edward II. With the Exchequer's expansion during the Tudor era, the Barons became more important; where previously only the Chief Baron had been appointed from the Serjeants-at-Law, with the other Barons mere barristers, it became practice for all Barons of the Exchequer to be Serjeants. This further increased the Exchequer's standing, since for the first time it put the Exchequer <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>level</b> as the Court of Common Pleas and Court of King's Bench, where all judges were already required to be Serjeants.|$|E

5|$|The maxilla (upper jaw) {{is known}} only for A.donovani. In these fossils, the back {{margin of the}} incisive foramen (an opening in the palate) is about <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>level</b> as the front of M1, and the back margin of the {{zygomatic}} plate (a bony plate {{at the side of}} the skull, connected to the zygomatic arch) is also close to the front of M1. Mandibles (lower jaws) of both species are known. The mental foramen (an opening in the front of the jaw bone) opens towards the labial side of the bone, except in one mandible of A.praeuniversitatis, in which its opening is located higher. There is a well-developed capsular process—a raising in the bone that houses the root of the lower incisor. The masseteric ridges (two ridges on the labial side of the bone that anchor some of the chewing muscles) are joined into a single crest towards the front and reach to a point below the front of m1.|$|E

The roofover the western platform is curved, and made of wood and glass. There is an underground parking lot in two levels.|$|E
5|$|The {{theological}} {{concerns were}} twofold: first, putting man <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>level</b> as monkeys or apes would lower the spiritually higher position {{that man was}} assumed {{to have in the}} great chain of being, and second, because the Bible says man was created in the image of God (theomorphism), if monkeys/apes and humans were not distinctly and separately designed, that would mean monkeys and apes were created in the image of God as well. This was something many could not accept. The conflict between world views that was caused by asserting man was a type of animal would simmer for a century until the much greater, and still ongoing, creation–evolution controversy began in earnest with the publication of On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin in 1859.|$|E

5|$|Velites did {{not form}} their own units; {{a number of them}} were {{attached}} to each maniple of hastati, principes and triarii. They were typically used as a screening force, driving off enemy skirmishers and disrupting enemy formations with javelin throws before retiring behind the lines to allow the heavier-armed hastati to attack. They were normally the ones who engaged war elephants and chariots if they were present on the field, such as in the Battle of Zama, in 202 BC. Their high mobility and ranged weaponry made them much more effective against these enemies than heavy infantry. An early Roman legion contained approximately 1,000 velites. Velites were eventually disbanded after the Marian reforms. Lucilius suggests that rorarii and velites were interchangeable, with velites gradually superseding rorarii. Another theory is that the leves equipment was upgraded until they were <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>level</b> as the rorarii, and they both collectively became known as the velites.|$|E
5|$|During a flyby on 26 September 2012, Cassinis radar {{detected}} in Titan's northern polar region {{what is likely}} a river with a length of more than 400 kilometers. It has been compared with the much larger Nile river on Earth. This feature is connected to Ligeia Mare. Later, a paper ("Liquid-filled Canyons on Titan") published on Geophysical Research Letters on 9 August 2016 reported about the May 2013 Cassini RADAR altimeter observation of Vid Flumina channels, defined as a drainage network connected to Titan's second largest hydrocarbon sea, Ligeia Mare. Analysis of the received altimeter echoes showed that the channels are located in deep (up to ~570 m), steep-sided, canyons and have strong specular surface reflections that indicate they are currently liquid filled. Elevations of the liquid in these channels are <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>level</b> as Ligeia Mare to within a vertical precision of about 0.7 m, consistent with the interpretation of drowned river valleys. Specular reflections are also observed in lower order tributaries elevated above the level of Ligeia Mare, consistent with drainage feeding into the main channel system. This is likely the first direct evidence {{of the presence of}} liquid channels on Titan and the first observation of hundred-meter deep canyons on Titan. Vid Flumina canyons are thus drowned by the sea {{but there are a few}} isolated observations to attest to the presence of surface liquids standing at higher elevations.|$|E
5|$|Following this event, Zwingli {{and other}} humanist friends petitioned the bishop on 2 July {{to abolish the}} {{requirement}} of celibacy on the clergy. Two weeks later the petition was reprinted for the public in German as Eine freundliche Bitte und Ermahnung an die Eidgenossen (A Friendly Petition and Admonition to the Confederates). The issue was not just an abstract problem for Zwingli, as he had secretly married a widow, Anna Reinhard, earlier in the year. Their cohabitation was well-known and their public wedding took place on 2 April 1524, {{three months before the}} birth of their first child. They would eventually have four children: Regula, William, Huldrych, and Anna. As the petition was addressed to the secular authorities, the bishop responded <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>level</b> by notifying the Zurich government to maintain the ecclesiastical order. Other Swiss clergymen joined in Zwingli's cause which encouraged him to make his first major statement of faith, Apologeticus Archeteles (The First and Last Word). He defended himself against charges of inciting unrest and heresy. He denied the ecclesiastical hierarchy any right to judge on matters of church order because of its corrupted state.|$|E
