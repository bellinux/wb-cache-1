2500|$|Parker's {{father always}} warned him about {{getting into the}} music industry. [...] "My dad always warned me not to choose music as a career. He got quite worried and said [...] "if you do music as your job, as the thing that puts food on the table, then it will {{instantly}} ruin its magic, it won't be mysterious and fun any more, {{it would just be}} like work"." [...] Parker believed what his father had told him, and went on to university for a while, studying engineering. [...] "I wanted to please my dad in a way. I had no idea what I wanted to do, because I didn't enjoy anything other than music." [...] Parker said [...] "I hated it, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> decided to change to astronomy. I knew that I would be poor and I just wanted to do whatever was fun." [...] It was here in an astronomy lecture that Parker saw a slide that he would later paint and turn into the artwork for the Tame Impala EP. However, Parker couldn't give up his original dream. [...] "I was at uni, and a couple of months before we got signed, I had submitted to the reality that I wasn't actually going to be a famous musician and I should just get on with my career. So that was when I started to knuckle down and actually do stuff at uni. But at the same time, I could never passionately give my attention to anything other than music. Like, it was a disease. I {{would not be able to}} listen to a word in lectures because I'd just be thinking about my new song." ...|$|E
2500|$|In his autobiography, Twain writes further of Captain Sellers' use of [...] "Mark Twain": I was a cub pilot on the Mississippi River then, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> wrote a {{rude and}} crude satire which was leveled at Captain Isaiah Sellers, the oldest {{steamboat}} pilot on the Mississippi River, {{and the most}} respected, esteemed, and revered. For many years he had occasionally written brief paragraphs concerning {{the river and the}} changes which it had undergone under his observation during fifty years, and had signed these paragraphs [...] "Mark Twain" [...] and published them in the St. Louis and New Orleans journals. In my satire I made rude game of his reminiscences. It was a shabby poor performance, but I didn't know it, and the pilots didn't know it. The pilots thought it was brilliant. They were jealous of Sellers, because when the gray-heads among them pleased their vanity by detailing in the hearing of the younger craftsmen marvels which they had seen in the long ago on the river, Sellers was always likely to step in at the psychological moment and snuff them out with wonders of his own which made their small marvels look pale and sick. However, I have told all about this in [...] "Old Times on the Mississippi." [...] The pilots handed my extravagant satire to a river reporter, and it was published in the New Orleans True Delta. That poor old Captain Sellers was deeply wounded. He had never been held up to ridicule before; he was sensitive, and he never got over the hurt which I had wantonly and stupidly inflicted upon his dignity. I was proud of my performance for a while, and considered it quite wonderful, but I have changed my opinion of it long ago. Sellers never published another paragraph nor ever used his nom de guerre again.|$|E

6000|$|... "That you've been fooling me!" [...] {{the girl}} interrupted, {{a faint smile}} {{at the corners of}} her lips. [...] "Do you know, {{sometimes}} I suspected that you weren't in earnest! <b>And</b> then <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> saw your wife--and I wasn't sure!" ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the flat}} {{across the hall}} from us lived a lady with a black-and-tan terrier. Her husband strung it and took it out every evening, but he always came home cheerful <b>and</b> whistling. <b>One</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> touched noses with the black-and-tan in the hall, and I struck him for an elucidation.|$|R
60|$|Thus {{the summer}} wore on to early autumn. <b>And</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> was {{standing}} booted and spurred in the stables, Harvey putting the bridle upon Firefly, when my boy Hugo comes running in.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Gentleman was {{too busy}} talking {{to have time to}} get suspicious, but I wasn't; <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> draws Gentleman aside and puts it to him straight. [...] "Gentleman," [...] I says, [...] "Jerry Moore is in love!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{does not}} need many words {{to tell you how}} great a service you have done me. I was caught; in a few minutes the fowlers would have been here--without your help I should have been killed. I am grateful, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> will repay you." ...|$|E
5000|$|She met the {{musician}} Blaqstarr, {{a friend of}} her sister's, and worked with him on her early material after leaving a rap verse on his answering machine. On this process she notes [...] "I used to like to write poetry <b>and</b> stories. <b>One</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> was home, bored, and started to compose songs." ...|$|R
2500|$|In Britain, the Union of Islamic Students' Associations in Europe {{issued a}} {{statement}} offering its services to Khomeini. Despite incitement to murder being illegal in the United Kingdom, one London property developer told reporters, [...] "If I see him, I will kill him straight away.

6000|$|... "No! The Admiral {{did take}} notice of Hal; <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> when <b>I</b> was slow at a proposition, my father said I was too block-headed to beat {{navigation}} into, and that Hal is a smart fellow, worth two of me. I know he is! I know that; only if he would not make such an intolerable crowing--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{my great}} grief this chick {{suddenly}} developed {{a very bad}} temper, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> was obliged to reprove it for grabbing the food away from its brothers. Suddenly it began screaming with anger, and the next moment it sprang on me, digging its sharp claws into my back.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] she {{answered}} slowly, [...] "I would not {{bring him to}} his death, but to life and honour and--love, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> shall be Pharaoh. Only, Asti, if you betray me to him I swear that I will bring you to your death, although you are so dear." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh dear, no!" [...] she returned, {{with her}} frightened glance; [...] "I only {{heard him say}} some people {{preferred}} {{that kind of thing}} to sacred music, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> saw a copy of it in a music-store window in Clay Street, and bought it. Oh no! Tappington didn't teach it to me." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> then, <b>one</b> <b>day,</b> <b>I</b> {{did a very}} foolish thing. We {{had been}} reading together, she and I, as was become our custom. She had fetched me a volume of the lascivious verse of Panormitano, and we {{sat side by side}} on the marble seat in the garden what time I read to her, her {{shoulder}} touching mine, the fragrance of her all about me.|$|R
5000|$|His {{body was}} cremated and his ashes were {{scattered}} in Marrakech, Morocco, in the Majorelle Garden, a residence and botanical garden that he owned with Bergé since 1980 and often visited to find inspiration and refuge.

60|$|I knew Hotten very well, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> {{stood by}} what {{purported to be}} his body, which {{afterward}} I assisted to bury in the cemetery at Highgate. I am {{sure that it was}} his body, for I was uncommonly careful in the matter of identification, for a very good reason, which you shall know.|$|E
6000|$|At length this longing grew {{so strong}} {{on him that}} he could bear it no more; and, calling the fairies together, he said to them: 'Dear wife and sisters, I must leave you for a time, and go out and see the world. But I shall think of you often, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> shall come back to you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|I went {{often to}} look at the {{collection}} of curiosities in Heidelberg Castle, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> surprised the keeper of it with my German. I spoke entirely in that language. He was greatly interested; and after I had talked a while he said my German was very rare, possibly a [...] "unique"; and wanted to add it to his museum.|$|E
60|$|I {{imagined}} {{at first}} that since my teeth were drawn the King despised me, and intended nothing further. But I was soon to be disillusioned on that score. It began with the arrest of Martinez {{on a charge of}} complicity in the murder of Escovedo. <b>And</b> then <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> was again arrested, without warning, and carried off for a while to the fortress of Pinto. Thence I was brought back in close captivity to Madrid, and there I learnt at last what had been stirring.|$|R
40|$|I want {{to start}} with several anecdotes <b>and</b> {{personal}} experiences. <b>One</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> came home from high school and excitedly told Mam-ma (my grandmother Mundy) that President Kennedy intended to put {{a man on the moon}} within ten years. She solemnly responded, “Billy, God will never allow this! Sin is confined t...|$|R
6000|$|Flossie was tacking her {{way towards}} them. Joan acted on impulse. [...] "I wish you'd {{give me your}} address," [...] she said [...] "where I could write to you.

6000|$|A vindictive gleam {{crept into}} the man's eyes. [...] "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I've no use for being bossed by that kind of man, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> up and told him what I thought of him. There was {{considerable}} trouble before I walked out. Anyway, between {{the market and the}} English girl he's married, he's fixed just now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{coming to}} it," [...] ses Bill. [...] "Six months ago I was in Melbourne, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> was strolling about looking {{in at the}} shop-winders, when all at once I thought I see a face I knew.

6000|$|Dora {{could make}} out more to herself in a book than she could read aloud, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> saw her {{spelling}} over the table of degrees of marriage in a great folio Prayer-Book, which she had taken down in quest of pictures. Some time later in the day, she said, [...] "Lucy, are you Harry's father's sister?" [...] and when I said yes, she added, {{with a look of}} discovery, [...] "A man cannot marry his father's sister." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, {{you were}} right in warning me. He must needs think I worked in the parish for his sake; <b>and</b> <b>one</b> fine <b>day,</b> as <b>I</b> was walking home, he joined company, and before I knew where I was he was making me an offer.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, {{they said}} I did not any longer {{properly}} attend to my work. They said I was careless, and that I made mistakes; they complained that I was unpunctual, that I went late and came away early; <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>day,</b> because <b>I</b> 'adn't been there the day before, {{they told me}} to leave. I was watching at the bedside {{of a man who was}} dying and 'ad need of me; so 'ow could I go? But I didn't really mind; the office 'indered me in my work.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “My father,” {{explained}} Mildred, “trusted him fully {{until we}} went away and could get {{no answer to}} his letters. The old Spaniard was very fond of me, also, and he would hold me in his arms <b>and</b> say that <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> would be a rich lady, for my father and he were both making my fortune. I was very young, as you know, but I never forgot that statement.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{should just}} {{see what he}} does!' one said to her neighbour. 'He puts on the baby's frock upside down, <b>and,</b> <b>one</b> <b>day,</b> <b>I</b> found him trying to feed her with boiling soup, and her mouth was scalded for days after. Then he picks up stones in the road and sows them instead of potatoes, and one day {{he wanted to go}} into the garden from the top window, because he {{declared}} it was a shorter way than through the door.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One gets {{tired of}} everything," [...] said Plarsey, with a fat little sigh of resignation. [...] "I can't {{tell you how}} tired I am of Rubenstein, <b>and</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> suppose I shall be tired of Mozart, and violette de Parme and rosewood. I never thought it {{possible}} that I could ever tire of jonquils, and now I simply won't have one in the house. Oh, the scene the other day because some one brought some jonquils into the house! I'm afraid I was dreadfully rude, but I really couldn't help it." ...|$|E
6000|$|And like a {{bullfinch}} I {{piped up}} {{in response to}} the best of my ability. My answers, I fear, were usually evasive. For I had begun to see that she was making experiments on my mind and senses, as well as on my manners and body. She was a [...] "fancier." [...] <b>And</b> <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> ogled up at her with the pert remark that she now possessed a pocket barometer which would do its very utmost to remain at 31°, if that was possible without being [...] "Very Dry." ...|$|E
6000|$|The fact was, that Mr. Preston {{had fallen}} in love with Mary in a much more serious way than any of us imagined; for I do believe he invited his {{brother-in-law}} to Richmond for no other purpose than to pay court to his son's nurse. <b>And</b> <b>one</b> <b>day,</b> as <b>I</b> was coming post-haste to thank him for the place he had procured for me, being directed by Mr. Charles to the [...] "scrubbery," [...] as he called it, which led down to the river--there, sure enough, I found Mr. Preston, on his knees too, on the gravel-walk, and before him Mary, holding the little lord.|$|R

5000|$|As a teenager, Fifita trialled {{with the}} Sydney Roosters and the North Sydney Bears, but was {{considered}} lightweight, {{even though he}} was playing as a winger or centre at the time. Fifita said he, [...] "tried eating and all that stuff but it didn't work <b>and</b> then <b>one</b> <b>day</b> <b>I</b> just blew out. It wasn't until I was 17 or 18 that I put the size on. Maybe it was the grog, I don't know. I was seriously pushing to get to 80kg back then. I think I was about 70kg." [...] Fifita would eventually sign with the Wests Tigers and later played in their NYC team in 2009, including playing at prop in the 2009 NYC Grand Final against the Melbourne Storm in the 22-24 loss.|$|R
