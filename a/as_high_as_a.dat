5|$|Inexplicably, Generals Floyd and Pillow were upbeat {{about the}} day's {{performance}} and wired General Johnston at Nashville {{that they had}} won a great victory. Buckner, however, argued {{that they were in}} a desperate position that was getting worse with the arrival of Union reinforcements. At their final council of war in the Dover Hotel at 1:30a.m. on February 16, Buckner stated that if C.F. Smith attacked again, he could only hold for thirty minutes, and he estimated that the cost of defending the fort would be <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> seventy-five percent casualty rate. Buckner's position finally carried the meeting. Any large-scale escape would be difficult. Most of the river transports were currently transporting wounded men to Nashville and would not return in time to evacuate the command.|$|E
5|$|The storm's effects {{north of}} Florida were minor. Rainfall {{reached up to}} nine inches (228mm) in extreme eastern South Carolina and four inches (101mm) in eastern North Carolina. Winds reached 50mph (60km/h) with gusts up to 66mph (101km/h) at the Oak Island Coast Guard Station near Cape Fear, North Carolina and 54mph (87km/h) with gusts of 77mph (123km/h) at the {{offshore}} tower at Frying Pan Shoals about forty miles southeast of Cape Fear on June 18 with 70mph winds (110km/h) the next day. A 68foot fishing trawler sunk {{off the coast of}} Cape Fear in North Carolina from the high waves; no one was killed as the sailors were rescued by the United States Coast Guard on June 19. Flooding was reported with tides of two to three feet in the Carolinas. Rainfall from the subtropical storm reached both states, reaching maximum peaks of up to five inches (127mm) on the Georgia coast and seven inches on the Georgia/South Carolina border. Rainfall totaled to about one inch (25mm) on the Virginian coast. A ship encountered winds of a minimum tropical storm with gusts <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> maximum tropical storm. The ship also encountered a tidal surge of 15 to 20feet.|$|E

25|$|Poor {{housing quality}} and low incomes {{contributes}} to fuel poverty, a phenomenomen {{that is more}} common among lower-income household than among households in general. Over the past decade home energy costs have risen in American homes in general. For low-income households this cost increase is even more pressing, for which home energy expenditures can be <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> fifth of household income {{and more than a}} quarter of total housing costs. For that reason, improving energy efficiency has been pointed out as one of the challenges for American housing by the Joint Center for Housing Studies.|$|E
25|$|United Airlines Flight 232: a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 {{flying from}} Denver to Chicago in 1989.

Prior to the United 232 crash, {{the probability of a}} simultaneous failure of all three hydraulic systems was considered <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> billion-to-one. However, the statistical models used to come up with this figure did not account {{for the fact that the}} number-two engine was mounted at the tail close to all the hydraulic lines, nor the possibility that an engine failure would release many fragments in many directions. Since then, more modern aircraft engine designs have focused on keeping shrapnel from penetrating the cowling or ductwork, and have increasingly utilized high-strength composite materials to achieve the required penetration resistance while keeping the weight low.|$|E

500|$|Due to easterly {{wind shear}} and the {{convection}} along the storm's western periphery, the tropical depression dropped heavy rainfall {{in the states}} of Puebla, Tabasco, Hidalgo, and Veracruz, peaking at [...] in Jalacingo, Veracruz. This was the highest rainfall total in Veracruz from 1981 to 2010; statewide record peaks were also reported in Puebla and Hidalgo. The depression was the third wettest tropical cyclone in Mexico from 1983 to 2006, after Hurricane Wilma in 2005 and Tropical Storm Frances in 1998. The heaviest of the rainfall occurred along the Sierra Madre Oriental, which is a mountain range in eastern Mexico and the source for several regionally important rivers. Tuxpan, Veracruz recorded 6.2in (157.7mm) in a 24‑hour period on October4, which was greater than the average October rainfall there and was about one-ninth of the annual total. A station in Hidalgo reported 4.02in (102mm) on October4, which was also greater than the average October rainfall and was about one-eighth of the annual total. The return period was estimated <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> 1in 67year event at Xicotepec, Puebla, and {{it was estimated that}} such floods in Mexico occur only twice per century; similar floods occurred in September 1944 in the same region, although the area was less populated then.|$|E
500|$|The Spanish {{described}} {{the weapons of}} war of the Petén Maya as bows and arrows, fire-sharpened poles, flint-headed spears and two-handed swords known as hadzab that were crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset obsidian; these were similar to the Aztec macuahuitl. They had a thin, wide wooden shaft with obsidian or flint blades set into channels in the wood. The shaft was up to [...] long and was crafted from the hard, dark wood of a flowering tree (Apoplanesia paniculata) called chulul by the Maya. The bows used by the Maya were described as almost <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> man and were made from the same chulul wood as the hadzab, with the bowstring fashioned from henequen fibre; the bow was called a chuhul. Arrows were made from reeds with flint, bone or fishtooth arrowheads and flights crafted from feathers. In hand-to-hand combat the Maya used daggers with obsidian or flint blades set into a chulul-wood handle, they were about [...] long. Maya spears were referred to as nabte; sometimes the tip was fire-hardened, sometimes they were set with a stone blade. Spears were mainly used to thrust and slash but they could also be thrown as a javelin. The Maya used several different sizes of spear with the smaller spears probably employed as a missile; the longer spears were a similar size as those used by the Spanish.|$|E
