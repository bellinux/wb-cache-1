5|$|In March 2014, {{the tower}} was scaled by 16-year-old Weehawken, New Jersey {{resident}} Justin Casquejo, {{who entered the}} site {{through a hole in}} a fence. He was subsequently arrested on trespassing charges. He allegedly dressed like a construction worker, sneaked in, and convinced an elevator operator to lift him to the tower’s 88th floor, according to news sources. He then used stairways to get to the 104th floor, walked past a sleeping security guard, <b>and</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>up</b> a ladder to get to the antenna, where he took pictures for two hours. The elevator operator was reassigned, and the guard was fired. It was then revealed that officials had failed to install security cameras in the tower, which facilitated Casquejo's entry to the site.|$|E

5|$|With Cooke dead, Cumby assumed command. Bellerophons decks {{had largely}} been cleared by French fire, and {{boarding}} parties {{began to make}} their way onto the ship. Several French sailors climbed out onto Bellerophons spritsail yard, but a Bellerophon crewman released the brace holding the yard, causing them to fall into the sea. French sailors holding onto Bellerophons rails had their hands beaten until they were forced to let go. Bellerophons ensign had been shot away three times, so infuriating her yeoman of signals, Christopher Beaty, that he took the largest Union Jack he could find <b>and</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>up</b> into the mizzen rigging and hoisted it across the shrouds. The French riflemen on Aigle reportedly held their fire as he did this, in admiration of his bravery. The two ships were so close together that gun crews on their lower decks were fighting hand to hand at the gunports, while grenades lobbed through the ports caused heavy casualties. One grenade thrown into Bellerophon exploded in the gunner's storeroom, blowing open the door but fortunately blowing closed the door of the magazine. The resulting fire was quickly extinguished, preventing a catastrophic explosion.|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{the opening}} of this route, a road {{travelled}} southwest from the intersection of Inglewood Drive and Clifton Road into the ravine, crossed Yellow Creek, <b>and</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>up</b> the opposite slope north to the corner of Avoca Avenue and Rosehill Drive; most of this route exists as a recreational path today. [...] Roxborough Drive also crossed the ravine along the same route as Mount Pleasant today. A third route followed MacLennan Avenue north across the CPR tracks, ascending the steep MacLennan Hill. A decades-old contract signed with CPR required the closing of the MacLennan Avenue crossing if a road should ever pass beneath the tracks.|$|E

[...] after the band had left the stage following the final song, [...] "40", which had become a tradition. However, tour manager Dennis Sheehan hid underneath the crowd barrier and began singing the refrain into a microphone without being asked. Eventually, the crowd joined in; the film was edited to disguise the fact that the singing was organised.|$|E

2500|$|Having {{isolated}} Reno's {{force and}} driven {{them away from}} the encampment, the bulk of the native warriors were free to pursue Custer. The route taken by Custer to his [...] "Last Stand" [...] remains a subject of debate. One possibility is that after ordering Reno to charge, Custer continued down Reno Creek to within about a half mile (800 m) of the Little Bighorn, but then turned north <b>and</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>up</b> the bluffs, reaching the same spot to which Reno would soon retreat. From this point {{on the other side of}} the river, he could see Reno charging the village. Riding north along the bluffs, Custer could have descended into a drainage called Medicine Tail Coulee, which led to the river. Some historians believe that part of Custer's force descended the coulee, going west to the river and attempting unsuccessfully to cross into the village. According to some accounts, a small contingent of Indian sharpshooters opposed this crossing.|$|E

2500|$|In February 1800 Dundas was aboard Lord Keith's flagship, the first-rate HMS Queen Charlotte. Dundas was junior to Lieutenant Lord Cochrane but Cochrane {{had taken}} command of Nelson's prize, the Genereaux, in late 1799 {{to take her}} into port; Dundas {{therefore}} became 5th Lieutenant of the Queen Charlotte. [...] One month later, {{early in the morning}} of 17 March 1800, cries of [...] "Fire" [...] rang out throughout the vessel. Some hay lying under the half-deck had been set on fire by a match kept there for the signal guns. Dundas was in the forecastle where he organized fire-fighting efforts. Dundas led a party below decks where they secured the main and fore hatches and then opened the lower-deck ports and the sea cocks to flood the lower decks to prevent the fire spreading down. These efforts delayed the fire from reaching the two magazines. Dundas continued working below decks until some middle-deck guns fell through the deck. At about 9am Dundas climbed out the foremost lower-deck port <b>and</b> <b>climbed</b> <b>up</b> to the forecastle, joining the about 150 men there who were throwing water on the fire. Despite the crew's exertions, the Queen Charlotte eventually blew up with the loss of 673 people out of its complement of 840 officers, men and boys, including the Captain and her first Lieutenant. Dundas however survived.|$|E
