5|$|The {{story of}} Christmas Nights follows Elliot and Claris {{during the holiday}} season {{following}} their adventures with Nights. Though they both enjoy the Christmas season, they feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>something</b> is missing. Realising that the Christmas Star that usually sits {{at the top of the}} Twin Seeds Christmas tree is absent, the pair travel to Nightopia to find it. There, they reunite with Nights and re-explore Spring Valley, which has now been decorated due to their dreams of the holiday season. The remainder of the story revolves around their attempts of defeating a revived Gillwing and retrieving the Christmas Star from his lair.|$|E
500|$|At Judith's {{insistence that}} Briscoe is not helping her husband, Quatermass agrees to have Carroon {{transferred}} to a regular hospital, under guard. Meanwhile, Marsh has developed film from a camera that was aboard the rocket, and Quatermass, Lomax and Briscoe have a viewing. The crew is seen for a time pleasantly at their duties; then suddenly, something seems to jar the ship. After that, there is a nightmarish wavering in the air inside the rocket, and the men react <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>something</b> frightening, yet not manifestly visible, is there in the cabin with them. [...] One by one they fall, Carroon the last to go.|$|E
500|$|Ian Inglis admires {{the song}} as [...] "one of Harrison's most {{haunting}} and mysterious compositions", and writes of the recording: [...] "The gentle, largely acoustic backing, and Harrison's achingly beautiful vocal give the song a nebulous, yearning quality, almost <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>something</b> barely understood is {{slipping out of}} sight." [...] Inglis likens [...] "Be Here Now" [...] to the performance monologue [...] "Time" [...] by English actress and author Joyce Grenfell, whose conclusion that [...] "there {{is no such thing}} as time – only this very minute, and I am in it" [...] he finds echoed in Harrison's [...] "sense of wonder and helplessness in the face of the spiritual, scientific, and metaphysical implications of time".|$|E
60|$|Half-way to {{the door}} Mrs. Crocker paused, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> recalling <b>something</b> that had slipped her memory.|$|R
60|$|Presently {{the hand}} shut itself <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{grasping}} <b>something,</b> {{and moved in}} a distinct and steady manner.|$|R
6000|$|Lydia, not understanding, looked inquiringly at him. He made {{a gesture}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{throwing}} <b>something</b> from him, and continued recklessly, ...|$|R
500|$|Suddenly, the sheriff's body disappears, and Reyes doubles over in pain. Doggett and Harrison pull up {{her shirt}} to reveal moving bulges in her stomach, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>something</b> {{is trying to}} get out. Harrison then begins to bleed from her eyes. Doggett {{approaches}} Tommy, orders him to stop, and follows him down the hall when he fails to stop. [...] Doggett follows Tommy into a room, but falls down into a blackened abyss, where he is attacked by the insects. [...] However, due to Doggett's skepticism, he is able to fight off the illusion. [...] Because he does not believe they are real, they cease to be real. Doggett explains to Jeffrey that all of the creatures are imaginary and are produced by Tommy's imagination. This includes the bugs, the [...] "sheriff" [...] who had no organs, and Reyes' and Harrison's ailments. Jeffrey's wife and their cat Spanky killed themselves trying to remove the insect creatures, believing they were real.|$|E
60|$|Anthony {{interrupted}} her <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>something</b> had untied his tongue.|$|E
60|$|Irene smiled. And it was <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>something</b> shone through; {{not mere}} spirituality--serener, completer, more alluring.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; but {{the enemy}} {{have been keeping}} sharp watch there since noon, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{thinking}} <b>something</b> of this same kind might be attempted." ...|$|R
60|$|The old fellow's eyes twinkled, {{while the}} other men ceased talking, {{and looked at him}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> anticipating <b>something</b> good in reply to my question.|$|R
6000|$|... "It'll only cost twenty-five cents a {{week for}} each one of us," [...] Seth replied, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> {{thinking}} <b>something</b> {{in the way of}} an apology was necessary.|$|R
60|$|And {{again he}} heard that slight noise, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>something</b> or someone was moving in the room.|$|E
60|$|They are all now seated, except Larry; and {{the session}} assumes a portentous air, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>something</b> {{important}} were coming.|$|E
6000|$|... 'No--no, I'm {{not living}} here.' He was always slow in answering, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>something</b> intervened {{between him and}} any outside question.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's it," [...] said he. [...] "That's {{the very}} trouble. We {{got to give}} this one up. We can't ever tell the right time, and besides this kind of thing's too awful, here {{this time of night}} with witches and ghosts a-fluttering around so. I feel <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>something's</b> behind me all the time; and I'm afeard to turn around, becuz maybe there's others in front a-waiting for a chance. I been {{creeping}} all over, ever since I got here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, the {{particular}} question you forbid," [...] Grace returned with great force, but <b>as</b> <b>if</b> saying <b>something</b> very reasonable--"that {{question is the}} question we care about: it's our very ground of conversation." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{stood before}} her, muttering and menacing, and scowling round <b>as</b> <b>if</b> for <b>something</b> {{that would help}} him to conquer her; but with the same indomitable spirit she opposed him, without faltering.|$|R
60|$|When he and Leo {{looked at}} {{the roof of the}} hut it shook slightly, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>something</b> had fallen on it.|$|E
6000|$|... "No--no, dear heart, I wouldn't," [...] {{said the}} lady. She said it <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>something</b> hurt her horribly. She smiled again gallantly.|$|E
60|$|The two went forward, {{and on the}} {{forecastle}} {{they found}} Olaf; flushed with excitement, and looking <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>something</b> had annoyed him.|$|E
60|$|Defarge {{raised his}} head thoughtfully, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> there were <b>something</b> in that too.|$|R
60|$|Lusher Barrock made a {{movement}} <b>as</b> <b>if</b> to take <b>something</b> from his breast-pocket.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! Oh yes!" [...] said Ellen, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> recollecting <b>something</b> {{that had}} slipped her mind. [...] "He wants poppa to advise him {{whether to go}} back to his {{congregation}} in New York or not." ...|$|R
60|$|Then {{the silence}} was broken by a soft {{crashing}} sound, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>something</b> heavy had dropped a short distance on some hard object.|$|E
60|$|Now {{it is time}} to stop. Is there {{anything}} more you want to know? for you look <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>something</b> was puzzling you still.|$|E
60|$|VALENTINE. <b>As</b> <b>if</b> <b>something</b> {{were going}} to happen. It came over me {{suddenly}} just before you proposed that we should run away to the others.|$|E
50|$|Their eyes closed, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> hiding <b>something</b> {{more than}} a glance behind her eyelids, hiding life reality that {{sometime}} was sublime. Mouth open, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> expressing the mother’s pain and recounted the history that hundreds of women like her lived.|$|R
50|$|First {{published}} in Weird Tales, July 1932. In Africa again, Kane comes across an entire village wiped out, {{and all of}} the roofs have been ripped off, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> by <b>something</b> attempting to get inside from above.|$|R
60|$|He kissed her, and {{she clung}} to him <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he were <b>something</b> too {{precious}} to release.|$|R
6000|$|... "You may smoke, if {{you want}} to," [...] she said. He withdrew his hand with a jerk, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>something</b> in the pocket had stung him.|$|E
60|$|Arthur felt <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>something</b> put {{the words}} into his mouth, {{but he felt}} them with all his heart, and the tears were in his eyes.|$|E
60|$|As I rose, {{she put her}} arm round my waist--then {{instantly}} drew it away again, {{and shook}} her fingers impatiently, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>something</b> had hurt them.|$|E
6000|$|Still {{standing}} before him, she {{bent her head}} a little, and with a graceful gesture of the hands, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> offering <b>something,</b> she delivered with heartfelt emphasis {{the first part of}} Portia's pretty speech to her fortunate suitor: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But little, my lord," [...] replied Roland Graeme boldly, [...] "which met my apprehension, saving that {{it seemed}} to me <b>as</b> <b>if</b> in <b>something</b> you doubted the faith of the Knight of Avenel, under whose roof I was nurtured." ...|$|R
60|$|Instead of {{replying}} to this hail the two lads {{were seized}} roughly, {{and without a}} word the strangers, taking possession of the musket, began searching the messengers' clothing <b>as</b> <b>if</b> expecting <b>something</b> of value or importance would be found.|$|R
