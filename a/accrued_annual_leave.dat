In 2015, the grantee overspent the grant by $1.6 million dollars {{which was a}} disallowed cost in the DOLETA monitoring report. The management and board at that time used unrestricted and <b>accrued</b> <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> {{to cover the cost}} of the over spending. There were also some charges by the management during that time such as the use of first-class travel, pet hotels, fruit bouquets, personal loans to the CEO, and frequent credit card use on entertainment and prohibited lobbying. In 2014, the organization established an LLC, and used <b>accrued</b> <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> funds to purchase a software platform. Since then those funds have been paid back. [...] Experience Works and SWIFT Technologies continue to share the same CEO, staff, and office space. In 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor issued a follow up report critical of current management for not taking any corrective actions to restore funds. The current management is working to raise funds. [...] As a result, the U.S. Department of Labor has revamped the funding for SCSEP and the Inspector General has expanded the investigation into the activities of the previous management. [...] Former and current employees, reported to the DOL and OIG activities that occurred by the previous management that were concerning. In September, 2016 the Inspector General issued a preliminary report describing the organization as financial insolvent and took steps to curtail and eliminate federal funding.|$|E
50|$|When taking annual leave, {{employees}} {{were entitled to}} at least the basic pay rate they were on {{at the time of}} commencing the annual leave. It was possible for employees to request to cash out up to 2 weeks (or the pro rata equivalent for part-time employees) of their <b>accrued</b> <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> entitlement every 12 months. However, this could only occur if a term in a workplace agreement specifically permitted cashing out. Requests to cash out annual leave had to be in writing and could be refused by an employer. An employer could not require an employee to cash out an entitlement to annual leave, or exert undue influence or pressure on an employee.|$|E

40|$|Using {{data from}} wave 5 of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, this study examines: (i) {{the extent to}} which Australian {{employees}} use their <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> entitlements; and (ii) the association between <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> taking and weekly hours of work. After restricting attention to employees likely to have entitlement to at least four weeks of paid <b>annual</b> <b>leave,</b> it is found that the mean number of days of leave taken per year is around 16 and that the majority (63 %) take less than 20. The incidence of <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> taking is found to vary positively correlated with the number of usual weekly hours of work, but the size of this effect is small and weak. It is concluded that persons who regularly report long hours of work each week are mostly not compensating by taking extended periods of leave each year, but neither is there evidence to support the hypothesis that the pressures at work that might lead many people to regularly work very long hours each week also cause them to forego their <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> entitlements. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{right to}} paid <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> is a {{particularly}} important principle of EU social law that is regulated by the provisions of Article 7 of the Working Time Directive (WTD), where it enjoys a privileged status as the only non-derogable right. Significantly, Article 7 of the WTD Directive has been interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) as a directly effective provision. In Croatian law, this right has been implemented {{by means of the}} Labour Act. In this article, we examine three aspects of national regulations regarding paid <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> against which might raise doubts as to the proper implementation of Article 7 WTD. First, we look at the regulation on minimum periods of employment as a precondition for the entitlement to paid <b>annual</b> <b>leave.</b> Here, we shall argue that the national regulation is not consistent with EU law, as it triggers the accrual of the right to paid <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> only after half a month of employment. After that, we examine the regulation on the overlap between paid <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> and other types of leave. We shall claim that national rules regulating overlaps between paid <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> and maternity, parental, adoption, sick and other paid leave are not in violation of EU law. However, {{in the case of the}} overlap between paid leave and unpaid leave stemming from the Maternity and Parental Benefits Act, we raise certain doubts as to the adequacy of national regulations. Our last point of interest is the regulation concerning the carrying-over of untaken paid <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> into the following calendar year, where we argue that national provisions on the carry-over period are not consistent with Article 7 WTD...|$|R

40|$|Working time {{accounts}} (WTAs) are employer-oriented flexibility {{systems that}} have been applied in industry but could be used far more. Their use {{is limited by the}} complexity of planning them, assessing their financial benefits and establishing suitable compensation for workers. To overcome these drawbacks we define a planning model that takes into account work performance per task per worker, individual <b>annual</b> <b>leave,</b> the use of WTAs and the use of overtime. A four-stage process is proposed: Stage 1 deals with <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> and the linear consideration {{of the cost of the}} lack of capacity; Stage 2 with <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> and the non-linear consideration of the lack of capacity (but only for the periods during which holidays can be established); Stage 3 with minimising costs (once the holidays selected in Stage 2 are fixed, i. e. the holidays are considered as data) and Stage 4 with minimising capacity slack and excess capacity by minimising costs. A computational experiment based on the different periods of <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> is used to calculate the financial benefit generated by WTAs in each case and to assess possible compensations for workers.

40|$|Working time {{is mostly}} studied {{in terms of}} daily and weekly hours. However, longer breaks from work, {{in the form of}} paid <b>annual</b> <b>leave,</b> are also an {{important}} aspect of working time, and can help workers manage the fit between their working lives and activities beyond work. Analysing nationally representative data from the Australian Work and Life Index we find that 60 % of full-time workers with an entitlement to paid <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> did not use their full leave entitlement in 2009. Compared to an earlier survey in 2002, very little has changed. Work-related pressures are prominent barriers to leave uptake. There are significant work–life penalties for not taking paid <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> – particularly for workers with parenting responsibilities and for women. When asked to choose between two weeks’ additional paid leave and an equivalent pay rise, the majority choose more paid leave over a pay increase. These findings support a strengthening of Australian employees’ paid leave entitlements, including increasing entitlements and broader eligibility. There is also a case for more assertive management of leave, so that workers can take <b>annual</b> <b>leave</b> regularly rather than allow leave to accumulate. ...|$|R
