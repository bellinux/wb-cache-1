5|$|In Barker v. Wingo (1972), the Supreme Court {{announced}} {{four factors}} {{relevant to the}} determination of <b>a</b> <b>Speedy</b> Trial Clause violation: (1) {{the length of the}} delay, (2) the reason for the delay, (3) whether the defendant demanded <b>a</b> <b>speedy</b> trial, and (4) prejudice. Applying Barker, the Court found such a violation in Doggett v. United States (1992), which involved an over eight-year period between indictment and arrest. The only possible remedy for <b>a</b> <b>Speedy</b> Trial Clause violation is dismissal with prejudice.|$|E

5|$|Alan Anthony Wiggins (February 17, 1958 – January 6, 1991) was an American {{professional}} baseball player. He {{was a second}} baseman and outfielder in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the San Diego Padres and Baltimore Orioles between 1981 and 1987. <b>A</b> <b>speedy</b> leadoff hitter, Wiggins established a Padres single-season record for stolen bases in 1984, when they won the National League Championship Series (NLCS) and advanced to the World Series.|$|E

5|$|Among other effects, the Korean War {{galvanised}} NATO {{to develop}} a military structure. Public opinion in countries involved, such as Great Britain, was divided for and against the war. Many feared an escalation into a general war with Communist China, and even nuclear war. The strong {{opposition to the war}} often strained Anglo-American relations. For these reasons British officials sought <b>a</b> <b>speedy</b> end to the conflict, hoping to unite Korea under United Nations auspices and withdrawal of all foreign forces.|$|E
5|$|Andronikos {{began his}} reign well; in particular, the {{measures}} {{he took to}} reform {{the government of the}} empire have been praised by historians. In the provinces, Andronikos' reforms produced <b>a</b> <b>speedy</b> and marked improvement. Andronikos's fierce determination to root out corruption and many other abuses was admirable; under Andronikos, the sale of offices ceased; selection was based on merit, rather than favouritism; officials were paid an adequate salary so as to reduce the temptation of bribery. Every form of corruption was eliminated with ferocious zeal.|$|E
5|$|In June and July 1991, {{the short}} armed {{conflict}} in Slovenia came to <b>a</b> <b>speedy</b> end, {{partly because of}} the ethnic homogeneity of the population of Slovenia. It was later revealed that a military strike against Slovenia, followed by a planned withdrawal, was conceived by Slobodan Milošević and Borisav Jović, then president of the SFR Yugoslavia presidency. Jović published his diary containing the information and repeated it in his testimony at the Milošević trial at the ICTY.|$|E

5|$|Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, {{the three}} Baltic states, had formed the Baltic Entente in 1934. Its {{principal}} purposes were coordination of joint {{foreign policy and}} mutual international diplomatic support; {{it was not a}} military alliance. In Latvian and Estonian opinion, the Polish–Lithuanian dispute over Vilnius was outside the scope of the Entente, but they wished for a resolution, considering the conflict detrimental to the stability of the region. Latvia attempted to persuade Estonia to exert mutual pressure on Lithuania for <b>a</b> <b>speedy</b> acceptance of the ultimatum. This reaction from an ally was unexpected.|$|E
5|$|The {{first use}} of CS gas on the UK {{mainland}} that {{was not part of}} military training was carried out in 1944 during a hostage siege at a north London address.

5000|$|Not {{only did}} radicalism {{stem from the}} desire for <b>a</b> <b>speedier</b> reformation, but also from dissatisfaction of it altogether.

5|$|The mid-term {{elections}} in 1862 brought the Republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor {{with the administration}} over its failure to deliver <b>a</b> <b>speedy</b> end to the war, as well as rising inflation, new high taxes, rumors of corruption, the suspension of habeas corpus, the military draft law, and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation announced in September gained votes for the Republicans {{in the rural areas}} of New England and the upper Midwest, but it lost votes in the cities and the lower Midwest.|$|E
5|$|There are anecdotal {{reports of}} tame {{frigatebirds}} being kept across Polynesia and Micronesia in the Pacific.

He also excelled at fielding, often leading the National League {{in a number of}} statistical categories (including four times in fielding percentage). During his decade with the Cubs, they went to the World Series four times, winning in 1907 and 1908.|$|E

5|$|From {{the first}} article, {{cataloguing}} {{the rights of}} man, Mason derived the following articles, which make clear {{that the role of}} government is to secure and protect those rights, and if it fails to do so, the {{people have a right to}} amend or abolish it. Property could not be taken for public use without the owner's consent, and a citizen could only be bound by a law accepted by that person or by elected representatives.
