25|$|Over {{the last}} ten years, the {{national}} and international stages have drastically changed.

As long as there are those who hear and do the word of the Lord in North America, the message of Ligonier will not be silenced.|$|E

25|$|At one time, 25 {{subspecies}} of beavers {{were identified}} in North America, with distinctions based primarily on slight morphological differences and geographical isolation {{at the time of}} discovery. However, modern techniques generally use genetics rather than morphology to distinguish between subspecies, and currently the Integrated Taxonomic Information System (which provides authoritative taxonomic information on plants, animals, fungi, and microbes of North <b>America</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>world)</b> does not recognize any subspecies of C. canadensis, though a definitive genetic analysis has not been performed. Such an analysis would be {{complicated by the fact that}} substantial genetic mixing of populations has occurred because of the numerous reintroduction efforts intended to help the species recover following extirpation from many regions.|$|E
25|$|The {{period between}} 1980 and 1984 would mark the final term of Trudeau. By this point, Canadian {{interests}} and objectives {{in the hemisphere}} were completely unsynchronized with the views and objectives of the United States (especially under the conservative reigns of Ronald Reagan, 1981–1989). During this time, Canada favoured leftist policies {{both at home and}} abroad and continued to nurture ideological diversity, while the U.S., under Reagan, emphasized the importance of laissez-faire capitalism, (in a resurgence of anti-communist discourse), reduction of the welfare state, and discrete military intervention to accommodate American interests in Latin <b>America</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Reagan’s rationale was unequivocally based in the decline of American hegemony and aimed to bring prominence back to America by staunch opposition to left-wing movements in Latin America such as the Nicaraguan Sandinistas.|$|E

25|$|The {{airport is}} one of the largest in terms of cargo in the United States, and is the primary {{connecting}} point for cargo between Latin <b>America</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b> Ninety-six different carriers are involved in shifting over two million tons of freight annually and ensuring the safe travel of over 40 million passengers, according to the Miami International Airport corporate brochure. It was first in International freight and third in total freight for 2008. In 2000, LAN Cargo opened up a major operations base at the airport and currently operates a large cargo facility at the airport. Most major passenger airlines, such as American Airlines use the airport to carry hold cargo on passenger flights, though most cargo is transported by all-cargo airlines. UPS Airlines and FedEx Express both base their major Latin American operations at MIA.|$|E
25|$|Fidel Castro {{made many}} {{statements}} insisting that Cuba is a democracy or has democratic features. In 1960, Castro {{made a speech}} to the General Assembly referring to Cuba in relation to other Latin American nations, “We are speaking of democracy. If Government is of people and democratic, people can be consulted, as we are doing here. What is more an example of pure democracy than meetings such as this one. If they cannot call such meetings they are not democracies.” Castro continued “Those who want to see people’s democracy let them come here and see this. We can speak to <b>America</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> because we speak in names of a whole nation.” In this 1960 speech, Castro also criticized many Latin American liberal democracies, describing them as a “Pretense of democracy”, as, he claimed, they did not allow such gatherings.|$|E
25|$|Extremely unequal land {{ownership}} {{is both a}} cause and {{a consequence of the}} Colombian armed conflict. In 1960, 0.4% of landowners held 30% of all farmland. By 1997, the concentration of {{land ownership}} was further accentuated, with 0.35% of landowners holding 45% of all farmland with 86% owning just 13%. In 2012, 1% of landowners (those owning large properties over 200 hectares) held 43% of the land, and an additional 13% of landowners (those owning medium-sized properties over 20 hectares) held 39% of the land. 79% of landowners had properties of less than 10 hectares (considered microfundio and minifundio), which accounted for just 11% of private rural land. The 2014 Agricultural Census reported that 0.4% of agricultural production units (over 500 hectares) occupy 77.6% of the country's rural area, while 71% of agricultural production units (less than 5 hectares) occupy just 2% of rural land area. On the largest landholdings (over 1,000 hectares), an average of only 28% of the land is used for agricultural purposes with the remainder of the land covered by natural vegetation, confirming common accusations that the land is underutilized. The 2014 census also showed that, since 1960, the fragmentation of smallholdings had increased - production units of less than 5 hectares increased from 63% of 71% {{of the total number of}} such units - while the weight of large landholdings (over 500 hectares) in the total rural land area had increased significantly from 40% to 77.6%. The inequitable land distribution has increased since 2000, as measured by the Gini coefficient for land ownership - 0.885 in 2009, compared to 0.877 in 2000. Colombia is one of the countries with the highest inequality in rural property in Latin <b>America</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E

500|$|Psychedelic rock's {{popularity}} accelerated {{following the}} success of the Monterey Pop Festival and the release of the Beatles' album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in the same week of June. The album was the first commercially successful work that critics heralded as a landmark aspect of psychedelia, and the Beatles' mass appeal meant that the album would be played virtually everywhere. The Summer of Love of 1967 saw a huge number of young people from across <b>America</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> travel to the Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco, boosting the population from 15,000 to around 100,000. It was prefaced by the Human Be-In event in March and reached its peak at the Monterey Pop Festival in June, the latter helping to make major American stars of Janis Joplin, lead singer of Big Brother and the Holding Company, Jimi Hendrix, and the Who. Existing [...] "British Invasion" [...] acts now joined the psychedelic revolution, including Eric Burdon (previously of The Animals) and The Who, whose The Who Sell Out (December 1967) included psychedelic influenced tracks [...] "I Can See for Miles" [...] and [...] "Armenia City in the Sky". The Incredible String Band's The 5000 Spirits or the Layers of the Onion (July 1967) developed their folk music into full blown psychedelia, which would be a major influence on psychedelic rock.|$|E
