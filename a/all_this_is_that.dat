25|$|The {{translation}} of cuneiform documents is quite difficult, {{especially given the}} damaged nature of much source material. Additionally, {{our knowledge of the}} underlying languages, like Akkadian and Sumerian, have evolved over time, so a translation done now may be quite different than one done in AD 1900. The result of <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there can be honest disagreement what the document really says. Worse yet, many archaeological finds have not yet been published, much less translated. Those held in private collections may never be.|$|E
25|$|The {{implication}} of <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Mercian submission to Alfred – a crucial {{step in the}} creation of a single English kingdom – occurred not just because of one battle, Alfred's victory over the Great Army at Edington in 878, but also because of another, more distant battle, 'God's revenge' on the Mercians at the Conwy, when Anarawd of Gwynedd and his brothers defeated Æthelred and so brought about that collapse of the Mercian hegemony in Wales from which Alfred was only too pleased to benefit.|$|E
25|$|The {{outcome of}} <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the {{kinetics}} of the NaV channels {{are governed by}} a transition matrix whose rates are voltage-dependent in a complicated way. Since these channels themselves {{play a major role}} in determining the voltage, the global dynamics of the system can be quite difficult to work out. Hodgkin and Huxley approached the problem by developing a set of differential equations for the parameters that govern the ion channel states, known as the Hodgkin-Huxley equations. These equations have been extensively modified by later research, but form the starting point for most theoretical studies of action potential biophysics.|$|E

500|$|Gray, {{considered}} by Darwin {{to be his}} friend and [...] "best advocate", also attempted to convince Darwin in his letters that design was inherent in all forms of life, and {{to return to his}} faith. Gray saw nature as filled with [...] "unmistakable and irresistible indications of design" [...] and argued that [...] "God himself is the very last, irreducible causal factor and, hence, the source of all evolutionary change." [...] Darwin agreed that his theories were [...] "not at all necessarily atheistical" [...] but was unable to share Gray's belief. [...] "I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too profound for the human intellect. A dog might as well speculate on the mind of Newton," [...] he wrote. Gray was a Christian, but he was a staunch supporter of Darwin in America. He collected together a number of his own writings to produce an influential book, Darwiniana (1876); these essays argued for a conciliation between Darwinian evolution and the tenets of theism, {{at a time when many}} on both sides perceived the two as mutually exclusive. Gray denied that investigation of physical causes stood opposed to the theological view and the study of the harmonies between mind and Nature, and thought it [...] "most presumable that an intellectual conception realized in Nature would be realized through natural agencies". The result of <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Gray distanced himself from Social Darwinism. Gray is a critical link in the history of American intellectualism, and his writings that explain how religion and science were not necessarily mutually exclusive have been considered his supreme accomplishment; thereby providing a way for believers in Creationism to consider Darwin's ideas.|$|E

These were mainly in the form of 35mm film telerecordings, with a handful of episodes as 16mm film recordings or reduction prints. In the case of some episodes, the 35mm location footage also exists, and has been used to remaster those surviving episodes. The last episode of Series One, [...] "D For Destruction", thought to be among those lost forever, was recovered in 2003, in the BBC Archives in a mislabelled film can.

A direct result of <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the KNU lost most of its income derived from tax revenue, logging deals and {{cross-border}} trade. The loss of its financial base was also due to changing international relations. The threat of Communism disappeared in the 1990s, thus the US and Thai government changed policies. When the KNU attacked an oil pipeline in Karen state in 1995, the US government gave an official warning to the KNU for the first time.|$|R

2500|$|While for {{an outside}} {{observer}} the harmonic innovations in bebop {{would appear to}} be inspired by experiences in Western [...] "serious" [...] music, from Claude Debussy to Arnold Schoenberg, such a scheme cannot be sustained by the evidence from a cognitive approach. Claude Debussy did have some influence on jazz, for example, on Bix Beiderbecke's piano playing, and {{it is also true that}} Duke Ellington adopted and reinterpreted some harmonic devices in European contemporary music. West Coast jazz would run into such debts as would several forms of cool jazz. But bebop has hardly any such debts in the sense of direct borrowings. On the contrary, ideologically, bebop was a strong statement of rejection of any kind of eclecticism, propelled by a desire to activate something deeply buried in self. Bebop then revived tonal-harmonic ideas transmitted through the blues and reconstructed and expanded others in a basically non-Western harmonic approach. The ultimate significance of <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the experiments in jazz during the 1940s brought back to African-American music several structural principles and techniques rooted in African traditions.|$|E

40|$|Until very {{recently}} {{our knowledge of}} the peoples of the lower Omo was almost entirely derived from the reports of a dozen or so travellers, explorers and military adventurers, of various nationalities, who visited the area in rapid succession between approximately 1890 and 1910. The information they provided about local populations was fragmentary and, when considered as a whole, highly confusing. One traveller would report that he had found a certain group living in a flourishing condition in a place where another, passing through a few years later, could find little or no trace of human occupation. Different travellers, furthermore, would frequently use different names to refer to the same group, with the result that the ethnographic maps of the area soon became littered with a confusing variety of ethnic labels. One reason for <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> these early visitors were not especially interested in the peoples they met, except in so far as they helped or hindered their main objectives which lay in geographical discovery, military campaigning, big game hunting, the triangulation of international borders or, most often, a combination of these.

25|$|Hutchings & Co {{were awarded}} the {{contract}} {{and the first}} sod was cut at Bareflathills just outside Elgin near the River Lossie by the wife of James Grant on Saturday, 30 November 1851— a large cheering crowd amid the firing of cannons witnessed the ceremony. <b>This</b> point <b>was</b> chosen because it possessed the three most difficult engineering features to be overcome—the bridge over the River Lossie, the road bridge over the track and the very deep cutting. The contractor switched to two 12-hour shifts and had a work force of around 300 navvies. It was reported at the Board meeting held on 2 April 1852, that although the track was half-finished a strike within the workforce had provoked a serious disturbance. There were two stories in circulation regarding the incident. The first of these <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Irish navvies had come onto the job undercutting the locals’ wages and the other <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the contractor, who was from England, employed English labour and it was they who objected to the Irish. The outcome <b>was</b> <b>that</b> a riot of some sort had taken place and that four of the instigators were arrested and sentenced to various periods of hard labour—a fifth person was {{to be sent to}} the Court of Judiciary for trial after assaulting the Sheriff. The result of <b>all</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the Morayshire Railway was ordered to pay for ten additional police constables to regulate the workforce.|$|R
