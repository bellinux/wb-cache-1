5|$|The first RAF trial CAM launch {{was from}} Empire Rainbow, at Greenock on the River Clyde on 31 May 1941; the Hurricane landed at Abbotsinch. Six CAM ships joined convoys in June 1941. When <b>a</b> <b>CAM</b> ship arrived at its destination, the pilot usually {{launched}} and landed {{at a nearby}} airfield to get in as much flight time as possible before his return trip. Pilots were rotated out of CAM assignments after two round-trip voyages to avoid the deterioration of flying skills {{from the lack of}} flying time during the assignment.|$|E

5000|$|These designs use an {{oscillating}} or rocking {{motion in}} <b>a</b> part <b>cam</b> lobe, which acts on a follower. This follower then opens {{and closes the}} valve. Some oscillating <b>cam</b> systems use <b>a</b> conventional <b>cam</b> lobe, while others use <b>an</b> eccentric <b>cam</b> lobe and <b>a</b> connecting rod. The principle is similar to steam engines, where the amount of steam entering the cylinder was regulated by the steam [...] "cut-off" [...] point.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> face <b>cam</b> {{produces}} {{motion by}} using a follower riding {{on the face of}} a disk. The most common type has the follower ride in a slot so that the captive follower produces radial motion with positive positioning without the need for a spring or other mechanism to keep the follower in contact with the control surface. <b>A</b> face <b>cam</b> of this type generally has only one slot for a follower on each face. In some applications, a single element, such as a gear, <b>a</b> barrel <b>cam,</b> or other rotating element with a flat face, may do duty as <b>a</b> face <b>cam</b> in addition to other purposes.|$|R

25|$|The points {{allow the}} coil {{magnetic}} field to build. When the points open by <b>a</b> <b>cam</b> arrangement, {{the magnetic field}} collapses inducing an EMF in the primary that is {{much larger than the}} battery voltage and the transformer action produces a large output voltage (20 kV or greater) from the secondary.|$|E
25|$|Case is {{shifted from}} {{lowercase}} to uppercase (and associated shifted punctuation symbols) by rotating the element by exactly half a turn. This {{is accomplished by}} moving the right-hand rotate pulley via the shift arm, using <b>a</b> <b>cam</b> mounted {{on the end of}} the operation shaft; the additional cable tension adds 180° to any rotation from the whiffletree.|$|E
25|$|The G36 uses a short-stroke piston {{system from}} which HK later {{developed}} the HK-416's impingement system. Unlike direct impingement, this system takes gas trailing the bullet {{to operate a}} piston instead of pushing directly on the bolt. The G36's bolt is operated by <b>a</b> <b>cam</b> that guides the bolt carrier by its respective cutout. Then when fully pushed forward 7 radial locking lugs fully enclose the chamber.|$|E
30|$|<b>As</b> <b>CAM</b> {{generation}} rules take {{vehicle dynamics}} into account, the CAM generation rate per vehicle increases with the vehicle’s speed. Furthermore, the average distance between vehicles increases with speed [29]. As <b>a</b> result, the <b>CAM</b> rate density, i.e., the CAM rate generated per road segment and time interval, {{also depends on}} the average vehicle speed. We illustrate these relationships in the following.|$|R
5000|$|The Stagea was {{available}} with <b>a</b> 2.0L single <b>cam,</b> <b>a</b> 2.5L twin <b>cam</b> n/a, <b>a</b> 2.5L twin <b>cam</b> turbo or 2.6L twin cam, twin turbo engine. All engines {{were from the}} RB range, with the 2.6L (260RS model) being {{the same as that}} equipped in the Nissan R33 GTR. Engine power ranged from [...] in the 2.0l to [...] in the 2.5l turbo and [...] in the 2.6L twin turbo.|$|R

25|$|Typical European four-operation {{machines}} use the Odhner mechanism, or {{variations of}} it. This kind of machine included the Original Odhner, Brunsviga and several following imitators, starting from Triumphator, Thales, Walther, Facit up to Toshiba. Although {{most of these}} were operated by handcranks, there were motor-driven versions. Hamann calculators externally resembled pinwheel machines, but the setting lever positioned <b>a</b> <b>cam</b> that disengaged a drive pawl when the dial had moved far enough.|$|E
25|$|Most radial engines use {{overhead}} poppet valves {{driven by}} pushrods and lifters on <b>a</b> <b>cam</b> plate which is concentric with the crankshaft, {{with a few}} smaller radials, like the Kinner B-5 and Russian Shvetsov M-11, using individual camshafts within the crankcase for each cylinder. A few engines use sleeve valves such as the 14-cylinder Bristol Hercules and the 18-cylinder Bristol Centaurus, which are quieter and smoother running but require much tighter manufacturing tolerances.|$|E
25|$|Empire Fortune {{was built}} in 1941 as yard number 522 by John Readhead and Sons Ltd, South Shields, County Durham for the Ministry of War Transport (MoWT). She was {{launched}} on 28 April 1941 and completed in June. Her port of registry was South Shields. The United Kingdom Official Number 168649 and Code Letters BCMB were allocated. She was initially operated under the management of Hall Brothers, Empire Franklin was converted to <b>a</b> <b>CAM</b> ship shortly after completion. She was then operated under the management of Lamport and Holt Line.|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} Geneva {{mechanism is}} characterized by a driven star-wheel having a segmented cam-follower surface. Star-wheel driver includes <b>a</b> restraining <b>cam</b> having <b>a</b> segmented <b>cam</b> surface for engaging the cam-follower surface of the star-wheel and antifriction rollers pinned to the restraining cam for engaging the cam-follower surface...|$|R
50|$|The rollers {{can have}} a cross section {{in a variety of}} shapes other than circular, such as: ovals (which with a single oval roller as the central roller, or one of the outer rollers, results in <b>a</b> <b>cammed</b> motion), various {{varieties}} of superellipses and Reuleaux polygons.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design of}} the cams {{directly}} controls the acceleration of the arrow. What is termed a [...] "soft cam" [...] will accelerate the arrow more gently than a [...] "harder" [...] cam. Novice archers will typically shoot <b>a</b> soft <b>cam</b> whereas <b>a</b> more advanced archer may choose to use <b>a</b> harder <b>cam</b> to gain speed. Bows can be had with <b>a</b> variety of <b>cams,</b> in <b>a</b> full spectrum from soft to hard.|$|R
25|$|A Hawker Hurricane was {{the fighter}} flown by the Second World War {{character}} Johnny Redburn in the long-running British comic strip Johnny Red {{which was published}} in Battle Picture Weekly 1977–1987. The storyline featured Redburn, having been discharged from the RAF and joining the Merchant Navy, commandeers <b>a</b> <b>CAM</b> ship's Hurricane during an attack on a convoy (the official pilot being incapacitated), and ends up stranded in Soviet Russia {{at the height of the}} war against the Germans in which he fights alongside Russian pilots. The comic was written by Tom Tully and illustrated by Joe Colquhoun, John Cooper and Carlos Pino.|$|E
25|$|Higher lift allows greater airflow; {{although}} even {{by allowing}} a larger volume of air to pass thru the larger opening, the brevity {{of the typical}} duration with a higher lift cam results in less airflow than with <b>a</b> <b>cam</b> with lower lift but more duration, all else being equal. On forced induction motors this higher lift could yield better results than longer duration, particularly on the intake side. Notably though, higher lift has more potential problems than increased duration, in particular as valve train rpm rises which can result in less efficient running or loss of torque.|$|E
25|$|The upper {{segment of}} the grooved wheel, made of {{hardened}} steel, projects through a slot cut to its precise dimensions {{in the base of}} the priming pan. The wheel is grooved on its outside circumference with three or more V-shaped grooves with transverse cuts at intervals to provide a friction surface for the iron pyrites. The wheel is fixed to a shaft, one end of which projects outside the lockplate. The outside projection is of square section to permit a spanner (wrench) to be engaged for subsequent tensioning of the lock. The other end of the shaft fits {{through a hole in the}} lockplate, and on this end is forged <b>a</b> <b>cam,</b> or eccentric. One end of a short, robust chain (made of three or four flat, parallel links like a short piece of bicycle chain) is fixed to the cam, while the other end of the chain is held in a groove at the end of the longer branch of a large heavy V-spring, which is generally retained by a screw and a headed bracket through upstands inside the lockplate.|$|E
50|$|A common {{example of}} <b>a</b> linear <b>cam</b> is <b>a</b> key for a pin tumbler lock. The pins {{act as the}} followers. This {{behavior}} is exemplified when the key is duplicated in a key duplication machine, where the original key acts as <b>a</b> control <b>cam</b> for cutting the new key.|$|R

25|$|Bode {{designed}} the velocity computing networks of Director T-15 by applying a {{finite difference method}} instead of differentiation. Under this scheme the target positional coordinates were stored in a mechanical memory, usually a potentiometer or <b>a</b> <b>cam.</b> The velocity was then calculated by taking {{the difference between the}} coordinates of the current position and the coordinates of the previous reading that were stored in memory and dividing by the difference of their respective times. This method was more robust than the differentiation method and it also smoothed out signal disturbances since the finite time-step size was less sensitive to random signal impulses (spikes). It also introduced for the first time an algorithm better suited to modern digital signal processing theory rather than to the classical Calculus-based analog signal processing approach that was followed then. Not coincidentally it {{is an integral part of}} modern digital control theory and digital signal processing and it is known as the backward difference algorithm. In addition the Director T-15 operated only in rectangular coordinates thus eliminating coordinate transformation-based errors. These design innovations paid performance dividends and the Director T-15 was twice as accurate as its predecessor and it converged on a target twice as fast.|$|E
500|$|In May 1943, the Commander-in-Chief of Bomber Command, Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur Harris, {{requested}} that the maximum bombing altitude be increased from , as the Avro Lancaster units were now carrying out missions as high as [...] The Air Ministry responded with a compromise improvement of [...] and a more accurate angle mechanism. These changes produced the Mk. XIVA, which arrived in December 1944. The A model also introduced the ability for the minor differences in instrument readings for indicated and true air speed between aircraft to be corrected simply by replacing <b>a</b> <b>cam.</b>|$|E
500|$|... into {{reciprocating}} motion. These mechanisms {{were studied}} by Franz Reuleaux. With {{the assistance of}} the Gustav Voigt company, Reuleaux built approximately 800 models of mechanisms, several of which involved the Reuleaux triangle. Reuleaux used these models in his pioneering scientific investigations of their motion. Although most of the Reuleaux–Voigt models have been lost, 219 of them have been collected at Cornell University, including nine based on the Reuleaux triangle. However, the use of Reuleaux triangles in mechanism design predates the work of Reuleaux; for instance, some steam engines from as early as 1830 had <b>a</b> <b>cam</b> {{in the shape of a}} Reuleaux triangle.|$|E
