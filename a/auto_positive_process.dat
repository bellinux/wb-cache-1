40|$|Deterministic {{population}} growth models with power-law rates can exhibit a large variety of growth behaviors, ranging from algebraic, exponential to hyperexponential (finite time explosion). In this setup, selfsimilarity considerations {{play a key}} role, together with two time substitutions. Two stochastic versions of such models are investigated, showing a much richer variety of behaviors. One is the Lamperti construction of selfsimilar <b>positive</b> stochastic <b>processes</b> based on the exponentiation of spectrally <b>positive</b> <b>processes,</b> followed by an appropriate time change. The other one is based on stable continuous-state branching processes, given by another Lamperti time substitution applied to stable spectrally <b>positive</b> <b>processes.</b> Comment: àparaitre dans: Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Application...|$|R
40|$|Asthma {{continues}} {{to pose a}} significant medical problem {{in terms of both}} morbidity and mortality. A number of patients with a severe exacerbation of asthma fail medical therapy and require urgent intubation and mechanical ventilation. New modalities of ventilatory support, including noninvasive ventilation, have been shown to provide effective ventilation even in the presence of severe bronchoconstriction. An intrinsically high level of <b>auto</b> <b>positive</b> end-expiratory pressure in these patients requires a precise balance between respiratory frequency, tidal volume and inspiratory flow rates. Pressure support ventilation reduces the risk of barotrauma and lowers the work of breathing in these patients. Adjuvant therapy with inhaled anesthetics and bronchoalveolar lavage may also be indicated in patients requiring high pressures to achieve adequate ventilation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper aims at {{discussing}} chatter characteristics {{performed by}} a one-dimensional milling system having <b>positive</b> <b>process</b> stiffness and negative process stiffness. In this study, a dynamic model of the milling system is established first. An analytical form showing the critical chatter conditions including axial depth of cut, chatter frequency, critical spindle speed, etc. is formed. The analysis of process function shows that <b>positive</b> <b>process</b> stiffness occurs under most cutting conditions. However, process stiffness becomes negative when a one-dimensional milling system carries out low radial depth of cut {{in the direction of}} the feed (down milling) or semi-groove milling in the direction against the feed (up milling). Further analysis is made to explore chatter characteristics performed by the milling systems with <b>positive</b> <b>process</b> stiffness and negative process stiffness respectively. Finally, the prediction equation calculating critical chatter conditions of these two types of milling system, the range of rotation speed with high cutting stability and the range of rotation speed with low cutting stability is proposed...|$|R
