40|$|Multi-agent models often {{describe}} populations segregated {{either in}} the physical space, i. e. subdivided in metapopulations, or in the ecology of opinions, i. e. partitioned in echo chambers. Here we show how the interplay between homophily and social influence controls the emergence of both kinds of segregation in a simple model of mobile agents, endowed with a continuous opinion variable. In the model, physical proximity determines a progressive convergence of opinions but differing opinions result in agents moving <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>others.</b> This feedback between mobility and social dynamics determines to the onset of a stable dynamical metapopulation scenario where physically separated groups of like-minded individuals interact with <b>each</b> <b>other</b> through the exchange of agents. The further introduction of confirmation bias in social interactions, defined as the tendency of an individual to favor opinions that match his own, leads {{to the emergence of}} echo chambers where different opinions can coexist also within the same group. We believe that the model may be of interest to researchers investigating the origin of segregation in the offline and online world...|$|R

5|$|The {{effect of}} {{population}} density on sexual selection for convict cichlids has been studied.

40|$|The {{principle}} of using hollow spiral winding is not novel, but the study {{on this topic}} is far from complete. In this paper, how hollow the central region of the coreless printed spiral winding (CPSW) inductor should be for a given footprint area {{in order to achieve}} the maximal quality factor Q max and to maintain high inductance value is explored. A hollow factor based on the ratio of the inner hollow radius and the outer winding radius τ = R in/R out, is proposed as for optimization and quantifying how hollow a spiral winding is. The relationship between τ and Q max, which depends on the operating frequency and the dimensional parameters of CPSW inductor, is established. For a specific operating frequency, it is discovered that if the conductor width is comparable with the skin depth, or the conductors are placed relatively far <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>others,</b> the hollow design of the CPSW inductor has little improvement on Q but reduces the inductance. If the conductor width is much larger than the skin depth and the conductors are closely placed, the hollow spiral design is recommended. The optimal range of τ with which the Q max can be achieved is found to be around 0. 45 - 0. 55. © 2006 IEEE. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
60|$|I cannot {{write the}} name of Maupassant without recalling what was either a spiritual {{interposition}} or an extraordinary coincidence in my own life. I had been travelling in Switzerland and had visited, among other places, that Gemmi Pass, where a huge cliff separates a French from a German canton. On the summit of this cliff was a small inn, where we broke our journey. It was explained to us that, although the inn was inhabited all the year round, still for about three months in winter it was utterly isolated, because it could at any time only be approached by winding paths on the mountain side, and when these became obliterated by snow it was impossible either to come up or to descend. They could see {{the lights in the}} valley beneath them, but were as lonely as if they lived in the moon. So curious a situation naturally appealed to one's imagination, and I speedily began to build up a short story in my own mind, depending upon a group of strong antagonistic characters being penned up in this inn, loathing <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and yet utterly unable to get <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>other's</b> society, every day bringing them nearer to tragedy.

5|$|Recombination allows alleles on {{the same}} strand of DNA to become separated. However, the rate of {{recombination}} is low (approximately two events per chromosome per generation). As a result, genes close together on a chromosome {{may not always be}} shuffled <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and genes that are close together tend to be inherited together, a phenomenon known as linkage. This tendency is measured by finding how often two alleles occur together on a single chromosome compared to expectations, which is called their linkage disequilibrium. A set of alleles that is usually inherited in a group is called a haplotype. This can be important when one allele in a particular haplotype is strongly beneficial: natural selection can drive a selective sweep that will also cause the other alleles in the haplotype to become more common in the population; this effect is called genetic hitchhiking or genetic draft. Genetic draft caused by the fact that some neutral genes are genetically linked to others that are under selection can be partially captured by an appropriate effective population size.|$|E

By contrast, an internal tangency is one in which the two circles curve in the same way at their point of contact; the two circles lie on the same side of the tangent line, and one circle encloses the other. In this case, the distance between their centers equals the difference of their radii.

40|$|This thesis {{primarily}} {{deals with}} the conflict between traditional and modern values {{as seen in the}} conflicts between Old Mother and Angela. As described in Lim?s The Serpent?s Tooth, the early Chinese Singaporean immigrant are those who strongly cling to their (Chinese) traditional values. On the other hand, their Singaporean born children, who grew up in Singapore, are the product of a rapid modernizing and Westernizing environment. There is a tendency that today?s Chinese Singaporeans embrace the modern (Western) values more than their own traditional values. As a result, the dichotomy arises and creates conflict between the two different generations. From Lim?s The Serpent?s Tooth, I want to find out how four domestic issues have become the source of the conflict between Old Mother and Angela. In order to conduct the analysis, I use literary approach namely conflict in order to investigate the conflicting values between Old Mother who represents the first generation of Chinese Singaporean, and Angela who represents today?s Singaporean. Meanwhile, characterization is used to analyze the traits of the main characters which justify their modern and traditional attitude. In order to support the analysis, I use sociological concept of social change in order to examine the early Chinese immigrant?s rejection toward modern values. Moreover, the concept is also used in investigating the ways today?s Chinese Singaporean successfully accept modern values better than their previous generation. The analysis is divided based on the four domestic issues; they are: the children?s education, traditional religious activity, traditional and modern habit, and master-servant?s relationship. In the case of traditional and modern habit, Angela, as the representation of today?s Chinese Singaporean is able to understand her mother-in-law?s preference toward the traditional values. Yet, she persistently thinks the traditional value is not as important as the modern one. On the contrary, the early Chinese immigrants strongly reject the modern values. The tension which exists {{in the middle of their}} lives is also worsen by the fact that both of them have chosen in continuing their lives <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>other?s</b> different values. Finally, I conclude that through minimum efforts and desire in creating a better relationship, the conflict between traditional and modern values remains unsolved...|$|R

40|$|Recently, it {{has been}} {{suggested}} in [JHEP 12 (2015) 003] that the Brown-York mechanism can be used to measure the quasilocal energy in Lovelock gravity. We have used this method in a system of M 0 -branes and show that the Brown-York energy evolves in the process of birth and growth of Lovelock gravity. This can help us to predict phenomenological events which are emerged as due to dynamical structure of Lovelock gravity in our universe. In this model, first, M 0 -branes join to <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and form an M 3 -brane and an anti-M 3 -branes connected by an M 2 -brane. This system is named BIon. Universes and anti-universes live on M 3 -branes and M 2 plays the role of wormhole between them. By passing time, M 2 dissolves in M 3 's and nonlinear massive gravities, like Lovelock massive gravity, emerges and grows. By closing M 3 -branes, BIon evolves and wormhole between branes makes a transition to black hole. During this stage, Brown-York energy increases and shrinks to large values at the colliding points of branes. By approaching M 3 -branes towards <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> the square energy of their system becomes negative and some tachyonic states are produced. To remove these states, M 3 -branes compact, the sign of compacted gravity changes, anti-gravity is created which leads to getting <b>away</b> of branes <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Also, the Lovelock gravity disappears and it's energy forms a new M 2 between M 3 -branes.

The analysis has led to the following conclusions: Paul is trying to resolve a particular dispute between two groups of believers in Rome. The "weak" probably had a problem with the "strong" eating the meat and drinking the wine defiled with idolatry (14 : 21) and not keeping fasting days, or certain Jewish feast days (14 : 3). So, the "weak" may be identified as the Jewish Christians and the "strong" with the Christians of gentile origins.

Around 100 people had to send letters to one person they knew the name, the address (Cambridge, MA) and some other practical informations (job, hobbies, etc.). To send the letter, people were guided by the informations about the destination, but under the constraint {{that they had to}} transmit the letter to someone they know (hand to hand). It appears that 20 letters arrived and that chains had length between 2 and 10. The average length of the successful paths was 5 (meaning that the letters passed in hands of 6 people).

The chromophores {{were designed to}} shift their absorption and emission wavelengths to the red and to show quantitative emission in solid amorphous deposits. [2. 2]Paracyclophane (PcP) was grafted on the BODIPY core as well as alkyl chains of various length to force the molecules <b>away</b> one <b>from</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> and prevent π-π stacking. The optical spectroscopic and electrochemical properties in solution are presented. Absorption, emission and FLIM were done on drop-casted ﬁlms of the ﬂuorophores. The addition of alkyl substituents (-Me, -Et, n-Pr) next to the PcP group clearly affects the emission properties in solid state since the dyes display sharper emission bands than in solution and their relative ﬂuorescence quantum yield increases {{with the number of}} carbons in the alkyl chain. Fluorescence lifetime images analysis reveals complex decay proﬁles. Quite a fair description is given by a biexponential ﬁt: the short component is attributed to aggregates and the long component to monomer-like molecules. This population shows a shorter lifetime (2 - 3. 9 ns) compared to solution (6 ns) due to a quenching by aggregates. This quenching is decreasing as the number of carbons on the alkyl side chain is increasing. The combination of a PcP group next to a n-Pr group on a BODIPY is a good combination to get an excellent ﬂuorophore in the solid state...|$|R
