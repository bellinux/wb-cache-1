This was refused, with the comment that Paulet could travel as far on land as he could get in his barge. Thus challenged, Paulet loaded his barge onto a cart <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> to London anyway.|$|E

5|$|Critical {{reaction}} to the series was mixed. While some reviewers praised the programme for being worthy of its publicity by focusing on history rather than spirituality, others remarked that it was dumbed down <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> on strange tangents. The reliability of the facial reconstruction was also questioned. Son of God first aired in the UK on BBC One during April 2001, where it received a viewership of sixmillion and an audience share of 25%. In the United States, the series was shown on the Discovery Channel under the name Jesus: The Complete Story as a single three-hour programme, two weeks after its UK broadcast.

Duval and Frijns spun within moments of each other. López lost control of his car at the final chicane, and later heavily damaged his vehicle's front-right corner in the session's closing minutes by steering too early for turn 14 and collided with the barrier.

25|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the Sunday race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions lasted 90 minutes; the third, one-hour session was held on Saturday morning. Lap times were not comparable to the previous year's because of the usage of the slower Veedol Chicane. Lieb's No. 2 Porsche led the 90-minute period with 18 minutes and remaining with a fastest lap time of one minute and 41.703 seconds, nearly half of one-tenth of a second faster than teammate Brendon Hartley in the first Porsche. LMP2 was led by Brundle in the No. 26 Manor vehicle with a lap of one minute and 50.748 seconds which was recorded late in the session. James Calado in the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari was quickest in LMGTE Pro while Pedro Lamy helped Aston Martin Racing to be fastest in LMGTE Am. The session was disrupted when the rear-left suspension on Nicolas Lapierre's No. 36 Signatech Alpine failed <b>and</b> <b>went</b> <b>off</b> into the exit of the turn one gravel trap which prompted the deployment of the full course yellow before a red flag was later shown although race control system continued to show the latter as in operation.|$|E

500|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race, two each on Friday and Saturday. The Friday {{morning and afternoon}} sessions each lasted an hour; {{the third and fourth}} sessions, on Saturday morning, lasted 45 minutes each. The first practice session was moved from the usual start time from 11:00 Central European Summer Time (...) to 10:50 to comply with a planned silence for one minute that was observed at 12:00 throughout Europe. Michael Schumacher set the pace in the first practice session, which took place in dry weather conditions, with a time of 1:25.524; David Coulthard had the second-fastest time. Barrichello was third fastest, ahead of Nick Heidfeld (who crashed his car at Variante Ascari) in fourth. Mika Häkkinen recorded the fifth fastest time, with Jenson Button in sixth. Kimi Räikkönen, who was seventh fastest, collided with a barrier at Variante Goodyear which removed his front-right wheel. Ralf Schumacher, Jarno Trulli and Pedro de la Rosa rounded out the session's top ten fastest drivers. Arrows driver Jos Verstappen did not set a lap time because he collided with a tyre barrier at the Curva di Lesmo early in the session. In the second practice session, where a brief rain shower hit the circuit early in the session, Ralf Schumacher set the fastest time of the day, a 1:24.667; Montoya had the second fastest time despite going off the circuit during the session.
