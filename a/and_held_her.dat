5|$|In the {{afternoon}} draw, women's team play saw a split {{of the three}} available points. Mirjam Ott pushed out to an early lead against Heather Nedohin, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> lead against a struggling Nedohin to win. Jennifer Jones played a back-and-forth game with Eve Muirhead, and won on a dramatic finish, tapping a buried stone to score a deuce in the final end. Allison Pottinger held an early lead over Margaretha Sigfridsson, but Sigfridsson rallied {{with the help of}} three stolen points and tied the game.|$|E
5|$|The Devi Bhagavata Purana narrates {{that when}} Kali (Satyavati) was {{ferrying}} the rishi (sage) Parashara {{across the river}} Yamuna, the sage wanted Kali to satisfy his lust <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> right hand. She tried to dissuade Parashara, saying that a learned Brahmin of his stature should not desire a woman who stinks of fish. She finally gave in, realizing the desperation and persistence of the sage and fearing {{that if she did}} not heed to his request, he might topple the boat midstream. Kali agreed, and told Parashara to be patient until the boat reached the bank. On reaching the other side the sage grabbed her again, but she declared that her body stank and coitus should be delightful to them both. At these words, Matsyagandha was transformed (by the powers of the sage) into Yojanagandha ("she whose fragrance can be smelled from across a yojana"). She now smelled of musk, and so was called Kasturi-gandhi ("musk-fragrant"). When Parashara, tormented with desire, approached her again she insisted that the act was not appropriate in broad daylight, as her father and others would see them in sex from the other bank; they should wait till night. The sage, with his powers, shrouded the entire area in fog. Before Parashara could enjoy her, Satyavati again interrupted him to say that he would enjoy her and depart, robbing her of her virginity and leaving her shamed in society. The sage then blessed her with virgo intacta. She asked Parashara to promise her that the coitus would be a secret and her virginity intact; the son born from their union would be as famous as the great sage; and her fragrance and youth would be eternal. Parashara granted her these wishes and was satiated by the beautiful Satyavati. After the act, the sage bathed in the river and left, never to meet her again. The Mahabharata abridges the story, noting only two wishes for Satyavati: her virgo intacta and everlasting sweet fragrance.|$|E
25|$|Benedetta Carlini (1591-1660) was the abbess of the Convent of the Mother of God in Pescia, {{who shared}} her cell with Sister Bartolomea. When the two nuns made love, Sister Benedetta said she {{experienced}} mystical visions and angelic possession. The church authorities investigated the mystical experiences and, upon discovering her lesbian sexuality, stripped Carlini of her position as abbess <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> under guard {{for the remainder}} of her life.|$|E

25|$|During that time, Littlejohn {{was tried}} and {{convicted in the}} {{attempted}} abduction of a Queens woman on October 19, 2005. He abducted her from the street <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> in his van, but she managed to escape. She left DNA evidence in the van, which was identified after a search. This abduction attempt was later linked to St. Guillen's case, as the woman called police after seeing the suspected van on TV news reports.|$|E
25|$|In July 1610 he sent Gates {{against the}} Kecoughtan people. “Gates lured the Indians {{into the open}} by means of music-and-dance act by his drummer, and then {{slaughtered}} them”. This was the First Anglo-Powhatan War. The English, led by Samuel Argall captured Pocahontas, daughter of Powhatan, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> hostage until he would agree to their demands. “English demanded that all Powhatan captives be released, return all English weapons taken by his warriors, and agree upon a lasting peace”.|$|E
25|$|With Spelman's help translating, Argall {{pressured}} Iopassus {{to assist}} in Pocahontas's capture by promising an alliance with the English against the Powhatans. They tricked Pocahontas into boarding Argall's ship <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> for ransom, demanding the release of English prisoners held by her father, along with various stolen weapons and tools. Powhatan returned the prisoners, but failed to satisfy the colonists {{with the number of}} weapons and tools he returned. A long standoff ensued, during which the English kept Pocahontas captive.|$|E

25|$|The Tour de France has {{the major}} fault of {{dividing}} the country, {{right down to}} the smallest hamlet, even families, into two rival camps. I know a man who grabbed his wife <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> on the grill of a heated stove, seated and with her skirts held up, for favouring Jacques Anquetil when he preferred Raymond Poulidor. The following year, the woman became a Poulidor-iste. But it was too late. The husband had switched his allegiance to Gimondi. The last I heard they were digging in their heels and the neighbours were complaining.|$|E
25|$|In August 1994, Bianca {{comes to}} Pine Valley again {{following}} the death of Mona Kane Tyler, so overwhelmed by her loss and furious that she did not get to spend much time with her grandmother. Later, Bianca is kidnapped by Dr. Jonathan Kinder <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> for ransom. Kinder is Erica's doctor and has her hooked on painkillers. In self-defense, Bianca pushes Kinder down his stairs. Erica thinks he is dead, and so with help from Janet Green and Skye Chandler, they bury Kinder, but he is very much alive.|$|E
25|$|Sunline {{started her}} five-year-old {{campaign}} in Melbourne, against the sprinters - streaking {{away in the}} Manikato Stakes (1,200 metres) at Moonee Valley. She then had wins in the Memsie (1,400 metres) and Feehan Stakes (1,600 metres), but was narrowly beaten by Fairway in the Turnbull Stakes (2,000 metres). A natural frontrunner, like Sunline, Fairway refused to hand up the lead to Sunline, who was forced to chase, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> at bay down the straight. It was Sunline's third defeat over the distance from as many starts away from Moonee Valley, {{but it was a}} great improvement on her previous defeats, especially since Fairway was a multiple Group One winning three-year-old the previous season.|$|E

25|$|Witnesses saw Moseley {{enter his}} car, drive away and return ten minutes later. Shadowing {{his face with}} a wide-brimmed hat, he {{systematically}} searched the parking lot, the train station and an apartment complex, eventually finding Genovese, who was barely conscious and lying in a hallway {{at the back of the}} building, where a locked door had prevented her from going inside. Out of view of the street and of those who may have heard or seen any sign of the initial attack, Moseley stabbed Genovese several more times before raping her, stealing $49 from her and running away again. The attacks spanned approximately half an hour, and knife wounds in Genovese's hands suggested that she attempted to defend herself from him. A neighbor, Sophia Farrar, found her shortly after <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> in her arms.|$|E
25|$|Less {{than two}} years after his release from prison, Dupas was arrested on charges of false {{imprisonment}} over an incident at Lake Eppalock in January 1994. Wearing a hood and armed with a knife, insulation tape, and handcuffs, Dupas followed a woman who was picnicking <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> at knifepoint in a toilet block but was chased off by her friends. As he was leaving the scene he crashed his car and was apprehended. On 18 August 1994, after entering a guilty plea to one count of false imprisonment in the County Court in Bendigo, Dupas was sentenced to three years and nine months imprisonment, with a minimum period of two years and nine months. In September 1996, Dupas was again released from prison and moved into a house in the Melbourne suburb of Pascoe Vale.|$|E
25|$|As a sea captain, in 1609, Argall was {{the first}} to {{determine}} a shorter northern route from England across the Atlantic Ocean to the new English colony of Virginia, based at Jamestown, and made numerous voyages to the New World. He captained one of Lord De La Warr's ships in the successful rescue mission to Virginia in 1610 which saved the colony from starvation. As a sea warrior, he {{is best known for his}} successful diplomacy with the Powhatan Confederacy. He abducted the Chief's daughter, Pocahontas, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> as a captive at Henricus as security against the return of English captives and property held by Powhatan on 13 April 1613. Pocahontas had long been a friend of the English and was treated with great respect according to her rank, in the eyes of the English, as an Algonquian Princess. This action eventually resulted in the restoration of peace and trade relations between the English and the Powhatan Confederacy when English Planter John Rolfe of nearby Varina Plantation met and married Pocahontas. Argall was also successful in his actions against French efforts at colonisation in Acadia and North Africa which were upheld in London as violations of the Charter of the Virginia Company.|$|E

25|$|In February, Elizabeth {{managed the}} {{short-lived}} partnership between Luger and Ric Flair. The {{three of them}} were known as Team Package. The trio's main goal was to take down Hulk Hogan, whom Luger had been publicly challenging to a match during the previous few weeks. Hogan made his return to WCW during the February 2 edition of WCW Thunder, and while his back was turned during an interview segment, Elizabeth came into the ring, baseball bat raised. However, Hogan quickly turned around and easily out-muscled the bat from her possession. As a receipt for her dastardly act, and in a throwback to his attacks on Sensational Sherri in the World Wrestling Federation, Hogan picked up Liz <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> up high in the air and delivered his patented atomic drop. However, Elizabeth no-sold the maneuver and quickly rolled out of the ring. Later that week, Hogan called into Bubba the Love Sponge's radio show to discuss his program with Luger, not to mention Elizabeth no-selling his atomic drop maneuver on the previous edition of Thunder. Hogan claimed that Elizabeth refused to take a bigger bump because she wasn't wearing any panties underneath her skirt. Shortly thereafter, Team Package went their separate ways as they fought various members of The New Blood. Elizabeth engaged in short-lived feuds with Vince Russo and Kimberly Page. On May 8, 2000, Elizabeth wrestled in her first official match against Daffney. She then competed in matches against Rhonda Sing and Madusa.|$|E
25|$|At the US Open, Henin {{defeated}} {{her first}} four opponents in straight sets, with a 6–0 set in each match. Henin then faced Serena Williams in the quarterfinals {{for the third}} consecutive time in a Grand Slam tournament, and for the third time, Henin won, 7–6(3), 6–1. In the semifinals against Venus Williams, Henin was up a break in the first set but could not hold it. She finally won the set in a tiebreak. In the second set, Henin was ahead 3–0 before Williams leveled the set at 3–3. Williams then had three break points on Henin's service but could not convert and lost the game. Henin then broke Williams's serve <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> own serve to go up 5–3. Williams then broke Henin to pull within 5–4 but Henin broke Williams again in the last game to win the match 7–6(2), 6–4. Henin became only the second player to defeat both Williams sisters in the same Grand Slam tournament (after Martina Hingis at the 2001 Australian Open). In the final, Henin won her second US Open singles title, defeating Kuznetsova in straight sets, 6–1, 6–3. Henin won the tournament without dropping a set. She thus became the first women ever to defeat both Williams sisters in the same Grand Slam tournament, and go on to also win the title (Hingis had lost to Jennifer Capriati in the final of the 2001 Australian Open).|$|E
500|$|On June 2, 2012, Feng Jianmei (...) {{was forced}} to have an {{abortion}} in Zhenping County, Shaanxi, China, when she was seven months pregnant with her second child. Local officials had demanded that Feng and her husband pay a 40,000 yuan fine for violating the nation's one-child policy. [...] When they were unable to do so, authorities arrested Feng, made her sign an agreement {{to have an abortion}}, <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> down while injecting her with an abortifacient. [...] Feng was reportedly traumatized by the incident and in poor health afterwards.|$|E

500|$|Brooks's {{portrait}} of Barney has a softer look than her other {{paintings of the}} 1920s. Barney sits, swathed in a fur coat, in the house at 20 Rue Jacob where she lived <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> salon. In the window behind her, the courtyard is seen dusted with snow. Brooks often included animals or models of animals in her compositions to represent the personalities of her sitters; she painted Barney with a small sculpture of a horse, alluding to the love of riding that had led Remy de Gourmont to nickname her [...] "the Amazon". The paper on which the horse stands {{may be one of}} Barney's manuscripts.|$|E
500|$|After President Nixon {{told his}} family he would resign {{the office of}} the presidency, she replied, [...] "But why?" [...] She {{contacted}} White House curator Clement Conger to cancel any further development of a new official china pattern from the Lenox China Company, and began supervising the packing of the family's personal belongings. On August 7, 1974, the family met in the solarium of the White House for their last dinner. Pat {{sat on the edge of}} a couch <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> chin high, a sign of tension to her husband. When the president walked in, she threw her arms around him, kissed him, and said, [...] "We're all very proud of you, Daddy." [...] Later Pat Nixon said of the photographs taken that evening, [...] "Our hearts were breaking and there we are smiling." ...|$|E
500|$|Susanna's widowed {{mother was}} frightened at the {{prospect}} of Massachusetts gaining influence or control over Rhode Island. Consequently, she moved to the part of New Netherland that later became The Bronx in New York City, along with her six youngest children, an older son, a son-in-law, and some servants. The Dutch were engaged in Kieft's War against the Siwanoy Indians during the family's tenure there. In August 1643, Siwonoy attacked the emigrant household and killed all members of the family, except for nine year-old Susanna. [...] According to one story, Susanna's red hair spared her from the slaughter, while another account claimed that the girl was out picking blueberries some distance from the house and hid in the crevice of Split Rock. In any event, the attackers took her captive <b>and</b> <b>held</b> <b>her</b> for several years.|$|E
