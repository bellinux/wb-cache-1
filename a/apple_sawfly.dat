50|$|Hoplocampa testudinea, the <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly</b> or European <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly,</b> is {{a species}} of sawfly in the family Tenthredinidae. It is native to Europe but has been accidentally {{introduced}} into North America where it became invasive. The larvae feed inside the developing fruits of the apple tree.|$|E
50|$|In Europe, the <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly</b> has {{a number}} of predators and parasites which help to keep it under control. One of these is the {{parasitoid}} wasp Lathrolestes ensator which is a parasite of the larvae. In North America, these natural enemies are not present and the pest causes more significant damage to apple crops. In an attempt to alleviate this situation, L. ensator has been imported from Europe to help act as a control.|$|E
50|$|In a {{research}} {{study in the}} Netherlands, L. ensator was the only parasitoid of the <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly</b> larvae that was found, and the sawfly was the only host used by it. The wasp preferentially chose second instar larvae in which to lay eggs, and the spring emergence of the adult wasp usually synchronised with {{this stage of the}} host's life cycle. The female wasp produced around 150 eggs but did not actually oviposit as many as half of these.|$|E

50|$|Lathrolestes ensator is {{a species}} of wasp in the family Ichneumonidae. it is a {{parasitoid}} of the <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly</b> Hoplocampa testudinea. Both insects are native to Europe, but the sawfly has been accidentally introduced into North America where it has become established. The larvae of the sawfly tunnel into developing apple fruitlets which later fall to the ground, where the larvae continue their development. The wasp parasitises the larvae and has been released in North America {{as part of a}} biological control programme for the sawfly.|$|E
50|$|The adult <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly</b> {{is up to}} 5 mm {{long with}} a brownish-black head and thorax and a brown abdomen. The larva is a caterpillar-like grub with a brown head and white body, growing to about 10 mm when fully developed. It can be {{distinguished}} from the codling moth (Cydia pomonella) larva by being creamy-white, with seven pairs of abdominal legs, while the latter is pinkish-white and has five pairs. The sawfly larva is active in the fruits {{two or three weeks}} earlier in the season than the codling larva.|$|E
50|$|In Europe, the <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly</b> {{is part of}} {{the food}} web, but when it was accidentally {{introduced}} into North America, there were no natural enemies to control it and it caused much damage to the apple crop. In a classical biological control programme. L. ensator was released into Quebec between 1994 and 2001 and became established in the Frelighsburg area. Further work was undertaken between 2002 and 2015 to spread the parasite throughout eastern North America. This was done by collecting fallen fruitlets of apple trees in infected orchards in the Frelighsburg area, and scattering them in orchards in other parts of Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia and New Hampshire. As a result of this introduction, the wasp became established in three other parts of Quebec and in Hilton in Ontario.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the thesis was {{to find out the}} growers’ perspective towards the problem of <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly</b> (Hoplocampa testudinea, Klug) as well as its solution, evaluate the suitability of Dutch and Swiss forecasting methods in Swedish environment, and evaluate the efficiency and timing of Quassia extract application with varying concentration of rapeseed oil product Zence 40 against the <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly.</b> The <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly</b> was monitored using white sticky traps in two orchards located in Alnarp and Malmö. The forecasting models for emergence of first sawfly (Dutch model) and egg hatch (Swiss model) were combined and used for determining timing of Quassia extract application. The model worked well for forecasting both the first emergence and egg hatch of the <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly.</b> A field trial was conducted for spraying Quassia extract as a control measure against the <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly.</b> The treatments were 1) Petal fall (PF), 2) Day degree low zence (DDL), 3), Day degree high zence (DDH) and 4) Control (C). The dose of Quassia was used at 12 kg per hectare in 400 liters of water. The percentage of the <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly</b> damage was significantly lower in all treatments compared to control with 3. 8 %, 3. 2 %, 2. 9 % and 9. 9 % damage in treatment 1, 2, 3 and 4. There was no difference in secondary damage between treatments. This could have been influenced by a large aphid infestation at that time. Semi structured face to face interviews were carried out to get deeper understanding of the problem. Older orchards were found to have relatively more infestation compared to new orchards. The growers were interested to continue the work with monitoring and trap catches in the coming season. They wished that the model should be proposed which can be used by the advisors from Äppelriket and the Board of Agriculture for forecasting the <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly</b> in Sweden...|$|E

The pest is distributed over the entire continent of Europe but is most common in the north. It is found throughout England but is abundant only in certain localities. The larvae feed on all apple and crabapple varieties but show a preference for early or long-blooming varieties with a heavy set of fruit. Sawflies are primitive hymenopterous insects and are related to bees, wasps, and ants.

40|$|Low impact {{alternatives}} to synthetic insecticides {{for the control}} of <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly</b> (Hoplocampa testudinea Klug) are scarce encumbering pest management in organic apple orchards. We investigated the soil persistence and field efficacy of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin (BotaniGard) against <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly</b> under common organic orchard practices. We also assessed the efficacy of B. bassiana GHA and Metarhizium brunneum Petch (indigenous strain) against sawfly in the laboratory. Larvae treated with either fungus in the laboratory died faster than control larvae and displayed 49. 4 %- 68. 4 % mycosis. In the field, B. bassiana density remained high in the week after application, during larval descent to the soil. Fungal density decreased to 25 % at 49 d after application and to 0. 4 % after 55 weeks. Molecular markers revealed {{that the majority of}} fungal isolates recovered comprised the applied B. bassiana strain GHA. Larvae pupating in soil cages in the orchard for 49 d displayed 17 % mycosis. The high efficacy under laboratory conditions was not seen in the field. B. bassiana application resulted in densities above the upper natural background level during the growing season, but reversion to background levels occurred within a year. It remains to be investigated whether this has a detrimental effect on nontarget organisms.

40|$|Participatory Action Research (PAR) is an interventionist, action-orientated and transdisciplinary {{approach}} to applied research that strives for the collaborative development of any practice together with relevant stakeholders. It enhances {{the relevance of}} research to practice by active stakeholder involvement in all research steps, including the spaces in which the practice is conducted, its iterative knowledge construction and the recognition that knowledge exists in practice and is created when attempting to transform reality. During the PAR project on pest management in Swedish organic apple production on which this thesis is based, several pests and control methods were addressed, focusing mainly on the <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly</b> (Hoplocampa testudinea Klug). An interdisciplinary methodology and PAR approach was employed, including participatory meetings, interviews and field and laboratory experiments. An efficient control method was developed involving a forecasting model in combination with a botanical pesticide derived from Quassia amara L. However, the potential negative side effects of Q. amara on natural enemies are currently being evaluated by the European Union. Control of the <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly</b> by soil application of the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin {{was found to be}} insufficient in the field trial and requires further studies {{to bridge the gap between}} laboratory and field results.

During the project a need emerged to find a theory and tools that could support participatory problem formulation by identifying the systemic root causes of the pest problems being experienced and explain the main drivers of this development. It was assumed that this would facilitate the development of more sustainable solutions. Cultural-Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) offered these tools and was applied as a retrospective analytical lens on the PAR project. I analysed the emergence and development of organic apple production in Sweden and formulated a hypothesis on the root causes of disturbances reported in pest management by farmers growing organic apples. The results suggest that the formulation of pest management problems during the previous PAR project focused on development of tools to increase productivity. However, based on the historical root causes of the problems, identified by the CHAT-based analysis, a wider systemic approach is required to find sustainable solutions...|$|E

Females are {{significantly}} smaller than males and nearly wingless. After encountering a host, females needed 29. 3 min at 20 °C and 19. 9 min at 25 °C to deposit an egg on the host. Development from egg to adult took 39. 6 days for females and 38. 0 days for males at 20 °C. This small difference was significant. At 20 °C, the longevity of females that had no opportunity to oviposit was on average 72. 5 days, significantly higher than male longevity (50. 6 days). The longevity of females given access to hosts throughout their lifetime averaged 58. 6 days. Females were able to mate immediately after emergence and copulation lasted on average 21. 7 s. After a pre-oviposition period averaging 5. 8 days, females laid 20. 2 eggs during their lifetime, thus less than one egg per day. Neither the fecundity nor longevity of individual females was correlated with body size. If females were deprived of food, longevity as well as lifetime fecundity were drastically reduced.

Both insects infest fruitlets and cause these to drop prematurely after which the pests pupate in the topsoil. In the present experiment a research orchard with the varieties ‘Discovery’ and ‘Conference’ were used as outdoor area for broilers to minimise the population of sawflies and pear midges, and to reduce the need for weeding and manuring. The trees were kept unsprayed. Fruit yield and fruit quality were assessed at harvest. White sticky traps were placed in the test area in order to measure the occurrence of sawfly over time. The infestation of pear midge was investigated counting the infested fruitlets in clusters on trees at the centre of the plots. The catch of apple sawflies was reduced in the combined apple and broiler production, but no significant effect on the yield or the fruit quality was seen.

40|$|Lathrolestes ensator (Brauns) was {{the only}} {{parasitoid}} species reared from larvae of <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly</b> Hoplocampa testudinea (Klug) collected in Dutch orchards. The life history parameters of <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly</b> and its parasitoid L. ensator were investigated in field and semi-field experiments. Usually, the adult parasitoids emerge in synchrony with the preferred host stage, the second instar sawfly larvae. Parasitoid females carried 120 - 175 eggs, but never laid more than half this number. The mortality of sawfly eggs and larvae varied from 75 and 99 &Eth;The eggs and mining larvae are most vulnerable, as the older larvae survive for 90 n average. Three factors at least determine {{how many of the}} descending larvae become adult sawfly or parasitoid next spring. The failure of descending larvae to construct a cocoon varied from 7 to 31 nd was highest in clay soil. Probably a similar mechanical hindrance prohibited more emerging adults, of both sawfly and L. ensator, from attaining the surface in heavier soils next spring. Relatively more sawfly prepupae than parasitoids died in the cocoon stage, from fungus disease or other causes, but more parasitoids than hosts stayed in prolonged diapause. Mainly due to this last factor, the overall result was a decrease of the parasitoid : host ratio during the first season underground. A life table based on survival rates during various life stages yields a net reproductive rate of up to 2. 4 daughters per female sawfly. It indicates that 60 f the sawfly larvae need to be parasitized to stop population growth, or correspondingly less when more than 75 f the host eggs and young larvae are killed by predators or other causes...|$|E

Beginning on 1 January, variation of the temperature sums, calculated in each of 8 years, decreased when later starting dates for temperature summation were chosen, reaching a minimum on 1 April for soil temperatures (− 5 cm). The soil temperature sum, accumulated from 1 April until the first capture, was on average 134 day-degrees above a threshold of 4 °C. So this was the most suitable starting date {{to predict the}} beginning of sawfly flight activity.

While Quassin had a considerable efficacy also on older larvae, Neo-quassin was less efficient in this case. Since Quassin and Neoquassin were found in different Quassia sources in varying relations {{to each other and}} had different efficacy, they have to be considered separately in the definition of extract quality by the content of active ingredients.

From 1992 to 1995, bioassays with Galleria mellonella larvae were conducted to assess the persistence of S. carpocapsae on leaves, flower clusters, and twigs up to 4 days after evening application. S. carpocapsae juveniles remained infective on apple leaves 24, 42, 98, and 24 hours after application in 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995, respectively. In bioassays, the percentage of G. mellonella mortality was consistently higher on leaves (average = 84 %), intermediate on flower clusters (73 %), and lower on twigs (43 %) for all application dates. In 1992 and 1993, single nematode sprays applied every 2 to 3 days from early May to mid-June on apple tree limbs reduced primary damage caused by H. testudinea by 98 % and 100 %, respectively, {{but none of the}} treatments was effective in 1994.

40|$|Changes in {{population}} densities of the <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly</b> Hoplocampa testudinea (Klug) and its parasitoid Lathrolestes ensator (Brauns) were monitored in 15 apple orchards {{for a period}} of up to 4 years. The parasitoid species was found in all orchards except one, and was more numerous in plantings on sandier soils. Post-bloom insecticide applications against other pests, and carbaryl for fruit thinning, often decimated both host and parasitoid in integrated pest management orchards. In organic orchards, where synthetic pesticides are banned, and Quassia is the only remedy against sawfly, the pest is more problematic. The low levels of parasitism in all organic orchards, except one, were possibly due to the application of wettable sulphur during the parasitoid flight period. The sawfly usually recovers more quickly than its parasitoid when chemical control is discontinued, because propagation of L. ensator is limited in various ways. The parasitoid is time limited, because suitable second instar host larvae are rarely available {{for more than a week}} on a single apple variety. Moreover, parasitism levels stay moderate because the parasitoid females do not avoid superparasitism. Finally, relatively more sawflies than parasitoids emerge after 10 months underground, because the incidence of prolonged diapause is more elevated in L. ensator than in the sawfly. It is suggested that both the high incidence of prolonged diapause and the inability to avoid superparasitism are useful in reducing the risk of local extinction. Elevated sawfly attack in a single early apple variety would reduce exploitation of suitable host larvae in other nearby varieties, in as far as the parasitoid is not able to distinguish fruitlets with accessible second instar host larvae from those with inaccessible older larvae. Although the former are available for a limited time, the latter may keep the parasitoids from moving to the less abundant second instar larvae in late(r) varieties. Reduction of elevated host density in such an early variety by a properly timed application of a short-lived pesticide, such as Quassia, increases parasitism levels proportionally, and is expected to promote parasitoid movement to host larvae in other varieties nearb...|$|E
40|$|Domestication {{of apples}} goes back several {{thousand}} years {{in time and}} archaeological findings of dried apples from Östergötland in Sweden have been dated to ca 2 500 B. C. Worldwide, apples are considered an attractive and healthy fruit to eat. Organic production of apples is increasing abroad but is still at very low levels in Sweden. This study deals with major disease and pest problems in organic growing of apples. It concentrates on the most severe disease, the apple scab (Venturia inaequalis). Resistance to apple scab was evaluated during three years in over 450 old and new apple cultivars at Alnarp and Balsgård in southern Sweden. There were {{significant differences between the}} cultivars and years. About ten per cent of the cultivars had a high level of resistance against apple scab. The correlation between foliar and fruit scab was stronger when the scab infection pressure was high (1998 - 1999), compared to when it was low (2000). Polygenic resistance is a desirable trait since such resistance is more difficult to overcome by the pathogen. A common denominator for polygenic resistance among the cultivars assessed was 'Worcester Pearmain'. The leaf infection of apple scab was compared at three locations: Alnarp, Kivik and Rånna (Skövde) in an observation trial for 22 new apple cultivars. The ranking of the cultivars was similar at the three locations. The best cultivars, 'McShay' and 'Sansa', are unfortunately not suitable for growing in Sweden, due to climatic conditions. However, several other cultivars might be useful in organic growing. The incidence of apple scab races was investigated {{for the first time in}} Sweden. Races 1 - 4 and 6 were reported from different geographical locations in Sweden (1999 - 2001), and tested in growth chamber/greenhouse trials. Race 1 was present at all sites and race 7 was reported on Malus floribunda 821 for the first time in a field trial at Kivik in 2002. Apple scab lesions were also found on the ornamental species Malus baccata jackii. In an experimental organic orchard with 'Amorosa' and 'Discovery' interplanted with ornamental shrubs, the insect and spider fauna was investigated. Codling moth was considered to be a key pest in the orchard. Winter moth and <b>apple</b> <b>sawfly</b> damaged the fruit to a significantly higher extent in 'Discovery' than 'Amorosa'...|$|E
