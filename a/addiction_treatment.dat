40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 08 Alcohol use {{is common}} and {{particularly}} risky for {{people living with}} HIV (PLWH). Certain subpopulations of PLWH, such as racial/ethnic minorities and rural PLWH, may be at particularly increased risk of adverse alcohol-related outcomes. This dissertation describes differences in alcohol-related mortality risk across racial/ethnic groups (Aim 1), {{patterns of alcohol use}} across rurality (Aim 2), and the receipt of alcohol related care across both rurality and race/ethnicity (Aims 3 a and 3 b). In Aim 1, we found that PLWH from all racial/ethnic groups have increased mortality risk at higher-risk, relative to lower-risk drinkers. White patients have increased mortality risk relative to black patients at higher-risk levels of drinking, and black patients have increased mortality risk relative to white patients at lower-levels of drinking. In Aim 2, we found that patterns of alcohol use vary across rurality among PLWH. Urban PLWH appear to be more likely to report any alcohol use, although this association varies across region and by neighborhood poverty level. Among drinkers, PLWH from small rural communities {{may be more likely to}} drink at higher-risk levels. In Aims 3 a and 3 b, we identified differences in receipt of alcohol related care across both rurality and race/ethnicity among PLWH. Large rural PLWH are more likely to receive brief interventions overall, in the Midwest, and the South, but may be less likely than urban PLWH in the Northeast. Urban patients are more likely than large or small rural patients to receive specialty <b>addictions</b> <b>treatment.</b> Black PLWH were more likely to receive specialty <b>addictions</b> <b>treatment.</b> There were no differences across rurality or race/ethnicity in receipt of AUD medications. In this dissertation, we document differences in alcohol use, care, and outcomes among PLWH across rurality and race/ethnicity. Specifically, black PLWH have increased mortality risk at lower levels of drinking but more likely to receipt specialty <b>addictions</b> <b>treatment</b> than Hispanic and white patients. Additionally, rural PLWH may be more likely to drink at higher risk levels of drinking, but are less likely to receive specialty <b>addictions</b> <b>treatment.</b> These differences highlight important areas for future interventions...|$|R

500|$|The {{dopamine}} system plays {{a crucial}} role in several aspects of addiction. [...] At the earliest stage, genetic differences that alter the expression of dopamine receptors in the brain can predict whether a person will find stimulants appealing or aversive. [...] Consumption of stimulants produces increases in brain dopamine levels that last from minutes to hours. [...] Finally, the chronic elevation in dopamine that comes with repetitive high-dose stimulant consumption triggers a wide-ranging set of structural changes in the brain that are responsible for the behavioral abnormalities which characterize an <b>addiction.</b> <b>Treatment</b> of stimulant addiction is very difficult, because even if consumption ceases, the craving that comes with psychological withdrawal does not. Even when the craving seems to be extinct, it may re-emerge when faced with stimuli that are associated with the drug, such as friends, locations and situations. Association networks in the brain are greatly interlinked.|$|E
500|$|Among {{the items}} {{passed in the}} {{legislative}} session were a bill allowing optometrists to perform eye surgery (a procedure usually reserved for ophthalmologists), {{a ban on the}} sale of a psychoactive drug marketed as [...] "bath salts", and a measure allowing community supervision and <b>addiction</b> <b>treatment</b> as jail alternatives for non-violent drug criminals. Measures that did not pass included tougher measures to curb illegal immigration advocated by Williams and raising the legal age for dropping out of high school from sixteen to eighteen, a proposal supported by Beshear. Also, the Assembly was unable to agree on whether to adopt Beshear's plan to address a shortfall in the state's Medicaid obligations or an alternative plan proposed by Williams. Beshear's plan involved moving $166 million from the second year of the biennial budget to cover the shortfall and cover the costs in the second year through savings achieved by switching to a managed care plan for Medicaid. Williams' plan, passed by the Republican majority in the state senate, called for $101 million in cuts to state government spending to cover the shortfall. Without a plan in place, Beshear estimated that the state would have to cut Medicaid reimbursements to health care providers by 30 percent.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background This paper {{describes}} the methods, strategies and insights gained from a scoping study using a “Two-Eyed Seeing” approach. An evolving technique, Two-Eyed Seeing respects and integrates {{the strengths of}} Indigenous knowledge and Western sciences, often “weaving back and forth” between the two worldviews. The scoping study was used to inform a tool for measuring the impact of culturally based <b>addictions</b> <b>treatment</b> services on wellness in Indigenous populations. It formed part of a three-year study, Honouring Our Strengths: Indigenous Culture as Intervention in <b>Addictions</b> <b>Treatment.</b> The scoping study identified and mapped literature on cultural interventions in <b>addictions</b> <b>treatment,</b> and described the nature, extent and gaps in literature. Methods Using a Two-Eyed Seeing approach, we adapted, applied and enhanced a common framework of scoping studies. In the end stage of the scoping review process, an Ad Hoc Review Group, led by our project Elder, reviewed and interpreted Indigenous and Western understandings within the mapped information. Elements of the scoping study were joined with results from community focus groups with staff at treatment centres. Results Two-Eyed Seeing contributed differently at each stage of the scoping study. In early stages, it clarified team expertise and potential contributions. At the mid-point, it influenced our shift from a systematic to a scoping review. Near the end, it incorporated Western and Indigenous knowledge to interpret and synthesize evidence from multiple sources. Conclusions This paper adds to the collective work on augmenting the methodology of scoping studies. Despite the challenges of a Two-Eyed Seeing approach, it enables researchers using scoping studies to develop knowledge that is better able to translate into meaningful findings for Indigenous communities...|$|R
