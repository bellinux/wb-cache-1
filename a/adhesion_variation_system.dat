Such method takes effect on guarantee safety operation of vehicle and avoid wheel-set flatness, however it cannot adapt {{itself to the}} rail <b>adhesion</b> <b>variation.</b> While wheel-sets slide, the operating status is chaotic time series with certain law, and can be predicted with the law and experiment data in certain time. The predicted values {{can be used as}} the input reference signals of vehicle anti-slide control system, to judge and control the slide status of wheel-sets. In this article, the RBF neural networks is taken to predict wheel-set slide status in multi-step with weight vector adjusted based on online self-adaptive algorithm, and the center & normalizing parameters of active function of the hidden unit of RBF neural networks’ hidden layer computed with K-means clustering algorithm. With multi-step prediction simulation, the predicted signal with appropriate precision can be used by anti-slide system to trace actively and adjust wheel-set slide tendency, so as to adapt to wheel-rail <b>adhesion</b> <b>variation</b> and reduce the risk of wheel-set blocking...|$|R

Pathogens {{such as the}} Lyme disease bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi have evolved antigenic <b>variation</b> <b>systems</b> that are necessary for survival within the adverse immune environment. Although antigenic <b>variation</b> <b>systems</b> are essential to both microbial pathogenesis and microbial evolution, it is largely unclear what selective forces have influenced the evolution of antigenic <b>variation</b> <b>systems.</b> In this thesis, we investigate evolution of the vls antigenic <b>variation</b> <b>system</b> in B. burgdorferi by asking two major questions: First, what traits relevant to the vls antigenic <b>variation</b> <b>system</b> have natural selection acted on? Second, how did the selective forces shape the genetic sequences of the vls antigenic <b>variation</b> <b>systems?</b> We characterize sources of natural selection using mathematical modeling, computational simulation and mutagenesis experiments. Our findings show that natural selection has promoted diversity among VlsE variants on both sequence and structure by organizing the variable sites in the vls unexpressed cassettes. We also show {{that the level of}} diversity among the VlsE variants may strongly influence the within-host dynamics of Bb, an important fitness component of B. burgdorferi. Finally, our results indicate that diversity among VlsE variants might be constrained by purifying or stabilizing selections on translational efficiency and structural stability of the VlsE variants. ...|$|R

40|$|Sequences of {{the most}} conserved {{proteins}} encoded by transposable (pro) phages were used to search recently sequenced Firmicute genomes for candidate transposable prophages. One complete Mu-like prophage, SglyMu- 1, was identified, in four copies, in the Syntrophobotulus glycolicus DSM 8271 chromosome sequence. Related prophages were also found in partially assembled genomic sequences of other Firmicutes and newly sequenced Proteobacteria genomes, opening {{the road to the}} use of Mu-like derived genetic tools in Gram+ bacteria.

The traditional approach to the development of such vehicles requires a thorough design of each subsystem and conducting a number of expensive full scale tests for validation the accuracy of connections between these subsystems.

40|$|Contingency {{genes are}} common in {{pathogenic}} microbes and enable, through pre-emptive mutational events, rapid, clonal switches in phenotype that are conducive to survival and proliferation in hosts. Antigenic variation, which is a highly successful survival strategy employed by eubacterial and eukaryotic pathogens, involves large repertoires of distinct contingency genes that are expressed differentially, enabling evasion of host acquired immunity. Most, but not all, antigenic <b>variation</b> <b>systems</b> make extensive use of subtelomeres. Study of model systems has shown that subtelomeres have unusual properties, including reversible silencing of genes mediated by proteins binding to the telomere, and engagement in ectopic recombination with other subtelomeres. There is a general theory that subtelomeric location confers a capacity for gene diversification through such recombination, although experimental evidence {{is that there is}} no increased mitotic recombination at such loci and that sequence homogenisation occurs. Possible benefits of subtelomeric location for pathogen contingency systems are reversible gene silencing, which could contribute to systems for gene switching and mutually exclusive expression, and ectopic recombination, leading to gene family diversification.

40|$|Variations {{in service}} {{delivery}} {{have been identified}} as a major challenge to the success of process improvement studies in service departments of hospital such as radiology. Largely, these variations are due to inherent system level factors, i. e., <b>system</b> <b>variations</b> such as unavailability of resources (nurse, bed, doctors, and equipment). These <b>system</b> <b>variations</b> are largely unnecessary/unwarranted and mostly lead to longer waiting times, delays, and lowered productivity of the service units. There is limited research on identifying <b>system</b> <b>variations</b> and modelling them for service improvements within hospital. Therefore, this paper proposes a modelling methodology to model <b>system</b> <b>variations</b> in radiology based on real time locating system (RTLS) tracking data. The methodology employs concepts from graph theory to identify and represent <b>system</b> <b>variations.</b> In particular, edge coloured directed multi-graphs (ECDMs) are used to model <b>system</b> <b>variations</b> which are reflected in paths adopted by staff, i. e., sequence of rooms/areas traversed while delivering services. The main steps of the methodology are: (i) identifying the most standard path followed by staff for service delivery; (ii) filtering the redundant events in RTLS tracking database for analysis; (iii) identifying rooms/areas of hospital site involved in the service delivery; (iv) determining patterns of paths adopted by staff from filtered tracking database; and, (v) representation of patterns in graph based model called as edge coloured directed multigraphs (ECDMs) of a role. A case study of MR scanning process is utilized to illustrate the implementation of the proposed methodology for modelling <b>system</b> <b>variations</b> reflected in the paths adopted by staff...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Veterinary Microbiology and Pathology, Washington State UniversityRelapsing fever is a tick-borne {{bacterial}} disease {{caused by a}} number of species in the genus Borrelia. Persistence is a key component of the lifecycle of relapsing fever Borrelia as it improves the chance for tick acquisition and subsequent transmission. During infection of the mammalian host, persistence is achieved through antigenic variation, where the pathogen sequentially changes its immunodominant outer surface lipoprotein to evade the host’s immune response. Correspondingly, this antigenic <b>variation</b> <b>system</b> is directly responsible for the episodic febrile events characteristic of relapsing fever. Besides the antigenic <b>variation</b> <b>system,</b> no other factors required for B. hermsii persistence have been identified. In this dissertation, two distinct, putative determinants for B. hermsii persistence were investigated: a DNA adenine-specific methyltransferase gene (dam), and two cis-acting components of the within-host antigenic <b>variation</b> <b>system.</b> 	Because Dams in other pathogens have a demonstrated role in pathogenesis and persistence, a putative dam of B. hermsii was investigated for its requirement in infectivity and persistence. The results of this study are reported in chapter two. First, the putative B. hermsii dam locus was verified as a Dam. The locus in B. hermsii was then disrupted through allelic exchange, generating a dam- B. hermsii strain. After verifying the absence of Dam function, it was determined that the mutant was infectious and persistent in immunocompetent mice. Overall, findings from this study verified that dam is not a determinant for B. hermsii persistence. 	In chapter three, two cis-acting DNA elements, the upstream homology sequence (UHS) and downstream homology sequence (DHS), were investigated for their role in the gene conversion event responsible for antigenic variation. Employing a targeted deletion-in cis complementation technique that has not previously been applied to any relapsing fever Borrelia spp., the UHS and DHS elements were genetically mutated in B. hermsii. Murine infection with the mutants revealed that that the UHS and a portion of the DHS are required for antigenic variation due to the observed lack of persistence in immunocompetent mice. These are the first studies to establish the importance of the UHS and DHS using a direct, mutational approach. Washington State University, Veterinary Microbiology and Patholog...|$|R
