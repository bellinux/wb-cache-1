You probably know who he is, and you probably have read about his results by now, but what he achieved during this Olympiad is absolutely tremendous. He {{is by no means}} a young man by now and he... played a tremendous level of opposition. The Philippines are a decently strong team and they played very, very decent opposition almost throughout the tournament. The result Eugenio showed in this event is absolutely fantastic.|$|E

25|$|Paifu and José {{decide to}} go to the house of a human rumored to be a murderer. Paifu notices what appears to be an orange spirit out in the sea and {{mistakes}} it for their friend. They arrive at the light source only to find that it was a torch on a raft belonging to the world-renowned sumo wrestler Maruyama, whom they feared. In spite of becoming acquainted, Maruyama teases Paifu and picks up two sticks producing a cross gesture to scare him off believing he, like some vampires in stories, fear a cross. On the contrary, this action forces Paifu to transform into a rampaging were-koala. His rage is halted by José, who shape-shifts into a round object to revert him back to normal. José tells Maruyama that Paifu can not look at a cross figure for more than three seconds before transforming. When asked by Maruyama about Paifu's father, Paifu replies that he was shot to death in a human city when he shape-shifted into a were-koala. After getting to know <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> Maruyama's past, it turns out that he is not as frightening as rumored to be.|$|E

500|$|In {{his review}} for the Los Angeles Times, Kenneth Turan wrote, [...] "It's got some {{effective}} moments and aspects, {{but the film}} goes {{in and out of}} plausibility, and its elements never manage to unify into a coherent whole". Claudia Puig, in her review for USA Today, wrote, [...] "The dialogue by screenwriter Eric Warren Singer is spotty. There are some great, pithy lines and others whose attempt at profundity ring false". Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and wrote, [...] "Clive Owen makes a semi-believable hero, not performing too many feats that are physically unlikely. He's handsome and has the obligatory macho stubble, but he has a quality that makes you worry <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> him". Entertainment Weekly gave the film a [...] "B–" [...] rating and Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote, [...] "the star of the pic may well be NYC's Guggenheim Museum and Istanbul's Grand Bazaar, both of which figure in cool action chase sequences that pay handsome dividends".|$|E

[...] Neil Genzlinger of The New York Times was also pleased, calling the show [...] "nothing if not magnanimous, sending even the losing teams home with a little something for their charities. A spirit of good will prevails." [...] Hank Stuever of The Washington Post was critical, calling the series [...] "just as dull as it sounds," [...] and arguing that [...] "weariness" [...] could be detected in Foxworthy's hosting. Rebecca Cusey of Patheos recommended the series for Christians in particular, saying, [...] "Those that take the Bible as the word of God will enjoy this show." [...] Additionally, Bounce TV expressed excitement when announcing their acquisition of the series in 2013; network chief operating officer Jonathan Katz commented, [...] "We are very confident that the broadcast premieres of The American Bible Challenge and Catch 21 will add fuel to Bounce TV’s skyrocketing growth." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1974, Boortz {{enrolled}} in then-unaccredited John Marshall Law School (Atlanta) going to class {{in his spare}} time, while {{he and his wife}} Donna worked full-time loading mail trucks. Boortz credits his wife with providing [...] "the money to keep me in law school". After graduating from law school in 1977, Boortz practiced law in a solo law firm from 1977 through 1993. During that period, he divided his time between his law practice and work in radio. One of Boortz's clients was boxer Evander Holyfield. Holyfield later sued Boortz and other members of his management team {{in the aftermath of a}} failed Subaru dealership investment. Boortz told Atlanta Magazine [...] "It had nothing to do with representing him as a boxer. It was settled and disappeared." [...] Some time later, in a heated on-air exchange between Atlanta mayor Bill Campbell and Boortz, Campbell remarked on the Holyfield relationship: Campbell (sarcastically): By the way, Neal, Evander Holyfield sends his regards ... We talked <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> how good he's doing now and the fact he's getting ready to open up his 57,000 square-foot, $20 million home. How he's fighting for $35 million a fight. I was sorta thinking about when you were representing him. He was living in an apartment over on Lenox Road. He was fighting for about $20,000 a fight. It's sort of interesting how your great legal skills have transferred into financial well-being for Evander .... Boortz responded by calling mayor Campbell an [...] "unethical son of a bitch". Boortz later remarked [...] "It's the only time I've ever been on the air that I lost control." [...] In 1993, Boortz closed his law practice and devoted his full-time to his radio career.|$|E
2500|$|On March 27, 2008, the Pew Research Center {{called the}} speech [...] "arguably the biggest {{political}} {{event of the}} campaign so far", noting that 85 percent of Americans said they had heard at least <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> the speech and that 54 percent said they {{heard a lot about}} it.

I think this is important to note because that means changes will be made to future construction in this area.|$|E

2500|$|Torsten Billman's cousin on his mother's side Nils Svahn (1890–1936) was an {{editorial}} cartoonist {{at the newspaper}} Social-Demokraten, in Stockholm 1920–29. During Torsten's visit in Stockholm {{in the autumn of}} 1929, Nils explained <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> the woodcut for Torsten. Returned to Kullavik from military service in the Navy in Karlskrona, as a stoker on HMS Sverige 1929–30, he made his first woodcuts Hands (1930) and Thirst (1930) as an unemployed stoker. Billman had not been to any art museum or anything like that and he know nothing about woodcut technique, so his first wood engravings was cut out of the wood of a margarine case with an ordinary carpenter's knife. Artistically he was [...] "the complete savage", but he became interested when he saw reproductions of Frans Masereel and Käthe Kollwitz and when he later saw lithographs by Honoré Daumier it was a stirring experience for him.|$|E
2500|$|Lord Bowen was {{regarded}} with great affection by all {{who knew him}} either professionally or privately. He had a polished and graceful wit, of which many instances might be given, although such anecdotes lose force in print. For example, when it was suggested {{on the occasion of}} an address to Queen Victoria, to be presented by her judges, that a passage in it, [...] "conscious as we are of our shortcomings," [...] suggested too great humility, he proposed the emendation [...] "conscious as we are of one another's shortcomings"; and on another occasion he defined a jurist as [...] "a person who knows <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> the laws of every country except his own". Lord Bowen's judicial reputation will rest upon the series of judgments delivered by him in the court of appeal, which are remarkable for their lucid interpretation of legal principles as applied to the facts and business of life.|$|E
2500|$|A {{cross-sectional}} {{study was conducted}} in Regina, Saskatchewan in February 2009 at 3 different grocery stores located in 3 different regions that had the same median income before taxes of around $30,000. [...] Of the 211 respondents to the study, most were women who purchased most of the food for their household. When asked how they decide what food to buy, the most important factors were price, nutritional value, and need. When looking at the nutritional facts, however, they indicated that they looked at the ingredients, and neglected {{to pay attention to the}} amount of trans fat. This means that trans fat is not on their minds unless they are specifically told of it. When asked if they ever heard about trans fat, 98% said, [...] "Yes." [...] However, only 27% said that it was unhealthy. Also, 79% said that they only knew <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>about</b> trans fats, and could have been more educated. Respondents aged 41–60 were more likely to view trans fat as a major health concern, compared to ages 18–40. When asked if they would stop buying their favorite snacks if they knew it contained trans fat, most said they would continue purchasing it, especially the younger respondents. Also, of the respondents that called trans fat a major concern, 56% of them still wouldn't change their diet to non-trans fat snacks. This is because taste and food gratification take precedence over perceived risk to health. [...] "The consumption of trans fats and the associated increased risk of CHD is a public health concern regardless of age and socioeconomic status".|$|E
