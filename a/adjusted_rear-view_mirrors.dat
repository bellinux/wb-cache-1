50|$|The video {{opens in}} the parking lot of a neon-lit motel around night time. Lauren is in the driver's seat, <b>adjusting</b> her <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror.</b> Each girl steps out of a Dodge Durango. All of them are dressed in retro-style outfits and head towards a room individually. Four doors close {{simultaneously}} as the title of the song appears. Lauren is in a room as dim violet neon lights brighten her room as an electric fan circulates air. The scene is spliced with a scene where the group perform a choreographed dance {{in the parking}} lot of the motel with pinkish-violet stage lights in the ground. Dinah is wearing a fur-style coat with glasses in her individual take. She sings next to a window where a red neon light streaks through the room. Lauren is momentarily shown before Normani's verse is heard. She wears a white and green outfit as she dances sensually through her room in a red setting. The light streaking is normal, compared to the other girls. Close-up shots of her face are shown. Ally then sings, in a bright yellow room. The scene shifts where each girl rapidly performs their dance routine in front of the parking lot, from the start of the video.|$|R
50|$|Depending on {{the type}} of {{motorcycle}}, the motorcycle {{may or may not have}} <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirrors.</b> Street-legal motorcycles are generally required to have <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirrors.</b> Motorcycles for off-road use only normally do not have <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirrors.</b> <b>Rear-view</b> <b>mirrors</b> come in various shapes and designs, and have various methods of mounting the mirrors to the motorcycle, most commonly to the handlebars. <b>Rear-view</b> <b>mirrors</b> can also be attached to the rider's motorcycle helmet.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} improve {{the safety of the}} moving car,we have to make {{simulation}} and analysis of the dynamic characteristics of the car <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror.</b> We should consider, in addition to the geometric dimensions, standards and demands, a reasonable choice of the mirror size and installing position, the dynamic characteristics of the car <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> {{in the design of the}} car <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror.</b> In this paper, we use the finite element software ANSYS to simulate the vibration frequency and vibration modals of the car <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> under the condition of excitation sources. Based on this and the strength analysis results of the <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror,</b> we make a optimal design of the <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> structure. We get five-order vibration modals in working condition and analysis the size of displacement and deformation, and dynamic characteristics. The results show that because of the low modal frequency, the car <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> is easily inspired by the engine, powertrain system and road to vibrate. Besides, the deformation and the strain distribution of the <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> are not uniform. So we should control the low rank flexibility modal frequency within a certain threshold frequency when designing its structure. On the condition of little changes of its overall volume, the maximum equivalent stress of the <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> decreased by 30. 5 % through optimizing design...|$|R

40|$|The <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> is a metaphoric {{favourite}} {{in popular}} culture. This exploratory essay positions the <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> as, predominantly, a quintessentially modern device for reimagining {{the past and}} its relationship to the present and future. Combined with that icon of modern economies, the motorcar, it gives a sense of a paved journey towards the future while from the driver’s seat allowing a framed, receding view of the past. With distance that past can be critically held: ‘it now makes sense’. This sensemaking relies upon a spatial rendering of time that makes past, present and future concrete. However, this dominant metaphor of the <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> in popular culture is supplemented by less certain uses: it can also evoke the uncanny; bring spectres from the past into the present; or heighten our enmeshment with structural power. This essay explores this terrain of the <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> in examples from radio, song, music video and film, and then questions the efficacy of the metaphor in the anthropocene. The <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror,</b> then, is an entry point for considering our engagement with the past, present and future, and how and where is our gaze directed and for whom...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce an {{aerodynamic}} tonal noise from a <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror,</b> active control technique with oscillating jets was utilized. Since the aerodynamic tonal noise of <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror</b> was generated by a small perturbation caused by a small step on a surface of the <b>rear-view</b> <b>mirror,</b> oscillating jets were introduced to break it. Wind tunnel experiments were conducted to measure aerodynamic sound and flow fields around the two dimensional backward-facing step. The experimental {{results showed that the}} noise reduction level depended on the frequency and intensity of the oscillating jets. The noise reduction level was over 20 dB at the oscillation frequency about 400 Hz and the amplitude of the jet about 0. 1 m/s. Both of the frequency and intensity of the jet were smaller than the frequency of the feedback noise (2 kHz) and the velocity of the uniform flow (30 m/s). These results indicated that the oscillating jets effectively reduced aerodynamic noise with small amount of energy...|$|R
