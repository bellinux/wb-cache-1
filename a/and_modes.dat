5|$|Players may {{initially}} {{choose from}} five snowboarding characters: two from Japan, and one each from Canada, USA, and the United Kingdom. Each snowboarder has different abilities and is suited for different levels <b>and</b> <b>modes,</b> since each has varying statistics in {{fields such as}} technique, speed, and weight. Three additional snowboarders are unlocked by completing certain game levels <b>and</b> <b>modes.</b> Eight snowboards are initially available for every character, and one additional snowboard may be unlocked later in the game. Each board also excels in different situations, since each have different strengths in categories such as balance and edge control.|$|E

5|$|ABA Games is a Japanese {{video game}} developer, {{composed}} solely of game designer Kenta Cho. ABA Games' works, available as open source freeware, are predominantly shoot 'em up games often inspired by classic {{games in the}} genre. Its games feature stylised retro graphics, innovative gameplay features <b>and</b> <b>modes</b> and are set in random rather than scripted events. These creations have been acclaimed {{as some of the}} best and well-known independent games available, though some commentators, including Cho himself, feel they are too simple for commercial release.|$|E
5|$|Activision {{introduced}} {{the game in}} May 2003, but in October, Valve experienced a security breach in which hackers stole the source code for Half-Life 2. The breach required new security implementations for the engine, delaying both games; the release of Bloodlines was postponed until early 2005. Until May 2004, Troika and Activision said that the game would feature a multiplayer component <b>and</b> <b>modes</b> including a team of vampires against a team of vampire hunters, {{with the ability to}} upgrade characters between each round. The team was left without a producer by Activision for over a year before David Mullich was assigned to the project. With no producer oversight, Mullich found the game's design incomplete, game levels created and abandoned, and several technical issues, including problems with code for the proposed multiplayer option. The Source multiplayer code was in its infancy, increasing its development time, and the idea was abandoned.|$|E

5|$|Bulgarian {{folk music}} {{is by far}} the most {{extensive}} traditional art and has slowly developed throughout the ages as a fusion of Eastern and Western influences. It contains Far Eastern, Oriental, medieval Eastern Orthodox and standard Western European tonalities <b>and</b> <b>modes.</b> The music has a distinctive sound and uses a wide range of traditional instruments, such as gadulka, gaida (bagpipe), kaval and tupan. One of its most distinguishing features is extended rhythmical time, which has no equivalent in the rest of European music. The State Television Female Vocal Choir is the most famous performing folk ensemble, and received a Grammy Award in 1990. Bulgaria's written musical composition can be traced back to the early Middle Ages and the works of Yoan Kukuzel (c. 1280–1360). Classical music, opera and ballet are represented by composers Emanuil Manolov, Pancho Vladigerov and Georgi Atanasov and singers Ghena Dimitrova, Boris Hristov and Nikolay Gyaurov. Bulgarian performers have gained popularity in several other genres like progressive rock (FSB), electropop (Mira Aroyo) and jazz (Milcho Leviev).|$|E
5|$|Ryse was {{originally}} revealed as a Xbox 360 title {{that was set}} {{to be released in}} early 2011.

It was reintroduced as Ryse: Son of Rome at Microsoft's press conference at E3 2013 with a gameplay demo. The game served as a launch title for the Xbox One, and was released on November 22, 2013. The season pass, featuring different in-game bonuses and items, was released on the same day. The game was supported with downloadable content upon launch. Mars’ Chosen, Morituri Pack, Duel of Fates Pack, and Colosseum Pack were released from 2013 to 2014 and featured new maps <b>and</b> <b>modes</b> for the multiplayer portion of the game. A Legendary Collection, which featured the base game, the game's seasonal pass, and all the additional content released for the game, was released on October 7, 2014.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, the {{problems}} of robust quantized feedback control are studied for hybrid stochastic systems based on discrete-time observations of state <b>and</b> <b>mode.</b> All of the existing results in this area design the quantized feedback control based on continuous observations of the state <b>and</b> <b>mode</b> for all time t ≥ 0 (see [23 – 25]). This is the first paper where we propose to use the quantized feedback control based on discrete-time observations of the state <b>and</b> <b>mode.</b> The key {{reason for this is}} to reduce the burden of communication by using not only the quantization (i. e. in the direction of state axis), but also discrete-time observations of state <b>and</b> <b>mode</b> (i. e. in the direction of time axis). Thus, the designed quantized feedback controllers have {{to be based on the}} discrete-time observations of state <b>and</b> <b>mode.</b> Clearly, the new quantized feedback controllers are more realistic and cost less in practice. Two examples with computer simulations will be provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method...|$|R

Some incidents of intermodal entanglement in the spontaneous and the partially spontaneous Raman processes are also reported. Further it is shown that the specific choice of coupling constants may produce genuine entanglement among Stokes <b>mode,</b> anti-Stokes <b>mode</b> <b>and</b> vibration-phonon <b>mode.</b> It is also shown that the two mode entanglement not identified by Duan's criterion may be identified by Hillery-Zubairy criteria.
