The {{amount of money}} awarded depends on the income of the Nobel Foundation that year. If a prize is awarded {{to more than one}} laureate, the money is either split evenly among them or, for three laureates, it may be divided into a half and two quarters.|$|E
5|$|Compton {{spent a year}} as <b>a</b> <b>physics</b> {{instructor}} at the University of Minnesota in 1916–17, then two years as a research engineer with the Westinghouse Lamp Company in Pittsburgh, where {{he worked on the}} development of the sodium-vapor lamp. During World War I he developed aircraft instrumentation for the Signal Corps.|$|E
5|$|After his release, Payá {{enrolled}} in the University of Havana as <b>a</b> <b>physics</b> major, but was expelled when authorities discovered {{him to be a}} practicing Christian; he then attended night school and switched his major to telecommunications. Payá later became an engineer and worked at a state surgical-equipment company. He was offered an opportunity to leave Cuba in the 1980 Mariel boatlift, but chose to remain in Cuba and work for change. He married Ofelia Acevedo in 1986 in a Catholic wedding. The pair had three children: Oswaldo José, Rosa María, and Reinaldo Isaías.|$|E

5|$|Around {{this time}} Johann Bernoulli's two sons, Daniel and Nicolaus, were {{working at the}} Imperial Russian Academy of Sciences in Saint Petersburg. On 31 July 1726, Nicolaus died of {{appendicitis}} after spending {{less than a year}} in Russia, and when Daniel assumed his brother's position in the mathematics/physics division, he recommended that the post in physiology that he had vacated be filled by his friend Euler. In November 1726 Euler eagerly accepted the offer, but delayed making the trip to Saint Petersburg while he unsuccessfully applied for <b>a</b> <b>physics</b> professorship at the University of Basel.|$|E
5|$|Coghill {{attended}} Nambour State High School in Nambour, Queensland {{where his}} father was <b>a</b> <b>Physics</b> teacher, graduating in 1988. While in high school, Coghill's ambitions were not directed towards music, as he {{expressed an interest in}} football or surfing. Upon graduating, he moved to Queensland's state capital Brisbane and began studying Botany at the University of Queensland, however was interested in the Brisbane local music scene. Before long, Coghill had begun playing drums for local bands including side project Shock Fungus.|$|E
5|$|Einstein's {{equations}} are nonlinear partial {{differential equations}} and, as such, difficult to solve exactly. Nevertheless, {{a number of}} exact solutions are known, although only a few have direct physical applications. The best-known exact solutions, and also those most interesting from <b>a</b> <b>physics</b> point of view, are the Schwarzschild solution, the Reissner–Nordström solution and the Kerr metric, each corresponding to {{a certain type of}} black hole in an otherwise empty universe, and the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker and de Sitter universes, each describing an expanding cosmos. Exact solutions of great theoretical interest include the Gödel universe (which opens up the intriguing possibility of time travel in curved spacetimes), the Taub-NUT solution (a model universe that is homogeneous, but anisotropic), and anti-de Sitter space (which has recently come to prominence in the context of what is called the Maldacena conjecture).|$|E

5|$|Fay {{enrolled}} at the University of Chicago as <b>a</b> <b>physics</b> major, but she changed her major to chemistry after taking a course in that subject from Julius Stieglitz. He was an influential chemist who {{became a member of}} the National Academy of Sciences and president of the American Chemical Society. Fay completed a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in chemistry in 1904 and 1905, respectively. For about a year, Fay was a college chemistry instructor, though there are conflicting sources as to the name of the college.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, <b>a</b> <b>physics</b> {{professor}} at the University of Central Florida wrote a paper arguing that it is mathematically impossible for vampires to exist, based on geometric progression. According to the paper, if the first vampire had appeared on 1 January 1600, and it fed once a month (which is less often than what is depicted in films and folklore), and every victim turned into a vampire, then within {{two and a half}} years the entire human population of the time would have become vampires.|$|E
5|$|Leo James Rainwater {{was born}} on December 9, 1917, in Council, Idaho, {{the son of a}} former civil {{engineer}} who ran the local general store, Leo Jaspar Rainwater and his wife Edna Eliza née Teague. He never used his first name and was always referred to as James or Jim. His father died in the great influenza epidemic of 1918 and Rainwater and his mother moved to Hanford, California, where she married George Fowler, a widower with two sons, Freeman and John. In time he also acquired a half-brother, George Fowler, Jr., who became naval officer. At high school he excelled in mathematics, chemistry and physics and was admitted to the California Institute of Technology on the strength of a chemistry competition. He received his Bachelor of Science degree as <b>a</b> <b>physics</b> major in 1939.|$|E
50|$|He {{graduated}} with <b>a</b> BS in <b>physics</b> in 1960 at National Taiwan University (NTU), <b>an</b> MS in <b>physics</b> at National Tsing Hua University (Hsinchu) in 1962, and earned <b>a</b> Ph.D. in <b>physics</b> in 1968 at Harvard University, {{under the supervision}} of Julian Schwinger.|$|R

5|$|Princeton did not rehire Wigner {{when his}} {{contract}} ran out in 1936. Through Gregory Breit, Wigner found new employment at the University of Wisconsin. There {{he met his}} first wife, Amelia Frank, who was <b>a</b> <b>physics</b> student there. However she died unexpectedly in 1937, leaving Wigner distraught. He therefore accepted a 1938 offer from Princeton to return there. Wigner became a naturalized citizen of the United States on January 8, 1937, and he brought his parents to the United States.|$|E
5|$|There are {{multiple}} scenarios for known risks {{that can have}} a global impact on the planet. From the perspective of humanity, these can be subdivided into survivable risks and terminal risks. Risks that humanity pose to itself include climate change, the misuse of nanotechnology, a nuclear holocaust, warfare with a programmed superintelligence, a genetically engineered disease, or a disaster caused by <b>a</b> <b>physics</b> experiment. Similarly, several natural events may pose a doomsday threat, including a highly virulent disease, the impact of an asteroid or comet, runaway greenhouse effect, and resource depletion. There {{may also be the}} possibility of an infestation by an extraterrestrial lifeform. The actual odds of these scenarios are difficult if not impossible to deduce.|$|E
5|$|While at high school, Levi {{decided that}} she would become a scientist. Her final year was devoted to <b>a</b> <b>physics</b> project on spectra and photography, which became her Oberreal Abiturium. She was the only girl in her class to major in physics that year. After her {{graduation}} in April 1928, her father sent her to England for six months to learn English and good manners. She entered the University of Munich in 1929, where she listened to lectures by Arnold Sommerfeld. For her doctorate, her father managed to get her accepted into the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry at Berlin-Dahlem, where she wrote her thesis on the spectra of alkali metal halides, {{under the supervision of}} Peter Pringsheim and Fritz Haber.|$|E

5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{site was}} found at 1601 W. First Street that had originally been constructed to house the Bonebrake Seminary. It was a three-story brick building built in 1879, and owned by the Dayton Board of Education, which {{used it as a}} warehouse. Monsanto leased the site on 15 October 1943, and began converting it into a laboratory known as Unit III. New heating and lighting were installed, windows were replaced, new flooring was laid, and some rooms were re-plastered. A pair of guard houses known as buildings J and K were added, as was a chemical storage shed known as building F, and a wire fence. Laboratory activities were transferred there from Unit I on 25 September. In May 1945, five additional temporary buildings were constructed on land leased from the Board of Education that housed offices, a cafeteria, locker rooms, <b>a</b> <b>physics</b> laboratory and a laundry. A new guardhouse was also built. To this was added two portable buildings in 1946.|$|E

25|$|Alhazen disproved Ptolemy's {{theory of}} vision, {{but did not}} make any {{corresponding}} changes to Aristotle's metaphysics. The scientific revolution ran concurrently to a process where elements of Aristotle's metaphysics such as ethics, teleology and formal causality slowly fell out of favour. Scholars slowly {{came to realize that}} the universe itself might well be devoid of both purpose and ethical imperatives. Many of the restrictions described by Aristotle and later favoured by the Catholic Church were thus challenged. This development from <b>a</b> <b>physics</b> infused with goals, ethics, and spirit, toward <b>a</b> <b>physics</b> where these elements do not play an integral role, took centuries.|$|E
