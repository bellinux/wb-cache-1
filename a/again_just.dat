5|$|In {{the third}} stage, four cyclists (Julien Gabory, Henri Gauban, Gaston Tuvache and Maurice Carrere) were disqualified {{for taking the}} train. The Ballon d'Alsace, which {{had been the first}} real {{mountain}} in the Tour de France the previous year, was featured <b>again.</b> <b>Just</b> as the year before, it was mounted first by Pottier. The stage was also won by Pottier, more than 45 minutes ahead of the rest.|$|E
5|$|President drew {{away while}} her crew made hurried repairs of their own. Within two hours, {{one of her}} lookouts spotted the {{remainder}} of the enemy squadron drawing near. President continued her escape attempt, but by nightfall HMS Pomone and Tenedos had caught up and began firing broadsides. Realizing his situation, Decatur surrendered President <b>again,</b> <b>just</b> before midnight.|$|E
5|$|After leaving Allegan, M-89 runs roughly {{parallel}} with the Kalamazoo River for approximately , passing through mostly rural areas with residences and agricultural fields. The highway curves {{to the east and}} crosses the Kalamazoo River <b>again</b> <b>just</b> west of the city of Otsego. The trunkline curves to the south in the city then again runs east to junction with US131 at exit49 {{on the west side of}} Plainwell. East of US131, the highway passes through the city of Plainwell and crosses the Kalamazoo River again before continuing into rural areas again. The route heads the southeast on towards the village of Richland.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{initially}} conceded discovery {{credit to}} Ortiz, but came to suspect the Spanish team of fraud upon learning that his observation logs were accessed from the Spanish observatory {{the day before}} the discovery announcement. These logs included enough information to allow the Ortiz team to precover Haumea in their 2003 images, and they were accessed <b>again</b> <b>just</b> before Ortiz scheduled telescope time to obtain confirmation images for a second announcement to the MPC on July 29. Ortiz later admitted he had accessed the Caltech observation logs but denied any wrongdoing, stating he was merely verifying whether they had discovered a new object.|$|E
5|$|In {{downtown}} Jackson, Michigan Avenue continues into downtown while M-50 is routed {{around the}} city center along paired one-way streets. Washington Street carries eastbound traffic and the Louis Glick Highway. On {{the east side of}} downtown, the roads merge near the Jackson Amtrak station and a junction with M-106 on Cooper Street, where M-50 turns south and then southeast as Brooklyn Road. On the south side of Jackson, M-50 and US127 meet up once <b>again</b> <b>just</b> east of Vandercook Lake. M-50 follows the US127 freeway through a pair of conjoined partial interchanges before M-50 heads east away from Vandercook Lake.|$|E
5|$|Liukin {{decided that}} she was not done with {{gymnastics}} and made her first post-Olympics competitive appearance at the CoverGirl Classic, where she competed only on balance beam. She placed second behind teammate Ivana Hong. Liukin thought about competing uneven bars and beam at the U.S. Championships, but decided to once <b>again</b> <b>just</b> perform on beam. She placed fourth and looked on track to possibly make a fourth World Championships team. Liukin was added to the national team and included in the World Championships selection camp. However, she pulled out of Worlds selection consideration because she felt {{that she was not}} quite up to World Championships standards.|$|E

5|$|Nibali {{attacked}} <b>again</b> <b>just</b> {{after the}} summit and rode alone down the descent. Despite almost colliding with a race motorbike at one point, {{he used his}} strong descending skills to gain an advantage {{over the rest of}} the group. He used the whole width of the road and coming very close to the crash barriers at various moments. Rosa, meanwhile, came {{to the head of the}} group in an attempt to slow the chase down. Nibali's lead at the foot of the descent was around 40 seconds.|$|E
5|$|The {{group was}} {{reactivated}} <b>again</b> <b>just</b> {{prior to the}} Korean War, on 29 October 1948 at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. It was dispatched to the Korean peninsula where it remained during three campaigns of the war, receiving three campaign streamers. However, as the war became a long, drawn out stalemate and with {{no need for the}} military government group, it was deactivated in Korea on 28 October 1951 {{in the middle of the}} war.|$|E

The Bureau immediately issued a Severe Thunderstorm Warning for the coastal region between Brisbane and the Sunshine Coast, 100km to the north.|$|E

Meanwhile, Kiara cannot stop thinking about Akash, and on the 31st she realises that she has fallen for him. Kunal discovers this and drops Kiara off at the airport. She reaches the bridge, but finds herself alone, believing she will never see Akash <b>again.</b> <b>Just</b> then he arrives. The pair go out to sea to die. Akash throws a beer bottle with a note in it, which Kiara gets and reads before he proposes to her. Surprised, she accepts, and the couple share a kiss while the Coast Guard rescues them. As the credits roll, Akash and Kiara are shown two years later, married with their baby boy.|$|E
5|$|BMC {{came to the}} Giro {{without a}} real overall {{classification}} hopeful. Sporting director Fabio Baldato stated that the team's nine-man squad was designed {{to give them a}} chance at a stage win every day, with Kristoff for the sprints, Kohler, Wyss, and Zahner for the breakaways, and Tschopp and Frank for the climbs. Rounding out the squad were young Americans Barton, Beyer, and Butler, riding the Giro mainly for experience. They constituted three of the seven Americans in the Giro peloton. The team's preparation for the Giro was also affected by the Mantova investigation, which resulted in the team's banning of Ballan and Santambrogio for the second time, after a previous ban in April 2010. <b>Again</b> <b>just</b> as in 2010, the two were reactivated shortly after the Giro concluded.|$|E
5|$|Bok tried {{twice to}} flee from slavery {{at the age}} of 14. The first {{instance}} happened early one morning after he had been sent out with the cattle. Bok blindly ran down a road for several miles before he was captured by one of Giemma's fellow militia members. Giemma's peer returned Francis to the Giemma's compound, where he was beaten with a bullwhip. Bok attempted to escape once <b>again</b> <b>just</b> two days later, when he fled in the opposite direction of his previous escape. He once again fled for several miles, this time keeping to the forest. He stopped for water at a local stream crossing, where he was spotted by Giemma who happened to be there as well. Giemma forced Francis back to his home, this time promising to kill him. Francis was beaten again, but Giemma chose not to kill him, as Francis had become too valuable to the family as a slave.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{opened his}} {{campaign}} with {{a speech at}} Bowling Green on August26, 1899. He answered many allegations {{that had been made}} about him, including claims that he had secretly been seeking the Democratic gubernatorial nomination all along, that he had ambitions of succeeding Senator William Joseph Deboe, and that following the nominating convention, he had agreed to speak on behalf of the Goebel ticket. Brown conceded that he desired Senator Deboe's senate seat and that he had agreed to accept the gubernatorial nomination if it had been offered to him, but he denied that he had ever agreed to speak on Goebel's behalf. Outgoing Senator Blackburn also charged that Brown was bolting the party <b>again,</b> <b>just</b> as he had in supporting Stephen Douglas over John C. Breckinridge for president in 1860. Brown replied by quoting an article by William Jennings Bryan's Omaha World-Herald that asserted the right of an individual to vote against the nominee of his party if the individual deemed the nominee unfit.|$|E
5|$|On Shelter Island itself, NY114 acts as {{the main}} thoroughfare, once again turning along {{different}} local roads. It traverses {{the length of the}} island, and ends in historic Shelter Island Heights at the North Ferry terminal. Once across to Greenport, NY114 ends quickly at NY25, <b>again</b> <b>just</b> a block or so from the heart of the village. Despite the short distance between the North Ferry terminal and the northern terminus, NY114 includes three streets in Greenport. Northbound Route114 runs on Third Street from the ferry terminal to NY25. Southbound NY114 runs along Fifth Street then one block later turns left onto Wiggins Street, where it heads eastbound until it passes the historic Greenport Railroad Station, and terminates at Third Street and the North Ferry terminal. The portion of NY114 within Greenport is maintained by the village.|$|E
5|$|Stein Arvid Huseby, {{originally}} from Karmøy, {{was at the}} time 24 years old. He had just finished studying at a Christian upper secondary school in Trondheim. He had previously been sentenced five times for violence offenses, including an armed robbery of a taxi and threatening a lensmann with a shotgun. He was beaten and abused by his father, and started drinking as a 13-year-old. He lost his job as a seaman due to drunkenness, and was put into a psychiatric institution in 1980, aged 19. In 1983, he was admitted to a Christian school, and had managed to stay away from alcohol for two years, but had started <b>again</b> <b>just</b> prior to the incident. He stated that he was afraid to lose his friends due to his misuse of alcohol.|$|E

5|$|The Reformed {{tradition}} {{holds that}} baptism is primarily God's promise or offer of grace to the baptized. Baptism {{is said to}} signify union with Christ in his death, burial, and resurrection. The baptized is made one with Christ's person, meaning God the Father treats them the same as he treats Christ. Baptism also unites the baptized with Christ's history, meaning that the person {{can be said to}} have died, been buried, and raised <b>again</b> <b>just</b> as Christ was. The baptized person's identity in Christ is based on Christ's action in baptism rather than the person's action. This union also unites Christians to one another. Through the words of institution used in baptism, Christians are also united to each {{of the members of the}} trinity.|$|E
5|$|The highway passes some {{homes and}} forests north of Dunnstown, {{entering}} Woodward Township soon after. At the intersection with Township Road 406, State Route 664 starts winding in several directions, but following a northward basis. This continues until the intersection with Arbutus Drive, where it heads {{straight to the}} northwest. At a clearing in a nearby forest, State Route 664 enters the community of Swissdale. The stay in the community is short, with the highway leaving after a few blocks. Just north of Swissdale, State Route 664 makes a long hairpin turn, curving {{from east to west}} before turning north once <b>again.</b> <b>Just</b> after the intersection with Honey Suckle Lane, State Route 664 progresses towards Haneyville.|$|E
5|$|Through {{his social}} {{contacts}} Widmerpool secures {{a job in}} the politico-legal department of the Donners-Brebner industrial conglomerate, a post that brings him into close contact with Sir Magnus Donners, for whom he exhibits a respect bordering on reverence. He develops a talent for intrigue, which irritates Sir Magnus to the extent that Widmerpool is asked to leave the organisation. He joins a City firm of bill-brokers and still under the age of 30, becomes an influential and respected figure in the financial world. By the late 1930s, Widmerpool is advising Donners-Brebner <b>again.</b> <b>Just</b> before the outbreak of war in September 1939, he oversees a scheme on behalf of Donners to corner the Turkish market in chromite and emerges unscathed when the project collapses.|$|E
