In 2011, the train operated on Saturdays instead of Sundays.|$|E
5|$|Jimenez stopped {{feeding the}} pups <b>after</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> that same year. Though the pups learned to hunt, Silver and Pikuni left {{the pack and}} the other four began killing livestock. They were {{captured}} to be relocated, much as their parents had been. One, Camas, escaped after waking up from the tranquilizer early. Chinook was killed for continuing to hunt livestock and Timber {{was killed by a}} poacher. Tenino, who also continued hunting livestock, was recaptured and sent to Wolf Haven International, a sanctuary in Washington State, where he lived until his death in 2001. The fates of the other cubs, as well as Rann, the cub who escaped the initial relocation, are unknown. In the epilogue of the novel, Bowen expresses hope that they survived and bred, enabling the bloodlines started with Marta and Greatfoot to continue in the wolf packs that now inhabit the area. Jimenez continued working as the Wyoming Wolf Recovery Project Leader for the United States Fish and Wildlife Service until 2008, when he was selected to be the Wyoming Game and Fish Department's Wolf Program Coordinator.|$|E

25|$|The move by {{retailers}} to begin holiday sales during Thanksgiving Day (as {{opposed to the}} traditional day after) has been criticized as forcing (under threat of being fired) low-end retail workers, who compose an increasing share of the nation's workforce, to work odd hours and to handle atypical, unruly crowds on a day reserved for rest. In response to this controversy, Macy's and Best Buy (both of which planned to open on Thanksgiving, even earlier than they had the year before) stated in 2014 that most of their Thanksgiving Day shifts were filled voluntarily by employees who would rather have the day <b>after</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> off instead of Thanksgiving itself. Blue laws in several Northeastern states prevent retailers in those states from opening on Thanksgiving. Such retailers typically open at midnight on the day <b>after</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> to circumvent the laws as much as legally possible.|$|E

25|$|Yield Management also {{includes}} many noncontroversial and more prevalent practices, such as varying prices {{over time to}} reflect demand. This level of yield management makes {{up the majority of}} yield management in the airline industry. For example, airlines may price a ticket on the Sunday <b>after</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> at a higher fare than the Sunday a week later. Alternatively, they may make tickets more expensive when bought at the last minute than when bought six months in advance. The goal of this level of yield management is essentially trying to force demand to equal or exceed supply.|$|E

25|$|Upon the {{original}} {{launch of the}} Thursday and Saturday night games, few television service providers carried the NFL Network due to disputes during the network's terms in its carriage contracts during negotiations.

The first was a matchup between the Dallas Cowboys and Green Bay Packers which was scheduled for the week <b>after</b> <b>Thanksgiving</b> and saw both teams at 10-1, vying for the top seed in the NFC, and the second was Week 17 Saturday night game between the New England Patriots and the New York Giants, where the Patriots {{had a chance to}} become the first team since the 1972 Miami Dolphins to end a regular season undefeated.|$|E
