5000|$|The {{result was}} that the engine would never drop frames when the CPU couldn't handle the {{rendering}} in realtime. Instead, gametime itself was slowed down. The software itself provided an option to display the CPU-load, pressing the [...] "o" [...] key. When this was higher than 100%, the game was no longer working in realtime. This would become known in the community as the infamous [...] "slow-motion driving". Since the rendering was obviously dependent on {{the complexity of the}} scene, this also meant that one could experience slowdowns of the action only on certain parts of certain tracks, or when there <b>were</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>cars</b> around (for example at the start).|$|R

Despite being affordably priced, the 1000 MB was well equipped, with reclining front seats, a heater and demister, full tool kit, and a generously sized boot up front {{as well as a}} useful storage area behind the split/folding rear seat.

40|$|Parking problem {{becomes one}} of major issues in the city {{transportation}} management since the spatial resource of a city is limited and the parking cost <b>is</b> expensive. <b>Lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>cars</b> on the road should spend unnecessary time and consume energy during searching for parking due to limited parking space. To cope with these limitations and give more intelligent solutions to drivers {{in the selection of}} parking facility, this study proposes a smart parking guidance algorithm. The proposed algorithm supports drivers to find the most appropriate parking facility considering real-time status of parking facilities in a city. To suggest the most suitable parking facility, several factors such as driving distance to the guided parking facility, walking distance from the guided parking facility to destination, expected parking cost, and traffic congestion due to parking guidance, are considered in the proposed algorithm. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, simulation tests have been carried out. The proposed algorithm helps to maximize the utilization of space resources of a city, and reduce unnecessary energy consumption and CO 2 emission <b>of</b> wandering <b>cars</b> since it is designed to control the utilization of parking facility efficiently and reduce traffic congestion due to parking space search. close 0...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{waterlogging}} {{happened in}} several cities {{in our country}} which is caused by rainstorm and brought too much trouble to the daily life of local residents. Beijing city has experienced a rainstorm in July 2012, many streets had <b>been</b> submerged, a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> destroyed, and the disaster made huge economic losses and many casualties. Urban drainage system {{is an important part}} of urban Infrastructural facilities, as well as key engineering for preventing waterlogging. As a result, study on problem existed in the urban drainage system construction has become more and more urgent. This paper collected 96 sample points of accumulating water positions and its water depth in Beijing city, and obtained the coordinates of the sample points by the Google Earth, then established the spatial database of the Stormwater point. Based on the vulnerability study of the urban drainage system, the paper is supposed to be useful for the improvement of the drainage system and make some suggestions for the response to the rainstorm disaster...|$|R
40|$|In {{the area}} <b>of</b> <b>Car</b> 2 X communication, {{ensuring}} a good quality secure communication always plays a vital role. One cannot ignore {{the dangers of}} losing data or getting data stolen from the public domain. This, especially when it involves {{the safety of the}} general public. Loss of data between two information exchange systems may lead to unwanted loss, additional overhead of fixing the devices among many others. In today’s world there <b>are</b> a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>car</b> companies that define information exchange models based on their language of programing and also based on the underlying architecture the products of the company are built in. therefore there is always a need to ensure a good communication while ensuring security. Current state-of-the-art techniques involved in the transformation of signals and information between a car and an infrastructure or a machine to machine have the underlying problem of security. The application platform for Intelligent Mobility can be considered as the most advanced form of communication architectures used on the roads today. However, there will always come another better technology as time goes by. The thesis 'Evaluation of OPC-UA Technology in Car 2 X Communication towards an Industry 4. 0 Driven Automotive Domain' has been done at DLR, Braunschweig along with the Faculty of Science in Chemnitz University of Technology. The purpose of this thesis is to bring about a technology into the automotive domain, which can be made into a standard for security and robustness. The layered chapters of this thesis researches into the possibilities of an alternate to the current standards. The application is implemented by the use of a server-client model for information exchange. The evaluation is done based on the results and the huge potential OPC UA carries in the automation industry...|$|R
50|$|As we {{came around}} the way, there <b>were</b> a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> Jewish inmates {{coming out of the}} camp, and I heard that the gate was opened by our {{advanced}} scouts. They took a rifle and shot it. I think it was a fellow from Hawaii that did that. I think it was a Captain Taylor, Company B was one of them, but another person from Hawaii, he passed away. They opened the gate and all these German, I mean, Jewish victims were coming out of the camp.Then, when we finally opened the Dachau camp, got in, oh those people were so afraid of us, I guess. You could see the fear in their face. But eventually, they realized that we were there to liberate them and help them.They were all just skin and bones, sunken eyes. I think they were more dead than they were alive because they hadn't eaten so much because, I think, just before we got there the S.S. people had all pulled back up and they were gone. But, we went there, and outside of the camps there <b>were</b> a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> railroad <b>cars</b> there that had bodies in them. I had the opportunity to go into the camp there, but you could smell the stench. The people were dead and piled up in the buildings, and it was just unbelievable that the Germans could do that to the Jewish people. I really didn't think it was possible at all actually.|$|R
2500|$|Kevin Harvick {{dominated}} {{the race to}} score the victory. [...] "Wow. I guess that's {{what it feels like}} to hit a walkoff in extra innings. I mean this thing -- both races here -- has been bad to the bone," [...] Harvick said after winning his fourth race at this 1-mile oval in the last five tries. Harvick would not have made the final four to race for the title without a win. I could tell that we were going to have to win because everybody was running in the front of the pack that we were racing against. I think this says a lot about our team. We had our backs against the wall. We're in victory lane and we get to go on." [...] In the final turn, Ryan Newman sent Kyle Larson into the wall to secure his place in the championship race. “I just gave it my all,” Newman said. “I wasn’t proud of it but did what I had to get to this next round. That little boy has got a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> things coming in this sport and he used me up like that in a truck at Eldora a couple years ago. From my standpoint, I call it even but I think if he was in my position, he’d have done the same thing.” [...] "Coming to the finish, there <b>were</b> a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>cars</b> racing really hard,” said Larson today. “I knew (Newman) was right around me and knew he needed to gain some spots to keep from getting eliminated from the Chase. It's a little upsetting he pushed me up to the wall, but I completely understand the situation he was in,” said Larson, “(I) can't fault him for being aggressive there. I think a <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> drivers out here would have done something similar if they were in that position." [...] Kevin Harvick (with the much-needed win), Joey Logano, Denny Hamlin, and Ryan Newman were the four drivers who will race for the championship, which also meant that NASCAR will be having a new Sprint Cup Series champion. Jeff Gordon, Carl Edwards, Brad Keselowski, and Matt Kenseth were the four drivers eliminated.|$|R
