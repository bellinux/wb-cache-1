500|$|Alice's {{death was}} felt in both Britain and Hesse. The Times wrote: [...] "The humblest of people {{felt that they}} had the kinship of nature with a Princess who was the model of family virtue as a daughter, a sister, <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> mother...Her {{abundant}} sympathies sought for objects of help in the great unknown waste of human distress". The Illustrated London News wrote that the [...] "lesson of the late Princess's life is as noble as it is obvious. Moral worth is far more important than high position". The death was also heavily felt by the royal family, especially by Alice's brother and sister-in-law, the Prince and Princess of Wales. The Princess of Wales, upon meeting the Queen after Alice's death, exclaimed [...] "I wish I had died instead of her". The Prince, meanwhile, wrote to the Earl of Granville that Alice [...] "was my favourite sister. So good, so kind, so clever! We had gone through so much together..." ...|$|E

500|$|Although it {{was decided}} he has a sister, <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> daughter, Meyer's {{personal}} life is rarely mentioned on screen, enabling viewers to perceive him as a strong man onto whom they can [...] "project whatever they want from their own imagination." [...] Irving believes that modern television drama is populated by characters prone to disclosing everything about themselves, and so feels that having an enigmatic character like Meyer, who behaves in the reserved vein of Humphrey Bogart and Spencer Tracy, makes for a [...] "refreshing change". He commented that revealing more of Meyer's personal life would be anticlimatic compared to viewers' expectations. As preparation for the role, Irving observed coronary artery bypass surgery performed at Papworth and Middlesex Hospital, deeming the experience an [...] "enormous privilege". He had a [...] "real fascination" [...] with medicine and the human body prior to assuming the role, and considered studying biology at university. Upon receiving the script for the first episode of Holby City, Irving felt immediately connected to Meyer, commenting: [...] "I knew instinctively how he moved, how he spoke, what he felt. I could feel his heartbeat." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{dialogue}} scene before [...] "There grew {{a little}} flower" [...] (No. 25) was considerably shortened; {{the first version}} exploring the topsy-turvy idea that if Sir Roderic and Dame Hannah were married, her husband would be a ghost, and she would therefore be <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> widow {{at the same time}} (this concept was recycled in The Grand Duke). [...] Roderic originally entered through a trap door in the floor, where red flames could be seen shooting around him. [...] This was changed to an entrance from the picture frame.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the day of}} the shooting, a {{grandfather}} of one of the murdered Amish girls was heard warning some young relatives not to hate the killer, saying, [...] "We must not think evil of this man."

[...] Jack Meyer, a member of the Brethren community living near the Amish in Lancaster County, explained: [...] "I don't think there's anybody here that wants to do anything but forgive and not only reach out to those who have suffered a loss in that way but {{to reach out to the}} family of the man who committed these acts." ...|$|E

The Rabbis compared God's action to those of a king who has both <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> concubine; to his wife he goes openly, but to his concubine he goes stealthily. And a Midrash taught that God's appearance to Laban in [...] and God's appearance to Abimelech in [...] were the two instances where the Pure and Holy One allowed God's self to be associated with impure (idolatrous) people, on behalf of righteous ones.|$|E

2500|$|She did {{not seem}} to have an {{intimate}} relationship with anyone, and always kept her deepest personal feelings to herself. After her younger days, she avoided close friendship with the opposite sex. Once her cousins visited them, she paid Roland to accompany them. In her later years, Evi Ellis, who had shared her bedroom when a child refugee and who was then married to Ernst Wohlgemuth and had moved to Notting Hill from Chicago, tried matchmaking her with Ralph Miliband but failed. Franklin once told Evi that her flatmate asked her for a drink, but she did not get the intention. She was quite infatuated by her French mentor Mering, who had <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> mistress. Mering also admitted that he was captivated by her [...] "intelligence and beauty". According to Sayre, she did confess her feeling for Mering when she was undergoing surgery, but her family denied this. But Mering wept when he visited her later, and destroyed all her letters.|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} the words of [...] "And God came to Balaam at night," [...] {{indicated}} God's distance from Balaam. [...] Rabbi Leazar taught {{that the words}} of [...] "The Lord {{is far from the}} wicked," [...] refer to the prophets of other nations. [...] But the continuation of [...] "He hears the prayer of the righteous," [...] refers to the prophets of Israel. [...] God appears to nations other that Israel only as one who comes from a distance, as [...] says, [...] "They came from a far country to me." [...] But in connection with the prophets of Israel, [...] says, [...] "And the Lord appeared," [...] and [...] says, [...] "And the Lord called," [...] implying from the immediate vicinity. [...] Rabbi Haninah compared the difference between the prophets of Israel and the prophets of other nations to a king who was with his friend in a chamber (separated by a curtain). [...] Whenever the king desired to speak to his friend, he folded up the curtain and spoke to him. [...] (But God speaks to the prophets of other nations without folding back the curtain.) [...] The Rabbis compared it to a king who has <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> concubine; to his wife he goes openly, but to his concubine he repairs with stealth. [...] Similarly, God appears to non-Jews only at night, as [...] says, [...] "And God came to Balaam at night," [...] and [...] says, [...] "And God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream of the night." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, a {{few months}} after the couple's second wedding, the writers {{complicated}} JR and Babe's relationship by having JR try to kill Babe due to a mental breakdown and the belief that he would be saving their son. Not wanting Babe to unjustly die later in life and cause their son the same pain that he went through by losing mother Dixie, or the pain caused by lies, JR reasons that if their son were to lose Babe at an earlier age as opposed to later in life, it will hurt less due to significantly faded memories. In addition, JR was written to fear Babe targeting their son by running away with him and leaving JR without <b>a</b> <b>wife</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> child. JR's murder attempt on Babe was a controversial story arc by the writers (see below), further agitated by Babe's willingness to stand by JR even after the murder attempt, later welcome him into her bed, and stand up for him at his attempted murder trial. JR having accidentally harmed best friend Kendall Hart Slater, who subsequently became comatose as a result of the murder attempt, was also ill-received as viewers felt the character should receive jail time. The writers saw the story arc as an opportunity to further the theme of JR and Babe being true loves. To assist this, ABC ran promotional commercials to the original version of the song [...] "Listen to Your Heart" [...] of Babe voicing heartbreak at knowing JR tried to kill her interspersed with the couple enduring it all.|$|E
