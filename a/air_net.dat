50|$|Early in 1939, {{with the}} growing {{probability}} of war against Great Britain, the Luftwaffe carried out large-scale rescue exercises over water. Land-based German bombers used for search duties proved inadequate in range, so bomber air bases were constructed along the coast to facilitate an <b>air</b> <b>net</b> over the Baltic and North seas. Following this, the Luftwaffe determined to procure a purpose-built air-sea rescue seaplane, choosing the Heinkel He 59, a twin-engine biplane with pontoons. A total of 14 He 59s were sent to be fitted with first aid equipment, electrically heated sleeping bags, artificial respiration equipment, a floor hatch with a telescoping ladder to reach the water, a hoist, signaling devices, and lockers to hold all the gear.|$|E

40|$|Static {{and fatigue}} tests {{were carried out}} on two {{commercial}} modified epoxy film adhesives with a wide open knit polyester carrier in order to compare crack resistance in mode I and mixed mode I-III loading. The carrier cloth is {{found to have a}} significant influence on the cracking behavior of the adhesives. The open <b>air</b> <b>net</b> carrier used in this study separates from the adhesive in mode I cracking but shreds during mixed-mode crack extension. This decreases the opening mode toughness but increases the mixed-mode toughness as compared with results obtained earlier using a heavier knit carrier. The results suggest that the type of carrier may have a far larger influence on crack resistance than is generally recognized...|$|E

40|$|Greenhouse-grown {{plants of}} Xanthium strumarium L. were exposed in a growth cabinet to 10 C during days and 5 C during nights for periods {{of up to}} 120 hours. Subsequently, CO 2 exchange, transpiration, and leaf {{temperature}} were measured on attached leaves and in leaf sections at 25 or 30 C, 19 C dew point of the air, 61 milliwatts per square centimeter irradiance, and CO 2 concentrations between 0 and 1000 microliters per liter ambient <b>air.</b> <b>Net</b> photosynthesis and stomatal conductance decreased and dark respiration increased with increasing duration of prechilling. The reduction in net photosynthesis was not a consequence of decreased stomatal conductance because the intercellular CO 2 concentration in prechilled leaves was {{equal to or greater}} than that in greenhouse-grown controls. The intercellular CO 2 concentration at which one-half maximum net photosynthesis occurred remained the same in prechilled leaves and controls (175 to 190 microliters per liter). Stomata of the control plants responded to changes in the CO 2 concentration of the air only slightly. Prechilling for 24 hours or more sensitized stomata to CO 2; they responded to changes in CO 2 concentration in the range from 100 to 1000 microliters per liter...|$|E
40|$|Young {{bell pepper}} (Capsicum annuum L.) plants grown in {{nutrient}} solution were gradually acclimated to 50, 100, or 150 moles {{per cubic meter}} NaCl, and photosynthetic rates of individual attached leaves were measured on several occasions during the salinization period at external CO 2 concentrations ranging from approximately 70 to 1900 micromoles per mole <b>air.</b> <b>Net</b> CO 2 assimilation (A) was plotted against computed leaf internal CO 2 concentration (Ci), and the initial slope of this A-Ci curve {{was used as a}} measure of photosynthetic ability. During the 10 to 14 days after salinization began, leaves from plants exposed to 50 moles per cubic meter NaCl showed little change in photosynthetic ability, whereas those treated to 100 or 150 moles per cubic meter NaCl had up to 85 % inhibition, with increase in CO 2 compensation point. Leaves appeared healthy, and leaf chlorophyll content showed only a 14 % reduction at the highest salinity levels. Partial stomatal closure occurred with salinization, but reductions in photosynthesis were primarily nonstomatal in origin. Photosynthetic ability was inversely related to the concentration of either Na+ or Cl− in the leaf laminas sampled {{at the end of the}} experimental period. However, the concentration of Cl− expressed on a tissue water basis was greater, exceeding 300 moles per cubic meter, and Cl− was more closely associated (R 2 = 0. 926) with the inhibition of photosynthetic ability. Leaf turgor was not reduced by salinization and leaf osmotic potential decreased to a slightly greater extent than the osmotic potential decreases of the nutrient solutions. Concentration of accumulated Na+ and Cl− (on a tissue water basis) accounted quantitatively for maintenance of leaf osmotic balance, assuming that these ions were sequestered in the vacuoles...|$|E
40|$|The {{energy use}} in a {{workshop}} company has been examined in this work {{in order to find}} areas for energy efficiency improvement. The combined oil and electricity heating in the company were compared with other alternative heating systems including cooling of the premises in following combinations: Ground source heat pump for heating and cooling District heating and absorption cooling District heating and low temperate surface water cooling Energy use, operation costs and carbon dioxide emissions were calculated for the current heating systems and the three alternatives including cooling. The ground source heat pump for heating and cooling decreases bought energy with 34 MWh annually compared to current heating only. The district heating and low temperate surface water cooling has the largest reduction of operation cost and carbon dioxide. The operation cost decreases with 42 kSEK and the carbon dioxide with 43 metric ton CO 2 annually. The differences between the alternatives were smaller concerning the operation costs. The ground source heat pump alternative had smaller reductions of carbon dioxide than the other two alternatives with district heating. An alternative heating and cooling system can also lead to alternative energy use. The choice is between electrical or heat energy. A weighting can be done to evaluate the energy use for heating on basis of how much energy is needed in order to generate the energy the end user buys. A 2. 5 factor for electrical energy entails the alternative with district heating and low temperate surface water cooling gets the lowest heating and cooling energy in comparison. An inventory of the lighting was also done. The company has already an energy effective lighting but yet another saving of 2 MWh can be done annually without replacement of armatures. Finally, the operation time of the compressor was calculated with a mean value of 11 hours per day. The compressor delivers pressure air to machines and tools. There can be a great demand for pressure air in the workshop but the operation time can also be an indication of leakage in the <b>air</b> <b>net...</b>|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} utility of {{adaptive}} Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks for estimating hourly grass reference evapotranspiration (ET 0) from limited weather data. Nineteen days of micrometeorological and lysimeter data collected at half-hour intervals during 1962 - 63 and 1966 - 67 in the Campbell Tract research site in Davis, California were used in this study. Ten randomly chosen days (234 patterns) were selected for the RBF networks training. Two sequentially adaptive RBF networks with different number of inputs (ANNTR and ANNTHR) and two Penman-Monteith equations with different canopy resistance values (PM 42 and PM 70) were tested against hourly lysimeter data from remaining nine days (200 patterns). The ANNTR requires only two parameters (<b>air</b> temperature and <b>net</b> radiation) as inputs. <b>Air</b> temperature, humidity, <b>net</b> radiation and soil heat flux were used as inputs in the ANNTHR. PM equations use air temperature, humidity, wind speed, net radiation and soil heat flux density as inputs. The results reveal that ANNTR and PM 42 were generally the best in estimating hourly ET 0. The ANNTHR performed less well, but the results were acceptable for estimating ET 0. These results are of significant practical use because the RBF network with <b>air</b> temperature and <b>net</b> radiation as inputs {{could be used to}} estimate hourly ET 0 at Davis, California...|$|R
