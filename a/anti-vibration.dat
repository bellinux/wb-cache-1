25|$|A pair of roof-mounted Turbomeca Turmo {{turboshaft}} engines {{power the}} Puma's four-blade main rotor. The helicopter's rotors are driven {{at a speed}} of roughly 265 rpm via a five reduction stage transmission. The design of the transmission featured several unique and uncommon innovations for the time, such as single-part manufacturing of the rotor shaft and the <b>anti-vibration</b> measures integrated into the main gearbox and main rotor blades. The Puma also featured an automatic blade inspection system, which guarded against and alerted crews to fatigue cracking in the rotor blades. There are two hydraulic systems on board, these operate entirely independent of one another, one system powers only the aircraft's flight controls while the other serves the autopilot, undercarriage, rotor brake, and the flight controls.|$|E

The same year, assembly of the Vedette started at Simca do Brasil. Also during 1959, a new top-of-the-line model joined the Vedette range, the Présidence, featuring a luxurious interior, a radiotelephone (a European first) and a continental kit. French coachbuilder Chapron built two 2-door Présidence convertibles for a governor {{of one of the}} French colonies. Chapron had another order the next year, to build two four-door convertibles for the French President Charles de Gaulle. The Beaulieu was dropped in autumn 1960, but the other models remained unchanged until the 1961 model year, when they received new seats, new chrome decor, and the engine was fitted with a new <b>anti-vibration</b> crankshaft.|$|E

40|$|In {{metal cutting}} {{operations}} tool vibration {{is a frequent}} problem. Vibrations appear under the excitation applied by the material deformation process during the machining of a workpiece. In order to perform an internal turning or boring operation, e. g. in a pre-drilled hole in a workpiece, it is generally required that the boring bar should be long and slender; therefore it is easily subjected to vibrations. These vibrations will affect the result of machining, in particular the surface finish, and also the tool life may be reduced. As a result of tool vibration severe acoustic noise frequently occurs in the working environment. The vibration problem is {{to a large extent}} related to the boring bar low-order fundamental bending modes. In order to control boring bar vibrations in the primary cutting direction an analog and a digital feedback controllers have been used. In both approaches an active boring bar with a built-in actuator has been used. In order to measure the response of the active boring bar, accelerometers are mounted nearby the area, where the excitation force is applied due to material deformation process. This means that in either approach the boring bar vibrations are attenuated actively by the controlled secondary <b>anti-vibrations</b> induced by the actuator. The digital controller, based on the feedback filtered-x LMS-algorithm, manages to reduce the boring bar vibrations in the primary cutting direction by up to approximately 44 dB at the first bending resonance frequency. The analog controller, based on a flexible orthogonal gain and phase lag compensation, results in an attenuation of the boring bar vibrations in the primary cutting direction by up to approximately 40 dB at the first bending resonance frequency. Both controllers also suppress all the harmonics of the first bending resonance frequency. Vibration attenuation performances of the two controllers are compared and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Adaptive {{filters are}} {{normally}} defined for {{problems such as}} electrical noise cancelling where the filter output is an estimate of a desired signal. In control applications, however, the adaptive filter works as a controller controling a dynamic system containing actuators and amplifiers etc. The estimate (<b>anti-vibrations</b> or anti-sound) in this case can thus {{be seen as the}} output signal from a dynamic system, i. e. a forward path. Since there is a dynamic system between the filter output and the estimate, the selection of adaptive filter algorithms must be made with care. A conventional adaptive algorithm such as the LMS algorithm is likely to be unstable in this application due to the phase shift (delay) introduced by the forward path [1, 2]. The well-known filtered-x LMS-algorithm is, however, an adaptive filter algorithm which is suitable for active control applications [3]. It is developed from the LMS algorithm, where a model of the dynamic system between the filter output and the estimate, i. e. the forward path is introduced between the input signal and the algorithm for the adaptation of the coefficient vector [3, 4]. Figure 1 shows an active control system with a controller based on the filtered-x LMS algorithm. The Figure 1 : Active control system. FIR filter output is as usual given by the vector inner product: where y(n) = w T (n) x(n) (1) x(n) = [x(n), x(n − 1), [...] ., x(n − M + 1) ] T is the input signal vector to the adaptive filter and w(n) = [w 0 (n), w 1 (n), [...] ., wM− 1 (n) ] T is the adjustable filter coefficient vector. In control applications, the estimation error e(n) is defined by the difference between the desired signal (desired response) d(n) and the output signal from the forward path or plant under control yC(n) : e(n) = d(n) − yC(n) (4) Assuming that the transfer function for the forward path can be described with an Ithorder FIR filter: cn when n ∈ { 0, [...] ., I − 1 } hC(n) ...|$|R
