5|$|Initially <b>a</b> <b>ham</b> radio enthusiast and {{subsequently}} {{a graduate of}} the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) with both bachelor's and master's degrees in physics, Robinson worked at the Georgia Tech Research Institute and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory before founding Scientific Atlanta. Later in life, he founded and invested in numerous Atlanta-based science-related companies. Robinson was named an IEEE Fellow and held at least 39patents in fields including solar energy devices and antenna systems.|$|E

The company's 1992 offering, a Meatloaf Specialty Sandwich, was introduced {{as part of}} a push into limited table service. Other LTO variants in its Specialty Sandwich line included an Italian sausage sandwich served in one of three ways: with onions and peppers; parmigiana-style with mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce; or with all four ingredients. Steak sandwiches were made from steak fillets or later, restructured beef. Other offerings were <b>a</b> <b>ham</b> and cheese sandwich with mayonnaise, lettuce, and tomato, and a veal parmigiana sandwich.|$|E

5|$|Robinson {{returned}} from the conflict as a junior and in 1948 he changed his major to physics, as the School of Physics started its degree program that year. He received a Bachelor of Science in Physics in 1948, and a Master of Science in Physics (also from Georgia Tech) in 1950. Robinson was {{also a member of}} Georgia Tech's prestigious secret society, ANAK. Robinson had been <b>a</b> <b>ham</b> radio operator enthusiast since the age of 14, and started a radio repair service to provide additional income while he was a student at Georgia Tech.|$|E
5|$|During {{a grocery}} {{shopping}} trip, Lois realizes she is short on {{money to pay}} for food. She pretends to return <b>a</b> <b>ham</b> to the meat department but decides to hide it in her purse instead. Hooked on the thrill of shoplifting, she begins stealing other items, quickly becoming addicted to theft. She begins to indulge in large shoplifting sprees, including stealing a Matisse painting, which arouses the suspicion of Brian. While attempting to steal from an auto parts store, Lois is caught by Brian, who tells her she is doing wrong and that her stealing is not going to solve problems. Lois accepts his reasoning, but as she loads up the car to return her stolen goods, she is caught by Joe and arrested.|$|E

25|$|In Canada Call signs {{start with}} VA, VE, VY, VO, and CY. Call signs {{starting}} with 'V' {{end with a}} number after to indicate the political region; prefix CY indicates geographic islands. Prefix VA1 or VE1 is Nova Scotia, VA2 / VE2 is Quebec, VA3 / VE3 is Ontario, VA4 / VE4 is Manitoba, VA5 / VE5 is Saskatchewan, VA6 / VE6 is Alberta, VA7 / VE7 is British Columbia, VE8 is the Northwest Territories, VE9 is New Brunswick, VY0 is Nunavut, VY1 is the Yukon Territory, VY2 is Prince Edward Island, VO1 is Newfoundland, and VO2 is Labrador. CY is for amateurs operating from Sable and/or St. Paul’s Island, both of which require coast guard permission to get to. CY0 is Sable Island and CY9 is St. Paul’s Island. The {{last two or three}} letters of the callsigns are typically the operator's choice (upon completing the licensing test, the ham writes three most-preferred options). Two letter callsign suffixes require <b>a</b> <b>ham</b> to have already been licensed for 5years. Callsigns in Canada can be requested with a fee.|$|E

[...] The ham was hung over the city gate, from where the winner was expected to climb up and remove it himself. [...] One such winner had the prize revoked after winning it, after he inadvertently let slip that his wife would rebuke him for staining his coat while bringing down the ham.|$|E

The storm's heavy rain and constant thunder may have overpowered {{the noise of the}} volcano, and with no systematic warning efforts, the residents of Armero were completely unaware of the continuing activity at Ruiz. At 9:45pm, after the volcano had erupted, Civil Defense officials from Ibagué and Murillo tried to warn Armero's officials, but could not make contact. Later they overheard conversations between individual officials of Armero and others; famously, a few heard the Mayor of Armero speaking on <b>a</b> <b>ham</b> radio, saying [...] "that he did not think there was much danger", when he was overtaken by the lahar.|$|E

500|$|The {{introduction}} of the Specialty Sandwich [...] line {{was one of the}} first attempts by a major fast food chain to target a specific demographic, in this case adults aged between 18 and 34 years, members of which were presumably willing to spend more on a higher quality product. Included in the new line was the Original Chicken Sandwich, <b>a</b> <b>ham</b> and cheese sandwich, a roast beef sandwich, a new fish sandwich called the Long Fish Sandwich, and a new burger called the Sirloin Steak Sandwich. The ham and cheese sandwich replaced an earlier version ham and cheese sandwich called the Yumbo that was served hot and was the size of a hamburger. In 1981 the chain tested a veal parmigiana sandwich in limited areas of the United States and took it national in 1982. It was also sold in New England as part of limited time offering (LTO) in 1988.|$|E
500|$|For {{the first}} time ever on The Office, Pam Beesly's (Jenna Fischer) hair is in a {{different}} style. Several hairstyles were shown to Greg Daniels before the one used in the episode was selected. Dwight's line about <b>a</b> <b>ham</b> being a romantic gift was written during filming on the set. The writers did not have a punchline in the scene, so they came up with several alternatives, including ham, as well as [...] "a boombox". Most of the street scenes in New York City were improvised. They had to be kept short because crowds quickly formed around Steve Carell when he was recognized. Conan O'Brien appeared in a cameo in the episode. He previously worked with Daniels on the writing staffs for Not Necessarily the News, Saturday Night Live and The Simpsons and the two also went to Harvard University together. Coincidentally, years before The Office, actors Mindy Kaling, Angela Kinsey and John Krasinski all interned for O'Brien during Late Night with Conan O'Brien.|$|E
