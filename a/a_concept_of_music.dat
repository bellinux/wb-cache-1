40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to explore how people in {{contemporary}} society may apply music in their everyday life to improve their health and well-being. Through a series of qualitative interviews, informants gave their narratives about how music had become a part of their health practice. Six narratives concerning this type of everyday musical self-care are presented, and the following questions are sought to be answered: What kinds of musical practices do people apply in order to regulate their health and promote their sense of well-being? What kind of generative health mechanism can we observe or theorize when people use music to enhance their well-being? What kinds of rituals, contextual circumstances and personal health beliefs are operating in these situations? The findings suggests that some people may sing, participate in a choir, dance to music, compose songs, play precomposed music, or play in a band as part of a reflexive strategy to improve their health and well-being.

40|$|Alphons Diepenbrock's {{incidental}} music: Concept, composition, performance The incidental <b>music</b> <b>of</b> Alphons Diepenbrock (1862 - 1921) {{occupies a}} peculiar {{position in the}} history <b>of</b> early-twentieth-century Dutch <b>music.</b> For the emergence <b>of</b> Diepenbrock's incidental <b>music,</b> his collaboration with the stage director Willem Royaards was particularly important. The influence of Balthazar Verhagen, a former pupil of Diepenbrock, was decisive too. Apart from the 1910 comedy Marsyas of de Betooverde Bron (Marsyas or the Enchanted Well), written by Balthazar Verhagen, Diepenbrock wrote his incidental music to canonical texts such as by Vondel (Gysbrecht van Aemstel, 1912), Aristophanes (De Vogels [The Birds], 1918), Goethe (Faust, 1918) and Sophocles (Electra, 1920). The unique character <b>of</b> Diepenbrock's incidental <b>music</b> stems from his strong literary inclination - he received a doctorate in Latin and Greek in 1888. As a composer, Diepenbrock was mainly self-taught. For investigating Diepenbrock's incidental music, I have pursued three research angles. Firstly, I have discussed the opinions of Diepenbrock and his main collaborators - Royaards and Verhagen - on the intricacies of drama and theatre music (Part II). Secondly, I have focussed on the history and the analysis of Diepenbrock's five stage works (Part III). Finally, I have examined the works' performance practice and reception up to the Second World War (Part IV). In an elaborate introduction, I have adressed Diepenbrock's incidental music in an international context (Part I). Diepenbrock's aim was to implement <b>a</b> new <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> theatre. His preference for the combination of spoken voice with music ('melodrama') over singing exemplifies this intention. In his essays from the 1890 s, Diepenbrock already condemned the 'old-fashioned' opera and the traditional ballet. Searching for <b>a</b> new <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> theatre that would restore the classical unity of word, gesture and music, he regarded Greek tragedy as a model. Apart from Diepenbrock's essays, publications by Balthazar Verhagen, written after Diepenbrock's death in 1921, have been a valuable source for research into Diepenbrock's incidental music. Although Diepenbrock's five stage compositions each have their own character, melodrama {{plays an important role}} in all of them. However, Diepenbrock did not give any rhythmical indication for the melodramatic parts in his scores. Therefore, it is difficult, if not impossible, to determine the concordance between the spoken words and the music, which was as problematic for Diepenbrock's contemporaries as it is for us now. Thus, one of the main research questions in the present study concerns the melodrama. The role of instrumentation is another interesting point in case for studying the dramatic quality <b>of</b> Diepenbrock's incidental <b>music.</b> In his incidental <b>music,</b> the role <b>of</b> the orchestra surpasses mere accompaniment. Particularly interesting are the various recurring musical themes and motives, often with distinctive timbres, that are linked up with certain roles or with abstract issues such as 'fate' and 'the superhuman'. Diepenbrock's <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new kind <b>of</b> <b>music</b> theatre turned out to be an illusion, and his implementation of it was largely unsuccessful. His intentions were abstract and elitist to such an extent that satisfactory performances could not be realised during his life time. The collaboration with Willem Royaards was problematic. In fact, they both underestimated each other's profession. Reviews and historical recordings also confirm that Diepenbrock's demands were far from realistic...|$|R

40|$|In {{his lecture}} “The <b>Music</b> <b>of</b> Poetry” (1942), T. S. Eliot said, “I {{think that a}} poet may gain much from the study <b>of</b> <b>music.</b> ” Indeed, much of his poetry shows his debt to music, for {{instance}} in the musical titles of his early poems, jazz rhythms in the Waste Land, and the instrumental reference in the Four Quartets. This paper reviews Eliot’s preoccupation with Romanticism through an invocation of Romantic musical genres. T. S. Eliot wrote his early poems {{during a time when}} other poets like Ezra Pound vigorously denounced the Romantic project and its Victorian inheritors. Around the same time, representative composers like Claude Debussy and Igor Stravinsky experimented with the idea of tonality and the ways it could be subverted. Listeners that had been accustomed to the idea <b>of</b> tonal <b>music</b> with a main pulse or meter that would carry throughout were thrown off by the measure-to-measure switches in time signatures, music that had no tonal center, and a seemingly lack of form; something that was easily comparable to the fragmentation prevalent in Eliot’s work of the same period. This paper illustrates through close readings how the poems “Nocturne,” “Preludes,” “Rhapsody on a Windy Night,” and “Portrait of a Lady” demonstrate this parallel shift from the Romantic tradition into <b>a</b> new <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>music</b> and literature: post-tonality in the former, and modernism in the latter. Eliot uses Romantic musical forms in the first three as the framework for themes of isolation, fragmentation, and disillusionment, and within his exposure of Romantic cliché in “Portrait of a Lady” one can see his desire to move towards something new...|$|R

A comprehensive terminology is introduced, along with five fixed-media electroacoustic compositions, which exemplify {{a manifestation of}} spatial texture in composition and musical thinking. The theory draws from research on the cross-modality of texture perception, philosophical discourse on embodied meaning, physics, psychology of visual art, and discourse on space in acousmatic music. Several different structural perspectives are discussed, which reveal how spatial texture incorporates lower sound-structural levels, materiality, states and processes, motion, global networks and terrains, and relationships between space and time. Emphasis is put on visual and physical connections with spatiality in the acousmatic experience: cogency in spatial structure and dynamics reinforces links among modalities. The concepts and terminology are intended as a contribution to theory in the acousmatic medium, relevant to composition, analysis, and listening. The music represents an aesthetic orientation which emphasises materiality and morphology in texture, transformative processes, spatial design, and spatiotemporal polyvalence.

40|$|Jazz historians {{explain the}} coming of bebop—the radically new jazz style that {{established}} itself {{toward the end of}} World War II—as a revolutionary phenomenon. The motives ascribed to the young pioneers in the style range from dissatisfaction with the restrictions on freedom of expression imposed by the then dominant big-band swing style to the deliberate invention of a subtle and mystifying manner of playing that could not be copied by uninitiated musicians. It has even been suggested that bebop was invented by black musicians to prevent whites from stealing their music, as had been the case with earlier jazz styles. Yet when Dizzy Gillespie, one of the two chief architects of the new style, was asked some thirty years after the fact if he had been a conscious revolutionary when bebop began, his answer was Not necessarily revolutionary, but evolutionary.

40|$|Edward Said was {{the quintessential}} {{intellectual}} {{of the last}} quarter of the twentieth century. Commonly celebrated as the founding figure of postcolonialism, his critical oeuvre spans varied terrain. The very strength of his critique lies in these diverse tributaries of thought. Crossing borders and boundaries incessantly, Said’s intellectual project celebrates the culture of resistance while opposing doctrinaire rhetoric. The paper tries to journey along the multifarious “margins” of discourses that crop up in Said. “In-between” spaces have to be investigated for their radical potential, while daring to “transgress” has its own dangers. Said unmasks the unholy nexus between knowledge and power in the mapping of the “Orient” that abetted the colonial enterprise. His contrapuntal readings of literary texts reveal the ubiquitous presence of imperial empire. Consequently, voices from the margins spur counter narratives and “writing back” in the postcolonial condition. Intellectuals in exile tend to be “marginal” and this location helps in looking at the two or even three sides of an issue. Questions of identity, selfhood, nationality, politics, memory, history, representation, geography, homeland, anxieties of influence are dealt with in the paper. The intertwining of the personal and the political occurs in Said. “Memory” is the only hope for resuscitating a “lost world” and battling the accompanying sense of “loss” and “despair” infused in both individuals and communities alike. The paper tries to address how “border crossing” and the “coalescing of margins” create an interdisciplinary breadth in Said, which resist categorization. The “centre/margin” binary is problematized by acknowledging the presence of “many voices,” “polyphony” being <b>a</b> favourite <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> Said. <b>Music</b> gave to him metaphors for human emancipation, while “transgression” was vital. His acknowledgement and assimilation of fellow critics is also mentioned. Beyond enunciating insider-outsider distinctions, Said tried to cultivate knowledge as a bridge between different interests and locations...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{provides}} a thorough reading of Gilles Deleuze’s (1925 – 95) philosophy {{of nature and}} the way music relates to this philosophy. It does so with regards to changes in the view of nature in 20 th century science, especially in the theories of self-organisation as developed by, among others, Ilya Prigogine. Deleuze’s metaphysics is viewed in relation to these theories, and is also compared to the philosophy of Immanuel Kant, which is related to classical science. The essay then investigates certain key issues in Deleuze’s philosophy concerning difference and univocity (or immanence), developed in his doctoral thesis Différence et répétition (1968). Also, certain aspects of the further evolution of this philosophy of immanence in Mille plateaux (1980), co-written with Félix Guattari, are examined. The essay then studies the role of aesthetics in Deleuze’s philosophy, and the way he transforms the aesthetics of Kant. The following chapter deals with Deleuze & Guattari’s primary text concerning music, ”De la ritournelle” in Mille plateaux. In this text, they develop <b>a</b> highly abstract <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>music,</b> which, in their philosophy, is: 1) granted a cosmological reach regarding rhythms and motives; 2) made an essential aspect of the emergence of art, which they find in animals creating a territory (especially in the songbird); 3) used to discuss Baroque/Classicist, Romantic and 20 th century musical styles. Apart from analysing these aspects, this chapter focuses on 20 th century music, with a thorough examination of Gustav Mahler and <b>of</b> spectral <b>music,</b> demonstrating that Deleuze’s philosophy can deepen the understanding <b>of</b> this <b>music.</b> The chapter also discusses problematic tendencies in Deleuzian research on contemporary music, which does not take the entirety of Deleuze’s philosophy of nature into account. This essay argues that such knowledge is necessary to correctly examine the implications of Deleuze & Guattari’s philosophy <b>of</b> <b>music.</b> The lack <b>of</b> awareness of Deleuze’s philosophy of nature is also significant in the critique that Deleuze’s aesthetics has received by Jacques Rancière, which is analysed in the final chapter. This chapter also discusses Michael Gallope’s reading of Deleuze & Guattari, in which he makes a distinction between a metaphysical and an ethical-aesthetic philosophy <b>of</b> <b>music.</b> Although the relation between metaphysics, ethics, and aesthetics, is key to understanding their philosophy <b>of</b> <b>music,</b> this essay argues that Gallope’s idea of what sort <b>of</b> <b>music</b> they advocate is incorrect...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I will {{introduce}} <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> pedagogy <b>of</b> <b>music</b> that I will call Immanent. I will approach it philosophically from two directions: Firstly, I {{will focus on}} the notion <b>of</b> <b>Music,</b> (or the ontology <b>of</b> <b>music),</b> and claim that within this notion there is always already a pedagogy enclosed, not to say immanent. I do for example – with Nettl - believe that the way in which a society teaches its music is a matter of enormous importance for understanding that music. Nevertheless, and quite contrary to that, in my ongoing PhD project I find that the activity of learning “music” in school (materialized in the textbooks of my study) is seen as something external to what music really is. These are textbooks with a fairly great amount <b>of</b> non-western classical <b>music</b> represented, but the teaching design is very much the same as with the western-classical music. This indicates to me that music is seen very much like objective knowledge, to be transferred with a tool (external to music), and this tool is (the Western) pedagogy. There are numerous examples on this in different kinds of books and writings. For example, it is possible to speak rather easily about “music pedagogy and its object” (music), hence separating the learning from the music, and hence defining music in contradiction to Nettl: as something existing autonomously, thinkable without any aspect of teaching and learning. Even if adopting a language of musicing or musicking, most people seem to keep a music-as-object ontology, and seeing musicking as a transitive verb, taking “music” as its object. Secondly, I will focus on (music) pedagogy. Several recent music philosophers and writers have commented on the fallibility of the traditional (Western Classical) pedagogy when it comes to other musics. While Lucy Green focuses on informal music education and have done thoroughly research on the use of informal teaching strategies and concludes that they are of most importance when teaching and learning pop-music, Peter Dunbar-Hall draws on his long time experience performing and teaching Balinese Gamelan-music and suggest the term ethnopedagogics to better reflect that different kinds <b>of</b> <b>music</b> are differently thought and learned. Both two perspectives – and numerous others - although recognising the close relationship between the music and its pedagogy, do (at least analytically) separate the music from its teaching/learning methods. My suggestion is not to make different pedagogies for different musics, but to expand the notion <b>of</b> <b>music</b> to also include the teaching and learning processes, and to focus on where “music” is: In the human beings as human doings...|$|R
40|$|The {{exploration}} <b>of</b> <b>music,</b> {{architecture and}} their relationship to one another is primarily based on the fundamental components of each discipline, that make the composition of both. The components of these disciplines are closely related and somewhat interchangeable. But all are needed to make a whole relating to itself and to one another. The vehicle for the exploration of these ideas will be an Arts Center. The goal will be to take an innovative approach to access the relationship <b>of</b> architecture and <b>music,</b> by being sympathetic to the site, the environment, and culture, trying to create new forms of expression. The stress will be on defining the relationship between architecture and music. This will result in a new approach to design working with a creative language built from the exploration of the fundamentals that make up architecture and music, both graphically and verbally. Spaces to help achieve this will be along the lines of performance, teaching and study. The design should be functional, yet maximize potential richness for education and creativity with a cross fertilization of both disciplines. A tool to help achieve this goal will be a musical composition. This will be used to make the interpretation from music to architecture experiencing their relationship and having a piece of architecture evolve from the musical composition. The creative language, which was developed through research of the components <b>of</b> <b>music</b> and architecture, evolved to a graphic language defining these elements. They were broken down into categories of rhythm, sequence, order, hierarchy, form, proportion, and scale, which are components <b>of</b> <b>music</b> and architecture. They were then compared to one another and combined {{to come up with a}} graphic design language which would be used as building blocks and a basic understanding of both disciplines to make a design from <b>a</b> <b>concept</b> piece <b>of</b> <b>music.</b> They were further defined by taking these divisions into space and object form by a means of modeling. After creating a meaningful definition to these topics, a piece <b>of</b> <b>music</b> was choosen and analysized to be used to create a Music Arts Center, utilizing this design approach. After the analysis <b>of</b> the <b>music,</b> a building was designed by using these building blocks as a foundation to work from. Through the use of these components, meaning was developed and derived from every component defined as it related to the music. These were applied to the main structure of the building, the layout, circulation, elevations, form of the building, arrangement of the spaces, selection of the materials and the site design. Every aspect of the building relates to the concept music through the use of the graphic language developed from earlier research. The final product is intended to give the user the feeling that it was designed with thought and meaning from the music. One should feel the elements <b>of</b> the <b>music</b> coming through as the user progresses through the building and perceives it. The user should feel it was designed through the use of the graphic language and music piece. Like a musical composition being created around an idea, then developed through orchestration, and performed by the orchestra. The architecture designed for this thesis should be developed in the same manner. There should be conception of an idea, designed through architectural details, and then the performance which is the construction and perception of the building. The perception of the building could also be the test of whether this approach was successful or not. This was the approach used to arrive at the final product of this thesis.
