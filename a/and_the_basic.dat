Jo means beginning, ha means breaking, and kyū means rapid or urgent. The term originated in gagaku, ancient courtly music, to indicate gradually increasing tempo and was adopted in various Japanese traditions including Noh, tea ceremony, poetry, and flower arrangement.|$|E

5|$|After the film's mainly {{negative}} reviews Akshay Kumar {{lashed out}} at critics, accusing them of lacking {{an understanding of the}} audience <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> ideas of filmmaking. There were rumours about a feud between Kumar and Ekta Kapoor about the former's distancing himself from the project and not promoting it enough. The three leads attended the inaugural 2013 Indian Premier League match between Kolkata Knight Riders and Delhi Daredevils to promote the film, but the match organisers asked their cameramen not to focus on the actors. After this, a disappointed Kumar asked Kapoor to re-arrange the film's marketing schedule.|$|E
5|$|Characters {{such as the}} long, narrow kidney with reflexed ureter {{and closed}} {{secondary}} ureter, the penial complex with distinct penis, which is continuous with the epiphallus, epiphallic caecum (a flagellum and an appendix), unbranched gametolytic duct, lack of vaginal accessory organs, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> condition of the nervous and retractor muscle systems support the inclusion of Amphidromus in the family Camaenidae. This group of snails occur {{in a wide variety}} of habitats in the tropics of Eastern Asia and Australasia, and is one of the most diverse families in the clade Stylommatophora. Though Laidlaw & Solem (1961) provided no more additional details on the anatomy of Amphidromus, subsequent studies by distinct authors, e.g., Bishop (1977) and Solem (1983), have demonstrated that the reproductive system can provide valuable data for species recognition.|$|E

5|$|Emigration {{of young}} people {{continued}} apace with 400,000 Scots, ten per cent of the population, estimated to have left the country between 1921 and 1931. The economic stagnation was only one factor; other push factors included a zest for travel and adventure, and the pull factors of better job opportunities abroad, personal networks to link into, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> cultural similarity of the United States, Canada, and Australia. Government subsidies for travel and relocation facilitated the decision to emigrate. Personal networks {{of family and friends}} who had gone ahead and wrote back, or sent money, prompted emigrants to follow.|$|E
5|$|For much of {{its early}} life, the school {{consisted}} only of Nathan Smith and a small class of students, operating in borrowed space at Dartmouth College. Students of Smith were educated as apprentices, and received a Bachelor of Medicine degree upon graduation. Like Dartmouth College as a whole, the medical school had continual funding shortages. As time passed, however, the popularity of both the medical instruction <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> sciences taught at the school drew undergraduates and training physicians alike. Soliciting funds {{from the state of}} New Hampshire, Smith was able to obtain medical equipment and, by 1811, a dedicated physical plant for the school.|$|E
5|$|Smyth was {{commissioned}} {{to write the}} report by Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., {{the director of the}} Manhattan Project. The Smyth Report was the first official account of the development of the atomic bombs <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> physical processes behind them. It also served as an indication as to what information was declassified; anything in the Smyth Report could be discussed openly. For this reason, the Smyth Report focused heavily on information, such as basic nuclear physics, which was either already widely known in the scientific community or easily deducible by a competent scientist, and omitted details about chemistry, metallurgy, and ordnance. This would ultimately give a false impression that the Manhattan Project was all about physics.|$|E

5|$|The Report was {{to serve}} two functions. First, {{it was to}} be the public and {{official}} U.S. government account of the development of the atomic bombs, outlining the development of the then-secret laboratories and production sites at Los Alamos, New Mexico, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Hanford, Washington, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> physical processes responsible for the functioning of nuclear weapons, in particular nuclear fission and the nuclear chain reaction. Second, it served as a reference for other scientists as to what information was declassified—anything said in the Smyth Report could be said freely in open literature. For this reason, the Smyth Report focused heavily on information already available in declassified literature, such as much of the basic nuclear physics used in weapons, which was either already widely known in the scientific community or could have been easily deduced by a competent scientist.|$|E
5|$|The United States Academic Decathlon {{publishes a}} variety of study {{materials}} for the objective events, the profits from which support the program. The Resource Guides <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>Basic</b> Guides constitute {{the majority of the}} USAD corpus. An art reproduction booklet and music CD contain a particular year's relevant pieces and are issued separately from the Resource Guides. Study guides are also published and contain detailed topical outlines for each objective subject. These outlines specifically indicate which topics will require independent research beyond the material included in the Resource Guides. USAD also offered Research Guides until 2010, which outlined the basics of what students ought to research. However, in the 2010–2011 competition season, USAD announced that it would be eliminating independent research-based questions from the competitions.|$|E
5|$|When {{developing}} {{plans for}} Blood-C, {{it was decided}} to shift its setting based on positive feedback from the change of setting between Blood: The Last Vampire and the franchise's first anime series Blood+. The only elements to be retained were the first name of the main character, having a katana as her weapon, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> premise of her defeating monsters with that sword. The wish for the project to be distinct from earlier entries was what spurred the collaboration with CLAMP, which became {{a large part of the}} anime's marketing campaign. Fujisaku, when asked in an interview to describe his one creative ambition for the series, said that it was to fully expand and build upon the basic concept established in Blood: The Last Vampire. The choice of a school setting, the first of its kind to be featured in the Blood franchise, was chosen because Mizushima wanted to portray a school life for Saya. When asked, Mizushima did not find the change from his previous comedy anime-based turnout a barrier to his work, but did feel pressure when handling a project within the Blood franchise.|$|E

5|$|Many former Austro-Hungarian naval {{personnel}} {{were incorporated into}} the new navy, 90 per cent of whom were of Croatian or Slovene ethnicity. The remainder were Serbs, or non-Slavs such as Germans. Their former ranks were recognised and, initially at least, rank insignia and regulations were adopted from the former Austro-Hungarian Navy. By 1922, the KJRM consisted of 124 officers and about 3,000 men. The number of officers had more than halved {{since the end of}} 1919, largely due to disillusionment. To fill the looming shortfall, around 20 graduates from each of the 1921 and 1922 classes of the Yugoslav Military Academy in Belgrade were sent to the KJRM. In 1923, the new Naval Academy at Gruž accepted its first class of 40 midshipmen, who were to undergo a three-year training course. All entrants to the Naval Academy had to be between 17 and 20 years of age, and graduates of high school or similar nautical school. Two specialist schools for petty officers were established, one at Šibenik for deck crew, and a machinist's school at Kumbor in the Bay of Kotor. Mine and torpedo training was conducted at Đenovići, as was pilot and air observer training. A gunnery school was established at Meljine in the Bay of Kotor. Šibenik was also the home of the main coastal radio station, the signals school <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>basic</b> and specialist training school for seamen.|$|E
