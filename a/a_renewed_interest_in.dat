5|$|The {{last half}} of the 19th century saw a {{tremendous}} expansion in paleontological activity, especially in North America. The trend continued in the 20th century with additional regions of the Earth being opened to systematic fossil collection, as demonstrated by a series of important discoveries in China {{near the end of the}} 20th century. Many transitional fossils have been discovered, and there is now considered to be abundant evidence of how all classes of vertebrates are related, much of it in the form of transitional fossils. The last few decades of the 20th century saw <b>a</b> <b>renewed</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> mass extinctions and their role in the evolution of life on Earth. There was also <b>a</b> <b>renewed</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the Cambrian explosion that saw the development of the body plans of most animal phyla. The discovery of fossils of the Ediacaran biota and developments in paleobiology extended knowledge about the history of life back far before the Cambrian.|$|E

Out of this movement came garage rock bands like the White Stripes, the Strokes, Interpol and, later on, the Black Keys.

5|$|Although {{gunpowder}} {{was introduced}} to Europe in the 14thcentury, it did not significantly affect castle building until the 15thcentury, when artillery became powerful enough to break through stone walls. While castles continued to be built well into the 16thcentury, new techniques to deal with improved cannon fire made them uncomfortable and undesirable places to live. As a result, true castles went into decline and were replaced by artillery forts with no role in civil administration, and country houses that were indefensible. From the 18thcentury onwards, there was <b>a</b> <b>renewed</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> castles {{with the construction of}} mock castles, part of a romantic revival of Gothic architecture, but they had no military purpose.|$|E
5|$|Hilda Campbell Vaughan (married name Morgan; 12 June 1892 – 4 November 1985) was a Welsh {{novelist and}} short story writer writing in English. Her ten varied novels, set mostly {{in her native}} Radnorshire, concern rural {{communities}} and heroines. Her first was The Battle to the Weak (1925) and her last The Candle and the Light, published in 1954. She was married to the writer Charles Langbridge Morgan, who had an influence on her writings. Although favourably received by her contemporaries, Vaughan subsequently received minimal critical attention.

5|$|In 1964–65 <b>a</b> <b>renewed</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> Shanina {{arose in}} the Soviet press, {{largely due to the}} {{publication}} of her diary. The newspaper Severny Komsomolets asked Shanina's contemporaries to write what they knew about her. Streets in Arkhangelsk, Shangaly and Stroyevskoye were named after her, and the village of Yedma has a museum dedicated to Shanina. The local school where she studied in 1931–35 has a commemorative plate. In Arkhangelsk, regular shooting competitions were organized among members of the paramilitary DOSAAF sport organisation for the Roza Shanina Prize, while Novodvinsk organized an open shooting sports championship in her memory. The village of Malinovka in Ustyansky District started to hold annual cross-country ski races for the Roza Shanina Prize.|$|E

However, while genomic data are revealing the extent of genetic heterogeneity within single tumors (7), the influ-ence of ITH upon the neoantigen landscape and sensitivity to immune modulation is unclear. To explore neoantigen heterogeneity and its influence on anti-tumor immunity in early-stage NSCLC, we applied a bioinformatics pipeline to seven primary NSCLCs subjected to multi-region sequence analysis (table S 1) (8, 9).

5|$|Tom Johnson (born Tom Jackling; c.1750– 21 January 1797) was a bare-knuckle fighter who was {{referred}} to as the Champion of England between 1784 and 1791. His involvement in pugilistic prizefighting is generally seen to have coincided with <b>a</b> <b>renewed</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> the sport. Although a strong man, his success was largely attributed to his technical abilities and his calm, analytical approach to despatching his opponents. But Johnson was less prudent outside the ring; he was a gambler and considered by many of his acquaintances to be an easy mark. He is thought to have earned more money from the sport than any other fighter until nearly a century later, but much of it was squandered.|$|E
5|$|As {{his sons}} had desired and planned, Wilberforce {{has long been}} viewed as a Christian hero, a statesman-saint held up {{as a role model}} for putting his faith into action. More broadly, he has also been {{described}} as a humanitarian reformer who contributed significantly to reshaping the political and social attitudes of the time by promoting concepts of social responsibility and action. In the 1940s, the role of Wilberforce and the Clapham Sect in abolition was downplayed by historian Eric Williams, who argued that abolition was motivated not by humanitarianism but by economics, as the West Indian sugar industry was in decline. Williams' approach strongly influenced historians for much of {{the latter part of the}} 20th century. However, more recent historians have noted that the sugar industry was still making large profits at the time of abolition, and this has led to <b>a</b> <b>renewed</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> Wilberforce and the Evangelicals, as well as a recognition of the anti-slavery movement as a prototype for subsequent humanitarian campaigns.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, Bosch's work enjoyed a popular resurrection. The early surrealists' fascination with dreamscapes, the {{autonomy}} of the imagination, and a free-flowing connection to the unconscious brought about <b>a</b> <b>renewed</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> his work. Bosch's imagery struck a chord with Joan Miró and Salvador Dalí in particular. Both knew his paintings firsthand, having seen The Garden of Earthly Delights in the Museo del Prado, and both regarded him as an art-historical mentor. Miró's The Tilled Field contains several parallels to Bosch's Garden: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work. Dalí's 1929 The Great Masturbator is similar to an image {{on the right side of}} the left panel of Bosch's Garden, composed of rocks, bushes and little animals resembling a face with a prominent nose and long eyelashes.|$|E

Results: There were some conflicting results, in some studies it was suggested that TLR 2 and TLR 4 activation induces Treg and Th 17 responses, while other studies showed that they induce pro-allergic cytokines. Conclusions: TLR 2 and TLR 4 {{are most likely to be}} involved in mediating the protective effect of farm dust exposure. However, the molecular mechanism is still controversial. ...|$|R
5|$|Organ {{music was}} seldom {{written in the}} Classical era, as composers {{preferred}} the piano with its ability to create dynamics. In Germany, the six sonatas op. 65 of Felix Mendelssohn (published 1845) {{marked the beginning of}} <b>a</b> <b>renewed</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> composing for the organ. Inspired by the newly built Cavaillé-Coll organs, the French organist-composers César Franck, Alexandre Guilmant and Charles-Marie Widor led organ music into the symphonic realm. The development of symphonic organ music continued with Louis Vierne and Charles Tournemire. Widor and Vierne wrote large-scale, multi-movement works called organ symphonies that exploited the full possibilities of the symphonic organ. Max Reger and Sigfrid Karg-Elert's symphonic works made use of the abilities of the large Romantic organs being built in Germany at the time.|$|E
