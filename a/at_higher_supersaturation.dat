The macroscopic structure and the average elemental composition of the uric acid stones have been well established [1 - 3]. Results collected so far showed particularly wide variability of the Ca concentration [4]. The explanation of this observation remains unknown. The investigations concerning the renal calculi growth, their microscopic structure and elemental composition are still conducted. Uric acid calculi can be divided into two groups. Type I stones develop by crystallization of uric acid from supersaturated solution with respect to uric acid anhydrous (UAA) or uric acid dehydrate (UAD). Their size ranges from several to a dozen or so millimeters. These stones have lamellar structure with small centrally located core composed of the UAA crystals. The layers develop due to variable supersaturation of urine. Thicker layers are formed slowly, when supersaturation and pH are lower, while thinner ones develop quickly, at strong urine supersaturation and high pH. A characteristic feature of type II stones is the lack of any particular inner structure.

40|$|Boehmite, {{rather than}} gibbsite, {{precipitation}} {{has been proposed}} in the literature as a potential energy-saving modification of the Bayer process {{for the production of}} alumina. Previous experimental studies have reported that true equilibrium solubilities were not attained during boehmite precipitation. Instead, a pseudo-equilibrium or an apparent 'steady-state' aluminate concentration of about twice the boehmite solubility was reached. In this work, the dissolution and precipitation reactions in synthetic and plant liquors using seeds of (i) pure boehmite and (ii) various boehmite/gibbsite ratios were investigated at 95 °C. Only boehmite precipitation was observed on pure boehmite seed at relatively low supersaturation (alumina (A) /total caustic (TC) 0. 56). The aluminate concentrations measured as a function of time decreased continuously and did not exhibit an apparent 'steady state'. Stable equilibrium, as established by boehmite solubility measurements, was approached very slowly but not attained even after ten weeks. <b>At</b> <b>higher</b> <b>supersaturation</b> (A/TC 0. 67), after an initial desupersaturation, 'steady-state' aluminate concentrations of about twice the boehmite solubility were observed. There is convincing evidence that these 'steady states' correspond to metastable solubility equilibria with gibbsite, which is precipitated initially and gradually transforms into the stable phase, boehmite. Gibbsite also nucleated in the case of pure boehmite seeds. 'Steady states' were attained in one up to several days and remained constant for one to ten days. The length of these periods correlated with the gibbsite content of the seeds. After sufficient recrystallisation of gibbsite to boehmite, the aluminate concentrations decreased significantly and eventually approached boehmite solubility, thereby following a much slower precipitation kinetics typical for boehmite. Due to short observation times, previous workers did not detect the end of the 'steady-state' periods and therefore failed to identify the observed 'steady-state' aluminate concentrations as arising from metastable solubility equilibria with gibbsite...|$|E
40|$|Batch cooling crystallization, at the {{rotation}} speed of 700 min– 1, of an aqueous solution of a potassium sulphate {{has been investigated}} on a laboratory scale. The effect of hydrodynamics conditions on the crystallization process were investigated by using different type of impellers. Two types of impellers were investigated; the four-pitched blade impeller which generates axi-al flow and the six-blades Rusthon turbine which generates radial flow. The experiments were performed at four different linear cooling rates {{in the range from}} 8 - 20 °C h– 1 for both types of impeller. The influence of the cooling rates on the metastable zone width, the crystallization kinetics and the granulometric properties of the obtained crystals were investigated. The experimental data show that higher cooling rate expands the metastable zone for all the types of impeller (Fig. 2) and influences the crystal size distribution (Fig. 7 and Fig. 8). At low cooling rates, supersaturation was kept at a constant value for a longer period. It resulted in improved conditions for mass transfer and the crystals grew. Bigger crystals were obtained at lower cooling rates (Fig. 7). It is stated that radial flow (Rusthon turbine) is particularly inappropriate for the nucleation process, and for crystallization. Nucleation started at a lower temperature and higher supersaturation (Fig. 3). These conditions resulted in a high nucleation’s rate and large number of nucleation centres. Also, the obtained crystals settled {{on the wall of the}} reactor, baffles and stirrer. A great part of the obtained crystals was agglomerated.

40|$|Asymptotic giant branch (AGB) {{stars are}} known to be sites of dust {{formation}} and undergo significant mass loss. The outflow is believed to be driven by radiation pressure on grains and momentum coupling between the grains and gas. While the physics of shell dynamics and grain formation are closely coupled, most previous models of circumstellar shells have treated the problem separately. Studies of shell dynamics typically assume the existence of grains needed to drive the outflow, while most grain formation models assume a constant veolcity wind in which grains form. Furthermore, models of grain formation have relied primarily on classical nucleation theory instead of using a more realistic approach based on chemical kinetics. To model grain formation in carbon-rich AGB stars, we have coupled the kinetic equations governing small cluster growth to moment equations which determine the growth of large particles. Phenomenological models assuming stationary outflow are presented to demonstrate the differences between the classical nucleation approach and the kinetic equation method. It is found that classical nucleation theory predicts nucleation at a lower supersaturation ratio than is predicted by the kinetic equations, resulting in significant differences in grain properties. Coagulation of clusters larger than monomers is unimportant for grain formation in high mass-loss models but becomes more important to grain growth in low mass-loss situations. The properties of the dust grains are altered considerably if differential drift velocities are ignored in modeling grain formation. The effect of stellar temperature, stellar luminosity, and different outflow velocities are investigated. The models indicate that changing the stellar temperature while keeping the stellar luminosity constant has little effect on the physical parameters of the dust shell formed. Increasing the stellar luminosity while keeping the stellar temperature constant results in large differences in grain properties. For small outflow velocities, grains form at lower supersaturation ratios and close to the stellar photosphere, resulting in larger but fewer grains. The reverse is true when grains form under high outflow velocities, i. e., they form <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>supersaturation</b> ratios, farther from the star, and are much smaller but at larger quantities...|$|E
40|$|Dissolution and {{precipitation}} {{rates of}} low defect Georgia kaolinite (KGa- 1 b) {{as a function}} of Gibbs free energy of reaction (or reaction affinity) were measured at 22 C and pH 4 in continuously stirred flow through reactors. Steady state dissolution experiments showed slightly incongruent dissolution, with a Si/Al ratio of about 1. 12 that is attributed to the re-adsorption of Al on to the kaolinite surface. No inhibition of the kaolinite dissolution rate was apparent when dissolved aluminum was varied from 0 and 60 {micro}M. The relationship between dissolution rates and the reaction affinity can be described well by a Transition State Theory (TST) rate formulation with a Temkin coefficient of 2 R{sub diss} (mol/m{sup 2 }s) = 1. 15 x 10 {sup - 13 } [1 -exp(-{Delta}G/ 2 RT) ]. Stopping of flow in a close to equilibrium dissolution experiment yielded at solubility constant for kaolinite at 22 C of 10 {sup 7. 57 }. Experiments on the precipitation kinetics of kaolinite showed a more complex behavior. One conducted using kaolinite seed that had previously undergone extensive dissolution under far from equilibrium conditions for 5 months showed a quasi-steady state precipitation rate for 105 hours that was compatible with the TST expression above. After this initial period, however, precipitation rates decreased by an order of magnitude, and like other precipitation experiments conducted <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>supersaturation</b> and without kaolinite seed subjected to extensive prior dissolution, could not be described with the TST law. The initial quasi-steady state rate is interpreted as growth on activated sites created by the dissolution process, but this reversible growth mechanism could not be maintained once these sites were filled.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the manifold interactions that occur when alkaline-earth metal carbonates are crystallized in the presence of dissolved silica as an additive. The described work subdivides into two main lines of research. On the one hand, an understanding of the potential roles of silica during crystallization was sought on a fundamental level. That is, the mineral - in this case calcium carbonate - was directly precipitated from silica-containing solutions and the effect on growing particles and phase interconversions were characterized at different stages. On the other hand, experiments were performed in which the components were allowed to interact under conditions of low supersaturation, thus leading to gradual mineralization and enabling complex structuring. This resulted in the spontaneous self-assembly of hierarchical polycrystalline architectures, termed "silica biomorphs", which in the case of barium carbonate displayed delicate morphologies with sinuous shapes such as regular helicoids. Studies in the field of calcium carbonate precipitation showed that addition of silica is an effective means to arrest the crystallization process at virtually any stage simply by adjusting experimental parameters like species concentrations, pH, or temperature. In dilute systems, it was found that initially nucleated, metastable particles of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) become enveloped by a skin of silica due to local gradients in pH at growing surfaces and the intimate dependence of carbonate and silicate solubility on the pH. This spontaneous coating was investigated by a number of techniques and it was confirmed to increase the kinetic stability of the amorphous phase, causing decelerated conversion to stable calcite or fully preventing this energetically favored transformation. When stabilized temporarily, the inner ACC fraction of the as-formed core-shell particles served as a depot for CaCO 3, slowly releasing growth units to the solution. Under these circumstances, a broad variety of unusual calcite morphologies was obtained, ranging from single crystals with uncommon habit to aggregates of nanocrystals with shapes beyond crystallographic restraints. In brines <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>supersaturation</b> of CaCO 3, a distinct silica-mediated stabilization could be verified also for the metastable crystalline CaCO 3 modifications vaterite and aragonite, as evidenced by on-line diffraction analysis using synchrotron radiation. These findings suggest that the presence of silica, along with a sensible adjustment of conditions, does not only permit to study crystallization mechanisms in general by capturing transient intermediates, but also allows for a more or less concerted selection of polymorphs in the course of crystallization. The latter is clearly of interest for the synthesis of CaCO 3 powders with tunable properties in view of industrial applications, while the former and in particular the achieved stabilization of ACC may serve as novel approaches to scale inhibition. Finally, systems at fairly low CaCO 3 supersaturation and relatively high silica concentration were investigated. Here, the added silica was found to interfere with the crystallization process already before nucleation. In fact, so-called prenucleation clusters - recently discovered solute-like precursors of solid CaCO 3 - were traced in the samples and found to be protected against otherwise rapidly occurring nucleation by binding of silica in their periphery. This concept was elaborated to develop an experimental procedure for the isolation these elusive species and render their analysis by conventional methods possible. Further, the degree of stabilization could be tuned by varying the pH, such that nucleation proceeded gradually to later stages. Eventually, this strategy enabled a direct observation of the processes underlying nucleation, and a non-classical model for homogeneous nucleation of calcium carbonate is proposed. Work addressing silica biomorphs was primarily focused on unraveling the morphogenetic mechanisms governing the evolution of complex and biomimetic form in simple inorganic environments. To that end, existing ideas on a pH-based chemical coupling of the speciations of carbonate and silicate in aqueous solution and an associated dynamic interplay during precipitation were assessed and efforts were made to advance and substantiate corresponding models. By a series of experiments conducted under conditions of forced convection, it was ascertained that growth of silica biomorphs is a local phenomenon taking place only at the front of developing aggregates, where the supersaturation and thus the driving force for precipitation is enhanced as compared to the bulk. In particular, the mineralization of one of the components (BaCO 3 and silica) is thought to affect locally the chemistry of the other via the pH, ultimately triggering its precipitation. As a consequence, carbonate and silica are alternately deflected from equilibrium in time and therefore mineralized, depicting a synergetic scenario strongly reminiscent of the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction. This leads to a continuous production of silica-bearing BaCO 3 nanocrystals, which constitute the emerging silica biomorph. On larger length scales, the assembly of crystallites grows free from constraints, usually forming flat sheets that later curl and give rise to twisted morphologies by mutual winding of different segments. In light of the performed experiments, it appears as if the morphological evolution of the crystal aggregates is widely determined by the beneficial impact of extrinsic and intrinsic surfaces on nucleation barriers. In this paradigm, smooth curvature in silica biomorphs results from the propensity of forming crystal aggregates to fold back on themselves and use their existing surface as a substrate. In turn, flat morphologies are favored when the assembly grows in direct contact with a foreign interface, such as a container wall. These particular characteristics, together with the observed structural hierarchy, delineate a fascinating analogy between the obtained abiotic precipitates and biologically produced mineral frameworks found in the tissues and exoskeletons of diverse living organisms. In this manner and thanks to the ease of their preparation and handling, silica biomorphs can be considered valuable laboratory model systems for the study of biomineralization concepts. With respect to these properties, further work was devoted to widen the range of morphologies and structures accessible with silica biomorphs. This was achieved for instance by introducing specific additives or varying distinct synthesis parameters, partially triggering remarkable alterations in the self-assembly behavior. The observed changes are interpreted {{in the realm of the}} envisaged morphogenetic mechanism and can mainly be ascribed to subtle shifts in the speciation of silica under the respective conditions. Eventually, the kinetics of the formation of silica biomorphs were studied. For this purpose, the concentrations of the involved reagents were monitored over prolonged periods of time and compared with growth rates determined for individual crystal aggregates by video microscopy. Results confirm reaction control for the process, thus supporting the autocatalytic character of growing fronts. The gathered data moreover shed novel light on the role of silica during crystallization as well as the mode and degree of its incorporation into forming aggregates. The drawn conclusions contribute to a deeper understanding of the phenomena leading to complex self-organization in these simple systems and to some extent devise routes to transfer the inherent concepts to other minerals and the design of novel promising materials...|$|E

At the limit of the “dead ” growth zone, the much higher critical coverage θ * ~ 10 - 3 suggest the segregation coefficient of impurities increases dramatically at lower supersaturations. The influence of solution pH was discussed and the lower limit of adsorption energy of impurities (15 ÷ 18) kcal/mol was estimated...|$|R
40|$|The {{therapeutic}} management of pulmonary disease {{depends upon the}} efficient delivery of aerosolized drug particles with an aerodynamic diameter of 2. 5 ??? 6 mm (Pritchard 2001). Particles for such aerosols are routinely produced by jet milling, {{which can lead to}} the generation of amorphous regions on the surface or polymorphic conversion. An alternative strategy to directly crystallize the drug and limit subsequent particle growth, would provide the opportunity to avoid potential crystal modification during processing. Precipitation <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>supersaturation</b> produces primary particles in the low micron sizerange, but secondary growth frequently follows the aggregation and agglomeration of these primary particles (Yu et al 2005). The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the control of crystal growth of salmeterol xinafoate (SX) during crystallization from an aqueous phas...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} {{nucleation}} of vapor bubbles from a superheated liquid and of liquid droplets from a supersaturated vapor is investigated using the Modified-Core van der Waals model Density Functional Theory (Lutsko, JCP 128, 184711 (2008)). A novel {{approach is developed}} whereby nucleation {{is viewed as a}} transition from a metastable state to a stable state via the minimum free energy path which is identified using the nudged elastic-band method for exploring free energy surfaces. This allows for the unbiased calculation of the properties of sub- and super-critical clusters, {{as well as of the}} critical cluster. For Lennard-Jones fluids, the results compare well to simulation and support the view that even <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>supersaturation</b> nucleation proceeds smoothly rather than via spinodal-like instabilities as has been suggested recently...|$|R

It is {{shown that the}} kinetics of condensation are controlled by a nucleation and growth mechanism. <b>At</b> sufficiently <b>high</b> <b>supersaturation,</b> the charge transients are analyzed according to the Avrami equations and the Classical Nucleation Theory. The parameters involved, such as the supersaturation and the line tension, are compared for the two surfactants. © 1990. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|Nucleation in {{supersaturated}} vapor is investigated {{with two}} series of molecular dynamics simulations in the canonical ensemble. The applied methods are: (a) analysis of critical nuclei at moderate supersaturations by simulating equilibria of single droplets with surrounding vapors in small systems; (b) simulation of homogeneous nucleation during condensation with large systems containing 10 ^ 5 to 10 ^ 6 particles for calculating the nucleation rate of vapors <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>supersaturations.</b> For the Lennard-Jones fluid, truncated and shifted at 2. 5 {{times the size}} parameter, it is shown that the classical nucleation theory underestimates both the nucleation rate {{and the size of}} the critical nucleus. A surface property corrected modification of this theory is proposed to consistently cover data on the surface tension of the curved interface, the critical nucleus size, and the nucleation rate...|$|R
40|$|The {{precipitation}} kinetics of zinc sulfide were studied using a lab scale mixed-suspension-mixed-product-removal (MSMPR) precipitation reactor. The vessel was operated at different feed concentrations, molar ratios, stirrer speeds, pH-values, feed injection positions and residence times. Primary nucleation and volume average crystal growth rates {{as well as}} agglomeration kernel were determined. Relationships {{were found between the}} rates of the different crystallization steps {{on the one hand and}} supersaturation, stirrer speeds, pH-values, Zn 2 + to S 2 - ratio, feed positions on the other. These show that larger crystals are obtained <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>supersaturation,</b> moderate stirrer speeds, small residence times, a pH-value of around 5 and high Zn 2 + to S 2 - ratios. One should realize though that the applied MSMPR method is not the most optimal technique for examining fast precipitation reactions. ...|$|R
40|$|Computational {{models are}} {{developed}} {{in an effort}} to aid in the design of process equipment for the crystallization of pharmaceutical compounds. The models focus on the combination of population balance equations and computational fluid dynamics software. For the simulation of antisolvent crystallization, knowledge of kinetics <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>supersaturation</b> are necessary. Chapter 2 describes the concentration profile within a high-throughput, evaporation platform {{that can be used to}} create conditions of <b>high</b> <b>supersaturation</b> for the study of crystal polymorphs as well as nucleation and growth kinetics. An equation is derived which provides the maximum concentration difference within an evaporating droplet. Chapter 3 discusses the secondary nucleation phenomena of breakage due to ultrasonic irradiation of crystals dispersed in a fluid. The simulation provides optimal kinetic parameters for the breakage kernel found by comparison to experimental data. Chapter 4 implements fouling along the walls in the simulation of cooling crystallization of seeds in an agitated tank. Future goals include adding breakage and aggregation/agglomeration to the model described in Chapter 4 and using the increasing computational power of modern supercomputers to simulate the multiphase system...|$|R
40|$|The role of poly(octadecyl acrylate) in {{inhibiting}} wax {{formation and}} {{growth has been}} examined using both molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo methods. The simulations show that the defective wax growth identified in earlier studies(4, 6) has a simple energetic basis and indicates that the comblike polymeric inhibitors favor the formation island defects on the wax surface. These island defects have weak interactions with the surrounding crystal, and so act as impurity sites for blocking growth steps. Using the information gained from molecular dynamics simulations of wax growth at a wax/liquid heptane interface, we have generalized recent Monte Carlo growth methods to provide a realistic yet simple model of wax inhibition. The model predicts that poly(octadecyl acrylate) will prevent growth at low supersaturations, where growth occurs largely at step defects, and slows growth <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>supersaturations,</b> where island nucleation is important...|$|R
