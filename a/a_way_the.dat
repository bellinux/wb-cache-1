There was, however, a belief {{at the time that}} neither Scully nor Mulder should directly experience such phenomena. After Fox and the studio argued against the idea of using Mulder in such <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>the</b> producers agreed to make the change. The opening bank robbery scene was filmed on location in Vancouver, where Jason Schombing's acting led some bystanders to believe that robbery was a real one.|$|E

Everyone pushed everyone {{just a little}} further, to create something wonderful, and judging by the response, the audience realized it, as did Mariah when the song was finished. It was a rare moment, one that true performers strive for and don't find often enough to satisfy themselves.|$|E

25|$|Thomism {{remained}} a doctrine held principally by Dominican theologians, such as Giovanni Capreolo (1380–1444) or Tommaso de Vio (1468–1534). Eventually, in the 16th century, Thomism found a stronghold on the Iberian Peninsula, through {{for example the}} Dominicans Francisco de Vitoria (particularly noteworthy {{for his work in}} natural law theory), Domingo de Soto (notable for his work on economic theory), John of St. Thomas, and Domingo Báñez; the Carmelites of Salamanca (i.e., the Salmanticenses); and even, in <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>the</b> newly formed Jesuits, particularly Francisco Suárez, and Luis de Molina.|$|E

25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{took off}} from Cheju at 21:07 for Seoul. The flight was cleared to land on runway 14R with a crosswind component as the wind was from 220 degrees at 22 knots. Upon touchdown, the captain misused the reverse thrusters in <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> No. 1 engine failed to provide reverse thrust. Coupled with the fact the captain was confused with crosswind conditions and the first officer was preoccupied and {{not paying attention to}} the landing, the 747 failed to stop {{before the end of the}} runway. The aircraft swerved to the right and slid into a ditch at 50 knots with the fuselage splitting up.|$|E
25|$|As {{knowledge}} of different religions has grown, so have claims of bodily disappearance of some religious and mythological figures. In ancient Greek religion, this was <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> gods made some physically immortal, including such figures as Cleitus, Ganymede, Menelaus, and Tithonus. After his death, Cycnus was {{changed into a}} swan and vanished. In his chapter on Romulus from Parallel Lives, Plutarch criticises the continuous belief in such disappearances, referring to the allegedly miraculous disappearance of the historical figures Romulus, Cleomedes of Astypalaea, and Croesus. In ancient times, Greek and Roman pagan similarities were explained by the early Christian writers, such as Justin Martyr, {{as the work of}} demons, with the intention of leading Christians astray.|$|E

Among other influences, the last minute inclusion of a decree on sacred images was a French initiative, and the text, never discussed {{on the floor of}} the council or referred to council theologians, was based on a French draft.|$|E

25|$|Yang Jwing-Ming (who {{is not a}} {{practitioner}} of the art) argues that aspects of Xing Yi Quan (particularly the animal styles) are identifiable {{as far back as}} the Liang Dynasty at the Shaolin Temple. According to Jwing-Ming, Yue Fei therefore did not strictly invent Xing Yi Quan, but synthesized and perfected existing Shaolin principles into his own style of gongfu which he popularized during his military service. Nonetheless, according to Jwing-Ming, Yue Fei is usually identified as the creator because of his considerable understanding of the art (as shown in the work The Ten Theses of Xingyiquan, credited to Yue) and his cultural status as a Chinese war hero. It ought be noted that in Chinese culture, it is common to attribute the creation of great traditions to legendary individuals. In such <b>a</b> <b>way,</b> <b>the</b> art of Tai Ji Quan is attributed to the legendary Zhang Sanfeng, and Daoism to Laozi, even though as in the case with Yue Fei, there exists no proof for such claim.|$|E
25|$|The {{crux of the}} 1981 dispute {{was about}} {{compensation}} {{for the loss of}} players to free agency. After losing a top-rank player in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> owners wanted a mid-rank player in return, the so-called sixteenth player (each club was allowed to protect 15 players from this rule). Losing lower rated free agents would have correspondingly smaller compensation. The players, only recently freed from the bondage of the reserve clause, found this unacceptable, and withdrew their labor, striking on June 12. Immediately, the U.S. Government National Labor Relations Board ruled that the owners had not been negotiating in good faith, and installed a federal mediator to reach a solution. Seven weeks and 713 games were lost {{in the middle of the}} season, before the owners backed down on July 31, settling for much lower ranked players as compensation. By then much of the season had been lost, and the season was continued as distinct halves starting August 9, with the playoffs reorganized to reflect this.|$|E
25|$|During {{operations}} in the Nahr el-Bared camp in North Lebanon, lacking any airworthy, fixed-wing strike aircraft, the Lebanese Army modified several UH-1H Huey helicopters to permit the carrying of 500pound Mark 82 and 1000pound Mark 83 bombs (all unguided iron bombs, also known as dumb bombs) as well as Matra SNEB 68mm rocket pods (taken from stored Hawker Hunters). Special mounting pads engineered by the Lebanese Army were attached to each Huey on the sides and belly to carry the bombs. The air force, {{in collaboration with the}} engineering regiment, developed and used two dumb bomb variants, the 250kg LAF-GS-ER2 and the 400kg LAF-GS-ER3. Usually, helicopters cannot bomb using this method, in comparison to ground attack aircraft, so this became one of the rare moments in history during which helicopters were used in such <b>a</b> <b>way.</b> <b>The</b> Lebanese Army also made extensive use of Aérospatiale Gazelles armed with Euromissile HOT anti-tank guided missiles and machine gun pods.|$|E

25|$|In 1992, the Ontario {{government}} {{passed legislation}} requiring Metropolitan Toronto {{to include the}} rest of the Greater Toronto Area into its planning. Despite this however, there was fear different parts of the municipal system were working against one another. Because of this, Bob Rae, then the Premier of Ontario, appointed Anne Golden to head a GTA task force to govern the region's quality of life, competitiveness and governance. During this time, the Metro Toronto government advocated to the task force {{the creation of a new}} GTA authority, which would be made up of 21 of the 30 existing municipalities in the GTA at the time. The proposal from Metro Toronto would have resulted in 15 new municipalities. The City of Mississauga argued consolidation should only take place in such <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> new municipalities would have a population between 400,000 and 800,000. The Town of Markham had similarly advocated municipal consolidation in York Region, although it was opposed to complete consolidation into a single municipality. Municipal consolidation faced stiff opposition however from smaller communities such as Ajax, Milton, and the borough of East York. The task force's recommendation to eliminate the Metro Toronto government, and consolidate its remaining municipalities into an enlarged City of Toronto was completed in 1997, under Mike Harris. However, the task force's recommendation to create a GTA-tier municipality was not taken up by the Harris government, fearing a GTA-wide municipality would recreate the inter-municipal competitiveness that was believed to have impaired the former Metro Toronto government.|$|E
