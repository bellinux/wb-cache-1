5|$|Hansell lectured on {{the theory}} of {{precision}} air attack throughout his life, particularly at the United States Air Force Academy and the <b>Air</b> <b>War</b> College. He authored three books on air strategy: The <b>Air</b> <b>War</b> Plan That Defeated Hitler (1972), The Strategic <b>Air</b> <b>War</b> Against Japan (1980), and Strategic <b>Air</b> <b>War</b> Against Germany and Japan: A Memoir (1986). Hansell continued to study modern weapons systems, becoming an advocate of the Strategic Defense Initiative and the B-2 Spirit bomber. However his main focus was in promoting technical advances in precision guided weapons to make precision bombing more practical and therefore more desirable as a military strategy.|$|E

5|$|From October 1951 to May 1954 Wilson was Commandant of the <b>Air</b> <b>War</b> College at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama.

25|$|Starting {{with the}} buildup in 1965, the Air Force, while {{continuing}} to conduct the four <b>air</b> <b>wars,</b> adjusted its structure in Southeast Asia to absorb incoming units. Temporarily deployed squadrons became permanent in November. A wing structure replaced the groups. On 8 July 1965, the 33d Tactical Group was redesignated the 6250th Combat Support Group.|$|R

5|$|Some historians {{dispute the}} degree to which the Akutan Zero {{influenced}} the outcome of the <b>air</b> <b>war</b> in the Pacific. For example, the Thach Weave, a tactic created by John Thach and used with great success by American airmen against the Zero, was devised by Thach prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, based on intelligence reports on the Zero's performance in China.|$|E
5|$|After Hitler's death, Speer {{offered his}} {{services}} to the so-called Flensburg Government, headed by Hitler's successor, Karl Dönitz, and took {{a significant role in}} that short-lived regime. On May15, an allied delegation arrived and asked Speer if {{he would be willing to}} provide information on the effects of the <b>air</b> <b>war.</b> Speer agreed, and over the next several days, provided information on a broad range of subjects. On May23, two weeks after the surrender of German forces, British troops arrested the members of the Flensburg Government and brought Nazi Germany to a formal end.|$|E
5|$|E-3 Sentry {{aircraft}} {{were among}} the first to deploy during Operation Desert Shield, where they immediately established as an around-the-clock radar screen to defend against Iraqi forces. During Operation Desert Storm, E-3s flew 379 missions and logged 5,052 hours of on-station time. The data collection capability of the E-3 radar and computer subsystems allowed an entire <b>air</b> <b>war</b> to be recorded for the first time in history. In addition to providing senior leadership with time-critical information on the actions of enemy forces, E-3 controllers assisted in 38 of the 41 air-to-air kills recorded during the conflict.|$|E

5|$|For the Americans, Laos {{became almost}} {{exclusively}} an <b>air</b> <b>war,</b> one which saw {{a reversal of}} the role it played in the conflict in neighboring South Vietnam. In Laos, the Air Force applied conventional air power in the support of an unconventional ground war. The mission of the U.S. Air Force was to seal off the southern Mekong River Valley, thus providing a buffer for Thailand; insulating the Vientiane government from direct communist threat; draining PAVN manpower and resources; and interdiction of the approaches to the Ho Chi Minh trail.|$|E
5|$|Once air-to-air combat began over North Vietnam, the Air Force {{was again}} found lacking. The {{mainstay}} missiles of the <b>air</b> <b>war</b> {{turned out to}} be the Navy-developed AIM-9 Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow, not its own AIM-4 Falcon. The Air Force continuously opposed adapting to the war in Southeast Asia, since its leadership believed that it was an aberration that would be quickly resolved. It could then turn its attention (and its more modern weapons) against the greater threat posed by the Soviet Union. None in the Air Force high command foresaw that the war would drag on for nearly a decade.|$|E
5|$|The 2/6th Independent Company had {{defeated}} {{the vanguard of}} Nakai's force and stopped his advance down the Markham Valley dead in its tracks. The Battle of Kaiapit accomplished Vasey's primary mission, for the Japanese could no longer threaten Nadzab. It opened {{the gate to the}} Ramu Valley for the 21st Infantry Brigade, provided new forward fighter airstrips for the <b>air</b> <b>war</b> against the Japanese, and validated the Australian Army's new training methods and the organisational emphasis on firepower.|$|E

5|$|The Australian {{victory at}} Kaiapit enabled the Australian 7th Division to be flown {{in to the}} upper Markham Valley. It {{accomplished}} the 7th Division's primary mission, for the Japanese could no longer threaten Lae or Nadzab, where a major airbase was being developed. The victory also led to the capture of the entire Ramu Valley, which provided new forward fighter airstrips for the <b>air</b> <b>war</b> against the Japanese.|$|E
5|$|The Cooper–Church Amendment was resurrected {{during the}} winter and {{incorporated}} into the Supplementary Foreign Assistance Act of 1970. This time the measure made it through both houses of Congress and became law on 22 December. As a result, all U.S. ground troops and advisors were barred from participating in military actions in Laos or Cambodia, while the <b>air</b> <b>war</b> being conducted in both countries by the U.S. Air Force was ignored.|$|E
5|$|The Hunter {{was to play}} a {{major role}} during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965; along with the Gnat the Hunter was India's primary air defence fighter, and {{regularly}} engaged in dogfights with the Pakistani F-86 Sabres and F-104 Starfighters. The aerial war saw both sides conducting thousands of sorties in a single month. Both sides claimed victory in the <b>air</b> <b>war,</b> Pakistan claimed to have destroyed 104 aircraft against its own losses of 19, while India claimed to have destroyed 73 enemy aircraft and lost 35 of its own. Despite the intense fighting, the conflict was effectively a stalemate.|$|E
25|$|The United States Air Force now {{had four}} {{distinct}} <b>air</b> <b>wars</b> {{on the mainland}} of Southeast Asia, as the offensive against North Vietnam took its place alongside the attacks in South Vietnam and in northern and southern Laos. In 1965, United States Air Force was not fully equipped, suitably trained, nor doctrinally prepared for the situation in Southeast Asia. The transition from massive retaliation to flexible response and the shift from nuclear to conventional weapons remained incomplete.|$|R
