40|$|In {{this study}} we {{examined}} three aspects pertaining to adrenocortical responsiveness in free-ranging <b>Australian</b> <b>freshwater</b> <b>crocodiles</b> (Crocodylus johnstoni). First, we examined the ability of <b>freshwater</b> <b>crocodiles</b> to produce corticosterone {{in response to a}} typical capture-stress protocol. A second objective addressed the relationship between capture stress, plasma glucose and corticosterone. Next we examined if variation in basal and capture-stress-induced levels of plasma corticosterone was linked to ecological or demographic factors for individuals in this free-ranging population. Blood samples obtained on three field trips were taken from a cross-sectional sample of the population. Crocodiles were bled once during four time categories at 0, 0. 5, 6, and 10 h post-capture. Plasma corticosterone increased significantly with time post-capture. Plasma glucose also significantly increased with duration of capture-stress and exhibited a positive and significant relationship with plasma corticosterone. Significant variation in basal or stress induced levels of corticosterone in crocodiles was not associated with any ecological or demographic factors including sex, age class or the year of capture that the crocodiles were sampled from. However, three immature males had basal levels of plasma corticosterone greater than 2 standard deviations above the mean. While crocodiles exhibited a pronounced, adrenocortical and hyperglycaemic response to capture stress, limited variation in adrenocortical responsiveness due to ecological and demographic factors was not evident. This feature could arise in part because this population was sampled during a period of environmental benigness. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The {{vertebrate}} pineal gland is {{the primary}} source of melatonin, the rhythmic secretion of which is influenced by environmental light and temperature, thereby providing animals with information about seasonally changing photoperiod and thermoperiod. Although pineal glands are present in the majority of vertebrate species, a discrete organ is reported to be absent in the Crocodilia. However, if the melatonin rhythm is crucial to the survival of the organism, it would be expected that the rhythm would be present in crocodiles. In the present study, we measured blood plasma melatonin over a 30 -h period in aestivating <b>Australian</b> <b>freshwater</b> <b>crocodiles</b> (Crocodylus johnstoni) in their natural habitat {{at the end of the}} dry season (November) and found no discernible melatonin rhythm. However, another group of captive-reared C. johnstoni, maintained under natural light and temperature cycles and sampled in the early dry season (June) showed a clear melatonin rhythm. These results suggest that there is either an extrapineal source of melatonin in this crocodile species or that there is melatonin producing tissue elsewhere which heretofore has not been discovered. Further studies are needed to determine why the melatonin rhythm is intermittently expressed and whether this may be related to seasonal changes in the expression of the rhythm linked to tropical environments.

5000|$|Spinosaurids have in {{the past}} often been {{considered}} mainly fish-eaters (piscivores), based on comparisons of their jaws with the jaws of modern crocodilians [...] Rayfield and colleagues, in 2007, conducted biomechanical studies on the skull of the European spinosaurid Baryonyx, which has a long, laterally compressed skull, comparing it to gharial (long, narrow, tubular) and alligator (flat and wide) skulls [...] They found that the structure of baryonychine jaws converged on that gharials, in that the two taxa showed similar response patterns to stress from simulated feeding loads, and did so with and without the presence of a (simulated) secondary palate. The gharial, exemplar of a long, narrow, tubular snout, is a fish specialist. However, this snout anatomy doesn’t preclude other options for the spinosaurids. While the gharial is the most extreme example and a fish specialist, and <b>Australian</b> <b>freshwater</b> <b>crocodiles</b> (Crocodylus johnstoni), which have long, narrow and tubular snouts as well, specialize more on fish than sympatric, broad snouted crocodiles, C. johnstoni is itself an opportunistic feeder which eats all manner of small aquatic prey, including insects and crustaceans [...] Thus, the long, narrow, tubular snout correlates with fish-eating, and this is consistent with hypotheses of fish-eating for spinosaurids, in particular baryonychines, but does not indicate that they were solely piscivorous. [...] A further study by Cuff and Rayfield (2013) on the skulls of Spinosaurus and Baryonyx did not recover similarities in the skulls of Baryonyx and the gharial that the previous study did. Baryonyx had, in models where the size difference of the skulls was corrected for, greater resistance to torsion and dorsoventral bending than both Spinosaurus and the gharial, while both spinosaurids were inferior to the gharial, alligator, and slender-snouted crocodile in resisting torsion and medio-lateral bending [...] When the results from the modeling were not scaled according to size, then both spinosaurids performed better than all the crocodilians in resistance to bending and torsion, due to their larger size [...] Thus, Cuff and Rayfield suggest that the skulls are not built to efficiently built to deal well with relatively large, struggling prey, but that the spinosaurids may overcome prey just by their size advantage, and not skull build. Sues and colleagues studied the construction of the spinosaurid skull, and concluded that their mode of feeding was to use extremely quick, powerful strikes to seize small prey items with the jaws, employing the powerful neck muscles in rapid up-and-down motion. Due to the narrow snout, powerful side-to-side motion of the skull in prey capture is unlikely [...]|$|R

40|$|Griphobilharzia amoena Platt and Blair, 1991 was {{originally}} {{described as a}} dioecious trematode, parasitic in the circulatory system of the <b>Australian</b> <b>freshwater</b> <b>crocodile,</b> Crocodylus johnstoni, with the female completely enclosed in a gynecophoric chamber of the male and the 2 worms oriented anti-parallel to each other. A recent publication questions the original description, arguing that G. amoena is monoecious and, as a consequence, the species was transferred to Vasotrema Stunkard, 1928 (Spirorchiidae) as Vasotrema amoena n. comb. We provide photomicrographic evidence that the original description of G. amoena is correct and that Griphobilharzia Platt and Blair, 1991, is a valid monotypic genus containing G. amoena. An accurate understanding of the anatomy of G. amoena is not trivial and has implications for revealing the complex origins and evolution of the dioecious condition within the Schistosomatoidea.

Here, we describe methods for the acquisition and monitoring of behavioural and physiological variables from free-ranging crocodilians through the use of archival tags (data-loggers) and via satellite, radio and acoustic telemetry. Specifically, the attachment or implantation of electronic tags is described and examples provided of the type of data that can be collected. Our research group has used a combination of approaches to monitor the movements, diving activity, body temperatures and heart rates of crocodilians, including studies on the <b>Australian</b> <b>freshwater</b> <b>crocodile</b> (Crocodylus johnstoni), the estuarine crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) and the caiman (Caiman latirostris).

40|$|The <b>Australian</b> <b>freshwater</b> <b>crocodile,</b> Crocodylus johnstoni, heats {{significantly}} {{faster than}} it cools. Under the experimental conditions, cooling rate {{was found to be}} approximately 80 % of heating rate in both air and water. Heart rate during heating is more rapid than during cooling. Convective transfer of heat within the body is effected by the circulatory system, and this far exceeds rates of heat transfer by conduction alone. Localized heating of the body surface results in a cutaneous vasodilation which promotes uptake of heat. Localized cooling of the body surface results in cutaneous vasoconstriction, promoting heat conservation. Increase or decrease in heart rate accompanies cutaneous vasodilation or vasoconstriction. The dilation or constriction of cutaneous blood vessels and the acceleration or deceleration of heart rate are seen as separate responses to surface heating or cooling. Together they promote heat gain or retard heat loss and provide physiological mechanisms contributing to thermoregulation in C. johnstoni...|$|E
40|$|Interspecific adult bite {{forces for}} all extant crocodylian species are now known. However, how bite forces scale during {{ontogeny}} across the clade {{has yet to}} be studied. Here we test the hypotheses that extant crocodylians share positively allometric and statistically comparable developmental scaling coefficients for maximal bite-force capacity relative to body size. To do this, we measured bite forces in the <b>Australian</b> <b>freshwater</b> <b>crocodile</b> Crocodylus johnsoni and the Saltwater crocodile C.  porosus, and determined how performance changed during ontogeny. We statistically compared these results with those for the American alligator Alligator mississippiensis using 95 % prediction intervals and interpreted our findings in a phylogenetic context. We found no observable taxon-specific shifts in the intraspecific scaling of biomechanical performance. Instead, all bite-force values in our crocodylid dataset fell within the bounds of the A.  mississippiensis 95 % prediction intervals, suggesting similar bite-force capacity when same-sized individuals are compared. This holds true regardless of differences in developmental stage, potential adult body size, rostro-dental form, bone mineralization, cranial suturing, dietary differences or phylogenetic relatedness. These findings suggest that intraspecific bite-force scaling for crocodylians with feeding ecologies comparable with those of extant forms has likely remained evolutionarily static during their diversification...|$|E
