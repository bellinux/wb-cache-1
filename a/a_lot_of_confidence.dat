Then I wanted to bring the other players on towards the end. It worked and it showed that we have a great squad – better than last season." [...] Crouch, scorer of the winning goal, was also confident the result would boost the Liverpool squad: [...] "There is a bit of rivalry between the sides and it is great to get an early one over them.

50|$|However {{the stable}} was endowed {{with a fine}} set of two-year-olds. An early winner {{at the end of}} May was Mr H J Joel’s Mill Reef colt Main Reef. Mercer rode him to win his maiden debut at Sandown Park at the end of May, and then again to win the Chesham Stakes at Royal Ascot. He {{completed}} a quickfire hat-trick in early July when winning the July Stakes at Newmarket. He then took a break before reappearing at Newbury when winning the Mill Reef Stakes, later losing the race through disqualification. His season ended slightly disappointingly when beaten into fourth in the Middle Park Stakes. The next top two-year-old to come along was Lord Howard de Walden’s colt Kris. Lord Howard had had horses both with Cecil and Murless, but up to this point the best horse Cecil had trained for him had been the gelding Fool’s Mate, who was a tough handicapper. Kris took the relationship into another realm, but one could not have foretold this from Kris’s early runs. Kris appeared first at Leicester in mid-June and won impressively at 6-1 on his 5furlong maiden debut. Although the press liked his performance, expectations were dampened when stable representative Paddy Rudkin said ‘we have plenty better at home’. His next race was chosen to be a maidens-at-closing race at Folkestone in early July, which he again won well. Kris then suffered a slight setback and was not seen out again until mid-October when with <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> stable <b>confidence</b> he won the 6 furlong Rockingham Stakes at York, coming away powerfully from his field to win by an impressive 4 lengths. Twelve days later he finished off his season when winning the Horris Hill Stakes at Newbury. Not as dominant as in his previous races as Mercer had to give him a harder race, it did show he was improving with each race.|$|R

Pinot launched an attack from the group, but Špilak had the resources {{to keep up with}} him for a while but was ultimately dropped. Pinot passed the passive Denifl before the arch signaling the last kilometer (flamme rouge) and took a solo victory. Pozzovivo finished second while Špilak settled for third. However, it became soon apparent that Dumoulin would not lose much more than the minute and a half that was his objective. He passed the line 1' 37" [...] down on Pinot. [...] "I'm very happy, it was important for me and the team. We came here to win a stage, and I had good legs today.

[...] In the subsequent post-race press conference, Hamlin said, [...] "First thing I asked is how many cars on the lead lap, because I wanted to see how bad our day was going to be. I set a goal (of) top 15, and then it was top eight and then top six and, 'Holy cow, we can win this thing.' We just made a heck of a charge at the end." [...] Bowyer was delighted with his victory: [...] " [...] Shane [...] built a brand new race car and we came here and we were fast right off the truck, and everybody had <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence,</b> a pep in their step.

500|$|MPC {{additionally}} {{worked on}} the disappearing waterfall that serves as Jennifer's grave when she is killed {{at the beginning of}} the film. They transformed the mysterious waterfall into a whirlpool. [...] "We came up with an approach that we thought would work because we had <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>confidence</b> in our water sims", stated Nordby. [...] "The waterfall appears both as a day and night shot, so we had to integrate with the water. And the night shots play a pivotal role in the film, and we do a huge crane over." [...] They could not lock it to a pan or to a tilt and filming the shots was difficult due to the actual base of the waterfall being out of reach. Nordby said, [...] "I eventually lowered down a shot—a ton of reference of the area because I knew we'd have to do some digi-matte work to recreate the basin that the whirlpool ends up in." [...] They soon realized that there was an insufficient amount of churning and foam to read as real as the location. The CG Supervisor, Pete Dionne, presented a different idea. [...] "He grabbed chunks of that river and tialing it so that it had a nice stretch of birds' eye point of view of the water that existed on the location in the lighting situation we were trying to match", stated Nordby. [...] "And then he projected that onto a whirlpool of animated sprites and had similar enough texture to the actual water that existed there, but pulled control into lighting it and could add depth mainly to the center of it." [...] Dealing with [...] "very shallow" [...] water, the team had to take extra care when filming the scenes.|$|E
