5|$|Tarrare (c.1772–1798), {{sometimes}} spelled Tarare, was a French showman and soldier, {{noted for}} his unusual eating habits. Able to eat {{vast amounts of}} meat, he was constantly hungry; his parents could not provide for him, and he was turned {{out of the family}} home as a teenager. He travelled France {{in the company of a}} band of thieves and prostitutes, before becoming the warm-up act to a travelling charlatan; he would swallow corks, stones, live animals <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> basketful of apples. He then took this act to Paris where he worked as a street performer.|$|E
5|$|The {{purchase}} of the Boeing 707 aircraft would be followed by several orders for Vickers competing design, the VC10, with BOAC having ordered 35 VC10 aircraft by 1959 and an additional ten (bringing the total on order to 45) by 1961. Payments for these aircraft together with a downturn in transatlantic traffic, increased competition on the transatlantic route by additional carriers equipped with jet aircraft, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> host of additional {{costs associated with the}} Vickers VC10 and Bristol Britannia purchase would result in BOAC becoming extremely unprofitable from late 1961 onwards.|$|E

25|$|CNBC.com is the {{companion}} website {{to the financial}} network. It was launched in 1996 with minimal content, other than showing program grids, host biographies and basic network images (on the internet, business news then was handled by msnbc.com, which later became NBCNews.com).

25|$|The House of Love ({{the band}}'s 1988 debut album) was reissued on CD in 2007.

25|$|The release {{method for}} April was, once again, unorthodox. In 2006, Crosby {{released}} an online {{version of the}} acoustic album online with ten tracks. April was mostly recorded only by Crosby and an acoustic guitar, with minimal use of bass and drums. After the online release, Crosby said he was unhappy with it {{and went back to}} the studio to add four new tracks <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> new track listing. The cover featured fan-made artwork, and the album received a traditional release in stores. The album was not as well received by critics and fans, but was modestly embraced. Crosby later said that he only had it in him to do one album like April, and that it was his favorite VAST album.|$|E

25|$|For me, playing {{together}} again was {{to close the}} chapter on that era. We played those songs so we can hopefully move forward and do new music that represents where we are now. When playing those songs, I thought, 'Here's a person {{at the time that}} I don't relate to anymore.'

25|$|When {{the series}} Judge Dredd was being {{developed}} in 1976–77 {{it was originally}} planned that the story would be set in New York, in the near future. However, when artist Carlos Ezquerra drew his first story for the series, a skyscraper {{in the background of}} one panel looked so futuristic that editor Pat Mills instructed him to draw a full-page poster of the city. Ezquerra's vision of the city – with massive tower blocks and endless roads suspended vast distances above the ground with no visible means of support – was so futuristic that it prompted a rethink, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> new city was proposed. Art director Doug Church suggested that the city should extend along the entire Eastern Seaboard, and be called Mega-City One, and his idea was adopted.|$|E
25|$|Trongsa Dzong is {{the largest}} dzong {{fortress}} in Bhutan, located in Trongsa (formerly Tongsa) in Trongsa district, in {{the centre of the}} country. Built on a spur overlooking the gorge of the Mangde River, a temple was first established at the location in 1543 by the Drukpa lama, Ngagi Wangchuk son of Ngawang Chhojey. In 1647, his great-grandson Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal (Shabdrung or Zhabdrung being his title), constructed the first dzong to replace it, called Chökhor Rabtentse Dzong with a shorter version of Choetse Dzong. It was enlarged several times during the 18th century; the Chenrezig Lhakang was built in 1715 <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> complex, including the Maitreya (Jampa) temple, was added in 1771. The dzong has since been repaired on several occasions; it was damaged during the 1897 Assam earthquake and underwent extensive renovation in 1927 and 1999.|$|E

25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, women were regarded as society's guardians of morality; they were seen as possessing a finer nature than men and were expected to act as such. Their role was not defined as workers or money makers. Women were expected to hold on to their innocence until the right man came along so that they can start a family and inculcate that morality they were in charge of preserving. The role of men was to support the family financially. Yet {{at the turn of the}} 20th century, social attitudes towards educating young women were changing. Women in North America and Western Europe were now becoming more and more educated, in no small part because of the efforts of pioneering women to further their own education, defying opposition by male educators. By 1900, four out of five colleges accepted women <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> coed concept was becoming more and more accepted.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} season, 1986–87, the Whalers {{won their}} lone division championship, led by centers Ron Francis and Ray Ferraro, emerging winger Kevin Dineen, defenseman Ulf Samuelsson, superstar goaltender Mike Liut and troubled scorer Sylvain Turgeon. The 93 points earned that season {{were the most}} they would earn as an NHL team in Hartford; however, they were quickly eliminated {{in the first round}} by the Nordiques. The Whalers started the series strongly, winning the first two games at home, but, beginning in Game 3, the Nordiques were able to successfully take the Whalers off their game by playing a tough, chippy style of hockey. As a result, both teams broke NHL records in penalty minutes for an individual playoff game <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> playoff series. The Nordiques won the next four games and thus the series, four games to two. While Hartford would make the playoffs for the next five seasons in a row, they never came close to duplicating their previous success, with one exception in the 1989–90 season.|$|E
25|$|Thus by the 13th {{century the}} tender joys of the Nativity of Jesus {{were added to}} the agony of his Crucifixion <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> new range of {{approved}} religious emotions were ushered in, with wide ranging cultural impacts for centuries thereafter. The Franciscans approached both ends of this spectrum of emotions. On one hand the introduction of the Nativity scene encouraged the tender image of Jesus, while on the other hand Francis of Assisi himself had a deep attachment to the sufferings of Jesus on the Cross and was said to have received the Stigmata as an expression of that love. The dual nature of Franciscan piety based both on joy of Nativity and the sacrifice at Calvary had a deep appeal among city dwellers and as the Franciscan Friars travelled, these emotions spread across the world, transforming the Kyrios image of Jesus to a more tender, loving, and compassionate image. These traditions did not remain limited to Europe and soon spread to the {{other parts of the world}} such as Latin America, the Philippines and the United States.|$|E

25|$|Porfirio Díaz was, {{and still}} is, admired by many. Towards {{the end of}} his {{presidency}} in 1908, James Creelman interviewed Díaz and produced an embellished and eulogistic report of him which was soon published in Pearson’s Magazine in the United States. In the interview, Díaz revealed that he would not run for the presidency again, effectively removing him from office in the upcoming elections of 1910. Díaz was perhaps overconfident or naive in thinking that his interview would remain in the anglo-speaking world, because the Mexican newspaper El Imparcial wasted no time in translating and publishing the interview. The Mexican people held Díaz to his word, but shortly after, Díaz broke his word and announced that he would run for reelection. The effects of this produced an opposition party that was to overthrow Díaz from office and force him into exile in 1911. Surely, Creelman did not foresee this happening as he devoted the interview <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> book, published in 1911 just before Díaz was sent into exile, to praising Díaz and justifying his whole regime.|$|E
25|$|The Six Dynasties poetic period {{formed an}} {{important}} {{link between the}} folk-ballad (yuefu) style prominent in the poetry of the Han dynasty and the following revival and experimentation with the older forms during the Tang dynasty. Even before the formal end of the Han Dynasty the poetic developments typical of that era had begun to yield to the Jian'an style, just as {{the political power of}} Han yielded more and more to that of the rising power of various regional hegemons, including Cao Cao and the Cao family. The Cao family was both poetically involved in this process {{towards the end of the}} Han era and into the beginning of the subsequent Three Kingdoms era, one of which kingdoms was founded by the Cao family as dynasts. The Cao family's new state, which they called Wei, also was the base area of the Sima clan, which increased in power over time, until one of the Sima family became Emperor Wu of Jin. The early phase of this Jin dynasty, known as Western Jin, provided a unified period for China (265–316), but lacking long-term stability. After this period, the Jin ceded control of the north to various successor states. However, the Jin dynasty as a whole was rather productive of poetry, both original works and collections and criticism. The north–south divide continued as a major feature in the landscape of Chinese poetry through the eventual Sui dynasty re-unification, which shortly gave way to the relatively unified and long term stability of the Tang dynasty, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> new poetic era of Tang poetry.|$|E
25|$|Upset, Brecken tasks Crane {{with the}} job of making a deal with Rais. Upon meeting Rais, Crane is able to confirm that he is indeed Suleiman. He carries {{out a series of}} {{unethical}} tasks for Rais under the assumption that he will be rewarded with two crates of Antizin. Crane is unable to locate the file, and is later betrayed by Rais, who only gives him five vials of Antizin. He later breaks off business with the GRE when they halt the supply drops and refuse to help the Tower. The situation in the tower worsens, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> floor is sealed off when an outbreak occurs. In desperate hopes to find Antizin, Crane and Jade pull a raid on a supply storage facility run by Rais, which was formerly a school. They find no Antizin, but rather plastic explosives, which they choose to confiscate to prevent Rais from using them in the future. While doing an errand, Rahim tells Crane that he and Omar (Emmerson Brooks) were planning to bomb an infected nest with the explosives found at the school. Crane is opposed to this plan. After discovering that Rahim went outside the Tower to plant the explosives, he chases after him. Upon catching up to him, he finds that Omar is dead, while Rahim has been wounded. He then executes Rahim's plans, resulting in the killing of the infected in the compound. When he gets back to Rahim he discovers that he was actually bitten and had turned while Crane was gone, forcing Crane to snap Rahim's neck when he attacks Crane. Crane returns to the tower to inform Brecken of the news; Jade overhears them and, visibly upset, takes off.|$|E
