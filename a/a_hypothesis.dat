5|$|Being a scientist, {{above all}} else, Huxley {{presented}} agnosticism {{as a form}} of demarcation. <b>A</b> <b>hypothesis</b> with no supporting objective, testable evidence is not an objective, scientific claim.

Karl Popper would also describe himself as an agnostic. According to philosopher William L. Rowe, in this strict sense, agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist.|$|E
60|$|Do {{not allow}} yourselves to be misled by the common notion that <b>an</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is untrustworthy {{simply because it}} is <b>an</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> It is often urged, in respect to some {{scientific}} conclusion, that, after all, it is only <b>an</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> But what more have we to guide us in nine-tenths {{of the most important}} affairs of daily life than hypotheses, and often very ill-based ones? So that in science, where the evidence of <b>an</b> <b>hypothesis</b> is subjected to the most rigid examination, we may rightly pursue the same course. You may have <b>hypotheses</b> and <b>hypotheses.</b> <b>A</b> man may say, if he likes, that the moon is made of green cheese: that is <b>an</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> But another man, who has devoted {{a great deal of time}} and attention to the subject, and availed himself of the most powerful telescopes and the results of the observations of others, declares that in his opinion it is probably composed of materials very similar to those of which our own earth is made up: and that is also only <b>an</b> <b>hypothesis.</b> But I need not tell you that there is an enormous difference in the value of the two hypotheses. That one which is based on sound scientific knowledge is sure to have a corresponding value; and that which is a mere hasty random guess is likely to have but little value. Every great step in our progress in discovering causes has been made in exactly the same way as that which I have detailed to you. A person observing the occurrence of certain facts and phenomena asks, naturally enough, what process, what kind of operation known to occur in Nature applied to the particular case, will unravel and explain the mystery? Hence you have the scientific hypothesis; and its value will be proportionate to the care and completeness with which its basis had been tested and verified. It is in these matters as in the commonest affairs of practical life: the guess of the fool will be folly, while the guess of the wise man will contain wisdom. In all cases, you see that the value of the result depends on the patience and faithfulness with which the investigator applies to his hypothesis every possible kind of verification.|$|R

5|$|Dawkins's meme {{refers to}} any {{cultural}} entity that an observer might consider a replicator {{of a certain}} idea or set of ideas. He hypothesised that people could view many cultural entities as capable of such replication, generally through communication and contact with humans, who have evolved as efficient (although not perfect) copiers of information and behaviour. Because memes are not always copied perfectly, they might become refined, combined, or otherwise modified with other ideas; this results in new memes, which may themselves prove more or less efficient replicators than their predecessors, thus providing a framework for <b>a</b> <b>hypothesis</b> of cultural evolution based on memes, a notion that {{is analogous to the}} theory of biological evolution based on genes.|$|E

5|$|One {{can solve}} these problems, {{according}} to Fodor, with functionalism, <b>a</b> <b>hypothesis</b> {{which was designed}} to overcome the failings of both dualism and reductionism. What is important is the function of a mental state regardless of the physical substrate which implements it. The foundation for this view lies in the principle of the multiple realizability of the mental.

On this basis functionalism can be classified as a form of token materialism.|$|E
5|$|Retrograde {{signaling}} is <b>a</b> <b>hypothesis</b> {{that attempts}} to explain that, while LTP is induced and expressed postsynaptically, some evidence {{suggests that it is}} expressed presynaptically as well. The hypothesis gets its name because normal synaptic transmission is directional and proceeds from the presynaptic to the postsynaptic cell. For induction to occur postsynaptically and be partially expressed presynaptically, a message must travel from the postsynaptic cell to the presynaptic cell in a retrograde (reverse) direction. Once there, the message presumably initiates a cascade of events that leads to a presynaptic component of expression, such as the increased probability of neurotransmitter vesicle release.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} {{induction}} discussed above {{is seen in}} another form in debates over the foundations of statistics.

If the p-value is too low, the hypothesis is rejected, in a way analogous to falsification. In contrast, Bayesian inference seeks to assign probabilities to hypotheses. Related topics in philosophy of statistics include probability interpretations, overfitting, and the difference between correlation and causation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} improving the accuracy of <b>an</b> <b>hypothesis</b> output by <b>a</b> learning algorithm in the distribution-free (PAC) learning model.

The concept class is weakly learnable if the learner can produce <b>an</b> <b>hypothesis</b> that performs only slightly better than random guessing. In this paper, it is shown that these two notions of learnability are equivalent. A method is described for converting a weak learning algorithm into one that achieves arbitrarily high accuracy. This construction may have practical applications as a tool for efficiently converting a mediocre learning algorithm into one that performs extremely well. In addition, the construction has some interesting theoretical consequences, including a set of general upper bounds on the complexity of any strong learning algorithm {{as a function of the}} allowed error e...|$|R
