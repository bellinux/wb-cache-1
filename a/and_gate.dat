5|$|According to the church's caretaker, Brenda Hiett, the church's {{roof and}} siding were {{installed}} around 1900. A wrought iron fence, made by Stewart Iron Works in Cincinnati, Ohio, was installed around the church's cemetery. Electrical conduits {{were added to}} the interior of the church when it was electrified around 1930, and further electrical updates were made in 2011. The church's perimeter foundation of concrete blocks replaced the original stone piers in the early 1970s, and its wide, heart pine plank floors were sanded and re-lacquered. Around 1990, the Stewart Iron Works fence <b>and</b> <b>gate</b> were restored by White’s Ornamental Ironworks.|$|E
5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of the Early Dynastic period III (earlier than 2500 BC), Mari was rebuilt and populated again. The new city kept many of the first city exterior features, including the internal rampart <b>and</b> <b>gate.</b> Also kept was the outer circular embankment measuring 1.9km in diameter, which was topped by a wall that is two meters thick, which is suitable for the protection of archers.|$|E
5|$|As a team, the Australians {{were greeted}} by record crowds <b>and</b> <b>gate</b> {{receipts}} across the country, even when wet weather curtailed the matches. The record attendance for a Test match in England was broken three times, in the Second Test at Lord's, the Third Test at Old Trafford, and the Fourth Test at Headingley. The 158,000 spectators that watched the proceedings at Headingley remain a record for a Test on English soil.|$|E

5|$|Built {{predominantly}} of Old Red Sandstone, {{the bridge}} {{was the subject of}} significant reconstruction and rebuilding in the 18th and 19th centuries. In those centuries, it also became a popular subject for artists; Turner, Gastineau and Cotman produced sketches of the bridge <b>and</b> <b>gate.</b> In the 20th century, it suffered increasing damage as higher volumes of traffic and the use of ever-larger vehicles led to several serious accidents. In the 21st century, {{the construction of a new}} road crossing to the south enabled the pedestrianisation of the bridge.|$|E

Among the foreign language films that have won Academy Awards outside the Best Foreign Language Film category, six have won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, <b>and</b> <b>Gate</b> of Hell was the recipient of an Academy Honorary Award.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, {{the greater}} {{volume of traffic}} using the humpbacked bridge, which had poor {{visibility}} and narrow approach roads, led to a rise in accidents {{and an increase in}} bypass proposals. Many similar bridge towers were completely demolished starting as early as the 18th century due to the desire of local authorities to clear carriageways of all obstructions to improve traffic flow. The bridge <b>and</b> <b>gate</b> were formally protected as an Ancient Monument in 1923, and proposals for a new road bridge began to be made about the same time. The new A40, built in 1965–6, relieved the town of much through traffic, and a town centre plan, prepared by the District Council in 1981, again proposed a new bridge. Repairs had to be undertaken in 1982 following a collision on 18 May in which a double-decker bus struck the bridge, resulting in its closure for a month. Damage to the bridge <b>and</b> <b>gate</b> through accidents continued, and in the early 1990s, two drivers were prosecuted after crossing the bridge with vehicles significantly exceeding the weight and height limits.|$|E
50|$|The Boolean circuit {{for small}} {{functions}} {{can be generated}} by hand. It is conventional to make the circuit out of 2-input XOR <b>and</b> <b>AND</b> <b>gates.</b> It {{is important that the}} generated circuit has the minimum number of <b>AND</b> <b>gates</b> (see Free XOR optimization). There are methods that generate the optimized circuit in term of number of <b>AND</b> <b>gates</b> using logic synthesis technique. The circuit for the Millionaires' Problem is a digital comparator circuit (which is a chain of full adder work as a subtractor and outputs the carry flag). The circuit of full adder can be implemented using only one <b>AND</b> <b>gates</b> <b>and</b> some XOR <b>gates.</b> This means the total number of <b>AND</b> <b>gates</b> for the circuit of the Millionaires' Problem is equal to the bit-width of inputs.|$|R

5|$|Just {{before the}} {{restoration}} of King Charles II to the throne in 1660, the Royalist Sir Peter Killigrew became the new captain of the castle. Fears of an invasion continued, and an additional gun battery was constructed at Crab Quay, to the south-east of the main fortification. At {{the end of the}} century, a new guard barracks <b>and</b> <b>gate</b> were constructed, probably emulating those being constructed in France.|$|E
5|$|Somerton {{was hit by}} four Luftwaffe {{bombs on}} the morning of 29 September 1942 during the Second World War. The bombs were aimed at the Cow <b>and</b> <b>Gate</b> milk factory and it was largely destroyed. Ten nearby houses were badly damaged. Nine people were killed and thirty seven injured. A {{memorial}} at the dairy site commemorates those killed. The factory later became a district council depot, and was recently bought by the town council for possible use as the site of a new town hall.|$|E
5|$|With a {{new home}} and First Division football, attendances were more than double those at the Manor Ground, and Arsenal's budget grew rapidly. Their {{location}} and record-breaking salary offer lured star Huddersfield Town manager Herbert Chapman in 1925. Over the next five years, Chapman built a new Arsenal. He appointed enduring new trainer Tom Whittaker, implemented Charlie Buchan's new twist on the nascent WM formation, captured young players like Cliff Bastin and Eddie Hapgood, and lavished Highbury's income on stars like David Jack and Alex James. With record-breaking spending <b>and</b> <b>gate</b> receipts, Arsenal quickly {{became known as the}} Bank of England club.|$|E
40|$|Alon and Boppana {{showed that}} if a {{monotone}} Boolean function f of n variables can be computed by a monotone circuit containing k <b>AND</b> <b>gates,</b> where k > 1, then {{it can also be}} computed using a monotone circuit containing k <b>AND</b> <b>gates</b> <b>and</b> O(k(n+k)) OR <b>gates.</b> They note that their result is tight up to a logarithmic factor. Here we show that under the same assumption the function f can be computed using a monotone circuit containing k <b>AND</b> <b>gates</b> <b>and</b> O(k(n + k) = log k) OR gates. This result is tight up to a constant factor. By duality the same result holds when the roles of the <b>AND</b> <b>and</b> OR <b>gates</b> are interchanged...|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} listed {{buildings}} {{are located in}} and around the town centre. Arguably the most significant is Crow Hall, a Grade II* listed building, is an early 18th-century sandstone and ashlar, one-room deep building at Crowhall Lane. The adjacent Crow Hall Cottage <b>and</b> <b>gate</b> piers are Grade II listed buildings. At Victoria Terrace stands Felling post office; a two-story course sandstone building with quoins and a Welsh slate roof. Close by is the Imperial Bingo Club, built as a dance hall in 1927 and converted to a bingo hall in 1930, at Victoria Square. Both are Grade II listed buildings. Also a Grade II listed building is Ardallan; the first house built at Holly-Hill field in Felling constructed of sandstone and with three sash windows. The gates, gate piers and walls are also Grade II listed. Almost immediately next door stands a house and shop at 35 Davison Street; another Grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|Bruce's {{early work}} {{involved}} advising clients and rebuilding existing houses, rather than designing new buildings from scratch. Panmure House and Leslie House (seat of the Earl of Rothes) had been projects of the king's master mason John Mylne. At Panmure, although Bruce has {{been credited with}} the design in the past, the works were overseen by Alexander Nisbet, although Bruce did design the gates <b>and</b> <b>gate</b> piers. At Leslie, Bruce oversaw the works after Mylne's death, and probably made his own amendments. Panmure was demolished in the 1950s, and {{only a small part}} of Leslie House remains standing, following a fire in the 18th century. Bruce later advised the Duke of Queensberry regarding his plans for Drumlanrig Castle.|$|E
5|$|Concourse D was {{constructed}} as a ground level commuter terminal for American Eagle with 15 ground level commuter aircraft parking spots <b>and</b> <b>gate</b> facilities. All American Eagle flights operated out of Concourse D until, as a cost-cutting measure after 9/11, all American Eagle flights {{were moved to}} Concourse C to share gates with American Airlines. For {{a short period of}} time, Concourse D was used by Corporate Airlines to operate its own regional flights until it became a regional affiliate with American Connection and Continental Connection, at which point the concourse was closed by the MNAA. Currently, plans exist to expand Concourse D with additional gates to increase capacity and attract new airlines, as well as provide new retail and dining offerings.|$|E

5|$|Stalinist {{officials}} allocated no {{funding for}} the design competition nor for the memorial, and the committee disbanded in 1948; by then many survivors had left the country. In 1949, the town of Sokołów Podlaski protected the camp with a new fence <b>and</b> <b>gate.</b> A work crew with no archaeological experience was sent in to landscape the grounds. In 1958, {{after the end of}} Stalinism in Poland, the Warsaw provincial council declared Treblinka to be a place of martyrology. Over the next four years, 127 hectares (318 acres) of land that had formed part of the camp was purchased from 192 farmers in the villages of Prostyń, Grądy, Wólka Okrąglik and Nowa Maliszewa.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Henry's expansion, StPeter ad Vincula, a Norman chapel which had {{previously}} stood outside the Tower, was incorporated into the castle. Henry decorated the chapel by adding glazed windows, and stalls {{for himself and his}} queen. It was rebuilt by EdwardI at a cost of over £300 and again by HenryVIII in 1519; the current building dates from this period, although the chapel was refurbished in the 19thcentury. Immediately west of Wakefield Tower, the Bloody Tower was built {{at the same time as}} the inner ward's curtain wall, and as a water-gate provided access to the castle from the River Thames. It was a simple structure, protected by a portcullis <b>and</b> <b>gate.</b> The Bloody Tower acquired its name in the 16thcentury, as it was believed to be the site of the murder of the Princes in the Tower. Between 1339 and 1341, a gatehouse was built into the curtain wall between Bell and Salt Towers. During the Tudor period, a range of buildings for the storage of munitions was built along the inside of the north inner ward. The castle buildings were remodelled during the Stuart period, mostly under the auspices of the Office of Ordnance. In 1663 just over £4,000 was spent building a new storehouse (now known as the New Armouries) in the inner ward. Construction of the Grand Storehouse north of the White Tower began in 1688, on the same site as the dilapidated Tudor range of storehouses; it was destroyed by fire in 1841. The Waterloo Block, a former barracks in the castellated Gothic Revival style with Domestic Tudor details, was built on the site and remains to this day, housing the Crown Jewels on the ground floor.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the minor}} league team that last held Jim Thorpe's {{contract}} had disbanded in 1910, {{he found himself}} in the rare position of being a sought-after free agent at the major league level during the era of the reserve clause, and thus had a choice of baseball teams for which to play. In January1913, he turned down a starting position with the American League cellar-dwelling St. Louis Browns, choosing instead to join the 1912National League champion New York Giants, who, with Thorpe playing in 19 of their 151games, would repeat as the 1913National League champions. Immediately following the Giants' October loss in the 1913 World Series, Thorpe and the Giants joined the Chicago White Sox for a world tour. Barnstorming across the United States and then around the world, Thorpe was the celebrity of the tour. Thorpe's presence increased the publicity, attendance <b>and</b> <b>gate</b> receipts for the tour. He met with Pope Pius X and Abbas II Hilmi Bey (the last Khedive of Egypt), and played before 20,000 people in London including King George V.|$|E

5|$|From 1889 to 1902, an {{extensive}} programme of conservation {{was carried out}} on the bridge <b>and</b> <b>gate,</b> directed by Monmouthshire County Council, which retained responsibility for maintenance. This began with the prevention of the potential collapse of the gatehouse by the insertion of metal tie rods to hold the two faces of the tower together; the four round plates {{at the ends of}} these two rods can still be seen. In 1892, conservation work began on the arches and piers of the bridge following the discovery that riverbed erosion had seriously undermined the piers. Maintenance was carried out on the gatehouse exterior from the mid-1890s to 1897. Roof guttering and downpipes were added, badly eroded stone was replaced with squared blocks of Old Red Sandstone, and the cruciform arrowslit on the left-hand side of the west elevation of the gatehouse was restored to make it symmetrical. Concluding the 1889–1902 renovations, improvements were made to the interior of the gatehouse, and it was opened to the public in 1902.|$|E
5|$|From {{the north}} of the hall are two further approaches. The Eccleston Approach goes to the village of Eccleston, and {{slightly}} to the west, the Chester Approach bypasses the village, going through Eccleston Hill. Associated with these approaches are further listed buildings. Of these, the major structure is Eccleston Hill Lodge which was designed in 1881–82 by Douglas for the 1stDuke and is listed at GradeII*. This is a three-storey gatehouse tower with multiple attached smaller towers and a steeply hipped roof. The other structures are listed at GradeII and comprise Eccleston Lodge which was designed by Douglas and Fordham in 1894, its associated gates, piers and wing railings, a sandstone balustered causeway south of the lodge carrying the drive, a house called Eaton Boat, designed by Douglas about 1880, Garden Lodge designed by Waterhouse in 1881–83, a pair of gates, railings and screen walls adjoining the lodge dating from 1881–83 by Waterhouse, Stud Lodge storehouse and domestic offices, designed in 1883 by Douglas, the Stud Riding School, the Stud Stables, the house east of Stud, Eaton Estate Office, designed by Waterhouse in 1880, the North Lodge of 1881 by Waterhouse, the North Lodge gate and post from about 1881 also by Waterhouse, the Garden House of 1893 by Douglas and Minshull, and gates <b>and</b> <b>gate</b> piers to the south of Garden House.|$|E
5|$|In 1928 Constantine {{had signed}} an initial three-year {{contract}} with Nelson, {{to play in}} the Lancashire League. The contract was worth £500 per season, plus performance bonuses and travelling expenses. He remained there until 1937, an unusually long time for a professional to remain with one club. Constantine's appearances boosted attendances <b>and</b> <b>gate</b> receipts for all Nelson's matches, and was of great financial benefit to both the club and the League as a whole. In Constantine's nine seasons at the club, Nelson never finished lower than second, won the league competition seven times and the knockout cup twice. In 1931 Constantine renewed his contract for £650 per season; when in 1935 a rival league attempted to sign him, all the Lancashire League clubs contributed to his wage, which rose to £750 per year between 1935 and 1937. This was far more than the then maximum wage for a professional footballer of £386, or the £500 per season that a top county cricketer could potentially earn, and possibly made Constantine the best-paid sportsman in the country. Consequently, he and his family enjoyed a good standard of living {{for the first time in}} their lives.|$|E
