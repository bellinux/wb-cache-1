50|$|The <b>Appeals</b> <b>Chamber</b> {{rejected}} Martić’s {{argument that}} the Trial Chamber erred in failing {{to take into account}} relevant contextual factors, in particular, the political objectives of the Serb leadership. The <b>Appeals</b> <b>Chamber</b> granted the Prosecution’s sole ground of appeal in which it claimed that the Trial Chamber erred in law when it found that persons hors de combat, i.e., soldiers who are incapable of taking part in the hostilities (for example because injured or detained), could not be victims of crimes against humanity. The <b>Appeals</b> <b>Chamber</b> concluded that the reversals on appeal did not warrant a reduction in sentence. On 8 October 2008 the <b>Appeals</b> <b>chamber</b> upheld the Trial Chamber’s ruling. In June 2009 he was transferred to Tartu Vangla prison in Estonia serve out his sentence.|$|R
50|$|On {{his initial}} {{appearance}} before the court in October 2001 {{he was charged with}} two counts of crimes against humanity. The indictment against him was, however, amended pending his second appearance on 25 November 2003. The amended indictment accuses him of committing genocide against Tutsis between April and July 1994 in Kigali and Gisenyi. Trial Chamber III composed of Judges Inés Mónica Weinberg de Roca, Khalida Rachid Khan and Lee Gacuiga Muthoga, on Thursday 18 December 2008, convicted Protais Zigiranyirazo of genocide and extermination as a crime against humanity and sentenced him to 20 years imprisonment. Credit was given to him for time spent in prison. The verdict was overturned by the <b>Appeal</b> <b>chamber</b> of the ICTR who acquitted him of all charges on 16 November 2009, ordering the immediate release of Mr Zigiranyirazo and citing that the court has made serious errors in the initial judgement.|$|E
5000|$|The ICC's first trial, of Congolese militia leader Thomas Lubanga, was {{suspended}} on 13 June 2008 {{when the court}} ruled that the Prosecutor's refusal to disclose potentially exculpatory material had breached Lubanga's right to a fair trial. The prosecutor had obtained the evidence from the United Nations and other sources on the condition of confidentiality, but the judges ruled that the prosecutor had incorrectly applied the relevant provision of the Rome Statute and, as a consequence, [...] "the trial process has been ruptured {{to such a degree that}} it is now impossible to piece together the constituent elements of a fair trial". On 2 July 2008, the court ordered Lubanga's release, on the grounds that [...] "a fair trial of the accused is impossible, and the entire justification for his detention has been removed", but an <b>Appeal</b> <b>Chamber</b> agreed to keep him in custody while the prosecutor appealed.|$|E

In 2007 a trial chamber of the SCSL found that forced marriage was a crime against humanity, and the <b>appeal</b> <b>chamber</b> upheld this judgement in 2008 stating, [...] "forced marriage is a distinct, inhumane act of sufficient gravity to be considered a crime against humanity" [...] The prosecutor of the SCSL charged, Brima Bazzy Kamara, Alex Tamba Brima and Santigie Borbor Kanu, who were leaders of the AFRC, with counts of sexual slavery, forced marriages, and other forms of sexual violence committed by the men under their command.|$|E

5000|$|Touranchaeu and July appealed {{this ruling}} on December 23, 1997. Again, their {{argument}} stayed the same, claiming Article 38 (1) of the Act of 1881 was incompatible with Article 10(2)of the Convention. It was decided on June 24, 1998 by the Correctional <b>Appeal</b> <b>Chamber</b> of the Paris Court of Appeals that Article 38 “can {{not in itself}} be regarded as incompatible with the principle laid down in Article 10(2)of the Convention.” [...] ) Furthermore, the ruling stated that publishing indictments and all acts of criminal or correctional procedure before they have been read in open court is necessary in a democratic society, which is specifically discussed in Article 10(2)of the Convention. Specifically, the reputation of others and the guarantee of the authority an impartiality of the judiciary are being targeted here as being upheld in the ruling. The Court of Appeals of France upheld the verdict on the conviction but reversed the sentence, ordering the applicants to pay a suspended fine of 10,000 Francs, respectively.|$|E
50|$|On February 11, 2014 he {{was acquitted}} of all other charges of {{committing}} genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes though the judges of the <b>Appeal</b> <b>Chamber</b> later {{found that it was}} very doubtful that gendarmes were ever involved at Kansi Parish. The ICTR trial judgment recognised Ndindiliyimana's “consistent support for the Arusha Accords and a peaceful resolution of the conflict between the Rwandan government forces and the Patriotic Front RPF his opposition to the massacres in Rwanda. {{and the fact that he}} had saved the lives of many Tutsis. The Tribunal also held that his arrest and indictment appeared to be politically motivated. He was sentenced to time served since his arrest eleven years prior to the judgment. The ICTR ordered his release but Ndindiliyimana was unable to return to his home in Belgium and was forced to stay in a UN safe house in Arusha, Tanzania. In late September, 2014 the Belgian government permitted his return to Belgium to rejoin his family after almost 15 years in detention in Tanzania.|$|E

By 18 November 2008, the Prosecutor had agreed to make all the confidential information available to the court, so the Trial Chamber reversed its decision and ordered that the trial could go ahead. The Prosecutor was widely criticised for his actions, but the court was also praised for its [...] "determination to ensure fairness to the defence".|$|E
50|$|The <b>Appeals</b> <b>Chamber</b> {{decision}} was a 3-2 majority decision {{that found that}} the prosecution had failed to prove {{the existence of a}} joint criminal enterprise and the Trial Chamber failed to identify and discuss other modes of responsibility thus not allowing the <b>Appeals</b> <b>Chamber</b> to enter convictions under command responsibility or aiding and abbetting.|$|R

40|$|Prague <b>Appeal</b> <b>Chamber</b> (niem. Appellationsgericht, czes. Apelačni soud) {{was brought}} into being by an {{instruction}} of Ferdinand I in January 1548.

It dealt mainly with civil and criminal cases or advised in lawsuits. It may suggest, that from Silesian town courts there were mostly sent documents of cases concerning those matters.

40|$|Purpose – This article aims {{to provide}} an inicial {{analysis}} of the regulation process in the current Brazilian tax environment. It also intends to investigate whether those tax administrative regulations have their guidelines extracted from a legal-procedural theory {{that allows them to}} be clear, simple and trusty on their rulemaking process. Methodology/approach/design – The text adopts as methodological approach the regulatory administrative procedure that is actually applied by Brazil’s Revenue Service (Portuguese acronym: SRF), Foreign Trade Chamber (Portuguese acronym: Camex), National Committee on Revenue Policy (Portuguese acronym: Confaz), and Revenue <b>Appeal</b> <b>Chamber</b> (Portuguese acronym: Carf), considered the regulatory influence and the economic consequences that they entail. As a guideline to this text, some theoretical assumptions needs to be made on public choice and public interest theories, based on Steven P. Croley criticism, and on legal analysis of economic policy developed by Marcus Faro de Castro. Findings – Debates on proposed reforms of Brazil’s tax system have brought about concerns related to excessive amount of regulations, leading to lack of perception of safety, clarity and confidence in the national legal environment. Practical implications – It provides basic guidelines to developing a regulatory rulemaking process focused on taxation. Originality/value – This article fosters the debate on the Brazilian tax system simplification, transparency, and publicity, focusing on regulatory rulemaking process and on social participating at the discussion agenda about tax public policies and regulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{negotiated}} procedure without {{publication of a}} contract notice is a special procedure for awarding public procurement contracts which departs from the obligation imposed on contracting authorities of respecting the freedoms of the internal market and rules of competition. The procedure may be applied in exceptional situations of extreme urgency resulting from an event {{which could not be}} foreseen. The current judicature of the Court of Justice of the EU provides interpretations of the legal basis for application of the procedure in specific cases. However, it does not address the issue of whether it is possible to regard improper performance of contractual obligations as unpredictable. It does not provide broader considerations concerning the form of regulations on the procedure of awarding public interest contracts either. These issues were subject to analysis in one of the resolutions of the National <b>Appeal</b> <b>Chamber</b> (KIO) – the Polish authority issuing decisions in matters related to public procurement contracts. In resolution KIO/KD 58 / 10 of 6 August 2010, KIO assessed the correctness of the application of the {{negotiated procedure}} for changing the contractor of the Municipal Stadium in Wrocław {{in the run-up to the}} 2012 European Football Championships. KIO found that the significant delay in construction of the facility was unpredictably exceptional, and significantly threatened the timeliness of commissioning the facility, which resulted in termination of the agreement by the contracting authority. The resolution also included an assessment allowing for the position that such a situation was exceptional due to the scale of the threat to the public interest, including the commercial interest of the contracting authority, stemming from a lack of immediate performance of the contract if it resulted in disproportionate consequences for a specific community. The issue of acceptance of such an interpretation by EU institutions remains unresolved...|$|E
