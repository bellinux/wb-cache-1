5|$|The 26 rongorongo texts with letter {{codes are}} inscribed on wooden objects, each with between 2 and 2320 simple glyphs and {{components}} of compound glyphs, for over 15,000 in all. The objects are mostly oblong wooden tablets, with the exceptions of I, a possibly sacred chieftain's staff {{known as the}} Santiago Staff; J and L, inscribed on reimiro pectoral ornaments worn by the elite; X, inscribed on various parts of a tangata manu ("birdman") statuette; and Y, a European snuff box assembled from sections cut from a rongorongo tablet. The tablets, like the pectorals, statuettes, and staves, were works of art <b>and</b> <b>valued</b> possessions, and were apparently given individual proper names {{in the same manner}} as jade ornaments in New Zealand. Two of the tablets, C and S, have a documented pre-missionary provenance, though others may be as old or older. There are in addition a few isolated glyphs or short sequences which might prove to be rongorongo.|$|E

5|$|Tree {{of heaven}} {{is a popular}} {{ornamental}} tree in China <b>and</b> <b>valued</b> for its tolerance of difficult growing conditions. It was once very popular in cultivation in both Europe and North America, but this popularity dropped, especially in the United States, due to the disagreeable odor of its blossoms and the weediness of its habit. The problem of odor was previously avoided by only selling pistillate plants since only males produce the smell, but a higher seed production also results. Michael Dirr, a noted American horticulturalist and professor at the University of Georgia, reported meeting, in 1982, a grower who could not find any buyers. He further writes (his emphasis): In Europe, however, the tree is still used in the garden to some degree as its habit is generally not as invasive {{as it is in}} America. In the United Kingdom it is especially common in London squares, streets, and parks, though it is also frequently found in gardens of southern England and East Anglia. It becomes rare in the north, occurring only infrequently in southern Scotland. It is also rare in Ireland. In Germany the tree is commonly planted in gardens. The tree has furthermore become unpopular in cultivation in the west because it is short-lived and that the trunk soon becomes hollow, making trees more than two feet in diameter unstable in high winds.|$|E

40|$|A path {{model was}} {{developed}} to test hypothesized associations among financial satisfaction, harsh start-up, shared goals <b>and</b> <b>values,</b> <b>and</b> relationship satisfaction. It was noted that a partner’s perceived financial satisfaction was directly associated with engaging less in harsh start-up discussions and sharing goals <b>and</b> <b>values</b> with the other partner. Harsh start-up discussions were directly associated with having fewer shared goals <b>and</b> <b>values</b> <b>and</b> decreased relationship satisfaction. The association between financial satisfaction and relationship satisfaction in the model was mediated by harsh start-up and shared goals <b>and</b> <b>values.</b> Implications for both practitioners and researchers are discussed...|$|R

25|$|Karau et al.'s {{concluded}} that social loafing occurred {{because there was}} usually a stronger perceived contingency between individual effort <b>and</b> <b>valued</b> outcomes when working individually. When working collectively, other factors frequently determine performance, <b>and</b> <b>valued</b> outcomes are also divided among all group members. All individuals are assumed to try to maximize the expected utility of their actions. The CEM also acknowledges that some valued outcomes do not depend on performance. For example, exerting strong effort when working on intrinsically meaningful tasks or with highly respected team members may result in self-satisfaction or approval from the group, even if the high effort had little to no impact on tangible performance outcomes.|$|E

40|$|Many {{organizational}} {{scholars and}} theorists {{have speculated that}} leaders play {{a prominent role in}} the creation of their organization’s culture. Through a variety of mechanisms, leaders are thought to transfer or embed their personality <b>and</b> <b>values</b> into their organizations. This study addresses the relationship between the personality <b>and</b> <b>values</b> of leaders <b>and</b> the personality <b>and</b> <b>values</b> of individuals whose selection they influenced, their organization’s structural characteristics, and their organization’s culture. The top executive leader from each of 32 organizations, along with 467 employee participants from these organizations completed personality, <b>values</b> <b>and</b> culture inventories. Results provide empirical support for assumptions by Schein (1992) and Schneider (1987). Leader personality <b>and</b> <b>values</b> profiles were related to profiles of personality <b>and</b> <b>values</b> shared by organizational members. Additionally, specific leaders personality <b>and</b> <b>values</b> scores were predictive of organizational culture values.
