5|$|James Lewis {{argues that}} {{scientific}} themes <b>are</b> <b>so</b> prevalent in The Satanic Bible because LaVey was {{appealing to the}} authority of science to legitimize Satanism as a religion.|$|E
5|$|Since {{treatment}} options for relapsed AML <b>are</b> <b>so</b> limited, palliative care or enrollment {{in a clinical}} trial may be offered.|$|E

I shall {{think of it}} when you are gone. I shall {{remember}} how naughty I <b>was.</b> It <b>was</b> <b>so</b> wicked, so very, very wicked; and he <b>was</b> <b>so</b> good.' ...|$|R
60|$|But it <b>was</b> <b>so</b> {{easy to do}} wrong. There <b>were</b> <b>so</b> many {{wrong things}} to do, and the doing of them <b>was</b> <b>so</b> natural.|$|R
5|$|A brewer by trade, Lassell {{began making}} mirrors for his amateur {{telescope}} in 1820. When John Herschel received news of Neptune's discovery, {{he wrote to}} Lassell suggesting he search for possible moons. Lassell did so and discovered Triton eight days later. Lassell also claimed to have discovered rings. Although Neptune was later confirmed to have rings, they <b>are</b> <b>so</b> faint and dark that {{it is doubtful that}} he actually saw them.|$|E
5|$|Although Nepenthes rajah is {{most famous}} for {{trapping}} and digesting animals, its pitchers are also host {{to a large}} number of other organisms, which are thought to form a mutually beneficial (symbiotic) association with the plant. Many of these animals <b>are</b> <b>so</b> specialised that they cannot survive anywhere else, and are referred to as nepenthebionts. N. rajah has two such mosquito taxa named after it: Culex rajah and Toxorhynchites rajah.|$|E
5|$|California condors {{have the}} largest {{wingspan}} of any North American bird. They are surpassed in both body length and weight only by the trumpeter swan and the introduced mute swan. The American white pelican and whooping crane also have longer bodies than the condor. Condors <b>are</b> <b>so</b> large {{that they can be}} mistaken for a small, distant airplane, which possibly occurs more often than they are mistaken for other species of bird.|$|E
6000|$|... "He used to <b>be</b> <b>so</b> nice;--and <b>is</b> <b>so</b> still, I believe, {{only that}} he has taught himself to <b>be</b> <b>so</b> rough. Will he ever change, do you think?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! dear Mrs. Merrifield, I <b>am</b> <b>so</b> grieved, and <b>so</b> <b>is</b> Arthurine. We {{were told}} that the Admiral <b>was</b> <b>so</b> {{excessively}} angry, and he <b>is</b> <b>so</b> kind. I could not bear for him to think Arthurine meant anything personal.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Pardon me. The {{expression}} of your sisterly interest <b>is</b> <b>so</b> beautiful - Tom should <b>be</b> <b>so</b> {{proud of it}} - I know this is inexcusable, but I <b>am</b> <b>so</b> compelled to admire.' ...|$|R
5|$|Developed {{over many}} centuries, Krak√≥w {{provides}} a showcase setting for many historic styles of architecture. As the city expanded, so too did the architectural achievements of its builders. It {{is for this}} reason that the variations in style and urban planning <b>are</b> <b>so</b> easily recognisable.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, the kabuki theater {{tradition}} in Japan employs ritualized representations of {{violence on the}} stage. While kabuki is technically theater and not dance, the movements, for example, of the sword-fighting termed tachimawari in kabuki are gymnastic to the point even of employing somersaults, and elaborate fight scenes <b>are</b> <b>so</b> deliberate and stylized that they provide at least an area of overlap between theater and dance.|$|E
5|$|Fur-bearing trout are fictional {{creatures that}} are purportedly found in Arkansas, {{northern}} North America, and Iceland. The basic claim (or tall tale) {{is that the}} waters of lakes and rivers in the area <b>are</b> <b>so</b> cold that they evolved a thick coat of fur to maintain their body heat. Another theory {{says that it is}} due to four jugs - or two bottles - of hair tonic being spilled into the Arkansas River.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have <b>been</b> <b>so</b> occupied, Adela. There <b>is</b> <b>so</b> {{much to do}} {{in taking}} up a parish. Even though I know all the people so well, there has <b>been</b> <b>so</b> much to do." ...|$|R

5|$|I {{might have}} adduced for this same purpose the {{differences}} between the races of man, which <b>are</b> <b>so</b> strongly marked; I may add that some little light can apparently be thrown on the origin of these differences, chiefly through sexual selection of a particular kind, but without here entering on copious details my reasoning would appear frivolous.|$|E
5|$|In Vietnam and Ghana, {{among other}} places, whales hold {{a sense of}} divinity. They <b>are</b> <b>so</b> {{respected}} in their cultures that they occasionally hold funerals for beached whales, a throwback to Vietnam's ancient sea-based Austro-Asiatic culture. The god of the seas, according to Chinese folklore, was a large whale with human limbs.|$|E
5|$|John Ratzenberger and Kathy Najimy as John and Mary, respectively. John and Mary both {{live on the}} Axiom and <b>are</b> <b>so</b> {{dependent}} on their personal video screens and automatic services that they are oblivious to their surroundings, for instance not noticing that the ship features a giant swimming pool. However, they are brought out of their trances after separate encounters with WALL-E, eventually meeting face-to-face for the first time.|$|E
6000|$|... "Both <b>were</b> <b>so</b> wrapped up, and {{the night}} <b>was</b> <b>so</b> dark, and we <b>were</b> all <b>so</b> reserved, that I cannot {{undertake}} to say even that." ...|$|R

5|$|Josh Weinstein {{has said}} that there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> many sleazy {{characters}} in The Simpsons that {{it was easy to}} find people for the scenes in the burlesque house. A character modeled after John Swartzwelder can also be seen. Belle was not modeled after anyone in particular and she was redesigned several times. Belle was voiced by Tress MacNeille but there had been previous efforts to cast a guest voice for the role.|$|E
5|$|Marmalard {{and other}} Omegas lure Otter to a motel {{and beat him}} up, believing that Otter is {{having an affair with}} Marmalard's girlfriend, Mandy. The Deltas' midterm grades <b>are</b> <b>so</b> poor that an ecstatic Wormer expels them all, having already {{notified}} their local draft boards that they are now eligible for military service. The news shocks Flounder so badly that he vomits on Wormer.|$|E
5|$|Most {{academic}} sources {{maintain that}} the associations made between world events and Nostradamus's quatrains are largely the result of misinterpretations or mistranslations (sometimes deliberate) or else <b>are</b> <b>so</b> vague as to render them useless as evidence of any genuine predictive power.|$|E
6000|$|... "It <b>is</b> <b>so</b> {{beautiful}}," [...] she said, {{looking at}} the glowing, beautiful land. It <b>was</b> <b>so</b> beautiful, so perfect, and so unsullied.|$|R

5|$|Neptunium {{is found}} {{in at least three}} allotropes. Some claims of a fourth allotrope have been made, but they <b>are</b> <b>so</b> far not proven. This {{multiplicity}} of allotropes is common among the actinides. The crystal structures of neptunium, protactinium, uranium, and plutonium do not have clear analogs among the lanthanides and are more {{similar to those of the}} 3dtransition metals.|$|E
5|$|Squamous-cell {{carcinoma}} {{accounts for}} about 30% of lung cancers. They typically occur close to large airways. A hollow cavity and associated cell death are commonly found {{at the center of}} the tumor. About 9% of lung cancers are large-cell carcinoma. These <b>are</b> <b>so</b> named because the cancer cells are large, with excess cytoplasm, large nuclei and conspicuous nucleoli.|$|E
5|$|The {{addition}} of a multiplayer mode to Jedi Knight was met positively, but questions arose to why there <b>are</b> <b>so</b> few multiplayer maps and why single-player maps cannot {{be used in the}} multiplayer mode. Tom Chick of IGN believes this was corrected with the release of Mysteries of the Sith.|$|E
