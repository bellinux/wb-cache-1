5|$|For {{the second}} stage, the organisers {{had made the}} option to {{postpone}} the start by two hours, in case the mistral wind was making cycling difficult. This was not necessary, so the riders started at midnight <b>as</b> <b>planned.</b>|$|E
5|$|The TSO board sent {{other musicians}} {{in place of}} the six who had been denied visas, and the concert went on <b>as</b> <b>planned.</b> The orchestra's {{performance}} was a success and received positive reviews from both the American and Canadian press. After the TSO returned to Canada, the six musicians resumed their positions.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the First World War in August 1914 saw {{the bulk of the}} changes put to the test; the Expeditionary Force was quickly sent to the Continent, whilst the Territorial Force and Reserves were mobilised <b>as</b> <b>planned</b> to provide a second line.|$|E

5|$|While it {{was never}} as {{successful}} <b>as</b> <b>planned,</b> Brookwood Cemetery remains the largest cemetery in the United Kingdom {{and one of the}} largest in the world. Although not the world's only dedicated funeral railway line, the London Necropolis Railway was the first, the longest lasting and by far the best known.|$|E
5|$|A battle {{certainly}} ensued {{although there}} are naturally two accounts as to what actually took place. According to the Burmese chronicles, the Burmese command fielded an army led by Thado Dhamma Yaza, the Viceroy of Prome, as a decoy and the two armies lurked on the flanks in order to encircle any overstretched Siamese forces. <b>As</b> <b>planned,</b> the Siamese vanguard troops pressed on Thado Dhamma Yaza's army, allowing Bayinnaung's army waiting on the left flank to encircle the Siamese forces, which subsequently were wiped out. Tabinshwehti's army on the right flank drove back the remaining Siamese forces into the city.|$|E
5|$|After filming {{two songs}} in the districts of Krabi and Pattaya in Bangkok, the film's unit {{returned}} to Hyderabad on 2 December 2011 for completing patch work. The film's shooting was wrapped up on 10 December 2011 in 74 working days as expected. Jagannadh revealed {{in an interview that}} the film's length by the end of shoot was 84,000 feet <b>as</b> <b>planned.</b> He added that Mahesh and Kajal participated in the film's shoot for 65 and 30 days respectively.|$|E

5|$|Although {{not officially}} announced, the {{original}} backup crew consisted of Fred W. Haise (CDR), William R. Pogue (CMP) and Gerald P. Carr (LMP), who were targeted for the prime crew assignment on Apollo 19. However, after the cancellations of Apollos 18 and 19 were finalized in September 1970 this crew would not rotate to a lunar mission <b>as</b> <b>planned.</b> Subsequently, Roosa and Mitchell were recycled {{to serve as}} members of the backup crew after returning from Apollo 14, while Pogue and Carr were reassigned to the Skylab program where they flew on Skylab 4.|$|E
5|$|Angel {{gives up}} {{his share of}} the gold to Pike in return for sending one crate of rifles and {{ammunition}} to a band of rebels opposed to Mapache. The holdup goes largely <b>as</b> <b>planned</b> until Deke's posse turns up on the train the gang has robbed. The posse chases them to the Mexican border, only to be foiled again as the robbers blow up a trestle spanning the Rio Grande, dumping the entire posse into the river. The pursuers temporarily regroup at a riverside camp and then quickly take off again after the Bunch.|$|E
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>planned,</b> the {{exposition}} {{left behind}} a fairground and numerous public buildings and public works; some credit it with revitalizing Seattle's economic and cultural life (see History of Seattle since 1940). The fair saw {{the construction of the}} Space Needle and Alweg monorail, as well as several sports venues (Washington State Coliseum, now KeyArena) and performing arts buildings (the Playhouse, now the Cornish Playhouse), most of which have since been replaced or heavily remodeled.|$|E

5|$|Central Independent Television had {{confidence}} in the project, so rather than the show being shot at their studios in Nottingham <b>as</b> <b>planned,</b> they granted Richmond a £2 million budget. This enabled it to be shot on 16 mm film, rather than the regular, less expensive videotape, and on location, making it very expensive compared with most children's television. These high production costs almost led to its cancellation {{at the end of}} the second series, by which time Central executive Lewis Rudd was unable to commission programmes by himself.|$|E
5|$|Charlotte Shaw's mother {{subsequently}} sued Edgehill College and {{the teacher}} leading the expedition for negligence. The judgement given on 28 June 2012 found that the teacher had given clear instructions that the group should not attempt to cross Walla Brook but should instead go round it. It further found that the intervention of a passerby, who suggested that the group could cross the brook, had meant that the school could not {{be held responsible for}} the accident. It said that the failure of two teachers to meet up with the group <b>as</b> <b>planned</b> was not incompetence. The judge therefore rejected the claim.|$|E
5|$|Delays {{in finding}} the funding, {{opposition}} from the two mainline companies that the line was intended to connect, and World War I, led {{to the start of}} construction work being delayed until 1927. The line was completed and opened in January 1930, although the planned extension of the DR was not implemented and the service was provided by the Southern Railway. The opening of the line stimulated residential development <b>as</b> <b>planned,</b> but competition from the London Underground's City and South London Railway, which had its terminus at Morden, meant that the line did not achieve the hoped-for passenger numbers.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the death}} of Queen Mary on 24 March, the {{coronation}} on 2 June 1953 went ahead <b>as</b> <b>planned,</b> as Mary had asked before she died. The ceremony in Westminster Abbey, {{with the exception of}} the anointing and communion, was televised for the first time. Elizabeth's coronation gown was embroidered on her instructions with the floral emblems of Commonwealth countries: English Tudor rose; Scots thistle; Welsh leek; Irish shamrock; Australian wattle; Canadian maple leaf; New Zealand silver fern; South African protea; lotus flowers for India and Ceylon; and Pakistan's wheat, cotton, and jute.|$|E

5|$|I will confess {{up front}} that I love Anonymous, {{but not because}} I think they're the heroes. Like Alan Moore's {{character}} V who inspired Anonymous to adopt the Guy Fawkes mask as an icon and fashion item, you're never quite sure if Anonymous is the hero or antihero. The trickster is attracted to change {{and the need for}} change, and that's where Anonymous goes. But they are not your personal army – that's Rule 44 – yes, there are rules. And when they do something, it never goes quite <b>as</b> <b>planned.</b> The internet has no neat endings.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, President Kennedy asked MacArthur to help mediate {{a dispute}} between the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the Amateur Athletic Union over control of amateur sports in the country.
