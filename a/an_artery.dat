5|$|If OHS is suspected, various {{tests are}} {{required}} for its confirmation. The most important initial test is the demonstration of elevated {{carbon dioxide in the}} blood. This requires an arterial blood gas determination, which involves taking a blood sample from <b>an</b> <b>artery,</b> usually the radial artery. Given that it would be complicated to perform this test on every patient with sleep-related breathing problems, some suggest that measuring bicarbonate levels in normal (venous) blood would be a reasonable screening test. If this is elevated (27mmol/l or higher), blood gasses should be measured.|$|E

5|$|The {{cause of}} trigeminal neuralgia, {{in which one}} side of the face is exquisitely painful, is thought to be {{compression}} of the nerve by <b>an</b> <b>artery</b> as the nerve emerges from the brain stem.

5|$|Arterial blood gas {{measurement}} is usually performed {{to demonstrate the}} acidosis; this requires taking a blood sample from <b>an</b> <b>artery.</b> Subsequent measurements (to ensure treatment is effective), may be taken from a normal blood test taken from a vein, as there is little difference between the arterial and the venous pH. Ketones {{can be measured in}} the urine (acetoacetate) and blood (β-hydroxybutyrate). When compared with urine acetoacetate testing, capillary blood β-hydroxybutyrate determination can reduce the need of admission, shorten the duration of hospital admission and potentially reduce the costs of hospital care. At very high levels, capillary blood ketone measurement becomes imprecise.|$|E
5|$|Decompression {{sickness}} (DCS) {{occurs when}} gas, {{which has been}} breathed under high pressure and dissolved into the body tissues, forms bubbles as the pressure is reduced on ascent from a dive. The results may range from pain in the joints where the bubbles form to blockage of <b>an</b> <b>artery</b> leading to damage to the nervous system, paralysis or death. While bubbles can form anywhere in the body, DCS is most frequently observed in the shoulders, elbows, knees, and ankles. Joint pain occurs in about 90% of DCS cases reported to the U.S. Navy, with neurological symptoms and skin manifestations each present in 10% to 15% of cases. Pulmonary DCS is very rare in divers. The table below classifies the effects by affected organ and bubble location.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from Cornell, Chamberlin {{was hired by}} the University of Utah, where he worked from 1904 to 1908, as an assistant professor (19041905) then full professor. He soon began improving biology courses, which at the time were only of high school grade, to collegiate standards, and introduced new courses in vertebrate histology and embryology. He was the first dean of University of Utah School of Medicine, serving from 1905 to 1907. During the summer of 1906, his plans to teach a summer course in embryology at the University of Chicago were cancelled when he suffered a serious accident in a fall, breaking two leg bones and severing <b>an</b> <b>artery</b> in his leg. In 1907, University officials decided to merge the medical school into an existing department, which made Chamberlin's deanship obsolete. He resigned as dean in May, 1907, although remained a faculty member. The medical students strongly objected, crediting the school's gains {{over the past few years}} largely to his efforts.|$|E

5|$|The Kurma Purana goes on {{to state}} that after the {{encounter}} with the sages of the Deodar Forest, Bhikshatana continued to wander, visiting various countries of gods and demons before he finally reached the abode of the god Vishnu. Vishnu's gatekeeper Vishvaksena did not allow him to enter. Angered, Bhikshatana slew Vishvaksena and impaled the corpse on his trident, which added to his sin. This form of Shiva with a corpse on his trident is called Kankala-murti ("One with the skeleton"). Bhikshatana, now as Kankala-murti, entered Vishnu's abode and begged for food. Vishnu offered his own blood as food in one version. In another version, Vishnu cut <b>an</b> <b>artery</b> on Bhikshatana's forehead; a stream of blood spurts into his begging bowl as his food. Vishnu then directed Bhikshatana to visit the sacred city of Varanasi, where his sin would be expiated. The encounter with Vishnu's gatekeeper is also retold with some variation in the Vamana Purana and the Matsya Purana.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere in town, {{a trio of}} {{teenagers}} drink beer and huff fumes generated from heated manure. One of them sees a roach crawl into an open wound on his wrist, and {{in an attempt to}} extricate the insect, he begins to frantically slice his skin with a razor, leading him to sever <b>an</b> <b>artery</b> and ultimately bleed to death. At the scene, Mulder talks over the phone with Scully, who explains that it is likely a case of drug-induced delusional parasitosis, though Mulder finds a cockroach on the underside of a piece of furniture, indicating that roaches were at least present. When he attempts to capture it for analysis, the insect crumbles in his hand and the sharp pieces cut his fingers in the process, leading him to believe that the brittle casing was made of metal. Sheriff Frass purports that the government, under the guise of the USDA, has been breeding killer cockroaches in a nearby facility. Immediately afterwards, the medical examiner is found dead in a bathroom stall, initially covered with cockroaches that disappear from the scene before more than one person can witness them. Scully attributes the medical examiner's death to a cerebral aneurysm induced by overstraining while defecating. Mulder and Sheriff Frass find a seemingly dead cockroach on a sink in the bathroom, and Mulder again attempts to capture it (albeit more gingerly this time), but it proves to be alive and escapes down the drain.|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesThis study {{sought to}} {{determine}} angiographic and clinical outcomes among patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) presenting with isolated anterior ST-segment depression on 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG). BackgroundIn patients with ACS, anterior ST-segment depression on 12 -lead ECG may represent plaque rupture with: 1) acute thrombotic occlusion with elevation of cardiac biomarkers (+Tn); 2) <b>a</b> patent <b>artery</b> with +Tn; or 3) <b>a</b> patent <b>artery</b> with –Tn. MethodsThe TRITON–TIMI 38 (Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition with Prasugrel–Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 38) enrolled 13, 608 ACS patients. Those with isolated anterior (leads V 1 to V 4) ST-segment depression were analyzed. Angiograms and ECGs were interpreted by local investigators. ResultsThere were 1, 198 (8. 8 %) patients with isolated anterior ST-segment depression. Of those, 314 (26. 2 %) had <b>an</b> occluded culprit <b>artery</b> (TIMI flow grade 0 / 1) and +Tn, 641 (53. 5 %) had <b>a</b> patent culprit <b>artery</b> (TIMI flow grade 2 / 3) and +Tn, and 243 (20. 3 %) had TIMI flow grade 2 / 3 and –Tn. Among patients with <b>an</b> occluded <b>artery,</b> the culprit artery was most often the left circumflex artery (48. 4 %). The 30 -day incidence of the composite of death and MI was significantly higher among patients with <b>an</b> occluded <b>artery</b> (8. 6 %) than among those with <b>a</b> patent culprit <b>artery</b> and either +Tn (6. 3 %) or –Tn (2. 9 %) (3 -way p = 0. 006). Among patients with <b>an</b> occluded <b>artery,</b> the median time from ECG to percutaneous coronary intervention was 29. 4 h (interquartile range 26. 1 to 44. 1 h).
