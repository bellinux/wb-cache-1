40|$|SUMMARY. -Nucleic <b>acid</b> <b>extracts</b> from transplantable carcinomas Vx 7 and Vx 2, long {{maintained}} in domestic rabbits, were assayed {{for their ability}} to produce papillomas in animals of this kind. The Vx 7 had been serially transferred 111 times when this was attempted and Vx 2 was in its 203 rd generation. The nucleic <b>acid</b> <b>extracts</b> from the Vx 7 carcinomas consistently yielded papillomas whereas those from Vx 2 completely failed to do so. The tumorigenicity of the Vx 7 extracts was slight and regression of the induced papillomas often took place, as happens not infrequently to the growths caused by nucleic <b>acid</b> <b>extracts</b> obtained directly from papillomas. Malignant conversion, a common event in tumors induced by Shope papilloma virus, was also observed to occur among papillomas which were induced by the nucleic <b>acid</b> <b>extracts</b> from Vx 7 carcinomas, and which kept persisting over a year on the skin of experimental animals.

40|$|Abstract Background {{fatty acids}} are {{considered}} to be effective components to promote wound healing and Lucilia sericata larvae are applied clinically to treat intractable wounds. We aimed to investigat the effect of fatty <b>acid</b> <b>extracts</b> from dried Lucilia sericata larvae on murine cutaneuous wound healing as well as angiogenesis. Results On day 7 and 10 after murine acute excision wounds creation, the percent wound contraction of fatty <b>acid</b> <b>extracts</b> group was higher than that of vaseline group. On day 3, 7 and 10 after wounds creation, the wound healing quality of fatty <b>acid</b> <b>extracts</b> group was better than that of vaseline group on terms of granulation formation and collagen organization. On day 3 after wounds creation, the micro vessel density and vascular endothelial growth factor expression of fatty <b>acid</b> <b>extracts</b> group were higher than that of vaseline group. Component analysis of the fatty <b>acid</b> <b>extracts</b> by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry showed there were 10 kinds of fatty acids in total and the ratio of saturated fatty acid, monounsaturated fatty acid and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) was: 20. 57 %: 60. 32 %: 19. 11 %. Conclusions Fatty <b>acid</b> <b>extracts</b> from dried Lucilia sericata larvae, four fifths of which are unsaturated fatty acids, can promote murine cutaneous wound healing probably resulting from the powerful angiogenic activity of the extracts. </p...|$|R

40|$|Sickle cell Disease (SCD) is {{a health}} public problem in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The aim {{the present study}} was to {{evaluate}} both the antisickling and antibacterial activities of Garcinia punctata and Tetradenia riparia and the modes of antisickling action of organic <b>acids</b> <b>extracted</b> from the two selected plants. Results revealed that the erythrocytes (RBCs) normalization rates were > 75 % for all plant extracts. While the rates of sickle RBCs hemolysis inhibition were 64 and 57 % respectively for organic <b>acids</b> <b>extracted</b> from G. punctata and T. riparia. Organic <b>acids</b> <b>extract</b> displayed also an increase in osmotic fragility of sickle RBCs, an inhibition of the polymerization of hemoglobin S into tactoids (anti-gelling effect) and an inhibition/reduction of MetHb S formation in aqueous solution. Anthocyanins and organic <b>acids</b> <b>extracts</b> displayed also interesting antibacterial activities. E coli ATCC 25 922 was the most sensitive strain towards anthocyanins and organic <b>acids</b> <b>extracts</b> of G. punctata and T. riparia (MIC = MBC = 31. 25 µg/ml). On the other hand, the anthocyanin extracts of these two plant species displayed bacteriostatic effect towards Staphylococcus strains.

40|$|The natural {{abundance}} of stable carbon isotopes measured in bacterial nucleic <b>acids</b> <b>extracted</b> from estuarine bacterial concentrates {{was used to}} trace sources of organic matter for bacteria in aquatic environments. The stable carbon isotope ratios of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and nucleic <b>acids</b> <b>extracted</b> from cultures resembled those of the carbon source on which bacteria were grown. The carbon isotope discrimination between the substrate and total cell carbon from bacterial cultures averaged 2. 3 % +/- 0. 6 % (n = 13). Furthermore, the isotope discrimination between the substrate and nucleic <b>acids</b> <b>extracted</b> from bacterial cultures was 2. 4 % +/- 0. 4 % (n = 10), {{not significantly different from}} the discrimination between bacteria and the substrate. Estuarine water samples were prefiltered through 1 -micron-pore-size cartridge filters. Bacterium-sized particles in the filtrates were concentrated with tangential-flow filtration and centrifugation, and nucleic <b>acids</b> were then <b>extracted</b> from these concentrates. Hybridization with 16 S rRNA probes showed that approximately 90 % of the nucleic <b>acids</b> <b>extracted</b> on two sample dates were of eubacterial origin. Bacteria and nucleic acids from incubation experiments using estuarine water samples enriched with dissolved organic matter from Spartina alterniflora and Cyclotella caspia had stable carbon isotope values {{similar to those of the}} substrate sources.
