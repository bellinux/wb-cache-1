40|$|Very recently, {{interferometric}} {{methods have}} been proposed to measure the full statistics of work performed on a driven quantum system [Dorner et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 110 230601 (2013) ] and [Mazzola et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 110 230602 (2013) ]. The advantage of such schemes is that they replace the necessity to make projective measurements by performing phase estimation on an appropriately coupled ancilla qubit. These proposals are one possible route to the tangible <b>experimental</b> <b>exploration</b> of quantum thermodynamics, a subject which is the centre of much current attention due to the current control of mesoscopic quantum systems.
