5|$|Kermes {{is a red}} dye {{from the}} dried bodies of the females of a scale insect in the genus Kermes, {{primarily}} Kermes vermilio. Kermes are native to the Mediterranean region, living on the sap of the Kermes oak. They were used as a red dye by the ancient Greeks and Romans. The kermes dye is a rich red, and has good colour fastness in silk <b>and</b> <b>wool.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{species are}} used as dyes.Hydnellum caeruleum, used in North America and Scandinavia to dye silk <b>and</b> <b>wool,</b> {{produces}} {{a range of colors}} including tan, blue, and forest-green, depending on the mordant that is used. Hydnellum packii produces gray, brown, and olive colors. Hydnuferrugin and hydnuferruginin are pigments responsible for the coloration of H. ferrugineum and H. zonatum. Geogenin is a yellow pigment found in H. geogenium.|$|E

In Rotterdam, the ships docked at the Willemsplein; in London, the ships docked at the Customs House <b>and</b> <b>Wool</b> Quays near the Tower Bridge. The Batavier Line service between Rotterdam and London was offered daily except Sundays, with each ship making multiple round trips per week.|$|E
5|$|Forts Monroe <b>and</b> <b>Wool</b> {{gave the}} Union forces {{control of the}} {{entrance}} to Hampton Roads. The blockade, initiated on April 30, 1861, cut off Norfolk and Richmond from the sea almost completely. To further the blockade, the Union Navy stationed {{some of its most}} powerful warships in the roadstead. There, they were under the shelter of the shore-based guns of Fort Monroe and the batteries at Hampton and Newport News and out of the range of the guns at Sewell's Point and Craney Island. For most of {{the first year of the}} war, the Confederacy could do little to oppose or dislodge them.|$|E

50|$|Back Porch Records is an Americana/roots rock label {{owned by}} Universal Music Group. The label {{was started in}} 1997 as joint venture between Virgin Records and Milwaukee-based Narada Productions. The labels initial releases, {{including}} the popular I-10 Chronicles compilations, were produced by Virgin Records executives Ken Peterson <b>and</b> John <b>Wooler.</b> Roughly three years after launch of the labels, Peterson <b>and</b> <b>Wooler</b> left Virgin Records and the label became a full-time concern for Narada.|$|R

5|$|Home to Aboriginal {{groups for}} over 40,000 years, the Riverina was {{originally}} settled by Europeans in {{the mid-19th century}} as a pastoral region providing beef <b>and</b> <b>wool</b> to markets in Australia and beyond. In the 20th century, the development of major irrigation areas in the Murray and Murrumbidgee valleys {{has led to the}} introduction of crops such as rice and wine grapes. The Riverina has strong cultural ties to Victoria, and the region was the source of much of the impetus behind the federation of Australian colonies.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, {{there were}} 32 soap {{factories}} and 400 looms exporting their products throughout the Middle East. Nablus exported three-fourths of its soap — the city's most important commodity — to Cairo by caravan through Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula, and by sea through the ports of Jaffa and Gaza. From Egypt, and particularly from Cairo and Damietta, Nablus merchants imported mainly rice, sugar, and spices, {{as well as}} linen, cotton, <b>and</b> <b>wool</b> textiles. Cotton, soap, olive oil, and textiles were exported by Nablus merchants to Damascus, whence silks, high-quality textiles, copper, and a number luxury items, such as jewellery were imported.|$|E
5|$|In 1975, Richard Bulliet of Columbia University {{wrote that}} the {{dromedary}} exists in large numbers in areas from which the Bactrian camel has disappeared; the converse is also true to a great extent. He said this substitution could have taken place because of the heavy dependence on the milk, meat <b>and</b> <b>wool</b> of the dromedary by Syrian and Arabian nomads, while the Asiatic people domesticated the Bactrian camel but {{did not have to}} depend upon its products.|$|E

5|$|In Ethiopia, {{there are}} several {{varieties}} of sheep landrace. Attempts {{have been made to}} classify the sheep based on factors such as tail shape <b>and</b> <b>wool</b> type, and H. Epstein made an attempt at classifying them this way by dividing the breeds into 14 types based on those two factors. However, in 2002, further genetic analysis revealed that there are only four distinct varieties of Ethiopian sheep: short-fat-tailed, long-fat-tailed, fat-rumped, and thin-tailed.|$|E
5|$|Midshipman Jonathon Monkhouse {{proposed}} fothering the ship, as he {{had previously}} been on a merchant ship which used the technique successfully. He was entrusted with supervising the task, sewing bits of oakum <b>and</b> <b>wool</b> into an old sail, which was then drawn under the ship to allow water pressure to force it into {{the hole in the}} hull. The effort succeeded and soon very little water was entering, allowing the crew to stop two of the three pumps.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} diversities of bovids {{occur in}} Africa. The maximum concentration of species {{is in the}} savannas of eastern Africa. Other bovid species also occur in Europe, Asia, and North America. Bovidae includes {{three of the five}} domesticated mammals whose use has spread outside their original ranges, namely cattle, sheep, and goats. Dairy products such as milk, butter, and cheese are manufactured largely from domestic cattle. Bovids also provide leather, meat, <b>and</b> <b>wool.</b>|$|E

5|$|The high {{concentration}} and more sedentary nature of shepherding in the UK allowed sheep especially adapted to their particular purpose and region to be raised, thereby {{giving rise to}} an exceptional variety of breeds {{in relation to the}} land mass of the country. This greater variety of breeds also produced a valuable variety of products to compete with the superfine wool of Spanish sheep. By the time of Elizabeth I's rule, sheep <b>and</b> <b>wool</b> trade was the primary source of tax revenue to the Crown of England and the country was a major influence in the development and spread of sheep husbandry.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{observers}} noted smoke {{coming from the}} vicinity of No. 3 turret and the aircraft area just forward of it, just before the explosion. Compared with other nations' warships in wartime service, Japanese battleships contained {{a large amount of}} flammable materials including wooden decking, furniture, and insulation, as well as cotton <b>and</b> <b>wool</b> bedding. Although she had been modernized in the 1930s, some of the Mutsus original electrical wiring may have remained in use. While fire in the secure magazines was a very remote possibility, a fire in an area adjacent to the No. 3 magazine could have raised the temperature to a level sufficient to ignite the highly sensitive black-powder primers stored in the magazine and thus cause the explosion.|$|E
5|$|Bowie renounced his American {{citizenship}} {{and became a}} Mexican citizen on September 30, 1830, after promising to establish textile mills {{in the state of}} Coahuila y Tejas. To fulfill his promise, Bowie entered into partnership with Veramendi to build cotton <b>and</b> <b>wool</b> mills in Saltillo. With his citizenship assured, Bowie now had the right to buy up to 11leagues of public land. He convinced 14 or 15 other citizens to apply for land in order to turn it over to him, giving him 700,000acres (280,000ha) for speculation. Bowie may have been the first to induce settlers to apply for empresario grants, which could then be sold in bulk to speculators as Bowie had. The Mexican government passed laws in 1834 and 1835 that stopped much of the land speculation.|$|E

40|$|The {{insulation}} {{in buildings}} is very important. Insulation {{used in the}} building is largely divided into organic and inorganic insulation by its insulation material. Organic insulation materials which are made of Styrofoam or polyurethane are extremely vulnerable to fire. On the other hand, inorganic insulation such as mineral <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> glass <b>wool</b> is very weak with moisture, while it is nonflammable, so that its usage is very limited. Therefore, this study developed moisture resistance applicable to mineral <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> glass <b>wool</b> <b>and</b> measured the thermal conductivity of the samples which are exposed to moisture by exposing the product coated with moisture resistance and without moisture resistance to moisture and evaluated how the moisture affects thermal conductivity by applying this to inorganic insulation...|$|R
