25|$|The {{government}} {{plans to}} reorganise its subsidy system, {{which is a}} heavy burden on government finances. In the short term these subsidies are helping to ease the burden but they cannot keep rising indefinitely, <b>and</b> <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later</b> the load {{will have to be}} shared out. In the short term, national consumption per capita is expected to rise from the current level of 0.4 tonnes of oil equivalent (toe) to as much as 0.90 toe in 2030, a good indication of development, but a massive challenge as well. The input of renewable energy is a matter of particular importance.|$|E
500|$|I've {{heard it}} said about The Velvet Underground that while {{not a lot}} of people bought their albums, {{everyone}} who did started a band. I think this is largely true about the Pixies as well. Charles' secret weapon turned out to be not so secret <b>and,</b> <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later,</b> all sorts of bands were exploiting the same strategy of wide dynamics. It became a kind of new pop formula and, within a short while, [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] was charging up the charts and even the members of Nirvana said later that it sounded for all the world like a Pixies song.|$|E
500|$|Under Bruce the Australian {{government}} also moved {{to its new}} permanent home in the planned federal city of Canberra. Plans for a new federal capital had been circulated {{since the time of}} Federation, and a site on the Molonglo River was selected in 1913. Design and construction had proceeded slowly due to World War I as well as funding and management problems. Bruce was a committed advocate of the new capital, however, stating: [...] "For the purposes of Federation it was essential that there should be some central point of nationhood, suitable to Australia as a nation... <b>and</b> <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later</b> {{there would have to be}} a national capital, overriding State boundaries and State prejudices." [...] This came to pass on 9 May 1927 when the Federal Parliament moved to its new premises in Canberra; Bruce had moved himself and his wife to The Lodge a few days earlier. At the Federal Parliament's opening ceremony, Bruce decided that voices of the clerks of the House of Representatives and the Senate were too heavily accented, and determined that he would personally welcome the Duke of York and co-open the new building a move that was criticised by several parliamentarians. The business of transferring government and cabinet operations to the new capital proceeded slowly over 1927 and 1928. This was an administrative task that occupied a significant proportion of the government's time in those years, with many departments only very gradually transferring from Melbourne, much to Bruce's consternation.|$|E

2500|$|Underwood was a {{first-class}} bowler from his teens, {{and he took}} his 100th Test wicket and 1,000th first-class wicket in 1971, aged only 25. Only George Lohmann and Wilfred Rhodes had secured a thousand wickets {{at an earlier age}} than Underwood. He used to say that bowling was a 'low mentality profession: plug away, line and length, until there's a mistake', <b>and</b> <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later</b> every batsman would make a mistake. He would finish his Test career with 297 wickets, and {{had it not been for}} his involvement in World Series Cricket and the rebel tour to South Africa, there is little doubt he would have had more than 300 Test wickets.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{his time}} as an NSA analyst, {{directing}} the work of others, Snowden recalled a moment {{when he and his}} colleagues began to have severe ethical doubts. Snowden said 18 to 22-year-old analysts were suddenly [...] "thrust into a position of extraordinary responsibility, where they now have access to all your private records. In the course of their daily work, they stumble across something that is completely unrelated in any sort of necessary sense—for example, an intimate nude photo of someone in a sexually compromising situation. But they're extremely attractive. So what do they do? They turn around in their chair and they show a co-worker ... <b>and</b> <b>sooner</b> <b>or</b> <b>later</b> this person's whole life has been seen by all of these other people."
