The additional costs associated with long-term effects of child abuse <b>and</b> <b>neglect</b> make the prevention of child abuse <b>and</b> <b>neglect</b> a priority. More importantly, the prevention of child abuse <b>and</b> <b>neglect</b> is a critical priority because of the social costs of child abuse <b>and</b> <b>neglect</b> <b>and</b> the imperative to prevent children from experiencing its devastating effects.

5|$|Anna Schwartz {{collaborated with}} Friedman to produce one of monetarism's major works, A Monetary History of the United States (1963), which linked money {{supply to the}} {{business}} cycle. The Keynesians of the 1950s and 60s had adopted the view that monetary policy does not impact aggregate output or the business cycle based on evidence that, during the Great Depression, interest rates had been extremely low but output remained depressed. Friedman and Schwartz argued that Keynesians only looked at nominal rates <b>and</b> <b>neglected</b> the role inflation plays in real interest rates, which had been high {{during much of the}} Depression. In real terms, monetary policy had effectively been contractionary, putting downward pressure on output and employment, even though economists looking only at nominal rates thought monetary policy had been stimulative.|$|E

The purpose of this resource is to indicate the potential long-term effects of child abuse <b>and</b> <b>neglect</b> that may extend into adulthood. Child abuse <b>and</b> <b>neglect</b> refers to any behaviour by parents, caregivers, other adults or older adolescents that is outside the norms of conduct and entails a substantial risk of causing physical or emotional harm to a child or young person. Such behaviours may be intentional or unintentional and can include acts of omission (i. e., <b>neglect)</b> <b>and</b> commission (i. e., abuse). The five main subtypes of child abuse <b>and</b> <b>neglect</b> are physical abuse, emotional maltreatment, <b>neglect,</b> sexual abuse <b>and</b> witnessing family violence...|$|R

The Natchez reacted to this slight by killing four French traders. Cadillac sent his lieutenant Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville to punish the Natchez. He deceived the Natchez leaders by inviting them to attend a parley, where he ambushed and captured them, and forced the Natchez to exchange their leaders for the culprits who had attacked the French. A number of random Natchez from the pro-British villages were executed. This caused French–Natchez relations to further deteriorate. As part {{of the terms of}} the peace accord following this First Natchez War, the Natchez promised to supply labor and materials {{for the construction of a}} fort for the French. The fort was named Fort Rosalie, and it was aimed at protecting the French trade monopoly in the region from British incursions.|$|E
5|$|The {{offensive}} was {{the only}} unsuccessful operation undertaken by the HV since Operation Winter '94 in November 1994, and was brushed aside in Croatia as an aberration. It still remained a subject of controversy in the Croatian media. According to Croatian historian Davor Marijan, the operation was primarily politically motivated and hastily launched in response to Holbrooke's remarks of 17 September. Nonetheless, Marijan claims that the attack was based on incorrect intelligence, leading to an underestimation of the VRS defenses by the HV. In addition, the HV overestimated its own capacity to execute a difficult operation, <b>and</b> <b>neglected</b> {{the condition of the}} rivers that they intended to cross. The HV never attempted to repeat the crossing, instead choosing to threaten Banja Luka from a different direction in early October in Operation Southern Move.|$|E
5|$|The pass {{was formed}} by glacial action and erosion in the region, and its first {{recorded}} sighting was by Zebulon Pike in 1806. Ferdinand Hayden surveyed it in 1873. As part of the Continental Divide, it was the limit of European settlement in the region at the time, with the land to the west reserved for the Ute people. Prospectors who defied governor Frederick Walker Pitkin's order crossed the pass on July 4, 1879, giving it its current name and setting up a similarly named village (now a ghost town) to its west. A toll road built across the pass was abandoned <b>and</b> <b>neglected</b> after a railroad connection was made to Aspen. A new road replaced it in the 1920s; portions of the old route can still be seen along the western approach.

The bunker largely survived, although some areas were partially flooded. In December 1947, the Soviets tried to blow up the bunker, but only the separation walls were damaged. In 1959, the East German government began a series of demolitions of the Chancellery, including the bunker. Because it was near the Berlin Wall, the site was undeveloped <b>and</b> <b>neglected</b> until 1988–89. During extensive construction of residential housing and other buildings on the site, work crews uncovered several underground sections of the old bunker complex; for the most part these were destroyed.

5|$|When George Clifford died in 1605, {{his wife}} Margaret became dowager countess and began {{repairing}} Brougham Castle, which became her favoured residence.

Her daughter, Lady Anne Clifford continued {{the restoration of the}} castle and other Clifford properties. The only one of Margaret's three children to survive childhood, Anne inherited the Clifford estates after her mother died in 1616. The inheritance was not without incident. The Earl of Cumberland again asserted his claim to the Clifford estates, however the privy council found in favour of Anne. The solution was only temporary, and in April 1617 the king decided that the Earl of Cumberland was the rightful heir, and the Clifford estates passed to Francis Clifford. Later the same year, JamesI visited Scotland and on his return journey he stayed at the castles of Carlisle, Brougham, and Appleby, where expensive banquets were given in his honour. It is estimated that the festivities cost around £1,200. After this, Brougham was almost forgotten by its owner <b>and</b> <b>neglected.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background: Elder abuse <b>and</b> <b>neglect</b> (EAN) {{comprises}} emotional, financial, physical, <b>and</b> sexual abuse, <b>neglect</b> {{by other}} individuals, and self-neglect. Elder abuse <b>and</b> <b>neglect</b> in seniors with psychiatric morbidity was not monitored in the Czech Republic at all, despite the literature shows mental morbidity {{as one of}} the important risk factor for developing elder abuse <b>and</b> <b>neglect.</b> Methods: We designed comparative cross sectional study comprising 305 seniors hospitalized in Mental Hospital Kromeriz in June 2011 - group of 202 seniors hospitalized due to mental disorder in psychogeriatric ward and group of 103 seniors hospitalized due to somatic disorder in internal ward. Content analysis of medical records was done in both groups of seniors, with regards to symptoms of elder abuse. Then, we discussed the topic of elder abuse with 30 nurses of psychogeriatric ward in focus group interview. Results: Between two compared groups of seniors we detected statistically higher prevalence of elder abuse in seniors with psychiatric morbidity (48 cases, 23. 8 % prevalence of EAN), compared to somatically ill seniors (3 cases, 2. 9 %). As for nursing staff, 5 from 30 nurses (16. 7 %) have never heard about symptoms of elder abuse <b>and</b> <b>neglect,</b> 10 from 30 nurses (33. 3 %) had just a partial knowledge about elder abuse <b>and</b> <b>neglect</b> <b>and</b> its symptoms, the rest of nurses (15 from 30 nurses, 50. 0 %) had good knowledge about elder abuse <b>and</b> <b>neglect</b> <b>and</b> its symptoms. Conclusion: Elder abuse <b>and</b> <b>neglect</b> seems to be a relevant problem in senior population with mental disorders. Development of educational programs for nursing and medical staff about Elder abuse <b>and</b> <b>neglect</b> (symptoms of EAN, early detection of EAN, knowledge how to report cases of EAN) could improve the situation and help mentally ill seniors to better quality of life...|$|R

40|$|This article {{reviews and}} {{critically}} discusses {{the relevance of}} animal data to research on child abuse <b>and</b> <b>neglect.</b> Although parental investment theory {{can be useful in}} investigating the adaptiveness, if any, of child abuse <b>and</b> <b>neglect,</b> the evolutionary approach also has some limitations. The most suitable animal models for investigating the psychosocial processes underlying child abuse <b>and</b> <b>neglect</b> are probably found among the nonhuman primates. Whereas the heuristic value of social deprivation paradigms may be limited, recent studies suggest that the spontaneous occurrence of infant maltreatment in monkeys may be the closest approximation to child maltreatment provided by nonhuman animals. The investigation of adaptive and maladaptive processes in the parenting behavior of socially living nonhuman primates can inform research on child abuse <b>and</b> <b>neglect</b> <b>and</b> allow investigators to conduct studies that would be difficult or impossible in humans.
