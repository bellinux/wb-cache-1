5|$|An <b>argument</b> <b>has</b> been {{advanced}} that Gediminas had two wives, one pagan {{and another}} Orthodox. This case is supported {{only by the}} Jüngere Hochmeisterchronik, a late 15th-century chronicle, mentioning Narimantas as half-brother to Algirdas. Other historians support this claim by arguing this would explain Gediminas' otherwise mysterious designation of a middle son, Jaunutis, as his succession would be understandable if Jaunutis were the first-born son of Gediminas and a second wife.|$|E
5|$|In recent years, {{this latter}} <b>argument</b> <b>has</b> been {{fortified}} by {{the theory of}} connectionism. Many connectionist models of the brain have been developed in which the processes of language learning {{and other forms of}} representation are highly distributed and parallel. This would tend to indicate that {{there is no need for}} such discrete and semantically endowed entities as beliefs and desires.|$|E
5|$|More recently, in 2002, Alfred Smyth {{has argued}} that the Life is a forgery by Byrhtferth, basing his case {{primarily}} on an analysis of Byrhtferth's and Asser's Latin vocabulary. Byrhtferth's motive, according to Smyth, is to lend Alfred's prestige to the Benedictine monastic reform movement of the late tenth century. However, the <b>argument</b> <b>has</b> not been found persuasive, and few historians harbour doubts about {{the authenticity of the}} work.|$|E
25|$|<b>Arguments</b> <b>have</b> {{been made}} asserting {{that members of}} certain {{historically}} disadvantaged minority groups are not obliged to pay taxes. Such <b>arguments</b> <b>have</b> been made, and rejected, with respect to African Americans, Native Americans, and native Hawaiians. Similar <b>arguments</b> <b>have</b> been made in countries other than the United States. For example, such an argument was rejected {{in the case of}} a Māori citizen seeking to avoid payment of taxes in New Zealand.|$|R

5|$|Archaeoastronomy uses {{a variety}} of methods to uncover {{evidence}} of past practices including archaeology, anthropology, astronomy, statistics and probability, and history. Because these methods are diverse and use data from such different sources, integrating them into a coherent <b>argument</b> <b>has</b> been a long-term difficulty for archaeoastronomers. Archaeoastronomy fills complementary niches in landscape archaeology and cognitive archaeology. Material evidence and its connection to the sky can reveal how a wider landscape can be integrated into beliefs about the cycles of nature, such as Mayan astronomy and its relationship with agriculture. Other examples which have brought together ideas of cognition and landscape include studies of the cosmic order embedded in the roads of settlements.|$|E
5|$|Hilda Ellis Davidson counts Þorgerðr and Irpa as {{examples}} of guardian goddesses in Germanic paganism, and compares their roles {{to that of the}} dísir and valkyries. Davidson says that if Helgi is the mythical founder of Hålogaland, it would explain Þorgerðr's last name ("bride of Helgi") and that, subsequently, she would be the wife of each ruler of the kingdom in turn. Substantially the same <b>argument</b> <b>has</b> been advanced by McKinnell. Davidson compares this role to accounts of kings or leaders being granted entry into Valhalla in the Viking Age, that the idea of a guardian goddess welcoming kings was essentially an aristocratic concept, and that a tradition such as this could explain noble valkyries welcoming dead kings into the after life, using the poem Hákonarmál as an example.|$|E
5|$|Supporters of the {{original}} doctrine of privity {{say that it is}} reasonable not to allow third parties to enforce contracts, arguing that to allow them to do so would hamper the rights of {{the original}} parties in relation to amending or terminating contracts. Another argument put forward is that the doctrine was deliberately retained by judges to protect consumers from exclusion clauses designed to protect third party manufacturers from liability. The general view of academics, however, is that no legal <b>argument</b> <b>has</b> yet been advanced as to why the original doctrine should be good law. Patrick Atiyah argues that the doctrine came from a time of rising trade through middlemen, and was designed to simplify commercial transactions and encourage enterprise liability.|$|E

5|$|Another {{argument}} for sociality {{is based on}} the healed injuries in several Smilodon fossils, which would suggest that the animals needed others to provide it food. This <b>argument</b> <b>has</b> been questioned, as cats can recover quickly from even severe bone damage and an injured Smilodon could survive if it had access to water. The brain of Smilodon was relatively small compared to other cat species. Some researchers have argued that Smilodons brain would have been too small for it to have been a social animal. An analysis of brain size in living big cats found no correlation between brain size and sociality. Another argument against Smilodon being social is that being an ambush hunter in closed habitat would likely have made group-living unnecessary, as in most modern cats. Yet it has also been proposed that being the largest predator in an environment comparable to the savanna of Africa, Smilodon may have had a social structure similar to modern lions, which possibly live in groups primarily to defend optimal territory from other lions (lions are the only social big cats today).|$|E
5|$|Christian apologist and philosopher Alvin Plantinga, a {{supporter}} of intelligent design, has formalized and revised the improbability argument as the evolutionary argument against naturalism, which asserts that it is irrational to reject a supernatural, intelligent creator because the apparent probability of certain faculties evolving is so low. Specifically, Plantinga claims that evolution cannot account for the rise of reliable reasoning faculties. Plantinga argues that whereas a God {{would be expected to}} create beings with reliable reasoning faculties, evolution would be just as likely to lead to unreliable ones, meaning that if evolution is true, it is irrational to trust whatever reasoning one relies on to conclude that it is true. This novel epistemological <b>argument</b> <b>has</b> been criticized similarly to other probabilistic design arguments. It has also been argued that rationality, if conducive to survival, {{is more likely to be}} selected for than irrationality, making the natural development of reliable cognitive faculties more likely than unreliable ones.|$|E
