The scheme attempted to turn a productive marsh-based peasant economy into an <b>arable</b> <b>system,</b> but {{the way in which it}} was financed resulted in much of the reclaimed land being owned by Vermuyden and his adventurers, the Crown, or existing landowners. Many local people lost their livelihoods, as the common land was reduced from between 3000 and 4000 acre to just 1814 acre. Although reclaimed arable land was offered back to local people for rent, they were stock farmers, and the meadow land and winter fodder were gone. There was widespread unrest throughout the area, particularly as the initial drainage was less than effective, resulting in flooding in both summer and winter, without the benefits of fertilising the soil. Winter fowling and fishing activity was reduced, although 100 acre of land were eventually awarded to the people of Crowle in compensation for the loss of fisheries. Parts of Crowle were leased to Vermuyden in 1636 by Charles I, based on the original contract under which he got to own one third of the improved lands, but making a profit from the land holdings proved to be very difficult, and he quickly sold the land to the Earl of Pembroke and Montgomery and to Sir Richard Pye.|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} assess {{long-term}} effects on productivity, environmental impacts and soil fertility of contrasting farming practices, six cropping systems, ranging from conventional arable without livestock to organic mixed dairy farming with few arable crops, have been compared since 1989 on a loam soil. A decline in soil structure quality {{was found in a}} conventional <b>arable</b> <b>system</b> with annual ploughing with no rotational grass. This system had higher bulk density and mean aggregate size than other systems, and lower levels of plant available water and aggregate stability. Opposite trends were related to the proportion of grass leys in the other systems and to their levels of soil organic matter. The latter declined markedly over 15 years in the conventional <b>arable</b> <b>system,</b> and there were smaller declines in most other systems. In an <b>arable</b> <b>system</b> without ploughing, but with rotary tillage in spring, organic matter was maintained and high structural stability was found. This system had high bulk density, but the proportion of small aggregates equalled that found in systems with ley. There were overall increases in earthworm density (84...|$|E

The aim of the SoilEffects project is to identify potential risks and benefits for soil fertility when animal manure is anaerobically digested for biogas production. The field experiment was established on Tingvoll research farm in 2011. A biogas plant was built at this farm in 2010, to digest the manure from a herd of about 25 organically managed dairy cows. This report {{describes the}} initial characterization of the soil biology, chemistry and physics, along with {{the background of the}} project, the selection process of the research field and the project design. Effects of the manure treatment and application will be studied during 2011 - 14. The aim of this report is to function as a reference for later publications, and to inform other scientists establishing medium long-term field trials. Except from a few results on water-soluble C and soil microbiology from 2011, all results presented here are based on studies conducted in autumn 2010 or spring 2011, before any manure was applied. Effects of the experimental treatments were studied for different soil characteristics in 2011, 2012 and 2013 and will be presented in separate publications. The field experiment has two cropping systems; grass (perennial grass-clover ley) with 20 experimental plots, and arable with 20 plots. Each experimental plot measures 3 m x 8 m. The ley was established in 2009 with cereals as a cover crop. The <b>arable</b> <b>system</b> was established in 2011, by ploughing a part of this ley. In the <b>arable</b> <b>system,</b> the soil is ploughed annually in spring, no legumes are grown, and aboveground plant material is removed at harvest. This practice is intended to stress the maintenance of soil organic matter in the <b>arable</b> <b>system,</b> to possibly reveal clearer effects of the experimental treatments. Within each cropping system, five experimental treatments are compared. They comprise two fertilization levels for each type of manure, plus a control treatment with no manure application. Each treatment has four replicates, randomly distributed within four blocks in each system. There is a significant soil variation on the experimental field. However, for most of the studied characteristics, no statistically valid differences were found between average values across blocks within each cropping system. The content of soil organic matter (SOM) is higher in the grass system than the <b>arable</b> <b>system.</b> In the upper soil layer (0 - 20 cm) the average SOM content measured by ignition loss was 11. 3 % in the grass and 6. 6 % in the <b>arable</b> <b>system.</b> Analyzed by total-C measurements, the corresponding SOM values were 11. 03 % and 5. 97 %. In Norwegian soil, SOM values between 3 and 6 % are regarded as high humus contents (“moldrik”), whereas values between 6 and 12 % are regarded as very high. The average values for total C (0 - 20 cm) were 6. 41 in the grass and 3. 47 % in the <b>arable</b> <b>system,</b> and for total-N 0. 39 and 0. 21 %. On average for all treatments in the grass system (n= 20), the upper soil layer contained 0. 32 mg organic C per g soil (air dried) by extraction in cold water (CWEC), increasing to 1. 7 mg by hot water extraction (HWEC). In the <b>arable</b> <b>system,</b> the corresponding values were 0. 23 and 1. 1 mg. The SOM content of the grass system was higher and more variable than that of the <b>arable</b> <b>system,</b> and differences between blocks were greater and more statistically significant in the grass than in the <b>arable</b> <b>system.</b> Differences in the initial SOM between the means of plots that have been assigned to different subsequent treatments of manure applications were on the whole much smaller than those between blocks within the same crop system. Nevertheless, significant differences were found in some cases, and thus the initial SOM status of the soil should be taken into account when interpreting differences that may arise after the treatments have been carried out for a number of years. The soil texture, loamy sand (‘siltig mellomsand’) was similar in all replicate blocks and both depths in the grass system. It was slightly heavier and somewhat more variable in the <b>arable</b> <b>system,</b> with on average 16 % less sand, 11 % more silt and 4 % more clay. Somewhat heavier soil in the deeper parts of the terrain may be explained by washing out the soil layer during postglacial land elevation. The gravel contents were fairly low ( 6 mm. There was little variation between blocks in the aggregate size distribution. The stability of soil aggregates (2 - 6 and 6 - 10 mm) to simulated rainfall was high (> 85 %) in all cases, with little variation between blocks or treatment means. The soil nutrient content was comparable in the two cropping systems. The nutrient concentrations in the upper soil layer (0 - 20 cm) were P-AL 2. 87 / 2. 31; K-AL 5. 25 / 5. 24; Mg-AL 4. 34 / 3. 53; Ca-AL 107. 6 / 80. 7; K-HNO 3 122. 4 / 175 mg of nutrient 100 g- 1 dry soil in the grass/arable system. The pH value (H 2 O) was 5. 82 / 5. 87. The accumulated soil respiration and the microbial community structure differed between the grass and the <b>arable</b> <b>system.</b> Soil respiration seemed to be influenced both by manure application and cropping system. In 2011, no significant change in the soil microbial community structure was found five days after manure application. This, however, may change with repeated manure applications over several years. Five earthworm species were identified in the field experiment. Apporrectodea caliginosa was the most common, but also Lumbricus terrestris was abundant. Octolasion cyaneum was found mainly in the <b>arable</b> <b>system.</b> The average density was 133 earthworms m- 2 in the grass system and 117 in the <b>arable</b> <b>system.</b> The average biomass was somewhat higher in the <b>arable</b> <b>system</b> (63. 5 g m- 2) than in the grass system (42. 1 g m- 2). Collembolans were sampled from the grass system, in treatments with no or high manure application (but before manure application), from totally 12 plots. 17 species of collembolans were found, with an average density of and 7950 individuals m- 2. The variation in species composition and density was high, and larger between treatments than between blocks. 11 species were found in all treatments. The most numerous collembolan species were the soil dwelling, white Mesaphorura macrochaeta and Protaphorura armata, and the litter dwelling greenish Isotomurus graminis...|$|E

They are adapted {{to such a degree}} that most of them cannot exist without arable land use. Weeds are part of the total biodiversity on arable fields, as primary producers they are basic for important functions within the ecosystem. This paper elaborates the relevance of species diversity in arable weeds for their management. <b>Arable</b> <b>systems</b> can be regarded for the number of different methods for preventive and direct weed control which are realized. Historical arable land use is roughly divided into three periods, which differ concerning the diversity of weed management and the occurring diversity in weed species. Obviously divers weed management in <b>arable</b> <b>systems</b> and diversity in weed species depend on each other, this is illustrated with a simple abstract picture. <b>Arable</b> <b>systems,</b> which are characterised by simpleness, favor the domination of few species which ensure an effective use of the resources within the ecosystem. One consequence under continuous pressure of an overused tool in weed management is that the genetic diversity within a dominating weed population is exploited to ensure this resource use. Current herbicides represent this tool – the results are herbicide resistant biotypes within the weed populations. Species diversity in arable weeds as a rationale within arable production can assist to prevent this development...|$|R

40|$|Although arable landscapes {{have a long}} history, {{environmental}} problems have accelerated in recent decades. The effects of these changes are usually externalised, being greater for {{society as a whole}} than for the farms on which they operate, and incentives to correct them are therefore largely lacking. Arable landscapes are valued by society beyond the farming community, but increased mechanisation and farm size, simplification of crop rotations, and loss of non-crop features, have led to a reduction in landscape diversity. Low intensity <b>arable</b> <b>systems</b> have evolved a characteristic and diverse fauna and flora, but development of high input, simplified <b>arable</b> <b>systems</b> has been associated with a decline in biodiversity. Arable intensification has resulted in loss of non-crop habitats and simplification of plant and animal communities within crops, with consequent disruption to food chains and declines in many farmland species. Abandonment of arable management has also led to the replacement of such wildlife with more common and widespread species. Soils have deteriorated as a result of erosion, compaction, loss of organic matter and contamination with pesticides, and in some areas, heavy metals. Impacts on water are closely related to those on soils as nutrient and pesticide pollution of water results from surface runoff and subsurface flow, often associated with soil particles, which themselves have economic and ecological impacts. Nitrates and some pesticides also enter groundwater following leaching from arable land.

Chemical and biochemical parameters linked to soil C cycle, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and microarthropod communities were analysed according to a comparative approach. Results suggested a higher soil carbon sequestration in the organic respect to the conventional system, as shown by the values of total organic C (9. 5 and 7. 8 g kg 1, for organic and conventional system, respectively) and potentially mineralisable C (277 and 254 mg kg 1, for organic and conventional system, respectively). AMF population, AMF root colonisation and diversity of microarthropod population were slightly influenced by management system. On the other hand, mites/collembolans ratio was higher in conventionally than in organically managed soil (2. 67 and 1. 30, respectively), indicating as organic managed soils were more disturbed than conventional ones, probably as the consequence of the more frequent soil tillage performed for mechanical weeds control.

On the other hand, input intensification using irrigation, as a complement in the last stage of crop cycle or always when needed, aimed to increase system production levels. To evaluate competitiveness and sustainability of <b>arable</b> crop <b>system</b> we evaluated traditional rotation technology and alternative no tillage and irrigation systems and analyze their farm economic results as well as their energy efficiency and environmental impacts. The analysis of the impact of no tillage and irrigation on <b>arable</b> land production <b>system</b> showed that both alternatives contributed to cost savings and profit earnings, energy savings and reduced GHG emissions, increasing physical and economic factor efficiency. Research and technological development of both options are worthwhile to promote competitiveness and sustainability of <b>arable</b> crop production <b>systems</b> of the Alentejo region in Portugal...|$|R

Hence, from 2001 to 2005, the Silvoarable Agroforestry for Europe project developed a systematic process {{to evaluate the}} biophysical and economic performance of arable, forestry, and silvoarable systems in Spain, France, and The Netherlands. A biophysical model called ¿Yield-SAFE¿ was developed to predict long-term yields for the different systems and local statistics and expert opinion were used to derive their revenue, costs, and pre- and post- 2005 grant regimes. These data were then used in an economic model called ¿Farm-SAFE¿ to predict plot- and farm-scale profitability. Land equivalent ratios were greater than one, showing Yield-SAFE predicted that growing trees and crops in silvoarable systems was more productive than growing them separately. Pre- 2005 grants in Spain and The Netherlands penalised silvoarable systems, but post- 2005 grants were more equitable. In France, walnut and poplar silvoarable systems were consistently the most profitable system under both grant regimes. In Spain, holm oak and stone pine silvoarable systems were the least profitable system under pre- 2005 grants, but only marginally less profitable than <b>arable</b> <b>systems</b> under post- 2005 grants. In The Netherlands, low timber values and the opportunity cost of losing arable land for slurry manure application made silvoarable and forestry <b>systems</b> uncompetitive with <b>arable</b> <b>systems</b> under both grant regime...|$|R
40|$|Breeding and {{wintering}} {{abundance of}} corn buntings in an agricultural landscape of Alentejo (southern Portugal) was assessed {{in relation to}} agricultural intensification and other environmental variables during 1994 – 1997, using distance sampling and multivariate regression. Bird abundance was lowest in intensively managed farmland in both seasons, and was related positively to fallow area in winter and {{to the presence of}} game management and oats in spring. Fallows and oats were associated with extensively managed farmland, but the implementation of a managed hunting regime was unrelated to agricultural intensification. The importance of extensive <b>arable</b> <b>systems</b> to corn bunting conservation is discussed. © 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|We {{compared}} {{the effects of}} conventional and organic arable farming on soil organic matter (SOM) content, soil structure, aggregate stability and C and N mineralization, which are considered important factors in defining sustainable land management. Within one soil series, three different farming systems were selected, including a conventional and an organic <b>arable</b> <b>system</b> and permanent pasture without tillage. The old pasture represents optimal conditions in terms of soil structure and organic matter inputs and is characterized by high earthworm activity. More than 70 years of different management has caused significant differences in soil properties. SOM content, mineralization, earthworm activity and water-stable aggregation decreased {{as a result of}} tillage and arable cropping when compared with pasture, but were significantly greater under organic farming than under conventional farming. Total SOM contents between 0 and 20 cm depth amounted to 15, 24 and 46 g kg(- 1) for the conventional arable, organic arable and permanent pasture fields, respectively. Although less sensitive to slaking than the conventionally managed field, the soil under organic farming was susceptible to compaction when high pressures were exerted on the soil under wet conditions. The beneficial effects of organic farming are generally associated with soil biochemical properties, but soil physical aspects should also be considered. Depending on soil type and climate, organic farmers need {{to be careful not to}} destroy the soil structure, so that they can enjoy maximum advantage from their organic farming systems...|$|E
40|$|Machair is {{a habitat}} found {{predominantly}} in coastal {{areas of the}} north–west of Scotland and is characterised by a low-input, rotational <b>arable</b> <b>system</b> interspersed with semi-natural grasslands. Land management {{is an essential part}} of the machair system as both intensification and abandonment threaten its future. Little is known about this system in terms of its below ground communities. A survey was conducted over a three season, two year period for molecular determination of bacterial, AM fungal and nematode community structure. Cropped, fallow and undisturbed grassland were sampled; soil and roots associated with two commonly occurring species and composite soil samples were collected. In addition the effect of edaphic factors and vegetation composition on soil communities was assessed, both in the field and in greenhouse experiments. Results show that although all of the examined factors impacted the community structure of the three soil groups to some degree, the strength of this effect varied between groups. Bacterial communities were mainly affected by temporal factors, particularly year, possibly due to variation in soil moisture content. AM fungal community structure also varied considerably with season, but the mechanisms behind this were less obvious, with both abiotic and plant factors playing a role. AM fungal community structure varied with different plant hosts but also with soil moisture content. In contrast to both bacteria and AM fungi, nematode communities showed a strong response to land use although temporal factors and differences between locations were also observed. Grasslands harboured a distinctly different community structure from cropped and fallow, largely as a result of variation in bacterivores and carnivores. Vegetation composition and soil moisture content were also found to affect nematode community structure. This study has revealed that machair soil communities seem to be highly complex, dynamic and adapted to the changeable conditions that persist.

40|$|This study investigates how field {{practices}} in handling and applying pesticides influence the long-term patterns of professional agricultural operators’ exposure to pesticides. It presents the {{first use of}} a comprehensive pesticide application dataset collected {{on behalf of the}} European Food Safety Authority with 50 operators selected to cover arable and orchard cropping systems in Greece, Lithuania and the UK. Exposure was predicted based on the harmonised Agricultural Operator Exposure Model (AOEM) and compared with Acceptable Operator Exposure Levels (AOELs). The amount of pesticides handled by individual operators across a cropping season was largest in the UK arable and orchard systems (median 580 and 437 kg active substance, respectively), intermediate for the arable systems in Greece and Lithuania (151 and 77 kg, respectively), and smallest in the Greek orchard system (22 kg). Overall, 30 of the 50 operators made at least one application within a day with predicted exposure greater than the AOEL. The rate of AOEL exceedance was greatest in the Greek cropping systems (8 orchard operators, 2. 8 - 16 % of total applications; 7 arable operators, 1. 1 - 14 % of total applications), and least for the Lithuanian <b>arable</b> <b>system</b> (2 operators, 2. 9 - 4. 5 % of total applications). Instances in Greece when predicted exposure exceed the AOEL were strongly influenced by the widespread use of wettable powder formulations (> 40 % of the total pesticide active substance handled for 11 of the 20 Greek operators). In contrast, the total area of land treated with an active substance on a single day was more important in the UK and Lithuania (95 th percentile observed value was 132 and 19 ha day- 1 for UK arable and orchard systems, respectively). Study findings can be used to evaluate current assumptions in regulatory exposure calculations and to identify situations with potential risk that require further analysis including measurements of exposure to validate model estimations...|$|E
40|$|Agricultural {{change is}} often cited as a causal factor in {{the decline of the}} UK’s {{farmland}} birds because bird declines have mirrored changes in agricultural practices. Although much is known about the mechanisms driving population declines on <b>arable</b> <b>systems,</b> mechanisms in grassland systems are relatively poorly studied, despite receiving a similar degree of inten-sification. Agricultural intensification may affect bird declines by reducing food abundance or accessibility, forager mobility or predation risk. Here we examine experimentally the effects of sward height on the foraging behaviour of adult Common Starlings Sturnus vul-garis, and the effects of sward height and drainage on the behaviour of Northern Lapwin...|$|R
