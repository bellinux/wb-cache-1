25|$|Preparation for pointe work is {{a gradual}} process that begins with barre {{exercises}} to develop the requisite strength in ankles, feet, legs, and core often known as pre-pointe classes. These exercises may vary in accordance with a teacher's preferences <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>applicable,</b> the training method's syllabus. The first exercises at the barre are usually relevés and échappés. When the student is comfortable executing these steps on both feet and sufficiently strong, steps ending on one en pointe foot are introduced, such as pas de bourrée and retiré.|$|E
25|$|The usual {{configurations}} {{used for}} increased primary gas supply are manifolded or independent twin back mounted cylinders, multiple side mounted cylinders, or rebreathers. Bailout and decompression gas may {{be included in}} these arrangements, or carried separately as side-mounted stage and decompression cylinders. Cylinders may carry a variety of gases depending on when and {{where they will be}} used, and as some may not support life if used at the wrong depth, they are marked for positive identification of the contents. Managing the larger number of cylinders is an additional task loading on the diver. Cylinders are usually labeled with the gas mixture and will also be marked with the maximum operating depth <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>applicable,</b> minimum operating depth.|$|E

25|$|The {{first report}} {{regarding}} a rail transit {{system to the}} redeveloped Fornebu was published in April 2001, published by the Norwegian Public Roads Administration and the National Rail Administration. It investigated both bus, people mover, mainline railway and a tramway. The mainline railway alternative {{was based on the}} Asker Line being routed via Fornebu instead of running directly to Lysaker from Sandvika Station. By 2001 construction of the Asker Line was under way and soon this alternative was ruled out. The Ministry of Transport and Communications determined in August that building a line would be the responsibility of Akershus County Municipality, Bærum Municipality <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>applicable,</b> Oslo Municipality. The following month a state grant of 600 million kroner was issued.|$|E
25|$|The three-star grade goes hand-in-hand {{with the}} {{position}} of office it is linked to, so the rank is temporary. Officers may only achieve three-star grade if they are appointed to positions that require the officer to hold such a rank. Their rank expires with the expiration of their term of office, which is usually set by statute. Vice admirals are nominated for appointment by the President from any eligible officers holding the rank of rear admiral (lower half) or above, who also meet the requirements for the position, under the advice and/or suggestion of their respective department secretary, service secretary, <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>applicable,</b> the Joint Chiefs. The nominee must be confirmed via majority vote by the Senate before the appointee can take office and thus assume the rank. The standard tour length for most vice admiral positions is three years but some are set four or more years by statute.|$|E
25|$|The channel {{originally}} {{featured a}} lower display line (LDL) {{similar to that}} seen on TWC at the bottom one-tenth of the screen, to display continuous weather information and inform viewers of current and forthcoming segments in tab form (the tab highlighting the segment being aired at the time cycled between the segment's title and a countdown clock). The national feed's LDL showed current conditions (denoting the sky condition, and cycling through the temperature, wind data <b>and</b> <b>if</b> <b>applicable,</b> apparent temperature) and daypart forecasts for 20 major U.S. cities, and the current time in all four time zones in the Contiguous U.S. The localized versions – which were keyed over the national LDL – cycled through current conditions and forecasts for cities within proximity of the metropolitan area, with the time bar corresponding to the local time zone. As part of a graphical overhaul on February 20, 2017, the LDL {{was replaced by a}} progress bar counting down the runtime of the current segment, which had previously appeared atop the LDL.|$|E

25|$|The {{partition}} coefficient is defined at a specified temperature <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>applicable,</b> pH of the aqueous phase. Partition coefficients {{are very important}} in pharmacology because they {{determine the extent to}} which a substance can pass from the blood (an aqueous solution) through a cell wall which is like an organic solvent. They are usually measured using water and octanol as the two solvents. Many pharmaceutical compounds are weak acids or weak bases. Such a compound may exist with a different extent of protonation depending on pH and the acid dissociation constant. Because the organic phase has a low dielectric constant the species with no electrical charge will be the most likely one to pass from the aqueous phase to the organic phase. Even at pH7–7.2, the range of biological pH values, the aqueous phase may support an equilibrium between more than one protonated form. logp is determined from the analytical concentration of the substance in the aqueous phase, that is, the sum of the concentration of the different species in equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|Subtitle E {{concerns}} jumbo rules concerning escrow {{and settlement}} procedures {{for people who}} are in trouble repaying their mortgages, and also makes amendments to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974. In general, in connection with a residential mortgage there should be an established escrow or impound account for the payment of taxes, hazard insurance, <b>and</b> (<b>if</b> <b>applicable)</b> flood insurance, mortgage insurance, ground rents, and any other required periodic payments. Lender shall disclose to borrower at least three business days before closing the specifics of the amount required to be in the escrow account and the subsequent uses of the funds. If an escrow, impound, or trust account is not established, or the consumer chooses to close the account, the servicer shall provide a timely and clearly written disclosure to the consumer that advises the consumer of the responsibilities of the consumer and implications for the consumer {{in the absence of any}} such account. The amendments to the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (or RESPA) change how a Mortgage servicer (those who administer loans held by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, etc.) should interact with consumers.|$|E
500|$|Aeronautical {{satellite}} communication (SATCOM) systems {{are used to}} transmit messages from the aircraft cockpit, as well as automated messages from on-board systems using the ACARS communications protocol, but may {{also be used to}} transmit FANS and ATN messages and provide voice, fax and data links using other protocols. The aircraft's satellite data unit (SDU) is used to send and receive signals with the {{satellite communication}}s network; it operates independently from other aircraft equipment that communicate through the SATCOM system, many using the ACARS protocol. Signals from the SDU are relayed by a satellite, which simply changes the signal's frequency, and then received by a ground station, which processes the signal <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>applicable,</b> routes it to its destination (e.g., Malaysia Airlines' operations centre); signals to the aircraft are sent in reverse order. When the SDU is powered on and attempts to connect with the Inmarsat network, it transmits a log-on request, which the ground station acknowledges. This is, in part, to determine that the SDU belongs to an active service subscriber and also used to determine which satellite should be used to transmit messages to the SDU. After connecting, if a ground station has not received any contact from a terminal for one hour, the ground station will transmit a [...] "log-on interrogation" [...] message, informally referred to as a [...] "ping"; an active terminal responds automatically. The entire process of interrogating the terminal is referred to as a [...] "handshake".|$|E

2500|$|A winter working green uniform for {{commissioned}} {{officers and}} Chief Petty Officers in the Naval Aviation community was authorized on 7 September 1917 {{in conjunction with}} adoption of the naval aviator wings breast insignia. The initial uniform pattern {{was the same as}} the officers' service dress white uniform tunic and trousers. Like the summer khaki uniform, it was to be worn with high, laced tan leather shoes. Like the aviation khaki uniform, the green uniform was temporarily banished {{during the early years of}} United States aircraft carrier operations from 1922 until a modified design was reauthorized in 1925. The final version, discontinued in January 2011, was somewhat similar to the Navy's revived Service Dress Khaki uniform in cut and design and bore additional similarities to the Marine Corps' Service Dress [...] "Alpha" [...] green uniform. It consisted of a green wool coat and green wool trousers with bronze buttons and a long-sleeve khaki shirt with black tie. Rank insignia consisted of black embroidery on sleeves in a style similar to the gold sleeve braid for officers, or rating marks and service [...] "hash" [...] marks for Chief Petty Officers, on Service Dress Blue uniforms. Metal rank insignia was worn concurrently on the collar points of the khaki shirt by line officers and CPOs. For staff corps officers, rank insignia was worn on the right collar point and staff corps insignia on the left collar point (typically Medical Corps for Naval Flight Surgeons, etc.) of the shirt. Warfare insignia <b>and,</b> <b>if</b> <b>applicable,</b> Command at Sea and/or Command Ashore insignia, were worn on the jacket and optionally on the shirt. [...] Command nametags were also optional on both the blouse and/or shirt. [...] Brown shoes were typically worn, although this transitioned to black between 1975 and 1986 when brown shoes were discontinued. Following the reinstatement of brown shoes in 1986, brown shoes again became the most common footwear. Authorized headgear included a combination cover in green, or a green garrison cover.|$|E
