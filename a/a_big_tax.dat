40|$|Gov. John Kasich has {{proposed}} {{major changes in}} Ohio's tax system, including broadening the sales tax to cover most services, cutting the sales-tax rate, slashing income taxes and giving business owners <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>tax</b> break. Together, {{the impact of these}} changes will be to cut needed revenues, while transferring income from poor and middle-income Ohioans to the affluent. Broadening the sales tax base while cutting the state rate to 5 percent would produce significant needed revenue and make the sales tax more viable long-term, since {{more and more of the}} Ohio economy is based on services. The problem: Low- and moderate-income Ohioans would be most affected, as they would pay the most as a share of their income. And low-income Ohioans already pay more of their income in state and local taxes than rich Ohioans do. If Ohio is going to broaden the tax base, the state should adopt a state Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), as 25 states (including the District of Columbia) have done. It is good policy at any time, especially when legislators are considering raising taxes on those least able to pay. An EITC not only helps create a more fair tax structure, it provides a boost to local economies, as EITC dollars are often spent and saved locally. This multiplier effect creates local and state tax revenue based on goods and services that are sold. Below we review the successes of the federal EITC and how it can be implemented in Ohio...|$|E

40|$|In my {{graduation}} theses I {{focus on}} charge of consumption taxes of consumer sector´s spending. Indirect taxes are imposed onto selected economic goods and increase their costs. Herewith they cause decrease of consumers´ available pension. Howsoever the available pension of different income groups is reduced depends at indirect taxes {{only on the}} level of consumption and which economic goods are used by these groups. Indirect taxes are on the contrary to direct taxes less conspicuous, because they are included in the prices of the wares and services. The consumer pays the tax by paying each purchase without any administrative acts and in doing so they do not know how much they paid in taxes to the government. The tax paid by an entity (natural or legal person) can be basically relocated in two ways. Onward to the buyer on the product market by increase of economic goods´ price or of a factor; backward to the seller. This relocation can be partial, i. e. the tax in new price will be partial; hundred-per-cent and in case of certain conditions it can be even higher than the height of tax is. The relocation doesn´t need to occur at all. For assesment of consumer sector tax charege level from consumption I chose a method which uses accessible agregate dates about consumption of social income group. In calculations I arised from dates from year 2006 published by Czech Statistical Office.

40|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish between types of commercial and residential property for value-added tax (VAT) purposes. The {{reason for this is}} because the supply of residential property may be exempt from VAT in certain cases, whereas the supply of commercial property is a taxable supply. One of the aims of this treatise was to generate some characteristics that can assist vendors to distinguish between types of commercial and residential property for VAT purposes. SARS proposed numerous changes to the VAT Act with regards to fixed property in 2011. This treatise explains the reason for the changes made and also comments on them. Firstly, property developers previously had to account for an output tax adjustment when they changed the use of their property i. e. from a taxable use (selling the completed units) to a non-taxable use (renting the completed units as a residential dwelling). This „output tax adjustment‟ sometimes places developers in a financial dilemma, especially in times of an economic depression. SARS therefore provided „developers‟ as defined with a short term solution. This short term solution provides property developers with a 36 month temporarily relief period, before they have to account for the „output tax adjustment‟. Therefore, the new section 18 B was proposed to assist property developers in times of an economic recession. Secondly, in the past a vendor who acquired a property from a non-vendor to make taxable supplies was allowed a notional input tax deduction, limited to the transfer duty paid. SARS has however "delinked VAT from transfer duty‟, which means that the notional input tax deduction will no longer be limited to the transfer duty paid. This change may benefit vendors as they may now be allowed <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> input <b>tax</b> deduction. Furthermore, the treatise also compares the VAT treatment of the above issues to that of the goods and services tax treatment in New Zealand. The treatise concludes with a summary of all distinguishing characteristics identified and other findings noted...|$|R
