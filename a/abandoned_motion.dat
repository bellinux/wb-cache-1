50|$|The Labour {{government}} eventually fell when, in {{a debate}} about alleged political interference in a decision whether to prosecute a Communist newspaper editor, the Conservative Party <b>abandoned</b> its own <b>motion</b> and voted for a Liberal one which thus passed and caused {{the resignation of the}} Labour government.|$|R
5000|$|On January 13, the Washington Times {{reported}} that [...] "Senior Republican National Committee members are preparing a motion demanding that RNC Chairman Michael S. Steele cancel promotional events {{for the book}} he wrote as chairman. The proposed motion, to {{be presented to the}} 168-member RNC at its annual winter meeting in Honolulu {{at the end of this}} month, also would direct him to donate to the RNC and Republican candidates all proceeds from the book.” On January 30, the Washington Times {{reported that}} the Republican National Committee <b>abandoned</b> the <b>motion</b> that [...] "would have directed Mr. Steele to stop touring the country to promote his book, redirected all proceeds from book sales to the RNC, and it would have banned speech-making for personal financial gain." ...|$|R
50|$|Another {{application}} is the Lévy flight foraging hypothesis. When sharks and other ocean predators can’t find food, they <b>abandon</b> Brownian <b>motion,</b> the random motion seen in swirling gas molecules, for Lévy flight — {{a mix of}} long trajectories and short, random movements found in turbulent fluids. Researchers analyzed over 12 million movements recorded over 5,700 days in 55 data-logger-tagged animals from 14 ocean predator species in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, including silky sharks, yellowfin tuna, blue marlin and swordfish. The data showed that Lévy flights interspersed with Brownian motion can describe the animals' hunting patterns. Birds and other animals (including humans) follow paths that have been modeled using Lévy flight (e.g. when searching for food). Biological flight data can also apparently be mimicked by other models such as composite correlated random walks, which grow across scales to converge on optimal Lévy walks. Composite Brownian walks can be finely tuned to theoretically optimal Lévy walks {{but they are not}} as efficient as Lévy search across most landscapes types, suggesting selection pressure for Lévy walk characteristics is more likely than multi-scaled normal diffusive patterns.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Makarov {{and co-authors}} {{have shown that}} a sunspot cycle roughly repeats the preced-ing polar faculae cycle with a time shift of about half a cycle. This implies adaptations for various dynamo theories: Babcock-Leighton dynamo (Choudhury et al., Dikpati et al.) and tachocline seed field dynamo (Callebaut and coworkers, etc.). Callebaut and de Jager {{suggested}} a two-flow meridional motion; however, {{a problem with the}} very high latitudes of the polar faculae remains. Here we suggest a 3 -D meridional <b>motion,</b> <b>abandoning</b> the rotational symmetry (although an average over cycles keeps it) : this saves the Babcock-Leighton type and the tachocline seed field dynamo; however the latter can work with a simple rotational symmetric two-flow meridional motion too.

50|$|Ladislas Starevich {{started using}} this {{technique}} {{by the time}} he started making films in France (1920s). He moved the puppet or the set during the exposure of the frame to create motion blur. Some of this can be seen in films like The Midnight Wedding, Love in Black and White, The Voice of the Nightingale or The Little Parade and more extensively in the battle scene of The Queen of the Butterflies (1924) and The Mascot (1933). Phil Tippett and Industrial Light & Magic later recreated the go motion technique for some shots of the tauntaun creatures and AT-AT walkers in the 1980 Star Wars film The Empire Strikes Back. After that, go motion was used for many other movies: for the dragon in Dragonslayer (1981), the dinosaurs in the prehistoric documentaries Prehistoric Beast (1984) and Dinosaur! (1985), the harpy sequence in Young Sherlock Holmes (1985), the lord demon creature in Howard the Duck (1986), the winged demon in The Golden Child (1986), the extraterrestrial living flying machines in Batteries Not Included (1987), the two-headed Eborsisk dragon in Willow (1988), the RoboCop franchise (1987-1993) and Coneheads (1993). Other minor sequences using go motion appeared in films like the first three Indiana Jones installments (1981-1989) and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982) among a few others. In 1993, with the release of Jurassic Park, Tippett Studio <b>abandoned</b> go <b>motion</b> and fully converted its teams and equipment to CG. The last film using go motion was Coneheads (Jurassic Park was released on June 11, 1993 but Coneheads was released on July 23, 1993).|$|R
