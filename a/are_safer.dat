5|$|The {{greatest}} risk in flying is in takeoff and landing, meaning that longer aircraft trips <b>are</b> <b>safer</b> per mile. Commuter planes used on shorter flights have higher risk than larger jet aircraft. Driving on U.S. Interstate highways, which {{are almost always}} controlled-access divided highways, is safer than driving on most other roads and highways.|$|E
25|$|Statistically, modern roundabouts <b>are</b> <b>safer</b> {{for drivers}} and {{pedestrians}} than both traffic circles and traditional intersections. Roundabouts <b>are</b> <b>safer</b> than both traffic circles and junctionsâ€”experiencing 39% fewer vehicle collisions, 76% fewer injuries and 90% fewer serious injuries and fatalities (according {{to a study}} of a sampling of roundabouts in the United States, {{when compared with the}} junctions they replaced). Some larger roundabouts take foot and bicycle traffic through underpasses or alternate routes. Clearwater Beach, Florida's multi-lane roundabout has reduced its previously high cyclist death rate to zero since its construction.|$|E

25|$|Automatic {{couplers}} {{like the}} Janney <b>are</b> <b>safer</b> in a collision because they help prevent the carriages telescoping. British Rail therefore decided {{to adopt a}} Janney variant for its passenger carriages, with the coupler able to swing {{out of the way}} for coupling to engines with the traditional buffer and chain system.|$|E
25|$|Ferrocene and its {{derivatives}} are antiknock agents used in {{the fuel}} for petrol engines; they <b>are</b> <b>safer</b> than tetraethyllead, previously used. Petrol additive solutions containing ferrocene {{can be added to}} unleaded petrol to enable its use in vintage cars designed to run on leaded petrol. The iron-containing deposits formed from ferrocene can form a conductive coating on the spark plug surfaces.|$|E
25|$|Convertible bonds <b>are</b> <b>safer</b> than {{preferred}} or {{common shares}} for the investor. They provide asset protection, because {{the value of}} the convertible bond will only fall to {{the value of the}} bond floor: however in reality if stock price falls too much the credit spread will increase and the price of the bond will go below the bond floor. At the same time, convertible bonds can provide the possibility of high equity-like returns.|$|E

25|$|A third {{alternative}} {{is to use a}} radioactive label rather than an enzyme coupled to the secondary antibody, such as labeling an antibody-binding protein like Staphylococcus Protein A or Streptavidin with a radioactive isotope of iodine. Since other methods <b>are</b> <b>safer,</b> quicker, and cheaper, this method is now rarely used; however, an advantage of this approach is the sensitivity of auto-radiography-based imaging, which enables highly accurate protein quantification when combined with optical software (e.g. Optiquant).|$|E
25|$|A city {{car is a}} small {{automobile}} {{intended for}} use in urban areas. Unlike microcars, a city car's greater speed, capacity and (in perception at least) occupant protection <b>are</b> <b>safer</b> in mixed traffic environments and weather conditions. While city cars can reach highway speeds, that is not their intended use. In Japan, city cars are called kei cars. Kei cars have to meet strict size and engine requirements: engines have a maximum displacement of 660nbsp&cc and the car's length must be under 3400nbsp&mm.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} {{and the treatment}} of an overdose are largely {{the same as for}} the other TCAs, including the presentation of serotonin syndrome and adverse cardiac effects. The British National Formulary notes that amitriptyline can be particularly dangerous in overdose, thus it and other TCAs are no longer recommended as first-line therapy for depression. Alternative agents, SSRIs and SNRIs, <b>are</b> <b>safer</b> in overdose, though they are no more efficacious than TCAs. English folk singer Nick Drake died from an overdose of Tryptizol in 1974.|$|E

25|$|Sea mammals such as walrus, seal, and whale. Whale meat {{generally}} {{comes from}} the narwhal narwhal, beluga whale and the bowhead whale. The latter is able to feed an entire community {{for nearly a year}} from its meat, blubber, and skin. Inuit hunters most often hunt juvenile whales which, compared to adults, <b>are</b> <b>safer</b> to hunt and have tastier skin. Ringed seal and bearded seal are {{the most important aspect of}} an Inuit diet and is often the largest part of an Inuit hunter's diet.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, {{advances}} {{were made}} in molecular cytogenetics. While radioisotope-labeled probes had been hybridized with DNA since 1969, movement was now made in using fluorescent labeled probes. Hybridizing them to chromosomal preparations using existing techniques {{came to be known}} as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). This change significantly increased the usage of probing techniques as fluorescent labeled probes <b>are</b> <b>safer.</b> Further advances in micromanipulation and examination of chromosomes led to the technique of chromosome microdissection whereby aberrations in chromosomal structure could be isolated, cloned and studied in ever greater detail.|$|E
25|$|In the {{presence}} of an alkyl halide the carbanion can also undergo nucleophilic substitution with carbon-carbon bond formation. In substituted aromatic compounds an electron-withdrawing substituent, such as a carboxylic acid, stabilizes a carbanion and the least-substituted olefin is generated. With an electron-donating substituent the opposite effect is obtained. The reaction produces more of the less thermodynamically stable non-conjugated 1,4-addition product than the more stable conjugated 1,3-diene because the largest orbital coefficient of the HOMO of the conjugated pentadienyl anion intermediate is on the central carbon atom. Once formed, the resulting 1,4-cyclohexadiene is unable to equilibrate to the thermodynamically more stable product; therefore, the observed kinetic product is produced. Experimental alkali metal alternatives that <b>are</b> <b>safer</b> to handle, such as the M-SG reducing agent, also exist.|$|E

25|$|The most {{hazardous}} compound is hydrogen cyanide, {{which is}} a gas and kills by inhalation. For this reason, an air respirator supplied by an external oxygen source must be worn when working with hydrogen cyanide. Hydrogen cyanide is produced by adding acid to a solution containing a cyanide salt. Alkaline solutions of cyanide <b>are</b> <b>safer</b> to use {{because they do not}} evolve hydrogen cyanide gas. Hydrogen cyanide may be produced in the combustion of polyurethanes; for this reason, polyurethanes are not recommended for use in domestic and aircraft furniture. Oral ingestion of a small quantity of solid cyanide or a cyanide solution as little as 200mg, or exposure to airborne cyanide of 270 ppm, is sufficient to cause death within minutes.|$|E
25|$|Another word, divvie or divvy ("idiot"), {{seems to}} come from the Co-op dividend, or from the two Davy lamps (the more {{explosive}} Scotch Davy used in 1850, commission disapproved of its use in 1886 (inventor not known, nicknamed Scotch Davy probably given by miners after the Davy lamp was made perhaps by north east miners who used the Stephenson Lamp), and the later better designed Davy designed by Humphry Davy also called the Divvy.) As in a north east miner saying 'Marra, ye keep way from me if ye usin a divvy.' It seems the word divvie then translated to daft lad/lass. Perhaps coming from the fact one would be seen as foolish going down a mine with a Scotch Divvy when there <b>are</b> <b>safer</b> lamps available, like the Geordie, or the Davy.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{stirrups}} {{come in a}} {{wide variety}} of styles, sizes and materials and are attached to most saddles by means of adjustable stirrup leathers, which can be altered in length to fit both the size of the rider and the need to remain over the horse's optimal center of balance for a given equestrianism discipline. There are safety concerns associated with the use of stirrups, including a risk that a fallen rider may get their foot caught in the stirrup and be dragged by the horse, or that long hours of use without rest may cause problems in the human foot's Peroneus Tertius tendon. Stirrups <b>are</b> <b>safer</b> to use when riding boots are worn, and proper sizing and placement of the foot on the stirrup increases both safety and usability.|$|E

500|$|Beginners in {{particular}} often practice techniques from grabs, both because they <b>are</b> <b>safer</b> {{and because it}} is easier to feel the energy and lines of force of a hold than a strike.

The following are examples of some basic grabs: ...|$|E
500|$|Few {{passengers}} {{at first}} {{were willing to}} board the lifeboats and the officers {{in charge of the}} evacuation found it difficult to persuade them. The millionaire John Jacob Astor declared: [...] "We <b>are</b> <b>safer</b> here than in that little boat." [...] Some passengers refused flatly to embark. J. Bruce Ismay, realising the urgency of the situation, roamed the starboard boat deck urging passengers and crew to board the boats. A trickle of women, couples and single men were persuaded to board starboard lifeboat No.7, which became the first lifeboat to be lowered.|$|E
500|$|Because {{there are}} both mutual and {{conflicting}} interests in most animal signalling systems, a central problem in signalling theory is dishonesty or cheating. [...] For example, if foraging birds <b>are</b> <b>safer</b> when {{they give a}} warning call, cheats could give false alarms at random, just in case a predator is nearby. [...] But too much cheating could cause the signalling system to collapse. Every dishonest signal weakens {{the integrity of the}} signalling system, and so reduces the fitness of the group. An example of dishonest signalling comes from Fiddler crabs such as Uca lactea mjoebergi, which have been shown to bluff (no conscious intention being implied) about their fighting ability. When a claw is lost, a crab occasionally regrows a weaker claw that nevertheless intimidates crabs with smaller but stronger claws. The proportion of dishonest signals is low enough for it not to be worthwhile for crabs to test the honesty of every signal through combat.|$|E
