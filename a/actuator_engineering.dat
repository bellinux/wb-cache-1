40|$|The {{capability}} of modern fighter airplanes to sustain flight at high angles of attack and/or moderate angles of sideslip {{often results in}} immersion of part of such an airplane in unsteady, separated, vortical flow emanating from its forebody or wings. The flows from these surfaces become turbulent and separated during flight under these conditions. These flows contain significant levels of energy over a frequency band coincident with that of low-order structural vibration modes of wings, fins, and control surfaces. The unsteady pressures applied to these lifting surfaces {{as a result of}} the turbulent flows are commonly denoted buffet loads, and the resulting vibrations of the affected structures are known as buffeting. Prolonged exposure to buffet loads has resulted in fatigue of structures on several airplanes. Damage to airplanes caused by buffeting has led to redesigns of airplane structures and increased support costs for the United States Air Force and Navy as well as the armed forces of other countries. Time spent inspecting, repairing, and replacing structures adversely affects availability of aircraft for missions. A blend of rudder-control and piezoelectric- <b>actuator</b> <b>engineering</b> concepts was selected as a basis for the design of a vertical-tail buffet-load-alleviation system for the F/A- 18 airplane. In this system, the rudder actuator is used to control the response of the first tail vibrational mode (bending at a frequency near 15 Hz), while directional patch piezoelectric actuators are used to control the second tail vibrational mode (tip torsion at a frequency near 45 Hz). This blend of two types of actuator utilizes the most effective features of each. An analytical model of the aeroservoelastic behavior of the airplane equipped with this system was validated by good agreement with measured results from a full-scale ground test, flight-test measurement of buffet response, and an in-flight commanded rudder frequency sweep. The overall performance of the system was found to be characterized by reductions, ranging from 70 to 30 percent, in vertical-tail buffeting under buffet loads ranging from moderate to severe. These reductions were accomplished with a maximum commanded rudder angle of +/- 2 deg at 15 Hz and about 10 lb (. 4. 5 kg) of piezoelectric actuators attached to the vertical tail skin and operating at a peak power level of 2 kW. By meeting the design objective, this system would extend the vertical-tail fatigue life beyond two aircraft lifetimes. This system is also adaptable to other aircraft surfaces and other aircraf...|$|E

Most critical to this effort is the development of an actuator that behaves like muscle. Although important research has been conducted to advance <b>actuator</b> function, <b>engineering</b> science has not yet produced an effective artificial muscle. Polymer gels provide stresses and displacements comparable to muscle, but their contractile velocity is far too slow for many applications[1]. The goal of our work is to investigate the feasibility of using animal-derived muscle as an actuator for robotic applications in the millimeter to centimeter size scale. Motivation: Muscle is employed almost exclusively by animals for actuation, from sub-millimeter organisms to blue whales. Using muscle to power movement has certain advantages. Muscle generates force quietly, allowing predators to move within close proximity of prey. Muscle is also adaptive and responds to varying work loads by modulating its structure to meet specific tasks demands. Still further, muscle is efficient. Working aerobically, muscle can generate up to 4000 kJ of work from just 1 Kg of glucose. And for its size, muscle can generate a large isometric force, enabling the extremities of organisms to be lightweight but strong.

To replicate these biological features in vitro, soft substrata with tunable elasticity and the possibility for controlled surface translocation are desirable. Here we report on the use of ultra-soft (Young’s modulus < 100 kPa) PDMS-based magnetoactive elastomers (MAE) as suitable cell culture substrata. Soft non-viscous PDMS (< 18 kPa) is produced using a modified extended crosslinker. MAEs are generated by embedding magnetic microparticles into a soft PDMS matrix. Both substrata yield an elasticity-dependent (14 vs. 100 kPa) modulation of ?-smooth muscle actin expression in primary human fibroblasts. To allow for static or dynamic control of MAE material properties, we devise low magnetic field (? 40 mT) stimulation systems compatible with cell-culture environments. Magnetic field-instigated stiffening (14 to 200 kPa) of soft MAE enhances the spreading of primary human fibroblasts and decreases PAX- 7 transcription in human mesenchymal stem cells. Pulsatile MAE movements are generated using oscillating magnetic fields and are well tolerated by adherent human fibroblasts.

In particular, PAN fiber contracts when exposed to a low pH environment and expands when exposed to a high pH environment. Due to this phenomenon, PAN fibers can create effective actuation forces and displacements through muscle-like contractile behavior during the volume change.

40|$|Human {{motor control}} is often {{explained}} in terms of engineering ‘servo’ theory. Recently, continuous, optimal control using internal models has emerged as a leading paradigm for voluntary movement. However, these engineering paradigms are designed for high bandwidth, inflexible, consistent systems whereas human control is low bandwidth and flexible using noisy sensors and <b>actuators.</b> By contrast, <b>engineering</b> intermittent control was designed for bandwidth-limited applications. Our general interest is whether intermittent rather than continuous control is generic to human motor control. Currently, it would be assumed that continuous control is the superior and physiologically natural choice for controlling unstable loads, for example as required for maintaining human balance. Using visuo-manual tracking of an unstable load, we show that control using gentle, intermittent taps is entirely natural and effective. The gentle tapping method resulted in slightly superior position control and velocity minimisation, a reduced feedback time delay, greater robustness to changing actuator gain and equal or greater linearity with respect to the external disturbance. Control was possible with a median contact rate of 0. 8 ± 0. 3 s− 1. However, when optimising position or velocity regulation, a modal contact rate of 2 s− 1 was observed. This modal rate was consistent with insignificant disturbance–joystick coherence beyond 1 – 2 Hz in both tapping and continuous contact methods. For this load, these results demonstrate a motor control process of serial ballistic trajectories limited to an optimum rate of 2 s− 1. Consistent with theoretical reasoning, our results suggest that intermittent open loop action is a natural consequence of human physiology...|$|R

Bending <b>actuators</b> have limited <b>engineering</b> applications due to the low forcing capabilities and the need for complicated external devices to convert the bending action into rotating or linear motion desired in most devices. Recently Akle and Leo (2006) reported extensional actuation in ionic polymer transducers. Model prediction indicates that such actuators can produce strain up to 10 % and a blocked stress up to 20 MPa under a +/- 2 V applied electric potential. Compared to other smart materials, IPT is a flexible membrane and it has a reliability of over one million cycles. In this work novel extensional IPT actuators are developed for the purpose of increasing the overall displacement of the actuator. The electromechanical coupling is measured and a correlation of the experimental data with the active areas model by Akle and Leo (2006) and the numerical electromechanical model by Wallmersperger and Leo (2004) are presented. The coupling between each test case with the model parameters enables further understanding of the physical actuation phenomena as the role of diffusion of ions and diluents and the electrostatic forces between the charged species. In this study the displacement of an extensional ionic polymer transducer is measured and compared to the bending of the same IPT actuator. The bending strain is measured to be approximately 2. 5 %, while the extensional strain for the same ionomer is in the order of 17. 5 %.

40|$|AbstractIn recent years, the {{application}} of plasma <b>actuators</b> in different <b>engineering</b> fields was considered particularly interesting. It was successfully applied for the cold flow control in aero engines and turbo-devices. One important application concerns the use of non-equilibrium plasma for plasma-assisted ignition and combustion control. The reduction of nitric oxides (NOx) in aircraft engines, gas turbines, or internal combustion engines {{has become a major}} issue in the development of combustion systems. A way to reduce the NOx emissions is to burn under homogenous lean conditions. However, in these regimes the flame becomes unstable and it leads to incomplete combustion or even extinction. Thus, the major issue becomes to stabilize the flame under lean conditions. In this context the present work aims to demonstrate the possibility to increase the combustion efficiency of a lean flame through the use of nanosecond repetitively pulsed plasma (NRPP). A NRPP produced by electric pulses with amplitude up to 40 kV, pulse rise time lower than 4 ns and repetition rate up to 3. 5 kHz has been used to stabilize and improve the efficiency of a lean non premixed methane/air flame in a non-premixed Bunsen-type burner. The burner is optically accessible permitting the imaging acquisitions of the flame region. The flame behavior was acquired using a high rate CCD camera in order to capture the differences between the baseline conditions and the actuated cases. Moreover a post-processing technique showing the jagging of the flame in different conditions was applied to evaluate the changes occurring in presence of plasma actuation in term of flame area weighted respect to the luminosity intensity. It was shown that the plasma significantly allows stabilizing the flame under lean conditions where it would not exist without plasma...|$|R

Bending <b>actuators</b> have limited <b>engineering</b> applications due to the low forcing capabilities and the need for complicated external devices to convert the bending action into rotating or linear motion desired in most devices. Recently Akle and Leo reported extensional actuation in ionic polymer transducers. In this study, extensional IPTs are characterized as a function of transducer architecture. In this study 2 actuators are built and there extensional displacement response is characterized. The transducers have similar electrodes while the middle membrane in the first is a Nafion / ionic liquid and an aluminum oxide - ionic liquid in the second. The first transducer is characterized for constant current input, voltage step input, and sweep voltage input. The model prediction is in agreement in both shape and magnitude for the constant current experiment. The values of α and β used are within the range of values reported in Akle and Leo. Both experiments and model demonstrate that there is a preferred direction of applying the potential so that the transducer will exhibit large deformations. In step response the model well predicted the negative potential and {{the early part of the}} step in the positive potential and failed to predict the displacement after approximately 180 s has elapsed. The model well predicted the sweep response, and the observed 1 st harmonic in the displacement further confirmed the existence of a quadratic in the charge response.

The second actuator demonstrated electromechanical extensional response faster than that in the Nafion based transducer.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) (Electrical <b>Engineering)</b> <b>Actuators</b> are {{naturally}} limited in the force they can apply, and efficiency often dictates operation that {{is close to}} the limits of the permissible values. This is especially true for adaptive optics systems that compensate for the atmospheric turbulence using the mirrors deformable on-the-fly by the actuators. On the one hand, the actuator should use all the authority to bend the deformable mirror and thus compensate the turbulence. On the other hand, the actuators must not damage the mirror by pushing the surface too hard, and the controller must account for these constraints. This thesis focuses on the high-speed constrained control of deformable mirrors in astronomical adaptive optics. The main approach considered in this work is constrained Receding Horizon Control with Quadratic Programming. A thorough study of the structure and the physics of the control problem allowed exploiting the structure of the problem and an inherently fast sampling rate to hot-start the online optimisation. These features are of crucial importance, making it possible to accelerate the constrained control by orders of magnitude compared to standard algorithms. The original contribution of this thesis is a thorough feasibility analysis of the online optimisation algorithms for constrained control in adaptive optics systems. While the Convex Optimisation and the Receding Horizon Control are well studied areas, their application for astronomical adaptive optics has not been systematically studied. The thesis provides the results of numerical simulations that conclusively prove the feasibility of online constrained control of a deformable mirror. Using state-of-the-art Quadratic Optimisation algorithms of my own implementation, a control rate of 10 kHz for a relatively large deformable mirror has been achieved. The significance of the results of this thesis is a comprehensive performance analysis of various optimisation approaches for constrained optimal control of deformable mirrors in adaptive optics. This is an important step towards attaining the ultimate compensation potential of adaptive optics systems...|$|R
40|$|Communication {{networks}} have enabled environmental monitoring and remote control with sensors and actuators. It {{has been applied}} to building automation and facility management for the last one decade and shown that they are promising technologies for Green by ICT. The differences of building automation and facility management are their targets and scopes. The target of building automation network is to autonomously control actuators based on observed events with sensors. The target of facility management network is to analyze the usage of facilities in buildings so as to improve the efficiency of energy usage. The recent rise of green-awareness in global society has attracted attentions to these technologies. However implementing them into actual buildings is not an easy mission but requires huge efforts. Only a few people or companies afford to pay their huge time and cost for this. The workload of system maintenance or update is also heavy. The system owners have to operate it for at least several decades: i. e., for the lifetime of the building. Programs of the system should be changed according to the changes of floors or other configurations though it is not always simple. Some system components become out-of-order in several years and need to be replaced. Those system components are not always available in the next one decade. The current development of a facility management system involves proprietary design and implementation. Engineers, with identifying the use cases, design the schema of databases and user interfaces, select suitable communication protocols, and implement software based on the designs and selections. The system components developed in the project cannot be directly used at other projects. The maintenance of the system involves the engineering of the software (e. g., internal design, programming and debugging) for the proprietarily specified data schema and communication protocols. There is another issue at the installation of building automation systems. We must install communication cables in a building to connect sensors and actuators. Recently, radio devices have been also considered for this purpose. However, wireless networks are still unreliable; they frequently become disconnected and lose packets, and to provide network connectivity for sensors and actuators over multiple network relays is challenging. Thus, currently, we only let sensors and actuators be wireless and few relays are used in the practical deployment. Wireless access range is limited, and cables must be installed in buildings to provide network connectivity. Based on those issues, we have setup the following two research challenges, in this thesis. ・Development of a common protocol stack for composing data-centric sensor actuator networks: i. e., facility management system. Data-centric sensor actuator networks focus on sensor data management rather than networking of sensors and actuators. They archive the historical records of sensors. The component that organizes data-centric sensor actuator networks must have the same protocol stack so that we can integrate them by component-and-flow programming style. This structure reduces engineering cost at the system integration phase. ・Development of data transportation scheme for unreliable networks. We must enable data transportation over intermittently-connected networks. Even if nodes are fixed, wireless links frequently become disconnected. Delay or disruption tolerant networking (DTN) has theoretically enabled message transportation over such links, but widely-studied message routing algorithms are still targeted at specific mobility models. The challenge is to design a routing algorithm that can be applied to both stable networks and totally random networks. In this thesis, we present our contributions in two parts. In the first part, we propose component and flow programming model for sensor data management, and design facility information access protocol (FIAP) and central controller-based device management (CCDM) architecture. In the latter part, we propose potential-based entropy adaptive routing (PEAR) and delay tolerant IP networking (DTIPN) as data transportation schemes over unreliable networks. In the research of FIAP, we identify (1) design pitfalls in data-centric sensor actuator networks, (2) challenges in the design of common protocol stack for implementing essential functional components, and (3) policies and algorithms for FIAP specification. We have developed FIAP protocol stack, implemented such components, and integrated into a data-centric sensor <b>actuator</b> network in <b>Engineering</b> Bldg. 2 in the University of Tokyo. This experiment has shown that FIAP allows lightweight integration for wide-varieties of applications of facility management systems. In the research of CCDM, we propose a centralized architecture for managing hundreds or thousands of sensor and actuator devices, and their dataflows. CCDM allows the integration and configuration of large number of components in a centralized terminal (or window). This also helps the integration of FIAP components into a facility management system. In our experiment, CCDM has shown its capability of computing moderately complex placement algorithms in the traffic optimization case. We consider that this capability makes other optimizations feasible, such as delivery latency, load-balancing, and fault-tolerance. In the research of PEAR, we propose a reliable communication framework for wide varieties of mobility models from stable networks to totally random networks. PEAR changes message delivery patterns according to the complexity of the topology changes. If the contact patterns among node are somehow related, PEAR chooses almost the best path. If the contact patterns become complex and estimation of contacts become meaningless, PEAR replicates messages in the network and maintains delivery probability. We carried out both simulation-based and prototype-based experiments to validate the behavior of PEAR. We evaluated delivery probability, latency, total transmissions and buffer usage. Though the delay increased according to the hop count, PEAR could achieve 100 % message delivery in sensor data transportation. This result indicates that PEAR is quite adaptive to various mobility models and provides reliable communication framework compared to previously proposed routing schemes. We also demonstrate in this thesis that wireless links are totally intermittent even if nodes are physically stable. We carried out experiments with 50 wireless nodes in Engineering Bldg. 2 and Hongo campus, in the University of Tokyo. It has also shown that hop-by-hop transfer and parallel message propagation, which PEAR takes, enables scalable message propagation in hop count and increases message propagation speed. In the research of DTIPN, we propose an alternative architecture of DTN that seamlessly connects intermittently-connected networks to the existing Internet. IP packets can be delayed not only for seconds but also for hours and days. By making use of this fact, we demonstrate that sensor nodes in isolated networks can still send message to the Internet host with the Internet protocol. 報告番号: 甲 27284; 学位授与年月日: 2011 - 03 - 24; 学位の種別: 課程博士; 学位の種類: 博士(情報理工学); 学位記番号: 博情第 322 号; 研究科・専攻: 情報理工学系研究科電子情報学専...|$|R
