25|$|Unusually the MCC were {{scheduled}} to play a minor game immediately before the First Test and travelled 80 miles inland to the large town of Toowoomba. Mike Smith won the toss, fielded and used 10 bowlers in the Queensland Country innings before they declared on 157/4, Gary Jennings making nearly half their runs with his 77. Bob Barber made 56 of his 80 run opening stand with Geoff Boycott, who hung <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> 48 not out in the MCC's 159/3 as they won by seven wickets.|$|E
25|$|One might further {{hypothesize that}} the {{experimental}} treatment regulates cholesterol, because the treatment seems to selectively regulate genes associated with cholesterol. While {{this may be}} true, {{there are a number}} of reasons why making this a firm conclusion based on enrichment alone represents an unwarranted leap of faith. One previously mentioned issue has to do with the observation that gene regulation may have no direct impact on protein regulation: even if the proteins coded for by these genes do nothing other than make cholesterol, showing that their mRNA is altered does not directly tell us what is happening at the protein level. It is quite possible that the amount of these cholesterol-related proteins remains constant under the experimental conditions. Second, even if protein levels do change, perhaps there is always enough of them <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> cholesterol as fast as it can be possibly made, that is, another protein, not on our list, is the rate determining step in the process of making cholesterol. Finally, proteins typically play many roles, so these genes may be regulated not because of their shared association with making cholesterol but because of a shared role in a completely independent process.|$|E
500|$|Emden quickly inflicted grievous {{damage on}} her adversary; she turned <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> another pass at Zhemchug. One of the Russian gun crews {{managed to get}} their weapon into action, but scored no hits. Müller ordered a second torpedo to be fired into the burning Zhemchug while his guns {{continued}} to batter her. The second torpedo caused a tremendous explosion that tore the ship apart. By the time the smoke cleared, Zhemchug had already slipped beneath the waves, her masts the only parts of the ship still above water. The destruction of Zhemchug killed 81 Russian sailors and wounded 129, of whom seven later died of their injuries. The elderly French cruiser [...] and the destroyer [...] opened wildly inaccurate fire on Emden.|$|E

500|$|That evening Graves did a damage assessment. He {{noted that}} [...] "the French {{had not the}} {{appearance}} of near so much damage as we had sustained", and that five of his fleet were either leaking or virtually crippled in their mobility. De Grasse wrote that [...] "we perceived by the sailing of the English that they had suffered greatly." [...] Nonetheless, Graves maintained a windward position through the night, {{so that he would}} have the choice of battle in the morning. Ongoing repairs made it clear to Graves that he would be unable to attack the next day. On the night of 6 September he held council with Hood and Drake. During this meeting Hood and Graves supposedly exchanged words concerning the conflicting signals, and Hood proposed turning the fleet <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> for the Chesapeake. Graves rejected the plan, and the fleets continued to drift eastward, away from Cornwallis. [...] On 8 and 9 September the French fleet at times gained the advantage of the wind, and briefly threatened the British with renewed action. French scouts spied Barras' fleet on 9 September, and de Grasse turned his fleet back toward Chesapeake Bay that night. Arriving on 12 September, he found that Barras had arrived two days earlier. Graves ordered the Terrible to be scuttled on 11 September due to her leaky condition, and was notified on 13 September that the French fleet was back in the Chesapeake; he still did not learn that de Grasse's line had not included the fleet of Barras, because the frigate captain making the report had not counted the ships. [...] In a council held that day, the British admirals decided against attacking the French, due to [...] "the truly lamentable state we have brought ourself." [...] Graves then turned his battered fleet toward New York, arriving off Sandy Hook on 20 September.|$|E

2500|$|Mary Cox {{was born}} on 4 August 1946, in Liverpool, England. She was {{the only child of}} Joseph Cox, a ship's steward, and Florence Cox (née Barrett). As a teenager, she remembered turning her school uniform <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it look like a frock, and paying a school friend ten {{cigarettes}} a day to teach her how to [...] "smoke properly". She left convent school when she was 14 years old, changing her name to Maureen when she began her career as a trainee manicurist/hairdresser at Ashley du Pre, in Liverpool, but was known as [...] "Mo" [...] to her friends.|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} {{generally}} well received by critics. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the album for proving that they're [...] "stronger and {{more serious than}} many of their post-grunge peers" [...] and concluding that [...] "there's not quite enough of it this time <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Blue the equal of its predecessor, {{but it should be}} enough to please devoted fans." [...] James Hunter of Rolling Stone similarly praised the album for its [...] "finely worked-out chunks of serious gun-metal rockcraft that depend on the San Francisco band's restless, edgy electric guitars" [...] and concluded that the album was a rarity in the way it [...] "works best as either background rock or intimate headphone material." [...] Elysa Gardner of Entertainment Weekly noted Jenkins' lyrics and vocal delivery and Cadogan's guitar-work as standout elements of the album.|$|E
2500|$|Sourav Ganguly {{returned}} for India, after {{being left out}} of the ODI side on recent tours, and the former captain saw action in the first session when he was called upon to bowl four overs of medium pace, but neither he nor any of the two spinners Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble could get a wicket in the morning session, and Malik completed his half-century [...] off 109 balls just before the lunch break when he turned a ball from Kumble <b>around</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> two runs. The century stand came up shortly afterwards, before Pathan got the only wicket to a bowler's name on the first day; Malik was caught by Harbhajan for 59 off 145 balls. However, another century stand was to follow - Pakistan were 220 for 2 at tea, and Yousuf and Younis added a further 106 in the evening session, 30 of those coming in the last five overs against the new ball. With five overs remaining on the clock, bad light stopped play, with Yousuf five short of his century; in the previous over, he had been dropped by Sehwag in the gully.|$|E
