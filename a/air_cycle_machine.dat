40|$|The {{rolling element}} {{bearings}} (REB's) which support many turbomachinery rotors offer high load capacity, low power requirements, and durability. Two disadvantages of REB's are as follows: rolling or sliding contact within the bearing has life-limiting consequences; and REB's provide essentially no damping. The REB's in the Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) turbopumps must sustain high static and dynamic loads, at high speeds, with a cryogenic fluid as lubricant and coolant. The pump end ball bearings limit {{the life of}} the SSME high pressure oxygen turbopump (HPOTP). Compliant foil bearing (CFB) manufacturers have proposed replacing turbopump REB's with CFB's. CFB's work well in aircraft <b>air</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>machines,</b> auxiliary power units, and refrigeration compressors. In a CFB, the rotor only contacts the foil support structure during start up and shut down. CFB damping is higher than REB damping. However, the load capacity of the CFB is low, compared to a REB. Furthermore, little stiffness and damping data exist for the CFB. A rotordynamic analysis for turbomachinery critical speeds and stability requires the input of bearing stiffness and damping coefficients. The two basic types of CFB are the tension-dominated bearing and the bending-dominated bearing. Many investigators have analyzed and measured characteristics of tension-dominated foil bearings, which are applied principally in magnetic tape recording. The bending-dominated CFB is used more in rotating machinery. Recently, a new tension-foil bearing configuration has been proposed for turbomachinery applications...|$|R
40|$|The Oil-Free Turbomachinery {{team at the}} NASA Glenn Research Center has {{unlocked}} one of {{the mysteries}} surrounding foil air bearing performance. Foil air bearings are self-acting hydrodynamic bearings that use ambient air, or any fluid, as their lubricant. In operation, {{the motion of the}} shaft's surface drags fluid into the bearing by viscous action, creating a pressurized lubricant film. This lubricating film separates the stationary foil bearing surface from the moving shaft and supports load. Foil bearings have been around for decades and are widely employed in the <b>air</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>machines</b> used for cabin pressurization and cooling aboard commercial jetliners. The Oil-Free Turbomachinery team is fostering the maturation of this technology for integration into advanced Oil-Free aircraft engines. Elimination of the engine oil system can significantly reduce weight and cost and could enable revolutionary new engine designs. Foil bearings, however, have complex elastic support structures (spring packs) that make the prediction of bearing performance, such as load capacity, difficult if not impossible. Researchers at Glenn recently found a link between foil bearing design and load capacity performance. The results have led to a simple rule-of-thumb that relates a bearing's size, speed, and design to its load capacity. Early simple designs (Generation I) had simple elastic (spring) support elements, and performance was limited. More advanced bearings (Generation III) with elastic supports, in which the stiffness is varied locally to optimize gas film pressures, exhibit load capacities that are more than double those of the best previous designs. This is shown graphically in the figure. These more advanced bearings have enabled industry to introduce commercial Oil-Free gas-turbine-based electrical generators and are allowing the aeropropulsion industry to incorporate the technology into aircraft engines. The rule-of-thumb enables engine and bearing designers to easily size and select bearing technology for a new application and determine the level of complexity required in the bearings. This new understanding enables industry to assess the feasibility of new engine designs and provides critical guidance toward the future development of Oil-Free turbomachinery propulsion systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{misalignment}} and unbalance on gas foil bearings are presented. The future of U. S. space exploration includes plans to conduct science missions aboard space vehicles, return humans to the Moon, and place humans on Mars. All of these endeavors are of long duration, and require high amounts of electrical power for propulsion, life support, mission operations, etc. One {{potential source of}} electrical power of sufficient magnitude and duration is a nuclear-fission-based system. The system architecture would consist of a nuclear reactor heat source with the resulting thermal energy converted to electrical energy through a dynamic power conversion and heat rejection system. Various types of power conversion systems can be utilized, but the Closed Brayton Cycle (CBC) turboalternator {{is one of the}} leading candidates. In the CBC, an inert gas heated by the reactor drives a turboalternator, rejects excess heat to space through a heat exchanger, and returns to the reactor in a closed loop configuration. The use of the CBC for space power and propulsion is described in more detail in the literature (Mason, 2003). In the CBC system just described, the process fluid is a high pressure inert gas such as argon, krypton, or a helium-xenon mixture. Due to the closed loop nature of the system and the associated potential for damage to components in the system, contamination of the working fluid is intolerable. Since a potential source of contamination is the lubricant used in conventional turbomachinery bearings, Gas Foil Bearings (GFB) have high potential for the rotor support system. GFBs are compliant, hydrodynamic journal and thrust bearings that use a gas, such as the CBC working fluid, as their lubricant. Thus, GFBs eliminate the possibility of contamination due to lubricant leaks into the closed loop system. Gas foil bearings are currently used in many commercial applications, both terrestrial and aerospace. Aircraft <b>Air</b> <b>Cycle</b> <b>Machines</b> (ACMs) and ground-based microturbines have demonstrated histories of successful long-term operation using GFBs (Heshmat et al., 2000).

40|$|The ECS and the {{anti-ice}} {{systems are}} two of the energy consumers for an aircraft; they absorb together two times the sum of the power of all the other systems (electrical, mechanical and hydraulic). More efficient ECSs and a more efficient anti-ice sub-systems would reduce the aircraft fuel consumption increasing the operative radius of the vehicle and also increasing the maximum useful load. The anti-ice sub-system is not only a key energy consumer {{but it is also a}} system critical for the flight safety: a failure of this system means a mission abort and the landing on the nearest airport. This thesis presents the results of several mathematical models which have been developed to study the performance of the aforementioned systems and the strategies to reduce their impacts on the aircraft fuel consumption. The models have been developed using AMEsim and Simulink. In particular a mathematical model, which describes the behavior of the inline pneumatic valves, have been created. The model uses the fundamental thermodynamic and mechanical differential equations to simulate the dynamic behavior of the valves. The mathematical model reproduces the results of the experimental tests within their uncertainty. The validated model has been used to explore the behavior of the valve and its own subcomponents proposing two possible solutions to increase the operative range of the valves and to decrease the influence of the pressure and temperature on the regulated pressure. The second detailed mathematical model created calculates the performance of the plate and wavy fins compact heat exchangers. The model, based on the work of Kays & London, includes some improvements related to the description heat exchanger geometry and related to the empirical correlations used to calculate the number of Stanton. The tests performed on three different heat exchangers have been used to validated the developed model; the mathematical model is able to predict the performance of the performance of the HXs with an accuracy compatible with most the industrial applications. The developed detailed models have been used to simulate the behavior of the system where they are installed. The behavior of an anti-ice system at extreme high bleed air temperature has been analyzed. An innovative architecture for anti-ice system is studied and the benefits on aircraft fuel consumption for a standard day mission are shown. The performance of an reverse Brayton-Joule cycle has been analyzed and a new possible control strategy based on a line installed in series to the <b>air</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>machine</b> is proposed. The limits of the proposed architecture are exposed studying the case of a system used to cool some electronic equipment. The benefits of the use of a reverse Brayton-Joule system which does not use the air bled from the engine (bleedless approach) are detailed with particular attention to the gain in terms of fuel penalty. The thesis ends with the results of the VCS simulations. Some technical solutions to fit a fixed displacement compressor architecture into an aircraft are explained; the solutions are oriented to increase the reliability of the compressor avoiding a continuous switch on and off even with low heat loads. A variable displacement compressor improves the overall efficiency of the system on a full mission profile (high COP in the cruise phase). Two strategies, one for passenger compartments and one for electronic cooling, which are able to expand the working envelope (in terms of minimum heat load) of the variable displacement compressor architecture are proposed...|$|E
40|$|Compliant foil air {{bearings}} are at {{the forefront}} of the Oil-Free turbomachinery revolution, which supports gas turbine engines with hydrodynamic bearings that use air instead of oil as the working fluid. These types of bearings have been around for almost 50 years and have found a home in several commercial applications, such as in <b>air</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>machines,</b> turbocompressors, and microturbines, but are now being aggressively pursued for use in small and midrange aircraft gas turbine engines. Benefits include higher operating speeds and temperatures, lower maintenance costs, and greater reliability. The Oil-Free Turbomachinery team at the NASA Glenn Research Center is working to foster the transition of Oil-Free technology into gas turbine engines by performing in-house experiments on foil air bearings in order to gain a greater insight into their complex operating principles. A research program recently undertaken at Glenn focused on the concept of radial clearance and its influence on bearing performance. The tests were conducted on foil bearings with different radial clearances. As defined for a foil bearing, radial clearance is a measure of the small amount of shaft radial motion that is present from play that exists in the elastic support structure, such as between the top and bump foils and the bump foils and bearing shell (see the drawing). With an insufficient amount of radial clearance, the bearing imparts a high preload on the shaft, which when excessive, can reduce the loadcarrying capability of the bearing. On the other hand, systems using foil bearings with excessive radial clearance may experience rotordynamic instabilities because of low bearing preload. Therefore, without a more thorough understanding of radial clearance, it is difficult to accurately predict the performance of a given bearing design. The test program demonstrated that there is a direct correlation between radial clearance and the performance of foil air bearings. As shown in the graph, an optimum radial clearance exists that will maximize the amount of load that the bearing is capable of supporting. With respect to this optimum, two different performance regimes were observed that are a function of the amount of radial clearance. Tests showed that bearings with radial clearances below the optimum in regime I were susceptible to sudden seizure, a failure mode indicative of thermal runaway caused by high preload. The high preload is in response to an insufficient amount of radial clearance available to accommodate the thermal growth of the bearing and shaft. However, radial clearances greater than the optimum in regime II resulted in low bearing preloads that did not cause any heat-related problems, and the failure mode was due to fluid-film breakdown. In fact, bearings operating with radial clearances twice as much as the optimum suffered a decrease in the maximum load capacity of only about 20 percent. Therefore, special attention has to be given to the range of operating conditions expected in the bearing/shaft system since changes in temperature, centrifugal, and hydrodynamic effects can all affect radial clearance. This enhanced understanding of foil air bearing behavior will greatly aid our efforts to transition Oil-Free technology to future aircraft engines...|$|R
40|$|A {{new test}} rig has been {{developed}} for simulating high-speed turbomachinery shafting using Oil-Free foil air bearing technology. Foil air journal bearings are self-acting hydrodynamic bearings with a flexible inner sleeve surface using air as the lubricant. These bearings {{have been used in}} turbomachinery, primarily <b>air</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>machines,</b> for the past four decades to eliminate the need for oil lubrication. More recently, interest has been growing in applying foil bearings to aircraft gas turbine engines. They offer potential improvements in efficiency and power density, decreased maintenance costs, and other secondary benefits. The goal of applying foil air bearings to aircraft gas turbine engines prompted the fabrication of this test rig. The facility enables bearing designers to test potential bearing designs with shafts that simulate the rotating components of a target engine without the high cost of building actual flight hardware. The data collected from this rig {{can be used to make}} changes to the shaft and bearings in subsequent design iterations. The rest of this article describes the new test rig and demonstrates some of its capabilities with an initial simulated shaft system. The test rig has two support structures, each housing a foil air journal bearing. The structures are designed to accept any size foil journal bearing smaller than 63 mm (2. 5 in.) in diameter. The bearing support structures are mounted to a 91 - by 152 -cm (3 - by 5 -ft) table and can be separated by as much as 122 cm (4 ft) and as little as 20 cm (8 in.) to accommodate a wide range of shaft sizes. In the initial configuration, a 9. 5 -cm (3. 75 -in.) impulse air turbine drives the test shaft. The impulse turbine, as well as virtually any number of "dummy" compressor and turbine disks, can be mounted on the shaft inboard or outboard of the bearings. This flexibility allows researchers to simulate various engine shaft configurations. The bearing support structures include a unique bearing mounting fixture that rotates to accommodate a laserbased alignment system. This can measure the misalignment of the bearing centers in each of 2 translational degrees of freedom and 2 rotational degrees of freedom. In the initial configuration, with roughly a 30. 5 -cm- (12 -in. -) long shaft, two simulated aerocomponent disks, and two 50. 8 -cm (2 -in.) foil journal bearings, the rig can operate at 65, 000 rpm at room temperature. The test facility can measure shaft displacements in both the vertical and horizontal directions at each bearing location. Horizontal and vertical structural vibrations are monitored using accelerometers mounted on the bearing support structures. This information is used to determine system rotordynamic response, including critical speeds, mode shapes, orbit size and shape, and potentially the onset of instabilities. Bearing torque can be monitored as well to predict the power loss in the foil bearings. All of this information is fed back and forth between NASA and the foil bearing designers in an iterative fashion to converge on a final bearing and shaft design for a given engine application. In addition to its application development capabilities, the test rig offers several unique capabilities for basic bearing research. Using the laser alignment system mentioned earlier, the facility will be used to map foil air journal bearing performance. A known misalignment of increasing severity will be induced to determine the sensitivity of foil bearings to misalignment. Other future plans include oil-free integral starter generator testing and development, and dynamic load testing of foil journal bearings...|$|R

40|$|Many {{advances}} in technology are expected to increase the capabilities of next generation aircraft, and these advances will increase the thermal load on the aircraft as well. In order to assess and account for these increased thermal loads, three studies were performed: a fuel pump trade study, a high energy pulsed system (HEPS) implementation study, and a legacy vehicle environmental control system (ECS) study. The fuel pump study addresses {{the effect of the}} implementation of a centrifugal fuel pump versus a variable displacement fuel pump. Traditionally, aircraft designers have used a centrifugal fuel pump over a piston based pump based primarily on mass, volume, cost, and reliability. This study considers specific excess power (SEP), fuel burn and thermal margin and shows the piston based pump performing superior mainly because it eliminates fuel recirculation resulting in an increased thermal margin. This investigation demonstrates the benefit of capturing component level models and thermal concerns in the conceptual design process. Both of these issues are vital to the development of future aircraft designs. Additional research needs to be completed to compare both pumps based on the mass and volume of each system. The second study investigates the implementation of a HEPS device at an air vehicle level. HEPS generate excessive amounts of heat during operation, creating challenges in how to integrate them into an aircraft without overwhelming the vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s power and thermal management systems (TMS). In order to evaluate the impact of the HEPS electrical and thermal load on the aircraft 2 ̆ 7 s mission, a vehicle level modeling and simulation (M 2 ̆ 6 S) effort must be executed of the power and thermal management systems. To accurately evaluate the total effect on the aircraft, the HEPS must be integrated into a Tip to Tail (T 2 T) model of the system that includes the aircraft power and thermal management subsystems. With the HEPS system integrated into the T 2 T model, not only can its mass and volume effects be analyzed, but also the transient power and thermal loads created by the new system can be evaluated for their effect on other aircraft subsystems. Furthermore, the aircraft subsystems can be optimized to vehicle level metrics instead of subsystem level only. This will result in a more effective and balanced overall aircraft design. Using a T 2 T model to evaluate the integration of a HEPS system on an aircraft will enable assessment of its overall impact to next generation aircraft. Therefore, the significant impact of highly dynamic power and thermal loads on next generation aircraft is addressed. The third study is the implementation of an air cycle based ECS in a legacy (4 th generation) air vehicle. Relatively few {{attempts have been made to}} define appropriate validation testing constructs for T 2 T analysis in a transient mode of operation. Current research addresses the process of validation testing using legacy aircraft systems in order to acquire relevant data that will lead to the validation of existing models, and different modeling methods. The model developed in this work will eventually be utilized in these validation efforts at a later date. To this end, an air vehicle system (AVS), turbine engine, generator, and environmental control system (ECS) have been modeled in a T 2 T model of the actual legacy system. In particular, this study will focus on the creation and integration of the ECS model. The ECS uses an <b>air</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>machine,</b> which utilizes a Brayton refrigeration cycle to cool the air to the cockpit and avionics. The ECS model will be shown to successfully cool these components while subjected to varying bleed rates from the turbine engine...|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the recent}} concern about the damage that CFCs cause to the {{environment}} (ozone layer, global warming) {{and the absence of}} commonly acceptable alternative refrigerants, the search for alternative refrigeration concepts is going on. Air as refrigerant in the Joule-Brayton <b>cycle</b> (<b>air</b> <b>cycle)</b> {{is one of the most}} natural refrigerants, and it meets all criteria for a refrigerant being environmentally benign. For this reason the <b>air</b> <b>cycle</b> is one of the most promising long-term alternatives for refrigeration machines, air conditioners and heat pumps. TNO has gained much knowledge and experience on the <b>air</b> <b>cycle</b> concept within the framework of European research projects...|$|R

40|$|<b>Air</b> <b>cycle</b> {{heat pump}} has large {{potentials}} in heating applications. However, a key challenge faced nowadays is the matching problem between its expander and compressor. This paper presents the performance evaluation of an <b>air</b> <b>cycle</b> {{heat pump system}} integrated with a turbocharger, a blower and a regenerated heat exchanger. A thermodynamic model for this system is first developed and {{the relationships between the}} system performance and the operating parameters are investigated. Then, the performance of three different <b>air</b> <b>cycle</b> heat pumps with a blower installed before the compressor, and a blower installed before the turbine, and with an expander, are numerically simulated. The results indicated that the blower installed before the compressor can achieve a higher heating capacity and thus a higher COP. Finally, the heating power consumption of <b>air</b> <b>cycle</b> heat pump was compared with the PTC and the vapor compression heat pump of the full electric vehicle...|$|R
