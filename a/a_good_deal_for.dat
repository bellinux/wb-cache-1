500|$|The major {{departure}} of the 1997–98 season for Arsenal was midfielder Paul Merson, who joined Middlesbrough in a £4.5million deal, replacing Juninho. Wenger said of the move, [...] "You are never happy to lose a player of his calibre but it is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>for</b> him and for the club." [...] Middlesbrough intended to sign David Platt, but a move never came to fruition, as talks broke down between both parties. Defender Matthew Rose and goalkeeper Lee Harper joined Queens Park Rangers for a combined fee of £750,000.|$|E
500|$|During Grant's first {{four-year}} term, Hanna {{began to}} involve himself in politics. [...] At first his interest was purely local, supporting Republican candidates for municipal and Cuyahoga County offices. [...] In 1869, {{he was elected}} to the Cleveland Board of Education, but as he was traveling <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>for</b> business at the time, was able to attend less than half the meetings. [...] In 1873, disgusted by local scandals and the influence of party bosses, he and other Republicans briefly abandoned the party to elect a Democrat running for mayor of Cleveland on a reform agenda.|$|E
500|$|Like {{previous}} performers, Madonna was {{not paid}} for the show. According to Zack O'Malley Greenburg of Forbes, [...] "Typically, the entertainers for the Super Bowl do not get a cash payment ... This {{is the kind of}} exposure that entertainers would give their right arm for; they could do 20 Leno and Letterman appearances and still not reach that [...] audience". Greenburg wrote that with 30-second commercial spots commanding over $3 million apiece, the 12 minutes of free television exposure had a total value of $84 million for Madonna's enterprises and the singer did not have to pay for accommodations, travel, backup dancers, stage setup, advertising and publicity: [...] "Given all these benefits, playing the Super Bowl halftime show for free is more than worth the trouble. In fact, it's incredibly lucrative– and such <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>for</b> artists that some suspect a major change might be on the horizon".|$|E

500|$|Versus {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 65, based on 6 reviews. Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly gave it an [...] "A–" [...] {{and said that}} [...] "'Love 'Em All' describes an egalitarian sexual appetite, while 'Lingerie' offers prime faux-Prince boudoir funk. The Max Martin-produced 'DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love' shows 'OMG' didn't satisfy Usher's dance-pop Jones, but he's hardly gone soft: 'Hot Tottie,' with Jay-Z, is nasty {{in all the right}} ways." [...] Sarah Rodman of The Boston Globe complimented its [...] "compact running time" [...] and stated [...] "Instead of ho-hum filler, Versus offers the strongest arrows in Usher’s quiver". About.com's Mark Edward Nero gave the EP three-and-a-half out of five stars and wrote that Usher has [...] "regained his mojo", while recommending it to fans of his music: [...] "nine songs - seven of them new - clocking in at 38 minutes is <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>for</b> this solid package of music." [...] Steve Jones of USA Today gave Versus three out of four stars and called it [...] "an abbreviated batch of fresh songs that can stand alone or as part of a deluxe original". Billboards Gail Mitchell commended the album's guest artists and wrote that it [...] "alternately bumps and throbs as a reinvigorated Usher further paves his comeback path" ...|$|E
2500|$|Lantos {{supported}} Morocco's {{demand to}} gain sovereignty over Western Sahara, and criticized the Polisario Front, which demands independence for the disputed region. In 2007, he backed Morocco's proposal {{to make the}} region autonomous under Moroccan rule, saying: [...] "I urge {{the leadership of the}} Polisario to realize that they will never again get such <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>for</b> the population they purport to represent." ...|$|E
2500|$|In late August 2006, {{an outside}} {{panel of experts}} judged that Bombardier's offer was <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> <b>for</b> city, with one {{consultant}} saying that the proposed bid [...] "is below most of the recent comparable North American procurements." [...] In {{the aftermath of the}} report, councillor Glenn De Baeremaeker was quoted as saying, [...] "if what you have told me [...] is true, somebody owes Howard Moscoe an apology". The TTC staff have also recommended finalizing a deal with Bombardier. Some councillors, such as Karen Stintz, have continued to oppose the contract on procedural grounds. Stintz has said, [...] "it's not about Bombardier. It's about a process we didn't follow", noting that other city departments require competitive bids on contracts of this size.|$|E

60|$|Uncle Henry and Aunt Em waited downstairs. They were uneasy and <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>deal</b> excited, <b>for</b> {{this is a}} {{practical}} humdrum world, {{and it seemed to}} them quite impossible that their little niece could vanish from her home and travel instantly to fairyland.|$|R

5000|$|The {{ability to}} {{get that kind of}} size and scale became more {{appealing}} as we saw the business model change to a model we could accept," [...] Lewis said.
