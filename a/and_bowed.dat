5|$|Bowen and the Spurs {{bounced back}} {{and won the}} NBA title in 2005, {{defeating}} the Detroit Pistons. The Spurs could not win back-to-back titles, however, <b>and</b> <b>bowed</b> out 4–3 in a seven-game series against the Dallas Mavericks in the 2006 NBA Playoffs. As a testament to his controversial style of play, Bowen picked up a $10,000 NBA fine for kicking Ray Allen in the back during a March 2006 game.|$|E
5|$|In the 1957–58 NBA season, Cousy had {{yet another}} highly {{productive}} year, with his 20.0 points, 5.5 rebounds and 8.6 assists per game leading to nominations into the All-NBA First Team and the All-Star team. He again led the NBA in assists. The Celtics reached the 1958 NBA Finals against the Hawks, but when Russell succumbed to a foot injury in Game 3, the Celtics faded <b>and</b> <b>bowed</b> out four games to two. This {{was the last}} losing NBA playoff series in which Cousy would play.|$|E
5|$|In July 2010, Henry {{signed a}} multi-year {{contract}} with Major League Soccer (MLS) club New York Red Bulls for the 2010 season as its second designated player. He made his full MLS debut on 31 July in a 2–2 draw against Houston Dynamo, assisting both goals to Juan Pablo Ángel. His first MLS goal came on 28 August in a 2–0 victory against San Jose Earthquakes. The Red Bulls eventually topped the MLS Eastern Conference by one point over Columbus Crew before losing 3–2 on aggregate against San Jose Earthquakes in the quarter-finals of the 2010 MLS Cup Playoffs. The next season, the Red Bulls were 10th {{overall in the}} league, <b>and</b> <b>bowed</b> out in the Conference semi-finals of the 2011 MLS Cup Playoffs.|$|E

5|$|The {{team was}} in the {{national}} rankings all season and ended as the 2011–12 Big Ten co-champion with Michigan State and Ohio State. It had three victories over teams {{ranked in the top}} 10 {{at the time of the}} meeting (eighth-ranked Memphis, ninth-ranked Michigan State and sixth-ranked Ohio State). The team was undefeated at home until its last home game of the season. Michigan lost in the semifinals of the 2012 Big Ten Conference Tournament <b>and</b> <b>bowed</b> out in the second round of the 2012 NCAA Tournament to end the season with a 24–10 record. The team won the school's first Big Ten Conference Championship since the 1985–86 season and had the school's best Big Ten record (13–5) since the 1993–94 season.|$|E
5|$|The {{recall of}} Sir William Hamilton to Britain was a further {{incentive}} for Nelson to return, although {{he and the}} Hamiltons initially sailed from Naples on a brief cruise around Malta aboard the Foudroyant in April 1800. It was on this voyage that Horatio and Emma's illegitimate daughter Horatia was probably conceived. After the cruise, Nelson conveyed the Queen of Naples and her suite to Leghorn. On his arrival, Nelson shifted his flag to , but again disobeyed Keith's orders by refusing to join the main fleet. Keith came to Leghorn in person to demand an explanation, and refused to be moved by the Queen's pleas {{to allow her to}} be conveyed in a British ship. In the face of Keith's demands, Nelson reluctantly struck his flag <b>and</b> <b>bowed</b> to Emma Hamilton's request to return to England over land.|$|E
5|$|During the 2000 Copa Libertadores, Boca Juniors {{returned}} {{to the top of}} the continent and raised the Copa Libertadores again after 22 years. Led by Carlos Bianchi, the Virrey, along with outstanding players like Mauricio Serna, Jorge Bermúdez, Óscar Córdoba, Juan Roman Riquelme, and Martín Palermo, among others, revitalized the club to establish it among the world's best. The Xeneizes started this legacy by defeating defending champion Palmeiras in the final series. Boca Juniors won the 2001 edition after, once again, defeating Palmeiras in the semifinals and Cruz Azul in the final series to successfully defend the trophy. Cruz Azul became the first ever Mexican club to reach the final after great performances against River Plate and an inspired Rosario Central. Like their predecessors from the late 1970s however, Boca Juniors would fall short of winning three consecutive titles. As with Juan Carlos Lorenzo's men, the Xeneizes became frustrated as they were eliminated by Olimpia, this time during the quarterfinals. Led by World Cup winner-turned manager Nery Pumpido, Olimpia would overcome Grêmio (after some controversy) and surprise finalists São Caetano. Despite this triumph, Olimpia did not create the winning mystique of its past golden generations <b>and</b> <b>bowed</b> out in the round of 16 the following season, after being routed by Grêmio 6–2, avenging their controversial loss from the year before.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} {{image of}} a musical ensemble is found on the 8th century Borobudur temple, Central Java. Musical instruments such as the bamboo flute, bells, drums in various sizes, lute, <b>and</b> <b>bowed</b> and plucked string instruments were identified in this image. However it lacks metallophones and xylophones. Nevertheless, the image of this musical ensemble is suggested to be the ancient form of the gamelan.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} stringed {{instruments were}} mostly plucked (for example, the Greek lyre). Two-stringed, bowed instruments, played upright and strung <b>and</b> <b>bowed</b> with horsehair, may have {{originated in the}} nomadic equestrian cultures of Central Asia, in forms closely resembling the modern-day Mongolian Morin huur and the Kazakh Kobyz. Similar and variant types were probably disseminated along East-West trading routes from Asia into the Middle East, and the Byzantine Empire.|$|E

25|$|The French ruled Vietnam {{completely}} by 1884 {{and set up}} a system of modern education. The population was exposed to French culture and music, which included the mandolin. The influence of French culture was strong enough to affect Vietnamese music. They began writing lyrics to French pop music in Vietnamese and teaching themselves other western instruments including mandolin, guitar, Hawaiian guitar and banjo. Through the Catholics and later the conservatories, European classical music and instruments were taught, including piano <b>and</b> <b>bowed</b> instruments.|$|E

25|$|East {{and north}} of this {{transition}} zone are the expansive and sparsely populated Northern Plains, with tableland prairies, smaller island mountain ranges, and badlands. The isolated island ranges east of the Divide include the Bear Paw Mountains, Bull Mountains, Castle Mountains, Crazy Mountains, Highwood Mountains, Judith Mountains, Little Belt Mountains, Little Rocky Mountains, the Pryor Mountains, Snowy Mountains, Sweet Grass Hills, and—in the state's southeastern corner near Ekalaka—the Long Pines. Many of these isolated eastern ranges were created about 120 to 66 million years ago when magma welling up from the interior cracked <b>and</b> <b>bowed</b> the earth's surface here.|$|E

25|$|After Paramount {{purchased}} {{the rights to}} the novella for Wilder, the next step was a screenplay. The material was widely regarded around Hollywood as unfilmable due to its iniquitous characters and the restrictions imposed by the Motion Picture Production Code. Although he had worked on the treatment, Charles Brackett decided it was too sordid <b>and</b> <b>bowed</b> out of the project, leaving Wilder to find another collaborator. His first choice, James M. Cain himself, was already working for another studio and unavailable (although Cain claimed he was never asked). Producer Joseph Sistrom, an avid reader and an admirer of The Big Sleep, then suggested Raymond Chandler.|$|E
25|$|Not long afterward, {{during the}} heat of the day, Abraham had been sitting at the {{entrance}} of his tent by the terebinths of Mamre. He looked up and saw three men in the presence of God. Then he ran <b>and</b> <b>bowed</b> to the ground to welcome them. Abraham then offered to wash their feet and fetch them a morsel of bread, to which they assented. Abraham rushed to Sarah's tent to order cakes made from choice flour, then he ordered a servant-boy to prepare a choice calf.

On the third day of the fourth month, the Karmapa reached the border between Tibet and the Nashi kingdom.
