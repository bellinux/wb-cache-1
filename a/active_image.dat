5000|$|Different artistic styles {{may also}} be {{processed}} differently by the brain. In a study between filtered forms of abstract and representation art, the bilateral occipital gyri, left cingulate sulcus, and bilateral fusiform gyrus showed increased activation with increased preference when viewing art. [...] However, activation in the bilateral occipital gyri {{may be caused by}} the large processing requirements placed on the visual system when viewing high levels of visual detail in artwork such as representational paintings. [...] Several areas of the brain have been shown to respond particularly to forms representational art perhaps due to the brain's ability to make object associations and other functions relating to attention and memory. This form of stimuli leads to increased activation in the left frontal lobe and bilaterally in the parietal and limbic lobes. Also, the left superior parietal lobule, Brodmann's area 7, has been shown {{to play a role in}} <b>active</b> <b>image</b> construction during the viewing of art specifically containing indeterminate forms such as soft edge paintings. [...] Bottom up processes such as edge detection and the exploration of visual stimuli are engaged during this type of aesthetic perception. These roles are consistent with previously known parietal lobe responsibilities in spatial cognition and visual imagery.|$|E

We focus on identifying regions of sustained change for recognising key stages of a visual behaviour. Our behaviour representation is based on the asynchrony or delay patterns of occurrence among local events which need not be spatially connected. We use an automatic Normalised Cut structure discovery algorithm with a hybrid similarity criteria for simultaneously identifying relevant spatiotemporal subspaces and clustering similar behaviour patterns in those subspaces. We compare the automatically discovered classes with conceptual classes of behaviours in a semi-constrained “Shopping ” scenario. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: An {{effective}} compression artifacts removal {{algorithm is}} proposed based on thin-plate spline interpolation and the theory of projections onto convex sets (POCS). The thin-plate spline model is used to model the luminance in the flat regions of the image. Adaptive projections are used to suppress the compression artifacts in the spatially <b>active</b> <b>image</b> regions. The algorithm includes block mapping, prediction of the spatial distribution of the quantization error and estimation of the visibility of the compression artifacts. Information obtained from the transform domain {{is used in the}} thin-plate interpolation phase. The adaptive projections use information from both the spatial and transform domains. Experiments performed with JPEG-compressed images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in suppressing the compression artifacts, along with its ability for preserving the image sharpness...|$|E

40|$|Micro aerial {{vehicles}} (MAVs) {{equipped with}} cameras provide {{a new perspective}} on the world. As MAVs have found important roles in industrial and recreational applications, they are actively studied in the research community. The focus has been the autonomy level. In other words, the MAV should be able to perform tasks autonomously to free human from laborious and risky work. At the basis of an autonomous system, there is the problem of autonomous navigation. In outdoor spaces, MAVs usually use GPS signals for self-localization. In indoor GPS-denied environments, autonomous navigation of MAVs is still an open research question. At the high level of an autonomous system, there is the problem of active sensing. An autonomous platform needs to actively optimize its navigation based on its current state and the environment. The constraints of vision sensors and complex environments pose challenges to this task. In this thesis, we propose our solutions to the two problems: vision based navigation and active sensing. In {{the first half of the}} thesis, we propose solutions of vision based navigation on two platforms. First, we present an ultra-light and -small MAV platform which can perform autonomous navigation in an unknown indoor environment. Secondly, we aim at a toy MAV. Accurate path following is achieved using the camera as the major sensor. In the second half, we address the active sensing problem in two interesting applications. We first investigate the active target sensing and following using a multi-robot collaborative system. The only sensors are cameras and the constraints of vision algorithms are taken into consideration while we design the motion controller. Lastly, we demonstrate an <b>active</b> <b>image</b> data acquisition system in the image based modeling application. The camera placement is optimized in the loop and online feedback is provided for the sensor planning. We demonstrate the fully autonomous <b>active</b> <b>image</b> based modeling system in simulated, indoor and outdoor environments...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the Ssair (Semi-Supervised <b>Active</b> <b>Image</b> Re-trieval) approach, which {{attempts}} to exploit unlabeled data {{to improve the}} performance of content-based image retrieval (Cbir), is proposed. This approach combines the merits of semi-supervised learning and ac-tive learning. In detail, in each round of relevance feedback, two simple learners are trained from the labeled data, i. e. images from user query and user feedback. Each learner then classifies the unlabeled images in the database and passes the most relevant/irrelevant images to the other learner. After re-training with the additional labeled data, the learners classify the images in the database again and then their classifications are merged. Images judged to be relevant with high confidence are returned as the retrieval result, while these judged with low confidence are put into the pool which {{is used in the}} next round of relevance feedback. Ex-periments show that semi-supervised learning and active learning mech-anisms are both beneficial to Cbir. ...|$|E

We consider cases where the illumination intensity is uniform on the scene and when it is not, and we take into account different parametrizations of the DOP. In all cases, we determine the Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimators and compare their variances with the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound for unbiased estimation. When illumination is not uniform, the ML estimators are solutions of equations that have to be solved numerically. We show that simpler estimators based on the trimmed mean make it possible to approach performance of ML estimators at lower computational cost...|$|R
