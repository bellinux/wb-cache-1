25|$|Two Cardinal runs came in {{the second}} on an unusual two-run {{sacrifice}} fly by Tom Herr, with Willie McGee and Ozzie Smith scoring. With Willie McGee on first and attempting to steal, Brewers catcher Ted Simmons took a pitch-out but bobbled the ball allowing McGee to steal second. After a walk to Ozzie Smith, Moose Haas’ wild pitch moved McGee to third and Smith to second. On Herr's deep sacrifice fly, Smith took advantage of center fielder Gorman Thomas slipping and falling on the warning track. Ken Oberkfell followed with a walk, stole second <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> when a Keith Hernandez grounder went through Gantner's legs. The Cardinals scored three times despite only one base hit.|$|E
25|$|The {{next season}} the team failed to finish {{any of the}} first three races, but on June 18, 1967, Gurney took a {{historic}} victory in the Belgian Grand Prix. Starting {{in the middle of the}} first row, Gurney initially followed Jim Clark's Lotus and the BRM of Jackie Stewart. A muffed start left Gurney deep in the field at the end of the first lap. Throughout the race, Gurney's Westlake V-12 suffered a high-speed misfire, but he was able to continue racing. Jim Clark encountered problems on Lap 12 that dropped him down to ninth position. Having moved up to second spot, Gurney set the fastest lap of the race on Lap 19. Two laps later he and his Eagle took the lead <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> over a minute ahead of Stewart.|$|E
25|$|The Stanley Cup Finals {{were against}} the Edmonton Oilers, {{the first time}} in NHL history that two former WHA franchises had played against one another in the finals. The Hurricanes rallied from a 3–0 deficit in Game 1 to win 5–4 after Rod Brind'Amour scored with 30 seconds left. In Game 2, the Hurricanes shelled the Oilers 5–0 to take a two-game lead. The Oilers won Game 3 in Edmonton, 2–1, as Ryan Smyth scored the game-winning goal with 2:47 left to play. Carolina rebounded in Game 4 with a 2–1 victory, <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> with a chance to win the Cup on home ice. However, Game 5 saw the Oilers come back with a {{stunning}} 4–3 overtime win on a shorthanded breakaway by Fernando Pisani. In Game 6 in Edmonton, Carolina was soundly defeated 4–0; the only bright point for the Hurricanes was the return of forward Erik Cole from a broken neck that had sidelined him since March. In Game 7, before the second-largest home crowd in franchise history (18,978), the Hurricanes won 3–1, sealing the Hurricanes' first Stanley Cup championship in franchise history. Ward was honored with the Conn Smythe Trophy for the playoffs' most valuable player, becoming just the fourth rookie to be honored with the award. Several Hurricanes raised the Cup for {{the first time in}} their long NHL careers; Rod Brind'Amour and Bret Hedican had both played over 15 years without winning the Cup, while Glen Wesley – the last remaining Hartford Whaler on the Hurricanes' roster – had waited 18 seasons.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reaction}} to this iteration of the Dalton saga was sharp. [...] Drew Fetherston, reviewing the movie for Newsday, called it [...] "claptrap" [...] and that [...] "action [...] is all that this NBC stinker has to offer". Faye Zuckerman of the Gainesville Sun called Dalton: Code of Vengeance II a [...] "plodder", complaining that [...] "this film insults its predecessor". Chicago Sun-Times reviewer Daniel Ruth gave Dalton: Code of Vengeance II a half-star review calling it [...] "revisionist", [...] "distasteful", and [...] "terrible television". Deriding the film as [...] "poorly written, badly acted, sloppily directed and choppily edited", he called it [...] "another {{slap in the face}} of the men and women who went to Southeast Asia to do a dirty job <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> to even dirtier exploitation". Ruth concluded, [...] "The viewer's best [...] "Code of Vengeance" [...] would be to reject these films." ...|$|E

Hollis had previously worked with music artists like Lil Wayne, The Throne, Eminem and Jennifer Lopez. [...] "Watch n' Learn" [...] wasn't originally meant for any particular artist when Hit-Boy started to work on it. In an interview with Jocelyn Vena from MTV News he explained: [...] "I was at the studio with this amazing [...] Priscilla Renea, and I {{was going to tell}} her to go home, but I was like, 'Stay here and see if you could come up with an idea for this '". Renea previously penned Rihanna's 2011 single [...] "California King Bed" [...] (Loud, 2010). Hollis further explained that by the time he left the studio <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>home,</b> Renea already sent him the idea and concept for the song through IChat. He was eventually satisfied with it and sent the song to Rihanna, in which her team [...] "went crazy" [...] when they heard it.

500|$|The third season, {{which was}} filmed in 1983 and {{consisted}} of 130 half-hour episodes, had different goals than the previous seasons. [...] One of its goals was instructing its viewers and their families about basic hygiene, [...] "a matter of critical importance {{in an area of}} the world where gastrointestinal diseases abound and infant mortality rates are high". [...] The third season of the show included characters created to [...] "expose young Latin American children to both traditional and nontraditional role models". [...] The producers created characters that demonstrated family diversity, in order to fulfill their curriculum goal of presenting more egalitarian lifestyles by modeling overcoming stereotypes, demonstrating different career options for both men and women, and exhibiting the sharing of household responsibilities. [...] They cast performers in two different families. [...] The first family was more traditional {{and consisted of}} a middle-aged couple named Tono, a mechanic (played by Maurico Herrara), and Alicia, a public health nurse (Alicia de Bari), who had two children. [...] The adults in the second family were young working professionals; the wife was a veterinarian and the husband was a music teacher who worked from home. [...] Other human characters included: Jose, a shopkeeper and his young assistant, a student named Mercedes (Xochiti Vigil): a truck driver played by Tony Diaz; and a pilot (Fernando Balzaretti), who travelled throughout Latin American <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> to tell his adventures to his friends on the plaza.

2500|$|In 1972, Warnke's book The Satan Seller was released. Written by Warnke, {{with help}} from Balsiger and Les Jones, the book tells of Warnke being {{orphaned}} {{as a child and}} his introduction into Satanism. Further detailed is Warnke's participation in sexual orgies, alcoholism, and drug dealing; his rise in the ranks of Satanism to the level of [...] "high priest"; presiding over Satanic rituals including magical spells, summoning demons, ritual sex including a ritual kidnap and rape; the attempt on his life [...] a heroin overdose [...] that left him angry and disillusioned; his heroism in Vietnam; and how he found Jesus <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> as an evangelist. The story ends with Warnke living happily in California with wife Sue Studer. In fewer than three months after the release, The Satan Seller had become a religious best-seller.|$|E
2500|$|The {{project was}} {{revealed}} by Hayes in a PR launch in Detroit {{at the end}} of 1965, but the engine was not ready until the third race of the 1967 season, on the 4 June at Zandvoort. [...] Its debut proved electric. Graham Hill, who was in the team at the specific request of Ford and Hayes, put his DFV-powered Lotus 49 on pole position by half a second and led for the first 10 laps but was then sidelined by a broken gear in the camshaft drive. Team-mate Jim Clark moved up through the field in his identical car <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> to win. However, this dominant performance belied a serious fault in the timing gear. Clark took three more wins that season, but reliability problems left him third in the Drivers' Championship, 10 points behind Champion Denny Hulme. The progress of the engine was documented in a film produced by the Ford Motor Company's film section, entitled [...] "9 Days in Summer".|$|E
2500|$|Children usually {{left the}} local school for Forfar Academy {{at the age of}} 14, and with his father a teacher, Neill was {{especially}} expected to do so. Instead of wasting time and money, Neill went to work as a junior clerk in an Edinburgh gas meter factory. His parents took pity on his hatred of the job, homesickness, and its low pay, and so Neill became an apprentice draper in Forfar. He found the work stultifying <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> after a foot inflammation. Neill tried to take an examination that would raise his pay grade, but could not bring himself to study. Now 15, his parents decided to make him his father's assistant [...] "pupil teacher". The children liked Neill, though he received poor marks from a school inspector. He taught a wider range of topics as his self-confidence grew, and he developed an interest in mathematics from the Forfar Academy maths master. After four years, he tried for teacher training college, but came nearly last in his class. He continued as a pupil teacher in Bonnyrigg and Kingskettle, where he found the teachers' instruction militant and loathsome. He stayed in Kingskettle for three years, during which he learned Greek from a local priest, an experience that increased his interest in academicism and sublimated his interest in priesthood into a desire to attend university. After studying with the priest and the Forfar math master, Neill passed his university entrance exam and preliminary teacher's certification.|$|E

[...] Lewis {{doubled in the}} bottom of the eighth, and then Fletcher's terrible day {{continued}} with his third error allowing Larry Gardner to reach base and Lewis to score. [...] This tied the game 5–5. [...] In the ninth, Boston reliever Charley Hall, who had replaced Ray Collins in the eighth, got the first two outs but proceeded to walk Snodgrass, Larry Doyle and Beals Becker consecutively. [...] But with the bases loaded, Red Murray grounded into a forceout and the Red Sox escaped. [...] Boston went quietly {{in the bottom of}} the ninth, setting up extra innings. [...] Fred Merkle led off the New York tenth with a triple and scored on a sacrifice fly to give the Giants a 6–5 lead. [...] Mathewson, who pitched the entire game for New York, came back to the mound {{in the bottom of the}} tenth with a chance to slam the door on Boston and even the Series at one game apiece, but Tris Speaker, who had hit [...]383 in the regular season, slammed an extra-base hit to center field. [...] Giant third baseman Buck Herzog deliberately collided with Speaker to prevent an inside-the-park home run, but Speaker got up <b>and</b> <b>came</b> <b>home</b> anyway. [...] Becker threw the ball in to cutoff man Tillie Shafer, who threw to the plate but catcher Art Wilson dropped the ball—for New York's fifth error of the game—and Speaker, who was credited with a triple on the play, scored to tie the game 6–6. [...] McGraw claimed, and reporters in the press box agreed, that Speaker had missed first base, but base umpire Cy Rigler ruled that he hadn't on appeal. [...] Lewis followed with a double to put the winning run in scoring position, but Mathewson retired Gardner and Stahl to escape the inning with a tie.|$|E
