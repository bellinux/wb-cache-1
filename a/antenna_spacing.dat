30|$|Size of {{the sensor}} might {{restrict}} {{the use of}} the number of antennas. For example, two antenna beamforming would require an antenna distance of 1.9 cm on 5 GHz band. Apart from lower interference in 5 GHz band compared to the 2.4 GHz band, the smaller <b>antenna</b> <b>spacing</b> is another important advantage. Hence for smaller sensors needing to use beamforming, it would be advantageous to use higher frequencies for smaller <b>antenna</b> <b>spacing.</b>|$|E
30|$|It is {{well known}} that when <b>antenna</b> <b>spacing</b> (AS) among {{elements}} is not large enough, there exists mutual coupling among the elements and their patterns are changed. In MIMO systems, due to the limitation of space, especially at mobile stations, the <b>antenna</b> <b>spacing</b> may be small. As a result, mutual coupling among antennas may be large, and this would affect the system performance. Thus, in this section, we consider the antenna pattern for a two-element linear array.|$|E

40|$|Optimal {{design of}} a linear antenna array at the base station is {{investigated}} for the uplink of a TDMA cellular system. The problem is formulated as the maximization of the (ergodic or outage) capacity and entails the trade-off between diversity gain (large <b>antenna</b> <b>spacing)</b> and interference-rejection capability of the array (small <b>antenna</b> <b>spacing).</b> In many applications the positions of user and interferers are not known a priori {{at the time of}} the antenna deployment or the terminals are mobile. Therefore, the optimization is carried out not only for a fixed positions of users and interferers, but also by averaging the capacity over the positions of users and interferers within their cells. The approach to the solution of this problem is twofold. At first, an approximate analytical closed form expression for the capacity as a function of the <b>antenna</b> <b>spacing</b> is derived. Then, the results so obtained are corroborated by optimizing the exact capacity though an extensive search over the optimization domain. 1...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The {{performance}} of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems {{is affected by}} the spatial correlation properties, which depend on the array configuration and the channel characteristics. The configuration can be influenced by manipulating the radiation patterns of the antennas, the <b>antenna</b> <b>spacing</b> and the array geometry. To decrease the spatial correlation effects, e. g., the <b>antenna</b> <b>spacing</b> can be increased, which is usually undesirable in mobile devices. Here, the utilization of polarization diversity techniques comes into consideration. This paper deals with the application and comparison of different polarized transmit/receive array setups in indoor environments using a multiple antenna demonstrator in uncoded adaptive MIMO-OFDM scenarios. Measurement results indicate a decreased correlation of the spatial subchannels, a higher MIMO capacity for cross-polarized antenna arrays and lower bit error rates with bit and power loading algorithms.
