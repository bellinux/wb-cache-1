50|$|The {{indirect}} method uses net-income {{as a starting}} point, makes adjustments for all transactions for non-cash items, then adjusts from all cash-based transactions. An increase in an asset account is subtracted from net income, {{and an increase in}} a liability account is added back to net income. This method converts accrual-basis net income (or loss) into cash flow by using a series of <b>additions</b> <b>and</b> <b>deductions.</b>|$|E
50|$|Following the Match Review Panel's findings, a player's base {{points are}} {{subjected}} {{to a series of}} <b>additions</b> <b>and</b> <b>deductions</b> (which are described in the next section) to arrive at a number of total demerit points. Each 100 total demerit points that a player finishes with then corresponds to a suspension for one match; e.g. a player who finished with 225 demerit points will receive a two-match suspension. If a player finishes with fewer than 100 demerit points, he is not suspended, but receives what is known as a reprimand.|$|E
50|$|Any {{reportable}} offence {{that occurs}} during a Grand Final match will receive an addition called the double penalty: {{equal to the}} offence's original base score {{as determined by the}} Match Review Panel. This addition is applied after the <b>additions</b> <b>and</b> <b>deductions</b> previously mentioned. This loading is meant to discourage excessively rough play encouraged because any penalties given as a result would not apply until the following season. A rough fight in the 2004 AFL Grand Final between Alastair Lynch and Darryl Wakelin resulted in the Tribunal handing down stiff penalties and adding the double penalty rule.|$|E

A general theory <b>and</b> our theoretical <b>deductions</b> from it must be tested with specific experiments designed to confirm or deny their truth; while these particular experiments may lead us to formulate new theories.|$|R
50|$|From a human {{resources}} viewpoint, the payroll department is critical because employees {{are sensitive to}} payroll errors and irregularities: Good employee morale requires payroll to be paid timely and accurately.

The result of 95 years of <b>additions,</b> subtractions, <b>deductions,</b> <b>and</b> exclusions, the 62,000 page tax code is so complex that many are voicing their desire to greatly simplify it or to even completely remove it. Currently, tax revenue cannot even pay for government spending. The film follows the progression of taxation through wars, economic booms, and significant presidencies in U.S. history. An Inconvenient Tax includes commentary {{from some of the}} nation's best-known economic experts, commentators, and political voices. Noam Chomsky, Ron Paul, Steve Forbes, Joseph Thorndike, Mike Huckabee, Charles Rossotti, David Walker, Neal Boortz, Herman Cain, Michael Graetz, Daniel Shaviro, Leonard Burman, and others discuss perceived problems in the American tax code, and also suggest possible changes. The possible solutions discussed include the FairTax, flat tax, and value added tax (VAT).|$|R

Deduction modulo is an extension of predicate calculus with rewriting both on terms and propositions. It is well suited for proof search in theories because it turns many axioms into rewrite rules. We also present the associated automated theorem prover Zenon Modulo, an extension of Zenon to polymorphic types <b>and</b> <b>deduction</b> modulo, along with its backend to the Dedukti universal proof checker, which also relies on types <b>and</b> <b>deduction</b> modulo, <b>and</b> which allows us to verify the proofs produced by Zenon Modulo.
