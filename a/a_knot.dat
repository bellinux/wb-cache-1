The subdivision rules show what the night sky would look like to someone living in <b>a</b> <b>knot</b> complement; because the universe wraps around itself (i.e. is not simply connected), an observer would see the visible universe repeat itself in an infinite pattern. The subdivision rule describes that pattern.|$|E

There is a 17th century barn adjacent to the house.|$|E

5|$|For {{additional}} maneuverability, the turuma carried 19 pairs (16 in {{the first}} two ships) of oars with four men per oar. Oarsmen rowed sitting on the weather deck, above the gun deck, with the oarports attached to a rectangular outrigger that was designed to improve the leverage. Despite this, turumas performed poorly under oars and were very difficult to move in any kind of contrary wind. In calm weather the average speed with oars was reported as low as half <b>a</b> <b>knot.</b>|$|E
5|$|HMS Zealous {{was given}} a {{straight}} stem and a rounded stern, but her hull was otherwise unmodified from her original form; it had been found that lengthening the hull, as {{was done in the}} earlier , led to longitudinal weakness. Her conversion to a central battery ironclad therefore cost less than that of any of her contemporaries, though this was offset with a shorter battery and therefore a less effective broadside. She also carried less armour than the earlier class, and was nearly <b>a</b> <b>knot</b> slower; however, as she was built to serve in distant waters, and not expected to face opposing ships of significant force, these shortcomings were thought acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Agordat {{was built}} at the Castellammare shipyard; her keel was laid down on 18 February 1897 and her {{completed}} hull was launched on 11 October 1899. After completing fitting-out work, the new cruiser was commissioned into the Italian fleet on 26 September 1900. Sea trials lasted from 11 February 1901 to 6 March, and during the final speed trial she exceeded her design speed by <b>a</b> <b>knot.</b> She nevertheless proved to be too slow and short-legged to be useful as a fleet scout, which limited her active duty career. She served in the main fleet in 19031904, during which time the fleet was kept {{in a state of}} readiness for seven months. For the remaining five months, the ships had reduced crews. During the 1908 fleet maneuvers, Agordat was assigned to the hostile force that was tasked with simulating an attempt to land troops on Sicily.|$|E

5|$|The {{battle was}} at a {{stalemate}} {{for the next five}} or six hours, with all the participants immobilized. Bonnet's men had the advantage that their deck was heeled away from their opponents, giving them cover, while the Henrys deck was tilted toward the pirates, thus exposing Rhett's men to punishing musket volleys. Bonnet's force suffered twelve casualties while killing ten and wounding fourteen of Rhett's 70-man crew. Most of Bonnet's men fought enthusiastically, challenging their enemies to board and fight hand to hand, and tying <b>a</b> <b>knot</b> in their flag as a mock signal to come aboard and render aid. Bonnet himself patrolled the deck with a pistol drawn, threatening to kill any pirate who faltered in the fight. Nevertheless, some of the prisoners who had been forced to join the pirate crew refused to fire on Rhett's men, and one narrowly escaped death at Bonnet's hands in the confusion of the engagement.|$|E
5|$|Each carving {{receives}} a special name, and common motifs are {{animals and plants}} that symbolise some virtue. For example, water plants and animals, such as crabs, tadpoles and water weeds, are commonly found to symbolise fertility. In some areas noble elders claim these symbols refer to strength of noble family, but not everyone agrees. The overall meaning of groups of carved motifs on houses remains debated and tourism has further complicated these debates because some feel a uniform explanation must be presented to tourists. The image to the left shows an example of Torajan wood carving, consisting of 15 square panels. The center bottom panel represents buffalo or wealth, a wish for many buffaloes for the family. The center panel represents <b>a</b> <b>knot</b> and a box, a hope {{that all of the}} family's offspring will be happy and live in harmony, like goods kept safe in a box. The top left and top right squares represent an aquatic animal, indicating the need for fast and hard work, just like moving on the surface of water. It also represents the need for a certain skill to produce good results.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In 1965, E. C. Zeeman {{proved that}} the (± 1) -twist spin of any knotted sphere in (n − 1) -space is unknotted in the n-sphere. In 1991, Y. Marumoto and Y.

In this paper, we define <b>a</b> <b>knotted</b> 2 -dimensional foam which is a generalization of <b>a</b> <b>knotted</b> sphere and prove that a (± 1) -twist spin of <b>a</b> <b>knotted</b> trivalent graph may be knotted. We then construct some families of knotted graphs for which the (± 1) -twist spins are always unknotted. 1...|$|R

5|$|Holmes {{had served}} under Kit Carson and John C. Fremont, {{but he was}} old and {{physically}} impaired when he met Burnham. He had lost all of his family in the Indian wars and before he died he wanted to impart {{his knowledge of the}} frontier to the young Burnham. The two men traveled throughout the American Southwest and northern Mexico, and Holmes taught him many scouting skills, such as how to track a trail, how to double and cover one's own trail, how to properly ascend and descend precipices, and how to tell the time at night. Burnham also learned survival skills from Holmes, such as where to find water in the desert, how to protect himself from snakes, and what to do in case of forest fires or floods. A stickler for details, Holmes impressed on him that even in the simplest things, such as braiding a rope, tying <b>a</b> <b>knot,</b> or putting on or taking off a saddle, there is a right way and a wrong way. The two men earned a living by hunting and prospecting. Burnham also worked as a cowboy, a guard for the mines, a guide, and a scout during these years.|$|E
5|$|The {{artifact}} shows {{a number}} of idiosyncrasies that raise questions concerning its authenticity. The numbering systems used in the codex conflict. The Maya bar-and-dot system is used to mark units, but the central Mexican dot system is used to mark multiples of twenty (for example by using 11 dots instead of 2 bars and a dot, as {{would be the case}} in the bar-and-dot system where a bar indicates 5 and a dot indicates 1). Some bar-and-dot numbers are placed within a cartouche decorated with <b>a</b> <b>knot</b> at the top. The only other instance of such a cartouche being used with numbers is in the Dresden Codex, where the cartouche has a very specific function, indicating a negative date count from the zero year of the great cycle of the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar (roughly equivalent to the function of BC in the Gregorian calendar). In the Grolier Codex, where the numbers mark intervals between stations of Venus, the use of this cartouche appears meaningless, although it is suggested that it means that the codex may be read both from the front and from the back.|$|E
25|$|Knots can be {{described}} in various ways. Given a method of description, however, there may be more than one description that represents the same knot. For example, a common method of describing <b>a</b> <b>knot</b> is a planar diagram called <b>a</b> <b>knot</b> diagram. Any given knot can be drawn in many different ways using <b>a</b> <b>knot</b> diagram. Therefore, a fundamental problem in knot theory is determining when two descriptions represent the same knot.|$|E

25|$|The Dowker {{notation}}, {{also called}} the Dowker–Thistlethwaite notation or code, for <b>a</b> <b>knot</b> is a finite sequence of even integers. The numbers are generated by following the knot and marking the crossings with consecutive integers. Since each crossing is visited twice, this creates a pairing of even integers with odd integers. An appropriate sign is given to indicate over and undercrossing. For example, in this figure the knot diagram has crossings labelled with the pairs (1,6) (3,12) (5,2) (7,8) (9,4) and (11,10). The Dowker notation for this labelling is the sequence: 6 12 2 8 4 10. <b>A</b> <b>knot</b> diagram {{has more than one}} possible Dowker notation, and there is a well-understood ambiguity when reconstructing <b>a</b> <b>knot</b> from a Dowker notation.|$|E

25|$|There is {{a closely}} related {{notion of the}} {{connected}} sum of two knots.

So the connected sum of knots has a more elaborate definition that produces a well-defined embedding, as follows.|$|E
