40|$|A {{high quality}} factor (Q-factor) {{piezoelectric}} lead zirconat titanate (PZT) actuated single crystal silicon cantilever was proposed {{in this paper}} for resonant based ultra-sensitive mass detection. Energy dissipation from intrinsic mechanical loss of the PZT film was successfully compressed by separating the PZT actuator from resonant structure. Excellent Q-factor, which is several times larger than conventional PZT cantilever, was achieved under both atmospheric pressure and reduced pressures. For a 30 micrometer-wide 100 micrometer-long cantilever, Q-factor was measured as high as 1113 and 7279 {{under the pressure of}} 101. 2 KPa and 35 Pa, respectively. Moreover, it was found that high-mode vibration can be realized by the cantilever for the pursuit of great Q-factor, while support loss became significant because of the increased vibration amplitude at the <b>actuation</b> <b>point.</b> An optimized structure using node-point actuation was suggested then to suppress corresponding energy dissipation.

40|$|We {{present a}} method to {{precisely}} calibrate the time delay in a long baseline gravitational-wave interferometer. An accurate time stamp is crucial for data analysis of gravitational wave detectors, especially when performing coincidence and correlation analyses between multiple detectors. Our method uses an intensity-modulated radiation pressure force to actuate on the mirrors. The time delay is measured by comparing the phase of the signal at the <b>actuation</b> <b>point</b> with the phase of the recorded signal within the calibrated data stream used for gravitational wave searches. Because the signal-injection path is independent of the interferometer's control system, which {{is used for the}} standard calibration, this method can be an independent verification of the timing error in the system. A measurement performed with the 4 km interferometer at the LIGO Hanford Observatory shows a 1 µs relative accuracy when averaging over 50 min. Our understanding of the systematic time delay in the detector response has reached the level of 10 µs. ...|$|E

Then, a combination of energy multiplier and differential flatness methods is used to design an asymptotic tracking controller. This control scheme consists of stabilizing state-feedback derived from the energy multiplier method and feed-forward control based on the flatness property of the system.

40|$|The project report primary {{deals with}} the Testing, Analysis, Modeling of the {{components}} of the Solar Array deployment Mechanism and a preliminary design. It also discusses the Monitoring of the supply chain management system for the procurement of the components from vendors. The deployment of solar array or any other appendage is a mission critical activity of any satellite. It is necessary to study about the deployment mechanism because once the array latches up, the satellite can have disturbance resulting in attitude change. To begin, a detail study of the drawings of all the components, assemblies and sub-assemblies incorporated in the deployment mechanism was done. A literary review was carried out to investigate the research done previously and the research currently being done in the field of deployment mechanisms. This was followed by the designing {{of the components of}} SADM in Unigraphics. The components were assembled with their respective sub-assemblies. The next step was to perform the testing of components on various testing machines & thereafter analyzing the results. A conceptual design was prepared for the Solar Array Deployment Mechanism. A proper approach was used for the supply chain management of the procurement of raw materials. The torsion spring parameters were calculated, which importantly included the pre rotation angle, spring angular and the time required by the wings to deploy. The hinges were tested on the auto hinge characterization setup and the torque value required to deploy the wings was compared with the required value. The testing of micro switches was performed and the values of loads at <b>actuation</b> <b>point,</b> deactuation point, over travel and the gap between actuation and deactuation was compared with the actual values required. Torsion springs were tested and it was seen whether the stiffness values of the torsion springs are in limit to the defined value or not. Several components of Solar Array Deployment Mechanism were modeled in 3 D. A simulating model of the preliminary design was made using Solid Works in which the deployment of the wings was shown by making use of the servo motor. The values of the torque required for hinges, loads at <b>actuation</b> <b>point,</b> deactuation point, over travel and the gap between actuation and deactuation and stiffness values of the springs were approximately accurate. Some errors had occurred due to the improper setup of the components on the fixtures. Unigraphics was used for the modeling of the components of Solar array Deployment Mechanism.

40|$|Active wing {{morphing}} is {{a fertile}} {{technology in the}} realm of unmanned and micro air vehicles: low flight loads and flexible wing materials allow substantial deformation with relatively low actuation power. Proper shape management of these wings for maximum performance is challenging: numerical optimization methods may struggle to accurately predict the three-dimensional flow separation, transition, and reattachment expected at the low operating Reynolds numbers. Conventional experimental optimization techniques (a response surface fit through a designed experiment) may be unable to represent the discontinuous objective functions commonly seen in aerodynamic applications, and the number of function evaluations can become overwhelming with high-fidelity actuation mechanisms. This paper outlines an effective experimental technique for optimizing a morphing airfoil: a genetic algorithm with wind tunnel hardware (strain gage sting balance) in the loop. Optimal wing shapes are found to maximize the measured lift or efficiency through a sweep of angles of attack, for a wing with a single <b>actuation</b> <b>point</b> (camber control) and two actuation points (camber and reflex control). Aerodynamic and electrical hysteresis limits the repeatability of sting balance measurements, complicating the convergence of the genetic algorithm, but not preventing adequate location of optimal designs.

In product design, it is predominantly {{used for the}} development of driver-vehicle systems. Most digital human modeling software tools, such as JACK, RAMSIS and DELMIA HUMANBUILDER provide functions to predict posture and positions for drivers with selected anthropometry according to SAE (Society of Automotive Engineers) Recommended Practices and other ergonomics guidelines. However, few studies have presented 2 nd row passenger postural information, and digital human modeling of these passenger postures cannot be performed directly using the existing driver posture prediction functions. In this paper, the significant studies related to occupant posture and modeling were reviewed and a framework of determinants of driver vs. 2 nd row occupant posture modeling was extracted. The determinants which are regarded as input factors for posture modeling include target population anthropometry, vehicle package geometry and seat design variables as well as task definitions. The differences between determinants of driver and 2 nd row occupant posture models are significant, as driver posture modeling is primarily based on the position of the foot on the accelerator pedal (accelerator <b>actuation</b> <b>point</b> AAP, accelerator heel point AHP) and the hands on the steering wheel (steering wheel centre point A-Point). The objectives of this paper are aimed to investigate those differences between driver and passenger posture, and to supplement the existing parametric model for occupant posture prediction. With the guide of the framework, the associated input parameters of occupant digital human models of both driver and second row occupant will be identified. Beyond the existing occupant posture models, for example a driver posture model could be modified to predict second row occupant posture, by adjusting the associated input parameters introduced in this paper. This study combines results from a literature review and the theoretical modeling stage of a second row passenger posture prediction model project...|$|E

We show the method used to acquire the pressure data from the external surface of the flexible wing skin, using incorporated Kulite pressure sensors and the instrumentation of the morphing controller. The acquired pressure data are analyzed through fast Fourier transforms to detect {{the magnitude of the}} noise in the surface airflow. Subsequently, the data are filtered by means of high-pass filters and processed by calculating the root mean square of the signal to obtain a plot diagram of the noise in the airflow. This signal processing is necessary to remove the inherent noise electronically induced from the Tollmien 2 ̆ 013 Schlichting waves, which are responsible for triggering the transition from laminar to turbulent flow. The flexible skin is required to morph the shape of the airfoil through two <b>actuation</b> <b>points</b> to achieve an optimized airfoil shape based on the theoretical flow conditions similar to those tested in the wind tunnel.

These mirrors can have diameters of the order of a meter and include metallic film reflectors on nanolaminate substrates supported by multiple distributed piezoceramic gpiston h-type actuators for micron-level figure control. Whereas conventional glass mirrors of equivalent size and precision have areal mass densities between 50 and 150 kg/sq m, the nanolaminate mirrors, including not only the reflector/ shell portions but also the actuators and the backing structures needed to react the actuation forces, would have areal mass densities that may approach. 5 kg/m 2. Moreover, whereas fabrication of a conventional glass mirror of equivalent precision takes several years, the reflector/shell portion of a nanolaminate mirror can be fabricated in less than a week, and its actuation system can be fabricated in 1 to 2 months. The engineering of these mirrors involves a fusion of the technological heritage of multisegmented adaptive optics and deformable mirrors with more recent advances in metallic nanolaminates and in mathematical modeling of the deflections of thin, curved shells in response to displacements by multiple, distributed actuators. Because a nanolaminate shell is of the order of 10 times as strong as an otherwise identical shell made of a single, high-strength, non-nanolaminate metal suitable for mirror use, a nanolaminate mirror can be made very thin (typically between 100 and 150 m {{from the back of the}} nanolaminate substrate to the front reflecting surface).

The main {{objective of the}} global project is the development of an active control system of wing airfoil geometry during flight in order to allow drag reduction. Drag reduction on a wing can be achieved through modifications in the laminar-toturbulent flow transition point position, which should be situated {{as close as possible to}} the trailing edge of the airfoil wing. As the transition point plays a crucial part in this project, this work focuses on the control of its position on the airfoil, as an effect of controlling the deflection of a morphing wing airfoil equipped with a flexible skin. The paper presents the modeling and the experimental testing of the aerodynamic performance of a morphing wing, starting from the design concept phase all the way to the bench and wind tunnel tests phases. Several wind tunnel test runs for various Mach numbers and angles of attack were performed in the 6 × 9 ft 2 wind tunnel at the Institute for Aerospace Research at the National Research Council Canada. A rectangular finite aspect ratio wing, having a morphing airfoil cross-section due to a flexible skin installed on the upper surface of the wing, was instrumented with Kulite transducers. The Mach number varied from 0. 2 to 0. 3 and the angle of attack between - 1 o and 2 o. Unsteady pressure signals were recorded and analyzed and a thorough comparison, in terms of mean pressure coefficients and their standard deviations, was performed against theoretical predictions, using the XFoil computational fluid dynamics code. The acquired pressure data was analyzed through custom-made software created with Matlab/Simulink in order to detect the noise magnitude in the surface airflow and to localize the transition point position on the wing upper surface. This signal processing was necessary in order to detect the Tollmien-Schlichting waves responsible for triggering the transition from laminar to turbulent flow.

The objective is to produce estimates of the dynamic power consumption char- acteristics of the primary ight control actuation system when executing manoeuvres. Three technologies are studied; the classic hydraulic actuators and the electromechanical and electro-hydrostatic types that are commonly associated with the more electric aircraft. Models are produced which represent the ight dynamics of an aircraft; these are then combined with low frequency dynamic functional models of the three actuator technologies and ight controllers. The result is a model, capable of faster than real time simulation, which produces estimates of ac- tuator power consumption as the aircraft follows prede ned trajectories. The model is used to quantify the energy consumption {{as a result of}} di erent manoeuvre rates when executing banked turns. The result from an <b>actuation</b> system <b>point</b> of view alone is that the lower the turn rate, the lower the overall energy used. The tradeo is that the turn radius becomes larger. The use of the model can be extended to assist with additional design challenges such as actuator design and speci cation. Using methods to size actuators based on stall force and no load speed properties leads to oversizing of the control system. Performing dynamic analyses is usually a combined task of laboratory based actuator test rigs stimulated by input data gathered during ight tests. The model in this work provides a method of generating data for preliminary design; therefore reducing the amount of ight testing required in a design and certi cation programme. The major results discovered using the tools developed in this thesis are that a hydraulically powered aileron uses 4. 23 % more energy to achieve a turn at a heading rate of 0. 03 rad/s compared to a 0. 005 rad/s manoeuvre in the same conditions. The electromechanical actuator (EMA) uses 1. 67 % more and the electrohydrostatic actuator (EHA) uses 1. 54 % more to achieve the same turns. It implies reduced turn rate turns would have the largest bene t for reducing energy consumption in current hydraulically powered actuation systems, compared to electrical actuators...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} answer the problem of ‘how to reduce the {{aerospace}} industry’s environment footprint?’ new morphing technologies were developed. These technologies were aimed at reducing the aircraft’s fuel consumption through reduction of the wing drag. The morphing concept {{used in the present}} research consists of replacing the conventional aluminium upper surface of the wing with a flexible composite skin for morphing abilities. For the ATR- 42 ‘Morphing wing’ project, the wing models were manufactured entirely from composite materials and the morphing region was optimized for flexibility. In this project two rigid wing models and an active morphing wing model were designed, manufactured and wind tunnel tested. For the CRIAQ MDO 505 project, a full scale wing-tip equipped with two types of ailerons, conventional and morphing, was designed, optimized, manufactured, bench and wind tunnel tested. The morphing concept was applied on a real wing internal structure and incorporated aerodynamic, structural and control constraints specific to a multidisciplinary approach. Numerical optimization, aerodynamic analysis and experimental validation were performed for both the CRIAQ MDO 505 full scale wing-tip demonstrator and the ATR- 42 reduced scale wing models. In order to improve the aerodynamic performances of the ATR- 42 and CRIAQ MDO 505 wing airfoils, three global optimization algorithms were developed, tested and compared. The three algorithms were: the genetic algorithm, the artificial bee colony and the gradient descent. The algorithms were coupled with the two-dimensional aerodynamic solver XFoil. XFoil is known for its rapid convergence, robustness and use of the semi-empirical en method for determining the position of the flow transition from laminar to turbulent. Based on the performance comparison between the algorithms, the genetic algorithm was chosen for the optimization of the ATR- 42 and CRIAQ MDO 505 wing airfoils. The objectives for which the genetic algorithm optimizer found the optimal shapes for the studied airfoils were: 1) extension of the laminar flow towards the trailing edge, 2) extension of the turbulent region towards the leading edge and 3) improvement of the lift coefficient {{through the use of a}} morphing aileron method. The first two objectives were achieved through manipulation of the transition region using wing upper-surface morphing. The third objective was achieved through the development of two methods for aileron shape morphing. The optimization algorithm was improved during the CRIAQ MDO 505 project for convergence speed by introducing a two-step cross-over function. Structural constraints were introduced in the algorithm at each aero-structural optimization interaction, allowing a better manipulation of the algorithm and giving it more capabilities of morphing combinations. The CRIAQ MDO 505 project envisioned a morphing aileron concept for the morphing upper surface wing. For this morphing aileron concept, two optimization methods were developed. The methods used the already developed genetic algorithm and each method had a different design concept. The first method was based on the morphing upper surface concept, using <b>actuation</b> <b>points</b> to achieve the desired shape. The second method was based on the hinge rotation concept of the conventional aileron but applied at multiple nodes along the aileron camber to achieve the desired shape. Both methods were constrained by manufacturing and aerodynamic requirements. The purpose of the morphing aileron methods was to obtain an aileron shape with a smoother pressure distribution gradient during deflection than the conventional aileron. The aerodynamic optimization results were used for the structural optimization and design of the wing, particularly the flexible composite skin. Due to the structural changes performed on the initial wing-tip structure, an aeroelastic behaviour analysis, more specific on flutter phenomenon, was performed. The analyses were done to ensure the structural integrity of the wing-tip demonstrator during wind tunnel tests. Three wind tunnel tests were performed for the CRIAQ MDO 505 wing-tip demonstrator at the IAR-NRC subsonic wind tunnel facility in Ottawa. The first two tests were performed for the wing-tip equipped with conventional aileron. The purpose of these tests was to validate the control system designed for the morphing upper surface, the numerical optimization and aerodynamic analysis and to evaluate the optimization efficiency on the boundary layer behaviour and the wing drag. The third set of wind tunnel tests was performed on the wing-tip equipped with a morphing aileron. The purpose of this test was to evaluate the performances of the morphing aileron, in conjunction with the active morphing upper surface, and their effect on the lift, drag and boundary layer behaviour. Transition data, obtained from Infrared Thermography, and pressure data, extracted from Kulite and pressure taps recordings, were used to validate the numerical optimization and aerodynamic performances of the wing-tip demonstrator. A set of wind tunnel tests was performed on the ATR- 42 rigid wing models at the Price-Paidoussis subsonic wind tunnel at Ecole de technologie Superieure. The results from the pressure taps recordings were used to validate the numerical optimization. A second derivative of the pressure distribution method was applied to evaluate the transition region on the upper surface of the wing models for comparison with the numerical transition values...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is the design and {{prototyping}} of a compact external pipe-crawling device that aids the inspection of pipes in hazardous environments and areas that are inaccessible to humans. The novel aspect of the design is a compliant mechanism that is actuated using Ni-Ti-Cu shape memory alloy (SMA) wire and strip. The device consists of two rings that are attached to each other along the longitudinal axis of the pipe by three pairs of circumferentially arranged U-shaped SMA and spring steel (AISI 1080) strips. Each ring consists of a compliant mechanism and housing. The compliant mechanism transforms the circumferential motion to radial motion at three points that are in contact with the pipe. The design of this compliant mechanism is derived from a radially deployable linkage. The SMA wire attached to the compliant mechanism and embedded within the housing with proper electrical isolation creates the circumferential motion for the compliant mechanism. When there is no <b>actuation,</b> the contact <b>points</b> of the compliant mechanisms of the two rings tightly hold the pipe. When an SMA wire of a ring is activated, that ring releases the grip on the pipe. At this time, the SMA strips are actuated to bring the rings closer together. After this, the first ring is de-activated to create the grip again. This is followed by releasing the grip on the second ring by the SMA wire activation. The spring steel strips, which are compressed during the SMA strip actuation, now extend back creating a displacement along the pipe. This cycle is repeated to create a...|$|R
40|$|Using {{formation}} flying spacecraft as space-based interferometers will provide images of unprecedented resolution. Missions such as Stellar Imager {{plan to use}} multiple spacecraft in a formation instead of a typical monolithic space telescope, achieving a resolution up to 0. 1 milliarcseconds. In order to assemble into a formation, these satellites must first locate each other using limited field-of-view sensors. Once the satellites are in a formation, the path length of the light going to the combiner satellite must be controlled to nanometer levels to produce an image of high quality. One solution to control to such precision is to use staged control methods, utilizing multiple actuators with overlapping strokes and bandwidths. This thesis first provides an algorithm for three satellites to initialize into a formation using relative measurements and limited field-of-view sensors. The satellites perform a search to locate each other, accurately point their transmitters at each other, and move into an equilateral triangle formation. This thesis also provides the framework for developing a staged pointing and phasing testbed using the Synchronized Position Hold Engage Reorient Experimental Satellites (SPHERES) as the coarse stage. The <b>pointing</b> <b>actuation</b> is provided by a fast steering mirror and a linear stage, and the phasing actuation is provided by an optical delay line consisting of a voice coil mirror and a piezo mirror. by John M.

40|$|For {{many years}} {{scientists}} have been utilizing stratospheric balloons as low-cost platforms on which to conduct space science experiments. A major hurdle in extending the range of experiments for which these vehicles are useful has been the imposition of the gondola dynamics on the accuracy with which an instrument can be kept pointed at a celestial target. A significant number of scientists have sought the ability to point their instruments with jitter in the arc-second range. This paper presents the design and analysis of a stratospheric balloon borne pointing system that is able to meet this requirement. The foundation for a high fidelity controller simulation is presented. The flexibility of the flight train is represented through generalized modal analysis. A multiple controller scheme is introduced for coarse and fine pointing. Coarse azimuth pointing is accomplished by an established pointing system, with extensive flight history, residing above the gondola structure. A pitch-yaw gimbal mount is used for fine pointing, providing orthogonal axes when nominally on target. Fine <b>pointing</b> <b>actuation</b> is from direct drive dc motors, eliminating backlash problems. An analysis of friction nonlinearities and {{a demonstration of the}} necessity in eliminating static fiction are provided. A unique bearing hub design is introduced that eliminates static fiction from the system dynamics. A control scheme involving linear accelerometers for enhanced disturbance rejection is also presented. Results from a linear analysis of the total system and the high fidelity simulation are given. This paper establishes that the proposed control strategy can be made robustly stable with significant design margins. Also demonstrated is the efficacy of the proposed system in rejecting disturbances larger than those considered realistic. Finally, we see that sub arc-second pointing stability can be achieved for a large instrument pointing at an inertial target...|$|R
40|$|The {{traction}} power of kites {{can be used}} for wind energy conversion at a potentially low cost. Crucially important is a reliable control of flight path and tether reeling. The present study proposes a modelling framework describing the dynamic behaviour of the inter-connected system components, suitable for design and optimization of the control systems. The wing, bridle line system, airborne control unit and tether are represented as a particle system using spring-damper elements to describe the mechanical properties of the tensile structure. Two alternative kite models are proposed. The point mass model accounts only for the translational inertia of the wing, assuming an instantaneous alignment with the local relative flow. The aerodynamic side force is assumed to be a linear function of the steering line <b>actuation.</b> The four <b>point</b> model accounts also for the rotational inertia of the wing and discretises the aerodynamics by a centre section and two tip sections. The local angle of attack at the tip sections are assumed to be functions of the corresponding steering line actuations. To simulate reel-out and reel-in of the tether, the lengths of the individual tether elements are varied and the dynamic behaviour of the ground station is included. To validate the modelling framework, it is combined with the automatic control system used for the operation of a kite power system demonstrator. The simulation results show that the point mass model can be adjusted to match the measured behaviour during a pumping cycle. The four point model is more accurate, with an efficiency error of less than 2 %, and remains stable also at low tether forces. Compared to previous approaches, the proposed modelling framework is more accurate and robust while allowing dynamic simulations of the complete system at real-time speed...|$|R
