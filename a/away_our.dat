500|$|Liverpool manager Bob Paisley was {{critical}} of his team's performance in the first leg: [...] "We threw it <b>away,</b> <b>our</b> attitude was wrong and we were careless. Anderlecht are a great team going forward, but we never attacked them as we should. Our approach seems to have gone a bit wrong and we've lost our scoring touch where {{earlier in the season}} our finishing was great." ...|$|E
500|$|... "502" [...] {{is about}} driving fast cars. [...] "In My Darkest Hour" [...] {{was written by}} Mustaine shortly {{after the death of}} Metallica bassist Cliff Burton. Mustaine had found out through word of mouth, as his former bandmates never {{contacted}} him about the tragic event that occurred in Europe. He later recalled that he was extremely unhappy that day and wrote the song in one sitting. [...] "Liar" [...] is a rant directed at past member Chris Poland. [...] "Hook in Mouth" [...] declaims censorship and the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC). Mustaine elaborated that the lyrics were aimed at those who were [...] "fucking around with our constitutional rights and trying to take <b>away</b> <b>our</b> freedom of speech".|$|E

500|$|The film {{received}} universal acclaim. Roger Ebert {{gave the}} film four stars and wrote, [...] "This {{is not simply}} a good movie. It is one of those movies that brush <b>away</b> <b>our</b> cautions and win our hearts." [...] He later added it to his Great Movies list, structuring the essay as a letter to his grandchildren about the first time they watched it. Michael Sragow of Rolling Stone called Spielberg [...] "a space age Jean Renoir.... for the first time, [...] has put his breathtaking technical skills at the service of his deepest feelings". Derek Malcolm of The Guardian wrote that [...] "E.T. is a superlative piece of popular cinema ... a dream of childhood, brilliantly orchestrated to involve not only children but anyone able to remember being one". Leonard Maltin would include it in his list of [...] "100 Must-See Films of the 20th Century" [...] as one of only two movies from the 1980s. George Will {{was one of the few}} to pan the film, feeling it spread subversive notions about childhood and science.|$|E
500|$|Hagan was crowned Miss America 2013 on January 12, 2013 in Las Vegas, Nevada by {{outgoing}} Miss America 2012 Laura Kaeppeler, {{beating out}} first runner-up Miss South Carolina 2012 Ali Rogers. Due {{to the decision}} to move the pageant back to Atlantic City, New Jersey, her reign was cut short by four months and ended on September 15, 2013. Although Hagan follows a few other Miss New York contestants to earn the Miss America crown, {{she is the first}} Brooklynite to win. The 2013 competition was Hagan's final year of Miss America Organization eligibility. Her introductory quip to the Miss America 2013 audience {{at the beginning of the}} on-air broadcast was [...] "Sandy may have swept <b>away</b> <b>our</b> shores but never our spirit." [...] During the Miss America 2013 competition, she performed a tap dance routine to James Brown's [...] "Get Up Offa That Thing" [...] while wearing a latex rodeo outfit. Other elements of her winning wardrobe included a black string bikini and an asymmetric white evening gown. At the time of her Miss America victory, she was 24 years old and a resident of Brooklyn. Part of her prize package was a $50,000 scholarship.|$|E
500|$|Oxford coach Sean Bowden said [...] "We {{had a good}} {{race and}} made all the right moves to Hammersmith, but we couldn't quite shake them off and didn't quite have enough lead to defend", while Cambridge's number six Kieran West said [...] "Credit to Oxford. They threw {{everything}} they had at us, but we absorbed it all." [...] Cambridge head coach Duncan Holland praised his cox: [...] "Rebecca was magnificent. She steered a superb course. She steered exactly where we thought she should steer and she stayed calm, it was great." [...] Dowbiggin herself recounted: [...] "The guys asked me to be very calm, very relaxed, not to panic, even if Oxford were pushing and moving, I was just like 'okay, they're pushing, they're moving, but we're going to do this'." [...] Bowden criticised the umpire who he claimed [...] "pushed us too tight round the bend. From Hammersmith Bridge on that took <b>away</b> <b>our</b> advantage." [...] Cambridge's Tom James was finally successful, winning the Boat Race at his fourth attempt: [...] "I really couldn't think about losing this race. [...] Oxford really hounded us. The line was getting closer but never quickly enough." ...|$|E

500|$|Scholar Andrea Loewenstein {{published}} the first in-depth review of Bannon's books in 1980, and notes {{that they were}} [...] "exceptionally good pulp" [...] that caused unexpected strong feelings of sadness or anger among lesbians when they were read twenty years after being published. Bannon depicts strict roles of butch and femme, and gays and lesbians as self-destructive, closeted, paranoid, and alcoholic. Loewenstein remarks that readers in 1980 {{had a tendency to}} reject that kind of reality in Bannon's stories. [...] "Since much of our past is so bitter, ... pretend <b>away</b> <b>our</b> most recent history". Loewenstein suggests the struggles Bannon's characters endured were ones that Bannon must have faced herself. When Laura declares her joy in her love for Beth in Odd Girl Out while simultaneously questioning if it is right, Loewenstein states [...] "one hears quite clearly the voice of Ann Bannon, questioning her own right to happiness". Similarly, remarking on Bannon's treatment of Beebo in Women in the Shadows by making her violent, alcoholic and self-destructive, Loewenstein notes, [...] "she needs to humiliate Beebo so badly that she makes her disappear". Loewenstein remarks Bannon's characters are deeply conflicted by enjoying relationships they feel are morally wrong, and they are acting out cycles of self-hatred, though what remains at the end is [...] "surprisingly... passionate, tender, and erotic".|$|E
500|$|Meredith's {{performances}} for Northwich {{gained the}} attention of several other clubs in the Football League. Bolton Wanderers full-back Di Jones, a former Chirk player, spoke with him about a possible move, but Bolton secretary J.J. Bentley felt Meredith was too inexperienced and his frame too slight. Lawrence Furniss, an official at Ardwick, had first noticed him while refereeing a Northwich match. Meredith also played in both meetings between the clubs that season. Later in 1894, Ardwick, by then known as Manchester City, vigorously pursued Meredith's signature. Two club officials travelled to Wales to meet the player. One was secretary-manager Joshua Parlby, the other either Furniss or chairman John Chapman. The pair were met with suspicion. Anecdotes by contemporary figures suggest they were initially chased away by locals, and were only allowed to speak to Meredith after they bought drinks for his mining colleagues. Meredith {{did not wish to}} abandon life in Chirk. His mother was particularly against the idea: [...] "It is all very well for you gentlemen to leave your big cities and come to our villages to steal our boys <b>away...</b> <b>Our</b> boys are happy and healthy, satisfied with their work and innocent amusements... if Billy takes my advice he will stick to his work and play football for his own amusement when work is finished." [...] Meredith did eventually sign for Manchester City, but as an amateur. He continued to work at the pit for at least a year, commuting back and forth for matches.|$|E

[...] The speech was delivered at the grave-site of a commander of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army where Tyahnybok praised its struggle against [...] "Moskaly", a derogatory term for either Russians or pan-Russian nationalists; Germans; and [...] "Zhydy", an archaic but controversial term for Jews in Ukraine due to it being a slur when used in the Russian language.
