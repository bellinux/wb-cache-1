500|$|Scientists {{continued}} {{to search for}} new synthetic dyes that would be effective on cellulose fibres like cotton and linen, {{and that would be}} more colorfast on wool and silk than the early anilines. [...] Chrome or mordant dyes produced a muted but very fast color range for woollens. [...] These were followed by <b>acid</b> <b>dyes</b> for animal fibres (from 1875) and the synthesis of indigo in Germany in 1880. [...] The work on indigo {{led to the development of}} a new class of dyes called vat dyes in 1901 that produced a wide range of fast colors for vegetable fibres. [...] Disperse dyes were introduced in 1923 to color the new textiles of cellulose acetate, which could not be colored with any existing dyes. [...] Today disperse dyes are the only effective means of coloring many synthetics. [...] Reactive dyes for both wool and cotton were introduced in the mid-1950s, and are used both in commercial textile production and in craft dyeing.|$|E

40|$|Activated carbons were {{prepared}} from bagasse through a low temperature (160 degreesC) chemical carbonisation treatment and gasification with carbon dioxide at 900 degreesC. The merit of low temperature chemical carbonisation in preparing chars for activation {{was assessed by}} comparing the {{physical and chemical properties}} of activated carbons developed by this technique to conventional methods involving the use of thermal and vacuum pyrolysis of bagasse. In addition, the adsorption properties (<b>acid</b> blue <b>dye)</b> of these bagasse activated carbons were also compared with a commercial activated carbon. The results suggest that despite the high ash content of the precursor, high surface areas (614 - 1433 m(2) g(- 1)) and microporous (median pore size from 0. 45 to 1. 2 nm) activated carbons can be generated through chemical carbonisation and gasification. The micropore area of the activated carbon developed from chars prepared by the low temperature chemical carbonisation provides favourable adsorption sites to <b>acid</b> blue <b>dye</b> (391 mg g(- 1) of carbon). The alkalinity of the carbon surface and total surface area were shown to have complementary effects in promoting the adsorption of <b>acid</b> blue <b>dye.</b> Adsorption of the anionic coloured component of the <b>acid</b> <b>dye</b> was shown to be promoted in carbon exhibiting alkaline or positively charged surfaces. This study demonstrates that activated carbons with high <b>acid</b> <b>dye</b> adsorption capacities can be prepared from high ash bagasse based on low temperature chemical carbonisation and gasification.

40|$|In this paper, {{the effects}} of low {{temperature}} plasma (LTP) treatment on the dyeing properties of wool were studied. Wool fibres were treated with oxygen plasma and three types of dyeing systems that are commonly used for wool <b>dyeing,</b> namely: (i) <b>acid</b> <b>dye,</b> (ii) chrome dye and (iii) reactive dye; {{were used in the}} <b>dyeing</b> process. For <b>acid</b> <b>dyeing,</b> the dyeing rate of LTP-treated wool fibre was greatly increased, but the final dyeinq exhaustion equilibrium did not show any significant change. For chrome dyeing, the dyeing rate of LTP-treated wool fibre was increased, but the final dyeing exhaustion equilibrium was increased only to a small extent. In addition, the rate of the afterchroming process was similar to the chrome dyeing process. In the case of reactive dyeing, the dyeing rate of LTP-treated wool fibre was greatly increased and also the final dyeing exhaustion equilibrium was increased significantly. As a result, it may be concluded that the LTP treatment could improve the dyeing behaviour of wool fibre under different dyeing systems. Institute of Textiles and Clothin...|$|R
