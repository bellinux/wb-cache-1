5|$|A new {{contract}} was signed on 19 July 2011 with Odebrecht; R$400million {{of the total}} would be financed by BNDES and the remaining R$420million would come from tax credits granted by the City. A 2007 law stated the tax credits {{could be used by}} any company that established itself in the Eastern region of the city, providing a credit of R$0.60 per R$1.00 invested. A new law was passed by the city legislature to deal specifically with this stadium and reduce the incentives, linking the concession of the credits to hosting the World Cup opening match <b>and</b> <b>limiting</b> the total amount of credits to R$420million. The concession was justified by the expectation that the stadium will generate R$950 million in city taxes during the six years after its opening.

5|$|A novel {{vaccine for}} dengue fever has been {{approved}} and is commercially available {{in a number of}} countries. Other methods of prevention are by reducing mosquito habitat <b>and</b> <b>limiting</b> exposure to bites.

Treatment of acute dengue is supportive and includes giving fluid either by mouth or intravenously for mild or moderate disease. For more severe cases blood transfusion may be required. About half a million people require admission to hospital a year. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen should not be used.|$|E
5|$|Ernest had {{the support}} of the {{previous}} Elector, now Salentin IX of Isenburg-Grenzau, Frederick, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg, and, probably most important, several thousand Spanish troops hired by the pope. While representatives from the Cathedral chapter, the seven imperial electors, the emperor, and the pope tried to resolve differences around the negotiating table, first in Frankfurt am Main, and then in Muhlhausen in Westphalia, the armies of both sides rampaged throughout the southern portion of the Electorate, called the Oberstift, plundering abbeys and convents, burning villages and small cities, and destroying crops, bridges, and roads. None of the combatants were prepared to commit their troops in a fixed battle; it was far more lucrative, and safer as well, to use them in a show of force, intimidating the peasantry, besieging walled towns and small cities, <b>and</b> <b>limiting</b> trade and the sale of food-stuffs in the marketplaces.|$|E

5|$|Federal {{examiners}} had {{the authority}} to register voters, examine voter registration applications, and maintain voter rolls. The goal of the federal examiner provision was to prevent jurisdictions from denying protected minorities the right to vote by engaging in discriminatory behavior in the voter registration process, such as refusing to register qualified applicants, purging qualified voters from the voter rolls, <b>and</b> <b>limiting</b> the hours during which persons could register. Federal examiners were used extensively in the years following the Act's enactment, but their importance waned over time; 1983 was the last year that a federal examiner registered a person to vote. In 2006, Congress repealed the provision.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixteenth}} century, Scottish kings, {{particularly}} James V, built palaces in a Renaissance style, beginning at Linlithgow. The trend soon spread {{to members of}} the aristocracy. Painting was strongly influenced by Flemish art, with works commissioned from the continent and Flemings serving as court artists. While church art suffered iconoclasm and a loss of patronage {{as a result of the}} Reformation, house decoration and portraiture became significant for the wealthy, with George Jamesone emerging as the first major named artist in the early seventeenth century. Music also incorporated wider European influences although the Reformation caused a move from complex polyphonic church music to the simpler singing of metrical psalms. Combined with the Union of Crowns in 1603, the Reformation also removed the church and the court as sources of patronage, changing the direction of artistic creation <b>and</b> <b>limiting</b> its scope. In the early seventeenth century the major elements of the Renaissance began to give way to Stoicism, Mannerism and the Baroque.|$|E
5|$|Once the Speaker {{election}} {{had concluded}} and Congress {{was ready to}} conduct legislative business, the issue of slavery took center stage.

Kentucky's Henry Clay introduced in the Senate a series of resolutions, the Compromise of 1850, to admit California and pass legislation sought by each side. Johnson voted for all the provisions except for {{the abolition of slavery}} in the nation's capital. He pressed resolutions for constitutional amendments to provide for popular election of senators (then elected by state legislatures) and of the president (chosen by the Electoral College), <b>and</b> <b>limiting</b> the tenure of federal judges to 12 years.

5|$|Prevention of {{alcoholism}} may be attempted by regulating <b>and</b> <b>limiting</b> {{the sale of}} alcohol, taxing alcohol to increase its cost, and providing inexpensive treatment. Treatment may take several steps. Because of the medical problems that can occur during withdrawal, alcohol detoxification should be carefully controlled. One common method {{involves the use of}} benzodiazepine medications, such as diazepam. This can be either given while admitted to a health care institution or occasionally while a person remains in the community with close supervision. Other addictions or mental illness may complicate treatment. After detoxification support such as group therapy or support groups are used to help keep a person from returning to drinking. One commonly used form of support is the group Alcoholics Anonymous. The medications acamprosate, disulfiram, or naltrexone may also be used to help prevent further drinking.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} of research support for each recommendation varies; {{some of the}} more robustly researched and supported recommendations include the negative effects of noisy sleep environments, alcohol consumption in the hours before sleep, engaging in mentally difficult tasks before sleep, and trying too hard to fall asleep. There is a lack of evidence for the effects of certain sleep hygiene recommendations, including getting a more comfortable mattress, removing bedroom clocks, not worrying, <b>and</b> <b>limiting</b> liquids. Other recommendations, such as the effects of napping or exercise, have a more complicated evidence base. The effects of napping, for example, seem to depend on the length and timing of napping, in conjunction with how much cumulative sleep an individual has had in recent nights.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge was {{appointed}} as the state's attorney general soon after arriving. In November 1797, he resigned and {{was elected to}} the Kentucky House of Representatives the next month. As a legislator, he secured passage of a more humane criminal code that abolished the death penalty for all offenses except first-degree murder. On a 1798 trip to Virginia, an intermediary gave him Thomas Jefferson's Kentucky Resolutions, which denounced the Alien and Sedition Acts. At Jefferson's request, Breckinridge assumed credit for the modified resolutions he shepherded through the Kentucky General Assembly; Jefferson's authorship was not discovered until after Breckinridge's death. He opposed calling a state constitutional convention in 1799 but was elected as a delegate. Due to his influence, the state's government remained comparatively aristocratic, maintaining protections for slavery <b>and</b> <b>limiting</b> the power of the electorate. Called the father of the resultant constitution, he emerged from the convention as the acknowledged leader of the state's Democratic-Republican Party and was selected Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1799 and 1800.|$|E

5|$|Chicago scored {{first in}} the second quarter of the preseason-ending game against Cleveland with David Fales' 19-yard {{touchdown}} pass to wide receiver Marc Mariani, after capitalizing on linebacker Lamarr Houston forcing Darius Jennings to fumble and Mitchell recovered. On the Browns' next drive, the Bears' linebacker Jonathan Anderson sacked Thad Lewis, leading to another fumble, this time recovered by defensive lineman Cornelius Washington; however, Gould missed a 43-yard field goal. In the third quarter, Fales was able to throw an 11-yard touchdown pass to Umodu after escaping Tank Carder's blitz. Later in the quarter, Sherrod Martin intercepted Lewis and scored on the ensuing 25-yard return. With 5:35 remaining in the game, Gould scored the final points of the game with a 28-yard field goal, as the Bears recorded the team's first preseason shutout since 1994. By the end of the game, the defense excelled, with seven sacks, three turnovers forced <b>and</b> <b>limiting</b> the Browns to 2.7 yards per play. The Bears concluded the preseason with a 3–1 record, while also not allowing a score in the second half across the four games; turnover-wise, the Bears forced ten, while allowing only one.|$|E
5|$|For a more {{accurate}} computation of the mass-radius relationship <b>and</b> <b>limiting</b> mass of a white dwarf, one must compute the equation of state which describes the relationship between density and pressure in the white dwarf material. If the density and pressure are both set equal to functions of the radius {{from the center of}} the star, the system of equations consisting of the hydrostatic equation together with the equation of state can then be solved to find the structure of the white dwarf at equilibrium. In the non-relativistic case, we will still find that the radius is inversely proportional to the cube root of the mass., eq. (80) Relativistic corrections will alter the result so that the radius becomes zero at a finite value of the mass. This is the limiting value of the mass—called the Chandrasekhar limit—at which the white dwarf can no longer be supported by electron degeneracy pressure. The graph on the right shows the result of such a computation. It shows how radius varies with mass for non-relativistic (blue curve) and relativistic (green curve) models of a white dwarf. Both models treat the white dwarf as a cold Fermi gas in hydrostatic equilibrium. The average molecular weight per electron, , has been set equal to 2. Radius is measured in standard solar radii and mass in standard solar masses.|$|E
5|$|Las Casas's first {{proposed}} remedy {{was a complete}} moratorium {{on the use of}} Indian labor in the Indies until such time as better regulations of it were set in place. This was meant simply to halt the decimation of the Indian population and to give the surviving Indians time to reconstitute themselves. Las Casas feared that at the rate the exploitation was proceeding it would be too late to hinder their annihilation unless action were taken rapidly. The second was a change in the labor policy so that instead of a colonist owning the labor of specific Indians, he would have a right to man-hours, to be carried out by no specific persons. This required the establishment of self-governing Indian communities on the land of colonists – who would themselves organize to provide the labor for their patron. The colonist would only have rights to a certain portion of the total labor, so that a part of the Indians were always resting and taking care of the sick. He proposed 12 other remedies, all having the specific aim of improving the situation for the Indians <b>and</b> <b>limiting</b> the powers that colonists were able to exercise over them.|$|E
