5|$|Hoffman {{provides}} the Group with information {{leading them to}} Pocatello, Idaho, {{where a group of}} even more cloned girls is found living in a commune. The police fear that a cult-involved suicide may be being planned, and they take the girls into protective custody. The girls are taken onto a bus as Black speaks to their biological father, a preacher confined to a negative pressure ventilator (Morgan Woodward). The man reveals to Black that he attempted to create a caste of pure <b>and</b> <b>innocent</b> people who could repopulate society benevolently after the cataclysm. He contacted some of the girls to let them know he would die before the apocalyptic date, and they committed suicide shortly afterwards. That night, a power cut stops the man's ventilator, killing him.|$|E
5|$|The election, meanwhile, had aroused papal {{suspicions of}} undue royal influence, <b>and</b> <b>Innocent</b> sent Stephen Langton, the exiled Archbishop of Canterbury to {{investigate}} Hugh {{and the circumstances}} of his election. Langton was also to investigate rumours that Hugh was not celibate, and had two daughters. The results of the investigation must have been satisfactory, as Hugh was consecrated on 20 December 1209 at Melun. The consecration was performed by Langton. Hugh was in exile in France until he returned to England on 16 July 1213. His only known activity while in exile was the writing of a will, which was dated November 1212 and was drawn up at St Martin de Garenne, near Paris.|$|E
5|$|The two {{character}} {{artists for}} the Persona series are Kazuma Kaneko, a central {{artist in the}} main Megami Tensei series who designed characters {{for the first three}} Persona games, and Shigenori Soejima, who worked in a secondary capacity alongside Kaneko and took Kaneko's place as the character designer from Persona 3 onwards. While designing the characters for Persona, Kaneko was inspired by multiple notable celebrities and fictional characters of the time, along with members of Atlus staff. In Persona <b>and</b> <b>Innocent</b> Sin, the main characters all wore the same school uniforms, so Kaneko differentiated them using accessories. For Eternal Punishment, the main cast were adults, so Kaneko needed to rethink his design procedure. Eventually, he adopted the concept of ordinary adults, and gave them designs that would stand out in-game.|$|E

5|$|Archie is {{visited by}} Peggy and he pleads {{with her to}} come home to him as she is the woman he loves. Peggy says she is not just a sweet <b>and</b> <b>innocent</b> old lady and that he has no idea whom he is messing with. She tells Archie if he does not leave the pub that night he will regret every cruel and evil act he has ever done. He tells her that unless she returns he will have the pub {{converted}} to flats. He then becomes emotional as he tells Peggy that he will be waiting for her as she walks out on him. Bradley walks in and punches Archie in the face twice but accidentally punches the bar as well, cutting his hand. He tells Archie to stay away from his girlfriend Stacey because she has said Archie raped her three months previously, and Bradley leaves. As Archie picks up his snowglobe from the floor, the bust of Queen Victoria is pushed from the bar and hits him on the head.|$|E
5|$|De Gray's {{ability to}} raise money made him useful to John. In 1213 de Gray mustered 500knights during a period when Philip II was {{threatening}} to invade England, bringing this force over from Ireland along with mounted men-at-arms to support the king in England. In May 1213, John <b>and</b> <b>Innocent</b> finally resolved the dispute over Langton's election to Canterbury, {{and part of the}} settlement was that John gave Ireland and England to Innocent and received them back from the pope, making John a papal vassal. The settlement was sealed with a treaty, to which de Gray was one of the witnesses. After John settled with the papacy, de Gray {{was not included in the}} general pardon, and had to go to Rome to be pardoned. While in that city the bishop was named as one of the guarantors of a new financial arrangement between the king and the pope dealing with feudal payments from England, which lowered the lump sum that had to be paid before Innocent would lift the interdict. After Innocent pardoned de Gray, the pope recommended his election as Bishop of Durham in 1213; but de Gray died during his journey back to England on 18 October 1214, at Saint-Jean-d'Angély in Poitou. He was buried in Norwich Cathedral, but his tomb has not survived.|$|E
