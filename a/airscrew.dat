The upper portion bears the wheelcase, supercharger and accessories; and carries the cylinder blocks, crankshaft main bearings (split mild-steel shells lined with lead bronze alloy), {{and part of the}} housing for the <b>airscrew</b> reduction gear. The lower half forms an oil sump and carries the oil pumps and filters.|$|E
25|$|By 1 October, 128 Type A barges {{had been}} {{converted}} to <b>airscrew</b> propulsion and, {{by the end of}} the month, this figure had risen to over 200.|$|E
25|$|The rear (pusher) engines {{could be}} swung upwards through 10° during {{take-off}} and landing, to prevent {{contact between the}} three-blade <b>airscrew</b> and water spray created by the forward propellers.|$|E

25|$|The second Berkeley was {{accepted}} by the Air Ministry in December 1925 and the all-metal third one in the following June. All three went to the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) for experimental flight. The second aircraft undertook comparative trials of a four-blade wooden <b>airscrew</b> against its original two-blade steel one. One of the three Berkeleys was still flying with the RAE {{at the end of}} 1930.|$|E
25|$|Two aluminium-alloy {{castings}} {{joined together}} on the horizontal centreline. The upper portion bears the wheelcase, cylinder blocks {{and part of the}} housing for the <b>airscrew</b> reduction gear; and carries the crankshaft main bearings (split mild-steel shells lined with lead–bronze alloy). The lower half forms an oil sump and carries the main pressure oil pump, supercharger change-speed operating pump and two scavenge pumps. It also houses the main coolant pump which is driven through the same gear-train as the oil pumps.|$|E
50|$|YB-36C:Projected {{version of}} the B-36B with six 4300 hp R-4360-51 engines driving tractor <b>airscrews,</b> not built and the {{prototype}} on order was cancelled.|$|R
50|$|By 1914 it had {{expanded}} into motor pressings; during World War I it made cowlings for Sopwith aircraft and in World War II it made <b>airscrews</b> for Spitfire and Hurricane aircraft.|$|R
50|$|The company's {{principal}} {{business was}} {{the development and}} production of <b>airscrews</b> using its Hydulignum laminated wood process to form the propeller blades. This product is still used today by the Permali group of companies.|$|R
25|$|The most {{significant}} difference between the C.IV and C.VII was the choice of the Maybach Mb IVa engine to replace the Mercedes D.IV. Although the Maybach engine was around 8% less powerful than the Mercedes (when measured at the sea level), it could continue to provide most of its power output while at altitude, where power from the Mercedes engine decreased more rapidly as height increased. Other changes included wings of slightly greater area and an <b>airscrew</b> of larger diameter. The crew were provided with oxygen generators and electrically-heated flight suits.|$|E
25|$|In early 1936, the {{airframe}} was completed; on 11 May 1936, the Type 138A {{was flown}} {{for the first}} time, powered by a standard Pegasus IV which drove a three-bladed propeller. For this maiden flight, it was piloted by Cyril Uwins, Bristol's chief test pilot, who had previously flown the Vickers Vespa on its world record flight. Two additional flights were performed at Filton prior to the aircraft being delivered to the RAE at Farnborough. The RAE {{conducted a series of}} tests of the pressure helmet prior to the aircraft being returned to Filton for the installation of the special Pegasus engine and a corresponding four-blade <b>airscrew.</b> On 5 September 1936, the Type 138A returned to Farnborough to commence test flights.|$|E
2500|$|The two {{crankshafts}} were {{geared to}} and drove a single common <b>airscrew</b> shaft. [...] The shaft was bored {{to accept a}} 37-mm gun barrel, and a clear passage was provided through the crankcase {{in line with the}} shaft boring for the same purpose.|$|E
5000|$|The {{company was}} formed as Rotol <b>Airscrews</b> in 1937 by Rolls-Royce and Bristol Engines {{to take over}} both companies' {{propeller}} development, the market being too small to support more than one company. The name is a contraction of [...] "ROlls-Royce" [...] and [...] "BrisTOL". Rotol's props were always considered leading edge, its models equipping the Hawker Hurricane, Supermarine Spitfire, and many other Second World War-era aircraft. By {{the end of the}} war it had introduced the first five-bladed propeller to see widespread use, used on late-model Spitfires. In 1943 the company changed name from Rotol <b>Airscrews</b> Limited to Rotol Limited, and in 1952 it acquired British Messier Limited, a specialist in landing gear and hydraulics.|$|R
50|$|Pénaud's later {{project for}} an {{amphibian}} aeroplane, although never built, incorporated other modern features. A tailless monoplane {{with a single}} vertical fin and twin tractor <b>airscrews,</b> it also featured hinged rear elevator and rudder surfaces, retractable undercarriage and a fully enclosed, instrumented cockpit.|$|R
5000|$|M.2, Città di Ferrara, Italian, {{first flight}} 1913, hull {{identical}} to the M.1, 83 metre long, 17 metre diameter, 4×125 PS driving two <b>airscrews,</b> payload 3000 kg, speed: 85 km/h, a Navy airship, stationed in Jesi, on 1915-06-08 shot down by an Austrian flying boat ...|$|R
2500|$|The famous French pilot Roland Garros {{was shot}} down on 18 April 1915. His {{aircraft}} had been fitted with a deflector device, whereby metal deflector wedges were fitted to the <b>airscrew.</b> [...] Garros was able to {{set fire to the}} airframe before being taken prisoner but the aircraft's gun and the armoured propeller remained intact and came into German hands.|$|E
2500|$|Both Glosters and RAE Farnborough {{used the}} Gorcocks for {{research}} for several years. [...] The second machine, for example {{was used for}} <b>airscrew</b> experiments, flying in 1929 {{with a variety of}} duralumin propellers. [...] The Gorcocks were also fitted with a variety of ventral radiators of different cross-sections and intake configurations. [...] Despite their research role, the Gorcocks flew armed with two Vickers machine guns in the nose.|$|E
2500|$|... had {{a rather}} abrupt, {{dome-shaped}} nose housing the [...] Hispano-Suiza 8Fb water-cooled V-8 engine and its [...] turbo-supercharger. The engine was mounted with its output shaft low down in the nose and drove a two-blade propeller. [...] Though this was of the wooden, fixed-pitch type, it was intended {{that it would be}} replaced by a variable-pitch Lavasseur <b>airscrew</b> later. A single, roughly cylindrical Lamblin radiator was suspended below the engine, between the undercarriage legs.|$|E
50|$|Propeller {{aircraft}} use {{one or more}} propellers (<b>airscrews)</b> {{to create}} thrust in a forward direction. The propeller is usually mounted {{in front of the}} power source in tractor configuration but can be mounted behind in pusher configuration. Variations of propeller layout include contra-rotating propellers and ducted fans.|$|R
5000|$|The two prototypes {{differed}} {{from each other}} chiefly in their powerplants. The first, [...] just known as the Avro 529, {{had a pair of}} uncowled Rolls-Royce Falcon water-cooled in-line engines mounted midway between the wings. Each produced 190 hp (140 kW) and drove four-bladed, opposite-handed wooden <b>airscrews.</b> It carried 140 gal (636 L) of fuel in a tank in the centre fuselage.The second machine, [...] designated the Avro 529A, had a pair 230 hp (170 kW) BHP in-line water-cooled engines, cowled and mounted in nacelles on the lower wing. These drove wooden, two-bladed <b>airscrews.</b> In this aircraft fuel was held in a pair of 60 gal (273 L), one in each nacelle. Fuel was pumped from these to 10 gal (45 L) tanks above the engines by wind-driven pumps, and fed to the motors under gravity.|$|R
2500|$|The Boulton & Paul P.12 Bodmin was an {{experimental}} British twin-engined biplane bomber with its engines mounted in a fuselage engine room and with tandem pairs of tractor and pusher <b>airscrews</b> mounted between the wings. [...] The two Bodmins built flew successfully in 1924, proving the concept, but the layout was not developed to production.|$|R
2500|$|The Planet Satellite {{designed}} by Major J.N. Dundas Heenan was a futuristic looking four-seater built of magnesium alloy in a true monocoque [...] "teardrop" [...] shaped fuselage with no internal reinforced structure. The Satellite was {{powered by a}} 250hp de Havilland Gipsy Queen 31 mounted amidships driving a two-blade Aeromatic [...] "pusher" [...] <b>airscrew</b> in the tail. Other notable features included [...] "butterfly" [...] tails and a retractable tricycle undercarriage, with the nosewheel retracting into a reinforced keel that {{ran the length of}} the underside of the fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{powered by}} a single {{water-cooled}} Napier Lion engine, initially a 470hp (350kW) mark V, mounted as low in the nose as <b>airscrew</b> ground clearance allowed so that {{the top of the}} fuselage could fall away in front of the cockpit for the best views during high-incidence carrier landings. There was a front-mounted radiator immediately beneath the propeller shaft. [...] The pilot sat below the upper wing just behind the rear spar and with a cutout for visibility. [...] The observer/gunner's position was close behind the pilot for ease of communication, since he had to do the work of navigation on long flights away from the carrier that had been traditionally assigned to a third crew member. [...] Behind them the fabric-covered fuselage carried a conventional tail with horn-balanced control surfaces, though the incidence of the whole tailplane could also be adjusted.|$|E
2500|$|Two Type 322s, {{which got}} the {{nickname}} [...] "Dumbo", were built. [...] Originally due for completion in early 1941, {{the project was}} delayed owing to the high priority then in force {{for the production of}} Spitfires. The first prototype (R1810) flew on 6 February 1943, followed by the second prototype (R1815) with the Merlin 32 in place of the Merlin 30, a four-blade rotol constant speed <b>airscrew,</b> a tail of greater area and alclad covered outer wings. [...] By this time, however, Fairey's competing design had entered service as the Fairey Barracuda, and the two Type 322s were used as experimental aircraft. A developed version was planned as the Supermarine type 380. [...] It was also intended that this wing technology was to the incorporated in a replacement for the Sea Otter – variable incidence benefiting seaplanes where the optimum angle of the floats can be maintained during takeoff and landing.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few other}} {{aircraft}} had already used a rotating wing, {{for example the}} Koolhoven FK.30 of 1927, which was a single-engined pod and boom pusher and the Guldentops monoplane of 1934. The Bee was also unusual in putting together what Flight called [...] "Twin-engined security, pusher <b>airscrews,</b> ample performance and vision, and non-acrobatic entry...", though in the end these qualities were not tested.|$|R
50|$|Two M-25 {{aircraft}} engines, producing 1450 hp altogether, propelled two <b>airscrews,</b> {{which were}} mounted inside vertical tunnels at {{bow and stern}} parts of the hull. The design documentation stipulated that the vehicle, weighing 8.5 ton, would hover at 200-250 mm above water or ground surface and travel at 120 km/h. Cornering was achieved by means of louvers, which regulated the flow of air.|$|R
50|$|The wing {{sections}} inboard of {{the engines}} were attached at a 30° dihedral angle, thus providing sufficient clearance for the <b>airscrews</b> from water-spray during takeoff. The wings were designed for high torsional stiffness, each comprising a box-spar with four tapered stainless steel tubular booms. Fuel tanks were mounted within the wings; sprung and braced wingtip floats were fitted. The wing surfaces were of fabric.|$|R
2500|$|Flight Lieutenant Stainforth {{was also}} one of the team in 1931 when the Trophy was won for the third time in a row, and thus the {{competition}} won outright. Following the Trophy triumph on 16 September, he had the chance to once again break the airspeed record. His first attempt was made in Supermarine S.6B S1596, in which he achieved 379mph. Following a minor taxiing accident during testing though, he caused S1596 to turn over and sink. Although she was recovered by divers the next day, he now transferred to S1595. This was another S.6B, which could also be fitted with the same specially prepared 2,600bhp Rolls-Royce R [...] "sprint" [...] engine, serial R27 and <b>airscrew</b> for the record attempt. The engine was using a specially prepared fuel mixture of petrol, methanol and ethyl. Starting the engine was uneasy and there was considerable danger of engine explosion.|$|E
5000|$|An {{aircraft}} {{constructed with}} a tractor configuration has the engine mounted with the <b>airscrew</b> {{in front of}} it so that the aircraft is [...] "pulled" [...] through the air, as opposed to the pusher configuration, in which the <b>airscrew</b> is behind and propels the aircraft forward. Through common usage, the word [...] "propeller" [...] has come to mean any <b>airscrew,</b> whether it actually propels or pulls the plane.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Airscrew</b> {{became a}} limited company in 1931, and by 1938 had formed Jicwood Ltd as {{a joint venture}} between Itself and Halila, Ltd., of Bush House, London. The nominal capital of £36,000 was taken up between the <b>Airscrew</b> Co. and Halila. The board {{consisted}} of Mr. J. D. Titler (chairman), Dr. H. C. Watts (co-designer of the Leitner Watts propeller), Mr. R. Bradfield and Mr. F. T. Swann. Mr. Swann, who was a director of Halila, Ltd., joined the board of The <b>Airscrew</b> Co.(Flight of 9 December 1937) ...|$|E
5000|$|Later {{that night}} Robur kidnaps the Weldon Institute's secretary, president, and the president's valet. He takes them on board his ship, a huge, battery-powered, {{multirotor}} gyrodyne called the Albatross, which has many vertical <b>airscrews</b> to provide lift, and two horizontal <b>airscrews</b> in a push-pull configuration {{to drive the}} vessel forward. It bears the same black flag with golden sun that has been sighted on so many landmarks, and the music in the sky is explained {{to be one of}} the crewmen playing a trumpet. To demonstrate the vessel's superiority, Robur takes his captives around the world in the course of three weeks. The president and secretary are angry at Robur for kidnapping them and unwilling to admit that the Albatross is a fantastic vessel, or that their notions of [...] "lighter than air" [...] superiority are wrong. They demand that Robur release them, but he is aloof and always says that they shall remain as long as he desires it. Fearing they will be held captive forever, the two formulate plans to both escape and destroy the Albatross.|$|R
25|$|The 650hp (490kW) Condor engine drove a two-blade {{propeller}} and had, after some Air Ministry input, a nose-mounted radiator under the propeller shaft. The Ministry advised that {{the wings of}} the first two Berkeleys of the three specified in the contract should have wooden wings for speed of completion, with the third to be all metal. Leitner-Watts Metal <b>airscrews</b> were required for the second and third machine. The first Berkeley flew on 5 March 1925.|$|R
50|$|Lang formed {{another company}} A. D. Lang Ltd. In 1921 it was {{described}} as being general manufacturers, buying and selling agents, printers, lithographers, manufacturers of chemicals with offices at 4, Vigo Street, London W1.In addition to his work in developing propellers and associated equipment, Lang found time in 1923 to patent a wheel for vehicles.In 1936 Lang joined the Board of Hordern-Richmond, another British company that was closely involved {{in the development and}} production of <b>airscrews</b> and propellers.|$|R
