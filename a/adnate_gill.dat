50|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Cortinarius austrovenetus are smooth with a convex or flat cap {{that can be}} up to 16 cm across. The pigment has been {{isolated}} and described as austrovenetin. They have yellowy brown; <b>adnate</b> <b>gills</b> underneath the cap.|$|R
50|$|The Parrot Toadstool {{is a small}} mushroom, with a convex to umbonate cap 1-3 {{centimetres}} (⅓-1 in) in diameter, {{which is}} green when young and later yellowish or even pinkish tinged. The 2-4 cm stipe is green to greenish yellow. The broad <b>adnate</b> <b>gills</b> are greenish with yellow edges and spore print white. The green colouring persists at the stem apex even in old specimens.|$|R
50|$|A small waxcap with an {{initially}} bell-shaped, {{and later}} flattening, cap 2-5 cm (¾-2 in) across, scarlet in colour and slimy in texture. The <b>adnate</b> <b>gills</b> are thick and widely spaced, yellow red in colour. The spore print is white. The ringless stipe is up 2-5 cm (¾-2 in) high and 0.3-1 cm (⅛-⅓ in) wide, red with a yellowish base. The flesh is yellowish-red {{and the smell}} and taste faint. The oval spores measure 7-9.5 x 4-5 μm.|$|R
5000|$|It is a large, {{imposing}} mushroom, with a convex cap 3 - 11 cm {{in diameter}} with a boss. [...] The cap is sticky when wet {{and has an}} irregularly lobed margin. It is dark grey in colour with darker grey to blackish streaks perpendicular to the margins. The grey colour fades towards the margins and may be tinged with yellow or purple. The crowded <b>adnate</b> <b>gills</b> are white, and the solid stipe is white with a yellow tinge at the top. It measures 3.5 - 12 cm high and 1 - 3 cm wide. [...] The spore print is white.|$|R
50|$|The cap {{ranges from}} 2.5 to 7 cm (1-3 in) in diameter, and is {{initially}} convex before flattening. It has a slight boss that is mustard-, honey- or cream-yellow tinged and steely blue elsewhere. The <b>adnate</b> <b>gills</b> are creamy or lilac-tinged early, and darken with the spores. The slender 5-7.5 cm (2-3 in) stipe lacks a ring; it is pale yellow or white with {{a tinge of}} the cap colour. The flesh is yellowish and may have a lilac or pale blue tinge. The spore print is reddish brown and the oval to round spores measure 8.5 &times; 6.5 µm. There is no particular taste or smell. Potassium hydroxide will produce a pink-purple reaction in the stipe or cap. The mycelium is white.|$|R
50|$|It has a 5 - 12 cm (2 - 5 in) {{diameter}} cap {{which is}} yellowish in colour-darker in the centre and paler on the edges. The stipe is 7 - 17 cm (3 - 7 in) high and 1 - 2.5 cm (0.4 - 1 in) thick and swollen at the base, and is white up top and yellow lower down and bears the tan or brown {{remnants of the}} veil. The <b>adnate</b> <b>gills,</b> which are hidden by a cream or white veil when young, are cream or lilac early on, and darken with the spores, which give a rusty coloured spore print. The almond-shaped spores measure 10 - 12.5 &times; 5.5 - 7 µm. The flesh is cream-coloured and the taste mild.|$|R
25|$|The way {{the gills}} {{attach to the}} top of the stalk is an {{important}} feature of mushroom morphology. Mushrooms in the genera Agaricus, Amanita, Lepiota and Pluteus, among others, have free gills that do not extend {{to the top of}} the stalk. Others have decurrent gills that extend down the stalk, as in the genera Omphalotus and Pleurotus. There are a great number of variations between the extremes of free and decurrent, collectively called attached gills. Finer distinctions are often made to distinguish the types of attached gills: <b>adnate</b> <b>gills,</b> which adjoin squarely to the stalk; notched gills, which are notched where they join the top of the stalk; adnexed gills, which curve upward to meet the stalk, and so on. These distinctions between attached gills are sometimes difficult to interpret, since gill attachment may change as the mushroom matures, or with different environmental conditions.|$|R
50|$|The name {{is derived}} from the Greek entos (ἐντός) meaning inner and lóma (λῶμα) meaning fringe from the in-rolled margin. The Swedish mycologist Elias Magnus Fries {{classified}} all pink-spored gilled fungi in a series Hyporhodius within his large genus Agaricus, subdividing into five tribes based on cap shape, gills and size in 1821. He later refined this in 1838, placing those with universal veils into tribe Volvaria, those with free gills and a discrete stipe into tribe Pluteus, those with a Tricholoma-like shape into tribe Entoloma, and those with a depressed cap and decurrent gills into tribe Clitopilus. The small tribe Leptonia had convex fleshy membranaceous caps, the tribe Nolanea, were slender fungi with bell-shaped caps and hollow stems, and lastly tribe Eccilia had umblicilate caps and <b>adnate</b> <b>gills.</b> Paul Kummer raised Entoloma, Nolanea, Leptonia and Eccilia to genus-level in 1871, though Lucien Quélet created a new genus Rhodophyllus uniting all those fungi with pinkish-red <b>adnate</b> or sinuate <b>gills</b> and angular spores, similar in scope to the original Hyporhodius. The two classifications coexisted until recently, with those taxonomists favoring a broader genus concept following Quélet, and the others Kummer. French mycologist Henri Romagnesi took up study of the genus in what was to last over forty years, describing new species and creating a new infrageneric classification {{making it one of the}} most studied and best known agaric genera to date. Over time, more authors and texts have followed Kummer.|$|R
50|$|Multifurca is morphologically {{intermediate}} between Lactarius and Russula: Fruitbodies have <b>adnate</b> to subdecurrent <b>gills</b> and are zonate; latex (as in Lactarius and Lactifluus) {{is present}} only in M. furcata; spore print is orange; spores themselves {{are very small}} with only faint ornamentation.|$|R
5000|$|... "Pileus 3 ins. (7.5 cm.) in diameter, infundibuliform, matt, reddish-fawn. <b>Gills</b> <b>adnate,</b> {{moderately}} close, pallid becoming spotted and discoloured brown. Stem short, µm, in. (18 mm.) high, stout (9/16 in., 16 mm.), expanded {{towards the}} pileus, attenuated downwards, solid, colour of the pileus, milk white. Taste mild. Spores slightly angular, 8 µm.|$|R
5|$|L. vellereus {{is larger}} {{with a thick}} stipe, woolly cap and less crowded gills, but is not as tall. Russula delica is similar in colour and shape, though has <b>adnate</b> blue-green tinged <b>gills</b> and no milk. L. deceptivus is also similar, but is {{differentiated}} by its less crowded gills, firmer cap margin and less acrid milk. Close to L. piperatus is L. glaucescens, which is differentiated by its milk that dries with a greenish colour.|$|R
500|$|The <b>gills</b> are <b>adnate</b> (with <b>gills</b> broadly {{attached}} to the stem, slightly above {{the bottom of the}} gill, with most of the gill fused to the stem) or slightly rounded next to the stem. The individual gills are close to subdistant, with between 10–14 reaching the stem, and two or three tiers of lamellulae (short gills that do not reach the stem). The gills are moderately broad, pale orange to whitish, often yellowish at the base and whitish along the edges. The stem is [...] long, and up to 1mm thick; flexuous (winding from side to side), brittle, with the base covered with sharp, straight, and stiff white hairs. The surface is densely white-pruinose initially, but soon becomes naked with a subsequent color shift to orange-yellow or lemon yellow. This species has been described as [...] "a delight to behold", but [...] "one usually has to get down on hands and knees to find it!" ...|$|R
2500|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Gymnopilus cyanopalmicola have yellow, convex to plane caps [...] in diameter, with fibrillose scales that are erect {{near the center}} and appressed near the margin. [...] The gills are crowded, ventricose, with <b>adnate</b> to decurrent <b>gill</b> attachment. [...] The stem is [...] long by [...] thick, cylindrical, , {{tapering}} at the base in larger fruit bodies. [...] It is colored yellowish white, and turns purple, dark reddish or dark brown when bruised or dried. [...] The stipe has a conspicuous but soon fading membranous yellowish-white annulus. [...] The pileus trama is light yellow, similar {{to the color of}} the cap. [...] The odor is fungal.|$|R
50|$|The basidiocarp (mushroom) has a {{white to}} cream cap {{that can be}} sticky when wet and grows to 15 cm (6 in) across. The cap margin is inturned in young {{mushrooms}} and wavy in older ones. The <b>adnate</b> to decurrent <b>gills</b> are white when young, turning red-brown with age as the spores mature. The spore print is red-brown. The stout white stipe is mostly underground, extending up to 3.5 cm (1.4 in) above the surface and up to 30 cm (12 in) below it. It is up to 2.5 cm (1 in) thick. The oval warty spores are 10 μm long by 6 μm wide.|$|R
50|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Gymnopilus cyanopalmicola have yellow, convex to plane caps 5 to 10 cm in diameter, with fibrillose scales that are erect {{near the center}} and appressed near the margin.

5|$|For {{many years}} Quélet's name and {{description}} {{were treated as}} valid because Bulliard's name antedated Persoon's. However, in 1950, {{a change in the}} International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (termed the Stockholm Code, after the city where the International Botanical Congress was being held) caused only names on fungi published after 1801 or 1821 (depending on their type) to be valid. This meant that suddenly Bulliard's name was no longer a valid name, and now it was Persoon's name that had priority. Nonetheless it was a well-known name, and the already chaotic situation caused by a change to a famous Latin name was further complicated by another of Quélet's suggestions. He had in 1886 proposed a new, broader genus that included all pink-gilled fungi with <b>adnate</b> or sinuate <b>gills</b> and angular spores: Rhodophyllus. These two approach to genus placement, using either Rhodophyllus or Entoloma, coexisted for many decades, with mycologists and guidebooks following either; Henri Romagnesi, who studied the genus for over forty years, favoured Rhodophyllus, as initially did Rolf Singer. However, most other authorities have tended to favour Entoloma, and Singer conceded the name was far more widely used and adopted it for his Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy text in 1986.|$|R
500|$|The gills appear closely spaced in {{unexpanded}} caps, {{but usually}} more distant in old individuals. Between 8 and 16 gills extend from the margin to the stipe; there are additionally {{one or two}} tiers of small gills (lamellulae) that do not reach fully from the margin to the stipe. The gills are narrow but become [...] (swelling in the middle) and sometimes very broad in age, and are attached by a line or are very narrowly <b>adnate.</b> Sometimes the <b>gills</b> split away from the stipe while remaining attached to each other; in this way they form a collar around the stipe. Gills are pale gray but soon become whitish, with even edges. The stipe is [...] long, 0.5–1mm thick, and, above {{the level of the}} flat circular disc at the base, is equal in width throughout. The stipe is covered with fine white scattered fibrils, or is delicately [...] (as if covered with a fine white powder), but it later becomes smooth. Its color is bluish-gray when fresh but soon it fades to gray. The basal disc is grooved (from gill impressions) and pruinose or covered with fine minute hairs, but soon becomes smooth. The insubstantial fruit bodies are considered inedible.|$|R
