2500|$|Since its founding, Benefis {{had been}} {{accredited}} by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) (which {{is now known}} as the Joint Commission). Under federal law and in most states, JCAHO accreditation was a condition of licensure and permitted a health care facility to receive Medicaid, Medicare, TRICARE, or Indian Health Service reimbursement. However, Section 125 of the Medicare Improvement for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (MIPPA) changed JCAHO's <b>accreditation</b> <b>authority.</b> [...] As of July 15, 2010, JCAHO had to seek approval from a federal agency, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid (CMS), for it to retain its accrediting power. [...] CMS was required under MIPPA to also permit at least two other accrediting agencies to [...] "deem" [...] healthcare facilities ready to receive federal healthcare funds, and to offer accreditation directly to healthcare facilities. As of 2011, the Joint Commission accredited 82 percent of the hospitals in the United States.|$|E

In their efforts toward professionalization, biobanks can nowadays seek certification or accreditation. One of the requirements of these standards is regular participation in Proficiency Testing (PT) programs.

This PT program includes biospecimen testing schemes, as well as biospecimen processing interlaboratory exercises.

40|$|Introduction: Accreditation is {{necessary}} to maintain the quality of medical education. It requires official bodies to authorize the accreditation; recognized standards against which the medical school can be judged; and a robust process. Effects of accreditation: Accreditation may have positive effects on medical education. The impact of {{the publication of the}} General Medical Council recommendations in Tomorrow‚Ä≤s Doctors provides a good example. In contrast, out-of-date requirements may inhibit developments in medical schools. Role of accreditation authorities: If <b>accreditation</b> <b>authorities</b> are to provide leadership in medical education they must undertake regular review of their standards. This should be informed by all stakeholders and include experts in medical education. The format of the standards must provide clear direction to medical schools. Accreditation should take place regularly and should result in the production of a publicly accessible report...|$|R

Yet, there is no manual for MMT programs to follow {{when it comes to}} SAM, and clinics are provided relatively little specific guidance from federal, state, or <b>accreditation</b> <b>authorities.</b> Consequently, most MMT clinics follow procedures based on tradition or convenience, while adhering to the minimal regula-tions that currently exist. Monetary constraints also are a con-cern, but there often is acceptance of whatever SAM approaches are most readily available, rather than adopting more compelling patient-centered strategies. This report examines evidence-based principles and expert opinions that can help define best practices for SAM in MMT...|$|R
