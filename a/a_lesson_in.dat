5|$|Nearly {{a century}} later, during {{the crash of}} the Mississippi Company and the South Sea Company in about 1720, tulip mania {{appeared}} in satires of these manias. When Johann Beckmann first described tulip mania in the 1780s, he compared it to the failing lotteries of the time. In Goldgar's view, even many modern popular works about financial markets, such as Burton Malkiel's A Random Walk Down Wall Street (1973) and John Kenneth Galbraith's A Short History of Financial Euphoria (1990; written soon after the crash of 1987), used the tulip mania as <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>in</b> morality. Tulip mania again became a popular reference during the dot-com bubble of 1995–2001.|$|E

The asylum also has inhabitants who are in games of their own, ordered to kill Tapp. Along the way, Tapp uncovers the origins of Jigsaw and the motives behind his tests.

5|$|A {{different}} {{version of}} this tale narrates that when the youngest daughter-in-law was pregnant, she secretly ate the food-offerings ritually dedicated to Shashthi and then blamed the theft on the black cat. Angered by the dishonour of its mistress and the unjust accusation of theft, the cat pledged to teach the young mother <b>a</b> <b>lesson.</b> <b>In</b> {{this version of the}} tale, the cat not only stole her six children, but also ate them. But when the seventh child was born, the mother caught the cat fleeing with her child and followed it but tripped in middle of the chase and fainted. The cat took the infant to Shashthi's abode, where she told the goddess the whole tale of her insult. The benign goddess, however, was annoyed with the cat and rushed to the aid of the mother. The goddess explained the reason of her suffering, and after the mother had begged the cat for forgiveness and had sworn to worship Shashthi on anointed days, all seven of her children were returned to her.|$|E

25|$|For the {{farewell}} season, {{the best}} friends hit the road again for an overnight camping trip at Yosemite National Park. Park ranger Shelton Johnson wrote to Winfrey because he was concerned by the low number of African-Americans who visited the national parks each year. So Winfrey and King packed up their camper and headed to Yosemite to help Johnson attract visitors. When they arrived, Johnson took Winfrey and King around the park {{to see some of}} its famous sites including Mariposa Grove and the Tunnel View, where El Capitan is visible in the distance. On the way to the campsite, Winfrey made a sharp turn causing their trailer to hit a rock. After setting up their pop-up camper, the two mixed up some Moscow Mules to pass out to their camping neighbors. The drink has become a signature Oprah cocktail. The next day they took <b>a</b> <b>lesson</b> <b>in</b> fly fishing and wrapped up their stay with a mule ride.|$|E

500|$|<b>A</b> <b>Lesson</b> <b>in</b> Romantics is {{the debut}} studio album by American rock band Mayday Parade. The band {{resulted}} from the merger of Kid Named Chicago and Defining Moment. In June 2006 the band released an EP, Tales Told by Dead Friends, which they sold to people by following the 2006 edition of Warped Tour and offering copies; it eventually sold 10,000 copies. The band signed to Fearless Records in August. <b>A</b> <b>Lesson</b> <b>in</b> Romantics was recorded in early 2007 with producers Zack Odom and Kenneth Mount. Vocalist/guitarist Jason Lancaster left the band in March 2007 citing a lack of writing credit on the band's releases.

500|$|<b>A</b> <b>Lesson</b> <b>in</b> Romantics is {{considered}} a fan favorite. Daniel Thompson of Music Emissions wrote that: [...] "every song is spectacular on this album and is a potential hit." [...] Despite its eventual success and acclaim, <b>A</b> <b>Lesson</b> <b>In</b> Romantics received little attention from professional music critics. Reviewers noted the improved sound from the band's debut EP, Tales Told by Dead Friends. Joe DeAndrea from AbsolutePunk.net wrote that: [...] "after their unimpressive release of the EP Tales Told By Dead Friends in November, the band's back with their debut album that will surely become one of your most played of the Summer." [...] Sputnikmusic reviewer Adam Knott gave the album a score of 4.5 out of 5, calling it [...] "a {{hell of a lot}} better" [...] than most pop punk records.|$|E
500|$|<b>A</b> <b>Lesson</b> <b>in</b> Romantics was reissued on April 28, 2008, {{featuring}} {{an acoustic}} version of [...] "Three Cheers for Five Years", {{as well as}} [...] "One Man Drinking Games".

500|$|The band {{also did}} {{commentary}} for every track on the album.
