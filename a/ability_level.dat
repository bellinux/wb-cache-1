25|$|The IRF {{gives the}} {{probability}} that a person with a given <b>ability</b> <b>level</b> will answer correctly. Persons with lower ability have less of a chance, while persons with high ability are very likely to answer correctly; for example, students with higher math ability are more likely to get a math item correct. The exact value of the probability depends, in addition to ability, on a set of item parameters for the IRF.|$|E
25|$|Education {{takes place}} in three stages: primary, secondary, and pre-university education. Only the primary level is compulsory. Students begin with six years of primary school, which {{is made up of}} a {{four-year}} foundation course and a two-year orientation stage. The curriculum is focused on the development of English, the mother tongue, mathematics, and science. Secondary school lasts from four to five years, and is divided between Special, Express, Normal (Academic), and Normal (Technical) streams in each school, depending on a student's <b>ability</b> <b>level.</b> The basic coursework breakdown is the same as in the primary level, although classes are much more specialised. Pre-university education takes place over two to three years at senior schools, mostly called Junior Colleges.|$|E
25|$|Differential item {{functioning}} (DIF), {{sometimes referred}} to as measurement bias, is a phenomenon when participants from different groups (ex gender, race, disability) with the same latent abilities give different answers to specific questions on the same IQ test. DIF analysis measures such specific items on a test alongside measuring participants latent abilities on other similar questions. A consistent different group response to a specific question among similar type of questions can indicate an effect of DIF. It does not count as differential item functioning if both groups have equally valid chance of giving different responses to the same questions. Such bias can be a result of culture, educational level and other factors that are independent of group traits. DIF is only considered if test-takers from different groups with the same underlying latent <b>ability</b> <b>level</b> have a different chance of giving specific responses. Such questions are usually removed {{in order to make the}} test equally fair for both groups. Common techniques for analyzing DIF are item response theory (IRT) based methods, Mantel-Haenszel, and logistic regression.|$|E

25|$|IQ {{tests are}} updated periodically. For example, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), {{originally}} developed in 1949, was updated in 1974, in 1991, 2003 {{and again in}} 2014. The revised versions are standardized based {{on the performance of}} test-takers in standardization samples. A standard score of IQ 100 is defined as the median performance of the standardization sample. Thus one way to see changes in norms over time is to conduct a study in which the same test-takers take both an old and new version of the same test. Doing so confirms IQ gains over time. Some IQ tests, for example tests used for military draftees in NATO countries in Europe, report raw scores, and those also confirm a trend of rising scores over time. The average rate of increase seems to be about three IQ points per decade in the United States, as scaled by the Wechsler tests. The increasing test performance over time appears on every major test, in every age range, at every <b>ability</b> <b>level,</b> and in every modern industrialized country, although not necessarily {{at the same rate as}} in the United States. The increase has been continuous and roughly linear from the earliest days of testing to the present. Though the effect is most associated with IQ increases, a similar effect has been found with increases in attention and of semantic and episodic memory.|$|E
500|$|The Fontainebleau scale {{follows a}} similar system, with each {{numerical}} grade {{divided into three}} ratings with the letters a, b, and c. For example, Fontainebleau 7A roughly corresponds with V6, while Fontainebleau 7C+ is equivalent to V10. In both systems, grades are further differentiated by appending [...] "+" [...] to indicate a small increase in difficulty. Despite this level of specificity, ratings of individual problems are often controversial, as <b>ability</b> <b>level</b> {{is not the only}} factor that affects how difficult a problem will be for a particular climber. Height, arm length, flexibility, and other body characteristics can also be relevant.|$|E

Pooling players of all <b>ability</b> <b>levels</b> {{leads to a}} systematic bias in regression coefficients.

2500|$|A {{number of}} factors other than purely the <b>ability</b> <b>level</b> of the bowler {{have an effect on}} a player's bowling average. Most {{significant}} among these are the different eras in which cricket has been played. The bowling average tables in Test and first-class cricket are headed by players who competed in the nineteenth century, a period when pitches were uncovered and some were so badly looked after that they had rocks on them. Other factors which provided an advantage to bowlers in that era was the lack of significant safety equipment; batting gloves and helmets were not worn, and batsmen had to be warier. Other variations are caused by frequent matches against stronger or weaker opposition, changes in the laws of cricket and the length of matches. The bowlers competing in the Howa Bowl, a competition played in South African during the apartheid-era, restricted to non-white players, during which time, according to Vincent Barnes: [...] "Most of the wickets we played on were underprepared. For me, as a bowler, it was great." ...|$|E
2500|$|It may be {{the case}} that a player does not know exactly what the payoffs of the game are or of what type his opponents are. This sort of game has {{incomplete}} information. In extensive form it is represented as a game with complete but imperfect information using the so-called Harsanyi transformation. This transformation introduces to the game the notion of nature's choice or God's choice. Consider a game consisting of an employer considering whether to hire a job applicant. The job applicant's ability might be one of two things: high or low. His <b>ability</b> <b>level</b> is random; he is low ability with probability 1/3 and high ability with probability 2/3. In this case, it is convenient to model nature as another player of sorts who chooses the applicant's ability according to those probabilities. Nature however does not have any payoffs. [...] Nature's choice is represented in the game tree by a non-filled node. Edges coming from a nature's choice node are labelled with the probability of the event it represents occurring.|$|E
