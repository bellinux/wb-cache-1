5|$|<b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>rule,</b> {{since that}} time, {{the armed forces}} have not intervened in {{politics}} as a body, rather being tossed and turned as ambitious men have shaken the country.

50|$|VP/MS is industry-neutral - it is {{a generic}} tool {{that is not}} {{designed}} to be used exclusively within a specific industry. VP/MS has been deployed within non-insurance applications <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>rules</b> engine. However, since it was developed within an insurance context, VP/MS is applied broadly and extensively in insurance.|$|R
60|$|I will {{submit a}} {{proposition}} to the House <b>as</b> <b>a</b> broad, <b>general</b> <b>rule.</b> I daresay the Leader of the Opposition may rake up some ingenious, hard case {{in conflict with}} it; but <b>as</b> <b>a</b> broad, <b>general</b> <b>rule</b> I {{believe it will be}} found true {{to say that there is}} no power in a Government to impose indirect taxation outside the limits of its territorial sovereignty. Although I am quite ready to admit that, by sudden and unexpected alterations of the tariff, temporary advantage might be gained, and some share of the wealth of other people and other countries might be netted for this or that set of traders within your own border, in the long run the whole yield of any tax, export or import, will come home to the people of that country by whom it is imposed. It will come home plus the whole cost of collecting the tax, and plus, further, the inconvenience and burden of the network of taxation which is needed. It will come home to them, if they be consumers, in the quantity, quality, or price of the articles they consume, and, if exporters, in the profit, convenience, or reserve power of the business which they conduct.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the laws}} of medical {{malpractice}} differ significantly between nations, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> broad <b>general</b> <b>rule</b> liability follows when a health care practitioner does not show a fair, reasonable and competent degree of skill when providing medical care to a patient. If a practitioner holds himself out <b>as</b> <b>a</b> specialist {{a higher degree of}} skill is required. Jurisdictions have also been increasingly receptive to claims based on informed consent, raised by patients who allege that they were not adequately informed of the risks of medical procedures before agreeing to treatment.|$|R
5|$|<b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>rule,</b> {{there is}} no {{requirement}} for particular formalities in trust instruments, they can be oral or written. The only requirement is that they show an intention to create a trust.

5|$|In the 1890s, mixed lodges {{following}} a standard Masonic ritual started {{to appear in}} France, and quickly spread to other countries. Women-only jurisdictions appeared soon afterwards. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>rule,</b> the admission of women is now recognised in Continental (Grand Orient) jurisdictions. In Anglo-American Freemasonry, neither mixed nor all-female lodges are officially recognised, although unofficial relations can be cordial, with premises sometimes shared.|$|E
5|$|The larvae {{that emerge}} from the eggs, known as tadpoles (or {{occasionally}} polliwogs), typically have oval bodies and long, vertically flattened tails. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>rule,</b> free-living larvae are fully aquatic, {{but at least one}} species (Nannophrys ceylonensis) has semiterrestrial tadpoles which live among wet rocks. Tadpoles lack eyelids and have cartilaginous skeletons, lateral line systems, gills for respiration (external gills at first, internal gills later), and vertically flattened tails they use for swimming.|$|E
50|$|In {{practice}} Aristotle {{explains that}} people tend more by nature towards pleasures, and therefore see virtues as being relatively {{closer to the}} less obviously pleasant extremes. While every case can be different, given the difficulty of getting the mean perfectly right it is indeed often most important to guard against going the pleasant and easy way. However this {{rule of thumb is}} shown in later parts of the Ethics to apply mainly to some bodily pleasures, and is shown to be wrong <b>as</b> <b>an</b> accurate <b>general</b> <b>rule</b> in Book X.|$|R

What is to be prevented is the seizure of these heights for the purpose of establishing batteries to destroy the navy-yard and arsenal. For this purpose the works should be self-sustaining, or relying only upon such aid as a small movable body of troops can furnish, and upon succor, which may be thrown over the Branch after an attack is developed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Shortly after proposing Dempster’s <b>rule</b> of {{combination}} <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> aggregation <b>rule</b> {{for evidence}} from independent sources, Zadeh formulated an annoying example for which Dempster’s rule seemed to produce counter-intuitive results. Since then, many authors have used Zadeh’s example either to criticize Demster-Shafer theory <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole, or <b>as</b> <b>a</b> motivation for constructing alternative combination rules. This paper {{shows that the}} counter-intuition of Zadeh’s example {{is not a problem}} of Dempster’s rule, but a problem of Zadeh’s model that does not correspond to reality. Two different ways to fix the problem will be discussed, showing that Dempster’s rule of combination perfectly behaves as one would expect. 1,...|$|R
2500|$|The word {{comes from}} German Zug 'move' + Zwang 'compulsion', so that Zugzwang means 'being {{forced to make}} a move'. Originally the term was used interchangeably with the term zugpflicht 'obligation to make <b>a</b> move' <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> game <b>rule.</b> Games like chess and {{checkers}} have [...] "zugzwang" [...] (or [...] "zugpflicht"): a player MUST always make a move on his turn even if this is to his disadvantage. Tabletop war games or role playing games have not: on his turn a player can simply decide to [...] "wait" [...] or [...] "do nothing". Over time however the term became especially associated with chess.|$|R
5|$|The common {{term for}} a place at which one may dive is a dive site. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>rule,</b> {{professional}} diving is done where the work needs to be done, and recreational diving is done where conditions are suitable. There are many recorded and publicised recreational dive sites which {{are known for their}} convenience, points of interest, and frequently favourable conditions. Diver training facilities for both professional and recreational divers generally use a small range of dive sites which are familiar and convenient, and where conditions are predictable and the risk is relatively low.|$|E
5|$|The three circulars list {{various types}} of cost or expense item (such as travel expense, {{maintenance}} expense, payroll salaries, lobbying costs, purchase of materials, payment of utility bills, etc.), and establishes whether each is either allowable or unallowable. Allowable costs are those the federal government determines permissible for federal assistance. Unallowable costs are those the government prohibits incurring for federal assistance. Certain cost items are considered universally unallowable, such as cost related to illegal activities and lobbying costs, but others may be considered unallowable for a type of recipient while being allowable for another type of recipient. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>rule,</b> any assistance used inappropriately, such as incurring unallowable costs, requires reimbursement to the federal government.|$|E
5|$|A new Baroque {{building}} was constructed on {{site of the}} first Castellania by the same Grand Master, creating significant employment as Pinto had hoped for, with works commencing in 1757. Throughout the course of construction, prisoners were held in a torre near Valletta's Porta Reale, probably the tower of Saint James Cavalier. The new Castellania was built to a design by the architect Francesco Zerafa, but he died before its completion, so he was substituted by the architect Giuseppe Bonici. Zerafa is accredited for the main design, and for the subjected building he has post mortem {{established himself as a}} respected architect. The edifice was completed in 1760, with its chapel being consecrated on 15 November of that year. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>rule,</b> buildings in Valletta were required to be ready within three-years period from start to completion. The prisoners were transferred to the new prison three days later, on 18 November 1760.|$|E
50|$|It is {{not certain}} what title, if any, Serlio {{intended}} for the work <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole—possibly <b>General</b> <b>Rules</b> of Architecture, as is given on the first-published book, but this soon became attached specifically to that book. Various collections were known as the Five or Seven Books on Architecture, depending on their content. Often it is referred to simply as Serlio's Architettura, and several significant editions take the title Tutte l'opere d'architettura et prospetiva ("All the works on architecture and perspective"); though {{the first time that}} all nine existing books (or even all seven numbered books) were in fact published in a single edition was in the 2-volume English translation of 1996-2001.|$|R
5000|$|Vecino was {{the blanket}} term for {{community}} member in Spain and colonial and independent Spanish America, and is rather more extensive than the modern [...] "citizen", implying ownership {{of property and}} respectability. The criteria for being a vecino were never defined in legislation, but rather conceived of <b>as</b> <b>a</b> natural, <b>general</b> <b>rule.</b> It is <b>a</b> nuanced, personal status directly related to a person's standing within the community. Shaped by the conditions in the colony, the term took on a broader meaning in the Americas than it had in Spain itself, where citizenship and nationality were not concerns for most, and where the racial makeup was more homogenous.|$|R
5000|$|Because some {{institutional}} frameworks are realities always [...] "nested" [...] inside other broader institutional frameworks, {{the clear}} demarcation is always blurred. A {{case in point}} is a university. When the average quality of its teaching services must be evaluated, for example, a university may be approached <b>as</b> <b>an</b> organization with its people, physical capital, the <b>general</b> governing <b>rules</b> common to all that were passed by the its governing bodies etc. However, if the task consists of evaluating people's performance in a specific teaching department, for example, along with their own internal formal and informal rules, it, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> whole, enters the picture <b>as</b> <b>an</b> institution. <b>General</b> <b>rules,</b> then, form part of the broader institutional framework influencing the people's performance at the said teaching department.|$|R
5|$|A pair of aces {{gives the}} {{blackjack}} player a starting hand value of either a 2 or a soft 12 {{which is a}} problematic starting hand in either case. Splitting aces gives a player two chances to hit 21. Splitting aces is so favorable to the player that most gambling establishments have rules limiting the player's rights to do so. In most casinos the player is only allowed to draw one card on each split ace. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>rule,</b> a ten on a split ace (or vice versa) is not considered a natural blackjack and does not get any bonus. Prohibiting resplitting and redoubling is also common. Regardless of the payout for blackjack, the rules for resplitting, the rules for doubling, the rules for multiple card draws and the dealer's cards, one should always split aces.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of species, such as ducks and geese, lose all of their flight {{feathers}} at once, temporarily becoming flightless. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>rule,</b> the tail feathers are moulted and replaced starting with the innermost pair. Centripetal moults of tail feathers are however seen in the Phasianidae. The centrifugal moult is modified in the tail feathers of woodpeckers and treecreepers, in that it begins with the second innermost pair of feathers and finishes with the central pair of feathers so that the bird maintains a functional climbing tail. The general pattern seen in passerines is that the primaries are replaced outward, secondaries inward, and the tail from centre outward. Before nesting, the females of most bird species gain a bare brood patch by losing feathers close to the belly. The skin there is well supplied with blood vessels and helps the bird in incubation.|$|E
5|$|Because males emerge {{earlier than}} females, the males compete for mating territories {{surrounding}} the nests {{in which the}} females are located. During a fight, the males risk damaging their wings or appendages by butting and grappling. Another defense technique is to grab another male and carry it high into the air, which {{is thought to be}} a demonstration of strength. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>rule,</b> the larger the male the more predominant he is in battles. Age influences the success in the defense and security of territory; the younger the wasp the greater the chance of a successful takeover of territory. Some small males even engage in non-territorial mating tactics, and delay their emergence so as to have a fairer chance of survival.|$|E
5000|$|Laws known <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>General</b> Anti-Avoidance <b>Rule</b> (GAAR) {{statutes}} which prohibit [...] "tax aggressive" [...] avoidance {{have been}} passed in several developed countries including Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Norway, Hong Kong and the United Kingdom. In addition, judicial doctrines have accomplished the similar purpose, notably in the United States through the [...] "business purpose" [...] and [...] "economic substance" [...] doctrines established in Gregory v. Helvering and in the UK through the Ramsay case. Though the specifics may vary according to jurisdiction, these rules invalidate tax avoidance which is technically legal but not for a business purpose or {{in violation of the}} spirit of the tax code. Related terms for tax avoidance include tax planning and tax sheltering.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States {{the use of}} {{the term}} 'noncompliance' often refers only to illegal misreporting.

50|$|Selfless Service or Seva means devoting {{oneself to}} mental, physical, or {{financial}} {{service to the}} Guru, and the sangat (or devotees). Mental service means keeping constant remembrance of God by means of repetition of the Mantra (known as Simran) or by other means keeping the Guru in mind. Physical service means doing some physical work, as in the situation where one helps dig a well at an ashram or gives a talk about the Master to the public. Financial service means giving money to {{the mission of the}} Master (to his organization) instead of spending it on oneself. The concept of Financial Seva is quite similar to tithing as known generally in Christianity. Also, just <b>as</b> <b>a</b> very <b>general</b> <b>rule,</b> at least 10% of one's time should be spent in meditation.|$|R
5|$|Twenty-nine radioisotopes {{have also}} been synthesized, ranging in atomic mass from 138 to 173. The most stable of these is 154Dy, with a {{half-life}} of approximately 3years, followed by 159Dy with a half-life of 144.4days. The least stable is 138Dy, with a half-life of 200ms. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>rule,</b> isotopes that are lighter than the stable isotopes tend to decay primarily by β+ decay, while those that are heavier tend to decay by β− decay. However, 154Dy decays primarily by alpha decay, and 152Dy and 159Dy decay primarily by electron capture. Dysprosium also has at least 11 metastable isomers, ranging in atomic mass from 140 to 165. The most stable of these is 165mDy, which has a half-life of 1.257minutes. 149Dy has two metastable isomers, the second of which, 149m2Dy, has a half-life of 28ns.|$|E

40|$|Some grammars accept two {{equivalent}} {{forms in}} the case of the imperative singular of Portuguese verbs ending in -zer/-zir, one with a thematic vowel, e. g. faze, and an apocopated form, faz, while in modern spoken Portuguese only the latter is used. According to some remarks in historical grammars, we can interpret the evolution of the standard form <b>as</b> <b>a</b> process of cyclic change: FACE > faz >> faze >> faz. In this article, after describing the apocope of the final -e <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> phonetic <b>rule,</b> and more specifically in Portuguese verb conjugation, we examine imperative singular forms of verbs ending in -zer/-zir in texts dating from different periods. Some observations are made on the formal relationship between the third person singular of present indicative and imperative singular, showing two tendencies: one of system congruency and one of iconicity...|$|R
5000|$|Once the {{proposed}} evidence {{is identified as}} hearsay, it is presumptively inadmissible. I stress {{the nature of the}} hearsay <b>rule</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> exclusionary <b>rule</b> because the increased flexibility introduced in the Canadian law of evidence {{in the past few decades}} has sometimes tended to blur the distinction between admissibility and weight. Modifications have been made to a number of rules, including the rule against hearsay, to bring them up to date and to ensure that they facilitate rather than impede the goals of truth seeking, judicial efficiency and fairness in the adversarial process. However, the traditional rules of evidence reflect considerable wisdom and judicial experience. The modern approach has built upon their underlying rationale, not discarded it. In Starr itself, where this Court recognized the primacy of the principled approach to hearsay exceptions, the presumptive exclusion of hearsay evidence was reaffirmed in strong terms.
