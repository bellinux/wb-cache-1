500|$|I {{remarked to}} Gibson as we rode along {{that this was}} the anniversary of Burke's and Wills's return to their depot at Coopers' Creek and then recited to him, as he did not appear to know {{anything}} whatever about it, the hardships they endured, their desperate struggles for existence and death there; and casually remarked that Mr Wills had a brother [...] who also lost his life in the field of discovery, as he went out with Sir John Franklin in 1845. Gibson then remarked, [...] "Oh, I had a brother who died with Franklin at the North Pole <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> a great deal of trouble getting his pay from Government".|$|E
60|$|This puzzled me yet more; and {{a thought}} coming into my head, I {{asked if he}} <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> been twins.|$|E
60|$|A look of pain crossed Mr. Banker's face. He <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> been warm friends, and I well {{knew that}} he would do all in his power for me.|$|E
6000|$|... "This," [...] {{answered}} the major, laying before his sisters two small packages, each {{marked with the}} name of its proper owner. [...] "My mother <b>has</b> her's, too, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> not been forgotten." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] said Alton simply. [...] "What {{would any}} son do? But {{it seems to}} me there might be a little {{allowance}} for <b>my</b> grandfather, too, <b>and</b> I think he <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>have</b> fixed up that quarrel long ago." ...|$|R
60|$|This being finally settled, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>having</b> {{been pretty}} well {{exhausted}} by his ramble round the farm, I set {{him down on}} the rustic chair with a newspaper and left him, saying that I should be back in an hour or so.|$|R
6000|$|The autumn was now over; the winter--a cold, gloomy winter--had fairly come. Five {{months had}} nearly elapsed since Clara <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> {{departed}} for the country. What communication did I hold with them, during that interval? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Your {{youth is}} a drawback," [...] said Laura thoughtfully. [...] "You will inherit a large fortune, but I am poor, and if I married you, your {{trustees}} would imagine I, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> <b>had</b> planned to capture you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And lost {{half of his}} estate,' {{answered}} Foxley, {{with more}} rapidity than usual; 'and was very near--hem--being hanged into the boot. But this is--another guess job--for--eh--Fifteen is not Forty-five; <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> a remission, and you, I take it, have none.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We of Thuria {{had heard}} of a great {{chieftain}} who has bound together many tribes, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> sent me to Dacor to learn if there be truth in these stories, and if so to offer the services of Thuria to him whom we have heard called emperor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{no reason}} to fear wrong from Highlanders," [...] said Catharine, firmly; [...] "especially as I thought Conachar was with them. Conachar has drunk of our cup and eaten of our bread; <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> often had traffic with Highlanders, and never was there wrong or quarrel betwixt him and them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not?" [...] {{said the}} other. [...] "I am {{offering}} you <b>my</b> services, <b>and</b> {{anything that is}} worth having is worth paying for. I suppose we could both smoke pipes under pleasanter conditions. What have you got against me? It isn't my fault that you <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>have</b> quarrelled." ...|$|R
60|$|Arrangements {{had been}} made to drive them to Wigtown, whence they were to proceed to Glasgow by the evening train, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> given orders that each should be served with a packet of {{sandwiches}} and hard-boiled eggs to sustain him on the way.|$|E
60|$|I suppose I {{had better}} tell {{what we had}} been doing all this time. Adela and I had come out, and had a season or two in London, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> enjoyed our {{pleasure}} in it, and paid {{a good deal of}} court to our pretty Adela, because there was no driving Torwood into anything warmer than easy brotherly companionship.|$|E
60|$|It was, as he said, no use {{looking at}} it, and {{in five minutes}} half our catch {{of the day was}} overboard. The Jane was a {{half-decked}} boat, yawl-rigged; she wasn't built in our parts, but had been brought round from somewhere east by a gentleman as a fishing-craft. He had used her for two years, and had got tired of the sport, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> bought her of him. She wasn't the sort of boat generally used about here, but we all liked her, and swore by her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'And I {{looked upon}} {{the pile of}} Yash-Noosh and laughed, for I was head man in Akatan, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> wealth was greater than the wealth of all <b>my</b> young men, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>fathers</b> <b>had</b> done deeds, <b>and</b> given laws, and put their names for all time in the mouths of the people.|$|R

60|$|For Mr. Stafford {{had grown}} {{impatient}} <b>and</b> weary, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>having</b> satisfied himself {{that there was}} something to be detected, would not remain to the end, and not only carried his companions off, but locked the doors, perhaps expecting to imprison some agent in a trick, and find him in the morning.|$|R
60|$|There {{had been}} a rising and a bloody battle at Perugia, Falcone {{informed}} us. An attempt {{had been made to}} overthrow the rule there of Pier Luigi Farnese, Duke of Castro, the pope's own abominable son. For some months my father had been enjoying the shelter of the Perugians, and he had repaid their hospitality by joining them and bearing arms with them in the ill-starred blow they struck for liberty. They had been crushed in the encounter by the troops of Pier Luigi, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> been among the slain.|$|E
60|$|I am {{by birth}} a Genevese, {{and my family}} {{is one of the}} most {{distinguished}} of that republic. My ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> filled several public situations with honour and reputation. He was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business. He passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country; a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early, nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family.|$|E
60|$|I {{had never}} met Mr. Stanton up to that time, though we had held {{frequent}} conversations over the wires the year before, when I was in Tennessee. Occasionally at night he would order the wires between the War Department and my headquarters to be connected, and we would hold a conversation {{for an hour or}} two. On this occasion the Secretary was accompanied by Governor Brough of Ohio, whom I {{had never met}}, though he <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> been old acquaintances. Mr. Stanton dismissed the special train that had brought him to Indianapolis, and accompanied me to Louisville.|$|E

"Well, Mr. Mortimer <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>have</b> taken a house {{together}} in the country, {{and for some reason}} or other they have quarrelled, and now Mr. Mortimer is doing everything he can to make father uncomfortable. Yesterday afternoon father wanted to sleep, and Mr. Mortimer started his orchestrion just to annoy him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have said}} it is not {{possible}} that this good man, who have come to the house and ride on his back the children, is a thief and a brigand. <b>And</b> one night <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>have</b> come from the Monterey in the coach, and it was stopped. And the brigands have take from the passengers the money, the rings from the finger, <b>and</b> the watch--and <b>my</b> <b>father</b> was of the same. <b>And</b> <b>my</b> <b>father,</b> he <b>have</b> great dissatisfaction and anguish, for his watch is given to him of an old friend, and it is not like the other watch. But the watch he go all the same. And then when the robbers have made a finish comes to the window of the coach a mascara and have say, 'Who is the Don Andreas Pico?' <b>And</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>have</b> say, 'It is I who am Don Andreas Pico.' And the mask have say, 'Behold, your watch is restore!' and he gif it to him. <b>And</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> say, 'To whom have I the distinguished honor to thank?' And the mask say--" ...|$|R

'I <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>fathers</b> <b>have</b> watered our flocks in the {{wilderness}} since time was,' replied Amalek; 'we have seen the Pharaohs, and Nebuchadnezzar, and Iskander, and the Romans, and the Sultan of the French: they conquered everything except us; and where are they? They are sand. Let men doubt of unicorns: but of one thing {{there can be no}} doubt, that God never spoke except to an Arab.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will repeat}} {{what she said}} to me, my dear, as {{faithfully}} as I can. After speaking of her father's death, {{she told me that}} she had only two relatives living. 'I have a married aunt in Glasgow, and a married aunt in London,' she said. 'When I left Edinburgh, I went to my aunt in London. She <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> not been on good terms together; she considered that my father had neglected her. But his death had softened her toward him and toward me. She received me kindly, and she got me a situation in a shop. I kept my situation for three months, and then I was obliged to leave it.'" ...|$|E
60|$|My {{father was}} {{what is called}} a man of ideas, but they were not always good ideas. My {{grandfather}} had been a private schoolmaster and {{one of the founders of}} the College of Preceptors, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> assisted him in his school until increasing competition and diminishing attendance had made it evident that the days of small private schools kept by unqualified persons were numbered. Thereupon my father had roused himself and had qualified as a science teacher under the Science and Art Department, which in these days had charge of the scientific and artistic education of the mass of the English population, and had thrown himself into science teaching and the earning of government grants therefor with great if transitory zeal and success.|$|E
6000|$|When the {{procession}} had quite departed and I {{could no longer}} {{hear the sound of}} singing, I remounted and rode on to my house, or rather to that of my mother, the great lady Tiu, which was situated beneath the wall of the old palace facing towards the Nile. Indeed my heart was full of this mother of mine whom I loved and who loved me, for I was her only child, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> been long dead; so long that I could not remember him. Eight months had gone by since I saw her face and in eight months who knew what might have happened? The thought made me cold for she, who was aged and not too strong, perhaps had been gathered to Osiris. Oh! if that were so! ...|$|E
2500|$|This miracle is {{not found}} in the Bible, but it is found in the non-canonical Syriac Infancy Gospel. [...] "He has said that Jesus spoke, and, indeed, when he was lying in his cradle, said to Mary, his mother: [...] "I am Jesus, the Son of God, the Logos, whom thou hast brought forth, as the Angel Gabriel {{announced}} to thee; <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>Father</b> <b>has</b> sent me for the salvation of the world." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'Don't, pray don't, Aunt Kitty,' cried Louis, rearing {{himself for}} an instant to look her in the face, but again {{throwing}} half his body over the rail, and speaking low. 'I could not meet any one half so good, or whom I know as well. I look up to her, and--yes--I do love her heartily--I {{would not have done}} it otherwise.

See, John, I have put the lint I scraped between two layers of the linen; for though the bark is certainly best for the flesh, yet the lint will serve to keep the cold air from the wound. If any lint will do it good, it is this lint; I scraped it myself, and I will not turn my back at scraping lint to any man on the Patent. I ought to know how, if anybody ought, for my grandfather was a doctor, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> a natural turn that way.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here is {{a cup of}} wine, Henry, older by half than I am myself; {{my father}} had it in a gift from stout old Crabbe, the Flemish engineer, who defended Perth so stoutly in the {{minority}} of David the Second. We glovers could always do something in war, though our connexion with {{it was less than}} yours who work in steel and iron. <b>And</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> pleased old Crabbe, some other day I will tell you how, and also how long these bottles were concealed under ground, to save them from the reiving Southron. So I will empty a cup to the soul's health of my honoured father--May his sins be forgiven him! Dorothy, thou shalt drink this pledge, and then be gone to thy cock loft. I know thine ears are itching, girl, but I have that to say which no one must hear save Henry Smith, the son of mine adoption." ...|$|E
6000|$|When I was {{nineteen}} {{years of age}} my father had the misfortune to die. He had always had perfect health, and his death, which occurred {{at the dinner table}} without a moment's warning, surprised no one more than himself. He had that very morning been notified that a patent had been granted him for a device to burst open safes by hydraulic pressure, without noise. The Commissioner of Patents had pronounced it the most ingenious, effective and generally meritorious invention that had ever been submitted to him, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>had</b> naturally looked forward to an old age of prosperity and honor. His sudden death was, therefore, a deep disappointment to him; but my mother, whose piety and resignation to the will of Heaven were conspicuous virtues of her character, was apparently less affected. At the close of the meal, when my poor father's body had been removed from the floor, she called us all into an adjoining room and addressed us as follows: ...|$|E

[...] "We want no change, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> said, talking it {{over with}} me again and again, he has two sons and loves us both equally, {{and it would be}} a deep grief to him now to know for certain that one of us is not his son. I will walk across to the {{hospital}} and ask how the sergeant is going on. I am strangely placed towards him now." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{weight was}} lifted, but by-and-by, {{when the two}} girls said their prayers together, poor Dolores broke forth again, 'Oh, Mysie, Mysie, your papa has all--all of you, besides mamma, to pray {{that he may be}} kept safe, <b>and</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> only me, only horrid me, to pray for him, and even I have never cared to do it really till just lately! Oh, poor, poor father! And suppose he should be drowned, and never, never have forgiven me!' ...|$|R

I {{live in the}} mountains, where dresses {{catch in}} the crags, and bother a girl. <b>And</b> <b>my</b> <b>father</b> <b>has</b> always been heart-broken {{because he had no}} son, and likes to see me in this attire. He has many errands for me, too, where a boy may go unnoticed, yet a girl would attract too much attention. This is one of the errands, signorini.
