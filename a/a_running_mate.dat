5|$|McKinley's {{original}} vice president, Garret Hobart, {{had died}} in 1899, and McKinley left the choice of <b>a</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate</b> to the 1900 Republican National Convention. In advance of the convention, New York's Republican political boss, Senator Thomas C. Platt, saw an opportunity to politically sideline his state's governor, former Assistant Secretary of the Navy Theodore Roosevelt, by pushing for his nomination as vice president. Roosevelt accepted the nomination and was elected on McKinley's ticket.|$|E
5|$|At the convention, held August 5–8, Agnew {{abandoned}} his favorite son status, placing Nixon's name in nomination. Nixon narrowly secured the nomination {{on the first}} ballot. In the discussions that followed about <b>a</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate,</b> Nixon kept his counsel while various party factions thought they could influence his choice: Strom Thurmond, the senator from South Carolina, told a party meeting that he held a veto on the vice presidency. It was evident that Nixon wanted a centrist, though there was little enthusiasm when he first proposed Agnew, and other possibilities were discussed. Some party insiders thought that Nixon had privately settled on Agnew early on, and that the consideration of other candidates {{was little more than}} a charade. On August 8, after a final meeting of advisers and party leaders, Nixon declared that Agnew was his choice, and shortly afterwards announced his decision to the press. Delegates formally nominated Agnew for the vice presidency later that day, before adjourning.|$|E
25|$|Coming {{from the}} pivotal and swing Midwestern state of Iowa, Harkin has figured {{in the running}} mate {{searches}} multiple times since his 1992 race. Clinton considered Harkin in 1992 because of his ties to labor and strong support {{after he left the}} presidential race. In 2000, Harkin was considered <b>a</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate</b> by then-Vice President Al Gore. However, Harkin's age was one reason he was not considered as strongly this time. In 2004, as Senator John Kerry (D-Massachusetts) looked at Harkin as <b>a</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate</b> among other Senate colleagues, though Harkin promoted his protege, then-Governor Tom Vilsack (D-Iowa).|$|E
50|$|Despite {{being his}} <b>running</b> <b>mate</b> in 1960, Henry Cabot Lodge Jr was not {{considered}} as <b>a</b> potential <b>running</b> <b>mate</b> for Nixon in 1968.|$|R

5000|$|This article lists <b>running</b> <b>mates</b> {{considered}} by Ross Perot during his 1992 independent candidacy for President of the United States. On March 30, 1992, Perot announced that retired Admiral James Stockdale {{would serve as}} his [...] "interim" [...] <b>running</b> <b>mate,</b> so that Perot could qualify for the ballot in several states. At the time, Perot planned to pick <b>a</b> permanent <b>running</b> <b>mate</b> during the summer, {{around the time of}} the 1992 Democratic National Convention and the 1992 Republican National Convention. Perot suspended his campaign during the summer of 1992, possibly preventing him from choosing <b>a</b> different <b>running</b> <b>mate.</b> After he decided to run again, Perot decided to keep Stockdale as his <b>running</b> <b>mate.</b> John Silber, the president of Boston University, was also rumored as <b>a</b> potential <b>running</b> <b>mate</b> for Perot. Stockdale appeared at the 1992 vice presidential debate. The Perot-Stockdale ticket took 18.9% of the popular vote, but the Clinton-Gore ticket won the election.|$|R
25|$|Kaine {{supports}} the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, which expands {{the cases in}} which worker can sue against gender pay discrimination. Following his selection by Clinton as <b>a</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate</b> in 2016, Kaine was praised by the National Organization for Women.|$|E
25|$|McCain began {{a search}} for <b>a</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate</b> to join the Republican ticket after {{clinching}} the Republican nomination. Former candidates Mitt Romney and Mike Huckabee were mentioned as possibilities, as were many other leaders in the Republican Party and the business world. Over Memorial Day weekend, McCain invited Romney, Florida Governor Charlie Crist, and Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal to his Sedona, Arizona ranch for informal get-togethers intended to assess personal chemistry for possible running mate selection.|$|E
25|$|The PDI–P {{selected}} {{former president}} Megawati as its presidential candidate on 7 May {{but did not}} immediately announce <b>a</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate.</b> The possibility of Gerindra leader Prabowo Subianto becoming Megawati's running mate had been favored by PDI–P leadership, but the two parties had yet {{to come to an}} agreement two days before the 16 May candidate registration deadline. After plans to announce the pair's candidacy were postponed to allow for continuing negotiations, both parties eventually declared on 15 May the nomination of Megawati and Prabowo as candidates for president and vice president.|$|E

25|$|In some states, Evan McMullin's <b>running</b> <b>mate</b> {{was listed}} as Nathan Johnson on the ballot rather than Mindy Finn, {{although}} Nathan Johnson was intended to only be a placeholder until <b>an</b> actual <b>running</b> <b>mate</b> was chosen.|$|R
50|$|An {{attempt to}} re-unite {{the party was}} made on the {{occasion}} of the 2007 legislative elections in France, in which both New Caledonian constituencies were up for election. In New Caledonia's 1st constituency, Charles Washetine, a member of UNI-Palika ran with <b>a</b> Caledonian Union <b>running</b> <b>mate.</b> In New Caledonia's 2nd constituency, the leader of the Caledonian Union, Charles Pidjot, ran with <b>a</b> UNI-Palika <b>running</b> <b>mate.</b> However, both were defeated by the candidates of The Rally-UMP.|$|R
25|$|Facing only token UCR and Socialist Party {{opposition}} and despite {{being unable to}} field his popular wife, Eva, as <b>a</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate,</b> Perón was re-elected in 1951 {{by a margin of}} over 30%. This election was the first to have extended suffrage to Argentine women and the first in Argentina to be televised: Perón was inaugurated on Channel 7 public television that October. He began his second term in June 1952 with serious economic problems, however, compounded by a severe drought that helped lead to a US$500million trade deficit (depleting reserves).|$|E
25|$|In July 2008, several U.S. {{mainstream}} media news outlets cited the allegations {{in relation to}} Edwards' future political career, {{as well as in}} relation to his chances of being selected as <b>a</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate</b> in Barack Obama's 2008 presidential bid. Then, on August 7, 2008, Edwards admitted to ABC News correspondent, Bob Woodruff, that he did have an extended affair with Hunter, but denied that he was the father of Hunter's baby girl. Hunter's sister claimed that Edwards was the father and publicly asked Edwards to take a paternity test to determine whether the child was his.|$|E
25|$|Bush asked former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney {{to head up}} a team to help select <b>a</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate</b> for him, but ultimately, Bush {{decided that}} Cheney himself should be the vice presidential nominee. While the U.S. Constitution does not {{specifically}} disallow a president and a vice president from the same state, it does prohibit electors from casting both {{of his or her}} votes for persons from his or her own state. Accordingly, Cheney—who had been a resident of Texas for nearly 10 years—changed his voting registration back to Wyoming. Had Cheney not done this, either he or Bush would have forfeited their electoral votes from the Texas electors.|$|E

50|$|During the 2016 presidential election, Perez was {{mentioned}} as <b>a</b> possible <b>running</b> <b>mate</b> on the Democratic ticket with Hillary Clinton, but was ultimately not selected. Perez later campaigned for the Clinton-Kaine ticket.|$|R
25|$|Trump {{turned his}} {{attention}} towards selecting <b>a</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate</b> after he became the presumptive nominee on May 4, 2016. In mid-June, Eli Stokols and Burgess Everett of Politico reported that the Trump campaign was considering New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich from Georgia, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, and Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin. A June 30 report from The Washington Post also included Senators Bob Corker from Tennessee, Richard Burr from North Carolina, Tom Cotton from Arkansas, Joni Ernst from Iowa, and Indiana Governor Mike Pence as individuals still being considered for the ticket. Trump also stated that he was considering two military generals for the position, including retired Lieutenant General Michael Flynn.|$|E
25|$|In modern elections, <b>a</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate</b> {{is often}} {{selected}} {{in order to}} appeal to a different set of voters. A Habitation Clause issue arose during the 2000 presidential election contested by George W. Bush (running-mate Dick Cheney) and Al Gore (running-mate Joe Lieberman), because it was alleged that Bush and Cheney were both inhabitants of Texas and that the Texas electors therefore violated the Twelfth Amendment in casting their ballots for both. Bush's residency was unquestioned, as he was Governor of Texas at the time. Cheney and his wife had moved to Dallas five years earlier when he assumed the role of chief executive at Halliburton. Cheney grew up in Wyoming and had represented it in Congress. A few months before the election, he switched his voter registration and driver's license to Wyoming and put his home in Dallas up for sale. Three Texas voters challenged the election in a federal court in Dallas and then appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, where it was dismissed.|$|E
25|$|In February 1842, {{with the}} United States facing a looming budget crisis, Clay {{proposed}} a detailed economic plan that combined budget cuts {{with an increased}} tariff. Clay then resigned, orchestrating the selection of Crittenden as his successor, and began to prepare for another presidential campaign. Clay remained {{in close contact with}} Congress and Congressional Whigs managed to pass many of Clay's proposals, but Tyler again vetoed them. Ultimately Tyler and the Whig Congress would compromise on the Tariff of 1842. Though Clay was distressed over the disagreements with Tyler, Tyler's apostasy, combined with Webster's continuing affiliation with Tyler, positioned Clay as the natural Whig candidate for the 1844 presidential election. Supporters of Webster (who resigned from Tyler's Cabinet in 1843), Scott, and Supreme Court Justice John McLean called for another Whig national convention, and Clay assented, partly because it would relieve him of the delicate task of selecting <b>a</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate.</b> Clay quietly favored New York Congressman Millard Fillmore for the position, and {{made it clear that he}} did not want Webster as his running mate, as Clay was angered by Webster's association with Tyler.|$|E

500|$|Twenty-five states {{required}} that {{a presidential candidate}} have <b>a</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate</b> {{to appear on the}} ballot. As a result, Perot named retired Vice Admiral James B. Stockdale, who had been awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during years of captivity as a POW during the Vietnam War, as his [...] "interim" [...] running mate in late March. Stockdale would remain in the position throughout the campaign. A Boston Globe report suggested that Boston University President John Silber was also considered as <b>a</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate.</b> During an Associated Press interview in April, Perot commented that he might begin a campaign before his supporters achieved ballot access in all states. In New York, ballot access appeared to be the most difficult to attain. In a five-week summer period, the campaign would be required to compile 20,000 signatures from non-primary voters, including 100 from each of half of the state's Congressional districts. Perot conceded that he might not appear on the state's ballot, but stated that he may run anyway.|$|E
500|$|While in the Senate, he {{chaired the}} Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee from 2003–2005. In this role he was {{influential}} in convincing certain potential candidates to not run {{in order to}} avoid costly primaries in three key states during the 2004 United States Senate elections. [...] He also {{played a role in the}} selection of Senator John Edwards as <b>a</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate</b> for Senator John Kerry. In 2002, Corzine called for the resignation of United States Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey Pitt.|$|E
500|$|Clinton's {{choice was}} criticized as {{unconventional}} because rather than picking <b>a</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate</b> who would diversify the ticket, Clinton chose a fellow Southerner who shared his political ideologies {{and who was}} nearly {{the same age as}} Clinton. The Washington Bureau Chief for The Baltimore Sun, Paul West, later suggested that, [...] "Al Gore revolutionized the way Vice Presidents are made. When he joined Bill Clinton's ticket, it violated the old rules. Regional diversity? Not with two Southerners from neighboring states. Ideological balance? A couple of left-of-center moderates. [...] And yet, Gore has come to be regarded by strategists in both parties as the best vice presidential pick in at least 20 years." ...|$|E
50|$|Benigno Fitial and Rita Inos lost to Republican Juan N. Babauta in the 2001 general {{election}}. Fitial {{would later}} be elected Governor in the 2005 general election with <b>a</b> different <b>running</b> <b>mate,</b> Timothy P. Villagomez.|$|R
50|$|In 1991, Kassebaum was {{mentioned}} by Time magazine as <b>a</b> possible <b>running</b> <b>mate</b> for President George H.W. Bush if Vice President Dan Quayle {{was not the}} Republican vice-presidential candidate in the 1992 U.S. presidential election.|$|R
5000|$|In 1986, Pfeiffer was {{mentioned}} as <b>a</b> potential <b>running</b> <b>mate</b> to Richard Celeste. [...] However, the spot ultimately went to Paul Leonard. Pfeiffer subsequently won reelection to the Senate, and again won reelection in 1990.|$|R
500|$|Despite Jackson's support, {{the party}} was far from united behind Johnson. Van Buren {{preferred}} Rives as <b>a</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate.</b> In a letter to Jackson, Tennessee Supreme Court justice John Catron doubted that [...] "a lucky random shot, {{even if it did}} hit Tecumseh, qualifies a man for the vice presidency". Although Johnson was a [...] "widower", after Chinn's death in 1833, there was still dissension related to Johnson's open relationship with a slave. The 1835 Democratic National Convention, in Baltimore, in May 1835, was held under the two-thirds rule, largely to demonstrate Van Buren's wide popularity. Although Van Buren was nominated unanimously, Johnson barely obtained the necessary two thirds of the vote. (A motion was made to change the rule, but it obtained only a bare majority, not two thirds.) ...|$|E
500|$|Goldwater won the California primary on June 2 with 51% of the vote, {{gaining the}} state's 86 delegates, {{and all but}} {{securing}} the nomination. Immediately thereafter, he began a search for <b>a</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate,</b> narrowing the field to four easterners: William Scranton, Senator Thurston B. Morton of Kentucky, Congressman William E. Miller of New York, and Ohio Governor James A. Rhodes. United Press International reported that an authoritative source informed them that former President Eisenhower asked Scranton to be [...] "more available" [...] for the presidential nomination. However, he disavowed the [...] "Stop Goldwater movement" [...] and later advised Scranton to not get involved [...] "in a cabal against anyone." [...] Moderate Republican governors felt the development effectively ended the anti-Goldwater movement, and thus secured his nomination. They then worked to convince Goldwater to soften his political stances.|$|E
500|$|In 1836, Johnson was the Democratic {{nominee for}} {{vice-president}} on a ticket with Martin Van Buren. Campaigning with the slogan [...] "Rumpsey Dumpsey, Rumpsey Dumpsey, Colonel Johnson killed Tecumseh", Johnson fell one {{short of the}} electoral votes needed to secure his election. Virginia's delegation to the Electoral College refused to endorse Johnson, abstaining instead. However, {{he was elected to}} the office by the Senate. Johnson proved such a liability for the Democrats in the 1836 election that they refused to renominate him for vice-president in 1840. President Van Buren campaigned for re-election without <b>a</b> <b>running</b> <b>mate.</b> He lost to William Henry Harrison, a Whig. Johnson tried to return to public office but was defeated. He finally was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1850, but he died on November 19, 1850, just two weeks into his term.|$|E
