5|$|At the bridge, Frost's forces {{continued}} to hold but without supply or reinforcement their position was becoming weaker. The Germans—realising that infantry attacks were unlikely to remove the stubborn defenders—began to systematically destroy the houses the British were in using tanks, artillery and mortars.

5|$|During closing arguments, {{defense counsel}} John Pope {{attempted}} to discredit Darby; the latter reacted by assaulting one of Pope's co-counselors with a cane. The trial lasted thirteen days, {{and despite the}} <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> physical evidence, including a murder weapon, the jury returned a guilty verdict after only an hour of deliberation on May 19. Beauchamp was sentenced to be executed by hanging on June 16, 1826.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people with}} SCI have {{problems}} with the body's physical sexual arousal response. Problems that result directly from impaired neural transmission are called primary sexual dysfunction. The function of the genitals is almost always affected by SCI, by alteration, reduction, or complete loss of sensation. Neuropathic pain, in which damaged nerve pathways signal pain in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> noxious stimulus, is common after SCI and interferes with sex.|$|E

5|$|The {{cemetery}} grounds are, {{except in}} drier climates, grass {{covered with a}} floral border around the headstones. There is also an <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> paving between the headstone rows which is intended to make the cemetery feel like a traditional walled garden where visitors could experience a sense of peace. However, Carter and Jackson argue that the uniform aesthetics are designed to evoke a positive experience which deliberately masks and sanitises {{the nature of the}} war deaths.|$|E
5|$|There is some dispute as to if this pyramid was Ahmose's burial place, {{or if it}} was a cenotaph. Although earlier explorers Mace and Currelly {{were unable}} to locate any {{internal}} chambers, it is unlikely that a burial chamber would have been located {{in the midst of the}} pyramid's rubble core. In the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> mention of a tomb of King Ahmose in the tomb robbery accounts of the Abbott Papyrus, and in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> likely candidate for the king's tomb at Thebes, it is possible that the king was interred at Abydos, as suggested by Harvey. Certainly the great number of cult structures located at the base of the pyramid located in recent years, as well as the presence at the base of the pyramid of a cemetery used by priests of Ahmose's cult, argue for the importance of the king's Abydos cult. However, other Egyptologists believe that the pyramid was constructed (like Tetisheri's pyramid at Abydos) as a cenotaph and that Ahmose may have originally been buried in the southern part of Dra' Abu el-Naga' with the rest of the late 17th and early 18th Dynasties.|$|E

40|$|Terahertz {{radiation}} {{was measured}} from InN and compared to p-InAs excited by femtosecond optical pulses at 1060 and 800 nm. At 800 nm, atomically smooth InN with low background electron concentration exhibit higher THz emission than the highly effective material p-InAs. The higher THz emission efficiency of InN {{is caused by}} the <b>absences</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> intervalley scattering, which in the case of InAs increases the effective mass of the photo generated electrons and, thus, reduces the Dember field, which is responsible for THz emission. Consequently, InN is a promising material for THz emission; however, further improvement of the material quality (surface roughness and carrier concentration) is needed...|$|R
25|$|Immediately {{investigations}} {{were started}} by the French authorities in Quimper. Several explanations were advanced to explain the capsizing including a fishing accident, collision with a surface ship, rock or wreck, {{the presence of a}} sandbank, and an accident involving a submarine. In June 2004 the ship was raised for forensic examinations. The fish hold showed a compression due to the water pressure. In the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> evidence <b>of</b> <b>any</b> ramming, the hypothesis of a collision with a surface ship could be abandoned.|$|R

5|$|A {{report by}} an amateur radio {{operator}} {{who claimed to}} have received a faint SOS signal from Star Dust initially raised hopes that there might have been survivors, but all subsequent attempts over the years to find the vanished flight failed. In the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> hard evidence, numerous theories arose —including rumours of sabotage (compounded by the later disappearance of two other aircraft also belonging to British South American Airways); speculation that the flight might have been blown up to destroy diplomatic documents being carried by passenger Paul Simpson; or even the suggestion that Star Dust might have been taken or destroyed by a UFO (an idea fuelled by unresolved questions about the flight's final Morse code message).|$|E
5|$|After hatching, {{the larvae}} spend another 72 hours absorb their yolk sacs and {{developing}} their fins {{before they become}} free-swimming fry. The fry forage during daylight in a dense school {{and return to the}} cave or crevice for the night. Like other cichlids, the parents retrieve their young just before dark, sucking up three or four at a time and delivering them into the nest. The parents anticipate night, using a sense of time; in laboratory experiments convict cichlids continued to retrieve young as night approached even in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> signal, such as dimming light.

The rule is based upon the deceptively simple notion of first-in, first-out to determine the effect of payments from an account, and will normally apply in the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> evidence <b>of</b> <b>any</b> other intention.

50|$|The {{rock martin}} {{has a very}} large range of 9.5 million km2 (3.7 million sq mi). The total {{population}} is unknown, but the bird is described as generally common, although scarce in Botswana and Namibia. The population {{is thought to be}} stable, mainly due to the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> evidence <b>of</b> <b>any</b> declines or substantial threats. Its large range and presumably high numbers mean that the rock martin is not considered to be threatened, and it is classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.|$|R
5|$|Amanita regalis {{is easily}} {{distinguished}} from A.muscaria by the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> red {{color in the}} cap, and the yellow patches on the stem. If it is a form that has a pale-colored, yellowish-brown cap, Amanita regalis may {{be confused with the}} blusher (Amanita rubescens, edible). The latter species can be identified by the flesh-colored tinge it stains when cut or bruised, and also by the color of the flesh underneath the cuticle: A.regalis is yellowish while A.rubescens is white. Amanita pantherina has a similar color, but has white flesh below the cap cuticle, and a cup-shaped bulb with distinct margins around the edge.|$|E
5|$|And Yet It Moves {{received}} generally favorable reviews.

Critics applauded the game's unique {{take on the}} platforming genre and the game's paper collage visual style, but felt the game was too short. Some critics noted the <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>any</b> narrative or backstory, but felt that the game ultimately didn't need one, though GameSpot noted {{it as one of}} the game's weaknesses.|$|E
