Initially researchers postulated that the upward mobility of African American women had diminished their to marry, but studies found opposing evidence to that theory and so the focus switched to African <b>American</b> <b>men.</b> Early studies about African <b>American</b> <b>men</b> and marriage indicated that the sex-ratio imbalance, the educational disparity between African <b>American</b> <b>men</b> and women that leads to economic frailty was the major cause of the disparity in marriage (James et al 1999, Davis, Emerson, 2 ̆ 6 Williams, 1997, James, 1998, King 2 ̆ 6 Allen, 2009). While external factors and the way those external forces affect African <b>American</b> <b>men</b> 2 ̆ 7 s marriage behaviors have received attention in the literature, no attention has been given to the intrinsic psychological processes that affect how African <b>American</b> <b>men</b> conceptualize marriage.

A series of focus groups were conducting with African <b>American</b> <b>men</b> aged 24 - 34 years (N= 17). Participants were asked questions that inquired about how the men feel about marriage, how they learned about marriage, and what they learned about marriage. Guided by a phenomenological premise, axial coding data analysis revealed several themes including positive and ambivalent attitudes towards marriage, struggles of Black masculinity, dilemmas within the Black male-female dynamic, and role confusion; resulting in Gender Role Conflict as it relates to marriage.

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{examined}} how different dimensions {{of social capital}} (i. e., family and friend connections, neighborhood and family cohesion, family conflict) were associated with smoking behavior among a nationally representative sample of Asian <b>American</b> <b>men</b> and whether the associations varied by ethnic group. MethodsThe sample consisted of 998 adult Asian <b>American</b> <b>men</b> {{who participated in the}} National Latino and Asian American Survey from 2002 to 2003. We conducted weighted multivariate logistic regressions on data for the sample and for each of 4 ethnic subgroups (Chinese, Vietnamese, Filipino, and Other). ResultsVietnamese <b>American</b> <b>men</b> had the highest prevalence of current smoking; Chinese <b>American</b> <b>men,</b> the lowest. After controlling for sociodemographics, socioeconomic status, acculturation, and perceived discrimination, neighborhood cohesion was inversely associated with smoking among Asian <b>American</b> <b>men,</b> and family and friend connections and family cohesion were not. An exception was family cohesion, which was associated with increased odds of smoking among Filipino <b>American</b> <b>men.</b> ConclusionsThe relationship between social capital and smoking among Asian <b>American</b> <b>men</b> varied according to specific dimensions of social capital and was ethnicity specific. These findings highlight the need for smoking prevention and cessation interventions to take into consideration the heterogeneity that exists among Asian Americans.

By the turn of the millennium, Non-Hispanic whites, the largest ethnic group in the United States, were only half of the population in the Bay Area as immigration among minority groups accelerated. During this time, the Bay Area {{was the center of the}} LGBT rights movement: in 2004, San Francisco began issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples, a first in the United States, and four years later, a majority of voters in the Bay Area rejected California Proposition 8, which sought to constitutionally restrict marriage to opposite-sex couples but ultimately passed statewide. The Bay Area was also the center of contentious protests concerning racial and economic inequality. In 2009, an African <b>American</b> <b>man</b> named Oscar Grant was fatally shot by Bay Area Rapid Transit police officers, precipitating widespread protests across the region and even riots in Oakland, and whose name was symbolically tied to the Occupy Oakland protests two years later that sought to fight against social and economic inequality. Following the Inauguration of Donald Trump as President of the United States in 2017, the Bay Area became a center of resistance to his administration, beginning with widespread protests in concert with the nationwide Women's March a day later, followed by frequent public feuds between Trump and various Bay Area political, cultural, and business figures over issues of race and immigration, among others.|$|E

40|$|HIV {{continues}} to affect African American {{populations in the}} United States at disproportionate levels. Recent reports have described potentially high-risk behaviors of African <b>American</b> <b>men</b> who identify as heterosexual but who engage in secretive sex with other men. These men have {{been referred to as}} being "on the Down Low," and this terminology has been used to label subgroups of African <b>American</b> <b>men</b> and explain sexual risks for HIV infection in the African American community. In this paper, we argue that an uncritical use of this terminology for guiding public health and HIV prevention strategies can be problematic and counterproductive because it (a) stigmatizes and exoticizes secretive same-sex sexuality as a unique issue among African <b>American</b> <b>men,</b> and (b) ignores the social conditions under which HIV transmission occurs. We explore some historical roots contributing to current perspectives on African American men's sexuality, describe {{the use of the term}} "on the Down Low" and its application to same-sex behavior among African <b>American</b> <b>men,</b> and explain how this term can both clarify and potentially ambiguate efforts to address HIV risk among African <b>American</b> <b>men.</b> Recommendations for research and HIV prevention strategies are also provided.
