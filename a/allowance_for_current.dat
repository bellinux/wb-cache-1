40|$|The {{limits of}} modernity – the new {{cataloguing}} code "Resource Description and Access" (RDA) : "Resource Description and Access" (RDA), {{which is supposed}} to replace AACR 2, and the online tool "RDA Toolkit" are presented. Important principles of the new cataloguing code, such as the alignment with FRBR and the definition of core elements, are discussed. It is shown that RDA does not achieve all of its objectives as it makes too much <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> <b>current</b> American cataloguing practices...|$|E
40|$|The article {{points out}} basic {{differences}} between the Anglo-American and the German tradition of cataloguing {{with respect to the}} expenditure taken, the main entries and the data model. Then, basic principles of RDA are explained, such as compatibility with AACR 2, a rather superficial understanding of internationality, the alignment with FRBR, the role of data elements in RDA and the basic rules for bibliographic description. It is shown that RDA does not achieve all of its objectives as it makes too much <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> <b>current</b> Anglo-American cataloguing practices. Finally, the possible implementation of RDA in the German speaking countries is discussed...|$|E
40|$|This study summarises all the {{accessible}} data on old German {{chemical weapons}} {{dumped in the}} Baltic Sea. Mr. Goncharov formulated a concept of ecological impact evaluation of chemical warfare agents (CWA) on the marine environment and structured a simulation model adapted to the specific character of the hydrological condition and hydrobiological subjects of the Bornholm Deep. The mathematical model he has created describes the spreading of contaminants by currents and turbulence in the near bottom boundary layer. Parameters of CWA discharge through corrosion of canisters were given for various kinds of bottom sediments with <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> <b>current</b> velocity. He created a method for integral estimations and a computer simulation model and completed a forecast for CWA "Mustard", which showed that in normal hydrometeorological conditions there are local toxic plumes drifting along the bottom for a distance of up to several kilometres. With storm winds the toxic plumes from separate canisters interflow and lengthen and can reach fishery areas near Bornholm Island. When salt water from the North Sea flows in, the length of toxic zones can increase up to and over 100 kilometres and toxic water masses can spread into the northern Baltic. On this basis, Mr. Goncharov drew up recommendations to reduce dangers for human ecology and proposed {{the creation of a}} special system for the forecasting and remote sensing of the environmental conditions of CWA burial places...|$|E
50|$|Akutan Pass is {{recommended}} for steamers bound to or from Unalaska Bay, and for sailing vessels from Unalaska Bay, having a fair wind. From the southward it {{is recommended}} to make the land {{in the vicinity of}} Tigalda Island and Avatanak Island and follow along the south side of these islands until the course is shaped from Rootok Island to Cape Morgan. From Cape Morgan a west by south course, making <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the <b>current,</b> will carry clear of the ledge off Cape Kalekhta. From Unalaska Bay, after clearing Cape Kalekhta, Akutan Pass is open and an east by north course can be steered through.|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the lectures and workshops of the VI scientific educational course by the European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) dedicated to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which was held in Pisa, Italy, in early September 2013. The course aims were to train young practicing rheumatologists to make early diagnosis and provide timely and adequate treatment with <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the <b>current</b> concepts of SLE etiopathogenesis; the use of the EULAR recommendations and classification criteria; and analysis of complex clinical cases. The main issues of this course included lesion of the nervous system in SLE, lupus nephritis, therapy with traditional and biological response modifiers, management of pregnancy in SLE patients, the need for standardization of the methods for the diagnosis and treatment of these conditions.   </div...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} between {{body mass index}} (BMI) at different ages and subsequent endometrial-cancer risk was investigated in a multicentre case-control study conducted between 1988 and 1991 in Vaud, Switzerland, and Northern Italy on 272 histologically confirmed incident cases of endometrial cancer and 571 controls admitted to hospital for acute, non-neoplastic conditions, unrelated to known or potential risk factors for endometrial cancer. The risk of endometrial cancer increased with increasing BMI in the 3 rd decade of age (20 to 29 years), in the 5 th decade (40 to 49 years) and in the 7 th decade (60 to 69 years), although the risk estimates tended to be substantially higher at older ages: compared with women whose BMI (kg m- 2) was less than 20, the relative risks (RR) were 1. 8 for BMI {{greater than or equal}} to 25 at age 20 to 29, 2. 7 for BMI {{greater than or equal to}} 30 at age 40 to 49 and 3. 8 at age 60 to 69. All the trends in risk were significant, except that for BMI at age 25 after <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> <b>current</b> BMI. When data were examined in separate strata of current BMI, among women of normal body mass at diagnosis no significant effect of past overweight was observed. In contrast, among subjects over-weight at diagnosis, there were significant direct relationships with BMI at ages 20 to 29 and 40 to 49. To reduce endometrial cancer risk, it is therefore important to avoid obesity in later middle and older age, and the benefit can be even greater for women who were overweight at younger age...|$|E

25|$|Ordinary {{income is}} a net income concept, {{meaning that it}} will be {{deduction}} for costs incurred to acquire income. There is therefore a deduction for expenses related to acquisition of income if these are higher than the basic allowance. There is also several other deductions from ordinary income; special <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> disability, special tax <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> pensioners, the tax limitation rule for the disabled, seamen’s allowance, fishermen’s <b>allowance,</b> special <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> self-employed within agriculture, special <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> high expenses linked to illness, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> payments to individual pension schemes, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> travel between home and work, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> donations to voluntary organisations, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> paid union fees, <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> home investment savings scheme for people under 34 years, parental <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> documented expenses for childminding and childcare, etc.|$|R

30|$|In {{the pilot}} ETSs in China, a {{majority}} of <b>allowances</b> are allocated <b>for</b> free, with a relatively small portion being auctioned in Shenzhen and Guangdong. Grandfathering is applied to allocate <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> cogeneration units in Guangdong, and benchmarking is adopted to allocate <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> coal-fired and gas-fired units in Shanghai. As China has a steadily growing economy, a benchmarking method based on actual output (rather than historical output) is planned to allocate <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> generation companies in the national level ETS, in order to balance emission reduction and economic growth.|$|R

30|$|Third, auctions {{should be}} {{introduced}} into the <b>allowance</b> allocation <b>for</b> takers. In China, Guangdong is the first and currently the only pilot province to introduce auctions into the allowance allocation. After the first pilot year (July 2013 –July 2014), the compliance rate of enterprises and the allowance on CO 2 emissions reduction achieved 98.90 and 99.97  %, respectively. In the Guangdong industrial sectors, the enterprises must acquire a 3  % allowance through auction, and they can then activate a 97  % <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> free; for large public buildings, 100  % are allocated for free by benchmarking before the compliance period. At present, the government-allocated <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the enterprises is free in Beijing. However, the CET will eventually be completely adjusted by the market, {{as is the case}} for CET in the EU (European Union). Specifically, a certain level of auction, such as 3  %, can be introduced to the <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the takers; and a lesser amount for auction, which should be smaller than the proportion of auction in the <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the takers, can be introduced to the <b>allowance</b> <b>for</b> the givers; alternatively, 100  % can be free <b>for</b> the <b>allowance</b> of the givers.|$|R

5000|$|Emissions allocation: Under the Clear Skies Act, {{emission}} allowances are to {{be allocated}} based on historical fuel consumption, what {{is often referred to}} as [...] "grandfathering". Under the Clean Air Planning Act, a grandfathering approach is used to allocate emission <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> SO2, but <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> NOx, mercury, and CO2, are allocated using an output-based scheme. Under this approach, referred to as a generation performance standard (GPS), generators are given <b>allowances</b> <b>for</b> each unit of electricity they generate. The number of <b>allowances</b> allocated <b>for</b> each unit of generation changes each year as the total generation from covered sources changes. The use of a GPS dampens the electricity price impacts of the bill but raises overall compliance costs.|$|R
