[...] It {{featured}} a larger cast of children, more original music, {{and a new}} set designed by renowned Mexican architect Ricardo Legorreta. [...] The season focused on a more innovative curriculum, developed by a board of Latin American educators and UNICEF, and included topics such as health, hygiene, safety issues, cooperation, counting, and the alphabet. [...] The producers created outreach materials for Hispanic families, {{for the purpose of}} promoting media literacy and helping parents improve their roles as their children's first teachers. [...] The fourth season aired in the U.S. because of the large population of Spanish-speakers in the country; {{it was the first time}} an original co-production was shown in the U.S. [...] As Gary Knell, an executive at the CTW stated, [...] "Our mission is to educate all kids. [...] <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> in the U.S., especially in cities like Los Angeles, there's an enormous number of Spanish-speaking households".|$|E
500|$|Jeff {{appeared}} at Kick Butts Day, a protest {{organized by the}} Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and youth advocates, which was held outside Philip Morris' annual shareholders' meeting in New York City on May 6, 2015. The protests featured a flash mob with fifty dancers performing a choreographed dance to a song with the lyrics, [...] "We don't want your cigarettes. Jeff we can!" [...] The performance ended with the mascot: [...] "rolling {{around on the floor}} in a coughing fit and loss of breath". Shana Narula, the campaign's coordinator, said: The whole concept is to use Jeff and the hashtag #JeffWeCan and #StopMarlboro to show that these marketing tactics are not allowed and tobacco is still the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the world. <b>And</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> it's the only consumer product that when used as intended, it kills its user. This is very, very unique — no other consumer product does this. Most people think that tobacco is not really an issue in this country anymore and that's completely not true. That's what we want to shed light on today, in a fashion where people will take notice.|$|E
