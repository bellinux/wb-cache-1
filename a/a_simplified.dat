5|$|A PlayStation 2 port of the game, retitled Deus Ex: The Conspiracy {{outside of}} Europe, was {{released}} on March 26, 2002. Along with pre-rendered introductory and ending cinematics that replaced the original versions, it features <b>a</b> <b>simplified</b> interface with optional auto-aim and motion captured character models. There are many minor changes in level design, some {{for the purpose of}} balancing gameplay, but most to accommodate loading transition areas, due to the memory limitations of the PlayStation 2. The PlayStation 2 version was rereleased in Europe on the PlayStation 3 as a PlayStation 2 Classic on May 16, 2012.|$|E

In this set up there are two firms, one foreign and one {{domestic}} which are considering entering a new export market in a third country (or possibly the whole world). The demand in the export market is such that if only one firm enters, {{it will make a}} profit, but if they both enter each will make a loss, perhaps because of initial set up, infrastructure, product development, marketing or other fixed costs of entry. The matrix below presents a stylized example of the game that the two firms are engaged in.|$|E

The basic unit of Volta's pile was <b>a</b> <b>simplified</b> galvanic cell, made of plates of copper and zinc separated by an electrolyte and {{connected by a}} conductor externally. The units were stacked in series to make the Voltaic cell, which produced electricity by directing electrons from the zinc to the copper and allowing the zinc to corrode.|$|E
5|$|In {{designing}} the 777 {{as its first}} fly-by-wire commercial aircraft, Boeing decided to retain conventional control yokes rather than change to sidestick controllers as used in many fly-by-wire fighter aircraft and in many Airbus airliners. Along with traditional yoke and rudder controls, the cockpit features <b>a</b> <b>simplified</b> layout that retains similarities to previous Boeing models. The fly-by-wire system also incorporates flight envelope protection, a system that guides pilot inputs within a computer-calculated framework of operating parameters, acting to prevent stalls, overspeeds, and excessively stressful maneuvers. This system can be overridden by the pilot if deemed necessary. The fly-by-wire system is supplemented by mechanical backup.|$|E
