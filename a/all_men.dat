5|$|Eric Foner (2010) {{contrasts}} the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast who saw slavery as a sin, {{with the}} conservative Republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the republicanism principles of the Founding Fathers, especially the equality of <b>all</b> <b>men</b> and democratic self-government as expressed in the Declaration of Independence.|$|E
5|$|He was {{critically}} {{wounded in}} an ambush in Prague on 27 May 1942 by a British Special Operations Executive-trained team of Czech and Slovak {{soldiers who had}} been sent by the Czechoslovak government-in-exile to kill him in Operation Anthropoid. He died from his injuries a week later. Nazi intelligence falsely linked the assassins to the villages of Lidice and Ležáky. Both villages were razed; <b>all</b> <b>men</b> and boys {{over the age of}} 16 were shot, and all but a handful of the village's women and children were deported and killed in Nazi concentration camps.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon {{directly}} overthrew feudal {{remains in}} much of western Continental Europe. He liberalised property laws, ended seigneurial dues, abolished the guild of merchants and craftsmen to facilitate entrepreneurship, legalised divorce, closed the Jewish ghettos and made Jews equal to everyone else. The Inquisition ended as did the Holy Roman Empire. The power of church courts and religious authority was sharply reduced and equality under the law was proclaimed for <b>all</b> <b>men.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{class of}} determiners {{is used to}} specify the noun they precede in terms of {{definite}}ness, where the marks a definite noun and a or an an indefinite one. A definite noun is assumed by the speaker to be already known by the interlocutor, whereas an indefinite noun is not specified as being previously known. Quantifiers, which include one, many, some and all, are used to specify the noun in terms of quantity or number. The noun must agree {{with the number of}} the determiner, e.g. one man (sg.) but <b>all</b> <b>men</b> (pl.). Determiners are the first constituents in a noun phrase.|$|E
5|$|Widespread {{segregation}} in 19th- and early 20th-century North America {{made it difficult}} for African-Americans to join Lodges outside of Prince Hall jurisdictions– and impossible for inter-jurisdiction recognition between the parallel U.S. Masonic authorities. By the 1980s, such discrimination was a thing of the past, and today most U.S. Grand Lodges recognise their Prince Hall counterparts, and the authorities of both traditions are working towards full recognition. The United Grand Lodge of England has no problem with recognising Prince Hall Grand Lodges. While celebrating their heritage as lodges of black Americans, Prince Hall is open to <b>all</b> <b>men</b> regardless of race or religion.|$|E
5|$|A {{thousand}} years before The Sword of Shannara, an Elf named Galaphile gathers {{all of the}} people who still had some knowledge of the old world to Paranor to try to bring peace and order to all of the races. They name themselves the First Druid Council. Brona, a rogue Druid, and his followers leave, taking the Ildatch with them; this magical tome controls their minds. 250 years later, Brona begins the First War of the Races when he convinces <b>all</b> <b>Men</b> to attack the other races. He almost succeeds in seizing rule of the Four Lands, but the tide turns, and the war ends with his defeat and disappearance. The Druids divide the Four Lands among the races and become reclusive, withdrawing to Paranor because of their shame at the betrayal by one of their own members.|$|E

5|$|Based on the {{assumption}} that man is a social animal, Saint-Just argues that in nature {{there is no need for}} contracts, legislation, or acts of force. These constructs only become necessary when a society is in need of moral regeneration and serve merely as unsatisfactory substitutes for the natural bonds of free people. Such constructs permit small groups to assume unwarranted powers which, according to Saint-Just, leads to corruption within society. Because a return to the natural state is impossible, Saint-Just argues for a government composed of the most educated members of society, who could be expected to share an understanding of the larger social good. Outside the government itself, Saint-Just asserts there must be full equality between <b>all</b> <b>men,</b> including equal security in material possessions and personal independence. Property must be protected by the state but, in order to secure universal independence, all citizens (including women) must own property.|$|E
5|$|Bermuda's {{debut in}} the Olympic Games began with the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Nazi Germany, when the Bermudian {{delegation}} included five athletes, <b>all</b> <b>men.</b> Bermuda had appeared in twenty-one Olympic Games between 1936 and the 2008 Beijing Olympics, excluding the 1980 Summer Olympics. Of those twenty-one games, sixteen of them were Summer Olympics. Bermuda had, prior to Beijing, earned one medal, when Clarence Hill won bronze in the 1976 Summer Olympics. The 2008 Bermudian delegation had fewer people than it usually sent abroad, prompting {{the president of the}} Bermudian Olympic Association Austin Woods to complain publicly that the year's Olympic team lacked access to quality coaches, administrators, and facilities, and with the exception of several athletes, lacked the skill to be competitive.|$|E
5|$|By 13 September the regiment's {{strength}} was four officers and eighty other ranks. All of them except fourteen machine-gunners were evacuated {{to the island}} of Lemnos. Of the original contingent who had landed in May only twenty-four men were still with the regiment. On 10 November reinforcements increased the regiment's total to nine officers and 363 other ranks, and they returned to Gallipoli, reaching the front line at Hill 60 on 27 November. Lack of manpower meant they could not fully man their trenches, so a system was adopted where six men manned a post, with only two on duty during the day. At night <b>all</b> <b>men</b> were awake and also patrolled between posts and into no man's land.|$|E

5|$|In July and August, the 9th Armoured Brigade {{worked in}} support of the 4th and 10th Indian Infantry Divisions in the central {{mountains}} south east of Florence, on the approach to the Gothic Line. In August, the order was received that <b>all</b> <b>men</b> with over 4½ years service overseas should be repatriated, and this reduced the regiment's strength by half. This made it impossible to function as a fighting unit and it was withdrawn from the line of battle. In October 1944, the regiment returned to England to train replacements for armoured regiments still fighting in Europe. It continued in this role until 1946, although the pace slowed after victory in Europe in May 1945.|$|E
5|$|In early 1915, {{the sisters}} were all {{assigned}} to the Grand Fleet, each as flagship of their respective squadrons. Just before the Battle of Jutland on 31 May 1916, the 2nd and 7th Cruiser Squadrons were combined with Minotaur as the flagship. During the battle the 2nd Cruiser Squadron was unengaged and did not fire their guns. In contrast the 1st Cruiser Squadron was engaged at close range by the German capital ships during the battle; Defence was hit by two salvoes from the German ships that caused the aft 9.2-inch magazine to explode. The resulting fire spread via the ammunition passages to the adjacent 7.5-inch magazines which detonated in turn. The ship exploded {{with the loss of}} <b>all</b> <b>men</b> on board; between 893 and 903 men were killed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1860s, many {{counties}} in Pennsylvania were staunch {{supporters of the}} Democratic Party, while the newly {{elected president of the}} United States was the Republican Abraham Lincoln. When a large number of men were drafted from Columbia County, tensions led to raids and arrests in Columbia and neighboring counties. As early as 1862, the local press expressed outrage at a draft of 636 men, mostly mechanics and laborers. An 1863 law requiring <b>all</b> <b>men</b> from 20 to 45 years old to be drafted increased tensions further. On July 20 locals broke into the district draft office and stole the items inside. But besides this event, there was little active violence against officials of the 1863 draft.|$|E
