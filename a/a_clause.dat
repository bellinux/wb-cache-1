5|$|If {{there is}} <b>a</b> <b>clause</b> {{in which one}} of the clause's two {{variables}} has already been set, and the clause could still become either true or false, then the other variable is set in a way that forces the clause to become true.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} project was negotiated {{as an international}} treaty {{between the two countries}} rather than a commercial agreement between companies and included <b>a</b> <b>clause,</b> originally asked for by the UK, imposing heavy penalties for cancellation.

50|$|<b>A</b> non-cancellation <b>clause</b> {{is valid}} and {{enforceable}} and restrictively interpreted, and {{applies only to}} consensual cancellations. To be effective, therefore, <b>a</b> non-cancellation <b>clause</b> must be coupled with <b>a</b> non-variation <b>clause.</b> <b>A</b> non-waiver <b>clause</b> is also valid and enforceable, but it is restrictively interpreted.|$|R

50|$|A center {{embedded}} sentence {{is difficult to}} comprehend when <b>a</b> relative <b>clause</b> is embedded in another relative clause.

5|$|All this time, Bradbury {{remained}} nominally {{a professor}} in absentia at Stanford. The Los Alamos Laboratory was nominally run under a wartime contract with the University of California, but <b>a</b> <b>clause</b> in the contract allowed the University to terminate the contract {{three months after the}} end of the war. The university duly served notice, but Bradbury managed to get it rescinded, and in 1948 the contract was renewed. In 1951, he became a professor at the University of California.|$|E
5|$|At first, CBS {{refused to}} pay Larson, {{considering}} him a cheater. However, Brockman and the producers could not find <b>a</b> <b>clause</b> in the game's rules with which to disqualify him (largely because the board had been constructed with these patterns {{from the beginning of}} the series), and the network complied. Because he had surpassed the CBS winnings cap (at the time) of $25,000, Larson was not allowed to return for the next show.|$|E
5000|$|<b>A</b> Horn <b>clause</b> with {{exactly one}} {{positive}} literal {{is a definite}} clause; <b>a</b> definite <b>clause</b> with no negative literals is sometimes called a fact; and <b>a</b> Horn <b>clause</b> without <b>a</b> positive literal is sometimes called <b>a</b> goal <b>clause</b> (note that the empty clause consisting of no literals is <b>a</b> goal <b>clause).</b> These three kinds of Horn clauses are illustrated in the following propositional example: ...|$|R
50|$|Horn <b>clauses</b> play <b>a</b> basic role in {{constructive}} {{logic and}} computational logic.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{elucidate}} the relationships between sentence patterns and subject forms of Mongolian object clauses in terms of the distributions of the reflexive-possessive suffixes and the personal possessive proclitics. The sentence patterns have the following two types: a normal type whose word order is <b>a</b> main <b>clause</b> subject, <b>an</b> object <b>clause</b> and <b>a</b> main <b>clause</b> predicate; <b>a</b> topic type which consists of <b>a</b> sentence-first object <b>clause</b> and <b>a</b> main <b>clause.</b> The subject forms include four variants, that is, the zero (covert) form, the accusative, the genitive and the nominative, depending on the coreferentiality or non-coreferentiality between <b>a</b> main <b>clause</b> subject and <b>an</b> object <b>clause</b> one. The study demonstrates that the zero subject, in fact, is divided into an anaphoric type and a pronominal type according to the binding principle of the personal possessive proclitics as well as the reflexive-possessive suffixes. It also suggests that the choice of the accusative, the genitive and the nominative has something to do with the degree of integration of <b>a</b> main <b>clause</b> and <b>an</b> object <b>clause.</b> 学術論...|$|R
5|$|Frears had <b>a</b> <b>clause</b> in his {{contract}} {{that allowed him}} to direct any sequels. The success of The Deal prompted the production team to consider a new film—possibly surrounding Britain's commitment to the war in Iraq. In 2004, production was announced that the first follow-up would be produced for a theatrical film release in 2006, The Queen; that dramatises the weeks following the death of Princess Diana on 31 August 1997. Langan described the film as not being a direct sequel, only that it reunited the same creative team.|$|E
5|$|George mainly {{lived in}} Great Britain after 1714 though he visited {{his home in}} Hanover in 1716, 1719, 1720, 1723 and 1725; in total George spent about one fifth of his reign as King in Germany. <b>A</b> <b>clause</b> in the Act of Settlement that forbade the British monarch from leaving the country without Parliament's {{permission}} was unanimously repealed in 1716.

5|$|If {{there is}} <b>a</b> <b>clause</b> both of whose {{variables}} are already set, {{in a way}} that falsifies the clause, then the algorithm backtracks to its most recent choice point, undoing the assignments it made since that choice, and reverses the decision made at that choice. If there is no choice point, or if the algorithm has already backtracked over the most recent choice point, then it aborts the search and reports that the input 2-CNF formula is unsatisfiable.|$|E
50|$|A primary {{division}} for {{the discussion}} of clauses is the distinction between main clauses (i.e. matrix clauses, independent clauses) and subordinate clauses (i.e. embedded <b>clauses,</b> dependent <b>clauses).</b> <b>A</b> main <b>clause</b> can stand alone, i.e. it can constitute a complete sentence by itself. <b>A</b> subordinate <b>clause</b> (i.e. embedded clause), in contrast, is reliant on {{the appearance of a}} main clause; it depends on the main clause and is therefore <b>a</b> dependent <b>clause,</b> whereas the main <b>clause</b> is <b>an</b> independent <b>clause.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 1785 Barbary pirates, {{most notably}} from Algiers, began to seize American {{merchant}} {{vessels in the}} Mediterranean. In 1793 alone, eleven American ships were captured and their crews and stores held for ransom. To combat this problem, proposals were made for warships to protect American shipping, resulting in the Naval Act of 1794.

40|$|Finite {{declarative}} complement clauses in Afrikaans prototypically {{take the}} form of <b>a</b> dependent <b>clause</b> embedded in <b>a</b> superordinate <b>clause,</b> usually called the matrix clause.

The change allowed the Bush Administration to appoint interim U.S. attorneys without term limits, and without confirmation by the Senate. The Bush administration used the law to place at least eight interim attorneys into office in 2006. Specter claimed that the changes were added by staff member Brett Tolman.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the thesis {{is to focus on}} the institute of <b>a</b> non-competition <b>clause</b> within the Czech legal system. A special emphasis is put on the analysis of each of the aspects of <b>a</b> non-competition <b>clause</b> and the inclusion of <b>a</b> non-competition <b>clause</b> not only in the labour law, but also in the civil law as a whole. The thesis is divided into four chapters. These chapters are the History of <b>a</b> non- competition <b>clause,</b> Basic terms, Current legislation of <b>a</b> non-competition <b>clause</b> in the labour law and the Legislation of other institutes that regulate competitive conduct. The chapters are further divided into subchapters. Chapter One explains the historical development of <b>a</b> non-competition <b>clause</b> from the nineteenth century to the present day. The most important period was the 1990 s, when <b>a</b> non- competition <b>clause</b> slowly began to return into the Czech legal system with the assistance of jurisprudence and legal literature. Chapter Two enumerates the most important terms, which occur in connection with <b>a</b> non-competition <b>clause.</b> This chapter includes, for example, the definition of the labour law. The chapter concludes with defining the terms competition and non-competition clause. Chapter Three focuses on the current legislation of <b>a</b> non-competition <b>clause,</b> which is based on linking the Labour [...] ...|$|R
