5|$|After he {{was passed}} over by Johnny Behan for the {{position}} of undersheriff, Wyatt thought he might beat him in the next Cochise County election in late 1882. He thought catching the murderers of Bud Philpot and Peter Roerig would help him win the sheriff's office. Wyatt later said that on June 2, 1881 he offered the Wells, Fargo & Co. reward money <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> Ike Clanton if he would provide information leading to the capture or death of the stage robbers. According to Wyatt, Ike was initially interested, but the plan was foiled when the three suspects—Leonard, Head and Crane—were killed in unrelated incidents.|$|E
5|$|By July Dyer {{was back}} in Britain and was fit enough to {{re-enter}} the ring, stopping Nicol Brady via technical knockout in a contest in Wallsend. He followed this with a points decision over Jack Zimmer and then won through Will Brooks' disqualification in a contest held in Cardiff. In November 1920 Dyer was invited to the National Sporting Club in London to face 'Bermondsey' Billy Wells. During the bout the referee twice instructed both men to make a proper contest of the fight. The referee let the match go the full fifteen rounds and then, instead of declaring a winner, he called the fight a 'no contest', with the fighters' purse being given to charity. After the National Sporting Club debacle, Dyer turned more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> his singing and very few fights are recorded after 1920. A fight against Jim Slater in January 1922 {{is believed to be}} his last bout.|$|E
5|$|Even {{among other}} festive music written by Bach, this work's scoring for four {{trumpets}} is unusual. It is characterised {{by a very}} solemn character and the attributes of courtly homage music, such as the opening chorus {{in the form of}} a French overture or fanfare-like trumpet interjections in the bass recitative. Bach created a work that in musical terms corresponds less to sacred music <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> the type of secular music for a princely court, as had been required of him during his time in office in Köthen. Only in its final two movements does Bach again use simple forms to emphasize the work's character of a church cantata, implying that earthly powers do not last, but God – the supreme ruler – is entitled to have the last word.|$|E

50|$|The mass {{of a long}} gun {{is usually}} {{greater than that of}} a short gun, making the long gun <b>more</b> {{expensive}} <b>to</b> transport, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> difficult <b>and</b> tiring <b>to</b> carry. The increased moment of inertia makes the long gun slower <b>and</b> <b>more</b> difficult <b>to</b> traverse <b>and</b> elevate, and it is thus slower <b>and</b> <b>more</b> difficult <b>to</b> adjust the aim. However, this also results in greater stability in aiming. The greater amount of material in a long gun tends <b>to</b> make it <b>more</b> expensive <b>to</b> manufacture, other factors being equal. The greater size makes it <b>more</b> difficult <b>to</b> conceal, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> inconvenient <b>to</b> use in confined quarters, as well as requiring a larger storage space.|$|R

5|$|The Caspian expeditions of the Rus' were {{military}} raids {{undertaken by}} the Rus' between 864 and 1041 on the Caspian Sea shores, of what are nowadays Iran, Dagestan, and Azerbaijan. Initially, the Rus' appeared in Serkland in the 9th century traveling as merchants along the Volga trade route, selling furs, honey, and slaves. The first small-scale raids {{took place in the}} late 9th and early 10th century. The Rus' undertook the first large-scale expedition in 913; having arrived on 500 ships, they pillaged in the Gorgan region, in the territory of present-day Iran, <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> the west, in Gilan and Mazandaran, taking slaves and goods. On their return, the northern raiders were attacked and defeated by the Khazars in the Volga Delta, and those who escaped were killed by the local tribes on the middle Volga.|$|E

25|$|Warren Buffett {{has also}} argued against EMH, {{most notably in}} his 1984 {{presentation}} The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville, saying the preponderance of value investors among the world's best money managers rebuts the claim of EMH proponents that luck is the reason some investors appear more successful than others. As Malkiel has shown, over the 30 years (to 1996) {{more than two-thirds of}} professional portfolio managers have been outperformed by the S 500 Index (<b>and,</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> the point, there is little correlation between those who outperform in one year and those who outperform in the next).|$|E
25|$|The labor sector did not {{cooperate}} {{with the government and}} the PIR became discredited because of its alliance with the conservative forces.

As the labor sector became more radical, the government resorted more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> oppression, and confrontations increased. The dismissal of 7,000 miners and the brutal suppression of yet another uprising in Catavi in 1949 made any cooperation {{between the government and the}} workers impossible.|$|E

25|$|Incentive {{theory is}} a {{specific}} theory of motivation, derived partly from behaviorist principles of reinforcement, which concerns an incentive or motive to do something. The most common incentive would be a compensation. Compensation can be tangible or intangible, It helps in motivating the employees in their corporate life, students in academics and inspire to do more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> achieve profitability in every field. Studies show that if the person receives the reward immediately, the effect is greater, and decreases as delay lengthens. Repetitive action-reward combination can cause the action to become a habit.|$|E

25|$|It {{is evident}} {{how much he}} learned from Arcangelo Corelli about writing for instruments, and from Alessandro Scarlatti about writing for the solo voice; {{but there is no}} single {{composer}} who taught him how to write for chorus. Handel tended more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> replace Italian soloists by English ones. The most significant reason for this change was the dwindling financial returns from his operas. Thus a tradition was created for oratorios which was to govern their future performance. The performances were given without costumes and action; the singers appeared in their own clothes.|$|E

25|$|The {{feelings}} {{of the members of}} this movement against the participation of foreign-born citizens in municipal affairs had grown very bitter, and Westervelt set himself so sternly against them that his house was mobbed again. Probably due to the paucity of support for his reformist efforts during his term, but also because he applied himself more <b>and</b> <b>more</b> <b>to</b> the business of shipbuilding again, Westervelt declined a renomination, which for him was equivalent to an election, and was succeeded as Mayor by Fernando Wood.
