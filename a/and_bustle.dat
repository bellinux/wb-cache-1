5|$|As the day {{of their}} May 9, 1840, wedding approached, some family members still looked upon Houston with {{uncertainty}} and were determined to stop what they believed would be a disastrous union for Margaret. She would not be deterred, however, and the Reverend Peter Crawford officiated over the wedding of Margaret and the man {{with whom she had}} fallen in love. The newlyweds spent their honeymoon week at the Lafayette Hotel before sailing to Galveston, where Nancy and the Bledsoes had already established residences. Houston retained a house he owned in the city named for him, but Margaret had no taste for the hustle <b>and</b> <b>bustle</b> and preferred the lesser-populated Galveston. She and her personal slaves, who had accompanied the newlyweds from Alabama, shared her mother's house while Houston traveled.|$|E

Although the large sleeves required cushions to secure them in place, it narrowed down {{towards the end of}} the decade. Women thus adopted the style of the tailored jacket, which improved their posture and confidence, while reflecting the standards of early female liberation.|$|E

Here the hustle <b>and</b> <b>bustle,</b> the exuberant colour and relaxed atmosphere, prevalent at the various Nambassa village marketplaces, was a feature. These centers of community are where one found the main information centre or where folks simply culminated just to absorb the diverse quirky celebratory ambiance. Over the various festivals the marketplaces evolved and became major attractions in themselves. Not only a space for the enjoyment of bartering for the various eclective products and oddities, but they were a place of fun and entertainment, spontaneous or otherwise. The idea of a marketplace servicing the local population, {{as a method of}} doing business, buying, selling and exchanging products, is as old as civilization itself.|$|E

25|$|For {{many years}} Upper Hutt was a rural service town {{supporting}} the surrounding rural farming and forestry community.

In 1950 Trentham Memorial Park was created with an area of almost 50 hectares. In July 1955, the electrification of the railway line from Wellington to Upper Hutt was completed, allowing fast electric multiple unit trains to replace steam- and diesel-electric-hauled carriage trains. Later in November, the 8.8km Rimutaka Tunnel opened, bypassing the Rimutaka Incline {{and most of the}} existing line between Upper Hutt and Featherston, and reducing the time between the two from 2.5 hours to just 40 minutes.|$|E

500|$|In most households, cooking {{was done}} on an open hearth {{in the middle of}} the main living area, to make {{efficient}} use of the heat. This was the most common arrangement, even in wealthy households, for most of the Middle Ages, where the kitchen was combined with the dining hall. Towards the Late Middle Ages a separate kitchen area began to evolve. The first step was to move the fireplaces towards the walls of the main hall, and later to build a separate building or wing that contained a dedicated kitchen area, often separated from the main building by a covered arcade. This way, the smoke, odors <b>and</b> <b>bustle</b> of the kitchen could be kept out of sight of guests, and the fire risk lessened. Few medieval kitchens survive as they were [...] "notoriously ephemeral structures".|$|E
