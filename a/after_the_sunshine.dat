This started and finished before the demolition of Old Sunshine Skyway in 1993 as the Superboy TV series ended its run about one year before the bridge demolition in 1992.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Tokyo <b>Sunshine</b> Boys, named <b>after</b> <b>the</b> play <b>The</b> <b>Sunshine</b> Boys by {{director}} Neil Simon, specialised in situation comedy, {{a form of}} theatre {{originating in}} radio that got its laughs from the awkward situations their characters were placed in {{as opposed to the}} more traditional protagonist vs. antagonist plots. Mitani Kōki had a special admiration for Neil Simon and Woody Allen, both writers who also specialised in situation comedy.|$|R

All these three films picture a typical Central European characters and all of them were represented by Klaus Maria Brandauer. István Szabó said something fundamental about the connection of 20th century power, politics and art. <b>After</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sunshine</b> (1998) he worked on adaptations like the Taking Sides (2001), Relatives (2006) or The Door (2012) that, similar to his earlier work, analyze the relationship between the individual, the power and the audience.|$|E
5000|$|As {{the above}} {{description}} indicates, the route initially had different termini. On its western end, LA 22 once crossed the Mississippi River by ferry between Darrow and Donaldsonville and continued along {{what is now}} LA 18 to its junction with LA 1. [...] However, the ferry service was discontinued in 1966 <b>after</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sunshine</b> Bridge was completed just downriver from Donaldsonville. On its eastern end, LA 22 originally terminated in Ponchatoula since the highway extending from there to Mandeville was temporarily part of US 190 {{at the time of}} the 1955 renumbering. When US 190 was returned to its regular route through Covington the following year, LA 22 was extended to its current terminus at Chinchuba, an area now within the Mandeville city limits. [...] The actual terminus was a simple Y-intersection at what is now LA 3228 (Asbury Drive) until the present diamond interchange aligned with North Causeway Boulevard was constructed in 1981.|$|E

5000|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> 1980s, <b>the</b> <b>Sunshine</b> Coast {{experienced}} {{rapid population}} growth. [...] {{it had become}} one of the fastest-growing regions in Australia. As the region becomes increasingly residential, most of the district's distinctive small farms - especially tropical-fruit and sugar-cane farms have disappeared, as have most of its theme parks. The Moreton sugar mills closure in 2003 removed a market for the district's 120 cane growers who had been harvesting cane in the region. Instead, businesses concerned with retail, catering and tourism have assumed increasing importance.|$|R

5000|$|Through {{the years}} {{following}} Bob Shane's acquisition of the Kingston Trio name in 1976, the personnel in the group changed several times, though Shane and George Grove remained constants.

Roger Gambill died shortly <b>after</b> <b>the</b> release of Looking for <b>the</b> <b>Sunshine</b> and was replaced by Bob Haworth.

60|$|It {{was with}} a sigh of relief that at last he came upon the little {{unpainted}} house, extraordinarily bedraggled now, and unkempt; but here too was the same intolerable silence. He walked up, and a little boy, playing unconcernedly in <b>the</b> <b>sunshine,</b> started at his approach and fled quickly away: to him the stranger was the enemy. Dr. Coutras had a sense that the child was stealthily watching him from behind a tree. The door was wide open. He called out, but no one answered. He stepped in. He knocked at a door, but again there was no answer. He turned the handle and entered. The stench that assailed him turned him horribly sick. He put his handkerchief to his nose and forced himself to go in. The light was dim, and <b>after</b> <b>the</b> brilliant <b>sunshine</b> for a while he could see nothing. Then he gave a start. He could not make out where he was. He seemed on a sudden to have entered a magic world. He had a vague impression of a great primeval forest and of naked people walking beneath the trees. Then he saw that there were paintings on the walls.|$|R
60|$|Colville slept late, and awoke with a vague {{sense of}} self-reproach, which faded {{afterward}} to such poor satisfaction as {{comes to us}} from the consciousness of having made the best of a bad business; some pangs of softer regret mixed with this. At first he felt a stupid obligation to keep indoors, and he really did not go out till <b>after</b> lunch. <b>The</b> <b>sunshine</b> had looked cold from his window, and with the bright fire which he found necessary in his room, he fancied a bitterness in the gusts that caught up the dust in the piazza, and blew it against the line of cabs on the other side; but when he got out into the weather he found the breeze mild and the sun warm. The streets were thronged with people, and at all the corners there were groups of cloaked and overcoated talkers, soaking themselves full of <b>the</b> <b>sunshine.</b> <b>The</b> air throbbed, as always, with the sound of bells, but it was a mellower and opener sound than before, and looking at the purple bulk of one of those hills which seem to rest like clouds {{at the end of each}} avenue in Florence, Colville saw that it was clear of snow. He was going up through Via Cavour to find Mr. Waters and propose a walk, but he met him before he had got half-way to San Marco.|$|R
50|$|Sunshine was {{not immune}} when many Australian-based {{manufacturing}} industries started winding down during and <b>after</b> <b>the</b> 1970s.

50|$|<b>After</b> <b>the</b> {{collapse}} of <b>Sunshine,</b> Pat Aulton discovered that Dayman {{had made him}} {{a director of the}} company without his knowledge, and when Sunshine's creditors moved in to recover their debts, Aulton's unwitting liability cost him his car, furniture and other assets. Fortunately, he was by then well-known to Festival managing director Fred Marks, who rescued Aulton with the offer of a position as a staff producer at Festival. It is not known whether Dayman retained any interest or played any role in <b>the</b> company <b>after</b> 1967, although he continued to operate his promotions and management business in several cities.|$|R

Precious and Sunshine (now aligned with Chris Adams) feuded while Garvin traded the NWA American Heavyweight Championship with Adams. During this time, the couples competed in mixed tag-team matches. Sunshine temporarily left WCCW in 1984 (with the storyline excuse that she had been injured by Garvin and Precious) and was replaced in the feud with her [...] "truck driving aunt", Stella Mae French (Tanya West). Adams and Stella Mae continued to compete in mixed tag team matches against Garvin and Precious until they defeated them in a [...] "Loser Leaves Town" [...] cage match in July 1984. Garvin and Precious then left World Class for the American Wrestling Association. Garvin and Adams would revive their feud ten years later in the Global Wrestling Federation, but the promotion went out of business before that angle got off the ground.|$|R
