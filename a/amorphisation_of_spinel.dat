40|$|Abstract. The spinel growth induces {{undulation}} of {{the thermal}} growth oxide layer and decreases the service life of plasma-sprayed thermal barrier coatings. An analytical model is introduced {{to investigate the}} effect <b>of</b> <b>spinel</b> growth on the delamination of thermal barrier coating. The analytical {{results show that the}} number per unit area and the growth rate <b>of</b> <b>spinel</b> have significant influence on the delamination of thermal barrier coating. The stiffer and thicker thermal barrier coating is more easily to delaminate from the bond coat due to the existence <b>of</b> <b>spinels.</b> The effect <b>of</b> <b>spinel</b> on the delamination cannot be neglected. How to reduce the growth rate and the number <b>of</b> <b>spinel</b> is a key problem to prolong the service life of thermal barrier coatings...|$|R

40|$|A {{substantial}} number of new chemical entities and marketed drugs show poor solubility characteristics and <b>amorphisation</b> is one <b>of</b> the favorable approaches to enhance solubility characteristics of such poorly soluble drugs. Formulation efforts {{in the present study}} were devoted to investigate <b>amorphisation</b> <b>of</b> a model poorly soluble drug, atorvastatin calcium by molecular complexation with anion exchange resin, Duolite® AP 143 / 1093 and hence enhancement in its solubility characteristics. Drug resinates in 1 : 1, 1 : 2, and 1 : 4 weight ratios were prepared by simple batch operation and subsequently studied for drug content, residual solvent content, molecular interactions, solid state characterisation and solubility characteristics. During initial characterisation, all the proportions of drug resinates, except 1 : 1 proportion showed partial <b>amorphisation</b> <b>of</b> the drug, whereas 1 : 1 proportion showed complete <b>amorphisation</b> <b>of</b> the drug. This proportion reported distinctly enhanced solubility characteristics over pure drug and other proportions. Such amorphisation and solubility enhancement could be attributed to the binding of individual drug molecules to the functional sites of the resin molecules, either partially or completely, resulting in reduction of crystal lattice energy, a main barrier to dissolution. Hydrophilic nature of ion exchange resin matrices also assisted in enhancing dissolution of the drug from the resinates. During accelerated stability study, there was an insignificant decrease in solubility characteristics of the drug and its amorphous form was also found to be stable in 1 : 1 proportion. Atorvastatin resinates formed in 1 : 1 weight ratio were in stoichiometric proportion and such drug resinates in stoichiometric proportion showed to have tremendous potential in conversion of crystalline form of drug substances to its amorphous form and subsequent stabilisation. It hence proved to be a very effective, yet simple approach for improving solubility characteristics of poorly soluble actives...|$|R

The chemical range <b>of</b> <b>spinels</b> is distinguishable between the three settings in terms of Cr# (=Cr/(Cr+Al) atomic ratio) and Ti content. The relationships are almost parallel with those <b>of</b> chromian <b>spinels</b> in volcanic rocks, but the Ti content is slightly lower in plutonics than in volcanics at a given tectonic environment. The Cr# <b>of</b> <b>spinels</b> in plutonic rocks is highly diverse; its ranges overlap between the three settings, but extend to higher values (up to 0. 8) in arc and oceanic hotspot environments. The Ti content <b>of</b> <b>spinels</b> in plutonics increases, for a given lithology, from the arc to oceanic hotspot settings by mid-ocean ridge on average. This chemical diversity is consistent with that of erupted magmas from the three settings.

40|$|Spinels and ilmenites are {{relatively}} sparse in the Luna 24 gabbro and basalts. Spinel compositions show some affinities to those <b>of</b> <b>spinels</b> in Apollo 12, Apollo 14 and Luna 16 basalts; a characteristic feature is high Al 2 O 3, reaching {{a maximum of}} 19. 8 wt%. A comparison <b>of</b> <b>spinels</b> in the Luna 24 gabbro with those in other deep-seated lunar intrusive rocks shows a characteristic trend for Fe/Mg. This trend is systematic from gabbro to anorthosite to troctolite and is interpreted to be P-T dependent. Compositions <b>of</b> <b>spinels</b> in the gabbro fall within the Cr/Al trend defined by the <b>spinels</b> <b>of</b> the basalts, but form a Fe/Mg trend parallel {{to that of the}} basalts; this relationship suggests that both the gabbro and the basalts are derived from a closely similar source region, with the basalts originating at a slightly greater depth than the gabbro. The spinels in both rock types are considered to have formed at high crustal levels, at low pressures. The Luna 24 data suggest that the compositional discontinuities which exist between chromian spinels and titanian spinels in a large proportion of mare basalts are the result of nucleation <b>of</b> chromian <b>spinels</b> at high crustal levels prior to eruption, and <b>of</b> titanian <b>spinels</b> during melt crystallization at the lunar surface...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties <b>of</b> Xe-implanted <b>spinel</b> and cubic zirconia surfaces, {{as determined by}} nano-indentation measurements, are distinct and the differences {{can be related to}} their microstructures. Upon Xe(2 +) ion irradiation at cryogenic temperature (120 K), the Young`s modulus <b>of</b> irradiated <b>spinel</b> increases slightly (a few percent) then falls dramatically until the modulus is only about 3 / 4 the unirradiated value. The maximum modulus occurs concurrent with the formation of a metastable crystalline phase <b>of</b> <b>spinel.</b> The subsequent elastic softening at higher Xe(2 +) doses is an indication of the onset of amorphization <b>of</b> the <b>spinel.</b> Xe-implanted zirconia surfaces behaves differently, in all cases showing almost no change in elastic modulus with increasing Xe(2 +) ion dose. This is consistent with microstructural observations of Xe-implanted zirconia crystals which, unlike spinel, show no change in crystal structure with increasing ion dose. The defected layer in zirconia due to ion damage simply thickens with increasing Xe(2 +) dose. This thickening may be a consequence of compressive stresses that form in the ion- implanted surface region. The hardness <b>of</b> both <b>spinel</b> and zirconia increases slightly for low Xe(2 +) ion doses. At higher doses, zirconia shows little change in hardness, while the hardness <b>of</b> the implanted <b>spinel</b> falls by more than a factor of two. The initial increase in hardness <b>of</b> both <b>spinel</b> and zirconia is probably due to point defect accumulation and the precipitation of small interstitial clusters, while the drop in hardness <b>of</b> <b>spinel</b> at high Xe(2 +) ion doses is due to the formation of an amorphous phase...|$|R

In order to overcome its brittle properties, materials with nanometric grain size are considered. In spite of the growing interest for nano-structured materials, only few experiments deal with their behaviour under irradiation. To assess and predict their evolution under working conditions, it is important to characterize their microstructure and structure. To this purpose, we have studied microcrystalline and nanocrystalline samples before and after irradiation at room temperature with 4 MeV Au ions. In fact, it is well established that such irradiation conditions lead to <b>amorphisation</b> <b>of</b> the material, which can be restored after annealing at high temperature. We have performed isochronal annealings of both materials to point out the characteristics of the healing process and eventual differences related to the initial microstructure of the samples.
