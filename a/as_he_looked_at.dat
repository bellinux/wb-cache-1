25|$|The writer's life allowed Maugham {{to travel}} and to live {{in places such as}} Spain and Capri for the next decade, but his next ten works never came close to rivalling the success of Liza. This changed in 1907 with the success of his play Lady Frederick. By the next year, he had four plays running {{simultaneously}} in London, and Punch published a cartoon of Shakespeare biting his fingernails nervously <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the billboards.|$|E
25|$|Following Duffey's murder, Nilsen {{began to}} kill with {{increasing}} frequency. Before {{the end of}} 1980, he was to kill a further five victims and attempt to murder one other, although {{only one of these}} victims whom Nilsen murdered, 26-year-old William David Sutherland, has ever been identified. Nilsen's recollections of the unidentified victims are vague, although he graphically recalled how each victim had been murdered and just how long the body had been retained before dissection. One unidentified victim killed in November had moved his legs in a cycling motion as he was strangled (Nilsen is known to have absented himself from work between 11 and 18 November, likely due to this particular murder); another unidentified victim Nilsen had unsuccessfully attempted to resuscitate, before sinking to his knees and sobbing, before standing to expressly spit at his own image <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> himself in the mirror. On another occasion, he had lain in bed alongside the body of an unidentified victim as he listened to the classical theme Fanfare for the Common Man before bursting into tears.|$|E

In {{the two years since}} he had moved to the estate, he had {{refurbished}} the house, taken up agriculture and horticulture, tended the orchard and the pond, and planted many trees, which, according to Mikhail, he [...] "looked after... as though they were his children. Like Colonel Vershinin in his Three Sisters, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> them he dreamed of what they would be like in three or four hundred years." ...|$|E

500|$|Tokugawa Ieyasu {{continued}} his campaigns allied with Toyotomi Hideyoshi. [...] After their {{victory at the}} Siege of Odawara Castle in 1590, Ieyasu agreed to relinquish all of his domains to Hideyoshi {{in exchange for the}} Kantō region to the east. [...] Hideyoshi died in 1598. By 1603, Ieyasu had recovered Sunpu Castle and completed his unification of Japan, and had been named shogun by the Emperor. [...] The following year, he had Ryūsen-ji moved from Yunoki to Kōyamachi near Sunpu Castle and attended Buddhist funeral rites conducted in honor of the late Lady Saigō on the anniversary of her death. [...] To mark the occasion, Ieyasu presented the temple priests with the katana he inherited from his father, and a portrait of himself <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the time. [...] These items can still be viewed at the temple in Shizuoka city.|$|E
500|$|Much of Barrymore's {{early life}} was unsettled. In October 1882, the family toured in the US {{for a season}} with Polish actress Helena Modjeska. The {{following}} year his parents toured again with Modjeska but left the children behind. Modjeska was influential in the family, and she insisted that all three children be baptized into the Catholic Church. In 1884 the family traveled to London as part of Augustin Daly's theatrical company, returning to the US two years later. As a child, Barrymore was sometimes badly behaved, and he was sent away to schools {{in an attempt to}} instill discipline. The strategy was not always successful, and he attended elementary schools in four states. He was sent first to the boys' annex of the Convent of Notre Dame in Philadelphia. One punishment that he received there was being made to read a copy of Dante's Inferno; he later recounted that, <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the illustrations by Gustave Doré, [...] "my interest was aroused, and a new urge was born within me. I wanted to be an artist". He was expelled from the school in 1891 and was sent to Seton Hall Preparatory School in New Jersey, where Lionel was already studying. Barrymore was unhappy at Seton and was soon withdrawn, after which he attended several public schools in New York, including the Mount Pleasant Military Academy.|$|E

Each knew {{the reputation of the}} other and their reputation was only the more whetted thereby (...) Bernhardt prided on her ability to conquer men, to reduce them to the level of slaves; Damala vaunted his ability as a hunter and a spoiler of women (...) Their two natures were inevitably attracted towards each other (...) Damala boasted to his friends that, as soon <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> her, the great Sarah Bernhardt would be counted in his long list of victims; and Bernhardt was no less certain that she had only to command for Damala to succumb".|$|E

2500|$|Unlike his {{previous}} postings at Aldershot and Osnabrück, while stationed in Aden, Nilsen {{had his own}} room. This afforded him the privacy to masturbate without discovery. His developed fantasies of sex with an unresistant or deceased partner unfulfilled, Nilsen compensated by imagining sexual encounters with an unconscious body as he masturbated <b>as</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> his own prone, nude body in a mirror. On one occasion, Nilsen discovered that, by using a free-standing mirror, he could create an effect whereby if positioning the mirror so his head was out of view, he could visualise himself engaged in a sexual act with another man. To Nilsen, this ruse created the ideal circumstance in which he could visually [...] "split" [...] his personality: in these masturbatory fantasies, Nilsen alternately envisaged himself as being both the domineering and the passive partner. These fantasies gradually evolved to incorporate his own near-death experience with the Arab taxi driver, the dead bodies {{he had seen in}} Aden, and imagery within a 19th-century oil painting entitled The Raft of the Medusa, which depicted an old man holding the limp, nude body of a deceased youth as he sat aside the dismembered body of another young male. In his most vividly recalled fantasy, a slender, attractive young blonde soldier who had been recently killed in battle would be dominated by a faceless [...] "dirty, grey-haired old man" [...] who would wash the body before engaging in intercourse with the spreadeagled corpse.|$|E
2500|$|Beck {{realized}} that ventricular fibrillation often occurred in hearts that were basically sound and he coined the phrase [...] "Hearts {{too good to}} die." [...] In 1947, Beck accomplished his first successful resuscitation of a 14-year-old boy using open chest massage and internal defibrillation with alternating current. The boy was being operated on for a severe congenital funnel chest. In all other respects the boy was normal. During {{the closure of the}} large incision in the chest, the pulse suddenly stopped and the blood pressure fell to zero. The boy was in cardiac arrest. Dr. Beck immediately reopened the chest and began manual heart massage. <b>As</b> <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> and felt the heart, he {{realized that}} ventricular fibrillation was present. Massage was continued for 35minutes at which time an electrocardiogram was taken that confirmed the presence of ventricular fibrillation. Another 10minutes passed before the defibrillator was brought to the operating room. The first shock using electrode paddles placed directly {{on the sides of the}} heart was unsuccessful. Beck administered procaine amide, a medicine to stabilize the heart’s rhythm. Beck gave a second shock that wiped out the fibrillation. In a very few seconds a feeble, regular, and fast contraction of the heart occurred. The blood pressure rose from zero to 50millimeters of mercury. Beck noted that the heartbeat remained regular and saw that the pressure slowly began to rise. Twenty minutes after the successful defibrillation, the chest wound was closed. By three hours, the blood pressure rose to a normal level, and the child awoke and was able to answer questions. The boy made a full recovery, with no neurological damage.|$|E
