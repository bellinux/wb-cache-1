50|$|N-ISDN (Narrowband Integrated Switch digital Network) was {{an attempt}} to replace the <b>analog</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> with a digital one.

50|$|Before B-ISDN, the {{original}} ISDN attempted to substitute the <b>analog</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system</b> {{with a digital}} system which was appropriate for both voice and non-voice traffic. Obtaining worldwide agreement on the basic rate interface standard was expected {{to lead to a}} large user demand for ISDN equipment, hence leading to mass production and inexpensive ISDN chips. However, the standardization process took years while computer network technology moved rapidly. Once the ISDN standard was finally agreed upon and products were available, it was already obsolete. For home use the largest demand for new services was video and voice transfer, but the ISDN basic rate lacks the necessary channel capacity.|$|E

50|$|The public {{switched}} {{telephone network}} (PSTN) is {{the aggregate of}} the world's circuit-switched telephone networks that are operated by national, regional, or local telephony operators, providing infrastructure and services for public telecommunication. The PSTN consists of telephone lines, fiber optic cables, microwave transmission links, cellular networks, communications satellites, and undersea telephone cables, all interconnected by switching centers, thus allowing most telephones to communicate with each other. Originally a network of fixed-line <b>analog</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>systems,</b> the PSTN is now almost entirely digital in its core network and includes mobile and other networks, as well as fixed telephones.|$|R
5000|$|The {{telex network}} is a {{switched}} network of teleprinters {{similar to a}} telephone network, {{for the purposes of}} sending text-based messages. The term refers to the network, not the teleprinters; point-to-point teleprinter systems had been in use long before telex exchanges were formed starting in the 1930s. Teleprinters evolved from telegraph systems, and, like the telegraph, they used {{the presence or absence of}} a pre-defined level of current to represent the mark or space symbols. This is as opposed to the <b>analog</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>system,</b> which used differing voltages to encode frequency information. For this reason, telex exchanges were entirely separate from the telephone system, with their own signalling standards, exchanges and system of [...] "telex numbers" [...] (the counterpart of a telephone number). When telephone and telex exchange equipment was co-located, which was not uncommon, the different signalling systems would sometimes cause interference.|$|E
