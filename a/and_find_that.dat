5|$|Because of the {{resampled}} {{convolution method}} that they describe for computing a numerical approximation of the curve-shortening flow, they call their method the resampled curvature scale space. They observe that this scale space is invariant under Euclidean transformations of the given shape, and assert that it uniquely determines {{the shape and}} is robust against small variations in the shape. They compare it experimentally against several related alternative definitions of a scale space for shapes, <b>and</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> the resampled curvature scale space is less computationally intensive, more robust against nonuniform noise, and less strongly influenced by small-scale shape differences.|$|E

5|$|Timex {{produced}} a second {{version of the}} ZX81 {{in the form of}} the TS1500, essentially an Americanised ZX81 launched in August 1983. It dispensed with the membrane keyboard and used a case similar to that of the ZX Spectrum, incorporating 16 KB of on-board memory. It was effectively a stopgap between the ZX81 and Spectrum. However, it was unsuccessful due to increased competition from rival US machines and the after-effects of Timex's botched marketing of the TS1000. Although the TS1000 had initially been a great success, Timex failed to provide the essential RAM pack upgrades to the market for two or three months after it launched the TS1000. Consumers would take the machine home, plug it in <b>and</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> it would not do anything useful due to the lack of memory.|$|E

40|$|With {{the virtual}} {{elimination}} of tariffs and quotas under GATT, antidumping measures {{emerged as a}} key instrument of protection. Under antidumping actions exporters can either raise the price to eliminate the dumping margin or pay an antidumping duty. This paper analyzes the incentives to exporters to choose between duty or settlement outcomes <b>and</b> <b>finds</b> <b>that</b> due to the smaller loss in market share exporters may prefer an antidumping duty over voluntary settlement. The paper analyzes the welfare implications of these outcomes <b>and</b> <b>finds</b> <b>that</b> they are ambiguous. ...|$|R
40|$|Although the {{non-profit}} sector {{is now the}} third largest sector of the global economy, relatively {{little is known about}} the psychological processes that underlie decisions to donate to charity. Across five experiments, the present research explores two factors that are thought to underlie giving: social norms and personal values. Study 1 elicits personal values and manipulates descriptive social norm information <b>and</b> <b>finds</b> <b>that</b> both of these factors influence giving behavior. Study 2 replicates these findings with injunctive norms in place of descriptive norms. Study 3 manipulates both descriptive and injunctive social norms within a single study <b>and</b> <b>finds</b> <b>that</b> while both have an influence on giving, they do not interact in any meaningful way with each other. Study 4 manipulates descriptive and injunctive norm information in the context of a realistic online donation decision <b>and</b> <b>finds</b> <b>that</b> both injunctive norms influence rates of giving, but that descriptive norm information alone influences willingness to give. Study 5 experimentally manipulates the costs and benefits associated with viewing social information <b>and</b> <b>finds</b> <b>that</b> while participants are willing to view social information when there are no associated costs, willingness to view information decreases dramatically under even very small costs. We conclude in Chapter 6 by discussing the implications of these findings and potential directions for future research...|$|R
