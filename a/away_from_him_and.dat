5|$|The winter had {{political}} ramifications {{and caused}} {{the public to}} lose faith in a Labour government who could not maintain food and electricity supplies. Long-time Labour activist Manny Shinwell {{was in charge of}} the coal supply. He repeatedly denied there were problems. He blamed the climate, the railway system, or capitalism generally. The cabinet had to take control <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> he became the scapegoat.|$|E
5|$|A. Alberto Contador was {{the winner}} at the podium {{ceremony}} in Milan {{on the last day}} of the 2011 Giro d'Italia, but was subsequently found to have tested positive for performing-enhancing drugs on a rest day in the 2010 Tour de France. He was originally suspended on 25 January 2011 for a year, but appealed the decision. The Court of Arbitration for Sport found him guilty of using clenbuterol during the race; thus his results since the 2010 Tour de France were taken <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> he was stripped of the win on 6 February 2012.|$|E

Susan tearfully congratulates Mike, but tells him that she cannot keep dating him if he continues to search for Zach, given Zach's history with her daughter Julie.|$|E

5|$|Black {{struggles to}} find {{anything}} useful while investigating the abduction. However, he begins to experience seemingly-psychic visions which lead him to believe she {{is being held in}} their former home. The police raid the address but find it empty; Black finds a polaroid of another house inside. He is able to track down the address of this house, but goes alone this time. Reaching it, he finds Catherine in the basement, bound to a rafter. He goes to untie her but is blinded by a camera flash. He struggles with the Polaroid Man, which we see through a series of photographs taken by the man's camera. Black is able to wrest the Polaroid Man's knife <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> stab him to death.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seventh}} stage to Bordeaux, Trousselier {{punctured}} {{after only a}} few kilometers. The rest of the cyclists quickly sped <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> Trousselier had to follow them alone for 200km. A few kilometers before Bordeaux, Trousselier caught up with the rest, and even managed to win the sprint. Louis Trousselier kept his lead {{until the end of the}} race, winning five stages. Trousselier was accused of bad sportsmanship: he reportedly smashed the inkstands of a control post to prevent his opponents from signing. Unlike the 1904 Tour de France, no stage winners, nor anyone from the top ten of the general classification, were disqualified.|$|E

Thalaba frees Othatha before {{travelling}} further until he meets an Efreet that guards a gate to the Domdaniel. After shooting an arrow into an eye of the Efreet, {{he is able to}} proceed forward where he meets Khawla and Mohareb. He is able to knock them <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> quickly moves forward to find the powerful sword of his father. The sword of flames covers Thalaba in flames which causes the area to be filled with light. This scares the sorcerers who then try to attack him. After Thalaba defeats Mohareb and the sorcerers, the voice of Mohammad asks Thalaba what he wishes. Thalaba simply gives his will up to the Prophet before destroying an evil idol, which destroys the cave.|$|E

5|$|Audi's No. 7 car of André Lotterer, Marcel Fässler and Benoît Tréluyer won {{the pole}} {{position}} and maintained their advantage on the race's first lap. Lotterer initially {{pulled away from}} the field but lost the lead to Mark Webber in Porsche's No. 1 car who remained in the position. Co-driver Brendon Hartley remained in first until he retired following heavy contact with Michael Wainwright in the No. 86 Gulf Racing car. This handed the lead to Neel Jani in the sister No. 2 car, but it switched again to Tréluyer when Jani's co-driver Marc Lieb was delayed by a slower vehicle. Although he was challenged by Lieb after being blocked by slower cars Tréluyer pulled <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> the No. 7 Audi maintained its advantage over the No. 2 Porsche {{for the majority of the}} remainder of the event to finish the race first. However the No. 7 Audi was disqualified when scrutineers discovered that its front skid block was worn out by more than the regulations allowed for, handing the victory to Lieb, Jani and Romain Dumas. Toyota No. 5 drivers Stéphane Sarrazin, Mike Conway and Kamui Kobayashi finished in second and Dominik Kraihamer, Alexandre Imperatori and Mathéo Tuscher came in third to secure Rebellion Racing's first podium in the series since 2013.|$|E

5|$|Cleveland rebounded {{from its}} first {{loss of the}} season with a 31–28 victory over the Rockets. The game started slow; Groza's 21-yard field goal was the only score in the first quarter. The Rockets then went ahead by scoring a {{touchdown}} on a long pass from quarterback Vacanti to end Elroy Hirsch. Cleveland, however, piled on the points as Motley ran for a touchdown in the second quarter and Speedie caught a pass from Graham in the third. Jones added two touchdown runs in the fourth quarter, giving Cleveland a 31–14 lead. Chicago almost caught {{up at the end of}} the game, scoring two touchdowns, but the Browns held on to win. Cleveland's third-string players were on the field in the closing minutes when Chicago made its final push. Rockets rookie Ray Ramsey had three touchdowns in the game. Graham had 239 passing yards on 10 completions. Speedie caught half of them, gaining 166 yards. His touchdown came after he dropped to the ground to grab a 17-yard pass from Graham. He faked a backward lateral while on the ground, which drew Chicago's defense <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> then got up and ran into the end zone.|$|E

25|$|In 1936, Hitler sent Charles Edward to Britain as {{president}} of the Anglo-German Friendship Society. His mission was to improve Anglo-German relations and to explore the possibility of a pact between the two countries. He attended the funeral of his first cousin George V in the uniform of a general of the German army (his British uniforms having been taken <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him),</b> <b>and</b> sent Hitler encouraging reports about the strength of pro-German sentiment among the British aristocracy.

The quake also caused extensive damage in the Marina District and the South of Market neighborhoods.|$|E

25|$|He {{remained}} an Aston Villa player, starting in a UEFA Cup tie against FH Hafnarfjordur, {{in which he}} scored in a 4–1 win. The goal against Hafnarfjordur was Barry's first European goal since he scored a penalty in the Intertoto Cup against Celta Vigo in 2000. On 18 September 2008, he made his 400th appearance in a Villa shirt in the UEFA Cup away to Litex Lovech, scoring a penalty as Villa won the match 3–1. Barry scored again for Villa as they beat Ajax 2–1 in their first UEFA Cup group match on 23 October 2008. Owing to the transfer saga, O'Neill had taken the captaincy <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> <b>and</b> handed it to centre-back Martin Laursen for the 2008–09 season. Following Laursen's injury, the captaincy was restored to Barry in January 2009. In total, he made 441 appearances for Aston Villa, scoring 52 goals in the process.|$|E
