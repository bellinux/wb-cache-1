Several short stories by Godwin were published in prominent magazines like Harper's Esquire, Ms. and the Paris Review, where she was often featured on the cover.

Effective suicide prevention requires that factors affecting suicidal ideation are specifically identified and personalized intervention programs are developed. This study aimed to identify the influencing factors of suicidal ideation in Korean elderly. The data of the 2012 Korean National Health & Nutrition Examination Survey was analyzed by using the SPSS program. Frequency, percentile, Chi-square test, multiple logistic regression were used.

5|$|In 1976, {{the fire}} {{department}} moved to Fire Station #6 with the bulb; the bulb socket's cord was severed for fear that unscrewing the bulb could damage it. It was deprived of electricity for only 22 minutes during the transfer, which was made in a specially designed box and with full firetruck escort. An electrician was on hand to install the bulb into the new fire station's emergency generator. Ripley's Believe It Or Not stated that the short delay would not mar the bulb's continuous burning record. In 2001, the bulb's 100th birthday was celebrated with a community barbecue and live music.

This was the first Grand Prix victory for a British-built car- Formula One would soon be mostly made up of British teams. 1958 was when Peter Collins won in a Ferrari and Bernie Ecclestone was entered in a Connaught but his car was driven by Jack Fairman; and 1959 and 1960 saw Australian Jack Brabham win in a mid-engined Cooper. The last race at Aintree was in 1962, when Briton Jim Clark won his first of 5 British Grands Prix; Aintree was later decommissioned in 1964.|$|E

500|$|The Sunday Mirror critic {{observed}} that The Man with the Golden Gun [...] "isn't the best Bond ever" [...] but found it [...] "remarkable that Messrs.

[...] Thirkwell also said that Moore [...] "manages to make even this reduced-voltage Bond a character with plenty of sparkle." [...] Judith Crist of New York Magazine gave a positive review, saying [...] "the scenery's grand, the lines nice and the gadgetry entertaining", also describing the production as a film that [...] "capture the free-wheeling, whooshing non-sense of early Fleming's fairy tale for grown-ups orientation".|$|E
500|$|Anders Swenson also {{reviewed}} dungeon module G-1-2-3, for Chaosium's Different Worlds magazine. Swenson {{notes that}} the lower level of the hill giant steading [...] "is a conventional underground dungeon, populated with slaves, guards, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>odd</b> monsters", but that the relatively small space occupied by the revolting slaves seems unrealistic. Swenson also calls the well-constructed dungeon complex of the fire giants [...] "a tough nut for the adventurers" [...] as the giants are in a place constructed for defense; Swenson did feel that {{the scale of the}} map was too small. Swenson comments that the reprinting shows the progress TSR has made since these adventures were first published, such as how single products had become longer. Swenson does note that the individual room descriptions were lacking a consistent format, and that important monsters can become lost {{in the middle of a}} room's description. Swenson felt that, although the lower levels can degenerate into a random monster mix, the strong points of these adventures outweigh their flaws. Swenson concludes by stating that [...] "Against the Giants is a solid adventure," [...] and that [...] "this would be a worthwhile purchase".|$|E

Eurogamer called XIII [...] "a flawed masterpiece. A game brimming with variety and a freshness lacking {{from most of the}} factory farmed franchise exercises that pass through our offices with crushing regularity". Game Revolution complimented the game's story, graphical style, voice acting and soundtrack, while criticising the gameplay as [...] "about as straightforward – and in some cases boring – as it gets for an FPS". Electronic Gaming Monthly scored the game 6.5/6.5/6.5: Joe Fielder, the first reviewer, said, [...] "You'd be hard-pressed to find a more visually stunning game than XIII", but complained that [...] "numerous frustrations pile up to make XIII more chore than thrill". The magazine's Greg Ford, who provided the third review, said that its [...] "style, cut-scenes, and story are all great, [...] the actual gameplay is pretty mundane"; he concluded, [...] "But if {{all you need is a}} solid shooter fix, XIII will do just fine.

40|$|A {{calculus}} for the derivatives of the eigen {{values of}} the neutralino mass matrix {{with respect to the}} CP violating background fields is developed and used to compute the mixings among <b>the</b> CP even <b>and</b> <b>the</b> CP <b>odd</b> Higgs sectors arising from the inclusion of the neutralino sector consisting of the neutralino, <b>the</b> Z boson, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> neutral Higgs bosons (χ 0 i −Z−h 0 −H 0) exchange in the loop contribution to the effective potential including the effects of large CP violating phases. Along with the stop, sbottom, stau and chargino-W-charged Higgs (χ+ − W − H +) contributions computed previously the present analysis completes the one loop corrections to the Higgs boson mass matrix in the presence of large phases. CP violation in the neutral Higgs sector is discussed in the above framework with specific focus on the mixings of <b>the</b> CP even <b>and</b> <b>the</b> CP <b>odd</b> sectors arising from the neutralino sector.
