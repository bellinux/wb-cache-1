5|$|After {{watching}} a dinosaur show at an arena in Springfield, Lisa discovers {{one of her}} favorite authors, T. R. Francis, working there in a dinosaur costume. The woman reveals to a shocked Lisa that she is just an actress the book publishing company used for the jacket photos, and that T. R. Francis is a complete fabrication. She further reveals that all popular young-adult book series were never each written by a single author with any inspiration, they are conceived by book publishing executives through market research and the use of multiple ghostwriters, just to make more money. When Homer finds out about this, he decides to get rich by group-writing a fantasy novel. He recruits a team consisting of Bart, Principal Skinner, Patty Bouvier, Moe Szyslak, and Professor Frink, all of whom have personal attributes or experiences that will help with writing the book: Skinner knows what teens like, Patty is a fantasy fiction fan, Moe has already published some children's books, and Frink has a computer. Lisa is shocked to find that they are group-writing a book, as she knows the only reason one would do that is to gain money. To show that what they <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> wrong, she decides to write a novel on her own with a personal story that readers will connect with.|$|E
25|$|Bowman {{realizes that}} his life has been irrevocably changed. He makes Blair record a video taped {{confession}} of his illegal actions, then kills Blair and disposes of all forensic evidence of the agents' presence. Afterwards, he hunts down and kills Blair's remaining subordinates. Bowman and his closest friends begin to systematically kill ATF agents around the nation – whom Bowman views as supporting the infringement of citizen's constitutional rights, and abusing government powers – as well as politicians who had supported unconstitutional gun control legislation. Simultaneously Bowman releases the video tape of Blair to CNN, which claims that Blair and his companions have {{had a change of}} heart, realize what they <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> wrong, and are now dedicated to killing other ATF agents. Amidst the national search for Blair and company, Bowman continues to rack up the body count.|$|E
500|$|Senator Herbert H. Lehman of New York said in {{the debate}} [...] "what we <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the most}} {{dangerous}} and inexcusable things that any great legislative body can do." [...] However, Johnson had planned carefully and had several votes in reserve. [...] When revised Amendments came to a vote, with Vice President Richard Nixon presiding over the Senate, Senator Harley M. Kilgore of West Virginia arrived to cast the deciding vote of [...] "nay." [...] The measure was defeated 60-31. [...] In the final count, thirty-two Republicans voted for the revised Bricker Amendment and fourteen voted against.|$|E

"I {{think the}} fall in bank lending would have been worse had we not {{conducted}} our asset purchases because what we <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> injecting money into the economy and what the banking system has <b>been</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> destroying money. As they {{reduce the size of}} their balance sheet and deleverage, they are reducing not just the size of their assets but the size of their liabilities. Most of the money in our economy—broad money—comprises liabilities of banks in the form of bank deposits. So what we <b>were</b> <b>doing</b> <b>was</b> partially to offset what would otherwise have been an even bigger contraction." ...|$|R
500|$|The Allied fleet {{sailed to}} Salamis, {{off the coast}} of Attica, to assist with the {{evacuation}} of the remaining Athenians. En route, Themistocles left inscriptions addressed to the Ionian Greek crews of the Persian fleet on all springs of water that they might stop at, asking them to defect to the Allied cause:"Men of Ionia, that what you <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> not proper, campaigning against your fathers and wishing to enslave Greece. It would be best if you came on our side. But if this is not possible, at least during the battle stand aside and also beg the Carians to do the same with you. But if you can not do either the one or the other, if you are chained by higher force and you can not defect during the operations, when we come at hand, act purposely as cowards remembering that we are of the same blood and that the first cause of animosity with the barbarians came from you." ...|$|E
500|$|In [...] (1999), Pinker argues {{from his}} own {{research}} that regular and irregular phenomena are products of computation and memory lookup, respectively, and that language {{can be understood as}} an interaction between the two. [...] "Words and Rules" [...] is also the title of an essay by Pinker outlining many of the topics discussed in the book. Critiqueing the book from the perspective of Generative linguistics Charles Yang, in the London Review of Books, writes that [...] "this book never runs low on hubris or hyperbole". The book's topic, the English past tense, is in Yang's view unglamorous, and Pinker's attempts at compromise risk being in no man's land between rival theories. Giving the example of German, Yang argues that irregular nouns in that language at least all belong to classes, governed by rules, and that things get even worse in languages that attach prefixes and suffixes to make up long 'words': they can't be learnt individually, as there are untold numbers of combinations. [...] "All Pinker (and the connectionists) <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> turning over the rocks {{at the base of the}} intellectual landslide caused by the Chomskian revolution." ...|$|E

2500|$|In May 1999, the [...] removed two books, {{one being}} Bless Me, Ultima, from teacher Carol Bennett’s English classes. The removal was {{proposed}} by board member Jerry Haroldsen based on complaints from parents of Benett's {{students about the}} violence and profanity within the book. Haroldsen articulated the reasoning for the board's action: “What we <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> {{trying to protect the}} children. And you got a teacher that’s trying to do what we do not think is right”. All copies of Bless Me, Ultima were pulled from the classes and placed in the principal’s office.|$|E

You're more confident about what you're doing and having some gravitas, but at the same time, because we're having more and more expectations put on us by everyone, the complexities are increasing.

Khan, however, was hesitant at first but agreed and worked upon {{the concept of the}} show for two years. In an interview with Zee News, he said, [...] "Initially I was scared to do the show as we were travelling on a different path. I was worried. It was in a way difficult, but we knew what we <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> different, but it comes straight from our heart." [...] He also added, [...] "I cannot say I understand TV completely.

2500|$|Rabbi Lamm {{told his}} {{listeners}} {{that they should}} value and encourage the efforts of non-Orthodox leaders to more seriously integrate traditional Jewish practices {{into the lives of}} their followers. They should welcome the creation of Reform and Conservative day schools and not see them as a threat to their own. In many communities, Orthodox day schools, or Orthodox-oriented community day schools, have large numbers of students from non-Orthodox families. The liberal movements should be appreciated and encouraged because they are doing something Jewish, even if it is not the way that Orthodox Jews would like them to, he said. [...] "What they <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> something, and something is better than nothing," [...] he said in his speech. [...] "I'm very openly attacking the notion that we sometimes find in the Orthodox community that 'being a goy is better'" [...] than being a non-Orthodox Jew, he said in an interview.|$|E

2500|$|Work at Ball Research brought Widlar {{in contact}} with Jean Hoerni and Sheldon Roberts, the creators of {{radiation}} hardened transistors and co-founders of Fairchild Semiconductor. Widlar {{decided to move to}} a semiconductor manufacturing company, and in 1963 Jerry Sanders, a Fairchild Semiconductor salesman, provided him the opportunity. According to Thomas Lee, Fairchild also wanted to have Widlar on board, and breached professional ethics by recruiting a key employee of their customer. In September 1963 Widlar was invited for an interview with Fairchild research and development (R) manager Heinz Ruegg. Widlar arrived at the interview intoxicated, and frankly told Ruegg what he thought about Fairchild's analog circuits: [...] "What they <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> bullshit". Widlar was sent to another interview with the company's Applications Engineering division, which was based in Mountain View, California. The division head, John Hulme, hired Widlar despite objections from the first round interviewers. Widlar's first assignment at Fairchild targeted IC reliability through adjustments in fabrication processes. This early work, directed by process engineer David Talbert, reduced the price of planar process and made possible development of monolithic (fully integrated) linear ICs. Widlar, who formally reported to John Barrett, proved himself capable of quickly improving Barrett's own designs and very soon squeezed his nominal boss out of the company.|$|E
2500|$|There are criticisms which {{contend that}} Paul's {{position}} is disingenuous because he often requests earmarks for bills that he supposedly knows will pass {{no matter which}} way he votes. [...] For example, during 2007, he requested about $400 million in earmarks in bills he voted against. A spokesman in the Fox News article says, [...] "Reducing earmarks does not reduce government spending, {{and it does not}} prohibit spending upon those things that are earmarked. What people who push earmark reform <b>are</b> <b>doing</b> <b>is</b> they are particularly misleading the public—and I have to presume it's not by accident." [...] One group supporting fiscal conservatism finds Paul's actions with earmarks to be contradictory and cites his 2003 speech regarding the award of a Congressional Gold Medal, at which time the Congressman declared, [...] "I will continue in my uncompromising opposition to appropriations not authorized within the enumerated powers of the Constitution;" [...] however, Paul himself has inserted appropriations for projects such as the renovation of a movie theater and subsidies for the shrimp industry, whereas reportedly, [...] "neither of which is envisioned in the Constitution as an essential government function". The Congressman has responded to criticism about earmarks by providing an explanation in his weekly column. Paul says, [...] "In an already flawed system, earmarks can at least allow residents of Congressional districts to have a greater role in allocating federal funds – their tax dollars – than if the money is allocated behind locked doors by bureaucrats." ...|$|E
