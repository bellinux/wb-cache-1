40|$|Due to high {{efficiency}} in helping breaking rocks, positive displacement motor has a widespread application {{in the field}} of oil and gas drilling engineering. However, service life of positive displacement motor becomes shorter resulting from failure of the <b>driving</b> <b>shaft</b> thread. The three-dimensional simulation model of <b>driving</b> <b>shaft’s</b> connecting thread has been developed based on the principle of virtual work, Von Mises yield criterion, and contact nonlinear theory. This article has put forward the plan to optimize structure of <b>driving</b> <b>shaft</b> with straight thread based on the design principle of double-shouldered thread; besides, fatigue life of <b>driving</b> <b>shaft</b> with straight thread before and after optimization has been assessed by resorting to the multiaxial fatigue principle and Brown–Miller critical plane rule. In line with research results, mechanical properties of <b>driving</b> <b>shaft</b> with straight thread are superior to those of <b>driving</b> <b>shaft</b> with taper thread. Under the load of axial drill pressure with fluctuation and alternating torque, fatigue life of <b>driving</b> <b>shaft</b> with straight thread after optimization is greatly improved. This article has not only provided basis for optimizing connecting thread of <b>driving</b> <b>shaft</b> but also boasts of high engineering value for improving service life of positive displacement motor...|$|R

40|$|A novel type of {{integral}} {{squeeze film}} damper (ISFD) is proposed to reduce and isolate vibration excitations of the gear system through bearing to the foundation. Four ISFD designs were tested experimentally with an open first-grade spur gear system. Vibration reduction characteristics were experimentally studied at different speeds for cases where ISFD elastic damping supports were simultaneously installed on the <b>driving</b> and driven <b>shafts,</b> installed on the driven shaft, or only installed on the <b>driving</b> <b>shaft.</b> Experimental {{results show that the}} ISFD elastic damping support can effectively reduce shock vibration of the gear system. Additionally, resonant modulation in gear shafts caused by meshing impact was significantly reduced. Different vibration amplitudes of gear shafts with ISFD installed only on driven or <b>driving</b> <b>shafts</b> were compared. Results indicated that vibration reduction is better when ISFD is only installed on the driven shaft than on the <b>driving</b> <b>shaft...</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{configuration}} {{known as}} a double Cardan joint drive shaft partially overcomes the problem of jerky rotation. This configuration uses two U-joints joined by an intermediate shaft, with the second U-joint phased {{in relation to the}} first U-joint to cancel the changing angular velocity. In this configuration, the angular velocity of the driven shaft will match that of the <b>driving</b> <b>shaft,</b> provided that both the <b>driving</b> <b>shaft</b> and the driven shaft are at equal angles with respect to the intermediate shaft (but not necessarily in the same plane) and that the two universal joints are 90 degrees out of phase.

5000|$|In a {{conventional}} steam locomotive, the crankshaft {{is one of}} the <b>driving</b> <b>axles.</b> In a jackshaft-driven steam locomotive, the crankshaft turns a jackshaft which, in turn, turns the driver.

While this plan placed more of the locomotive's weight on the <b>driving</b> <b>axle,</b> it reduced the weight on the leading truck which made it more prone to derailments.|$|R
