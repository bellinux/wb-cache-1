5|$|The Smith Gun {{was capable}} of firing both anti-personnel and {{anti-tank}} rounds (the latter capable of penetrating some 60mm of armour), and provided the Home Guard and local defence units with a potentially potent anti-personnel and <b>anti-armour</b> <b>weapon.</b> However, there were several flaws in its design, and as such it was not well liked {{by some of the}} Home Guard units to which it was issued. It was heavy and awkward to manhandle, particularly over rough ground and in urban areas; in the latter, it was recommended that toggle ropes be used to manoeuvre the weapon into position. The low muzzle velocity meant that shells were lobbed in a high curved trajectory, making precise range calculations and firing experience vital. This was difficult when so few rounds were available for training, a problem compounded by early batches possessing faulty fuzes that led to the Smith Gun's alleged 'terrifying reputation for killing its crew'. (This probably arises from the first fatal malfunction when, during a live-fire exercise in 1942, Corporal Maynard of 2819 Squadron, RAF Regiment was killed in an explosion.|$|E

25|$|The {{possible}} {{presence of}} a second RCL team sited in mutual support forced the cavalry to halt once again. Concerned {{about the consequences of}} bypassing an <b>anti-armour</b> <b>weapon</b> only to be engaged from the rear, Roberts ordered the troop to scan the area. Frustrated by the delay, Mollison demanded Roberts continue the advance, and an argument broke out between the two. However, as the commander of the APCs Roberts ignored Mollison despite his more senior rank, refusing to continue until he either located the weapon or was confident the threat did not exist. Finally, following a five-minute delay the Australians moved off again after no weapon was located. A machine-gun then engaged three of the APCs in the left hand section, none of which had gun shields. One of the crew commanders was fatally wounded and the vehicle forced to a halt, but not before the Viet Cong machine-gunner was crushed to death by the driver. The troop sergeant ran between the carriers under heavy fire to take command of the APC after Roberts ordered him to return to Nui Dat due to the mistaken belief some of the infantry on board had also been wounded. Despite Mollison's objections the vehicle departed, taking the headquarters of one of the infantry platoons with it. Still uncertain of the location of D Company, Roberts was forced to closely control the fire of the troop due to the concern any survivors might be hit by overshoots from the armoured vehicle's heavy machine-guns. At the same time the infantry continued to engage {{from the rear of the}} vehicles. A further 45 Viet Cong were estimated to have been killed during this action.|$|E

After the war it was passed on extensively to Soviet client states, and was used in the numerous Arab-Israeli conflicts. Despite being thoroughly outdated, it can still be encountered in many third world nations, mainly due to its reliability and low cost.|$|R

5|$|A Company {{attacked}} the ridgeline {{to the north}} of the road to Chonju just prior to dusk, this time without the support of the Sherman tanks. The Australians again came under heavy fire from the North Koreans, however they quickly overcame the defenders and the ridge was secured by 17:30. During the fighting for the northern position, three North Korean T-34 tanks dug-in on the ridgeline had been destroyed by the Australians at short range with new M20 3.5-inch bazookas, which now proved to be effective <b>anti-armour</b> <b>weapons</b> despite difficulties experienced in their use at Kujin several days before. During the day's fighting, a total of 11 T-34 tanks and two SU-76 self-propelled guns had been destroyed by the Australian infantry and American tanks, contrary to the reports of their destruction by USAF airstrikes earlier in the day. Expecting a counter-attack, Green then ordered B Company forward to occupy positions along the road in between the positions held by D and A Companies, while Battalion headquarters moved in behind B Company, with C Company held in reserve at the rear with Support Company.

5|$|By dawn of 26 August, {{advancing}} west {{along the}} coast with armoured support, the Japanese had reached the main position manned by troops from B Company, 61st Infantry Battalion, around KB Mission. The Japanese force moved through the jungle {{at the edge of}} the coastal track, and was headed by two light tanks. Although they lacked <b>anti-armour</b> <b>weapons,</b> the Australians were able to turn back the Japanese attack. At this stage, the Japanese suffered a serious setback when their base area was heavily attacked at daylight by RAAF Kittyhawks and a Hudson aircraft, along with B-25s, B-26s and B-17s from the US Fifth Air Force. As a result of the attack, a number of Japanese troops were killed, while a large quantity of supplies was destroyed, as were a number of the landing barges which were beached near the KB Mission. Aside from severely hampering the Japanese supply system, the destruction of the landing barges also prevented their use to outflank the Australian battalions. The Japanese did not have any air cover as the fighters based at Buna which were to patrol over Milne Bay were shot down by Allied fighters shortly after they took off and other aircraft based at Rabaul were forced to turn back due to bad weather.|$|R
50|$|Other {{examples}} {{became evident}} during the Vietnam War. The North Vietnamese and their allied forces in South Vietnam were equipped with {{two types of}} light <b>anti-armour</b> <b>weapons.</b> One was the 1950s era B-40, which was a Chinese manufactured version of the Russian RPG-2, {{and the other was}} the newer RPG-7. The RPG-2 had a shallow cone and the RPG-7 a deep cone. The B-40 had a maximum penetration against armour of approximately 150 mm while the RPG-7 penetration was more than double that of the B-40. But to the surprise of the North Vietnamese, the B-40, while not effective against heavy tanks, was far more effective than the RPG-7 in killing or wounding the occupants of light armoured vehicles, and in igniting the ammunition storage or the vehicle's fuel, including the more modern M113 APC which U.S. and South Vietnamese forces at that time operated in large numbers. In addition, the B-40 proved more effective than the RPG-7 against non-armoured targets, like the bunkers at fire base camps. There are many stories from U.S. Vietnam veterans of the enemy attacking or ambushing with the dreaded B-40. The U.S. Army also discovered that in combat, with rare exceptions, more than one hit by the M72 LAW rocket was required to disable or kill the North Vietnamese PT-76 light tank.|$|R
5000|$|The combat {{record of}} light <b>anti-armour</b> <b>weapons</b> was studied by the {{engineers}} at FFV {{working on a}} replacement for the Pansarskott m/68 in the late 1970s. The result was the AT4 with a HEAT warhead that had, as the early AT4 brochures stated, a [...] "special beyond-armour effect". The designers of the AT4's warhead intended that one hit would cause massive damage to both the occupants and {{the interior of the}} targeted vehicle. FFV has said very little about the design of the AT4's warhead, being willing only to describe its effects. Defense journalists and military experts have speculated on the warhead's design. A cutaway photo of the AT4's projectile gave clues. Instead of the standard cone shape liner used by other HEAT warheads, the AT4 has a unique trumpet-shaped liner. Trumpet-shaped liners are believed to be more effective in resisting the counter-blast of reactive armour tiles, that explode and disrupt the HEAT warhead's particle stream. There has been speculation that the liner in the AT4's HEAT warhead is constructed of a special aluminum alloy. Others have stated it is primarily a copper liner with a secondary liner of aluminum bonded {{to the back of the}} copper liner. Another clue to the effectiveness of the AT4 is the presence of a [...] "focus ring" [...] to concentrate the blast. All public statements to 1984 on the subject are speculative. Tests conducted by the U.S. Army on the AT4 confirmed that the claims made by FFV regarding the AT4's devastating post-penetration effect were substantially correct.|$|R

It was later redesigned for anti-aircraft use, because it showed excellent results as an AA gun, with a range of 3,000 meters horizontally and 2,000 meters vertically against low flying planes. It was used in the ZPU series of anti-aircraft guns. Its size and power also made it a useful light <b>anti-armour</b> <b>weapon</b> on the BTR series of vehicles and the BRDM-2 scout car.|$|E

40|$|The {{requirements}} of a modern guided weapon will be established based on the current and perceived threats {{at the time the}} design is commissioned. However the design of a modern guided weapon is a long and expensive process which can result in the weapon entering service only for the original threat to have changed or passed, inevitably inducing a capability gap. The defence budgets of the major military powers such as the UK and USA continue to shrink. As a result the emphasis of military research is being placed on adapting current legacy systems to bridge these capability gaps. One such gap is the requirement to be able to intercept small relocatable, highly manoeuvrable targets. It was demonstrated a number of years ago, that the performance of a legacy weapon against manoeuvering targets could be potentially increased by retrofitting a data link to the weapon. The data link allows commands to be sent to the weapon in flight. The commands will result in the weapon executing one or more manoeuvres which will change the shape of the trajectory. This has the potential to improve the performance of current Advanced <b>Anti-Armour</b> <b>Weapons</b> (AAAW) against manoeuvring targets. The issue which arises from data linking any weapon including an AAAW, is that the ability to shape the trajectory of the weapon will be limited due to the original design parameters of the non data linked system. Therefore in order to obtain the maximum performance increase, the trajectory shaping (retargetting) capability must be efficiently utilised over the duration of the weapon fly out. It was postulated in this thesis that this could be achieved using an integrated fire control system, which would seek to calculate an optimal shaped trajectory. The optimal trajectory should maximise the ability of the weapon to respond to target manoeuvres, thereby improving the probability of a successful intercept occurring. The potential effectiveness of an integrated fire control system was explored by considering the scenario of a generic data linked AAAW which is to intercept a small highly manoeuvrable surface vessel. A total of three integrated fire control systems were developed which calculated the optimal trajectory for different criteria. The first system optimised the weapon trajectory considering multiple predicted target trajectories. Each trajectory had an associated probability. For a given weapon trajectory, the seeker would be able to detect the target at one or more locations along certain predicted target trajectories. The sum of the probabilities associated with the detectable locations represented the total probability of intercept. The weapon trajectory was optimised by calculating the trajectory which achieved the maximum probability of intercept using simulated annealing and simple search optimisation algorithms. The second system optimised the weapon trajectory considering only the most probable trajectory (M. P. T) from a distribution of predicted target trajectories. Appropriate commands were calculated such that a location along this M. P. T trajectory was detectable at some instant in time. The third system presented in this thesis optimised the trajectory considering the maximum probability of intercept initially and then only the M. P. T trajectory later on in the engagement. The three integrated systems and a Fire and Forget system were tested against 80 random target trajectories. In each of the integrated fire control systems, the performance of the AAAW against manoeuvring targets was significantly improved when compared to the Fire and Forget results...|$|R
