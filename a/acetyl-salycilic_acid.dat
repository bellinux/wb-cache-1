40|$|Patients with {{inflammatory}} bowel disease have {{a higher}} risk of developing colorectal cancer. The main risk factors for colorectal cancer are not suitable targets for therapeutic intervention, and primary chemoprevention is an intriguing therapeutic option. The analogies between <b>acetyl-salycilic</b> <b>acid</b> and 5 -amino-salycilic acid, and the results obtained by using <b>acetyl-salycilic</b> <b>acid</b> as a chernopreventive agent in patients with sporadic colorectal cancer have prompted the study of potential chernopreventive effects of 5 -amino-salycilic acid in {{inflammatory bowel disease}}. The results of both epidemiological and experimental studies have shown that Iona-term 5 -amino-salycilic acid treatments appear to have a chemopreventive effect. The evidence for this effect is provided by retrospective and case-control studies whose results, however, do not reach the highest grades for evidence-based recommendations. Nevertheless, these results are supported by a series of experimental studies demonstrating the multiplicity of actions of 5 -amino-salycilic acid. Although data regarding the chernopreventive effect of 5 -amino-salycilic acid may not be rigorous enough to meet the criteria for the highest evidence-based medicine recommendations, we feel that the argument to wait until we have Grade A evidence is not necessarily rational in this case, because discontinuation of 5 -amino-salycilic acid treatment to perform a randomised controlled trial would be unethical secondary to their proven efficacy for maintenance treatment.
