5|$|The Round Church {{includes}} three sections: the wide atrium (or courtyard), the narthex and the cella (also naos or, {{due to its}} shape, rotunda), each serving as a premise to the other. The sections were not necessarily built at the same time, and it is generally accepted that a reconstruction of the church was carried out some time after its completion.
