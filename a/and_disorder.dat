40|$|Objective: The current {{analysed}} {{the prospective}} effect of bullying on body image shame <b>and</b> <b>disordered</b> eating symptomatology in adolescent girls. Method: The {{study was conducted}} with 290 adolescent girls, and involved three waves of data collection assessing over time victimization experiences, body image shame <b>and</b> <b>disordered</b> eating symptomatology. At the beginning of the study, the participants average age was 13. 73 years (SD = 0. 78). Latent growth models were used to fit the data to identify the effect of bullying on the outcomes. Path analysis examined the mediator effect of body image shame on the association between bullying <b>and</b> <b>disordered</b> eating. Results: Bullying had a significant effect on the initial status of both body image shame <b>and</b> <b>disordered</b> eating. Body image shame <b>and</b> <b>disordered</b> eating growth was stable over time. Body image shame significantly mediated the relationship between bullying <b>and</b> <b>disordered</b> eating symptomatology. Conclusions: Findings suggest that programmes aimed at preventing bullying and associated shame could decrease the risk of initially developing body image issues <b>and</b> <b>disordered</b> eating...|$|R

5|$|At {{the start}} of the story, Osiris rules Egypt, having {{inherited}} the kingship from his ancestors in a lineage stretching back to the creator of the world, Ra or Atum. His queen is Isis, who, along with Osiris and his murderer Set, is one of the children of the earth god Geb and the sky goddess Nut. Little information about the reign of Osiris appears in Egyptian sources; the focus is on his death and the events that follow. Osiris is connected with life-giving power, righteous kingship, and the rule of maat, the ideal natural order whose maintenance was a fundamental goal in ancient Egyptian culture. Set is closely associated with violence and chaos. Therefore, the slaying of Osiris symbolizes the struggle between order <b>and</b> <b>disorder,</b> and the disruption of life by death.|$|E
5|$|Parts of New Labour's {{political}} philosophy linked crime with social exclusion and pursued policies to encourage partnerships between social and police authorities to lower crime rates. Other areas of New Labour's policy maintained a traditional approach to crime; {{the prison population}} in 2005 rose to over 76,000, mostly owing to the increasing length of sentences. Following the September 11 attacks, the Labour government attempted to emphasise counter-terrorism measures. From 2002, the government followed policies aimed at reducing anti-social behaviour; in the 1998 Crime <b>and</b> <b>Disorder</b> Act, Labour introduced Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs).|$|E
5|$|The Osiris myth is {{the most}} {{elaborate}} and influential story in ancient Egyptian mythology. It concerns {{the murder of the}} god Osiris, a primeval king of Egypt, and its consequences. Osiris's murderer, his brother Set, usurps his throne. Meanwhile, Osiris's wife Isis restores her husband's body, allowing him to posthumously conceive a son with her. The remainder of the story focuses on Horus, the product of the union of Isis and Osiris, who is at first a vulnerable child protected by his mother and then becomes Set's rival for the throne. Their often violent conflict ends with Horus's triumph, which restores order to Egypt after Set's unrighteous reign and completes the process of Osiris's resurrection. The myth, with its complex symbolism, is integral to the Egyptian conceptions of kingship and succession, conflict between order <b>and</b> <b>disorder,</b> and especially death and the afterlife. It also expresses the essential character of each of the four deities at its center, and many elements of their worship in ancient Egyptian religion were derived from the myth.|$|E

5|$|The Smith Act trials {{decimated}} {{the leadership}} {{ranks of the}} CPUSA. Immediately after the 1949 trial, the CPUSAalarmed at the undercover informants that had testified for the prosecutioninitiated efforts to identify and exclude informers from its membership. The FBI encouraged these suspicions by planting fabricated evidence which suggested that many innocent Party members were FBI informants. Dennis attempted to provide leadership from inside the Atlanta penitentiary, but prison officials censored his mail and successfully isolated him from the outside world. Prison officials from the Lewisburg prison prevented Williamson from writing to anyone other than immediate family members. Lacking leadership, the CPUSA suffered from internal dissension <b>and</b> <b>disorder,</b> and by 1953 the CPUSA's leadership structure was inoperative. In 1956, Nikita Khrushchev revealed the reality of Stalin's purges, causing many remaining CPUSA members to quit in disillusionment. By the late 1950s, the CPUSA's membership had dwindled to 5,000, of whom over 1,000 may have been FBI informants.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the mediating and moderating roles of self-silencing between adult attachment (anxiety <b>and</b> avoidance) <b>and</b> <b>disordered</b> eating attitudes. Participants were 221 female college students from a large Midwestern university. Survey data was analyzed using hierarchical multiple regression and the bootstrap procedure for testing the significance of indirect effects. For the mediation, {{the results indicated that}} self-silencing fully mediated the relation between attachment avoidance <b>and</b> <b>disordered</b> eating attitudes. Moreover, self-silencing partially mediated the relation between attachment anxiety <b>and</b> <b>disordered</b> eating attitudes. Specifically, the results showed significant positive relations between adult attachment (anxiety and avoidance) and self-silencing as well as self-silencing <b>and</b> <b>disordered</b> eating attitudes. The direct association between attachment anxiety <b>and</b> <b>disordered</b> eating attitudes was also positive over and beyond the indirect effect through self-silencing. Conversely, the findings did not support self-silencing as a moderator between attachment (anxiety <b>and</b> avoidance) <b>and</b> <b>disordered</b> eating attitudes.;The significant mediation effects suggest that it is not only important to consider attachment anxiety and avoidance in understanding <b>and</b> treating <b>disordered</b> eating attitudes, but also that self-silencing plays a significant role in this association. In other words, the results imply counseling psychologists could work with women with attachment anxiety and avoidance to reduce their disordered eating attitudes by helping them recognize how their self-silencing in relationships contributes to these attitudes. Finally, limitations, future research, and detailed counseling implications are presented...|$|R

40|$|Research {{results from}} large, {{national}} population-based studies investigating {{gender differences in}} weight dissatisfaction <b>and</b> <b>disordered</b> eating across the adult life span are still limited. Gender is {{a significant factor in}} relation to weight dissatisfaction <b>and</b> <b>disordered</b> eating. However, the reasons for gender differences in these conditions are still poorly understood. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine gender differences in weight dissatisfaction <b>and</b> <b>disordered</b> eating in the general Swiss adult population and to identify gender-specific risk factors. METHODS: The study population consisted of 18156 Swiss adults who completed the population-based Swiss Health Survey 2007. Self-reported weight dissatisfaction, <b>disordered</b> eating <b>and</b> associated risk factors were assessed. In order to examine whether determinants of weight dissatisfaction <b>and</b> <b>disordered</b> eating (dieting to lose weight, binge eating, and irregular eating) differ in men and women, multivariate logistic regressions were applied separately for women and men. RESULTS: Although more men than women were overweight, more women than men reported weight dissatisfaction. Weight category, smoking status, education, and physical activity were significantly associated with weight dissatisfaction in men and women. In women, nationality and age were also significant factors. Gender-specific risk factors such as physical activity or weight category were identified for specific disordered eating behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that gender specific associations between predictors <b>and</b> <b>disordered</b> eating behaviour should be considered in the development of effective prevention programs against disordered eating.
