5000|$|Rhyzopertha is a {{monotypic}} genus of beetles in {{the family}} Bostrichidae, the false powderpost beetles. The sole species, Rhyzopertha dominica, is known commonly as the lesser grain borer, American wheat weevil, <b>Australian</b> <b>wheat</b> <b>weevil,</b> and stored grain borer. It is a beetle found nearly worldwide as a pest of stored cereal grains. It is also a major pest of peanuts.|$|E
50|$|<b>Wheat</b> <b>weevils</b> are a pest of wheat, oats, rye, barley, {{rice and}} corn. <b>Wheat</b> <b>weevils</b> cause an unknown {{amount of damage}} {{worldwide}} because keeping track of so much information is difficult, especially in places where the grain harvests are not measured. They are hard to detect and usually all of the grain in an infested storage facility must be destroyed. Many methods attempt {{to get rid of}} the <b>wheat</b> <b>weevil,</b> such as pesticides, different methods of masking the odour of the grain with unpleasant scents, and introducing other organisms that are predators of the weevils.|$|R

50|$|Adult <b>wheat</b> <b>weevils</b> {{are about}} 3 - 5 mm long with {{elongated}} snouts and chewing mouthparts. Depending on the grain kernels, {{the size of}} the wevil varies. In small grains, such as millet or grain sorghum, they are small in size, but are larger in maize (corn). The adults are a reddish-brown colour and lack distinguishing marks. Adult <b>wheat</b> <b>weevils</b> are not capable of flight. Larvae are legless, humpbacked, and are white with a tan head. Weevils in the pupal stage have snouts like the adults.|$|R

50|$|Sitophilus is a genus of weevils. Some {{species are}} {{familiar}} as pests of stored food products. Notable species include the rice <b>weevil</b> (S. oryzae), <b>wheat</b> <b>weevil</b> (S. granarius), and maize weevil (S. zeamais).|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} insect pests infest stored dry {{foods such as}} flour, cereals and pasta; these include the Indian mealmoth, the {{cigarette}} beetle, the drugstore beetle, the confused flour beetle, the red flour beetle, the merchant grain beetle, the sawtoothed grain beetle, the <b>wheat</b> <b>weevil,</b> the maize weevil and the rice weevil.|$|R

50|$|Many weevils are {{considered}} pests {{because of their}} ability to damage and kill crops, but others are used for biological control of invasive plants. The grain or <b>wheat</b> <b>weevil</b> (Sitophilus granarius) damages stored grain. The boll weevil (Anthonomus grandis) attacks cotton crops. It lays its eggs inside cotton bolls, and the larvae eat their way out.|$|R
50|$|The <b>wheat</b> <b>weevil</b> (Sitophilus granarius), {{also known}} as the grain weevil or granary weevil, occurs {{all over the world and}} is a common pest in many places. It can cause {{significant}} damage to harvested stored grains and may drastically decrease crop yields. The females lay many eggs and the larvae eat the inside of the grain kernels.|$|R
50|$|The Wheat Export Authority (WEA) was {{established}} 1 July 1999 {{as part of}} restructuring the former government-owned <b>Australian</b> <b>Wheat</b> Board in preparation for its sale as AWB Limited. It was felt {{that a number of}} the tasks carried out by the previous <b>Australian</b> <b>Wheat</b> Board would not be appropriate for a privately owned body; thus, the WEA {{was established}}. The WEA's role was determined by the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 and its operations were funded by a charge on <b>Australian</b> <b>wheat</b> exports.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Australian</b> <b>Wheat</b> Board was a {{statutory}} authority established in 1939. AWB Limited was {{the company that}} resulted from its privatisation in 1999. The kick-backs scandal engulfed both bodies. The <b>Australian</b> <b>Wheat</b> Board and AWB Limited enjoyed a monopoly over the sale of <b>Australian</b> <b>wheat</b> exports. It achieved this {{through the use of}} a monopsony (single buyer) regime within Australia, where wheat growers were only able to sell on their wheat to a single desk. This was intended to prevent farmers under-cutting each other on price, and thus assure the highest price for <b>Australian</b> <b>wheat.</b> The AWB had sold wheat to Iraq since 1948, and was the single largest supplier of humanitarian goods to the nation during the Oil-for-Food Program.|$|R
50|$|Commonwealth Government {{introduces}} the Wheat Industry Fund Levy Act 1989 (WIF), a compulsory levy {{on the value}} of the wheat. The WIF’s purpose was to release the government from directly guaranteeing the <b>Australian</b> <b>Wheat</b> Board’s loans and allow the <b>Australian</b> <b>Wheat</b> Board to finance its own commercial borrowing arrangements.|$|R

30|$|Australia {{is one of}} the world’s key {{exporters}} {{of wheat}} although it only comprises slightly above 5  % of the global wheat area cultivation. Some studies indicate that the <b>Australian</b> <b>wheat</b> harvest failure contributed to the 2007 – 2008 price spikes (Trostle 2008; von Braun and Tadesse, 2012). The Australian global share of land acreage allocated for soybeans and corn is relatively small, and that of rice is negligible. Consequently, we estimate a model for <b>Australian</b> <b>wheat</b> acreage only. We obtain planted wheat acreage data from the Australian Government Department of Agriculture and <b>Australian</b> <b>wheat</b> prices from the Economic Research Service (ERS) of the USDA.|$|R

40|$|Microsatellite markers {{have been}} shown to be highly {{polymorphic}} and simple to use in hexaploid wheat. This study aimed to establish microsatellites as informative markers for <b>Australian</b> <b>wheat</b> improvement. By screening microsatellites developed as part of the Wheat Microsatellite Consortium and other available microsatellite sources, 257 informative microsatellites for <b>Australian</b> <b>wheat</b> varieties were identified and reported in the <b>Australian</b> National <b>Wheat</b> Molecular Marker Program microsatellite database ([URL] Of these, 151 microsatellites identifying 172 loci were scored on at least 1 of 4 double haploid mapping populations and were then integrated, where possible, into existing genetic maps. Polymorphism information content values were calculated for most microsatellites to establish a reference for their value for future investigations. The mapping of available microsatellites enhances the quality of the genetic maps and may provide useful genetic markers for traits of interest to the <b>Australian</b> <b>wheat</b> breeding programs...|$|R

40|$|<b>Australian</b> <b>wheat</b> is at {{the risk}} of insects such as Russian wheat aphid (RWA), and Sunn pest that are not yet in Australia. These insects are most {{damaging}} pests of cereals. Their incursion to Australia is expected to cause substantial yield loses because current <b>Australian</b> <b>wheat</b> varieties are highly susceptible to these insects. The objectives: 1) Identify wheat germplasm from around the world that are resistant to Russian wheat aphid and Sunn pest, 2) develop genomic tools for marker - assisted breeding, an d 3) introgress multiple resistance genes into <b>Australian</b> <b>wheat</b> cultivars. Over 80 lines from various parts of the world were evaluated against RWA biotypes from USA, Mexico, Hungary, France, Chile and Iran. Wheat lines with moderate to good levels of resistance were identified. Resistance genes from various sources were mapped on chromosomes 1 DS and 7 DS of wheat. Closely linked SSR and DArT markers have been identified. Sunn pest screening work was conducted in Turkey and included lines from ICARDA and l and races from Turkey. Backcross breeding of multiple RWA resistance genes to Wyalkatchem, EGA Gregory and Correll wheat cultivars were completed to BC 4 to BC 5 stages.

50|$|A {{report by}} UN {{investigator}} Paul Volcker released in October 2005 {{found that the}} <b>Australian</b> <b>Wheat</b> Board, later AWB Limited, was the biggest single source of kickbacks for the Iraqi government. In exchange for trouble-free disembarkation of wheat purchased under the Oil-for-Food Programme, the <b>Australian</b> <b>Wheat</b> Board paid 'trucking charges' totalling A$300 million to Alia. Alia is a real Jordanian trucking company, but one with {{no role in the}} distribution of <b>Australian</b> <b>wheat</b> in Iraq. Alia kept a small percentage of 'charges', and passed the remainder on to Saddam's government. The AWB was fully compensated for the charges by increases in the price paid; the payments were approved by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Australian Government commissioned judge Terence Cole to further investigate whether Australian companies had indeed paid kickbacks to the Saddam regime.

50|$|Adult <b>wheat</b> <b>weevils</b> when {{threatened}} or disturbed will pull their legs {{close to their}} bodies and feign death. Female weevils can tell if a grain kernel has had an egg laid in it by another weevil. They avoid laying another egg in this grain. Females chew a hole, deposit an egg, and seal the hole with a gelatinous secretion. This may be how other females know the grain has an egg in it already. This ensures the young will survive and produce another generation. One pair of weevils may produce up to 6,000 offspring per year.|$|R
