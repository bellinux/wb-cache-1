40|$|International audienceThe {{watershed}} transform is {{a powerful}} tool for morphological segmentation. Most common implementations of this method involve a strict hierarchy on gray tones in processing the pixels composing an image. Those dependencies complexify the efficient use of modern computational architectures. This paper aims at answering this problem by introducing a new way of simulating the waterflood that preserves the locality of data to be processed. We propose a region growth algorithm based on <b>arrowing</b> <b>graphs</b> that is strictly linear despite the valuation domain of input images. Simultaneous and disorderly growth is made possible by using a synchronization mechanism coded directly on the weight of nodes. Experimental results show that the algorithm is accurate and by far outperforms common watershed algorithms...|$|R

We construct an <b>arrow</b> ribbon <b>graph</b> from a virtual link whose extended Bollobás-Riordan polynomial specializes to the arrow polynomial of the virtual link recently introduced by H.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this note is to develop further Gauss {{diagrams}} approach to nite type link invariants. In this context we introduce Gauss diagrams counterparts to chord diagrams, 4 T relation and weight systems arising from Lie algebras. The counterparts, respectively, are arrow diagrams, 6 T relation and weights arising from the classical Yang-Baxter equation. An algebra of acyclic <b>arrow</b> <b>graphs</b> is also introduced and its isomorphism to the algebra ~ Am of arrow diagrams is veried. An appropriate link-homotopy version ~ A h m of the algebra ~ Am is considered. Using this algebra, we construct Gauss diagram invariants of string links up to link-homotopy, with values both in the algebra ~ A h m and in R. We observe that this construction gives the "universal" Milnor's link-homotopy -invariants. 1. Introduction 1. 1. The motivation: Gauss diagram formulas.

The intersection graph M(i) of a generic surface i:F → S^ 3 is the set of values which are either singularities or intersections. It is a multigraph whose edges are transverse intersections of two surfaces and whose vertices are triple intersections and cross-caps. M(i) has an additional structure which Li called "a daisy graph. " If F is oriented then the orientation further refines M(i) 's structure into what Li called an "arrowed daisy graph. " Li left the {{open question}} "which <b>arrowed</b> daisy <b>graphs</b> can be realized as the intersection graph of an oriented generic surface?" The main theorem of this article will answer this.

40|$|Recently the New Math {{phenomenon}} was {{the subject}} of many studies (see, e. g., Barbin, 2012; Kilpatrick 2012), dealing with various aspects of the reform. Belgium was, as well as France and the US, one of the forerunning and leading countries in this international movement. A pivotal role was played by the Belgian mathematician and mathematics educator Georges Papy, but so far, his role remained underexposed in the recent literature on the history of mathematics education. In this paper we analyse Papy’s Mathématique moderne (in collaboration with Frédérique Lenger), a groundbreaking textbook series, based on several years of experimentation and intended for the teaching of modern mathematics to 12 - 18 -year olds (Papy, 1963 - 1967). The first volume of Papy’s Mathématique moderne was published in 1963 and marked a revolution in the teaching of mathematics and in the art of textbook design. Papy reshaped the whole content of secondary school mathematics by basing it upon the unifying themes of sets, relations and algebraic structures. Meanwhile, he proposed an innovative pedagogy using multi-colored <b>arrow</b> <b>graphs,</b> playful drawings and “visual proofs” by means of drawings of film strips. During the 1960 s, translations of the volumes of Mathématique moderne appeared in European and non-European languages and were reviewed in mathematics education journals of that time. Papy’s textbook series influenced the national and international debates and became a major guide for shaping the New Math reform in several countries. We first review the different volumes of this series to gain insight in Papy’s viewpoints as revealed though this work. Of particular interest is Papy’s approach to geometry. In the first three volumes (for 12 - to 15 -year olds) Papy builds up a Euclidean vector plane structure from “intuitive” (synthetic) axioms. This must prepare these students for a second step at the age of 15 - 16 which is described as a psychological reversal: the structure of a Euclidean vector plane then is taken as a new and “unique” starting axiom for the further development of geometry. Second, we examine the role of Papy and his Mathématique moderne in the international New Math reform movement of the 1960 s. So, for example, Papy’s approach played a reconciling role in the dispute between Gustave Choquet and Jean Dieudonné about the ideal way to teach geometry at the secondary level (Félix, 1985). We conclude with a brief discussion of the contribution of Papy’s textbooks on the national reform debates in France and the Netherlands. References Barbin, E. (2012).

40|$|Automata {{are defined}} as four-termed {{relations}} (sets of quadruples). Reduced autom-ata, that is, automata in which the states serve as output symbols, {{are defined as}} three-termed relations (sets of triples). A method is given for replacing the nodes and <b>arrows</b> in the <b>graphs</b> of such relations by neurons or by other logical elements {{in such a way}} that the resulting net realizes the corresponding automaton. This method is applicable whether or not the relation corresponds to a single-valued function; that is, whether or not the next state of the automaton is uniquely determined by the present state and input symbol. Kleene's theory of the representation of events (sets of input words) by finite automata is presented in a simplified and strengthened form largely due to Medvedev, Nerode, and Rabin and Scott. It is also proved that a set which does not contain the &quot;word &quot; of length zero is representable by a reduced finite automaton if and only if it is representable by a nonreduced finite automaton. _ _ 1 1...|$|R

5000|$|When {{experimental}} {{interventions are}} infeasible or illegal, the derivation of cause effect relationship from observational studies must rest on some qualitative theoretical assumptions, for example, that symptoms do not cause diseases, usually {{expressed in the}} form of missing <b>arrows</b> in causal <b>graphs</b> such as Bayesian networks or path diagrams. The theory underlying these derivations relies on the distinction between conditional probabilities, as in , and interventional probabilities, as in [...] The former reads: [...] "the probability of finding cancer in a person known to smoke, having started, unforced by the experimenter, to do so at an unspecified time in the past", while the latter reads: [...] "the probability of finding cancer in a person forced by the experimenter to smoke at a specified time in the past". The former is a statistical notion that can be estimated by observation with negligible intervention by the experimenter, while the latter is a causal notion which is estimated in an experiment with an important controlled randomized intervention. It is specifically characteristic of quantal phenomena that observations defined by incompatible variables always involve important intervention by the experimenter, as described quantitatively by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. In classical thermodynamics, processes are initiated by interventions called thermodynamic operations. In other branches of science, for example astronomy, the experimenter can often observe with negligible intervention.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We prove a {{conjecture}} of Nakajima {{describing the}} relation between the geometry of quiver varieties of type A and the geometry of the partial flags varieties and of the nilpotent variety. The kind of quiver varieties we are interested in, have been introduced by Nakajima as a generalization of the description of the moduli space of anti-self-dual connections on ALE spaces constructed by Kroneheimer and Nakajima [3]. They result to have a rich and interesting geometry and they were used by Nakajima to give a geometric construction of the representations of Kac-Moody algebras [5], [6]. A similar construction had already been done in the case of sln by Ginzburg [1] using partial flags varieties. A precise conjecture of Nakajima ([5] or theorem 12 below) describes {{the relation between}} the two kind of varieties. I want to thank Corrado De Concini who explained me quiver varieties and pointed out to me this problem and Hiraku Nakajima who pointed out an error in a previous version of this paper and the solution to it. 1. Nakajima’s conjecture We recall some definition and fix some notation on quiver varieties of type An− 1 and on partial flags varieties. 1. 1. Quiver varieties of type An− 1. Let C = 2 I − A be the Cartan matrix of type An− 1 and consider the “double ” graph of type An− 1. We will call the vertices and the <b>arrows</b> of this <b>graph</b> according to the following diagram: ar 1 1 ar 1 ar 2 � 2 ar 2 arn− 2 n − 2 � n − 1. (1) arn− 2 In particular I = { 1, [...] ., n− 1 } is the set of vertices, Ω = {ar 1, [...] ., arn− 2 }, Ω = {ar 1, [...] .,arn− 2 } and H = Ω ∪ Ω is the set of arrows. We observe that given i, j ∈ I we have that aij = card{h ∈ Ω joining i and j}. Finally if h is an arrow we call h 0 its source of h and h 1 its target. Notation 1.
