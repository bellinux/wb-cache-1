40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper was to present the results of a special <b>abrasion</b> <b>test</b> of poly(vinyl chloride) and {{polypropylene}} filled with calcium carbonate pipes. <b>Abrasion</b> <b>test’s</b> results for pipes were compared with results of standard <b>abrasion</b> <b>test</b> (Taber method) and hardness test. Design/methodology/approach: Short cuts of pipe were subjected to erosion caused by erodent, usually a mixture of special kind of sand and water. The changes of pipe’s wall thickness was a measure of resistance to erosion. Additionally abrasion resistance was measured using Taber method and ball-hardness was measured using Brinell apparatus. Findings: Calcium carbonate filled polypropylene exhibited lower resistance to abrasion than hard poly(vinyl chloride). Probably it is the result of filler presence in polypropylene. No correlation between hardness and abrasion resistance was found. Research limitations/implications: Applied method may be used to compare different pipe’s materials but its results may not be applied to other plastics products and to other abrasion conditions. Practical implications: <b>Abrasion</b> <b>test</b> used in the research may be applied to compare different materials and different pipelines components. Achieved results showed that calcium carbonate without surface preparation decrease abrasion resistance of polypropylene. Originality/value: Applied method is rarely used for polymer materials testing. Results of presented research may be interesting for pipe manufactures and polymer pipe’s formulations producers...|$|R

The dry sand-rubber wheel <b>abrasion</b> <b>test</b> (DSRW test) is an approved ASTM test designed primarily for testing metals, therefore, in this study the set of test conditions was optimized for use with polyurethane elastomers.

Polyurethane elastomers can be separated into three classes according to their hardness and wear performance, and each class shows a different dependence on the specimen temperature.

40|$|Nanotechnology {{processes}} are present into the textile field. One {{of these processes}} involves encapsulated nanoparticles or nanoproducts, know as microcapsules. Microencapsulation technology is used into textiles to confer new properties and added value. There {{are a lot of}} different active core microcapsules used in the textile industry such as durable fragrances, skin softeners, insect repellents, dyes, vitamins, antimicrobials, phase change materials, etc. The effect of microcapsules is usually measured by the presence of a property such as odour measurements when flavors are encapsulated. Neverthless, some properties such as hydration, antibacterial, insect repellents, etc., can´t be tested without analytical methods. Microcapsulated products can be applied on fabrics by impregnation, bath exhaustion, foam, spraying and coating. The most extended industrial application is by padding. Microcapsules useful life can be affected by fabrics testing and maintenance to which they are subjected during their lifetime.

40|$|The {{current study}} mainly {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} different tests on the abrasion resistance of concrete mixed with steel fibers and silica fume. The abrasion resistance was assessed at 28, 56 and 91 days on concretes with water-binder ratios of 0. 35 and 0. 55 where in some mixes silica fume was substituted by 5 % of cement by weight. Steel fibers of 0. 5 % and 1. 0 % of concrete volume were also added into the test concrete by replacement of coarse and fine aggregates. The results showed that concrete with higher compressive strength in Los Angeles abrasion tests also had better abrasion resistance. The inclusion of steel fibers into test concrete with a water-binder ratio of 0. 35 resulted in {{a significant increase in}} compressive strength. This concrete also displayed better abrasion resistance and splitting tensile strength than reference concrete; in the test sample with a water-binder ratio of 0. 55, the added steel fibers was unable to effectively produce cementation with the concrete. The inclusion of silica fume improved the abrasion resistance of concretes. In water <b>abrasion</b> <b>testing,</b> the abrasion resistance of concrete containing steel fiber was worse than that of concrete without steel fibers. In the water <b>abrasion</b> <b>testing,</b> the surface of steel fiber reinforced concrete was eroded by water and steel balls, and the impact caused the steel fibers to separate from the concrete and led to higher wear loss.

40|$|Humans {{have been}} {{climbing}} {{for thousands of}} years for survival, with the first development of special mechanical tools appearing in the 15 thÂ century. Advancement in this field came to a stand still until the mid- 19 thÂ century when materials and technology advanced enough to become useful. Safety was vastly improved by the transition from natural to synthetic fibers, the increased knowledge of metallurgy, and implementation of standardization for all climbing gear. All standards from the European Committee for Standardization and the International Climbing and Mountaineering Federation are based upon research of the human body and subsequent survivable loading magnitudes. Safety system component design requirements are therefore all dependently defined. Â Per capita, climbing accidents have drastically decreased due to these advancements. While virtually all standards have existed at least in part since the 1960 s, no standards are in place for abrasion resistance in dynamic kernmantle rope. As a central component of climbing safety, the aforementioned component dependency raises concern for totally system reliability. Most climbing accidents have been linked to poor education, fatigue failure, and catastrophic rope abrasion {{for the better part of}} a century. Better rope design and <b>abrasion</b> <b>testing</b> standards could greatly reduce the number of incidents. In an effort to understand why no such standards exist and to quantify the possible impact in system design, this paper details the history of technological advancement for all system components and further comments on the shortcomings of current <b>abrasion</b> <b>testing</b> measures.

40|$|ABSTRACT：A {{new piece}} of test equipment, the slurry wear tester (SWT), was {{proposed}} in this study to evaluate the wear behavior of rubber vulcanizate in environmental contact with slurry. Natural rubber (NR) and chloroprene rubber (CR) were chosen as the basic matrices to test the slurry wear. The fluids used to fill the chamber of the SWT were 35 % HCl and NaCl solution. The Akron <b>abrasion</b> <b>test</b> was used for comparison with SWT. According {{to the results of}} the Akron <b>abrasion</b> <b>test,</b> CR vulcanizate abraded more rapidly than NR vulcanizate under same test condition. It was found that the hysteresis of rubber was key factor contribute to the wear behavior. However, the slurry wear rate of the NR and CR vulcanizates did not change significantly, even with changes in the concentration of acid and the immersion time in both HCl and NaCl solutions; the fluid decreased the friction between the abrasive paper and the specimen. It also reduced the heat generated from repeated deformation and wear debris at the surface of the SWT's abrasion arm. Thus, these phenomena affected the wear behavior of rubber vulcanizate and caused different results in the conventional Akron <b>abrasion</b> <b>test.</b> This outcome could have resulted in an incorrect analysis if the slurry wear behavior of the rubber vulcanizat...|$|R
