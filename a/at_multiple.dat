5|$|Due to {{the lack}} of their own ground, F.C. United played their home matches <b>at</b> <b>multiple</b> stadia around Greater Manchester between 2005 and 2015, {{including}} Bury's Gigg Lane, Curzon Ashton's Tameside Stadium and Stalybridge Celtic's Bower Fold, among others. The club moved into its own 4,400-capacity Broadhurst Park in north-east Manchester for the 2015–16 season.|$|E
5|$|Intramural sport {{leagues and}} tournaments {{have a high}} level of {{participation}} at McMaster. Opportunities are offered <b>at</b> <b>multiple</b> skill levels and across a variety of sports to service a range of interest and ability. Sports offered include traditional sports like volleyball, basketball, soccer and cricket, as well as less traditional events like dodgeball, inner tube water polo, and extreme potato sack racing.|$|E
5|$|Stevens {{recorded}} and produced the album <b>at</b> <b>multiple</b> venues in New York City using low-fidelity studio equipment {{and a variety}} of instruments between late 2004 and early 2005. The artwork and lyrics explore the history, culture, art, and geography of the state—Stevens developed them after analyzing criminal, literary, and historical documents. Following its release, Stevens promoted Illinois with a world tour.|$|E

5|$|To develop {{resistance}} to RNAi, the {{western corn rootworm}} would {{have to change the}} genetic sequence of its Snf7 gene <b>at</b> <b>multiple</b> sites. Combining multiple strategies, such as engineering the protein Cry, derived from a bacterium called Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), and RNAi in one plant delay the onset of resistance.|$|E
5|$|A common {{source of}} data for {{archaeoastronomy}} {{is the study of}} alignments. This {{is based on the assumption}} that the axis of alignment of an archaeological site is meaningfully oriented towards an astronomical target. Brown archaeoastronomers may justify this assumption through reading historical or ethnographic sources, while Green archaeoastronomers tend to prove that alignments are unlikely to be selected by chance, usually by demonstrating common patterns of alignment <b>at</b> <b>multiple</b> sites.|$|E

The two main themes were well received by both video game and music critics, and did well on Japan's Oricon Weekly Singles chart.|$|E
5|$|Another feature {{introduced}} in Banjo-Tooie is the direct connections between its worlds. In Banjo-Kazooie the titular duo would be transported to each level via special doors in Gruntilda's lair, but in Banjo-Tooie the levels are physically connected <b>at</b> <b>multiple</b> points and are effectively {{extensions of the}} Isle o' Hags hub world. In addition, the train Chuffy {{can be used to}} migrate minor characters between worlds which contain stations. The game also includes a multiplayer mode where up to four players can play each of the game's single-player minigames in customisable competitions.|$|E
5|$|Another {{report by}} the UN was {{released}} in October 2011. Interviews with 379 detainees at 47 facilities over the period of a year found “a compelling pattern and practice of systematic torture and ill-treatment” <b>at</b> <b>multiple</b> facilities operated by the ANP and NDS, after 46% of the detainees it spoke with indicated it occurred. A written statement by the Afghan government denied the 'systematic' nature of torture and claimed the report was exaggerated, although it admitted to deficiencies {{due to a lack}} of training and resources. The report also suggested that detainees handed over by the CF received different treatment, with one case citing a man who stated everyone was treated badly unless they were handled by Canadians.|$|E

5|$|Because Poe {{was found}} on the day of an election, it was {{suggested}} as early as 1872 that he was the victim of cooping. This was a ballot-box-stuffing scam in which victims were shanghaied, drugged, and used as a pawn to vote for a political party <b>at</b> <b>multiple</b> locations. Cooping had become the standard explanation for Poe's death in most of his biographies for several decades, though his status in Baltimore may have made him too recognizable for this scam to have worked. More recently, analysis suggesting that Poe's death resulted from rabies has been presented.|$|E

5|$|Ice had to {{be stored}} <b>at</b> <b>multiple</b> points between {{harvesting}} and its final use by a customer. One method for doing this was the construction of ice houses to hold the product, typically either shortly after the ice was first harvested or at regional depots after it had been shipped out. Early ice houses were relatively small, but later storage facilities were the size of large warehouses and contained much larger quantities of ice.|$|E

5|$|Natural {{selection}} can act {{at different}} levels of organisation, such as genes, cells, individual organisms, groups of organisms and species. Selection can act <b>at</b> <b>multiple</b> levels simultaneously. An example of selection occurring below the level of the individual organism are genes called transposons, which can replicate and spread throughout a genome. Selection at a level above the individual, such as group selection, may allow the evolution of cooperation, as discussed below.|$|E
5|$|Spacewar! is a space combat {{video game}} {{developed}} in 1962 by Steve Russell, {{in collaboration with}} Martin Graetz and Wayne Wiitanen, and programmed by Russell with assistance from others including Bob Saunders and Steve Piner. It was written for the newly installed DEC PDP-1 at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. After its initial creation, Spacewar was expanded further by other students and employees of universities in the area, including Dan Edwards and Peter Samson. It was also spread {{to many of the}} few dozen, primarily academic, installations of the PDP-1 computer, making Spacewar the first known video game to be played <b>at</b> <b>multiple</b> computer installations.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 Claxton Shield was contested {{between five}} teams from around Australia. In {{previous}} years, {{many of the}} teams had played their home games <b>at</b> <b>multiple</b> venues. This season each team held their home games at only one venue. There was one scheduled exception to this {{at the start of}} the season: the New South Wales Patriots' final home series against the Perth Heat was held at Gilchrist Oval, whereas all of their other home games were held at Blacktown Baseball Stadium.|$|E
40|$|Sound {{measurements}} are reported for a wind velocity of about 5 m/s and a power output of about 70 kW. Both broadband and narrowband {{data were obtained}} {{for a range of}} distances and azimuth angles from the machine. Both discrete frequency and broadband components were identified. Loading harmonics <b>at</b> <b>multiples</b> of the blade passage frequency and electrical generator harmonics <b>at</b> <b>multiples</b> of the shaft speed dominated the spectrum below 100 Hz. The 10, 000 Hz peak is believed to be of mechanical origin in the nacelle and the other arises from blade aerodynamic sources. Aural detection distances of about 525 m upwind and 850 downwind were observed...|$|R

40|$|The {{conductance}} of ballistic point {{contacts in}} high-mobility Si-inversion layers {{has been studied}} at several temperatures between 75 and 600 mK both without and in a magnetic field (up to 12 T).

The only other player to win Gold Gloves <b>at</b> <b>multiple</b> {{positions}} is Plácido Polanco, who won at second base (2007, 2009 AL) and third base (2011 NL). Family pairs to win Gold Gloves include brothers Ken and Clete Boyer (third base), brothers Sandy Alomar, Jr. (catcher) and Roberto Alomar (second base), Bengie and Yadier Molina (catcher), father and son Bobby and Barry Bonds (outfield), and father and son Bob (catcher) and Bret Boone (second base).|$|E
5|$|The {{twentieth century}} saw {{increasingly}} rapid {{advances in the}} scientific study of stars. The photograph became a valuable astronomical tool. Karl Schwarzschild discovered that the color of a star and, hence, its temperature, could be determined by comparing the visual magnitude against the photographic magnitude. The development of the photoelectric photometer allowed precise measurements of magnitude <b>at</b> <b>multiple</b> wavelength intervals. In 1921 Albert A. Michelson made the first measurements of a stellar diameter using an interferometer on the Hooker telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory.|$|E

The higher-pitched ranks of the Blockwerk remained grouped together under a single stop control; these stops developed into mixtures.|$|E
