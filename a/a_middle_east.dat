5|$|Kidnappers violently {{take the}} Secret Service chief M {{from his house}} and almost capture James Bond, who is visiting. Intent on rescuing M, Bond follows the clues to Vrakonisi, one of the Aegean Islands. In the process, Bond discovers the complex military-political plans of Colonel Sun of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Sun {{had been sent to}} {{sabotage}} <b>a</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> détente conference which the Soviet Union is hosting. He intends to attack the conference venue and use M and Bond's bodies to blame Great Britain for the disaster, leading to a world war. Bond meets Soviet agents in Athens and they realise that not only is a third country behind the kidnap, but that there is a traitor in the organisation. An attack on the Soviet headquarters kills all the agents except Ariadne Alexandrou, a Greek Communist. As he is dying, the Soviet leader encourages Bond and Ariadne to work together to prevent an international incident.|$|E

500|$|NATO {{launched}} a Training Cooperation Initiative offering to share NATO training expertise with its Mediterranean Dialogue (MD) countries (Mauritania, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Israel and Jordan) and Istanbul Cooperation Initiative (ICI) countries. The initial phase included expanding those countries' participation in relevant existing NATO {{training and education}} programmes, {{and the establishment of}} <b>a</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> faculty at the NATO Defense College in Rome. As a second phase, NATO would consider supporting the establishment of a Security Cooperation Centre in the region, to be owned by the MD and ICI countries, with regional funding and NATO assistance.

500|$|An Israeli attorney's 1987 {{comment to}} the Christian Science Monitor, {{that his country}} had never [...] "tried to root out the PLO in the Arab street" [...] was the first modern use in its present sense without the scare quotes. By {{the end of the}} decade it came into wide use in both American {{academic}} and popular media, as coverage of the First Palestinian Intifada dominated news from the region. This may have been the result of geopolitical shifts taking place at the same time. New York Times language columnist William Safire anonymously quoted <b>a</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> expert who told him that before the late 1980s the term [...] "Arab masses" [...] had been used instead. [...] "With the eclipse of the Soviet Union, that phrase disappeared because [...] had too much of a Marxist–Soviet–Communist tilt to it."

500|$|When the Commando {{units were}} {{originally}} formed in 1940, training was {{the responsibility of}} the unit commanding officers. Training was hampered by the general shortage of equipment throughout the British Army at this time, as most arms and equipment had been left behind at Dunkirk. In December 1940 <b>a</b> <b>Middle</b> <b>East</b> Commando depot was formed with the responsibility of training and supplying reinforcements for the Commando units in that theatre. In February 1942 the Commando training depot at Achnacarry in the Scottish Highlands was established by Brigadier Charles Haydon.

The depot staff were all hand picked, with the ability to outperform any of the volunteers.

The central problem for American policy in the Middle East was that this region was perceived as strategically important due to its oil, but the United States, weighed down by defense commitments in Europe and the Far East, lacked sufficient troops to resist a Soviet invasion of the Middle East. In 1952, General Omar Bradley of Joint Chiefs of Staff declared at a planning session about what to do {{in the event of a}} Soviet invasion of the Near East: [...] "Where will the staff come from?
