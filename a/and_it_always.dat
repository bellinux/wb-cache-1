25|$|A Folk Tale {{takes as}} its {{starting}} point the archetypal dilemma of the folk ballad, {{the transition from}} one home to another {{in the context of}} a wedding, where both men and women run the risk of getting into difficulties. The men might be lured under a spell by elves and the women might be carried off by disguised nixes <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> happens in an outdoor, natural environment, which is both compelling and mysterious. Both the elves and the nixes exert a demonic and erotic power over the victims and in most cases have a fateful impact on them - many end in the grave.|$|E
25|$|The Australian {{painted lady}} {{belongs to the}} family Nymphalidae and genus Vanessa, which compromises 22 species, which are {{strongly}} migratory. The Australian painted lady {{is similar to the}} near-cosmopolitan painted lady (V. cardui), so it considered by some to be a subspecies of that. However, throughout its range, the painted lady does not exhibit much variation, but the male genitalia of the Australian painted lady is distinct from that of the painted lady, which suggests that it is a separate species. The Australian species' four ventral eyespots are less clearly defined, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> sports at least three (often four) conspicuous blue pupil spots on each dorsal hindwings' eyespots. V. cardui has either a few tiny pupil spots, or more often, none at all.|$|E

Although the band has changed, we’ve lost Layne, we’ve added Will, {{and there was no}} master plan. Playing again in 2005 felt right, so we did the next thing and toured. We did it step by step. It’s more than just making music, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> has been. We’ve been friends a long time. We’ve been more of a family than most, and it had to be okay from here", Cantrell said pointing to his heart.|$|E

500|$|Docter created Dug {{as he felt}} {{it would}} be {{refreshing}} to show what a dog thinks, rather than what people assume it thinks. Knowledge of canine communication, body language and pack behaviors for the artists and animators to portray such thoughts came from consultant Dr. Ian Dunbar, veterinarian, dog behaviorist and trainer. The idea for Alpha's voice derived from thinking {{about what would happen}} if someone broke a record player <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> played at a high pitch. Russell was added to the story at a later date than Dug and Kevin; his presence, as well as the construction workers, helped to make the story feel less [...] "episodic".|$|E
500|$|Film noir {{is often}} {{associated}} with an urban setting, and a few cities—Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, and Chicago, in particular—are the location of many of the classic films. In the eyes of many critics, the city is presented in noir as a [...] "labyrinth" [...] or [...] "maze". Bars, lounges, nightclubs, and gambling dens are frequently the scene of action. The climaxes of a substantial number of films noir take place in visually complex, often industrial settings, such as refineries, factories, trainyards, power plants—most famously the explosive conclusion of White Heat, set at a chemical plant. In the popular (and, frequently enough, critical) imagination, in noir it is always night <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> rains.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with TV Guide Anders expressed the same sentiments, responding, [...] "I've watched Rachel struggle. She's always {{trying to do the}} right thing, or thinks she's {{trying to do the right}} thing, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> gets messed up." [...] Anders also said that this song is [...] "her asking when things are going to work out," [...] and commented that it was [...] "emotional" [...] and thought that it would bring people to tears. [...] "Get It Right" [...] and [...] "Loser Like Me" [...] both premiered on On Air with Ryan Seacrest on February25,2011, and were performed in the episode [...] "Original Song", on March15,2011. The song was also released on the iTunes Store in the United States on March15,2011. In the episode performance, Rachel Berry (Michele) appears performing the song with a bedazzled microphone, wearing a blue dress, black belt, and boots, accompanied by Brittany Pierce (Heather Morris) and Tina Cohen-Chang (Jenna Ushkowitz) in the background.|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of the {{original}} remix with André, Kesha and co-producer of the track, Luke, decided that they wanted to remix the track again with the intention of adding some of Kesha's desired future collaborations. The first to add their verses to the track was Lil Wayne. Kesha and Wayne both {{happened to be in the}} studio on the same day as each other and she took the opportunity to ask him if he would participate in the remixing of the song. Following this Wiz Khalifa and T.I. were then asked to collaborate on the track. All three rappers agreed to write and appear on the song and with this the remix was completed. According to Kesha, the four rappers on the remix, titled [...] "Sleazy Remix 2.0: Get Sleazier", are included because they are four of her favorite rappers. On December 7, 2011, she posted the following message on the internet, revealing that the song would be released exclusively to iTunes on December 13, 2011: [...] "Get ready to get even $leazier with this sick collaboration I did with 4 of my favorite MCs of all time: Weezy, André 3000, Wiz Khalifa, and T.I., I opened the ‘Get $leazy’ tour with this song every night <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> got the party started ... Get ready, this is the SICKEST and SLEAZIEST version YET.$." ...|$|E
500|$|Tanner Stransky of Entertainment Weekly stated, [...] "This song is a pulsy, {{possibly}} club-ready jam {{that deserves}} single status." [...] Heather Phares of Allmusic used [...] "Who Owns My Heart" [...] {{as an example}} of, according to her, a recurring problem on Can't Be Tamed: [...] "too often, Cyrus equates grown-up with joyless". Alexis Petridis of the United Kingdom magazine The Guardian felt the song was a gamely attempt at Lady Gaga. He said the chorus invites the answer: [...] "probably that creepy bloke from the Disney Channel who went on about violating your godliness." [...] Evan Sawdey of PopMatters also found an alternate answer to the song's chorus. [...] "It’s commerce that owns your heart, Miley, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> has been", he wrote. Mikael Wood of Billboard compared [...] "Who Owns My Heart" [...] to 2010 singles released by The Black Eyed Peas. Nick Levine of Digital Spy {{said it was a}} post-GaGa Hi-NRG track that was inclined to the generic. However, he said that lyrical references were a large reminder that Cyrus sung the track. Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic deemed [...] "Who Owns My Heart" [...] {{to be one of the}} best tracks from Can't Be Tamed, despite containing a [...] "cheesy ABBA-worthy chorus". Jon Caramanica of The New York Times also perceived the song to be [...] "in the vein of Cascada" [...] and one of the most [...] "exciting" [...] on Can't Be Tamed. He said it was a sound that [...] "Ms. Cyrus hasn’t previously shown any affinity for and may never again. Still, it’s a timely and sharp sound." ...|$|E
2500|$|However, {{critics were}} not impressed—very few {{authoritative}} voices were complimentary. In response, {{it has been}} claimed that while [...] "Elvis’s success as a singer and movie star dramatically increased his economic capital, his cultural capital never expanded {{enough for him to}} transcend the stigma of his background as a truck driver from the rural South... 'No matter how successful Elvis became... he remained fundamentally disreputable {{in the minds of many}} Americans... He was the sharecropper’s son in the big house, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> showed.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Afro-Cuban jazz was {{considered}} bebop-oriented, and some musicians classified it {{as a modern}} style. Afro-Cuban jazz was successful because it never decreased in popularity <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> attracted people to dance to its unique rhythms. Gillespie's most famous contributions to Afro-Cuban music are the compositions [...] "Manteca" [...] and [...] "Tin Tin Deo" [...] (both co-written with Chano Pozo); {{he was responsible for}} commissioning George Russell's [...] "Cubano Be, Cubano Bop", which featured Pozo. In 1977, Gillespie discovered Arturo Sandoval while researching music during a tour of Cuba.|$|E
2500|$|Nimoy {{played an}} Army {{sergeant}} in the 1954 science fiction thriller Them! {{and a professor}} in the 1958 science fiction movie The Brain Eaters, and had a role in The Balcony (1963), a film adaptation of the Jean Genet play. With Vic Morrow, he co-produced a 1966 version of Deathwatch, an English-language film version of Genet's play Haute Surveillance, adapted and directed by Morrow and starring Nimoy. The story dealt with three prison inmates. Partly {{as a result of his}} role, he then taught drama classes to members of Synanon, a drug rehab center, explaining: [...] "Give a little here <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> comes back." ...|$|E
2500|$|On April 13, 2011, Kiss began {{recording}} {{a new album}} due for release later in the year. Simmons stated, the album [...] "is gonna be the next step to Sonic Boom. Very similar– straight rock songs, no ballads, no keyboards, no nothing, just rock." [...] The band also used old analog equipment instead of more popular digital recording gear. Simmons said: [...] "Technology is a seductive bitch, she will seduce you. You press this button, you don't have to do anything. But analog is the love of your life. You can push real hard <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> gives back. For the new album, the actual recording process was 24-track tape and an old Trident board. And as many tubes as possible. You need tubes, electricity and thick wood to make that thick sound." ...|$|E

2500|$|Like It Like That is {{an album}} of {{original}} soul music influenced by Sebastian's previous album, The Memphis Album, which was a covers album of Memphis soul songs recorded with members of The MGs including Steve Cropper in Memphis in 2007. Sebastian and Cropper remained friends, and Sebastian made several songwriting trips to Nashville in mid-2008, staying with the Croppers on these trips. Sebastian {{said in an interview}} with The Age in October 2009, [...] "The most comfortable I've ever felt in the studio was during The Memphis Album. And the success of that prompted me to make a record like this one." [...] Five of the songs on Like It Like That were co-written with the album's producer David Ryan Harris, four were written entirely by Sebastian himself, and three were co-written with other writers. He later said, [...] "I wrote the music on this album based on how I feel when I listen to the Otis Reddings and the Wilson Picketts of the world. I'll put that music on <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>always</b> just lifts me and makes me feel great." ...|$|E
