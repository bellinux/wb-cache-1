O'Brien was to join the Kennedys at the Johnsons' ranch following the President's speeches and fund raising tour through the state. After President Kennedy was declared dead at Parkland Hospital on the afternoon of November 22, 1963, O'Brien accompanied the President's coffin and Mrs. Kennedy back to Air Force One at Love Field in Dallas. While aboard Air Force One, President Johnson called for O'Brien and Kenny O'Donnell, another Kennedy insider and member of the [...] "Irish Mafia", <b>asking</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> them to stay on and work with him in the new administration. Although O'Brien had never been close to Johnson (and many writers, including Johnson biographer Robert Caro, reported that O'Brien did not like or trust Johnson and/or had openly made fun of Johnson), he remained at the White House and worked for the new President. President Johnson appointed O'Brien to serve as special assistant to the president for congressional relations and personnel. O'Brien continued this service through 1965.|$|R

40|$|Many {{political}} questions specifically {{deal with}} interactions between private actors, and private actors' purchasing {{decisions in the}} free market. Debate often arises when problems are created by free market forces. At this point, the public and government must decide whether under laissez faire capitalism the situation {{should be allowed to}} sort itself out or if the government should intervene to pursue a proposed solution. If a citizen believes that the government should take a laissez faire approach towards economic matters; it would reason that an individual could possibly hold similar views in regards to specific policy questions. The central question this research proposes is: can a survey respondent's support/opposition of government intervention into free markets be used as a predictor for support of specific policies? The authors of this research hypothesize that support/opposition for government intervention {{can be used as a}} predictor for an individual's support of specific policies. This argument can be tested using statistical analysis of existing opinion surveys that test both whether a respondent favors/opposes government intervention and whether a respondent favors/opposes certain government policies. The American National Election Survey from the 2012 election <b>asks</b> <b>both</b> <b>of</b> these sets of questions and provides a large survey sample size for statistical significance. Additionally, by running several case studies, we can solidify any proof or statistical significance that emerges. The results of this research find that voter's opinion on the role of government can predict opinions on specific government interventions...|$|R
