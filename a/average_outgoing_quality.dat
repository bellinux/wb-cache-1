30|$|It {{should be}} noted that all the {{discussed}} processes are assumed to have two stages and the <b>outgoing</b> <b>quality</b> characteristic has been censored. However, there exists a real case dealing with cotton spinning in which the three quality characteristics are Fiber Length, Fiber Strength, and Skein Strength. If the fiber length was to change, it would lead to change in the fiber strength. Moreover, a change in any of the two quality variables would affect the skein strength of the spun cotton. Obviously, fiber strength and skein strength are the reliability-related quality characteristics which bring about censored observations for the second and third stages. Considering the mentioned example and the concept of variable-competing risk discussed in the case of adhesive bond between vinyl fabric and foam backing, we address a three-stage process in which the quality characteristics of both the second and third stages evaluate and reflect the reliability of product. Thus, we use the residuals to construct the CSC and monitor the <b>outgoing</b> <b>quality</b> characteristic. It is remarkable that the proposed monitoring schemes are extended when the censoring occurred in these stages. As mentioned before, the lognormal distribution is widely used to model the reliability data. Furthermore, it is assumed that these reliability-related quality characteristics follow the lognormal distribution.|$|R

Govindaraju & Kandasamy (2000) derived the performance measures such as <b>average</b> <b>outgoing</b> <b>quality</b> (AOQ), average fraction inspected (AFI) etc, of the CSP-C plan using a Markov chain model for long run production processes. Yang (1983) has observed that the AOQ and AFI, being long run average measures, are not satisfactory measures of performance for short run production processes. Hence, formulas are derived in this paper, using the renewal theory approach enabling one to compute AOQ and AFI for both long run and short run production processes. Numerical illustrations are also given. By simulation, the accuracy of the short run measures is studied. <b>Average</b> <b>outgoing</b> <b>quality,</b> renewal theory, short run production process,...|$|E
