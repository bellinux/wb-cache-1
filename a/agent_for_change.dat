Lissitzky, of Lithuanian Jewish оrigin, began his career illustrating Yiddish children's books in an effort to promote Jewish culture in Russia. When only 15 he started teaching, a duty he would maintain for most of his life. Over the years, he taught in a variety of positions, schools, and artistic media, spreading and exchanging ideas. He took this ethic with him when he worked with Malevich in heading the suprematist art group UNOVIS, when he developed a variant suprematist series of his own, Proun, and further still in 1921, when he took up a job as the Russian cultural ambassador to Weimar Germany, working with and influencing important figures of the Bauhaus and De Stijl movements during his stay. In his remaining years he brought significant innovation and change to typography, exhibition design, photomontage, and book design, producing critically respected works and winning international acclaim for his exhibition design. This continued until his deathbed, where in 1941 he produced one of his last works– a Soviet propaganda poster rallying the people to construct more tanks for the fight against Nazi Germany. In 2014, the heirs of the artist, in collaboration with Van Abbemuseum and leading worldwide scholars on the subject, the Lissitzky Foundation was established in order to preserve the artist's legacy and to prepare a catalogue raisonné of the artist oeuvre.|$|E

40|$|We are {{the ones}} we’ve been waiting for’: {{community}} development, collective identity and agency {{in the age of}} Obama Akwugo Emejulu* Abstract This paper argues that community development has much to learn from the discursive strategies developed within Barack Obama’s successful 2008 presidential campaign. The discourse of the campaign constructed specific identities of both Obama and the public which (re) produced a collective mood <b>for</b> <b>change.</b> By constructing the public (rather than the campaign) as active <b>agents</b> <b>for</b> <b>change,</b> the Obama campaign helped to fuel the desire and social practices <b>for</b> <b>change</b> in the political establishment. Understanding how the campaign constructs the identities of Obama and the voting public is crucial for community development in the United States and the United Kingdom. Despite its rhetoric, community development often constructs highly problematic identities in which the public are constituted as a passive object rather than an active <b>agent</b> <b>for</b> progressive social <b>change.</b> Learning lessons about how the Obama campaign constructs collective identity may help community development transform these problematic discursive practices in relation to local people...|$|R

50|$|The Developmental Needs Meeting Strategy (DNMS) is a {{psychotherapy}} approach {{developed by}} Shirley Jean Schmidt, MA, LPC. It {{is designed to}} treat adults with psychological trauma wounds (such as those inflicted by verbal, physical, and sexual abuse) and with attachment wounds (such as those inflicted by parental rejection, neglect, and enmeshment). The DNMS is an ego state therapy {{based on the assumption}} that the degree to which developmental needs were not adequately met is the degree to which a client may be stuck in childhood. This model aims to identify ego states that are stuck in the past and help them get unstuck by remediating those unmet developmental needs. The processing starts with the DNMS therapist guiding a patient to mobilize three internal Resource ego states: a Nurturing Adult Self, a Protective Adult Self, and a Spiritual Core Self. The therapist then guides these three Resources to gently help wounded child ego states get unstuck from the past by meeting their unmet developmental needs, helping them process through painful emotions, and by establishing an emotional bond. The relationship wounded child parts have with these Resources is considered the primary <b>agent</b> <b>for</b> <b>change.</b> Alternating bilateral stimulation (made popular by EMDR therapy) is applied at key points in the protocol to enhance the process. The DNMS focuses special attention on healing maladaptive introjects (wounded ego states that mimic abusive, neglectful, or dysfunctional caregivers. The model assumes that these ego states cause the most trouble for clients, so helping them heal may result in a significant benefit - leading to a decrease in unwanted behaviors, beliefs, and emotions.|$|E

Derived from governance concept, the idea of civil society inclusion is highlighted. Focusing on an agglomerated case study, Bang Plee Community in Thailand, this research investigates on a non-state sector, 201 -Community organization, as an <b>agent</b> <b>for</b> <b>changes</b> to improve urban environments on solid waste collection. Two roles are contested: as an <b>agent</b> <b>for</b> neighborhood internal <b>change</b> and as an intermediary toward governance changes in state-civil society interaction. By employing longitudinal analysis via a project intervention as research experiment, the outcomes of both roles are detected portrayed in three spheres: state, state-civil society interaction, and civil society sphere. It discovers in the research regarding agglomerated context that as an internal <b>changes</b> <b>for</b> environmental betterment, 201 -Community organization operation brings on waste reduction at the minimal level. Community-based organization as an <b>agent</b> <b>for</b> <b>changes</b> – despite capacity input it still limited in efficiency and effectiveness – can mobilize fruitfully only at the individual and network level of civil society sectors, while fails managing at the organizational level. The positive outcomes result by economic waste incentive associated with a limited-bonded group rather than the rise of awareness at large. As an intermediary <b>agent</b> <b>for</b> shared governance, the community-based organization cannot bring on mutual dialogue with state as much as cannot change the state’s operation arena of solid waste management. The findings confine the shared governance concept that it does not applicable in agglomerated locality as an effective outcome, both in terms of being instrumental toward civil society inclusion and being provocative of internal change. Shared environmental governance as summarized in this research can last merely a community development action. It distances significantly from civil society inclusion and empowerment. However, the research proposes that community-based environmental management and shared governance toward civil society inclusion in urban environmental improvement are still an expectable option and reachable if their factors and conditions of key success and failure are intersected with a particular context.
