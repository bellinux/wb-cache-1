50|$|Cohn Campbell was {{aided by}} a Gurkha {{battalion}} and two company Battalions. The three forces summoned by the Begum, including the one from Kalakankar camped at chande in Sultanpur district of Uttar Pradesh <b>awaiting</b> the <b>signal</b> for battle.|$|R
60|$|The mist {{was rapidly}} lightening, {{and the country}} grew visible for miles around. In the camp of Gian Maria he {{observed}} a coming and going of men that argued an inordinate bustle for so early an hour. They <b>awaited</b> his <b>signal.</b>|$|R
60|$|Inaction, {{during the}} {{development}} of some critical manoeuvre, while <b>awaiting</b> the <b>signal</b> to be up and doing, is hard to bear. Arkal and his men whiled away the time in whispered conversations, which related more or less to the part {{they were expected to}} play.|$|R
5000|$|... 5 November 2006: Weak signals were detected, {{indicating}} the spacecraft was <b>awaiting</b> instructions. The <b>signal</b> cut {{out later that}} day.|$|R
60|$|At last I {{was alone}} with Gladys, and the moment of Fate had come! All that evening I had felt like the soldier who <b>awaits</b> the <b>signal</b> which will send him on a forlorn hope; hope of victory and fear of repulse {{alternating}} in his mind.|$|R
50|$|In {{this example}} {{it is known}} that another thread will set buf->full (the actual {{condition}} <b>awaited)</b> before <b>signaling</b> buf->cond (the means of synchronizing the two threads). The waiting thread will always verify the truth of the actual condition upon returning from , ensuring correct behaviour if spurious wakeup occurs.|$|R
6000|$|Undisturbed, {{with the}} band of desperate bandits lying motionless, <b>awaiting</b> the <b>signal</b> to attack, the train pulled out from Espina. As its speed increased, and the black masses of {{chaparral}} went whizzing past on either side, the express messenger, lighting his pipe, looked through his window and remarked, feelingly: ...|$|R
60|$|The {{fishing vessels}} were still crowded together, running to and fro, out and in, without {{definite}} purpose, plunging over the heaving swells--some of them {{visible on the}} crests, others half hidden in the hollows--and behaving generally like living creatures that were impatiently <b>awaiting</b> the <b>signal</b> to begin a race.|$|R
60|$|The attack {{upon the}} village was to take place at half-past five; and never did moments appear so slow, to the boys, as those which passed as they <b>awaited</b> the <b>signal.</b> At last the silence was broken by the sharp crack of a rifle, {{followed}} by three or four others.|$|R
50|$|When Jon Snow first {{arrives in}} the Wildling camp, he {{initially}} mistakes Tormund for Mance Rayder, much to Tormund's amusement. Mance directs Tormund to lead a group of Wildlings including Jon Snow and his captor, Ygritte, south of the Wall to <b>await</b> the <b>signal</b> of Mance Rayder to attack the Night's Watch.|$|R
50|$|Captain Trefry {{indicated}} that he would stand by and <b>await</b> a <b>signal.</b> At 2 AM the next morning, the seas calmed sufficiently that Templar {{was able to get}} all 24 crew members off Celestial Empire, along with the dogs and hens. Additionally, a large quantity of stores was transferred to Templar in the ships’ boats.|$|R
60|$|As {{day began}} to break, each man grasped his firelock and <b>awaited</b> the <b>signal</b> with impatience. A cheer broke from {{them as the}} four cannon roared {{out at the same}} moment, and at so short a {{distance}} that every shot told on the gate. Another salvo and both halves of the gate were splintered.|$|R
40|$|Follicular fluid is {{a unique}} body fluid {{containing}} {{a large number of}} biochemical components, some in extremely high concentrations, whilst {{in the middle of this}} relatively isolated biological compart-ment lies the arrested oocyte <b>awaiting</b> the <b>signals</b> to resume meiosis and progress towards timely ovulation. Delineation of these signals poses a challenging task. While there have been numerou...|$|R
60|$|Whatever {{impression}} {{the morality}} of Natty made on the Judge, it was utterly lost on Richard. He availed himself of the gathering of the sportsmen, to lay a plan for one “fell swoop” of destruction. The musket-men were drawn up in battle array, in a line extending {{on each side of}} his artillery, with orders to <b>await</b> the <b>signal</b> of firing from himself.|$|R
6000|$|As soon as {{she heard}} the hiss of {{the air in the}} helmet, she screwed on the bull's-eye, and our diver was as much shut off from {{surrounding}} atmosphere {{as if he had been}} twenty fathoms under the sea. Then she went to where the pumpers were at work, and taking the air-pipe in one hand and the life-line in the other, <b>awaited</b> <b>signals.</b> These were soon sent from the verandah. More air was demanded and given; less was asked and the pumpers wrought gently. Molly gave one pull at the life-line, [...] "All right?" [...] Rooney replied, [...] "All right." [...] This was repeated several times. Then came four sharp pulls at the line. Molly was on the alert; she bid Ram-stam continue to pump while Chok-foo helped her to pull the diver forcibly out of the verandah into the interior of the pagoda amid shouts of laughter, in which Rooney plainly joined though his voice could not be heard.|$|R
5000|$|Captain Barclay {{and his men}} <b>await</b> a <b>signal</b> {{to invade}} the island. When a stash of {{explosives}} is detonated, they storm the isle. MacAllister is killed by Barclay, who is savoring his revenge when Christine gains some of her own, mortally wounding Barclay. She remains unaware that she has just killed her own father, and with his dying words, Barclay implores Dick {{to keep it a}} secret.|$|R
60|$|Thus admonished--Miss Terry entered groaning, Arthur {{taking his}} seat beside her, and Mrs. Carr hers {{in a sort}} of dickey behind. The newly- married pair, who did not half like it, possessed {{themselves}} of the smaller sledge, determined to brave extinction in each other's arms. Then the conductors seized the ropes, and, planting their one naked foot firmly before them, <b>awaited</b> the <b>signal</b> to depart.|$|R
60|$|It was a goodly, and at {{the same}} time an anxious, sight, to behold so many gallant champions, mounted bravely, and armed richly, stand ready {{prepared}} for an encounter so formidable, seated on their war-saddles like so many pillars of iron, and <b>awaiting</b> the <b>signal</b> of encounter with the same ardour as their generous steeds, which, by neighing and pawing the ground, gave signal of their impatience.|$|R
50|$|Body of Water is {{a musical}} {{conceived}} by Tony Kienitz and Tanna Herr with music by Jim Walker (JVA). It entails {{the life of}} fourteen teens left behind {{in a civil war}} crisis, <b>awaiting</b> further <b>signals</b> from their parents while hiding in a secluded mountain cabin. The show was the inaugural production of A Theatre Near U, a theatre and film academy for teenagers in the San Francisco Bay Area.|$|R
5000|$|On the {{afternoon}} of August 20, 1966, a young man was flying a kite on the Morro do Vintém (Vintém Hill) in Niterói, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, when he came upon the bodies of two deceased males and reported them to the authorities. The Morro do Vintém had difficult terrain, and the police were unable to reach the bodies until the next day. When a small team of police and firefighters arrived, they encountered an odd scene: the bodies rested next to each other, partly covered by grass. Each one wore a formal suit, a lead eye mask, and a waterproof coat. There were no signs of trauma or any evidence of a struggle. Next to the corpses, police found an empty water bottle and a packet containing two wet towels. A small notebook was also identified, on which were written the cryptic instructions, [...] "16:30 estar no local determinado. 18:30 ingerir cápsulas, após efeito proteger metais aguardar sinal mascara" [...] ('16:30 be at the specified location. 18:30 ingest capsules, after the effect protect metals <b>await</b> <b>signal</b> mask').|$|R
2500|$|On 19 December, private {{intelligence}} agency, Stratfor, in {{its latest}} report, said, [...] "Indian military operations against targets in Pakistan {{have in fact}} been prepared, and <b>await</b> the <b>signal</b> to go forward". They also wrote that, [...] "Indian military preparations, unlike previous cases, {{will be carried out}} in stealth". India's Border Security Force (BSF) has been put on high alert on the western sector, as well as the eastern sector, to prevent terrorist infiltration.|$|R
50|$|A citizen with a Colt {{revolver}} in 1840 is {{an example}} of an amateur weapon leading to democracy and mass armies of citizen-soldiers. Since transportation and communication technologies of the time did not allow for the real-time control of dispersed armies, battle plans became highly planned in advance, and armies merely <b>awaited</b> the <b>signal.</b> By 1914, all European countries used this method, and leaped at each other over a minor, peripheral matter.|$|R
50|$|Moto escapes {{underwater}} and frees Venables, {{who goes}} to the police. Norvel dives down to <b>await</b> a <b>signal</b> from Fabian but Moto overpowers him and prematurely detonates the explosives meant to destroy the French fleet. Resurfacing, Moto fights with Fabian but Connie shows up and shoots Fabian. Moto discovers the saboteur's plans in Fabian's dummy but never reveals to the audience which country tried to engineer a war between France and England.|$|R

5000|$|Najo's spring {{training}} statistics {{indicate that he}} played well {{enough to make the}} major league team. However, {{on the final day of}} {{spring training}}, Najo was released to the San Antonio Bears. The Chicago Daily Tribune reported, [...] "The Sox squad was cut down by one today when Najo ... was shipped to the San Antonio club to which he has been released outright. There are others tonight <b>awaiting</b> the <b>signal</b> to move." ...|$|R
60|$|The Warreners were on duty by {{the side}} of General Nicholson; and {{accustomed}} as they were to danger, their hearts beat fast as they <b>awaited</b> the <b>signal.</b> It was to be a tremendous enterprise--an enterprise absolutely unrivaled in history--for five thousand men to assault a city garrisoned by some thirty thousand trained troops, and a fanatical and turbulent population of five hundred thousand, all, it may be said, fighting with ropes round their necks.|$|R
60|$|Satisfied, Tarzan {{turned and}} retraced his {{steps toward the}} summit of the kopje. Werper, from the {{concealment}} of a jutting, granite shoulder, watched him pass up from the shadows of the stairway and advance {{toward the edge of the}} hill which faced the rim of the valley where the Waziri <b>awaited</b> the <b>signal</b> of their master. Then Werper, slipping stealthily from his hiding place, dropped into the somber darkness of the entrance and disappeared.|$|R

50|$|At dusk the {{disguised}} group manned the longboat, and at nightfall they slipped {{alongside the}} Boyd and {{were greeted by}} the crew. Other Māori canoes <b>awaited</b> the <b>signal</b> to attack. The first to die was a ship's officer: the attackers then crept around the deck, stealthily killing all the crew. The passengers were called to the deck and then killed. Five people hid up the mast among the rigging, where they witnessed the dismembering of their friends and colleagues' bodies below.|$|R
60|$|The party now set to work. With the gimlet holes {{were made}} a couple of feet above the water. In them the hooks were inserted, and from these the petards were {{suspended}} by ropes, so as to lie against the sides of the boats, an inch only above the water's level. The fuses were inserted; and all being now in readiness for blowing a hole {{in the side of the}} two boats, they regained the log, and <b>awaited</b> the <b>signal.</b>|$|R
60|$|And, as if {{in answer}} to his remark, the archers began once more to advance against the barricade, and the arrows to fall thick. But there was {{something}} hesitating in the attack. They came not on roundly, but seemed rather to <b>await</b> a further <b>signal.</b>|$|R
50|$|After Armenia {{lost its}} {{independence}} to the Bolsheviks, Yerganian went to Tbilisi {{where he and}} Misak Grigorian were assigned to assassinate former Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of Azerbaijan Fatali Khan Khoyski {{and leader of the}} Musavat party Khan Mahmadov. On June 19, 1920 they met at Tbilisi's Yerevan Square as they <b>awaited</b> a <b>signal</b> from their accomplices. When Khoiski and Mahmadov were 100 to 150 meters away, they immediately opened fire on them. Khoiski was killed instantly, but Mahmadov, who was only wounded, escaped.|$|R
5000|$|Knowledge of the {{probability}} of a target in the next bag does not suppress the prevalence effect, suggesting that low-prevalence search is similar to vigilance tasks in which observers <b>await</b> fleeting <b>signals.</b> This phenomenon has been observed in vigilance literature as [...] "signal-probability effects". It has been demonstrated that low signal probability reduces hit rates in classical low-event-rate, low-cognitive-load vigilance tasks by shifting criteria rather than decreasing sensitivity, and these effects are accompanied by slowed [...] "yes" [...] reaction times and faster [...] "no" [...] reaction times.|$|R
5000|$|The Astra {{encounters}} Neeya's ship, {{identified by}} the Deesan diplomats as the Gaya. A transmitter for the command system has been left on, forcing Neeya to teleport aboard. She manages to disable the signal and is rescued by Stepan. One of the diplomats, Rakan, explains that the Gaya was the last ship to leave Dessa. Aboard was Professor Glan, who was building an army of clones and <b>awaiting</b> a <b>signal</b> from rebel forces on the planet that {{the time was right}} to return and take over.|$|R
60|$|Without a {{word the}} boys slipped away. Mr. Hardy then {{placed on a}} round shelf nailed to the flagstaff, at about eight feet from the ground, a blue-light, fitting into a socket on the shelf. The shelf was made just so large that it threw a shadow {{over the top of}} the tower, so that those {{standing}} there were in comparative darkness, while everything around was in bright light. There, with a match in his hand to light the blue-light, he <b>awaited</b> the <b>signal.</b>|$|R
