5|$|Exmoor was {{designated}} a National Park in 1954, under the 1949 National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act. The Exmoor National Park is primarily an upland {{area with a}} dispersed population living mainly in small villages and hamlets. The largest settlements are Porlock, Dulverton, Lynton, and Lynmouth, which together contain almost 40% of the park's population. Lynton and Lynmouth are combined into one parish and are connected by the Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway. Exmoor was once a Royal forest and hunting ground, covering , which was sold off in 1818. Several areas within the Exmoor National Park have been declared Sites of Special Scientific Interest due to their flora and fauna. This title earns the site some legal protection from development, damage and neglect. In 1993 <b>an</b> <b>environmentally</b> sensitive area was established within Exmoor.|$|E
5|$|From 1974 to 1977, Oceanside police {{kept track}} of over 1,000 {{accidents}} that occurred along SR 76. A citizen action group known as Concerned Citizens for Highway 76 formed soon after. Caltrans began holding hearings again in 1979, proposing the building of an expressway {{as opposed to a}} freeway or to widening Mission Avenue. At one hearing, local officials criticized the delay, while others criticized the routing, the decision to build an expressway instead of a freeway, and building a route through <b>an</b> <b>environmentally</b> sensitive area. In May 1980, the state Assembly Transportation Committee approved a resolution that requested an answer from the governor at the time, Jerry Brown, and Caltrans as to why certain projects, including SR76, had not been started.|$|E
5|$|Nuclear {{power was}} {{considered}} <b>an</b> <b>environmentally</b> clean alternative for the commercial {{generation of electricity}} and {{was part of a}} popular national policy for the peaceful use of atomic energy in the 1950s and 1960s. Gravel publicly opposed this policy; besides the dangers of nuclear testing, he was a vocal critic of the Atomic Energy Commission, which oversaw American nuclear efforts, and of the powerful United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, which had a stranglehold on nuclear policy and which Gravel tried to circumvent. In 1971, Gravel sponsored a bill to impose a moratorium on nuclear power plant construction and to make power utilities liable for any nuclear accidents; in 1975, he was still proposing similar moratoriums. By 1974, Gravel was allied with Ralph Nader's organization in opposing nuclear power.|$|E

30|$|Next, let me {{show how}} {{disposal}} firms affect producers of consumption commodities. Environmentally friendly waste-disposal firms treat waste in a proper way and give no or little burden to the environment. They not only collect the information for completing proper disposal but also release it to producers, asking them to produce <b>a</b> more <b>environmentally</b> friendly commodity, which is disposed of without difficulty at the post-consumption stage. These strengthen the trend of DfE, encouraging producers to produce <b>a</b> more <b>environmentally</b> friendly commodity. It is worth pointing out that this may possibly contribute to the improvement of <b>a</b> production process. <b>Environmentally</b> unfriendly disposal firms ignore these and do not contribute to DfE.|$|R
