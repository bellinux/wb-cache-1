40|$|We {{improve the}} {{readability}} of <b>a</b> personal <b>timeline</b> by weaving multiple social contexts of tweets into a visualization. Our social contexts consist of three dimensions: community membership, key persons, and interesting tweets within <b>a</b> personal <b>timeline.</b> <b>A</b> person {{is often a}} member of several communities, such as a family, a class, or a team, simultaneously. We identify all communities that a user participates in. Labeling a tweet with a visual representation to indicate what community it belongs to can help readers {{to understand why the}} tweet is written, since different communities are likely to carry tweets in different contexts. We then discover key persons and interesting tweets within <b>a</b> personal <b>timeline.</b> Our prototype design demonstrates how three social contexts work together for visualizing <b>a</b> personal <b>timeline...</b>|$|R

5|$|The opening {{movie to}} Ever 17 {{was created by}} the game's producer, who picked out CGs and {{keywords}} from the game to include. Nakazawa gave instructions to have the characters appear in the same order as the recommended route playing order the developers had decided on, hoping for the order to leave an impression and influence players to play the game in that order. The ending movie was created by Nakazawa, who was not used to the tools used in video creation. He added <b>a</b> <b>timeline</b> to the credits roll, intending for it to feel emotional to get an overview of the story after having finished it, and finding it fitting to have <b>a</b> <b>timeline</b> scrolling along with the calm ending theme. For the PlayStation Portable version, {{the creation of a new}} opening movie was outsourced to a video design company, chosen specifically for one designer working there. Nakazawa sent them instructions on what text and graphics to use, and they created an animatic based on it, before adding the details. The ending movie for this version {{was created by the}} publisher, Cyberfront, without Nakazawa's involvement.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on June 28, 2011, the PHP Group {{implemented}} <b>a</b> <b>timeline</b> for {{the release}} of new versions of PHP. Under this system, at least one release should occur every month.

Every minor release should at least be supported for two years with security and bug fixes, followed by at least one year of only security fixes, for a total of a three-year release process for every minor release. No new features, unless small and self-contained, are to be introduced into a minor release during the three-year release process.|$|E

5|$|Geotaphonomy is the {{examination}} of how the decomposition of the body affects the environment. Geotaphonomy examinations can include how the soil was disturbed, pH alteration of the surrounding area, and either the acceleration or deceleration of plant growth around the body.

5|$|Marvel 1602 is an eight-issue {{comic book}} limited series {{published}} in 2003 by Marvel Comics.

The eight-part series takes place in <b>a</b> <b>timeline</b> where Marvel superheroes exist in the Elizabethan era; faced with the destruction of their world by a mysterious force, the heroes must fight to save their universe. Many of the early Marvel superheroes — Nick Fury, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, and Spider-Man — as well as villains such as Doctor Doom and Magneto appear in various roles.|$|E
5|$|Films {{generate}} {{income from}} several revenue streams, including theatrical exhibition, home video, television broadcast rights and merchandising. However, theatrical box office earnings {{are the primary}} metric for trade publications in assessing {{the success of a}} film, mostly because of the availability of the data compared to sales figures for home video and broadcast rights, but also because of historical practice. Included on the list are charts of the top box office earners (ranked by both the nominal and real value of their revenue), a chart of high-grossing films by calendar year, <b>a</b> <b>timeline</b> showing the transition of the highest-grossing film record, and a chart of the highest-grossing film franchises and series. All charts are ranked by international theatrical box office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights and merchandise.|$|E

5|$|Prime was {{released}} for the GameCube in five versions. The original North American and Japanese NTSC versions {{and the second}} North American version, which contained minor changes, all used a loader that sometimes caused the game to freeze in specific rooms. The European PAL version resolved these glitches and contained altered elements of the gameplay to prevent sequence breaking, a slower loader that prevented the occasional crashes, slightly different story details, and narration in the opening and closing scenes. Some of these changes were carried over from the PAL version to the NTSC region's Player's Choice re-release, along with additional changes not made in other releases. This version, which was bundled with a silver GameCube, also contained a second disc featuring a preview trailer and a demo for Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, <b>a</b> <b>timeline</b> of Metroid games, and an art gallery.|$|E
5|$|This is <b>a</b> <b>timeline</b> of {{the events}} {{relating}} to the discovery that peptic ulcer disease and some cancers are caused by H. pylori. In 2005, Barry Marshall and Robin Warren were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery that peptic ulcer disease (PUD) was primarily caused by Helicobacter pylori, a bacterium with affinity for acidic environments, such as the stomach. As a result, PUD {{that is associated with}} H. pylori is currently treated with antibiotics used to eradicate the infection. For 30 years prior to their discovery, it was widely believed that PUD was caused by excess acid in the stomach. During this time, acid control was the primary method of treatment for PUD, to only partial success; among other effects, it is now known that acid suppression alters the stomach milieu to make it less amenable to H. pylori infection.|$|E
5|$|The {{destruction}} of Syria's chemical weapons began in September 2013 {{on the basis}} of several international agreements with Syria that stipulated an initial destruction deadline of 30 June 2014. United Nations Security Council Resolution 2118 of 27 September 2013 required Syria to assume responsibility for and follow <b>a</b> <b>timeline</b> for the {{destruction of}} its chemical weapons and its chemical weapon production facilities. The resolution bound Syria to the implementation plan presented in a decision of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). On 23 June 2014, the last declared chemical weapons were shipped out of Syria for destruction. The destruction of the most dangerous chemical weapons was performed at sea aboard the Cape Ray, a vessel of the United States Maritime Administration's Ready Reserve Force, crewed with U.S. civilian merchant mariners. The actual destruction operations, performed by a team of U.S. Army civilians and contractors, destroyed 600 metric tons of chemical agents in 42 days. However, despite these efforts, the use of chemical weapons in Syria have continued to be reported, with the latest being the chemical attack on Khan Shaykhun in April 2017, which has been alleged to have been perpetrated by the Syrian government.|$|E
