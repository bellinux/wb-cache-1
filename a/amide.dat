5|$|As {{amino acids}} have both a primary amine group and a primary {{carboxyl}} group, these chemicals can undergo {{most of the}} reactions associated with these functional groups. These include nucleophilic addition, <b>amide</b> bond formation, and imine formation for the amine group, and esterification, <b>amide</b> bond formation, and decarboxylation for the carboxylic acid group. The combination of these functional groups allow amino acids to be effective polydentate ligands for metal-amino acid chelates.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{hydrophobic}} transbilayer peptide of erythrocyte glycophorin {{has been}} purified following exchange of tritium into the backbone <b>amides,</b> and reconstituted in egg phosphatidylcholine micelles. Analysis of tritium exchange from the backbone <b>amides</b> of the membrane-reconstituted peptide shows that about {{two of the}} <b>amides</b> are virtually non-exchangeable, about 10 are slowed by factors of 107 relative to free <b>amides</b> in unstructured water soluble peptides and {{the remainder of the}} <b>amides</b> (about 20) have slowing factors of less than 1000. These classes of <b>amides</b> are proposed to reflect the stability of the peptide with respect to hydrogen bond breaking fluctuations and the accessibility of the <b>amides</b> to exchange catalysts in different regions of the bilayer...|$|R
40|$|The {{reaction}} of β-keto <b>amides</b> with ethyl(iodomethyl) zinc {{provides access to}} a wide variety of γ-keto <b>amides,</b> including primary, secondary, and tertiary <b>amides.</b> Although the {{reaction of}} α-substituted β-keto <b>amides</b> are in many cases unsatisfactory, the method can be applied to a broad spectrum of substrates that possess imide and olefinic functionality...|$|R
50|$|Fatty acid <b>amides</b> (FAAs) are <b>amides</b> {{formed from}} a fatty acid and an amine. In nature, many FFAs have {{ethanolamine}} as the amine component. Also known as N-acylethanolamines, they contain the functionality RC(O)N(H)CH2CH2OH. A well known example is anandamide. Other fatty acid <b>amides</b> are fatty acid primary <b>amides</b> (FAPAs). They contain the funcitonality RC(O)NH2). Oleamide {{is an example}} of this class of FAPAs.|$|R
5|$|The Weinreb–Nahm ketone {{synthesis}} is {{a chemical}} reaction used in organic chemistry to make carbon–carbon bonds. It {{was discovered in}} 1981 by Steven M. Weinreb and Steven Nahm as a method to synthesize ketones. The original reaction involved two subsequent nucleophilic acyl substitutions: the conversion of an acid chloride with N,O-Dimethylhydroxylamine, to form a Weinreb–Nahm <b>amide,</b> and subsequent treatment of this species with an organometallic reagent such as a Grignard reagent or organolithium reagent. Nahm and Weinreb also reported the synthesis of aldehydes by reduction of the <b>amide</b> with an excess of lithium aluminum hydride (see <b>amide</b> reduction).|$|E
5|$|Additionally, a one-pot magnesium–halogen {{exchange}} with subsequent arylation has been developed, showcasing {{the stability of}} the Weinreb–Nahm <b>amide</b> and providing an operationally simple method for the synthesis of aryl ketones.|$|E
5|$|Finally, Stephen G. Davies of Oxford has {{designed}} a chiral auxiliary that combines the functionality of the Weinreb <b>amide</b> {{with that of}} the Myers’ pseudoephedrine auxiliary, allowing diastereoselective enolate alkylation followed by facile cleavage to the corresponding enantioenriched aldehyde or ketone.|$|E
50|$|Lithium <b>amides</b> are {{the most}} {{important}} <b>amides,</b> as they are readily prepared from n-butyllithium and the appropriate amine, and they are more stable and soluble than the other alkali metal analogs. Potassium <b>amides</b> are prepared by transmetallation of lithium <b>amides</b> with potassium t-butoxide (see also Schlosser base) or by reaction of the amine with potassium, potassium hydride, n-butylpotassium, or benzylpotassium.|$|R
50|$|Aluminum <b>amides,</b> {{which are}} bulkier and {{sometimes}} more selective than lithium <b>amides,</b> are prepared from the corresponding lithium <b>amides</b> and diethylaluminum chloride.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{secondary}} and tertiary pyridyl <b>amides</b> as potential central nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) ligands were prepared. <b>Amides</b> displayed negligible or very low affinity, whereas two amines achieved {{by reduction of}} corresponding secondary <b>amides,</b> showed affinity in the nanomolar range for nAChR...|$|R
5|$|Lithium amides {{like the}} diisopropylamide (LDA) and the (tetramethylpiperidide (LiTMP)) {{generally}} {{work well for}} the deprotonation {{of all types of}} salts, providing that not too much LiOH is present in the n-butyllithium used to make the lithium <b>amide.</b> Titration of lithium <b>amide</b> can be used to determine the amount of hydroxide in solution. The deprotonation of precursor salts with metal hexamethyldisilazides works very cleanly for the deprotonation of all types of salts, except for unhindered formamidinium salts, where this base can act as a nucleophile to give a triaminomethane adduct.|$|E
5|$|The {{alkali metals}} {{dissolve}} slowly in liquid ammonia, forming ammoniacal solutions of solvated M+ and e−, which {{react to form}} hydrogen gas and the alkali metal <b>amide</b> (MNH2, where M represents an alkali metal): this was first noted by Humphry Davy in 1809 and rediscovered by W. Weyl in 1864. The process may be speeded up by a catalyst. Similar solutions are formed by the heavy divalent alkaline earth metals calcium, strontium, barium, {{as well as the}} divalent lanthanides, europium and ytterbium. The <b>amide</b> salt is quite insoluble and readily precipitates out of solution, leaving intensely coloured ammonia solutions of the alkali metals. In 1907, Charles Krause identified the colour as being due to the presence of solvated electrons, which contribute to the high electrical conductivity of these solutions. At low concentrations (below 3 M), the solution is dark blue and has ten times the conductivity of aqueous sodium chloride; at higher concentrations (above 3 M), the solution is copper-coloured and has approximately the conductivity of liquid metals like mercury. In addition to the alkali metal <b>amide</b> salt and solvated electrons, such ammonia solutions also contain the alkali metal cation (M+), the neutral alkali metal atom (M), diatomic alkali metal molecules (M2) and alkali metal anions (M−). These are unstable and eventually become the more thermodynamically stable alkali metal <b>amide</b> and hydrogen gas. Solvated electrons are powerful reducing agents and are often used in chemical synthesis.|$|E
5|$|The {{reaction}} usually {{works best}} with aromatic nitriles Aryl-CN. A related reaction (called the Sonn-Müller method) starts with an <b>amide,</b> which is treated with PCl5 {{to form the}} imidoyl chloride salt.|$|E
50|$|The {{solubilities}} of <b>amides</b> and esters {{are roughly}} comparable. Typically <b>amides</b> are less soluble than comparable amines and carboxylic acids since these compounds can both donate and accept hydrogen bonds. Tertiary <b>amides,</b> with the important exception of N,N-dimethylformamide, exhibit low solubility in water.|$|R
40|$|A {{self-condensation}} cyclization reaction {{mediated by}} phosphorus pentoxide (P 2 O 5) and catalyzed by zinc bromide (ZnBr 2) is presented for {{the synthesis of}} polysubstituted 4 -pyridones and 2 -pyridones from β-keto <b>amides.</b> A variety of β-keto <b>amides</b> are used in this approach, and {{a wide range of}} functionalized 4 -pyridones and 2 -pyridones were obtained in good to excellent yields. When employing the N -aryl β-keto <b>amides</b> as the substrates in this protocol, 4 -pyridones are resulted, however, when using N -aliphatic-substituted β-keto <b>amides</b> as the partners of N -aryl β-keto <b>amides</b> under the same conditions, 2 -pyridones are afforded...|$|R
40|$|The hydrolytic {{reactions}} of esters and <b>amides</b> of thiosulphurous acid are investigated in a homogeneous medium. The esters are hydrolysed by alkali to give sulphide, sulphite and thiosulphate whereas the <b>amides</b> are resistant towards alkali. Both the esters and <b>amides</b> are hydrolysed by acids giving hydrogen sulphide, sulphur dioxide, polythionates and elemental sulphur. The hydrolysis of these esters and <b>amides</b> in presence of sulphurous acid and thiosulphuric acid gives tetrathionate and hexathionate, respectively...|$|R
5|$|Thus, the {{ammonium}} ion, , {{plays the}} same role in liquid ammonia as does the hydronium ion in water and the <b>amide</b> ion, , {{is analogous to the}} hydroxide ion. Ammonium salts behave as acids, and amides behave as bases.|$|E
5|$|Treatment of an ester or lactone with AlMe3 or AlMe2Cl affords the {{corresponding}} Weinreb <b>amide</b> in good yields. Alternatively, non-nucleophilic Grignard reagents such as isopropyl magnesium chloride {{can be used}} to activate the amine before addition of the ester.|$|E
5|$|As {{both the}} amine and {{carboxylic}} acid groups of amino acids can {{react to form}} <b>amide</b> bonds, one amino acid molecule can react with another and become joined through an <b>amide</b> linkage. This polymerization of amino acids is what creates proteins. This condensation reaction yields the newly formed peptide bond and a molecule of water. In cells, this reaction does not occur directly; instead, the amino acid is first activated by attachment to a transfer RNA molecule through an ester bond. This aminoacyl-tRNA is produced in an ATP-dependent reaction carried out by an aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. This aminoacyl-tRNA is then a substrate for the ribosome, which catalyzes the attack of the amino group of the elongating protein chain on the ester bond. As {{a result of this}} mechanism, all proteins made by ribosomes are synthesized starting at their N-terminus and moving toward their C-terminus.|$|E
40|$|A {{new method}} for {{preparation}} of enamides (N-(alken- 1 -yl) <b>amides)</b> {{by means of}} the 'long-distance' migration of the double bond in unsaturated <b>amides</b> in the presence of [Fe(CO) 5] is described. The method is shown to be particularly useful for the isomerization of N-(but- 3 -enyl) <b>amides,</b> while, in the case of N-(pent- 4 -enyl) and N-(hex- 5 -enyl) <b>amides</b> the mixture of products was formed and the yield of the enamide was relatively low.

50|$|Because of {{the greater}} {{electronegativity}} of oxygen, the carbonyl (C=O) is a stronger dipole than the N-C dipole. The presence of a C=O dipole and, {{to a lesser extent}} a N-C dipole, allows <b>amides</b> to act as H-bond acceptors. In primary and secondary <b>amides,</b> the presence of N-H dipoles allows <b>amides</b> to function as H-bond donors as well. Thus <b>amides</b> can participate in hydrogen bonding with water and other protic solvents; the oxygen atom can accept hydrogen bonds from water and the N-H hydrogen atoms can donate H-bonds. As a result of interactions such as these, the water solubility of <b>amides</b> is greater than that of corresponding hydrocarbons.|$|R

5|$|For {{addition}} of sulfur ylides to enones, higher 1,4-selectivity is typically obtained with sulfoxonium reagents than with sulfonium reagents. Many electron-withdrawing {{groups have been}} shown compatible with the reaction including ketones, esters, and amides (the example below involves a Weinreb <b>amide).</b> With further conjugated systems 1,6-addition tends to predominate over 1,4-addition.|$|E
5|$|Glacial {{acetic acid}} {{is used in}} {{analytical}} chemistry for the estimation of weakly alkaline substances such as organic amides. Glacial acetic acid is a much weaker base than water, so the <b>amide</b> behaves as a strong base in this medium. It then can be titrated using a solution in glacial acetic acid of a very strong acid, such as perchloric acid.|$|E
5|$|Nonetheless, the Weinreb–Nahm <b>amide</b> figures {{prominently}} {{into many}} syntheses, {{serving as an}} important coupling partner for various fragments.

5|$|Weinreb and Nahm {{originally}} {{proposed the}} following reaction mechanism {{to explain the}} selectivity shown in reactions of the Weinreb–Nahm <b>amide.</b> Their suggestion was that the tetrahedral intermediate (A below) formed {{as a result of}} nucleophilic acyl substitution by the organometallic reagent is stabilized by chelation from the methoxy group as shown. This intermediate is stable only at low temperatures, requiring a low-temperature quench.|$|E

Salfredin B11 was first identified in 1995, while later research confirmed the presence of additional salfredin-type metabolites. These compounds are inhibitors of aldose reductase, an enzyme that has been implicated {{in the formation of}} cataracts in advanced stages of diabetes mellitus. The salfredin compounds may have therapeutic use in the treatment of this disorder.|$|E
5|$|Some silver {{compounds}} are very explosive, {{such as the}} nitrogen compounds silver azide, silver <b>amide,</b> and silver fulminate, as well as silver acetylide, silver oxalate, and silver(II) oxide. They can explode on heating, force, drying, illumination, or sometimes spontaneously. To avoid the formation of such compounds, ammonia and acetylene should be kept away from silver equipment. Salts of silver with strongly oxidising acids such as silver chlorate and silver nitrate can explode on contact with materials that can be readily oxidised, such as organic compounds, sulfur and soot.|$|E
40|$|Amines and <b>amides</b> are {{important}} atmospheric organic-nitrogen compounds but high time resolution, highly sensitive, and simultaneous ambient measurements {{of these species}} are rather sparse. Here, we present {{the development of a}} high-resolution time-of-flight chemical ionization mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-CIMS) method, utilizing protonated ethanol as reagent ions to simultaneously detect atmospheric gaseous amines (C 1 to C 6) and <b>amides</b> (C 1 to C 6). This method possesses sensitivities of 5. 6 – 19. 4  Hz pptv − 1 for amines and 3. 8 – 38. 0  Hz pptv − 1 for <b>amides</b> under total reagent ion signals of [*]∼[*]  0. 32  MHz. Meanwhile, the detection limits were 0. 10 – 0. 50  pptv for amines and 0. 29 – 1. 95  pptv for <b>amides</b> at 3 σ of the background signal for a 1  min integration time. Controlled characterization in the laboratory indicates that relative humidity has significant influences on the detection of amines and <b>amides,</b> whereas the presence of organics has no obvious effects. Ambient measurements of amines and <b>amides</b> utilizing this method were conducted from 25 July to 25 August 2015 in urban Shanghai, China. While the concentrations of amines ranged from a few parts per trillion by volume to hundreds of parts per trillion by volume, concentrations of <b>amides</b> varied from tens of parts per trillion by volume to a few parts per billion by volume. Among the C 1 - to C 6 -amines, the C 2 -amines were the dominant species with concentrations up to 130  pptv. For <b>amides,</b> the C 3 -amides (up to 8. 7  ppb) were the most abundant species. The diurnal and backward trajectory analysis profiles of <b>amides</b> suggest that in addition to the secondary formation of <b>amides</b> in the atmosphere, industrial emissions could be important sources of <b>amides</b> in urban Shanghai. During the campaign, photo-oxidation of amines and <b>amides</b> might be a main loss pathway for them in daytime, and wet deposition was also an important sink...|$|R
