40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} whether a sound <b>and</b> <b>complete</b> formal system for join dependencies can be found. We present {{a system that}} is sound <b>and</b> <b>complete</b> for tuple generating dependencies and is strong enough to derive join dependencies from join dependencies using only generalized join dependencies in the derivation. We also present a system that sound <b>and</b> <b>complete</b> for tuple generating dependencies <b>and</b> is <b>complete</b> for extended join dependencies (which are a special case of generalized join dependencies). Finally, we construct a Gentzen-style system that is sound <b>and</b> <b>complete</b> for join dependencies. The last two systems have unbounded inference rules...|$|R
