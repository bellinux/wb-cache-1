500|$|In {{a review}} from Zap2it, Rick Porter gave the pilot praise for {{bringing}} together the central theme, saying [...] "No other new show this fall {{is attempting to}} tell a bigger story, and we're hoping the rough patches smooth out and it fulfills the potential that's there in its very strong cast and premise." [...] It also cited Jennifer Morrison and Jared Gilmore's performances when they appear in scenes together: [...] "As such it falls to Morrison to move the story along in this world, and fortunately for the audience she's able to pull it off. She gives a confident, grounded performance that helps keep the show from feeling too fantastical, and her rapport with Gilmore is <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>plus</b> too." [...] He also notes the writers and producers have put together a great premise and expects they'll have more as the series progresses: [...] "Given the cast and the people involved behind the scenes... we're more optimistic than not that Once Upon a Time will find its way. But if it doesn't, at least it will go down swinging." ...|$|E

40|$|Keeping {{monetary}} and fiscal policy separate causes economic distortions, thus the two should be merged. That is, {{in a recession}} for example, the government and central bank should simply spend more (and/or collect less tax), and fund the latter from new or “printed” money.

40|$|This Research was {{undertaken}} {{to explore and}} better understand the perceptions of SMME owners, in South Africa, of the financial and non financial barriers and facilitators to the formalization/transitioning process. The study was motivated {{by the lack of}} data on the South African context of the barriers and facilitators of the formalization process. The conversion of enterprises from informal to formal concerns is not well researched and understood. In the absence of hard data, experienced observers and practitioners in the small business field express extreme skepticism about the efficacy of attempts to convert informal businesses to formal ones, (Bernstein, 2004). The research was conducted, mostly in Alexandra township Johannesburg, by means of 20 in-depth, semi-structured, face to face interviews with SMME owners; 10 operating informally and 10 who formally were, but have since transitioned/formalized. The resulting findings showed that lack of access to information on formalization and limited access to cash or credit are the major non financial and financial barriers respectively. Improved access to information on formalization is the major non financial facilitator and ability to access <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> market <b>plus</b> increased access to cash or credit are the major financial facilitators. These findings also indicate {{that there may be a}} difference in the barriers and facilitators to formalization in South Africa as compared to what’s reported internationally in the literature.
