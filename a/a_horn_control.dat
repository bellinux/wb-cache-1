5000|$|<b>A</b> <b>control</b> <b>horn</b> is <b>a</b> {{section of}} control surface which {{projects}} {{ahead of the}} pivot point. It generates a force which tends to increase the surface's deflection thus reducing the control pressure experienced by the pilot. <b>Control</b> <b>horns</b> may also incorporate a counterweight which helps to balance the control and prevent it from [...] "fluttering" [...] in the airstream. Some designs feature separate anti-flutter weights.|$|R
40|$|During this {{research}} period, September 16, 1990 to March 15, 1991, a design method for selecting a low-loss impedance material coating for <b>a</b> <b>horn</b> antenna pattern <b>control</b> has been developed. This method and the stepped waveguide technique {{can be employed}} to accurately compute the electromagnetic wave phenomenon inside the transition region of the horn antenna, {{with or without the}} impedance surfaces, from the feed to the radiating aperture. For moment method solutions of the electric and magnetic current distributions on the radiating aperture and the outer surface of the horn antenna, triangular surface-patch modes are introduced to replace the sinusoidal surface-patch modes as expansion and testing functions to provide a more physical expansion of the current distributions. In the synthesis problem, a numerical optimization process is formulated to minimize the error function between the desired waveguide modes and the modes provided by the horn transition with impedance surfaces. Since the modes generated by the horn transition with impedance surface are computed by analytical techniques, the computational error involved in the synthesis of the antenna pattern is minimum. Therefore, the instability problem can be avoided. A preliminary implementation of the techniques has demonstrated that the developed theory of the <b>horn</b> antenna pattern <b>control</b> using the impedance surfaces is realizable...|$|R
5000|$|The {{controls}} {{of a conventional}} 2-line/"U-Control" [...] system consist of lead-out cables, a bellcrank, push rods and <b>control</b> <b>horns.</b> These are connected so that differential motion of the lines rotates the bellcrank, causing a pushrod to move either forward or aft. The pushrod {{is connected to the}} control surface with <b>a</b> <b>control</b> <b>horn</b> that moves the elevator (and flaps, if used) up and down. The pilot holds a handle to which the lines are attached. Tilting the handle with the fingers, wrist, and/or elbow motion causes the differential movement in the lines. By convention, tilting the hand so the top is closer to the pilot than the bottom results in [...] "up" [...] elevator, much like pulling back on a full-scale airplane control stick. Also by convention, most airplanes are flown nominally counter-clockwise as viewed from above, with the leadout cables exiting the left wing. This is not universal and some pilots fly in the opposite direction. Flying clockwise has a slight advantage in some situations because most engines run so that the torque will roll the airplane away from the pilot, increasing line tension in upright level flight.|$|R
