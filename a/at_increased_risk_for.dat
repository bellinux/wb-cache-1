5|$|Farm {{animals such as}} {{cows and}} horses as well as pet animals are also {{susceptible}} {{to the effects of}} lead toxicity. Sources of lead exposure in pets can be the same as those that present health threats to humans sharing the environment, such as paint and blinds, and there is sometimes lead in toys made for pets. Lead poisoning in a pet dog may indicate that children in the same household are <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> elevated lead levels.|$|E
5|$|Persons with {{spinal cord}} injury are <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> urinary tract {{infection}} in part because of chronic use of catheter, and in part because of voiding dysfunction.

5|$|Beginning in the 1960s, {{scientists}} with the U.S. Public Health Service published reports about radioactivity released from Hanford, {{and there were}} protests from the health departments of Oregon and Washington. In response to {{an article in the}} Spokane Spokesman Review in September 1985, the Department of Energy announced to declassify environmental records and, in February 1986, released 19,000pages of previously unavailable historical documents about Hanford's operations. The Washington State Department of Health collaborated with the citizen-led Hanford Health Information Network (HHIN) to publicize data about the health effects of Hanford's operations. HHIN reports concluded that residents who lived downwind from Hanford or who used the Columbia River downstream were exposed to elevated doses of radiation that placed them <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> various cancers and other diseases. A mass tort lawsuit brought by two thousand Hanford downwinders against the federal government has been in the court system for many years. Two of six plaintiffs who went to trial in 2005 were awarded $500,000 in damages.|$|E
5|$|Reactive {{attachment}} disorder {{first made}} its appearance in standard nosologies of psychological disorders in DSM-III, 1980, following {{an accumulation of}} evidence on institutionalized children. The criteria included a requirement of onset {{before the age of}} 8 months and was equated with failure to thrive. Both these features were dropped in DSM-III-R, 1987. Instead, onset was changed to being within the first 5 years of life and the disorder itself was divided into two subcategories, inhibited and disinhibited. These changes resulted from further research on maltreated and institutionalized children and remain in the current version, DSM-IV, 1994, and its 2000 text revision, DSM-IV-TR, as well as in ICD-10, 1992. Both nosologies focus on young children who are not merely <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> subsequent disorders but are already exhibiting clinical disturbance.|$|E
5|$|Males {{are also}} {{affected}} by societal expectations, such as notions about masculinity and sexual prowess. Men from some traditional backgrounds may feel performance pressure {{that emphasizes the}} ability to have erections and sexual intercourse. Men who have strong sexual desire but who {{are not able to}} perform sexually may be <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> depression, particularly when they believe strongly in traditional masculine gender norms with sexual function as core to the male identity. Men who strongly believe in these traditional roles may feel sexually inadequate, unmanly, insecure, and less satisfied with life. Since sexual dysfunction has this negative impact on self-esteem, treatment of erectile dysfunction can have a psychological benefit even though it does not help with physical sensation. SCI may necessitate reappraisal and rejection of assumptions about gender norms and sexual function in order to adjust healthily to the disability: those who are able to change the way they think about gender roles may have better life satisfaction and outcomes with rehabilitation. Counseling is helpful in this reassessment process.|$|E

5|$|The forest cobra {{is one of}} {{the least}} {{frequent}} causes of snake bite among the African cobras, largely due its forest-dwelling habits but a bite by this species should be taken very seriously because it ranks as the 4th most venomous Naja (True Cobra) species. The symptomology is thought to be very {{similar to that of the}} Egyptian cobra (Naja haje). Clinical experience with this species has been very sparse, and few recorded bites have been documented. Deaths from respiratory failure due to severe neurotoxicity have been reported, but most victims will survive if prompt administration of antivenom is undertaken as soon as clinical signs of envenomation have been noted. Rare cases of spontaneous recoveries without the use of specific antivenom have also been seen; however, neglecting the use of antivenom places the patient <b>at</b> <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> major morbidity and mortality. If the snake becomes cornered or is agitated, it can quickly attack the aggressor, and because a large amount of venom is injected, a rapidly fatal outcome is possible. The mortality rate of an untreated bite is not exactly known but it is thought to be quite high. The forest cobra does not spit or spray its venom. This species is considered to be among the most intelligent of the African elapids by herpetologists.|$|E

40|$|Research {{identifying}} {{similar and}} dissimilar <b>risk</b> factors <b>for</b> {{directly and indirectly}} self-injurious behaviours among adolescents is scarce. Due to {{the wide range of}} physical and mental health difficulties that may result from self-injurious behaviours, understanding differential risks is important to support at-risk adolescents. To address this gap in the literature, 541 clinically referred children and youth (ages 11 - 18 years old) were assessed using the interRAI Child and Youth Mental Health Assessment (ChYMH) and Adolescent Supplement. Logistic regression analyses revealed that older adolescents were <b>at</b> an <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> both direct and indirect self-injury. Moreover, adolescents who experienced high levels of depressive symptoms, caregiver distress, and neighbourhood violence were <b>at</b> an <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> direct self-injury (i. e., nonsuicidal self-injury, suicidal self-injury). In contrast, adolescents who experienced high levels of aggressive behaviour were <b>at</b> an <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> indirect self-injury (i. e., substance use). Implications for targetted preventative and intervention strategies are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Medication {{errors are}} common within the United States health system.

Care transitions, movement between settings or levels of care, present a particularly vulnerable time for patients. Errors are frequently introduced into a patient's medication regimen during transitions of care, including the inappropriate discontinuation or duplication of medications. Inappropriate discontinuation (non-persistence) of evidence based therapies for chronic diseases places patients <b>at</b> an <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> adverse health outcomes.

40|$|AbstractThe {{prevalence}} of obesity {{in the general population}} is increasing worldwide, and those surviving are <b>at</b> an <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> developing comorbidity and physical limitations. With aging, obesity places this high-risk population <b>at</b> an <b>increased</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> future morbidity, institutionalization, and functional decline. Traditional weight loss programs lead to inconsistent improvements in comorbidity, function, and quality of life. Bariatric surgery may offer a reasonable alternative in selected patients to achieve improvements in these outcomes. We present our approach in assessing the physiologic age of older candidates for bariatric surgery from a geriatrician's perspective that may be useful for general internists, bariatricians, and general surgeons alike. We present how a focus on function and physiological parameters of aging provides more predictive power than that on chronological age alone...|$|R
