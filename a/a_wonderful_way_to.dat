I spoke to my mother about loneliness and the fact that life passes so quickly (even though my mother lived to the ripe old-age of 97, alert and lucid to the end). I asked her, ‘Mother, which period of your life do you miss the most?’ She answered without any hesitation, 'I would like {{to go back to the}} time when we founded the kibbutz.’ I knew right then that I had a story!

5000|$|Maternal-Fetal Bonding: Communication {{between the}} mother and fetus is {{essential}} during pregnancy. One way of strengthening the bond {{between the two is}} through music therapy. Music stimulation helps to develop the fetus's nervous system, structurally and functionally. The unborn child especially prefers the voice of their mother. The most effective <b>way</b> <b>to</b> enhance communication is through singing. Lullabies are the most popular songs sung by mothers. Singing lullabies is <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> <b>way</b> for mothers <b>to</b> express their love and have the baby become familiarized with their mother's melodies and intonations which will provide them a sense of security when they are born, because it will feel just like how they were in the womb. Electronic voice phenomena {{studies have shown that the}} father's voice engages the fetus from feet to the abdomen - which will lead the baby to start walking at a younger age. The mother's voice engages the fetus from waist to head which will strengthen the baby's neck and upper limbs. Not only does prenatal singing benefit the fetus, it also help produce endorphins that automatically reduce the perception of pain and help relax breathing. A fetus can show preference for music; observations have shown the fetus's movements are gentle when listening to soothing music, and comparatively, where there are dissonances included in the music, their movements are bigger and much more rhythmic, such as rolling. The fetus would be comforted by hearing slow-pace passages of Baroque music (Vivaldi and Handel) and lullabies sung by their mother.|$|R

The jury decided {{in favor of the}} defendant, represented by second-year law students Meredith Bunn and Rebecca Franklin. The plaintiff 2 ̆ 7 s team was comprised of second-year students Chris Latimer and Stan Baker. A total of 50 students competed for the honor of participating in the mock trial.

40|$|Family-centred {{care is a}} {{ubiquitous}} term in paediatric health facilities. It {{means that}} an admitted child can never {{be treated as a}} single individual patient and that the family is the unit of care, as the parents and family are central to the child’s wellbeing, especially during traumatic experiences. There is no rigorous evidence that family-centred care works, but qualitative research is drawing out some grave concerns with how it is implemented. Part {{of the problem is that}} there are many descriptions of family-centred care, but few definitions and some of its component parts may be in place in some health services without the whole model being in place. This causes confusion amongst health professionals and parents and children and makes it impossible to test in a randomised controlled trial. Visit any children’s health facility anywhere - rich countries, poor ones; tertiary paediatric facilities, community child health services, institutions for children with disabilities - and one will find that they say they practise family-centred care. It may be in mission statements, clinical practice guidelines, leaflets for parents, signs on walls, policy documents - in other words, everywhere. “Family-centred care” sounds good; it sounds like something to which every health institution which cares for children should definitely use and sounds like <b>a</b> <b>wonderful</b> and ideal <b>way</b> <b>to</b> care for children who need healthcare. After all, every child has a family and every family is affected when a child is ill. There is a wealth of literature about family-centred care, far too much to include here, or even in a single systematic review. Much research has been conducted on it, while many have tried to test it and its application in healthcare. It has been approached from many angles - the children’s, the parents’, the nurses’, the doctors’, the allied health professionals’ and from health service managers’ perceptions. Sociologists have had a go, as have historians, philosophers, anthropologists, just about everyone. But what is it? And what does it mean for those on the receiving end, the families? Does it matter? Does it make a difference? Can we test it? Is there an alternative? In this paper I attempt to answer these questions and consider another model - that of child-centered care...|$|R
