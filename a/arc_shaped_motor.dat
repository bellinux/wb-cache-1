A camber board is usually made of a flexible wood like bamboo, {{and the center of}} the deck will be higher than the mounting point of the trucks creating an <b>arc</b> <b>shape.</b> When weight is applied the center will bend down, creating a reverse of the <b>arc</b> <b>shape.</b> This builds spring tension, that is released at the peak of every complete turn in the [...] "S" [...] pattern.|$|R
40|$|The kinetic {{frictional}} force between a nanowire and its supporting flat substrate {{was measured using}} nanomanipulation with optical microscopy at ambient atmosphere. During testing, the nanowire was pushed at its center point by a sharp tip and thus exhibited an <b>arc</b> <b>shape</b> held by the frictional shear stress (kinetic friction per area). The arc-shaped nanowire slid along the supporting substrate with further pushing. The frictional shear stress {{was derived from the}} <b>arc</b> <b>shape</b> of the nanowire based on the theory of elasticity. The frictional shear stresses of Al 2 O 3 nanowires on the Si and SiN substrates were measured to be 2. 060. 2 and 1. 560. 2 MPa, respectively. It was found that the lengths of the nanowires and their angular orientations with the substrate, the <b>arc</b> <b>shapes</b> being formed and the driving mode of the tip had insignificant effects on the measured frictional shear stress.

50|$|The 4-bar linkage is an adapted {{mechanical}} linkage used on bicycles. With a normal full-suspension bike the back wheel moves {{in a very}} tight <b>arc</b> <b>shape.</b> This means that more power is lost when going uphill. With a bike fitted with a 4-bar linkage, the wheel moves in such a large arc that it is moving almost vertically. This way the power loss is reduced by up to 30%.|$|R
50|$|In the {{subduction}} zone, loss of volatiles {{from the}} subducted slab induces partial melting of the overriding mantle. This process, called flux melting, generates low-density calc-alkaline magma that buoyantly rises to intrude and be extruded through the lithosphere of the overriding plate. The resulting volcano chain has the <b>shape</b> of an <b>arc</b> {{parallel to the}} convergent plate boundary and convex toward the subducting plate. One of the theories to explain the <b>arc</b> <b>shape</b> views this {{as a consequence of}} the geometry of the spherical plate crumpling along a line on a spherical surface, but only the more broadly <b>shaped</b> <b>arcs</b> can be explained in this way.|$|R

Japanese noblewomen started painting their faces with a white powder called oshiroi. One putative reason for hikimayu is that removing the natural eyebrows made it easier to put on the oshiroi. At this time the eyebrows were painted in <b>arc</b> <b>shapes,</b> as in China. Women also started painting their teeth black, which is known as ohaguro.|$|R
