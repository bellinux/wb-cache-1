40|$|The phase {{dynamics}} {{that occur in}} bulk InGaAsP-InP semiconductor optical amplifiers (SOAs) in response to picosecond pulse excitations at 10 and 40 GHz are studied experimentally and numerically for various amplifier lengths. The time dependencies of the phase changes and of the absolute gain of the amplifier are measured simultaneously. The total phase shifts induced by 1. 5 -ps pulses at 10 GHz are higher than /spl pi/ in SOAs with active region lengths between 0. 5 and 2 mm and exceed 2 /spl pi/ in a 1. 5 -mm-long amplifier. Phase shifts above /spl pi/ are measured at 40 GHz in 1. 5 - and 2 -mm-long SOAs. The dependence of the total phase shift on the amplifier bias current and length and on pump pulse energy is investigated. Numerical simulations based on a comprehensive time-domain SOA model allow us to confirm the experimental results {{for a wide range}} of amplifier parameters. In particular, SOAs with lengths up to 5 mm have been modeled, and the calculations suggest that the maximum phase shifts occur in amplifiers of approximately 2 -mm length.

40|$|Wireless {{coverage}} of the end-user domain; be it outdoors or indoors, is poised to become {{an essential part of}} broadband communication networks. In order to offer integrated broadband services (combining voice, data, video, multimedia services, and new value added services), systems will need to offer higher data transmission capacities. The need for increased capacity per unit area leads to higher operating frequencies, smaller radio cells and large number of base stations (BSs), therefore cost-effective BS development is a key success to the market. For this radio over fiber (RoF) technology has been proposed since it provides functionally simple BSs that are connected to a central station (CS) via an optical fiber. A full-duplex data and video signal transmission over single-mode fiber (SMF) based on wavelengthdivision-multiplexing (WDM) and an optical <b>add-drop</b> <b>multiplexing</b> (OADM) technique is proposed and simulated. Four data signals of 1. 25 Gb/s / 9. 1 - 9. 4 GHz are transmitted over long-haul single-mode fiber for downlink transmission.

The advantage of using HNLF as a nonlinear switching medium is the possibility of realising high speed operation (up to 640 Gbit=s) owing to the ultrafast fibre response time.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} short optical pulse {{generation}} from actively mode-locked Erbium-doped fiber ring lasers (ML-EFRL) and their applications in all-optical signal processing (optical sampling and switching) and transmission experiments for high-capacity fiber optic systems. In future ultra-high bit-rate optical time division multiplexed (OTDM) systems, {{one of the}} key requirements is to develop reliable optical pulse sources that can generate high quality optical pulses. ML-EFRLs are very attractive candidates in this respect. Such a laser system with a non-polarization-maintaining cavity has been built and characterized. This laser can generate 10 GHz transform-limited 0. 7 - 1. 3 ps, sech 2 -shaped pulses in the 1536 - 1569 nm wavelength region, with less than 0. 1 ps RMS timing jitter and over 80 dB super-mode noise suppression. Despite the non-PM nature of the laser cavity, long-term stability can still be maintained by a fiber-stretcher-based cavity length maintaining feedback circuit. By using this ring laser as the sampling pulse source, two optical sampling schemes based on 50 m highly nonlinear fiber (HNLF) have been demonstrated. One scheme uses fiber parametric amplification, which has resulted in up to 300 Gb/s real-time eye-diagram measurements with 1. 6 ps temporal resolution. A sensitivity of 10 mW and more than 30 nm operational optical bandwidth were also demonstrated. The other scheme is based on cross-phase modulation (XPM) -induced wavelength shifting and optical filtering, which has led up to 500 Gb/s eye-diagram measurements with a temporal resolution of 0. 7 ps. Signal operational wavelength range covering the whole EDFA gain range (1535 - 1569 nm) was also demonstrated. Furthermore, by exploiting XPM-induced wavelength shifting in HNLF, all-optical demultiplexing of 160 Gb/s OTDM data and simultaneous time domain <b>add-drop</b> <b>multiplexing</b> at 80 Gb/s have been experimentally demonstrated. Further numerical simulations show that with proper signal and control pulse widths, simultaneous time domain <b>add-drop</b> <b>multiplexing</b> at 160 Gb/s or beyond is possible. Finally, nonlinear pulse transmissions that demonstrate soliton robustness to polarization-mode dispersion (PMD) and intra-channel four-wave mixing (FWM) suppression have been performed. The results show that at least for individual signal pulses, both conventional and dispersion managed (DM) solitons are indeed robust to PMD.

In {{order to}} reduce the number of {{add-drop}} multiplexers (ADMs) in SONET/WDM networks using wavelength <b>add-drop</b> <b>multiplexing,</b> certain graph decompositions can be used to form a “grooming ” that specifies the assignment of traffic to wavelengths.

The number of ADMs required is this drop cost. The existence of such decompositions with minimum cost, when every pair of sites employs no more than 1 7 of the wavelength capacity, is determined within an additive constant. Indeed when the number n of sites satisfies n ≡ 1 (mod 3) and n = 19, the determination is exact; when n ≡ 0 (mod 3), n ≡ 18 (mod 24), and n is large enough, the determination is also exact; and when n ≡ 2 (mod 3) and n is large enough, the gap between the cost of the best construction and the cost of the lower bound is independent of n and does not exceed 4...|$|E

A CO laser beam is scanned along the coupler length inducing a local perturbation to the coupler eigenmodes.

The method is studied theoretically and verified experimentally by characterising different types of fused fibre-couplers namely: half-cycle, full-cycle and non-uniform half-cycle couplers. Add-drop multiplexers based on the inscription of Bragg gratings in the waist of fibre couplers have attracted some attention lately. The correct mapping of the power evolution along the coupler length gives the exact positions in the coupler waist where Bragg gratings should be written in order to obtain optimum add-drop operation.
