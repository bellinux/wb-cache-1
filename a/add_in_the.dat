5|$|Later in the game's development, Chahi added laser pistols, {{including}} the one that Lester carries for several effects. The idea {{was influenced by the}} Star Wars franchise, but added depth to the gameplay by giving the player more options. He also found that repeated laser fire by the enemies helped to enunciate the rhythm of the game. Chahi would later <b>add</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plasma ball that increased the available strategy to players. Several points in the game use elevators or teleporters to move Lester between levels; Chahi had used these instead of stairways, as it was difficult to produce proper animation for these.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the quick}} {{schedule}} of the shoot, Industrial Light & Magic immediately began visual effects work. While the skeletal {{forms of the}} pirates revealed by moonlight take up relatively little screentime, the crew knew their computer-generated forms had to convince in terms of replicating performances and characteristics of the actors, or else the transition would not work. Each scene featuring them was shot twice: a reference plate with the actors, and then without them to <b>add</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> skeletons, an aesthetic complicated by Verbinski's decision to shoot the battles with handheld cameras. The actors also had to perform their scenes again on the motion capture stage. With the shoot only wrapping up four months before release, Verbinski spent 18-hour days on the edit, {{while at the same}} time spending time on 600 effects shots, 250 of which were merely removing modern sailboats from shots.|$|E

25|$|In December 2008, the CTO of Blitz Games {{announced}} that it would bring stereoscopic 3D gaming and movie viewing to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 with its own technology. This was first demonstrated publicly on PS3 using Sony's own technology in January 2009 at the Consumer Electronics Show. Journalists were shown Wipeout HD and Gran Turismo 5 Prologue in 3D as a demonstration of how the technology might work if it is implemented in the future. Firmware update 3.30 officially allowed PS3 titles to be played in 3D, requiring a compatible display for use. System software update 3.50 prepared it for 3D films. While the game itself must be programmed {{to take advantage of the}} 3D technology, titles may be patched to <b>add</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> functionality retroactively. Titles with such patches include Wipeout HD, Pain, and Super Stardust HD.|$|E

At the time, adjusted for inflation, it became the seventh costliest hurricane for the lower 48 United States. [...] Flooding was also reported in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Minor flooding happened {{along the banks of the}} three rivers and more damage was associated with river tributaries.|$|E
500|$|Since Bay shoots all {{his films}} in {{anamorphic}} format, Dark of the Moon representation would be [...] "squeezed in" [...] to distort the image, and ILM would <b>add</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> robots and [...] "un-distort" [...] the image. The ample variety of filming formats used – single camera, 3-D stereo rigs with two cameras, anamorphic and spherical lenses – proved a challenge, specially as ILM had a deadline {{to deliver the}} 2-D plates to the companies responsible for the 3-D conversion. ILM made 600 3-D shots, and Digital Domain had under 200, while Legend3-D, the lead 3-D conversion company of the film, completed 78 minutes of work on the film and finalized the work of approximately 40 minutes of challenging non-visual effects and 38 minutes of visual effects shots.|$|E

500|$|Maeda {{focused on}} making jokes an {{important}} part of Angel Beats!, leading Toba to seek out Seiji Kishi to be the director, because of his experience in directing and his pulling power influence on the staff of P.A.Works, where there are many that are still young. Kishi was ultimately approached by P.A.Works representative director Kenji Horikawa about working on a [...] "school comedy written by a game scenario writer" [...] and was shocked after taking the director's position to discover Maeda was the screenwriter. Kishi commented how, far from just being a comedy, the series contains many different aspects, including flashy action scenes, live musical performances, and drama. Kishi stated that normally he would be hard pressed to cover this range of aspects, but was motivated by Maeda's uncompromising attitude in regards to the script. The decision to <b>add</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> all female band Girls Dead Monster was due to Maeda's intent to add in many different and interesting elements into the series.|$|E

[...] Jeff Comings of the Arizona Daily Star comments that [...] "William Fichtner {{is going to be the}} best actor on any show this season.

He is also the adoptive brother of A, the current Raikage, and as such, is {{expected}} to be the guardian of the village. In battle, he uses its great strength to increase the lethality of his professional wrestling-styled attacks, something [...] Kishimoto's former editor wanted to <b>add</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> series despite him being a ninja. He is also a talented swordsman, capable of using up to seven swords at once and to execute attacks that are unpredictable enough to render Sasuke's Sharingan useless. When Akatsuki attacks him, he pretends to be captured to escape at the cost of losing some of Gyūki's chakra and pursue a career as an enka music singer. However, Killer Bee is brought back to Kumogakure, playing a role in teaching Naruto how to control Kurama's power. He also becomes Naruto's primary partner in the war against the Akatsuki after gaining his brother's approval to fight alongside him, eventually losing Gyūki to Madara. However, Killer Bee survived the extracting by holding on to a piece of Gyūki's tentacle and later becomes the Eight Tails Jinchuriki again in the aftermath of the war. Despite the difficulties in making his lines, as he always speaks in rhymes, Kishimoto wishes to make him a rich character. His voice actor in the Japanese anime is Hisao Egawa, and his English voice actor is Catero Colbert.|$|E

In 1929, Edwin Hubble found evidence for the idea that the universe is expanding.

At the time, it was an ad hoc hypothesis to <b>add</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cosmological constant, as it was only intended to justify one result (a static universe).|$|E
2500|$|The DVD and Blu-ray {{include a}} longer {{version of the}} cartoon short.

When Daffy mistakenly writes the title Gremlins 2 as [...] "Gremlin Stew", Bugs corrects the error. Daffy then attempts to rename the film The Return of Super-Daffy Meets Gremlins 2 Part 6: The Movie, but Bugs rejects this for being too long, changing it back to Gremlins 2 (rendered in the font of the official logo). Daffy then quits his new job and Bugs decides to <b>add</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subtitle, saying it looks [...] "a little skimpy". This material was removed from the film because early audiences expected a live-action film and were bewildered by the lengthy animated sequence.|$|E
2500|$|These chord {{symbols are}} used by musicians {{for a number of}} purposes. Chord-playing instrumentalists in the rhythm section of a jazz quartet, rock or pop band or big band, such as a piano player, Hammond organist or {{electric}} guitarist use these symbols to guide their improvised performance of chord [...] "voicings" [...] and [...] "fills". A rock or pop guitarist or keyboardist might literally play the chords just as indicated (e.g., the C major chord would be played by playing the notes C, E and G at the same time. In jazz, particularly for bands playing music from the 1940s Bebop era or later, a guitarist or keyboardist typically has the latitude to <b>add</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sixth, seventh, and/or ninth, according to her [...] "ear" [...] and judgement. As well, part of the [...] "jazz sound" [...] with chord voicings is to omit the root (a task left to the bass player) and fifth. As such, a jazz guitarist might [...] "voice" [...] the C major chord with the notes E, A and D, which are the third, sixth, and ninth of the chord. The bassist (electric bass or double bass) uses the chord symbols to help improvise a bass line that outlines the chords, often by emphasizing the root and other key scale tones (third, fifth, and in a jazz context, the seventh).|$|E
