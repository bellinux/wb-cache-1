The numerical simulation was done using FLUENT 6. 3 and the experiments were performed by using an air chamber with nozzle, at different <b>approach</b> <b>air</b> velocities to emulate the forced convection heat transfer phenomena. Parameters such as junction temperature, thermal resistance and top surface average Nusselt number have been studied for each package by varying the chip power, spacing between the packages and <b>approach</b> <b>air</b> velocities. The decrease in the junction temperature of the packages {{with the increase in}} <b>approach</b> <b>air</b> velocity is clearly observed. Furthermore, the Nusselt number of PLCC 1 is always slightly higher than PLCC 2 for all approach velocities considered. The results also show that the spacing between packages influences the thermal resistance and average Nusselt number for both packages at a particular <b>approach</b> <b>air</b> velocity. The simulation results obtained are found in satisfactory agreement with the experimental results...|$|R

Excellent agreement is obtained between experimental data and a model that assumes the bubble-water interface is tangentially immobile in its hydrodynamic response.

The Reynolds parallel film model that omits the effects of film deformation predicts results that are qualitatively incorrect...|$|E
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{relates to}} a small-scale air duct of rectangular cross-section with variably sized rectangular apertures pitched evenly along one {{face of the}} duct. Measurements of air velocities were made mainly with a hot-wire anemometer {{and to a lesser}} extent with a pitot-static tube. Details are given of the calibration and use of these instruments together with an outline of the precautions which must be taken to ensure reliability of results. Aperture air flow patterns determined by the use of the hot-wire anemometer were found to be complex and dependent primarily on the interrelated factors of duct gauge static pressure, aperture size, and that fraction of the <b>approaching</b> <b>air</b> which escaped through an aperture. It was established that aperture air volume flow could be determined accurately from a single, half-height, horizontal traverse of an aperture with the hot-wire probe and consequently the expenditure of time and effort required for a multi-row traverse was eliminated. Some evidence was found to support the supposition that variation in the magnitude of the total duct air flow does not affect the proportions into which it is divided by fixed aperture settings. Relationships between non-dimensional parameters were determined from which a method was devised by which the requisite aperture areas associated with specified aperture proportional air flows were predicted...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors influencing the overall performance of cylindrical pin-fin heat sinks is the bypass phenomenon. Depending upon the total bypass area in comparison to the flow area between pin-fins, {{a significant portion of the}} <b>approaching</b> <b>air</b> flow bypasses the heat sink. In this study, the effects of side and top bypass on the hydraulic and thermal performances of a cylindrical pin-fin heat sink will be investigated in laminar forced convection. Theoretical models, based on laws of conservation of mass, momentum and energy, will be developed to predict flow velocity, pressure drop and heat transfer from the heat sink and the bypass regions. These models will help in determining hydraulic and thermal resistances in each region. Both in-line and staggered arrangements are analyzed in this study. Analytical/empirical correlations are used to determine friction factors and heat transfer coefficients in both arrangements. The effects of thermal spreading and joint resistances are neglected in this study.

40|$|Study of {{interaction}} forces between mineral particles and air bubbles {{is a key}} to understanding flotation processes. Measurement of such interaction forces has only recently been made possible with the introduction of the atomic force microscope (AFM) and the colloidal probe technique. Using AFM, interactions between a single particle attached to the AFM cantilever and an air bubble placed on a flat hydrophobic surface are measured in an aqueous environment. Interaction forces prior to rupture of the interfacial water film {{as a function of the}} hydrophobic surface state can be established, as shown in the present study. Additionally, the effect of the hydrodynamic force between <b>approaching</b> <b>air</b> bubble and particle is quantified. Despite the great potential of the AFM colloidal probe technique for studying particle – bubble interactions, several challenges pertaining to the AFM design, experimental procedure, and data analysis have to be addressed due to deformation of the airwater interface.

40|$|The {{soil quality}} {{paradigm}} was originally {{developed in the}} temperate region with the overarching objective of <b>approaching</b> <b>air</b> quality and water quality standards. Although holistic and systems-oriented, soil quality focused principally on issues arising from large nutrient and energy inputs to agricultural lands. Soil quality in the tropics, however, focuses on three overarching concerns: food insecurity, rural poverty and ecosystem degradation. Soil science in the tropics relies heavily on quantitative attributes of soils that can be measured. The emotional, value-laden and ‘‘measure everything’ ’ approach proposed by some proponents of the soil quality paradigm {{has no place in}} the tropics. Soil quality in the tropics must be considered a component of an integrated natural resource management framework (INRM). Based on quantitative topsoil attributes and soil taxonomy, the fertility capability soil classification (FCC) system is probably a good starting point to approach soil quality for the tropics and is widely used. FCC does not deal with soil attributes that can change in less than 1 year, but those that are either dynamic at time scales of years or decades with management, as well as inherent ones that do not change in less than a century. FCC attributes can be positive or negative depending on the land use as well as the temporal and spatial scales in question...|$|E
40|$|The {{state of}} a {{slightly}} supercooled ephemeral cloud {{can be changed}} {{by the presence of}} a few particles capable of catalysing freezing, and potentially result in precipitation. We investigated the atmospheric abundance of particles active as ice nuclei at 88 C (IN 8) {{over the course of a}} year at the high-alpine station Jungfraujoch (3580 m. a. s. l., Switzerland) through the use of immersion freezing assays of particles collected on quartz micro-fibre filters. In addition, we determined IN 8 on a hill in the planetary boundary layer 95 km northwest of Jungfraujoch and in the dust laden Saharan Air Layer reaching Tenerife. Results indicate a strong seasonality of IN 8 at Jungfraujoch. Values were largest during summer (between 1 and 10 m 3) and about two orders of magnitude smaller during winter. Sahara dust events had a negligible influence on IN 8 at Jungfraujoch. Seasonality in the boundary layer was not observed in the upper, but in the lower bound of IN 8 values. ValuesB 1 m 3 were only found on cold winter days, when IN 8 weremore likely to have already been activated and deposited than on warmer days. A good correlation between IN 8 and maximum daily temperature at Jungfraujoch (R 20. 54) suggests IN 8 abundance at Jungfraujoch may be limited most of the year by microphysical processing related to IN activation in <b>approaching</b> <b>air</b> masses...|$|E

40|$|Hydrodynamic {{performance}} of a one-sided wind catcher was investigated by experimental wind tunnel and smoke visualization testing. Wind catchers or what is called Baud-Geers in Persian language was a main component of buildings in central region of Iran and the neighboring countries. A Baud-Geer is a tower used to capture wind from external air stream and induce it into the building {{in order to provide}} natural ventilation and passive cooling. Due to geographical coordinates of the region, wind power and the direction of blowing wind, wind catchers are employed in different heights, cross sections of the air passages and the places and the number of the openings. The one-sided wind catcher has only one channel as a passage of induced air and is often related to the areas where there is prevailing wind. These Baud-Geers are employed to catch the wind blowing at higher elevations and direct it to the building, causing it to leave through windows, doors or other exhausted segments. In this study a 1 : 40 scale model of Kharmani's School Baud-Geer was employed and the induced air flow rate into the test room and the pressure coefficients around all surfaces of its channel were measured for different values of <b>approaching</b> <b>air</b> incident angles. Using measured pressure coefficients, the theoretical values of ventilation air flow were estimated to evaluate ability of simplified models in natural ventilation studies. Due to placing of urban full-scale wind catchers in the boundary layer of atmospheric winds, the effect of this phenomenon was also examined. The experiments were conducted when the wind catcher model with adjoining house was placed in the wake of upstream objects, resembling neighboring buildings. It was found that for an isolated wind catcher model, the maximum efficiency is achieved at zero air incident angle. Also it was concluded that the angle of incidence of the wind, the presence of an upstream building around the structure and blowing of atmospheric wind influence the pressure coefficients, the rate and the direction of ventilation air flow...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{wind tunnel}} and smoke {{visualization}} testing {{was conducted to}} investigate {{the performance of a}} two-sided wind catcher. This type of wind catcher is divided internally into two halves for the purposes of air supply and extract. In this study, the two-sided wind catcher model was constructed of two similar one-sided wind catcher models, which were attached back to back. These one-sided models are 1 : 40 scale models of Kharmani's School wind catcher in the city of Yazd. Experimental investigations were carried out using an open-circuit wind tunnel, and both the induced volumetric airflow into the building and the pressure coefficients around all surfaces of the wind catcher model were measured at various wind angles. Additional experimental tests and computational fluid dynamics simulation of the wind catcher in the wind tunnel were also conducted in order to assess the accuracy of measurement procedures and the uncertainty of experimental results. To evaluate the stack effects on the natural ventilation performance of a two-sided wind catcher system, the results were compared to the corresponding results of a one-sided one. As a result of placing urban full-scale wind catchers in the boundary layer of atmospheric winds, the effect of this phenomenon was also examined experimentally. The experiments were performed when the wind catcher model with an adjoining house was placed in the wake of upstream objects, resembling neighbouring buildings. It was found that for an isolated two-sided wind catcher model, maximum efficiency is achieved at an air incident angle of 90 °, and this can only be explained by the domination of a stack effect rather than dynamic pressure. At this air incident angle the wind catcher efficiency is ˜ 20 per cent more than the one at zero angle. The results show that the <b>approaching</b> <b>air</b> incident angles, the presence of an object upstream of the structure, and the blowing of atmospheric wind, influence phenomena such as pressure coefficients, induced airflow rate, and the airflow pattern of the two-sided wind catcher. The results show the potential of the two-sided wind catcher as a passive device for providing natural ventilation in buildings...|$|E
