We examine the effectiveness of ATP GWR for mitigating MAUP through a simulation study and an empirical study.

Not everyone in rural area may be a member of SHG group and not everyone would like to be a member of such group.

So if the government make it mandatory to be part of SHG as a means to access various service, the process will get corrupted and exploitative.For example, in Tamil Nadu a new group of money lenders (Micro Finance agents) have been formed who act as the intermediary between SHG groups and banks. Through the nexus between banks and micro finance agents, banks try to achieve their targets for financial inclusion, loan payment etc. These agents receive commission from the SHG groups. In order to achieve the targets the banks have given loans arbitrarily to the SHG groups via micro finance agents. These kinds of loans are not used in creation of income generating activity and so there will be default in loan repayment. After this the poor SHG members will be targeted by banks for loan repayment. So it is important to check the misuse of this scheme at the ground level.|$|E

40|$|International audienceFullerene (C 60) <b>aggregation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> in aqueous media require {{considerable}} {{attention in the}} near future due to the heavy use and application of fullerene-based products within the context of nanotechnology. Such intensive development will result in the release of massive amounts of C 60 in aqueous environmental systems in the aggregate form (nC 60). In that sense, the <b>aggregation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> need to be fully determined to better evaluate the environmental fate and behavior of C 60. To fulfil these needs, the aim of this work was to extensively characterize the <b>aggregation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> of fullerene aggregates in aqueous media by asymmetrical flow field fractionation (AF 4) coupled to static light scattering (SLS). We developed a sequential ultrafiltration method that allows the fractionation of the whole nC 60 size distribution into different size classes (1 – 100 – 200 – 450 – 800 nm). Following a preliminary analysis by dynamic light scattering (DLS), we optimized several AF 4 separation methods to allow screening of these colloidal size classes of nC 60 with high efficiency and resolution. The fractal dimension (Df) of this entire size class was characterized directly on-line according to the radius of gyration through a combination of angle-dependent light scattering and fractal dimension analysis. We demonstrate the possible formation and persistence of colloidal populations of nC 60 in aqueous media from a few nanometers up to 800 nm. Df values ranging from 1. 2 to 2. 8, based on the nC 60 colloidal size range, strongly depend on the method of the sample filtration...|$|R

40|$|The recent {{proliferation}} of increasingly capable mobile devices {{has given rise}} to mobile crowd sensing (MCS) systems that outsource the collection of sensory data to a crowd of participating workers that carry various mobile devices. Aware of the paramount importance of effectively incentivizing participation in such systems, the research community has proposed a wide variety of incentive mechanisms. However, different from most of these existing mechanisms which assume the existence of only one data requester, we consider MCS systems with multiple data requesters, which are actually more common in practice. Specifically, our incentive mechanism is based on double auction, and is able to stimulate the participation of both data requesters and workers. In real practice, the incentive mechanism is typically not an isolated module, but interacts with the data <b>aggregation</b> <b>mechanism</b> that aggregates workers' data. For this reason, we propose CENTURION, a novel integrated framework for multi-requester MCS systems, consisting of the aforementioned incentive and data <b>aggregation</b> <b>mechanism.</b> CENTURION's incentive mechanism satisfies truthfulness, individual rationality, computational efficiency, as well as guaranteeing non-negative social welfare, and its data <b>aggregation</b> <b>mechanism</b> generates highly accurate aggregated results.

40|$|The {{automated}} {{synthesis of}} hepta(p-benzamide) hetero sequences on solid support using a modified peptide synthesizer is reported. The oligomers are synthesized from 4 -aminobenzoic acid and 4 -amino- 2 -(hexyloxy) benzoic acid, the latter carrying a solubilizing hexyl side chain. It is known {{from previous studies}} that both the unsubstituted hepta(p-benzamide) and the fully hexyloxy-substituted hepta(p-benzamide) are insoluble in all common organic solvents. Heterosequences in which both types of monomers alternate are, however, soluble in polar organic solvents such as DMSO.

Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) investigations revealed that the gelation was due to the oligomers forming long entangled fibers via a non-covalent <b>aggregation</b> <b>mechanism.</b> We explain these phenomena by a heterosequence triggered switch of <b>aggregation</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The unsubstituted oligomers strongly aggregate via a directional hydrogen-bond driven mechanism which changes to a less directional π-interaction driven <b>aggregation</b> <b>mechanism</b> for the substituted oligomers.

40|$|Roberts, Christopher J. Monoclonal {{antibodies}} (mAbs) {{are one of}} {{the leading}} protein-based drug candidates in the biopharmaceutical industry. The formation of irreversible, non-native protein clusters (hereby called aggregates) is a common degradation route during manufacturing of mAbs and other therapeutic proteins. Aggregation may potentially decrease drug efficacy and jeopardize patient safety. A patient's immune system may mount a response against the therapeutic protein making future treatments ineffective and potentially dangerous. As such, controlling unwanted aggregation is an ongoing and crucial challenge in the development of protein-based therapeutics. The process(es) by which aggregates form or the <b>aggregation</b> <b>mechanism(s)</b> influence the aggregate size distribution, concentration, and structure, all of which may potentially impact drug potency and safety. A deeper understanding of the aggregation process may foster strategies to predict and control aggregation. Thermally induced aggregation of anti-streptavidin immunoglobulin gamma- 1 (AS-IgG 1), a monoclonal antibody, is first mapped over a range of pH and NaCl concentration typical in formulated protein products. <b>Aggregation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are influenced by low-concentration anions, such as acetate and citrate that are common buffer species. The relationships among monomeric protein-protein interactions, aggregate morphology, and <b>aggregation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are explored. Colloidal interactions (i. e. potential of mean force) arguments are discussed in terms of AS-IgG 1 <b>aggregation</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Static light scattering and observed <b>aggregation</b> <b>mechanisms</b> suggest a citrate/acetate specific-ion-effect that cannot be explained with simplified colloidal interactions. The Kirkwood-Buff integral for protein-protein interactions semi-quantitatively predicts how changes in solution conditions change <b>aggregation</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> and may offer a practical tool to capture specific ion effects. IgG 1 aggregation rates are strongly affected by solution pH, ionic strength, and counter-ion species. Additionally, the rates are highly temperature dependent. For example, an increase of 5 degrees C often increases aggregation rates multiple orders of magnitude. As such, it is challenging to compare aggregation rates across a broad range of solution conditions and temperatures. A Parallel Temperature Initial Rates (PTIR) device and method are introduced to accurately and efficiently determine liquid-state degradation rates. IgG 1 aggregation rates determined using PTIR compare well to the traditional isothermal approach. The PTIR method has the advantage of being more sample sparing and providing temperature dependent rates with more statistical certainty. Thermal unfolding and aggregation rates of AS-IgG 1 were determined across multiple pH values and NaCl concentrations using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) or PTIR. AS-IgG 1 aggregation rate coefficients partially collapse to a common profile upon rescaling the incubation temperature by the midpoint unfolding temperature (Tm) determined via DSC. However, the effective activation energies (Ea) depend on solution pH, NaCl concentration, and citrate/acetate buffer species. Acetate vs. citrate specific-ion-effects manifest themselves in Tm and Ea values. The roles of protein-protein interactions and protein unfolding are discussed in the context of AS-IgG 1 aggregation. Osmolytes, such as sucrose, trehalose, and sorbitol, are commonly added to protein solutions to prevent unfolding and aggregation. These additive molecules are thought to compete with water for interactions with proteins resulting in so-called preferential interactions with proteins that can increase or decrease the chemical potential of proteins. However, direct measurements of protein preferential interactions remain challenging. AS-IgG 1 protein-water and protein-osmolyte interactions are determined using precise density measurements of AS-IgG 1 with aqueous solutions of sucrose, trehalose, sorbitol, and PEG (Mn= 6, 000 g/mol). AS-IgG 1 with sucrose and PEG show preferential interactions that depend on osmolyte concentration, which contradicts conventional wisdom for how these molecules interact with proteins in solution. Preferential interactions are compared to protein thermal unfolding using DSC. AS-IgG 1 Tm values increase linearly as a function of sucrose, trehalose, and sorbitol concentrations, and decrease linearly as a function of PEG concentration. Results are compared to available models based on protein solvent exposed surface area (ASA) and discussed in terms of the classical preferential interaction theory. mAb formulations require intermediate to high protein concentrations due to dosing requirements of intravenous administration or subcutaneous injections. Elevated concentrations may promote non-ideal protein-protein and protein-osmolyte interactions. The framework for AS-IgG 1 aggregation developed in earlier sections under dilute protein concentrations is extended to AS-IgG 1 at 30 mg/mL in deuterated water (D 2 O) and in the presence and absence of 0. 15 M (5 w/w %) sucrose. Protein structural techniques are monitored with circular dichroism, second derivative UV absorbance, and Raman spectroscopy. Results are compared to the aggregate morphology, which is monitored with size exclusion chromatography with in-line laser light scattering, dynamic light scattering, and small angle neutron scattering (SANS). Structural changes suggest the nucleation-dominated mechanism (at low pD and ionic strength) has significantly larger structural perturbations, as observed in the disulfide bond conformation, secondary structure, and tyrosine and tryptophan environments. The addition of 0. 15 M sucrose decreases aggregation rates, particularly for the nucleation dominated mechanism, but does not alter <b>aggregation</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> AS-IgG 1 monomer SANS structure factor (S(Q)) remains unchanged with the addition of sucrose, suggesting sucrose does not alter protein-protein interactions. Aggregate morphology is monitored with SANS, and the Kratky plot analysis shows a unique scattering profile for each mechanism regardless of the presence of sucrose. These results are consistent with the current framework that suggests protein-protein interactions mediate <b>aggregation</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Overall, results in this dissertation illustrate the effect of protein-protein, protein-osmolyte, and protein-water interactions on the protein stability and aggregation behavior of AS-IgG 1. Many tools and approaches utilized in this dissertation can be applied to degradation processes of other soft matter systems.
