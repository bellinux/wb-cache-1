40|$|This paper {{reports a}} study of the ability of an {{improved}} LBM in replicating acoustic interaction. With a BGK model with two relaxation times approximating the collison term, the improved LBM is shown not only able to recover the equation of state, but also replicates the specific heat ratio, the fluid viscosity and thermal conductivity correctly. With these improvements, the recovery of full set of unsteady compressible Navier-Stokes equations is possible. Two complex <b>aeroacoustic</b> <b>interaction</b> problems, namely the interaction of three fundamental aeroacoustic pulses and scattering of short wave by a zero circulation vortex, are calculated. The LBM solutions are compared with DNS results. In the first case {{it has been shown that}} the improved LBM is as effective as the DNS in simulating <b>aeroacoustic</b> <b>interaction</b> of three pulses. Both methods obtain essentially same results using same truncated domains. In the scattering problem, LBM is able to replicate the directivity of scattered acoustic wave from the vortex but it does not accurately reproduce the symmetry as calculated using DNS.

In order to understand the mechanism, the acoustic analogy method combined with the RANS-based nonlinear acoustics solver (NLAS) is investigated. The numerical method is firstly evaluated by the experiment data of the classic rod-airfoil model. Compared with the traditional analogy methods, the RANS/NLAS can capture the nonlinear aerodynamic noise more accurately with lower gird requirements. Then different rod-airfoil configurations were simulated to investigate the <b>aeroacoustic</b> <b>interaction</b> effects. The numerical results are in good agreement with those of the earlier experimental research. It is found that the vortex-shedding crash to the airfoil is the main reason for the noise generation which is dependent on the configurations, distance, and flow conditions...|$|E

The predicted unsteady pressure/velocity field is used in an analytically-based scheme for far-field trailing edge noise prediction. A wall resolved implicit LES or so-callednumerical Large Eddy Simulation (NLES) approach is employed to resolve streak-like structure in the near-wall flow regions. The mean and RMS velocity and pressure profile on airfoil surface and in wake are validated against experimental data and computational results from other researchers. The results of the wall-resolved NLES method are very encouraging. The effects of grid-refinement and higher-order numerical scheme on the wall-resolved NLES approach are also discussed...|$|R

This is followed by a description of the Long Penetration Mode (LPM) supersonic underexpanded counterflowing jet phenomenon which has been demonstrated in several wind tunnel tests and modeled in several computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. The authors provide evidence from test and CFD analysis of LPM that indicates that acoustics feedback and fluid interaction seen in LPM are analogous to the <b>aeroacoustics</b> <b>interactions</b> seen in screech jets. Finally, the authors propose applying certain methodologies to LPM which have been developed and successfully demonstrated in the study of screech jets and mechanically induced excitation in fluid oscillators for decades.

A wall-resolved compressible Numerical Large Eddy Simulation (NLES) approach is employed to resolve streak-like structures in the near-wall flow regions. The calculated unsteady pressure/velocity field will be imported into an analyticallybased scheme for far-field trailing-edge noise prediction later. The boundary-layer mean and root-mean-square (rms) velocity profiles, the surface pressure fluctuation over the aerofoil, and the wake flow development are compared with experimental data and previous computational simulations in our research group. It is found that the results from the wall-resolved compressible NLES are very encouraging as they correlate well with test data. The main features of the wall-resolved compressible NLES, as well as the advantages of such compressible NLES over previous incompressible LES performed in our research group, are also discussed.

40|$|A {{computational}} {{flow field}} and predicted jet noise source analysis is presented for asymmetrical fan chevrons on a modern separate flow nozzle at take off conditions. The propulsion airframe aeroacoustic asymmetric fan nozzle is designed with an azimuthally varying chevron pattern with longer chevrons {{close to the}} pylon. A baseline round nozzle without chevrons and a reference nozzle with azimuthally uniform chevrons are also studied. The intent of the asymmetric fan chevron nozzle was to improve the noise reduction potential by creating a favorable propulsion airframe <b>aeroacoustic</b> <b>interaction</b> effect between the pylon and chevron nozzle. This favorable interaction and improved noise reduction was observed in model scale tests and flight test data and {{has been reported in}} other studies. The goal {{of this study was to}} identify the fundamental flow and noise source mechanisms. The flow simulation uses the asymptotically steady, compressible Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes equations on a structured grid. Flow computations are performed using the parallel, multi-block, structured grid code PAB 3 D. Local noise sources were mapped and integrated computationally using the Jet 3 D code based upon the Lighthill Acoustic Analogy with anisotropic Reynolds stress modeling. In this study, trends of noise reduction were correctly predicted. Jet 3 D was also utilized to produce noise source maps that were then correlated to local flow features. The flow studies show that asymmetry of the longer fan chevrons near the pylon work to reduce the strength of the secondary flow induced by the pylon itself, such that the asymmetric merging of the fan and core shear layers is significantly delayed. The effect is to reduce the peak turbulence kinetic energy and shift it downstream, reducing overall noise production. This combined flow and noise prediction approach has yielded considerable understanding of the physics of a fan chevron nozzle designed to include propulsion airframe <b>aeroacoustic</b> <b>interaction</b> effects...|$|E

The amplitude and fundamental frequency of glottal vibration, relative positions of the constriction and obstacle, and the flow rate were varied. Measurements were made from pressure taps in the duct wall and the sound pressure at the open end. The high-pass filtered sound pressure was analyzed {{in terms of the}} magnitude and phase of the turbulence noise envelope. The magnitude and phase of the observed modulation was related to the upstream pressure. The effects of moving the obstacle with respect to the constriction are reported (representative of the teeth and the tongue in a sibilant fricative respectively).

40|$|Acoustic {{measurements}} were obtained in a Langley 14 x 22 foot Subsonic Wind Tunnel {{to study the}} <b>aeroacoustic</b> <b>interaction</b> of 1 / 5 th scale main rotor, tail rotor, and fuselage models. An extensive aeroacoustic data base was acquired for main rotor, tail rotor, fuselage aerodynamic interaction for moderate forward speed flight conditions. The details of the rotor models, experimental design and procedure, aerodynamic and acoustic data acquisition and reduction are presented. The model was initially operated in trim for selected fuselage angle of attack, main rotor tip-path-plane angle, and main rotor thrust combinations. The effects of repositioning the tail rotor in the main rotor wake and the corresponding tail rotor countertorque requirements were determined. Each rotor was subsequently tested in isolation at the thrust and angle of attack combinations for trim. The acoustic data indicated that the noise was primarily dominated by the main rotor, especially for moderate speed main rotor blade-vortex interaction conditions. The tail rotor noise increased when the main rotor was removed indicating that tail rotor inflow was improved with the main rotor present...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{computational}} aeroacoustic modelling {{is complex and}} of practical interest, especially for external flows around arbitrary geometries. <b>Aeroacoustic</b> <b>interactions</b> are more sensitive to errors than aerodynamics, and as such, particular {{care must be taken}} to accurately and efficiently model them. For efficiency, an adaptive multi-resolution grid is used {{to reduce the number of}} grid points while still resolving pertinent scales. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved using the Adaptive Wavelet Collocation Method (AWCM), where wavelet decomposition provides a fast and efficient method for grid compression while maintaining rigorous control over the error. The primary focus of this thesis is developing methodologies for efficient handling of solid obstacles within flows. Proper modelling of arbitrarily shaped obstacles is a prominent issue for fluid simulation, for which there are several approaches. Immersed boundary methods are well suited for use with rectilinear grids as they circumvent the need for a body-conformal mesh and allow curved geometry. The geometry can be efficiently generated through external CAD software, and ray-tracing algorithms used to create accurate masking functions. Ray-tracing is attractive for parallel computational systems as each grid point can be analyzed independently. A masking function provides the geometry definition for volume penalization methods. A new volume penalization method is introduced here to address several difficulties associated with the Brinkman Penalization Method (BPM). Brinkman penalization is generally limited to a select group of fluid problems, and is greatly restricted in the handling and types of boundary conditions. To overcome these issues, a new, characteristic-based volume penalization method is proposed, allowing for general Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions to be defined...|$|R
40|$|The flow/acoustic {{environment}} surrounding {{an engine}} nozzle installed on an airplane, say, under the wing, is asymmetric {{due to the}} pylon, the wing and {{the interaction of the}} exhaust jet with flaps on the wing. However, the conventional chevrons, which are azimuthally uniform serrations on the nozzle lip, do not exploit the asymmetry due to these propulsion airframe <b>aeroacoustic</b> <b>interactions</b> to reduce jet noise. In this pioneering study we use this non-axisymmetry to our advantage and examine if the total jet-related noise radiated to the ground can be reduced by using different types of azimuthally varying chevrons (AVC) which vary the mixing around the nozzle periphery. Several scale models of the isolated nozzle, representative of high bypass ratio engine nozzles, were made with a pylon and azimuthally varying chevrons on both fan and core nozzles to enhance mixing at the top (near the pylon) with less mixing at the bottom (away from the pylon) or vice versa. Various combinations of fan and core AVC nozzles were systematically tested at typical take-off conditions inside a free jet wind-tunnel and, here, in Part 1 we analyze the acoustics results for the isolated nozzle with a pylon, with installation effects reported in Parts 2 and 3. Several interesting results are discovered: amongst the fan AVCs the top-enhanced mixing T-fan chevron nozzle is quieter in combination with any core AVC nozzle when compared to conventional chevrons; however, the bottom-mixing B-fan chevrons, as well as the core AVC nozzles, by themselves, are noisier. Further, the low-frequency source strengths in the jet plume, obtained via phased microphone arrays, also corroborate the far field sound, and for the T-fan chevrons such sources move further downstream than those for baseline or conventional chevron nozzles...|$|R
40|$|Azimuthally varying chevrons (AVC) {{which have}} been uniquely {{tailored}} {{to account for the}} asymmetric propulsion-airframe <b>aeroacoustic</b> <b>interactions</b> have recently shown significant reductions in jet-related community noise at low-speed take-off conditions in scale model tests of coaxial nozzles with high bypass ratio. There were indications that such AVCs may also provide shockcell noise reductions at high cruise speeds. This paper describes the flight test results when one such AVC concept, namely, the T-fan chevrons with enhanced mixing near the pylon, was tested at full-scale on a modern large twin-jet aircraft (777 - 300 ER) with focus on shockcell noise at mid-cruise conditions. Shockcell noise is part of the interior cabin noise at cruise conditions and its reduction is useful from the viewpoint of passenger comfort. Noise reduction at the source, in the exhaust jet, especially, at low frequencies, is beneficial from the perspective of reduced fuselage sidewall acoustic lining. Results are shown in terms of unsteady pressure spectra both on the exterior surface of the fuselage at several axial stations and also microphone arrays placed inside the fuselage aft of the engine. The benefits of T-fan chevrons, with and without conventional chevrons on the core nozzle, are shown for several engine operating conditions at cruise involving supersonic fan stream and subsonic or supersonic core stream. The T-fan AVC alone provides up to 5 dB low-frequency noise reduction on the fuselage exterior skin and up to 2 dB reduction inside the cabin. Addition of core chevrons appears to increase the higher frequency noise. This flight test result with the previous model test observation that the T-fan AVCs have hardly any cruise thrust coefficient loss (< 0. 05 %) make them viable candidates for reducing interior cabin noise in high bypass ratio engines...|$|R

The subsonic transport concepts include tube-and-wing configurations with engines mounted under the wing, over the wing nacelle integration, and a double deck fuselage with engines at a mid-fuselage location. Also included are hybrid wing body aircraft with engines upstream of the fuselage trailing edge. Both advanced direct drive engines and geared turbofan engines are modeled. Recent acoustic experimental information was utilized in the prediction for several key technologies. The 301 -passenger class hybrid wing body with geared ultra high bypass engines is assessed at 40. 3 EPNLdB cumulative below the Stage 4 certification level. Other hybrid wing body and unconventional tube-and-wing configurations reach levels of 33 EPNLdB or more below the certification level. Many factors contribute to the system level result; however, the hybrid wing body in the 301 -passenger class, as compared to a tubeand- wing with conventional engine under wing installation, has 11. 9 EPNLdB of noise reduction due to replacing reflection with acoustic shielding of engine noise sources. Therefore, the propulsion airframe <b>aeroacoustic</b> <b>interaction</b> effects clearly differentiate the unconventional configurations that approach levels close to or exceed the 42 EPNLdB goal...|$|E
40|$|This paper address two {{problems}} of the helicopter flowfield: the aerodynamic and <b>aeroacoustic</b> <b>interaction</b> between a) the main- and the tail rotor and, b) between the main rotor and the fuselage. The first interaction is analyzed with a numerical approach; the main rotor/fuselage interaction study, restricted to aerodynamics, is based on wind tunnel experiments. The rotor interactions studied are for a) a two-blade main- and tail rotor in hover, and b) a four-blade main- and a two-blade tail rotor in climb flight. Parameters varied for the hover configuration are the lateral spacing between the main- and tail rotor {{and the sense of}} tail rotor rotation. The unsteady pressure on the main- and tail rotor blade surface is calculated with a 3 -D unsteady free wake panel method and used as input to a Ffowcs Williams Hawkings-equation based code to evaluate the aeroacoustics. Main rotor effects a significant change in the noise directivity pattern and noise level of the tail rotor. Tail rotor contribution to the total noise dominated during the climb flight. Main rotor/fuselage aerodynamic interaction is analysed from pressure and flow visualization data of wind tunnel tests. Test parameters are rotor thrust and advance ratio.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{optimize}} the noise reduction of perforated liners with bias flow that are applied in jet engines and gas turbines, {{a better understanding of}} the inherent aeroacoustic sound damping mechanisms is necessary. For that purpose, the interaction between sound and flow that is responsible for the damping process needs to be localized, analyzed and balanced. To this aim, laser optical measurements are needed that both acquire the complex sound field and flow field contactlessly. Acoustic particle image velocimetry (A-PIV) and Doppler global velocimetry with sinusoidal frequency modulation (FM-DGV) are applied for this measurement task in comparison. The results show that both methods are advantageous due to their ability for multipoint measurement. In particular, A-PIV offers a wide overview of multiple perforation orifices, whereas FM-DGV satisfies with a high measurement rate of up to 100 kHz allowing the spectral analysis of the velocity field. Both methods were applied at a generic bias flow liner, showing acoustically induced flow velocity oscillations near the rim of the perforation orifices. The spatially resolved oscillation magnitude shows a correlation to the dissipation coefficient and indicates an acoustically induced flow vortex generation and collapse in the vicinity of the liner perforation, respectively, which depends on the relative position to the orifice. As shown in this paper, the measurement methods have the potential to enhance current knowledge about the <b>aeroacoustic</b> <b>interaction</b> at liners, especially in the scenario with both grazing and bias flow.

40|$|Sound {{generation}} and propagation in circular ducts for frequencies beyond the cut-on frequencies of several higher order acoustic modes is investigated. To achieve this, experimental and numerical set-ups are designed {{and used to}} research <b>aeroacoustic</b> <b>interactions</b> between in-duct components and to conceive noise mitigation strategies. Describing in-duct sound for frequencies with a moderate number of propagating modes is important, for example, for improving the noise emission from mid-size ventilation systems. Challenges that are largely unacknowledged in the literature involve efficient test rig design, quantification of limits in the methods, numerical modelling, and development of effective noise mitigation strategies for higher order modes. In this thesis, in-duct sound is mapped {{on a set of}} propagating pressure eigenmodes to describe aeroacoustic components as multi-ports with sound scattering (passive properties) and a source strength (active properties). The presented analysis includes genetic algorithms and Monte Carlo Methods for test rig enhancement and evaluation, multi-port network predictions to identify model limitations, and scale resolving (IDDES) and Linearized Navier Stokes computations for numerical multi-port eduction and the silencer design. It is first shown that test rig optimization improves the quality of multi-port data significantly. Subsequently, measurements on orifice plates are used to test the network prediction model. The model works with high accuracy for two components that are sufficiently separated. For small separations, strong coupling effects are observed for the source strength but not for the scattering of sound. The measurements are used for numerical validation, which gives reliable results for coupled and uncoupled systems. The total acoustic power of tandem orifices is predicted with less than 2 dB deviation and the passive properties for most frequencies with less than 5 % difference from the measurement. The numerical (FEM) models are also used to design a completely integrated silencer for spinning modes that is based on micro-perforated plates and gives broadband attenuation of 3 - 6 dB per duct diameter silencer length. The multi-port method is a powerful tool when describing aerodynamically decoupled in-duct components in the low- to mid-frequency range. Due to a robust passive network prediction, multi-port methods are particular interesting for the design of silencer stages. Furthermore, the demonstrated applicability to numerical data opens novel application areas. QC 20170522 IdealVen...|$|R
40|$|The flow/acoustic {{environment}} {{around the}} jet exhaust of an engine when installed on an airplane, say, under the wing, is highly asymmetric {{due to the}} pylon, the wing and the high-lift devices. Recent scale model tests have shown that such Propulsion Airframe <b>Aeroacoustic</b> (PAA) <b>interactions</b> and the jet mixing noise can be reduced more than with conventional azimuthally uniform chevrons by uniquely tailoring the chevrons to produce enhanced mixing near the pylon. This paper describes the community noise results from a flight test on a large twin-engine airplane using this concept of azimuthally varying chevrons for engines installed under the wing. Results for two different nozzle configurations are described: azimuthally varying "PAA T-fan" chevrons on the fan nozzle with a baseline no-chevron core nozzle and a second with PAA T-fan chevrons with conventional azimuthally uniform chevrons on the core nozzle. We analyze these test results {{in comparison to the}} baseline no-chevron nozzle on both spectral and integrated power level bases. The study focuses on the peak jet noise reduction and the effects at high frequencies for typical take-off power settings. The noise reduction and the absolute noise levels are then compared to model scale results. The flight test results verify that the PAA T-fan nozzles in combination with standard core chevron nozzles can, indeed, give a reasonable amount of noise reduction at low frequencies without high-frequency lift during take-off conditions and hardly any impact on the cruise thrust coefficient...|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{aircraft}} designs such as {{the hybrid}} wing body, in conjunction with open rotor engines, may allow for significant improvements in {{the environmental impact of}} aviation. System noise assessments allow for the prediction of the aircraft noise of such designs while they are still in the conceptual phase. Due to significant requirements of computational methods, these predictions still rely on experimental data to account for the interaction of the open rotor tones with the hybrid wing body airframe. Recently, multiple aircraft system noise assessments have been conducted for hybrid wing body designs with open rotor engines. These assessments utilized measured benchmark data from a Propulsion Airframe <b>Aeroacoustic</b> <b>interaction</b> effects test. The measured data demonstrated airframe shielding of open rotor tonal and broadband noise with legacy F 7 /A 7 open rotor blades. Two methods are proposed for improving the use of these data on general open rotor designs in a system noise assessment. The first, direct difference, is a simple octave band subtraction which does not account for tone distribution within the rotor acoustic signal. The second, tone matching, is a higher-fidelity process incorporating additional physical aspects of the problem, where isolated rotor tones are matched by their directivity to determine tone-by-tone shielding. A case study is conducted with the two methods to assess how well each reproduces the measured data and identify the merits of each. Both methods perform similarly for system level results and successfully approach the experimental data for the case study. The tone matching method provides additional tools for assessing the quality of the match to the data set. Additionally, a potential path to improve the tone matching method is provided...|$|E
40|$|Propulsion {{airframe}} <b>aeroacoustic</b> (PAA) <b>interactions</b> arise due to {{the manner}} in which an engine is installed on the airframe and lead to an asymmetry in the flow/acoustic environment, for example, for under-the-wing installations {{due to the}} pylon, the wing and the high-lift devices. In this work we study how we can affect these PAA interactions to reduce the overall jet-related installed noise by tailoring the chevron shapes on fan and core nozzles in a unique fashion {{to take advantage of this}} asymmetry. In part 1 of this trio of papers we introduced the concept of azimuthally varying chevrons (AVC) and showed how some types of AVCs can be more beneficial than the conventional chevrons when tested on "isolated" scaled nozzles inclusive of the pylon effect. In this paper, we continue to study the effect of installing these AVC nozzles under a typical scaled modern wing with high-lift devices placed in a free jet. The noise benefits of these installed nozzles, as well as their installation effects are systematically studied for several fan/core AVC combinations at typical take-off conditions with high bypass ratio. We show, for example, that the top-enhanced mixing T-fan AVC nozzle (with enhanced mixing near the pylon and less mixing away from it) when combined with conventional chevrons on the core nozzle is quieter than conventional chevrons on both nozzles, and hardly produces any high-frequency lift, just as in the isolated case; however, its installed nozzle benefit is less than its isolated nozzle benefit. This suppression of take-off noise benefit under installed conditions, compared to its isolated nozzle benefit, is seen for all other chevron nozzles. We show how these relative noise benefits are related to the relative installation effects of AVCs and baseline nozzles...|$|R
40|$|Propulsion {{airframe}} <b>aeroacoustic</b> (PAA) <b>interactions,</b> {{resulting from}} the integration of engine and airframe, lead to azimuthal asymmetries in the flow/acoustic field, e. g., due to {{the interaction between the}} exhaust jet flow and the pylon, the wing and its high-lift devices, such as, flaps and flaperons. In the first two parts of this series we have presented experimental results which show that isolated and installed nozzles with azimuthally varying chevrons (AVCs) can reduce noise more than conventional chevrons when integrated with a pylon and a wing with flaps at take-off conditions. In this paper, we present model-scale experimental results for the reduction of jet-flap interaction noise source due to these AVCs and document the PAA installation effects (difference in noise between installed and isolated nozzle configurations) at both approach and take-off conditions. It is found that the installation effects of both types of chevron nozzles, AVCs and conventional, are reversed at approach and take-off, in that there is more installed noise reduction at approach and less at take-off compared to that of the isolated nozzles. Moreover, certain AVCs give larger total installed noise benefits at both conditions compared to conventional chevrons. Phased microphone array results show that at approach conditions (large flap deflection, low jet speed and low ambient Mach number), chevrons gain more noise benefit from reducing jetflap interaction noise than they do from quieting the jet plume noise source which is already weak at these low jet speeds. In contrast, at take-off (small flap deflection, high jet speed and high ambient Mach number) chevrons reduce the dominant jet plume noise better than the reduction they create in jet-flap interaction noise source. In addition, fan AVCs with enhanced mixing near the pylon are found to reduce jet-flap interaction noise better than conventional chevrons at take-off...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of a vortex with a lifting surface occurs in many aerodynamic systems, and can induce significant airloads and radiate impulsive noise. Yet {{due to their}} complex nature, the ability to accurately model the important flow physics and noise radiation characteristics of these interactions in realistic situations has remained elusive. This work examines two cases of vortex-lifting surface interactions by enhancing the capabilities of a high fidelity flow solver. This flow solver utilises high spatial discretisation accuracy with a 5 th order accurate WENO scheme, and overset meshes to accurately resolve the formation, evolution and {{interaction of}} a tip vortex using an inviscid approximation of the fluid. An existing computational infrastructure is further developed and applied to analyse blade-vortex interactions that occur on a helicopter rotor. An idealised interaction is studied, where an independently generated vortex interacts with a rotor. It is found that through the employment of adequate spatial and temporal resolution, the current methodology is capable of resolving the important details of the interaction over a range of vortex-blade miss distances. A careful study of the spatial and temporal resolution requirements is conducted {{to ensure that the}} computed results converge to the correct physical solution. It is also demonstrated that a linear acoustic analysis can accurately predict the acoustic energy propagated from these interactions to the far-field, provided the blade surface pressures are accurately computed. The methodology is then used to study an idealised propeller wake-wing interaction, which occur behind a tractor mounted turboprop. A computationally efficient method of modelling the wake-wing interaction is developed and the computed surface pressures of the interaction are confirmed to agree well with the experimental data. The analysis is coupled to an optimisation algorithm to determine a novel wing design, and it is found that significant drag reductions can be achieved with small changes in the twist distribution of the wing. This work confirms that by using a combination of strategies including efficient grids, high order accurate numerical discretisations and a flexible software infrastructure, high fidelity methods can indeed be used to accurately resolve practical cases of vortex-lifting surface interactions in detail while being feasible in a design setting. The airloads and <b>aeroacoustics</b> from these <b>interactions</b> can be accurately predicted, thus confirming that with the modern advances in computing and algorithms, high fidelity methodologies such as those presented in this thesis {{are in a position to}} be used to gain a deep understanding of the relevant flow physics and noise radiation patterns, and their impact on aircraft design.

40|$|Advanced {{propeller}} {{propulsion systems}} potentially provide {{a significant reduction}} in fuel burn compared to traditional turbofans. An alternative to the conventional aft-fuselage mounted pusher layout is the horizontal tailplane-tip mounted tractor propeller concept. The aim of this thesis is an experimental investigation of the <b>aeroacoustic</b> and aerodynamic <b>interaction</b> effects of the tailplane-tip mounted tractor propeller configuration, including the effects of elevator deflections. The experimental study was conducted at TU Delftâ€™s Low Speed Laboratory in the Vertical Tunnel and the Low Turbulence Tunnel with two different models. From the aeroacoustic study, it was concluded that the installation of the pylon behind the propeller affects both the directivity and the tonal levels of the propeller noise field, with the broadband acoustic levels remaining unchanged. It was determined that the overall sound pressure level (SPL) across the range of directivity angles considered is inversely proportional to the propeller-pylon spacing. For a spacing of 50 % propeller diameter, the overall SPL was comparable to the case of the isolated propeller. A unique characteristic of installation of the pylon was the development of a trough in the directivity for an observer position in the pylon plane caused by the cancelling of the steady noise field by unsteady blade loading noise. This arises due to inflow distortion due to potential effects caused by the pylon. This unsteady blade loading {{is a function of the}} propeller-pylon spacing, and hence the levels in the trough decrease with decreasing propeller-pylon spacing. For directivity angels in the pylon plane, for spacing below 30 % of the propeller diameter, the unsteady loading is further influenced by the elevator deflection and was the main mechanism of the interaction noise. For propeller-pylon spacingâ€™s above 30 % of the propeller diameter, the interaction of the slipstream (either the propeller noise field, or the slipstream impingement) with the elevator was determined to be the main interaction mechanism. From the PIV and performance evaluations, it was concluded that for the given propeller-pylon spacing (43 % and 85 % propeller diameter), there was indeed negligible upstream interaction effect due to the trailing pylon, including the case of the deflected elevator Pylon loads obtained from an external balance showed that for symmetric inflow conditions, operation of the thrusting propeller increased elevator effectiveness by 20 % compared to the case with no propeller present. A numerical simulation using XROTOR was used for the validation of the test data and had a relative error of 3 % with the experimentally evaluated propeller thrust for the lowest advance ratio. A slipstream propagation model based on the computed propeller induced velocities showed acceptable trends when compared to the experimentally determined induced propeller velocity profiles. However, the numerical model overpredicts the velocity profile in the tip region, owing to the toolâ€™s limitation in predicting stall at the blade tip. A VLM based numerical analysis which included the effects of the propeller slipstream, was able to predict the pylon lift to within 3 % of the lift computed from the surface pressure measurements, but failed in the prediction of the drag of the model.
