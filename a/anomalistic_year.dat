2500|$|Swiss {{astronomer}} Louis Jacot (in 1951, 1962, 1981), like Weisacker and Ter Haar, {{continued the}} Cartesian idea of vortices but proposed {{a hierarchy of}} vortices or vortices within vortices, i.e., a lunar system vortex, a Solar System vortex, and a galactic vortex. [...] He put forward the notion that planetary orbits were in spirals, not circles or ellipses so recognized that the Solar System is in expansion (planets {{move away from the}} Sun). It is a known fact that planetary orbits are not fixed circles but are slowly spiraling outwards, Earth's <b>anomalistic</b> <b>year</b> (a planetary orbit measured from perihelion to perihelion) being 4 min., 44 sec. longer than the sidereal year (a planetary orbit measured relative to the background stars), however, the accepted explanation is the gravitational displacement on any particular, given planet by the other planets, not a vortex. Besides the expansion of the Solar System, Jacot also proposed the expansion of galaxies (stars move away from the hub), [...] and that moons move away from their planets.|$|E

5000|$|On both Earth and Mars, {{these two}} precessions are in {{opposite}} directions, and therefore add, {{to make the}} precession cycle between the [...] tropical and <b>anomalistic</b> <b>years</b> 21,000 years on Earth and 56,600 years on Mars.|$|R
40|$|Higher {{resolution}} time-stratigraphic records suggest {{correlation of}} lower frequency paleoclimatic events with Milankovitch obliquity/precessional cycles and of higher frequency events with the evidently resonance-related Pettersson maximum tidal force (MTF) model. Subsequently published records, mainly pollen, seemingly confirm that atmospheric resonances may have modulated past climatic changes in phase with average MTF cycles of 1668, 1112, and 556 years, as calculated in <b>anomalistic</b> <b>years</b> from planetary movements by Stacey. Stacey accepts Pettersson's dating of AD 1433 (517 YBP) {{for the last}} major perihelian spring tide based solely on calculations of moon- and earth-orbital relations to the sun. Use of AD 1433 as an origin for the tidal resonance model seemingly continues to provide a best fit for the timing of cyclical patterns in the presented paleoclimate time series...|$|R
25|$|Hipparchic cycle: Not a {{noteworthy}} eclipse cycle, but Hipparchus constructed it to closely match {{an integer}} number of synodic and <b>anomalistic</b> months, <b>years</b> (345), and days. By comparing his own eclipse observations with Babylonian records from 345 years earlier, he could verify {{the accuracy of}} the various periods that the Chaldeans used.|$|R
5000|$|A {{study of}} {{temperature}} records {{over the past}} 300 years [...] suggests that the seasonal year is governed by the <b>anomalistic</b> <b>year</b> rather than the tropical year.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>anomalistic</b> <b>year</b> is {{the time}} taken for the Earth to {{complete}} one revolution with respect to its apsides. The orbit of the Earth is elliptical; the extreme points, called apsides, are the perihelion, where the Earth is closest to the Sun (January 3 in 2011), and the aphelion, where the Earth is farthest from the Sun (July 4 in 2011). The <b>anomalistic</b> <b>year</b> is usually defined as the time between perihelion passages. Its average duration is [...] days (365 d 6 h 13 min 52.6 s) (at the epoch J2011.0).|$|E
50|$|As on Earth, {{there is}} a second form of precession: the point of {{perihelion}} in Mars's orbit changes slowly, causing the <b>anomalistic</b> <b>year</b> to differ from the sidereal year. However, on Mars, this cycle is 83,600 years rather than 112,000 years as on Earth.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first is}} {{described}} in Ptolemy's Almagest IV.2. Hipparchus constructed a cycle by multiplying by 17 a cycle due to the Chaldean astronomer Kidinnu, so as to closely match an integer number of synodic months (4267), <b>anomalistic</b> months (4573), <b>years</b> (345), and days (126007 + about 1 hour); it is also close to a half-integer number of draconic months (4630.53...), so it is an eclipse cycle. By comparing his own eclipse observations with Babylonian records from 345 years earlier, he could verify {{the accuracy of the}} various periods that the Chaldean astronomers used.|$|R

50|$|This {{suggestion}} is surprising because the seasons have been {{thought to be}} governed by the tilt of the Earth's axis (see Effect of sun angle on climate). The two types of years differ by a mere 4 days over 300 years, so Thompson's result may not be significant. However, the result is not unreasonable. The seasons can {{be considered to be}} an oscillating system driven by two inputs with slightly different frequencies: the total input of energy from the sun varies with the <b>anomalistic</b> <b>year,</b> while the distribution of this energy between the hemispheres varies with the tropical year. In other physical situations, oscillating systems driven by two similar frequencies can latch onto either one. One point that must be considered is that the oscillation arising from the tilt of the axis is much greater than that arising from the distance of the sun.|$|E
