500|$|Brener noted when Mars' audio {{infrastructure}} evolved substantially, when Berry {{took over}} the only model he would use was Sennheiser wireless. The latter's opinion was respected and trusted due to his experience in working [...] with Beyoncé, Weezer <b>and</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> bands. Nevertheless, Berry and Brener tried several capsule and transmitter combinations before [...] "settling" [...] with a SKM 5200 handheld transmitter and a MD 5235 capsule. Berry stated that Mars is not only involved with him and Brener [...] "on the way things sound", but also [...] "has very clear ideas on what he wants and what he expects". Regardless of the place where Mars is going to perform he will only use Sennheiser; [...] "there is no debating [...] he wants Sennheiser, and that's what he's going to get", says Berry. As {{for the rest of}} the vocals and horns, the wireless system has ten channels of Sennheiser EM 3732-II receivers, seven SKM 5200-II transmitters with MD 5235 capsules and three SK 5212-II bodypack transmitters.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Rolling Stone, Marisa G. Muller {{noted that}} Gaga {{spoke of the}} artists and the {{personnel}} involved with the event continuously throughout the night, and [...] " [...] being {{more than an hour}} late, Gaga made her tight-knit audience of little monsters feel special... Sober, Gaga was still at her outlandish peak." [...] David Drake of Complex found the ArtRave to be quite a production but like all things Gaga does he found it to be a [...] "blend of the high-brow and the trashy, depth and superficiality, the thoughtful and the impulsive, <b>and</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> contradictions that make you think about the nature of philosophy and life and art." [...] He gave a positive review of the main show, praising the sound system, the performances of [...] "Gypsy" [...] and [...] "Do What U Want", and deduced that: [...] "Perhaps this kind of ambition is music's future, at least for a certain breed of artist. Although Artpop doesn't sound retro per se, Lady Gaga's project as a whole does feel like a reaction to the idea that as far as the music goes, there's nothing new under the sun." ...|$|E
500|$|WWE SmackDown! Shut Your Mouth and WWE SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain {{received}} more positive reviews from both IGN and GameSpot, {{both of whom}} cited the expanded season mode as an improvement, although flaws were still visible in the mode. It improved from the previous three WWF SmackDown! games, as {{it was written by}} actual WWE storyline writers. Both games also featured generic music, though the quality of it had improved. Shut Your Mouth featured little improvement to the commentary, which was then removed completely from Here Comes the Pain. WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW received a more positive review than previous games, as GameShark stated that it was [...] "a wonderful new edition to the SmackDown! family, serving up slick graphics, vastly enhanced gameplay, <b>and</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> bells and whistles that make the whole package shine." [...] WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2006 received a positive review and a 9.2/10 rating by IGN due to the additions of matches, the General Manager mode, and the ability to defend championships in exhibition mode. WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2008 {{received more}} negative reviews due to lack of an appealing season mode and little improvement of features, with the exceptions of the [...] "Ultimate Control moves," [...] "Struggle system," [...] and the ECW Extreme Rules matches.|$|E

6000|$|At {{once the}} {{umbrella}} {{rose into the}} air, slowly at first, but quickly gathering speed. Trot and Button-Bright held fast to the ropes and were carried along very easily and comfortably. It seemed scarcely a minute before {{they were in the}} town, and when the umbrella set them down {{just in front of the}} store--for it seemed to know just where they wanted to go--a wondering crowd gathered around them. Trot ran in and changed the yarn, while Button-Bright stayed outside and stared at the people who stared at him. They asked questions, too, wanting to know what sort of an aeroplane this was and where his power was stored <b>and</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> things, but the boy answered not a sound.

Most {{likely they are}} hospitable; almost all these {{wandering}} tribes are. If one had luck one might get befriended and stick for a time {{to one of these}} tribes in their wanderings south, and then get hold of some other people, and so get passed on. There can't be anything impossible in it, Alexis. We know that travellers have made their way through Africa alone. Mungo Park did, <b>and</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> people have done so, and some of the negro tribes are, according to all accounts, a deal more savage than the Asiatic tribes. Once among them it doesn't much matter which way one goes, whether it is east to China or west to Persia." ...|$|E

60|$|Every day, for a week, Mr. Chipperton hired a one-horse barouche, {{and he and}} {{his wife}} and {{daughter}} rode over the island. Rectus and I walked, and we saw a good deal more than they did. Corny told us this, the first walk she took with us. We went down a long, smooth, white road that led between the queer little cottages of the negroes, where the cocoa-nut and orange trees and the bananas and sappadilloes, <b>and</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> trees and bushes stood up around the houses just as proudly as if they were growing on ten-thousand-dollar lots. Some of these trees had the most calcareous foundations anybody ever saw. They grew almost out of the solid rock. This {{is probably one of the}} most economical places in the world for garden mould. You couldn't sweep up more than a bucketful out of a whole garden, and yet the things grow splendidly. Rectus said he supposed the air was earthy.|$|E
60|$|A {{nice man}} was Cap'n Bill, and Trot knew he always liked to explain {{everything}} {{so she could}} fully understand it. The aged sailor {{was not a very}} tall man, and some people might have called him chubby, or even fat. He wore a blue sailor shirt with white anchors worked on the corners of the broad, square collar, and his blue trousers were very wide at the bottom. He always wore one trouser leg over his wooden limb and sometimes it would flutter in the wind like a flag because it was so wide and the wooden leg so slender. His rough kersey coat was a pea-jacket and came down to his waistline. In the big pockets of his jacket he kept a wonderful jackknife, and his pipe and tobacco, and many bits of string, and matches and keys <b>and</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> things. Whenever Cap'n Bill thrust a chubby hand into one of his pockets, Trot watched him with breathless interest, for she never knew {{what he was going to}} pull out.|$|E

For nearer or remoter neighbors, the Tower has the Devil's Bake Oven--so called, perhaps, because it does not powerfully resemble anybody else's bake oven; and the Devil's Tea Table--this latter a great smooth-surfaced mass of rock, with diminishing wine-glass stem, perched some fifty or sixty feet above the river, beside a beflowered and garlanded precipice, and sufficiently like a tea-table to answer for anybody, Devil or Christian. Away down the river we have the Devil's Elbow and the Devil's Race-course, <b>and</b> <b>lots</b> <b>of</b> <b>other</b> property of his which I cannot now call to mind.|$|E
