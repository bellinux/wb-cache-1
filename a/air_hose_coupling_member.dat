50|$|The air {{pressure}} system on a tire changer provides {{the air to}} inflate tires mounted on wheels. The {{air pressure}} system consists of 4 components: <b>air</b> <b>hose,</b> <b>air</b> inflation gauge, inflation pedal and manual pressure bleed valve. The <b>air</b> <b>hose</b> is located {{near the top of}} the tire changer, and it allows compressed air to travel into the tire. A specialized end is used on the <b>air</b> <b>hose</b> to clamp firmly onto valve stems of the wheels. The air inflation gauge displays the air pressure within the tire when the <b>air</b> <b>hose</b> is connected to the valve stem. The air inflation gauge displays the pressure in pounds per square inch (psi). Directly below the <b>air</b> <b>hose</b> on the side of the tire changer is the inflation pedal that enables the inflation of the tire. When the inflation pedal is raised, a burst of air is released from valves next to each rim clamp toward the bottom bead of the tire to help with inflation. The manual bleed valve is located next to the <b>air</b> <b>hose</b> and <b>air</b> inflation gauge. The manual bleed valve allows the manual release of air pressure from tire.|$|R
