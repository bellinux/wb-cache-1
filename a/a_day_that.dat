5|$|She rekindled {{her studies}} {{too late in}} life to become a truly {{exceptional}} dancer, but she obsessively insisted on grueling daily practice (up to eight hours <b>a</b> <b>day)</b> <b>that</b> contributed to her subsequent physical and mental exhaustion. In September 1929, she was {{invited to join the}} ballet school of the San Carlo Opera Ballet Company in Naples, but, as close as this was to the success she desired, she declined the invitation. While the public still believed the Fitzgeralds to live a life of glamor, friends noted that the couple's partying had somewhere gone from fashionable to self-destructive—both had become unpleasant company.|$|E
5|$|This {{episode was}} written by Glee co-creator Ian Brennan, who also made his directorial debut in this episode. While the first scenes for the episode were shot on March 30, 2012, on <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>that</b> also saw scenes shot for the {{previous}} two episodes, shooting on the episode began in earnest on Monday, April 9, 2012, {{after the completion of}} the prior episode {{at the end of the}} week before. Filming continued into the following week at least through Wednesday, April 18, 2012, by which point the next episode had begun shooting in parallel.|$|E
5|$|Mired in {{economic}} problems, Cuba was {{aided by the}} election of socialist and anti-imperialist Hugo Chávez to the Venezuelan Presidency in 1999. Castro and Chávez developed a close friendship, with the former acting as a mentor and father-figure to the latter, and together they built an alliance that had repercussions throughout Latin America. In 2000, they signed an agreement through which Cuba would send 20,000 medics to Venezuela, in return receiving 53,000 barrels of oil per day at preferential rates; in 2004, this trade was stepped up, with Cuba sending 40,000 medics and Venezuela providing 90,000 barrels <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> <b>That</b> same year, Castro initiated Misión Milagro, a joint medical project which aimed to provide free eye operations on 300,000 individuals from each nation. The alliance boosted the Cuban economy, and in May 2005 Castro doubled the minimum wage for 1.6 million workers, raised pensions, and delivered new kitchen appliances to Cuba's poorest residents. Some economic problems remained; in 2004, Castro shut down 118 factories, including steel plants, sugar mills and paper processors to compensate for a critical shortage of fuel.|$|E

5|$|No part of M-134 {{is listed}} on the National Highway System, a system of roadways {{important}} to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. In 2009, the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) conducted a survey to determine the traffic volume along the highway, reported using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). The department determined that the highest count was the 3,595vehicles <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>that</b> used the highway west of the M-129 junction in Cedarville; the lowest counts were 608vehicles daily between the M-48 junction and the De Tour village limits. On the island, 667vehicles use M-134 daily. According to tourism officials in the area, over 100,000vehicles per year are transported round trip on the ferry with almost twice as many additional passengers.|$|E

25|$|By 1667 Charles {{had run out}} of money. He {{was forced}} to lay up his fleet, giving free rein to the Dutch blockade.

25|$|As {{the poem}} by Robert Herrick records, {{the eve of}} Candlemas was the day on which Christmas decorations of greenery were removed from people's homes; for traces of berries, holly and so forth will bring death among the {{congregation}} before another year is out.

25|$|Six-day cycle races {{involving}} {{more than}} one rider {{grew out of the}} 19th-century enthusiasm for endurance and other novelty competitions. A promoter at the Agricultural Hall held a six-day walking contest in April 1877. It was enough of a success for another to be held the following year. That inspired another organiser, name no longer known, to organise a six-day race in the same hall but for cyclists, also in 1878. He hoped to attract the crowd of 20,000 <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>that</b> had turned out for the walkers.|$|E
25|$|Following his defeat, 'Ali {{made his}} way to the Nahr al-Sidrah, in the area of the Dujayl south of Suq al-Ahwaz, where he wrote to the Zanj leader asking for reinforcements. Thirteen barges with several contingents of Zanj {{soldiers}} were sent to him, upon which 'Ali decided to advance again against Ibn Muflih. The two armies met, but refrained from fighting for <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> <b>That</b> night, 'Ali took several of his most trusted troops and {{made his way}} to the rear of Ibn Muflih's camp, where he launched a surprise attack. The government army was defeated and Ibn Muflih retreated, abandoning four of his barges in the process.|$|E
25|$|By midnight all was quiet, but {{the ship}} was still labouring to rejoin {{the main part of}} the convoy. Steaming on slowly, Saturday turned into Sunday. Sunday 26 October would be <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>that</b> the crew of the English Trader would never forget. Between 1 am and 1.30 am, {{the ship was}} {{struggling}} against a strong ebbing tide, which in turn forced her dangerously close to the sandbanks of Hammond Knoll. At around 1.45 am the crew felt a slight jolt followed by a more severe jolt. This flung the ship forward followed by loud grinding, crunching and scraping of metal. Then there was silence. The ship had run aground on Hammond Knoll.|$|E

25|$|The film then {{depicts the}} grandfather's {{struggle}} {{to accept the}} reality {{that the only way}} to save his grandson is at the cost of his eyesight. He tries to come to terms with the situation and his personal agony is shown in scenes, like taking second opinion, explaining his grandson the reality and his desire to show him everything possible before his grandson loses his eyesight. For some reason, the surgery has to be postponed by <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> <b>That</b> afternoon, grandfather and grandson disappear from the hospital ward and a frantic search follows. Confronted by an angry surgeon on their return, the grandfather states quite simply that he wanted to show Parshya the sights of the city for one last time.|$|E

25|$|A {{familiar}} {{sight in}} several Asian countries is paddy laid {{out to dry}} along roads. However, in most countries the bulk of drying of marketed paddy takes place in mills, with village-level drying being used for paddy to be consumed by farm families. Mills either sun dry or use mechanical driers or both. Drying has {{to be carried out}} quickly to avoid the formation of molds. Mills range from simple hullers, with a throughput of a couple of tonnes <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> <b>that</b> simply remove the outer husk, to enormous operations that can process 4,000 tonnes a day and produce highly polished rice. A good mill can achieve a paddy-to-rice conversion rate of up to 72% but smaller, inefficient mills often struggle to achieve 60%. These smaller mills often do not buy paddy and sell rice but only service farmers who want to mill their paddy for their own consumption.|$|E

25|$|All in all, Bannerman made six {{trips to}} England, and {{he enjoyed the}} actual touring of the Mother Country {{just as much as}} he did playing cricket there; indeed, many of his most memorable {{experiences}} occurred in places where his contribution on the field was negligble. He played in three of the most historically important matches of his era - the match with the M.C.C. in 1878 that the Australians won in less than <b>a</b> <b>day,</b> <b>that</b> first-ever Test in 1880 and the Ashes-igniter at the Oval in 1882, in which he had one of the better games amongst the batsmen, scoring nine for a strike-rate of 10.34 in the first innings, and a boundary-less thirteen from an hour and ten minutes in the second, holding up one end while Massie launched his famous assault from the other.|$|E
25|$|The Science and Engineering {{building}} {{received a}} LEED Silver rating in March 2009. SEB achieved this rating by using recycled glass, steel, concrete, and wood. More than 60% of the leftover construction materials were recycled. The roof of SEB {{was made to}} reflect 92 percent of sunlight. This reduces the amount of heat absorbed into the building and therefore, reduces energy needed to cool the building. Incoming air to SEB is also pre-cooled through evaporation so the need for air conditioning is reduced. High performance window glazing also allows light to come in while keeping the building insulated. Occupancy sensors allow lights to automatically turn off when a room is not occupied, saving electricity. Low-flow sinks, toilets, and showers, {{as well as a}} drip irrigation system for the native desert landscape reduces water usage by 42%. SEB also uses a reclaimed water system that captures wastewater, providing 750 gallons of water <b>a</b> <b>day</b> <b>that</b> is used to flush toilets.|$|E
25|$|On {{the second}} day, Alex Gidman posted 115 and Steve Adshead 73 to lift Gloucestershire from 191 for 6 to 363. Hampshire then {{collapsed}} again, falling to 23 for 3 (including the wicket of nightwatchman Chris Tremlett) before John Crawley and Shane Watson rescued {{them with a}} 120-run partnership, as spinners Bandara and Ian Fisher toiled away to little effect. Hampshire eventually declared on 388 for 7, with four of their batsmen passing fifty, which left Gloucestershire 411 to win in <b>a</b> <b>day.</b> <b>That</b> never looked likely, but attritional cricket from Ramnaresh Sarwan and Matt Windows lifted Gloucestershire to 156 for 2, and then Gidman came in to add a further 39 for the fourth wicket. However, Shane Watson got a vital breakthrough with the wicket of Gidman, Shaun Udal unleashed a spell of furious off-spin on the tail, taking six for 61, and Gloucestershire were bowled out with an hour to spare.|$|E
