5|$|In the 1980s, a {{minority}} of the club's supporters had {{a reputation as one of}} Britain's most prominent casuals groups, the Aberdeen Soccer Casuals. The rise of the Aberdeen Casuals coincided with the most successful period in the club's history, and has been chronicled in more than one published account. Whilst numbers have steadily declined with the introduction of Football Banning Orders preventing hooligans from travelling to games, the Aberdeen Casuals still appear <b>at</b> <b>big</b> fixtures often away from home and in the UEFA Europa League. There were clashes at both fixtures against FC Groningen in 2014, as well as 13 arrests after violent clashes with Dundee United fans at a game in December 2015.|$|E
5|$|Josephine Ledesma, from Austin, Texas, was 24 {{when the}} war broke out and worked as an {{airplane}} mechanic from 1942 to 1944. When her husband, Alfred, was drafted she decided to volunteer to work as an airplane mechanic. Even though the army waived her husband's duty, she was sent to train at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas, where {{she was the only}} Mexican-American woman on the base. After her training, she was sent to Bergstrom Air Field. There were two other women, both non-Hispanic, at Bergstrom Air Field, and several more in Big Spring, all working in the sheet metal department. <b>At</b> <b>Big</b> Spring, she was the only woman working in the hangar. She worked as a mechanic between from 1942 to 1944.|$|E
5|$|More recently, it {{has been}} {{suspected}} that the western cicada killer represents more than one species. It co-occurs with the eastern cicada killer (S.speciosus) and Pacific cicada killer (S.convallis) <b>at</b> <b>Big</b> Bend National Park in Texas. There the three wasps hunt and nest in the same locales, and the eastern and western cicada killers hunt the same cicada species. Analysis of mitochondrial DNA showed that the western cicada killer contains two divergent clades, which may represent distinct species. The two clades appeared to be split by the Rocky Mountains, with one occurring mainly {{to the south and}} east, the other to the west.|$|E

5|$|Scott {{was one of}} 37 men {{who founded}} the Kentucky Society for the Promotion of Useful Knowledge in 1787. Although he did not {{participate}} in any of the ten statehood conventions that sought to separate Kentucky from Virginia, he supported the idea in principle. When Woodford County was formed from the part of Fayette County that included Scott's fledgling settlement, Scott declined appointment as the new county's lieutenant. He did, however, consent to be a candidate to represent the county in the Virginia House of Delegates. During his single term, he served on the committee on privileges and election and on several special committees, including one that recommended that President George Washington supply a military guard <b>at</b> <b>Big</b> Bone Lick to facilitate the establishment of a saltworks there.|$|E
5|$|Scott's Wabash Campaign was well-received both in Kentucky {{and by the}} Washington administration. On June 24, 1791, Arthur St. Clair {{encouraged}} the Board of War to organize a second expedition into the Wabash region and to remove their outposts along the Ohio River to free up manpower and finances {{as a prelude to}} his larger invasion. Scott questioned the wisdom of removing the outposts and convinced his fellow members of the Board of War to retain one <b>at</b> <b>Big</b> Bone Lick and one guarding an ironworks {{at the mouth of the}} Kentucky River. His instincts later proved to be right; a month later, Indian raiders tried to deny the frontier settlers access to salt by capturing Big Bone Lick, but they were repelled by the militia stationed at the outpost there. Scott also did not believe that 500 men, St. Clair's requested number for the second Wabash expedition, was sufficient for an effective operation.|$|E
5|$|Suffering from cold, hunger, {{and disease}} on the Table Rock Reservation, {{a group of}} Takelma {{returned}} to their old village {{at the mouth of}} Little Butte Creek in October 1855. After a volunteer militia attacked them, killing 23men, women, and children, they fled downriver, attacking whites from Gold Hill to Galice Creek. Confronted by volunteers and regular army troops, the Indians at first repulsed them; however, after nearly 200volunteers launched an all-day assault on the remaining natives, the war ended <b>at</b> <b>Big</b> Bend (at RM35 or RK56) on the lower river. By then, fighting had also ended near the coast, where, before retreating upstream, a separate group of natives had killed about 30whites and burned their cabins near what later became Gold Beach.|$|E

5|$|Tell All Your Friends is {{the debut}} studio album by American rock band Taking Back Sunday. The group had several lineup changes before {{settling}} on vocalist Adam Lazzara, guitarist and vocalist John Nolan, guitarist Eddie Reyes, bassist Shaun Cooper, and drummer Mark O'Connell. Taking Back Sunday released a five-song demo in early 2001, after which, they toured {{for most of the}} year. They rented a room in Lindenhurst, New York, where they wrote and demoed songs.

5|$|The twin conference {{victories}} {{were followed}} by two out-of-conference wins: <b>at</b> <b>Big</b> 12 opponent Nebraska and against independent Western Kentucky. At {{the end of the}} four-game winning streak, the Hokies had a 4–1 record, 2–0 in conference, and were ranked No. 17 in the country. On October 18, however, the Hokies lost to unranked Boston College in Boston, 28–23. The game was a rematch of the previous year's ACC Championship Game and was a preview of the 2008 ACC Championship Game matchup. The loss was the start of a skid that saw Tech lose three of four games, only managing a victory against Maryland, 23–13. The final contest of that four-game stretch was a 16–13 loss to Coastal Division rival Miami, which then held the tiebreaker over the Hokies in the event of any head-to-head tie.|$|E
