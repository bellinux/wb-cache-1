5|$|The Svalbard Treaty {{specifies}} that {{no military}} installations are permitted on the archipelago. The Soviet authorities {{were concerned that}} a permanent civilian airport {{could also be used}} by Norwegian <b>and</b> <b>NATO</b> forces. But the Soviets also needed an airport to serve their settlements at Barentsburg and Pyramiden, and by the early 1970s, an understanding was reached between the two countries.|$|E

5|$|Despite the improvements, the {{in-service}} {{rates for}} the F-84E remained poor with {{less than half of}} the aircraft operational at any given time. This was primarily due to a severe shortage of spares for the Allison engines. The expectation was that F-84Es would fly 25 hours per month, accumulating 100 hours between engine overhauls. The actual flight hours for Korean War <b>and</b> <b>NATO</b> deployments rapidly outpaced the supply and Allison's ability to manufacture new engines. The F-84E was withdrawn from USAF service in 1956, lingering with ANG units until 1959.|$|E
5|$|Operation Deny Flight was a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) {{operation}} that began on 12 April 1993 as {{the enforcement of}} a United Nations (UN) no-fly zone over Bosnia and Herzegovina. The United Nations <b>and</b> <b>NATO</b> later expanded {{the mission of the}} operation to include providing close air support for UN troops in Bosnia and carrying out coercive air strikes against targets in Bosnia. Twelve NATO members contributed forces to the operation and, by its end on 20 December 1995, NATO pilots had flown 100,420 sorties.|$|E
5|$|Partnership for Peace (PfP) {{membership}} {{was offered}} to Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro and Serbia. NATO hoped {{that this would}} bring these countries more into the Euro-Atlantic community as the PfP is a programme of practical bilateral cooperation between individual Partner countries <b>and</b> <b>NATO,</b> thereby allowing Partner countries {{to choose their own}} priorities for cooperation. It is expected that PfP membership is for these three countries the first step towards NATO membership. As a result, the PfP offer sparked the anger of the UN tribunal trying suspected war criminals from the Balkans.|$|E

5|$|Portland Harbour, {{in between}} Portland and Weymouth, {{is one of}} the largest {{man-made}} harbours in the world. The harbour was made by the building of stone breakwaters between 1848 and 1905. From its inception it was a Royal Navy base, and played prominent roles during the First and Second World Wars; ships of the Royal Navy <b>and</b> <b>NATO</b> countries worked up and exercised in its waters until 1995. The harbour is now a civilian port and popular recreation area, and was used for the 2012 Olympic Games.|$|E
5|$|The NATO {{intervention}} in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1992 and the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 resulted in strained relations between Serbia <b>and</b> <b>NATO.</b> Relations were further strained following Kosovo's {{declaration of independence}} in 2008 while a protectorate of the United Nations with security support from NATO. However, Serbia was invited and joined the Partnership for Peace programme during the 2006 Riga summit and in 2008, was invited to enter the intensified dialogue programme whenever the country is ready.|$|E
5|$|Turkey has {{maintained}} forces in international missions under the United Nations <b>and</b> <b>NATO</b> since the Korean War, including peacekeeping missions in Somalia, Yugoslavia, Horn of Africa {{and supported the}} coalition forces in the First Gulf War. Turkey maintains a controversial 36,000 troop-strong force in Northern Cyprus, contributes military personnel to the International Security Assistance Force, Kosovo Force, Eurocorps and takes part in the EU Battlegroups while assisting Iraqi Kurdistan and Somalia with security. TAF has overseas military bases in Iraq, Qatar and in Somalia.|$|E

With the brigade, Dutton also undertook cold-weather training in Norway in 2004. He was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in October 2003.|$|E
5|$|Biden was re-elected to the Senate six times, and was {{the fourth}} most senior senator {{at the time of}} his {{resignation}} to assume the Vice Presidency in 2009. He was a long-time member and former chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. He opposed the Gulf War in 1991, but advocated U.S. <b>and</b> <b>NATO</b> intervention in the Bosnian War in 1994 and 1995. He voted in favor of the resolution authorizing the Iraq War in 2002, but opposed the surge of U.S. troops in 2007. He has also served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, dealing with issues related to drug policy, crime prevention, and civil liberties, and led the legislative efforts for creation of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, and the Violence Against Women Act. He chaired the Judiciary Committee during the contentious U.S. Supreme Court nominations of Robert Bork and Clarence Thomas.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria hosted six KC-135 Stratotanker {{aircraft}} and 200 support personnel {{for the war}} effort in Afghanistan in 2001, {{which was the first}} stationing of foreign forces on its territory since World War II. International military relations were further expanded in April 2006, when Bulgaria and the United States signed a defence cooperation agreement providing for the usage of Bezmer and Graf Ignatievo air bases, the Novo Selo training range, and a logistics centre in Aytos as joint military training facilities. The same year Foreign Policy magazine listed Bezmer Air Base as one of the six most important overseas facilities used by the USAF due to its proximity to the Middle East. A total of 756 troops are deployed abroad as part of various UN <b>and</b> <b>NATO</b> missions. Historically, Bulgaria deployed significant numbers of military and civilian advisors in Soviet-allied countries, such as Nicaragua and Libya (more than 9,000 personnel).|$|E

5|$|From the 1950s to 2003, the Strategic Commanders {{were the}} Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) and the Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic (SACLANT). The current {{arrangement}} is to separate responsibility between Allied Command Transformation (ACT), responsible for transformation {{and training of}} NATO forces, and Allied Command Operations (ACO), responsible for NATO operations worldwide. Starting in late 2003 NATO has restructured how it commands and deploys its troops by creating several NATO Rapid Deployable Corps, including Eurocorps, I. German/Dutch Corps, Multinational Corps Northeast, <b>and</b> <b>NATO</b> Rapid Deployable Italian Corps among others, as well as naval High Readiness Forces (HRFs), which all report to Allied Command Operations.|$|E
5|$|In February 1991, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic and Slovakia (as Czechoslovakia) {{formed the}} Visegrád Group {{to push for}} European {{integration}} under the European Union <b>and</b> <b>NATO,</b> {{as well as to}} conduct military reforms in line with NATO standards. Internal NATO reaction to these former Warsaw Pact countries was initially negative, but by the 1991 Rome summit in November, members agreed to a series of goals that could lead to accession, such as market and democratic liberalization, and that NATO should be a partner in these efforts. In subsequent years, wider forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its eastern neighbors were set up, including the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (later the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council) and the Partnership for Peace.|$|E
5|$|Interest in Banak {{rose with}} the Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948 {{and fears of}} Soviet {{intervention}} in Norway. Finnmark, located on the Norway–Soviet Union border, became of particular interest for the military. Although specific plans were articulated, no construction was carried out. Norway's entry into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 1949 had a dramatic effect on the military strategy and Banak. Norwegian authorities <b>and</b> <b>NATO</b> regarded Finnmark as a tripwire—it was to be sacrificed and delay attacking forces {{in case of a}} Soviet invasion. The airfield was closed in 1952, but the runway remained, with a short section of an unmaintained wooden runway and otherwise consisting of a grass strip. It was occasionally used by small aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Like the Council, {{from time}} to time the Military Committee also meets at a higher level, namely at the level of Chiefs of Defence, the most senior {{military}} officer in each nation's armed forces. Until 2008 the Military Committee excluded France, due to that country's 1966 decision to remove itself from the NATO Military Command Structure, which it rejoined in 1995. Until France rejoined NATO, it was not represented on the Defence Planning Committee, and this led to conflicts between it <b>and</b> <b>NATO</b> members. Such {{was the case in the}} lead up to Operation Iraqi Freedom. The operational work of the Committee is supported by the International Military Staff.|$|E
5|$|Many {{military}} events {{occurred during}} Clinton's presidency. The Battle of Mogadishu occurred in Somalia in 1993. During the operation, two U.S. helicopters {{were shot down}} by rocket-propelled grenade attacks to their tail rotors, trapping soldiers behind enemy lines. This resulted in an urban battle that killed 18 American soldiers, wounded 73 others, and one was taken prisoner. There were many more Somali casualties. Some of the American bodies were dragged through the streets—a spectacle broadcast on television news programs. In response, U.S. forces were withdrawn from Somalia and later conflicts were approached with fewer soldiers on the ground. In 1995, U.S. <b>and</b> <b>NATO</b> aircraft attacked Bosnian Serb targets to halt attacks on U.N. safe zones and to pressure them into a peace accord. Clinton deployed U.S. peacekeepers to Bosnia in late 1995, to uphold the subsequent Dayton Agreement.|$|E
5|$|On 21 February 1952, he {{was named}} {{commander}} of the Continental Air Command at Mitchel Air Force Base, New York.

He was U.S. Representative to the NATO Military Committee, Military Representatives Committee, <b>and</b> <b>NATO</b> Standing Group, stationed in Washington, D.C., from April 1956 until May 1958, when he became air deputy to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, at SHAPE Headquarters in Paris, France. He retired on 31 July 1961, but on 15 September 1961 he was recalled to active duty to become director of the National Security Council's Net Evaluation Subcommittee Staff at the Pentagon.
