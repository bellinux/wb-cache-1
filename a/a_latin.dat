40|$|AbstractA finite <b>latin</b> square is <b>an</b> n×n matrix whose {{entries are}} {{elements}} of the set { 1,…,n} and no element is repeated in any row or column. Given equivalence relations {{on the set of}} rows, the set of columns, and the set of symbols, respectively, we can use these relations to identify equivalent rows, columns and symbols, and obtain <b>an</b> amalgamated <b>latin</b> square. There is a set of natural equations that have to be satisfied by <b>an</b> amalgamated <b>latin</b> square. Using these equations we can define the notion of <b>an</b> outline <b>latin</b> square and it follows easily that <b>an</b> amalgamated <b>latin</b> square is <b>an</b> outline <b>latin</b> square. Hilton (Math. Programming Stud. 13 (1980) 68) proved that the opposite implication holds as well, that is, every outline <b>latin</b> square is <b>an</b> amalgamated <b>latin</b> square. In this paper, we present a generalization of that result to infinite latin squares with the sets of rows, columns and symbols of arbitrary cardinality...|$|R
40|$|Hall's Condition is a {{necessary}} condition for <b>a</b> partial <b>latin</b> square to be completable.

We give what could be regarded as an extension of Ryser's Theorem, by showing that for <b>a</b> partial <b>latin</b> square whose filled cells form a rectangle, where there is at most one empty cell in each column of the rectangle, Hall's Condition {{is a necessary}} and sufficient condition for completability. It is well-known that the problem of deciding whether <b>a</b> partial <b>latin</b> square is completable is NP-complete.

5|$|Capitalization {{during this}} time was not standardized. It {{depended}} on the authors and their background. Those influenced by German capitalized all nouns, while others capitalized more sparsely. It is also not always apparent which letters are capitalized owing to the Gothic or blackletter typeface which was used to print the Bible. This typeface was in use until the mid-18th century, when it was gradually replaced with <b>a</b> <b>Latin</b> typeface (often antiqua).|$|E

5|$|During {{the siege}} of the city by the Fourth Crusade, the sea walls {{nonetheless}} {{proved to be a}} weak point in the city's defences, as the Venetians managed to storm them. Following this experience, Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282) took particular care to heighten and strengthen the seaward walls immediately after the Byzantine recapture of the city in 1261, since <b>a</b> <b>Latin</b> attempt to recover the city was regarded as imminent. Furthermore, the installation of the Genoese at Galata across the Golden Horn, agreed upon in the Treaty of Nymphaeum, posed a further potential threat to the city. Time being short, as <b>a</b> <b>Latin</b> attempt to recover the city was expected, the sea walls were heightened by the addition of two-meter high wooden and hide-covered screens. Ten years later, facing the threat of an invasion by Charles d'Anjou, a second line of walls was built behind the original maritime walls, although no trace of them survives today.|$|E
