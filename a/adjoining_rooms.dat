5|$|The second sub-plot {{depicts the}} lives of Charles W. Grannis and Miss Anastasia Baker. Grannis and Baker are two elderly {{boarders}} who share <b>adjoining</b> <b>rooms</b> in the apartment complex where Trina and McTeague live. Throughout their time at the apartment complex, they have not met. They both sit close to their adjoining wall {{and listen to the}} other for company, so they know almost everything about each other. They finally meet and cannot hide their long-time feelings for each other. When they reveal their love, Grannis admits he has $5,000, making him just as rich as Trina. But this makes little difference to them. Eventually, they marry and a door connects their rooms.|$|E
5|$|In January 1942, {{a meeting}} {{was held for}} the purpose of {{establishing}} a more extensive library service. Later that month, on January 29, a charter was issued by West Virginia Secretary of State William Smith O'Brien for the creation of the non-profit Hampshire County Library Association. Following its incorporation, the library was relocated from Literary Hall to two rear <b>adjoining</b> <b>rooms</b> on the second story of the Hampshire County Courthouse. The association continued to house its library collection in the courthouse until 1967, when the new Hampshire County Public Library building at 153West Main Street was formally dedicated on September 28, 1967. The library had been built on land donated by sisters Kate and Mary Davis, who had been engaged in the restoration of Literary Hall and whose father, Charles Maurice Davis, {{had been a member of}} both the Romney Literary Society and the Clinton Lodge Masons, which had both held meetings in the building.|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} 17th century, {{the idea of}} giving {{servants}} their own designated areas had been adopted not only in the houses of the aristocracy, as at Coleshill, but also in those of the gentry such as Belton House. This improved privacy and kept cooking smells, noise, and any other indelicacies of the lower classes away from their more cultivated employers, thus allowing the great hall and its <b>adjoining</b> <b>rooms</b> to be more tastefully decorated and specifically employed.|$|E
25|$|In 1540 {{the abbey}} site {{was sold to}} Sir Edward Littleton, a {{religious}} conservative, of Pillaton Hall, Staffordshire. Only two years later, Littleton sold it to Sir Rowland Hill, a Protestant who became Lord Mayor of London in 1547, and soon after sold Haughmond to the Barker family. During this period the Abbot's Hall and <b>adjoining</b> <b>rooms</b> were converted into a private residence, although the church and dormitory were already being plundered for building stone. Some of the other buildings around the little cloister continued as private accommodation, with the Little Cloister becoming a formal garden, up until the English Civil War.|$|E
25|$|George was {{considered}} to be the cleverest of the Imperial children. He was also outgoing, like his mother. George and Nicholas shared the same tutors, but studied in <b>adjoining</b> <b>rooms.</b> They followed the course of the Academy of the Russian General Staff. Their tutors were distinguished professors. Their English teacher, Charles Heath, had once been tutor to their uncles, Grand Dukes Sergei and Pavel. Both brothers spoke and wrote faultless English. From Mr. Heath they acquired a love of sport, particularly shooting and fly-fishing. They also spoke fluent French and passable German and Danish. George displayed signs of a promising career in the Navy before falling ill with tuberculosis in 1890.|$|E

25|$|Horn {{explores the}} mutable nature {{of art and}} {{identity}} through sculptures, works on paper, photography, and books. She describes drawing as the key activity in all her work because drawing is about composing relationships. Horn’s drawings concentrate on the materiality of the objects depicted. She also uses words {{as the basis for}} drawings and other works. Horn crafts complex relationships between the viewer and her work by installing a single piece on opposing walls, in <b>adjoining</b> <b>rooms,</b> or throughout a series of buildings. She subverts the notion of ‘identical experience’, insisting that one’s sense of self is marked by a place in the here-and-there, and by time in the now-and-then. She describes her artworks as site-dependent, expanding upon the idea of site-specificity associated with Minimalism. Horn’s work also embodies the cyclical relationship between humankind and nature—a mirror-like relationship in which we attempt to remake nature in our own image.|$|E
500|$|On another spur of {{the same}} Lenyadri hill, there are four more caves (not numbered) that face south-south west and are cut into precipitous hill slopes. Based on their {{unfinished}} conditions, they are interpreted as early caves. The details are: a small chaitya with a relic-shrine and a door, with unfinished irregular rock faces. The entrance is decorated with ornamentation that depict relic-shrine, a lotus flower and [...] geometrical patterns; another is an inaccessible cave with two rooms, a well, and stone beds in three <b>adjoining</b> <b>rooms</b> with an incomplete relic-shrine in low relief; two other adjoining caves have a chapel and a front veranda.|$|E
500|$|The Golden Triclinium, or Chrysotriklinos, of the Great Palace of Constantinople {{served as}} an {{audience}} hall for the Emperor {{as well as a}} palace chapel. Nothing of it has survived except descriptions, which indicate that it had a pumpkin dome containing sixteen windows in its webs and that the dome was supported by the arches of eight niches connecting to <b>adjoining</b> <b>rooms</b> in the building's likely circular plan. Alternatively, the building may have been octagonal in plan, rather than circular. The building was not free-standing and was located at the intersection of the public and private parts of the palace. Smaller windows filled with thin sheets of alabaster may have existed over each of the curtain-covered side niches and below the cornice {{at the base of the}} dome. The dome seems to have had webs that alternated straight and concave, like those of the dome of Justinian's Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus, and may have been built about 40 years after that church. It was begun under Emperor Justin II, completed by his successor Tiberius II, and continued to be improved by subsequent rulers. It was connected to the imperial living quarters and was a space used for assembly before religious festivals, high promotions and consultations, as a banqueting hall, a chapel for the emperor, and a throne room. Never fully described in any of its frequent mentions in Byzantine texts, the room was restricted to members of the court and the [...] "most highly rated foreigners". In the 10th century, the throne in the east niche chamber was directly below an icon of an enthroned Christ.|$|E

2500|$|Bill Cook, {{a billionaire}} entrepreneur, and his wife, Gayle, from Bloomington, Indiana, have been {{involved}} with several historic preservation projects. The Cook Group initiated efforts to stabilize the hotel's structural integrity and begin exterior restoration during the summer of 1996. The thirty-month first phase of the project was completed in early 1999 at a cost of $30 million—two-and-a-half times their initial commitment. In addition to the exteriors of the hotel and outbuildings, the garden was recreated, and the interior atrium, lobby, dining room and <b>adjoining</b> <b>rooms</b> were also completely restored. Over the next five years, the Cook Group spent another $5 million for maintenance.|$|E
2500|$|The Germans also {{concealed}} various {{machine guns}} and anti-tank emplacements throughout the town, making movement by armour and infantry increasingly difficult. The house to house fighting was vicious and the Canadians made use of a new tactic: [...] "mouse-holing". This tactic involved using weapons such as the PIAT (or even cumbersome anti-tank guns) to breach {{the walls of a}} building, as houses within Ortona shared adjoining walls. The soldiers would then throw in grenades and assault through the mouse holes, clearing the top floors and making their way down, where both adversaries struggled in repeated close-quarters combat. Mouse-holing was also used to pierce through walls into <b>adjoining</b> <b>rooms,</b> sometimes catching enemy troops by surprise. The tactic would be used repeatedly as assaulting through the streets inflicted heavy casualties on both Canadian and German troops. Throughout the battle, engineers on both sides used the brutal but effective strategy of using demolition charges to collapse entire buildings on top of enemy troops.|$|E
2500|$|When the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society was organized, in 1876, {{she was one}} of {{the most}} earnest and {{successful}} advocates of the cause. She wrote for the Woman's Missionary Advocate and for the Church papers in the interest of foreign missions. While her sister, Mary, was Corresponding Secretary of the Louisville Conference, Helm was the first in that Conference to send to the Secretary a paid-up list of subscribers. The Louisville Conference money was the first received by Mrs. Manier (who was then the agent), and she has said to her coworkers that but for it she could not have met the expense of the first issues of the Advocate. In all of Helm's local work, both of a religious and social nature, her sister, Mary, was her companion and coworker. After she became Secretary of the Woman's Department of Church Extension, and Mary was Assistant Secretary of the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society, they had <b>adjoining</b> <b>rooms,</b> where they did their work. Helm edited the leaflets for the Foreign Missionary Society. One of her articles, entitled [...] "Seed-Time," [...] was published in the Nashville Christian Advocate in 1880. Helm was interested in all mission fields, and was very anxious for the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society to open work in Brazil. Besides writing herself on this subject, she got Rev. J. J. Ransom, a returned missionary, to write two leaflets for her, and she made strong appeals to arouse the women to engage in the work.|$|E

60|$|Rollo further inquired of {{his uncle}} whether he and Josie could not talk {{in their own}} room; but Mr. George said no. If boys were allowed to talk {{together}} after they went to bed, he said, they were very apt {{to get into a}} frolic, and disturb those who slept in the <b>adjoining</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|E

60|$|The {{train was}} late getting into Chicago that Monday night. Colonel Hathaway took Mary Louise and Alora to the Blackington, but {{the hotel was}} so crowded that the girls could not get <b>adjoining</b> <b>rooms.</b> However, they secured rooms just {{across the hall from}} one another and the Colonel's room was but two doors removed from that of his granddaughter, so the three were not greatly separated.|$|E

60|$|The <b>adjoining</b> <b>room</b> was dark. Tarzan {{tried the}} window and found it unlatched. All was quiet within. He raised the sash and listened again--still silence. Placing a leg over the sill he slipped within and hurriedly glanced about. The room was vacant. Crossing to the door he opened it and looked out into the hall. There was no one there, either, and he stepped out and {{approached}} {{the door of the}} <b>adjoining</b> <b>room</b> where the man and woman were.|$|R
