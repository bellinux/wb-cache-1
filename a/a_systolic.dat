5|$|Denning {{was told}} he would be ineligible {{to serve in the}} Armed Forces because of <b>a</b> <b>systolic</b> heart murmur, which he {{believed}} the doctor diagnosed because he was tired of sending young men off to die. He successfully appealed against the decision, and enlisted on 14 August 1917 as a cadet in the Hampshire Regiment before being sent to the Royal Engineers Oxford University Officer Training Corps. He trained at Newark and was temporarily commissioned as a second lieutenant on 17 November 1917. Although he was old enough to serve in the armed forces, regulations meant that he was not allowed to serve in France until he was nineteen.|$|E

40|$|Ten {{patients}} with the billowing mitral leaflet syndrome complicated by infective endocarditis are reported. Two patients had <b>a</b> non-ejection <b>systolic</b> click and 8 had both <b>a</b> non-ejection <b>systolic</b> click and <b>a</b> late <b>systolic</b> murmur. These auscultatory features were difficult to detect in 4 instances in that they were intermittent, soft, or brought out only with postural change. Seven patients were unaware of their cardiac lesions. A low grade pyrexia was present in all 10 patients. Four patients presented with clinical features caused by reversible neurological lesions. Blood cultures were positive in all patients, with Staphylococcus albus the infecting organism in 6. Antibiotic therapy was successful with significant mitral regurgitation supervening in only one instance. The importance of the billowing leaflet as a potential site of infective endocarditis is emphasized. It seems that antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated at times of increased risk of infection in subjects with <b>a</b> non-ejection <b>systolic</b> click or <b>a</b> late <b>systolic</b> murmur...|$|R

This is still appropriate in cases with isolated extremity trauma, thermal trauma, or head injuries. In general, however, giving lots of fluids appears to {{increase the risk of}} death. Current evidence supports limiting the use of fluids for penetrating thorax and abdominal injuries, allowing mild hypotension to persist. Targets include a mean arterial pressure of 60mmHg, <b>a</b> <b>systolic</b> blood pressure of 70–90mmHg, or the re-establishment of peripheral pulses and adequate ability to think.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{clinical and}} vascular laboratory data on 126 patients with below-knee or forefoot amputation. Vascular laboratory examination included Doppler {{systolic blood pressure}} and arterial wave form analysis using the segmental plethysmograph. Fifty-four patients had below-knee amputation. <b>A</b> calf <b>systolic</b> pressure greater than 70 torr was associated with 97 % (33 / 34) success (p less than 0. 005), <b>an</b> ankle <b>systolic</b> pressure greater than 30 torr yielded 91 % (39 / 43) success (p less than 0. 025), and <b>an</b> ankle <b>systolic</b> pressure greater than zero yielded an 87 % success (p less than 0. 005). In the absence {{of each of the}} above criteria, the predictive value of a negative test was only 32 %, 40 %, and 52 %, respectively. The presence of a popliteal pulse was associated with 97 % success (p less than 0. 025); however, 88 % of those with an absent popliteal pulse also achieved successful healing of below-the-knee amputations. Prior vascular reconstructive surgery was detrimental to healing of below-knee amputations. with 33 % failure rate (p less than 0. 025). For the 72 forefoot amputations, <b>an</b> ankle <b>systolic</b> pressure greater than 70 torr yielded a 65 % success (p less than 0. 025). The sensitivity of <b>an</b> ankle <b>systolic</b> pressure greater than 70 torr was 80 % (32 / 40) and <b>an</b> ankle <b>systolic</b> greater than 35 yielded a sensitivity of 95 % (38 / 40). The specificity was low for both of these reference values. Clinical and vascular laboratory criteria can identify patients who will have a successful below-knee amputation; however, because of the high false negative rate, patients should not be denied below-knee amputation {{solely on the basis of}} Doppler systolic pressure. Vascular laboratory criteria for predicting healing of forefoot amputations are also limited by the high rate of false positive and false negative results...|$|R
