25|$|If S is a maximal {{independent}} set in some graph, it is a maximal clique or maximal complete subgraph in {{the complementary}} graph. A maximal clique {{is a set}} of vertices that induces a complete subgraph, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a subset of the vertices of any larger complete subgraph. That is, it is a set S such that every pair of vertices in S is connected by an edge and every vertex not in S is missing an edge to at least one vertex in S. A graph may have many maximal cliques, of varying sizes; finding the largest of these is the maximum clique problem.|$|E

500|$|After Rankl's {{departure}} {{the company}} engaged {{a series of}} guest conductors while Webster sought a new musical director. His preferred candidates, Erich Kleiber, John Barbirolli, Josef Krips, Britten and Rudolf Kempe, were among the guests but none would take the permanent post. It was not until 1954 that Webster found a replacement for Rankl in Rafael Kubelík. Kubelík announced immediately {{that he was in}} favour of continuing the policy of singing in the vernacular: [...] "Everything that the composer has written should be understood by the audience; <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> possible if the opera is sung in a language with which they are not familiar". This provoked a public onslaught by Beecham, who continued to maintain {{that it was impossible to}} produce more than a handful of English-speaking opera stars, and that importing singers from continental Europe was the only way to achieve first-rate results.|$|E

But the image in the Holy City is entirely a woman, and the grounds for their account are not very clear. They consider fish to be sacred, and they never eat them; and though they eat all other fowls they do not eat the dove, for they believe it is holy. And these things are done, they believe, because of Derketo and Semiramis, the first because Derketo has {{the shape of a}} fish, and the other because ultimately Semiramis turned into a dove. Well, I may grant that the temple was a work of Semiramis perhaps; but that it belongs to Derketo I do not believe in any way. For among the Egyptians some people do not eat fish, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> done to honor Derketo." ...|$|E

[...] "Trainfire", a classic country–style song inspired by Elvis Presley's cover of [...] "Mystery Train", addresses Townsend's former addiction to pornography, which he described as [...] "this crazy, crack cocaine on the internet that nobody wants to talk about." [...] The song continues the album's theme of honesty and self-acceptance, both about pornography and musical tastes. Townsend explained the song's musical style, saying [...] "yes, I like heavy music and am good at making it, {{but that is not}} all that I listen to, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> all that I want to play." ...|$|E
500|$|According to the {{response}} by Robert van Voren, Pekhterev {{in his article}} condescendingly argues that the Serbsky Institute was not so bad place and that Nekipelov exaggerates and slanders it, but Pekhterev, by doing so, misses the main point: living conditions in the Serbsky Institute were not bad, those who passed through psychiatric examination there were {{in a certain sense}} [...] "on holiday" [...] in comparison with the living conditions of the Gulag; and all the same, everyone was aware that the Serbsky Institute was more than the [...] "gates of hell" [...] from where people were sent to specialized psychiatric hospitals in Chernyakhovsk, Dnepropetrovsk, Kazan, Blagoveshchensk, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> all. Their life was transformed to unimaginable horror with daily tortures by forced administration of drugs, beatings and other forms of punishment. Many went crazy, could not endure what was happening to them, some even died during the [...] "treatment" [...] (for example, a miner from Donetsk Alexey Nikitin). Many books and memoirs are written about the life in the psychiatric Gulag and every time when reading them a shiver seizes us. The Soviet psychiatric terror in its brutality and targeting the mentally ill as the most vulnerable group of society had nothing on the Nazi euthanasia programs. The punishment by placement in a mental hospital was as effective as imprisonment in Mordovian concentration camps in breaking persons psychologically and physically. The recent history of the USSR should be given a wide publicity to immunize society against possible repetitions of the Soviet practice of political abuse of psychiatry. The issue remains highly relevant.|$|E
