50|$|Jawa 250/559/05 - {{a famous}} model with an <b>automatic</b> <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch.</b>|$|E
50|$|The gearbox, {{controlled}} by a column mounted lever, was a three speed manual system coupled with a free-wheel device: in Autumn 1953 a four speed box was offered as an option. 1957 saw a further transmission advance with {{the availability of a}} Saxomat <b>automatic</b> <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch</b> on the DKW.|$|E
50|$|Engine.The Clinton A490 Panther 2-stroke {{engine is}} {{centrally}} mounted to ensure perfect balance at all speeds. The engine position is adjustable to suit chain tension. The starting is by recoil starter, power {{being delivered to}} the rear wheel through an <b>automatic</b> <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch</b> which comes into effect upon opening of the throttle.|$|E

50|$|The scooter weighs around 93 kg, Fuel {{capacity}} is 7 liters and oil capacity (two-stroke oil) is 1.2 liters. Its <b>automatic</b> dry <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch</b> {{is driven by}} V-belt. Engine compression ratio is 6:1.|$|R
5000|$|Thomas Fogarty, {{who is also}} {{credited}} with inventing the balloon catheter, is {{credited with}} inventing a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch</b> in the 1940s although automobiles were already being manufactured with <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutches</b> as early as 1936. [...] There is also a design for an 'automatic clutch' (essentially the same device) in the 'Meccano Magazine' of June 1931. But <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutches</b> were used in railway locomotives much earlier (before 1858), and referred to (in relation to electric motors) in a patent of 1899 ...|$|R
50|$|The Lambrettino, {{an updated}} design using a rigid spine frame with a coil-sprung single seat and 39 cc (40 x 31 mm) engine, was {{introduced}} for the 1966 Model Year. Having a single-speed transmission with <b>automatic</b> (<b>centrifugal)</b> <b>clutch,</b> 18 x 2.00 inch tyres and weighing 90 lb, the maker claimed {{a top speed}} of 24 mph returning an overall fuel consumption of 200 mpg.|$|E
50|$|The FC50 was {{powered by}} a single {{cylinder}} petrol two-stroke engine that was liquid cooled, {{making it one of}} the most powerful in its class. The small radiator was fitted behind the grill between the two headlights. It featured 12-volt electric start and CVT transmission; the transmission changed from low to high at around 5500 rpm. It had an <b>automatic</b> <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch</b> that engaged gradually from 3000 rpm.|$|E

5000|$|Cars with a Saxomat clutch did {{not have}} a clutch pedal. The Saxomat {{consisted}} of two independent systems: the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch,</b> and the servo <b>clutch.</b> The <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch</b> was engaged above certain engine speed by centrifugal force acting on spinning weights inside the clutch, similar to a centrifugal governor.|$|R
50|$|Early {{semi-automatic}} systems used {{a variety}} of mechanical and hydraulic systems—including <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutches,</b> torque converters, electro-mechanical (and even electrostatic) and servo/solenoid controlled clutches—and control schemes—automatic declutching when moving the gearstick, pre-selector controls, <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutches</b> with drum-sequential shift requiring the driver to lift the throttle for a successful shift, etc.—and some were little more than regular lock-up torque converter automatics with manual gear selection.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} days, karts were direct drive only (requiring push starts), but the {{inconvenience}} of that setup soon {{led to the}} <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch</b> for the club level classes. Dry <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutches</b> are now used in many categories (Rotax Max is one example) and have become the norm as the top international classes have switched to 125 cc clutched engines as of January 2007.|$|R
50|$|The Piaggio Zip is a {{low cost}} scooter that is {{manufactured}} by Piaggio. All Zip models have a CVT automatic transmission, {{sometimes referred to as}} a twist & go transmission due to its lack of gears and use of an <b>automatic</b> <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch.</b> It is usually the cheapest model in the Piaggio range and shares several components with other models in the range. Several companies such as Malossi, Polini and PM Tuning offer an extensive catalogue of tuning parts for the 50 cc and 125 models.|$|E
5000|$|Some late-1950s Cushmans, {{designated}} Road King and Pacemaker, had jet-age body styling. Sears sold {{a version}} of these models under the Allstate brand. Cushman scooters featured an <b>automatic</b> <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch,</b> which allowed the rider to twist the right grip to accelerate. Oddly, the throttle twisted forward during acceleration, opposite the usual pattern in most other motorcycles and scooters. Cushman claimed 75 miles per gallon, and advertised penny-a-mile operating cost. Cushman scooters usually weighed about 250 to 335 pounds and had as much as [...] In comparison to european scooters, Cushman scooters had a higher weight, larger cubic capacity (up to 0,4 l), but not more power.|$|E
5000|$|The {{shift pattern}} for most underbone or {{miniature}} motorcycles with an <b>automatic</b> <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch</b> is also modified for two key reasons—to enable the less-experienced riders {{to shift the}} gears without problems of [...] "finding" [...] neutral, and also due to the greater force needed to [...] "lift" [...] the gearshift lever (because the gearshift pedal of an underbone motorcycle also operates the clutch). The gearshift lever of an underbone has two ends. The rider clicks down the front end with the left toe {{all the way to}} the top gear and clicks down the rear end with the heel all the way down to neutral, while miniatures still retain a single-end lever, with the rider clicks down to upshift and lift the lever up to downshift (or vice versa). Some underbone models such as the Honda Wave have a [...] "rotary" [...] shift pattern, which means that the rider can shift directly to neutral from the top gear, but for safety reasons this is only possible when the motorcycle is stationary. Some models also have gear position indicators for all gear positions at the instrument panel.|$|E

5000|$|The Dyane {{was also}} {{available}} with the [...] "trafficlutch" [...] - a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch</b> which helped avoid stalling whilst in slow moving urban traffic.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: A two-shoe <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch.</b> The motor spins {{the input}} shaft {{that makes the}} shoes go around, and the outer drum (removed) turns the output power shaft.|$|R
50|$|This gearbox used a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch,</b> {{described}} by Talbot as the 'Traffic Clutch'. This {{was a simple}} device, with two radially swinging shoes, similar to a drum brake.|$|R
500|$|The {{sequential}} shifting three speed gearbox was manually shifted, but clutchless, {{without the}} need for a clutch lever control, using instead a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch</b> along with a plate clutch slaved to the footchange lever to engage and disengage the gearbox from the engine. While not intuitive to learn, once the rider got used to it, the semi-automatic transmission, [...] "took the terror out of motorcycling" [...] for novice riders. Unlike many scooter CVTs, the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch</b> made it possible to push start the Super Cub, a useful advantage if the need arose.|$|R
50|$|Typically a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch</b> and sprocket.The <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch</b> expands with raising {{spinning}} speed towards a drum. On this drum sits either a fixed sprocket or an exchangeable one. The clutch has three jobs to do: When the saw runs idle (typically 2500-2700 rpm) the chain does not move. When the clutch is engaged and the chain {{stops in the}} wood or another reason, it protects the engine. Most important it protects the operator {{in case of a}} kickback. Here the chain break stops the drum and the clutch releases immediately.|$|R

50|$|A <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch</b> is a <b>clutch</b> {{that uses}} <b>centrifugal</b> force to connect two {{concentric}} shafts, with the driving shaft nested inside the driven shaft. It engages more at higher speeds.|$|R
5000|$|... in {{the case}} of {{radio-controlled}} cars with an engine (i.e. nitro) this pinion gear can be referred to as a clutch bell when it is paired with a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Simple chain {{reduction}} drives {{are also}} used to transfer energy to the rear wheel from the engine. These generally incorporate a type of <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch</b> to allow the engine to idle independently.|$|R
50|$|In April 1953, Simplex added a {{variable}} speed <b>automatic</b> transmission with <b>centrifugal</b> shoe-type <b>clutch</b> and belt-type automatic transmission. The ratio was changed by {{expanding and contracting}} the drive pulley, with a low ratio of approximately 18:1 and a high ratio of approximately 7:1. The transmission was belt-driven and drove the real wheel by belt, with automatic belt tensioning by jockey pulley.|$|R

50|$|Some Pneumocyclic Titans had a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch</b> {{instead of}} a fluid-coupling to the transmission; this was {{apparently}} standard on the PD2/26, of which none are recorded as built. Blackpool took the PD2/27 in 1957-58 with full-fronted MCW Orion bodies.|$|R
5000|$|A CVT {{does not}} {{strictly}} require {{the presence of}} a clutch. Nevertheless, in some vehicles (e.g. motorcycles), a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch</b> is added to facilitate a [...] "neutral" [...] stance, which is useful when idling or manually reversing into a parking space.|$|R
5000|$|Belt {{reduction}} drives use {{the combination}} of wide flat [...] "cog" [...] belts and pulleys to transfer power to the rear wheel. Like chain drives, belt drives include a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch.</b> Belt drives {{are more susceptible to}} breakage in off-road conditions.|$|R
5|$|In {{mechanical}} engineering, {{heavy metals}} {{are used for}} ballast in boats, aeroplanes, and motor vehicles; or in balance weights on wheels and crankshafts, gyroscopes, and propellers, and <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutches,</b> in situations requiring maximum weight in minimum space (for example in watch movements).|$|R
5000|$|The Honda GX25 is a 25.0 cm³ mini 4-stroke {{overhead}} cam petrol engine manufactured by Honda since 2002. Several versions exist with power output ranging from 600 to 750 watts. All versions are supplied with integrated <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch</b> shoes for power take-off ...|$|R
50|$|In 1956, Mustang {{discontinued}} the slow-selling DeliverCycle {{and introduced}} a new Colt as a budget model. This second Colt model was a stripped-down version of the Pony, with an undamped leading link fork, a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch,</b> and no transmission. The Colt was discontinued in 1958.|$|R
5000|$|... the Yomega Brain is a <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch</b> transaxle-- when {{spinning}} at {{a sufficiently}} high speed, counterweights inside the yo-yo body disengage the axle, automatically allowing the yo-yo to [...] "sleep." [...] Conversely, when the speed slows below the threshold, the yo-yo will return automatically.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{example of}} a {{rotating}} device in which a reactive centrifugal force can be identified {{used to describe the}} system behavior is the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch.</b> [...] A <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch</b> is used in small engine-powered devices such as chain saws, go-karts and model helicopters. It allows the engine to start and idle without driving the device, but automatically and smoothly engages the drive as the engine speed rises. A spring is used to constrain the spinning clutch shoes. At low speeds, the spring provides the centripetal force to the shoes, which move to larger radius as the speed increases and the spring stretches under tension. [...] At higher speeds, when the shoes can't move any further out to increase the spring tension, due to the outer drum, the drum provides some of the centripetal force that keeps the shoes moving in a circular path. The force of tension applied to the spring, and the outward force applied to the drum by the spinning shoes are the corresponding reactive centrifugal forces. [...] The mutual force between the drum and the shoes provides the friction needed to engage the output drive shaft that is connected to the drum. Thus the <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch</b> illustrates both the fictitious centrifugal force and the reactive centrifugal force.|$|R
50|$|The Raket 120 {{features}} {{electronic ignition}} and a Walbro carburetor. It weighs 6.8 kg and, {{due to its}} 13,000 rpm redline usually drives a propeller through a 3.6:1 reduction drive. The engine {{is equipped with a}} <b>centrifugal</b> <b>clutch</b> to allow running the engine without turning the propeller.|$|R
