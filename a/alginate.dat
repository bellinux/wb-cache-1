25|$|<b>Alginate</b> is a {{polysaccharide}} that readily forms chains; {{it can be}} cross-linked at its carboxylic {{groups with}} multivalent cations such as Cu2+, Ca2+, or Al3+ to form a more mechanically stable hydrogel. Calcium alginates form polymers that are both biocompatible and non-immunogenic and {{have been used in}} tissue engineering applications. However, they are unable to support longitudinally oriented growth, which is necessary for reconnection of the proximal end with its target. In order to overcome this problem, anisotropic capillary hydrogels (ACH) have been developed. They are created by superimposing aqueous solutions of sodium <b>alginate</b> with aqueous solutions of multivalent cations in layers. After formation, the electrolyte ions diffuse into the polymer solution layers, and a dissipative convective process causes the ions to precipitate, creating capillaries. The dissipative convective process results the opposition of diffusion gradients and friction between the polyelectrolyte chains. The capillary walls are lined with the precipitated metal <b>alginate,</b> while the lumen is filled with the extruded water.|$|E
25|$|Addition {{of extra}} {{nitrogen}} generally decreases cellulose production while addition of precursor molecules such as amino acids and methionine improved yield. Pyridoxine, nicotinic acid, p-aminobenzoic acid and biotin are vitamins important for cellulose production whereas pantothenate and riboflavin have opposing effects. In reactors where {{the process is}} more complex, water-soluble polysaccharides such as agar, acetan, and sodium <b>alginate</b> are added to prevent clumping or coagulation of bacterial cellulose.|$|E
30|$|<b>Alginates</b> {{are widely}} used as a gelling agent in {{pharmaceutical}} and food applications. Studies into their positive effects on human health have broadened recently with the recognition {{that they have a}} number of potentially beneficial physiological effects in the gastrointestinal tract (Peter et al. 2011; Mandel et al. 2000). Alginate-containing wound dressings are commonly used, especially in making hydrophilic gels over wounds which can produce comfortable, localized hydrophilic environments in healing wounds (Onsoyen 1996). <b>Alginates</b> are used in controlled drug delivery, where the rate of drug release depends on the type and molecular weight of <b>alginates</b> used (Alexnader et al. 2006; Goh et al. 2012). Additionally, dental impressions made with <b>alginates</b> are easy to handle for both dentist and patient as they fast set at room temperature and are cost-effective (Onsoyen 1996). Recent studies show that <b>alginates</b> can be effective in treating obesity, and currently, various functional <b>alginates</b> are being evaluated in human clinical trials (Georg et al. 2012).|$|R
50|$|<b>Alginates</b> {{can be used}} as {{thickening}} agents.Although {{listed here}} under the category 'Microbial polysaccharides', commercial <b>alginates</b> are currently only produced by extraction from brown seaweeds such as Laminaria hyperborea or L. japonica.|$|R
30|$|<b>Alginates,</b> {{obtained}} from processed algae, are unbranched polysaccharides used as wound dressings. <b>Alginates</b> are absorbent {{in nature and}} form hydrophilic gels, providing a moist wound-healing environment (Qin et al. 2006; Thu et al. 2012).|$|R
25|$|<b>Alginate,</b> carboxymethycellulose, {{polyacrylic}} acid, {{tannic acid}} and polyphosphates can form extended networks between protein molecules in solution. The {{effectiveness of these}} polyelectrolytes depend on the pH of the solution. Anionic polyelectrolytes are used at pH values less than the isoelectric point. Cationic polyelectrolytes are at pH values above the pI. It {{is important to note}} that an excess of polyelectrolytes will cause the precipitate to dissolve back into the solution. An example of polyelectrolyte flocculation is the removal of protein cloud from beer wort using Irish moss.|$|E
25|$|Another gene {{necessary}} for synthesis of di-rhamnolipids, rhlC, {{has also been}} identified. RhlC catalyses {{the addition of the}} second rhamnose moiety to mono-rhamnolipids forming di-rhamnolipids, hence is often labelled rhamnosyltransferase 2. Like rhlA and rhlB, rhlC is thought to be an ancestral gene controlled by the same quorum sensing system as rhlA and rhlB. The rhamnose moiety for mono- and di-rhamnolipids is derived from AlgC activity and the RmlABCD pathway, encoded on the rmlBCAD operon. AlgC produces sugar precursors directly for <b>alginate</b> and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as well as rhamnolipids. In rhamnose synthesis, AlgC produces glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) which is converted to dTDP-D-glucose by RmlA followed by conversion to dTDP-6-deoxy-D-4-hexulose and then dTDP-6-deoxy-L-lyxo-4-hexulose by RmlB and RmlC respectively. Finally, dTDP-6-deoxy-L-lyxo-4-hexulose is converted to dTDP-L-rhamnose by RmlD. The rhamnose can then be used in the synthesis of rhamnolipids by RhlB and RhlC.|$|E
25|$|Prang et al. (2006) {{assessed}} {{the capacity of}} ACH gels to promote directed axonal regrowth in the injured mammalian CNS. The multivalent ions used to create the alginate-based ACH gels were copper ions, whose diffusion into the sodium <b>alginate</b> layers created hexagonally structured anisotropic capillary gels. After precipitation, the entire gel was traversed by longitudinally oriented capillaries. The ACH scaffolds promoted adult NPC survival and highly oriented axon regeneration. This is the first instance of using alginates to produce anisotropic structured capillary gels. Future studies are need to study the long-term physical stability of the ACH scaffolds, because CNS axon regeneration can take many months; however, {{in addition to being}} able to provide long-term support the scaffolds must also be degradable. Of all the biological and synthetic biopolymers investigated by Prang et al. (2006), only agarose-based gels were able to compare with the linear regeneration caused by ACH scaffolds. Future studies will also need to investigate whether the ACH scaffolds allow for reinnervation of the target in vivo after a spinal cord injury.|$|E

25|$|A {{multidisciplinary}} {{group of}} researchers led by Prof. Amy Shen, developed a novel cryopreservation method {{that helps to}} protect pancreatic islets from ice damage, and facilitates real-time assessments of cell viability. The novel technique employs a droplet microfluidic device to encapsulate pancreatic islets in hydrogel made of <b>alginate,</b> a natural polymer extracted from seaweed. These capsules have a unique microstructure: a porous network and considerable amount of non-freezable water. Non-freezable bound water does not form ice due to the strong association between water molecules and the hydrogel networks. Hydrogel capsules with large amounts of non-freezable bound water protect the cells from the ice damage and {{reduce the need for}} cryoprotectants—special substances that minimise or prevent freezing damage and can be toxic in high concentrations. The hydrogel capsule allows small molecules, e.g. nutrients and islet secretions, to pass through the membrane easily, but prevents direct contact between implanted cells and host cells and so prevent an attack on transplants by the autoimmune response. The use of a real-time single-islet oxygen sensor – a fluorescent oxygen-sensitive dye in hydrogel capsules allows to use a simple and cheap yet reliable individual-islet-based quality control of viability for the entire islet processing procedure prior to transplantation. Fluorescence indicates whether cells are consuming oxygen and, therefore, are alive and healthy.|$|E

500|$|While early grills {{could not}} be removed easily and {{involved}} reshaping the tooth itself to fit the grill, grills are today made from custom dental molds. [...] For more expensive grills, a dentist takes a mold of the wearer's front teeth with a quick set <b>alginate.</b> [...] A tooth mold is obtained by filling the <b>alginate</b> negative with buff stone, then the buff stone is used to fit the grill to the unique set of teeth. [...] However, for inexpensive novelty grills, a jeweler may make an impression by having the wearer bite into dental putty or wax softened in water, or the wearer may do this himself. [...] Such grills may be less comfortable or dependable than grills that are professionally fitted, and in several instances jewelers manufacturing grills in this manner {{have been charged with}} practicing dentistry without a license.|$|E
30|$|Apart from <b>alginates,</b> other hydrocolloids, such as CMC, carrageenan, xanthan, guar gum, pectin, konjac gum, {{artemisia}} sphaerocephala krasch gum, edible gelatin {{and some}} modified starches, usually play a similar role as <b>alginates</b> {{in improving the}} overall quality of fresh noodles, dry noodle or CSB. However, variations on detailed performance among these hydrocolloids were observed as reflected by the specific quality indicator.|$|R
50|$|<b>Alginates</b> are {{commonly}} used in wound dressings, and production of dental moulds. In microbiology research, agar — a plant-based goo similar to gelatin and made from seaweed — is extensively used as culture medium. Carrageenans, <b>alginates</b> and agaroses (the latter are prepared from agar by purification), with other lesser-known macroalgal polysaccharides, have several important biological activities or applications in biomedicine.|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} an active oxygen based disinfectant, 2 PerformÂ? (Schulke & Mayr, Germany) on the dimensional accuracy of four <b>alginates,</b> Alginoplast (Heraeus Kulzer, Holland), Kromopan (LASCOD, Italy), Alginmax (MAJOR, Italy) and Duplast (Dentsply, China). Method: A cobalt chromium master model with four cylindrical studs representing 2 canines and 2 molars was constructed. A total of 40 impressions for each <b>alginates</b> were taken and treated in 4 different conditions, Immediate pour (control); 10 minutes immersion in distilled water; 10 minutes immersion in 2 PerformÂ? and 30 minutes in 2 PerformÂ?. The impressions were then poured in Type III stone. Dimensional changes between the master model and the resultant casts were measured using traveling microscope. The change at an antero-posterior dimension (C) and 3 different interarch dimensions (A,B and D) were noted. Results: Two way ANOVA showed significant interaction between <b>alginates</b> and treatment conditions except for dimension B and D. One-way ANOVA test and Student-Newman-Keuls indicated no significant difference (P> 0. 05) in dimensional accuracy of impressions treated with PerformÂ? for 10 minutes compared to the control group except for Alginoplast (dimension A) and Duplast (dimension C and D). The maximum deviation in the dimension after 10 minutes PerformÂ? immersion was 0. 552 for Duplast and 0. 147 to 0. 213 for other <b>alginates.</b> Immersion in PerformÂ? for 30 minutes produced maximum deviation of 0. 591 for Duplast in dimension C whilst 0. 223 to 0. 235 for other <b>alginates.</b> Conclusion: Active oxygen based disinfectant {{has an effect on}} the dimensional accuracy of the resultant cast for the 4 <b>alginates.</b> Although some results indicated significant change, the magnitude of deviation was clinically negligible. Apart from Duplast, all the <b>alginates</b> indicated good stability in 2 PerformÂ? even up to 30 minutes of immersion time. (This study was supported by University of Malaya; R&D FO 200 / 2003 D).

2500|$|P. aeruginosa is a facultative anaerobe, {{as it is}} well {{adapted to}} proliferate in {{conditions}} of partial or total oxygen depletion. This organism can achieve [...] growth with nitrate or nitrite as a terminal electron acceptor. [...] When oxygen, nitrate, and nitrite are absent, {{it is able to}} ferment arginine and pyruvate by substrate-level phosphorylation. Adaptation to microaerobic or anaerobic environments is essential for certain lifestyles of P. aeruginosa, for example, during lung infection in cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia, where thick layers of lung mucus and <b>alginate</b> surrounding mucoid bacterial cells can limit the diffusion of oxygen. P. aeruginosa growth within the human body can be asymptomatic until the bacteria form a biofilm, which overwhelms the immune system. These biofilms are found in the lungs of cystic fibrosis and primary ciliary dyskinesia, and can prove fatal.|$|E
40|$|In a {{previous}} study, we optimized the acidic treatment of brown algae {{to facilitate the}} efficient sequential extraction of fucoidans and <b>alginates,</b> using {{a sample of the}} brown alga Ecklonia radiata. Here, we applied the optimized process to other brown algae feedstocks from South Australia, in order to assess their potential for valorization and to determine whether the process was effective when using different feedstocks. The starting materials included samples of Macrocystis pyrifera, Durvillaea potatorum, Seirococcus axillaris, and two more samples of E. radiata collected from different sites and at different periods. The initial feedstock sample (as used for optimization) was also included for comparison. In terms of product yields, the sequential process appeared to perform similarly for all feedstocks (30 – 40 % of total available fucoidans and 80 – 94 % of total available <b>alginates),</b> with the exception of Seirococcus axillaris (5. 5 and 74 %, respectively). The remainder of the fucoidans either resisted extraction or were hydrolyzed by the acid treatment. The fucoidan extracts had sulfate contents of 10 to 30 % by weight and fucose contents of 12 – 30 % by weight and exhibited antioxidant potential, to which the presence of phlorotannins contributed. The quality of the <b>alginates</b> varied, with M. pyrifera yielding the most viscous (599 mPa s) and colorless <b>alginates,</b> while the <b>alginates</b> from S. axillaris had the lowest mannuronic to guluronic acid ratio (0. 54), indicating the strongest gel-forming capability.

30|$|Algal fibres. Most of the algal fibres are {{resistant}} to hydrolysis by human endogenous digestive enzymes, but are to various degrees fermented by colonic flora. The soluble fibres consists in lamarans (a sort of β-glucan associated with mannitol residues), fucans (sulphated polymers associated with xylose, galactose and glucoronic acid) and <b>alginates</b> (mannuronic and guluronic acid polymers). The insoluble algal polymers consist mainly in cellulose. Fermentation of <b>alginates</b> yields high levels of acetate (80 %), while lamirans yield preferably butyrate (16 %).

50|$|The {{goal of the}} {{extraction}} process is to obtain dry, powdered, sodium <b>alginate.</b> The calcium and magnesium salts do not dissolve in water; the sodium salt does. The rationale behind {{the extraction}} of <b>alginate</b> from the seaweed is to convert all the <b>alginate</b> salts to the sodium salt, dissolve this in water, and remove the seaweed residue by filtration. The <b>alginate</b> must then be recovered from the aqueous solution. The solution is very dilute and evaporation of the water is not economic. To the sodium <b>alginate</b> from the initial extraction solution, a calcium salt is added. This causes calcium <b>alginate</b> to form with a fibrous texture; it does not dissolve in water and can be separated from it with relative ease using a metal screen.|$|E

Liu et al. [75] investigated the effects of hydrocolloids (HPMC, CMC, XG, and AP) at different concentrations on the quality of gluten-free potato-steamed bread. The results showed that steamed breads with hydrocolloids presented higher specific volume and lower hardness, and the rapidly digestible starch and estimated glycemic index significantly decreased from 45.51 to 20.64 and from 69.54 to 55.17, respectively. They suggested that HPMC and XG could be used as improvers in the gluten-free potato-steamed bread.|$|R
