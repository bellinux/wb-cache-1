50|$|There are {{currently}} two recognised subspecies of the <b>African</b> <b>Pied</b> <b>wagtail.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{scientific}} binomial for the <b>African</b> <b>pied</b> <b>wagtail</b> is Motacilla aguimp; Motacilla, {{the name}} of the genus containing all but the forest wagtail of Asia, is from the Latin for a “little mover” while the specific name aguimp from the French for “with a wimple” which refers to the black hood of the <b>African</b> <b>pied</b> <b>wagtail.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>pied</b> <b>wagtail,</b> or African wagtail, (Motacilla aguimp) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Motacillidae.|$|E

50|$|The reserve {{supports}} woodland and grassland {{species such}} as blackcap, linnet, tree pipit, coal tit, goldcrest, turtle dove, great spotted woodpecker, <b>pied</b> <b>wagtail</b> and jackdaw.|$|R
50|$|Kingfishers and dippers {{are two of}} the avian {{species to}} be found on its riverbanks, along with yellow and <b>pied</b> <b>wagtails,</b> chaffinch, {{goldfinch}} and the tiny wren.|$|R
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>pied</b> <b>wagtail</b> is monogamous, the {{cup-shaped}} nest {{is lined}} with grass and feathers and is usually situated near water in a convenient tangle of sticks. In settlements the nest may be located on buildings. The nests of the <b>African</b> <b>pied</b> <b>wagtail</b> are parasitised by the red-chested cuckoo Cuculus solitarius and the diderick cuckoo Chrysococcyx caprius. While chicks have been recorded as prey of Burchell's coucal Centropus burchellii.|$|E
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>pied</b> <b>wagtail</b> {{is mainly}} insectivorous but also feeds on other invertebrates, grass seeds, tadpoles, small fish and scraps of human food.|$|E
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>pied</b> <b>wagtail</b> inhabits {{subtropical}} or tropical seasonally wet or flooded lowland grassland, rivers, and, sometimes, freshwater marshes. In {{some areas}} it is commensal with humans in towns and villages.|$|E
50|$|The male's song is a fast twittering, given from a bush or in flight. The call of {{this species}} is a chis-it double note, {{like that of the}} <b>pied</b> <b>wagtail.</b>|$|R

50|$|Northumberland Wildlife Trust {{asserts that}} the woods {{are one of the}} most northerly {{habitats}} for dormice. Other species associated with the woods include roe deer and red squirrel. Bird species include the <b>pied</b> <b>wagtail</b> and the greater spotted woodpecker.|$|R
50|$|The <b>African</b> <b>pied</b> <b>wagtail</b> {{is found}} in Sub-saharan Africa from the Eastern Cape north to extreme {{southern}} Egypt and from Guinea to western Eritrea and Somalia. It is a vagrant to Burkina Faso, Gambia, Mauritania and the Western Cape.|$|E
50|$|Among the wagtails the <b>African</b> <b>pied</b> <b>wagtail</b> is most {{similar in}} {{appearance}} to the recently discovered Mekong wagtail but genetic {{evidence suggests that}} the two are each other's closest relatives and are each just as related to other black and white wagtails such as the white wagtail M. alba complex or the white-browed wagtail M. maderaspatensis.|$|E
50|$|The Mekong wagtail (Motacilla samveasnae) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Motacillidae. It was first {{described}} in 2001 and named in honour of the late Cambodian ornithologist Sam Veasna. It is {{a black and white}} bird, similar in appearance to the <b>African</b> <b>pied</b> <b>wagtail,</b> although their ranges do not overlap. Its facial features and distinctive voice distinguish it from other black and white wagtails in southeastern Asia.|$|E
50|$|Part of {{this site}} is a working farm which is managed by a tenant farmer, and it also has {{wildlife}} habitats and an education centre. Birds include little owls, spotted flycatchers and <b>pied</b> <b>wagtails,</b> and there are ponds with great crested newts.|$|R
50|$|Birds which {{occasionally}} {{dwell in}} Vidyaranyapura are lesser whistling teal, black headed ibis, purple swamphen, red wattled lapwing, white-cheeked barbet, small green barbet, <b>pied</b> <b>wagtail</b> (Motacilla alba), egret, little grebe, little cormorant, purple heron, oriental darter, spotted dove, bulbul, night heron, spot-billed duck, sandpiper and whistling duck.|$|R
50|$|More than 100 {{host species}} have been recorded: meadow pipit, dunnock and Eurasian reed warbler {{are the most common}} hosts in {{northern}} Europe; garden warbler, meadow pipit, <b>pied</b> <b>wagtail</b> and European robin in central Europe; brambling and common redstart in Finland; and great reed warbler in Hungary.|$|R
5000|$|The {{species was}} {{overlooked}} until 2001 {{when it was}} described. It is named in honour of the late Cambodian ornithologist Sam Veasna. [...] It is most similar in appearance to the <b>African</b> <b>pied</b> <b>wagtail</b> but genetic {{evidence suggests that the}} two are not more closely related to each other compared to other black and white wagtails such as the white wagtail M. alba complex or the white-browed wagtail M. maderaspatensis.|$|E
50|$|The Mekong wagtail {{most closely}} resembles <b>African</b> <b>pied</b> <b>wagtail</b> M. aguimp, {{although}} two species ranges are far apart. It differs from M. agiump in several minor respects, particularly wing pattern, and its vocalisations are very distinctive. It {{is a very}} distinctive species {{and is the only}} black-and-white wagtail in South-East Asia which exhibits the plumage character combination of black forehead, lores and ear coverts, obvious white supercilia, with white a throat and neck patch.|$|E
50|$|The {{origin of}} the genus {{appears to be in}} the general area of Eastern Siberia/Mongolia. Wagtails spread rapidly across Eurasia and {{dispersed}} to Africa in the Zanclean (Early Pliocene)where the sub-Saharan lineage was later isolated. The <b>African</b> <b>pied</b> <b>wagtail</b> (and possibly the Mekong wagtail) diverged prior to the massive radiation of the white-bellied black-throated and most yellow-bellied forms, all of which took place during the late Piacenzian (early Late Pliocene), c. 3 mya.|$|E
50|$|Yarrell has {{a number}} of species named after him, {{including}} the birds yellow-faced siskin Carduelis yarrellii and Chilean woodstar Eulidia yarrellii and the fish Yarrell's blenny Chirolophis ascanii. The British sub-species of the white <b>wagtail,</b> the <b>pied</b> <b>wagtail</b> Motacilla alba yarrellii, was also named for him.|$|R
60|$|<b>PIED</b> <b>WAGTAIL</b> (Motacilla lutor).--Most {{of these}} {{stay with us}} all winter, but one March evening at least forty-three descended on the lawn at Elderfield, doubtless halting in their flight from {{southern}} lands. Most winning birds they are, with their lively hop and jerking tails. Dish-washer is their Hampshire name.|$|R
25|$|The call of {{the white}} wagtail is a sharp chisick, {{slightly}} softer than the version given by the <b>pied</b> <b>wagtail.</b> The song is a pleasant twittering, more regular in white than pied, but with little territorial significance, since the male uses a series of contact calls to attract the female.|$|R
5000|$|Three {{species are}} poly- or paraphyletic {{in the present}} taxonomical {{arrangement}} and either subspecies need to be reassigned and/or species split up. The blue-headed wagtail (AKA yellow wagtail and many other names), especially, {{has always been a}} taxonomical nightmare with over a dozen currently accepted subspecies and many more invalid ones. The two remaining [...] "monochrome" [...] species, Mekong and <b>African</b> <b>pied</b> <b>wagtail</b> may be closely related, or a most striking example of convergent evolution.|$|E
50|$|Stuart Baker in {{his second}} edition of The Fauna of British India {{considered}} this as a subspecies of the white wagtail, calling it Motacilla lugubris maderaspatensis. This was however criticized by C B Ticehurst, who noted that it was much larger, never had the white forehead of the white wagtail, was non-migratory and lacked a spring moult. This species is now considered to form a superspecies with Japanese wagtail, Mekong wagtail and the more distant <b>African</b> <b>pied</b> <b>wagtail.</b> Similarities in pre-copulatory behaviour with the Japanese wagtail have been noted. Its song much resembles that of the recently described Mekong wagtail. mtDNA cytochrome b and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 sequence data {{has not been able}} to robustly resolve the relationships of these birds, especially in respect to the blue-headed wagtail and its relatives.|$|E
5000|$|Williams's {{coat of arms}} {{was granted}} by the Chief Herald of Ireland on 1 November 2006. The escutcheon's formal blazon is in Irish, {{translated}} here as Argent two piles throughout gules three cinquefoils counterchanged ('On white, two red triangles throughout the shield, three cinquefoils in the reverse colour'); the colours {{are those of the}} City of London, and the piles form a W. Along with this was granted a crest, On a wreath of the colours a <b>pied</b> <b>wagtail</b> bearing in its beak Ragged Robin all proper ('On a red and white wreath, a <b>pied</b> <b>wagtail</b> bearing in its beak ragged robin, all in their natural colours'). [...] "Willie wagtail" [...] is common name used for this bird in Ireland. The motto is Grásta Dé a bhfuil agamsa [...] "The Grace of God is all I have"—a pun, where a bhfuil agamsa [...] plays on Williams.|$|R
50|$|Many river birds can {{commonly}} be seen whilst {{sitting in}} the park, including a family of swans, Several types of gulls, cormorants, oystercatchers, little egrets and the occasional grey heron. Jackdaws and <b>pied</b> <b>wagtails</b> also work the shore when the tide is out. Sometimes buzzards, kestrels and birds of prey can be seen hunting. Owls can often be heard at night.|$|R
50|$|The strandline is an {{important}} habitat {{for a variety of}} animals. In parts of the United Kingdom, sandhoppers such as Talitrus saltator and the seaweed fly Coelopa frigida are abundant in the rotting seaweed, and these invertebrates provide food for shore birds such as the rock pipit, turnstone and <b>pied</b> <b>wagtail,</b> and mammals such as brown hares, foxes, voles and mice.|$|R
5000|$|Winter: Whooper swan (fly-over), mallard, cormorant, grey heron, hen harrier, sparrowhawk, buzzard, {{peregrine}} falcon, lapwing, snipe, woodcock, feral pigeon, woodpigeon, kingfisher, meadow pipit, grey <b>wagtail,</b> <b>pied</b> <b>wagtail,</b> dipper, wren, dunnock, robin, stonechat, blackbird, fieldfare, song thrush, redwing, mistle thrush, goldcrest, long-tailed tit, coal tit, blue tit, great tit, treecreeper, magpie, jackdaw, rook, hooded crow, raven, starling, common chaffinch, goldfinch, siskin, lesser redpoll, bullfinch, {{reed bunting}} ...|$|R
40|$|Field data {{concerning}} the time budgets and foraging success of <b>pied</b> <b>wagtails</b> (Motacilla alba yarrelli, Gould) are reanalyzed. It is found that the data are well described by the generalized matching law, with a marked bias towards spending time on the territory. In this case matching is {{not the result of}} maximizing reward rate, but it remains possible that it results from an allocation of time that maximizes survival...|$|R
50|$|At the {{northwest}} {{banks of the}} reservoir is the Osprey Birdhide, {{and this is the}} best place to see the population of cormorants which regularly come to sit on the banks and trees surrounding water. Other species include great crested grebe, swallow, mallard, <b>pied</b> <b>wagtail,</b> coot, Canada goose, rook, and sheep graze in the surrounding water meadows. Black swans, presumably escapes from captivity, can often be seen on the water.|$|R
5000|$|Summer: Grey heron, sparrowhawk, buzzard, lesser black-backed gull, feral pigeon, woodpigeon, cuckoo, swift, sand martin, swallow, house martin, meadow pipit, grey <b>wagtail,</b> <b>pied</b> <b>wagtail,</b> dipper, wren, robin, stonechat, blackbird, song thrush, mistle thrush, {{grasshopper}} warbler, sedge warbler, blackcap, willow warbler, goldcrest, spotted flycatcher, long-tailed tit, coal tit, blue tit, great tit, treecreeper, jay, magpie, jackdaw, rook, hooded crow, starling, house sparrow, chaffinch, greenfinch, goldfinch, lesser redpoll, bullfinch, {{reed bunting}} ...|$|R

25|$|Some of the {{resident}} bird species {{that can be}} seen here are little green bee-eater, blue-tailed bee-eater, plain prinia, ashy prinia, zitting cisticola, greater coucal, pied cuckoo, common kingfisher, pied kingfisher, white-breasted kingfisher, white-breasted waterhen, ruddy-breasted crake, slaty-breasted rail, tricolored munia, Indian silverbill (white-throated munia), scaly-breasted munia, red munia, paddyfield pipit, yellow bittern, black bittern, purple-rumped sunbird, purple sunbird, clamorous reed-warbler, <b>pied</b> <b>wagtail,</b> Asian palm swift, pond heron, black-shouldered kite, spotted dove and laughing dove.|$|R
50|$|Different {{types of}} birds {{can be seen}} here till February end every year. According to Local birders, the lake hosts 90 {{varieties}} of birds. Shovellers, Pintails, common pochard, tufted pochard, common teal, spot-bill, yellow headed <b>wagtail</b> and <b>pied</b> <b>wagtail</b> {{are some of the}} birds that commonly visit the lake. The migratory birds mostly come to {{the eastern part of the}} lake, as the water is deeper and the area is free from human disturbances.|$|R
