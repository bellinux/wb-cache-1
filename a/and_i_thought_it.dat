5|$|That {{shot was}} totally and {{completely}} inspired by 'Something's Got to Give,' Marilyn Monroe's last movie that never got finished. It's {{an homage to}} her, because I've never seen anyone re-create it. So many people have emulated so many of Marilyn's classic moments, but it's just that I'm {{a big fan of}} hers, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was really pretty at night with the pool. No one could ever be as fabulous as Marilyn was, but it's in honor and homage to her.|$|E

500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the album {{took place at}} Record Plant, RCA Studios, and Capitol Recording Studios in Los Angeles in April 1975. Streisand and Columbia Records released Lazy Afternoon on October 1, 1975. It features handwritten liner notes developed by Streisand herself; she opened the booklet by writing, [...] "While I usually let the vinyl speak for itself, I really had fun making this record, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> might interest you {{to know something about}} each song. After all, I wouldn't want to be a chef who doesn't share her secrets!" [...] Additionally, the label issued the album as an 8-track cartridge later in 1975, with the track listing switching the order of [...] "By the Way" [...] and [...] "Widescreen" [...] around. The album was later released in a compact disc format on October 25, 1990.|$|E

I didn't hear a word she said, but the visual was spot on." [...] Palin [...] "and the press corps watched the sketch {{in the back of her}} plane, {{laughing}} at Tina and Amy's satirical take on the two politicians," [...] and Palin later claimed that she had once dressed up as Fey for Halloween. However, Carly Fiorina, a spokeswoman for the John McCain campaign argued that the sketch portrayed Hillary Clinton as [...] "very substantive," [...] but Fiorina thought, in the case of Sarah Palin, that she was portrayed as [...] "totally superficial." [...] Fiorina thought the sketch was [...] "disrespectful in the extreme" [...] and [...] "sexist." ...|$|E
500|$|McCain was {{mentioned}} as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination beginning in 1997, but he took few steps to pursue it, instead concentrating on his 1998 senate re-election. [...] The decision of General Colin Powell not to run helped persuade McCain {{that there might be}} an opening for him. [...] McCain later wrote that he had a [...] "vague aspiration" [...] of running for president for a long time. [...] He would also be candid about his motivation: [...] "I didn't decide to run for president to start a national crusade for the political reforms I believed in or to run a campaign as if it were some grand act of patriotism. In truth, I wanted to be president because it had become my ambition to become president. I was sixty-two years old when I made the decision, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was my one shot at the prize." ...|$|E
500|$|Timmons became {{best known}} as a member of Art Blakey's band the Jazz Messengers, which he was first part of from July 1958 to September 1959, {{including}} for a tour of Europe. He was recruited for the Messengers by saxophonist Benny Golson, who said that [...] "He was inventive, [...] He could play bebop and he could play funky – he could play a lot of things, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was the element that Art needed. He hadn't had anybody quite like Bobby, who could go here or go there, rather than walking in a single corridor." [...] By late 1958 Timmons was sharing bandmate Morgan's East Sixth Street apartment and the pair had bought a piano, allowing Timmons to practice and Morgan to work on composing. From around the time he joined Blakey, Timmons, along with some of his fellow band members, was a heroin user. After leaving Blakey, Timmons joined Cannonball Adderley's band, in October 1959.|$|E

500|$|On April 25, 2007, the duo {{announced}} that they would embark {{on a tour of}} Canada performing in all 10 provinces, plus Yukon, Nunavut and Northwest Territories. In the words of Jack: [...] "Having never done a tour of Canada, Meg <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was high time to go whole hog. We want to take this tour to {{the far reaches of the}} Canadian landscape. From the ocean to the permafrost. The best way for us to do that is ensure that we perform in every province and territory in the country, from the Yukon to Prince Edward Island. Another special moment of this tour is the show which will occur in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia on July 14, The White Stripes' Tenth Anniversary." [...] Canadian fiddler Ashley MacIsaac opened for the band at the Glace Bay show; earlier in 2007, MacIsaac and Jack had discovered that they were distantly related. It was also at this time that White learned he was related to Canadian fiddle player Natalie MacMaster.|$|E
500|$|As the character's storyline progressed, {{he became}} [...] "one {{of the most}} devious {{characters}} on daytime" [...] {{as part of a}} Gothic plot in which Adam secretly torments Ashley, Victor's love interest, to get revenge on his father. The story called for Adam to be blind, with uncertainty whether his condition is genuine. Engen told Julie McElwain of Soaps In Depth that he was not sure how to portray the blindness. He said, [...] "I didn't want to nail it on the head completely with the blindness, because I wasn't sure if the blindness was real. Signy [...] won awards for her portrayal of retinitis pigmentosa, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be a dishonor to that if I came too close to the mark." [...] Engen said that he thought that former executive producers, Maria Arena Bell and Paul Rauch, and the writers [...] "know what they're doing, and right now it would seem like Adam is instigating more...drama." [...] The actor worried whether the character's actions might lead to him becoming [...] "irredeemable", but also said he took it as a challenge to make what Adam does [...] "interesting and human".|$|E
500|$|... "Trust No 1" [...] {{was written}} by series creator Chris Carter along with {{executive}} producer Frank Spotnitz; it was directed by Tony Wharmby. The episode features former leading star David Duchovny via the use of previously shot footage. According to Matt Hurwitz and Chris Knowles in their book The Complete X-Files, the episode includes themes [...] "about Orwellian surveillance." [...] "Trust No 1" [...] was written in response to fans who felt that, during season eight, Mulder's abduction was not dealt with until his miraculous return in [...] "This is Not Happening"/"DeadAlive". Despite this, series director Kim Manners was critical of this take on Mulder, noting, [...] "The only thing I thought we didn't do right during seasons eight and nine was {{that a lot of}} the shows were about Mulder, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was a mistake to make a series about a man that wasn't standing in front of the camera." [...] The email addresses that Mulder and Scully use to communicate with each other were real addresses, created and maintained by Ten Thirteen Productions. The tagline for the episode is [...] "They're Watching", changed from the usual [...] "The Truth is Out There".|$|E

500|$|Director Mamoru Oshii stated, [...] "My intuition told me {{that this}} story about a futuristic world carried an {{immediate}} message for our present world. I am also interested in computers through my own personal experience with them. I had the same feeling about Patlabor <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> {{would be interesting to}} make a film {{that took place in the}} near future. There are only a few movies, even out of Hollywood, which clearly portray the influence and power of computers. I thought this theme would be more effectively conveyed through animation." [...] Oshii expanded on these thoughts in a later interview, noting that technology changes people and had become a part of the culture of Japan. He commented that his use of philosophy caused producers to become frustrated because of sparing use of action scenes. Oshii also acknowledged that a movie with more action would sell better, but he continued to make these movies anyway. When Oshii went back to make changes to the original Ghost in the Shell to re-release it as Ghost in the Shell 2.0, one of the reasons he gave was that the film did not resemble the sequel. He wanted to update the film to reflect changes in perspective.|$|E
500|$|Showrunner Al Jean {{noted in}} an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly that it was easy to cast Lynch, since [...] "she can do edge, sweetness, and a mix of both". He further noted that the crew was happy when she agreed to take the role, and that he was [...] "embarrassed [...] didn’t ask her before she was so successful because she’s funny in everything she does." [...] Lynch recorded her scenes together with cast member Dan Castellaneta, who voices Homer. In an interview with the website Hollywood Outbreak, she commented that [...] "It was pretty amazing to {{every once in a while}} look up at his face and go 'Oh my God, it's that guy that does that voice.'" [...] Lynch added that she [...] "had the best time. I would do it again and again. This is kind of very much a milestone in my career. I will point to this as a big deal." [...] In an interview with Fox All Access, Lynch revealed that she is a longtime fan: [...] "Indeed I am a fan of The Simpsons. I started watching twenty years ago. I remember the first season. I remember clearly moments from the episodes <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was revolutionary, the comedy of it. I really loved it." ...|$|E
500|$|The Kinks {{started out}} playing the then popular R and blues styles; then, under the {{influence}} of The Kingsmen's [...] "Louie Louie" [...] recording, developed louder rock and hard rock sounds — due to their pioneering contribution to the field, they have often been labelled as [...] "the original punks". Dave Davies was [...] "really bored with this guitar sound – or lack of an interesting sound" [...] so he purchased [...] "a little green amplifier ... an Elpico" [...] from a radio spares shop in Muswell Hill, and [...] "twiddled around with it", including [...] "taking the wires going to the speaker and putting a jack plug on there and plugging it straight into my AC3O" [...] (a larger amplifier), but didn't get the sound he wanted until he got frustrated and [...] "got a single-sided Gillette razorblade and cut round the cone ... so it was all shredded but still on there, still intact. I played <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was amazing." [...] The jagged sound of the amplifier was replicated in the studio; the Elpico was plugged into the Vox AC30, and the resulting effect became a mainstay in The Kinks' early recordings—most notably on [...] "You Really Got Me" [...] and [...] "All Day and All of the Night".|$|E

500|$|She {{lived for}} a few months in a flat Starr owned at 34 Montagu Square, central London, but {{returned}} to Kenwood as Lennon and Ono preferred to live there instead, rather than in isolated Weybridge. Lennon and Cynthia had one last short meeting at Kenwood (with Ono alongside Lennon), where Lennon accused her of having an affair in India, saying she was no [...] "innocent little flower". McCartney visited her and Julian that year, and on the way to Kenwood he composed a song in his head which later became [...] "Hey Jude". Talking about their divorce, McCartney later said: [...] "We'd been very good friends for millions of years <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was a bit much for them suddenly to be personae non gratae and out of my life". Cynthia recalled, [...] "I was truly surprised when, one afternoon, Paul arrived on his own. I was touched by his obvious concern for our welfare ... On the journey down he composed 'Hey Jude' in the car. I will never forget Paul's gesture of care and concern in coming to see us." [...] She was once asked if Lennon had written any songs about their time together, and answered: [...] "It was too sloppy when you were young to dedicate anything to anybody. Macho Northern men didn't do that in those days". In contrast, Lennon said he wrote the 1965 song [...] "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)" [...] about an affair he was having, but rendered it in [...] "gobbledegook" [...] so Cynthia would not know.|$|E
500|$|After touring {{in support}} of One by One, Dave Grohl was {{uncertain}} {{on what to do}} next with the Foo Fighters. He felt that rushing to do another record would not be creatively rewarding. Grohl considered a possible film score, and began writing acoustic songs, eventually amassing a full album's worth of songs. Grohl, not wanting to make a solo album and accepting the drift from his usual style, brought the songs to the Foo Fighters – [...] "who's to say what we should sound like?". Bassist Nate Mendel replied that the songs' uncharacteristic sound was [...] "why [...] should go on the record." [...] Grohl decided against an acoustic record, saying [...] "I have to have loud rock music in my life somewhere", and decided to make a double album, with [...] "one CD that's all the really heavy rock shit" [...] and another [...] "that's really beautiful, acoustic-based, lower dynamic stuff", which Grohl described as [...] "the bottle and the hangover", and also with the rock record being [...] "my Jack and Coke record" [...] with songs that [...] "I realise I cannot live without that", and the acoustic being [...] "my Sapphire-and-Martini-with-Kylie record". Grohl also stated a decisive moment in making a double album was uploading demos to his computer and realizing he had five hours of music, adding that [...] "we've been a band for 10 years now, this is our fifth record, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would be boring to just keep making album after album and making videos and playing festivals, so I wanted to do something special." ...|$|E
500|$|Born in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, Bridges {{began his}} career with local side Cambridge United, whom he joined {{at the age of}} 8, he progressed through the club's youth system before signing his first {{professional}} contract in February 2002. He broke into the first-team {{towards the end of the}} 2001–02 season, making his debut as a substitute in a 1–0 defeat against Huddersfield Town at the Abbey Stadium. He played six further games in the same season, scoring his first goal for Cambridge in a 2–1 home win against Tranmere Rovers. Bridges featured regularly in the opening half of the 2002–03 season, playing a total of 25 times and scoring once in a 3–0 victory against York City. However, a [...] "persistent" [...] ankle injury cut his run in the first-team short, and he did not feature from February onwards. He returned to first-team action in a 1–0 defeat to Wycombe Wanderers in October 2003, and played a further 22 times for the club throughout the 2003–04 campaign. However, Bridges left Cambridge at the end of the season after failing to agree a contract extension. On leaving Cambridge, Bridges said [...] "I was offered a contract that was almost a kick in the teeth after the time I had been at the club when players were coming in from all over the place who did not care about the club. They were getting paid five or six times what I was offered, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> was probably time to move on". During his three seasons with the club, Bridges made a total of 55 appearances in all competitions,scoring four times.|$|E

500|$|In April 2004, Clarkson {{entered the}} studio {{immediately}} after the Independent Tour. She said in an interview, [...] "I've written most of (the songs) so far, but there's {{some people who have}} some stuff for me. I'm not {{one of those people who}} thinks you have to write everything. (I'll sing it) as long as I can relate to it." [...] During the album's development, Davis revealed that he was reluctant to let Clarkson write material for the album. He revealed, [...] "I always encourage people to write their own songs, but in the pop arena, where the career is totally dependent on hits, you get skeptical. Artists with great voices like Melissa Manchester and Taylor Dayne could have had much longer careers if they didn't insist on writing their own material." [...] Clarkson reiterates that she's been writing songs since her teens, but rather than argue over labels or abilities, the two reached a détente—she would co-write half the album, with the other half being penned by other songwriters and producers. She said, [...] "I just think it's funny that all these middle-age guys told me, 'You don't know how a pop song needs to sound.' I'm a 23-year-old girl! But I was fighting those battles alone." [...] In February 2004, Clarkson met with musicians Ben Moody and David Hodges, who had just departed from their band Evanescence in late 2003. She said, [...] "I didn't know that he (Moody) wasn't with Evanescence anymore," [...] Clarkson said. [...] "I just really liked their vibe <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> might be cool to work with one of them. So I just randomly asked people I work with, 'Hey, do you think that he'd work with me?' And then I found out that he kind of split and that's what he's doing... so it worked out perfectly." [...] Moody recalled, [...] "It's cool because she wants to do some branching out, and I'm doing nothing but branching out, we got together and she had all these songs in mind of what she wanted to do. It's just a really, really cool process for me, because everybody is a new experience. Everybody works differently." ...|$|E
