5|$|Admiral Nimitz {{recommended}} to the Joint Chiefs of Staff that development <b>and</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> base facilities be placed under SOPAC by extending its border westward {{to include the}} Admiralties. MacArthur was furious; the borders of SWPA could not be changed {{without the consent of}} the Australian government. Nimitz's proposal was eventually turned down by the Joint Chiefs but not before MacArthur restricted access to the facilities to ships of the United States Seventh Fleet and British Pacific Fleet. Halsey was summoned to MacArthur's headquarters in Brisbane on 3March 1944, and the two agreed to a compromise. Responsibility {{for the development of the}} base passed from Krueger's Alamo Force to Kinkaid's Allied Naval Forces on 18May 1944.

5|$|Dating back to 1910, {{the route}} US6 follows was {{originally}} the Great White Way and River-to-River Road. Both were auto trails which connected Council Bluffs and Davenport. When the U.S. Highway System {{was created in}} 1926, the highway was designated U.S. Highway 32. US 32 was renumbered in 1931 as US6 was extended to the west coast. As the Interstate Highway System expanded in the 1950-1970s, US6's importance as a cross-state route was diminished by I-80. As a result, the least-traveled sections of the route were moved onto I-80 <b>and</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vacated sections of highway was given to local jurisdictions.|$|E
5|$|For the Brazilian Empire, expansionist {{plans on}} the part of powerful, republican Argentina {{represented}} an existential threat.
