(Of course, this phase of analysis and revamping in itself can be, and usually is, a diseconomy leading to hiring of new personnel and investment in new, competing systems.) This leads to increased productivity. Improved management systems and more effective control of labor and operations can lower overhead.|$|E

25|$|After gaining some {{knowledge}} of the language, Dyer faced the challenge of producing movable metallic types {{for the thousands of}} Chinese characters. He started with <b>a</b> <b>systematic</b> <b>analysis</b> of characters and strokes. At first, using wood reliefs to create the clay moulds from which type could be cast, he soon moved to steel punches and copper matrixes. Dyer's linguistic abilities, meticulous planning, and painstaking attention to detail resulted in Chinese fonts of high quality. They were later passed on to the American Presbyterian Mission Press in China and played a significant part in its development.|$|E
25|$|The {{working group}} 'Structure', led by Chieti University and coordinated by Chieti and Rome-III University, {{constructed}} a structural {{map of the}} Majella mountain. This structural framework is accompanied by five structural cross-sections of the anticline, which together {{provide an overview of}} the internal structure of the Majella mountain. The Working Group furthermore performed <b>a</b> <b>systematic</b> <b>analysis</b> of kinematic data collected on fault surfaces (indications for type of movement and timing of the fault network). This resulted in a detailed framework for the deformation history of the Majella anticline, which shows the style of movement on various sets of faults and their relationships in time. In order to obtain a constraint on the type of stress field responsible for the deformations observed, a paleostress analysis using numerical inversion techniques was performed on the same kinematic data, and a palaeo-stress map was constructed.|$|E

2500|$|The {{logic of}} Aristotle, and {{particularly}} {{his theory of}} the syllogism, has had an enormous influence in Western thought. Aristotle was the first logician to attempt <b>a</b> <b>systematic</b> <b>analysis</b> of logical syntax, of noun (or term), and of verb. He was the first formal logician, in that he demonstrated the principles of reasoning by employing variables to show the underlying logical form of an argument. He sought relations of dependence which characterize necessary inference, and distinguished the validity of these relations, from {{the truth of the}} premises (the soundness of the argument). He was the first to deal with the principles of contradiction and excluded middle in a systematic way.|$|E
2500|$|He {{has written}} a series of books on eco-socialism and green politics. Getting There: Steps Towards a Green Society was {{published}} in 1990, {{and looked at the}} strategies of green politics. A Green Manifesto for the 1990s, also written in 1990, outlined the Green vision. In 1994, a book examining the roots of ecological politics, Green History: A Reader in Environmental Literature, Philosophy, and Politics and Weaving a Bower Against Endless Night: An Illustrated History of the Green Party as a Green Party publication appeared. Having taken a BSc in Archaeology at the University of London, he subsequently completed a PhD at the University of the West of England, later published in a revised form in 1999 as a book entitled Earth First! and the Anti-Roads Movement: Radical Environmentalism and Comparative Social Movements. Academic reviews for the book were mixed. One academic reviewer commented that the book offered [...] "valuable and often original information about the radical environmentalist movement" [...] but [...] "fails to provide <b>a</b> <b>systematic</b> <b>analysis</b> of the topic" [...] and uncritically paid little attention to possible personal agendas of the activists interviewed.|$|E
