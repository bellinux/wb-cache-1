The inter-seasonal adsorptive heat storage (AHS) has been considered {{as a tool to}} harmonize the heat availability and demand, and, hence, to cover/reduce heating peaks in winter period (see 3.1).|$|R

In the head and neck area, it may follow the fascial planes and is characterized by sudden swelling, crepitus on palpation, infrequent pain, and air emboli on radiography.

Some reports have described subcutaneous emphysema caused by dental procedures; however, severe emphysema related to peri-implantitis after treatment has not been documented. <b>Accordingly,</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> report describes a rare case of subcutaneous cervical emphysema resulting from the use of an air-powder abrasive device to treat peri-implantitis.|$|R
