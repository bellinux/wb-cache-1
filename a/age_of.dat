5|$|Prior to the {{completion}} of <b>Age</b> <b>of</b> Empires, Ensemble Studios had {{signed a contract with}} Microsoft for a sequel. The design team chose to set The <b>Age</b> <b>of</b> Kings in the Middle Ages as a logical progression from the ancient era setting of <b>Age</b> <b>of</b> Empires. The design team was conscious of attempting to capture the broad appeal of the first game without making the game's design too similar. Nonetheless, they attempted to appeal to the vast demographic who played <b>Age</b> <b>of</b> Empires. The <b>Age</b> <b>of</b> Kingss design team intended to complete the game within a year by using code from the original and reusing the Genie game engine. Several months into the process they found they {{would not be able to}} complete a game of the quality they sought in that time. Ensemble Studios informed Microsoft they would need another year and instead created , an easily developed expansion pack of <b>Age</b> <b>of</b> Empires, as a compromise which could be released for Christmas 1998. To help meet the next year's deadline, additional programmers, artists, and designers were employed. To overcome another significant objection to <b>Age</b> <b>of</b> Empires—that of path finding—the team completely redesigned the game engine's movement system.|$|E
