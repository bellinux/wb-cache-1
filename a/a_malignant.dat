5|$|Lung cancer, {{also known}} as lung carcinoma, is <b>a</b> <b>malignant</b> lung tumor {{characterized}} by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the lung.

Most cancers that start in the lung, known as primary lung cancers, are carcinomas. The two main types are small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The most common symptoms are coughing (including coughing up blood), weight loss, shortness of breath, and chest pains.|$|E

5|$|After {{complaining}} of headaches and suffering slurred speech beginning in early 1943, McNary {{went to the}} Bethesda, Maryland, Naval Hospital on November 8, 1943, where doctors diagnosed <b>a</b> <b>malignant</b> brain tumor.

He and his family departed for Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to spend the winter.

5|$|Democratic U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy was re-elected in 2006, {{and died}} on August 25, 2009 from <b>a</b> <b>malignant</b> brain tumor.

Kirk to succeed Kennedy until a special election could be held. Kirk's appointment was especially controversial, as the Governor's ability to appoint an interim Senator was removed during the Romney administration by the Democratic-controlled legislature, as a precaution if Senator and presidential nominee John Kerry was elected President in 2004. Laws surrounding Senate appointment were quickly changed following Kennedy's death. The Massachusetts Republican Party sued {{in an attempt to}} halt Kirk's appointment, but it was rejected by Suffolk Superior Court Judge Thomas Connolly.|$|E

The King was well enough to open the Festival of Britain in May 1951, but on 23 September 1951, his left lung was removed by Clement Price Thomas after <b>a</b> <b>malignant</b> tumour was found. In October 1951, Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh went on a month-long tour of Canada; the trip had been delayed for a week due to the King's illness. At the State Opening of Parliament in November, the King's speech from the throne was read for him by the Lord Chancellor, Lord Simonds.

5|$|On April 14, 1960, Cooper {{underwent}} surgery at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston for an aggressive form {{of prostate cancer}} which had metastasized to his colon.

After recuperating over the summer, Cooper took his family on vacation {{to the south of}} France before traveling to England in the fall to make his last film, The Naked Edge. In December 1960, he worked on the NBC television documentary The Real West, which was part of the company's Project 20 series. On December 27, his wife learned from their family doctor that Cooper's cancer had spread to his lungs and bones and was inoperable. His family decided not to tell him immediately.|$|E
5|$|Robson {{defeated}} bowel {{cancer in}} 1992, <b>a</b> <b>malignant</b> melanoma in 1995, and a tumour {{in his right}} lung and a brain tumour, both in 2006. Treatment of these conditions had left him partially paralysed due to a stroke caused by the brain tumour, and also with a partially prosthetic upper jaw after the melanoma was surgically removed. His fifth diagnosis of cancer in 2007, consisting of cancerous nodules in both lungs, was diagnosed as terminal in February 2007, and as of December 2008, was being controlled through bouts of chemotherapy. After these experiences, and following his fifth diagnosis with cancer, Robson devoted the remaining {{years of his life}} to helping fight the disease. On 25 March 2008, he launched the Sir Bobby Robson Foundation. By November 2008, the Foundation had raised £1million. The money raised by the Foundation funded equipment for the Sir Bobby Robson Cancer Trials Research Centre, in the Freeman Hospital in Newcastle upon Tyne, and would go on to fund other cancer projects in the North East of England.|$|E

5|$|Warwick {{had planned}} for Edward {{to marry a}} French princess—Bona of Savoy—to create an {{alliance}} between the two countries. The young king, however, favoured ties with Burgundy and, in 1464, further angered the Earl by secretly marrying Elizabeth Woodville; as an impoverished Lancastrian widow, she was regarded by the Yorkists as an unsuitable queen. Edward bestowed gifts of land and titles on her relations and arranged their marriages to rich and powerful families. Eligible bachelors were paired with the Woodville females, narrowing the marriage prospects for Warwick's daughters. Furthermore, the Earl was offended by two matches involving his kin. The first was the marriage of his aunt, Lady Katherine Neville, over 60years old, to Elizabeth's 20-year-old brother, John Woodville, a pairing considered outside of normal wedlock by many people. The other was his nephew's fiancée, the daughter of Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter, who was taken as a bride by the Queen's son, Thomas Grey, with Edward's approval. Exasperated by these acts, Warwick decided the Woodvilles were <b>a</b> <b>malignant</b> influence on his liege. He felt marginalized: his influence over the young king was failing, {{and he decided to}} take drastic action to force Edward's compliance. Warwick's alternative plan was to replace the King with his fellow conspirator, the Duke of Clarence, Edward's younger brother.|$|E
