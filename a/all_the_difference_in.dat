Terry Lee Rioux, Kelley's biographer, noted that the film proved [...] "that it was the character-driven play that made <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> Star Trek". The slow pacing, extended reaction shots, and the film's lack of action scenes led fans and critics to give the film a variety of nicknames, including The Motionless Picture, The Slow Motion Picture, The Motion Sickness, and Where Nomad [...] Has Gone Before.|$|E

"The {{consensus}} among the music press was that Mariah's insistence on {{including the new}} material made <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> increasing sales figures more than expected. Including some new with the old in a greatest-hits package had been tried {{from time to time}} by other artists with varying degrees of success, but with the triumph of #1's, it would become a regular element in nearly all future greatest-hits albums. As such packages go, #1's was a solid retrospective of Mariah's chart hits, but because these songs were oversaturating the radio, including a favorite nonhit album track or two might have made a nice change. The new songs were a definite bones even though none ever really rose to the spectacular level of her best ... they added up to a nice touch but little more." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{reaction}} {{to the introduction of}} the bikini in Paris, American [...] compromised cautiously by producing their own similar design that included a halter and a midriff-bottom variation. Though size makes <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> a bikini, early bikinis often covered the navel. When the navel showed in pictures, it was airbrushed out by magazines like Seventeen. Navel-less women ensured the early dominance of European bikini makers over their American counterparts. By {{the end of the decade}} a vogue for strapless styles developed, wired or bound for firmness and fit, along with a taste for bare-shouldered two-pieces called Little Sinners. But, it was the halterneck bikini that caused the most moral controversy because of its degree of exposure. So much so as bikini designs called [...] "Huba Huba" [...] and [...] "Revealation" [...] were withdrawn from fashion parades in Sydney as immodest.|$|E

500|$|Although {{available}} only on limited release {{in many parts}} of the Western world, Lucian Pintilie's production has attracted significant interest abroad, and was granted a special reception at the Telluride Film Festival. John Simon describes the film as [...] "witty, harrowing, wonderful", and, in one of his comparative essays on cinema traditions, lists it among the most notable European works of 1994 (alongside Yves Angelo's Colonel Chabert and Nanni Moretti's Caro diario). His colleague Hoberman added the film to a [...] "10 Best" [...] list for 1994. Berardinelli draws a parallel between An Unforgettable Summer and Before the Rain, by Macedonian director Milcho Manchevski, noting that, for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> setting and approach, they deal with similar subjects. He writes: [...] "If nothing else, these two pictures taken together underline the unhappy truth that, in the Balkans, little has changed over the past seventy years." ...|$|E
500|$|Pompeo {{garnered}} widespread acclaim {{from television}} critics for her {{performance in the}} episode; Rick Porter of Zap2it was largely laudatory of Pompeo's performance which he thought [...] "made <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the episode". He wrote highly of {{her role in the}} arc saying, [...] "Without Meredith, and without one of Pompeo's strongest performances in her long time on the show, [...] "How to Save a Life" [...] would have run the risk of coming across as a baldly manipulative death episod". He noted that although it might not be the [...] "ideal Emmy-submission episode" [...] for Pompeo, because of {{the amount of time that}} she spent on screen, it was among the best work she's ever done on the show." [...] Robert Bianco of USA Today thought of the episode as [...] "a showcase for Pompeo", agreeing that although she didn't play a prominent part until the later half of the episode, but some memorable and well-played scenes: [...] "from her angry response to the doctor who tries to tell her what her choices are, to her resignation when she realizes she has to comfort and motivate the young doctor whose mistakes cost Derek his life." [...] Alexandria Ingham Guardian Liberty Voice was also impressed with Pompeo’s [...] "range of emotions", which she described similarly, as going through many stages, including anger, resignation compassion.|$|E

2500|$|In his seminal {{critical}} study {{about homosexuality}} in the movies, The Celluloid Closet, film historian Vito Russo wrote: [...] "Desert Hearts {{is a love}} story that recreates with perceptiveness and tenderness what {{it might have been}} like for two women of different generations and backgrounds to fall in love in the Fifties....Deitch's refusal to feature the straight world's reaction to lesbianism as the focus of her film made <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the way the relationship between the women was perceived by audiences." [...] He remarked about Vincent Canby's review of the film: [...] "In the New York Times, Vincent Canby complained that we are not given enough information about the quality of Vivian's broken marriage, asking if perhaps her lesbianism was a hysterical reaction to her divorce. This is the point at which many heterosexual critics disqualify themselves from perceptively reviewing gay films." ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{seen from}} the Earth, {{the time it takes}} for the Moon to return to a node, the draconic month, is less than the time it takes for the Moon to return to the same {{ecliptic}} longitude as the Sun: the synodic month. The main reason is that during the time that the Moon has completed an orbit around the Earth, the Earth (and Moon) have completed about [...] of their orbit around the Sun: the Moon has to make up for this in order to come again into conjunction or opposition with the Sun. Secondly, the orbital nodes of the Moon precess westward in ecliptic longitude, completing a full circle in about [...] 18.60 years, so a draconic month is shorter than a sidereal month. In <b>all,</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> period between synodic and draconic month is nearly [...] days. Likewise, as {{seen from the}} Earth, the Sun passes both nodes as it moves along its ecliptic path. The period for the Sun to return to a node is called the eclipse or draconic year: about 346.6201 d, which is about [...] year shorter than a sidereal year because of the precession of the nodes.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the association between}} venture capital (VC) backing {{and the likelihood of}} firm overvaluation in the high-tech bubble period. We find strong evidence that a VC-backed firm is more likely than a non-VC-backed firm to be overvalued during the bubble period. A further investigation suggests that such an association exists only for VC-backed firms that have gone public recently and VC-backed firms over which venture capitalists (VCs) have high ownership or control. But outside <b>the</b> bubble period, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> overvaluation between VC-backed and non-VC-backed firms disappear. Our findings provide additional evidence supporting VC opportunism in boom periods. © 2013, The Eastern Finance Association...|$|R
2500|$|With urban {{generation}} {{from the}} turn of the twentieth century picking up, economists forecast that globalization and the powers of multinational corporations would shift the balance of power away from nation states towards individual cities, which would then compete with neighboring cities and cities elsewhere for the most lucrative modern industries, and which increasingly in major Western Europe and U.S.cities did not include manufacturing. Thus cities set about [...] "reinventing themselves", giving precedence to the value given by culture. Municipalities and non-profit organizations hope the use of a Starchitect will drive traffic and tourist income to their new facilities. With the popular and critical success of the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, by Frank Gehry, in which a rundown area of a city in economic decline brought in huge financial growth and prestige, the media started to talk about the so-called [...] "Bilbao Effect"; a star architect designing a blue-chip, prestige building was thought to make <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> producing a landmark for the city. Similar examples are the Imperial War Museum North (2002), Greater Manchester, UK, by Daniel Libeskind, the Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art, Helsinki, Finland, by Steven Holl, and the Seattle Central Library (2004), Washington state, United States, by OMA.|$|E

30|$|The {{significance}} of the observed variances in γ and R between the two subsets (R 1 and R 2) of the XW dataset (Table  1) had been tested. We randomly subdivide the 12, 524 landslides into two subsets with 6, 297 and 6, 227 landslides respectively for 1, 000 times. The results show that, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> parameters observed between the R 1 and R 2 subsets is statistical significant at a significant level of 0.05, except for <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> rollover estimated using the double Pareto distribution (− 2.51), which has a significant level of about 0.21. Therefore, from the conservative point of view, we attribute the observed variances in rollover to random processes but suggest a physical explanation for the variances in power exponent.|$|R

We see how erroneous the often-repeated statement is, that only the crests of the bones which give attachment to muscles vary in shape, and that only parts of slight importance become modified under domestication. No one will say, for instance, that the occipital foramen, or the atlas, or the third cervical vertebra is a part of slight importance. If the several vertebrae of the wild and lop-eared rabbits, of which figures have been given, had been found fossil, palaeontologists would have declared without hesitation that they had belonged to distinct species.|$|R

2500|$|Maiorescu was {{especially}} {{fond of the}} way in which Caragiale balanced his personal perspective and the generic traits he emphasized: speaking of Leiba Zibal, the Jewish character in O făclie de Paşte who defends himself out of fear, he drew a comparison with Shakespeare's Shylock. He thus noted that, for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> style between <b>the</b> two authors, both their characters stood for the Jewish people as a whole. This assessment was backed by Maiorescu's adversary, Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea. George Călinescu also believed that, aside from his individual nature, Zibal provided readers with an accurate insight into Jewish reactions to systemic persecution and death threats. Such assessments were rejected by Paul Zarifopol, who opposed generalizations and commented that the work only referred to [...] "he ingenious cruelty of a man maddened by fear".|$|R

For his services to textual criticism and the understanding of Biblical manuscripts, he was granted a Civil list pension in 1872. He was an advocate of the Byzantine text (majority text) over more modern manuscripts as a source for Bible translations. He was the first to distinguish the Textus Receptus from the Byzantine text.

30|$|Coming to {{the main}} {{variables}} {{of interest in this}} study, the contribution of working conditions to the observed earnings differential is quite limited. Neither flexibility, autonomy, strain by risk, nor pressure and overstrain contribute to the earnings differential in a statistically significant way and the respective coefficients are all smaller than 1  %. Only variety is statistically significant (at the 1  % level), but it has the “wrong” sign. Having more variety at work contributes to 0.7 and 1.2  % higher self-employment earnings relative to paid employees’ wages for men and women, respectively. This is not consistent with the idea that the self-employed accept lower earnings in exchange for more variety at work.
