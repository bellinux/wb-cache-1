40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to know the implementation of education management at Al Azhar Play Group. This research is descriptive. The data were obtained by interviewing the Principal, teacher, and administration staff. The results show that there are ten activities of learning program scope management done by institution members. They are: making a yearly working program, making an education calendar, scheduling the learning activities, planning <b>the</b> learning activities, <b>arranging</b> <b>the</b> opening of a new academic year, <b>arranging</b> <b>the</b> implementation of learning program activities, <b>arranging</b> <b>the</b> playing activities, <b>arranging</b> <b>the</b> evaluation of learning program implementation,implementing the guidance and counseling, and <b>arranging</b> <b>the</b> closing of academic year. It can be concluded that if the curriculum or learning program, {{as a part of the}} education management is implemented well, then the play group management will be quality...|$|R

50|$|The puzzle has 150 movable pieces: 60 corner pieces, 60 edge {{pieces that}} are {{adjacent}} to a pentagonal face (so-called pentagonal edges) and 30 edge pieces that are not (non-pentagonal edges). Only even permutations of all three types of pieces are possible (i.e. {{it is impossible to}} have only one pair of identical pieces swapped). Thus, there are 60!/2 possible ways to <b>arrange</b> <b>the</b> corner pieces, 60!/2 ways to <b>arrange</b> <b>the</b> pentagonal edges and 30!/2 ways to <b>arrange</b> <b>the</b> non-pentagonal edges.|$|R

5|$|Aiello masterminded several {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts to}} assassinate Capone, and fought against his former business partner Antonio Lombardo, a Capone ally, {{for control of}} the Chicago branch of the Unione Siciliana benevolent society. Aiello and his ally Bugs Moran are believed to have <b>arranged</b> <b>the</b> murder of Lombardo, which directly led Capone to organize the St. Valentine's Day Massacre in retaliation.|$|E
5|$|Although the European colonial {{occupation}} of Egypt destroyed {{a significant portion}} of the country's historical legacy, some foreigners left more positive marks.

5|$|Although {{they were}} pagan, the Hungarians {{demonstrated}} a tolerant attitude towards Christians, Jews, and Muslims. The Byzantine Church {{was the first}} to successfully proselytize among their leaders: in 948 the horka, and around 952 the gyula, were baptized in Constantinople. In contrast, the grand prince Géza (c.970–997) received baptism according to the Latin rite. He erected fortresses and invited foreign warriors to develop a new army based on heavy cavalry. Géza also <b>arranged</b> <b>the</b> marriage of his son, Stephen, with Giselle of Bavaria, a princess from the family of the Holy Roman Emperors.|$|E
5|$|Another {{change was}} the {{transition}} to the use of judges as the electoral returning officer for South Australia. This was done to impose state control on a system which had effectively combined the administration of the national and state electoral rolls. On 27 May 1925, Denny <b>arranged</b> <b>the</b> appointment of Judge Herbert Kingsley Paine of the Insolvency Court to be appointed as Electoral Officer for the state, replacing Charles Mathews, a state public servant who had held the position since 1907. Denny had previously worked for Paine as a legal associate.|$|E

5|$|Built by J.W.Walker and Sons, {{the organ}} was {{completed}} {{only two days}} before the opening of the cathedral in 1967. Made {{as an integral part of}} the new cathedral, the architect, Frederick Gibberd, saw the casework as part of his brief and so designed the striking front to the organ. Using decorative woodwork, Gibberd was inspired by the innovative use of the pipes at Coventry Cathedral and the Royal Festival Hall and so <b>arranged</b> <b>the</b> shiny zinc pipes and brass trumpets en chamade to contrast strikingly with concrete pillars which surround the organ.|$|E

5|$|For {{activities}} {{open to the}} public, such {{as community}} gatherings, school events, or trade shows, a police- or media-issued press pass may offer little advantage. Free or reduced-price admission, or guaranteed entry, can sometimes be <b>arranged.</b> <b>The</b> benefits may be more extensive, granting access to front-row seats or to press-only rooms. For sporting events, a press pass issued by a stadium grants access to the press box. Because open events are usually funded by paying attendees, the number of press passes may depend {{on the number of}} tickets sold.|$|E
5|$|For many years, revellers {{celebrating the}} New Year have {{gathered}} in the square {{despite a lack of}} celebrations being <b>arranged.</b> <b>The</b> lack of official events was partly because the authorities were concerned that encouraging more partygoers would cause overcrowding. Since 2003, a firework display centred on the London Eye and South Bank of the Thames has been provided as an alternative. Since 2014, New Year celebrations have been organised by the Greater London Authority in conjunction with the charity Unicef, who began ticketing the event to control crowd numbers.|$|E

Todd Rundgren <b>arranged</b> <b>the</b> background vocals, which were performed by Ellen Foley, Gina Taylor and Deliria Wilde. The song was released as a single in the United Kingdom during October 1989, but only reached No. 51 in the singles charts. In its review of the album, Kerrang! magazine called the song 'excruciatingly operatic'.|$|E

5|$|Godwin's wife, and {{the mother}} of his {{children}} including Harold and Edith, was Gytha Thorkelsdóttir. Her father was Thorgils Sprakaleg, a Dane whose origin is unknown, although he was probably a Dane from Scania, which was then in Denmark but is now part of Sweden. Gytha was very well connected as her brother Ulf married King Cnut's sister Estrith. Cnut probably <b>arranged</b> <b>the</b> marriage between Godwin and Gytha in about 1022.|$|E

Frederick intervened by force: he founded the Swabian League in 1488, an alliance of the Swabian cities, the Swabian knights of the League of St. George's Shield and the counts of Württemberg and Tyrol and Vorarlberg. With their help, he forced the Wittelsbach house to return the territories signed over by Sigismund.|$|E
