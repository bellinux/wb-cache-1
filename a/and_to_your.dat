500|$|Following {{a two-hour}} {{artillery}} barrage meant to soften up the Union defenses, the three divisions stepped off across open fields almost {{a mile from}} Cemetery Ridge. Pickett inspired his men by shouting, [...] "Up, Men, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> posts! Don't forget today that you are from Old Virginia." [...] Pickett's division, with the brigades of Brigadier Generals Armistead, Garnett, and Kemper, {{was on the right}} flank of the assault. It received punishing artillery fire, and then volleys of massed musket fire as it approached its objective. Armistead's brigade made the farthest progress through the Union lines. Armistead was mortally wounded, falling near [...] "The Angle", at what is now termed the [...] "High Water Mark of the Confederacy". Neither of the other two divisions made comparable progress across the fields; Armistead's success was not reinforced, and his men were quickly killed or captured.|$|E
500|$|The Hands {{also became}} close friends of Cornish {{resident}} Louis Dow, a Dartmouth College professor. Frances Hand spent {{increasing amounts of}} time with Dow while her husband was in New York, and tension crept into the marriage. Despite speculation, however, {{there is no evidence}} that she and Dow were lovers. Hand regretted Frances' long absences and urged her to spend more time with him, but he maintained an enduring friendship with Dow. He blamed himself for a lack of insight into his wife's needs in the early years of the marriage, confessing his [...] "blindness and insensibility to what you wanted <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> right to your own ways when they differed from mine". Fearing he might otherwise lose her altogether, Hand came to accept Frances' desire to spend time in the country with another man.|$|E

500|$|At Trenton, Washington faced a dilemma. All but {{a handful}} of his men's enlistments were expiring on December 31, and he knew that the army would {{collapse}} unless he convinced them to stay. So, on the 30th, Washington appealed to his men to stay one month longer for a bounty of ten dollars. He asked any men who wanted to volunteer to poise their firelocks, but not a man turned out. Washington then wheeled his horse around and rode in front of the troops, saying [...] "My brave fellows, you have done all I asked you to do, and more than could be reasonably expected; but your country is at stake, your wives, your houses and all that you hold dear. You have worn yourselves out with fatigues and hardships, but we know not how to spare you. If you will consent to stay only one month longer, you will render that service to the cause of liberty <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> country which you probably never can do under any other circumstances." [...] At first no one stepped forward, but then one soldier stepped forward, and he was followed by most of the others, leaving only a few in the original line.|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} God's promise to Jacob in [...] "The land whereon you lie, to you will I give it, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> seed," [...] caused Jacob to ask Joseph in [...] "Bury me not, I pray, in Egypt." [...] The Midrash taught that God's promise in [...] "The land whereon you lie, to you will I give it, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> seed," [...] implied that if Jacob {{lay in the}} land, it would be his, but if not, {{it would not be}} his.|$|E

2500|$|At roughly 2:30 PM, {{the attack}} commenced, led by General Pickett, who rode along his line shouting, [...] "Up, men, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> posts! Let no man forget {{that you are}} from Virginia!" [...] General Garnett formed his men for the attack and led {{them out of the}} treeline on Seminary Ridge. General Garnett was mounted; he had been {{recently}} kicked by a horse and was unable to walk without difficulty. Although he could easily have turned over command and sat out the charge, Garnett was desperate to clear his reputation after being court-martialed by Stonewall Jackson for an unauthorized withdrawal of his command at the Battle of Kernstown in 1862 (in reality, Garnett's withdrawal was entirely practical; his men were low on ammunition and his line about to be overwhelmed.) Still, Garnett believed the only way to clear his name was to lead the attack from the front and center.|$|E
2500|$|The Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer saw in Isaac's two {{blessings of}} Jacob in [...] and [...] an {{application}} of the teaching of [...] "Better {{is the end of}} a thing than the beginning." [...] The Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer noted that the first blessings with which Isaac blessed Jacob in [...] concerned dew and grain — material blessings. The final blessings in [...] concerned the foundation of the world, and were without interruption either in this world or in the world to come, for [...] says, [...] "And God Almighty bless you." [...] And Isaac further added the blessing of Abraham, as [...] says, [...] "And may He give you the blessing of Abraham, to you <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> seed with you." [...] Therefore, the Pirke De-Rabbi Eliezer concluded {{that the end of the}} thing — Isaac's final blessing of Jacob — was better than the beginning thereof.|$|E

[...] Former National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger also blamed the Soviet Union, saying, [...] "Whatever the details of the current invasion of Zaire, {{it is clear that the}} attack took place across a sovereign border from a country in which the government was installed by Soviet arms and the military personnel of a Soviet client state. It could not have taken place—and it could not continue—without the material support or acquiescence of the Soviet Union—whether or not Cuban troops are present." [...] China concurred, provoking unpleasantness with Soviet ambassadors in Beijing and later calling the FNLC invasion [...] "a new offensive drive in the Soviet Union's political and military aggression in Africa".|$|E
2500|$|Thirty-two years later, Williams {{returned}} to the Miss America stage on September 13, 2015, where she served as head judge for Miss America 2016 and sang [...] "Oh How the Years Go By." [...] After this performance, Miss America CEO Sam Haskell issued a public apology to Williams, stating:I have been {{a close friend of}} this beautiful and talented lady for 32 years. You have lived your life in grace and dignity, and never was it more evident than during the events of 1984, when you resigned. Though none of us currently in the organization were involved then, on behalf of today's organization, I want to apologize to you <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> mother, Miss Helen Williams. I want to apologize for anything that was said or done that made you feel any less the Miss America you are and the Miss America you always will be.Williams responded by stating that she did the [...] "best that I could, in my reign as Miss America, from 1983 to 1984." ...|$|E
2500|$|Reading [...] "Bury me not, I pray, in Egypt", a Midrash {{explained}} that Jacob wanted his bones {{to be carried}} away from Egypt, lest Jacob's descendants remain there, arguing that Egypt must be a holy land, or Jacob {{would not have been}} buried there. The Midrash taught that Jacob also wanted his family quickly to rejoin him in the Land of Israel, as Jacob trusted God to fulfill God's promise in [...] "He shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers." [...] Alternatively, a Midrash taught that Jacob feared that when God afflicted the Egyptians with the Plagues, they would surround Jacob's sepulcher and beseech him to intercede for them. If he did intercede, he would be helping God's enemies. If he did not, he would cause God's Name to be profaned by the Egyptians, who would call Jacob's God inefficacious. Alternatively, a Midrash taught that God promised Jacob in [...] "The land whereon you lie, to you will I give it, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> seed," [...] (and this implied) that if Jacob lay in the land, it would be his, but if not, it would not be his.|$|E

2500|$|Reading the words, [...] "And I {{appeared}} to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob," [...] in [...] a Midrash taught that God thus told Moses that God longed {{for those who}} were gone and could not be replaced – the three Patriarchs. The Midrash said that God told Moses that many times, God had revealed God's Self to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty ( [...] , El Shadai), and God had not made known to them that God's name is the Lord ( [...] , the Tetragrammaton). But still they did not criticize God's ways. To Abraham, God said in [...] "Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it, for to you will I give it," [...] yet when Abraham wanted to bury Sarah, he found no plot of ground until he had purchased one; still, he did not murmur at God's ways. God said to Isaac in [...] "Sojourn in this land [...] [...] [...] for to you, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> seed, I will give all these lands." [...] Yet when Isaac sought water to drink, he found none; instead (as [...] reports), [...] "The herdsmen of Gerar strove with Isaac's herdsmen, saying: ‘The water is ours.'" [...] Still Isaac did not murmur at God's ways. God said to Jacob in [...] "The land on which you lie, to you will I give it, <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> seed." [...] Yet when he sought a place to pitch his tent, he found none until he purchased one for a hundred kesitah (as reported in [...] ). And still Jacob did not complain at God's ways. The Patriarchs did not ask God, as Moses did in [...] what God's name was. In contrast, at the commencement of God's commission of Moses, Moses inquired of God's name. And in [...] Moses told God, [...] "For since I came to Pharaoh [...] [...] [...] he has dealt ill with this people; neither have You delivered Your people." [...] On this account, the Midrash taught, God said in [...] "And I have also established my covenant with them," [...] the Patriarchs, to give them the land, and they never complained of God's ways. And God said in [...] "I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel," [...] because they did not complain against God. Although the Israelites of that generation did not conduct themselves righteously, yet God heard their cry on account of the covenant that God had made with the Patriarchs. Hence, it says in [...] "And I have remembered My covenant. Therefore, say to the children of Israel." [...] The Midrash taught that the word [...] "therefore" [...] ( [...] , lachein) in [...] implies an oath, as it does in [...] where God says, [...] "And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli." [...] Thus, the Midrash taught that God swore to Moses that God would redeem the Israelites, so that Moses would have no reason to fear that the Attribute of Justice would retard their redemption.|$|E
2500|$|Thirty-two {{years after}} she resigned, Vanessa Williams {{returned}} to the Miss America stage on September 13, 2015, for the Miss America 2016 pageant as head judge (where Miss Georgia 2015, Betty Cantrell, won the crown). The pageant began with Miss America CEO Sam Haskell issuing an apology to Williams, telling her that although [...] "none of us currently in the organization were involved then, on behalf of today's organization, I want to apologize to you <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> mother, Miss Helen Williams. I want to apologize for anything that was said or done that made you feel any less the Miss America you are and the Miss America you always will be." [...] Suzette Charles (Williams' replacement) {{said in an interview}} with Inside Edition that she was perplexed over the apology and suggested that it was given for the purpose of ratings. Williams also commented on the events surrounding her return, stating in an interview with Robin Roberts that [...] "there's a lot of people who feel I should return, so the people who harbor the resentment I understand it but realize that all of those people that were part of the old guard are no longer there." [...] In the same interview, Roberts mentioned to Williams that in the present day (c. 2015), [...] "people now release [...] things to make a career." [...] Williams responded: [...] "That's crazy. To think that oh you can look at a scandal and think that that would be good for your career, where for me it took every ounce of credibility and talent that I had and wiped it out." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, {{shortly after}} the Boston Globe {{disclosed}} that Bulger and Flemmi had been informants, Weeks met with retired agent John Connolly (later sentenced to 40 years in prison), who showed him a photocopy of Bulger's FBI informant file. In order to explain Bulger and Flemmi's status as informants, Connolly said, [...] "The Mafia was going against Jimmy and Stevie, so Jimmy and Stevie went against them." [...] According to Weeks, [...] "As I read over the files at the Top of the Hub that night, Connolly kept telling me that 90 percent of {{the information in the}} files came from Stevie. Certainly Jimmy hadn't been around the Mafia the way Stevie had. But, Connolly told me, he had to put Jimmy's name on the files to keep his file active. As long as Jimmy was an active informant, Connolly said, he could justify meeting with Jimmy and giving him valuable information. Even after he retired, Connolly still had friends in the FBI, and he and Jimmy kept meeting to let each other know what was going on. I listened to all that, but now I understood that even though he was retired, Connolly was still getting information, as well as money, from Jimmy. As I continued to read, I could see {{that a lot of the}} reports were not just against the Italians. There were more and more names of Polish and Irish guys, of people we had done business with, of friends of mine. Whenever I came across the name of someone I knew, I would read exactly what it said about that person. I would see, over and over again, that some of these people had been arrested for crimes that were mentioned in these reports. It didn't take long for me to realize that it had been bullshit when Connolly told me that the files hadn't been disseminated, that they had been for his own personal use. He had been an employee of the FBI. He hadn't worked for himself. If there was some investigation going on and his supervisor said, 'Let me take a look at that,' what was Connolly going to do? He had to give it up. And he obviously had. I thought about what Jimmy had always said, 'You can lie to your wife <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> girlfriends, but not to your friends. Not to anyone we're in business with.' Maybe Jimmy and Stevie hadn't lied to me. But they sure hadn't been telling me everything." ...|$|E
