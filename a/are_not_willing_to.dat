25|$|The Indus Waters Treaty {{was signed}} by both {{countries}} in September 1960, giving exclusive rights over the three western rivers of the Indus river system (Jhelum, Chenab and Indus) to Pakistan, and over the three eastern rivers (Sutlej, Ravi and Beas) to India, {{as long as this}} does not reduce or delay the supply to Pakistan. India therefore maintains that they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> break the established regulations and they see no more problems with this issue.|$|E
25|$|Parental involvement, as {{discussed}} in the benefits section {{can also be a}} drawback, if parents and community members <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> express their opinions {{on the quality of the}} education system, the system may not see a need for improvement, and not change to meet student’s needs. Parents may also become too involved, requesting too many changes, so that important improvements get lost with other changes that are being suggested. Instructors will also find that their work is increased; they must work to first understand the outcome, then build a curriculum around each outcome they are required to meet. Instructors have found that implementing multiple outcomes is difficult to do equally, especially in primary school. Instructors will also find their work load increased if they chose to use an assessment method that evaluates students holistically.|$|E
25|$|Phinehas is said {{never to}} have {{accepted}} {{an invitation to a}} meal and, after he had attained his majority, to have refused to eat at the table of his father. The reason given by him for this course of conduct was that {{there are two kinds of}} people: (1) those who are willing to be hospitable, but can not afford to be so, and (2) those who have the means but <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> extend hospitality to others (Hul. 7b). Judah I once invited him to a meal, and exceptionally he decided to accept the invitation; but on arriving at the house of the patriarch he noticed in the yard mules of a certain kind the use of which was forbidden by local custom on account of the danger in handling them. Thereupon he retraced his steps and did not return (Hul. l.c.).|$|E

25|$|Ruter {{has stated}} that the {{estimated}} investment cost would be NOK10 billion, but that the tunnel would give high utility and {{would be one of}} the most economic investments they could make. There is no funding for a new tunnel in Oslo Package 3. By 2010, it was discovered that Oslo Package 3 was under-financed, and it is uncertain how much of the investment will be made by 2027. With the new tunnel being made a high priority by the city planners, this will either require additional grants from the municipality or the state, an increase in the toll fees, or the delay of investments in the program to a future Oslo Package 4. The left-wing parties have stated that they are willing to delay or abandon several road projects to allocate financing to a new tunnel, while the right-wing parties have stated that they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> allow road projects to be undermined.|$|E
25|$|Consumers {{typically}} have positive attitudes for {{products that are}} ethically made. These products may include promises of fair labor conditions, protection of the environment, and protection of human rights. All fair trade products must meet standards such as these. Despite positive attitudes toward ethical products including fair trade commodities, consumers often <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay the higher price associated with fair trade coffee. The attitude-behavior gap can help explain why ethical and fair trade products take up less than 1% of the market. Coffee consumers can say {{they would be willing}} to pay a higher premium for fair trade coffee, but most consumers are actually more concerned with the brand, label, and flavor of the coffee. However, socially conscious consumers with a commitment to buying fair trade products are more likely to pay the premium associated with fair trade coffee. Once enough consumers begin purchasing fair trade, companies are more likely to carry fair trade products. Safeway Inc. began carrying fair trade coffee after individual consumers dropped off postcards asking for it.|$|E
25|$|Marcel Proulx {{resigned}} as Dion's Quebec lieutenant {{hours before the}} Harper government's throne speech, taking the fall for the three by-election losses. Dion first approached Montreal MPs Denis Coderre and Pablo Rodriguez to succeed Proulx, but they declined. That evening he named Senator Céline Hervieux-Payette to the vacant post. While the Party was divided {{on whether or not}} the government should be toppled on a confidence vote regarding the Throne Speech, Dion mentioned in a statement in the House of Commons on 17 October that the Liberals will support the Throne Speech but with major amendments including the Kyoto Protocol and the end of mission in Afghanistan by 2009 and had criticized the government on several aspects including the economy, seniors and child poverty, the crime policy, the Senate reform. The latter amendment proposal was rejected by the New Democratic Party who are favouring an immediate end to the mission. Dion explained the decision as that Canadians <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> have a third election in just over three years. All Liberal members abstained from voting on the Throne Speech on 24 October 2007, which passed 126–79.|$|E

500|$|Jaher {{noted that}} Hay's {{view of what}} a worker should be is summed up in the {{character}} of Saul Matchin. [...] Although a successful craftsman, he remains within the working class, not seeking to rise above his station, and is content with his lot. [...] His children <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> remain within that class, however: the sons run away and the daughters seek to marry well, symbolizing the change being wrought by industrialization. Robert Dunne points out that the working classes are not depicted favorably in Hay's novel, but as [...] "stupid and ill-bred, at the best loyal servants to the gentry and at the worst overly ambitious and a threat to the welfare of Buffland". Sloane considers unfavorable depictions of the working classes inevitable given the plot, and less noticeable than skewed portrayals of the wealthy in other books of the time.|$|E
500|$|A major {{sticking}} point over NHL participation {{has been the}} insurance of players; for the 2014 Winter Olympics, the IOC paid around US$7 million to insure NHL players participating in the Games. In April 2016, the IOC announced that beginning in 2018, {{it would no longer}} cover accommodations, insurance, or travel for NHL players in the Olympics, prompting the IIHF to ask for support from national ice hockey associations and National Olympic Committees to help cover costs; Matti Nurminen of the Finnish Ice Hockey Association argued that it was the responsibility of the event's organizer to cover costs, and that [...] "In our opinion, the same party should pay the bills, and that’s not us. All the countries replied to the IIHF that they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> pay for the insurance or the travel {{or any of the other}} expenses that are related to having the NHL players participate in Pyeongchang." [...] The New York Times felt that the removal of this financial support would put NHL participation at Pyeongchang in jeopardy, noting the already-strenuous relationship between the NHL and the IOC; Gary Bettman noted that the NHL does not profit from their presence, adding that [...] "in fact, we kind of disappear for two weeks because historically the IOC hasn't even let us join in promoting our participation in the Olympics." ...|$|E
