The study was undertaken in response to practitioner inquiry into the value and worth of school television for student literacy learning. Over the research period this project evolved into a deeply reflective self-study of teaching practice within a technological environment. This research took place in a suburban primary school where school television had been created by students for the previous two years. Twenty-two students aged between 10 and 12 participated in three cycles of action research to investigate how pedagogy influences learning within this context. A range of pedagogical actions designed to influence students’ critical thinking were implemented into action research cycles. The selection of actions for intervention was influenced by <b>an</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>into</b> <b>current</b> literature from the field, and an analysis of existing multi-literacy learning, pedagogical conditions and student views of teaching and learning within student television {{at the beginning of the}} research cycles. This study gathered information during research cycles using student learning conversations and student interviews, which provided insight into learning from the point of view of students. Supporting this information were daily researcher observations and end-of-cycle interviews with classroom teachers. Through careful monitoring, analysis and reflection on each research cycle it was clear that strategic pedagogical interventions did positively influence multi-literacy learning. Rather than attempt to measure differences in student learning, this study explored how multi-literacy learning, strategic pedagogy and learning within student television inter-related with one another.

The research {{focuses on}} CASE tool support for the concept of methodology, the representation of methodology syntax and semantics, and the support for re-use of methodology descriptions and software artefacts. A novel methodology representation strategy for meta-CASE tools is proposed and implemented {{with the development of}} a new meta-CASE tool (MOOT - Meta Object Orientated Tool). The novel strategy propounded in this thesis uses an object-orientated meta-model and views methodology descriptions as potentially re-usable components. The coupling between methodology syntax and semantic descriptions is minimised so they can be reused independently. Two new modelling languages have been derived, to support the definition of syntax (NDL - Notation Definition Language) and semantics (SSL - Semantic Specification Language) of software engineering methodologies. Semantic descriptions are compiled to a platform independent representation (SSL-BC), which is executed on a purpose built virtual machine (SSL-VM). Late binding of syntax and semantic methodology descriptions is implemented with the development of Notation Semantic Mapping (NSM) tables. Two libraries of re-usable methodology description components, the Core Knowledge Base (CKB) and the Generic Object Orientated Knowledge Base (GOOKB), have been derived during this research. Empirical results gained from applying the MOOT prototype demonstrated the flexibility, extensibility and potential of the novel methodology representation strategy. This approach permitted the implementation and modelling of UML and patterns, two recent advances of object technology that did not exist when the research commenced. The novel strategy presented in this thesis is more than an untried theory. It has been implemented, applied and is being evaluated. Simply, it is real and it works...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} investigates how {{the contemporary}} performers of the Swazi gourd-resonated bow, the makhweyane, create music. Since David Rycroft's study of Swazi bow {{music in the}} 1960 s and 1970 s, little study {{has been devoted to}} this musical instrument. The makhweyane is played by a handful of people, each appearing to consider him or herself the last bearer of this tradition. Despite this, however, musical bows have been co-opted as icons of Swazi national identity, and, along with the Incwala (the "first fruits" festival) and Umhlanga ("reed dance") ceremonies, are used as public affirmation of Swazi cultural homogeneity to rally support for the monarchy. The research investigates how musicians create new music for this single-stringed instrument. It also explores, through oral testimony, musical analysis, and practice-based methodologies, the discourse surrounding composition and musical innovation on this rare instrument. Players learn and create through both solitary and participatory exploration and music-making. This research explores how current makhweyane music can be read as oral testimony with regards to the lives of musicians, but also how diverse current praxis serves many functions: as "radio" for lone travelers, as comfort for broken hearts, and as individual acts of citizenry within a broader national environment. This dissertation explores the musical, technical, and social parameters engaged when creating new repertory - the myriad invisible spectres to whom players play and for whom players compose - and the shape that new, resilient makhweyane sounds are taking. It extends David Rycroft's musicological analysis of the 1960 s and 1970 s to include <b>an</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>into</b> <b>current</b> dialectics between individual notions of creative innovation and musical memory, and the national cultural imaginary.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} researchis to use {{advanced}} materials and {{state of the art}} Finite Element Analysis to produce a novel acetabular cup prosthesis. <b>An</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>into</b> <b>current</b> static and fatigue testing procedures for acetabular cup prostheses has identified current strengths and weakness and proposes a cheap, fast method that is closer to anatomical loading conditions. The current trend of performing Total Hip Replacements(THR) on younger patients incurs an increasing number of revisions. Therefore, prolonging the life of a THR is of paramount importance and is the principal goal of this study. With this trend comes a new set of design goals driven by higher patient expectations of their THR. Younger patients not only require increased longevity from their prosthesis but also increased performances so as to be able to undertake more strenuous everyday activities, such as sports. Historically, the main objective of THR was to relieve pain and increase quality of life in the elderly and was not intended for young active patients. Previous research proposes that the acetabularcup design has far more impact on long-term survival of the THR than the femoral component. Optimising the acetabular cup prosthesis produces a highly complex problem where many of the individual design factors have massive impact on the system. A main aim is to develop a material or combination of materials to optimise the stress distribution in the system without sacrificing the service life of the THR. Of the 800, 000 hip replacements carried out annually, many of the current acetabular cups have some form of polyethylene bearing surface. However, polyethy lenewear debris is seen as a major contributing factor to bone resorption and hence prosthesis loosening. Changes in stress values, even caused by initial primary fixation during the operation, can result in stresses being transferred in an unrealistic manner. The effect is that the bone grows to differing thickness and strengths. This is known as remodelling. For optimisation of the acetabular cup, the properties of the natural hip must be retained by minimising both remodelling and bone resorption. The present research, with collaboration from Orthodynamics Ltd., has produced novel composite acetabular cup prostheses with a ceramic on ceramic bearing surface that should last longer and perform better, thus reducing the necessity for costly and debilitating revisions later on in life. In addition, the use of the proposed novel anatomically orientated mechanical testing methods gave fast,cheap results and could also allow further research into fatigue failure of alumina bearing couples in THR. ...|$|E
40|$|Many {{teachers}} {{working in}} remote and regional areas have {{limited access to}} collegial support networks. This research aimed to examine the existing strategies that were being undertaken by the Department of Education in Western Australia, to provide professional learning to teachers in regional and remote areas. It was important to establish the perceptions of teachers’ access to professional learning from those working at the coalface in geographically dispersed areas. Consequently, the possible opportunity for improving the amount and variety of professional learning, {{through the application of}} both synchronous and asynchronous technologies was proposed. The study was guided by the primary research question: “In what ways might technology be used to support professional development of regional and remote teachers in Western Australia?” Generating descriptions of current practice of professional learning along with the teacher perceptions were central to this research endeavour. 	The study relied on a mixed method research approach in order to attend to the research question. The data were collected in phases, referred to as an explanatory mixed methods design. Quantitative data were collected from 104 participants to provide a general picture of the research problem. To further refine this general picture, qualitative data were collected through interviews and e-interviews of 10 teachers. Participants in the study included graduate teachers, teachers who had taught more than two years, senior teachers and Level Three teachers from seven teaching districts within Western Australia. <b>An</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>into</b> <b>current</b> practice was included in this phase and technologies available to support a professional learning community over distance were documented. The final phase incorporated the formulation of a conceptual framework where a model was developed to facilitate the successful implementation of a professional learning community through the application of synchronous and asynchronous technologies. 	The study has identified that travel time in order to access professional development is significant and impacts on teachers’ personal time. There are limited relief teachers available in these isolated areas which impacts on the opportunities to access professional development. Teachers face inequities, in terms of promotion, because professional development is explicitly linked to promotional opportunities. Importantly, it was found that professional learning communities are valued, but are often limited by small staff numbers at the geographic locality of the school. Teachers preferred to undertake professional learning in the local context of their district, school or classroom and this professional learning must be established at the need of the individual teacher in line with the school priorities. Teachers reported they were confident in using technology and accessing professional development online if required, however, much uncertainty surrounded the use of web 2. 0 technologies for this purpose. The recommendations made from the study are intended to identify how a professional learning community might be enhanced through synchronous and asynchronous technologies...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This work {{is concerned with the}} fluid dynamic processes and the associated loss of acoustic energy produced by circular apertures within noise absorbing perforated walls. Although applicable {{to a wide range of}} engineering applications particular emphasis in this work is placed on the use of such features within a gas turbine combustion system. The primary aim for noise absorbers in gas turbine combustion systems is the elimination of thermo-acoustic instabilities, which are characterised by rapidly rising pressure amplitudes which are potentially damaging to the combustion system components. By increasing the amount of acoustic energy being absorbed the occurrence of thermo-acoustic instabilities can be avoided. The fundamental acoustic characteristics relating to linear acoustic absorption are presented. It is shown that changes in orifice geometry, in terms of gas turbine combustion system representative length-to-diameter ratios, result in changes in the measured Rayleigh Conductivity. Furthermore in the linear regime the maximum possible acoustic energy absorption for a given cooling mass flow budget of a conventional combustor wall will be identified. <b>An</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>into</b> <b>current</b> Rayleigh Conductivity and aperture impedance (1 D) modelling techniques are assessed and the ranges of validity for these modelling techniques will be identified. Moreover possible improvements to the modelling techniques are discussed. Within a gas turbine system absorption can also occur in the non-linear operating regime. Hence the influence of the orifice geometry upon the optimum non-linear acoustic absorption is also investigated. Furthermore the performance of non-linear acoustic absorption modelling techniques is evaluated against the conducted measurements. As the amplitudes within the combustion system increase the acoustic absorption will transition from the linear to the non-linear regime. This is important for the design of absorbers or cooling geometries for gas turbine combustion systems as the propensity for hot gas ingestion increases. Hence the relevant parameters and phenomena are investigated during the transition process from linear to non-linear acoustic absorption. The unsteady velocity field during linear and non-linear acoustic absorption is captured using particle image velocimetry. A novel analysis technique is developed which enables the identification of the unsteady flow field associated with the acoustic absorption. In this way an investigation into the relevant mechanisms within the unsteady flow fields to describe the acoustic absorption behaviour of the investigated orifice plates is conducted. This methodology will also help in the development and optimisation of future damping systems and provide validation for more sophisticated 3 D numerical modelling methods. Finally a set of design tools developed during this work will be discussed which enable a comprehensive preliminary design of non-resonant and resonant acoustic absorbers with multiple perforated liners within a gas turbine combustion system. The tool set is applied to assess the impact of the gas turbine combustion system space envelope, complex swirling flow fields and the propensity to hot gas ingestion in the preliminary design stages...|$|E

This report summarizes <b>a</b> brief <b>investigation</b> <b>into</b> the <b>current</b> status of the relevant technology at SwRI and GRC with a view towards a future integration of methods and models developed by GRC for probabilistic lifing of powder metallurgy (P/M) nickel turbine rotor alloys into the DARWIN (Darwin Corporation) software developed by SwRI...|$|R
40|$|Abstract – This paper {{presents}} the results of <b>an</b> <b>investigation</b> <b>into</b> the <b>current</b> distribution along the lightning channel for the case of a stroke current measured at the base of an instrumented tower located at the University of São Paulo. Simulations are performed for different stroke current propagation velocities and three well known return stroke models, and important discrepancies are observed among the current peak values at different heights for the situations considered. For the particular case treated in the paper, the differences between the current measured {{at the base of the}} tower and that calculated at the tower top are negligible. On the other hand, simulations considering a hypothetical subsequent stroke current and a higher tower show significant differences between the currents at the top and base of the tower and also between them and the current that would flow through the lightning channel in the case of a strike to flat ground...|$|R
