60|$|Here {{then are}} three {{complete}} and undeniable sources of right established, {{any one of}} which was more than ample to establish a property in the newly-discovered regions of America. Now, so it has happened in certain parts of this delightful quarter of the globe that the right of discovery has been so strenuously asserted--the influence of cultivation so industriously extended, and the progress of salvation and civilization so zealously persecuted; that, what with their attendant wars, persecutions, oppressions, diseases, and other partial evils that often hang on the skirts of great benefits--the savage aborigines have, somehow or other, been utterly annihilated--and this all at once brings me to a fourth right, which is worth all the others put together. For the original claimants to the soil being all dead and buried, and no one remaining to inherit or dispute the soil, the Spaniards, as the next immediate occupants, entered upon the possession as clearly as the hangman succeeds to the clothes of the malefactor--and as they have Blackstone[21] and all the learned expounders of the law on their side, they may set all <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> <b>ejectment</b> at defiance--and this last right may be entitled the right by extermination, or in other words, the right by gunpowder.|$|R

500|$|The Court {{had not yet}} {{encountered}} a party claiming to actually possess aboriginal title in {{a case in which}} it had jurisdiction, so it had not yet definitively resolved {{the question of whether the}} holders of aboriginal title could avail themselves of the common law causes of action of trespass or ejectment. [...] At the end of his opinion in Fletcher v. Peck (1810), Marshall had stated that ejectment could not be obtained against the holder of aboriginal title. The Taney Court (18361864), in Marsh v. Brooks (1850), went further in declaring that the holder of aboriginal title could obtain ejectment, stating: [...] "That an <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>ejectment</b> could be maintained on an Indian right to occupancy and use, is not open to question." [...] In the oral arguments of that case, Cherokee Nation had been cited as authority for the argument that [...] "Indians cannot sue on their aboriginal title in court of the United States."

60|$|Peter Stuyvesant {{read over}} this {{friendly}} epistle with some such harmony of aspect as we may suppose a crusty farmer reads the loving letter of John Stiles, warning him of an <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>ejectment.</b> He was not, however, {{to be taken}} by surprise; but, thrusting the summons into his breeches pocket, stalked three times across the room, took a pinch of snuff with great vehemence, and then, loftily waving his hand, promised to send an answer the next morning. He now summoned a general meeting of his privy councillors and burgomasters, not to ask their advice, for confident in his own strong head, he needed no man's counsel, but apparently {{to give them a}} piece of his mind on their late craven conduct.|$|E
50|$|Barber {{was educated}} at St John's College, Cambridge, where he {{graduated}} ninth wrangler in 1833. In {{the same year}} he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn. He was a pupil of Mr. Duval, an eminent conveyancer. He acquired a high reputation as an equity draftsman and conveyancer, and, though he never took silk, had {{for nearly half a}} century an extensive practice at the junior bar. He was one of the commissioners appointed to reform the procedure of the Court of Chancery in 1853, his large experience of chancery business rendering his suggestions of the highest value in the work of framing the rules of practice issued under the Chancery Amendment Acts. In the chancery proceedings by which, in 1867, the celebrated Orton or Castro first sought to establish his claim to the Tichborne baronetcy and estates, Barber held a brief for the defendants, as he did again in the first <b>of</b> the two <b>actions</b> <b>of</b> <b>ejectment</b> which were subsequently brought in the court of common pleas for the same purpose, in the well-known case of Tichborne v. Lushington, decided in 1872 after a trial which lasted 103 days. He also acted as one of the counsel for the crown in the prosecution for perjury which followed, and which occupied in the hearing from first to last 188 days. In 1874 he was appointed judge of county courts for circuit No. 6 (Hull and the East Riding), but resigned the post almost immediately, and resumed practice at the bar. He died at his residence (71 Cornwall Gardens) on 5 Feb. 1882.|$|R
2500|$|The {{power of}} Congress to {{extinguish}} aboriginal title—by [...] "purchase or conquest," [...] {{or with a}} clear statement—is plenary and exclusive. Such extinguishment is not compensable under the Fifth Amendment, although various statutes provide for compensation. Unextinguished aboriginal title provides a federal common law cause <b>of</b> <b>action</b> for <b>ejectment</b> or trespass, {{for which there is}} federal subject-matter jurisdiction. Many potentially meritorious tribal lawsuits have been settled by Congressional legislation providing for the extinguishment of aboriginal title as well as monetary compensation or the approval of gaming enterprises.|$|R

State (1985), known as Oneida II, which held that there is a federal common law cause <b>of</b> <b>action</b> for <b>ejectment</b> based upon aboriginal title for which there is federal subject-matter jurisdiction. Therefore, Indian tribes no longer have to rely on state statutes for a cause <b>of</b> <b>action.</b> In the words of Prof. Hauptman, Oneida I [...] "overturned one hundred forty-three years of American law." ...|$|R
6000|$|That Reef {{itself had}} {{undergone}} more changes {{than any other}} spot in the colony, as the Peak had undergone fewer. The town by this time contained {{more than two hundred}} buildings, of one sort and another, and the population exceeded five hundred souls. This was a small population for so many tenements; but the children, as yet, did not bear a just proportion to the adults. The crater was the subject of what to Mark Woolston was a most painful law-suit. From the first, he had claimed that spot as his private property; though he had conceded its use to the public, under a lease, since it was so well adapted, by natural formation, to be a place of refuge when invasions were apprehended. But the crater he had found barren, and had rendered fertile; the crater had even seemed to him to be an especial gift of Providence bestowed on him in his misery; and the crater was his by possession, as well as by other rights, when he received strangers into his association. None of the older inhabitants denied this claim. It is the last comers who are ever the most anxious to dispute ancient rights. As they can possess none of these established privileges themselves, they dislike that others should enjoy them; and association places no restraints on their cupidity. Pennock, once in the hands of [...] "the people," [...] was obliged to maintain their rights, or what some among them chose to call their rights; and he authorized the attorney-general to bring an <b>action</b> <b>of</b> <b>ejectment</b> against the party in possession. Some pretty hard-faced trickery was attempted in the way of legislation, in order to help along the claim of the public; for, if the truth must be said, the public is just as wont to resort to such unworthy means to effect its purposes as private individuals, when it is deemed necessary. But there was little fear of the [...] "people's" [...] failing; they made the law, and they administered it, through their agents; the power being now so completely in their hands that it required twice the usual stock of human virtue {{to be able to say}} them nay, as had formerly been the case. God help the man whose rights are to be maintained against the masses, when the immediate and dependent nominees of those masses are to sit in judgment! If the public, by any inadvertency, have had the weakness to select servants that are superior to human infirmities, and who prefer to do right rather than to do as their masters would have them, it is a weakness that experience will be sure to correct, and which will not be often repeated.|$|E

2500|$|Oneida County v. Oneida Indian Nation of N.Y. State (1985) [...] {{held that}} it would violate federal policy to apply the state statute of {{limitations}} to the federal cause <b>of</b> <b>action</b> for <b>ejectment</b> based on aboriginal title; thus, there is no statute of limitations. Similarly, the widely held view is that aboriginal title cannot be adversely possessed. However, if a tribe is subject to an Indian Termination Act, the state statute of limitations (and any generally applicable state law) will apply to its land claim, as the Supreme Court held in South Carolina v. Catawba Indian Tribe (1986).|$|R
50|$|The case {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{influential}} and well-known decisions of the Marshall Court, a fixture of the first-year curriculum in nearly all US law schools. Marshall's prosaic and eminently quotable opinion lays down the foundations of the doctrine of aboriginal title in the United States, and the related discovery doctrine. However, the vast majority of the opinion is dicta; as valid title is a basic element of the cause <b>of</b> <b>action</b> for <b>ejectment,</b> the holding does not extend to the validity of M'Intosh's title, much less the property rights of the Piankeshaw. Thus, all that the opinion holds with respect to aboriginal title is that it is inalienable, a principle that remains well-established law in nearly all common law jurisdictions.|$|R

Jones is the plaintiff.|$|E

500|$|Because {{the treaty}} had been {{negotiated}} [...] "with {{them as a}} quasi nation, possessing some of the attributes of an independent people, and {{to be dealt with}} accordingly," [...] the Court held that [...] "unless otherwise expressly stipulated" [...] only the federal government had the [...] "authority or power" [...] to execute the agreement.

[...] The nature of that relationship between the Seneca and the federal government was incompatible with the Seneca being expelled by [...] "irregular force and violence," [...] or even [...] "through the intervention of the courts of justice."
