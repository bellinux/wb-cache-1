Since then, their structure has remained largely unchanged. Each state or union territory is further divided into administrative districts. The districts in turn are further divided into tehsils and ultimately into villages.|$|E

5|$|Max Tegmark {{developed}} a four-part classification scheme {{for the different}} types of multiverses that scientists have suggested in various problem domains.

Effectively, the multiverse evolves as a universal wavefunction.
