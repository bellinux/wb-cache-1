5|$|A central {{topic of}} Leontovych's work is choral music about {{everyday}} life. His music frequently reflect actual actions and events. An {{example of this}} is his shchedrivka “Ой там за горою” (Oh there behind the mountain) in which a tenor initially starts the song with a solo {{and the rest of the}} voices of the choir gradually come in, reflecting carolling when new groups of singers join in. Then, a switching of parts begins between different groups of the choir, recreating the clamorous <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New Year's Eve.|$|E

40|$|A review <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{applications}} <b>of</b> chemical thermodynamics {{and chemical}} kinetics to planetary atmospheres research {{during the past}} four decades is presented with an emphasis on chemical equilibrium models and thermochemical kinetics. Several current problems in planetary atmospheres research such as <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmospheres</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> terrestrial planets, atmosphere-surface interactions on Venus and Mars, deep mixing in <b>the</b> <b>atmospheres</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> gas giant planets, and <b>the</b> origin <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>atmospheres</b> <b>of</b> outer planet satellites all require laboratory data on <b>the</b> kinetics <b>of</b> thermochemical reactions for their solution...|$|R

50|$|In 1963, Berkner, with L.C. Marshall, {{advanced}} {{a theory}} {{to describe the}} way in which <b>the</b> <b>atmospheres</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solar system's inner planets had evolved.|$|R
5|$|Balzac {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the novel during a trip to Brittany arranged by a family friend in 1828. Intrigued by the people and <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> region, he began collecting notes and descriptions for later use. After publishing an Avertissement for the novel, he released three editions – each of them revised significantly. The first novel Balzac published without a pseudonym, he used many titles as he wrote and published, including Le Gars, Les Chouans ou la Bretagne il y a trente ans, and Le Dernier Chouan ou la Bretagne en 1800.|$|E
5|$|Barman drew on {{data and}} {{measurements}} taken by Heather Knutson, {{a student at}} Harvard University, from the Hubble Space Telescope, and applied new theoretical models to demonstrate the likelihood of water absorption in the <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet. The planet orbits its parent star every {{three and a half}} days, and each time it passes in front of its parent star, the atmospheric contents can be analyzed by examining how the atmosphere absorbs light passing from the star directly through the atmosphere in the direction of Earth.|$|E
5|$|Given the planet's high mass, it {{is likely}} that 47 Ursae Majoris b is a gas giant with no solid surface. Because the planet has only been {{detected}} indirectly, properties such as its radius, composition, and temperature are unknown. Due to its mass {{it is likely}} to have a surface gravity 68 times that of Earth. Assuming a composition similar to that of Jupiter and an environment close to chemical equilibrium, the upper <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet is expected to contain water clouds, as opposed to the ammonia clouds typical of Jupiter.|$|E

40|$|The {{solar wind}} is {{expected}} to have an important influence on <b>the</b> <b>atmospheres</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moon, Mercury and Venus and therefore a brief outline of solar wind theory is presented along with <b>the</b> predicted properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wind at <b>the</b> orbits <b>of</b> these planets. Since <b>the</b> <b>atmospheres</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moon and possibly Mercury are formed primarily by solar wind accretion, we present the latest accretion models for these bodies. The expected role the solar wind plays on both the ionization and termination <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ionosphere <b>of</b> Venus is discussed...|$|R
5|$|In 1650, German {{scientist}} Otto von Guericke {{constructed the}} first vacuum pump: {{a device that}} would further refute the principle of horror vacui. He correctly noted that the <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth surrounds the planet like a shell, with the density gradually declining with altitude. He concluded {{that there must be}} a vacuum between the Earth and the Moon.|$|E
5|$|In November 1980, the Voyager 1 probe {{visited the}} Saturn system. It sent back the first {{high-resolution}} {{images of the}} planet, its rings and satellites. Surface features of various moons were seen for the first time. Voyager 1 performed a close flyby of Titan, increasing knowledge of the <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> moon. It proved that Titan's atmosphere is impenetrable in visible wavelengths; therefore no surface details were seen. The flyby changed the spacecraft's trajectory out from {{the plane of the}} Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Priestley {{eventually}} {{decided to}} return to his theological studies and, in 1752, matriculated at Daventry, a Dissenting academy.

He continued his intense study; this, together with the liberal <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> school, shifted his theology further leftward and he became a Rational Dissenter. Abhorring dogma and religious mysticism, Rational Dissenters emphasised the rational analysis of the natural world and the Bible.|$|E

5|$|The {{film is a}} {{condensed}} {{adaptation of}} Dickens' work, reviewers specifically highlighted the attention to detail and {{the limitations of the}} format when condensing the work to a single reel format. The <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film and the portrayal was deemed to be natural except for the scenes in open. The director of the film was Barry O'Neil, but the scenario writer and cameraman are uncredited. The surviving status of the film yields to the possibility of further information being gained on the production and details of the work.|$|E
5|$|The heliosphere, the tenuous {{outermost}} <b>atmosphere</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Sun, {{is filled}} with the solar wind plasma.
