The oils that foods absorb in their batter typically contain {{large amounts of}} fats, especially saturated fats and trans fats.

5|$|The {{substance}} Rhoca-Gil {{was used}} to fix the leakages, but the substance failed to work properly. Not only did it fail to polymerize and stop the leaks, it also contaminated the surroundings with <b>acrylamide.</b> The entire process of fixing the leak and cleaning up the toxicity delayed {{the process of building}} the tunnel by one year; and it was first opened on 22 August 1999. Further complications arose due to conflicts between NSB Gardermobanen and the construction company. Retrospective surveys showed a lack of control and reporting procedures during incidents that should have been addressed in 1995, and were never taken seriously. About sixty houses received damage due to the construction of the tunnel. An evaluation performed by the Ministry of Transport and Communications showed that NOK500 million was used on fixing the leaks; however, the report claimed this was, to a large extent, a waste of money due to inefficient engineering procedures. The same report criticized the planning and organization of the entire construction of the railway.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acrylamide</b> is {{considered}} a potential occupational carcinogen by U.S. government agencies and classified as a Group 2A carcinogen by the IARC. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health have set dermal occupational exposure limits at 0.03mg/m3 over an eight-hour workday. In animal models, exposure to <b>acrylamide</b> causes tumors in the adrenal glands, thyroid, lungs, and testes. <b>Acrylamide</b> is easily absorbed by the skin and distributed throughout the organism; {{the highest levels of}} <b>acrylamide</b> post-exposure are found in the blood, non-exposed skin, kidneys, liver, testes, and spleen. <b>Acrylamide</b> can metabolically-activated by cytochrome P450 to a genotoxic metabolite, glycidamide, which {{is considered}} to be a critical mode of action to the carcinogenesis of <b>acrylamide.</b> On the other hand, <b>acrylamide</b> and glycidamide can be detoxified via conjugation with glutathione to form acrylamide- and isomeric glycidamide-glutathione conjugates, subsequently metabolized to mercapturic acids and excreted in urine. <b>Acrylamide</b> has also been found to have neurotoxic effects in humans who have been exposed. Animal studies show neurotoxic effects as well as mutations in sperm.|$|E

25|$|<b>Acrylamide</b> (C3H5NO; mW: 71.08) when {{dissolved}} in water, slow, spontaneous autopolymerization of <b>acrylamide</b> takes place, joining molecules together by head on tail fashion to form long single-chain polymers. The {{presence of a}} free radical-generating system greatly accelerates polymerization. This kind of reaction is known as vinyl addition polymerisation. A solution of these polymer chains becomes viscous but does not form a gel, because the chains simply slide over one another. Gel formation requires linking various chains together. <b>Acrylamide</b> is carcinogenic, a neurotoxin, and a reproductive toxin. It is also essential to store <b>acrylamide</b> in a cool dark and dry place to reduce autopolymerisation and hydrolysis.|$|E
25|$|<b>Acrylamide</b> {{has been}} found in roasted barley tea, called mugicha in Japanese. The barley is roasted so it is dark brown prior to being steeped in hot water.

40|$|Abstract: Stereo {{differentiated}} asymmetric syntheses {{have been}} achieved by S-indoline deri-vations. Diels–Alder cycloadditions of S-indoline chiral <b>acrylamides</b> with cyclopentadiene proceed with high diastereofacial selectivity, giving either endo-R or endo-S products depending on Lewis acid and the structures of chiral dienophiles. Diastereo- and enantio-selective pinacol coupling reactions of chiral α-ketoamides mediated by samarium diiodide afforded extremely high diastereoselectivities. Enantiopure (S,S) - or (R,R) - 2, 3 -dialkyltar-taric acid and derivatives can be synthesized {{for the first time}} depending on the structure of α-ketoamides. Lewis acid-catalyzed addition of dienes to chiral <b>acrylamides</b> is a useful reaction because it provides {{one of the most effective}} methods for creating new chiral centers during the formation of six-membered rings [1]. Lewis acids have been used for chelate formation in Diels–Alder cyclizations to obtain high diastereofacial selectivities [1 – 5]. In general, the S-form of the chiral dienophile (auxiliary) exclusive-ly affords the endo-R adduct over the endo-S one, and the R form exclusively gives the S adduct over the endo-R one. Issues associated with this absolute stereochemical control depending upon Lewis acids and the structures of dienophiles provide an important challenge in the area of practical Diels–Alde...|$|R
40|$|The {{addition}} {{of a variety of}} radicals to the double bond of N-(arylsulfonyl) <b>acrylamides</b> can trigger cyclization/aryl migration/desulfonylation cascades via amidyl radical intermediates 2. Herein, we demonstrate the synthetic utility of these intermediates in subsequent C?C and C?X bond-forming events to rapidly build up molecular complexity. First, we describe a regioselective one-pot synthesis of CF 3 -, SCF 3 -, Ph 2 (O) P-, and N 3 -containing indolo[2, 1 -a]isoquinolin- 6 (5 H) -ones from N-[(2 -ethynyl) arylsulfonyl]acrylamides through a multi-step radical reaction cascade. The process involves the one-pot formation of four new bonds (one C?X, two C?C, and one C?N), a formal 1, 4 -aryl migration, and desulfonylation of the starting material. Second, we present a one-pot synthesis of 3, 3 -disubstituted- 2 -dihydropyridinones from N-(arylsulfonyl) <b>acrylamides</b> and 1, 3 -dicarbonyl compounds. In this case, a silver-catalyzed radical cascade process involving the sequential formation of two new C?C bonds and one C?N bond, a formal 1, 4 -aryl migration, and desulfonylation of the starting material explains the regioselective formation of densely functionalized heterocycles in a straightforward manner. Control experiments have unraveled the key intermediates as well as the sequence of individual steps involved in these transformations...|$|R
