5|$|For Commander-in-Chief of the Luftwaffe Hermann Göring it was {{an ongoing}} concern that {{inadequate}} numbers of fighters were able to continually engage the bomber streams, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>time</b> that the USAAF's 8th Air Force's new commander, Maj. Gen. Jimmy Doolittle had instituted a new fighter strategy against the Luftwaffe. Hence on 23 February 1944 — near {{the midpoint of the}} USAAF's Big Week bomber offensive against the Luftwaffe, also being carried out by the 15th Air Force flying out of Italian bases — Generalmajor Joseph Schmid Commander of I. Jagdkorps established a new rule for the fighters returning to base. They were to arrive at the nearest designated fighter airfield for resupply instead of returning to their own base. They were to be commanded by the senior pilot landing on that airfield, irrespective of their unit. This was meant to turn around the fighters in time to intercept returning bombers.|$|E

25|$|The {{cultural}} exchange between India and Japan was not direct, as Japan received Buddhism through Korea, China, Central Asia and eventually India. The Japanese discovered Buddhism in the 6th century when missionary monks travelled {{to the islands}} together with numerous scriptures and works of art. The cultural contact between Indian Dharmic civilization and Japan through the adoption of Buddhist ideas and aesthetic {{has contributed to the}} development of a national cultural order in the subsequent century.

25|$|Half {{a century}} of continual war and more than {{a century of}} depredations by privateers and pirates weighed heavily on the {{administration}} and defence of the Portuguese empire, spread as it was across Asia, Africa and America, and exhausted the Portuguese treasury. In 1640, Count-Duke de Olivares, royal favourite of Philip IV and prime minister of Spain, imprudently chose to levy a special tax upon Portugal in violation of its constitution, <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>time</b> when the Catalans, a merchant people like those of Lisbon, and also oppressed by Castilian taxes, {{were on the verge of}} armed rebellion. Then the prime minister of Portugal, Miguel de Vasconcelos, on the advice of the Spanish nobility, and with the complicity of the Portuguese feudal nobles, announced the Spanish minister's intention of abolishing the Portuguese Cortes, and of making the country a mere province of Castile with its own representatives in the Castilian Cortes. This provocation was the last straw for those Portuguese who desired the restoration of Portugal's independence.|$|E

According to Kerr, Charles had responded: [...] "But surely, Sir John, the Queen should not have to accept advice that you should be recalled <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>time</b> when you were considering having to dismiss the government".

As a sailor, he denounced his faith after being influenced by a shipmate who discussed Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times, a book by the Third Earl of Shaftesbury, with him. In a series of letters he later wrote, [...] "Like an unwary sailor who quits his port just before a rising storm, I renounced the hopes and comforts of the Gospel <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>time</b> when every other comfort was about to fail me." [...] His disobedience caused him to be pressed into the Royal Navy, and he took advantage of opportunities to overstay his leave and finally deserted to visit Mary [...] "Polly" [...] Catlett, a family friend {{with whom he had}} fallen in love.

The two then proceed to reconstruct the missing portions of Sinidis' life, an intertextual exercise in which protagonist advises writer how to best perform his task.

2500|$|Although the Union Navy {{would provide}} {{most of the}} gunnery that {{would be needed to}} {{suppress}} the Rebel batteries, Burnside decided to have some gunboats under Army control. This immediately led to some interference between the two services.

Because the sailors were more experienced, they were able to get most of the more suitable ships. The Army was left with a mixed bag of rickety ships that were barely seaworthy. By the time the expedition got under way, the Navy had 20 gunboats, and the Coast Division had nine. The armada was supplemented by several canal boats converted into floating batteries, mounting boat howitzers and protected by sandbags and bales of hay.

2500|$|Among the {{inhabitants}} of the House during the siege were a number of notable men of letters and the arts, some of them were Royalist soldiers and others as Royalist refugees from London. William Faithorne, a pupil of Robert Peake's father was one of the besieged, and has left a clever satirical engraving of Hugh Peters (an enemy at the gate), as well as many other fine portraits. Yet another engraver, and a still more famous one, was in the House, was Wenceslaus Hollar (see Virtue's Life of him) engraved a portrait of the Marquis. Other inmates were Inigo Jones, the great architect, and Thomas Fuller, author of the [...] "Worthies of England" [...] who {{is said to have been}} engaged on that work <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>time</b> of the Siege, and to have been much interrupted by the noise of cannon.

2500|$|King Henry VIII {{appointed}} Sir William Denys (1470–1533) an Esquire of the Body at some date before 5 June 1511.

This grant is witnessed by a charter on parchment, to which is affixed a rare example of a perfect great seal of Henry VIII, now hanging in a frame beneath the main staircase of Dyrham Park. It clearly was handed down with the deeds of the manor on the termination of the Denys era at Dyrham.
