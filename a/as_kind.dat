White also authored Tudor Books of Private Devotion, English Devotional Literature, 1600–1640, Victorian Prose, The Metaphysical Poets (1935), Social Criticism in Popular Religious Literature of the Sixteenth Century, and numerous articles. Her religious works stemmed from her Roman Catholic reverence. White described her publishers <b>as</b> <b>kind</b> for publishing her unpopular scholarly works in-between her profitable novels.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Taxa and homologues can in {{our view}} be {{construed}} both <b>as</b> <b>kinds</b> and <b>as</b> individuals. However, the conceptualization of taxa <b>as</b> natural <b>kinds</b> {{in the sense of}} homeostatic property cluster kinds has been criticized by some systematists, as it seems that even such kinds cannot evolve due to their being homeostatic. We reply by arguing that the treatment of transformational and taxic homologies, respectively, as dynamic and static aspects of the same homeostatic property cluster kind represents a good perspective for supporting the conceptualization of taxa <b>as</b> <b>kinds.</b> The focus on a phenomenon of homology based on causal processes (e. g., connectivity, activityfunction, genetics, inheritance, and modularity) and implying relationship with modification yields a notion of natural kinds conforming to the phylogeneticevolutionary framework. Nevertheless, homeostatic property cluster kinds in taxonomic and evolutionary practice must be rooted in the primacy of epistemological classification (homology as observational properties) over metaphysical generalization (series of transformation and common ancestry as unobservational processes).

500|$|Following {{the success}} of the singer's 1993 career best-selling album Music Box, Carey and her {{management}} at Columbia Records began devising ideas and strategies for subsequent projects. Carey's then-husband, Tommy Mottola, head of Columbia's parent label Sony Music Entertainment, began mapping out possible follow ups for the singer during the pinnacle years of her career. During initial discussions regarding the thought of doing a Christmas-themed album with Carey and her writing partner of over four years, Walter Afanasieff, fear arose that it was not commercially expedient or wise to release holiday music at the peak of one's career, as it was more often equated with a release towards the end of a musician's waning career. Afanasieff recalled his sentiments during initial discussions for a holiday record: [...] "Back then, you didn't have a lot of artists with Christmas albums. It wasn't a known science at all back then, and there was nobody who did new, big Christmas songs. So we were going to release it <b>as</b> <b>kind</b> of an everyday, 'Hey, you know, we're putting out a Christmas album. No big deal.'" [...] Ultimately, with Mottola's persistence and Carey's initiative to be a [...] "risk-taker" [...] as Afanasieff put it, the song and its parent album, Merry Christmas, began taking form in early-mid 1994. Recording for the album began in June, while the Carey-Afanasieff songwriting duo penned [...] "All I Want for Christmas Is You" [...] in late August. Often referencing herself a festive person and demonstrating a usual penchant for her love of all things Christmas, Carey began decorating the home she shared with Mottola in upstate New York (which also came equipped with a personal recording studio) with Christmas ornaments and other holiday-inspired trinkets. In doing so, Carey felt she could capture the essence and spirit of what she was singing and make her vocal performance and delivery more emotive and authentic. The songwriting pair carved out the chords, structure and melody for the song in just a quarter of an hour: [...] "It's definitely not 'Swan Lake,' ' admits Afanasieff. 'But that's why it's so popular — because it's so simple and palatable!". At first, Afanasieff admitted that he was puzzled and [...] "blanched" [...] as to where Carey wanted to take the melody and vocal scales, though she was [...] "adamant" [...] in her direction for the song. In an interview with Billboard, Afanasieff described the type of relationship he and Carey shared in the studio and as songwriters for the song and in general: ...|$|E

[...] The action-adventure title involved the quest of protagonist Ryo Hazuki to avenge his father's murder, but its main selling point was its rendition of the Japanese city of Yokosuka, which included a level of detail considered unprecedented for a video game. Incorporating a simulated day/night cycle with variable weather, non-player characters with regular schedules, and the ability to pick up and examine detailed objects (also introducing the Quick-time event in its modern form), Shenmue went over budget and was rumored to have cost Sega over $50 million.
