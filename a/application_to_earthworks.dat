40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a brief overview}} of artificial intelligence applications in transportation geotechnics, highlighting new approaches and current research directions, including issues related to data mining interpretability and prediction capacities. Several practical <b>applications</b> <b>to</b> <b>earthworks,</b> including the compaction management and quality control aspects of embankments, as well as pavement evaluation, design and management, and the mechanical behaviour of jet grouting material, are presented to illustrate the advantages of using data mining, including artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and evolutionary computation techniques in this domain. This study also propose a novel simplified compaction table for reusing geomaterials and compaction management in embankments and applied one- and two-dimensional advanced sensitivity analyses to better interpret the proposed data-driven models for the prediction of the deformability modulus of jet grouting field samples. These applications show the capabilities of data mining models to address complex problems in transportation geotechnics involving highly nonlinear relationships of data and optimisation needs.

25|$|Geotechnical {{investigations}} are performed by geotechnical engineers or engineering geologists {{to obtain information}} on the physical properties of soil and rock around a site <b>to</b> design <b>earthworks</b> and foundations for proposed structures and for repair of distress <b>to</b> <b>earthworks</b> and structures caused by subsurface conditions. This type of investigation is called a site investigation. Additionally, geotechnical {{investigations are}} also {{used to measure the}} thermal resistivity of soils or backfill materials required for underground transmission lines, oil and gas pipelines, radioactive waste disposal, and solar thermal storage facilities. A geotechnical investigation will include surface exploration and subsurface exploration of a site. Sometimes, geophysical methods are used to obtain data about sites. Subsurface exploration usually involves soil sampling and laboratory tests of the soil samples retrieved.|$|R
40|$|A {{review of}} {{techniques}} {{used in industry}} showed {{that there is an}} absence of a formalised, systematic approach <b>to</b> <b>earthworks</b> planning. The techniques used tend to be subjective and time consuming with a heavy reliance given to the experience and knowledge of the planner. This absence of a formalised technique can lead to inaccurate planning and makes explanation of the techniques difficult. This paper describes {{the development of a new}} automated approach for use by the planners <b>to</b> generate <b>earthworks</b> activities that overcomes such limitations. As well as creating activity sets in a much shorter time, the ability to compare various sets allows the planner more scope when planning earthworks. The model is able to generate activity sets that are comparable to those generated by a project planner. ...|$|R

50|$|Geotechnical {{engineers}} and engineering geologists perform geotechnical investigations {{to obtain information}} on the physical properties of soil and rock underlying (and sometimes adjacent to) a site <b>to</b> design <b>earthworks</b> and foundations for proposed structures, and for repair of distress <b>to</b> <b>earthworks</b> and structures caused by subsurface conditions. A geotechnical investigation will include surface exploration and subsurface exploration of a site. Sometimes, geophysical methods are used to obtain data about sites. Subsurface exploration usually involves in-situ testing (two common examples of in-situ tests are the standard penetration test and cone penetration test). In addition site investigation will often include subsurface sampling and laboratory testing of the soil samples retrieved. The digging of test pits and trenching (particularly for locating faults and slide planes) may {{also be used to}} learn about soil conditions at depth. Large diameter borings are rarely used due to safety concerns and expense, but are sometimes used to allow a geologist or engineer to be lowered into the borehole for direct visual and manual examination of the soil and rock stratigraphy.|$|R
