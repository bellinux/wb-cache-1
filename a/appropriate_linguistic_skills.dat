The participants were administered various tests measuring their basic <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills</b> in Hebrew as their first language (L 1), including phonological and morpho-logical awareness, working memory, rapid naming—and a series of language tests: vocabulary, word and text reading, pseudo-word reading, and spelling. They were also administered tests in English as a foreign language (EFL) : vocabulary, word recognition, letter identification, text read-ing, and pseudo-word reading. All the participants completed an anxiety questionnaire with re-spect to both language sets, together with a personality questionnaire based on the Big Five model. The findings demonstrated a significant positive correlation between all the L 1 and EFL <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills.</b> A significant negative correlation was obtained between the <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills</b> in both lan-guages and anxiety towards English and Hebrew.

40|$|A {{considerable}} amount of research has examined the link between children’s peer acceptance, which refers {{to the degree of}} likability within the peer group, social functioning and emotional wellbeing, at a same age and in a long term perspective, pointing out to the contribution of peer acceptance for mental wellbeing. Our study proposes a sociometric methodology that, differently from many studies focused on individual classifications of social status, moves to the analysis of affiliative social networks within the class group. This study describes how individual factors such as socio-emotional competence, temperament, and <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills</b> are related to positive reciprocated nominations (=RNs) and examines the cliques generated by reciprocal nominations according to similarities (socio-emotional competence, temperament and <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills)</b> among cliques’ members. Eighty-four preschool children (M age = 62. 5 months) were recruited. The Sociometric Interview to assess RNs and the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test - Revised (PPVT-R; Dunn & Dunn, 1981) to assess receptive language were administered; the Social Competence and Behaviour Evaluation Short Form questionnaire (SCBE- 30; LaFreniere & Dumas, 1996) and the Quit Temperament Scale (Axia, 2002) were filled in by the teachers. Results showed that children with higher RNs presented higher scores in social orientation, positive emotionality, motor activity, <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills</b> and social competence (trend), and exhibited lower anxietywithdrawal. The analysis of cliques revealed that children preferred playmates with similar features: social competence, anger-aggression (trend), social orientation, positive emotionality, inhibition to novelty, attention, motor activity (trend) and <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills.</b> These findings provide insights about processes of peer affiliation, highlighting the role of socio-emotional functioning and <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills.</b> peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a neurobiologically inspired model of {{one aspect of}} adult second language acquisition (SLA) : procedural <b>linguistic</b> <b>skill</b> acquisition. Procedural <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills</b> are defined as the speaker/learner's implicit, unstatable knowledge regarding the formal linguistic (i. e., syntactic, phonological, and morphological) properties of the second language (L 2). Unlike declarative linguistic knowledge (i. e., semantic and lexical knowledge and explicit knowledge of the L 2 linguistic system), which can be readily displayed through verbal report or description, procedural <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills</b> are best demonstrated through performance. The proposed acquisition model crucially involves the neural circuitry of the neocerebellum. The neocerebellum is a brain structure which, although traditionally associated with purely motor activity, has recently been implicated in higher cognitive and, potentially, linguistic functions. The model provides for a potential unification of the competing cerebral (Ojemann, 1991; Loritz, 1991) and cerebellar (Rumelhart & McClelland, 1986 : Sokolik, 1990) theories of linguistic function by integrating the unique contributions of both regions of the cerebral cortex (e. g., Broca's expressive speech area and the prefrontal cortex responsible for cognitive planning and monitoring functions) and regions of the cerebellum (an enormous capacity parallel processor responsible for the integration of cognitive and sensory information). The proposed model also offers a principled account of how explicit formalized grammar instruction might potentially serve as an effective metacognitive strategy for the L 2 learner's acquisition of procedural <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills...</b>|$|R
40|$|Being able to {{positively}} {{interact and}} build relationships with playmates in preschool years {{is crucial to}} achieve positive adjustment. An update review and two studies on such topics were provided. Study 1 is observational; it investigates the type of social experience in groups (N = 443) of children (N = 120) at preschool age in child-led vs. teacher-led contexts. The results revealed that in child-led contexts children {{were more likely to}} be alone, in dyads, and in small peer groups; groups were mostly characterized by same-gender playmates who engaged in joint interactions, with few social interactions with teachers. In teacher-led contexts, on the other hand, children {{were more likely to be}} involved in small, medium and large groups; groups were mostly characterized by other-gender playmates, involved in parallel interactions, with teachers playing a more active role. The purpose of Study 2 was to describe the development of socio-emotional competence, temperamental traits and <b>linguistic</b> <b>skill.</b> It examined the role of children’s reciprocated nominations (=RNs) with peers, assessed via sociometric interview, in relation to socio-emotional competence, temperamental traits and <b>linguistic</b> <b>skill.</b> Finally, the similarity-homophily tendency was investigated. Socio-emotional competence and temperamental traits were assessed via teacher ratings, <b>linguistic</b> <b>skill</b> via test administration. Eighty-four preschool children (M age = 62. 53) were recruited within 4 preschool settings. Those children were quite representative of preschool population. The results revealed that children with higher RNs showed higher social competence (tendency), social orientation, positive emotionality, motor activity and <b>linguistic</b> <b>skill.</b> They exhibited lower anxiety-withdrawal.

40|$|The {{decline of}} the {{requisite}} <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills</b> of law students around {{the world has been}} documented comprehensively through legal scholarship. While ameliorating initiatives attempt to remedy law school education, the curriculization of English for academic legal purposes (EALP) has been neglected, resulting {{in the absence of a}} principled curricular framework for developing EALP syllabi. The proliferation of legal English communication across the circles of world English has accentuated the deterioration of students’ <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills</b> and exacerbated the educational challenges confronting law schools. These premises were influenced and validated by the researcher’s experiences as student and teacher of law and language. Three research questions address the rationale and guide the research: (1) Which curricular principles can be deduced from theoretical linguistics, second language (L 2) pedagogy, and legal education to constitute a framework for EALP? (2) Which legal <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills</b> clusters can be identified from a typology of EALP-type textbooks? (3) As research outcome, how can the literature review and textbook analysis be synthesized into a cohesive curricular framework for EALP that can be applied across the circles of world English? The cyclical research strategy that underpinned this qualitative study relied on a social constructionist worldview, case study methodology, and qualitative content analysis method. The literature review probed theoretical linguistics, L 2 pedagogy, and legal education as tributary disciplines of EALP. Insights gleaned from the literature review informed the qualitative content analysis of a purposive sample of EALP-type textbooks (N = 44). The textbooks were coded to create a typology and to determine the clusters of <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills</b> introduced during law school and across the circles of world English. The literature review led to the formulation of theoretically informed, curricular principles from the three disciplines that underpin EALP. The qualitative content analysis resulted in the creation of a typology of textbooks that exhibits clusters of <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills</b> that are scaffolded throughout law school. While academic communication skills were accentuated, legal <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills</b> incorporate additional clusters of thinking, research, and pedagogic skills. Together these skills constitute the skill of “thinking like a lawyer. ” A synthesis of the theoretical principles and skills clusters provides a holistic curricular framework for EALP that is sensitive to the local diversity within the circles of world English. The curricular framework for EALP draws legal English from the periphery to the center of law school education by accentuating the legal <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills</b> needed both in academia and in legal practice. The main limitations of the study are the challenges posed by the inclusion of original EALP syllabi and the manual coding of the textbook sample. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2015.

40|$|Recent {{empirical}} evidence demonstrates relationships between motor and language development that are partially mediated by exploration. This {{is in line}} with the embodied cognition approach to development that views language as grounded in real-life sensorimotor interactions with the environment. This view implies that the relations between motor and <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills</b> should be specific. Moreover, as motor development initially changes the possibilities children have to explore the environment, initial relations between motor and <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills</b> should become weaker over time. Empirical evidence pertaining to the duration and specificity of these relations is still lacking. The current study investigated longitudinal relations between attainment of walking and the development of several <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills,</b> and tested whether exploration through self-locomotion mediated these relations. <b>Linguistic</b> <b>skills</b> were measured at age 43 months, which is later than the age used in previous studies. Three hypotheses were tested: (1) the relations between walking and language found at younger ages will decrease over time (2) exploration through self-locomotion will remain an important predictor of spatial language (3) no relation will be found between walking, exploration and the use of grammatical and lexical categories and between exploration and general vocabulary. Thirty-one Dutch children took part in a longitudinal study. Parents reported about age of attainment of walking. Exploration through self-locomotion was measured using observations of play with a standard set of toys at age 20 months. Receptive vocabulary, spatial language and use of grammatical and lexical categories were measured at age 43 months using (standard) tests. Results reveal that age of walking does not directly predict spatial language at age 43 months. Exploration through self-locomotion does significantly and completely mediate the indirect effect of age of walking on spatial language. Moreover, neither age of walking nor exploration predict general vocabulary and the use of grammatical and lexical categories. Results support the idea that the initial relations between motor development and <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills</b> decrease over time and that these relations are specific and intrinsically dependent on the information children pick up through the execution of specific motor activities...|$|R

40|$|There are a {{high number}} of {{students}} who struggle with reading comprehension beyond the primary grades and understanding the skills involved in successful reading comprehension continues to be a topic of investigation. The Simple View of Reading (SVR) is a viable theory of reading that suggests reading comprehension results from developing skills in the areas of decoding and linguistic comprehension. This study examined the role of linguistic comprehension in reading comprehension within the SVR framework concurrently and over time in a sample of fourth-, fifth-, and sixth-grade students. I organized linguistic comprehension into word-, sentence-, and discourse-level <b>skills.</b> <b>Linguistic</b> comprehension is poorly defined in the extant literature and although results consistently support a relationship between linguistic and reading comprehension, no inference can be made regarding which specific <b>linguistic</b> comprehension <b>skills</b> are most influential in reading comprehension, concurrently or longitudinally. Through the use of hierarchical regression, results suggest that there are differential effects of the linguistic comprehension variable(s) on reading comprehension at all grades. Namely, word-level <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills</b> were significant positive predictors of reading comprehension at all grades. Similarly, discourse-level <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills</b> significantly predicted fourth- and fifth-grade, though not sixth-grade reading comprehension. Finally, sentence-level <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills</b> did not emerge as significant predictors of reading comprehension at any grade.

40|$|Background: Two broad {{approaches}} {{have been used}} to examine <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills</b> in Asperger syndrome (AS) and high functioning autism (HFA). One approach has aimed at determining the external validity of each diagnosis by investigating whether developmental language history, which differentiates AS from HFA, is relevant in long-term linguistic outcomes. An alternative approach, viewing AS and HFA as presentations on an autism spectrum (ASD), has investigated subgroups within the spectrum based on linguistic performance. Neither approach, however, has provided an in-depth description of the linguistic difficulties experienced in ASD necessary for therapy planning. Purpose: To provide clinically applicable research findings to extend the clinical understanding of the linguistic difficulties in ASD by: (1) comparing the <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills</b> in ASD with those of normally developing controls; (2) comparing the <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills</b> of children with ASD re-classified as AS and HFA using DSM-IV language criterion; (3) documenting the heterogeneity within a group of children with ASD by investigating within-group differences. Methods and procedures: Twenty children (aged 9; 0 - 17; 1 years) with a diagnosis of ASD were assessed using the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-Fourth Edition (CELF- 4) and the Test of Nonverbal Intelligence-Second Edition (TONI- 2). Performance by ASD participants was compared to typically developing peers. Re-classification of individuals with ASD as AS or HFA was undertaken using DSM-IV language criterion to determine between-group differences on linguistic measures. Hierarchical cluster analysis was undertaken using the ASD performance on the CELF- 4 to examine within-group differences based on linguistic abilities. Outcomes and results: There were significant differences between the ASD children and normally developing peers on a range of linguistic measures. There {{were no significant differences between}} the children re-classified as AS and HFA on the comprehensive linguistic assessment. Subgroups within ASD, based on linguistic performance, could be identified. Conclusions and implications: Collectively, the children with ASD in the study had a range of compromised <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills</b> relative to their peers. Children re-classified as AS could not be differentiated from children re-classified as HFA on current linguistic performance. An examination of subgroups of ASD participants revealed the heterogeneous nature of the <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills</b> associated with ASD, where linguistic proficiency ranged from above average performance to severe difficulties.

40|$|Auditory {{discrimination}} {{of speech}} stimuli {{is an essential}} tool in speech and language therapy, e. g., in dysarthria rehabilitation. It is unclear, however, which listener characteristics {{are associated with the}} ability to perceive differences between one's own utterance and target speech. Knowledge about such associations may help to support patients participating in speech and language therapy programs that involve auditory discrimination tasks. Discrimination performance was evaluated in 96 healthy participants over 60 years of age as individuals with dysarthria are typically in this age group. Participants compared meaningful words and sentences on the dimensions of loudness, pitch and speech rate. Auditory abilities were assessed using pure-tone audiometry, speech audiometry and speech understanding in noise. Cognitive measures included auditory short-term memory, working memory and processing speed. Linguistic functioning was assessed by means of vocabulary knowledge and language proficiency. Exploratory factor analyses showed that discrimination performance was primarily associated with cognitive and <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills,</b> rather than auditory abilities. Accordingly, older adults’ discrimination performance was mainly predicted by cognitive and <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills.</b> Discrimination accuracy was higher in older adults with better speech understanding in noise, faster processing speed, and better language proficiency, but accuracy decreased with age. This raises the question whether these associations generalize to clinical populations and, if so, whether patients with better cognitive or <b>linguistic</b> <b>skills</b> may benefit more from discrimination-based therapeutic approaches than patients with poorer cognitive or linguistic abilities...|$|R
