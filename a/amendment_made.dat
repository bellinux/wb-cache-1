5|$|On 19 January 1999, the Leader of the House of Commons, Margaret Beckett, {{introduced}} the House of Lords Bill into the House of Commons. The House of Commons passed the bill {{by a vote}} of 340 to 132 on 16 March. The next day it was presented to the House of Lords, where debate on the bill was far longer. One significant <b>amendment</b> <b>made</b> to the Bill was the so-called Weatherill Amendment, named for the Lord Weatherill, the former Speaker of the House of Commons. The Weatherill Amendment put into place the deal agreed to by the Prime Minister and Viscount Cranborne, and allowed 92 hereditary peers to remain members of the House of Lords.|$|E
25|$|The second {{annotation}} made {{a number}} of modifications to the BSA in an attempt to make it harder for money launderers to operate and easier for law enforcement and regulatory agencies to police money laundering operations. One <b>amendment</b> <b>made</b> to the BSA was to allow the designated officer or agency who receives suspicious activity reports to notify U.S. intelligence agencies.|$|E
500|$|A House and Senate conference {{committee}} proposed the amendment's final text, which banned voter restriction {{only on the}} basis of [...] "race, color, or previous condition of servitude". To attract the broadest possible base of support, the <b>amendment</b> <b>made</b> no mention of poll taxes or other measures to block voting, and did not guarantee the right of blacks to hold office. This compromise proposal was approved by the House on February 25, 1869, and the Senate the following day.|$|E

500|$|The Supreme Court {{reasoned}} that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth <b>Amendment</b> <b>made</b> {{the right to be}} able to compel defense witnesses to testify necessary for a defendant's [...] "due process" [...] rights to fair proceedings, which applies to the states. Only Justice John Marshall Harlan II parted from the Court's [...] "due process" [...] focus, though he agreed with the outcome, as he regularly did in cases involving whether to apply federal rights to state courts.|$|E
500|$|Carroll {{was charged}} with {{implementing}} {{an amendment to the}} state constitution approved by voters in 1975 to drastically reorganize the state's judicial system. The Kentucky Court of Appeals, the state's court of last resort, was renamed the Kentucky Supreme Court, and a new Court of Appeals was created and interposed between the Supreme Court and the state's circuit and district courts. The position of county judge was made a purely administrative position, and the office was renamed county judge/executive. Historian Lowell H. Harrison opined that the <b>amendment</b> <b>made</b> Kentucky's legal system [...] "a model for the nation." [...] Carroll also pushed through legislation eliminating the private bail-bond system.|$|E
500|$|Justice Harlan was {{strongly}} {{opposed to the}} theory that the Fourteenth Amendment [...] "incorporated" [...] the Bill of Rights—that is, made the provisions of the Bill of Rights applicable to the states. His opinion on the matter was opposite to that of his grandfather, who supported the full incorporation of the Bill of Rights. When it was originally ratified, the Bill of Rights was binding only upon the federal government, as the Supreme Court ruled in the 1833 case Barron v. Baltimore. Some jurists argued that the Fourteenth <b>Amendment</b> <b>made</b> the entirety of the Bill of Rights binding upon the states as well. Harlan, however, rejected this doctrine, which he called [...] "historically unfounded" [...] in his Griswold concurrence.|$|E

500|$|Negro citizens, North and South, who {{saw in the}} Thirteenth Amendment {{a promise}} of freedom—freedom to [...] "go and come at pleasure" [...] and to [...] "buy and sell when they please"—would be left with [...] "a mere paper guarantee" [...] if Congress were {{powerless}} to assure that a dollar {{in the hands of}} a Negro will purchase the same thing as a dollar {{in the hands of a}} white man. At the very least, the freedom that Congress is empowered to secure under the Thirteenth Amendment includes the freedom to buy whatever a white man can buy, the right to live wherever a white man can live. If Congress cannot say that being a free man means at least this much, then the Thirteenth <b>Amendment</b> <b>made</b> a promise the Nation cannot keep.|$|E
500|$|Sherman {{pressured}} {{his friends}} in the Senate to defeat the bill, or to limit it to production of a larger silver dollar, which would actually be worth 1/16th its weight in gold. These efforts were unsuccessful, but Allison's <b>amendment</b> <b>made</b> the bill less financially risky. Sherman thought Hayes should sign the amended bill but did not press the matter, and the President vetoed it. [...] "In view of the strong public sentiment {{in favor of the}} free coinage of the silver dollar", he later wrote, [...] "I thought it better to make no objections to the passage of the bill, but I did not care to antagonize the wishes of the President." [...] Congress overrode Hayes's veto and the bill became law. The effects of the Bland–Allison Act were limited: the premium on gold over silver continued to grow, and financial conditions in the country continued to improve.|$|E
500|$|In January 1854, Douglas {{introduced}} the Kansas–Nebraska Act {{to organize the}} Nebraska Territory. Southerners had thwarted his previous attempts to organize the territory because Nebraska lay north of parallel 36°30' north, the line separating slave and free territory under the Missouri Compromise. They feared that the territory would be organized into new free states that would vote against the South on slavery issues. The Kansas–Nebraska Act allowed the territory's settlers {{to decide whether or}} not to permit slavery, an implicit repeal of the Missouri Compromise. Kentucky Senator Archibald Dixon's amendment to make the repeal explicit angered northern Democrats, but Breckinridge believed it would move the slavery issue from national to local politics, and he urged Pierce to support it. Breckinridge wrote to his uncle Robert that he [...] "had more to do than any man here, in putting [...] in its present shape", but Heck notes that few extant records support this claim. The repeal <b>amendment</b> <b>made</b> the act more palatable to the South; only 9 of 58 Southern congressmen voted against it. No Northern Whigs voted for the measure, but 44 of 86 Northern Democrats voted in the affirmative, enough to pass it. The Senate quickly concurred, and Pierce signed the act into law on May 30, 1854.|$|E

During a national emergency the Oireachtas may pass laws that would otherwise be unconstitutional, and the actions of the executive cannot be found to be ultra vires or unconstitutional provided they at least [...] "purport" [...] to be in pursuance of such a law. However, the constitutional prohibition on the death penalty (Article 15.5.2°), introduced by an <b>amendment</b> <b>made</b> in 2001, is an absolute exception to these powers.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2016, {{the company}} sued the U.S. government, arguing that secrecy orders were {{preventing}} {{the company from}} disclosing warrants to customers {{in violation of the}} company's and customers' rights. Microsoft argued that it was unconstitutional for the government to indefinitely ban Microsoft from informing its users that the government was requesting their emails and other documents, and that the Fourth <b>Amendment</b> <b>made</b> it so people or businesses had the right to know if the government searches or seizes their property. On October 23, 2017, Microsoft said it would drop the lawsuit {{as a result of a}} policy change by the Department of Justice (DoJ). The DoJ had “changed data request rules on alerting internet users about agencies accessing their information.” [...] The new policy mandated defined periods of time for secrecy orders from the government.|$|E
2500|$|They {{note that}} two Ohio courts ruled that Ohio's similar <b>amendment</b> <b>made</b> the state's {{domestic}} violence laws unconstitutional {{as applied to}} unmarried couples, because they created a [...] "quasi-marital relationship". (although the decisions were later reversed). [...] Supporters of the FMA assert that this argument was an invalid scare tactic from the outset and that the FMA would not prevent laws against domestic abuse from being applied to unmarried couples. In Ohio, 8 of the 10 Ohio Courts that addressed {{the effect of the}} State Amendment on Domestic Violence Laws found no conflict. Additionally several Attorneys General of other states issued legal opinions finding that no such conflict would exist. With the final ruling of the Supreme Court of Ohio, which held that the DV Statute was not in-conflict, no State faces any contention between marriage Statutes and Domestic Violence Laws.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003 Helen Giddings, a Democratic {{member of}} the Texas House of Representatives, first {{authored}} the anti student-teacher sex bill but only intended for it to into effect if the student is 17 or younger. Warren Chisum of Pampa removed the maximum age from the bill. The bill was passed in 2003. Shortly after the law passed, a teacher engaged in sexual intercourse with her 18-year-old student, and a Texas court refused to indict her. In 2011 an <b>amendment</b> <b>made</b> it so that a teacher is forbidden from having sexual relations with any student in his/her school district, not just his/her school. Afterwards criminal prosecutions of teachers in relationships with students going to other schools in the same school district, including teachers of other educational levels, began occurring. In response to this law, Houston lawyer Dick DeGuerin stated [...] "Unless there's real strong evidence of a teacher trading sex for grades or using improper influence, then it's a statute that is really open to abuse." ...|$|E
2500|$|This {{right has}} been {{incorporated}} against the states. [...] See Duncan v. Louisiana, , which guarantees {{the right to}} a jury trial in non-petty cases.

It guarantees that 'the accused shall enjoy {{the right to a}} trial, by an impartial jury [...]'" [...] However, the size of the jury, as well as the requirement that it unanimously reach its verdict, vary between federal and state courts. [...] Even so, the Supreme Court has ruled that a jury in a criminal case may have as few as six members. [...] Williams v. Florida, [...] [...] If there are twelve, only nine jurors need agree on a verdict. [...] Furthermore, there is no right to a jury trial in juvenile delinquency proceedings held in state court.

2500|$|Speaker Nancy Pelosi {{scheduled}} {{the vote}} for June 26, 2009.

On the day of the vote, Democrats were still working to ensure they had the votes needed to pass the bill. [...] Republicans tried to pull back their proposed amendments, realizing they were giving the Democrats more time to corral votes, however, they were unable to pull their proposed amendments off the floor. [...] Shortly before the vote, John Boehner read aloud to the House from most of the 300 page Manager's amendment that was filed at 3:09AM {{on the day of the}} vote. [...] He voiced opposition to the practice of changing bills in the middle of the night before the vote, and concern that the Manager's <b>amendment</b> <b>made</b> substantial changes to the bill. [...] He did not want the House to vote on the bill before the members could learn what was in the amendment, so he read much of it aloud. [...] Manager's amendments are supposed to be for clerical changes only, not substantive ones. [...] Patrick J.
