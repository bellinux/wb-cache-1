5000|$|Reinhardt was {{captured}} by the Allies in 1945, and on 17 June 1949 he was classified as a Hauptschuldiger (literally [...] "main culprit") at a Denazification proceeding, and sentenced to four years in labour prison. In an <b>appeal</b> <b>proceeding</b> late in 1949, the sentence was upheld, but the penalty reduced to three years. By late 1950 the sentence was definitively confirmed. Reinhardt's time in custody was to be counted towards his penalty, which led to his immediate release.|$|E

From 1951 to 1953, he belonged, along with other former Nazi leaders such as Werner Best and Werner Naumann, to the Neo-Nazi [...] "Naumann Circle" [...] and so was arrested in January 1953 by British police, who suspected him of building up a secret organization; he was later handed over to German authorities. He was released on 17 June 1953. On 3 December 1954, his trial was suspended for lack of any adequate suspicion of wrongdoing. From February 1954 to 8 April 1977, he {{was the owner of}} a medical practice in Hamburg.|$|E
50|$|The {{challenge}} and subsequent stay motion was partly filed {{as a reaction}} to Sinclair Broadcast Group's acquisition of Tribune Media (announced on May 8), which - with the more than 230 stations that the combined company would have, depending on any divestitures in certain markets where both groups own stations - would expand the group's national reach to 78% of all U.S. households with at least one television set with the discount. On June 1, 2017, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals issued a seven-day administrative stay to the UHF discount rulemaking to review the emergency stay motion. The D.C. Court of Appeals denied the emergency stay motion in a one-page memorandum on June 15, 2017, however, the merits of restoring the discount is still subject to a court <b>appeal</b> <b>proceeding</b> scheduled to occur at a later date.|$|E

40|$|In Europe, {{the most}} influental {{competition}} policy enforcing agency is the European Commission. The Commission applies antitrust, state aid and merger law {{as well as}} initiates new legislation thereby shaping the competitive process on the old continent. However, how well the institution is working in terms of legal certainty and economic justice is an open issue. This paper surveys critically the history of European antitrust policy {{from the perspective of}} the European Court of Justice since the grounds for its implementation were set in 1962. The data cover all antitrust decisions by the European Commission decided under Articles 81 and 82 resulting into an <b>appeal</b> <b>proceeding.</b> First, we present a number of descriptive statistics on the European Court of Justice antitrust sentences in form of a historical overview including landmark case discussion. Issues such as the grounds for appeal, revisions of the original decision, the duration and length of the appeals proceedings and probabilities of success depending on characteristics such as the type of infringement originally found are considered. Thereafter, we estimate a model evaluating the quality of the Commission’s work with respect to Court sentences using a multinomial logit on the sentence and regressions on fine reduction and cost sharing by the parties...|$|E
40|$|The {{regulation}} of the legal nature of an <b>appeal</b> <b>proceeding</b> or a judgment crowning the proceeding is ambiguous and unclear. The National Appeals Chamber which issues a judgment decides upon the validity of a contract, the obligations of the contracting authority, ﬁnancial penalties, and, indirectly, the actions taken by contractors. The inﬂuence of such decisions is of theoretical and practical signiﬁcance and justiﬁes an analysis presented in the paper. Thus the constitutive features of judgments handed down by a public administration body have been analysed and compared with typical forms of law enforcement (judicial decisions of the common courts, decisions issued by arbitration courts and individual administrative decisions). The latter have been given particular attention. The deliberations {{were based on the}} position of the doctrine of the law on public procurements, provisions of civil law and administrative law, as well as judicial decisions and judgments issued by the National Appeals Chamber. These were then analysed in the light of normative regulations of the Act on Public Procurements. The analysis revealed a multitude of problems resulting from the adoption by the legislature of atypical forms of action by the National Board of Appeal. The analysis provides the basis for further research aimed to create a coherent system regulating public procurements to ensure its proper functioning and to reduce the possibility of further interpretative problems. 2141471676 Studia Prawa Publiczneg...|$|E
