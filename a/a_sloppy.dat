5|$|Another {{factor in}} Wallace's {{thinking}} was his belief that, {{because of the}} action of natural selection, organisms were {{in a state of}} balance with their environment, and that everything in nature, even disease-causing organisms, served a useful purpose in the natural order of things; he feared vaccination might upset that natural balance with unfortunate results. Wallace and other anti-vaccinationists pointed out that vaccination, which at the time was often done in <b>a</b> <b>sloppy</b> and unsanitary manner, could be dangerous.|$|E
5|$|On June 11, 2011, {{the three}} year-old {{finished}} {{fifth in the}} Belmont Stakes after holding the lead {{for much of the}} race on <b>a</b> <b>sloppy</b> track. As the pacesetter, Shackleford led throughout most of the 1-1/2 mile race, which started with a moderate quarter-mile in :23.9, then slowed to a leisurely :49.0 for the opening half, 1:14.5 for three-quarters, and 1:39.9 for a mile. After leading the first nine furlongs, he faded in the stretch. Winner Ruler On Ice as well as Stay Thirsty, Brilliant Speed and Nehro passed him.|$|E
5|$|Knightly Dawn {{was entered}} into the race on June 6 and was thought to bring early speed to the race and alter the way it would be run. Before Knightly Dawn's entry, Secretariat was speculated to lead from the race's start. With the {{presence}} of Knightly Dawn, William Bonifice believed that Secretariat would have to run faster earlier on, thus making the final half-mile more unpredictable. Pancho Martin, the trainer of Knightly Dawn, said he would only run the horse if it rained as Knightly Dawn's only previous success {{had been in the}} Jersey Derby on <b>a</b> <b>sloppy</b> track. However, Knightly Dawn was scratched prior to race day. The horse's scratch also reduced the winner's share from $150,200 to $90,120.|$|E

5|$|Two {{weeks after}} winning the Kentucky Derby, American Pharoah entered the second leg of the Triple Crown, the 2015 Preakness Stakes, run over {{nine and a half}} furlongs at Pimlico Race Course. Despite an {{unfavorable}} inside draw of the number one post position, he was installed as the morning line favorite ahead of Firing Line and Dortmund. No horse had won the Preakness starting from the rail since 1994. Immediately before post time, the weather changed to a heavy downpour with thunder. The last time the Preakness had been run on <b>a</b> <b>sloppy</b> track was in 1983, and American Pharoah was the only horse in the field to have previously faced similar conditions, having won the Rebel Stakes running in rain and mud.|$|E
5|$|The Georgetown Hoyas {{participated in}} the Great Alaska Shootout to start the 198182 season. The Hoyas lost their opening game to Southwestern Louisiana 7061 after playing <b>a</b> <b>sloppy</b> game. After winning the {{following}} game against, the Hoyas lost to Ohio State by one point in their {{final game of the}} tournament. Georgetown then began a thirteen-game win streak, which was followed by losing three straight to three conference opponents. The Hoyas then finished the regular season with nine more wins and one loss, which was good enough to finish second in the Big East regular season standings. The Hoyas won their first two games of the Big East Tournament by a collective margin of 29 points and advanced to the championship game against the Villanova Wildcats. The two teams were tied at halftime, but at halftime the Hoyas elected to use a man to man defense over a zone. This proved effective as they were able to force turnovers and shoot well from the field, which led them to win the game 7254. The Georgetown Hoyas won the Big East Tournament and also, a bid to the NCAA Tournament.|$|E
25|$|Justin Verlander pitched <b>a</b> <b>sloppy</b> {{first inning}} for Detroit, walking three and tying a World Series {{record for a}} single inning by {{throwing}} two wild pitches. He avoided allowing any runs, however, thanks to a good play by shortstop Carlos Guillén to get the third out on what was almost an infield hit.|$|E
50|$|In the {{television}} series, {{the character of}} Det. Sid Kirmani, portrayed by Raoul Bhaneja, {{appeared to have been}} based at least in part on Carmichael. He, like Carmichael, is highly skeptical of Harry's intentions and rejects the idea of magic out of hand. However, he is much younger, thinner and more dapper, and some episodes imply that he is <b>a</b> <b>sloppier</b> detective than his novel counterpart.|$|R
50|$|On 17 July 1791, Hébert {{was at the}} Champ de Mars to sign a {{petition}} to demand the removal of King Louis XVI and {{was caught up in}} the subsequent Champ de Mars massacre by troops under Lafayette. This put him in the revolutionary mindset, and the Le Père Duchesne adopted <b>a</b> <b>sloppier</b> style to better appeal to the masses. Le Père Duchesne began to attack Lafayette, Mirabeau, and Bailly. Following Louis's failed flight to Varennes he began to attack both Louis and Pope Pius VI as well.|$|R
50|$|Tampa Bay and Tennessee {{combined}} for 9 turnovers on <b>a</b> rainy, <b>sloppy</b> afternoon. Chris Johnson ran for 190 yards, but Tampa Bay led 17-10 {{late in the}} fourth quarter.|$|R
25|$|Op-amps are {{designed}} {{to operate in the}} linear mode with negative feedback. Hence, an op-amp typically has a lengthy recovery time from saturation. Almost all op-amps have an internal compensation capacitor which imposes slew rate limitations for high frequency signals. Consequently, an op-amp makes <b>a</b> <b>sloppy</b> comparator with propagation delays that can be as long as tens of microseconds.|$|E
25|$|Holy Bull was the {{favorite}} in the 1994 Kentucky Derby but after breaking poorly, he finished a distant 12th on <b>a</b> <b>sloppy</b> track. Croll later claimed that the horse must have been tampered with, as he had behaved in an uncharacteristically lethargic manner before the race. Holy Bull was treated for several days after the race with antibiotics against a possible infection and missed {{a few days of}} training.|$|E
25|$|He next ran the Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park {{which ended}} up being exactly like the Preakness for him. Got in a speed duel on <b>a</b> <b>sloppy</b> track, stuck on the rail and Exaggerator took off to win. He took yet another rest and ran in the Pennsylvania Derby. Finally on a fast track {{for the first time}} since May, {{everyone}} thought this would be the his race to win but he faded to sixth.|$|E

25|$|The season {{opened on}} <b>a</b> wet, <b>sloppy</b> field. Tulane beat Louisiana College of Pineville 77–0. Coach Shaughnessy only allowed his regulars to play {{half of the}} game. Lester Lautenschlaeger was {{probably}} {{the star of the}} game.|$|R

25|$|Middlesbrough faced Bristol City away in {{the third}} round of the FA Cup, the same tie they faced in the fourth round the {{previous}} year. Prior to the match, many pundits were predicting that the game could see a shock result with Bristol City winning. After 18 minutes it seemed they might be right as Boro conceded <b>a</b> <b>sloppy</b> goal to Liam Fontaine, but the Premier League side fought back, with goals from Stewart Downing and David Wheater giving Boro a 2–1 victory.|$|E
25|$|After <b>a</b> <b>sloppy</b> first half, Penn State scored 17 {{unanswered}} {{points in}} the second half and then withstood a late charge to hold off the Golden Knights for a 27–24 win. Zack Mills was 13 of 20 for 194 yards with two touchdowns and no interceptions. On defense, Anthony Adams recovered a fumbled snap to set up a field goal, and Derek Wake blocked a field goal attempt. Trailing 27–9 in the fourth quarter, UCF got within three points with 24 seconds remaining but failed to recover the onside kick, and Penn State ran out the clock.|$|E
25|$|Hosokawa {{was forced}} to resign in April 1994 after it came to light that he had {{accepted}} a 100-million-yen loan from a trucking company previously accused of bribery and links to organized crime. Amid allegations of bribery, Hosokawa argued that the money was a loan and produced a receipt to show that he had paid it back; LDP members passed around a copy remarking that it looked like <b>a</b> <b>sloppy</b> fake. Although Hosokawa still had high public approval at the time, opinion was growing that he could not meet the expectations set at the start of his term.|$|E

25|$|The SLA {{believed}} that its future depended on {{its ability to}} acquire new members and realized that, because of the killing of Marcus Foster, few if any people in the Bay Area underground wished to join them. Cinque suggested moving the organization to his former neighborhood in Los Angeles, where he had friends whom they might recruit. However, they relocated in <b>a</b> <b>sloppy</b> manner and had much difficulty in becoming established on their new turf. The SLA relied on commandeering housing and supplies in Los Angeles, and thus alienated the people who were ensuring their secrecy and protection. At this stage, the imprisoned SLA member Russell Little said that he believed the SLA had entirely lost sight of its goals and had entered into a confrontation with the police rather than a political dialogue with the public.|$|E
25|$|Ranked {{eighth in}} the ICC ODI Championship {{at the start of}} the tournament, Pakistan started poorly, before {{improving}} progressively in each game. They lost to India in the first game by 124 runs in <b>a</b> <b>sloppy</b> display, but then defeated top-ranked South Africa by 19 runs by virtue of Duckworth–Lewis method in their next game. They gained momentum and beat Sri Lanka by 3 wickets in their final group game, a thrilling must-win encounter, and qualified for the semi-finals placed second in Group B, behind India on net run rate. In the semi-final, England with their undefeated run and home advantage were tipped firm favourites. However, they were outplayed by Pakistan with both bat and ball, the latter winning comprehensively by 8 wickets with almost 13 overs to spare. This paved the road for Pakistan's first qualification to a Champions Trophy final.|$|E
500|$|The false door {{inscription}} of Shery {{might indicate}} that Peribsen is identical with king Senedj ("Senedj" [...] means [...] "the frightening") {{and that this}} name {{was used in the}} king lists by proxy, as the Seth name was forbidden mention. In contrast, Dietrich Wildung and Wolfgang Helck identify Peribsen with the Ramesside cartouche name Wadjenes. They think {{it is possible that the}} name Per-ib-sen was misread from <b>a</b> <b>sloppy</b> hieratic inscription of Wadj-sen.|$|E

In The American Scholar, Asher Lans penned a more positive review of The Rich and the Super-Rich, saying that while it was [...] "too long, at points factually erroneous, and often prone to oversimplification", these faults were minor and the volume represented an [...] "immensely important and provocative popularization of insufficiently noticed tendencies in the political economy".|$|E
