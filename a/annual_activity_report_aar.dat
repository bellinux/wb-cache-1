The thematic procedures of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights ('Commission') were engaged more extensively than before, culminating in the adoption by the Commission of country resolutions on the situation of human rights in Ethiopia, Sudan, Uganda and Zimbabwe. These country resolutions generated, for the first time, direct confrontation between the Assembly of the Heads of State and Government of the African Union ('Assembly') and the Commission at a Summit of the Assembly held in Khartoum in January 2006. As a result, the Commission's 19 th <b>Annual</b> <b>Activity</b> <b>Report</b> that had contained these resolutions was embargoed by the Assembly. These resolutions were released later in the 20 th <b>Annual</b> <b>Activity</b> <b>Report</b> after Ethiopia, Sudan, Uganda and Zimbabwe had formally responded to the Commission. During the period under review, the Commission also sought to enhance its capacity by reviewing its status, mandate and independence in the framework of the African Union and developed the practice of exposing the imperfect record of periodic reporting by States Parties to the African Charter on Human and the Peoples' Rights 1981 ('African Charter'). 2 The growing number of individual complaints on the docket of the Commission was also apparent, and three of the Commission's most important decisions made in the period under review are discussed subsequently...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{functioning}} of the French committees for the protection of people in biomedical research (CCPPRB). DESIGN: An independent evaluator visited all of the committees and analyzed their functioning by assessing the <b>annual</b> <b>activity</b> <b>reports,</b> filling data grids and observing the committees in session. RESULTS: We observed that the representation of a range of professions, which is required by law, was not always respected. This was partly because the administrative authority had accumulated delays in nominating members. Another explanation could be the absence of remuneration for the work and attendance of the members. There was considerable inter-committee variation concerning the way documents were distributed to the members during sessions and the extent of investigator and promoter involvement. Finally, large differences in the number of dossiers handled between committees led us to investigate the fairness of dossier distribution, as the number of dossiers dealt with has consequences, particularly for the finality of the opinions of the committees. CONCLUSIONS: This evaluation of the committees playing a crucial role in protecting participants in research trials provides new information that could be helpful for improving the way in which these committees function in the context of the European Directive...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{the relationship between}} CAMELS ratios and credit ratings of deposit banks in Turkey. Annual data {{was used for the}} period between 2004 and 2014 in this study. Moreover, 20 deposit banks of Turkey were analyzed and 21 different ratios of CAMELS components were used. In addition to that, credit ratings of these banks were provided from Moody’s corporation or <b>annual</b> <b>activity</b> <b>reports</b> of the banks. After that, we created multi nominal logistic regression analysis in order to illustrate the relationship. The major finding in this study is that three components (Asset Quality, Management Quality, and Sensitivity to Market Risk) of CAMELS have effects on credit ratings whereas the ratios related to Capital Adequacy and Earnings are not effective. As a result, it was recommended that Turkish deposit banks should concentrate on the percentage of fixed assets and interest income to have a better rating. Moreover, having high market share with respect to total assets and lower interest expense are also other important points for this purpose. On the other hand, Turkish deposit banks should control the proportion of financial assets and increase the amount of FX liquid assets to prevent credit ratings to decrease. Additionally, market share of banks for loans should not reach at high level for this objective. </p...|$|R

40|$|The Task Force on the Implications of the Evaluation of Faculty Productivity and Teaching Effectiveness {{was charged}} in 1999 by ASA Council to {{determine}} whether faculty productively measures (including outcomes assessment measures) used by {{institutions of higher education}} and various external agencies “threaten the freedom of faculty teaching and research. ” The Task Force was asked further to examine the ways in which productivity-reporting requirements affect faculty, to report on “best practices,” and to make any recommendations for appropriate ASA action to the Council. The report produced by the Task Force highlights the contextual factors that help to explain the increased emphasis in the United States on the evaluation of faculty productivity and the assessment of student learning outcomes including a series of social movements to adapt corporate models to the university and to consider teaching as scholarship. In addition, the Task Force stresses that discussions of faculty productivity are greatly complicated by definitional issues. The Task Force draws a critical distinction between the productivity of individual faculty members and the productivity of larger entities such as departments or colleges. They also distinguish between faculty productivity and student outcomes. Studies of aggregate productivity are complicated by numerous quantitative measures of the “production of students. ” While the gathering of data on individuals in the areas of scholarship, teaching, and service has a long history, disputes continue about how to measure these aspects of productivity. Faculty <b>annual</b> <b>activity</b> <b>reports</b> are the most common way to measure these types of productivity. These measures are then aggregated and provided to administrators. When an aggregate is the unit of analysis, faculty productivity can be measured by asking faculty members to complete <b>activity</b> <b>reports</b> that indicate how work time has been used over a given period of time (usually an academic year) ...|$|R
40|$|Pain {{frequently}} accompanies surgical and diagnostic procedures, medical illness, {{and injury}} {{in children and}} is a leading reason for parents to seek medical attention {{on behalf of their}} children. Although many misconceptions contributing to the undertreatment of pain in children have been dispelled over the last 20 years, as pediatric pain management services proliferated, pediatric pain is still not always effectively managed. Complications of analgesic therapy are frequent and may contribute significantly to patient discomfort and family distress, resulting in the decreased use of analgesics and increased pain. Less commonly, adverse effects of analgesic therapy can result in life threatening events such as respiratory depression. Fear of these complications can also result in the undertreatment of pediatric pain. Close surveillance for adverse effects of analgesic therapies coupled with rapid institution of appropriate interventions can reduce the impact of these adverse effects on the quality of patient comfort. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of adverse effects associated with the analgesic therapies most commonly employed by the pain management service at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Strategies for managing some of these adverse effects will also be discussed. Tracking clinical activities and outcomes is a desirable feature for any clinical service to facilitate continuous quality improvement. We designed a database to provide our pediatric pain management service with a means to track complications of analgesic therapy as well as a daily census of active patients and monthly and <b>annual</b> <b>activity</b> <b>reports.</b> Between 12 / 1 / 2001 – and 12 / 31 / 2003, we performed 2693 inpatient consultations (range: 81 - 147 consults/month).

It is a process related to the assessment of the outcome. Aim: The way in which the evaluations are implemented and the extent to which the outcome of the provided service is evaluated constitutes the subject matter of this research in regard to services and programmes provided in the Republic of Cyprus. Methodology: The investigation results of the effectiveness of the social sector services in Cyprus are presented with the formulation of specific research hypotheses/questions, which were examined by using the method of qualitative data analysis. The method was used for data collected during structured interviews, as well as archival material and service/administration documents of the agencies. Results: The majority of the organization of the social sector believes, that they implementing evaluation process, focuses on the technical/financial audit by the relevant state services and in <b>annual</b> <b>activity</b> <b>reports.</b> Contrary to this result, less than 25 % take actions after the completion of the evaluation, a significant indication of not conducting evaluations. Furthermore the majority considers that the administrative audit from the relevant state services covers the issue of the existence of experts. However, the results of the longitudinal analysis indicate the opposite. Although the agencies claim to conduct evaluations on an almost regular basis, in reality this does not happen. Conclusions: For the majority of the organization the evaluation is a type of audit which takes place exclusively to control specific operational parameters with the intention to impose sanctions in case of deviations. What actually happens is a partial, simple recording of the work done in <b>activity</b> <b>reports,</b> as well as the standard audit of accounts and safety issues by state services. These are conventional audits which are not related to conducting scientific evaluations and are confused with them.
