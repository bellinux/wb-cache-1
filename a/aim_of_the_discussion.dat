A considerable amount of data suggests that magnetic resonance imaging may also assist in delineating different phenotypes of patients with OA. Among multiple biochemical biomarkers identified, none is sufficiently validated and recognized to identify patients who should be treated.

The <b>aim</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>discussion</b> was to develop suggestions for the Riga city council on how to win the title “European Green Capital”.

However, the most important outcome of the discussion are the skills which students gained from the experience of presenting their ideas and discussing them with specialists of the specific field.
