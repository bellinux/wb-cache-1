40|$|We {{combined}} {{statistical analyses}} and GIS capabilities within the statistical environment R {{to create a}} semi-automated method {{for the assessment of}} <b>As</b> <b>hazard</b> risk in shallow groundwater in Cambodia. Arsenic concentration data for groundwaters of between 16 and 100 m depth were obtained from 1437 geo-referenced wells. We created a binary logistic regression model with these As measurements as the dependent variable and a number of raster maps (DEM-parameters, remote sensing images and geomorphology) as explanatory variables, and considering an As threshold of 10 ppb. This allowed us to make <b>an</b> <b>As</b> <b>hazard</b> map for groundwaters between 16100 m depth: this can be used to help to identify populations vulnerable to exposure. The logistic regression analysis indicates a good correlation between topographic and geomorphologic environmental variables and the <b>As</b> <b>hazard</b> risk in groundwater. Ease of implementation, and the ability to update, along with objectivity and reproducibility are the main advantages related to this method of analysis. JRC.

40|$|In {{this paper}} <b>an</b> <b>hazard</b> {{detection}} system algorithm, based on neural networks, able to reconstruct <b>an</b> <b>hazard</b> {{map of the}} landing area from a single image during the descent, is presented. During algorithms development {{it is very difficult}} to consider in advance all the types of morphological structures that can be encountered; the neural network approach allows to obtain a flexible system, able to operate also in conditions not explicitly considered during the project. Different networks analyze images at different scales, extracting from graphical information a certain number of indexes ascribable to physical properties, such as shadows, surface roughness and slopes. Then, these values are fused in <b>a</b> unique <b>hazard</b> map. Different network training methods are investigated: the use of both artificial and real images is compared. Results for different scenarios in a lunar landing case are shown and discussed, in order to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed system. Sensitivity to environmental parameters, such as light conditions, trajectory inclination and camera attitude is investigated. Finally, possible future improvements are suggested...|$|R

5|$|When landing, {{wind shear}} is also <b>a</b> <b>hazard,</b> {{particularly}} when the winds are strong. As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing, airspeed decreases while sink rate increases, and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact. The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.|$|E
5|$|Wind shear is also <b>a</b> <b>hazard</b> for {{aircraft}} making steep turns near the ground. It {{is a particular}} problem for gliders which have a relatively long wingspan, which exposes them to a greater wind speed difference for a given bank angle. The different airspeed experienced by each wing tip can result in an aerodynamic stall on one wing, causing a loss of control accident.|$|E

30|$|This study {{explores the}} impact of NPLs on bank {{liquidity}} creation to know whether <b>a</b> moral <b>hazard</b> problem exists in Chinese banks or not. There are many studies which analyze bank liquidity creation and NPLs from different perspectives but {{to the best of}} our knowledge, none of the studies use these concepts to investigate <b>a</b> moral <b>hazard</b> problem. Existing literature regarding <b>a</b> moral <b>hazard</b> problem use credit growth as a measure of bank risk taking, which is subjective in nature. Bank liquidity creation is a better measure of risk taking because its objective and include both on-balance-sheet and off-balance-sheet activities. It calculates the amount of liquidity creation or risk transformation, which gives us absolute amount of risk taken by banks. Our null hypothesis is that Chinese banks create more liquidity when NPLs increase, i.e., <b>a</b> moral <b>hazard</b> problem exists in Chinese banks.|$|R
