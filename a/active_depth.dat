Drainage on frost boils differs {{as a result of}} micro relief across the frost boil surface. In warm seasons (summer), the elevated center of the frost boil is moderately well drained compared to the depressed inter boil. The permafrost table surface is also affected by differing activity across the boil. The inner boil is more active and generally has more than twice the <b>active</b> <b>depth</b> than the inter boil, which causes the permafrost table surface to be in a nearly perfect bowl shape.|$|E

Given a low-resolution depth image from an <b>active</b> <b>depth</b> sensor and a potentially high-resolution color image from a passive RGB camera, we formulate it as an adaptive cost aggregation problem and solve it using the bilateral filter. The formulation synergistically combines the median filter and the bilateral filter; thus it better preserves the depth edges and is more robust to noise. Numerical and visual evaluations on a total of 37 Middlebury data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

The <b>active</b> layer <b>depth</b> varied from year to year and was deepest in the warm summer of 2001 – 02 at all recording sites. No trends of overall increase or decrease in <b>active</b> layer <b>depth</b> were evident across the up-to-eight years of data investigated.

40|$|Abstract. The {{amount of}} water that {{can be stored in}} soil and {{evaporated}} or actively used by plants is a key parameter in hydrologic models and is important for crop and pasture production. Often, the active soil moisture store is estimated from laboratory measurements of soil properties. An alternative approach, described in this paper, is to estimate the extractable soil moisture capacity from direct measurements of soil moisture content in the field. A time series of soil moisture values, over the depth of the soil, shows the actual changes in water content. The difference between the wettest and driest profiles is an estimate of the extractable soil moisture storage. We have gathered data on extractable soil water capacity for 180 locations over Australia and have compared our values with published results from the Atlas of Australian Soils (AAS), derived from profile descriptions and pedo-transfer functions. Our results show that data from the AAS provide a useful lower bound for measured extractable soil moisture storage, but of the sites examined, 42 % had values> 2 times those in the AAS. In part, this was because total soil depths were underestimated in the AAS results compared with the <b>active</b> <b>depths</b> from the measured data. <b>Active</b> <b>depths</b> are strongly related to vegetation type...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{a method}} for the {{treatment}} of the swelling of expansive soil is numerically simulated. The method is simply based on the embedment of a geogrid (or a geomesh) in the soil. The geogrid is extended continuously inside the volume of the soil where the swell is needed to be controlled and orientated towards the direction of the swell. Soils with different swelling potentials are employed: bentonite base-Na and bentonite base-Ca samples in addition to kaolinite mixed with bentonite. A numerical analysis was carried out by the finite element method to study the swelling soil's behavior and investigate the distribution of the stresses and pore water pressures around the geocells beneath the shallow footings. The ABAQUS computer program was used as a finite element tool, and the soil is represented by the modified Drucker-Prager/cap model. The geogrid surrounding the geocell is assumed to be a linear elastic material throughout the analysis. The soil properties used in the modeling were experimentally obtained. It is concluded that the degree of saturation and the matric suction (the negative pore water pressure) decrease as the angle of friction of the geocell column material increases due to the activity of the sand fill in the dissipation of the pore water pressure and the acceleration of the drainage through its function as a drain. When the plasticity index and the <b>active</b> <b>depth</b> (the active zone is considered to be equal to the overall depth of the clay model) increase, the axial movement (swelling movement) and matric suction, {{as a result of the}} increase in the axial forces, vary between this maximum value at the top of the layer and the minimum value in the last third of the <b>active</b> <b>depth</b> and then return to a consolidation at the end of the depth layer...|$|E

To predict permafrost stability in organic soils, we adapted an existing soil temperature model (GIPL 2. 0) to peatlands by including a three-layer peat soil column and dynamic soil moisture. GIPL 2. 0 numerically solves the 1 -dimensional heat transfer equation. We evaluated the model at Daring Lake Fen, a sedge-dominated Arctic Fen in the Northwest Territories, Canada and College Peat, a permafrost muskeg in Fairbanks, AK. We examined {{the sensitivity of}} the model to seasonality and total soil moisture, thermal properties and organic layer thickness. We also evaluated <b>active</b> layer <b>depth</b> for future climate scenarios. Finally, we compared the relative magnitude of climate change impacts on soil temperatures to the effects of current and predicted wildfire. We simulated wildfire by removing the surface soil (5 - 15 cm) and increasing air temperatures post-fire due to changes in surface energy balance. We found that air temperature, rather than changes in soil moisture, was the most important predictor of changes in <b>active</b> layer <b>depth</b> and permafrost stability. Also, the seasonality of soil moisture was relatively unimportant, while changes in temperature seasonality were important to <b>active</b> layer <b>depths.</b> In the climate change scenarios (using IPCC scenario A 1 b), <b>active</b> layer <b>depths</b> and the length of the growing season (determined as soil thawed at 10 cm) increased significantly by 2100. Warmer soil temperatures at depth due to higher air temperatures resulted in an increase of liquid water in the soil and the possibility of increased biological activity. Soil temperatures and <b>active</b> layer <b>depths</b> increased following disturbance, but the increases were relatively short-lived (decades) and were strongly correlated with post-fire temperature changes. The simulated removal of a shallow layer of surface organic soil following disturbance has limited long-term effects on soil temperatures. Therefore, we anticipate that climate change will have much larger effects than disturbance on permafrost stability at cold sites with thick organic soil, unless disturbance causes a long-term shift in vegetation communities and site energy balance...|$|R

40|$|The {{timing of}} the spring {{phytoplankton}} bloom in the subpolar North Atlantic Ocean has important consequences for the marine carbon cycle and ecosystems. There are currently several proposed mechanisms to explain {{the timing of this}} bloom. The conventional theory holds that the bloom begins when the ocean warms and the seasonal mixed layer shoals in the spring, decreasing the depth to which phytoplankton are mixed and increasing the light available to the population. Recent work has attributed the beginning of the bloom to decreases in turbulence within the upper ocean, driven by the onset of positive heat fluxes or decreases in the strength of local winds. Other studies have focused on the increase in the seasonal mixed layer in the winter as a driver of changes in ecosystem interactions and a control on the spring bloom. Finally, submesoscale eddies, occurring as a result of lateral density gradients, have been proposed as a stratification mechanism that can create phytoplankton blooms prior to the onset of ocean surface warming. This dissertation critically examines and compares the proposed theories for the initiation of the spring bloom and draws on these theories to propose a new framework: that blooms begin when the <b>active</b> mixing <b>depth</b> shoals, a process generally driven by a weakening of surface heat fluxes and consequent shift from convective mixing to wind-driven mixing. Using surface forcing data, we develop a parameterization for the <b>active</b> mixing <b>depth</b> from estimates of the largest energy-containing eddies in the upper ocean. Using in situ records of turbulent mixing and biomass, we find that the spring phytoplankton bloom occurs after mixing shifts from being driven by convection to being driven by wind, and that biomass increases as the <b>active</b> mixing <b>depth</b> shoals. Using remote sensing data, we examine patterns of bloom initiation in the North Atlantic at the basin scale, compare current theories of bloom initiation, and find that the shoaling of the <b>active</b> mixing <b>depth</b> better predicts the onset of the bloom across the North Atlantic subpolar basin and over multiple years than do other current theories. Additionally, using a process study model, we evaluate the importance of submesoscale eddy-driven stratification as a control on the initiation of the spring bloom, determining that this mechanism has a relatively minor effect on alleviation of phytoplankton light limitation. Finally, we describe potential techniques and tools to examine whether interannual variability in the <b>active</b> mixing <b>depth</b> acts as a control on variability in the {{timing of the}} spring bloom.

Depth estimates are generated continuously by a probabilistic depth estimation framework for both types of features {{to compensate for the}} lack of depth measurements and inaccurate feature depth associations. The framework models explicitly the uncertainty of triangulating depth from both point and line observations to validate and obtain precise estimates.

This paper seeks to address this gap by presenting a datadriven method to estimate a hand pose from a stereoscopic camera input, by introducing a stochastic approach to propose potential depth solutions to the observed stereo capture and evaluate these proposals using two convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The first CNN, configured in a Siamese network architecture, evaluates how consistent the proposed depth solution is to the observed stereo capture. The second CNN estimates a hand pose given the proposed depth. Unlike sequential approaches that reconstruct pose from a known depth, our method jointly optimizes the hand pose and depth estimation through Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. This way, pose estimation can correct for errors in depth estimation, and vice versa. Experimental results using an inexpensive stereo camera show that the proposed system more accurately measures pose better than competing methods...|$|E

40|$|The {{coastal area}} is a dynamic {{environment}} that suffers from human interventions and climate change. This requires extensive research and monitoring of the coastal areas. Measurement systems {{play a key role}} in the monitoring. Current velocities are for example often measured to investigate local hydrodynamics. At the moment the ADCP is often used to measure current velocities. The disadvantage of this measurement system is the lack of spatial information. New innovative measurement systems are developed to overcome this disadvantage. The X-Band radar is an example of such a measurement system. The X-Band radar can be used to survey water surfaces resulting in images with wave information. These images can be used to derive current, depth and wave information. The main advantage of the X-Band radar is the spatial extend. The radar images have a range over several kilometres. The aim of this study is to validate X-Band derived current velocities. SeaDarQ is an algorithm that can be used to process the X-Band radar images and derive depth, current and wave information. The technique used in the SeaDarQ algorithm was developed by (Young et al., 1985). A 3 D Fourier Transformation is used to gain the wave information from the images. Subsequently the linear dispersion relation, which describes the fixed relation between wavenumber and wave frequency as a function of the depth and the current, is fitted through the obtained wave information to derive the depth and the current. The algorithm is analysed to find the valid depth for the derived currents. The analysis has revealed that the current is fitted using the short waves obtained from the images. The <b>active</b> <b>depth</b> of a wave depends on the ratio between the wave length and water depth. A long wave is active over a larger part of the water column than a short wave. The consequence of using the short waves for the current fit is therefore that the derived for the top part of the water column. A case study is done to validate the current output. A X-Band radar is installed near the Sand Motor, which is a large scale nourishment at the Dutch coast at ter Heijde. The velocity output from point of the SeaDarQ output field is compared with ADCP measurements during different metocean conditions. It can be concluded from the case study that the X-Band derived velocities are indeed valid for the top part of the water column. The measurement period includes calm periods as well as a severe storm. Wind from sea and from land is observed including wind speeds between zero and twenty meter per second. The wave height varied between 28 cm and 5 meters. The data comparison revealed that SeaDarQ is not able to derive current velocities with wind speeds lower than 2 m/s or heavy rain conditions. All other circumstances resulted in accurate velocity output. Also during stratified conditions, resulting from a fresh plume passing by, the SeaDarQ output is accurate. SeaDarQ can cope with the broad variety of conditions due to the current fitting procedure in which only the short waves are included. The short waves are less easily affected by the bottom than long waves due to their small <b>active</b> <b>depth.</b> The short waves follow therefor the linear dispersion relation very well. The same reasoning holds for the stratified conditions. The stratification does not affect the short waves that much due to the small <b>active</b> <b>depth.</b> The short waves follow the linear dispersion relation therefore very well during these conditions. This new measurement system can derive accurate current velocities and can therefor become a powerful measurement system in the future.

40|$|Recent {{mobilisation}} of soil {{organic matter}} (SOM) in permafrost of the northern high latitudes {{is thought to have}} a significant impact on the carbon balance in the atmosphere. However, the environmental processes which influence SOM accumulation and remobilisation still need to be investigated more accurately. This study investigates the quantity and quality of SOM on Herschel Island in the western Canadian Arctic in relation to various landscape characteristics. To reach this goal, soil moisture, total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) contents, stable carbon isotopes (∂¹³C) and TOC/TN ratios (C/N) were determined on 128 samples from twelve sediment cores reaching up to 250 cm depth. Drilling locations were chosen based on morphology, vegetation and soil properties and supported by satellite imagery and air photos. Seasonal thaw <b>depths</b> (<b>active</b> layer <b>depths)</b> correlate with ground disturbance and vegetation cover and lie between 20 and 100 cm. Well-preserved SOM is accumulated in the active layer and subjacent ice-rich permafrost of wet polygonal tundra. Uplands, hummocky tussock tundra and alluvial fans cover more than 50...|$|R
40|$|Morphological change, {{active layer}} {{variations}} and nearshore hydrodynamics were measured over a complete neap-spring-neap tidal cycle on a mixed sediment sand-and-gravel spit at Cayeux-sur-Mer, northern France. During {{the study period}} the tidal level reached 7. 33 m above Hydrographic Datum (HD) at the lowest neap tide and 9. 59 m at the spring tide. Incident waves approached from the southwest at angles of 15 - 40 to the beach. During the survey period significant wave heights 2 m 3. 6 % of the time. The significant wave period was 4 - 9 secs. Three key phases of morphological change were identified, mainly associated with maximum tidal levels: (i) berm accretion during calm wave conditions (tidal range moved from neap to spring tide); (ii) berm retreat and erosion in relation to sediment supply and wave conditions (tidal range still moving towards spring tide); (iii) berm reconstruction and seaward progradation followed by stability (through the spring tide and approaching the neap tide). Cusps occurred twice indicating the reflective nature of the beach. The method used to measure <b>active</b> layer <b>depth</b> {{made it possible to}} discern the contributions of both erosion and accretion to profile changes. Maximum activation layer depths were associated with the zone of wave breaking and berm movement and empirical formulae linking the <b>active</b> layer <b>depth</b> to the wave height have been calculated...|$|R
