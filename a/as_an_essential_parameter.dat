Therefore, biodiversity emerged as an environmental issue in the early 1980 s, culminating in the Conference on Sustainable Development held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.

Many image denoising methods usually require the exact {{value of the}} noise distribution <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> filter <b>parameter.</b> However, to estimate the noise solely from the information of the noisy image is a difficult task. A simple but accurate noise estimator would significantly benefit many image denoising methods. In this paper, we present a method to estimate additive noise by utilizing the mean deviation of a smooth region selected from a noisy image. The noise distribution is estimated by computing the average mean deviation of all non-overlapping blocks in the smooth region. Simulation results demonstrate that our method achieves accurate noise estimation regardless of the image characteristics over a range of noise levels. The restoration performance of a denoising technique based on our noise estimation method resembles that achieved in the ideal condition...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This study {{explores the}} {{applicability}} of vehicle-based laser scanning (VLS) for biomass estimation at individual tree level, since biomass serves <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> biophysical <b>parameter</b> indicating tree health. Previous work suggests that terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) has been primarily validated for biomass prediction, however, in subject to laborious relocation in practice. VLS, <b>as</b> <b>an</b> advanced mode of TLS with more flexible mobility and also high sampling density, can work <b>as</b> <b>a</b> new efficient technique for surveying single trees. Combined with the positive binds between the biomass and TLS-samplings during manual defoliation, this work aims to seek the relations between biomass and VLS-samplings, by correlating the VLS- and TLS-samplings within the same crowns during natural foliation. The resulting R 2 values of the two correlations after normalization are larger than 0. 88 and 0. 61, respectively, and the associated root mean square errors (RMSEs) are less than 0. 051 and 0. 076. VLS, thus, can be validated for estimating biomass at the individual tree level, with the TLS-investigated data <b>as</b> <b>a</b> bridging reference...|$|R
40|$|The {{integrated}} exposure uptake biokinetic (IEUBK) model, {{recommended for}} use by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency at residential Superfund sites to predict potential risks to children from lead exposure and to establish lead remediation levels, requires an interindividual geometric standard deviation (GSDi) <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> input <b>parameter.</b> The GSDi quantifies the variability of blood lead concentrations for children exposed to similar environmental concentrations of lead. Estimates of potential risks are directly related to the GSDi, and therefore the GSDi directly impacts the scope of remediation at Superfund sites. Site-specific GSDi can be calculated for sites where blood lead and environmental lead have been measured. This paper uses data from blood and environmental lead studies conducted at the Bingham Creek and Sandy, Utah, Superfund sites to calculate GSDi using regression modeling, box modeling, and structural equation modeling. GSDis were calculated using various methods for treating values below the analytical method detection and quantitation limits. Treatment of nonquantifiable blood lead concentrations affected the GSDi more than the statistical method used to calculate the GSDi. For any given treatment, the different statistical methods produced similar GSDis. Because of the uncertainties associated with data in the blood lead studies, we recommend that a range of GSDis be used when analyzing site-specific risks associated with exposure to environmental lead instead of a single estimate. Because the different statistical methods produce similar GSDis, we recommend a simple procedure to calculate site-specific GSDi from a scientifically sound blood and environmental lead study...|$|R

Therefore it becomes necessary to adapt the rotor time constant. A simple method based on current measurements alone is proposed. Since this method uses current measurements, which are smoother, compared to the voltage waveforms in a VSI-fed drive, the implementation is easy and noise free. The method also works during transients. The stator direct and quadrature current components are predicted, assuming a perfect value of rotor time constant in the control side. This is compared with the measured currents. A mismatch in this comparison, {{is an indication of}} an error in phase of the rotor flux.

The sensor electrodes are embedded {{into the bottom of}} a supporting rod so that the sensor can measure soil water contents at different depths.

In our present study we employed RR spectroscopy {{to obtain an}} insight into the cooperative binding of oxygen by monitoring the low frequency region of native and modified hemoglobins. The strength of the Fe-His(Nϵ) bonding has been suggested <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> structural <b>parameter</b> that controls the ligand binding properties. Although the Fe-His stretching frequency has been assigned for the deoxy form, the same has not been reported for any ligated forms of Hb. In the low frequency region RR spectra of oxyHb reported here, the H 2 O/D 2 O buffer exchange permitted the assignment of Fe-His stretching frequency to a band around 230 cm- 1. The Fe-O-O bending mode is also identified here in the low frequency region by isotopic substitution studies. Hemoglobin and its isolated subunits were reconstituted with meso and deuterohemes in order to study the effect of heme peripheral substituent modification on heme-protein interaction. Hybrid hemoglobins containing proto/meso and proto/deutero hemes were prepared in the met hybrid form {{as well as in}} the fully reduced form. The native and modified subunits of these hybrids in the deoxy form were selectively probed by using two different excitation lines. The Fe-His stretching frequencies of each subunit were obtained from the spectra. Despite functional differences, the Fe-His stretching frequencies of neither the modified nor the partner subunits were significantly altered from that of native hemoglobin. The inadequacy of two state model to explain the cooperative binding of Hb along with the possibility of a three state model are discussed briefly with reference to our present results, recent RR results, NMR results and molecular energetic calculations. Finally a selective deuteriation study was carried out on deoxy hemoglobins reconstituted with mesoheme to assign the other low frequency modes, which displayed a significant change in the intensity pattern when going from the subunits to the tetramer...|$|R

While IQoS parameters are quantitative and measurement based, QoE estimates are more difficult to obtain as they usually rely on subjective end-user reporting. A new metric for the instantaneous estimation of QoE is proposed, expected Quality of Service (eQoS). This Perceived Quality of Service metric is calculated using IQoS parameters. eQoS estimates the QoE of common real time services for mobile devices (e. g. smartphones, tablets) : Voice of IP via Constant Bit Rate, Audio and Video streaming via Variable Bit Rate. The efficiency of the proposed eQoS metric is evaluated via a realisation of an infrastructure-based wireless network.

Their catalytic performances are evaluated in the cross-metathesis of ethene and trans- 2 -butene {{for the production}} of propene. The catalysts are comprehensively characterized by N 2 -physisorption, ICP-OES, SEM, TEM, XRD, UV–Vis spectroscopy, NH 3 -TPD, NH 3 -chemisorption, XPS, and TPR. Benefiting from the advantage of the aerosol process, the new WO 3 –SiO 2 catalysts display outstanding textural properties, with a high specific surface area (500 – 600 m 2 g− 1) solely generated by calibrated super-micropores of about 2 nm. The catalyst particles are perfectly spherical in shape and feature high W dispersion and appropriate reducibility and surface acidity. As compared to reference catalysts prepared by traditional impregnation on a commercial silica support, the aerosol catalysts exhibit higher metathesis activity and shorter induction period.

However, high injection pressure generates new fractures or reactivates existing faults in the rock mass, triggering seismic activities.

The failure criterion for peak strength could be used in evaluating the generation of new fractures in intact rocks.

Effect of three FRP configurations on the SIF at the crack tip was investigated under the condition of the same amount of FRP laminates. Parameters influencing the SIF were also discussed, including the crack length, the thickness of FRP, the elastic modulus of FRP, the shear modulus of the adhesive, and the thickness of the adhesive.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{highlight}} the technical and economic issues arising in lithium-ion cells for automotive applications, and to indicate some potential solutions to lower the cost. This topic has already been the subject of some studies, but, although of primary importance, the role on cost of a cell design parameter, the electrode coating thickness, has rarely been described. This study intends to explore particularly the influence of this parameter. To do so, the cost of cells with four positive electrode materials (NMC, NCA, LFP, and LMO), and the same negative electrode material are compared at several electrode thickness. The cost of these cells is computed using an innovative model and varies between 230 and 400 $ per kWh. With the assumptions used, it appears that the potential savings resulting from doubling the electrode coating thickness from 50 to 100 lm at a given porosity represent roughly 25 % of the cell cost.

Since {{the first}} descriptions of varicose axons by Cajal and others, the spatial organization of varicosities along axons has {{attracted the attention}} of neuroscientists. Quantitative light- and electron-microscopic analyses of varicosity spacing in the cerebellum and elsewhere have recently provided a clearer picture of this organization, and theoretical analyses now incorporate varicosity spacing <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>parameter</b> in structural models of neural connectivity. Here we review the salient features of varicosity spacing, with emphasis on cerebellar parallel fibers as a model system. Measured globally across the entire approximately 5 mm lengths of parallel fibers, the overall mean spacing of varicosities is 5. 2 microm. Measured locally, however, mean spacing follows a proximodistal gradient, increasing with distance from the point of bifurcation from the ascending axon. Measured at the level of individual varicosities, parallel fiber varicosity distributions follow a distinct pattern characterized by a fixed relationship between the spacing variability and mean. This pattern equally describes varicosity distributions {{in a number of other}} brain regions, and therefore appears to constitute a general scaling relationship for excitatory varicose axons. We further discuss evidence for common principles underlying the placement of both varicosities and synapses along axons...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} is to develop a new method for the evaluation of JT coefficient, <b>as</b> <b>an</b> <b>essential</b> <b>parameter</b> required to account the Joule–Thomson effects while predicting the flowing temperature profile for gas production wells.

The developed correlation and methodology were validated through an exhaustive survey which has been conducted with 20 different gas mixture samples. For each sample, the model has been run for a wide range of temperature and pressure conditions, and the model was rigorously verified by comparison of the results estimated throughout the study with the results obtained from HYSYS and Peng–Robinson equation of state.
