40|$|Objectives: - The cluster {{randomised}} {{trial of}} the Data-driven Quality Improvement in Primary Care (DQIP) intervention showed that education, informatics and financial incentives for general medical practices to review patients with ongoing high-risk prescribing of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antiplatelets reduced the primary end point of high-risk prescribing by 37 %, where both ongoing and new high-risk prescribing were significantly reduced. This quantitative process evaluation examined practice factors associated with (1) participation in the DQIP trial, (2) review activity (extent and nature of documented reviews) and (3) practice level effectiveness (relative reductions in the primary end point). Setting/participants: - Invited practices recruited (n= 33) and not recruited (n= 32) to the DQIP trial in Scotland, UK. Outcome measures: - (1) Characteristics of recruited versus non-recruited practices. Associations of (2) practice characteristics and ‘adoption’ (self-reported implementation work done by practices) with documented review activity and (3) of practice characteristics, DQIP <b>adoption</b> <b>and</b> <b>review</b> activity with effectiveness. Results: - (1) Recruited practices had lower performance in the quality and outcomes framework than those declining participation. (2) Not being an approved general practitioner training practice and higher self-reported adoption {{were significantly associated with}} higher review activity. (3) Effectiveness ranged from a relative increase in high-risk prescribing of 24. 1 % to a relative reduction of 77. 2 %. High-risk prescribing and DQIP adoption (but not documented review activity) were significantly associated with greater effectiveness in the final multivariate model, explaining 64. 0 % of variation in effectiveness. Conclusions: - Intervention implementation and effectiveness of the DQIP intervention varied substantially between practices. Although the DQIP intervention primarily targeted review of ongoing high-risk prescribing, the finding that self-reported DQIP adoption was a stronger predictor of effectiveness than documented review activity supports that reducing initiation and/or re-initiation of high-risk prescribing is key to its effectiveness.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} has been {{to make a contribution}} to knowledge about those processes and phenomena which influence the use of computer-based decision systems by senior managers for their own decision activities. In the course of the thesis, research questions are addressed which relate {{to the nature of the}} role of the directly-accessed computer in the working life of the top manager, and especially to the factors which influence computer <b>adoption</b> <b>and</b> use. A <b>review</b> of relevant literature enabled gaps in existing knowledge about senior managerial computer use to be identified, and indicated the potential value of exploratory research. A programme of interviews was devised and executed which enabled the exploration of the research problem across a sample of senior managers from private and public organizations. It is felt that the methodology of performing intra- and inter-organizational comparisons among computer-exposed managers was fundamental to achieving new insights into managerial behaviours. Following qualitative and qualitative analysis of the research data, a dynamic behavioural model of the computer adoption process in large organizations is proposed together with a description of salient behavioural features at key points in the process. This theoretical model contributes to an understanding of the nature and circumstances of the senior managerial behaviours associated with direct computer use...|$|R

This <b>review</b> of ‘attitude’ information reveals {{a wide range}} of perceptions about what conservation means and what the impacts of adoption will mean in economic and environmental terms. Farmers operate in a tight financial situation, and in parts of the world they are highly dependent on government subsidies, and cannot afford to risk losing that support. Use of conservation practices is most effective when these are understood {{in the context of the}} individual farm, and decisions are rooted in land and resource stewardship and long-term concerns about health of the farm and the soil. The attitudes of farmers entering agri-environmental schemes decide the quality of the result. A model is developed to show how attitudes of the farmer, the farming context and agri-environmental schemes interact and thus influence how the farming community affects nature and biodiversity. As new agri-environmental schemes are planned, agricultural development specialists need to recognize the complexity of farmer attitudes, the importance of location and individual farmer circumstances, and the multiple factors that influence decisions. We provide these insights and the model to conservation biologists conducting research in farming areas, decision makers who develop future agri-environmental schemes, educators training tomorrow’s extension officers and nature conservationists, and researchers dealing with nature conservation issues through a combination of scientific disciplines...|$|R

Many environmental behaviors {{will only be}} effective if they are maintained over the long-term. In the context of climate change and concerns about future water security, behaviors that involve reducing energy consumption and improving water quality must be continued indefinitely to mitigate global warming and preserve scarce resources. Previous reviews of environmental behavior have focused exclusively on factors related to adoption. This review investigates {{the factors that influence}} both <b>adoption</b> <b>and</b> maintenance, and presents a classification of environmental behaviors in terms of the activities, costs, and effort required for both <b>adoption</b> <b>and</b> maintenance. Three categories of behavior are suggested. One-off behaviors involve performing an activity once, such as purchasing an energy efficient washing machine, or signing a petition. Continuous behaviors involve the performance of the same set of behaviors for <b>adoption</b> <b>and</b> for maintenance, such as curbside recycling. Dynamic behaviors involve the performance of different behaviors for <b>adoption</b> <b>and</b> maintenance, such as revegetation. Behaviors can also be classified into four categories related to cost and effort: those that involve little cost <b>and</b> effort for <b>adoption</b> <b>and</b> maintenance, those that involve moderate cost <b>and</b> effort for <b>adoption</b> <b>and</b> maintenance, those that involve a high cost or effort for <b>adoption</b> <b>and</b> less for maintenance, and those that involve less cost or effort for <b>adoption</b> <b>and</b> a higher amount for maintenance.

Despite the criticality of the shortage of IPv 4 addresses, organisations around the world have been slow to adopt IPv 6. While some researchers have examined organisational IPv 6 <b>adoption</b> <b>and</b> assimilation, the literature is dominated by technical studies. In addition, there is little research on the broader issue of the {{adoption of}} digital infrastructure, including IPv 6. The goal {{of this study is to}} better understand the organisational <b>adoption</b> <b>and</b> assimilation of digital infrastructure, by studying the IPv 6 adoption experience. This study focused on identifying the determinants and barriers of organisational IPv 6 <b>adoption</b> <b>and</b> assimilation, and on providing an in-depth understanding of the impact of organisational resources, institutional forces and network externalities across varying stages of organisational <b>adoption</b> <b>and</b> assimilation. To achieve these research aims, a thorough literature <b>review</b> <b>and</b> multiple case studies were used. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 22 informants from sixteen organisations in New Zealand. These organisations were from different industries, of different sizes and were at different stages of IPv 6 adoption. The data collected during the interviews was used to develop through visual maps for each case, and to surface themes across cases. The within-case analysis identified twelve determinants and eleven barriers of organisational IPv 6 adoption, which were then categorised into institutional, organisational and network-specific factors. The data was then used to develop a multi-level model of digital infrastructure <b>adoption,</b> <b>and</b> a stage model of digital infrastructure <b>adoption</b> <b>and</b> assimilation. This study contributes theoretically to our understanding of digital infrastructure <b>adoption</b> <b>and</b> assimilation by explaining how factors internal and external to organisations influence their adoption decisions.
