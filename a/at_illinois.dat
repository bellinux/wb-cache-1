5|$|<b>At</b> <b>Illinois,</b> Corbally {{replaced}} David D. Henry, who stated he was {{stepping down}} {{in favor of}} a younger president with fresh ideas. Almost immediately, Corbally sought to raise capital to fund construction and programs at what was then the ninth-largest university system in the country, especially focusing on the Chicago campus and the school's veterinary medicine and agriculture programs. Corbally enlisted the help of alumni from these programs to raise money for two new buildings on the Urbana-Champaign campus.|$|E

5|$|An {{additional}} three-mile {{section of}} Illinois 22 from Illinois 83 to Milwaukee Avenue, primarily located in Buffalo Grove, was another closely related project {{that was once}} again met with similar delays and concerns. Long Grove got on board in May 2005 and approved any widening between its eastern city limits and Illinois 83. Roadwork began in the fall on the two-year project, and in September 2007 it was finished; complete with four concrete lanes and a center grassy median. Again, intersection improvements were also made, this time adding dual left turn lanes to both east–west approaches <b>at</b> <b>Illinois</b> 83 and Buffalo Grove Road.|$|E

5|$|Christy {{could have}} {{graduated}} in 1940, {{but could not}} then be a teaching assistant, and this would have left him jobless and without income. In 1941, Oppenheimer found him a post at the physics department <b>at</b> <b>Illinois</b> Institute of Technology (IIT). In May 1941, he married Dagmar von Lieven. They had two sons: Thomas Edward (Ted), born in 1944, and Peter Robert, born in 1946. IIT paid Christy $200 per month to teach 27 hours per week for 11 months per annum. To keep abreast of developments in physics, he attended seminars at the University of Chicago. This {{brought him to the}} attention of Eugene Wigner, who hired him for the same money that IIT was paying him as a full-time research assistant, commencing in January 1942.|$|E
5|$|Saban's {{high school}} coach was an Indiana University alumnus and {{convinced}} him to enroll there. Saban played for the Indiana Hoosiers football team starting in 1940. He {{was used as a}} quarterback in 1941, his sophomore year. He also played as a linebacker and a placekicker. Saban was named to the Associated Press All-Big Ten second team as a quarterback in 1942. He was the captain of Indiana's 1942 team and was selected as its most valuable player. Saban was also a standout shot putter, winning a Big Ten Conference competition <b>at</b> <b>Illinois</b> Institute of Technology in 1943 with a throw of 48 feet and 11 1/2 inches.|$|E
5|$|The 2011–12 Wolverines {{began the}} season {{ranked in the}} top 25, and {{remained}} there all season. The team recorded a win over 9th-ranked Michigan State on January 17, 60–59. It was Beilein's third consecutive win over the Spartans and came nine days after Beilein recorded his first victory over Wisconsin, 59–41. On February 18, the Wolverines defeated another top-10 opponent, edging 6th-ranked Ohio State, 56–51. The win clinched Beilein's first winning record in Big Ten play. On March 1, Michigan won <b>at</b> <b>Illinois</b> {{for the first time since}} 1995, ending a 13-game losing streak in Champaign. The Wolverines finished 24–10 overall and 13–5 in Big Ten play, winning a share of the regular-season Big Ten championship for the first time since the 1985–86 team.|$|E

5|$|After graduation, Brundage {{began work}} as a {{construction}} superintendent for the leading architectural firm of Holabird & Roche. In the three years {{he worked for the}} firm, he supervised the construction of $7.5million in buildings—3percent of the total built in Chicago in that time-frame. He disliked the corruption of the Chicago building trades. Brundage's biographer, Allen Guttmann, points out that the young engineer {{was in a position to}} benefit from influence if he had wanted to, as his uncle, Edward J. Brundage, was by then Republican leader of Chicago's North Side and would become Attorney General of Illinois. Brundage had been successful in a number of track and field events while <b>at</b> <b>Illinois.</b> In 1910, as a member of the Chicago Athletic Association (CAA), he finished third in the national all-around championships (an American predecessor of the decathlon), sponsored by the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), and continued training, aiming at the 1912 Olympics in Stockholm.|$|E
5|$|Ebert spent a {{semester}} as a master's {{student in the}} department of English there before attending the University of Cape Town on a Rotary fellowship for a year. He returned from Cape Town to his graduate studies <b>at</b> <b>Illinois</b> for two more semesters and then, after being accepted as a PhD candidate at the University of Chicago, he prepared to move to Chicago. He needed a job to support himself while he worked on his doctorate and so applied to the Chicago Daily News, hoping that, as he had already sold freelance pieces to the Daily News, including an article on the death of writer Brendan Behan, he would be hired by editor Herman Kogan. Instead Kogan referred Ebert to the city editor at the Chicago Sun-Times, Jim Hoge, who hired Ebert as a reporter and feature writer at the Sun-Times in 1966. He attended doctoral classes at the University of Chicago while working as a general reporter at the Sun-Times for a year. After movie critic Eleanor Keane left the Sun-Times in April 1967, editor Robert Zonka gave the job to Ebert. The load of graduate school and being a film critic proved too much, so Ebert left the University of Chicago to focus his energies on film criticism.|$|E
5|$|Stebbins {{research}} {{earned him}} several honors while <b>at</b> <b>Illinois.</b> In 1913 {{he was awarded}} the Rumford Prize of the American Academy of Arts and Science, and in 1915 the Henry Draper Medal of the National Academy of Sciences. The research was also supported by grants from the Draper fund of the National Academy of Sciences and the Rumford Fund of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He served as an officer of the American Astronomical Society {{and was one of the}} American delegates in 1918 to attend the organizational meeting of the International Astronomical Union in Brussels. After numerous discoveries, Stebbins left the University of Illinois in 1922 for the Washburn Observatory in Wisconsin and Dr. Robert H. Baker took over as the new Director of the University of Illinois Observatory. However, because the observatory lost its pioneering researcher in Stebbins did not mean that discovery and science did not continue at the university's observatory.|$|E
