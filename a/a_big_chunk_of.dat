500|$|Brudvig {{praised the}} {{campaign}} for avoiding the [...] "repetitive landscapes and circuitous, difficult to follow plots" [...] of past Halo titles. GameSpot's Chris Watters and others felt the artificial intelligence of friendly non-player characters was less advanced than that of enemies, especially while driving. Steve Boxer wrote for The Guardian that Reachs story made previous entries feel [...] "amateurish"; Nguyen felt that whereas previous Halo titles had become mired in inconsistencies and Star Trek-like technobabble, Reach told a broader and more accessible story. Despite this, he contended, the game suffered from archetypal characters with which players spent little time: [...] "I almost forgot that Noble Four (Emile) even existed for <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>chunk</b> <b>of</b> the campaign, as I rarely saw him." [...] Wireds Gus Mastrapa unfavorably compared Noble Team to the marines of Aliens, writing {{that most of the}} characters were unmemorable and one-dimensional. Nguyen also faulted the game for occasional lapses in exposition, but summed these up as [...] "minor quibbles" [...] compared to the improvements. In contrast, GamesRadar's Charlie Baratt opined that Reachs campaign was better than ODSTs, but lacked the [...] "franchise-changing potential" [...] it promised. Lynch judged that while Bungie still had not learned to create a perfect story, [...] " [...] does expertly set up bombastic scene after scene".|$|E

Obama expressed [...] "extraordinary appreciation and respect {{for the vast majority of}} police officers" [...] and noted the difficult nature of the job. He stated, [...] "When incidents like this occur, there's <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>chunk</b> <b>of</b> our citizenry that feels as if, because of the color of their skin, they are not being treated the same, and that hurts, and that should trouble all of us.

60|$|It was giddy work, but {{not nearly}} so giddy as a rather overnourished reader sitting in a warm room might imagine. Bert found it quite {{possible}} to look down and contemplate the wild sub-arctic landscape below, now devoid of any sign of habitation, a land of rocky cliffs and cascades and broad swirling desolate rivers, and of trees and thickets that grew more stunted and scrubby as the day wore on.

5000|$|One {{strategy}} {{that has been}} developed by curlers {{in response to the}} Free Guard Zone (Kevin Martin from Alberta {{is one of the best}} examples) is the [...] "tick" [...] game, where a shot is made attempting to knock (tick) the guard to the side, far enough that it is difficult or impossible to use but still remaining in play while the shot itself goes out of play. The effect is functionally identical to peeling the guard but significantly harder, as a shot that hits the guard too hard (knocking it out of play) results in its being replaced, while not hitting it hard enough can result in its still being tactically useful for the opposition. There's also a greater chance that the shot will miss the guard entirely because of the greater accuracy required to make the shot. Because of the difficulty of making this type of shot, only the best teams will normally attempt it, and it does not dominate the game the way the peel formerly did. Steve Gould from Manitoba popularized ticks played across the face. These are easier to make because they impart less speed on the object stone, therefore increasing the chance that it remains in play even if <b>a</b> <b>bigger</b> <b>chunk</b> <b>of</b> it is hit.|$|R

Brazed plate units are up to six times smaller than alternative methods of heat exchange with the same capacity.

This design creates two highly turbulent fluid channels that flow in opposite directions over a massive surface area. The result of this construction is a significantly higher heat transfer coefficient with less required surface area and outstanding performance characteristics...|$|R

5000|$|Released in January 1975, Slade in Flame was {{met with}} a mixed response, {{particularly}} from fans who did not expect the band to produce a film with a bleak and sour atmosphere.

Later, the band felt {{that the amount of}} time they were {{out of the public eye}} making the film could have contributed to their chart decline, and that the gritty [...] "reality" [...] of the movie may have done Slade more harm than good. In 1979, Holder recalled: [...] "It just took such <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>chunk</b> out <b>of</b> our career, we didn't tour for a long time, we were not able to record for a long time, or write." [...] In 2007, he added: [...] "The teen audience didn't get it - we half expected that to happen but it was no good us catering for that audience.

5000|$|As their {{domestic}} popularity continued to decline, Terry wanted {{to focus on}} the hard rockers that had done so well for them overseas. Kenny disagreed, wanting a more conservative agenda. Kenny admitted in his book [...] "Making It With Music," [...] that he perhaps shouldn't have complained about MGM's poor distribution on a radio show, but despite their mounting problems, New Zealand continued to consider the First Edition as superstars. The problem was that they had to go halfway around the world to benefit from their success, and travel expenses ate <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>chunk</b> out <b>of</b> their profits. As a thank you they put together an album called [...] "I'm Not Making My Music For Money" [...] especially for their New Zealand fans. An LP of this title was to have come out in the USA but MGM rejected it. The US LP was basically {{going to be the same}} but with two new cuts replacing the two songs reused from [...] "Monumental." [...] Despite the retreads, the album did show continued development. A mix of new songs and remakes (possibly done because some songs were not available in New Zealand), [...] "Love Woman" [...] was now a hard rock jam featuring Jimmy on lead. This arrangement was borrowed from the band's stage performances of Bill Haley's [...] "Rockin' Through The Rye". The ballads [...] "Dirty Work" [...] and [...] "Daddy Was A Traveling Man" [...] were a return to the more adult style of Terry's early work. [...] "Making Music For Money" [...] (another song remade for [...] "The Gambler") is a song about art vs. commerce that Jimmy Buffett later covered. This semi-comical goodbye to the music rat race also served as the band's ironic last single. It too charted well, but again only in New Zealand.|$|R
