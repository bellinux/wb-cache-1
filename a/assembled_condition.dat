40|$|In this study, the {{termination}} finish of Small Output Integrated Circuit (SOIC) chip components were converted from Pb-free to Sn-Pb (backward conversion) and from Sn-Pb to Pb-free (forward conversion). The motivation for these conversions {{is due to}} a combination of factors such as the supply chain constraints on component availability and European Union’s (EU) legislation on “Restriction of Hazardous Substances ” (or RoHS). Additionally, components with 100 % matte tin finish were converted to Pb-free Sn- 3. 5 %Ag- 0. 5 %Cu (SAC 305) finish. This type of conversion would be necessary to avoid tin whiskers issue on matte tin finish components. The conversions were performed using a “Robotic Stripping and Solder Dipping Process”. After conversion, the parts were examined using x-ray fluorescence (XRF) to verify for RoHS compliance. Electrical and die visual investigation utilizing optical microscopy, DC pin to pin electrical testing and acid de-encapsulation were performed on one of the converted component (MC 14111 DW) to inspect for damage on die, after the conversion process. There were no opens or short circuits found during the electrical test. The die was undamaged after the conversion process. As the final evaluation method, the converted parts were assembled on an actual PCB using both tin-lead and lead-free process. Three Printed Circuit Board (PCB) surface finishes namely Immersion Silver (ImAg), Organic 1 Solderable Preservative (OSP), and Electroless Nickel/Immersion Gold (ENIG) were evaluated. The microstructures of the converted components were normal in appearance and had well defined IMC both along the board and component interface. After microstructure analysis, lead pull testing was performed at ‘as <b>assembled</b> <b>condition</b> ’ (AA) and ‘after thermal aging ’ (ATA) to determine the mechanical reliability of converted component termination finishes with respect to the original termination finish.

40|$|Downloaded Fsolid {{ferritic}} flanges have cracked purely due to overload; and {{stainless steel}} overlay ferritic flanges have cracked possibly due {{to a combination of}} mechanisms. The stainless steel overlay flanges may be more prone to cracking than solid ferritic flanges due to crack initiation by Cl SCC of the overlay and differential thermal expansion and residual stresses between the stainless steel overlay and the ferritic base metal. Nonetheless, a major factor in crack initiation for all of these cases is the high localized stress at the corners of the ring groove. It has been well documented that the configuration of standard RTJ flanges does not include sufficient radii {{at the base of the}} ring groove to effectively reduce the local-ized peak stresses. Note that the ASME B 16. 5 standard permitted a very sharp corner of essentially zero radius until a recent ad-denda which includes the requirement for larger radii, which should help mitigate cracking, but probably not eliminate it. During routine inspection of a 2 - 1 / 4 Cr- 1 Mo hydrogen process-ing reactor vessel in a petroleum refinery, cracking was identified in the ring joint flange of the inlet nozzle. The cracking was de-tected while the flange connection was in the <b>assembled</b> <b>condition</b> using a new angle beam UT technique. The cracks encompassed approximately 180 deg of circumference and were located at both the inner and outer radius of the flange ring joint groove. The crack depth was 1. 0 in. ~ 25. 4 mm! on the innermost radius of the depths located at the base of the ring joint groove to evaluate the change in the crack tip driving force.

Space manipulators with torque sensors can not only apply force control approach to more precise and more dexterous space missions, but also monitor the occurrence of unpredicted events as accidental impacts with objects they have to manipulate. At present, most of the compact torque sensors, designed without consideration of space environment, cannot be directly used in space applications.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} the paper is to {{accomplish}} the analysis of a transmission shaft belonging to a longitudinal gearbox {{in order to reduce}} the axial clearances of the parts assembled on the shaft. The paper demonstrates also that the study of assembly conditions allows simplifying the analysis and the evaluation of different dimensioning schemes. Method - A previous functional approach to optimal dimensioning is used but it is associated to the analysis of relationships between the parts assembled on the shaft, the corresponding functional surfaces and the related dimensioning schemes. Then, a statistical analysis of tolerance chain is accomplished by using different IT grades that characterize dimensional tolerances. Result - The optimal functional dimensioning scheme of an automotive transmission shaft is accomplished. The scheme is able to guarantee the minimum axial clearances of parts assembled on the shaft. Discussion & Conclusion - The paper deals with the application of a functional approach to the optimal dimensioning of an automotive transmission shaft. The automotive transmission set is characterized by different working conditions, geometrical constraints and design parameters. Therefore, a preliminary decomposition of the assembly in several subsystems or groups is necessary to clearly analyse the longitudinal gearbox. Then, the study of <b>assembling</b> <b>conditions</b> and related functional surfaces allow simplifying the evaluation of different dimensioning schemes. In fact, the functional approach, aimed to optimal dimensioning, uses a worst-case and statistical analyses to directly check the axial clearances of the wheels assembled on the shaft. Therefore, the effects of dimensioning are directly evaluated in terms of performances of the transmission. Therefore, the different dimensioning schemes are evaluated through the functional approach, as the optimal scheme is able to guarantee the whole set of functional requirements of the shaft...|$|R

Layer-by-layer (LbL) assembly is a simple yet powerful bottom-up fabrication technique, which allows assembly of thin films with designed microstructure under ambient conditions. These multilayer thin films have many desirable properties: mechanical flexibility, transparency, and impermeability. This dissertation sought to further improve the processing and properties of high gas barrier thin films produced using LbL assembly. The influence of deposition time on gas barrier of polymer/clay multilayer thin films composed of polyethylenimine (PEI), poly(acrylic acid) (PAA), and clay was investigated. Multilple PEI/PAA bilayers (BL) were deposited between clay layers to construct multilayer assemblies with quadlayer (QL), hexalayer (HL), and octalayer (OL) sequences. Regardless of film structure, polymer/clay multilayer thin films prepared using shorter dipping time were thicker and exhibited better gas barrier than samples prepared using longer dipping time {{in the first few}} layers. This seemingly counterintuitive result was explained by considering desorption of previously deposited polymers between clay layers. Reduced deposition time helped to retain more polymer between clay sheets, leading to larger clay spacing and better gas barrier. In an effort to expand the applications and improve the throughput of layer-by-layer assembly, spray-assisted deposition of PEI/PAA bilayers was investigated. The influences of spraying time, spraying pressure, and flow rate on thickness, roughness, and gas barrier were evaluated. Spraying time was determined {{to be the most important}} parameter. A 7 -bilayer PEI/PAA thin film assembled using optimized spraying parameters exhibited better gas barrier than a dip-coated multilayer prepared using the same deposition time for each layer. These findings pave the way for using the LbL technique commercially, where fast and continuous deposition of high performance thin films on large substrates is needed. Finally, the first example of super stretchy gas barrier was developed by combining polyacrylic acid and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO). Oxygen transmission rate (OTR) of 1. 58 mm thick natural rubber was reduced by an order of magnitude after deposition of a 20 BL PAA/PEO assembly. More importantly, no cracking was observed on the PAA/PEO coating after 100 % strain. A 5 X improvement in gas barrier was retained after this extreme stretching. Additionally, the effect of <b>assembling</b> <b>condition</b> on the permeability of PAA/PEO multilayer thin films was investigated. By setting the assembling pH at 2. 75, the negative impacts of PAA ionization and COOH dimer formation could be minimized, leading to a 50 % reduction in oxygen permeability. This unique combination of elasticity and gas barrier makes the PAA/PEO assembly an ideal candidate for improving the barrier of elastomeric materials...|$|R
