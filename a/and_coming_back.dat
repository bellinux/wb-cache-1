25|$|Paul Langevin and von Laue {{showed that}} the twin paradox can be {{completely}} resolved by consideration of acceleration in special relativity. If two twins move away from each other, {{and one of them}} is accelerating <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> to the other, then the accelerated twin is younger than the other one, since he was located in at least two inertial frames of reference, and therefore his assessment of which events are simultaneous changed during the acceleration. For the other twin nothing changes since he remained in a single frame.|$|E

They act aggressively to other females that come close to their pups, as well as alien pups that try to get milk from them. Pups first enter the water at about four weeks and are weaned at about 12 months. This is normally when the mother gives birth to a new pup. Pups gradually {{spend more time in}} the nearshore surf and develop swimming skills.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan {{levelled}} {{the series}} after their wicket-keeper Kamran Akmal hit his second ODI century - indeed, his second score above 50. However, it was Shoaib Akhtar who became Man of the Match, after removing Marcus Trescothick and Andrew Strauss {{in the same}} over <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> to take three more wickets while bowling. England had won the toss and batted first, and after an opening stand of 30 between Trescothick and Matt Prior Shoaib took two wickets in an over. Another stand of 44 took England to 74 after 13 overs, but Rana Naved-ul-Hasan repeated Shoaib's feat, and a full ball from Abdul Razzaq took care of Prior for 32.|$|E

500|$|The {{major themes}} of Spirited Away {{center on the}} protagonist Chihiro and her liminal journey through the realm of spirits. The archetypal {{entrance}} into another world demarcates Chihiro's status as one somewhere between child and adult. Chihiro also stands outside societal boundaries in the supernatural setting. The {{use of the word}} kamikakushi (literally [...] "hidden by gods") within the Japanese title, and its associated folklore, reinforces this liminal passage: [...] "Kamikakushi is a verdict of 'social death' in this world, <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> to this world from Kamikakushi meant 'social resurrection.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Rocky Horror {{is one of}} {{the last}} few western rites left that pertain to the carnivalesque. Annual Rocky Horror {{conventions}} are held in varying locations lasting days. Tucson, Arizona has been host a number of times, including 1999 with [...] "El Fishnet Fiesta", and [...] "Queens of the Desert" [...] held in 2006. Vera Dika wrote that to the fans, Rocky Horror is ritualistic and comparable to a religious event, with a compulsive, repeated cycle of going home <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> to see the film each weekend. The audience call backs are similar to responses in church during a mass. Many theatre troupes exist across the United States that produce shadow-cast performances where the actors play each part in the film in full costume and props as the movie plays on the big screen in a movie theatre. These showings are typically once a week or once a month on a Saturday at midnight.|$|E

500|$|In June 2011, Julian re-joined {{his former}} club, now renamed simply Stevenage, on a free transfer, {{three years after}} leaving the club. The move meant that Julian would be playing under the {{management}} of Graham Westley once more, who first brought Julian to Stevenage in 2005 – Westley said [...] "Alan sees the opportunity {{in the long term}} and we all know how much quality he will bring into the squad. He is a different type of character but another man that you would happily go into the trenches with". On signing for Stevenage, Julian said [...] "I had a great time at Stevenage before <b>and</b> <b>coming</b> <b>back</b> now and we are in League One, it is a dream come true". As a result of Chris Day dislocating his finger, Julian started in the club's first game of the 2011–12 campaign, keeping a clean sheet in Stevenage's 0–0 home draw against Exeter City. He played the first three games of the season, before first choice goalkeeper Chris Day returned from injury. Julian made just two further appearances during the campaign; in a 2–2 draw with AFC Wimbledon in the Football League Trophy, and an appearance as a second-half substitute in Stevenage's 2–2 home draw against Huddersfield Town.
