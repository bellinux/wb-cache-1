40|$|AbstractSet {{within the}} context of New Institutionalism, this article {{analyzes}} the impact of institutional change on Russian agriculture. Institutions are important because they create opportunity and incentives. The market-based institutional framework introduced in the 1990 s acted as an independent variable that facilitated growth in <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>income</b> and an increase in rural stratification. Further, institutions contributed to land expansion by a stratum of upper income households. As a dependent variable, indigenous factors influence the economic outcomes that flow from new institutions with a twofold effect: regional variance is significant for <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>income</b> and land expansion; and some households experienced much higher <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>income</b> and land expansion...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{employs a}} {{decomposition}} analysis of inequality by income source {{to understand and}} explain particular aspects of income inequality in Greece. The results suggest that <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>income</b> {{is the most significant}} contributor to overall inequality in Greece. It is also shown that there is a weak redistributive impact of taxes and social security contributions and this is mainly attributed to tax evasion, particularly in <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>income.</b> The decrease of the inequality of <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>income</b> appears to be the most effective way of reducing total inequality. Overall this analysis may help to establish links between the functional and personal income distribution. Therefore, our ability to evaluate and predict the potential implications of particular growth policies to inequality, poverty and, consequently, to social development, is significantly improved.

40|$|Education is a {{well-known}} driver of (<b>entrepreneurial)</b> <b>income.</b> The measurement of its influence, however, suffers from endogeneity suspicion. For instance, ability and occupational choice are mentioned as driving both the level of (<b>entrepreneurial)</b> <b>income</b> and of education. Using instrumental variables can provide a way out. However, three questions remain: whether endogeneity is really present, whether it matters and whether the selected instruments make sense. Using Bayesian methods, {{we find that the}} relationship between education and <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>income</b> is indeed endogenous and that the impact of endogeneity on the estimated relationship between education and income is sizeable. We do so using family background variables and show that relaxing the strict validity assumption of these instruments does not lead to strongly different results. This is an important finding because family background variables are generally strongly correlated with education and are available in most datasets. Our approach is applicable beyond the field of returns to education for income. It applies wherever endogeneity suspicion arises and the three questions become relevant.

In both transition economies and existing West European market economies, the efficient taxation of <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>incomes</b> presents particular difficulties, {{partly due to the}} absence of clearly defined `borderlines', for example between labour and capital incomes, and between business expenses and private consumption. The treatment of income volatility, of social insurance contributions, and of inheritance by the tax system can easily have a non-neutral impact on the balance between entrepreneurial investment and other investments. The paper considers how these problems could be addressed, and outlines a number of issues specific to the taxation of entrepreneurs in transition economies.

We answer three questions: (1) To what extent does a composite measure of ability affect an entrepreneur's earnings relative to employees? (2) Do different cognitive abilities (e. g. math ability, language ability) and social ability affect earnings of entrepreneurs and employees differently?, and (3) Does the balance in these measured ability levels affect an individual's earnings? Our individual fixed-effects estimates of the differential returns to ability for spells in entrepreneurship versus wage employment account for selectivity into entrepreneurial positions as determined by fixed individual characteristics. General ability has a stronger impact on <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>incomes</b> than on wages. Entrepreneurs and employees benefit from different sets of specific abilities: Language and clerical abilities have a stronger impact on wages, whereas mathematical, social and technical ability affect <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>incomes</b> more strongly.

40|$|Supporters {{claim that}} {{entrepreneurship}} {{is critical to}} building and sustaining the regional economies of {{urban and rural areas}} across the nation. Proponents argue that economic development practices that enhance and support entrepreneurship are essential because they cultivate innovation which, in turn, creates new jobs, new wealth, and a better quality of life. However, South Carolina’s real self-employed per capita income has decreased over the last decade. This downward trend highlights the need to examine the drivers of <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>income.</b> The income of self-employed workers, as opposed to the number of self-employed, is critical to economic development because a major goal of economic policy is to increase incomes not just employment. Identifying and quantifying the personal, cultural, and economic factors that influence self-employed income provides policy makers with another tool to enhance economic development policies. This study uses data from the American Community Survey for South Carolina in both an ordinary regression approach and a quantile regression approach to investigate the relationship between individual <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>income</b> and individual personal attributes, social/institutional assets available to the entrepreneur, and the regional economic environment the entrepreneur operates within.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of jointly {{incorporating}} liquidity risk and non-tradeable wealth in a single asset pricing equation. First, I propose an overlapping-generations model with random endowment shocks and liquidity risk, evaluating their joint impact on expected returns. The model presents a single-factor asset pricing equation, with a new term capturing the covariance between assets' liquidities and non-tradeable wealth. In this economy, assets with higher liquidity or returns when non-tradeable wealth is low command lower expected returns. Second, I investigate whether risks associated with liquidity are priced after including non-tradeable wealth due to <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>income.</b> I test the model on equally weighted and value-weighted portfolios, sorted by illiquidity levels, illiquidity variation and size, using US stock data from January 1962 to December 2004. The extra terms due to <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>income</b> reduce liquidity risk premium by almost 40 %, with an impact of - 0. 45 % per year on expected returns of value-weighted illiquidity-sorted portfolios. Overall, liquidity risk {{as a whole has}} a yearly premium equal to 1. 06 %. However, liquidity levels are much more important and have a premium of 6. 14 % per year, contributing to most of the explanatory gains of the model.

40|$|The report {{surveys the}} {{incentive}} effects of taxes on capital and <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>income</b> {{in light of}} the research in the field. The cash flow tax, the ACE tax and the tax on distributed profits of mature firms are known to be neutral with respect to the investment decisions. It is not widely understood that they are not neutral with respect to the entry decisions of start-up firms. The idea of creating tax incentives represents a departure from the neutrality principle. The entrepreneurial risk does not as such justify an investment incentive but an asymmetric tax treatment of it does. The Nordic dual income tax encourages the start-up investment of an entrepreneur who is expecting relatively high profitability. However, when setting the share of <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>income</b> to be taxed as capital income, the failure risk matters. The empirical studies on the relation between the income tax rates and entrepreneurship point due to the tax avoidance motive to a positive relationship, though only at high tax rates. When judging the tax incentives on R&D spending, the strategic behavior between firms becomes relevant to be analyzed. Underinvestment or overinvestment are both potential outcomes. The entry barriers reduce in principle the validity of a tax policy based on the idea of tax neutrality. entrepreneurship, taxation, tax incentives...|$|R

30|$|The key {{independent}} variable {{of this research}} is economic capital, referring to the private enterprise’s bargaining power with the local government derived from its economic contribution to local economic development. This can be measured by <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>income,</b> annual sales, and annual investments. We used the total amount of tax payment in 2005 for two reasons. First, from the perspective of fiscal sociology, tax is definitely the key mechanism that configures the state-business relationship (Zhang 2017). Second, compared to annual sales and investments, tax amount directly measures the specific contribution of one enterprise to the local fiscal revenue, and thus reflects the bargaining power more precisely. To reduce the fluctuation of variance, we took the natural logarithm of the tax amount in 2005 (Bland et al. 2013).|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} certain {{dimensions of}} inequality in Greece {{that have not}} or have only partially been explored so far, utilising the micro-data of a survey carried out in 1988 by the National Centre for Social Research. Reviewed were relevant studies conducted in the past, and evaluated were the available statistical data and information. Certain theoretical and methodological issues that one encounters when analysing and measuring inequality were also discussed. Initially, an analysis by income source was employed, which provided valuable information on the structure and profile of income inequality in Greece. The decomposition analysis by income components showed that <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>income</b> {{is the most significant}} contributor to overall inequality in Greece, {{despite the fact that it}} represents a relatively small fraction of household income. Income taxes and social security contribution appeared to have a very weak distributional impact on overall inequality. This impact was explored further by employing regression analysis. It was found that the share of income tax and contributions is mainly related to wages and salaries. The most effective way to maximise their distributional impact is by eliminating tax evasion among the recipients of <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>income.</b> The average household income was found to be greatly affected by certain population characteristics, and inequality appeared to vary substantially between population subgroups. The decomposition analysis showed that in all the population groups used, inequality between groups accounted for only a very small segment of the overall inequality. Finally, the hypothesis that, in Greece, the family background is a significant factor in determining the offspring's socio-economic status was tested. A loglinear analysis was used in order to uncover all the potentially complex relationship among the variables employed. These results suggested that people face unequal opportunities for education and unequal probabilities of falling below the poverty line due to their family background...|$|R

Since equity funds are typically diversified at the national or international level, we use data on equity fund ownership to proxy for regional home bias. Cross-regional patterns of equity fund ownership are qualitatively consistent with simple portfolio theory: regions with more asymmetric business cycles are more diversified because they have higher fund participation rates (the extensive margin of diversification) and higher average holdings of equity funds (diversification’s intensive margin). Also, fund holdings increase with the exposure of non-tradable income components (such as labor or <b>entrepreneurial</b> <b>income)</b> to regional shocks. Finally, interregional consumption risk sharing increases with fund holdings and this effect seems strongest when participation is widespread.

To evaluate the empirical importance of market incompleteness, {{it is essential to}} determine whether idiosyncratic shocks are important for the wealthy who have access to better insurance opportunities, but also face different risks, than the average household. We study a model where each period households decide whether to participate in the stock market by paying a fixed cost.
