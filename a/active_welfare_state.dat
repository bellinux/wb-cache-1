40|$|This article {{explores the}} new roles of {{frontline}} workers in Dutch local welfare agencies {{against the background}} of recent <b>active</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> reforms, with a specific focus on frontline workers involved in activating social assistance recipients. The results presented in the article come from case studies in four local welfare agencies. The article investigates how <b>active</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> reforms have influenced the room for discretion of frontline workers, how discretion is managed in local welfare agencies, and how frontline workers cope with discretion. The article argues that the discretion of activation by frontline workers has increased significantly. The research results show a clear though not unambiguous shift from a bureaucratic towards a more professional treatment of frontline workers, combined with attempts to introduce a more performance oriented style of management. However, given the low level of institutionalisation of the profession of activation work, activation frontline workers still seem to be professionals without a profession. This not only makes activation work a rather individual project, it also entails risks for clients for whom activation services may become unpredictable and lacking in transparency...|$|E
40|$|Published online: 04 July 2012 This article {{contributes}} to the literatures on the governance of activation and the territorial structure of the <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> by drawing attention to the institutional designs of <b>active</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> and the architectures of decentralisation, {{as well as to}} their manifestations and implications. With the end of capturing dissimilar intergovernmental models of activation, this paper develops a framework of ‘centre–regional’ relations, which we apply to the cases of Italy and Spain – two countries that have devolved active labour market policy powers to their regions but have organised power-sharing structures very differently. The findings suggest {{that when it comes to}} <b>active</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>states,</b> horizontal arrangements are linked to salient institutional variations across the territory. By contrast, hierarchical structures, which are characterised by a dominant role of central level governments, are linked to higher levels of cohesion. These findings are relevant as they expose the manifestations and implications of distinct decentralisation models on activation regimes, <b>welfare</b> <b>states,</b> as well as on welfare clients...|$|R

40|$|The {{wind of the}} <b>active</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> {{is blowing}} {{throughout}} the entire post-industrial world: {{in the field of}} social protection, the emphasis is shifting away from ‘compensating for loss of income ’ (through replacement incomes) towards preventing or repairing that loss (by means of an active labour market policy). Resources are being channelled from one budget to the other (activation of benefits); and entitlements to replacement incomes are increasingly being linked to participation in integration programmes. This article analyses a number of national examples of this change in approach and outlines the underlying trends on which the activation policy is based. Our perspective is that of the disadvantaged groups on the labour market: the long-term unemployed and welfare clients. The <b>active</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> is underpinned by multiple philosophies. From an anti-poverty policy perspective, however, the existing international examples can be positioned along an axis, with the workfare approach and the social inclusion approach as the two opposing ‘poles’.

Depending on the aspect under consideration, examples will be cited from various national programmes, though in the realisation that those programmes cannot b...|$|E

40|$|Aim: This study aims at {{highlighting}} issues {{arising from}} {{the implementation of the}} Lisbon Strategy, which {{in the context of the}} European Social Model aims at strenghtening Europe’s role in the global economic system. In this context the role of the <b>active</b> and dynamic <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> to achieve the above objectives is commented. Method: To identify the relevant literature, electronic databases such as Science Direct have been used, as well as European Union databases (Scadplus, Eur-Lex, and Europe Direct). Results: Europe is the only part of the world where social justice and competitiveness are treated as mutually achievable objectives and not as mutually exclusive. This is done under the European Social Model (ESM), which however has received strong criticism and has been implicated several times in the high deficits in Europe. The Lisbon Strategy aims to strengthen the role of Europe in the global economic system; however this is done in the context of the ESM. Although the Lisbon objectives were not achieved and the Strategy has been revised, the ESM is still relevant, particularly under the weight of the global economic crisis. The answer to today’s challenges is the enhancement of the role of the <b>active</b> and dynamic <b>welfare</b> <b>state,</b> rather than unconditionally surrender to the market forces which have accumulated the current dead-ends...|$|R

Such a reform is linked to the idea of an <b>active</b> and enabling <b>welfare</b> <b>state.</b> For these reasons, LLL stands in the middle of those activation policies that are focused on empowerment. However it is not enough to guarantee the subjective right to learn lifelong: it is necessary to ensure everyone has the capability to enact that right. This paper goes deep into these issues, moving in the perspective of the capability approach. This approach leads us to see LLL as a crucial factor to convert individual resources into functionings. This means acknowledging the link between human capital and human capability. It also means giving a central role to the learning to learn competence and to the construction of a “learnfare system” truly capable of making LLL a factor of social protection and active citizenship...|$|R

Our findings suggest that although increasing public expenditure, the reform largely repays its cost by reducing involuntary unemployment, increasing labor supply and private consumption and thus improves GDP and the deficit/GDP ratio. If the great recession did not occur, poverty and inequality would have been significantly reduced by the RSA reform.|$|E

40|$|The {{paradigm}} of <b>active</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state,</b> if not properly contextualized, leads to some unsolvable problems. The first is considering employment {{as a key}} {{issue of the new}} welfare: access to employment may be considered an opportunity and not a right, but only if that opportunity is actual. Besides, the aim of employability is not a feasible proposition within a purely functional scheme as not only employment but “good employment” is needed. The second problem springs from the importance given to lifelong learning and education as protection/resource for employability. Education is not equally distributed. It is influenced by normative, organizational, financial and contractual factors between employees as well as by individual will, that is directly linked to the educational level. Thus there is a clear need for activation policies that put together employment, training, welfare, civil and political participation in order to make room for a greater involvement and responsibleness of individuals and families, according to the changes that take place in life courses...|$|E
40|$|Can {{a growing}} <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> induce a regime switch {{in the growth}} rate of an economy? This paper {{constructs}} a dynamic political economy model of economic growth and the <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> in which both variables are non-linearly related and jointly endogenous. Using a Markov switching framework over the period 1950 - 2001, we find that the structural decline in growth rates that several <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> economies experienced during 1970 - 1975 are preceded by movements to a high <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> regime. This suggests that expanding <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> regimes are associated with low economic growth regimes, while contracting <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> regimes are associated with high growth regimes. However, we also find that the structural decline in growth rates leads to a downward structural break in the <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> for many <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> economies. This suggests that declining growth regimes are associated with contracting <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> regimes, as lower growth forces politicians to cut the size of the <b>welfare</b> <b>state.</b> We also report strong evidence that both expansion and contractions in the <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> affects growth non-linearly.

40|$|This thesis has two aims. The first {{aim is to}} set out an {{argument}} for social insurance {{in the form of}} compulsory income insurance in the event of sickness or unemployment, and to explore two lines of arguments for social insurance policies that are commonly associated with an <b>active</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> that seeks to prevent or reduce reliance on social insurance. The second aim is to outline and defend an account of legitimacy that takes moral autonomy seriously by making legitimacy partly dependent on our entrenched values and preferences. The first aim is relevant for articles I-VI. In article I it is argued that the extent to which behavioural responses to social insurance is seen as ethically problematic, it is primarily a problem that concerns the institution rather than the morality of the individual whose behaviour is influenced by social insurance. Thus, insofar as behavioural responses to social insurance are an ethical problem, it is a problem for political philosophy rather than individual ethics. In article II {{an argument}} for social insurance in the form of compulsory income insurance in the event of sickness or unemployment is presented, viz. the argument from autonomy. It is based on a concern for the protection of our identity according to what is called a “thick” conception of the person, which holds that our identities as separate persons are constituted by our central aims and commitments. It is also argued that contrary to what has been claimed by its opponents; social insurance needs not lead to the bad risks exploiting the good risks, or be head-on in conflict with individual freedom. Article III identifies normative issues that deserve attention in relation to in relation to a general introduction of prevention policies in social insurance and market insurance. It is argued that the importance of these issues suggests that arguments and distinctions drawn from moral and political philosophy should play a more prominent role both in the debate on the shift towards an <b>active</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> and the use of prevention policies in market insurance. Article IV is a response to comments from Professor David Buchanan initiated by article III. Article V explores what is called the argument from autonomy for reduced compensation rates in social insurance or making compensation from such insurance conditional on different kinds of requirements such as participation in rehabilitation or vocational training. It is argued that such policies are justified if they tend to ensure an adequate level of autonomy, where autonomy is understood {{in the sense of a}} “thick” conception of personal autonomy based on Norman Daniel’s extension of the principle of fair equality of opportunity. Article VI discusses the objection that arguments pertaining to the principle of fairness often are irrelevant since the principle of fairness is based on the acceptance of the relevant benefits. It is argued that this objection from non-acceptance fails because we can – and do – accept the benefits form such institutions on a practical level and this is enough to ground obligations pertaining fairness. The implications of this argument for policies associated with the <b>active</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> are explored, taking a reform of the Swedish sickness insurance as an example. The second aim is relevant for article VII. In article VII it is argued that an account of legitimacy should satisfy three conditions. The justification thesis and the legitimacy thesis are presented as accounts of justification and legitimacy respectively. It is argued that the proposed accounts satisfy these conditions. An account of political obligations is also given.   QC 20150121 </p...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has documented the associations between parenting and parenting styles and {{child and adolescent}} outcomes. Little is known, however, about the social structuring of parenting in contemporary Nordic welfare states. A possible hypothesis is that socioeconomic variations in parenting styles in present-day Norway will be small because of material affluence, limited income inequality, and an <b>active</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state.</b> This study examines social variations in parenting as perceived by Norwegian adolescents (N[*]=[*] 1362), {{with a focus on}} four parenting style dimensions: responsiveness, demandingness, neglecting, and intrusive. Responsiveness seems to capture major divisions in parenting. Adolescents in families with fewer economic resources experienced their parents as somewhat less responsive, but responsiveness was not related to parents’ education. Low parental education was on the other hand associated with perceptions of parents as neglecting and intrusive. Viewing parents as demanding did neither vary with parental education nor with family economy. Substantial variations in parenting styles persist in present-day Norway, and these variations correspond moderately with the families’ placement in the social structure. Indicators of parenting and parenting styles may be useful indicators of some aspects of child and adolescent well-being...|$|E

Reasons for this evolution can be {{the increase}}d labour market participation of women, the ageing of the population to name a few.

40|$|Active {{labour market}} {{policy and the}} {{reduction}} of poverty in the ‘new ’ Scotland Throughout Europe there is a view that social policy objectives {{can and should be}} achieved via the route of increased work participation. This is often fuelled by government assumptions that simultaneous progress on the employment and poverty front can be achieved. Employment activation and poverty reduction are central to the so-called <b>active</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> that {{lies at the heart of}} New Labour policies. In this article the relationship between devolution (another of New Labour’s central policies) and active labour market policies is analysed. In particular a discussion of the decentralization of powers relating to employment is undertaken alongside an assessment of whether the ‘social policy ’ focus of the devolved Scotland results in an effective integration of employ-ment and poverty reduction policies. Key words: labour activation, social inequality and devolution, welfare reform Work participation and new governance Activation policies and active labour market policy have become key issues in discussions of citizenship in the UK and Europe. They have a central place in thinking about the transformation of welfare. The reasons for this are twofold. Firstly, a move in thinking involving a redefinition of the rights and responsibilities of the individual citizen and state in relation to work. Secondly, and in contrast to the United States, active labour market policy has been claimed to be a major but not sole way of tackling poverty, based on evidence that the associa-tion between worklessness and poverty amongst working age adults i...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} <b>active</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> (Hanesch 2001, Kazepov 2002, van Berkel 2003) {{represents}} {{an attempt to}} describe the recursive transformations of socio-economic phenomena and the policies that try to deal them. In particular, it depicts the changing scenario by means of these aspects (van Berkel 2003 : 1) : {{the emergence of new}} risks and social problems, new ways of perceiving them, new ways of dealing with risks and social problems, and the redefinition of the social responsibilities of actors in producing and dealing with risks and social problems (fig. 1). The interaction between these dimensions of change produces particular combinations that kindle very different policy models and practices. The paper try to sketch a theoretical approach, looking at the change strategies promoted and legitimated by different activation policies, particularly highlighting how the modes of construction of knowledge affect the underlying nature of activation daily practices, transversally to specific measures and governance processes. The object is to comprehend which conditions allow to promote inclusion and citizenship, and in turn making more effective local governance and welfare intervention. The main questions are: which learning processes are present {{as a result of the}} welfare system? How these processes are connected to the organisational dynamics? The attempt to answer these, is based on a classification of policies by means of the logical categories of learning (Bateson 1972) and of a combined typology of change strategies.

This analysis confirms the existence of three types of <b>welfare</b> <b>state,</b> viz. the liberal <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> (USA, Australia, United Kingdom and Canada), the social-democratic <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> (Sweden, Denmark, Norway) and the corporatist <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> (Germany, Belgium, France). The Netherlands, however, {{turns out to be a}} hybrid kind of <b>welfare</b> <b>state,</b> somewhere in between the social democratic and the corporatist <b>welfare</b> <b>states.</b> Next, we examine whether these three types of <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> correspond to a threefold classification in terms of the traditional protective functions of the <b>welfare</b> <b>state.</b> By using LIS-data from the first half of the 1990 s we compare eleven <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> with respect to the degree of income leveling by the social security and tax system, the rate of inequality of disposable household incomes, the level of social welfare (interpreted as a combination of income level and income equality) and the poverty rate. We find that there is indeed a clear dividing line between the liberal <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> on the one hand and the social-democratic and corporatist <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> on the other. The liberal <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> perform consistently worse on the indicators for income leveling, income (in) equality and poverty, but not with respect to the level of social welfare. There is however no consistent difference in performance between the social-democratic countries and the corporatist countries. There rather seems to be a combined group of continental European countries, existing of both social-democratic and corporatist <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> and the hybrid Netherlands, that achieve roughly comparable results in terms of income protection by using quite different institutions. Hence, although there are indeed three types of <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> as far as institutional arrangements are concerned, it is better to discern only two types of <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> with respect to income (re) distribution, social welfare en poverty...|$|R

Instead, a process of restructuring is unfolding in response to globalization, European integration and internal pressures. However, the question remains whether <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> reform has led to convergence on the European scene. This article discusses the new literature on convergence and divergence from a Nordic perspective, and gives an account of how reforms affected the patterning of European <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> towards the late- 1990 s. The {{article is based on}} key findings from a large empirical research project comparing <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> adjustment and its consequences in several dimensions among Western European <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> over the past two decades. It concludes that <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> change has led to convergence in some areas, but above all, it has been characterized by parallel trends that can be identified in different <b>welfare</b> <b>states.</b> Such parallel trends in turn have meant persistent diversity among welfare regimes.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to better understand what is meant by general support for the <b>welfare</b> <b>state.</b> At the start of this study, I observed an alleged discrepancy between people’s preferences and <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> policies. Whereas on the one hand various studies demonstrate that public support for generous <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> arrangements remained high or in some countries increased across time, actual policy designs changed in the opposite direction and became increasingly sober and conditional. This mismatch between preferences and <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> transformations has led me to research in detail whether and why the public continues to support <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> arrangements. In general, this study reveals three conclusions that extend previous research in the field. First, <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> support and real welfare policies are inextricably intertwined. Individual welfare preferences cannot sufficiently be understood if the reform of various <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> policies is not considered simultaneously. Second, support for <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> reforms contains several theoretical and empirical dimensions. When just one general support dimension is considered, inaccurate claims about support can occur. Third, it is not merely economic self-interest that explains individual <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> support. Moral conceptions also drive support for <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> reforms...|$|R
