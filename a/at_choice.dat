6000|$|Mr. Masson's {{remarks on}} the versification of Milton are, in the main, judicious, but when he ventures on particulars, one cannot always agree with him. He seems to {{understand}} that our prosody is accentual merely, and yet, {{when he comes to}} what he calls variations, he talks of the [...] "substitution of the Trochee, the Pyrrhic, or the Spondee, for the regular Iambus, or of the Anapaest, the Dactyl, the Tribrach, etc., for the same." [...] This is always misleading. The shift of the accent in what Mr. Masson calls [...] "dissyllabic variations" [...] is common to all pentameter verse, and, in the other case, most of the words cited as trisyllables either were not so in Milton's day,[375] or were so or not <b>at</b> <b>choice</b> of the poet, according to their place in the verse. There is not an elision of Milton's without precedent in the dramatists from whom he learned to write blank-verse. Milton was a greater metrist than any of them, except Marlowe and Shakespeare, and he employed the elision (or the slur) oftener than they to give a faint undulation or retardation to his verse, only because his epic form demanded it more for variety's sake. How Milton would have read them, is another question. He certainly often marked them by an apostrophe in his manuscripts. He doubtless composed according to quantity, so far as that is possible in English, and as Cowper somewhat extravagantly says, [...] "gives almost as many proofs of it in his 'Paradise Lost' as there are lines in the poem."[376] But when Mr. Masson tells us that ...|$|E

6000|$|Now what {{precisely}} was Filmer's idea? Really a {{very simple}} one. Before his time the pursuit of aeronautics had taken two divergent lines, and had developed {{on the one hand}} balloons--large apparatus lighter than air, easy in ascent, and comparatively safe in descent, but floating helplessly before any breeze that took them; and on the other, flying machines that flew only in theory--vast flat structures heavier than air, propelled and kept up by heavy engines {{and for the most part}} smashing at the first descent. But, neglecting the fact that the inevitable final collapse rendered them impossible, the weight of the flying machines gave them this theoretical advantage, that they could go through the air against a wind, a necessary condition if aerial navigation was to have any practical value. It is Filmer's particular merit that he perceived the way in which the contrasted and hitherto incompatible merits of balloon and heavy flying machine might be combined in one apparatus, which should be <b>at</b> <b>choice</b> either heavier or lighter than air. He took hints from the contractile bladders of fish and the pneumatic cavities of birds. He devised an arrangement of contractile and absolutely closed balloons which when expanded could lift the actual flying apparatus with ease, and when retracted by the complicated [...] "musculature" [...] he wove about them, were withdrawn almost completely into the frame; and he built the large framework which these balloons sustained, of hollow, rigid tubes, the air in which, by an ingenious contrivance, was automatically pumped out as the apparatus fell, and which then remained exhausted so long as the aeronaut desired. There were no wings or propellers to his machine, such as there had been to all previous aeroplanes, and the only engine required was the compact and powerful little appliance needed to contract the balloons. He perceived that such an apparatus as he had devised might rise with frame exhausted and balloons expanded to a considerable height, might then contract its balloons and let the air into its frame, and by an adjustment of its weights slide down the air in any desired direction. As it fell it would accumulate velocity and at the same time lose weight, and the momentum accumulated by its down-rush could be utilised by means of a shifting of its weights to drive it up in the air again as the balloons expanded. This conception, which is still the structural conception of all successful flying machines, needed, however, a vast amount of toil upon its details before it could actually be realised, and such toil Filmer--as he was accustomed to tell the numerous interviewers who crowded upon him in the heyday of his fame--"ungrudgingly and unsparingly gave." [...] His particular difficulty was the elastic lining of the contractile balloon. He found he needed a new substance, and in the discovery and manufacture of that new substance he had, as he never failed to impress upon the interviewers, [...] "performed a far more arduous work than even in the actual achievement of my seemingly greater discovery." ...|$|E

[...] Go therefore, half this day as friend with friend [...] Converse with Adam, in what Bowre or shade [...] 230 [...] Thou find'st him from the heat of Noon retir'd, [...] To respit his day-labour with repast, [...] Or with repose; and such discourse bring on, [...] As may advise him of his happie state, [...] Happiness in his power left free to will, [...] Left to his own free Will, his Will though free, [...] Yet mutable; whence warne him to beware [...] He swerve not too secure: tell him withall [...] His danger, and from whom, what enemie [...] Late falln himself from Heav'n, is plotting now [...] 240 [...] The fall of others from like state of bliss; [...] By violence, no, for that shall be withstood, [...] But by deceit and lies; this let him know, [...] Least wilfully transgressing he pretend [...] Surprisal, unadmonisht, unforewarnd. [...] So spake th' Eternal Father, and fulfilld [...] All Justice: nor delaid the winged Saint [...] After his charge receivd, but from among [...] Thousand Celestial Ardors, where he stood [...] Vaild with his gorgeous wings, up springing light [...] 250 [...] Flew through the midst of Heav'n; th' angelic Quires [...] On each hand parting, to his speed gave way [...] Through all th' Empyreal road; till at the Gate [...] Of Heav'n arriv'd, the gate self-opend wide [...] On golden Hinges turning, as by work [...] Divine the sov'ran Architect had fram'd. [...] From hence, no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight, [...] Starr interpos'd, however small he sees, [...] Not unconform to other shining Globes, [...] Earth and the Gard'n of God, with Cedars crownd [...] 260 [...] Above all Hills. As when by night the Glass [...] Of Galileo, less assur'd, observes [...] Imagind Lands and Regions in the Moon: [...] Or Pilot from amidst the Cyclades [...] Delos or Samos first appeering kenns [...] A cloudy spot. Down thither prone in flight [...] He speeds, and through the vast Ethereal Skie [...] Sailes between worlds & worlds, with steddie wing [...] Now on the polar windes, then with quick Fann [...] Winnows the buxom Air; till within soare [...] 270 [...] Of Towring Eagles, to all the Fowles he seems [...] A Phoenix, gaz'd by all, as that sole Bird [...] When to enshrine his reliques in the Sun's [...] Bright Temple, to Aegyptian Theb's he flies. [...] At once on th' Eastern cliff of Paradise [...] He lights, and to his proper shape returns [...] A Seraph wingd; six wings he wore, to shade [...] His lineaments Divine; the pair that clad [...] Each shoulder broad, came mantling o're his brest [...] With regal Ornament; the middle pair [...] 280 [...] Girt like a Starrie Zone his waste, and round [...] Skirted his loines and thighes with downie Gold [...] And colours dipt in Heav'n; the third his feet [...] Shaddowd from either heele with featherd maile [...] Skie-tinctur'd grain. Like Maia's son he stood, [...] And shook his Plumes, that Heav'nly fragrance filld [...] The circuit wide. Strait knew him all the bands [...] Of Angels under watch; and to his state, [...] And to his message high in honour rise; [...] For on som message high they guessd him bound. [...] 290 [...] Thir glittering Tents he passd, and now is come [...] Into the blissful field, through Groves of Myrrhe, [...] And flouring Odours, Cassia, Nard, and Balme; [...] A Wilderness of sweets; for Nature here [...] Wantond as in her prime, and plaid at will [...] Her Virgin Fancies, pouring forth more sweet, [...] Wilde above rule or art; enormous bliss. [...] Him through the spicie Forrest onward com [...] Adam discernd, as in the dore he sat [...] Of his coole Bowre, while now the mounted Sun [...] 300 [...] Shot down direct his fervid Raies, to warme [...] Earths inmost womb, more warmth then Adam need; [...] And Eve within, due at her hour prepar'd [...] For dinner savourie fruits, of taste to please [...] True appetite, and not disrelish thirst [...] Of nectarous draughts between, from milkie stream, [...] Berrie or Grape: to whom thus Adam call'd. [...] Haste hither Eve, and worth thy sight behold [...] Eastward among those Trees, what glorious shape [...] Comes this way moving; seems another Morn [...] 310 [...] Ris'n on mid-noon; som great behest from Heav'n [...] To us perhaps he brings, and will voutsafe [...] This day to be our Guest. But goe with speed, [...] And what thy stores contain, bring forth and poure [...] Abundance, fit to honour and receive [...] Our Heav'nly stranger; well we may afford [...] Our givers thir own gifts, and large bestow [...] From large bestowd, where Nature multiplies [...] Her fertil growth, and by disburd'ning grows [...] More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare. [...] 320 [...] To whom thus Eve. Adam, earths hallowd mould, [...] Of God inspir'd, small store will serve, where store, [...] All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk; [...] Save what by frugal storing firmness gains [...] To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes: [...] But I will haste and from each bough and break, [...] Each Plant & juciest Gourd will pluck such choice [...] To entertain our Angel guest, as hee [...] Beholding shall confess that here on Earth [...] God hath dispenst his bounties as in Heav'n. [...] 330 [...] So saying, with dispatchful looks in haste [...] She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent [...] What choice to chuse for delicacie best, [...] What order, so contriv'd as not to mix [...] Tastes, not well joynd, inelegant, but bring [...] Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change, [...] Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk [...] Whatever Earth all-bearing Mother yeilds [...] In India East or West, or middle shoare [...] In Pontus or the Punic Coast, or where [...] 340 [...] Alcinous reign'd, fruit of all kindes, in coate, [...] Rough, or smooth rin'd, or bearded husk, or shell [...] She gathers, Tribute large, and on the board [...] Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink the Grape [...] She crushes, inoffensive moust, and meathes [...] From many a berrie, and from sweet kernels prest [...] She tempers dulcet creams, nor these to hold [...] Wants her fit vessels pure, then strews the ground [...] With Rose and Odours from the shrub unfum'd. [...] Mean while our Primitive great Sire, to meet [...] 350 [...] His god-like Guest, walks forth, without more train [...] Accompani'd then with his own compleat [...] Perfections, in himself was all his state, [...] More solemn then the tedious pomp that waits [...] On Princes, when thir rich Retinue long [...] Of Horses led, and Grooms besmeard with Gold [...] Dazles the croud, and sets them all agape. [...] Neerer his presence Adam though not awd, [...] Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek, [...] As to a superior Nature, bowing low, [...] 360 [...] Thus said. Native of Heav'n, for other place [...] None can then Heav'n such glorious shape contain; [...] Since by descending from the Thrones above, [...] Those happie places thou hast deignd a while [...] To want, and honour these, voutsafe with us [...] Two onely, who yet by sov'ran gift possess [...] This spacious ground, in yonder shadie Bowre [...] To rest, and what the Garden choicest bears [...] To sit and taste, till this meridian heat [...] Be over, and the Sun more coole decline. [...] 370 [...] Whom thus the Angelic Vertue answerd milde. [...] Adam, I therefore came, nor art thou such [...] Created, or such place hast here to dwell, [...] As may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heav'n [...] To visit thee; lead on then where thy Bowre [...] Oreshades; for these mid-hours, till Eevning rise [...] I have at will. So to the Silvan Lodge [...] They came, that like Pomona's Arbour smil'd [...] With flourets deck't and fragrant smells; but Eve [...] Undeckt, save with her self more lovely fair [...] 380 [...] Then Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feign'd [...] Of three that in Mount Ida naked strove, [...] Stood to entertain her guest from Heav'n; no vaile [...] Shee needed, Vertue-proof, no thought infirme [...] Alterd her cheek. On whom the Angel Haile [...] Bestowd, the holy salutation us'd [...] Long after to blest Marie, second Eve. [...] Haile Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful Womb [...] Shall fill the World more numerous with thy Sons [...] Then with these various fruits the Trees of God [...] 390 [...] Have heap'd this Table. Rais'd of grassie terf [...] Thir Table was, and mossie seats had round, [...] And on her ample Square from side to side [...] All Autumn pil'd, though Spring and Autumn here [...] Danc'd hand in hand. A while discourse they hold; [...] No fear lest Dinner coole; when thus began [...] Our Authour. Heav'nly stranger, please to taste [...] These bounties which our Nourisher, from whom [...] All perfet good unmeasur'd out, descends, [...] To us for food and for delight hath caus'd [...] 400 [...] The Earth to yeild; unsavourie food perhaps [...] To spiritual Natures; only this I know, [...] That one Celestial Father gives to all. [...] To whom the Angel. Therefore what he gives [...] (Whose praise be ever sung) to man in part [...] Spiritual, may of purest Spirits be found [...] No ingrateful food: and food alike those pure [...] Intelligential substances require [...] As doth your Rational; and both contain [...] Within them every lower facultie [...] 410 [...] Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste, [...] Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate, [...] And corporeal to incorporeal turn. [...] For know, whatever was created, needs [...] To be sustaind and fed; of Elements [...] The grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea, [...] Earth and the Sea feed Air, the Air those Fires [...] Ethereal, and as lowest first the Moon; [...] Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurg'd [...] Vapours not yet into her substance turnd. [...] 420 [...] Nor doth the Moon no nourishment exhale [...] From her moist Continent to higher Orbes. [...] The Sun that light imparts to all, receives [...] From all his alimental recompence [...] In humid exhalations, and at Even [...] Sups with the Ocean: though in Heav'n the Trees [...] Of life ambrosial frutage bear, and vines [...] Yeild Nectar, though from off the boughs each Morn [...] We brush mellifluous Dewes, and find the ground [...] Cover'd with pearly grain: yet God hath here [...] 430 [...] Varied his bounty so with new delights, [...] As may compare with Heaven; and to taste [...] Think not I shall be nice. So down they sat, [...] And to thir viands fell, nor seemingly [...] The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss [...] Of Theologians, but with keen dispatch [...] Of real hunger, and concoctive heate [...] To transubstantiate; what redounds, transpires [...] Through Spirits with ease; nor wonder; if by fire [...] Of sooty coal the Empiric Alchimist [...] 440 [...] Can turn, or holds it possible to turn [...] Metals of drossiest Ore to perfet Gold [...] As from the Mine. Mean while at Table Eve [...] Ministerd naked, and thir flowing cups [...] With pleasant liquors crown'd: O innocence [...] Deserving Paradise! if ever, then, [...] Then had the Sons of God excuse to have bin [...] Enamour'd at that sight; but in those hearts [...] Love unlibidinous reign'd, nor jealousie [...] Was understood, the injur'd Lovers Hell. [...] 450 [...] Thus when with meats & drinks they had suffic'd, [...] Not burd'nd Nature, sudden mind arose [...] In Adam, not to let th' occasion pass [...] Given him by this great Conference to know [...] Of things above his World, and of thir being [...] Who dwell in Heav'n, whose excellence he saw [...] Transcend his own so farr, whose radiant forms [...] Divine effulgence, whose high Power so far [...] Exceeded human, and his wary speech [...] Thus to th' Empyreal Minister he fram'd. [...] 460 [...] Inhabitant with God, now know I well [...] Thy favour, in this honour done to man, [...] Under whose lowly roof thou hast voutsaf't [...] To enter, and these earthly fruits to taste, [...] Food not of Angels, yet accepted so, [...] As that more willingly thou couldst not seem [...] At Heav'ns high feasts to have fed: yet what compare? [...] To whom the winged Hierarch repli'd. [...] O Adam, one Almightie is, from whom [...] All things proceed, and up to him return, [...] 470 [...] If not deprav'd from good, created all [...] Such to perfection, one first matter all, [...] Indu'd with various forms, various degrees [...] Of substance, and in things that live, of life; [...] But more refin'd, more spiritous, and pure, [...] As neerer to him plac't or neerer tending [...] Each in thir several active Sphears assignd, [...] Till body up to spirit work, in bounds [...] Proportiond to each kind. So from the root [...] Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves [...] 480 [...] More aerie, last the bright consummate floure [...] Spirits odorous breathes: flours and thir fruit [...] Mans nourishment, by gradual scale sublim'd [...] To vital Spirits aspire, to animal, [...] To intellectual, give both life and sense, [...] Fansie and understanding, whence the soule [...] Reason receives, and reason is her being, [...] Discursive, or Intuitive; discourse [...] Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours, [...] Differing but in degree, of kind the same. [...] 490 [...] Wonder not then, what God for you saw good [...] If I refuse not, but convert, as you, [...] To proper substance; time may come when men [...] With Angels may participate, and find [...] No inconvenient Diet, nor too light Fare: [...] And from these corporal nutriments perhaps [...] Your bodies may at last turn all to Spirit [...] Improv'd by tract of time, and wingd ascend [...] Ethereal, as wee, or may <b>at</b> <b>choice</b> [...] Here or in Heav'nly Paradises dwell; [...] 500 [...] If ye be found obedient, and retain [...] Unalterably firm his love entire [...] Whose progenie you are. Mean while enjoy [...] Your fill what happiness this happie state [...] Can comprehend, incapable of more. [...] To whom the Patriarch of mankind repli'd. [...] O favourable spirit, propitious guest, [...] Well hast thou taught the way that might direct [...] Our knowledge, and the scale of Nature set [...] From center to circumference, whereon [...] 510 [...] In contemplation of created things [...] By steps we may ascend to God. But say, [...] What meant that caution joind, If Ye Be Found [...] Obedient? can wee want obedience then [...] To him, or possibly his love desert [...] Who formd us from the dust, and plac'd us here [...] Full to the utmost measure of what bliss [...] Human desires can seek or apprehend? [...] To whom the Angel. Son of Heav'n and Earth, [...] Attend: That thou art happie, owe to God; [...] 520 [...] That thou continu'st such, owe to thy self, [...] That is, to thy obedience; therein stand. [...] This was that caution giv'n thee; be advis'd. [...] God made thee perfet, not immutable; [...] And good he made thee, but to persevere [...] He left it in thy power, ordaind thy will [...] By nature free, not over-rul'd by Fate [...] Inextricable, or strict necessity; [...] Our voluntarie service he requires, [...] Not our necessitated, such with him [...] 530 [...] Findes no acceptance, nor can find, for how [...] Can hearts, not free, be tri'd whether they serve [...] Willing or no, who will but what they must [...] By Destinie, and can no other choose? [...] My self and all th' Angelic Host that stand [...] In sight of God enthron'd, our happie state [...] Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds; [...] On other surety none; freely we serve. [...] Because wee freely love, as in our will [...] To love or not; in this we stand or fall: [...] 540 [...] And som are fall'n, to disobedience fall'n, [...] And so from Heav'n to deepest Hell; O fall [...] From what high state of bliss into what woe! [...] To whom our great Progenitor. Thy words [...] Attentive, and with more delighted eare [...] Divine instructer, I have heard, then when [...] Cherubic Songs by night from neighbouring Hills [...] Aereal Music send: nor knew I not [...] To be both will and deed created free; [...] Yet that we never shall forget to love [...] 550 [...] Our maker, and obey him whose command [...] Single, is yet so just, my constant thoughts [...] Assur'd me and still assure: though what thou tellst [...] Hath past in Heav'n, som doubt within me move, [...] But more desire to hear, if thou consent, [...] The full relation, which must needs be strange, [...] Worthy of Sacred silence to be heard; [...] And we have yet large day, for scarce the Sun [...] Hath finisht half his journey, and scarce begins [...] His other half in the great Zone of Heav'n. [...] 560 [...] Thus Adam made request, and Raphael [...] After short pause assenting, thus began. [...] High matter thou injoinst me, O prime of men, [...] Sad task and hard, for how shall I relate [...] To human sense th' invisible exploits [...] Of warring Spirits; how without remorse [...] The ruin of so many glorious once [...] And perfet while they stood; how last unfould [...] The secrets of another world, perhaps [...] Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good [...] 570 [...] This is dispenc't, and what surmounts the reach [...] Of human sense, I shall delineate so, [...] By lik'ning spiritual to corporal forms, [...] As may express them best, though what if Earth [...] Be but the shaddow of Heav'n, and things therein [...] Each to other like, more then on earth is thought? [...] As yet this world was not, and Chaos wilde [...] Reignd where these Heav'ns now rowl, where Earth now rests [...] Upon her Center pois'd, when on a day [...] (For Time, though in Eternitie, appli'd [...] 580 [...] To motion, measures all things durable [...] By present, past, and future) on such day [...] As Heav'ns great Year brings forth, th' Empyreal Host [...] Of Angels by Imperial summons call'd, [...] Innumerable before th' Almighties Throne [...] Forthwith from all the ends of Heav'n appeerd [...] Under thir Hierarchs in orders bright [...] Ten thousand thousand Ensignes high advanc'd, [...] Standards, and Gonfalons twixt Van and Reare [...] Streame in the Aire, and for distinction serve [...] 590 [...] Of Hierarchies, of Orders, and Degrees; [...] Or in thir glittering Tissues bear imblaz'd [...] Holy Memorials, acts of Zeale and Love [...] Recorded eminent. Thus when in Orbes [...] Of circuit inexpressible they stood, [...] Orb within Orb, the Father infinite, [...] By whom in bliss imbosom'd sat the Son, [...] Amidst as from a flaming Mount, whose top [...] Brightness had made invisible, thus spake. [...] Hear all ye Angels, Progenie of Light, [...] 600 [...] Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers, [...] Hear my Decree, which unrevok't shall stand. [...] This day I have begot whom I declare [...] My onely Son, and on this holy Hill [...] Him have anointed, whom ye now behold [...] At my right hand; your Head I him appoint; [...] And by my Self have sworn to him shall bow [...] All knees in Heav'n, and shall confess him Lord: [...] Under his great Vice-gerent Reign abide [...] United as one individual Soule [...] 610 [...] For ever happie: him who disobeyes [...] Mee disobeyes, breaks union, and that day [...] Cast out from God and blessed vision, falls [...] Into utter darkness, deep ingulft, his place [...] Ordaind without redemption, without end. [...] So spake th' Omnipotent, and with his words [...] All seemd well pleas'd, all seem'd, but were not all. [...] That day, as other solem dayes, they spent [...] In song and dance about the sacred Hill, [...] Mystical dance, which yonder starrie Spheare [...] 620 [...] Of Planets and of fixt in all her Wheeles [...] Resembles nearest, mazes intricate, [...] Eccentric, intervolv'd, yet regular [...] Then most, when most irregular they seem: [...] And in thir motions harmonie Divine [...] So smooths her charming tones, that Gods own ear [...] Listens delighted. Eevning approachd [...] (For we have also our Eevning and our Morn, [...] We ours for change delectable, not need) [...] Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn [...] 630 [...] Desirous, all in Circles as they stood, [...] Tables are set, and on a sudden pil'd [...] With Angels Food, and rubied Nectar flows: [...] In Pearl, in Diamond, and massie Gold, [...] Fruit of delicious Vines, the growth of Heav'n. [...] They eat, they drink, and with refection sweet [...] Are fill'd, before th' all bounteous King, who showrd [...] With copious hand, rejoycing in thir joy. [...] Now when ambrosial Night with Clouds exhal'd [...] From that high mount of God, whence light & shade [...] 640 [...] Spring both, the face of brightest Heav'n had changd [...] To grateful Twilight (for Night comes not there [...] In darker veile) and roseat Dews dispos'd [...] All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest, [...] Wide over all the Plain, and wider farr [...] Then all this globous Earth in Plain outspred, [...] (Such are the Courts of God) Th' Angelic throng [...] Disperst in Bands and Files thir Camp extend [...] By living Streams among the Trees of Life, [...] Pavilions numberless, and sudden reard, [...] 650 [...] Celestial Tabernacles, where they slept [...] Fannd with coole Winds, save those who in thir course [...] Melodious Hymns about the sovran Throne [...] Alternate all night long: but not so wak'd [...] Satan, so call him now, his former name [...] Is heard no more Heav'n; he of the first, [...] If not the first Arch-Angel, great in Power, [...] In favour and praeeminence, yet fraught [...] With envie against the Son of God, that day [...] Honourd by his great Father, and proclaimd [...] 660 [...] Messiah King anointed, could not beare [...] Through pride that sight, and thought himself impaird. [...] Deep malice thence conceiving & disdain, [...] Soon as midnight brought on the duskie houre [...] Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolv'd [...] With all his Legions to dislodge, and leave [...] Unworshipt, unobey'd the Throne supream [...] Contemptuous, and his next subordinate [...] Awak'ning, thus to him in secret spake. [...] Sleepst thou Companion dear, what sleep can close [...] 670 [...] Thy eye-lids? and remembrest what Decree [...] Of yesterday, so late hath past the lips [...] Of Heav'ns Almightie. Thou to me thy thoughts [...] Wast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart; [...] Both waking we were one; how then can now [...] Thy sleep dissent? new Laws thou seest impos'd; [...] New Laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise [...] In us who serve, new Counsels, to debate [...] What doubtful may ensue, more in this place [...] To utter is not safe. Assemble thou [...] 680 [...] Of all those Myriads which we lead the chief; [...] Tell them that by command, ere yet dim Night [...] Her shadowie Cloud withdraws, I am to haste, [...] And all who under me thir Banners wave, [...] Homeward with flying march where we possess [...] The Quarters of the North, there to prepare [...] Fit entertainment to receive our King [...] The great Messiah, and his new commands, [...] Who speedily through all the Hierarchies [...] Intends to pass triumphant, and give Laws. [...] 690 [...] So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infus'd [...] Bad influence into th' unwarie brest [...] Of his Associate; hee together calls, [...] Or several one by one, the Regent Powers, [...] Under him Regent, tells, as he was taught, [...] That the most High commanding, now ere Night, [...] Now ere dim Night had disincumberd Heav'n, [...] The great Hierarchal Standard was to move; [...] Tells the suggested cause, and casts between [...] Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound [...] 700 [...] Or taint integritie; but all obey'd [...] The wonted signal, and superior voice [...] Of thir great Potentate; for great indeed [...] His name, and high was his degree in Heav'n; [...] His count'nance, as the Morning Starr that guides [...] The starrie flock, allur'd them, and with lyes [...] Drew after him the third part of Heav'ns Host: [...] Mean while th' Eternal eye, whose sight discernes [...] Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy Mount [...] And from within the golden Lamps that burne [...] 710 [...] Nightly before him, saw without thir light [...] Rebellion rising, saw in whom, how spred [...] Among the sons of Morn, what multitudes [...] Were banded to oppose his high Decree; [...] And smiling to his onely Son thus said. [...] Son, thou in whom my glory I behold [...] In full resplendence, Heir of all my might, [...] Neerly it now concernes us to be sure [...] Of our Omnipotence, and with what Arms [...] We mean to hold what anciently we claim [...] 720 [...] Of Deitie or Empire, such a foe [...] Is rising, who intends to erect his Throne [...] Equal to ours, throughout the spacious North; [...] Nor so content, hath in his thought to trie [...] In battel, what our Power is, or our right. [...] Let us advise, and to this hazard draw [...] With speed what force is left, and all imploy [...] In our defence, lest unawares we lose [...] This our high place, our Sanctuarie, our Hill. [...] To whom the Son with calm aspect and cleer [...] 730 [...] Light'ning Divine, ineffable, serene, [...] Made answer. Mightie Father, thou thy foes [...] Justly hast in derision, and secure [...] Laugh'st at thir vain designes and tumults vain, [...] Matter to mee of Glory, whom thir hate [...] Illustrates, when they see all Regal Power [...] Giv'n me to quell thir pride, and in event [...] Know whether I be dextrous to subdue [...] Thy Rebels, or be found the worst in Heav'n. [...] So spake the Son, but Satan with his Powers [...] 740 [...] Farr was advanc't on winged speed, an Host [...] Innumerable as the Starrs of Night, [...] Or Starrs of Morning, Dew-drops, which the Sun [...] Impearls on every leaf and every flouer. [...] Regions they pass'd, the mightie Regencies [...] Of Seraphim and Potentates and Thrones [...] In thir triple Degrees, Regions to which [...] All thy Dominion, Adam, is no more [...] Then what this Garden is to all the Earth, [...] And all the Sea, from one entire globose [...] 750 [...] Stretcht into Longitude; which having pass'd [...] At length into the limits of the North [...] They came, and Satan to his Royal seat [...] High on a Hill, far blazing, as a Mount [...] Rais'd on a Mount, with Pyramids and Towrs [...] From Diamond Quarries hew'n, & Rocks of Gold, [...] The Palace of great Lucifer, (so call [...] That Structure in the Dialect of men [...] Interpreted) which not long after, hee [...] Affecting all equality with God, [...] 760 [...] In imitation of that Mount whereon [...] Messiah was declar'd in sight of Heav'n, [...] The Mountain of the Congregation call'd; [...] For thither he assembl'd all his Train, [...] Pretending so commanded to consult [...] About the great reception of thir King, [...] Thither to come, and with calumnious Art [...] Of counterfeted truth thus held thir ears. [...] Thrones, Dominations, Princedomes, Vertues, Powers, [...] If these magnific Titles yet remain [...] 770 [...] Not meerly titular, since by Decree [...] Another now hath to himself ingross't [...] All Power, and us eclipst under the name [...] Of King anointed, for whom all this haste [...] Of midnight march, and hurried meeting here, [...] This onely to consult how we may best [...] With what may be devis'd of honours new [...] Receive him coming to receive from us [...] Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile, [...] Too much to one, but double how endur'd, [...] 780 [...] To one and to his image now proclaim'd? [...] But what if better counsels might erect [...] Our minds and teach us to cast off this Yoke? [...] Will ye submit your necks, and chuse to bend [...] The supple knee? ye will not, if I trust [...] To know ye right, or if ye know your selves [...] Natives and Sons of Heav'n possest before [...] By none, and if not equal all, yet free, [...] Equally free; for Orders and Degrees [...] Jarr not with liberty, but well consist. [...] 790 [...] Who can in reason then or right assume [...] Monarchie over such as live by right [...] His equals, if in power and splendor less, [...] In freedome equal? or can introduce [...] Law and Edict on us, who without law [...] Erre not, much less for this to be our Lord, [...] And look for adoration to th' abuse [...] Of those Imperial Titles which assert [...] Our being ordain'd to govern, not to serve? [...] Thus farr his bold discourse without controule [...] 800 [...] Had audience, when among the Seraphim [...] Abdiel, then whom none with more zeale ador'd [...] The Deitie, and divine commands obei'd, [...] Stood up, and in a flame of zeale severe [...] The current of his fury thus oppos'd. [...] O argument blasphemous, false and proud! [...] Words which no eare ever to hear in Heav'n [...] Expected, least of all from thee, ingrate [...] In place thy self so high above thy Peeres. [...] Canst thou with impious obloquie condemne [...] 810 [...] The just Decree of God, pronounc't and sworn, [...] That to his only Son by right endu'd [...] With Regal Scepter, every Soule in Heav'n [...] Shall bend the knee, and in that honour due [...] Confess him rightful King? unjust thou saist [...] Flatly unjust, to binde with Laws the free, [...] And equal over equals to let Reigne, [...] One over all with unsucceeded power. [...] Shalt thou give Law to God, shalt thou dispute [...] With him the points of libertie, who made [...] 820 [...] Thee what thou art, & formd the Pow'rs of Heav'n [...] Such as he pleasd, and circumscrib'd thir being? [...] Yet by experience taught we know how good, [...] And of our good, and of our dignitie [...] How provident he is, how farr from thought [...] To make us less, bent rather to exalt [...] Our happie state under one Head more neer [...] United. But to grant it thee unjust, [...] That equal over equals Monarch Reigne: [...] Thy self though great & glorious dost thou count, [...] 830 [...] Or all Angelic Nature joind in one, [...] Equal to him begotten Son, by whom [...] As by his Word the mighty Father made [...] All things, ev'n thee, and all the Spirits of Heav'n [...] By him created in thir bright degrees, [...] Crownd them with Glory, & to thir Glory nam'd [...] Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers [...] Essential Powers, nor by his Reign obscur'd, [...] But more illustrious made, since he the Head [...] One of our number thus reduc't becomes, [...] 840 [...] His Laws our Laws, all honour to him done [...] Returns our own. Cease then this impious rage, [...] And tempt not these; but hast'n to appease [...] Th' incensed Father, and th' incensed Son, [...] While Pardon may be found in time besought. [...] So spake the fervent Angel, but his zeale [...] None seconded, as out of season judg'd, [...] Or singular and rash, whereat rejoic'd [...] Th' Apostat, and more haughty thus repli'd. [...] That we were formd then saist thou? & the work [...] 850 [...] Of secondarie hands, by task transferd [...] From Father to his Son? strange point and new! [...] Doctrin which we would know whence learnt: who saw [...] When this creation was? rememberst thou [...] Thy making, while the Maker gave thee being? [...] We know no time when we were not as now; [...] Know none before us, self-begot, self-rais'd [...] By our own quick'ning power, when fatal course [...] Had circl'd his full Orbe, the birth mature [...] Of this our native Heav'n, Ethereal Sons. [...] 860 [...] Our puissance is our own, our own right hand [...] Shall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try [...] Who is our equal: then thou shalt behold [...] Whether by supplication we intend [...] Address, and to begirt th' Almighty Throne [...] Beseeching or besieging. This report, [...] These tidings carrie to th' anointed King; [...] And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight. [...] He said, and as the sound of waters deep [...] Hoarce murmur echo'd to his words applause [...] 870 [...] Through the infinite Host, nor less for that [...] The flaming Seraph fearless, though alone [...] Encompass'd round with foes, thus answerd bold. [...] O alienate from God, O spirit accurst, [...] Forsak'n of all good; I see thy fall [...] Determind, and thy hapless crew involv'd [...] In this perfidious fraud, contagion spred [...] Both of thy crime and punishment: henceforth [...] No more be troubl'd how to quit the yoke [...] Of Gods Messiah; those indulgent Laws [...] 880 [...] Will not be now voutsaf't, other Decrees [...] Against thee are gon forth without recall; [...] That Golden Scepter which thou didst reject [...] Is now an Iron Rod to bruise and breake [...] Thy disobedience.

The following year, Boateng was asked to present Saturday's Choice, a show that aired once a month on a Saturday. In 2007, the success of Saturday's Choice led to a permanent position <b>at</b> <b>Choice</b> FM to host the new Morning Riser show between 3:00 am and 6:00 am from Monday to Friday. He then moved to another time slot in March 2010 to present the station's evening show from 8:00 pm to 12:00 am from Monday to Friday. The evening show consisted of tracks from Choice FM's playlist but also included interviews with high-profile artists: Diddy, Usher, Drake, Dizzee Rascal, Kelly Rowland, Big Boi, Labrinth, Kelis, Taio Cruz, Flo Rida, Travie McCoy, Tinchy Stryder, Jeremih, Loick Essien, Jason Derulo amongst others. In April 2011, Choice FM announced that DJ Abrantee would become the new presenter of its drive time show between 4:00 pm and 8:00 pm from Monday to Friday. It also announced that Abrantee would start hosting a new program entirely dedicated to Afrobeats from 12:00 am to 2:00 am every Saturday. The new show called Afrobeats with Abrantee was launched on 16 April 2011 {{and was one of the}} most tweeted about topic on Twitter that day which resulted in Choice FM trending for the first time on the social networking service. Abrantee is currently on the air every Sunday - Thursday from 4:00 pm to 7:00 pm for what is now Capital Xtra's drivetime show, while the Afrobeats with Abrantee show is now on between 11:00 pm and 1:00 am every Saturday.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn the Drosophila embryo, <b>at</b> {{specific}} <b>choice</b> {{points along}} the major motor nerves, subsets of motor axons defasciculate and then steer into their muscle target regions. Here we describe the analysis of beaten path (beat), a gene required for the selective defasciculation of motor axons <b>at</b> these <b>choice</b> points. In beat mutant embryos, motor axons fail to defasciculate and bypass their targets. This phenotype is suppressed by mutations in FasII and conn, two genes encoding cell adhesion molecules expressed on motor axons, suggesting that beat provides an antiadhesive function. beat encodes a novel secreted protein that is expressed by motoneurons during outgrowth. Rescue and ectopic expression experiments support the model that Beat protein is secreted by motor axons where it functions to regulate their selective defasciculation <b>at</b> specific <b>choice</b> points...|$|R

40|$|The {{common theme}} in many recent axonal pathfinding studies, both in {{vertebrates}} and invertebrates, is {{the demonstration of}} the importance of a balance between positive and negative cues. The integration of multiple and often opposing molecular interactions at each site along the axon's trajectory, especially <b>at</b> <b>choice</b> points, helps to fine tune the directional response of its growth cone, which continuously samples its environment for guidance cues. The dynamic regulation of the receptors for such cues, in response to extrinsic signals, also enhances the behavioral repertoire of growth cones at different points along their trajectory. Some of the molecules identified as being important for axon guidance <b>at</b> <b>choice</b> points are conserved between invertebrates and vertebrates (e. g.
