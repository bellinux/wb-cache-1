Optical microscopy of the fraction below 1. 18 mm, showed that 87. 95 % of the FeSiMn corresponded to the alloy and that the slag content was 12. 05 %. For the HC-FeMn sample, 95. 07 % corresponded to the alloy and only 4. 93 % to the slag.

5000|$|The {{rediscovery of}} the film began in 1995 with a booking at San Francisco's Castro Theater and a reevaluation by Peter Stack: Mickey One is, in essence, a jazz film with an edgy style in which shadings and tone of voice are everything. It is laced with American idioms in its script by Alan Surgal, and most of Beatty's lines have a smart-alecky tone. When he goes on the run, Mickey meets a woman who wonders who he is (since he can't shake his show-biz patina) and he hits her with the line: [...] "I'm the king of silent movies hiding out till the talkies blow over." [...] In another place he {{verbally}} assaults a nightclub owner who can't figure out why Mickey's so edgy, saying, [...] "I'm guilty of not being innocent." [...] At the start we see pretty-boy Beatty as a hot comic in Detroit. He's got it all -- good looks, the swagger of a deft improviser -- and he's having a torrid affair with a blond siren. (The film is filled with women bursting with desire.) But fortune quickly turns -- witness to a torture murder in a back room, the comic flees, hoboes his way to Chicago's West Side and takes refuge in a junkyard. There he runs into another nightmarish scene -- police investigating a murder in an <b>automobile</b> <b>crusher.</b> The cinematic invention in Mickey One has been dismissed by some critics as contrivance. But Penn may have been decades {{ahead of his time}} in depicting an urban America as gallery of paranoia, cynicism and loneliness. In a classic scene, the comic is up against a brick wall auditioning at a nightclub, a single, powerful spotlight trained on him so he can't see into the audience. Penn creates an agonizing moment of a man talking awkwardly to God while looking as if he's standing before a firing squad.|$|R

40|$|Aim: The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to know the effect of feeding processed sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolour (L) moench) <b>crushed</b> <b>residue</b> (SSCR) based complete ration on growth, feeding behavior and cost of gain in Murrah buffalo calves in order to compare the feeding value of SSCR with sorghum straw (SS) and also find out the efficient way of utilization of SSCR in the diets of growing buffalo calves. Materials and Methods: Experimental complete rations were formulated with SSCR and concentrate in 50 : 50 ratio and processed in to SSCR chopped and concentrate (SSCRC), mash (SSCRM) and expander extruder pellets (SSCRP). The control ration was SS based complete feed processed in to mash (SSM). 24 Murrah buffalo calves (Average 137 kg body weight and aged 1 year 2 months) were randomly distributed into 4 experimental groups of 6 animals each in a completely randomized design and the experimental rations were offered to 4 groups randomly for a period of 150 days. A 7 day digestion trial was conducted at the end of 150 day growth trial to find out the nutrient digestibility of experimental rations. Eating and ruminating activities were noted every 5 minutes, and each activity was assumed to persist for the entire 5 minutes. Sorting behavior in the calves was observed physically at the time of feeding. The cost of the rations was calculated on the basis of processing cost and the prevailing market prices of the feed ingredients. Results: The DM intake (g/d), digestibilities of DM, organic matter, crude protein and nitrogen free extract and nitrogen (N) balance were higher (P< 0. 05) in buffalo calves fed SSCRP ration but, comparable among SSCRC, SSCRM and SSM rations. Higher (P< 0. 01) average daily gain (g), lower feed conversion ratio (FCR) was observed in calves fed SSCRP ration, while comparable among SSCRC, SSCRM and SSM rations. Eating, rumination and total chewing time (minutes/d,minutes/kg DMI and minutes/kg NDFI) and number of chews for eating, rumination and total chewing (per d, per kg DMI and per kg NDFI) were higher (P< 0. 01) in calves fed SSCRC ration and lower (P< 0. 01) in SSCRP ration and comparable among SSCRM and SSM rations. Sorting and selection of ration against large fibrous particles in favour of concentrate portion of the ration was observed in SSCRC ration and was not observed in SSCRP, SSCRM and SSM rations. lower (P< 0. 05) cost (INR) per kg gain was observed in buffalo calves fed SSCRP ration than those fed SSCRC, SSCRM and SSM rations. Conclusion: The present study indicated that SSCR may be used as roughage source in place of SS in complete feeds for economic feeding of buffalo calves. Further, expander-extruder processing of the complete ration improved feed intake, growth rate, feed efficiency and decreased sorting behavior and cost of feeding compared to mash and chopped forms of the ration.

40|$|AbstractSteam–oxygen {{gasification}} in a Circulating Fluidized-bed (CFB) reactor {{was developed}} for producing transportation fuels from different wood residues. This article {{presents the results of}} a two week test campaign, in which <b>crushed</b> forest <b>residues</b> and industrial bark mixture were used as the feedstocks. The aim of the work was to carry out extended time testing of the developed gasification and hot gas cleaning process and to determine the fate of different gas contaminants and trace components of wood. In the test runs, wood fuels were gasified in the CFB reactor at a 0. 2 – 0. 25 MPa pressure using a mixture of steam and oxygen as the gasification agent. A mixture of sand and dolomite was used as the bed material in order to maintain stable fluidization and to catalyse in-situ tar decomposition before hot filtration. Raw gas was filtered at ca. 550 °C and the filtered gas was then led into a two-stage catalytic tar reformer. The gasifier performance and the concentrations of different gas contaminants were determined at four different operating variable set points during a total of 215 h of operation. The results for carbon conversion efficiency, raw gas composition and the fate of fuel nitrogen, chlorine and trace metals are presented in this paper. The concentrations of gas contaminants were determined after the ceramic filter unit and after the catalytic reformer. The conversion efficiencies for hydrocarbon gases, tars and ammonia in the reformer are also presented.

40|$|During the {{production}} of precast concrete rubble arises from production residues, form errors and damages. Usually this concrete rubble is being collected throughout the year and stockpiled on the manufacturer’s site. Only {{when there is a}} sufficiently large amount of concrete debris is present, a mobile crusher hired to crush the hardened concrete rubble into recycled concrete aggregates. Such crushing campaign is organized once or twice a year. At that moment the concrete rubble has already fully cured and the cement has largely hydrated. This paper shows that it can be beneficial to use the residual binding present in recycled concrete aggregates, derived from concrete <b>residues</b> <b>crushed</b> at early age, and recycle the RCA in fresh concrete. The compressive strength of the recycled concrete increased with 10 % at a replacement rate of 30 %. Since crushing young concrete, which is weaker, requires less energy and aiming at the same required compression strength as the original concrete could lead to a small reduction of the cement needed in the recycled concrete mixture, these finding contribute to finding solutions for a more sustainable concrete production industry. status: publishe...|$|R

The following weed control methods were evaluated: harrowing, brushcutting, <b>residue</b> <b>crushing,</b> manual weeding, post-emergence herbicide application, pre-emergence herbicide application, and maintenance of soil cover with peanut forage, Brachiaria grass, and spontaneous vegetation (no weed treatment). The following properties were determined for physical characterization of the soil: bulk density, total porosity, macroporosity, microporosity, water retention, and the S index. The weed control method significantly affected the physical properties and water retention in the subsurface layer of the Oxisol. Soil bulk density, total porosity, macroporosity, and microporosity were significantly correlated with the S index. According to the S index, the physical quality of the soil was classified as very good for the various weed control methods investigated.

Defesa: Curitiba, 20 / 01 / 2016 Inclui referências : f. 136 - 141 Area de concentração : Materiais e estruturasResumo: A construção civil no Brasil necessita de uma reformulação para atender a crescimento populacional. Uma alternativa é a utilização de tecnologias com características industrializadas como o "light steel framing" (LSF) que é um sistema aberto, modular, de rápida execução, fácil manutenção e sustentável. Com a vigência da norma de desempenho, a NBR 15575 (ABNT, 2013), nasce uma necessidade de ciência sobre o desempenho dos sistemas. Materiais com características sustentáveis e de menor custo precisam ser avaliados de forma a contribuir para o avanço sustentável do LSF no Brasil, então o objetivo é avaliar o desempenho de alternativas para as vedações verticais externas em LSF com relação ao seu desempenho térmico e acústico visando menor custo e sustentabilidade. Os painéis possuem elementos constantes e variáveis como os isolantes e as massas para acabamento. Foram testados produtos industrializados, resíduo industrial, gesso acartonado moído e em pedaços (resíduo da construção) e materiais utilizados em outros sistemas construtivos. O desempenho térmico foi analisado segundo o procedimento 1 A Simplificado - NBR 15575 (ABNT, 2013) e experimento onde comparou-se a diferença de temperatura com a medição da face interna enquanto que uma fonte de calor manteve a temperatura da face externa em 80 oC por 60 minutos. O desempenho acústico foi analisado utilizando o método da função de transferência, já que os materiais reciclados não possuem índices para incrementar os cálculos ou simulações nos dois casos. Os resultados obtidos foram analisados pelo Processo de Análise Hierárquica (AHP) que determinou qual é o melhor painel. Quando o desempenho térmico é considerado o critério de maior importância, os painéis com acabamento na face externa (estuque sintético), massa látex PVA na parte interna e no {{interior}} do painel fibra cerâmica obtiveram o melhor desempenho. Para o desempenho acústico, o painel com lã de vidro no miolo obteve o melhor desempenho e quando o critério de maior relevância é o custo, os painéis com o interior preenchido com materiais reciclados obtiveram o menor valor.

With the legality of the law performance, the NBR 15575 (ABNT, 2013), the need of a study over the system's performance is born. Covering, isolation and finishing with sustainable characteristics and of low cost need to be appraised in a way to contribute to the sustainable advance of LSF in Brazil, therefore the goal is to evaluate the alternatives of performance for external vertical sealing in LSF with regards to its thermal performance and acoustic looking for low cost and sustainability. The frames have constant elements and changeable, like insulating materials and finishing batters. Were tested industrialized products such as glass wool and rock wool, ceramic fiber(industrial <b>residue),</b> <b>crushed</b> wall plaster(drywall) and in pieces(construction residues) and the acoustic stripe. the thermal performance was analysed according to procedure 1 A Simplified - NBR 15575 (ABNT, 2013) and the experiment, as well the acoustic performance that used the transfer function method, since the recycled materials do not have contents to increase the calculations or simulations. Were realized in sites with easy control of climate variables. In the thermal experiment measurements were done in one face, while the other source of heat kept the temperature from the opposite face in 80 C (176 F) for 60 minutes.
