5|$|In 1963 and 1964 the Egyptians {{had five}} squadrons of {{aircraft}} in Yemen at airfields near San'a and Hodeida. They were using Yak-11 piston-engined fighters, MiG-15 and MiG-17 jet fighters, Ilyushin Il-28 twin-engined bombers, Ilyushin Il-14 twin-engined transports and Mil Mi-4 transport helicopters. They were also flying four-engined Tupolev bombers from bases in Egypt, such as Aswan. <b>All</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> crew were Egyptian, {{except for the}} Tupolev bombers which were thought to have mixed Egyptian and Russian personnel. The Ilyushin transports flying between Egypt and Hodeida had Russian crews. Throughout the war, the Egyptians relied on airlift. In January 1964, when royalist forces placed San'a under siege, Egyptian Antonov heavy-lift cargo planes airlifted tons of food and kerosene into the region. The Egyptians estimate that {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars were spent to equip Egyptian and republican Yemeni forces, and in addition, Moscow refurbished the Al-Rawda Airfield outside San'a. The politburo saw a chance to gain a toehold on the Arabian Peninsula and accepted hundreds of Egyptian officers to be trained as pilots for service in the Yemen War.|$|E
25|$|Not <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> in {{the lungs}} can be {{expelled}} during maximally forced exhalation. This is the residual volume of about 1.0-1.5liters which cannot be measured by spirometry. Volumes that include the residual volume (i.e. functional residual capacity of about 2.5-3.0liters, and total lung capacity of about 6liters) can therefore also not be measured by spirometry. Their measurement requires special techniques.|$|E
25|$|Between 1914 and 1954 an {{electric}} tug {{was used to}} pull boats through the tunnel. In 1954 a large fan was constructed at the south portal. While all the boats are within the tunnel an airtight door is shut and <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> is pulled through the tunnel by the fan. This allows diesel boats to use the tunnel without suffocating the boaters. Today the journey takes about 30–40 minutes.|$|E

25|$|In physiology, {{dead space}} is {{the volume of}} air which is inhaled that does not {{take part in the}} gas exchange, either because it remains in the {{conducting}} airways, or reaches alveoli that are not perfused or poorly perfused. In other words, not <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> in each breath is available for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Mammals breathe in and out of their lungs, wasting that part of the inspiration which remains in the conducting airways where no gas exchange can occur. In humans, about a third of every resting breath has no change in O2 and CO2 levels.|$|E
25|$|A flow bench {{consists}} of an air pump of some sort, a metering element, pressure and temperature measuring instruments such as manometers, and various controls. The test piece is attached in series with the pump and measuring element and air is pumped through the whole system. Therefore, <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> passing through the metering element also passes through the test piece. Because the volume flow rate through the metering element is known and the flow through the test piece is the same, it is also known. The mass flow rate can be calculated using the known pressure and temperature data to calculate air densities, and multiplying by the volume flow rate.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the methods}} to {{determine}} {{the performance of a}} heat sink is to use heat transfer and fluid dynamics theory. One such method has been published by Jeggels, et al., though this work is limited to ducted flow. Ducted flow is where the air is forced to flow through a channel which fits tightly over the heat sink. This makes sure that <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> goes through the channels formed by the fins of the heat sink. When the air flow is not ducted, a certain percentage of air flow will bypass the heat sink. Flow bypass was found to increase with increasing fin density and clearance, while remaining relatively insensitive to inlet duct velocity.|$|E

25|$|Nixon had {{escalated}} U.S. {{involvement in}} Cambodia by authorizing the secret Operation Menu bombings {{and by the}} time of Sihanouk's ouster, the program had been in operation for 14 months. Lon Nol promptly ordered North Vietnamese personnel out of the country. North Vietnam responded with an invasion of the country launched at the explicit request of the Khmer Rouge following negotiations with Nuon Chea. Nixon then authorized a series of incursions by U.S. and South Vietnamese ground forces that began on 30 April. With intelligence on communist Base Areas in eastern Cambodia gleaned from MACSOG, huge stockpiles of PAVN arms, ammunition, and supplies were overrun and captured. In May, Operation Freedom Deal, a continuous aerial campaign against the PAVN/Viet Cong and the Khmer Rouge was initiated. SOG recon teams in Cambodia now had <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> support that they needed.|$|E

He says I am going on all right, but of course I feel rather a wreck". She died the following day of a heart attack. John Unterecker believes Olivia's death shattered Yeats, who died only months later, because she added warmth to his life. Yeats wrote of her death:Olivia Shakespear has died suddenly. For more than forty years she has been the centre of my life in London and during all that time we have never had a quarrel, sadness sometimes but never a difference. When I first met her she was in her late twenties but in looks a lovely young girl. When she died she was a lovely old woman... She came of a long line of soldiers and during the last war thought it her duty to stay in London through <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> raids. She was not more lovely than distinguished—no matter what happened she never lost her solitude... For the moment I cannot bear the thought of London. I will find her memory everywhere.|$|E

2500|$|A {{widely used}} method for heat {{sterilization}} is the [...] autoclave, sometimes called a converter or steam sterilizer. Autoclaves use steam heated to 121-134°C under pressure. To achieve sterility, {{the article is}} placed in a chamber and heated by injected steam until the article reaches a time and temperature setpoint. [...] Almost <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> {{is removed from the}} chamber, because air is undesired in the moist heat sterilization process (this is one trait that differ from a typical pressure cooker used for food cooking). The article is held at the temperature setpoint {{for a period of time}} which varies depending on what bioburden is present on the article being sterilized and its resistance (D-value) to steam sterilization. A general cycle would be anywhere between 3 and 15 minutes, (depending on the generated heat) at 121°C at 100 kPa, which is sufficient to provide a sterility assurance level of 10−4 for a product with a bioburden of 106 and a D-value of 2.0 minutes. Following sterilization, liquids in a pressurized autoclave must be cooled slowly to avoid boiling over when the pressure is released. This may be achieved by gradually depressurizing the sterilization chamber and allowing liquids to evaporate under a negative pressure, while cooling the contents.|$|E
2500|$|A 1908 {{paper by}} Geiger, On the Scattering of α-Particles by Matter, {{describes}} the following experiment. He constructed a long glass tube, nearly two meters in length. [...] At {{one end of}} the tube was a quantity of [...] "radium emanation" [...] (R) that served as a source of alpha particles. [...] The opposite end of the tube was covered with a phosphorescent screen (Z). [...] In the middle of the tube was a 0.9mm-wide slit. [...] The alpha particles from R passed through the slit and created a glowing patch of light on the screen. [...] A microscope (M) was used to count the scintillations on the screen and measure their spread. [...] Geiger pumped <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> out of the tube so that the alpha particles would be unobstructed, and they left a neat and tight image on the screen that corresponded to the shape of the slit. [...] Geiger then allowed some air in the tube, and the glowing patch became more diffuse. [...] Geiger then pumped out the air and placed some gold foil over the slit at AA. [...] This too caused the patch of light on the screen to become more spread out. [...] This experiment demonstrated that both air and solid matter could markedly scatter alpha particles. [...] The apparatus, however, could only observe small angles of deflection. [...] Rutherford wanted to know if the alpha particles were being scattered by even larger angles—perhaps larger than 90°.|$|E
