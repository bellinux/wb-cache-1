40|$|The {{availability}} of {{safe and effective}} animal vaccines is critical {{for the prevention of}} animal disease. <b>Adventitious</b> <b>agent</b> testing is done on master seed viruses prior to vaccine licensure to ensure that no biological contaminants were introduced during manufacture. Traditional <b>adventitious</b> <b>agent</b> testing is performed using a variety of cell culture lines and a panel of polymerase chain reaction tests. The purpose of this research was to determine if new technologies like DNA microarray and next-generation sequencing (NGS) could be of any benefit for <b>adventitious</b> <b>agent</b> testing. A literature review describes the state of the field and the challenges {{that will have to be}} addressed to use these technologies in a regulatory environment. Both techniques were tested on a panel of mammalian and avian viruses, and each virus was tested individually and in combination with other viruses.

40|$|Vaccines {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{effective}} public health medicinal products with an excellent safety record. As vaccines are produced using biological materials, there is a need to safeguard against potential contamination with adventitious agents. Adventitious agents could be inadvertently introduced into a vaccine through starting materials used for production. Therefore, extensive testing has been recommended at specific stages of vaccine manufacture to demonstrate the absence of adventitious agents. Additionally, the incorporation of viral clearance steps in the manufacturing process can aid in reducing the risk of <b>adventitious</b> <b>agent</b> contamination. However, for live viral vaccines, aside from possible purification of the virus or vector, extensive <b>adventitious</b> <b>agent</b> clearance may not be feasible. In the event that an <b>adventitious</b> <b>agent</b> is detected in a vaccine, it is important to determine its origin, evaluate its potential for human infection and pathology, and discern which batches of vaccine may have been affected in order to take risk mitigation action. To achieve this, it is necessary to have archived samples of the vaccine and ancillary components, ideally from developmental through to current batches, as well as samples of the biological materials used in the manufacture of the vaccine, since these are the most likely sources of an <b>adventitious</b> <b>agent.</b> The need for formal guidance on such vaccine sample archiving has been recognized but not fulfilled. We summarize in this paper several prior major cases of vaccine contamination with adventitious agents and provide points for consideration on sample archiving of live recombinant viral vector vaccines for use in humans.

40|$|AbstractSince the {{earliest}} days of biological product manufacture, {{there have been a number}} of instances where laboratory studies provided evidence for the presence of adventitious agents in a marketed product. Lessons learned from such events can be used to strengthen regulatory preparedness for the future. We have therefore selected four instances where an <b>adventitious</b> <b>agent,</b> or a signal suggesting the presence of an agent, was found in a viral vaccine, and have developed a case study for each. The four cases are: a) SV 40 in polio vaccines; b) bacteriophage in measles and polio vaccines; c) reverse transcriptase in measles and mumps vaccines; and d) porcine circovirus and porcine circovirus DNA sequences in rotavirus vaccines. The lessons learned from each event are discussed. Based in part on those experiences, certain scientific principles have been identified by WHO that should be considered in regulatory risk evaluation if an <b>adventitious</b> <b>agent</b> is found in a marketed vaccine in the future...|$|E

The consequent interruption in supply of Fabrazyme and Cerezyme (drugs used to treat Fabry and Gaucher disease respectively), caused significant economic losses. Vesivirus 2117 {{is a member of the}} Caliciviridae; a family of small icosahedral viruses encoding a positive sense RNA genome. We have used cryo-electron microscopy and three dimensional image reconstruction to calculate a structure of vesivirus 2117 virus like particles as well as feline calicivirus and a chimeric sapovirus. We present a structural comparison of several members of the Caliciviridae, showing that the distal P domain of vesivirus 2117 is morphologically distinct from that seen in other known vesivirus structures. Furthermore, at intermediate resolutions we found a high level of structural similarity between vesivirus 2117 and Caliciviridae from other genera, such as sapovirus and rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus. Phylogenetic analysis confirms vesivirus 2117 as a vesivirus closely related to canine vesiviruses.

40|$|Human Rhinovirus {{infection}} {{is an important}} precursor to asthma and {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} exacerbations and the Human Viral Challenge model may provide a powerful tool in studying these and other chronic respiratory diseases. In this study we have reported the production and human characterisation of a new Wild-Type HRV- 16 challenge virus produced specifically for this purpose. A HRV- 16 isolate from an 18 year old experimentally infected healthy female volunteer (University of Virginia Children's Hospital, USA) was obtained with appropriate medical history and consent. We manufactured a new HRV- 16 stock by minimal passage in a WI- 38 cell line under Good Manufacturing Practice conditions. Having first subjected the stock to rigorous <b>adventitious</b> <b>agent</b> testing and determining the virus suitability for human use, we conducted an initial safety and pathogenicity clinical study in adult volunteers in our dedicated clinical quarantine facility in London. In this study we have demonstrated the new Wild-Type HRV- 16 Challenge Virus to be both safe and pathogenic, causing an appropriate level of disease in experimentally inoculated healthy adult volunteers. Furthermore, by inoculating volunteers with a range of different inoculum titres, we have established the minimum inoculum titre required to achieve reproducible disease. We have demonstrated that although inoculation titres as low as 1 TCID 50 can produce relatively high infection rates, the optimal titre for progression with future HRV challenge model development with this virus stock was 10 TCID 50.

40|$|Influenza and its {{associated}} diseases are {{a major cause of}} morbidity and mortality. The United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends influenza vaccination for everyone over 6 months of age. The failure of the flu vaccine in 2014 - 2015 demonstrates the need for a model that allows the rapid development of novel antivirals, universal/intra-seasonal vaccines, immunomodulators, monoclonal antibodies and other novel treatments. To this end we manufactured a new H 3 N 2 influenza virus in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practice for use in the Human Viral Challenge Model. We chose an H 3 N 2 influenza subtype, rather than H 1 N 1, given that this strain has the most substantial impact in terms of morbidity or mortality annually as described by the Centre for Disease Control. We first subjected the virus batch to rigorous <b>adventitious</b> <b>agent</b> testing, confirmed the virus to be wild-type by Sanger sequencing and determined the virus titres appropriate for human use via the established ferret model. We built on our previous experience with other H 3 N 2 and H 1 N 1 viruses to develop this unique model.

40|$|Abstract Background The insect {{cell line}} is a {{critical}} component {{in the production of}} recombinant proteins in the baculovirus expression system and new cell lines hold the promise of increasing both quantity and quality of protein production. Results Seventy cell lines were established by single-cell cloning from a primary culture of cells derived from eggs of the black witch moth (Ascalapha odorata; Lepidoptera, Noctuidae). Among 8 rapidly growing lines, cell line 38 (Ao 38) was selected for further analysis, based on susceptibility to AcMNPV infection and production of secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) from a baculovirus expression vector. In comparisons with low-passage High Five (BTI-Tn- 5 B 1 - 4) cells, infected Ao 38 cells produced β-galactosidase and SEAP at levels higher (153 % and 150 %, respectively) than those measured from High Five cells. Analysis of N-glycans of SEAP produced in Ao 38 cells revealed two N-glycosylation sites and glycosylation patterns similar to those reported for High Five and Sf 9 cells. Glycopeptide isoforms consisted of pauci- or oligomannose, with and without fucose on N-acetylglucosamine(s) linked to asparagine residues. Estimates of Ao 38 cell volume suggest that Ao 38 cells are approximately 2. 5 × larger than Sf 9 cells but only approximately 74 % of the size of High Five cells. Ao 38 cells were highly susceptible to AcMNPV infection, similar to infectivity of Sf 9 cells. Production of infectious AcMNPV budded virions from Ao 38 cells peaked at approximately 4. 5 × 10 7 IU/ml, exceeding that from High Five cells while lower than that from Sf 9 cells. Ao 38 cells grew rapidly in stationary culture with a population doubling time of 20. 2 hr, and Ao 38 cells were readily adapted to serum-free medium (Sf- 900 III) and to a suspension culture system. Analysis of Ao 38 and a parental Ascalapha odorata cell line indicated that these lines were free of the alphanodavirus that was recently identified as an <b>adventitious</b> <b>agent</b> in High Five cell lines. Conclusions Ao 38 cells represent a highly productive new insect cell line that will be useful for heterologous protein expression and other applications in biotechnology. </p...|$|E

Neonatal foreskins are used as the source of keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts for the manufacture of LSEs. Following isolation and expansion in vitro, the cells are cultured on a 3 -dimensional scaffold to give an upper epidermal layer and supporting dermal layer.

40|$|During {{the last}} three decades, animal cell culturing has been {{essential}} for biomedical research and biotechnological activities in general. Along with this increasing importance, biosafety concerns have pointed to the risks of manipulating animal cell cultures for {{human health and the}} environment. A maximal reduction of these risks necessitates a thorough risk assessment of the cell cultures used. It involves an evaluation of both the intrinsic properties of the cell culture, including subsequent properties acquired as a result of genetic modification, and the possibility that the cell culture may inadvertently or deliberately become contaminated with pathogens. The latter is a major hazard associated with the manipulation of animal cell cultures, as <b>adventitious</b> <b>agents</b> may be pathogenic and have a better capacity to survive in unfavorable conditions. Consequently, most of the containment measures primarily aim at protecting cells from adventitious contamination. Therefore, a comprehensive evaluation of the risks encountered during the handling of cell cultures should include considerations regarding the type of manipulation as well. As a rule, cell cultures known to harbor an infectious etiologic agent should be manipulated in compliance with containment measures recommended for the etiologic agent. With the exception of very well-characterized cell cultures for which the use of a type II biosafety cabinet depends on the origin of the cells, work with cell cultures from human or primate origin should generally and minimally be performed under containment level 2 using a type II biosafety cabinet. In every case, containment measures should minimize adventitious contamination of the cell cultures and offer a maximal protection of human health and the environment...|$|R
40|$|The bone morhogenetic {{proteins}} (BMPs) are a {{group of}} dimeric proteins in the trasforming growth factor- (TGF-) based on amino acid homology. More than 20 BMPs have been identified, several of which have significant osteogenic effects. Since these proteins govern the three key steps in the bone induction cascade (chemotaxis and mitosis of mesenchymal cells, differentiation into cartilage and then replacement by bone) BMPs are true pleiotropic morphogens. The biological action are mediated via specific BMP receptors found on the cell surface. These are serine/threonine kinases that phosphorylate intracellular proteins called Smads. The activated Smads are then traslocated to the nucleus, where they regulate either positive or negative expression of genes involved in bone formation. There are different BMPs sources to use in orthopaedic practice. The available amounts of BMPs, the morbidity associated with harvesting of the graft and the variability in success rate are issues {{to be considered in}} autografting. The osteoinductive capacity of allograft (mineralized or demineralized) is highly variable and may be inadequate for any bone-inductive effect in humans.

However, residual hamster DNA, but not RNA, containing novel endogenous gammaretrovirus sequences was detected in the JEV vaccine using PCR. Metagenomics analysis did not detect any adventitious viral sequences of public health concern. Intracisternal A particle sequences closest to those present in Syrian hamsters and not mice were also detected in the JEV SA- 14 - 14 - 2 vaccine. Combined, these {{results are consistent with}} the production of the JEV vaccine in Syrian hamster cells. We found no evidence of XMRV and MLV in eight live attenuated human vaccines further supporting the safety of these vaccines. Our findings suggest that vaccines are an unlikely source of XMRV and MLV exposure in humans and are consistent with the mounting evidence on the absence of these viruses in humans...|$|R
40|$|Stem cells {{seem very}} {{promising}} {{in the treatment}} of degenerative neurological diseases for which there are currently no or limited therapeutic strategies. However, their clinical application meets many regulatory hurdles. This article gives an overview of stem cells, their potential healing capacities as well as their identified and potential risks, such as tumor formation, unwanted immune responses and the transmission of <b>adventitious</b> <b>agents.</b> As there is no clinical experience with embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells (as the result of their unacceptable risk on tumor formation), most attention will be paid to fresh autologous adult stem cells (ASCs). To evaluate eventual clinical benefits, preclinical studies are essential, though their value is limited as in these studies, various types of stem cells, with different histories of procurement and culturing, are applied in various concentrations by various routes of administration. On top of that, in most animal studies allogenic human, thus non-autologous, stem cells are applied, which might mask the real effects. More reliable, though small-sized, clinical trials with autologous ASCs did show satisfying clinical benefits in regenerative medicine, without major health concerns. One should wonder, though, why it is so hard to get compelling evidence for the healing and renewing capacities of these stem cells when these cells indeed are really essential for tissue repair during life. Why so many hurdles have to be taken before health authorities such as the European Medicine Agency (EMA) and/or the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approve stem cells {{in the treatment of}} (especially no-option) patients. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Wien...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAs {{a series}} of endeavors to {{establish}} suitable measures for the sound development of regenerative medicine using human stem cell-based products, we studied scientific principles, concepts, and basic technical elements {{to ensure the quality}} and safety of therapeutic products derived from allogeneic human somatic stem cells, taking into consideration scientific and technological advances, ethics, regulatory rationale, and international trends in human stem cell-derived products. This {{led to the development of}} the Japanese official Notification No. 0907 - 3, “Guideline on Ensuring the Quality and Safety of Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Derived from the Processing of Allogeneic Human Somatic Stem Cells,” issued by Pharmaceuticals and Food Safety Bureau, Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare of Japan, on September 7, 2012. The present paper describes the background information and development of our study and the resulting guidance. For products derived from allogeneic somatic stem cells, major points to consider include 1) history, the source, and derivation of starting cells; 2) donor screening/testing and donor eligibility, especially in relation to the presence of <b>adventitious</b> <b>agents,</b> potential occurrence of donor-derived diseases, and immunocompatibility; 3) clinical records of a donor; 4) multipotency and self-replication ability of allogeneic human somatic stem cells; 5) cell banking; 6) potential presence of viruses in the final product; 7) extensive characterization of the cells at critical stage(s) of manufacture; 8) robustness of the manufacturing process; 9) quality consistency of the products such as the final products and critical intermediate(s) if any; and 10) robust application and function of the final products in a cell environment different from where the original cells were localized and were performing their natural endogenous function. The ultimate goal of this guidance is to provide suitable medical opportunities as soon as possible to the patients with severe diseases that are difficult to treat with conventional modalities...|$|R
40|$|The SA 14 - 14 - 2 JE {{vaccine is}} a live, {{attenuated}} vaccine. It {{was developed and}} is produced for domestic use and export by Chengdu Institute of Biological Products Co., Ltd. (CDIBP), China. The vaccine name derives from the virus strain used in the vaccine, the SA 14 - 14 - 2 JE virus. Vaccine development The SA 14 - 14 - 2 live JE vaccine strain was obtained from its wild-type SA 14 parent by serial passages in cell cultures (primary hamster kidney cells) and in animals (mice, hamsters) with successive plaque purifications (in primary chick embryo cells). The master seed virus of the SA 14 - 14 - 2 live JE virus strain was screened for and shown {{to be free of}} adventitious viruses at Q-One Biotech, United Kingdom. The primary hamster kidney cell line used to prepare the vaccine was also certified pathogen free. The manufacturer similarly tests all vaccine lots for <b>adventitious</b> <b>agents</b> as part of its quality assurance processes. Vaccine production and quality control The vaccine is produced in accordance with technical specifications in “Guidelines for the production and control of Japanese encephalitis vaccine (live) for human use ” developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) Expert Committee on Biological Standardization. 1 Although there are several producers of the vaccine in China, CDIBP is the only currently authorized export manufacturer of the WHO prequalified vaccine. CDIBP has the capacity to produce 80 million doses annually. History of vaccine use The vaccine has been used for more than 20 years, and more than 400 million doses have been administered in China and other Asian countries. Other countries that have licensed and/or used the vaccine include Nepal...|$|R
40|$|The high {{mutation}} rate of influenza virus results in antigenic drift, meaning {{that each of}} the three components in the trivalent influenza vaccine are updated regularly so that the vaccine antigen closely matches the predominant or emerging strain. The production of influenza vaccines from the chosen seed has relied on embryonated chickens eggs for more than 40 years. Recent technological advances have resulted in the evaluation of several cell lines as alternative substrates for influenza vaccine production. Reverse genetics of influenza viruses allows the creation of viruses at will from cDNA. However, licensed cell lines have so far proved unpermissive for virus rescue and permissive lines remain largely unlicensed. A reverse genetics system for the production of influenza vaccines in PER. C 6 cells has been developed and optimised. Many recent clinical isolates do not grow in eggs and hence require reassortment with a high growth, egg permissive backbone. <b>Adventitious</b> <b>agents</b> aside, cell lines able to support growth of clinical isolates could be used directly included in the vaccine, without the need for reassortment. However, this could lead to year on year variation in the quality and characteristics of the vaccine. Particularly pertinent, is the variation in the amount of IFN a clinical isolate can induce, which could severely limit yields. Yields and effects of IFN for a panel of high and low inducing viruses are investigated in a number of potential vaccine cell lines. The mechanisms behind virus IFN induction have been investigated. Using a panel of high and low inducing viruses the differences in growth and viral protein expressions, and activation of PRR has been analysed. The IFN response in PER. C 6 cells has been characterised. Through an improved understanding of the mechanisms of IFN induction and inhibition, antagonists could be introduced into the vaccine cell line to improve yields.

40|$|The {{consequences}} of <b>adventitious</b> infectious <b>agents</b> upon {{the interpretation of}} toxicology studies performed in rats and mice are incompletely understood. Several prevalent murine pathogens cause alterations of the respiratory system that can confuse the assessment of chemically induced airway injury. In some instances the pathogenesis of infection with these agents has been relatively well studied in the lower respiratory tract. However, there are few well-controlled studies that have examined the upper respiratory region, which result in interpretive problems for toxicologic pathologists. The conduct and interpretation of both short-term and chronic rodent bioassays can be compromised by both the clinical and subclinical manifestations of infectious diseases. This paper reviews several important infectious diseases of the upper airway of rats and mice and discusses the potential influence of these conditions {{on the results of}} toxicology studies...|$|R
