To stimulate adolescents’ {{civic engagement}}, influencing factors should be investigated to determine in what way adolescents could be motivated. The current research focused on parental influences on adolescents’ civic engagement. The influences of socio-economic status, parental warmth and support, parental civic engagement, and the transmission of social responsibility were investigated. Civic engagement was divided into political participation, such as voting during elections, and <b>alternative</b> <b>participation,</b> such as community involvement or volunteering. A survey research including 186 participants between fourteen and twenty-three years old was conducted. The results showed parental civic engagement is linked to adolescents’ political and <b>alternative</b> <b>participation.</b> However, the other variables did not predict adolescents’ political and <b>alternative</b> <b>participation.</b> In addition, no relation between age and adolescents’ civic engagement was found. This research shows that stimulating parental civic engagement {{could be used to}} increase the level of adolescents’ civic engagement...|$|R

The TV crew creates a live representation, which is witness to, and utilizes, the ordinary intelligibility of speech exchanges. The paper proposes {{the analysis of the}} filming of a short sequence. A first participation framework is made visible on the screen through a succession of shots presenting the panellist currently talking and his opponents. An <b>alternative</b> <b>participation</b> framework emerges when a new shot shows the host of the debate, who has not appeared on screen during the panellist's turn at talk. That shot makes visible the host's impending turn-taking. The resources for such an anticipation of participation frame shifting lie {{in the design of the}} panellist's turn. The turn moves from a critique of his adversaries to an accusation of partiality addressed to the host. During that sequence, the right to talk becomes what is at stake. Professional (TV) filming of talk appears then as liable to align with and make visible one of the <b>alternative</b> <b>participation</b> frameworks...|$|R

Using a queered approach to Cultural Studies, this study aims at intervening in the continuous reproduction of a normative White and straight Metal masculinity. Collecting data from five ethnographic interviews with queer Metalheads and additional autoethnographic data, it shows how queer Metalheads organise their participation in Heavy Metal and create an alternative Metal cosmology.

40|$|To {{explore the}} {{readability}} and content integrity of informed consent forms (ICFs) used in China and {{to compare the}} quality of Chinese local ICFs with that of international ICFs. The length, readability and content of 155 consent documents from phase II-IV drug clinical trials from the Third Xiangya Hospital Ethics Committee from November 2009 to January 2015 were evaluated. Reading difficulty was tested using a readability formula adapted for the Chinese language. An ICF checklist containing 27 required elements was successfully constructed to evaluate content integrity. The description of <b>alternatives</b> to <b>participation</b> was assessed. The quality of ICFs from different sponsorships were also compared. Among the 155 evaluable trials, the ICFs had a median length of 5286 words, corresponding to 7 pages. The median readability score was 4. 31 (4. 02 - 4. 41), with 63. 9 % at the 2 nd level and 36. 1 % at the 3 rd level. Five of the 27 elements were frequently neglected. The average score for the description of <b>alternatives</b> to <b>participation</b> was 1. 06, and 27. 7 % of the ICFs did not mention any alternatives. Compared with Chinese local ICFs, international ICFs were longer, more readable and contained more of the required elements (P < 0. 05). The ICFs used in China were difficult to read for most participants. These forms had poor description of <b>alternatives</b> to <b>participation,</b> and failed to provide {{a high degree of}} information disclosure, including an explanation of informed consent, follow-up processing of the data/sample, inclusion/exclusion criteria, double blinding, and unpredictable risks. International ICFs had better readability and content integrity than Chinese local ICFs. More efforts should thus be made {{to improve the quality of}} consent documents in China...|$|R

40|$|Physical {{activity}} {{participation is}} {{widely recognized as}} {{a critical component of}} health and development for children with and without disabilities. Emergent literature reflects a paradigm shift in the conceptualization of childhood physical activity as a multi-dimensional construct, encompassing aspects of physical performance and self-perceived engagement. However, ambiguity remains around how participation as a health construct is integrated into physical activity research. The primary objective of the present mini-review is to critically examine current conceptual and methodological approaches to examining physical activity participation among children with disabilities. We conducted a systematic review of contemporary literature (published between 2000 and 2016). 17 articles met inclusion criteria and their research approach was classified into guiding framework, definition of the key construct, and measurement used. The primary guiding framework was the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. An explicit definition of physical activity participation was absent from all studies. Eight studies (47 %) operationalized physical activity and participation as independent constructs. Measurements included traditional performance-based aspects of physical activity (frequency, duration, intensity), and <b>alternative</b> <b>participation</b> measures (subjective perception of involvement, inclusion or enjoyment). 64 % of included articles were published {{in the past two years}} (2014 - 2016) indicating a rising interest in the topic of physical activity participation. Drawing from the broader discussion of participation in the literature we offer a working definition of physical activity participation as it pertains to active, health-associated behaviors. Further description of alternative approaches to framing and measuring physical activity participation are offered to support effective assessment of health status among disabled children...|$|R

The article suggests that everyday politics is a useful concept in understanding alternative forms of political activism and calls for broader definitions of political participation, including those that do not have a social change agenda.

40|$|In the {{literature}} on the relationship between participation in decision making and performance, a tell-and-sell strategy is considered a viable <b>alternative</b> to <b>participation.</b> In contrast, we argue that in organizational settings, when a sensitive and important issue is at stake, participation of a form to be characterized as formal, long term, direct, and {{with a high degree of}} participant influence is more effective than a tell-and-sell strategy. Using a quasi-experimental design with a participation, a tell-and-sell, and a control condition, a ProMES performance management system was implemented in the field service department of a Dutch supplier of photocopiers. Outcome feedback to individual technicians resulted in an average performance increase in the participation condition that was significantly higher than the increase found in the tell-and-sell condition. Satisfaction with the program, and the perceived usefulness of the feedback, were significantly higher in the participation condition. In both experimental conditions, the performance increase was significant compared to the control condition.

40|$|Most of {{the lessons}} learned for policy makers from past {{international}} negotiations have been derived from descriptive assessments of particular cases taken one at a time. The objective {{of this study is}} to develop a truly comparative and systematic approach to negotiation analysis that will provide the capability to draw lessons from a larger and more representative data base of negotiation cases. Structured interviews were conducted with 23 Austrian diplomats to gather information about particular international negotiation cases that they personally participated in. These interviews were coded into a taxonomy of important negotiation elements to develop a data base that describes each negotiation case as a profile of 35 key factors. These data were then analyzed systematically to derive a better understanding of the process of international negotiation and how that process leads to successful outcomes or deadlock. One of the most important findings is the effectiveness of bilateral negotiations. They are more likely than multilateral negotiations to be characterized by successful treaties, low delegation turnover, friendly political relations, and deadlines that are met. Bilateral negotiations may be a more cost-effective <b>alternative</b> to <b>participation</b> in multilateral forums: fewer transaction costs and better outcomes...|$|R
