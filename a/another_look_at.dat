Reacting to these criticisms, in March 2005 New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg announced that he opposed the rail tunnel project. However, in early July 2007, Mayor Bloomberg told Rep.

500|$|The {{screenplay}} for the sequel {{was written by}} Eric Roth in 2001. It {{is based on the}} original novel's sequel, Gump and Co. written by Winston Groom in 1995. Roth's script begins with Forrest sitting on a bench waiting for his son to return from school. After the September 11 attacks, Roth, Zemeckis, and Hanks decided the story was no longer [...] "relevant."

500|$|Within days of Rockefeller's announcement, Agnew {{was being}} wooed by {{supporters}} of {{the former vice president}} Richard Nixon, whose campaign for the Republican nomination was well under way. Agnew had no antagonism towards Nixon, and in the wake of Rockefeller's withdrawal had indicated that Nixon might be his [...] "second choice". When the two met in New York on March 29 they found an easy rapport. Agnew's words and actions after the April disturbances in Baltimore delighted conservative members of the Nixon camp such as Pat Buchanan, and also impressed Nixon. When on April 30 Rockefeller re-entered the race, Agnew's reaction was cool. He commended the governor as potentially a [...] "formidable candidate" [...] but did not commit his support: [...] "A lot of things have happened since his withdrawal... I think I've got to take <b>another</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> this situation".|$|E
500|$|Allusions to the {{painting}} were common in vaudeville acts, becoming stock gags in the Orpheum Circuit. Stage imitations of {{the painting}} were also created. In 1913, for instance, Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr. cast Ann Pennington as the model {{as part of his}} Follies. In this successful version of September Morn, the subject bore a sheer cape, with leaves placed strategically over her body, and stood on a stage made-up as water. A burlesque act, deeming itself the [...] "September Morning Glories", was also created, as was a three-act musical based on the painting. The latter– featuring a fifty-strong chorus line– was put on by Arthur Gillespie and Frank Tannehill, Jr. and debuted at the La Salle Theater in Chicago. In Milwaukee, a man wearing [...] "little or no clothing" [...] passed himself off as [...] "September Morn" [...] at the 1915 Wisconsin State Fair; he was brought to trial and fined $25. Theatrical references {{to the painting}} continued into the 1950s. For instance, in Tennessee Williams's 1957 play Orpheus Descending, the character Val sees it hanging in his room and mentions he [...] "might keep turning the light on to take <b>another</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it".|$|E

500|$|The court {{considered}} that Thomas had been regularly informed by {{all those who}} had interrogated him that {{the degree to which}} he cooperated would determine what happened to him, and that given their position as authority figures, Thomas would have readily perceived that they had the ability to change his situation; indeed, none of the interviewers had done anything to dispel the idea that {{they would be able to}} help Thomas. The court also pointed out that even if actions such as showing Thomas photographs of his family and letters from them could not be said to be deliberately improper, as the trial judge seemed to indicate would be necessary to characterise them as inducements, there was no way that they could be interpreted by someone in Thomas' position, other than as indications that if he cooperated he would be reunited with his family. Particularly, after Thomas expressed happiness at seeing the photographs, one of the interviewers took them away, saying [...] " [...] might give you <b>another</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> that later", comments which were [...] "calculated, if not intended, to remind the applicant that he was dependent on his captors and interviewers for favours." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2015, McAdams starred with Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo and Stanley Tucci as {{journalist}} Sacha Pfeiffer in Tom McCarthy's Spotlight, Academy Award's Best Picture winner drama, {{about the}} child-abuse scandal in Boston's Catholic Church. To prepare for her role, McAdams {{spent time with}} Pfeiffer. The movie garnered universal critical acclaim, mainly for its detailed story and the cast performances. Justin Chang of Variety felt she [...] "imbues Pfeiffer with sensitivity and grit." [...] Nonetheless, he was surprised by McAdams' subsequent Academy Award nomination: [...] " [...] has the sort of fine-grained subtlety that voters too rarely notice. Take <b>another</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> that scene in which she gently, skillfully encourages an abuse survivor to lay bare his most lacerating secrets—a small master class in how {{the simple act of}} listening can become a conduit for compassion." [...] For her role, McAdams received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, Critics' Choice Movie Award for Best Supporting Actress and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations in the categories of Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Supporting Role and Outstanding Performance by a Cast in a Motion Picture.|$|E
500|$|After leaving college, Oppong {{took part}} in the draft combine for the newly-formed National Basketball League of Canada (NBL) in August 2011. He was later {{selected}} by the Halifax Rainmen as the 13th overall pick {{in the second round of}} the 2011 NBL Canada draft. He made his professional debut with the Rainmen on November 3, 2011, scoring 6 points and recording 4 rebounds in a loss to the London Lightning. Through the next seven games, he saw very limited playing time, spending over 10 minutes on the court in just three contests. After averaging three points per game, Oppong was released by Halifax in early December 2011. Nevertheless, he still drew the attention of Gary Durrant, the director of basketball operations for the Oshawa Power, who pursued Oppong in the draft combine itself. Oppong said, [...] "Gary actually called my agent and said they wanted me to come back to take <b>another</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> me. They liked me and it worked out." [...] He was pleased at the idea of joining the Power because of it was located very close to his hometown as well. Oppong made his first appearance for Oshawa on January 12, 2012, but was scoreless with 3 personal fouls vs the Summerside Storm. He scored a season-best 10 points on January 29, lifting his team to a victory over the Moncton Miracles.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from October 15, 1910. It states: [...] "Little Marie Allen, a penniless orphan, lives with her granddad. Out for a walk she admires a huge doll in a shop window. That night, after her granddad has fallen asleep, she slips out to have <b>another</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the doll. Arriving at the toy shop, she sees that the doll is gone. Unseen by anyone, she enters the store. She finds the wonderful doll and lifts it out of its box to admire it. Hearing a clerk approaching, she becomes frightened and gets into the doll box. The doll rolls under the counter. The clerk sends the errand boy off with the box, thinking it contains the doll, which has been ordered for Daisy Smythe, a rich little girl. Arriving at Daisy's house, Marie {{steps out of the}} box as soon as the room is empty. She removes the doll clothes from the box and admires them greatly. She decides to try them on, and soon a little cap, shoes and garments are on her figure. Then she hears Daisy coming and retreats to the box. Daisy enters and takes the supposed doll from the box, falls in love with it instantly and enthusiastically works its arms and limbs. Marie lives up to her role well, imitating with stiff, jerky movements of the limbs that belong to real dolls. Then Daisy eats, and Marie grows hungry as she watches. When Daisy sets down her bowl of milk, Marie reaches over and drinks it down. Daisy is amazed when she misses the milk. Marie helps herself to all the food and Daisy's wonderment is amusing to see. Finally Daisy falls asleep in her chair and Marie falls asleep on the floor. Here she is found by her granddad, who managed to trace her from the toy shop, and Daisy and her mother laugh so heartily over Marie's adventure that they reward her cleverness with - the doll itself!" ...|$|E
500|$|Hewett {{began the}} 1893 season in good form, {{reaching}} his half-century {{in each of}} his first three matches for the county, including a total of 94 against Oxford University in late May. Hewett missed most of the match against Kent shortly after, returning to Taunton due to the death of his brother-in-law, during which time George Wood replaced him as a substitute. In July 1893, the touring Australians played Somerset at Taunton {{for the first time since}} 1882, when both the ground and the county team were barely established. After the success of the 1892 season, and because talented, Australian-born Sammy Woods was playing for Somerset, the match was eagerly anticipated. Thousands arrived in Taunton for the match, but after overnight torrential rain, the umpires inspected the pitch at 11:00 and abandoned play for the day. In his history of the county club, Roebuck suggest that they may have been put under pressure by the Australians or by Hewett himself. The Somerset fans and members were angry at the decision, but the Australians packed picnic baskets and after exchanging strong words with the locals, departed for the Quantock Hills. Hewett, along with Woods and Vernon Hill, arranged to play golf in Minehead. The crowd continued to show their dismay at the decision, and eventually the Somerset officials asked the umpires to take <b>another</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the ground. Woods supported this decision in his reminiscences, claiming that [...] "the decision not to play was premature." [...] At 14:00, after their second inspection, the umpires retracted their previous decision and announced that play could start. Hewett reacted angrily, and argued unsuccessfully against the decision with the Somerset committee. The Australian players were recalled from their picnic, and play began at 16:00, although neither team particularly wanted to play. Roebuck recorded that [...] "Hewett, in particular, was in high dudgeon and... he threw away his wicket for 12 runs, having been dropped once." [...] David Foot offered a more tempered opinion, saying simply that Hewett's [...] "mind wasn't on the game." [...] No play was possible on the second day, and on the third, Australia won the match by six wickets. Hewett felt let down by the Somerset committee, who he felt had undermined his authority, prompting him to say that [...] "if a captain can't lead at Taunton, this is no place for him." [...] Although friends thought he was overreacting, he declared that he would resign from the captaincy and the club at the end of the season. Both Foot and Roebuck suggested that Hewett reacted in an over-sensitive and extreme manner, but that his lack of self-control may have limited his long-term captaincy prospects.|$|E
