40|$|A {{theory about}} how {{changes in the}} {{illuminant}} affect the color appearance of objects must specify how the visual system's adjustments to illuminant changes vary with the surface collection in a scene. I report an experiment designed to investigate this issue. The stimuli were CRT simulations of flat matte surfaces rendered under diffuse illumination. For all combinations of 7 daylight illuminants and 12 collections of surface reflectances the subject's <b>achromatic</b> <b>locus</b> was measured on an isoluminant plane in color space. For any surface collection {{the changes in the}} <b>achromatic</b> <b>locus</b> could be well approximated by a linear transformation of the illuminant changes. These linear transformations showed relatively small variation with the surface collection. To first approximation, these results suggest that the effect of changes in the illuminant on color appearance can be described linearly and that it can be separated from the surface collection. There was an effect of the surface collection on the <b>achromatic</b> <b>locus.</b> The data rejected the idea that a surface collection's mean reflectance function might capture this effect, ruling out models of color appearance that are based on this kind of averag-ing assumption. 1...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. We {{assessed}} chromatic sensitivity {{along the}} protan, the deutan, and the tritan line (Cambridge Colour Test, CRS Ltd.), the loci {{of the unique}} hues (red, green, yellow, blue) and the <b>achromatic</b> <b>locus</b> (neutral grey) for a very large sample (n= 185) of colour-normal observers ranging from 18 to 75 years of age. Visual judgements were obtained under normal viewing conditions using broad-band self-luminous stimuli (CRT) under controlled adaptation conditions. Results. Trivector discrimination thresholds increased {{as a function of}} age along the protan, the deutan, and the tritan axis (with coefficient of determination of R 2 > 0. 1), with the largest increase being present along the tritan line, which is consistent with the known age-related changes in the lens. We find less pronounced shifts in unique hue settings. Unique red and unique yellow settings do not change with age. Unique blue shifts towards green and unique green shift towards yellow; however, the coefficient of determination is very small in both cases (R 2 < 0. 1). Similarly, the locus of neutral grey is not affected by age (R 2 < 0. 1). Conclusion. We conclude that the chromatic sensitivity deterioriates significantly with age, whereas the appearance of unique hues and neutral grey is much less affected remaining almost constant despite the known changes in the ocular media. Our study provides useful normative data both for sensitivity and appearance changes with ageing...|$|E
40|$|An {{achromatic}} stimulus {{is defined as}} a patch of light that is devoid of any hue. This is usually achieved by asking observers to adjust the stimulus such that it looks neither red nor green {{and at the same time}} neither yellow nor blue. Despite the theoretical and practical importance of the <b>achromatic</b> <b>locus,</b> little is known about the variability in these settings. The main purpose of the current study was to evaluate whether achromatic settings were dependent on the task of the observers, namely the navigation direction in color space. Observers could either adjust the test patch along the two chromatic axes in the CIE u*v* diagram or, alternatively, navigate along the unique-hue lines. Our main result is that the navigation method affects the reliability of these achromatic settings. Observers are able to make more reliable achromatic settings when adjusting the test patch along the directions defined by the four unique hues as opposed to navigating along the main axes in the commonly used CIE u*v* chromaticity plane. This result holds across different ambient viewing conditions (Dark, Daylight, Cool White Fluorescent) and different test luminance levels (5, 20, and 50 cd/m 2). The reduced variability in the achromatic settings is consistent with the idea that internal color representations are more aligned with the unique-hue lines than the u* and v* axes.

40|$|The {{spectral}} {{sensitivity of the}} visual system varies markedly between the fovea and surrounding periphery owing {{in part to the}} rapid fall in macular pigment density with eccentricity. We examined how colour appearance changes between the fovea and near periphery (8 °) by measuring <b>achromatic</b> <b>loci</b> and the loci of unique and binary hues. Chosen colours remained much more similar at the two locations than predicted by the change in {{spectral sensitivity}}. Compensation for white may reflect long-term gain changes within the cones that equate sensitivity for the local average stimulus in the fovea and periphery. However, adjusting only to the average stimulus cannot correct for all of the effects of a spectral sensitivity change, and predicts differences in colour percepts between the fovea and periphery that were not observed. The similarities in hue percepts at 0 and 8 ° thus suggest that additional processes help compensate colour appearance to maintain constancy in the near periphery. We model the results of previous studies to show that similar adjustments are implied by age-related changes in lens pigment, and to show that these adjustments are consistent with previous measurements of peripheral colour appearance based on hue cancellation...|$|R
40|$|A yellow/blue {{equilibrium}} {{light is}} one which appears neither yellowish nor bluish (i. e. uniquely red, uniquely green, or <b>achromatic).</b> The spectral <b>locus</b> of the monochromatic greenish equilibrium (around 500 nm) shows little, if any, variation over a luminance range of 2 log 10 units. Reddish equilibria are extraspectral, involving mixtures of short- and long-wave light. Their wavelength composition is noninvariant with luminance: a reddish equilibrium light turns bluish-red if luminance is increased with wavelength composition constant. The additive {{mixture of the}} reddish and greenish equilibria is again a yellow/blue equilibrium light. We conclude that yellow/blue equilibrium {{can be described as}} the zeroing of a nonlinear functional, which is, however, approximately linear in the short-wavelength ("blue") and middle-wavelength ("green") cone responses and nonlinear only in the long-wavelength ("red") cone response. The "red" cones contribute to yellowness, but via a compressive function of luminance. This effect works against the direction of the Bezold-Brücke hue shift. The Jameson-Hurvich yellow/blue chromatic-response function is only approximately correct: the relative values of yellow/blue chromatic response for an equal energy spectrum must vary somewhat with the energy level. © 1975...|$|R
40|$|Humans are trichromatic, and {{yet their}} {{perception}} of colours is rich and complex. The research presented in this thesis explores the process of colour appearance of uniform patches and natural polychromatic stimuli. This is done through the measurement {{and analysis of the}} <b>achromatic</b> <b>locus</b> (Chapter 2), modelling of chromatic adaptation in a large dataset of unique hues settings (Chapter 3), and measurement of thresholds for uniform and polychromatic stimuli derived from simulated skin images (Chapter 4). Chapter 2 proposes a novel navigation scheme based on unique hues for traversing colour space. The results show that when colour adjustments are made using this novel scheme, the variability of achromatic settings made by observers is reduced compared to the classical method of making colour adjustments along the cardinal axes of the CIELUV colour space. This result holds across the tested luminance levels (5, 20, 50 cd/m^ 2) {{in each of the three}} tested ambient illumination conditions – dark, simulated daylight and cool white fluorescent lighting. The analysis also shows that the direction of maximum variance of the achromatic settings lies along the daylight locus. Chapter 3 evaluates models of chromatic adaptation by using unique hues settings measured under different ambient illumination conditions. It is shown that a simple diagonal model in cone excitation space is the most efficient in terms of the trade-off between accuracy and degrees of freedom. It is also found that diagonal and linear models show similar performances, reiterating their theoretical equivalence. Performances of these diagonalisable models are found to be worse for UR and UG unique hue planes compared to UY and UB planes. Chapter 4 presents a set of three experiments reporting estimations of perceptual thresholds for polychromatic and uniform stimuli in a 3 -D chromaticity-luminance colour space. The first experiment reports thresholds for simulated skin images and uniform stimuli of the corresponding mean CIELAB colour. The second and third experiments investigate the effect of ambient illumination and the location of the stimuli in colour space. The thresholds for the polychromatic stimuli are found to be consistently higher than those for the uniform patches, for both the chromatic, and the luminance projections. The area of the chromaticity ellipses shows a gradual increase with distance from the illuminant chromaticity. The orientations of these ellipses for simulated skin are found to align with the vector joining the mean patch chromaticity and the illuminant chromaticity...|$|E
