5|$|For example, the {{stability}} and low energy of the electron cloud state in helium <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> element's chemical inertness, and also the lack of interaction of helium atoms with each other, producing the lowest melting and boiling points of all the elements.|$|E
5|$|In {{a similar}} way, the {{particular}} energetic {{stability of the}} helium-4 nucleus, produced by similar effects, <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ease of helium-4 production in atomic reactions that involve either heavy-particle emission or fusion. Some stable helium-3 (2 protons and 1 neutron) is produced in fusion reactions from hydrogen, {{but it is a}} very small fraction compared to the highly favorable helium-4.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Bitola inscription where the victory of Samuil, commander of the Bulgarian army, is mentioned in summary form, several medieval historians have written <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> battle. Among them were Leo the Deacon who was an eyewitness and a direct participant in the campaign; John Skylitzes and two other historians George Kedrin and Joannes Zonaras who repeat the work of Skylitzes. Not only Byzantine historians wrote <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> battle, it was also recorded by the Melkite chronicler Yahaya of Antioch and the Armenians, Stephen of Taron (also known as Asolic) and Matthew of Edessa.

5|$|The olive yields bitter fruits, made edible by curing and fermentation, {{and olive}} oil. Some 90% {{of the fruit}} {{production}} (1996) goes into olive oil. The Mediterranean region <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> world's highest consumption of olive oil: in 2014, the highest-consuming country, Greece, used 17kg per head; Italy, 12kg, Spain 3kg; the United States for comparison used only 1kg per head.|$|E
5|$|The {{solutions}} for R(t) depend on k and Λ, but some qualitative features of such solutions are general. First and most importantly, the length scale R of the Universe can remain constant {{only if the}} Universe is perfectly isotropic with positive curvature (k=1) and has one precise value of density everywhere, as first noted by Albert Einstein. However, this equilibrium is unstable: because the Universe {{is known to be}} inhomogeneous on smaller scales, R must change over time. When R changes, all the spatial distances in the Universe change in tandem; there is an overall expansion or contraction of space itself. This <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> observation that galaxies appear to be flying apart; the space between them is stretching. The stretching of space also <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> apparent paradox that two galaxies can be 40 billion light years apart, although they started from the same point 13.8 billion years ago and never moved faster than the speed of light.|$|E

50|$|A {{simplified}} {{analysis of}} the buck converter, as described above, does not <b>account</b> <b>for</b> non-idealities of <b>the</b> circuit components nor does it <b>account</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> required control circuitry.

5|$|This last case <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{elements}} of unusually large finite order in πn+k(S'n) for such values of k. For example, the stable groups πn+11(S'n) have a cyclic subgroup of order 504, the denominator of B6/12 = 1⁄504.|$|E

5|$|As the {{efficiency}} {{is proportional to}} Fs3, small improvements in low frequency extension with the same driver and box volume will result in very significant reductions in efficiency. For these reasons, subwoofers are typically very inefficient at converting electrical energy into sound energy. This combination of factors <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> higher amplifier power required to drive subwoofers, and the requirement for greater power handling for subwoofer drivers. Enclosure variations (e.g., bass reflex designs with a port in the cabinet) are often used for subwoofers to increase {{the efficiency}} of the driver/enclosure system, helping to reduce the amplifier power requirements.|$|E

5|$|In the Standard Model of physics, {{electrons}} {{are truly}} elementary particles with no internal structure. However, both protons and neutrons are composite particles composed of elementary particles called quarks. There {{are two types}} of quarks in atoms, each having a fractional electric charge. Protons are composed of two up quarks (each with charge +) and one down quark (with a charge of −). Neutrons consist of one up quark and two down quarks. This distinction <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> difference in mass and charge between the two particles.|$|E
5|$|Jaco Van Dormael {{was born}} in Ixelles. Belgium, on 9 February 1957 to a Belgian couple. Van Dormael was raised in Germany until age seven, when his family {{returned}} to Belgium. At his birth, he had nearly been strangled by the umbilical cord and received an insufficient supply of oxygen. It was feared that he may end up mentally impaired.

5|$|Linezolid is metabolized in the liver, by {{oxidation}} of the morpholine ring, without {{involvement of}} the cytochrome P450 system. This metabolic pathway leads to two major inactive metabolites (which each account for around 45% and 10% of an excreted dose at steady state), one minor metabolite, and several trace metabolites, none of which {{accounts for more than}} 1% of an excreted dose. Clearance of linezolid varies with age and gender; it is fastest in children (which <b>accounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> shorter half-life), and appears to be 20% lower in women than in men. There is a strong correlation between linezolid clearance and creatinine clearance (CLCR).|$|E
