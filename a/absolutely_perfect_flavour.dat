25|$|Whatever is {{contained}} in a clear and distinct idea of a thing must be predicated of that thing; but a clear and distinct idea of an <b>absolutely</b> <b>perfect</b> Being contains the idea of actual existence; therefore since we have {{the idea of an}} <b>absolutely</b> <b>perfect</b> Being such a Being must really exist.|$|R

6000|$|There is no {{contradiction that}} three {{infinite}} minds should be [...] <b>absolutely</b> <b>perfect</b> in wisdom, goodness, justice and power; for these [...] are perfections {{which may be}} in more than one, as three men may all [...] know the same things, and be equally just and good: but three such [...] minds cannot be <b>absolutely</b> <b>perfect</b> without being mutually conscious to [...] each other, {{as they are to}} themselves.|$|R

60|$|I {{take two}} {{examples}} of <b>absolutely</b> <b>perfect,</b> and in manner highest, i. e. kingly, and heroic, style: the first example in expression of anger, the second of love.|$|R
60|$|This {{one great}} moment was love's, {{and it was}} love's alone. Each had {{forgotten}} strife, rebellion, ambition, the fugitive Cæsar and the murmuring people. Each only remembered the other and the <b>perfect</b> <b>flavour</b> of that first lingering kiss.|$|R
6000|$|The Philistine may, of course, {{object that}} to be <b>absolutely</b> <b>perfect</b> is {{impossible}}. Well, that is so: but then {{it is only the}} impossible things that are worth doing nowadays! ...|$|R
60|$|Ortheris {{had passed}} the {{treasure}} to my hand. It was an <b>absolutely</b> <b>perfect</b> clay, as shiny as the black ball at Pool. I took it reverently, but I was firm.|$|R

50|$|An <b>absolutely</b> <b>perfect</b> {{solution}} is awarded {{a mark of}} 7. This might be given {{if there is an}} error in the writing that does not affect the solution in any meaningful way.|$|R

60|$|Four years rolled by--and then! Well, {{you would}} never imagine it in the world. Unlimited power is the ideal thing when it is in safe hands. The despotism of heaven is the one <b>absolutely</b> <b>perfect</b> government. An earthly despotism would be the <b>absolutely</b> <b>perfect</b> earthly government, if the {{conditions}} were the same, namely, the despot the perfectest individual of the human race, and his lease of life perpetual. But as a perishable perfect man must die, and leave his despotism {{in the hands of}} an imperfect successor, an earthly despotism is not merely a bad form of government, it is the worst form that is possible.|$|R
50|$|Although mix {{networks}} {{provide security}} even if an adversary {{is able to}} view the entire path, mixing is not <b>absolutely</b> <b>perfect.</b> Adversaries can provide long term correlation attacks and track the sender and receiver of the packets.|$|R

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with newspaper Fanaposten, Kyrre quoted; [...] "Kygo an artist name has been <b>absolutely</b> <b>perfect.</b> It {{is very easy to}} say, in both Norwegian and English. And I have no need to change the artist name the future".|$|R
25|$|Selby {{tries to}} pass himself {{off as a}} classy and {{polished}} young man, considered by Mrs. Warbucks as a genius with a talent for the piano. She also thinks that he is <b>absolutely</b> <b>perfect,</b> {{and is one of}} those who wants everything just so.|$|R

60|$|Still no sound. My {{heart beat}} {{so fast that}} I could almost hear it. The night was very dark. A thin mist-like drizzle was falling; in fact the weather {{conditions}} were <b>absolutely</b> <b>perfect</b> for my purpose. With utmost wariness I allowed myself to drop from the window-ledge on to the soft ground below.|$|R
60|$|For {{the next}} few minutes he was very fluent indeed. With pencil in hand, he {{explained}} the plans, dwelt on the advantages of the location, and from the very reserve of his praise created an impression that the house he was describing was the one <b>absolutely</b> <b>perfect</b> domicile in the whole of London.|$|R
5000|$|Merckx sold {{most of his}} shares ... {{but remains}} heavily involved. Indeed, theres is {{something}} comforting about knowing that, even {{in a world of}} nano-tubes and computer-aided design, The Cannibal — the living representative of cycling's golden age-sometimes throws a leg over a frame in the factory he founded, just to check that the geometry is still <b>absolutely</b> <b>perfect.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Grace Jones {{was cast}} in a role that was {{essentially}} written as a parody of herself.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{characteristic}} properties of the developmental process {{is that it is}} stable.

50|$|The metaphysical {{considerations}} {{proceed from}} God to the substantial world {{and back to}} the spiritual realm.

A fast-riding cowboy without boots! ...|$|R
50|$|Audrey Landers {{could move}} well {{but was not}} a trained dancer as was {{the rest of the}} cast. Director Richard Attenborough felt that she was <b>absolutely</b> <b>perfect</b> for the role of Val and cast her in the film despite her lack of formal dance training. She does an admirable job of keeping up {{with the rest of the}} dancers in the film but she is absent from some of the more {{difficult}} choreographed dance numbers.|$|R
