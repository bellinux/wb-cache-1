5|$|The {{city itself}} {{comprises}} several parks and gardens amounting to 4,361 hectares. Among {{these are the}} City Park (Gradski Park), built by the Ottoman Turks {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century; Žena Borec Park, located in front of the Parliament; the University arboretum; and Gazi Baba forest. Many streets and boulevards <b>are</b> <b>planted</b> with trees.|$|E
5|$|Variety in texture, {{height and}} timing of floral display were equally {{important}} horticultural considerations. The beds around each headstone <b>are</b> <b>planted</b> {{with a mixture of}} floribunda roses and herbaceous perennials. Low-growing plants are chosen for areas immediately in front of headstones, ensuring that inscriptions are not obscured and preventing soil from splashing back during rain. In cemeteries where there are pedestal grave markers, dwarf varieties of plants are used instead.|$|E
50|$|At {{various times}} {{in the history of}} the Parish, three live oak trees <b>were</b> <b>planted</b> in the churchyard. The Sire Oak <b>was</b> <b>planted</b> in 1814 after the first church was built. The second <b>was</b> <b>planted</b> in 1900 after {{finishing}} the church. The third tree <b>was</b> <b>planted</b> in 1925 when the Parish House was finished. There is a wrought iron fence around the churchyard.|$|R
50|$|Reports say the larches <b>were</b> <b>planted</b> in 1938. It {{is unclear}} how the trees came to <b>be</b> <b>planted</b> and {{arranged}} in such a fashion. It seems they <b>were</b> <b>planted</b> in commemoration of Adolf Hitler's birthday, either by local Hitler Youth members or by a warden.|$|R

5|$|Onions may {{be grown}} from seed or from sets. Onion seeds are {{short-lived}} and fresh seeds germinate better. The seeds are sown thinly in shallow drills, thinning {{the plants in}} stages. In suitable climates, certain cultivars can be sown in late summer and autumn to overwinter {{in the ground and}} produce early crops the following year. Onion sets are produced by sowing seed thickly in early summer in poor soil and the small bulbs produced are harvested in the autumn. These bulbs <b>are</b> <b>planted</b> the following spring and grow into mature bulbs later in the year. Certain cultivars are used for this purpose and these may not have such good storage characteristics as those grown directly from seed.|$|E
5|$|The hamlet was {{designed}} by John Nash, master of the Picturesque style. He had worked for Harford on other buildings. The hamlet is the first fully realised exemplar of the garden suburb and was the inspiration for virtually all garden suburbs that followed. The cottages are all unique and include brick chimneys and dormer windows with some having thatched roofs. They are examples of the picturesque, an aesthetic ideal introduced into English cultural debate in 1782 by William Gilpin. An oval path links the cottages and encircles the village green, which has a sundial at its centre. The cottage gardens <b>are</b> <b>planted</b> in a Victorian cottage garden style.|$|E
5|$|Thousands {{of plant}} species are {{cultivated}} for aesthetic purposes {{as well as}} to provide shade, modify temperatures, reduce wind, abate noise, provide privacy, and prevent soil erosion. Plants are the basis of a multibillion-dollar per year tourism industry, which includes travel to historic gardens, national parks, rainforests, forests with colorful autumn leaves, and festivals such as Japan's and America's cherry blossom festivals. While some gardens <b>are</b> <b>planted</b> with food crops, many <b>are</b> <b>planted</b> for aesthetic, ornamental, or conservation purposes. Arboretums and botanical gardens are public collections of living plants. In private outdoor gardens, lawn grasses, shade trees, ornamental trees, shrubs, vines, herbaceous perennials and bedding plants are used. Gardeners may cultivate the plants in a naturalistic state, or may sculpture their growth, as with topiary or espalier. Gardening is the most popular leisure activity in the U.S., and working with plants or horticulture therapy is beneficial for rehabilitating people with disabilities. Plants may also be grown or kept indoors as houseplants, or in specialized buildings such as greenhouses that are designed for the care and cultivation of living plants. Venus Flytrap, sensitive plant and resurrection plant are examples of plants sold as novelties. There are also art forms specializing in the arrangement of cut or living plant, such as bonsai, ikebana, and the arrangement of cut or dried flowers. Ornamental plants have sometimes changed the course of history, as in tulipomania.|$|E

5|$|Bani Zeid {{had a total}} {{land area}} of 22,249 dunams in 1945, of which 90 dunams were {{classified}} as built-up areas (Deir Ghassaneh was larger than Beit Rima) and 8,400 dunams were planted with olive or fig groves. Today the Bani Zeid municipality has a jurisdiction of over 21,979 dunams, of which 80.6% is cultivable land. today Beit Rima is the larger village. The built-up areas of the town constitute 918 dunams, 832 of which is geared towards residential areas while the remaining 86 is used for commercial, industrial and transportation purposes. The town is surrounded by olive groves, which Bani Zeid is well known for, and 14,505 dunams <b>are</b> <b>planted</b> with olive trees. The old village center of Deir Ghassaneh consists of three quarters: Harat al-Barghouti (Harat al-Fauqa), Harat al-Shu'aibi and Harat al-Tahtani.|$|E
5|$|Bulbs {{offered for}} sale are {{referred}} to as either 'round' or 'double nose'. Round bulbs are circular in cross section and produce a single flower stem, while double nose bulbs have more than one bulb stem attached at the base and produce two or more flower stems, but bulbs with more than two stems are unusual. Planted narcissi bulbs produce daughter bulbs in the axil of the bulb scales, leading to the dying off of the exterior scales. To prevent planted bulbs forming more and more small bulbs, they can be dug up every 5–7 years, and the daughters separated and replanted separately, provided that a piece of the basal plate, where the rootlets are formed, is preserved. For daffodils to flower {{at the end of the}} winter or early spring, bulbs <b>are</b> <b>planted</b> in autumn (September–November). This plant does well in ordinary soil but flourishes best in rich soil. Daffodils like the sun but also accepts partial shade exposure.|$|E
5|$|In the 1990s, Sauvignon blanc {{wines from}} the {{maritime}} climatic regions of New Zealand, particularly the South Island, became popular on the wine market. In the Marlborough Region, sandy soils over slate shingles {{have become the}} most desirable locations for plantings due to the good drainage of the soil and poor fertility that encourages the vine to concentrate its flavors in lower yields. In the flood plain of the Wairau River Valley, the soil runs in east-west bands across the area. This can create a wide diversity of flavors for vineyards that <b>are</b> <b>planted</b> north-south with the heavier soils producing more herbaceous wines from grapes that ripen late and vines planted in stonier soils ripening earlier and imparting more lush and tropical flavors. It is this difference in soils, {{and the types of}} harvest time decisions that wine producers must make, that add a unique element to New Zealand Sauvignon blanc.|$|E

5|$|One {{particular}} {{threat to}} mass-producing plants for harvest is their susceptibility to diseases. Wild species have {{a range of}} genetic variability that allows some individuals to survive should a disturbance occur. In agriculture, resistance through variability is compromised, since genetically uniform seeds <b>are</b> <b>planted</b> under uniform conditions. Monocultural agriculture thus causes low crop diversity, especially when the seeds are mass-produced or when plants (such as grafted fruit trees and banana plants) are cloned. A single pest or disease could threaten a whole crop due to this uniformity. A well-known historic case was the Irish Potato Famine of 1845-1847, where a vital crop with low diversity was destroyed by a single fungus. Another example is when a disease caused by a fungus affected the monocultured 1970 US corn crop, causing a loss of over one billion dollars in production.|$|E
5|$|Only {{the white}} stone mosque, one village mill, the village health center, {{and a few}} {{partially}} destroyed houses remain on the site. The mosque has {{been converted into a}} carpentry workshop and one of the houses has been made into a chicken coop. The health center and grain mill are deserted, and the school is gone. The cemetery remains, but it is in a neglected state; the tomb of Yusuf al-Hamdan, a prominent nationalist who fell in the 1936 revolt, is clearly visible. The surrounding lands <b>are</b> <b>planted</b> with almond trees, wheat, and barley; they also contain animal sheds, a fodder plant, and a pump installed on the spring of 'Ayn al-Hajja. The site is tightly fenced in and entry is blocked.|$|E
5|$|Silviculture is the {{practice}} of controlling the establishment, growth, composition, health, and quality of forests, which are areas that have a high density of trees. Cultivated trees <b>are</b> <b>planted</b> and tended by humans, usually because they provide food (fruits or nuts), ornamental beauty, or some type of wood product that benefits people. An area of land planted with fruit or nut trees is an orchard. A small wooded area, usually with no undergrowth, is called a grove and a small wood or thicket of trees and bushes is called a coppice or copse. A large area of land covered with trees and undergrowth is called woodland or forest. An area of woodland composed primarily of trees established by planting or artificial seeding {{is known as a}} plantation.|$|E
50|$|After {{the last}} {{expected}} frost in spring, the <b>plants</b> can <b>be</b> <b>planted</b> out into their final positions. In their first winter outdoors, a frost protection is required. For further propagation, a vegetal reproduction is possible: cuttings of wood with {{a length of}} 15 to 30 cm can <b>be</b> <b>planted</b> into pots. These cuttings normally root and can <b>be</b> <b>planted</b> out in the following spring.|$|R

5|$|The {{different}} districts produce {{grapes of}} varying characteristics that are blended by the Champagne houses {{to create their}} distinct house styles. The Pinots of the Montagne de Reims that <b>are</b> <b>planted</b> on northern facing slopes {{are known for their}} high levels of acid and the delicacy they add to the blend. The grapes on the southern facing slope add more power and character. Grapes across the district contribute to the bouquet and headiness. The abundance of southern facing slopes in the Vallée de la Marne produces the ripest wines with full aroma. The Côte des Blancs grapes are known for their finesse and the freshness they add to blends with the extension of the nearby Côte de Sézanne offering similar though slightly less distinguished traits.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} trees in the world, {{according}} to a 2015 estimate, is 3.04 trillion, of which 1.39 trillion (46%) are in the tropics or sub-tropics, 0.61 trillion (20%) in the temperate zones, and 0.74 trillion (24%) in the coniferous boreal forests. The estimate is about eight times higher than previous estimates, {{and is based on}} tree densities measured on over 400,000 plots. It remains subject to a wide margin of error, not least because the samples are mainly from Europe and North America. The estimate suggests that about 15 billion trees are cut down annually and about 5 billion <b>are</b> <b>planted.</b> In the 12,000 years since the start of human agriculture, the number of trees worldwide has decreased by 46%.|$|E
