25|$|Once {{food was}} {{procured}} and transported to urban areas, {{it was sold}} to consumers by state-owned stores and restaurants. In the mid-1980s food items were also available in free markets, where peasants sold their produce, and in privately owned restaurants. As noted previously, the prices of pigs, <b>aquatic</b> <b>products,</b> and vegetables were determined by local authorities according to quality and demand. The prices of other products floated freely on the market. Except for grain, edible oil, {{and a few other}} rationed items, food items were in good supply.|$|E
25|$|In 1984 {{the number}} of {{agricultural}} and sideline products subject to state planning and purchasing quotas was reduced from twenty-nine to ten and included cereal grains, edible oil, cured tobacco, jute, hemp, and pigs. In 1985 the system of state purchasing quotas for agricultural products was abolished. Instead, the state purchased grain and cotton under contract at a set price. Once contracted quotas were met, grain and cotton were sold on the market at floating prices. If market prices fell below the listed state price, the state purchased all available market grain at the state price to protect the interests of producers. Vegetables, pigs, and <b>aquatic</b> <b>products</b> sold to urban, mining, and industrial areas were traded in local markets according to demand. Local commercial departments set the prices of these goods according to quality to protect the interests of urban consumers. All other agricultural goods were sold on the market to the state, to cooperatives, or to other producers.|$|E

30|$|In addition, {{zinc oxide}} (ZnO) thin films {{have been studied}} as an {{excellent}} material for antibacterial and antifungus. The adherence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to ZnO films with nanorod surface structures was weaker than that of glass and sputtered ZnO, and more P. aeruginosa are killed in the ZnO films [25]. Meanwhile, one research pointed out that ZnO-coated surfaces dramatically restricted biofilm formation, and the generation of hydroxyl radicals {{played a key role}} in antibiofilm activity but not the existence of zinc ions [26]. Furthermore, ZnO composite films can be used in many fields to restrict biofilm formation and will have good application prospects in <b>aquatic</b> <b>product</b> preservation [27]. ZnO is hydrophilic, while hydrophobic films are good at restraining biofilm adhesion. Thus, it is necessary to improve the hydrophobic properties of ZnO film.|$|R
