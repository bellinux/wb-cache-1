5|$|Alonso ran <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> at turn one {{again on}} lap 15, which {{resulted}} in him falling further behind Hamilton. Three laps later he made a similar mistake at the same turn, resulting in him sliding <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> {{for the third time}} in the race. This caused him to drop back to fourth as it allowed Massa to go round the inside of Alonso into third.|$|E
5|$|On lap 25, a man {{appeared}} {{beside the}} barriers of the circuit on the straight heading towards turn 2. He {{ran across the}} track to avoid being caught by marshals. The incident prompted the deployment of the safety car. Teams immediately brought their drivers into the pit lane {{to take advantage of}} the scenario with Trulli and de la Rosa the first to make pit stops. McLaren called in Häkkinen to the pit lane on lap 27 and Coulthard remained out on worn tyres. The Scot pitted on the following lap and emerged in sixth place. On the same lap, the man was caught and escorted off the circuit. Racing resumed on lap 29 when the safety car pulled into the pit lane. Trulli immediately came under pressure from Barrichello and withstood the Brazilian's attempts to pass him. Ralf Schumacher spun at turn 3 on lap thirty and Verstappen was forced wide in avoidance. Later on Alesi collided with Diniz and struck the barriers, having lost his car's two left wheels. The safety car was once again deployed as carbon fibre was scattered <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass.</b>|$|E
5|$|The paratroopers' first {{assault on}} the palace met with {{surprising}} resistance. The Presidential Guardsmen who stood between the rebels and Diệm were estimated at between 30 and 60, but they managed to repel the initial thrust and kill seven rebels who attempted to scale the palace walls and run <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass.</b> The rebels cordoned off the palace and held fire. They trucked in reinforcements and the attack restarted at 7:30, but the Presidential Guard continued to resist. Half an hour later, the rebels brought in five armored vehicles and circumnavigated the palace. They fired at the perimeter posts, and mortared the palace grounds. However, the exchange had petered out by 10:30. In the meantime, the rebels had captured the national police offices, Radio Saigon and the barracks of the Presidential Guard. They had also put most of the Saigon-based generals under house arrest, meaning that Diệm's saviours {{would have to come}} from outside Saigon. However, the rebels also suffered a setback when Hong was killed during the battle for the police headquarters. He had been sitting in his jeep behind the frontline when he was hit by stray gunfire.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{heavy rain}} early Friday morning, the track was dry {{for the first}} {{practice}} and remained that way all weekend. On his first lap, Barrichello became the first Formula 1 driver in three years of running at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway to hit the concrete wall in the oval section of the track. As {{he was about to}} finish his first lap, his left rear tire lost pressure and the car was flung into the outer wall {{at the top of the}} main straight, ripping off the left rear corner and front wing. Barrichello's car missed the energy-absorbing Steel And Foam Energy Reduction (SAFER) barrier that had been installed in front of the concrete wall in all of the oval turns the previous May. The Ferrari went <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> at the bottom of Turn 13, up the banking, and hit the bare concrete wall at the beginning of the straight.|$|E
25|$|James Courtney {{was ruled}} {{out of the}} Sydney Motorsport Park event {{following}} Friday practice, where {{he was hit by}} a piece of pit equipment which had been flung into the air by a low-flying helicopter. He was replaced by his endurance co-driver, Jack Perkins, {{for the rest of the}} event. Chaz Mostert continued his strong qualifying form, taking pole position for both of the Saturday races. He went on to win the first race ahead of his teammate Mark Winterbottom while Jamie Whincup finished third, his first podium finish since the Ubet Perth Super Sprint. Dale Wood was penalised for reckless driving after deliberately running into Nick Percat on the slowdown lap after the race. The pair had come together during the race which resulted in Wood spinning. Whincup won the second race ahead of Fabian Coulthard and Mostert. Mostert took his second win of the weekend in the Sunday race, half of which was held in wet conditions, leading home the two Brad Jones Racing cars of Coulthard and Jason Bright. Bright was spun by Shane Van Gisbergen in the closing stages but cut <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> from turn four to turn eight to retain his position.|$|E

As far as Fuller was concerned, the touchdown was better than any he had made when practising circuits and bumps at Forest Hill airfield the previous day. His acting commanding officer, Squadron Leader Cooper, declared the choice of improvised runway [...] "perfect", and the landing itself as a [...] "wonderful effort". The RAAF's Inspector of Air Accidents, Group Captain Arthur [...] "Spud" [...] Murphy, flew straight to the scene from Air Force Headquarters in Melbourne, accompanied by his deputy Henry Winneke. Fuller told Murphy: ...|$|E

2500|$|By {{the early}} 19th century, {{the game was}} already part of the {{standard}} physical education of girls, together with jumping rope and dumbbells. Girls from four to fourteen could {{be seen by the}} hundreds, trundling their hoops <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> in the London parks. Though held to be common {{in the early years of}} the 19th century, the simplicity and innocence of those years was alleged to have been replaced by the 1850s with a precocious maturity, where [...] "Instead of trundling hoops, urchins smoke cigars." ...|$|E

2500|$|The race {{started at}} 13:00 local time. The {{conditions}} on the grid were dry and sunny before the race; the air temperature was [...] and the track temperature was , Michael Schumacher maintained his starting line advantage heading into Copse corner followed by Häkkinen. Coulthard, driving on the inside line heading into Copse corner, {{was hit in the}} rear-end by Trulli who took the inside line and both spun with Trulli going into the gravel trap at Copse corner and Coulthard went <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> verge and onto the pit lane exit road. Further back, Villeneuve was unable to shift into a higher gear because his automatic upshifting system failed and was forced to use to switch to a manual start. He then drove in a gear he did not intend to drive in, and applied his brakes hard locking his front wheels, rendering him unable to steer and made contact with team-mate Panis, who retired from the race after going into the gravel trap at Copse corner next to Trulli's car. Montoya made a quick gateway, moving up from eighth to third {{by the end of the}} first lap and his team-mate Ralf Schumacher made up five positions over the same distance. Frentzen, however, made a poor start and lost three positions before the first lap ended. Further behind, Verstappen made the best start in the field as he moved up from 17th to eleventh and Alesi moved up four positions. At the end of the first lap, Michael Schumacher led by 0.3 seconds from Häkkinen and both drivers were followed by Montoya, Barrichello, Ralf Schumacher, Räikkönen, Heidfeld, Frentzen, Alesi, Villeneuve, Verstappen, de la Rosa, Button, Bernoldi, Irvine, Burti, Fisichella, Coulthard and Alonso.|$|E

50|$|In this context, a grassed {{waterway}} allows increasing {{soil cohesion}} and roughness. It also prevents {{the formation of}} rills and gullies. Furthermore, it can slow down runoff and allow its re-infiltration during long winter rains. In contrast, its infiltration capacity is generally not sufficient to reinfiltrate runoff produced by heavy spring and summer storms. It can therefore be useful to combine it with extra measures, like the installation of earthen dams <b>across</b> <b>the</b> <b>grassed</b> waterway, in order to buffer runoff temporarily.|$|R

Once these candidate genes for family- or genus- or species-specific gene functions are identified, they can now be easily isolated and tested for the ability to condition novel biological function by introduction into easily-transformed model species.|$|R
