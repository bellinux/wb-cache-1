40|$|Two glands {{associated}} with the sting apparatus of worker honey bees produce venom. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyse the size and morphometrics of the sting apparatus of worker bees of four Apis species. The sting apparatus consists of a venom gland, venom sac or venom reservoir and sting. These structures are located in the posterior region of the abdomen between the rectum and ovaries. The venom gland is a long tubular filamentous region (<b>acid</b> <b>gland)</b> connected to a reservoir at its proximal region in which the venom is stored. The distal end of the reservoir or venom sac is connected to the bulb of the sting, which leads into the venom canal present inside the shaft of the sting. Little variation was observed in the morphology of the sting apparatus of the different Apis species, although significant variations were found in the length and width of the different parts of sting apparatus.

40|$|Abstract Background In general shell-less slugs are {{considered}} to be slimy animals with a rather dull appearance and a pest to garden plants. But marine slugs usually are beautifully coloured animals belonging to the less-known Opisthobranchia. They are characterized by a large array of interesting biological phenomena, usually related to foraging and/or defence. In this paper our knowledge of shell reduction, correlated with the evolution of different defensive and foraging strategies is reviewed, and new results on histology of different glandular systems are included. Results Based on a phylogeny obtained by morphological and histological data, the parallel reduction of the shell within the different groups is outlined. Major food sources are given and glandular structures are described as possible defensive structures in the external epithelia, and as internal glands. Conclusion According to phylogenetic analyses, the reduction of the shell correlates with the evolution of defensive strategies. Many different kinds of defence structures, like cleptocnides, mantle dermal formations (MDFs), and <b>acid</b> <b>glands,</b> are only present in shell-less slugs.

40|$|In {{a typical}} mollusc, the shell {{is the most}} {{important}} defensive mechanism. But the shell does not protect the mollusc from all predators, and {{it is for this reason}} that secondary defensive mechanisms have evolved in many species. In some cases, these secondary mechanisms become more important than the shell as a means of protection from predators, and where this occurs selection may favour the reduction and even the total loss of the shell. The shell has been lost independently in each of the nine orders of the Opisthobranchia except the Thecosomata, and in the Sacoglossa and the Nudibranchia it may have been lost two or three times. In all of these cases where the shell-less or nudibranch condition has evolved, the animal must be adequately protected by defensive mechanisms other than the shell. This thesis studies the defensive mechanisms of a number of nudibranch molluscs. In the Sacoglossa there is a series of forms from the primitive Arthessa, with a well-developed defensive shell, through Oxynoandeuml; and Lobiger, with reduced shells, to the nudibranch Stiliger on the one hand and to the bivalved Berthelinia on the other. The defensive mechanisms of Berthelinia and Stiliger are compared. It is shown that even in Berthelinia. which is protected by a tightly closing bivalved shell, there is a secondary defensive mechanism in the form of a secretion from the hypobranchial gland. In Stiliger, the defensive mechanisms are located in the cerata. Three types of gland are present of which at least one, and probably all, are defensive. In addition the cerata can be autotomised and regenerated, and this may also be of defensive importance. It is also shown that the ceratal glands of Stiliger and the hypobranchial gland of Berthelinia are muscle-operated. It is concluded that in both Stiliger and Berthelinia the defensive system involves two or three defensive mechanisms; and there is evidence that these mechanisms act in series just as do the defensive mechanisms of many tropical insects. The defensive mechanisms of the Doridacea are discussed. It is concluded that camouflage is of widespread occurrence, but that there is as yet no evidence for the occurrence of warning coloration. Many bright colours are deflection marks, but the importance of other bright colours is still not known. Dorsal papillae with a probable defensive function are present in some species of the Doridacea, and they are usually supplied with glands. The function of the caryphyllidia of certain species is not known. Autotomy of papillae has not been described, but autotomy of the mantle edge occurs in the Discodoridinae. Defensive glands are of widespread occurrence in the Doridacea. One type of defensive gland that has not been described before in dorids is the <b>acid</b> <b>gland</b> of Discodoris pusae and Anisodoris stellifera. Acid secretion is well known from certain other opisthobranch and prosobranch molluscs, and the discovery of its occurrence in dorids means that it has evolved independently at least four times in the Mollusca. In D. pusae and A. stellifera, the acid glands are large subepidermal pits with a mucous plug and a muscular sphincter. The acid is inorganic and contains sulphate ions. It may register pH 1 or 2 close to the skin of the mollusc. Another species of Discodoris was found to secrete acid of a similar pH. In this species acid-secretion is from the ordinary epidermal cells, and subepidermal glands are totally absent. In the light of these results, the evolution of acid-secretion is discussed. In all four suborders of the Nudibranchia and in the Sacoglossa, species with dorsal papillae or cerata have evolved. In all cases where these have been studied, they have been found to be of defensive importance. Cerata usually contain glands, are mobile, can be autotomised without harm to the mollusc, and may have yet other defensive mechanisms. The Eolidacea are the best known of these groups with defensive dorsal papillae. In the eolids, some species are camouflaged, but none has been shown to possess warning coloration. Cerata may be brightly coloured to direct attacks away from the head, and the behaviour of the mollusc supports this view. Cerata can be autotomised and regenerated, but the ease with which autotomy occurs varies between different species, Cerata are especially sensitive at their tips, and it is shown that this is because there is a high concentration of neurosensory cilia in this region. Stimulation, by touch, of these cilia can cause ejection of nematocysts or of glandular secretions as a defensive response. Ceratal glands are described for a number of species of solid. The role of the cellules spéciales is discussed, and it is concluded that these are not of defensive importance. Their content of RNA and of protein suggests that they synthesize protein, and their high glycogen content suggests that they are storage cells. They may have a duct in some species, and could thus be excretory. Simple, unicellular mucous glands occur in probably all eolids, but they may be epidermal or subepidermal in different species. They probably protect the animal from abrasion. They may also be responsible for the mucin cuticle, or for the presence of a mucous film just outside the cuticle which is continuously being carried off the tips of the cerata by ciliary action. Mucous glands are the only glands present in some species, for example Eolis M and Tergipes despectus. In other acleioproct eolids there are glands which have a defensive functions the species of Catriona studied have two types of defensive gland, whilst the eubranchids studied have three and possibly five types of defensive gland. These defensive glands are usually concentrated at the tips of the cerata and are exuded when the animal is violently disturbed. Some of them are muscle-operated and are proteinaceous, others contain mucopolysaccharides or mucoproteins. In the smaller species of both Catriona and Eubranchus, the surface area of ceratal epithelium is limited, and the defensive glands are packed so as to utilize all available space. The method of packing the glands is different in the two genera, suggesting that it is a case of parallel evolution. It is further suggested that the defensive glands of Calma, Catriona and the Eubranchidae are convergent. In the cleioprocts studied, no such concentration of glands at the ceras tip was found, but all species possess two or more types of ceratal gland. There is evidence that some of these may be defensive in function. Nematocysts are used in defence by many eolids, but for them to be effective, they must be ejected from the cnidosac and an appreciable percentage of them must explode. It is shown that whilst nematocysts are frequently ejected and exploded as a defensive reaction, there is considerable variation between different species. In Calma, glands are of considerable defensive value, but nematocysts are totally absent; whilst in Tergipes despectus, defensive glands are absent and nematocysts are important in defence. Other species utilize both defensive mechanisms, but to varying extents. In the Cleioprocta generally, and particularly in the Aeolidiidae, glands are not of great importance in defence whilst nematocysts are; but in the Eubranchidae and in Catriona glands are well-developed and of considerable defensive importance. There is even variation within one genus. Thus Catriona tina rarely uses glands but frequently uses nematocysts in defence, whilst C. perca rarely uses nematocysts but frequently uses glands. This interspecific variation in behaviour is probably related to the different predators which different species of eolid are likely to encounter. The predators of nudibranchs in the sea are not well known, but laboratory experiments have demonstrated that many nudibranchs are relatively unpalatable to many species of fish. However, some species of fish are not deterred from eating eolids by nematocysts, and it is likely that it is with relation to these predators that glandular defensive mechanisms have evolved. Thus nematocysts may be protective against one set of predators whilst glands are protective against another set of predators. Nematocysts may be damaging not only to potential predators of eolids, but also to the eolid itself when it crawls over coelenterates. The mechanism by which eolids escape damage from nematocysts is not known, but there is evidence that the vesicular structure of the epidermis is involved. It is concluded that in many nudibranchs the defensive system involves several distinct mechanisms which come into action in series. There is some evidence that certain mechanisms are adapted to specific predators. The eolidiform condition is a particularly efficient defensive adaptation since it concentrates several mechanisms into that part of the mollusc which is expendible, and which is the first to be encountered by a potential predator. Three papers are included in the appendix. The first describes the occurrence of Polycera elegans (Bergh) in Britain, and discusses its taxonomy. The second gives notice of a new species of bivalved gastropod from Jamaica, and the third is a description of this animal. </p...|$|E

Uptake of domoic acid over different periods of time by digestive gland tissue was compared with that of structurally related amino acids, glutamic acid and kainic acid.

Kainic acid, a non-protein, rare amino acid, was least absorbed. In a series of experiments to determine the inhibitory actions of chemically similar and dissimilar amino acids, kainic acid, glutamic acid and proline inhibited the uptake of domoic acid by 42, 38 and 34 %, respectively, indicating competition for the same carrier site.

40|$|Background Chemical {{signals are}} widely used in the animal kingdom, {{enabling}} communication in various social contexts, including mate selection {{and the establishment of}} dominance. Femoral glands, which produce and release waxy secretions into the environment, are organs of central importance in lizard chemical communication. The Galápagos marine iguana (Amblyrhynchus cristatus) is a squamate reptile with a lek-mating system. Although the lekking behaviour of marine iguanas has been well-studied, their potential for sexual communication via chemical cues has not yet been investigated. Here we describe the diversity of the lipophilic fraction of males’ femoral gland secretions among 11 island populations of marine iguanas, and compare it with the composition of its sister species, the Galápagos land iguana (Conolophus subcristatus). We also conducted behavioural observations in marine iguana territorial males in order to explore the possible function of these substances in the context of male dominance in leks. Methods Femoral secretions were analysed by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC–MS), and chromatography with a flame ionisation detector (GC-FID) in order to characterise the lipophilic composition. To understand the potential role of femoral secretions in marine iguana intraspecific communication, territorial males were sampled for their femoral glands and monitored to record their head bob rate—a territorial display behaviour in males—as well as the number of females present in their leks. Results We found that the gland secretions were composed of ten saturated and unsaturated carboxylic acids ranging in chain length between C 16 and C 24, as well as three sterols. Cholesterol was the main compound found. Intriguingly, land iguanas have a higher diversity of lipophilic compounds, with structural group of lipids (i. e. aldehydes) entirely absent in marine iguanas; overall the chemical signals of both species were strongly differentiated. Lipid profiles also differed among populations of marine iguanas from different islands, with some islands demonstrating a high diversity of lipophilic compounds (i. e. full spectra of compounds), and others lacking one or more compounds. Among the compounds most frequently found missing were 11 - and 13 -eicosenoic <b>acids.</b> <b>Gland</b> secretions of males with a better body condition and with a higher dominance status (i. e. those accompanied by females and with higher head bob display) were proportionately richer in C 20 -unsaturated fatty acids (11 -eicosenoic acid). Discussion Land and marine iguanas strongly diverged in their chemical composition of the femoral glands likely due to ecological differences between both species. Despite that marine iguana populations varied in their femoral gland composition that was not related to their genetic structure.

Growing research on the role of fats in human health suggests that early exposure in life to specific fatty acids, when tissues are particularly sensitive to their environment, can have long-term health impacts. The present review examines the role of dietary fat in mammary gland development and breast cancer throughout the lifecycle. Overall, n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have promising cancerpreventive effects when introduced early in life, and warrant further research to elucidate the mechanisms of action...|$|R
50|$|Little {{is known}} about the pangolin, as it is {{difficult}} to study in the wild. Pangolins are solitary animals and only interact for mating. They dig and live in deep burrows made of semispherical chambers. These burrows are large enough for humans to crawl into and stand up. Although it is capable of digging its own burrow, the ground pangolin prefers to occupy those abandoned by warthogs or aardvarks or to lie in dense vegetation, making it even more difficult to observe. African pangolins such as the ground pangolin prefer burrows, while Asian pangolins sleep in hollows and forks of trees and logs. They are nocturnal animals. They mark their territory with urine, secretions, and by scattering their feces. When threatened, their defense mechanism is to curl into a ball with their scales outward, hiss and puff, and lash out with their sharp-edged tails. The scales on the tails are capable of a cutting action to inflict serious wounds. Pangolins are also capable of emitting noxious <b>acid</b> from <b>glands</b> near the anus, similar to a skunk, to ward off predators. The ground pangolin's main predators are leopards, hyenas, and humans. Young pangolins ride on the base of their mothers' tails and slip under the mother when she curls up for protection.|$|R
60|$|The {{secretion}} {{from the}} taller glands differs {{in a remarkable}} manner from that of Drosera, in being <b>acid</b> before the <b>glands</b> have been in any way excited; and judging from the changed colour of litmus paper, more strongly acid than that of Drosera. This fact was observed repeatedly; on one occasion I chose a young leaf, which was not secreting freely, and had never caught an insect, yet the secretion on all the glands coloured litmus paper of a bright red. From the quickness with which the glands are able to obtain animal matter from such substances as well-washed fibrin and cartilage, I suspect that a small quantity of the proper ferment must {{be present in the}} secretion before the glands are excited, so that a little animal matter is quickly dissolved.|$|R
50|$|A tenebrous worm is the {{larval form}} of the gloomwing. A tenebrous worm is an insectoid {{predator}} that inhabits the Plane of Shadows, and seeks warm-blooded prey. A tenebrous worm's head is equipped with powerful mandibles that drip a highly caustic <b>acid</b> secreted from <b>glands</b> located behind the creature's multi-faceted eyes. A tenebrous worm looks like a huge, partially bare caterpillar. The front section {{of the body is}} covered with lusterless black bristles, while the hind parts are a wet, nauseating grey. The many facets of the creature's eyes reflect the half-light of the Plane of Shadows with a luminous gillmer. This glimmer is the only warning of a tenebrous worm's presence. Its small, black legs allow it to move rapidly. Its great maw is flanked by its huge, pearly mandibles.|$|R
40|$|It {{was found}} that digitonin-permeabilized resting gastric glands {{retained}} considerable acid-secretory ability. Oligomycin abolished this, and ATP was able to bypass this inhibition and restore acid secretion. Moreover, the effect of anoxia was also bypassed by ATP in these preparations. As in intact <b>glands,</b> <b>acid</b> secretion was K+ dependent, and the concentration for half-maximal effect was 18. 5 +/- 1. 76 mM in Na+-free solutions, a value similar to that found for resting intact glands. The slight inhibition of ATP-dependent secretion by either valinomycin or 2, 4 -dinitrophenol, but total inhibition {{by a combination of}} the ionophores, is interpreted to mean that, in resting gastric glands, the in situ proton pump is electroneutral and the KCl pathway supplying K+ to the luminal face of the pump is probably electroneutral...|$|R
40|$|Free {{radicals}} and antioxidant therapy {{have attracted}} {{a great deal}} of attention in recent years. Antioxidants are compounds that destroy the free radicals in the body, thereby preventing harmful oxidation-reduction reactions. Antioxidants are critical for maintaining optimum health and well-being. The best sources of antioxidants are fruits and vegetables, which provide a variety of antioxidants such as Vitamins A, C, E, and carotenoids. Currently available data are compatible with the notion that these vitamins act as chemopreventives against some important cancers, e. g., carotenoids for lung cancer, ascorbic <b>acid</b> for salivary <b>gland</b> cancer, tocopherols for head and neck cancers, etc. Thus, a greater consumption of fruits and vegetables should be encouraged as they are the natural sources of these chemopreventive antioxidants along with other protective factors packaged by nature...|$|R
60|$|The purple fluid or {{granular}} matter which fills {{the cells of}} the glands differs to a certain extent from that within {{the cells of the}} pedicels. For when a leaf is placed in hot water or in certain <b>acids,</b> the <b>glands</b> become quite white and opaque, whereas [page 8] the cells of the pedicels are rendered of a bright red, with the exception of those close beneath the glands. These latter cells lose their pale red tint; and the green matter which they, as well as the basal cells, contain, becomes of a brighter green. The petioles bear many multicellular hairs, some of which near the blade are surmounted, according to Nitschke, by a few rounded cells, which appear to be rudimentary glands. Both surfaces of the leaf, the pedicels of the tentacles, especially the lower sides of the outer ones, and the petioles, are studded with minute papillae (hairs or trichomes), having a conical basis, and bearing on their summits two, and occasionally three or even four, rounded cells, containing much protoplasm. These papillae are generally colourless, but sometimes include a little purple fluid. They vary in development, and graduate, as Nitschke* states, and as I repeatedly observed, into the long multicellular hairs. The latter, as well as the papillae, are probably rudiments of formerly existing tentacles.|$|R
40|$|Pupal {{diapause}} in the cecropia silkmoth is terminated by {{activation of}} the prothoracic glands. Implantation of adult male cecropia corpora allata or injection of juvenile hormone-I (JH-I) or juvenile hormone-I acid (JH-I acid) causes initiation of development in debrained, allatectomized diapausing pupae. The subsequent development results in formation of sec-ond pupae or pupal-adult intermediates. The dose-response patterns for JH-I acid and JH-I are nearly identical. These data suggest that JH-I <b>acid</b> activates prothoracic <b>glands</b> and in addition acts like a morphogenetic hormone. Diapause in saturniid pupae results from the programmed in{{activation of the}} brain-prothoracic gland system and is termin-ated by activation of the prothoracic glands (PG) {{which leads to the}} secretion of ecdysone (Williams, 1952). Removal of the brain from such pupae keeps them in a state of permanent diapause (dauerpupae) which can be terminated by implantation of active brains or active corpora allata (Williams...|$|R
40|$|Gunnera is {{the only}} genus of {{angiosperms}} known to host cyanobacteria and the only group of land plants that hosts cyanobacteria intracellularly. Motile filaments of cyanobacteria, known as hormogonia, colonize Gunnera plants through cells in the plant's specialized stem glands. It is commonly held that Gunnera plants always possess functional glands for symbiosis. We found, however, that stem gland development did not occur when Gunnera manicata plants were grown on nitrogen (N) -replete medium but, rather, was initiated at predetermined positions when plants were deprived of combined N. While N status was the main determinant for gland development, an exogenous carbon source (sucrose) accelerated the process. Furthermore, {{a high level of}} sucrose stimulated the formation of callus-like tissue in place of the gland under N-replete conditions. Treatment of plants with the auxin transport inhibitor 1 -naphthylphthalamic <b>acid</b> prevented <b>gland</b> development on N-limited medium, most likely by preventing resource reallocation from leaves to the stem. Optimized conditions were found for in vitro establishment of the Nostoc-Gunnera symbiosis by inoculating mature glands with hormogonia from Nostoc punctiforme, a cyanobacterium strain for which the full genome sequence is available. In contrast to uninoculated plants, G. manicata plants colonized by N. punctiforme were able to continue their growth on N-limited medium. Understanding the nature of the Gunnera plant's unusual adaptation to an N-limited environment may shed light on the evolution of plant-cyanobacterium symbioses and may suggest a route to establish productive associations between N-fixing cyanobacteria and crop plants...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to performing general histology and cytology of the ciliary glands of the miniature pig, we studied the localization of glycoconjugates and b-defensins in these glands {{with the use}} of carbohydrate histochemical and immunohistochemical methods. The secretory cells of the glands were equipped with non-homogeneous secretory granules, a welldeveloped Golgi apparatus and rough endoplasmic reticulum. The secretory epithelium and luminal secretion of the glands contained large amounts of neutral and acidic glycoconjugates with various saccharide residues (a-L-Fuc, b-DGal, a-D-GalNAc and sialic <b>acid).</b> The sebaceous <b>glands</b> and tarsal glands also exhibited positive reactions to most of the histochemical methods. Additionally, the antimicrobial peptide group of b-defensins was demonstrated to be products of the ciliary glands, as well as the sebaceous glands and tarsal glands. The results obtained are discussed with regard to the specific function of the ciliary glandular secretions. These secretory products {{may be related to the}} moistening and general protection of the skin surface of the eyelid and ocular surface...|$|R
40|$|Systemic {{administration}} of 13 -cis-retinoic acid caused {{a reduction of}} acinar tissue in the hamster meibomian gland. Histologic examination of treated meibomian gland tissue revealed a thickening of gland ductal epithelium {{and a decrease in}} the numbers of mature lipid-laden acinar cells. Morphometric analysis showed a reduction of up to 75 % in mean volume of meibomian acinar tissue from animals fed a high dose of 13 -cis-retinoic acid. Clinical observations in these animals included alopecia and weight loss. Ocular complications included crusting of the eyelid margin and the external surface of the lid and erythema of the conjunctiva. The model supports previous observations by the authors that systemic 13 -cis-retinoic <b>acid</b> affects meibomian <b>gland</b> structure in a laboratory animal. The ocular side effects described in this model suggest that future functional studies may yield important insights into the complex relationship between meibomian gland morphology and function, and events on the ocular surface...|$|R
40|$|Olfaction {{may play}} an {{important}} role in regulating bird behavior, and has been suggested to be involved in feather-pecking. We investigated possible differences in the body odors of red junglefowl females by using an automated olfactometer which assessed the ability of trained mice to discriminate between the odors of uropygial gland secretions (the main carrier of potential individual odors in chickens) of six feather-pecked and six non-pecked birds. All mice were clearly able to discriminate between all individual red junglefowl odors, showing that each bird has an individual body odor. We analyzed whether it was more difficult to discriminate between the odors of two feather-pecked, or two non-pecked birds, than it was to discriminate between the odors of two randomly selected birds. This was not the case, suggesting that feather-pecked birds did not share a common odor signature. Analyses using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry showed that the composition of aliphatic carboxylic <b>acids</b> in uropygial <b>gland</b> secretions differed consistently between individuals. However, chemical composition did not vary according t...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAny contact of {{blackfly}} larvae and pupae to {{the substrate}} they colonise {{relies on the}} adhesion of the secretion which is produced in their large labial glands. This secretion anchors their filter-feeding position, any locomotive activity, and the pupal cocoon as well. The secretion works as a biological adhesive which adheres to nearly any substrate surface — even to wood or the integument of other aquatic animals. We began analysing the proteinaceaous compounds of the labial gland secretions of Simulium ornatum (complex) Meigen. According to the SDS-PAGE and amino <b>acid</b> analyses, blackfly <b>gland</b> secretion consists {{of a variety of}} proteins ranging from high to low molecular weights. The most prominent proteins form broad bands at about 70, 40 and 20 kDa. These main proteins were present in secretions from young to old larvae as well as in pupal cocoon secretion, but their relative amounts change with larval development. Results of N-terminal sequencing of prominent proteins revealed no obvious homologies to protein sequences deposited in the databases up to now...|$|R
40|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of {{fatty acids}} {{has been studied}} in lactating rabbits at 6 h after intravenous injection of sodium [1 - 14 C]acetate. The specific radioactivities of the individual fatty acids (C 6 : 0 to C 14 : 0) and the proportions of these fatty acids synthesized were similar in mammary tissue and milk. Hexanoic acid had the highest specific radioactivity, and the C 8 : 0 –C 14 : 0 fatty acids had similar specific radioactivities, which were about five times those of C 16 and C 18 acids. No radioactivity was detected in fatty acids of chain length C 14 in these tissues {{were similar to those}} of the long-chain fatty acids in the milk and mammary gland. The results show that the C 4 : 0 –C 14 : 0 fatty acids are synthesized within the mammary gland rather than by fatty acid uptake from circulating blood or by oxidation of long-chain fatty <b>acids</b> within the <b>gland.</b> We conclude that de novo synthesis of esterified fatty acids in vivo by this tissue has a high degree of chain-length specificity...|$|R
40|$|Salivary glands of Drosophila hydei {{recovering}} from an anaerobic treatment show {{a significant increase}} in apparent Vmax of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase. This increase in Vmax is based on an increase in enzyme molecules resulting from synthesis de novo in the cytoplasm, as indicated by the inhibition by cycloheximide of both the increase in apparent Vmax and the increase in amino acid incorporation into enzyme fractions. The increase in enzyme activity is also inhibited by actinomycin D, which is in support of previous data indicating a casual relationship between transcription in puff 4 - 81 B in the polytene chromosomes and an increase in apparent Vmax of the enzyme. Gel electrophoresis of mitochondrial protein extracts revealed three protein fractions with NADH dehydrogenase activity. All three fractions showed increased activity as well as increased amino <b>acid</b> labelling in <b>glands</b> {{recovering from}} anaerobiosis compared with control glands. The data suggest that the increase in mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase activity in salivary glands recovering from an anaerobic treatment depends on increased gene transcription...|$|R
