5|$|In Part 2, Phoebe {{tries to}} contact someone by phone to warn them about Rachel, {{eventually}} getting through to Joey {{at the hotel}} <b>and</b> <b>stirring</b> up homesickness in him. At the rehearsal dinner, Ross introduces his parents, Jack and Judy (Elliott Gould and Christina Pickles) to Emily's, Steven and Andrea (Tom Conti and Jennifer Saunders). Jack and Judy have volunteered to pay for half of the wedding expenses but when they discover extravagant costs Ross spends much of the evening trying to bargain down his future in-laws. Chandler makes a toast that is not well received by the guests and Monica is taken aback when a drunken guest mistakes her for Ross's mother. She and Chandler console each other over alcohol and wake up in bed together the next morning. Rachel eventually boards a plane, after forgetting her passport, and annoys other passengers (including guest star Hugh Laurie) by telling them about her relationship with Ross. At the hall, she sees how happy Ross is with Emily and just wishes him luck. Phoebe phones Joey to hear the wedding, to the annoyance of Ross. As Ross says his vows, he accidentally says Rachel's name rather than Emily's, registrar to ask Emily if he should continue, while the camera shoots from character to character, settling on a shocked Rachel.|$|E

25|$|A larger {{change was}} {{originally}} planned: Arwen and Elrond would visit Galadriel, and Arwen would accompany {{an army of}} Elves to Helm's Deep to fight alongside Aragorn. During shooting, the script changed, both from writers coming up with better ideas to portray the romance between Aragorn and Arwen, as well as poor fan reaction. The new scene of Arwen leaving for the West was created, and the conversation scene remains, edited to be a flashback to a conversation between them in Rivendell, on the evening before the Fellowship's departure. A conversation between Elrond and Galadriel in Lothlórien was edited to be a telepathic one. Nonetheless, one major change (already filmed) remained {{that could not be}} reversed: the Elven warriors fighting at Helm's Deep, although Jackson and Boyens found this romantic <b>and</b> <b>stirring</b> and a reference to how, in the Appendices of The Return of the King, Galadriel and the Elves of Lothlórien, and Thranduil of Mirkwood were first attacked by an army out of Dol Guldur in Mirkwood, and then later counter-attacked and assaulted the fortress itself.|$|E
25|$|The {{physical}} state (solid, liquid, or gas) of a reactant {{is also an}} important factor of the rate of change. When reactants are in the same phase, as in aqueous solution, thermal motion brings them into contact. However, when they are in different phases, the reaction is limited to the interface between the reactants. Reaction can occur only at their area of contact; {{in the case of a}} liquid and a gas, at the surface of the liquid. Vigorous shaking <b>and</b> <b>stirring</b> may be needed to bring the reaction to completion. This means that the more finely divided a solid or liquid reactant the greater its surface area per unit volume and the more contact it with the other reactant, thus the faster the reaction. To make an analogy, for example, when one starts a fire, one uses wood chips and small branches — one does not start with large logs right away. In organic chemistry, on water reactions are the exception to the rule that homogeneous reactions take place faster than heterogeneous reactions.|$|E

40|$|International audienceInfluence of a slowly {{rotating}} 0. 5 T transverse {{magnetic field}} on the directionally solidified metallic alloy has been experimentally studied in this work. Main idea is to study an influence on the melt flow and material structure caused by the simultaneous electromagnetic <b>stirring</b> <b>and</b> thermoelectromagnetic convection with comparable magnitudes. Electromagnetic <b>stirring</b> <b>and</b> thermoelectromagnetic convection intensities have been estimated analytically to find optimal experimental parameters. It is experimentally demonstrated that with such an interaction {{it is possible to}} modify component macrosegregation of Sn- 10 wt% Pb alloy. Helical macrosegregation within cylindrical sample is obtained as a result of simultaneous influence of thermoelectromagnetic convection (TEMC) <b>and</b> electromagnetic <b>stirring</b> of the liquid melt. Obtained experimental results allow to determine TEMC velocity by comparing the intensities of TEMC <b>and</b> electromagnetic <b>stirring.</b> (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

500|$|Cosmic Stories (also {{known as}} Cosmic Science-Fiction) <b>and</b> <b>Stirring</b> Science Stories were two American [...] pulp science fiction {{magazines}} that published {{a total of}} seven issues in 1941 and 1942. [...] Both Cosmic <b>and</b> <b>Stirring</b> were edited by Donald A. Wollheim and launched by the same publisher, appearing in alternate months. [...] Wollheim had no budget at all for fiction, so he solicited stories from his friends among the Futurians, {{a group of young}} science fiction fans including James Blish and C.M. Kornbluth. [...] Isaac Asimov contributed a story, but later insisted on payment after hearing that F. Orlin Tremaine, the editor of the competing science fiction magazine Comet, was irate at the idea of a magazine that might [...] "siphon readership from magazines that paid", and thought that authors who contributed should be blacklisted. [...] Kornbluth was the most prolific contributor, under several pseudonyms; one of his stories, [...] "Thirteen O'Clock", published under the pseudonym [...] "Cecil Corwin", was very successful, and helped to make his reputation in the field. [...] The magazines ceased publication in late 1941, but Wollheim was able to find a publisher for one further issue of Stirring Science Stories in March 1942 before war restrictions forced it to close again.|$|E

While at Brown, he led fund-raising efforts to assist Jewish refugees from Russia who were victims of an anti-Jewish pogrom. He was also a popular speaker with students at Johns Hopkins University.

He suggests that Khachaturian's works carry [...] "the vibrant rhythms <b>and</b> <b>stirring</b> pace of Caucasian dance music", {{but at the same}} time are [...] "original compositions that reworked that cultural material through new instrumentation and according to European musical canons, resulting in a sound unique to the composer". He was particularly influenced by the folk-song collector, musicologist Komitas, and composers Alexander Spendiaryan and Romanos Melikian. Khachaturian acknowledged that Komitas [...] "singlehandedly laid the foundations for Armenia's classical tradition". In a 1969 article about Komitas, Khachaturian called him his [...] "greatest teacher".|$|E
500|$|Wollheim sent {{a letter}} out to his {{contacts}} in science fiction fandom, announcing the new magazines. [...] Originally the plan had been to publish a single monthly title, but this was changed by the publisher to two alternating bimonthly magazines, to be called Cosmic Stories <b>and</b> <b>Stirring</b> Science Stories. The first to appear was the February 1941 issue of Stirring Science Stories. [...] Wollheim had announced a planned newsstand date of 15 December 1940, but according to Damon Knight's later recollection the magazine appeared in January 1941. [...] The two titles alternated months until the July 1941 issue of Cosmic Stories (by that time retitled Cosmic Science-Fiction on the cover), after which the magazines were cancelled. [...] Some months later Wollheim {{was able to find}} another publisher, Manhattan Fiction Publications, and a fourth issue of Stirring appeared, dated March 1942. [...] Wartime constraints prevented the new publisher from continuing, and there were no more issues of either title.|$|E
