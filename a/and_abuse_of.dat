5|$|In 1981, Dworkin {{published}} , which analyzes (and extensively cites examples drawn from) {{contemporary and}} historical pornography {{as an industry}} of woman-hating dehumanization. Dworkin argues that it is implicated in violence against women, both in its production (through the abuse of the women used to star in it), and in the social consequences of its consumption by encouraging men to eroticize the domination, humiliation, <b>and</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> women.|$|E

5|$|Bo's chief ideological rival, former Guangdong party chief Wang Yang, went on {{to become}} Vice-Premier holding the {{portfolios}} of agriculture, commerce, and poverty reduction. Wen Jiabao, who was seen as Bo's foremost critic in the top leadership, suffered significant public embarrassment himself over a New York Times article about his family's vast empire of wealth whose release coincided closely with Bo's dismissal. Huang Qifan, the mayor of Chongqing long seen as an ally of Bo, continued his political career basically unscathed. Wang Lijun was sentenced to fifteen years in prison for defection, corruption, <b>and</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> power.|$|E
5|$|In 1203 Norreis, {{secure in}} his {{alliance}} {{with his own}} monks, once again began to exploit the monastery for his own profit {{and that of his}} family and friends. His monks became upset at this renewal of their exploitation and sent Thomas, along with other monks, to appropriate the harvest from some lands that had been given by Norreis to a non-member of the community. Norreis protested to King John and to Hubert Walter. Both the king and Walter summoned Thomas to appear before them separately and explain the actions of the monks. Thomas failed to persuade either man and nothing was done about Norreis's exactions <b>and</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> his monks.|$|E
5|$|Just {{like most}} punk songs, Girlschool’s lyrics usually have short and direct texts, often {{reflecting}} the wild rock 'n' roll lifestyle and treating sex and romance {{as seen from}} a feminine point of view, {{with the use of}} reverse sexism and tongue-in-cheek sense of humour. Some of their songs deal also with more serious matters, such as exploitation <b>and</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> women, murder, addiction, the destruction of the environment, social and political issues.|$|E

5|$|The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, {{located in}} The Hague, has found several {{individuals}} guilty {{of crimes against}} humanity perpetrated at Omarska. Murder, torture, rape, <b>and</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> prisoners was common. Around 6,000 Bosniaks and Croats were held in appalling conditions at the camp for about five months {{in the spring and}} summer of 1992, including 37 women. Hundreds died of starvation, punishment beatings and ill-treatment.|$|E
5|$|The {{group was}} formed in 1967 by Emerson, Lee Jackson, David O'List and Ian Hague to back soul singer P. P. Arnold. After {{replacing}} Hague with Brian Davison, the group set out on their own, quickly developing a strong live following. The group's sound was centred on Emerson's Hammond organ showmanship <b>and</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> the instrument, and their radical rearrangements of classical music themes and Bob Dylan songs.|$|E
5|$|Tsiranana's ouster {{ushered in}} the socialist Second Republic under Admiral Didier Ratsiraka in 1975, but the {{ineffectiveness}} of the regime's philosophy soon fomented popular disillusionment. Persistent in their exposure of political problems like corruption <b>and</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> power under Ratsiraka, Mahaleo repeatedly saw their songs banned from the radio. The band successfully countered efforts at censorship by encouraging their fans to produce and distribute bootlegged recordings of their concerts. They continued to gain in popularity, regularly performing live shows across Madagascar and launching frequent tours {{to play for the}} Malagasy diaspora in major French population centers like Paris, Toulouse and Marseille.|$|E

5|$|Combs {{created a}} merit system for state {{government}} workers, ensuring that officials {{could not be}} hired or fired for political reasons. This provision attracted more well-qualified people to public service careers. Such careers were made even more attractive when, in 1962, the state courts declared that the salaries of state employees, the amounts of which were specified in the state constitution, could be adjusted for inflation. Combs demanded that state employees stick strictly to the rules governing their offices. In one instance, Combs ordered a state audit of Carter County superintendent Heman McGuire, who was known to use his office for political gain. While Combs {{did not have the}} authority to remove McGuire directly, the audit showed McGuire's misappropriation of funds <b>and</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> power. The state school board investigated these findings and removed the county school board members from office; the replacement board members then ousted McGuire.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{integration}} of southern Vietnam into the central administration, newly appointed imperial officials arrived in Saigon. The new mandarins carried out a detailed inquiry into Duyệt's rule and claimed that widespread corruption <b>and</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> power took place. Bạch Xuân Nguyên, {{the head of the}} inquiry, called for Duyet's posthumous prosecution, which resulted in 100 lashes being applied to his grave. Many of Duyệt's subordinates were arrested and 16 of his family members were executed. This action prompted the Duyệt's officials—fearful of their positions and security under the central system—to launch a revolt under the leadership of his adopted son Lê Văn Khôi. Historical opinion is divided with scholars contesting whether the humiliation of Duyệt or the loss of southern autonomy was the main catalyst.|$|E
5|$|In 1514, Las Casas was {{studying}} {{a passage in}} the book Ecclesiasticus (Sirach) 34:18–22 for a Pentecost sermon and pondering its meaning. Las Casas was finally convinced that all {{the actions of the}} Spanish in the New World had been illegal and that they constituted a great injustice. He made up his mind to give up his slaves and encomienda, and started to preach that other colonists should do the same. When his preaching met with resistance, he realized {{that he would have to}} go to Spain to fight there against the enslavement <b>and</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> the native people. Aided by Pedro de Córdoba and accompanied by Antonio de Montesinos, he left for Spain in September 1515, arriving in Seville in November.|$|E

5|$|In 1978, Sierra Leone {{formally}} {{became a}} one-party {{state and the}} All People's Congress (APC) became the only legal political party. Stevens retired in 1985 and appointed Joseph Momoh as his successor. Momoh was accused of corruption <b>and</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> power, and the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) was formed later in the decade {{with the aim of}} overthrowing him. Sponsored by Liberia, the RUF began attacking settlements along the border in 1991 and quickly took control of the diamond mines, whose products they smuggled through Liberia and traded for weapons. The following years saw a series of coups and interventions by private military companies, Nigeria, the Economic Community of West African States, and the United Nations (UN), while a bloody civil war devastated the country.|$|E
5|$|On 6 December 2006, Ao {{was arrested}} for {{allegedly}} taking bribes and having engaged in irregular financial activities. The Macau Commission Against Corruption (CAC) alleged that between 2002 and 2006 Ao received MOP 187 million in bribes from three real estate and construction companies, two from Macau and one from the mainland, in return for which Ao had allegedly offered preference in 20 government works projects. Ao allegedly had assets not commensurate with his earnings: Ao and his wife earned 14 million patacas from their official posts between 2000 and 2006, yet had accumulated assets totalling 804 million patacas (US$100m), equivalent to 57 times their earnings. Ao was charged with 76 counts, including corruption, bribe-taking, money laundering <b>and</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> power.|$|E
5|$|The ICTY also indicted Goran Hadžić, a Croatian Serb {{political}} {{leader at the}} time {{and the head of the}} SAO SBWS government, before the SAO SBWS merged into the Republic of Serbian Krajina. The charges include war crimes of persecutions, extermination, murder, imprisonment, torture, inhumane acts and cruel treatment, deportation, forcible transfer of population, wanton destruction and plunder of property in Erdut and elsewhere. He died of brain cancer in July 2016, aged 57, and judgement was never passed. On 31 July 2012, Croatian authorities indicted Božo Bolić, the commander of the police station in Erdut in late 1991 and 1992, and charged him with unlawful arrests <b>and</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> civilian population, who were later turned over to the SDG. , Bolić remains at large.|$|E

5|$|The JNA, {{supported}} by the paramilitaries and the TO, entered Lovas unopposed {{on the morning of}} 10 October. According to court testimony of one of the paramilitaries {{who took part in the}} events, the troops moving against Lovas were told to expect 300–400 ZNG troops defending the village. Once the attacking force entered the village, the troops continued to throw grenades and shoot at houses at random for several hours. During the assault, 22 civilians were killed in their homes or back yards. In the immediate aftermath of the takeover of Lovas, Croat civilians were required to wear white armbands and their houses were marked using white sheets. The marked houses were looted and torched by the TO and paramilitaries. Authority in the village was turned over to Ljuban Devetak, a member of the Dušan Silni paramilitaries. He was styled as the commander of the village, but the JNA remained in overall control of the entire region. Over the following week, 23 more civilians were killed by the paramilitaries and the TO troops in improvised detention facilities. The improvised prisons were also used for torture <b>and</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> captives, including war rape, causing serious injuries to 18 civilians.|$|E
5|$|In Heart of the Swarm, Valerian helps Raynor and his Raiders {{escape into}} the Umojan Protectorate, where Kerrigan {{undergoes}} extensive testing {{in a research}} lab. The lab is discovered and attacked by a Dominion task force, and Valerian and Kerrigan escape on board the Hyperion, the Raiders' flagship. Valerian is nearly psionically strangled by Kerrigan for leaving Raynor behind on the base. Valerian knew that his father {{would be willing to}} sacrifice him to destroy Kerrigan, even in spite of Hyperion captain Matt Horner warning the Dominion fleet that he was on board, and so he aided Kerrigan and the Raiders in searching for him. During the final assault against Korhal, Valerian recognized that Arcturus was beyond redemption, and asked only that Kerrigan minimize civilian casualties; Kerrigan thus elected to attend his request, recognizing him as a different man from his father. Kerrigan killed Arcturus shortly thereafter. Following {{the death of his father}} and the departure of the Zerg, Valerian assumed the throne and became the new Emperor of the Dominion. He immediately went to work rebuilding the Dominion, and enacted new laws to eliminate the corruption <b>and</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> power that had occurred during his father's reign. These reforms included abolishing forced military conscription and slave labor. He also reorganized a number of his father's secret projects, such as Project Blackstone.|$|E
5|$|In July 1942, South West Pacific Area, {{became aware}} of the {{resistance}} movements forming in occupied Philippines through attempted radio communications to Allies outside of the Philippines; by late 1942, couriers had made it to Australia confirming the existence of the resistance. By December 1942, SWPA sent Captain Jesús A. Villamor to the Philippines to make contact with guerrilla organizations, eventually developing extensive intelligence networks including contacts within the Second Republic Government. In addition, through the Allied Intelligence Bureau's Philippine Regional Section, SWPA began to send operatives, and equipment, into the Philippines to make contact and supply guerrilla organizations. Unique to other guerrillas in the Philippines were the Wa Chi; a resistance unit composed of Filipino-Chinese and Chinese immigrants. They were established to counter the Japanese suspicion <b>and</b> <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> the Chinese living in the country, and had over 700 men strong. The movement was aided by the American guerrilla forces and were also supported by anti-Japanese civilians and farmers living in the outskirts. In Nueva Ecija, guerrillas led by Juan Pajota and Eduardo Joson protected the U.S. Army Rangers and Alamo Scouts who were conducting a rescue mission of Allied POWS from a counterattack by Japanese reinforcements. Pajota and the Filipino guerrillas received Bronze Stars for their role in the raid. Among the guerrilla units, the Blue Eagles were a specialized unit established for landmine and sniper detection, as well as in hunting Japanese spies who have blended in with the civilian population.|$|E
