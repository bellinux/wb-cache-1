500|$|The {{books are}} divided into chapters, each one narrated {{in the third person}} limited {{through the eyes of a}} point of view character, an {{approach}} Martin learned himself as a young journalism student. Beginning with nine POV characters in A Game of Thrones, the number of POV characters grows to a total of 31 in A Dance with Dragons (see table). The short-lived one-time POV characters are mostly restricted to the prologue and epilogue. David Orr of The New York Times noted the story importance of [...] "the Starks (good guys), the Targaryens (at least one good guy, or girl), the Lannisters (conniving), the Greyjoys (mostly conniving), the Baratheons (mixed bag), the Tyrells (unclear) and the Martells (ditto), most of whom are feverishly endeavoring to advance their ambitions and ruin their enemies, preferably unto death". However, as Time Lev Grossman noted, readers [...] "experience the struggle for Westeros from all sides at once", such that [...] "every fight is both triumph and tragedy [...] <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>is</b> both hero and villain at the same time".|$|E
2500|$|At mid-afternoon Wednesday, a {{ship-to-shore}} {{radio broadcast}} {{was made by}} Captain De Rosa, [...] "I am the captain. I am speaking from my office, and my officers <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>is</b> in good health." [...] It was later discovered that De Rosa had made this false claim because Molqi was holding {{a gun to his}} head.|$|E
2500|$|New York [...] has {{the social}} faults which belong to an eminently {{business}} place, {{and to a}} shifting, moneymaking people. Everything there is confused, and every man there is busily pursuing some selfish aim. One who walks slowly in the streets {{is in danger of}} being run over, <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>is</b> so much in a hurry there that, in such a case, no resident would probably stop to pick him up.|$|E

2500|$|When Homer {{forces the}} kids to take classes in a strict rec center art class, Lisa meets an {{intelligent}} girl named Juliet Hobbes, who also likes Josh Groban. The two create a fantasy world that takes them away from reality. They deem the land [...] "Equalia" [...] where they are the queens <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>is</b> equal. However, Lisa soon becomes distracted in school after becoming obsessed with the imaginary land. After meeting Juliet's family and seeing her disruptive behavior, Marge thinks Lisa's friend might be troubled, and after she becomes obsessed in their dreamworld, Marge attempts to stop her from seeing Juliet, much against Marge's original idea {{of trying to get}} Lisa a best friend.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout, members saw manager Wayne Sharp as {{an amiable}} influence. Producer Mike Denneen said, [...] "He's not a dictator; he's a {{consensus}} builder, and he's {{very good at}} it... He cajoles and persuades and convinces <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>is</b> inclined to trust him, including me." [...] However, band members expressed concern that they started out too fast and that they intentionally brought on too much media attention. Members also experienced increasing dissatisfaction with their label. Zehr said, [...] "It's not like the old days, where a label would spend years pumping money to develop an artist... Today it's up to the artists to ready themselves for the big time". He commented as well, [...] "At this point you're kind of turning the label into a bank".|$|E
2500|$|Within ISKCON, {{women are}} renowned and {{regarded}} as completely equal {{in regards to}} spirituality. Prabhupada in his original writings encouraged the complete equality {{of women in the}} eye of Krishna based on the teachings of Bhagavad Gita that soul does not have any gender [...] <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>is</b> eligible for spiritual liberation. He also rebuked several of his male followers for discriminating against women. Since mother is the most respected position in Vedic culture, women within the Hare Krishna community are all viewed as mothers, especially for celibate male members Brahmacharis. [...] "Mother is a term of respect for women in the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), and is often prefixed to the Sanskrit name they receive in initiation. [...] Even unmarried women are referred to as mothers". [...] The women are referred to in this way because it reduces the possibility of the women being seen in an sexual manner.|$|E

[...] "The great-great-ever-so-great {{grandfather}} of Old Man Coyote, who lived long, long ago when the world was young, was very much as Old Man Coyote is to-day. He was just as smart and just as clever. Indeed, he was smart enough and clever enough not to let his neighbors {{know that he was}} smart and clever at all. Those were very peaceful times at first, <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>was</b> on the best of terms with everybody else, as you know. There was plenty to eat without the trouble to steal, <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>was</b> honest simply because it was easier to be honest than it was to be dishonest. So Old King Bear ruled in the Green Forest, <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>was</b> happy <b>and</b> contented.|$|R

2500|$|AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine writes: [...] "Frankly, the {{increased}} production {{is for the}} best, since Badfinger sounds best when there's as much craft in the production {{as there is in}} the writing. Here, there's absolutely no filler <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>is</b> in top form. Pete Ham's 'Baby Blue' is textbook power-pop – irresistibly catchy fuzz riffs and sighing melodies – and with its Harrison-esque slide guitars, 'Day After Day' is so gorgeous it practically aches." [...] While also highlighting Evans' [...] "It's Over" [...] and particularly Molland's [...] "emergence as a songwriter", Erlewine concludes: [...] "This fine songwriting, combined with sharp performances and exquisite studio craft, make Straight Up one of the cornerstones of power pop, a record that proved {{that it was possible to}} make classic guitar-pop after its golden era had passed." [...] Todd Totale of the website Glorious Noise describes Straight Up as [...] "impeccably sequenced" [...] and the group's [...] "best album", adding that it [...] "stands tall against even the Beatles' solo efforts while reaching for [...] band's lofty mid-period gems".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the most}} {{westerly}} {{window on the}} south aisle, the right-hand light shows Elizabeth, and her son John the Baptist. Her book shows {{a line from the}} Song of Zechariah. It translates as [...] "You, my son, shall be called the prophet of the most high." [...] (Luke 1:68–79). The child John is looking at baby Jesus in the other window light, and he holds the words [...] "agnus dei" [...] or Lamb of God. The left-hand light shows the Madonna and Child, <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>is</b> looking at John. This window was given by parishioners in memory of Amelia Tanner, the wife of Reverend Elliston. The three-light window on the south aisle illustrates Matthew 4.24: [...] "And they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments." [...] This window was given by Dinah Cautley in 1887 in memory of her husband William, a doctor of obstetrics. The Cautleys lived in the Manor House where the Cautley estate (built 1960s) now stands in Killinghall. The two-light window at the east end of the south aisle was given in 1887 in memory of Mary Ann Wray by her Daughter Dinah Cautley." [...] This window shows the Annunciation on the left, and the Resurrection on the right. It is possible that the bottom right figure is Thomas the Apostle.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{knew you}} 'd hurt {{yourself}} with that horrid thing {{just let it}} be, and come home, for your head bleeds dreadfully, <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>is</b> looking at us," [...] whispered Polly, trying to tie the little handkerchief over the ugly cut.|$|E

60|$|A {{day or two}} more, <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>is</b> at {{his books}} or his usual work. As for George Warrington, that celebrated dramatist is busy about another composition.

6000|$|... "I {{wish that}} we were going back to Braster to-morrow," [...] she said suddenly. [...] "Everything <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>is</b> {{different}} here. You seem to spend most of your time trying to avoid me, and--Colonel Ray, I do not know what is the matter with him, but he has become like a walking tragedy." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{little girl}} said, 'Little lion was my brudder; great big lioness my mudder; neber heard of any udder.' And she capered away on her one shoe, <b>and</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>was</b> {{exceedingly}} diverted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tom," [...] said he, [...] "auntie {{has been}} waiting for you all the afternoon. Mary got your Sunday clothes ready, <b>and</b> <b>everybody's</b> <b>been</b> {{fretting}} about you. Say--ain't this grease and clay, on your clothes?" ...|$|R

60|$|Indeed, that is {{the charm}} about Christ, when all is said: he is just like a work of art.

Once at least in his life each man walks with Christ to Emmaus.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Mollie, {{dropping}} her voice. [...] "Mother is dreadfully worried over him. <b>And</b> <b>everybody</b> <b>is</b> talking, Eb. It {{just makes me}} squirm.
