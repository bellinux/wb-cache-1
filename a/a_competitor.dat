50|$|Porter's {{four corners}} {{model is a}} {{predictive}} tool designed by Michael Porter that helps in determining <b>a</b> <b>competitor's</b> course of action. Unlike other predictive models which predominantly rely on a firm's current strategy and capabilities to determine future strategy, Porter's model additionally calls for {{an understanding of what}} motivates the competitor. This added dimension of understanding <b>a</b> <b>competitor's</b> internal culture, value system, mindset, and assumptions helps in determining a much more accurate and realistic reading of <b>a</b> <b>competitor's</b> possible reactions in a given situation.|$|R

5|$|Since {{producers}} {{search for}} food and scroungers wait for opportunities to join, prey crypsis imposes a producer specific cost that shifts the producer scrounger equilibria towards more scrounging. Prey crypsis resulted in increased latency to eat the seed and increased number of detection errors. Moreover, the presence of <b>a</b> <b>competitor</b> negatively affected foraging efficiency under cyptic backgrounds. The foraging efficiency of individuals that had previously foraged with <b>a</b> <b>competitor</b> on cryptic seeds remained low even after the competitor had been removed. Thus, the costs of foraging on cryptic prey may be greater for social foragers than for solitary foragers.|$|E

5|$|The tournament was a success, but disappointing for Staunton personally; in {{the second}} round he was knocked out by Anderssen, who won the tournament convincingly; and in the {{play-off}} for third place Staunton was narrowly beaten by Elijah Williams. Staunton's defeat by Williams suggests that Staunton had over-stretched himself by acting as both <b>a</b> <b>competitor</b> and the Secretary of the organising committee.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>a</b> <b>competitor</b> {{on paper}} in 1988, Coates was {{supposed}} to only be a coach and was forbidden to compete. The Australian Skating Union had refused to select him as they wanted to allow younger athletes an opportunity to race. However, the AOF officially listed Coates as <b>a</b> <b>competitor</b> {{so that he could}} train with the others on the ice, and because the artificially inflated athlete count would entitle the Australian team to take more support staff. However, Coates was informed that the registration was only for show and that he was not to race. However, {{when it was time for}} his event, he put on a uniform, defied team orders and skated his best time ever. Henke publicly excoriated Coates in front of the cameras, but stopped when he found out that Prime Minister Bob Hawke had sent Coates a congratulatory message. However, Coates' new Australian record was only good enough for 26th place and ended his sixth and final Olympic campaign. His speed skating teammates Michael Richmond and Danny Kah managed two top 15 finishes each, and Medhurst was the only other Australian to place in the top 20.|$|E

5000|$|Scanning {{competitor}}'s ads {{can reveal}} {{much about what}} that competitor believes about marketing and their target market. Changes in <b>a</b> <b>competitor's</b> advertising message can reveal new product offerings, new production processes, a new branding strategy, a new positioning strategy, a new segmentation strategy, line extensions and contractions, problems with previous positions, insights from recent marketing or product research, a new strategic direction, {{a new source of}} sustainable competitive advantage, or value migrations within the industry. It might also indicate a new pricing strategy such as penetration, price discrimination, price skimming, product bundling, joint product pricing, discounts, or loss leaders. It may also indicate a new promotion strategy such as push, pull, balanced, short term sales generation, long term image creation, informational, comparative, affective, reminder, new creative objectives, new unique selling proposition, new creative concepts, appeals, tone, and themes, or a new advertising agency. It might also indicate a new distribution strategy, new distribution partners, more extensive distribution, more intensive distribution, a change in geographical focus, or exclusive distribution. Similar techniques can be used by observing <b>a</b> <b>competitor's</b> search engine optimization targets and practices.

Other metrics allow for detection of <b>a</b> <b>competitor's</b> success. [...] Little of this intelligence is definitive: additional information is needed before conclusions should be drawn.|$|R
