5|$|The film also touches upon Hollywood's {{perceived}} {{mistreatment of}} women. While the male actors wear masks, which symbolize {{their ability to}} act, the female Extra #13 does not wear any and is instead expected to simply stand obediently <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> male filmmakers. Her only role {{is to be an}} object for men to look upon. The fact that she is able to achieve success by filling this simple role, contrasted against the protagonist's inability to succeed despite his hard work, reveals how differently the film industry views the roles of male and female actors.|$|E
5|$|Chomsky {{argues that}} the multi-party, representative, liberal {{democracy}} that governs the United States is insufficiently democratic, instead advocating a form of participatory, direct democracy through which the ordinary citizens have a direct say in public policy. As such, he advocates that communities take {{a different approach to}} the upcoming primary elections; instead of simply listening to speeches given by the politicians hoping to be elected, they should get together in democratic councils and discuss what issues they want addressing. That done, Chomsky argues, they should approach the politicians, informing them that they have no interest in their speeches, but that if they want to get elected, they must come <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> demands of the people; alternately, he argues, these communities should select their own representatives whom they could then vote for.|$|E

The Casbah, as it became widely known, was planned as a members-only club for Best's sons Pete, his younger brother, Rory, and their friends. Mona {{came up with the}} idea of the club after {{watching}} a TV report about The 2i's Coffee Bar in London's Soho where several singers had been discovered.

Grannis and Baker are two elderly {{boarders}} who share adjoining rooms in the apartment complex where Trina and McTeague live. Throughout their time at the apartment complex, they have not met. They both sit close to their adjoining wall <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other for company, so they know almost everything about each other. They finally meet and cannot hide their long-time feelings for each other. When they reveal their love, Grannis admits he has $5,000, making him just as rich as Trina. But this makes little difference to them. Eventually, they marry and a door connects their rooms.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{telephones}} Scully {{and tries}} to explain that he's the real Mulder. Scully does not believe him and asks Fletcher—in Mulder's body—to pick up <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conversation. Fletcher decides they should immediately report this incident, which further confuses Scully. She goes to Mulder’s apartment (where Fletcher is having a tryst with Kersh's assistant) and tells Fletcher that they traced the telephone call to a pay phone near Area 51 and she suspects it is Mulder's informant. Fletcher is indifferent to this news and Scully yells at him, sensing that his behavior is very strange and his lack {{of concern for the}} X-Files is completely out of character. Scully decides to investigate, and drives through the desert towards Area 51. She stops at a burned out gas station and finds a penny and a dime merged. Later, when Scully arrives at Fletcher's house, Mulder tries desperately to convince Scully that he is really Mulder. Scully remains skeptical and thinks that any information Mulder describes could be obtained in other ways. Mulder tells Scully that he will bring proof of the defect of the UFO and the resultant problems that night, but Fletcher, having eavesdropped on the conversation, calls his old office posing as Mulder to inform them of the source of the leak—Mulder posing as Fletcher. Military police arrive at the appointed hour, and Mulder is dragged away, kicking and screaming, desperately trying to convince Scully. Mulder asks if he would turn in an informant to the authorities in this manner as he is carried away, and Scully begins to realize that Mulder may be telling the truth.|$|E

The characteristics of the radiation detected by Penzias and Wilson fit exactly the radiation predicted by Robert H. Dicke and his colleagues at Princeton University. Penzias called Dicke at Princeton, who immediately sent him a copy of the still-unpublished Peebles paper. Penzias read the paper and called Dicke again and invited him to Bell Labs to look at the horn antenna <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> background noise. Dicke, Peebles, Wilkinson and P.

25|$|Crosby had an {{interest}} in sports. In the 1930s, his friend and former college classmate, Gonzaga head coach Mike Pecarovich appointed Crosby as an assistant football coach. From 1946 until the end of his life, he was part-owner of baseball's Pittsburgh Pirates. Although he was passionate about his team, he was too nervous to watch the deciding Game 7 of the 1960 World Series, choosing to go to Paris with Kathryn <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> game on the radio.

He apparently viewed the complete film just once, and then stored it in his wine cellar, where it remained undisturbed until it was discovered in December 2009.

25|$|Genealogy of Grigoriy Zhukovsky, Odessa citizen, {{attributed}} to the poet Vasily Andreyevich Zhukovsky (1783-1852). The verses and fairy-tale of this poet were included in school program in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and could be earlier and up today. Also biography of Vasily Andreyevich Zhukovsky the pupils had to know. As per Soviet school program from the 1950s and up to {{second part of the}} 1980s or beginning of the 1990s the father of this poet was the landlord Andrey Grigoriyevich Zhukovsky (died in 1817) and as per legend his father was the landlord Afanasiy Ivanovich Bunin (1716—1791) and the mother was the captive Turkish girl Salha, she was named by Christian name Yelizaveta Dementiyevna Tutchaninova. Their illegitimate boy, as per legend, was adopted by the landlord Andrey Grigoriyevich Zhukovsky and named Vasiliy Andreyevich Zhukovsky. Turkey joined the NATO in 1952 and in the 1960s or earlier the NATO was able to watch <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Northern part of the Black Sea, including Odessa. It is why Turkish girl Salha was included in the legend. The landlord Andrey Grigoriyevich Zhukovsky, the father of poet, had Polish family name Zhukovsky and the landlords with this family name left in the Eastern Prussia before Swedish and then German invasion in the Eastern Prussia. It is why Soviet Intelligence wished to present Zhukovsky family in Odessa as representatives of Prussian Zhukovsky family branch. To avoid any person of Zhukovsky family in Odessa began thinking about the Royal title, the legend of the Bunin family was introduced. And it was done successfully. During the rule of Mikhail Gorbachev this legend was presented as the correct version to stop this Intelligence activity.|$|E
