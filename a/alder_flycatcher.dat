40|$|The avian dawn chorus {{is a daily}} {{period of}} high song output {{performed}} predominantly during the breeding season. Dawn chorus performance varies at both the individual and species level. The many extrinsic factors that may relate to dawn chorus start times for different North American bird species have received little attention. In this study, we consider relationships between dawn chorus start times and ambient temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, lunar phase, and Julian date for six common bird species living in a northern temperate rural area. Overall, birds began singing earlier with full or third quarter moon (when moonlight is present at dawn) and with increasing temperature at nautical twilight, and birds began singing later {{with the presence of}} cloud cover and precipitation. Our results indicate that a different suite of environmental factors influenced the chorus start times of different species and to different degrees. <b>Alder</b> <b>flycatchers</b> begin singing earliest in this group of birds, followed by Song Sparrows, White-throated Sparrows, American Robins, Eastern Phoebes, and Black-capped Chickadees.

40|$|Abstract: We {{examined}} how geographic distribution {{of birds and}} their affinities to three geomorphic wetland types would affect the scale at which we developed indicators based on breeding bird communities for Great Lakes coastal wetlands. We completed 385 breeding bird surveys on 222 wetlands in the US portion of the basin in 2002 and 2003. Analyses showed that wetlands within two ecoprovinces (Laurentian Mixed Forest and Eastern Broadleaf Forest) had different bird communities. Bird communities were also significantly different among five lakes (Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario) and among three wetland types (lacustrine, riverine, barrier-protected). Indicator values illustrated bird species with high affinities for each group (eco-province, lake, wetland type). Species with restricted geographic ranges, such as <b>Alder</b> and Willow <b>Flycatchers</b> (Empidonax alnorum and E. traillii), had significant affinities for ecoprovince. Ten bird species had significant affinities for lacustrine wetlands. Analyses on avian guild metrics showed that Lake Ontario wetlands had fewer long-distant migrants and warblers than other lakes.

Number of flycatchers and wetland obligate birds were not different among provinces, lakes, or wetland type.

40|$|Bird {{song and}} its {{functions}} {{have been studied}} extensively for more than 50 years, but almost entirely in oscine passerines. Few studies have investigated any aspect of song in suboscine passerines. This is significant because song development {{and the extent of}} individual variation in song differs greatly between these groups. Learning and auditory feedback play major roles in song development in all oscines studied, but apparently no part in song ontogeny in suboscines. The ability of territorial oscine males to discriminate between songs of neighbors and strangers has received considerable attention, but this phenomenon is virtually unstudied in suboscines. We tested whether a suboscine bird, the <b>alder</b> <b>flycatcher</b> (Empidonax alnorum), was able to discriminate between songs of neighbors and strangers despite limited individual variation in song. We performed playback experiments to measure responses of males to songs of neighbors and strangers broadcast from the territory boundary shared by the subject and the neighbor. Subjects responded more aggressively to songs of strangers than to songs of neighbors. These results further our understanding of the evolution of song and its functions in suboscines by demonstrating that, similar to their oscine relatives, they can discriminate between the songs of neighbors and strangers.

40|$|Assessing {{the effect}} of winter habitat quality and {{environmental}} conditions on the fitness of migratory birds {{is important to understand}} factors that regulate migratory bird populations throughout the annual cycle. I evaluated {{the effect of}} winter habitat occupancy, as inferred from tissue stable carbon (δ 13 C) and nitrogen (δ 15 N) isotope values, on body condition and arrival date of seven long-distance, Nearctic-Neotropical migratory species intercepted during spring migration at Delta Marsh Bird Observatory (DMBO) southern Manitoba, Canada. Additionally, I used a long-term dataset of DMBO to assess the effect of May minimum temperature, May minimum daily temperature, and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) index on body condition and spring arrival date. The effect of winter habitat quality on arrival day and condition index was strong for Palm Warbler (Sethophaga palmarum), Northern Waterthrush (Parkesia noveboracensis) and <b>Alder</b> <b>Flycatcher</b> (Empidonax alnorum). Palm Warblers using mesic winter habitats (i. e., low δ 13 C and δ 15 N values) were in better physical condition and arrived before individuals from more xeric habitats (with relatively higher δ 13 C and δ 15 N values). In Northern Waterthrush, early arrival was also related to mesic winter habitat occupancy. However, <b>Alder</b> <b>Flycatcher</b> showed an opposite trend. The effect of winter habitat on body condition and arrival phenology was more likely to be detected in species overwintering in the Caribbean. ENSO, probably through its influence on weather and food availability during winter, carried over to northern latitudes and affected both spring arrival date and condition. Condition was lower and birds arrived later during colder springs. Furthermore, I assessed whether brighter carotenoid-based first-winter plumage colouration conferred higher annual survivorship to yearling Yellow Warblers (Setophaga petechia) through the occupancy of higher-quality winter habitats. Hatch-year warblers were banded and plumage brightness scored from 2008 to 2010 at DMBO and a subset was recaptured as second-year adults the following spring. I used δ 13 C values derived from feathers and claws grown on the winter grounds to determine winter habitat occupancy of survivors. Independent of sex, I expected higher survivorship in brighter individuals and depleted δ 13 C values in winter grown tissues as an indicator of higher quality (e. g., mesic, higher food availability) winter habitat occupancy. Survival was higher in 2009 than in 2010; however, I did not find an effect of plumage brightness or sex on survival. Brighter colouration apparently did not confer survivorship advantages to males or female HY birds. Most individuals occupied xeric habitat during the winter independently of age, sex or plumage brightness. Further work on the winter grounds is needed in order to clarify the lack of power of winter habitat-occupancy to explain the arrival day and physical condition of most of the species on the breeding grounds, and survival in Yellow Warblers...|$|E
40|$|A habitat {{specific}} bird {{monitoring program}} was established on the Chequamegon, Chippewa, and Superior National Forests in 1991 and 1992 (Chequamegon National Forest). The program {{was designed to}} assess annual differences in bird relative abundance, and to attribute changes in numbers to habitat changes on the forest, or to natural fluctuations in bird numbers. Data collected from 1991 to 1994 or 1992 to 1994 have provided information on annual variation among guilds and individual species, and on relative densities of species within representative cover types on the Forests. A total of ten species (all Forests total) showed significant trends during the monitoring period. The White and Red-breasted Nuthatches, Yellow-bellied Flycatcher, <b>Alder</b> <b>Flycatcher,</b> and Yellow-rumped Warbler increased in abundance over all years; while Swamp and Chipping Sparrows, Brown Creeper, Eastern Wood-Pewee, and Hairy Woodpecker decreased in abundance over all years.

40|$|Conservation of {{biodiversity}} {{is now a}} firmly entrenched objective of sustainable forest management, and emulating natural disturbance has been widely adopted as a conservation strategy. Yet the foundation for this approach {{is still very much}} a hypothesis based on first principles, and there has been little rigorous testing of the approach. In addition, practical constraints mean that the full range and character of natural patterns can never be implemented, so decisions must still be made in setting forest management targets and levels. An alternative, but complementary approach is to select a focal group of species and use their habitat requirements to define the range of conditions that should be maintained on the landscape. In this study, I used a balanced factorial sample design to test the effect of landscape vs. local scale factors for explaining relative abundance of 30 forest songbird species in boreal Ontario, and then examined components of variance, and used multivariate analysis and logistic regression to describe these relationships in more detail. Based on statistically defendable inferences and habitat model coefficients, 13 species were selected, with habitat associations ranging from high to low edge density, homogeneous to heterogeneous forest matrix, hardwood to softwood dominated overstory, young to old stands, and open to closed canopy. I found that variations in amount and configuration of mature forest cover had relatively little influence on the overall boreal forest songbird community, but that individual species differ in their response to these variables. To be successful, biodiversity conservation strategies must emulate the patterns created through natural disturbance by maintaining the full range of forest cover homogeneity and heterogeneity on the landscape. The habitat requirements for <b>Alder</b> <b>Flycatcher,</b> Black-and-white Warbler, Bay-breasted Warbler, Blackburnian Warbler, Brown Creeper, Common Yellowthroat, Chestnut-sided Warbler, Least Flycatcher, Ovenbird, Red-breasted Nuthatch, Red-eyed Vireo, Winter Wren, and White-throated Sparrow describe a broad range of habitat conditions that, at a minimum, describe necessary coarse-filter conditions to sustain the boreal songbird community in Ontario. This suite of species can also serve in developing a "bioassay" {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} forest policy to conserve biodiversity through emulation of natural disturbance...|$|E
40|$|Worldwide, {{riparian}} {{areas are}} {{considered among the}} most biologically productive and species-rich habitats on the landscape and provide important breeding areas for many bird species. In the Boreal Plain ecozone of western Canada, forests adjacent to riparian areas are generally protected from forest harvesting through the retention of treed buffer strips. Riparian buffer strips are expected to provide habitat for wildlife including many passerine bird species. Recently, non-conventional methods of riparian management have been implemented {{in parts of the}} Boreal Plain with the intent of aligning forestry more closely with natural disturbance processes. How bird communities associated with these management scenarios diverge from natural disturbances and how riparian birds interact with disturbances in the adjacent upland habitat are key questions in the conservation of boreal riparian bird communities. To answer these questions, I surveyed birds inhabiting riparian areas with adjacent naturally disturbed (burned) and harvested forest to determine how bird communities differ early (1 - 5 years) post-disturbance and, separately, in a before-and-after harvesting study. Riparian species associated with burned merchantable shoreline forests and riparian areas included Common Yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas) and Eastern Kingbird (Tyrannus tyrannus). Le Conte’s Sparrow (Ammodramus leconteii) was associated with burned riparian habitats adjacent to non-merchantable forests (e. g., bog, fen), while <b>Alder</b> <b>Flycatcher</b> (Empidonax alnorum) and Wilson’s Warbler (Wilsonia pusilla) were indicative of harvested sites with larger buffers (30 m). Riparian species richness was highest in burned non-merchantable sites. Multivariate Redundancy Analysis of post-disturbance bird communities showed greater divergence in overall (riparian and upland) community composition than one with only riparian species. This suggests reduced sensitivity of riparian birds to disturbances in forested areas compared to upland bird communities. However, a higher natural range of variability was exhibited in riparian bird community composition in post-fire sites than in post-harvested sites. This emphasizes that forest management practices do not currently fully approximate natural disturbance for boreal riparian birds. To assess the response of bird communities in riparian habitats to forestry, I studied bird communities one year (2004) prior to forest harvest and two years (2005 and 2006) after harvest. One of three treatments, 1) 5 - 35 % retention (0 m buffer), 2) 35 - 75 % retention (10 m buffer with variable retention in the next 30 m), 3) 75 - 100 % retention (50 m buffer) and unharvested reference sites, was randomly assigned to 34 wetlands. Treatments were designed to represent buffer management strategies currently applied in the Boreal Plain. Eight of 22 species showed a significant response (...|$|E
