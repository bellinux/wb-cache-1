40|$|The {{eutrophication}} and algal blooms {{are problems}} in many Finnish lakes and sea areas. One possible {{way to approach}} the problem is mathematical modelling. If the most important processes have been successfully modelled, {{it is easy to}} calculate the effects of nutrient load changes. This thesis presents experiences on developing and applying eutrophication models. The pre-calculated flow fields are the most important input to the water quality model, so the applications of the flow model are examined in two papers. The results indicate that the flow model can produce typical flows caused by wind. The simulations of the timing of upwelling were also successful. The excessive vertical diffusion can cause problems in eutrophication model applications. The results of simulations indicate that the greenhouse effect will advance and enlarge the spring bloom of phytoplankton. However, the average phytoplankton biomass in the Gulf of Finland will be near current level, defined in these scenarios by the available amount of nutrients almost unchanged due to the insignificant changes in the external nutrient inputs. The more significant nutrient load reductions from the major loading points have a clearly decreasing effect on the total algal biomasses even in one year long simulations. When the nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria was taken into account in the simulation, the results indicated that the phosphorus removal from St. Petersburg would decrease both average cyanobacteria and other <b>algae</b> <b>biomasses.</b> The <b>biomass</b> of other <b>algae</b> might increase in the zone where additional nitrogen is transported from the east.

Effects can nonetheless be observed and proved to be caused by pH modifications. Contaminants can also affect aquatic organisms through physical effects: streams with high concentrations of suspended sediment limit light, thus diminishing <b>algae</b> <b>biomass.</b> Metal oxide deposition can limit biomass by coating algae or their substrate, thereby preventing colonization.|$|E

40|$|Romans, Jews, Arabs and Christians {{built the}} ancient city of Toledo (Spain) with bricks as the main {{construction}} material. Manganese micro-nodules (circa 2 µm in diameter) have grown under the external bio-film surface of the bricks. Recent anthropogenic activities, such as, industrial emissions, foundries or traffic and housing pollution have further altered these old bricks. The energy-dispersive X-ray microanalyses (XPS) of micro-nodules shows Al, Si, Ca, K, Fe and Mn, with some carbon species. Manganese atoms are present only as Mn 4 + (pyrolusite phase, MnO 2) and iron as Fe 3 + (FeOOH-Fe 2 O 3 mixtures). The large concentration of <b>algae</b> <b>biomasses</b> of the River Tagus and the Torcón and Guajaraz reservoirs suggest manganese micro-nodules are formed either from water solutions rich in anthropogenic MnO 4 K in a reduction environment (from Mn 7 + to Mn 4 +) or by oxidation mechanisms from dissolved Mn 2 + (from Mn 2 + to Mn 4 +) linked to algae biofilm onto the ancient brick surfaces. Ancient wall surfaces were also studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM-EDS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Chemical and biological analyses of the waters around Toledo are also analysed for possible sources of manganese.

50|$|Research {{studies of}} the Mediterranean species of coral Oculina patagonica reveal that the {{presence}} of endolithic algae in coral skeletons may provide additional energy which can result in post-bleaching recovery. During bleaching, the loss of zooxanthellae decreases the amount of light absorbed by coral tissue, which allows increased amounts of photosynthetically active radiation to penetrate the coral skeleton. Greater amounts of photosynthetically active radiation in coral skeletons causes an increase in endolithic <b>algae</b> <b>biomass</b> and production of photoassimilates. During bleaching, the energy input to the coral tissue of phototrophic endoliths expands as the energy input of the zooxanthellae dwindles.

5000|$|Demand for {{fertilizers}} to meet agricultural needs {{exerted by}} expanding urban centers can alter chemical composition of soil. Such effects often result in abnormally {{high concentrations of}} compounds including sulfur, phosphorus, nitrogen, and heavy metals. In addition, nitrogen and phosphorus used in fertilizers have caused severe problems {{in the form of}} agricultural runoff, which alters the concentration of these compounds in local rivers and streams, often resulting in adverse effects on native species. A well-known effect of agricultural runoff is the phenomenon of eutrophication. When the fertilizer chemicals from agricultural runoff reach the ocean, an algal bloom results, then rapidly dies off. The dead <b>algae</b> <b>biomass</b> is decomposed by bacteria that also consume large quantities of oxygen, which they obtain from the water, creating a [...] "dead zone" [...] without oxygen for fish or other organisms.

40|$|The abundance, activity, and {{diversity}} of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) were studied in prepared microcosms with and without microphytobenthic activity. In the microcosm without alga activity, both AOB abundance, estimated by real-time PCR, and potential nitrification increased {{during the course of}} the experiment. AOB present in the oxic zone of these sediments were able to fully exploit their nitrification potential because NH 4 + did not limit growth. In contrast, AOB in the alga-colonized sediments reached less than 20 % of their potential activity, suggesting starvation of cells. Starvation resulted in a decrease with time in the abundance of AOB as well as in nitrification potential. This decrease was correlated with an increase in <b>alga</b> <b>biomass,</b> suggesting competitive exclusion of AOB by microalgae. Induction of N limitation in the oxic zone of the alga-colonized sediments and O 2 limitation of the majority of AOB in darkness were major mechanisms by which microalgae suppressed the growth and survival of AOB. The competition pressure from the algae seemed to act on the entire population of AOB, as no differences were observed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of amoA fragments {{during the course of the}} experiment. Enumeration of bacteria based on 16 S rRNA gene copies and d-amino acids suggested that the algae also affected other bacterial groups negatively. Our data indicate that direct competitive interaction takes place between algae and AOB and that benthic algae are superior competitors because they have higher N uptake rates and grow faster than AOB...|$|R
