25|$|The {{first known}} fatal {{accident}} involving a Model S {{occurred when the}} autopilot was active in Williston, Florida on 7 May 2016. In June 2016, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a formal investigation into the accident working with the Florida Highway Patrol. According to the NHTSA, preliminary reports indicate the crash occurred when a tractor-trailer made a left turn {{in front of the}} Tesla at an intersection on a non-controlled access highway, and the car failed to apply the brakes. The NHTSA's preliminary evaluation was opened to examine the design and performance of any <b>automated</b> <b>driving</b> systems in use {{at the time of the}} crash, which involves a population of an estimated 25,000 Model S cars.|$|E
25|$|Full {{automation}} commonly {{defined as}} requiring no control or very limited control by the driver; such automation would be accomplished {{through a combination}} of sensor, computer, and communications systems in vehicles and along the roadway. Fully <b>automated</b> <b>driving</b> would, in theory, allow closer vehicle spacing and higher speeds, which could enhance traffic capacity in places where additional road building is physically impossible, politically unacceptable, or prohibitively expensive. Automated controls also might enhance road safety by reducing the opportunity for driver error, which causes a large share of motor vehicle crashes. Other potential benefits include improved air quality (as a result of more-efficient traffic flows), increased fuel economy, and spin-off technologies generated during research and development related to automated highway systems.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAutomated train driving {{function}} is greatly demanded in high-speed and commuter trains operated by Russian railways. Siemens Corporate Technology {{is involved in}} the development of such real-time function within a "robotised" train control system. The main intention of the system is not only to relieve the human driver from routine control over traction and brakes (allowing him {{to pay more attention to}} assurance of safety) but also to increase train efficiency by reducing the amount of consumed energy. The system under development is intended to be integrated into the existing architecture of Siemens high-speed trains as an additional function. Its environment is constituted mainly of control systems of a high safety integrity level. This on the one hand guarantees that the <b>automated</b> train <b>driving</b> system will not have any impact on train safety, but on the other hand it implies additional restrictions on the operation of the system to be fulfilled.

30|$|Truck and car driving {{differ in}} several {{fundamental}} ways. While {{the truck driver}} has a better forward view, the view in the other directions is more restricted. Also, truck driving entails a lower driving speed and a longer stopping distance due to the great vehicle mass, which, compared with car driving, may lead to more monotony. In addition, truck drivers are professional drivers and this may lead to difficulties generalising results from <b>automated</b> truck <b>driving</b> to car driving.|$|R

40|$|The role of {{the driver}} is {{changing}} now that vehicles with driving automation technologies appear on the road. It evolves from being an active controller of the vehicle to being a supervisor of the automated ride. The driver has to collaborate with the driving automation and remains responsible for transitions in control, in particular for changing back to manual control. In the context of <b>automated</b> congestion <b>driving</b> this research developed and analysed driver support {{in the form of}} a control transition strategy that issues soft and hard warnings based on lane changes by surrounding traffic. The strategy models the generation of a specific type of warning as well as the timing of issuing. The research comprises the analysis of a naturalistic driving study that built the initial input for the development of the control transition strategy. As part of an iterative development process, the control transition strategy was subjected to a series of participant based evaluations. The two driving simulator experiments as well as a small scale field test revealed that the control transition strategy provides valuable driver support for <b>automated</b> congestion <b>driving</b> technology...|$|R

40|$|Driver {{assistance}} systems and <b>automate</b> <b>driving</b> functions {{are being developed}} and implemented on vehicles {{in order to improve}} safety and comfort. Trajectory planning is a cornerstone in this field because it is the gateway for all the decisions related to motion of the car and the safety of the vehicle relies on those decisions. In the present master thesis an algorithm for trajectory planning in dynamic environments is proposed in a model predictive control framework. A linear, varying parameter model is used to simulate the vehicle behavior. It is assumed that a reference trajectory through the static environment, which may not be obstacle-free, is known in advance. The evolution of the dynamic environment and its uncertainty for a determined prediction horizon are estimated based on initial data of the position, orientation and velocity of the obstacles. Taking into account all this information, an optimization problem is formulated whose goal is to generate a collision-free trajectory for the current horizon. This problem is periodically reformulated and fed with new data as new prediction horizons are considered and the desired trajectory is recalculated subject to the new varying environment restrictions.

50|$|The <b>automated</b> <b>driving</b> {{system is}} {{generally}} an integrated package of individual automated systems operating in concert. <b>Automated</b> <b>driving</b> implies that {{you as the}} driver have given up the ability to drive (i.e., all appropriate monitoring, agency, and action functions) to the vehicle automation system. Even though you as the driver may be alert and ready to take action at any moment, you are still giving up the ability to the automation system.|$|E

Up to now, building the database has been the main issue due to the complex cataloging of tool paths. This paper presents an automated approach for cataloging that is fast and universally applicable. Therefore, tool paths are parameterized by probabilistic density functions, which, subsequently, are used for tool path derivation.

50|$|<b>Automated</b> <b>driving</b> {{systems are}} often conditional, which {{implies that the}} {{automation}} system is capable of <b>automated</b> <b>driving,</b> but not for all conditions encountered {{in the course of}} normal operation. Therefore, a human driver is functionally required to initiate the <b>automated</b> <b>driving</b> system, and may or may not do so when driving conditions are within the capability of the system. When the vehicle automation system has assumed all driving functions, the human is no longer driving the vehicle but continues to assume responsibility for the vehicle's performance as the vehicle operator. The automated vehicle operator is not functionally required to actively monitor the vehicle's performance while the automation system is engaged, but the operator must be available to resume driving within several seconds of being prompted to do so, as the system has limited conditions of automation. While the <b>automated</b> <b>driving</b> system is engaged, certain conditions may prevent real-time human input, but for {{no more than a few}} seconds. The operator is able to resume driving at any time subject to this short delay. When the operator has resumed all driving functions, he or she reassumes the status of the vehicle's driver.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Autonomous {{vehicles}} {{are being used}} increasingly often {{for a range of}} tasks, including <b>automated</b> highway <b>driving</b> and <b>automated</b> parking. Such systems are typically either specialized for structured environments and depend entirely on such structure being present in their surroundings, or are specialized for unstructured environments and ignore any structure that may exist. In this paper, we present a hybrid autonomous system that recognizes and exploits structure in the environment in the form of driving lanes, yet also navigates successfully when no such information is present. We believe such an approach is more flexible and more robust than either of its sub-components alone. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system on both marked roads and unmarked lots. I...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{provides}} an overview of Human Factors issues relevant to the acceptance by drivers of technology-based systems within vehicles.
