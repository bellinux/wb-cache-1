40|$|Abstract: The {{development}} of value <b>added</b> <b>services</b> is currently still very time and cost consuming. The TeamCom project offers {{a solution to}} cope with this problem. It offers a simple, fast, and cost efficient way to design the service graphically in a BPEL developer tool. A code generator analyses the BPEL code and generates the value <b>added</b> <b>service.</b> This service can be deployed on a JSLEE application server. The TeamCom project proved the possibility to generate value <b>added</b> <b>services</b> automatically. Nevertheless there are still some problems within the TeamCom ap-proach and not all of them could be solved. This paper proposes an enhanced con-cept for the generation of value <b>added</b> <b>services.</b> This new concept cope with the problems from the old concept and it achieves a better integration into JSLEE. ...|$|R

To stimulate the development of those seamless intermodal transport chains the concept of dry ports has been established. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to analyze how value <b>added</b> <b>services</b> can support the development of a conventional inland terminal into a dry port and how an existing dry port can be further developed by the use of value <b>added</b> <b>services.</b> This conceptual paper combines literature from the field of dry ports with literature addressing value added services; with data obtained through interviews with actors in the transport system. The conclusions indicate that the development of dry ports and their viability depend on different value <b>added</b> <b>services</b> being available at the dry port, once the infrastructure and basic services are in place. Furthermore the availability of value <b>added</b> <b>services</b> may increase the dry port’s attractiveness. This paper provides a platform for further research on importance of value <b>added</b> <b>services</b> for dry port’s development...|$|R

40|$|This {{study is}} about the {{provision}} of value <b>added</b> <b>services</b> by management companies in Hong Kong, mainly focusing on middle class private residential properties. It is found {{that more and more}} value <b>added</b> <b>services</b> have been offered by management companies owing to the competitive market, escalating aspiration of residents and legal amendment. It is generally believed that provision of value <b>added</b> <b>services</b> is able to enhance competitive ability of management companies. Thus, management companies are willing to spend extra resources on the provision of the said services. On the other side, {{it is not difficult to}} find some front line staff of management companies complaining that the supporting from management companies are not sufficient for the provision of value <b>added</b> <b>services.</b> Then, they express that other management services and internal service quality have been affected adversely. These negative influences are not favorable for enhancing the competitive abilities of management companies. In this connection, the goal of this study is to find out the influences caused by the provision of value <b>added</b> <b>services</b> and provide recommendations to management companies for enhancing their competitive abilities in the market. 5 objectives have been set accordingly. Objective 1 is to explore the value <b>added</b> <b>services</b> provided by management companies in Hong Kong. For competing objective 1, a number of value <b>added</b> <b>services</b> offered by management companies have been identified. The value <b>added</b> <b>services</b> have been categorized into 5 groups based on their features. Objective 2 is to study business theory for enhancing profit, growth or competitive abilities of companies. Business theories including profit-service chain and satisfaction-service chain have been studied. Then, service-profit chain has been utilized to be the framework of methodology. Two questionnaires for residents and employees of management companies have been designed mainly based on the concept of service-profit chain. Objective 3 is to find out the value of value <b>added</b> <b>services</b> from residents' point of views. This objective has been completed by questionnaires. In addition, the influences caused by the provision of value <b>added</b> <b>services</b> on the value of other management services and internal service quality, from residents' and employees' point of views, have also been found by questionnaires for completing objective 4. Although the ranking of importance of value <b>added</b> <b>services</b> is behind some basic and essential management services including security, financial management, repair & maintenance and cleaning based on the reply of residents. It is found that, from residents' point of views, the value of value <b>added</b> <b>services</b> is high. It is estimated that management companies are able to enhance their competitive abilities by providing the said services. However, some negative influences in the value of other management services and internal service quality have been caused based on the reply of residents and employees. Both of the residents and employees express that the efficiency and quality of management services have been reduced. Besides, based on the reply of parts of employees, the additional working pressure has been caused by the provision of value <b>added</b> <b>services.</b> Turnover might be caused. For minimizing the negative influences and completing objective 5, recommendations have been offered accordingly for enhancing competitive abilities of management companies. published_or_final_versionHousing ManagementMasterMaster of Housing Managemen...|$|R

40|$|Objective: In an {{automated}} dose dispensing (<b>ADD)</b> <b>service,</b> medicines are dispensed in unitdose bags according to administration times. When {{the service is}} initiated, the patient's medication list is reconciled and a prescription review is conducted. The service is expected to reduce drug use. The aim of this national controlled {{study was to investigate}} whether the <b>ADD</b> <b>service</b> with medication review reduces drug use among geriatric primary care patients. Design, setting and patients: This is a nationwide cohort study with matched controls. The study group consisted of all primary care patients >= 65 years enrolled in the <b>ADD</b> <b>service</b> in Finland during 2007 (n = 2073). Control patients (n = 2073) were matched by gender, age, area of patient's residence and number of the prescription drugs reimbursed. The data on all prescription drugs reimbursed during the 1 year periods before and after the <b>ADD</b> <b>service</b> enrollment were extracted from the Finnish National Prescription Register. Drug use was calculated as defined daily doses (DDD) per day. Results: The studied 20 most used drugs covered 86 % of all reimbursed drug use (in DDD) of the study group.
