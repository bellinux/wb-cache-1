25|$|Gagging <b>anybody</b> <b>is</b> very risky, as it {{involves}} a substantial risk of asphyxia if the subject's nose is blocked while wearing a gag. Using a gag on somebody who is ill or has a common allergy (including sensitivities to cologne or perfume) is also quite dangerous, as most gags make it difficult or impossible to breathe through the mouth. Vomiting and choking also pose a risk, since they further block the airway. A gagged subject should never be left alone.|$|E
25|$|The {{rules for}} the line of play often differ from one variant to another. In many rules, the doubles serve as spinners, i.e., they can be played on all four sides, causing the line of play to branch. Sometimes, the first tile is {{required}} to be a double, which serves as the only spinner. In some games such as Chicken Foot, all sides of a spinner must be occupied before <b>anybody</b> <b>is</b> allowed to play elsewhere. Matador has unusual rules for matching. Bendomino uses curved tiles, so {{one side of the}} line of play (or both) may be blocked for geometrical reasons.|$|E

He and the Bone tell Fern that they <b>are</b> <b>Anybodies,</b> who can <b>be</b> <b>anybody</b> or anything. The Bone and Marty <b>were</b> once great <b>Anybodies,</b> but they <b>are</b> slowly losing the powers. The {{only thing that can}} improve their skills is Fern's dead mother Eliza's book, The Art of <b>Being</b> <b>Anybody.</b> But no one knows where the book is, for Eliza (a great Anybody) died before she could tell anyone about it. Now, Fern and the <b>Anybodies</b> <b>are</b> in search of the book.|$|R
500|$|The Diary {{made its}} initial {{appearance}} as an intermittent serial in the satirical weekly magazine Punch. The {{first of the}} 26 instalments was announced in the issue of 26 May 1888 with a brief editorial note: [...] "As everybody who is <b>anybody</b> <b>is</b> publishing Reminiscences, Diaries, Notes, Autobiographies, and Recollections, we are sincerely grateful to 'A Nobody' for permitting us {{to add to the}} historic collection". The diary entry dates are several weeks behind the dates on which they appear in Punch.|$|E
500|$|With {{regards to}} {{presumptive}} 2016 GOP nominee Donald Trump, Cryer shared his feelings on the May 5, 2016, {{episode of the}} podcast Never Not Funny. Cryer stated, [...] "I have been pointing out, and I have been screaming to the rooftops, that Donald Trump is the Charlie Sheen of politics. [...] I have to tell you, I love Charlie Sheen, I loved working {{with him when he}} was sober, but he was, he's full of shit. He has been full of shit, you know, he has serious addiction. You know, his addiction is obviously serious, drugs, and, but, Trump is just addicted to feeling important. You know, and I think if <b>anybody</b> <b>is</b> under the delusion that he cares about, uh, uh, anybody in America besides himself, they are, they are stoned and need to rethink their priorities, 'cause he's, you know, 'cause it's just ridiculous that's he's gotten as far as he has." ...|$|E
500|$|The scene {{dated to}} Kankō 5, 10th month, 17th day (November 17, 1008), shows two drunk courtiers {{trying to gain}} {{entrance}} to Murasaki Shikibu quarters after she had enjoyed the garden outside her apartment. In the illustration, Murasaki holds her window shut against the men. First {{to arrive at the}} scene is the palace steward Sangi [...] (on right) who opens the upper part of Murasaki's lattice door and inquires whether <b>anybody</b> <b>is</b> at home. According to Murasaki Shikibu his intention is to be mentioned to Akiko. Sanenari is joined by the consort's steward (associated with Akiko), Sangi [...] who also calls out: [...] "Is anyone here?" [...] Murasaki replies faintly, avoiding anything that could be regarded as flirting. Together the two courtiers are requesting her to open {{the lower part of the}} door. Such behaviour, somebody of higher rank trying to enter the house of somebody of lower rank, was in the Heian period considered disgraceful and only excused by the young age of the two courtiers.|$|E
60|$|No second {{invitation}} was required. The company {{crowded and}} squeezed {{themselves at the}} table {{as well as they}} could, and fell to, immediately: Miss Petowker blushing very much when <b>anybody</b> <b>was</b> looking, and eating very much when <b>anybody</b> <b>was</b> NOT looking; and Mr Lillyvick going to work as though with the cool resolve, that since the good things must be paid for by him, he would leave as little as possible for the Crummleses to eat up afterwards.|$|R

2500|$|When {{asked if}} she {{believed}} in God, Goodall said in September 2010: [...] "I don't {{have any idea of}} who or what God is. But I do believe in some great spiritual power. I feel it particularly when I'm out in nature. It's just something that's bigger and stronger than what I am or what <b>anybody</b> <b>is.</b> I feel it. And it's enough for me." ...|$|E
2500|$|American Samoa Governor Togiola Tulafono was in Honolulu, Hawaii for {{an ocean}} policy {{conference at the}} time of the tsunami struck. Tulafono was {{monitoring}} events in American Samoa, but was having difficulties reaching the territory because of communications failures. He told reporters that because of the tight knit communities and strong family bonds, [...] "I don't think <b>anybody</b> <b>is</b> going to be spared this disaster." [...] Tulafono departed Hawaii for American Samoa on a United States Coast Guard supply flight from Honolulu on the evening of 29 September.|$|E
2500|$|Blacks in Dallas County and the Black Belt mourned {{the death}} of Reeb, as they had earlier mourned {{the death of}} Jimmie Lee Jackson. But many activists were bitter that the media and {{national}} political leaders expressed great concern over the murder of Reeb, a northern white in Selma, but had paid scant attention to that of Jackson, a local African American. SNCC organizer Stokely Carmichael argued that [...] "the movement itself is playing {{into the hands of}} racism, because what you want as a nation is to be upset when <b>anybody</b> <b>is</b> killed [...] for it to be recognized, a white person must be killed -Well, what are you saying?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Mr. Poole, don't do that!" [...] cried Phil, in alarm. [...] "Dave didn't know <b>anybody</b> <b>was</b> back there. It {{was purely}} an accident." ...|$|R

2500|$|Visually, the {{presentation}} of the show was very simple, and it did not feature the animation or fast pace of other children's shows, which Rogers thought of as [...] "bombardment". Rogers also believed in not acting out a different persona on camera compared to how he acted off camera, stating that [...] "One of the greatest gifts you can give <b>anybody</b> <b>is</b> the gift of your honest self. I also believe that kids can spot a phony a mile away." [...] Rogers composed almost all of the music on the program. He wanted to teach children to love themselves and others, and he addressed common childhood fears with comforting songs and skits. For example, one of his famous songs explains how a child cannot be pulled down the bathtub drain because he or she will not fit. He even once took a trip to the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh to show children that a hospital is not a place to fear. During the Gulf War (1990–91), he assured his audience that all children in the neighborhood would be well cared for and asked parents to promise {{to take care of their}} own children. The message was aired again by PBS during the media storm that preceded the 2003 invasion of Iraq.|$|E
2500|$|Season four won near-universal {{critical}} acclaim. The Boston Globe {{referred to}} the show as a [...] "taut exercise in withheld disaster" [...] and declared the show [...] "riveting." [...] The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette labelled the series [...] "smart and thought provoking that elevates the artistic achievements of the medium." [...] Season four was listed by many critics {{as one of the}} best seasons of television in 2011. Time listed Walter White's [...] "I am the one who knocks" [...] line {{as one of the best}} television lines of 2011. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette listed it as the best series of 2011 while noting that, [...] "Breaking Bad is that rare TV series that has never made a seriously damaging storytelling misstep." [...] The A.V. Club review of the finale summed it up as a [...] "fantastically fitting end for a season that ran in slow motion, starting and continuing with so many crises begging for resolution week after week. Now the decks are cleared, but that doesn't mean <b>anybody</b> <b>is</b> home free. Nothing's ever easy on Breaking Bad." [...] The reviewer continued to exalt the season, and proclaimed, [...] "What a season of television– truly something none of us could ever have expected, or claimed we deserved." ...|$|E
