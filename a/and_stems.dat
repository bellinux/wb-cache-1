Another Botrytis fungus, Botrytis polyblastis (Sclerotinia polyblastis) causes brown spots on the flower buds <b>and</b> <b>stems</b> (narcissus fire), especially in damp weather and is a threat to the cut flower industry. Ramularia vallisumbrosae is a leaf spot fungus found in warmer climates, causing narcissus white mould disease. Peyronellaea curtisii, the Narcissus leaf scorch, also affects the leaves as does its synanamorph, Phoma narcissi (leaf tip blight). Aecidium narcissi causes rust lesions on leaves <b>and</b> <b>stems.</b>|$|E

40|$|For on-line and intact {{measurement}} of fruit <b>and</b> <b>stem</b> growth, a laser displacement sensor (LDS) system was newly developed, and {{two sets of}} the LDS system were applied for dynamic analysis of fruit <b>and</b> <b>stem</b> growth in tomato plants (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) as affected by change in root water condition. The plants potted with soil were dewatered gradually {{for three days and}} then rewatered. Fruit <b>and</b> <b>stem</b> growth appeared in the dissymmetrical relationship: During dewatering, fruit growth was kept higher even under larger decrease in xylem water potential <b>and</b> significant <b>stem</b> contraction, but just after rewatering drastic fruit shrinkage was induced with rapid swelling of the stem. This demonstrates the interaction between fruit <b>and</b> <b>stem</b> growth through dynamics of water relations along the translocation path in stem. Thus, the newly developed LDS system can be reliable for dynamic analysis of fruit <b>and</b> <b>stem</b> growth...|$|R

Up to twenty five viruses have been described as being able to infect narcissi. These include the Narcissus common latent virus (NCLV, Narcissus mottling-associated virus), Narcissus latent virus (NLV, Narcissus mild mottle virus) which causes green mottling near leaf tips, Narcissus degeneration virus (NDV), Narcissus late season yellows virus (NLSYV) which occurs after flowering, streaking the leaves <b>and</b> <b>stems,</b> Narcissus mosaic virus, Narcissus yellow stripe virus (NYSV, Narcissus yellow streak virus), Narcissus tip necrosis virus (NTNV) which produces necrosis of leaf tips after flowering and Narcissus white streak virus (NWSV).|$|E
5|$|Mycena arcangeliana (commonly {{known as}} the angel's bonnet or the late-season bonnet) is a species of Mycenaceae fungus. It has been known {{by a number of}} {{scientific}} names, and its taxonomy is still somewhat disputed. It produces small mushrooms with caps varying in colour from whitish to a darker grey-brown, <b>and</b> <b>stems</b> of an olive-greyish that fade with age. The mushrooms can be mistaken for the similar Mycena flavescens. They have a mild taste, but a strong smell of iodoform; they are not edible. The species grows on dead wood in autumn months, and can be found throughout Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{onion fly}} (Delia antiqua) lays eggs on the leaves <b>and</b> <b>stems</b> {{and on the}} ground close to onion, shallot, leek, and garlic plants. The fly is {{attracted}} to the crop by the smell of damaged tissue and is liable to occur after thinning. Plants grown from sets are less prone to attack. The larvae tunnel into the bulbs and the foliage wilts and turns yellow. The bulbs are disfigured and rot, especially in wet weather. Control measures may include crop rotation, the use of seed dressings, early sowing or planting, and the removal of infested plants.|$|E

30|$|Overall, the {{regression}} equation based biomass stocks {{were found to}} be slightly larger, associated with relatively smaller errors and least biased than the BEF-based ones. However, because <b>stem</b> BEF <b>and</b> <b>stem</b> wood BEFs are equivalent to <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> <b>stem</b> wood densities (specific gravities) and therefore, the equivalent biomasses computed directely by multiplying stem volume by stem or stem wood density, the percentages of their total errors (as total variance) attributed to BEF model were considerably smaller than those attributed to biomass regression equations, as regression equations were based only on DBH <b>and</b> <b>stem</b> height <b>and</b> ignored the <b>stem</b> density.|$|R
5|$|While {{no studies}} have {{established}} {{whether or not}} these ants contain alarm pheromones, its relative Myrmecia gulosa is capable of inducing territorial alarm using pheromones. If proven, this would explain their ability to attack en masse. Foraging workers are regularly observed on the inflorescences of Prasophyllum alpinum (mostly pollinated by wasps of the subfamily Ichneumonidae). Although pollinia are often seen in the ants' jaw, they have a habit of cleaning their mandibles on the leaves <b>and</b> <b>stems</b> of nectar-rich plants before moving on, preventing pollen exchange. It is unknown whether jack jumper ants contribute to pollination.|$|E
5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium seeds <b>and</b> <b>stems</b> are edible and {{are used}} in {{traditional}} Native American cuisine by Alaska Natives, Inuit and Inupiat people. The leaves and roots of E.angustifolium are also edible and, because of their astringent properties, used by the Yupik peoples for medicinal purposes, {{through a process of}} decoction, infusion or poultice, to treat aliments of the human gastrointestinal tract, and in the Old World for the treatment of diarrhoea. In abundance, E.angustifolium can grow with enough density to disguise wetland and bog. Consequently, it may be used as a natural indicator of areas which are hazardous and to avoid travelling through. Attempts to make a cotton-like thread from the hairs of the plant's seed-heads have been thwarted by its brittleness, but it has been used in the production of paper and candle wicks in Germany, and was used as a feather substitute in pillow stuffing in Sweden and Sussex, England. In Scotland, during World War I, it was used to dress wounds.|$|E
5|$|The red-billed chough breeds {{from three}} years of age, and {{normally}} raises only one brood a year, although the age at first breeding is greater in large populations. A pair exhibits strong mate and site fidelity once a bond is established. The bulky nest is composed of roots <b>and</b> <b>stems</b> of heather, furze or other plants, and is lined with wool or hair; in central Asia, the hair may be taken from live Himalayan tahr. The nest is constructed in a cave or similar fissure in a crag or cliff face. In soft sandstone, the birds themselves excavate holes nearly a metre deep. Old buildings may be used, and in Tibet working monasteries provide sites, as occasionally do modern buildings in Mongolian towns, including Ulaanbaatar. The red-billed chough will utilise other artificial sites, such as quarries and mineshafts for nesting where they are available.|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} to examine the effect of stem {{architecture}} on biomass allocation between leaf <b>and</b> <b>stem</b> <b>and</b> between leaf size and number in plant twigs of woody species. We investigated leaf size, leaf number, stem length, <b>stem</b> diameter, <b>and</b> mass for 282 woody species of subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests in southwest China. Both <b>stem</b> diameter <b>and</b> <b>stem</b> length were positively correlated with individual leaf mass and area but were negatively associated with leaf number per unit <b>stem</b> mass <b>and</b> leaf number per stem length. This suggests that these stem architecture traits can be a physiological mechanism underlying the leaf size versus leaf number tradeoff. The ratio of stem length to stem diameter (LDR) was negatively correlated with leaf size and leaf number per stem length, due to the difference in the strength of the effects of <b>stem</b> length <b>and</b> <b>stem</b> diameter on leaf size and leaf number. Similarly, both <b>stem</b> diameter <b>and</b> <b>stem</b> length were positively correlated with leaf mass <b>and</b> <b>stem</b> mass. LDR was negatively correlated with leaf biomass fraction (the ratio of leaf mass to twig mass), due to the difference in the strength of the effect of <b>stem</b> length <b>and</b> <b>stem</b> diameter on leaf mass <b>and</b> <b>stem</b> mass. This indicates that stem architecture can significantly influence biomass allocation between leaf <b>and</b> <b>stem.</b> These relationships were generally strong when expressed as correlated evolutionary divergences. In addition, LDR was generally larger in the high-rainfall habitat than in the low-rainfall site. Accordingly, LDR can be regarded as a functional trait and {{an important component of the}} leading dimension of leaf size-twig size spectrum in plants.

5|$|While {{members of}} the Liliaceae s.s. {{have been used as}} food sources in humans, the bulbs of some species are {{poisonous}} to household pets (bulb toxicosis) if eaten and may cause serious complications, such as renal failure in cats from Lilies, particularly Lilium longiflorum (Easter Lily). Dogs may develop less serious effects such as gastrointestinal problems and central nervous system depression. Most Fritillaria (e.g. Fritillaria imperialis, Fritillaria meleagris) bulbs contain poisonous neurotoxic alkaloids such as imperialin (peiminine), which may be deadly if ingested in quantity, while other species such as Fritillaria camschatcensis and Fritillaria affinis are edible. Tulips can cause skin irritation due to the presence of tuliposides and tulipalins, which are also found in the flowers, leaves <b>and</b> <b>stems</b> of Fritillaria. These are also toxic to a variety of animals.|$|E
5|$|While {{pollination}} by ants {{is somewhat}} rare, several Myrmecia {{species have been}} observed pollinating flowers. For example, the orchid Leporella fimbriata is a myrmecophyte {{which can only be}} pollinated by the winged male ant M. urens. Pollination of this orchid usually occurs between April and June during warm afternoons, and may take several days until the short-lived males all die. The flower mimics M. urens queens, so the males move from flower to flower in an attempt to copulate with it. M. nigrocincta workers have been recorded visiting flowers of Eucalyptus regnans and Senna acclinis, and are considered a potential pollination vector for E. regnans trees. Although Senna acclinis is self-compatible, the inability of M. nigrocincta to appropriately release pollen would restrict its capacity to effect pollination. Foraging M. pilosula workers are regularly observed on the inflorescences of Prasophyllum alpinum (mostly pollinated by wasps of the family Ichneumonidae). Although pollinia are often seen in the ants' jaw, they have a habit of cleaning their mandibles on the leaves <b>and</b> <b>stems</b> of nectar-rich plants before moving on, preventing pollen exchange. Whether M. pilosula contributes to pollination is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Diffusion {{of carbon}} dioxide and oxygen is {{approximately}} 10,000 times slower in water than in air. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen, becoming hypoxic (an environment with O2 concentration below 2mg/liter) and eventually completely anoxic where anaerobic bacteria thrive among the roots. Water also influences the intensity and spectral composition of light as it reflects off the water surface and submerged particles. Aquatic plants exhibit a wide variety of morphological and physiological adaptations that allow them to survive, compete, and diversify in these environments. For example, their roots <b>and</b> <b>stems</b> contain large air spaces (aerenchyma) that regulate the efficient transportation of gases (for example, CO2 and O2) used in respiration and photosynthesis. Salt water plants (halophytes) have additional specialized adaptations, such as the development of special organs for shedding salt and osmoregulating their internal salt (NaCl) concentrations, to live in estuarine, brackish, or oceanic environments. Anaerobic soil microorganisms in aquatic environments use nitrate, manganese ions, ferric ions, sulfate, carbon dioxide, and some organic compounds; other microorganisms are facultative anaerobes and use oxygen during respiration when the soil becomes drier. The activity of soil microorganisms and the chemistry of the water reduces the oxidation-reduction potentials of the water. Carbon dioxide, for example, is reduced to methane (CH4) by methanogenic bacteria. The physiology of fish is also specially adapted to compensate for environmental salt levels through osmoregulation. Their gills form electrochemical gradients that mediate salt excretion in salt water and uptake in fresh water.|$|E
