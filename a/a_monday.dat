5|$|C. The January 31 (a Saturday) {{game was}} tied 2–2 at midnight and the Mayor of Westmount {{refused to allow}} play to {{continue}} on the Sunday. The game was played on February 2 (<b>a</b> <b>Monday)</b> and the January 31 game {{was considered to be}} void.|$|E
5|$|While October 5 {{had been}} the {{original}} scheduled date for a potential tiebreaker game, a conflict with <b>a</b> <b>Monday</b> Night Football game between the Green Bay Packers and Minnesota Vikings being played at the Metrodome that night led to the baseball game being moved to the following day.|$|E

5|$|The {{third day}} was {{followed}} by a rest day on Sunday and play resumed on the fourth morning, <b>a</b> <b>Monday,</b> with England still 223 runs in arrears. Before the start of play, the Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club (NCCC) secretary, H. A. Brown, broadcast an appeal to the gallery over the public address system to refrain from their heckling of Miller.|$|E
5|$|During this period, no golfer {{suffered}} from the pressure of competing at Augusta more than Greg Norman. In 1987, Norman lost a sudden-death playoff to Larry Mize when Mize holed out a remarkable 45-yard pitch shot to birdie the second playoff hole and win the Masters. In 1996, Norman tied the course record with an opening round 63, and had a six-stroke lead over Nick Faldo entering the final round. Norman shot a 78 while Faldo scored a 67 to win by five shots (for his third Masters championship). Norman also suffered in 1986 when after birdieing four straight holes, and needing only a par to tie Nicklaus for the lead and force <b>a</b> <b>Monday</b> playoff, he badly pushed his 4-iron approach on 18 and missed his par putt for a closing bogey.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Cope {{retired after}} 35 {{years as the}} Steelers radio announcer—the longest tenure of any {{broadcaster}} with a single team in NFL history. Cope was honored by the Steelers {{with the release of}} a limited special edition Towel, featuring his name and catch phrases. Cope was made an honorary co-captain for the Steelers for <b>a</b> <b>Monday</b> night game against the Baltimore Ravens. Cope led the fans in a towel wave at half time; the Towel that Cope used is now in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|E

5|$|Later in 1977, Sayers was {{inducted}} into the Pro Football Hall of Fame and is still the youngest inductee in its history. On October 31, 1994, at halftime of <b>a</b> <b>Monday</b> night game, the Bears retired his number 40 at Soldier Field, along with number 51, which had been worn by teammate, linebacker Dick Butkus. The Pro Football Hall of Fame selection committee named Sayers to its NFL 1960s All-Decade Team, which comprised the best players of the 1960s at each position. In 1994, Sayers was selected for the NFL 75th Anniversary All-Time Team as both a halfback and a kickoff returner; he was the only player selected for multiple positions. In 1999, despite the brevity of his career, he was ranked 22nd on The Sporting Newss list of the 100 Greatest Football Players.|$|E
5|$|London {{also has}} a rich history in {{underground}} music. Noise pioneers, the Nihilist Spasm Band were formed in the city in 1965. Between 1966 and 1971, the group held <b>a</b> <b>Monday</b> night residency at the York Hotel in the city's core, which established it as a popular venue for emerging musicians and artists. Now known as Call the Office, the venue served as a hotbed for punk music in the late 1970s and 1980 and continues to host college rock bands and weekly alternative music nights. In 2003, CHRW-FM developed the London Music Archives, an online music database that chronicles every album recorded in London between 1967 and 2006.|$|E
5|$|On Ganesh Jayanti (Magha Shukla Chaturthi) and Ganesh Chaturthi (Bhadrapada Shukla Chaturthi) festivals on the 4th {{lunar day}} in the bright {{fortnight}} of the Hindu months Magha and Bhadrapada respectively, devotees flock to the Mayureshwar temple in large numbers. On both occasion, a procession of pilgrims arrives from Mangalmurti temple, Chinchwad (established by Morya Gosavi) with the palkhi (palanquin) of Ganesha. The Ganesha chaturthi celebrations last {{for more than a}} month, until Ashvin Shukla (10th lunar {{day in the}} bright fortnight of the Hindu month Ashvin). Fairs and celebrations also occur on Vijayadashami, Shukla Chaturthi (the 4th lunar day in the bright fortnight of a Hindu month), Krishna Chaturthi (the 4th lunar day in the dark fortnight of a Hindu month) and Somavati Amavasya (a new moon night coinciding with <b>a</b> <b>Monday).</b>|$|E

5|$|On Tuesday 7 August, {{following}} <b>a</b> <b>Monday</b> bank holiday, prostitute Martha Tabram {{was murdered}} at about 2:30am. Her {{body was found}} at George Yard Buildings, George Yard, Whitechapel. She had been stabbed 39times with a short blade. On the basis of statements from a fellow prostitute, and PC Thomas Barrett who was patrolling nearby, Inspector Reid put soldiers at the Tower of London and Wellington Barracks on an identification parade, but without positive results. The police did not connect the murder with Smith's, but they did connect it with the later murders. Most experts today do not connect it with the other killings, as Tabram was stabbed whereas the later victims were slashed, but a connection cannot be ruled out.|$|E
5|$|The Cubs {{began playing}} under the College of Coaches in 1961, {{a system in}} which {{decisions}} were made by a group of 12 coaches rather than by one manager. By the 1962 season, Banks hoped to return to shortstop but the College of Coaches had determined that he would remain at first base indefinitely. In May 1962, Banks was hit in the head by a fastball from former Cubs pitcher Moe Drabowsky and was taken off the field unconscious. He sustained a concussion, spent two nights in a hospital, sat out <b>a</b> <b>Monday</b> game, and hit three home runs and a double on Tuesday.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of England's second innings, Miller removed Washbrook for one from a top-edged hook shot. Edrich was then caught behind {{attempting}} a cut from the off spin of Johnson, leaving England 39/2. This brought together England's leading batsmen, Hutton and Compton, who took the score to 121 without further loss by stumps on the third day. Miller battled with Hutton and Compton through the afternoon, delivering five bouncers in the last over of the day. One of these struck Hutton high on his left arm. The batsmen survived, but Miller received a hostile reaction from the crowd. Nevertheless, the English had the better of the late afternoon period, scoring 82 runs together in 70 minutes, including one 14-run over bowled by Miller where Hutton struck consecutive boundaries. The third day {{was followed by a}} rest day on Sunday and play resumed on the fourth morning, <b>a</b> <b>Monday.</b> The Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club secretary, H. A. Brown, broadcast an appeal to the gallery to refrain from their heckling of Miller on the third day.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the previous season the Giants headed into the 1985 season {{with a sense of}} optimism after their successful 1984 campaign and a 5–0 pre-season record. The Giants went 10–6, and Taylor spearheaded a defense that led the NFL in sacks with 68. Taylor had 13. One of the more memorable plays of his career occurred during this season. On <b>a</b> <b>Monday</b> Night Football game against the Redskins, Taylor's sack of Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann inadvertently resulted in a compound fracture of Theismann's right leg. After the sack, a distraught Taylor screamed for paramedics to attend to Theismann. Although this sack ended Theismann's career, Theismann has never blamed Taylor for the injury. Taylor says he has never seen video of the play and never wants to. During {{the first round of the}} playoffs, the Giants defeated the defending champion 49ers 17–3, but lost to the eventual champion Chicago Bears in the second round 21–0.|$|E
5|$|The {{crowd is}} {{notoriously}} loud during Seahawks games. It has twice held the Guinness World Record for loudest crowd roar {{at an outdoor}} stadium, first at 136.6 decibels in 2013, followed by a measurement of 137.6 decibels in 2014. Both records were eventually broken by crowds at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. The current record was set by fans at Arrowhead on September 29, 2014, in <b>a</b> <b>Monday</b> Night Football game against the New England Patriots, hitting 142.2 decibels. The noise {{has contributed to the}} team's home field advantage with an increase in false start (movement by an offensive player prior to the play) and delay of game (failure of the offense to snap the ball prior to the play clock expiring) penalties against visiting teams. The stadium was the first in the NFL to implement a FieldTurf artificial field. Numerous college and high school American football games have also been played at the stadium.|$|E
5|$|The {{turning point}} of the season came {{in a game against}} the Minnesota Vikings in November. Trailing Minnesota 20–19 late in the fourth quarter in the Metrodome, Phil Simms {{completed}} a desperate fourth and 17 pass to Bobby Johnson for a first down. The completion led to Raul Allegre's fifth field goal and an important Giants victory. The following week, veteran defensive end George Martin intercepted a pass from Denver Broncos quarterback John Elway and returned it 78yards for a touchdown. Then in the final two minutes of the game, Simms hit fan–favorite Phil McConkey for a 46-yard pass. This led to another game-winning kick from Allegre as the Giants defeated Denver 19-16. In <b>a</b> <b>Monday</b> night encounter at San Francisco the next week, the Giants overcame a 17–0 halftime deficit to Joe Montana's 49ers en route to a 21–17 victory.|$|E
