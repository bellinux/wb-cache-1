25|$|Some ab anbars had {{storage space}} tanks that were {{rectangular}} in design, {{such as in}} Qazvin, as opposed to cylindrical designs in Yazd. There were several designs for the <b>arched</b> <b>roof</b> of the storage spaces of each ab anbar, namely ahang, kalanbu, kazhāveh, or combinations of these depending on {{the features of the}} storage space.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominant}} {{element of the}} church's design is the parabolic <b>arched</b> <b>roof</b> over the nave and sanctuary. Clad in metal roof sheeting, the parabolic form is created by a reinforced concrete arch at the front, regularly spaced laminated timber arches throughout the interior and a brick end wall at the rear. A raised strip of roofing along the apex is clad in opaque sheeting.|$|E
25|$|The trainshed was, {{jointly with}} the Lime Street station in Liverpool, {{the first to}} be {{designed}} and built in Britain using curved wrought iron ribs to support an <b>arched</b> <b>roof.</b> The large section of the ribs was fabricated using curved web plates specially rolled using bevelled rolls; the novel technique was created by Thomas Charlton of Hawks Crawshay, and was estimated to have saved 14% on the cost of the roof ironwork, compared with cutting rectilinear plates to the curve.|$|E

25|$|The {{octagonal}} pavilion supports an <b>arched</b> <b>roof</b> that is, in turn, surmounted by a clerestory and dome. The clerestory {{is supported}} by eight free-standing, wood-clad, cast-iron columns located within the rotunda and grouped in pairs. Projecting from the pavilion roof on the east, west, and south elevations are dormer windows with peak roofs. Between major arched structural framing members are wood muntins that hold the glass lights on their sides. The lights lap one over one another like shingles and follow {{the curve of the}} arches.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} New Street station {{opened in}} 1854. At {{the time of}} its construction, the station had the largest single-span <b>arched</b> <b>roof</b> in the world, In the 1960s, the station was completely rebuilt. An enclosed station, with buildings over most of its span and passenger numbers more than twice those it was designed for, the replacement was not popular with its users. A £550m redevelopment of the station named Gateway Plus opened in September 2015. It includes a new concourse, a new exterior facade, and a new entrance on Stephenson Street.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the fire}} in 1936 which {{destroyed}} the Crystal Palace passenger numbers fell and most services through the station were diverted to serve London-Croydon routes rather than running along the London Bridge-Victoria loop. The southern platforms became the busier pair and {{the entrance to the}} station was moved to {{the south side of the}} building in the 1980s. A glazed ticket hall, which echoed the profile of the Crystal Palace with its <b>arched</b> <b>roof</b> structure, was constructed at this time on the southern flank of the Victorian building.|$|E

Rigid supports have various shapes, such as trapezium, arch, enclosed type. Trapezium supports (Fig.  8 a) are widely used in gateroads. Steel rigid arches have various patterns: supports with an <b>arch</b> <b>roof</b> beam and two trapezium legs, supports with an <b>arch</b> <b>roof</b> beam and two arc legs, supports with an <b>arch</b> <b>roof</b> beam and two straight legs, which are applicable to different roadway conditions. Enclosed supports are not widely used, applicable to main roadways suffering high stresses.|$|R

25|$|The smelter remains {{which were}} renovated by Kilkivan Shire Council in 1978, {{are exposed to}} ground level. The smelter is made of brick and stone, the walls {{standing}} to a height of 170cm at the fire-box end, and to 120cm height {{at the opposite end}} of the smelter. These heights seem to correlate with the spring-level of the now collapsed <b>arched</b> <b>roof.</b> The internal ovoid form of the reverberatory smelter can be readily seen. The fire-box is particularly well preserved and has a deep below-ground access. Iron staples are inserted into the base plinth of the smelter at regular intervals and seem to be the support points for the rail reinforcing bars which would have originally bound the smelter.|$|E
25|$|The cupola was a reverberatory furnace. The fuel {{was burned}} in a {{combustion}} chamber {{at the side}} of the furnace, separate from the “charge” of ore, thus avoiding any contamination. This removed the disadvantage in using coal, which was far more plentiful than timber. The ore was loaded from a hopper into a concave furnace with a low, <b>arched</b> <b>roof</b> and a tall chimney or a flue at the opposite end from the combustion chamber. The flames and heated gases from the fuel were drawn across the charge by the draught from the chimney and beaten down by reverberation from the low roof. Slag on the surface of the molten lead was raked off and the lead itself poured into an iron pot at the side, before being ladled into moulds.|$|E
25|$|In 2014, {{work was}} {{completed}} on the stations historic entrance. Glazing was {{placed over the}} historic arches and the Victorian architecture was enhanced; transforming the 19th century public portico. The station {{is one of only}} six Grade One listed railway stations in the UK. Opened in 1850 by Queen Victoria, it was the first covered railway station in the world and was much copied across the UK. It has a neoclassical façade, originally designed by the architect John Dobson, and was constructed in collaboration with Robert Stephenson. The station sightlines towards the Castle Keep, whilst showcasing the curvature of the station's <b>arched</b> <b>roof.</b> The first services were operated by the North Eastern Railway company. The city's other mainline station, Manors, is to the east of the city centre.|$|E

500|$|Today, a few {{buildings}} remain of {{the original}} monastery in Spain. These include the winery or bodega, now the oldest surviving building on the site. This {{was built in the}} 13th century during the reign of Henry I of Castile, with the upper floor built as a dormitory [...] covered by a long barrel-vaulted ceiling. Outside of the bodega, crumbling walls, open yards and part of the Gothic roof of the church are visible. The double arches in the walls of the Renaissance-era cloister are still standing, but the <b>arched</b> <b>roof</b> is lost. The foundation of the church can be seen.|$|E
500|$|Nests {{are found}} {{in a variety of}} sites, {{including}} holes in wood, roots of plants, twigs of trees and shrubs, between rocks, in the soil, and under paving stones. Sometimes, banded sugar ant colonies form small mounds, which are less than 20cm (8in) in diameter and usually funnel-shaped and ephemeral. Mounds are not constructed in undisturbed regions where land degradation has not occurred. Instead, the entrance of a nest consists of a smooth-walled vertical shaft that is [...] in diameter. Chambers in the nest have a similar appearance to the nest entrance (shaft-like walls), and the floors within the chambers are typically [...] in length with an <b>arched</b> <b>roof</b> that is [...] in height. Excavated meat ant nests show that banded sugar ants will also inhabit them.|$|E
500|$|The Ballroom, {{also known}} as the Upper Banqueting Hall, has an <b>arched</b> <b>roof</b> and {{according}} to Dean likely dates from the 16th century. It contains rare 16th-century wall murals, including one which according to Dean may depict the nursery rhyme [...] "Ride a cock horse", and another along the east wall depicting a man playing a mandolin. Above the Chapel is the Chapel Room, {{also known as}} the Queen Anne Room, the Priest's Room, and Nevill's Room. It had been two rooms, a state bedroom and ante-room, but was almost totally transformed in the late 19th century into one larger room. A blocked-up door next to the fireplace was thought to have been a priest hole, but is {{more likely to have been}} the entrance to the first floor of the house from an external staircase before the wing was restructured, probably in the late 16th century or the early 17th century.|$|E
50|$|On 18 August 1898 an Act for the {{extension}} of St Enoch station was passed. This involved a second <b>arch</b> <b>roof</b> and six further platforms; they were brought into use progressively from 1901. The station was completed in 1904, {{at a cost of}} £2,500,000.|$|R

500|$|Much of the Nîmes {{aqueduct}} {{was built}} underground, as {{was typical of}} Roman aqueducts. It was constructed by digging a trench in which a stone channel was built and enclosed by an <b>arched</b> <b>roof</b> of stone slabs, which was then covered with earth. Some sections of the channel are tunnelled through solid rock. In all, [...] of the aqueduct was constructed below the ground. The remainder had to be carried on the surface through conduits set on a wall or on arched bridges. Some substantial remains of the above-ground works can still be seen today, such as the so-called [...] "Pont Rue" [...] that stretches for hundreds of metres around Vers and still stands up to [...] high. Other surviving parts include the Pont de Bornègre, three arches carrying the aqueduct [...] across a stream; the Pont de Sartanette, near the Pont du Gard, which covers [...] across a small valley; and three sections of aqueduct tunnel near Sernhac, measuring up to [...] long. However, the Pont du Gard {{is by far the}} best preserved section of the entire aqueduct.|$|E
500|$|It {{is located}} on the road-side from Balata to ‘Askar, {{at the end of a}} row of fine fig trees. [...] The open {{courtyard}} surrounding the tomb measures about [...] square. The plastered, whitewashed walls, about [...] thick, are in good repair and stand [...] high. Entrance to the courtyard is from the north through the ruin of a little square domed building. There are two Hebrew inscriptions on the south wall. An additional English inscription notes that the structure was entirely rebuilt at the expense of the English consul at Damascus by early 1868.The tomb itself measures [...] long and stands [...] high. It consisted of a long narrow plastered block with an <b>arched</b> <b>roof,</b> having a pointed cross section. The tomb is not in line with the walls of the courtyard, which have a bearing of 202°, nor is it in the middle of the enclosure, being nearest to the west wall. Two short plastered pedestals with shallow cup-shaped hollows at their tops stand at the head and foot of the tomb. The hollows are blackened by fire due to the Jewish custom of burning offerings of shawls, silks or gold lace on the pillar altars. Both Jews and Samaritans burn oil lamps and incense in the pillar cavity.|$|E
