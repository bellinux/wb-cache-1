5|$|In 1976, Reagan {{challenged}} incumbent President Gerald Ford {{in a bid}} {{to become}} the Republican Party's candidate for president. Reagan soon established himself as the conservative candidate with the support of like-minded organizations such as the American Conservative Union, which became key components of his political base, while Ford was considered <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>moderate</b> Republican.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the book, Chomsky {{discusses}} {{what the}} Occupy movement {{is and what}} it is demanding, as well as advocating ways in which it could gain greater support and achieve governmental reforms, using historical examples as evidence. Press reviews were largely positive, with some noting that Chomsky had taken <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>moderate,</b> reformist position than they expected of him.|$|E

5|$|Critics {{say that}} if the {{government}} goes for the top of this range inflation could rise up to 40% through the economy. The International Monetary Fund, however, has predicted <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>moderate</b> rise in inflation of just 32 percent. As of January 2010, the official inflation rate stands at 15 percent. The cost of living in Iran, according to the Majlis Research Center, could rise by up to 60 percent. Ahmadinejad's administration contends that the negative side effects will be transient and that the projections are based on out-of-date models.|$|E
5|$|The party {{became the}} second largest party in Norway {{for the first time}} in the 1997 {{parliamentary}} election, a position it also held following the elections in 2005 and 2009; in 2013 it dropped to third largest. The other parties in parliament historically refused any formal governmental cooperation with the Progress Party, but after a long period of work to unite the political right in Norway, helped by Siv Jensen devising <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>moderate</b> liberal leadership, the party entered into a coalition with the Conservative Party, which from 2013 makes up the current Norwegian government.|$|E
5|$|The {{theology}} and liturgy of the Church of England became markedly Protestant {{during the reign}} of Henry's son Edward VI largely along lines laid down by Archbishop Thomas Cranmer. Under Mary, the whole process was reversed and the Church of England was again placed under papal jurisdiction. Soon after, Elizabeth reintroduced the Protestant faith but in <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>moderate</b> manner. The structure and theology of the church was a matter of fierce dispute for generations.|$|E

5|$|After the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty was {{ratified}} in 1920, the Russian SFSR recognized Lithuanian {{claims to}} the Vilnius Region and continued to support them. In its responses to the 1938 ultimatum, the Soviet Union expressed concerns over Lithuania's independence and threatened to abrogate the Soviet–Polish Non-Aggression Pact of 1932. It made it clear, though, {{that it did not}} wish to be drawn into an armed conflict. This stance has been attributed to the growth of a threat from Japan; armed assistance to Lithuania would have required the Red Army to invade either Poland or Latvia and could have resulted in a war on two fronts. The Soviets urged France, a major ally of Poland at the time, to de-escalate the conflict and encourage <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>moderate</b> version of the ultimatum. France and the United Kingdom, preoccupied with the Anschluss, pressured Lithuania to normalize the relationship with Poland as soon as possible. They feared that the ultimatum had been approved by Nazi Germany.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{was equally}} {{controversial}} in internal church politics. He rebuked the Synod of the Western Reserve for de-emphasizing and effectively abandoning {{the office of}} Ruling Elder. He also condemned the governance of Presbyterian missionaries by anyone other than the Presbyterian church. In 1834, he was the chief author of the Act and Testimony, a document summarizing the contentions between the Old and New Schools. The New School resented Breckinridge and those who signed the Act and Testimony, and even some in the Old School camp had hoped for <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>moderate</b> course. The differences between the Old and New Schools widened over the teachings of Albert Barnes, and the New School members were ejected from the Presbyterian Church in 1837. Because of his leadership in the Old School-New School controversy, Breckinridge was elected moderator of the Old School branch's General Assembly in 1841.|$|E
5|$|Convinced {{that these}} heavy-handed tactics were {{the source of}} the {{alienation}} of the native population to Soviet rule, in 1921 Moscow appointed an experienced administrator, Alexander Miasnikian, to carry out <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>moderate</b> policy and one better attuned to Armenian sensibilities. With the introduction of the New Economic Policy (NEP), Armenians began to enjoy a period of relative stability. Life under the Soviet rule proved to be a soothing balm in contrast to the turbulent final years of the Ottoman Empire. The Armenians received medicine, food, as well as other provisions from the central government and extensive literacy reforms were carried out. The situation was difficult for the Armenian Apostolic Church, however, which became a regular target of criticism in educational books and in the media and struggled greatly under Communism.|$|E

5|$|Fearing {{that the}} Exclusion Bill would be passed, and bolstered by some acquittals in the {{continuing}} Plot trials, which seemed to him to indicate a more favourable public mood towards Catholicism, Charles dissolved the English Parliament, {{for a second time}} that year, in mid-1679. Charles's hopes for <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>moderate</b> Parliament were not fulfilled; within a few months he had dissolved Parliament yet again, after it sought to pass the Exclusion Bill. When a new Parliament assembled at Oxford in March 1681, Charles dissolved it for a fourth time after just a few days. During the 1680s, however, popular support for the Exclusion Bill ebbed, and Charles experienced a nationwide surge of loyalty. Lord Shaftesbury was prosecuted (albeit unsuccessfully) for treason in 1681 and later fled to Holland, where he died. For the remainder of his reign, Charles ruled without Parliament.|$|E
5|$|For a time, no overt {{action was}} taken, and the plans {{continued}} to evolve. A further refinement {{of the plan}} was developed by William and McGeorge Bundy on 29 November 1964, with <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>moderate</b> target list, which the Joint Chiefs opposed. No action was taken while these, and other, plans were considered. But matters {{came to a head}} with the attack on Camp Holloway on 7 February 1965, which demanded immediate action, and resulted in a reprisal raid known as Operation Flaming Dart. A sapper raid against an American enlisted men's billet at Qui Nhon on the 10th led to Flaming Dart II. These small-scale operations were launched against the southern region of the country, where the bulk of North Vietnam's ground forces and supply dumps were located.|$|E

Though Reagan lost the Republican nomination, he received 307 write-in votes in New Hampshire, 388 votes as an Independent on Wyoming's ballot, and a single electoral vote from a faithless elector in the November election from the state of Washington, which Ford had won over Democratic challenger Jimmy Carter. Ford ultimately lost the general election to Carter.|$|E

5|$|Teachers of the {{doctrine}} focus on personal empowerment, promoting a positive view of the spirit and body. They maintain that Christians have been given power over creation because they {{are made in the}} image of God and teach that positive confession allows Christians to exercise dominion over their souls and material objects around them. Leaders of the movement view the atonement as providing for the alleviation of sickness, poverty, and spiritual corruption; poverty and illness are cast as curses which can be broken by faith and righteous actions. There are, however, some prosperity churches which seek <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>moderate</b> or reformed paradigm of prosperity. Kirbyjon Caldwell, pastor of a Methodist mega-church, supports a theology of abundant life, teaching prosperity for the whole human being, which he sees as a path to combating poverty.|$|E
5|$|The Clemson Tigers {{entered the}} 20002001 college {{football}} season after a 66 season in 1999 under first-year head coach Tommy Bowden. Fans and college football analysts predicted Bowden would continue Clemson's resurgence from a 38 season {{during the year}} before Bowden was hired. Some pointed to Bowden's undefeated season {{in the second year}} after assuming the head coaching job at Tulane University as a sign of what to expect from Clemson. Most analysts, however, anticipated <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>moderate</b> improvement over the previous year. In the annual preseason poll of media who covered Atlantic Coast Conference football, Clemson tied for second with Georgia Tech. Both teams were far behind perennial favorite Florida State, however. Nationally, Clemson debuted at No. 17 in the preseason AP Poll and No. 20 in the preseason coaches' poll.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclusion}} of new deputies increased disputes within the Junta. He opposed both Saavedra and Funes, albeit in <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>moderate</b> manner than Moreno. Those fights affected his health, {{and he had}} a mild heart attack on 28 January 1811. Fearing for his life, he wrote his will and received the Anointing of the Sick. Three days later he had another strong disagreement with Funes, and had another heart attack when he was returning to his house. He was buried in the cemetery of San Nicolás de Bari, as requested in his will. The death certificate states that he hadn't been given last rites because his unanticipated death did not allow for time. Alberti was the first member of the Primera Junta to die.|$|E

5|$|Velociraptor was warm-blooded to some degree, as it {{required}} {{a significant amount}} of energy to hunt. Modern animals that possess feathery or furry coats, like Velociraptor did, tend to be warm-blooded, since these coverings function as insulation. However, bone growth rates in dromaeosaurids and some early birds suggest <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>moderate</b> metabolism, compared with most modern warm-blooded mammals and birds. The kiwi is similar to dromaeosaurids in anatomy, feather type, bone structure and even the narrow anatomy of the nasal passages (usually a key indicator of metabolism). The kiwi is a highly active, if specialized, flightless bird, with a stable body temperature and a fairly low resting metabolic rate, making it a good model for the metabolism of primitive birds and dromaeosaurids.|$|E
5|$|In March 2005, Mesa resigned, {{citing the}} {{pressure}} of Morales and the cocalero road blocks and riots. Amid fears of civil war, Eduardo Rodríguez became President of a transitional government, preparing Bolivia for a general election in December 2005. Hiring the Peruvian Walter Chávez as its campaign manager, the MAS electoral campaign was based on Salvador Allende's successful campaign in the Chilean presidential election, 1970. Measures were implemented to institutionalize the party structure, giving it greater independence from the social movement; this was done to allow Morales and other MAS leaders to respond quickly to new developments without the lengthy process of consulting the bases, and to present <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>moderate</b> image away from the bases' radicalism. Although he had initially hoped for a female running mate, Morales eventually chose Marxist intellectual Álvaro García Linera as his Vice Presidential candidate, with some Bolivian press speculating as to a romantic relationship between the two. MAS' primary opponent was Jorge Quiroga and his center-right Social and Democratic Power, whose campaign was centered in Santa Cruz and which advocated continued neo-liberal reform; Quiroga accused Morales of promoting the legalization of cocaine and being a puppet for Venezuela.|$|E
5|$|There {{are eight}} {{possible}} endings. The Sole Survivor {{is faced with}} a choice: to destroy Far Harbor, to destroy the Children of Atom, or to inform the people of Far Harbor of DiMA's crime and trigger a feud between the Harbormen and Acadia.

In both scenarios Acadia will be spared, though DiMA will be disapprove of the player's actions. Alternatively, if the player confronts DiMA over Avery's murder, Acadia may become hostile. The Sole Survivor is able to establish a more permanent peace between all parties by assassinating or chasing away High Confessor Tektus, and allowing DiMA to replace him with a synth who will adopt <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>moderate</b> stance towards the Harbormen. The Sole Survivor can choose to make the main factions aware of Acadia's existence. If so, The Institute, a scientific organization that made the synths, will send agents to reclaim the synths, while the Brotherhood of Steel, a quasi-religious organization rooted in the United States Armed Forces, will launch an expedition to exterminate them. The Railroad, a group opposed to the existence of The Institute with the aim of freeing sentient synths, will send an operative to make contact with Acadia, though the latter will reject their help.|$|E
