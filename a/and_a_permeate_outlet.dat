40|$|The {{ultrafiltration}} (UF) with diafiltration is the state-of-the-art {{process in}} the bulk pharmaceutical industry to separate solutions containing high and low molecular weight solutes. By applying UF with diafiltration, a feed stream can be separated into a concentrate with {{a high concentration of}} high molecular weight solutes <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>permeate,</b> which is nearly 100 % free of high molecular weight solutes. The UF with diafiltration process commonly consists of three stages that include a preconcentration stage achieving similar concentrations of low molecular weight components in retentate <b>and</b> <b>permeate,</b> <b>a</b> diafiltration stage to purify retentate by addition of <b>a</b> diafiltration liquid, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> final concentration stage to maximize the concentration of high molecular weight solutes in retentate. UF combined with diafiltration is used after the fermentation to separate the citric acid from the biomass. The UF permeate can then be further purified by using reverse osmosis (RO) /nanofiltration (NF) to remove any remaining impurities such as biomass, salts, and sucrose and thus minimizing the posttreatment. The purified citric acid is then mixed with calcium carbonate resulting in calcium citrate containing approximately 75 % of citric acid. Electrodialysis (ED) is used as a recovery method for the citric acid to replace the lime/sulfuric acid precipitation and thus avoid the production of calcium sulfate as a by-product from the citric acid production...|$|R

40|$|This work is {{concerned}} with the preparation of alcohol permselective inner skin hollow fiber composite membrane using a dynamic cross-flow coating method. The membranes were successfully prepared by dynamically coating polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) on the inner surface of the polysulfone (PS) hollow fibers under a pressure-driven process. The strategy of alternating PDMS casting solution direction was firstly explored to ensure the formation of <b>a</b> uniform <b>and</b> defect-free selective layer. Subsequently, the effects of coating time, polymer concentration, and crosslink agent concentration on alcohol permselective performance were investigated. The appropriate conditions were: coating time, 60 min; PDMS concentration, 22. 8 wt. %; and TEOS concentration, 1. 5 wt. %. Under the given conditions, in the case of pervaporation separation of 8 wt. % ethanol water mixture (50 C), the membrane had a separation factor of 6. 4 <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>permeate</b> flux of 265 g/(m(2) h), respectively. The pervaporation separation behavior of various alcohol/water mixtures with the alcohols being t-butanol, 2 -propanol was also investigated. SEM, AFM and contact angle analyses confirmed the formation of selective layer on the inner surface of hollow fibers. Therefore, it indicates that the dynamic cross-now coating technique is a unique approach to the construction of selective layer on porous hollow fiber substrates, which could emerge as a powerful technique for the preparation of a range of separation membranes.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the self-assembly of polyelectrolyte multilayer membranes (PEMMs) by using dynamic layer-by-layer (LBL) adsorption technique for pervaporation separation of water/alcohol mixtures. The polyacrylonitrile (PAN) ultrafiltration membrane used as a support was firstly hydrolyzed with alkaline solutions followed by alternatively depositing polyethylenei mine (PEI) and polyacrylic acid (PAA) under a pressure of 0. 1 MPa. The PEI-ethanol solution and PEI-aqueous solution were used to investigate the effects of solvents on the assembly process. It was found that both separation factor and permeate flux were improved remarkably by replacing PEI aqueous solution with PEI-ethanol solution. Because only a few composite bilayers were needed to achieve a good capability in the dynamic LBL process, the hydrolysis degrees of PAN support membrane would strongly affect the pervaporation membrane performances. It was also noted that the exposure of membranes to low pH after hydrolysis would not benefit for the assembly. Further studies were conducted to investigate the effects of alkali species on the PAN hydrolysis and pervaporation performances of PEMMs. The contribution of alkali species on the pervaporation performance was in the order of KOH > NaOH > LiOH. Finally, the performances of PEI/PAA multilayer membranes assembled on the hydrolyzed PAN support were evaluated with a relatively wide range of feed temperature and concentration. The PEMMs obtained with only 2. 5 bilayers had a separation factor of 604 <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>permeate</b> flux of 314 g/m(2) h (70 degrees C) for pervaporation of 95 wt% ethanol-water mixture.

40|$|The {{practical}} applications of membrane distillation (MD) are hindered {{by the absence}} of effective membranes with high porosity, sufficient strength, and durable wetting repellency for long term operation. In this study, we developed a facile method to construct composite membranes with high MD performance via one-step electrospinning of PVDF solutions blended with hydrophobic silica nanoparticles (NPs). The characterizations reveal that the incorporation of silica NPs have altered the membrane surface morphology and endowed the composite membrane with hierarchical structure on both surface and bulk layers (three-dimensional (3 D) superhydrophobic membrane). The hydrophobicity of the membranes can be easily tailored by the dosage of silica NPs, and the water contact angle (WCA) of the membranes can be optimized to be 157 1, which was close to that of the lotus leaf (160). Furthermore, the incorporation of silica NPs have promoted the mechanical strength, salt rejection, and water permeation flux of the membranes. The composite membrane containing 7. 47 wt% silica NPs (designated as SIL 40) can achieve a high MD performance with a water flux of 25. 73 kg m(- 2) h(- 1) <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>permeate</b> conductivity below 5. 0 mu S cm(- 1) during a 100 h test-period.

Three different membrane technologies with different permeability and selectivity have been investigated. The mass and energy balances are calculated by integrating a power plant model, <b>a</b> membrane model <b>and</b> <b>a</b> CO 2 purification unit model. An economic model is then used to estimate the cost of electricity and of CO 2 avoided. A sensitivity analysis on the main process parameters and economic assumptions is also performed. It was found that a combination of a high permeability membrane with moderate selectivity as <b>a</b> recycle membrane <b>and</b> <b>a</b> very high selectivity membrane with high permeability used for the capture membrane resulted in the lowest CO 2 avoided cost of 75 Â US$/tCO 2.

Pure hydrogen permeability for an as-received, 5 {micro}m film at 400 C was determined to be 1. 3 x 10 {sup - 4 } cm{sup 3 }(STP) {center_dot} cm/cm{sup 2 } {center_dot} s {center_dot} cmHg{sup 0. 5 } at steady state. Even a membrane {approx} 10 {micro}m-thick, exhibited a steady state hydrogen flux of 32 cm{sup 3 }(STP) /cm{sup 2 }min after air exposure, which, when normalized for DOE's Office of Fossil Energy's specified hydrogen flux with a {Delta}P of 100 psi <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>permeate</b> pressure of 50 psia, results in a flux of 155 scf/h/ft{sup 2 } (exceeding the 2007 target by 55 % and 77 % of the 2010 target). Finally, on May 25, we presented a poster at the Hydrogen Program Review in Washington...|$|R
40|$|With the {{increase}} of population every year, fresh water scarcity has rapidly increased and it is reaching a risky level, particularly in Africa and the Middle East. Desalination of seawater is an essential process for fresh water generation. One of the methods for desalination is membrane distillation (MD). MD process separates an aqueous liquid feed across a porous hydrophobic membrane to produce pure water via evaporation. Polyvinlidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes reinforced with a polyester fabric were fabricated as potential candidates for MD. Non-solvent induced phase separation coupled with steam treatment was used to prepare the PVDF membranes. A portion of the prepared membrane was coated with Teflon (AF 2400) to increase its hydrophobicity. In the first study, the fabricated membranes were characterized using scanning electron microscopy and other techniques, and they were evaluated using direct contact MD (DCMD). The fabricated membranes showed a porous sponge-like structure with some macrovoids. The macrovoid formation and the spongy structure in the membrane cross-sections contributed significantly to <b>a</b> high <b>permeate</b> flux as they provide a large space for vapor water transport. The modified PVDF membranes with steaming <b>and</b> coating exhibited <b>a</b> <b>permeate</b> flux of around 40 L/h m 2 (i. e. 27 - 30...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{evidence}} for macroscopic life during the Palaeoproterozoic era (2. 5 - 1. 6 Gyr ago) is controversial. Except for the nearly 2 -Gyr-old coil-shaped fossil Grypania spiralis, {{which may have}} been eukaryotic, {{evidence for}} morphological and taxonomic biodiversification of macroorganisms only occurs towards the beginning of the Mesoproterozoic era (1. 6 - 1. 0 Gyr). Here we report the discovery of centimetre-sized structures from the 2. 1 -Gyr-old black shales of the Palaeoproterozoic Francevillian B Formation in Gabon, which we interpret as highly organized and spatially discrete populations of colonial organisms. The structures are up to 12 cm in size and have characteristic shapes, with a simple but distinct ground pattern of flexible sheets <b>and,</b> usually, <b>a</b> <b>permeating</b> radial fabric. Geochemical analyses suggest that the sediments were deposited under an oxygenated water column. Carbon and sulphur isotopic data indicate that the structures were distinct biogenic objects, fossilized by pyritization early {{in the formation of the}} rock. The growth patterns deduced from the fossil morphologies suggest that the organisms showed cell-to-cell signalling and coordinated responses, as is commonly associated with multicellular organization. The Gabon fossils, occurring after the 2. 45 - 2. 32 -Gyr increase in atmospheric oxygen concentration, may be seen as ancient representatives of multicellular life, which expanded so rapidly 1. 5 Gyr later, in the Cambrian explosion...|$|R
