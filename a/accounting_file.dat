Within the control system for innovational activities, the effects of the innovative activities on services and products have to be calculated both qualitatively (yes/no) and quantitatively (total/expenses). Control questions on the expenses of innovation are hard to answer, because many of the companies do not include numerous of their activities in their <b>accounting</b> <b>file.</b> Therefore many of the surveys on innovation were limited to certain expenses; expenses related to other companies (with benchmark type) and expenses that provide financial information on intramural, extramural, R+D, machinery, equipment, asset product and the acquisition of external knowledge. innovációs kiadások, ellenőrzési pontok, vezetői számvitel, innovation costs, controlling points, managerial accountancy, Agribusiness, Agricultural Finance, Farm Management,...|$|E
