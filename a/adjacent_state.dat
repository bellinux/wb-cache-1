5|$|A {{number of}} {{recreation}} activities occur {{in and around}} the dam and catchment area. Canning Dam features a number of picnic areas (with gas barbecues), look outs and historic walks – many with disabled access. Bushwalking occurs throughout the catchment, particularly along the Bibbulmun Track, which passes through the catchment about 10km upstream of Canning Dam. Several mountain bike trails run either through the Canning National Park or <b>adjacent</b> <b>State</b> Forest areas.|$|E
5|$|An {{hour after}} the {{previous}} event caused destruction in Upstate New York, a new tornado family began producing significant damage in the <b>adjacent</b> <b>state</b> of Connecticut. The first tornado, {{which may have been}} three separate tornadoes, started its path of destruction in Cornwall, leveling a virgin forest known as Cathedral Pines. At the nearby Mohawk Mountain Ski Area, every ski lift was destroyed, with some lift chairs found miles away. The tornado continued south-southeast through Milton, leveling hundreds more trees, and destroyed the village of Bantam before dissipating. Strong downburst winds continued to cause damage and level trees after this tornado lifted: it was during this period between tornadoes that a 12-year-old girl was killed by falling trees in Black Rock State Park.|$|E

5000|$|All of {{the above}} models can be {{extended}} to allow for more distant dependencies among hidden states, e.g. allowing for a given state {{to be dependent on}} the previous two or three states rather than a single previous state; i.e. the transition probabilities are extended to encompass sets of three or four <b>adjacent</b> <b>states</b> (or in general [...] <b>adjacent</b> <b>states).</b> The disadvantage of such models is that dynamic-programming algorithms for training them have an [...] running time, for [...] <b>adjacent</b> <b>states</b> and [...] total observations (i.e. a length- Markov chain).|$|R

25|$|In 1992, {{the minimum}} wage in New Jersey {{increased}} from $4.25 to $5.05 per hour (an 18.8% increase), while in the <b>adjacent</b> <b>state</b> of Pennsylvania it remained at $4.25. David Card and Alan Krueger gathered information on fast food restaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania {{in an attempt to}} see what effect this increase had on employment within New Jersey. A basic supply and demand model predicts that relative employment should have decreased in New Jersey. Card and Krueger surveyed employers before the April 1992 New Jersey increase, and again in November–December 1992, asking managers for data on the full-time equivalent staff level of their restaurants both times. Based on data from the employers' responses, the authors concluded that the increase in {{the minimum wage}} slightly increased employment in the New Jersey restaurants.|$|E
500|$|The list of United States hurricanes {{includes}} all tropical cyclones officially recorded to have produced sustained winds of greater than 74mph (118km/h) in the United States, {{which is the}} minimum threshold for hurricane intensity. The list, which is sorted by U.S. state, begins in 1851 with {{the start of the}} official Atlantic hurricane database (HURDAT), as provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Hurricane Research Division; the data from 1951 to 1979 is subject to change, {{due to the lack of}} official wind speed estimates during the time period. Since 1851, a total of 294North Atlantic hurricanes produced hurricane-force winds in 19states along the Atlantic coast. [...] Some of these storms may not have made a direct landfall (i.e. remained just offshore) while producing hurricane-force winds on land; some of them may have weakened to a tropical storm or became extratropical before landfall but produced hurricane conditions on land while still a hurricane and some of them made landfall in an <b>adjacent</b> <b>state</b> but produced hurricane conditions over multiple states. This list does not include storms that only produced tropical storm conditions on land in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|When the SPA briefly {{moved its}} {{headquarters}} to Omaha, Nebraska in 1903, Work {{by virtue of}} his status as National Committee member of an <b>adjacent</b> <b>state</b> {{became a member of the}} so-called [...] "National Quorum," [...] which acted as a de facto executive committee in between annual meetings of the National Committee. Work was joined in this position by Barney Berlyn of Illinois, Stephen M. Reynolds of Indiana, Charles Dobbs of Kentucky, and Victor L. Berger of Wisconsin. The party moved its headquarters again, this time to Chicago, in 1904.|$|E

2500|$|MD 267 {{traces the}} path of the Old Post Road between Baltimore and Philadelphia blazed during the 18th century, during which Charlestown was the county seat of Cecil County. The Post Road from Perryville to Elkton was part of the state road system {{proposed}} by the State Roads Commission in 1909. The highway through Charlestown was constructed as a [...] macadam road in 1915. The highway through Charlestown was bypassed when the Charlestown Cut-Off (later U.S. Route 40, now MD 7) was constructed in 1921, eliminating two dangerous bridges across Pennsylvania Railroad (now Amtrak) from the course of the main highway. The western bridge, named Weber's Bridge or Weavers Bridge, crossed over the railroad perpendicularly east of the current crossing and featured a sharp curve {{on the south side of}} the tracks and an intersection with MD 7 immediately to the north. This bridge was reconstructed in 1951. The eastern bridge, named Heisler's Bridge, also crossed the railroad perpendicularly east of the current crossing and had a right-angle turn immediately to the south of the crossing near Clearview Avenue. MD 267 was relocated and Weber's Bridge was replaced in 1966 and 1967. The bypassed piece of highway became MD 913. Heisler's Bridge was replaced and the <b>adjacent</b> <b>state</b> highway relocated between 1973 and 1975. A portion of the bypassed highway east of Charlestown was conveyed from the state to the adjacent property owners in 1974.|$|E
