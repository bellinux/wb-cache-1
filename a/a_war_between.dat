5|$|It {{was clear}} that Edward now {{regarded}} the struggle not as <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>between</b> two nations, but as the suppression of a rebellion of disloyal subjects. This brutality, though, rather than helping to subdue the Scots, had the opposite effect, and rallied growing support for Bruce.|$|E
5|$|The Galatian War was <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>between</b> the Galatian Gauls and the Roman Republic {{supported}} by their allies Pergamum in 189 BC. The war was fought in Galatia in central Asia Minor, in present-day Turkey.|$|E

25|$|Germany {{invaded the}} Soviet Union in June 1941. German {{propaganda}} portrayed {{the war against}} the Soviet Union as both <b>an</b> ideological <b>war</b> <b>between</b> German National Socialism and Jewish Bolshevism and <b>a</b> racial <b>war</b> <b>between</b> the Germans and the Jewish, Romani and Slavic Untermenschen ("sub-humans").|$|R

5|$|After the 1793 {{beheading}} of Louis XVI sparked <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>between</b> Britain and France (see the French Revolutionary Wars), Nova Scotia Governor John Wentworth rented Kavanagh's Island {{to house}} 600 French prisoners {{that had been}} captured on St. Pierre and Miquelon. The commander of the Halifax garrison, Brigadier General James Ogilvie, objected to the plan, and instead housed the prisoners at Cornwallis Barracks in Halifax. Several prisoners were able {{to escape from the}} makeshift prison, and the rest were sent to Guernsey in June 1794.|$|E
5|$|Basically, the {{parallels}} concern {{the presence of}} first-(magico-juridical) and second-(warrior) function representatives on the victorious side of a war that ultimately subdues and incorporates third function characters, for example, the Sabine women or the Norse Vanir. Indeed, the Iliad itself has also been examined in a similar light. The ultimate structure of the myth, then, is that the three estates of Proto-Indo-European society were fused only after <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>between</b> the first two against the third.|$|E

5|$|In the 1890s, {{technology}} {{began to}} change this balance. New Krupp steel armour meant that it was now possible to give a cruiser side armour which would protect it against the quick-firing guns of enemy battleships and cruisers alike. In 1896â€“97 France and Russia, who were regarded as likely allies {{in the event of}} war, started to build large, fast armoured cruisers taking advantage of this. In the event of <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>between</b> Britain and France or Russia, or both, these cruisers threatened to cause serious difficulties for the British Empire's worldwide trade.|$|E
5|$|In the film, Stromberg's {{scheme to}} destroy {{civilisation}} by capturing Soviet and British nuclear submarines {{and have them}} fire intercontinental ballistic missiles at two major cities is actually a recycled plot from Gilbert's previous Bond film, You Only Live Twice, which involved stealing space capsules to start <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>between</b> the Soviets and the Americans. The similarity was apparent in the climax; both films involved an assault on a heavily fortified enemy that had taken refuge behind steel shutters.|$|E
5|$|Kentucky's {{citizens}} were split regarding the issues {{central to the}} Civil War. The state had strong economic ties with Ohio River cities such as Pittsburgh and Cincinnati {{while at the same}} time sharing many cultural, social, and economic links with the South. Unionist traditions were strong throughout the Commonwealth's history, especially in the east. With economic ties to both the North and the South, Kentucky had little to gain and much to lose from <b>a</b> <b>war</b> <b>between</b> the states. Additionally, many slaveholders felt that the best protection for slavery was within the Union.|$|E

Meanwhile, Zwingli's ideas came to the attention of Martin Luther and other reformers. They met at the Marburg Colloquy and although they agreed on many points of doctrine, they could not reach an accord on the doctrine of the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist.|$|E
