Ions are trapped in a mainly quadrupole RF field, in a space defined by a ring electrode (usually connected to the main RF potential) between two endcap electrodes (typically connected to DC or <b>auxiliary</b> <b>AC</b> potentials). The sample is ionized either internally (e.g. with an electron or laser beam), or externally, {{in which case the}} ions are often introduced through an aperture in an endcap electrode.|$|E

The topologies contain a voltage-fed quasi-Z-source inverter with con-tinuous input current on the primary side, a single-phase isolation transformer, and a voltage doubler rectifier (VDR). To increase the power {{density of the}} converter, a three-phase <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ac</b> link (a three-phase inverter and a three-phase isolation transformer) and a three-phase VDR are proposed to be implemented. This pa-per describes the operation principles of the proposed topologies and analyzes the theoretical and experimental results.

The broadband excitation for isolating a precursor ion is achieved by generating the stored waveform inverse Fourier transform waveform in real time.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{outlines}} {{possibilities for}} connecting 2. 4  GW {{of power from}} two separate wind farms at Dogger Bank in the North Sea to the GB transmission system in Great Britain. Three options based on HVDC with Voltage Source Converters (VSC HVDC) are investigated: two separate point-to-point connections, a four-terminal multi-terminal network and a four-terminal network {{with the addition of}} an AC auxiliary cable between the two wind farms. Each option is investigated in terms of investment cost, controllability and reliability against expected fault scenarios. The paper concludes that a VSC-HVDC point-to-point connection is the cheapest option in terms of capital cost and has the additional advantage that it uses technology that is commercially available. However, while multi-terminal connections are more expensive to build it is found that they can offer significant advantages over point to point systems in terms of security of supply and so could offer better value for money overall. A multi-terminal option with an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>AC</b> connection between wind farms is found to be lower cost than a full multi-terminal DC grid option although the latter network would offer ability to operate at greater connection distances between substations...|$|E
40|$|Using high-accuracy {{numerical}} methods {{the author}} investigates {{the dynamics of}} independent electrons in both ideal and realistic superlattices subject to arbitrary ac and/or dc electric fields. For a variety of superlattice potentials, optically excited initial wave packets, and combinations of ac and dc electric fields, he numerically solves the time-dependent Schroedinger equation. In the case of ideal periodic superlattice potentials, he investigates {{a long list of}} dynamical phenomena involving multiple miniband transitions and time-dependent electric fields. These include acceleration effects associated with interminiband transitions in strong fields, Zener resonances between minibands, dynamic localization with ac fields, increased single-miniband transport with an auxiliary resonant ac field, and enhanced or suppressed interminiband probability exchange using an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>ac</b> field. For all of the cases studied, the resulting time-dependent wave function is analyzed by projecting the data onto convenient orthonormal bases. This allows a detailed comparison with approximately analytic treatments. In an effort to explain the rapid decay of experimentally measured Bloch oscillation (BO) signals the author incorporates a one-dimensional representation of interface roughness (IR) into their superlattice potential. He shows {{that as a result of}} IR, the electron dynamics can be characterized in terms of many discrete, incommensurate frequencies near the Block frequency.

40|$|Purpose. The article aims {{to study}} the problem of {{increase}} the reliability of <b>auxiliary</b> machines for <b>AC</b> electric trains during operation in real conditions. Methodology. The peculiarity of system construction of <b>auxiliary</b> machines for <b>AC</b> electric rolling stock {{is the use of}} asynchronous motors for general industrial purpose. An engineering method of influence determination on the feeding voltage asymmetry and its deviation from the nominal value on heating of auxiliary machines insulation was proposed. Findings. It is found out that in case when the <b>auxiliary</b> machines of <b>AC</b> electric trains work under asymmetry factor of the voltage 10 % or more and feeding voltage deviation from the nominal order 0. 6 relative unit then it is possible the overheat of their isolation, even if it has class H.

For the first time the issue of the total insulation heating under such boundary parameters combinations of energy quality, when each of them contributes to the heating insulation increase as compared to the nominal regime of the "rotating phase splitter−auxiliary machinery" system was illuminated.

40|$|Purpose. In {{this paper}} it is {{necessary}} to analyze increase the efficiency of <b>auxiliary</b> machinesof <b>AC</b> electric trains, series ER 9 M during operating under the real conditions. Methodology. An engineering method to determine the relative reduction of the lifetime of asynchronous motors, selected with a certain design factor of power reserve, under normal operating conditions and with decrease of the electric power supply quality in auxiliary circuits of rolling stock, which takes place in real operation in sections of Ukrzaliznytsia was proposed. Findings. As a result of a study, conducted by the author it was found that long-term operation of asynchronous motors, selected with a sufficient reserve of power kз = 1, 6, when the supply voltage unbalance is 16 … 20 % leads to a reduction of their lifetime on 9, 5 … 33, 2 %, {{depending on the type of}} motors. It proves that the choice of auxiliary machines with a large margin of power is not a rational way to increase the efficiency of auxiliary machines of electric trains, series ER 9 M. Recommendations were suggested for the introductions of symmetry-balancing and protective devices based on modern microprocessor and microcontroller hardware components. They make impossible operation of auxiliary machines during a low level of electric energy quality in onboard electric circuits of AC electric train in general, and on the trains, series ER 9 M in particular. Originality.

In the present study, we examined the effect of repeated defoliation of in vitro grown barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) on the spore and <b>auxiliary</b> cell (<b>AC)</b> production dynamics of a presumed r-strategist (Glomus intraradices) and a presumed K-strategist (Dentiscutata reticulata). Glomus intraradices modulated the production of spores directly to C availability, showing direct investment in reproduction as expected for r-strategists. In contrast, AC production of D. reticulata was not affected after a single defoliation and thus showed higher resistance to fluctuating C levels, as expected for K-strategists. Our results demonstrate that plant defoliation affects the production of extraradical C storage structures of G. intraradices and D. reticulata differently. Our results contribute towards revealing differences in LHS among AM fungal species, a step further towards understanding their community dynamics in natural ecosystems and agroenvironments...|$|R

The research findings are applicable to electric vehicles (EV), internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, and hybrids. An EV-converted Ford Focus was configured to operate the AC compressor solely from kinetic energy recovered from the drive train when coasting or slowing down. Test drives with the Ford Focus with standard AC operation increased the energy consumption by 11. 6 % compared with AC off, yet when the vehicle was synchronised with the drive train the energy consumption increased by only 5. 8 % compared with AC off, an energy saving of 8. 1 Wh km- 1. The configuration maintained comfortable cabin conditions (temperature and humidity) similar to driving with a standard AC system configuration. In vehicles with an interconnected automatic AC and engine management system data-bus, this efficiency improvement may require a software update only...|$|R

However, this data rate is constrained by the available energy at each node as well as link capacity.

It then searches for a neighboring solution that yields a higher max flow rate, and 3) LagOP, which approximates the said MILP using Lagrangian and sub-gradient optimization.
