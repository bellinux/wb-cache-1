40|$|<b>Audiovisual</b> <b>performance</b> is {{a fertile}} area for {{creative}} expression, an intersection of experimental cinema and computer music {{that has seen}} a groundswell of interest in recent years. To create works in this emerging medium, a complex network of relationships between sounds, images and sensor input must be organized. This complexity poses major technical and aesthetic challenges which a systematic approach can help address. This paper presents an analysis of <b>audiovisual</b> <b>performance</b> as two parts: a real time simulation which produces dynamic form, and a visualization by which that form is aestheticized. This approach to a systematic study, or poetics, of the medium is drawn {{from the study of}} successful works as well as from film theory and cognitive psychology. Recent audiovisual work by the author is discussed, and technical details are presented. Approaching <b>audiovisual</b> <b>performance</b> as real time simulation provides a practical framework for collaboration between artists and researchers in aesthetic visualization.
