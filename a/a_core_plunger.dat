40|$|A novel design-for-test (DFT) {{technique}} is presented for designing <b>a</b> <b>core</b> with <b>a</b> "virtual scan chain" which looks (to the system integrator) {{like it is}} shorter than the real scan chain inside the core.

For the system integrator, testing <b>a</b> <b>core</b> with <b>a</b> virtual scan chain is identical to testing <b>a</b> <b>core</b> with <b>a</b> normal scan chain. The {{only difference is that}} the virtual scan chain is much shorter so the size of the scan vectors and output response is smaller resulting in less test data and fewer scan shift cycles. The process of mapping the virtual scan vectors to real scan vectors is handled inside the core and is completely transparent to the system integrator. It is done by using LFSRs to "expand" the shorter virtual test vector into a full test vector. Results indicate that virtual scan chains can be designed which are several times shorter than the real scan chains inside t [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the problem of finding <b>a</b> <b>core</b> of limited length in <b>a</b> tree. <b>A</b> <b>core</b> is <b>a</b> path, which minimizes {{the sum of the}} distances to all nodes in the tree. This problem has been examined under different constraints on the tree and on the set of paths, from which the core can be chosen. For all cases, we present linear or almost linear time algorithms, which improves the previous results. As Minieka and Patel observes (J. Algorithms, Vol. 4, 1983), the problem of finding <b>a</b> <b>core</b> of limited length would be simplified, if the core always contained the median, m.
