500|$|Altair (...) , also {{designated}} AlphaAquilae (αAquilae, abbreviated AlphaAql, αAql), is {{the brightest}} star in the constellation of Aquila and the twelfth brightest star in the night sky. It is currently in the G-cloud—a nearby <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> and dust known as an interstellar cloud. Altair is an A-type main sequence star with an apparent visual magnitude of 0.77 {{and is one of the}} vertices of the asterism known as the Summer Triangle (the other two vertices are marked by Deneb and Vega). It is 16.7 light-years (5.13 parsecs) from the Sun and is one of the closest stars visible to the naked eye.|$|E
500|$|The {{formation}} of giant planets {{is a more}} complicated process. It is thought to occur beyond the frost line, where planetary embryos mainly are made of various types of ice. As a result, they are several times more massive than in the inner part of the protoplanetary disk. What follows after the embryo formation is not completely clear. Some embryos appear {{to continue to grow}} and eventually reach 5–10 Earth masses—the threshold value, which is necessary to begin accretion of the hydrogen–helium gas from the disk. The <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> by the core is initially a slow process, which continues for several million years, but after the forming protoplanet reaches about 30 Earth masses (...) it accelerates and proceeds in a runaway manner. Jupiter- and Saturn-like planets are thought to accumulate the bulk of their mass during only 10,000years. The accretion stops when the gas is exhausted. The formed planets can migrate over long distances during or after their formation. Ice giants such as Uranus and Neptune are thought to be failed cores, which formed too late when the disk had almost disappeared.|$|E
60|$|The most {{important}} part of Jack's duties consisted in going round the pit before the men went down in the morning, to see that there was no <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> in the night, and that the ventilation was going on properly. The deputy usually takes a helper with him, and Jack had chosen his friend Harry for the post--as in the event of finding gas, it has to be dispersed by beating it with an empty sack, so as to cause a disturbance of the air, or, if the accumulation be important, by putting up a temporary bratticing, or partition, formed of cotton cloth stretched on a framework, {{in such a way as}} to turn a strong current of air across the spot where the gas is accumulating, or from which it is issuing. The gas is visible to the eye as a sort of dull fog or smoke. If the accumulation is serious, the main body of miners are not allowed to descend into the mine until the viewer has, with assistance, succeeded in completely dispersing it.|$|E

5000|$|The bloat stage {{provides}} the first clear visual sign that microbial proliferation is underway. In this stage, anaerobic metabolism takes place, {{leading to the}} <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases,</b> such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrogen. The <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> within the bodily cavity causes the distention of the abdomen and gives a cadaver its overall bloated appearance. [...] The gases produced also cause natural liquids and liquefying tissues to become frothy. [...] As the pressure <b>of</b> the <b>gases</b> within the body increases, fluids are forced to escape from natural orifices, such as the nose, mouth, and anus, and enter the surrounding environment. The buildup of pressure combined {{with the loss of}} integrity of the skin may also cause the body to rupture.|$|R

50|$|A Buchholz relay is {{a safety}} device sensing the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> in large {{oil-filled}} transformers, which will alarm on slow <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> or {{shut down the}} transformer if gas is produced rapidly in the transformer oil. The contacts are not operated by an electric current but by the pressure of accumulated gas or oil flow.|$|E

50|$|L183 or L134N is a much-studied pre-stellar core in the {{constellation}} Serpens Cauda 360 light-years away.

50|$|The term {{floating}} {{island is}} sometimes used for <b>accumulations</b> <b>of</b> vegetation free-floating within {{a body of}} water. Due {{to the lack of}} currents and tides, these are more frequently found in lakes than in rivers or the open sea. Peaty masses of vegetable matter from shallow lake floors may rise due to the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> during decomposition, and will often float for a considerable time, becoming ephemeral islands until the gas has dissipated enough for the vegetation to return to the lake floor.|$|R

30|$|Based on reserve {{abundance}}, large gas {{fields in}} China {{can be divided}} into two types: type one of high abundance large gas fields, dominated by structural gas reservoirs; type two of low abundance large gas fields, dominated by stratigraphic and lithologic gas reservoirs. The formation of these two types <b>of</b> large <b>gas</b> fields is related to the highly efficient <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> natural <b>gas.</b> The <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> high abundance <b>gas</b> fields is dependent on the rapid maturation of the source kitchen and huge residual pressure difference between the gas source kitchen and reservoir, which is the strong driving force for natural gas migration to traps. Whereas the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> low abundance <b>gas</b> fields is more complicated, involving both volume flow charge during the burial stage and diffusion flow charge during the uplift stage, which results in large area <b>accumulation</b> and preservation <b>of</b> natural <b>gas</b> in low porosity and low permeability reservoirs. This conclusion should assist gas exploration in different geological settings.|$|R
5000|$|An {{isolated}} distended loop of bowel is seen {{near the}} site of injured viscus or inflamed organ. This loop is called a [...] "sentinel loop." [...] It arises from the body's efforts to localize traumatic or inflammatory lesions. The local distention of that intestinal loop is due to local paralysis and <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> in the intestinal loop.|$|E
5000|$|Attempting to {{recharge}} a discharged alkaline battery {{can cause the}} production of gas within the canister. As the canister is normally sealed, pressure generated by rapid <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> can open the pressure relief seal and cause leakage of electrolyte. Potassium hydroxide in the electrolyte is corrosive and may cause injury and damage, particularly corroding the battery contacts in the equipment.|$|E
50|$|Tunnel entrances {{were most}} {{often at the}} bottom of deep shafts. From here, using the clay-kicking technique, the tunnels were aligned and given {{direction}} by the simple use of candlelight. They were built on a slight uphill gradient of between 1:100 and 1:50 to keep them as dry as possible. This meant that they were also vulnerable to the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> at the digging face.|$|E
5000|$|If insects have access, maggots {{hatch and}} begin to feed on the body's tissues. [...] Maggot activity, {{typically}} confined to natural orifices, and masses under the skin, causes the skin to slip, and hair to detach from the skin. [...] Maggot feeding, and the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> within the body, eventually leads to post-mortem skin ruptures which will then further allow purging <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> and fluids into the surrounding environment. [...] Ruptures in the skin allow oxygen to re-enter the body and provide more surface area {{for the development of}} fly larvae and the activity of aerobic microorganisms. [...] The purging <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> and fluids results in the strong distinctive odors associated with decay.|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} global warming can seem {{overwhelming}} and complex, but the scientific explanation for the phenomenon is relatively simple. Earth has a built-in system for temperature control made up <b>of</b> <b>gasses</b> in the planet's atmosphere. When the sun's rays strike and warm the Earth, these gasses operate like a blanket, trapping some of the sun's warmth inside and allowing some of the heat to be released into space. This process warms the Earth {{enough to make it}} hospitable for living organisms. Human destruction of forests and other natural areas and our use of fossil fuels such as oil and coal have caused an unnatural <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gasses</b> like carbon dioxide (CO 2) and other heat-trapping gasses in the atmosphere. This <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> excess <b>gasses</b> has caused rapid warming the likes of which the Earth has never seen before. It is as if we have added a second blanket under which the Earth and its inhabitants are now being stifled. It is the impacts of this human-caused global warming that Defenders is concerned with.

30|$|Composite {{tight gas}} {{reservoirs}} {{are characterized by}} the following features: the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> tight <b>gas</b> in structurally high and low areas; the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> tight <b>gas</b> within sweet spots that are also gas-bearing in tight sandstone regions; gas-bearing properties within sand bodies that connect to the source regions; and high and low pressure anomalies within tight gas reservoir formation. Therefore, composite tight gas reservoirs are distributed widely, are not constrained by structural and trap conditions, and exhibit gas-bearing properties and enormous reserves but with complex gas–water distribution and no clear edge or bottom water areas. Hydrocarbon accumulation and preservation also significantly depend on subsequent tectonic movement processes (Pang et al. 2013, 2014).|$|R
50|$|Depending on the model, {{the relay}} has {{multiple}} methods {{to detect a}} failing transformer. On a slow <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas,</b> due perhaps to slight overload, gas produced by decomposition of insulating oil accumulates {{in the top of}} the relay and forces the oil level down. A float switch in the relay is used to initiate an alarm signal. Depending on design, a second float may also serve to detect slow oil leaks.|$|E
50|$|Volvulus causes {{severe pain}} and {{progressive}} {{injury to the}} intestinal wall, with <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> and fluid in {{the portion of the}} bowel obstructed. Ultimately, this can result in necrosis of the affected intestinal wall, acidosis, and death. This is known as a closed loop obstruction because there exists an isolated ("closed") loop of bowel. Acute volvulus often requires immediate surgical intervention to untwist the affected segment of bowel and possibly resect any unsalvageable portion.|$|E
50|$|Oil filled {{transformers}} with a conservator (oil reservoir) {{may have}} a gas detector relay (Buchholz relay). These safety devices detect the buildup of gas inside the transformer due to corona discharge, overheating, or an internal electric arc. On a slow <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas,</b> or rapid pressure rise, these devices can trip a protective circuit breaker to remove power from the transformer. Transformers without conservators are usually equipped with sudden pressure relays, which perform a similar function as the Buchholz relay.|$|E
50|$|Gas-vaculate {{cyanobacterium}} are {{the ones}} generally responsible for water-blooms. They {{have the ability to}} float due to the <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> within their vacuole, and the role of turgor pressure and its effect on the capacity of these vacuoles has been observed in varying scientific papers. It is noted that the higher the turgor pressure, the lower the capacity of the gas-vacuoles in different cyanobacterium. Experiments used to correlate osmosis and turgor pressure in prokaryotes have been used to show how diffusion of solutes into the cell have a play on turgor pressure within the cell.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we have proven that the {{resistance}} to <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gases</b> in vacuum tubes is not always negligible. The process <b>of</b> <b>accumulation</b> was described using the Fick's second law of diffusion. The diffusion coefficient was assumed constant and evaluated, depending on pressure, considering Knudsen diffusion, molecular diffusion, {{or a combination of}} them. Experimental system with tubes of different lengths and diameters was built and equipped with two high sensitivity pressure transducers to measure the dynamic pressure difference along the system during gas flow experiments. Two cases were considered. First, the governing partial differential equation was solved analytically assuming a constant flow <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> into the system. Experimentally, a low-flow mass flow controller provided the constant flow <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> into the system. In the second case, the governing partial differential equation was solved numerically assuming a time-dependent flow <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> given by the Barrer equation.

50|$|None of the {{commonly}} available neutron sources are adequate for fusion materials testing for various reasons. The <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> {{in the material}} microstructure is intimately related to {{the energy of the}} colliding neutrons. Due to the sensitivity of materials to the specificities in the irradiation conditions, such as the α-particle generation/dpa ratio at damage levels above 15 dpa per year of operation under temperature controlled conditions, material tests require the neutron source to be comparable to a fusion reactor environment.|$|E
50|$|An {{interstellar}} cloud is {{the generic}} name given to an <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas,</b> plasma, and dust in our and other galaxies. Put differently, an interstellar cloud is a denser-than-average {{region of the}} interstellar medium. Depending on the density, size, and temperature of a given cloud, the hydrogen in it can be neutral (H I regions), ionized (H II regions) (i.e. a plasma), or molecular (molecular clouds). Neutral and ionized clouds are sometimes also called diffuse clouds, while molecular clouds are sometimes {{also referred to as}} dense clouds.|$|E
5000|$|Babies are {{particularly}} subject to <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> {{in the stomach}} while feeding, and this can cause considerable discomfort and agitation unless the child is burped. The act of burping an infant involves placing the child in a position conducive to gas expulsion (for example holding the infant up to the adult's shoulder, with the infant's stomach resting on the adult's chest) and then lightly patting the lower back so that the child burps. Because burping can cause vomiting in infants, a [...] "burp cloth" [...] or [...] "burp pad" [...] is sometimes employed on the shoulder to protect the adult's clothing.|$|E

50|$|Consequently, the Government {{appointed}} barrister Mr J Roskill to scrutinise the evidence. Roskill in his September 1894 report {{submitted to}} the Home Secretary was {{of the opinion that}} the explosion was caused by the blasting of timbers which ignited an <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas,</b> which ignited the coal dust. Roskill concluded the risk was increased by dangerous working practices, including blasting of timbers during shifts, inadequate watering of the mine to lay dust and new Saturday shift patterns, so that there was no interval for clearing dust between shifts. Roskill recommended prosecuting the Albion Coal Company, but eventually only fines of £10 and £2 were imposed against manager Phillip Jones and chargeman William Anstes.|$|E
5000|$|In [...] "gas bloat syndrome", fundoplication {{can alter}} the {{mechanical}} ability of the stomach to eliminate swallowed air by belching, leading to an <b>accumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> in the stomach or small intestine.

The offending gas may also come from dietary sources (especially carbonated beverages), or involuntary swallowing of air (aerophagia). If postoperative gas-bloat syndrome does not resolve with time, dietary restrictions, counselling regarding aerophagia, and correction - either by endoscopic balloon dilatation or repeat surgery to revise the Nissen fundoplication to a partial fundoplication - may be necessary.|$|E
30|$|A {{substantial}} {{fraction of}} United States natural gas production {{for the next}} decades is surmised to be supported by unconventional resources, such as shale <b>gas</b> plays. Large <b>accumulations</b> <b>of</b> <b>gas</b> shale tight formations serve as both a hydrocarbon source and a productive reservoir.
