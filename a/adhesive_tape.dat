40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} rebounded phenomenon of SLR camera intemal mirror and c 1 arifies the property of reboundedphenomenon by measuring rebounded angle of mirror models that body part and mirror part bonded. Bonded mirror model supported at experiment equipment is fell freely from horizontal position and collided with the stopper model fixed below 45 degrees of mirror models. Behavior of mirror model is measured by laser displacement sensor and the maximum displacement amount is registered. In the experiment，parameters are stopper position，mirror model materials，kinds of <b>adhesive</b> <b>tapes</b> used when mirror model is bonded and bonded conditions of <b>adhesive</b> <b>tapes.</b> As a result the property of rebounded amounts have relationship with stopper position，kinds of <b>adhesive</b> <b>tapes</b> used when mirror model is bonded and bonded conditions of <b>adhesive</b> <b>tapes.</b> ROMBUNNO. 15...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{discusses}} the impact absorbing capabilities of CFRP aluminium-alloy hybrid beams bonded with double-coated pressure sensitive <b>adhesive</b> <b>tapes.</b> Two sorts of double-coated <b>adhesive</b> <b>tapes</b> (VHB and SBT, 3 M) {{were used in}} experiments. The strength and absorbed energy of thé beams under impact loading were measured using an instrumented Charpy tester. Using the beams having the different <b>adhesive</b> <b>tapes</b> and the CFRP of different length, the variations of the strength and the absorbed energy were investigated. The beams bonded with VHB showed sufficient strength and absorbed energy. SBT showed also great capability of absorbing impact energy. 1...|$|R

40|$|Objectives This {{meta-analysis}} {{investigated the}} efficacies of foot orthoses, motion control footwear and therapeutic <b>adhesive</b> <b>taping</b> in controlling foot pronation {{as compared with}} no-intervention conditions. Data sources Electronic searches on four electronic databases were performed and the reference lists of the screened articles were also scrutinised. Review methods Two reviewers screened the quasirandomised or clinical controlled trials that examined {{the efficacy of the}} selected interventions in controlling calcaneal eversion. Heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed by I 2 index and Egger's regression intercept, respectively. Trial quality was rated by the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale. Results 29 studies were selected. The I 2 indices revealed large heterogeneity which supported the use of a random effect model of meta-analysis. The Egger's regression intercepts suggested that publication bias of the included studies was marginally present in the motion control footwear and the therapeutic <b>adhesive</b> <b>taping</b> groups (p= 0. 06 - 0. 07). All three interventions were effective in reducing calcaneal eversion (p< 0. 001) with therapeutic <b>adhesive</b> <b>taping</b> being most effective whereas Low-dye taping was less effective than the other taping techniques, such as high-dye and stirrups taping. Custom-made foot orthoses were more effective than prefabricated orthoses. Motion control footwear with heel flare or wedge design was less effective than those with dual midsole materials. Conclusions Foot orthoses, motion control footwear and therapeutic <b>adhesive</b> <b>taping</b> were able to control rearfoot eversion with therapeutic <b>adhesive</b> <b>taping</b> being the most effective. In the clinical practice, selection of an antipronation intervention should be based on patient characteristics, type of activity and personal preference. Department of Rehabilitation Science...|$|R

During the gluing process, silicon oil films shrink and direct contacts between the adhesive and the substrate and, therefore, strong bonding become possible.

25|$|Between 5 and 8 March, {{police would}} find six further bodies of young females at 25 Cromwell Street. Each victim had been {{extensively}} mutilated, and each body bore evidence {{of having been}} subjected to extreme sexual abuse prior to the act of murder. For example, the third set of remains discovered in the cellar was found with a length of cloth wrapped around the skull, and an oval of <b>adhesive</b> <b>tape</b> 16 inches in circumference found with the remains had likely been used to gag this victim, whose ankles and wrists were also bound with a large section of rope. Also found in this grave was a large, serrated knife. The second set of remains was found with a section of tubing twisted into a U-shape alongside her severed limbs, and her skull was found encased in <b>adhesive</b> <b>tape</b> which had been wrapped around the section where her face had been 11 or 12 times, with a narrow plastic tube inserted where the nasal cavities had been in an obvious effort to facilitate her breathing prior to her murder.
