There are several different versions of superstring theory which are all subsumed within the M-theory framework.

5|$|For centuries, the Chinese {{had simply}} <b>approximated</b> {{the value of}} pi as 3, until Liu Xin <b>approximated</b> it at 3.154 {{sometime}} between 1–5 CE, although the method he used to reach this value is unknown to historians. Standard measuring vessels dating to the reign of Wang Mang (9–23 CE) also showed approximations for pi at 3.1590, 3.1497, and 3.167. Zhang Heng is the next known Han mathematician to have made an approximation for pi. Han mathematicians understood that the area of a square versus the area of its inscribed circle had an approximate ratio of 4:3, and also understood that the volume of a cube and the volume of its inscribed sphere would be 42:32. With D as diameter and V as volume, D3:V = 16:9 or V=9⁄16D3, a formula Zhang found fault with since he realized the value for diameter was inaccurate, the discrepancy being the value taken for the ratio. To fix this, Zhang added 1⁄16D3 to the formula, thus V = 9⁄16D3 + 1⁄16D3 = 5⁄8D3. Since he found {{the ratio of the}} volume of the cube to the inscribed sphere at 8:5, the ratio of the area of a square to the inscribed circle is √8:√5. With this formula, Zhang was able to approximate pi as the square root of 10, or 3.162. After the Han, Liu Hui <b>approximated</b> pi as 3.14159, while the mathematician Zu Chongzhi (429–500 CE) <b>approximated</b> pi at 3.141592 (or 355⁄113), the most accurate approximation the ancient Chinese would achieve.|$|E
