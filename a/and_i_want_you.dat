500|$|Attendance at Gay Pride marches {{during the}} summer of 1978 in Los Angeles and San Francisco swelled. An {{estimated}} 250,000 to 375,000 attended San Francisco's Gay Freedom Day Parade; newspapers claimed the higher numbers were due to John Briggs. Organizers asked participants to carry signs indicating their hometowns for the cameras, to show how far people came to live in the Castro District. Milk rode in an open car carrying a sign saying [...] "I'm from Woodmere, N.Y." [...] He gave a version of what became his most famous speech, the [...] "Hope Speech", that The San Francisco Examiner said [...] "ignited the crowd":On this anniversary of Stonewall, I ask my gay sisters and brothers to make the commitment to fight. For themselves, for their freedom, for their country... We will not win our rights by staying quietly in our closets... We are coming out to fight the lies, the myths, the distortions. We are coming out to tell the truths about gays, for I am tired of the conspiracy of silence, so I'm going to talk about it. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> to talk about it.

500|$|Pure {{soul was}} popularized by Otis Redding {{and the other}} artists of Stax Records in Memphis, Tennessee. By the late 1960s, Atlantic {{recording}} artist Aretha Franklin had emerged as the most popular female soul star in the country. Also by this time, soul had splintered into several genres, influenced by psychedelic rock and other styles. The social and political ferment of the 1960s inspired artists like Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield to release albums with hard-hitting social commentary, while another variety became more dance-oriented music, evolving into funk. Despite his previous affinity with politically and socially-charged lyrical themes, Gaye helped popularize sexual and romance-themed music and funk, while his 70s recordings, including Let's Get It On (1973) <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You</b> (1976) helped develop the quiet storm sound and format. One {{of the most influential}} albums ever recorded, Sly & the Family Stone's There's a Riot Goin' On (1971) has been considered among the first and best examples of the matured version of funk music, after prototypical instances of the sound in the group's earlier work. Artists such as Gil Scott-Heron and The Last Poets practiced an eclectic blend of poetry, jazz-funk, and soul, featuring critical political and social commentary with afrocentric sentiment. Scott-Heron's proto-rap work, including [...] "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" [...] (1971) and Winter in America (1974), has had a considerable impact on later hip hop artists, while his unique sound with Brian Jackson influenced neo soul artists.|$|E

[...] The make-up was applied by Gilliam's wife, Maggie. During production, Helmond spent ten hours a day with a mask glued to her face; her scenes had to be {{postponed}} due to the blisters this caused.|$|E

2500|$|Wayne Butler was {{originally}} arrested in 1988 for Douty's murder, but was released because of insufficient evidence. Butler's wife divorced him and in October 1997, {{went to a}} police station in Sydney and told officers, [...] "My ex-husband has committed a murder. He killed a girl {{on a beach in}} Queensland. I couldn't say anything while we were married. Now we're divorced <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> to know the truth". Although Butler had long been a suspect, it was not until DNA testing techniques were advanced enough to establish the probability that the semen stain on the towel was his, that he was charged.|$|E
2500|$|In Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States (1935), the Court also voted {{unanimously}} to declare the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) unconstitutional {{on the grounds that}} it gave the president [...] "unfettered discretion" [...] to make whatever laws he thought were needed for economic recovery. Economics author John Steele Gordon writes that the National Recovery Administration (NRA) was [...] "the first iteration of Roosevelt's New Deal ... essentially a government-run cartel to fix prices and divide markets ... This was the most radical shift in the relation between government and the private economy in American history." [...] Speaking to aides of Roosevelt, Justice Louis Brandeis remarked that, [...] "This is the end of this business of centralization, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> to go back and tell the president that we're not going to let this government centralize everything." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was a {{very hard}} {{thing for me to}} do because I liked him but I really felt what he did was awful and that unless I felt myself if I didn’t say something, I’d be a hypocrite. I also felt that if {{somebody}} who was supportive of him didn’t say something, it would not be good. And so it got a lot of attention. I got a call from Erskine Bowles who was Chief of Staff about three or four days later saying {{that he was going to}} express an opinion which wasn’t universally held at the White House– he thought I helped the president by bursting the boil, that was the metaphor he used. The following Sunday morning, I'm at home and the phone rings, it’s the White House. And it’s now about a week and a couple of days since I made the speech. The president says, it was the president, [...] "I just want you to know that there’s nothing you said in that speech that I don’t agree with. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> to know that I’m working on it." [...] And we talked for about forty-five minutes. It was amazing.|$|E

2500|$|The {{shut-down}} of the Army facility {{proved the}} last straw for Truman. [...] On the evening of July 23, Truman ordered the steelmakers and the union {{to meet in the}} White House the following day and settle the strike. At 10:00a.m. on July 24, Murray and Fairless were ushered into the Oval Office. Truman informed the two men of top-secret statistics which showed the U.S. war effort in Korea was being crippled. The President then told Fairless: [...] "You can settle this thing, Ben, and you've got to settle it. I want it settled by tomorrow morning, or I will have some things to say that you won't like to hear, and I will have to do some things you won't like." [...] Fairless started in surprise. Truman then turned to Murray and said, [...] "Phil, you've got to settle this thing too. Now go in there in the Cabinet room, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> to come out with a settlement." [...] The two men adjourned to the Cabinet Room. At 4:45p.m., Fairless and Murray told the President that they had reached an agreement. Steelman witnessed its signing.|$|E
2500|$|When he {{appeared}} before the Foreign Affairs Select Committee on 15 July 2003, Kelly appeared to be under severe stress which was probably increased by the televising of the proceedings. He spoke with a voice so soft that the air-conditioning equipment had to be turned off {{even though it was}} one of the hottest days of the year. His evidence to the committee was that he had not said the things Gilligan had reported his source as saying, and members of the committee came to the conclusion that he had not been the source. Some of the questioning was very precise. The Labour MP Andrew MacKinlay, in particular, used a forceful tone in his cross-examination. For example, when asked to simply list the journalists that he met, Kelly declined to answer and requested that such a list be sought from the MoD, which triggered a response: [...] "...This is the high court of Parliament <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> to tell the Committee who you met... You are under an obligation to reply". [...] The Chairman of the Committee (Donald Anderson) underscored the validity of MacKinlay's question telling Kelly: [...] "It is a proper question... If you have met journalists there is nothing sinister in itself about meeting journalists, save in an unauthorised way." [...] Mackinlay offered his opinion that Kelly had been used by Gilligan telling Kelly: [...] "I reckon you are chaff; you have been thrown up to divert our probing. Have you ever felt like a fall-guy? You have been set up, have you not?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Coffman was {{promptly}} {{called up to}} Detroit and joined the Tigers in Philadelphia, and Cochrane told Coffman that he would pitch {{the first game of}} a series in Boston. [...] In Boston, Coffman recalled that the newspaper headlines reported that [...] "the young upstart from the cotton fields of Alabama would pitch against the incomparable Lefty Grove." [...] On the day of his debut, Cochrane came into the clubhouse and announced that Eldon Auker would start the game. [...] Coffman complained to Cochrane, [...] "But Mickey you told me I would pitch today, and I'm prepared to do just that." [...] Cochrane responded, [...] "I don't care what I told you. [...] Go out there and bring somebody in like Schoolboy Rowe. Grove's pitching today <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> to get off to a better start...you know we never score many runs off him." [...] Coffman replied, [...] "Well let me tell you Mickey they won't score many runs off of me, either." [...] Coffman recalled that this was all Cochrane was waiting for, and he slammed his fist on a table and exclaimed, [...] "OK kid I'll catch you." [...] In his first big league start, Coffman got the win against Grove, as the Tigers beat Boston, 4-2. [...] Coffman and Grove both pitched complete games, and Coffman allowed eight hits in 11 innings; he also had a hit in Detroit's 11th inning rally. [...] The Associated Press account of the game opened as follows: [...] "Youthful George (Slick) Coffman, making his big-league debut with the Detroit Tigers, today pitched his teammates to an 11-lnnlng 4 to 2 victory over the Boston Red Sox." ...|$|E

2500|$|Rating it {{four out}} of five stars, Blender critic Ann Powers stated the album is [...] "Artfully structured, unapologetically explicit, Damita Jo is erotica at its friendliest and most well-balanced. This hour-plus of Tantric flow even erases the memory of Jackson’s clunky Super Bowl breast-baring." [...] Powers added [...] "Her lyrics, though hardly {{avoiding}} familiar sex talk, meld common exhibitionism with convincing intimacies. [...] Jackson brings bliss back to a subject that too many dirty-mouthed hotties have made tedious through overexposure." [...] The album was also considered a [...] "soul-baring, bedroom-eyed record" [...] which was [...] "swimming in pop hooks." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian rated Damita Jo {{four out of}} five stars, saying [...] "Damita Jo's opening salvo is an object lesson in keeping things concise. Four tracks, each barely three minutes long, go hurtling past in a head-spinning blur of snapping rhythms, buzzing synthesized noise and oddly disconnected samples: cut-up vocals and glockenspiel on Strawberry Bounce, rattling tablas on Sexhibition. Elsewhere, there are impossibly lithe basslines - notably on All Nite (Don't Stop) <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>You,</b> an intriguing electronic reconstruction of an early 1970s soul ballad." [...] Petridis heralded the record as [...] "not only inventive, but brilliantly constructed," [...] with nagging hooks and [...] "explosive" [...] choruses. Calling pop a [...] "singles genre," [...] Power's said [...] "Damita Jos strike rate is remarkably high. It's triumphant stuff." [...] Warner Bros. Publications declared the album [...] "flirty, sensual, hot pop" [...] in [...] "traditional Janet style", adding [...] "The slow grooves blend together and the seductive vocals express passion." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice said [...] "Damita Jo starts off bold - But as the album proceeds it gets realer, mostly whispered softcore by the second half even when it's love songs per se. Call me immature, but I figure there's never enough good sex in the world. In a culture inundated with dirty pornos, Damita Jo is good sex." ...|$|E
