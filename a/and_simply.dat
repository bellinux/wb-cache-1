5|$|Catholic worship was {{deliberately}} low key, {{usually in the}} private houses of recusant landholders or in domestic buildings adapted for services. Surviving chapels from this period are generally austere <b>and</b> <b>simply</b> furnished. Typical worship consisted of a sermon, long vernacular prayers and an unsung Low Mass in Latin. Musical accompaniment was prohibited until the nineteenth century, when organs began to be introduced into chapels.|$|E
5|$|Anti-annexation Senator Thomas Hart Benton of Missouri {{had been}} the only Southern Democrat to vote against the Tyler-Texas measure in June 1844. His {{original}} proposal for an annexed Texas had embodied a national compromise, whereby Texas would be divided in two, half slave-soil and half free-soil. As pro-annexation sentiment grew in his home state, Benton retreated from this compromise offer. By February 5, 1845, in the early debates on the Brown-amended House bill, he advanced an alternative resolution that, unlike the Brown scenario, made no reference whatsoever to the ultimate free-slave apportionment of an annexed Texas <b>and</b> <b>simply</b> called for five bipartisan commissioners to resolve border disputes with Texas and Mexico and set conditions for the Lone Star Republic's acquisition by the United States.|$|E

An edition of Songs of Praise was recorded there in September 1994. Old Trafford is also regularly used for private functions, particularly weddings, Christmas parties and business conferences.

5|$|At Chuck and Sarah's {{rehearsal}} dinner, Morgan tells Alex that he {{will stop}} going on missions <b>and</b> <b>simply</b> become an analyst. Chuck's sister Ellie (Sarah Lancaster) is unable {{to make her own}} video montage, having previewed and rejected Lester's deeply disturbed first cut. However, Jeff offers his own flawless cut of the montage, being rewarded with a kiss from Ellie. During the video, Chuck gets a phone call from Vivian, who intends to make him suffer. Vivian activates the Norseman device on a target at the dinner, who Chuck initially fears is his mother. Suddenly, Sarah's nose starts to bleed and she collapses in Chuck's arms as he calls out for help.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the release}} of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince in 2005, Msgr. Fleetwood, then serving with the Council of European Episcopal Conferences, gave an {{interview}} with Vatican Radio. In the interview, Fleetwood reaffirmed his positive opinion of the books, and remarked that then-Cardinal Ratzinger's letters may {{have been written by}} a member of the congregation's staff <b>and</b> <b>simply</b> signed by the prefect. He also stated that his and Amorth's opinions are just that, conflicting personal opinions of priests.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps {{because of}} his {{experience}} in World War I, Kenney {{had a great deal}} of respect for Japanese fighters. He decided to conserve his bombers, and concentrate on attaining air superiority over New Guinea. Kenney switched the bombers to attacking by night unless fighter escorts could be provided. SWPA had a low priority, <b>and</b> <b>simply</b> could not afford to replace losses from costly daylight missions. What he needed was an effective long-range fighter, and Kenney hoped that the Lockheed P-38 Lightning would fit the bill, but the first ones delivered to SWPA were plagued with technical problems. Kenney had Charles Lindbergh teach his P-38 pilots how to extend the range of their aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Plante {{was one of}} {{the first}} goaltenders to skate behind the net to stop the puck. He also {{was one of the}} first to raise his arm on an icing call to let his defencemen know what was happening. He perfected a stand-up, {{positional}} style, cutting down the angles; he became one of the first goaltenders to write a how-to book about the position. He was a pioneer of stickhandling the puck; before that time, goaltenders passively stood in the net <b>and</b> <b>simply</b> deflected pucks to defencemen or backchecking forwards.|$|E
5|$|The North American {{river otter}} was first {{described}} by German naturalist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1777. The mammal {{was identified as}} a species of otter and has a variety of common names, including North American river otter, northern river otter, common otter <b>and,</b> <b>simply,</b> river otter. Other documented common names are American otter, Canada otter, Canadian otter, fish otter, land otter, nearctic river otter, and Prince of Wales otter.|$|E

5|$|The Yale Union Laundry Building, {{also known}} as the Yale Laundry Building, the City Linen Supply Co. Building, Perfect Fit Manufacturing <b>and</b> <b>simply</b> Yale Union (YU), in {{southeast}} Portland, Oregon, is a two-story commercial structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Built largely of brick in 1908, and embellished with Italian Revival and Egyptian Revival decorations, it was added to the register in 2007. Two-story additions in 1927 and 1929 changed the original building into an L-shaped structure that shares a party wall with a commercial building to the east.|$|E
5|$|The meeting {{attracted}} {{a large crowd}} of approximately six hundred participants. The bishop sent a delegation led by his vicar general, Johannes Fabri. Zwingli summarised his position in the Schlussreden (Concluding Statements or the Sixty-seven Articles). Fabri, who had not envisaged an academic disputation in the manner Zwingli had prepared for, was forbidden to discuss high theology before laymen, <b>and</b> <b>simply</b> insisted on the necessity of the ecclesiastical authority. The decision of the council was that Zwingli {{would be allowed to}} continue his preaching and that all other preachers should teach only in accordance with Scripture.|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} Barbarella and Danger: Diabolik {{led to a}} minor trend of film adaptations of comic strips that {{emphasized}} mild sadomasochism and late 1960s fetish gear. Diabolik {{was the first of}} three European comic strip adaptations released in 1968, the other two being Piero Vivarelli's Satanik and Roger Vadim's Barbarella. These films were followed by Bruno Corbucci's Ms. Stiletto and Corrado Farina's Baba Yaga (1973). The look of Diabolik influenced the comic series. The film's audiences could see Diabolik's mouth because Law's mask was made of latex. This resulted in the comic's artists Enzo Facciolo and Sergio Zaniboni giving up on trying to shade in his mouth <b>and</b> <b>simply</b> outlining it.|$|E

5|$|Though {{evolution}} is not progressive, it does sometimes proceed in a linear way, reinforcing characteristics in certain lineages, but such examples are entirely {{consistent with the}} modern neo-Darwinian theory of evolution. These examples have sometimes {{been referred to as}} orthoselection but are not strictly orthogenetic, <b>and</b> <b>simply</b> appear as linear and constant changes because of environmental and molecular constraints on the direction of change. The term orthoselection was first used by Ludwig Hermann Plate, and was incorporated into the modern synthesis by Julian Huxley and Bernard Rensch.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{because of}} strict rules forbidding direct {{conversational}} {{interactions between the}} sexes, the gandingan presented a means for teenagers to interact with one another. Using the gandingan, {{young men and women}} would spend hours teasing, flirting, gossiping, playing guessing games, trading friendly insults <b>and</b> <b>simply</b> conversing with one another. For instance, if friends were telling a boy that a girl liked him but the boy didn’t like her back, the boy wouldn’t resort to telling his friends literally he didn’t like her. Instead, he could use the gandingan to express his reasons and his friends would be able to pick up the message by translating his song.|$|E
5|$|When finally {{faced with}} the loss of speech, the {{characters}} readily express what they feel. Buffy and Riley, after a series of eyebrow movements <b>and</b> <b>simply</b> mouthed questions, are able to kiss spontaneously. Xander's actions are very clearly directed toward protecting Anya and punishing Spike for harming her, and likewise, within a matter of moments Anya's doubts about how Xander feels about her have disappeared and she becomes instantly affectionate towards him again. Tara, who was overcome with shyness while speaking during the Wicca meeting, easily expresses courage when touching Willow, and Willow realizes she has finally found someone who understands and shares what she is seeking.|$|E

5|$|While {{still in}} Madras, Ramanujan {{recorded}} {{the bulk of}} his results in four notebooks of loose-leaf paper. They were mostly written up without any derivations. This is probably the origin of the misapprehension that Ramanujan was unable to prove his results <b>and</b> <b>simply</b> thought up the final result directly. Mathematician Bruce C. Berndt, in his review of these notebooks and Ramanujan's work, says that Ramanujan most certainly was able to prove most of his results, but chose not to.|$|E
5|$|Although the two clubs {{claimed to}} have sold most of the 42,000 tickets {{allocated}} to them, only about 25,000 fans {{were said to have}} travelled to Moscow from the United Kingdom, with about 110 charter flights arriving ahead of the game. According {{to the head of the}} Russian national tourist office, Mikhail Ignatiev, many fans were put off by the cost of travel and accommodation. Additionally, most of Moscow's hotels were full on the night of the game. As some fans looked to offload tickets to the match, The Moscow Times reported that the black-market price dropped from a high of €2,000 (£1,600) to around €500 (£400), while Russian TV channel Sport-1 was reporting prices as low as £300 for tickets belonging to fans who had failed to make the trip to Moscow. Among the celebrities who did not travel were Chelsea supporter and chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) Sebastian Coe, who had to attend meetings ahead of the 2012 Summer Olympics, and Manchester United fan <b>and</b> <b>Simply</b> Red lead singer Mick Hucknall, who was due to perform at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{influence}} of Islam in the region, Tajik was written in the Persian alphabet up to the 1920s. Until this time, the language was not thought of as separate <b>and</b> <b>simply</b> considered a dialect of the Persian language. The Soviets began by simplifying the Persian alphabet in 1923, before moving to a Latin-based system in 1927. The Latin script was introduced by the Soviet Union {{as part of an effort}} to increase literacy and distance the, at that time, largely illiterate population, from the Islamic Central Asia. There were also practical considerations. The regular Persian alphabet, being an abjad, does not provide sufficient letters for representing the vowel system of Tajik. In addition, the abjad is more difficult to learn, each letter having different forms depending on the position in the word.|$|E
