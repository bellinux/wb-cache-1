5|$|Before the Nazko {{earthquake}} swarm began in 2007, the Anahim hotspot {{was not known}} to be an earthquake zone. On October 10 of the following year, <b>a</b> <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> earthquakes occurred. These earthquakes were normally no more than magnitude 1.0 on the Richter magnitude scale, {{but at least one}} earthquake was as strong as magnitude 3.9. Since the appearance of the Nazko swarm, Natural Resources Canada has expressed interest in the adjacent 7,200‑year‑old Nazko Cone.|$|E
5|$|Rorquals use throat pleats {{to expand}} their mouths, which allow them to feed more effectively. However, {{rorquals}} need to build up water pressure in order {{to expand their}} mouths, leading to a lunge-feeding behavior. Lunge-feeding is where a whale rams a bait ball (<b>a</b> <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> small fish) at high speed. Rorquals generally have streamlined physiques to reduce drag in the water while doing this.|$|E

5|$|According to Lafcadio Hearn, a {{butterfly}} {{was seen in}} Japan as the personification of a person's soul; whether they be living, dying, or already dead. One Japanese superstition says that if {{a butterfly}} enters your guest room and perches behind the bamboo screen, the person whom you most love is coming to see you. Large numbers of butterflies are viewed as bad omens. When Taira no Masakado was secretly preparing for his famous revolt, there appeared in Kyoto so vast <b>a</b> <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> butterflies that the people were frightened— thinking the apparition to be a portent of coming evil.|$|E

Lang breaks free and he and Hope dispatch most of the Hydra agents, though one flees with a vial of Cross' particles and Pym is shot. Lang pursues Cross, while the explosives detonate, imploding the building as Pym and van Dyne escape.|$|E

After reviewing the images, the verdict is pronounced by a qualified inspector.|$|E

We consider {{the possibility of a}} partially disabled robot, we analyze the effect it would have on <b>a</b> het-erogeneous <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> robots, and we discuss how to work around the disability. We examine the effectivness of this control algorithm through a simulation study. For this pur-pose, a biologically inspired strategy is used for the move-ment of the robots...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 1380s, the {{governor}} of Gaza, Akbuga Safawi, plotted to commit treason against Sultan az-Zahir Barquq. The plot was detected and Safawi was exiled to al-Karak, and replaced by Husam al-Din ibn Bakish. Soon after, the city fell {{into the hands of}} Emir Yalbugha an-Nasiri who revolted against Barquq. Gaza was retaken without violence, and Ibn Bakish met Yalbugha at its gates with gifts and proposals of peace. The unseated Barquq regained his throne in 1389, and retook Gaza the next year. In 1401 <b>a</b> <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> locusts destroyed Gaza's crops. A battle between the rival Mamluk emirs Akbirdi and Qansuwa Khamsiyah occurred in Gaza; Khamsiyah had failed in usurping the Mamluk throne and fled to Gaza where he made his unsuccessful last stand. Between 1428 and 1433, Gaza was governed by Emir Sayf ad-Din Inal, who would later become sultan in 1453. During his sultanate, in 1455, Inal's dawadar (executive secretary) had the Madrasa of Birdibak built in the Shuja'iyya neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|On July 3, {{international}} leaders begin ordering individual counterattacks. Their aviation forces {{attack the}} saucers positioned above {{the ruins of}} the cities, but the saucers are protected by force fields. Each saucer launches <b>a</b> <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> attack fighters, each with its own shield as well, which wipe out the human fighter squadrons. Captain Steven Hiller, a pilot with the USMC squadron VMFA-314 based out of Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, survives by luring his attacker to the enclosed spaces of the Grand Canyon and sacrificing his plane, forcing the alien to crash-land. He subdues the injured alien pilot and flags down a convoy of refugees, hitching a ride with former combat pilot Russell Casse. They transport the unconscious alien to Area 51, where Thomas' group has landed. Through Secretary of Defense Albert Nimzicki, they learn that a faction of the government has been involved in a UFO conspiracy since 1947, when one of the invaders' attack fighters crashed in Roswell. Area 51 houses the refurbished alien fighter, and three alien corpses recovered from the crash.|$|E

Pericles tries to help Leo, but Thade throws him hard against a wall. Thade takes Leo's gun from him and tries to fire the weapon at Leo. Leo sees that Thade is within the pilot's deck and closes the automatic door, trapping Thade inside. Thade fires the weapon repeatedly at the door but the ricochets create sparks that cause Thade to huddle afraid under a control panel. Leo decides to escape the Planet of the Apes and return to Earth. He gives Pericles to Ari, who promises to look after him. He says goodbye and kisses Ari and Daena. Leo climbs aboard Pericles's undamaged pod and travels back in time through the same electromagnetic storm. Leo crashes in Washington, D.C. on Earth. He looks up at {{what appears to be the}} Lincoln Memorial, only to find that it is now a monument to General Thade. <b>A</b> <b>swarm</b> <b>of</b> police officers, firefighters, and news reporters descend on Leo, all of whom are apes.|$|E
