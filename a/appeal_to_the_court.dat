5|$|A. Belarusian athletes Vadim Devyatovskiy and Ivan Tsikhan, who won {{silver and}} bronze {{respectively}} in the men's hammer throw, both {{tested positive for}} abnormal levels of testosterone. After attending a disciplinary hearing in September, they were stripped of their medals on December 11, 2008. Krisztián Pars of Hungary was given the silver medal, and Koji Murofushi of Japan was given the bronze. On June 10, 2010, following a successful <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Arbitration for Sport, Devyatovskiy and Tsikhan had their medals reinstated.|$|E
5|$|In late December, Barcelona's <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Arbitration for Sport was {{unsuccessful}} and {{the original}} transfer ban was reinstated, leaving the club unable to utilise the 2015 winter and summer transfer windows. On 5 January 2015, Zubizareta was sacked by the board after four years as director of football. The next month, Barcelona announced {{the formation of a}} new Football Area Technical Commission, made up of vice-president Jordi Mestre, board member Javier Bordas, Carles Rexach and Ariedo Braida.|$|E
5|$|On <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeal, {{three issues}} were raised. The first issue {{was whether the}} plaintiffs (appellants) had the {{requisite}} locus standi.

The third issue is the most significant, namely, whether the acquisition of the temple property violated Article 12(1) of the Constitution.|$|E

5|$|While the Giro had in its peloton many notable riders, {{including}} six former Grand Tour winners, the odds-on favorite was always 's Alberto Contador. The 2008 Giro champion, who had likewise won the 2008 Vuelta a España and three {{editions of the}} Tour de France, announced in April 2010 that he would contest the Giro in 2011. Though his status was put in doubt after a positive test for clenbuterol at the 2010 Tour de France, he was cleared by his national federation in February 2011 and {{able to return to}} racing, though the case still pended a final <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Arbitration for Sport later in 2011. Contador was the overwhelming favorite for overall victory. Reigning Giro champion Ivan Basso chose not to return, preferring to focus on the Tour de France later in the season. He briefly considered riding as a domestique for Vincenzo Nibali, but opted against it because of his physical condition at the time and the feeling that doing so would be disrespectful to the race. The 2011 Giro was thus the third successive edition, and fourth in the last five, in which the reigning champion did not return to defend his championship.|$|E
5|$|No South Sudanese athletes met the Olympic {{qualifying}} standards, but {{the nation}} was allotted three universality places to compete {{in track and field}} events. The South Sudan Athletics Federation nominated Marial, Santino Kenyi, and Mangar Makur Chuot to fill these spots. Eight days {{prior to the start of}} the Games, however, the South Sudan National Olympic Committee informed Chuot, who had already been accredited, by email that he had been removed from the team. Chuot was a refugee who had fled the Second Sudanese Civil War after the death of his father and been resettled in Australia in 2008. In 2014 he became the Australian 200 metre champion, but elected to compete for South Sudan rather than Australia at the Games. After his selection for the South Sudanese delegation was confirmed in December 2015, he returned to the country of his birth and became the 2016 South Sudanese 100 and 200 m champion, setting a national record in the latter discipline. The NOC chose Margret Hassan, a competitor in the 200 m event, to take his spot, despite another athlete, national record holder Viola Lado, having posted a better time in the lead up to the Olympics. When the Athletics Federation protested, the NOC claimed that Samsung, who had featured Hassan in one of their advertisements, had pressured the organization to give her one of the spots, an accusation that Samsung denied. When his <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Arbitration for Sport was rejected, Chuot proclaimed his decision to leave the sport.|$|E
25|$|In mid-October, the Army Court of Criminal Appeals upheld Colonel Gross' {{decision}} that Hasan could be forcibly shaved.

25|$|The 2006 Tour {{had been}} plagued by the Operación Puerto doping case before it began. Favourites such as Jan Ullrich and Ivan Basso were banned by their teams a day before the start. Seventeen riders were implicated.

25|$|On 28 June 2007 the SCCRC {{concluded}} its four-year review and, having uncovered {{evidence that}} a miscarriage of justice could have occurred, the commission granted Megrahi leave to appeal against his Lockerbie bombing conviction for a second time. The second <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Criminal Appeal was abandoned in August 2009, as an impediment to the legal power to release him to Libya under the Prisoner Transfer Scheme then operating in the United Kingdom. Ultimately, he was not released under this scheme, rather, on compassionate grounds due to his ill health. There was in the event, no requirement to drop his appeal against conviction.|$|E
25|$|Between 2002 and 2004 about 1000 {{memorials}} and headstones {{were laid}} flat after Leicester City Council 'topple-tested' them for stability. Initially unaware {{that they needed}} to obtain a faculty to authorise this in the consecrated ground, the council applied for a faculty retrospectively, although they were opposed in this by relatives of 119 Polish descendants whose relatives' memorials had been laid flat. At first the Consistory Court rejected the Council's application, but this was subsequently granted on <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Arches in 2006. However, in granting the faculty the Court required the Council to work with the Friends of Welford Road Cemetery and members of the local Polish community to restore those flattened memorials.|$|E

25|$|At {{the midday}} service on 1 March 1922, J.A. Kensit, {{leader of the}} Protestant Truth Society, got up and protested against the form of worship. The {{proposed}} changes to the church in 1924 led to a hearing in the Consistory Court of the Chancellor of the Diocese of London and an <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Arches. Judgement was given by the latter Court in October 1924. The advowson was purchased in 1931, without {{the knowledge of the}} Rector and Parochial Church Council, by the evangelical Sir Charles King-Harman. A number of such cases, including the purchase of the advowsons of Clapham and Hampstead Parish Churches by Sir Charles, led to the passage of the Benefices (Purchase of Rights of Patronage) Measure 1933. This allowed the parishioners of St Magnus to purchase the advowson from Sir Charles King-Harman for £1,300 in 1934 and transfer it to the Patronage Board.|$|E

Ethan's physician Dr. Nayak (Suhel Seth) with whom he has consistently persuaded to retract his case, he finally relents to Ethan's appeal when he realizes that the friend in him is much stronger than the medic.

25|$|Far {{and away}} the most common mode by which a case reaches the Supreme Court is through an appeal from a {{decision}} rendered by a lower court. Appealed cases generally originate from lawsuits or criminal indictments filed and tried before the trial courts. These decisions of the trial courts may then be elevated on <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Appeals, or more rarely, directly to the Supreme Court if only “questions of law” are involved. Apart from decisions of the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court may also directly review on appeal decisions rendered by the Sandiganbayan and the Court of Tax Appeals. Decisions rendered by administrative agencies are not directly appealable to the Supreme Court, they must be first challenged before the Court of Appeals. However, decisions of the Commission on Elections may be elevated directly for review to the Supreme Court, although the procedure is not, strictly speaking, {{in the nature of}} an appeal.|$|E

25|$|The 1852 Drainage and Improvement Act {{gave the}} Commissioners wide powers {{to manage the}} river, but created an {{administrative}} structure that was too complex to be workable. With the river in a poor state, James Rendel was appointed as engineer, and began dredging the channel and raising the banks, which cost £124,000. Another Act of Parliament was obtained in 1854, to allow the Commissioners to borrow £325,000 {{to pay for the}} work. A new iron swing bridge was built in Wisbech, to replace a narrow stone bridge which restricted the flow of the river, and although it was tested on installation, it was not operated subsequently. Dams across the river were built at Waldersea and Guyhirn, and an underwater weir was constructed below the bridge at Wisbech. Wisbech Corporation took the Commissioners to court in 1859 for obstructing the river, and when an initial judgement was made in their favour, gangs of men destroyed most of the Waldersea dam overnight. An <b>appeal</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> of Chancery by the Commissioners also failed, and the dams were removed, as was the Wisbech weir, after an accident involving a train of lighters.|$|E
