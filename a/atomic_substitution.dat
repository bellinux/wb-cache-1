The doping dependence of T (c) {{can be associated with}} the gradual filling of the sigma- and the pi-bands and the modifications in the Fermi surface. The data show that C doping for B induces a much faster reduction in T (c) than Al for Mg, while the simple Li substitution has a minor effect. On the other hand, the double Li-C substitution reduces T (c) faster than the simple C doping, which {{can be attributed to the}} different role of hole and electron doping for the pi- and sigma-bands. Finally, Mn ions have a drastic effect on superconductivity apparently acting as magnetic pair breaking centers. In the Raman spectra of the mixed compounds, two modes of E- 2 g symmetry appear at similar to 600 cm(- 1) and similar to 850 cm(- 1) (defined as the soft and hard modes, respectively), which do not evolve one to the other with doping, but they coexist in a typical two-mode behavior for both Mg(B 1 -x C (x)) (2) and Mg 1 -x Al (x) B- 2 sets of compounds. MgB 2 appears to be metastable with intrinsic structural and electronic phase competition, close to topological electronic transitions of the Fermi surface that can be tuned by doping or internal strain from the <b>atomic</b> <b>substitutions.</b> The analysis of the phonon frequency dependence on doping indicates that the behavior of the renormalized mode cannot explain the reduction of T (c) in the phase coexistence level.

The permanent dipole associated with the molecular cations in organometal-halide perovskites (OMHPs) may lead to spontaneous polarization and thus piezoelectricity. Here, we explore the piezoelectric properties of OMHPs with density functional theory.

By comparing OMHPs with different <b>atomic</b> <b>substitutions</b> in the $ABX_ 3 $ architecture, we find that the displacement of the $B$-site cation contributes to nearly all the piezoelectric response, and that the competition between $A$-$X$ hydrogen bond and $B$-$X$ metal-halide bond in OMHPs controls the piezoelectric properties.

40|$|In {{materials}} with strong local Coulomb interactions, simple defects such as <b>atomic</b> <b>substitutions</b> strongly affect both macroscopic and local {{properties of the}} system. A nonmagnetic impurity, for instance, is seen to induce magnetism nearby. Even without disorder, models of such correlated systems are generally not soluble in 2 or 3 dimensions, and so few exact results are known for the properties of such impurities. Nevertheless, some simple physical ideas have emerged from experiments and approximate theories. Here, we first review what we can learn about this problem from 1 D antiferromagnetically correlated systems. We then discuss experiments on the high Tc cuprate normal state which probe the effect of impurities on local charge and spin degrees of freedom, and compare with theories of single impurities in correlated hosts, as well as phenomenological effective Kondo descriptions. Subsequently, we review theories of impurities in d-wave superconductors including residual quasiparticle interactions, and compare with experiments in the superconducting state. We argue that existing data exhibit a remarkable similarity to impurity-induced magnetism in the 1 D case, implying the importance of electronic correlations for the understanding of these phenomena, and suggesting that impurities may provide excellent probes of the still poorly understood ground state of the cuprates.

Analysis of the first-order computer models of the RI VSV- 8 analogs in complex with the H- 2 Kb molecule suggested that the stability of the MHC-peptide complex is derived from an extensive network of hydrogen bonds formed between the peptide backbone atoms and the MHC side chain atoms. ^ Furthermore, P 3 and/or P 5 side chain analogs of the VSV- 8 peptide were also made to explore the role of buried peptide side chains in the conformation of the MHC class I molecular surface recognized by the TCR.
