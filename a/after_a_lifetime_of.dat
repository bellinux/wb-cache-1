Will comes to understand, then, that his father—and the rest of us—are our stories and that the deeper reality of our lives may, in fact, not be our truest self.|$|E

Whenever his aunt is absent, Digory finds solace with the animals and trees, including a talking squirrel named Pattertwig. Polly enters the story as a girl next door who is unable to understand the speech of non-human creatures. She wants to build a raft to explore a stream which leads to an underground world. Digory helps construct the raft, but ends up sawing a branch from a talking tree necessary to complete it, in order not to lose face with Polly. This causes him to lose his supernatural powers of speech. The following day he is visited by his godmother MrsLefay who knows that Digory has lost his abilities and gives him a card with the address of a furniture shop which she instructs him to visit.

In the latter, the elderly Lady Slane courageously embraces a long {{suppressed}} sense of freedom and whimsy <b>after</b> <b>a</b> <b>lifetime</b> <b>of</b> convention. This novel was dramatised by the BBC in 1986 starring Dame Wendy Hiller. All Passion Spent appears to reflect Woolf's influence, as Lady Slane, who has only existed while married to her late husband, a former prime minister, finally begins to live after his death, and becomes friends with the servants on her estate, discovering that {{the lives of people}} she had ignored until then are also interesting. At the end of the novel, Lady Slane persuades her granddaughter to break off an arranged marriage to pursue her career as a musician. Sackville-West took up writing again in 1930 after a six-year break {{for a variety of reasons}} as she needed money to pay for the Sissinghurst Castle which had just been purchased; Nicolson having left the Foreign Office no longer had a diplomat's salary to draw upon; she had to pay tuition for her two sons to attend Eton, one of the most expensive public schools in England; and it because she felt she had become a better writer thanks to the mentorship of Woolf who had taught her how to write better.|$|E

40|$|The flow of {{superfluid}} ^ 4 He {{around a}} translationally oscillating sphere, levitating without mechanical support, {{can either be}} laminar or turbulent, depending on the velocity amplitude. Below a critical velocity v_c that scales as ω ^ 1 / 2, and is temperature independent below 1 K, the flow is laminar (potential flow). Below 0. 5 K the linear drag force is caused by ballistic phonon scattering that vanishes as T^ 4 until background damping, measured in the empty cell, becomes dominant for T < 0. 1 K. Increasing the velocity amplitude above v_c leads to a transition from potential flow to turbulence, where the large turbulent drag force varies as (v^ 2 - v_c^ 2). In a small velocity interval Δ v / v_c < 3 % above v_c, the flow is unstable below 0. 5 K, switching intermittently between both patterns. From time series recorded at constant temperature and driving force, the <b>lifetimes</b> <b>of</b> both phases are analyzed statistically. We observe metastable states of potential flow which, <b>after</b> <b>a</b> mean <b>lifetime</b> <b>of</b> 25 minutes, ultimately break down due to vorticity created by natural background radioactivity. The <b>lifetimes</b> <b>of</b> the turbulent phases have an exponential distribution, and the mean increases exponentially with Δ v^ 2. We investigate the frequency at which the vortex rings are shed from the sphere. Our results are compared with recent data of other authors on vortex shedding by moving a laser beam through a Bose-Einstein condensate.

5000|$|In {{contexts}} {{where their}} differences are visible, {{persons with disabilities}} often face stigma. People frequently react to disabled presence with fear, pity, patronization, intrusive gazes, revulsion, or disregard. These reactions can, and often do, exclude persons with disabilities from accessing social spaces along with the benefits and resources these spaces provide. Disabled writer/researcher Jenny Morris describes how stigma functions to marginalize persons with disabilities: “Going out in public so often takes courage. How many of us find that we can't dredge up the strength to do it day after day, week after week, year <b>after</b> year, <b>a</b> <b>lifetime</b> <b>of</b> rejection and revulsion? It is not only physical limitations that restrict us to our homes and those whom we know. It is the knowledge that each entry into the public world will be dominated by stares, by condescension, by pity and by hostility.” Additionally, facing stigma can cause harm to psycho-emotional well-being of the person being stigmatized. One {{of the ways in}} which the psycho-emotional health of persons with disabilities is adversely affected is through the internalization of the oppression they experience, which can lead to feeling that they are weak, crazy, worthless, or any number of other negative attributes that may be associated with their conditions. Internalization of oppression damages the self-esteem of the person affected and shapes their behaviors in ways that are compliant with nondisabled dominance. Ableist ideas are frequently internalized when disabled people are pressured by the people and institutions around them to hide and downplay their disabled difference, or, [...] "pass". According to writer Simi Linton, the act of passing takes a deep emotional toll by causing disabled individuals to experience loss of community, anxiety and self-doubt. The media play a significant role in creating and reinforcing stigma associated with disability. Media portrayals of disability usually cast disabled presence as necessarily marginal within society at large. These portrayals simultaneously reflect and influence popular perception of disabled difference.|$|R

Yet in that twilight where he dwelt he loomed large upon the imagination; the minds that could not conceive him were still aware of his greatness. I myself had not read much of him, but I knew the essays he was printing in the Atlantic, and I knew certain of his poems, though by no means many; yet I had this sense of him, that he was somehow, beyond and above my ken, a presence of force and beauty and wisdom, uncompanioned in our literature. He had lately stooped from his ethereal heights {{to take part in the}} battle of humanity, and I suppose that if the truth were told he was more to my young fervor because he had said that John Brown had made the gallows glorious like the cross, than because he had uttered all those truer and wiser things which will still a hundred years hence be leading the thought of the world.|$|R
