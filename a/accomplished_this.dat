5|$|On August 3, 1962, he was {{the first}} batter ever to hit a {{baseball}} over the left field roof at Tiger Stadium, a seldom-reached target as contrasted with the old ballpark's smaller right field area. Only three others <b>accomplished</b> <b>this</b> feat during the next 37 seasons before the stadium was closed.|$|E
5|$|Cuba {{has been}} the most {{successful}} team, winning the most gold and silver medals and never finishing outside the podium. Cuban pitcher Pedro Luis Lazo is the most successful individual athlete, winning four medals—two gold and two silver—from 1996 to 2008. Nine other Cuban players won three medals; no player from any other nation <b>accomplished</b> <b>this</b> feat. From the 25 athletes who won two medals in baseball, 18 were Cuban, while the remaining seven included 4 South Korean and 3 Japanese players.|$|E
5|$|Humber {{became the}} seventh {{former member of}} the Mets to go on to throw a no-hitter for another team. The other six are Nolan Ryan, Tom Seaver, Mike Scott, Dwight Gooden, Hideo Nomo and David Cone. The New York Mets, at the time of Humber's perfect game, had never had a no-hitter thrown by a player in the 50-year history of the {{franchise}} (Johan Santana has since <b>accomplished</b> <b>this</b> feat).|$|E

5|$|With his {{performance}} against Indiana, Robinson {{became the first}} player in Division I FBS history to have two regular season games with 200 yards rushing and 200 yards passing. Seven others have accomplished the feat (including Pat White, Vince Young and Antwaan Randle El), but none have done so {{more than once in}} the regular season. Vince Young <b>accomplished</b> <b>this</b> feat once in the regular season and once in the Rose Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Denard Robinson had {{perhaps his}} worst game {{up to this}} point in the season: he threw three interceptions and was held to only 84 yards rushing. This marked the first time that Michigan State had {{defeated}} Michigan {{three years in a row}} since they <b>accomplished</b> <b>this</b> feat from 1965–1967. The announced crowd of 113,065 was, at the time, the second largest crowd ever at Michigan Stadium. As a testament to Michigan's ongoing kicking woes, the field goal in the first half was Michigan's first attempt since the game against UMass and the first converted kick since the game against Connecticut.|$|E

Of the six teams in the Six Nations and four in the Rugby Championship teams, only Italy have failed to score a hat-trick at the World Cup. Fiji, Namibia and Samoa are the only other teams to score a hat-trick, which were scored by Vereniki Goneva, Kotze and Alesana Tuilagi, respectively.

5|$|Prince Norodom Sihanouk {{had ruled}} Cambodia adeptly {{since he had}} wrested {{independence}} from the French on 9 November 1953. He had <b>accomplished</b> <b>this</b> task by deft political maneuvering between {{both the left and}} the right to achieve what no other ruler or political group in Indochina had managed, a relatively bloodless transition to independence. During the next ten years, while the conflicts in neighboring Laos and South Vietnam heated up, Sihanouk managed to sustain his delicate domestic political balance while at the same time maintaining his nation's neutrality (guaranteed by the 1954 Geneva Conference that ended the First Indochina War).|$|E

Despite losing a key runner to injury, a disqualification in the 4x100m, and adversity during the meet, the Oregon women's team was able to edge out the Georgia Bulldogs's strong field events team in the final 4x400m event. Since the women's team won the cross country championship and the indoor championship in the same academic year, the outdoor title gave the women's team a triple crown, the first time any NCAA women's track and field team has <b>accomplished</b> <b>this</b> feat.|$|E

5|$|Various {{conflicting}} accounts {{exist that}} describe saffron's first arrival in South and East Asia. The {{first of these}} rely on historical accounts gleaned from Persian records. These suggest to many experts that saffron, among other spices, was first spread to India via Persian rulers' efforts to stock their newly built gardens and parks. They <b>accomplished</b> <b>this</b> by transplanting the desired cultivars across the Persian empire. Phoenicians then began in the 6th century BC to market the new Kashmiri saffron by utilising their extensive trade routes. Once sold, Kashmiri saffron {{was used in the}} treatment of melancholy and as a fabric dye.|$|E
5|$|An immaculate inning {{occurs in}} {{baseball}} when a pitcher in a half-inning of play throws only nine pitches, {{each of which}} is a strike and thus strikes out three consecutive batters. Immaculate innings are uncommon, rarer than the better known individual gameplay feats of a batter's hitting for the cycle and a pitcher's no hitter. Currently 84 different Major League Baseball (MLB) pitchers have <b>accomplished</b> <b>this</b> feat for a total of 89 immaculate innings. The first one was pitched by John Clarkson of the Boston Beaneaters on June 4, 1889, in the third inning against the Philadelphia Quakers. Since then, only four players––Lefty Grove, Nolan Ryan, Randy Johnson, and Sandy Koufax––have thrown an immaculate inning more than once in their careers. Koufax is the only pitcher to throw three of them. A record eight immaculate innings have been thrown in the 2017 MLB season through August 8.|$|E

They <b>accomplished</b> <b>this</b> feat by triumphing 1–0 in the first leg at Tallaght Stadium and drawing 0–0 in the second leg in Estonia to advance 1–0 on aggregate. Rovers were then beaten 3–0 on aggregate in the next round by Danish Champions Copenhagen but advanced to the 2011–12 Europa League Play-off round. There they were drawn against Serbian Champions FK Partizan, whom they defeated 3–2 on aggregate (2–1 on the night after extra time) to reach the group stages of the Europa League. This marked a famous victory for Irish football, as {{it is the first time}} an Irish club has reached the group stages of a major European competition. Rovers also won the All Ireland Setanta Sports Cup in 2011 by defeating Dundalk in the final at Tallaght Stadium.Rovers wrapped up a second league title in a row with a last-minute victory over UCD at Belfield on 25 October 2011.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus debuted {{at number}} one on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 326,000 copies. In doing so, it surpassed the first-week sales of the {{original}} Hannah Montana soundtrack, which opened with 281,000 units the previous year. The record was later certified triple-platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for exceeding shipments of three million copies. Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus opened at number three on the Canadian Albums Chart, and was recognized with a platinum certification in the country. In March 2008, Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus reached number six the same week that Best of Both Worlds Concert reached number 10 in its second week of availability. In doing so, Cyrus became the first person to two records in the top-ten of the Billboard 200 since Ray Charles <b>accomplished</b> <b>this</b> in 2004. It also charted at number 18 on the Top 100 Mexico, where it was later certified gold.|$|E
5|$|Ny-Ålesund was {{established}} as a mining company town by Kings Bay in 1916. Between 1925 and 1928, four {{attempts were made to}} reach the North Pole by air from Ny-Ålesund. In May 1925, Roald Amundsen used Ny-Ålesund as a base for two flying boats, but the expedition failed to come closer than 88 degrees north. On 9 May 1926, Floyd Bennett and Richard E. Byrd used Ny-Ålesund as both the starting and landing for their expedition. Although they claimed to have reached the pole, there is strong evidence that they could not have <b>accomplished</b> <b>this.</b> On 11 May, Amundsen and Umberto Nobile's airship Norge left Ny-Ålesund and traveled via the North Pole to Alaska. This is regarded as the first successful expedition to the North Pole. After two short skirmishes, Nobile's airship Italia left Ny-Ålesund on 23 May 1928 to reach the North Pole, but crashed on the return.|$|E
5|$|The new peace {{would only}} last for two years; war recommenced in the {{aftermath}} of John's decision in August 1200 to marry Isabella of Angoulême. In order to remarry, John first needed to abandon Isabel, Countess of Gloucester, his first wife; John <b>accomplished</b> <b>this</b> by arguing that he had failed to get the necessary papal permission to marry Isabel in the first place – as a cousin, John could not have legally wed her without this. It remains unclear why John chose to marry Isabella of Angoulême. Contemporary chroniclers argued that John had fallen deeply in love with Isabella, and John may have been motivated by desire for an apparently beautiful, if rather young, girl. On the other hand, the Angoumois lands that came with Isabella were strategically vital to John: by marrying Isabella, John was acquiring a key land route between Poitou and Gascony, which significantly strengthened his grip on Aquitaine.|$|E

5|$|Alexandre Villaplane captained France in {{its first}} FIFA World Cup match in 1930 {{and went on to}} captain the team in the entire tournament. Maurice Cottenet was the first goalkeeper to captain the {{national}} team. Alex Thépot was the second and bore the armband at the 1934 FIFA World Cup. The team's first captain after World War II was Alfred Aston. Aston captained the team for the first time {{in its first}} match following the conclusion of the war, a 3–1 win over Belgium on Christmas Eve 1944, and subsequently led the team out six more times. Following Aston, the captaincy was rotated among striker Jean Baratte and defenders Roger Marche and Robert Jonquet. Marche and Jonquet alternated the armband at the 1954 and 1958 editions of the FIFA World Cup. Following the retirement of Baratte, Marche took primary control of the captaincy and guided the team until his international retirement in 1960. The former Stade de Reims defender held the record of captaining France the most until he was surpassed by Michel Platini in 1986. Platini is the first France captain to lead the team to victory in a major international competition. He <b>accomplished</b> <b>this</b> feat at UEFA Euro 1984. In 2000, Platini was surpassed by Didier Deschamps, who captained France to its first FIFA World Cup title in 1998. Deschamps surpassed Platini during UEFA Euro 2000 in the team's semi-final match against Portugal. France won the match, 2–1. In the final, France defeated Italy, giving Deschamps his second major honour as captain. Deschamps was succeeded by Marcel Desailly, who ranks second in captaining France the most. Desailly captained France to victory at both the 2001 and 2003 editions of the FIFA Confederations Cup.|$|E
