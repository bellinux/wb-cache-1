40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} in face digital image searching <b>and</b> <b>matching.</b> The given key image is converted into gray scale image and after that a matrix is computed with gray scale values of the key image. Then we are collecting the diagonal key elements for diagonal searching key sequence. Using Pair wise sequence alignment {{we are trying to}} match the key with available images in the large data base of collection of faces. Initially we discussed various techniques used in digital image searching <b>and</b> <b>matching</b> in this paper. This new algorithm Diagonal matrix is a new algorithm for all face images searching <b>and</b> <b>matching.</b> Face recognition is very essential in the field of criminology. Face Image searching <b>and</b> <b>matching</b> are very difficult task in image processing; there are several algorithms for face image matching. But still needs more optimization for image matching. Using this new approach we can match criminal photo from a large database. Face Image recognition, feature extraction <b>and</b> pattern <b>matching</b> needs improvements in Image processing. There are several methods for Face image searching <b>and</b> <b>matching,</b> but we need new optimized technique for image searching <b>and</b> <b>matching.</b> This new Diagonal matrix approach is tried to give optimized solution in Face digital image matching.

5|$|Along {{with the}} general {{administration}} of the sport, football associations and competition organisers also enforce good conduct in wider aspects of the game, dealing with issues such as comments to the press, clubs' financial management, doping, age fraud <b>and</b> <b>match</b> fixing. Most competitions enforce mandatory suspensions for players who are sent off in a game. Some on-field incidents, if considered very serious (such as allegations of racial abuse), may result in competitions deciding to impose heavier sanctions than those normally associated with a red card. Some associations allow for appeals against player suspensions incurred on-field if clubs feel a referee was incorrect or unduly harsh.|$|E
5|$|In 1961, Fischer {{started a}} 16-game match with Reshevsky, split between New York and Los Angeles. Reshevsky, 32 years Fischer's senior, was {{considered}} the favorite, since he had far more match experience and had never lost a set match. After 11 games and a tie score (two wins apiece with seven draws), the match ended prematurely due to a scheduling dispute between Fischer <b>and</b> <b>match</b> organizer and sponsor Jacqueline Piatigorsky.

5|$|British Open Championship Golf is a {{three-dimensional}} (3D) video game that simulates golf, a sport in which players attempt {{to hit a}} ball into a hole with as few strokes as possible. In particular, the game is based on The Open Championship, the oldest tournament in golf. The player may compete as a pre- or self-created amateur golfer or as one of eight celebrity athletes, including Sandy Lyle, Vijay Singh and Ian Baker-Finch. Three modes of play—Practice, Match and Tournament—are available. Practice <b>and</b> <b>Match</b> are non-binding preparatory modes: the former allows the player to practice each hole of a course, and the latter engages the player in a pre-tournament match of stroke play, match play or fourball. In the Tournament mode, the player competes in The Open Championship, which consists of four 18-hole matches.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{started the}} Test series against South Africa poorly. Suffering from a throat infection, he scored three in both innings and took 1/46 in an Australian victory. In the Second Test at the MCG, Miller {{performed}} consistently with bat and ball, taking 4/62 and 3/51 and scoring 52 and 31. In {{the course of}} the match, he passed the all-round double of 1000Test runs and 100Test wickets when he dismissed John Waite in the second innings, but this was not enough to prevent defeat. In the Third Test, Miller scored 55, putting on 168 with Harvey, and took 3/48 and 2/33 in an innings victory. Australia's fortunes took {{a turn for the worse}} in the Fourth Test in Adelaide. Miller scored nine and injured his back after two overs with the ball. Lindwall also broke down. Without their spearheads, Australia were unable to bowl out the South Africans <b>and</b> <b>match</b> was drawn. Both were ruled out of the Fifth Test and the South Africans levelled the series despite conceding 520 runs during the first innings. Australia's bowlers were unable to stop the South African batsmen without their new ball pair.|$|E
5|$|Shots {{where the}} {{spacecraft}} had parts in motion or the perspective changed were shot by directly filming the model. For most shots {{the model was}} stationary and camera was driven along a track on a special mount, the motor of which was mechanically linked to the camera motor—making it possible to repeat camera moves <b>and</b> <b>match</b> speeds exactly. Elements of the scene were recorded on same piece of film in separate passes to combine the lit model, stars, planets, or other spacecraft in the same shot. In moving shots of the long Discovery One spacecraft, {{in order to keep}} the entire model in focus, multiple passes had to be made with the lighting on it blocked out section by section. In each pass the camera would be focused on the one lit section. Many matting techniques were tried to block out the stars behind the models, with film makers sometimes resorting to hand tracing frame by frame around the image of the spacecraft (rotoscoping) to create the matte.|$|E

40|$|Electromagnetic {{simulation}} {{using the}} transmission-line modelling method {{in conjunction with}} electric circuit analysis is applied to extract the tuning <b>and</b> <b>matching</b> requirements of RF coils for magnetic resonance imaging. Free-ringing microimaging RF coils were modelled in the unloaded and Krebs-Henseleit physiological buffer solution loaded condition. The simulations determined the frequency response and equivalent lumped-element circuit components of resistance, inductance, (fixed) capacitance, and coupling coefficient. Equivalent lumped-element electric circuit representations were derived for RF coils, and circuit analysis was applied to determine the tuning <b>and</b> <b>matching</b> requirements for the desired resonance frequency and characteristic impedance, respectively. Both capacitive <b>and</b> inductive <b>matching</b> schemes were considered. Experimental comparisons were performed with an agreement of less than 3 pF for the (variable) tuning <b>and</b> <b>matching</b> capacitances used in the tuning <b>and</b> <b>matching</b> networks, thus enabling component selection and validation of the methods. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

5|$|The 2011 season had a minor hiccup at {{the very}} {{beginning}} with a two-point loss to the Blues. Their second round match against the Hurricanes was cancelled, <b>and</b> <b>match</b> declared a draw after the Christchurch earthquake on 22 February which caused 182 deaths. In their first match after the earthquake they played the Waratahs, a team that had only conceded six points in their previous two games. The Crusaders triumphed 33–18 in a convincing display in front of a sold-out stadium. They next played the Brumbies and brushed them aside in a 52–10 demolition. They next played the Highlanders who had previously only lost one match in the season, to the undefeated and table-topping Stormers. The Crusaders won comfortably 44–13 in Dunedin. The next team they played, the Sharks, had like the Highlanders previously only lost one match in the season before the Crusaders won 44–28 at Twickenham for a one off match due to earthquake damage at their own ground. They played the second match in Timaru Alpine Stadium against the Bulls in a sell out crowd winning 27–0.

5|$|A throw-in by Hagi led to Şükür {{attempting}} to reach Erdem, {{who was in}} the penalty area, but was tackled <b>and</b> <b>match</b> play continued, which saw Arsenal attack on the counter under Parlour, whose volley shot went wide. Overmars then had an opportunity, after being given the ball by Henry, but the shot was off target. In the 70th minute, Korkmaz exchanged passes with Erdem, but his effort was successfully blocked by Tony Adams. Three minutes later, Parlour attempted a bending cross for Henry, but Taffarel read it easily. A well-played pass by Nwankwo Kanu ensured the ball reached Henry on the left area, who proceeded to give it to Overmars in the penalty area – however, Overmars's shot fell flat, but still enough for Taffarel to make a save. With four minutes of normal time remaining, the Turks came close to a winning goal, when Şükür collected the ball from the centre and entered Arsenal's area, but lost his footing before he could make an effort on goal, allowing Seaman to pick up the ball for a goal kick. Two minutes of extra time were added on, just when a free-kick was awarded to Galatasaray. Şükür took the shot, but the ball headed wide around the wall. It proved to be the final event in normal time, as the match entered extra time.|$|E
