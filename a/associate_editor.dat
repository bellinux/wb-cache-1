5|$|Six {{months after}} The Inquirer was founded, with {{competition}} from eight established daily newspapers, {{lack of funds}} forced Norvell and Walker to sell the newspaper to publisher and United States Gazette <b>associate</b> <b>editor</b> Jesper Harding. After Harding acquired The Pennsylvania Inquirer, it was briefly published as an afternoon paper before returning to its original morning format in January 1830. Under Harding, in 1829, The Inquirer moved from its original location between Front and Second Streets to between Second and Third Streets. When Harding bought and merged the Morning Journal in January 1830, the newspaper was moved to South Second Street. Ten years later The Inquirer again was moved, this time to its own building {{at the corner of}} Third Street and Carter's Alley. Harding expanded The Inquirers content and the paper soon grew into a major Philadelphian newspaper. The expanded content included the addition of fiction, and in 1840, Harding gained rights to publish several Charles Dickens novels for which Dickens was paid a significant amount. At the time the common practice was to pay little or nothing for the rights of foreign authors' works.|$|E
5|$|The {{first issue}} of If was dated March 1952, with Fairman as editor; it {{featured}} stories by Richard Shaver, Raymond Palmer, and Howard Browne, all writers who were regulars of the Ziff-Davis magazines. By the time the third issue reached the news stands, the disappointing sales figures for the first issue were in, and Quinn decided to let Fairman go. Quinn persevered with himself as editor. His first issue was dated July 1952, and he continued as editor on the masthead for some years. Quinn brought in Ed Valigursky as the art editor; he designed striking covers, including some wraparound artwork—an unusual feature—which helped improve circulation. Quinn began searching for a replacement editor: writer Lester del Rey turned down the job (a decision he {{is reported to have}} later regretted), but Quinn was able to engage Larry T. Shaw, an active science-fiction fan who had sold a few stories. Shaw joined in May 1953 as <b>associate</b> <b>editor</b> and soon began writing editorials (beginning with the September 1953 issue) and assisting with story selection. The magazine's quality quickly improved and soon Quinn felt able to switch to a monthly schedule, instead of bimonthly. Shaw left after only a year, and Quinn resumed full editorial responsibilities.|$|E
