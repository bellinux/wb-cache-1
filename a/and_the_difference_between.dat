5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is a clinical diagnosis, i.e., no diagnostic test conclusively proves its presence or absence, but direct {{measurement of the}} pressure in a fascial compartment, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> this pressure and the blood pressure, {{may be used to}} assess its severity. High pressures in the compartment and a small difference between compartment pressure and blood pressure indicate that the blood supply is likely to be insufficient, and that surgical intervention may be needed.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} {{induction}} discussed above {{is seen in}} another form in debates over the foundations of statistics. The standard approach to statistical hypothesis testing avoids claims about whether evidence supports a hypothesis or makes it more probable. Instead, the typical test yields a p-value, which is the probability of the evidence being such as it is, {{under the assumption that}} the hypothesis being tested is true. If the p-value is too low, the hypothesis is rejected, in a way analogous to falsification. In contrast, Bayesian inference seeks to assign probabilities to hypotheses. Related topics in philosophy of statistics include probability interpretations, overfitting, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> correlation and causation.|$|E

5|$|Most of {{the teeth}} found with the holotype {{specimen}} were not {{attached to the}} skull; a few remained in the upper jaw, and only small replacement teeth were in the lower jaw. The teeth had the shape of recurved cones, flattened somewhat sideways. The larger teeth were less recurved than the smaller ones, but were otherwise uniform. The roots were very long, and the teeth slender. The carinae (edges) of the teeth were finely serrated with denticles {{on the front and}} back. There were seven narrow, uniform denticles per millimetre (0.039in), more than in most theropods. Some of the teeth were fluted, with six to eight ridges along the length of their inner sides and fine-grained enamel. The inner side of each tooth row had a bony wall. The number of teeth was large, with seven teeth in the right premaxilla (other theropods have three to five) and thirty-two in the dentary, where sixteen is typical. The lower jaw would have had sixty-four teeth, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> the number of teeth in the upper and lower jaws is more pronounced than in other theropods. The teeth in the dentary were more densely packed than those in the maxilla, and probably smaller. The terminal rosette in the upper jaw had thirteen dental alveoli (tooth sockets), six on the left and seven on the right side; the first four were large (with the second and third the largest), while the fourth and fifth progressively decreased in size. The diameter of the largest was twice that of the smallest. The first four alveoli of the dentary (corresponding to the tip of the upper jaw) were the largest, with the rest more regular in size. Interdental plates were between the alveoli.|$|E

25|$|Development {{of speed}} {{cushions}} has {{focused primarily on}} the European context. Consumer vehicles in Europe are typically smaller than American vehicles.

Emergency vehicles still feature a wide track width, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> them makes speed cushions more applicable.|$|E

25|$|Icon painting, in general, {{is not an}} {{opportunity}} for artistic expression, though each iconographer brings a vision to the piece. It is far more common for an icon to be copied from an older model, though with the recognition of a new saint in the church, a new icon must be created and approved. The personal and creative traditions of Catholic religious art were largely lacking in Orthodox iconography before the 17th century, when Russian iconography began to be strongly influenced by religious paintings and engravings from both Protestant and Roman Catholic Europe.

25|$|In 1969 the French government's foreign {{relations}} underwent a change with Charles de Gaulle leaving office and Georges Pompidou taking over as president. This {{change in policy}} included improving French relations with French speaking African countries, which resulted in defense accords with Senegal. Talks about the purchase of French fighters started in December 1971, but the French government was then worried that Portuguese Mirage fighters stationed in Africa would be in range of Guinea-Conakry and Senegal, and would result in protests against France by these countries. In 1972 France gave permission {{for the start of}} negotiations as long as conditions for the basing of the aircraft were agreed on before any acquisition took place.

25|$|On 20 July 1942, when Rommel {{was driving}} towards Egypt, General Headquarters (GHQ) ordered the {{construction}} of two bridges across the Nile to allow Eighth Army's armour to manoeuvre to the south if the Cairo defences were attacked. The task was assigned to X CTRE under Lt-Col E.N. Bickford. The sites chosen were at Helwan and Wasta, where the widths to be bridged were 2688 feet (820m) and 2760 feet (840m) respectively, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>difference</b> <b>between</b> high and low water was about 22 feet (7m).
