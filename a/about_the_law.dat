They made recommendations about training and policies for the hospital locally along with a number of national recommendations, including the creation of a laboratory system to coordinate a national response to emerging microbrial threats. The HSE also recommended changes to the legal situation and training of doctors <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>law.</b>|$|E
25|$|Bismarck {{was sixteen}} {{years older than}} Friedrich; before the latter became terminally ill, Bismarck did not expect he would live to see Wilhelm ascend to the throne and thus had no {{strategy}} to deal with him. Conflicts between Wilhelm and his chancellor soon poisoned their relationship. Their final split occurred after Bismarck tried to implement far-reaching anti-socialist laws in early 1890. The Kartell majority in the Reichstag, including the amalgamated Conservative Party and the National Liberal Party, was willing to make most of the laws permanent. However, it was split <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> granting the police the power to expel socialist agitators from their homes, a power {{that had been used}} excessively at times against political opponents. The National Liberals refused to make this law permanent, while the Conservatives supported only the entirety of the bill, threatening to and eventually vetoing the entire bill in session because Bismarck would not agree to a modified bill.|$|E

25|$|March 23, 2007: Attorneys {{defending}} Addison {{planned to}} contest the use of capital punishment. They intended to explore controversial issues <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> and were expected {{to refer to a}} 1997 trial in which a man convicted of murdering a police officer was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. In addition, the defense attorneys wanted a change of venue, to gain stricter security; and they wanted to prevent newspaper and television media from taking photographs of Addison while he was in prison and entering or leaving the courthouse. The defense said that such photographs could bias viewers against him and complicate his right to a fair trial. Prosecutors wanted the trial to remain in Manchester and argued that moving Addison to a different courthouse would interfere with the trial. On April 13, 2007, the judge rejected the defense attorneys' request, saying that the trial would not affect jury selection and potential jurors had likely already seen published photos of Addison.|$|E
25|$|Fairy Rosebud {{enters the}} Abode of Demon Alcohol, who {{complains}} bitterly <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> that requires demons {{to speak in}} verse; and indeed he is very bad at it. Rosebud is depressed because the Fairy Queen has {{told her that her}} incompetence can no longer be tolerated; unless she becomes more attentive to her duties of protecting mortals from demons, she will be sent to the back row of the ballet chorus. She had decided to protect and assist Aloysius Parfitt, a clergyman, and Jane Collins, a nurse. Jane has attracted the attention of Sir Trevor Mauleverer, a colonel in the Life Guards, who Rosebud believes to be a wicked baronet. Rosebud asks the demon to carry Jane off to Sir Trevor's apartment (making it look as if Sir Trevor has had her carried off) so that Rosebud can then rescue Jane and restore her to Aloysius. The demon is attracted to Rosebud and agrees. However, Jane is really Lady Angela Wealdstone, a lady of fashion, in disguise, and Sir Trevor is really an honourable man. Nevertheless, Lady Angela has run away from home to avoid being forced by her father into an arranged marriage with Sir Trevor.|$|E

500|$|Brothers Glenn and Todd Kessler {{decided to}} work with Daniel Zelman because [...] "we have a third brother, but Daniel {{is kind of like}} our fourth brother that we've known for over 20 years." [...] When the Kesslers and Zelman devised the series, they did not {{specifically}} intend for Patty and Ellen to be lawyers. They wanted to explore the power structures in two strong women—feeling that the male power dynamics had been seen before—and considered a number of professions, including entertainment and pharmaceuticals, before deciding on law. Zelman said that the writers' main motivation to write <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> [...] "was our interest in power dynamics, the dynamics of power in society. We're very much interested in the ambiguity of it. We're just interested in seeing how far we can push these characters." [...] According to Kessler, [...] "One thing that's crucial is that Patty Hewes is {{on one end of the}} spectrum and Ellen Parsons is on the other." [...] The relationship the writers were most interested in showing was that between a mentor and a mentee, which is represented by Patty and her protégée Ellen. Todd Kessler called the real life Enron case [...] "a big part" [...] of the inspiration for Patty's main case involving Arthur Frobisher, though Zelman claims that Enron was not used as a basis in particular: [...] "It was more just the culture of all those corporate scandals at the time. There seemed to be one after the other of them, and we became very interested in sort of the characters who were a part of those scandals." ...|$|E

In speaking <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> the United States repeated that it remained supportive of the One China policy as the US [...] defines it, did not support Taiwan independence, and opposed any unilateral action to change the status quo. The United States House of Representatives approved a resolution criticizing the PRC for the approval of the PRC law in Beijing. The resolution expressed grave concern <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>law</b> and said the PRC law provides a legal justification for PRC to use force against Taiwan, in its words, altering the status quo in the region.|$|E
