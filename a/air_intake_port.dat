5000|$|As {{the piston}} rises, the <b>intake</b> charge of <b>air</b> is compressed.

40|$|A {{simplified}} {{model of}} a low speed large two- stroke marine diesel engine cylinder is developed. The effect of piston position on the in-cylinder swirling flow during the scavenging process is studied using the stereo- scopic particle image velocimetry technique. The mea- surements are conducted at different cross-sectional planes along the cylinder length and at piston positions covering the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>port</b> by 0, 25, 50 and 75 %. When the intake port is fully open, the tangential velocity profile {{is similar to a}} Burgers vortex, whereas the axial velocity has a wake- like profile. Due to internal wall friction, the swirl decays downstream, {{and the size of the}} vortex core increases. For increasing port closures, the tangential velocity profile changes from a Burgers vortex to a forced vortex, and the axial velocity changes correspondingly from a wake-like profile to a jet-like profile. For piston position with 75 % intake port closure, the jet-like axial velocity profile at a cross-sectional plane close to the intake port changes back to a wake-like profile at the adjacent downstream cross-sectional plane. This is characteristic of a vortex breakdown. The non-dimensional velocity profiles show no significant variation with the variation in Reynolds number...|$|E

We are using Large Eddy Simulations in OpenFOAM, with three di erent models for the turbulent ow: a one equation model (OEM), a dynamic one equation model (DOEM) and Ta Phuoc Loc's model (TPLM). The simulated ows are grid-independent and they are computed in situations analogous to two di erent piston positions where the <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>ports</b> are uncovered 100 % and 50 %, respectively. We nd that the average ow inside the cylinder changes qualitatively with port closure from a Burgers vortex pro le to a solid body rotation while the axial velocity changes from a wake-like pro le to a jet-like pro le.

40|$|A {{mathematical}} {{model has been}} developed to evaluate the heat transfer characteristics of an Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) in the microgravity environment. The AEM is a spaceflight habitat that provides life support {{for up to six}} rodents in the Space Shuttle Middeck. Currently, temperatures within the AEM are recorded in real time using a solid state data recorder; however, the data are only available for analysis post-flight. This temperature information is useful for characterizing the thermal environment of the AEM for researchers, but is unavailable during flight operations. Because animal health in microgravity is directly linked to the thermal environment, the ability to predict internal AEM temperatures is extremely useful to life science researchers. NASA flight crews typically carry hand-held temperature measurement devices which allow them to provide ground researchers with near real time readings of AEM inlet temperature; however, higher priority operations limit the frequency at which these measurements can be made and subsequently downlinked. The {{mathematical model}} developed allows users to predict internal cage volume temperatures based on knowledge of the ambient air temperature entering the AEM <b>air</b> <b>intake</b> <b>ports.</b> Additionally, an average convective heat transfer coefficient for the AEM has been determined to provide engineers with the requisite information to facilitate future design improvements and product upgrades.

40|$|This thesis work {{relates to}} an {{intended}} improvement of volumetric efficiency, particularly on lower engine speeds, {{in a direct}} injection turbo charged gasoline engine. It {{has been known for}} a long period of time that heat transfer rate in flow components, such as intake system can have considerable effects on mass flow and consequently volumetric efficiency. There are several ways to enhance the amount of air flowing thru an engine, such as increasing size of intake and exhaust geometries. The modification that will be implemented in this project is not supposed to increase the volume of air that will flow thru the engine, but to a certain extent increase the mass flow of it. This is achieved by decreased <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> temperature which results in increased density and hence increased mass flow of the incoming <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> charge. The area of investigation in this thesis project relates to the fact that heat builds up in the cylinder head and transfers to the <b>intake</b> <b>ports</b> surfaces making them very hot. The main objective is to study how a decreased temperature of the <b>intake</b> <b>ports</b> surfaces influences the temperature of the incoming <b>intake</b> <b>air.</b> To efficiently accomplish such a study, a technical solution which intends to reduce heat transfer to the <b>intake</b> <b>ports</b> surfaces must be developed and isolated <b>intake</b> <b>ports</b> are one example of such a solution. The expected outcome of this solution is that the surface temperatures in the <b>intake</b> <b>ports</b> will be reduced and consequently heat transfer to the incoming <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> charge is reduced to a certain extent. The primary aim of the thesis project is to develop a technical solution that with a great amount prevent heat from transferring to the <b>intake</b> <b>ports</b> surfaces. The secondary aim of this study is to investigate how decreased surface temperature in the <b>intake</b> <b>ports</b> influences the incoming <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> charge temperature. Finally, the results will be compared against measured data, obtained from an identical standard single cylinder head. The intention of reducing the surface temperature in the <b>intake</b> <b>ports</b> is to hopefully answer some questions such as were the highest amount of heat transfer occurs in the <b>intake</b> <b>port,</b> if it mostly occurs over the entire <b>intake</b> <b>port</b> or predominantly near the hot intake valves. The results from the GT-Power engine simulations showed that isolated <b>intake</b> <b>ports</b> obtained a reduced surface temperature in the <b>intake</b> <b>ports.</b> That substantially led to a decreased temperature of the incoming <b>intake</b> <b>air,</b> particularly on lower engine speeds. In the single cylinder experiments it was found that the isolated <b>intake</b> <b>ports</b> were a possible method to reduce the temperature of the incoming <b>intake</b> <b>air.</b> Thus, the result did not become as positive as was indicated from the results of the theoretical simulations. To conclude, the major drawback was experienced during experiment testing, there it was noticed that the standard <b>intake</b> <b>ports</b> did not heat the incoming <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> as much as was expected. This consequently resulted that the initial improvement potential of isolated <b>intake</b> <b>ports</b> influence on <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> was not as great as what is expected from the beginning of the thesis...|$|R
5000|$|The Detroit Diesel Series 51 was a {{two-stroke}} {{diesel engine}} built by General Motors, Detroit Diesel Division from 1951 to 1959. Unlike other GM/Detroit Diesel engines, the 51 series designation did {{not refer to}} the cylinder displacement, but rather to the year it was introduced. Two versions were produced, an inline two-cylinder (2-51, 108 cid L) and an inline four-cylinder model (4-51, 216 cid L). It was a simplified version of the Series 53 {{that did not have}} exhaust valves. This was accomplished by using loop scavenging <b>ports</b> for both <b>intake</b> and exhaust along with a mechanical blower. This engine used a dry sleeve with 9 <b>intake</b> <b>ports</b> and three exhaust ports in that sleeve. These sleeves were located {{in such a way that}} the exhaust ports lined up with exhaust ports in the block that were physically higher than the <b>intake</b> <b>ports</b> in the block. This resulted in pressurized cool air being forced through the <b>intake</b> <b>ports</b> just after the exhaust started exiting (note that the exhaust ports in the sleeves were higher at the top than the <b>intake</b> <b>ports</b> while the bottom of all ports in the sleeve are at the same height. The net compression ratio is 18:1. Unlike a two cycle gasoline engine, the crankcase was not used to draw in the fuel/air mixture. Instead, the blower forced <b>air</b> in the <b>intake</b> <b>ports</b> and fuel was injected by a camshaft actuated injector which was pressurized by a gear pump. As fuel is injected just before top dead center, little unburned fuel is expelled in the exhaust, unlike a two-cycle gasoline engine. The elimination of exhaust valves reduced the complexity and weight of the engine. The power output and RPM of this engine was controlled by governing the <b>intake</b> <b>air</b> and controlling the opening of the injectors with shutdown accomplished by completely closing off the <b>air</b> <b>intake.</b> The much lower weight of this engine compared to engines with valves made it quite suitable for applications where other engines of the same horsepower were not feasible. Its uses include: Marine propulsion, generators, pumps, air compressors, road graders and other industrial uses. It was never factory installed for automotive purposes but conversion kits and engines were made available for automotive use. This engine design did not see widespread use due to not being able to reduce the exhaust noise to an acceptable level, as any exhaust restriction would have resulted in a reduction of power and efficiency. It was a very fuel efficient engine with a high power output to fuel consumption ratio.|$|R

The high energy boron-loaded propellant provides a roughly threefold increase in specific impulse compared to conventional solid rocket motors.

40|$|Abstract. The {{performance}} of internal combustion (IC) engine {{is influenced by}} the characteristic of the intake process. The intake process of is very complex because the pressure wave’s transmission and reflection lead to pulsation and resonance in the pipes. The intake quality {{is directly related to the}} structure size of <b>intake</b> <b>ports.</b> The objective of this study is to use a one-dimensional simulation methodology to optimize the <b>intake</b> <b>ports</b> structure of a four-cylinder gasoline engine equipped with turbocharger and intercooler. Steady-state simulation was performed and the results were verified by the experiment data. The impact of the structure size of <b>intake</b> <b>ports</b> on power performance was identified and analyzed. The length of <b>intake</b> <b>ports</b> influences the pressure wave in the <b>intake</b> <b>ports,</b> and then the volumetric efficiency was impacted. The length of the <b>intake</b> <b>port</b> is inversely proportional to the resonance frequency, which means the longer the pipe is, the smaller the resonance frequency is, and then the lower engine velocity the resonance point moves to.

40|$|In-cylinder {{exhaust gas}} {{recirculation}} (EGR) stratification, generally achieved by supplying EGR asymmetrically into <b>intake</b> <b>ports</b> on a four-valve diesel engine, is sensitive to trapped exhaust gas in the intake manifold and <b>intake</b> <b>ports</b> that {{is caused by the}} continuous supply of EGR during the valve-close periods of the intake valves. The subject {{of this study is to}} evaluate the distribution of trapped exhaust gas in the diesel intake system using commercial Star-CD software (version 4. 22. 018). Numeric simulations of the intake flow of fresh air and recycled exhaust in the diesel intake system were initialized following previous experiments that were conducted on a reformed six-cylinder diesel engine by supplying CO 2 instead of EGR to the tangential <b>intake</b> <b>port</b> alone to establish CO 2 stratification in the first cylinder.
