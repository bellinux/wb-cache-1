5|$|A story {{tells of}} a ninth-century Rajput king, Nahar Rao Parihar of Mandore, chasing a white boar to the lake shore on a hunting expedition. In order to quench his thirst, he dipped his hand into the lake and was <b>astonished</b> <b>to</b> see that the Leukoderma marks on his hand had disappeared. Impressed with the sacred {{curative}} nature of the lake, he got the lake restored to its glory. After discovering the curative characteristics of the lake water, people have since visited the lake to take a holy dip and cure themselves of skin problems.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, Nobel was <b>astonished</b> <b>to</b> {{read his}} own obituary, titled The {{merchant}} {{of death is}} dead, in a French newspaper. As it was Alfred's brother Ludvig who had died, the obituary was eight years premature. The article disconcerted Nobel and made him apprehensive about how he would be remembered. This inspired him to change his will. On 10 December 1896, Alfred Nobel died in his villa in San Remo, Italy, from a cerebral haemorrhage. He was 63 years old.|$|E
5|$|In {{a quaint}} rural village, {{an elderly man}} {{receives}} a card in the mail from his youngest grandson, Yogesh (Harman Baweja). In Mumbai, Yogesh's family consults an astrologer to learn if their eldest son, Jitu (Dilip Joshi), a debtor, will go to jail, and also give him Yogesh's birthdate to learn his future. They are <b>astonished</b> <b>to</b> hear that Yogesh will inherit a fortune if he is married on the 20th of that month; the phone rings, and the family is overjoyed to hear that Yogesh's grandfather has made him his sole heir.|$|E

6000|$|... "'He'll pop to-day {{as sure as}} eggs, now he's {{taken them}} two glasses of popping powder,' said the girl, as he {{went out of the}} shop. 'Well, it's <b>astonishing</b> <b>to</b> me what the men find to be afraid of.' ...|$|R
5|$|South of the pike, Archer's {{men were}} expecting an easy fight against {{dismounted}} cavalrymen and were <b>astonished</b> <b>to</b> recognize the black Hardee hats {{worn by the}} men facing them through the woods: the famous Iron Brigade, formed from regiments in the Western states of Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin, {{had a reputation as}} fierce, tenacious fighters. As the Confederates crossed Willoughby Run and climbed the slope into Herbst Woods, they were enveloped on their right by the longer Union line, the reverse of the situation north of the pike.|$|E
5|$|After {{exploring}} {{a number of}} the game's locations, the apprentice gains access to a guarded tunnel and is <b>astonished</b> <b>to</b> discover what lies on the other side. Whereas the valley where Drypeak is located is a dustbowl devoid of vegetation, the lands {{on the other side of}} the tunnel are lush and green, meaning highly illegal shaping is taking place in secret. Serviles, the Shapers' slaves created from life essence, show abnormal intelligence and self-awareness. While still reeling from the revelation of what lies beyond Drypeak, the Shaper apprentice discovers that Shanti has disappeared during one of her escapes from her armed escorts, her necklace lay broken on the grass outside the tunnel. At this point, approximately a quarter of the way through the game, the player's choices expand considerably.|$|E
5|$|Longstreet's {{attack was}} delayed, however, because he {{first had to}} wait for his final brigade (Evander M. Law's, Hood's division) to arrive, and then he was forced to march on a long, {{circuitous}} route that could not be seen by Union Army Signal Corps observers on Little Round Top. It was 4 p.m. by the time his two divisions reached their jumping off points, and then he and his generals were <b>astonished</b> <b>to</b> find the III Corps planted directly in front of them on the Emmitsburg Road. Hood argued with Longstreet that this new situation demanded a change in tactics; he wanted to swing around, below and behind, Round Top and hit the Union Army in the rear. Longstreet, however, refused to consider such a modification to Lee's order.|$|E
60|$|To Tom Canty, half {{buried in}} his silken cushions, these sounds and this {{spectacle}} were a wonder unspeakably sublime and <b>astonishing.</b> <b>To</b> his little friends at his side, the Princess Elizabeth and the Lady Jane Grey, they were nothing.|$|R
60|$|Patience and Rusha were {{considerably}} impressed, {{for it was}} <b>astonishing</b> <b>to</b> see how horribly {{terrified and}} shaken was the warrior, {{who had been in}} two pitched battles, and Ben screamed, and needed to be held in Stead's arms to console him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, a {{good deal}} that was {{peculiar}} came out to-day," [...] continued Poirot. [...] "Dr. Bauerstein, now, {{what was he doing}} up and dressed at that hour in the morning? It is <b>astonishing</b> <b>to</b> me that no one commented on the fact." ...|$|R
5|$|Morshead {{subsequently}} led the 33rd Infantry Battalion {{through the}} Battle of Messines in June 1917, and the disastrous Battle of Passchendaele in October, where the 3rd Division suffered heavy losses. In March 1918, the 3rd Division {{was sent to}} the Somme sector to help halt the German Spring Offensive. The 9th Infantry Brigade, of which the 33rd Infantry battalion was a part, was detached from the 3rd Division and sent to Villers-Bretonneux. On 30 March, the 9th Infantry Brigade's commander, Brigadier General Charles Rosenthal, ordered Morshead to restore the front around Aubercourt. With the aid of the British 12th Lancers, the battalion was able to restore the line, although it was unable to advance as far as Rosenthal hoped. The 33rd Infantry Battalion was then relieved, and withdrawn to Villers-Bretonneux to rest. However, on 4 April, Morshead was <b>astonished</b> <b>to</b> find that the line had again been broken and Villers-Bretonneux threatened. In the First Battle of Villers-Bretonneux, the battalion participated in halting the advance, and prevented the Germans from capturing the town. On 18 April, the 33rd Infantry Battalion was still in the town when it was heavily shelled with poison gas. Many men, including Morshead, became mustard gas casualties. He did not return to his unit until June.|$|E
5|$|On 10 May, Germany invaded Belgium and the Netherlands. Army Group B, under Generaloberst Fedor von Bock, {{attacked}} into Belgium, {{while the}} three Panzer corps of Army Group A under Rundstedt swung {{around to the}} south and drove for the Channel. The BEF advanced from the Belgian border to positions along the River Dyle within Belgium, where they fought elements of Army Group B starting on 10 May. They were ordered to begin a fighting withdrawal to the Scheldt River on 14 May when the Belgian and French positions on their flanks failed to hold. During a visit to Paris on 17 May, Prime Minister Winston Churchill was <b>astonished</b> <b>to</b> learn from Gamelin that the French had committed all their troops to the ongoing engagements and had no strategic reserves. On 19 May, Gort met with French General Gaston Billotte, commander of the French First Army and overall coordinator of the Allied forces. Billotte revealed that the French had no troops between the Germans and the sea. Gort immediately saw that evacuation across the Channel was the best course of action, and began planning a withdrawal to Dunkirk, the closest location with good port facilities. Surrounded by marshes, Dunkirk boasted old fortifications and the longest sand beach in Europe, where large groups could assemble. After continued engagements and a failed Allied attempt on 21 May at Arras to cut through the German spearhead, the BEF was trapped, along with the remains of the Belgian forces and the three French armies, in an area along the coast of northern France and Belgium.|$|E

60|$|At this, Uncle Chipperton grew {{very angry}} indeed. It was <b>astonishing</b> <b>to</b> see how quickly he blazed up. He had {{supposed}} {{the whole thing}} settled, and now {{to find that the}} terrible injustice--as he considered it--was still going on, was too much for him.|$|R
60|$|To {{see her in}} India was {{in itself}} <b>astonishing.</b> <b>To</b> see her {{apparently}} under such strange patronage, greatly increased his surprise. To make his way to her, and address her, seemed the natural and direct mode of satisfying the feelings which her appearance excited.|$|R
25|$|Folks at Lewiston were <b>astonished</b> <b>to</b> see Miller, Buchanan, and Shoshone {{because the}} boat's jackstaff and flag had broken {{off in the}} first rapids, then floated downriver, where it was {{recovered}} and seemed firm evidence that Shoshone had been wrecked and her men were dead.|$|E
25|$|During the {{renovation}} of the Cathedral by the Conrad Schmitt Studios, the walls were faux finished to resemble stone blocks. The effect is convincing enough that many visitors to the Cathedral are <b>astonished</b> <b>to</b> learn that the walls are not actual stone. In addition, much of the architectural work around the Coronation Window is a faux finish.|$|E
25|$|When Gladstone came to {{know him}} in later years, he was <b>astonished</b> <b>to</b> find that Parnell was ignorant even of the basic facts of Irish history. The romantic vision that characterised Young Ireland and the Fenians escaped him completely. He knew little of figures like Sarsfield, Tone or Emmett and even {{appeared}} unsure of who won the Battle of the Boyne.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know what}} I mean," [...] he retorted, with courage <b>astonishing</b> <b>to</b> him. [...] "It was because I liked you so much." [...] He {{could not say}} loved; it seemed too bold. [...] "There's nothing else can excuse it, and I don't know as that can." ...|$|R
5000|$|In an {{editorial}} of The Times on 3 August 1787, it was stated: [...] "It is <b>astonishing</b> <b>to</b> consider, how few merchants are acquainted with Smith's Wealth of Nations, or Anderson's History of Commerce, which are certainly books {{that should be}} perused by every man who makes trade his pursuit".|$|R
60|$|Presently, however, {{something}} of the same change passed over his face {{that we see in}} the sky when a cloud passes over the sun; the light faded out of it. It was <b>astonishing</b> <b>to</b> note how dull and heavy--ay, more, how bad it made him look all in a breath.|$|R
25|$|A {{spectacular}} {{example of}} variability between {{closely related species}} is the muntjac, which was investigated by Kurt Benirschke and his colleague Doris Wurster. The diploid number of the Chinese muntjac, Muntiacus reevesi, {{was found to be}} 46, all telocentric. When they looked at the karyotype of the closely related Indian muntjac, Muntiacus muntjak, they were <b>astonished</b> <b>to</b> find it had female = 6, male = 7 chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|On Christmas Eve, Clara Oswald is {{awakened by}} the sound of {{something}} crashing on her rooftop. Investigating nearby voices, she is <b>astonished</b> <b>to</b> find Santa Claus, two elves, a sleigh and flying reindeer stranded on her roof. The Doctor soon arrives to take Clara away, but not before Santa tells him that he will need his help before the night is over, while promising him a tangerine.|$|E
25|$|When Leblond and {{his colleagues}} used 14C-bicarbonate, and then 35S-labeled amino acids to {{investigate}} protein synthesis, they were <b>astonished</b> <b>to</b> find that virtually all cells in the body incorporated label. This {{led them to the}} conclusion, considered heretical at the time, that all cells continually synthesized proteins. This was among the first evidence to replace the Specificity concept with the idea that most cells are multipotential in their functions.|$|E

25|$|Although {{many members}} of the Church of England today would still be uncomfortable or sceptical about certain Catholic liturgical practices, they can be <b>astonished</b> <b>to</b> be told that, in the late 19th century, using incense, wearing vestments, putting candles on the altar and using unleavened (wafer) bread in the Eucharist could spark riots, put priests in prison and even led in 1888–90 to the {{prosecution}} of a bishop – Edward King, Bishop of Lincoln.|$|E
25|$|The {{errors in}} the {{official}} KLM approach chart the crew had relied on. It emerged during the enquiry that these charts had been copied from war-era United States Air Force charts, which upon subsequent examination were also found to be faulty. The court of enquiry was <b>astonished</b> <b>to</b> find that KLM had relied on maps from a foreign authority when detailed and correct maps were available from the Ordnance Survey, the United Kingdom's national mapping authority.|$|E
25|$|Fraser {{made his}} first trip to the American south, and {{specifically}} to Charleston, South Carolina in 1783 or 1784, sending home consignments of plants to a Frank Thorburn of Old Brompton. Returning to England in 1785 with the expectation of recompense for his labour and risk, he was <b>astonished</b> <b>to</b> learn that all the valuable plants he had forwarded were dead, and the survivors, which were common, could not be disposed of. Vexed, Fraser subsequently entered into a lawsuit over the matter, a suit long and very expensive to both parties, but sailed again for South Carolina in the autumn nonetheless.|$|E
