25|$|For axiomatic {{treatment}} of thermodynamic equilibrium, since the 1930s, {{it has become}} customary {{to refer to a}} zeroth law of thermodynamics. The customarily stated minimalist version of such a law postulates only that all bodies, which when thermally connected would be in thermal equilibrium, should be said to have the same temperature by definition, but by itself does not establish temperature as a quantity expressed as a real number on a scale. A more physically informative version of such a law views empirical temperature as a chart on a hotness manifold. While the zeroth law permits the definitions of many different empirical scales of temperature, the second law of thermodynamics selects the definition of a single preferred, <b>absolute</b> <b>temperature,</b> unique up to an arbitrary scale factor, whence called the thermodynamic temperature. If internal energy is considered {{as a function of the}} volume and entropy of a homogeneous system in thermodynamic equilibrium, thermodynamic <b>absolute</b> <b>temperature</b> appears as the partial derivative of internal energy with respect the entropy at constant volume. Its natural, intrinsic origin or null point is absolute zero at which the entropy of any system is at a minimum. Although this is the lowest <b>absolute</b> <b>temperature</b> described by the model, the third law of thermodynamics postulates that absolute zero cannot be attained by any physical system.|$|E

40|$|Despite its benefits, {{free cooling}} may expose servers to high <b>absolute</b> <b>{{temperature}}s,</b> wide temperature variations, and high humidity when datacenters are sited at certain locations.

In this paper, we identify the runtime management strate-gies required to limit <b>absolute</b> <b>temperatures,</b> temperature vari-ations, humidity, and cooling energy in free-cooled datacen-ters. As the basis for our study, we propose CoolAir, a system that embodies these strategies. Using CoolAir and a real free-cooled datacenter prototype, we show that effective manage-ment requires cooling infrastructures that can act smoothly. In addition, we show that CoolAir can tightly manage tem-perature and significantly reduce temperature variation, often at a lower cooling cost than existing free-cooled datacenters. Perhaps most importantly, based on our results, we derive several principles and lessons that should guide the design of management systems for free-cooled datacenters of any size...|$|R

25|$|Unit {{conversion}} for temperature {{differences is}} {{simply a matter of}} multiplying by, e.g., 1°F / 1 K (although the ratio is not a constant value). But because some of these scales have origins that do not correspond to absolute zero, conversion from one temperature scale to another requires accounting for that. As a result, simple dimensional analysis can lead to errors if it is ambiguous whether 1 K means the <b>absolute</b> <b>temperature</b> equal to −273.15°C, or the temperature difference equal to 1°C.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose that}} {{negative}} <b>absolute</b> <b>temperatures</b> in ultracold atomic clouds in optical lattices {{can be used}} to simulate quantum systems in new regions of phase diagrams. First we discuss how the attractive SU(3) Hubbard model in three dimensions can be realized using repulsively interacting 173 -Yb atoms, then we consider how an antiferromagnetic S= 1 spin chain could be simulated using spinor 87 -Rb or 23 -Na atoms. The general idea to achieve negative <b>absolute</b> <b>temperatures</b> is to reverse the sign of the external harmonic potential. Energy conservation in a deep optical lattice imposes a constraint on the dynamics of the cloud, which can relax toward a T< 0 state.
