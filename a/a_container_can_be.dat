50|$|A live {{migration}} and checkpointing feature was released for OpenVZ {{in the middle}} of April 2006. This makes it possible to move a container from one physical server to another without shutting down the container. The process is known as checkpointing: a container is frozen and its whole state is saved to a file on disk. This file can then be transferred to another machine and <b>a</b> <b>container</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> unfrozen (restored) there; the delay is roughly a few seconds. Because state is usually preserved completely, this pause may appear to be an ordinary computational delay.|$|E

This paper introduces a non-contact type simple method for indicating liquid level. This method uses image processing techniques like the image analysis, processing, and edge detection.

The profit or cost models for optimal price schedule are developed from the viewpoint of a public terminal operator as well as a private terminal operator.

40|$|The {{ease with}} which <b>a</b> <b>container</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> {{accessed}} or its ‘openability’ is becoming more of an issue for manufacturers and consumers as {{the average age of}} the population increases. Ageing brings with it a range of issues including a loss of strength and reduced dexterity. This paper aimed to look at the relationship between diameter, torque and age for standard consumer closures using a torque-measuring device. The results of the investigation show that larger-diameter jars (85 mm) require much higher opening forces than smaller ones (75 mm and below). Smaller jars require lower opening torques, although the force required to open many jars is still higher than many elderly people are able to generate...|$|E

40|$|When {{handling}} 2 D packing problems, numerous {{incomplete and}} complete algorithms maintain a so-called bottom-left (BL) property: no rectangle placed in <b>a</b> <b>container</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> moved more left or bottom. While {{it is easy}} to make a rectangle BL when it is added in a container, it is more expensive to maintain all the placed pieces BL when a rectangle is removed. This prevents researchers from designing incremental moves for metaheuristics or efficient complete optimization algorithms. This paper investigates the possibility of violating the BL property. Instead, we propose to maintain the set of maximal holes, which allows incremental additions and removals of rectangles. To validate our alternative approach, we have designed an incremental move, main-taining maximal holes, for the strip packing problem, a variant of the famous 2 D bin-packing. We have also implemented a metaheuristic, with no user-defined parameter, using this move and standard greedy heuristics. We have finally designed two variants of this incomplete method. In the first variant, a better first layout is provided by a hyperheuristic proposed by some of the authors. In the second variant, a fast repacking procedure recovering the BL property is occasionally called during the local search...|$|E

40|$|Materials can {{flow down}} a slope {{in a wide}} range of {{geophysical}} and industrial contexts, including lava flows on volcanoes and thin films on coated surfaces. The aim of my research is to provide quantitative insight into these forms of motion and their dependence on effects of the topography, the volume and the rheology of the flowing structure. Numerous different problems are investigated through mathematical models, which are developed analytically and confirmed by laboratory experiments. The initial advance of long lava flows is studied by considering the flow of viscous fluid released on sloping channels. A scaling analysis, in agreement with analog experiments and field data, offers a practical tool for predicting the advance of lava flows and conducting hazard analysis. A simple and powerful theory predicts the structure of flows resulting from any time-dependent release of fluid down a slope. Results obtained by the method of characteristics reveal how the speed of the advancing front depends importantly on the rate of fluid supplied at an earlier time. Viscous flows on surfaces with different shapes are described by similarity solutions to address problems motivated by engineering as well as geophysical applications. Pouring viscous fluid out of <b>a</b> <b>container</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> a frustratingly slow process depending on the shape and the degree of tipping of the container. The discharge rate of the fluid is analysed in simple cases, shedding light on how containers can be emptied most quickly in cosmetic and food industries. In a separate study motivated by coating industries, thin films are shown to evolve with uniform thickness as they drain near the top of a horizontal cylinder or sphere. The leading edge eventually splits into rivulets as predicted theoretically and confirmed by experiments. Debris flows can develop levees and trigger avalanches which are studied by considering dense granular flows down a rough inclined plane. Granular materials released down a slope can produce a flowing structure confined by levees or trigger avalanches at regular intervals, depending on the steady rate of supply. The experimental results are discussed using theoretical ideas of shallow granular flows. Finally, materials flowing in long and slender ducts are investigated theoretically to better understand the digestive and urinary systems in biology. The materials are pumped in an elastic tube by translating waves of muscular contraction and relaxation. The deformation of the tube is predicted by solving a free-boundary problem, a similar mathematical exercise to predicting the moving boundaries of materials spreading on slopes.
