5|$|According to the 2015 Louisiana Laws Revised Statutes, {{residents}} of any unincorporated area may propose to incorporate as a municipality if the area meets prescribed minimum population thresholds. Municipal corporations are divided based on population into three classes: cities, towns, and villages. Those having five thousand inhabitants or more <b>are</b> <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> cities; those having {{less than five}} thousand but more than one thousand inhabitants <b>are</b> <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> towns; and those having one thousand or fewer inhabitants <b>are</b> <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> villages. The governor may change the classification of the municipality if the board of aldermen requests a change and a census shows that the population has increased or decreased making it eligible for a different classification. Municipalities are granted powers to perform functions required by local governments including the levy and collection of taxes and to assume indebtedness.|$|E

5|$|Early {{spectral}} {{classification of}} the nuclei of the LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers {{indicated that the}} properties of LIRGs that host hydroxyl megamasers cannot be distinguished from the overall population of LIRGs. Roughly one third of megamaser hosts <b>are</b> <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> starburst galaxies, one quarter <b>are</b> <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> Seyfert 2 galaxies, and the remainder <b>are</b> <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions, or LINERs. The optical properties of hydroxyl megamaser hosts and non-hosts are not significantly different. Recent infrared observations using the Spitzer Space Telescope are, however, able to distinguish hydroxyl megamaser hosts galaxies from non-masing LIRGs, as 10–25% of hydroxyl megamaser hosts show evidence for an active galactic nucleus, compared to 50–95% for non-masing LIRGs.|$|E

5|$|A {{metalloid}} is {{an element}} with properties in between, or that are a mixture of, those of metals and nonmetals, and which is therefore hard to classify as either a metal or a nonmetal. This is a generic definition that draws on metalloid attributes consistently cited in the literature. Difficulty of categorisation is a key attribute. Most elements have a mixture of metallic and nonmetallic properties, and can be classified according to which set of properties is more pronounced. Only the elements {{at or near the}} margins, lacking a sufficiently clear preponderance of either metallic or nonmetallic properties, <b>are</b> <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> metalloids.|$|E

5|$|A pond {{is a body}} of {{standing}} water, either natural or man-made, that is usually smaller than a lake. A wide variety of man-made bodies of water <b>are</b> <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> ponds, including water gardens designed for aesthetic ornamentation, fish ponds designed for commercial fish breeding, and solar ponds designed to store thermal energy. Ponds and lakes are distinguished from streams via current speed. While currents in streams are easily observed, ponds and lakes possess thermally driven micro-currents and moderate wind driven currents. These features distinguish a pond from many other aquatic terrain features, such as stream pools and tide pools.|$|E
5|$|As for all metals, {{molecular}} {{compounds and}} polyatomic ions of cobalt <b>are</b> <b>classified</b> <b>as</b> coordination complexes, that is, molecules or ions that contain cobalt linked to several ligands. The principles of electronegativity and hardness–softness {{of a series}} of ligands can be used to explain the usual oxidation state of cobalt. For example, Co+3 complexes tend to have ammine ligands. Because phosphorus is softer than nitrogen, phosphine ligands tend to feature the softer Co2+ and Co+, an example being tris(triphenylphosphine)cobalt(I) chloride ((P(C6H5)3)3CoCl). The more electronegative (and harder) oxide and fluoride can stabilize Co4+ and Co5+ derivatives, e.g. caesium hexafluorocobaltate (Cs2CoF6) and potassium percobaltate (K3CoO4).|$|E
