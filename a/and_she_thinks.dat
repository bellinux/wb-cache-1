5|$|Leslie is {{convinced}} she can reason with Andy {{if they can}} talk without their lawyers, but Andy will not return her calls. Finally, Ann calls Andy and asks {{him to come to}} her house. Later that day, he arrives completely naked, having assumed Ann wanted to take him back. A disgusted Ann leaves the house, leaving Leslie and Andy to talk. Andy admits he is suing the town in an attempt to win Ann back, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> of a different way he can impress her. The next day at city hall, Andy tells Leslie and Scott he will drop the lawsuit if they agree to fill in the pit right away. Scott agrees, unaware it was a trick between Andy and Leslie. The next day the pit is filled in and turned into a lot, and an impressed Ann waves at Andy while the construction work is going on. The episode ends with Keef riding a motorboat, revealing his role in KaBOOM! was an elaborate prank to get the playground built, and announcing he is going to build a hospital in a poor part of China.|$|E
5|$|The {{whole town}} goes cold turkey {{and begins to}} suffer from intense sugar withdrawal. Homer joins a secret group led by Garth Motherloving and Mr. Burns to smuggle sugar from the island of San Glucos. After {{arriving}} back in Springfield, and evading a police boat, Homer brings the sugar to the docks. Marge pleads Homer to dump the cargo. There Homer is presented with two choices: to obey Marge and press the button Drop Cargo or bring the sugar to Garth Motherloving by pressing the button Obey Bad Guy. After contemplating, Homer drops the cargo and all the sugar falls to the Springfield docks' water. All Springfielders, even those who seemed happier and healthier without sugar, jump into the harbor and drink the sugar water. Judge Snyder then declares the ban over and dives in with everyone else. Marge is upset <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> about giving up changing the world. However, Homer tells her that he loves her when she tries to make a world a better place.|$|E
25|$|This is a {{book that}} contradicts itself a hundred times; {{but that is not}} a {{criticism}} of it, because its author thinks contradictions are a sign of intellectual ferment and vitality. This {{is a book}} that systematically distorts and selects historical evidence; but that is not a criticism, because its author thinks that all interpretations are biased, and she regards it as her duty to pick and choose her facts to favor her own brand of politics. This is a book full of vaporous, French-intellectual prose that makes Teilhard de Chardin sound like Ernest Hemingway by comparison; but that is not a criticism, because the author likes that sort of prose and has taken lessons in how to write it, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> that plain, homely speech is part of a conspiracy to oppress the poor.|$|E

500|$|She {{spent six}} months in a {{wheelchair}} and another 18 months on crutches. Mortimer's right foot has six screws and a plate, and her left foot has two screws; her ankles are continuously sore, and occasionally lock up. During the Paralympics she told the Canadian Press that her feet were [...] "killing" [...] her, and her condition is degenerative. When Mortimer's casts were removed her walking rehabilitation was in the water, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> {{she would not be}} able to walk without the aquatic rehab. Before the injury, she had 10 sessions per week in the pool (swimming [...] each session) in addition to weight training and running. After the accident her weekly threshold at the local YMCA pool was [...] and four sessions in the weight room. Her disability is not usually evident to spectators, and according to the Canadian Press she walks with a [...] "halfway normal gait." ...|$|E
500|$|To {{prepare for}} the storyline Lane {{discussed}} her character's backstory with directors. She recalled that Kylie had previously suffered addiction which adds to the drama. Writers devised [...] "heavy scripts" [...] for Lane {{and she had to}} thoroughly research the issue. Lane hoped the story would raise awareness and also convey that ADHD is not a disease. After the story was broadcast, Lane has explained that Kylie blamed herself for Max's ADHD. She believes her past actions have contributed to his behavioural issues and she refuses to listen to reassurance from her family. The actress blamed Kylie's [...] "very low self-esteem" [...] as a mother <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> other residents are judging her. Kylie becomes stressed with managing Max's condition and looking after Lily. She wants to feel calm after working herself into a [...] "tired and frustrated" [...] state. She takes his medication thinking it will calm her down but she regrets her actions.|$|E
500|$|A {{couple of}} months later, Toyah {{received}} a letter from Phil asking her to visit him in prison and in return he would plead guilty to raping her. Until the letter arrived, Toyah had been piecing her life back together by getting her job back at the Rovers and starting a romance with Sam. Of how Toyah felt about the letter, Taylor told Adrian Lobb from Inside Soap, [...] "By the time Toyah gets the letter, she has grown a little stronger. But it comes as a complete surprise. Toyah doesn't trust Phil, obviously, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> he's playing games. While part of her wants to confront him about the attack, there's another side of her that wants to let it go, and just leave it to the courts to deal with him." [...] Toyah agreed to Phil's request to visit him and Taylor said that Toyah believed that seeing Phil in person would help her {{to come to terms with}} what happened. When Toyah came face to face with Phil, her first thought was how pathetic he looked. When Phil tried to make excuses for what he had done, Toyah did not feel any pity and told him to plead guilty, which he agreed to do. Toyah left the prison feeling [...] "tearful, but triumphant" [...] and Taylor commented that while she would never fully recover from her ordeal, Toyah was determined to look towards the future.|$|E
60|$|Yet that {{abandonment}} of the walks insisted on looking mean to him. <b>And</b> <b>she</b> would <b>think</b> it mean. Which was very much worse, somehow. Why mean? Why should <b>she</b> <b>think</b> it mean? He grew angry again.|$|R

500|$|In {{the last}} {{scene of the}} episode, Bart is seen writing [...] "I will not expose the ignorance of the faculty" [...] on the {{blackboard}} as a punishment for exposing the ignorance of the teachers by removing the Teachers' Editions. In his book The Small Screen: How Television Equips Us to Live in the Information Age, Brian L. Ott describes this scene {{as one of the}} [...] "key ways The Simpsons appeals to audience, which tends to be younger, by critiquing authority figures, and in particular educators." [...] Toby Daspit and John Weaver write in their book Popular Culture and Critical Pedagogy: Reading, Constructing, Connecting that the writers of The Simpsons are [...] "particularly interested" [...] in questions about authority and the abuses of powers in school. Another scene from the episode sees Ms. Hoover telling the students to stare at the blackboard for fifteen minutes until class is over. Daspit and Weaver write that it is [...] "the absolute power that teachers have over students' every action that allows for the image to be presented on The Simpsons. It would be comforting to tell ourselves that this is simply parody run amok, that the writers are stretching reality to make a point, but the discussants in the study [...] had memories of a reality very much like the one presented in this program." [...] One of the discussants said she believes everyone has experienced similar situations in their school years, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> the thought that [...] "an educator could ever do something so useless and pointless with the children's time" [...] is [...] "frightening".|$|E

[...] says it was an idle saying suggested by Bassett's praising the lady Anne and dispraising the Queen that now is. Never spoke {{at any other time}} of the lady Anne, <b>and</b> <b>she</b> <b>thinks</b> the King's divorce from her good. Examined why she said, [...] "What a man is the King! How many wives will he have?" [...] She said it upon the sudden tidings declared to her by Bassett, when she was sorry for the change and knew not so much as she knows now".|$|E
