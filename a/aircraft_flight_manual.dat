25|$|The minimum control speed (VMC) of an {{aircraft}} (specifically an airplane) is a V-speed that specifies the calibrated airspeed below which directional or lateral {{control of the}} aircraft {{can no longer be}} maintained, after the failure of one or more engines. The VMC only applies if at least one engine is still operative, and will depend on the stage of flight. Indeed, multiple VMCs have to be calculated for landing, air travel, and ground travel, and there are more still for aircraft with four or more engines. These are all included in the <b>aircraft</b> <b>flight</b> <b>manual</b> of all multi-engine aircraft. When design engineers are sizing an airplane's vertical tail and flight control surfaces, they {{have to take into account}} the effect this will have on the airplane's minimum control speeds.|$|E
2500|$|Transport Canada defines it as: [...] "Critical {{engine failure}} {{recognition}} speed" [...] and adds: [...] "This definition is not restrictive. An operator may adopt any other definition {{outlined in the}} <b>aircraft</b> <b>flight</b> <b>manual</b> (AFM) of TC type-approved aircraft as long as such definition does not compromise operational safety of the aircraft." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{maneuvering}} {{speed of}} an aircraft is shown on a cockpit placard {{and in the}} <b>aircraft's</b> <b>flight</b> <b>manual</b> but is not commonly shown on the aircraft's airspeed indicator.|$|R
50|$|Aircraft {{authorised}} {{gross weight}} limits (also {{referred to as}} certified weight limits) are laid down in the <b>aircraft</b> <b>flight</b> <b>manuals</b> (AFM) and/or associated certificate of airworthiness (C of A). The authorised or permitted limits may be equal to or lower than the structural design weight limits.|$|R
25|$|As {{a result}} of their {{investigation}} of the accident, the CAB urged the FAA to mandate a redesign of the elevator boost control, so that the shift to manual mode could be easily carried out by the pilots, even when applying nose down pressure. The FAA replied that they had asked the manufacturer to incorporate procedural changes in the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>flight</b> <b>manual,</b> but did not require any design changes.|$|R

50|$|A typical AFM is a pilot's {{operating}} handbook (POH), {{which became the}} standard format for an AFM after 1978.An <b>aircraft</b> <b>flight</b> <b>manual</b> is serial number specific, whereas a pilot's {{operating handbook}} is merely model specific.|$|E
50|$|An <b>aircraft</b> <b>flight</b> <b>manual</b> (AFM) {{is a book}} {{containing}} the information required to safely operate the aircraft. The information within an AFM is also referred to a Technical Airworthiness Data (TAWD). A typical flight manual will contain the following: operating limitations, Normal/Abnormal/Emergency operating procedures, performance data and loading information.|$|E
50|$|The {{performance}} data for landing an aircraft {{can be obtained}} from the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>flight</b> <b>manual</b> or pilot's operating handbook. It will state the distance required to bring the aircraft to a stop under ideal conditions, assuming the aircraft crosses the runway threshold at a height of 50 ft, at the correct speed. The actual landing performance of an aircraft is affected by many variables which must be taken into account.|$|R
5000|$|Specific <b>{{aircraft}}</b> NATOPS <b>flight</b> <b>manuals</b> {{for each}} USN and USMC T/M/S aircraft; these {{are similar to}} the Air Force Technical Order [...] "Dash 1" [...] series <b>flight</b> <b>manuals</b> in the U.S. Air Force for each mission design series (MDS) aircraft in USAF service.|$|R
2500|$|Aviation {{regulations}} (such as FAR and EASA) define {{several different}} VMCs and require design engineers to size the vertical tail and the aerodynamic flight controls {{of the aircraft}} to comply with these regulations. The minimum control speed in the air (VMCA) {{is the most important}} minimum control speed of a multi-engine aircraft, which is why VMCA is simply listed as VMC in many aviation regulations and <b>aircraft</b> <b>flight</b> <b>manuals.</b> On the airspeed indicator of a twin-engine aircraft of less than 2722kg, the VMCA is indicated by a red radial line, as standardised by FAR 23.|$|R

50|$|Position error {{affects the}} {{indicated}} airspeed and the indicated altitude. Aircraft manufacturers use the <b>aircraft</b> <b>flight</b> <b>manual</b> to publish {{details of the}} error in indicated airspeed and indicated altitude across the operating range of speeds. In many aircraft, the effect of position error on airspeed is shown as the difference between indicated airspeed and calibrated airspeed. In some low-speed aircraft, the position error is shown as the difference between indicated airspeed and equivalent airspeed.|$|E
50|$|The IAS is an {{important}} value for the pilot {{because it is the}} indicated speeds which are specified in the <b>aircraft</b> <b>flight</b> <b>manual</b> for such important performance values as the stall speed. These speeds, in true airspeed terms, vary considerably depending upon density altitude. However, at typical civilian operating speeds, the aircraft's aerodynamic structure responds to dynamic pressure alone, and the aircraft will perform the same when at the same dynamic pressure. Since it is this same dynamic pressure that drives the airspeed indicator, an aircraft will always, for example, stall at the published indicated airspeed (for the current configuration) regardless of density, altitude or true airspeed.|$|E
50|$|Aviation {{regulations}} (such as FAR and EASA) define {{several different}} VMCs and require design engineers to size the vertical tail and the aerodynamic flight controls {{of the aircraft}} to comply with these regulations. The minimum control speed in the air (VMCA) {{is the most important}} minimum control speed of a multi-engine aircraft, which is why VMCA is simply listed as VMC in many aviation regulations and <b>aircraft</b> <b>flight</b> <b>manuals.</b> On the airspeed indicator of a twin-engine aircraft of less than 2722 kg, the VMCA is indicated by a red radial line, as standardised by FAR 23. Most test pilot schools use multiple, more specific minimum control speeds, as VMC will change depending on the stage of flight. Other defined VMCs include minimum control speed on the ground (VMCG) and minimum control speed during approach and landing (VMCL). In addition, with aircraft with four or more engines, VMCs exist for cases with either one or two engines inoperative on the same wing. Figure 1 illustrates the VMCs that are defined in the relevant civil aviation regulations and in military specifications.|$|R
50|$|Mean Aerodynamic Chord (MAC): A {{specific}} {{chord line}} of a tapered wing. At the mean aerodynamic chord, the center of pressure has the same aerodynamic force, position, and area as it does {{on the rest of}} the wing. The MAC represents the width of an equivalent rectangular wing in given conditions. On some aircraft, the center of gravity is expressed as a percentage of the length of the MAC. In order to make such a calculation, the position of the leading edge of the MAC must be known ahead of time. This position is defined as a distance from the reference datum and is found in the <b>aircraft's</b> <b>flight</b> <b>manual</b> and also on the aircraft's type certificate data sheet. If a general MAC is not given but a LeMAC (leading edge mean aerodynamic chord) and a TeMAC (trailing edge mean aerodynamic chord) are given (both of which would be referenced as an arm measured out from the datum line) then your MAC can be found by finding the difference between your LeMAC and your TeMAC.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{motive to}} use the iPad as a {{navigation}} tool is the practicality of the product. The iPad would replace about 25 pounds of paper charts used by pilots that include <b>aircraft</b> <b>flight</b> <b>manuals,</b> approach plates, navigation charts, policy manuals, minimum equipment list and taxi charts. Major airlines based in the United States are mainly paper based, which includes some who have fleets of 900 plus planes. This translates {{to a lot of}} paper in the form of charts that could be saved by the iPad. The switch to an electronic system would also make life easier on the pilot. No longer would pilots carry around a heavy flight bag. It would be replaced by the 9.5 inch by 7.31 inch 1.33 pound tablet. When used in conjunction with a specially designed strap, this small size allows them to be used in place of kneeboards. Flight planning is also made easier by the iPad. The pilot would be able to use one device to check everything from weather, other airport facilities and flight plans. All this makes a pilot's life a lot easier.|$|R
50|$|The {{investigation}} committee then {{noticed that}} the aircraft had flown directly into a storm. According to the flight manual, the crew should have activated the aircraft's anti-icing system each time the aircraft entered mists, fogs, clouds, rain, snow, hail, or when flying at 500 ft near cloud base among several other flight conditions. They then {{found out that the}} aircraft was not de-iced while the outside temperature was well below 6 degrees(C). The <b>aircraft</b> <b>flight</b> <b>manual</b> said not to rely on airframe visual icing cues before turning engine anti-ice on. It states that the consequences of not using an engine anti-ice until build up was visible from the cockpit might result in severe engine damage.|$|E
50|$|The minimum control speed (VMC) of an {{aircraft}} (specifically an airplane) is a V-speed that specifies the calibrated airspeed below which directional or lateral {{control of the}} aircraft {{can no longer be}} maintained, after the failure of one or more engines. The VMC only applies if at least one engine is still operative, and will depend on the stage of flight. Indeed, multiple VMCs have to be calculated for landing, air travel, and ground travel, and there are more still for aircraft with four or more engines. These are all included in the <b>aircraft</b> <b>flight</b> <b>manual</b> of all multi-engine aircraft. When design engineers are sizing an airplane's vertical tail and flight control surfaces, they {{have to take into account}} the effect this will have on the airplane's minimum control speeds.|$|E
50|$|Reference Datum:The {{reference}} datum is {{a reference}} plane that allows accurate, and uniform, measurements to any {{point on the}} aircraft. The location of the reference datum is established by the manufacturer and is defined in the <b>aircraft</b> <b>flight</b> <b>manual.</b> The horizontal reference datum is an imaginary vertical plane or point, placed along the longitudinal axis of the aircraft, from which all horizontal distances are measured for weight and balance purposes. There is no fixed rule for its location, {{and it may be}} located forward of the nose of the aircraft. For helicopters, it may be located at the rotor mast, the nose of the helicopter, or even at a point in space ahead of the helicopter. While the horizontal reference datum can be anywhere the manufacturer chooses, most small training helicopters have the horizontal reference datum 100 inches forward of the main rotor shaft centerline. This is to keep all the computed values positive. The lateral reference datum is usually located {{at the center of the}} helicopter.|$|E
5000|$|In some {{aircraft}} that spin readily upright and inverted, such as Pitts- and Christen Eagle-type high-performance aerobatic aircraft, an alternative spin-recovery technique may effect recovery as well, namely: Power off, Hands off the stick/yoke, Rudder full opposite to the spin (or more simply [...] "push the rudder pedal that is hardest to push") and held (aka the Mueller/Beggs technique). An {{advantage of the}} Mueller/Beggs technique is that no knowledge of whether the spin is erect or inverted is required during what {{can be a very}} stressful and disorienting time. Even though this method does work in a specific subset of spin-approved airplanes, the NASA Standard/PARE procedure can also be effective provided that care must be taken to ensure the spin does not simply cross from positive to negative (or vice versa) and that a too-rapid application of elevator control is avoided as it may cause aerodynamic blanketing of the rudder rendering the control ineffective and simply accelerate the spin. The converse, however, may not be true at all—many cases exist where Beggs/Mueller fails to recover the airplane from the spin, but NASA Standard/PARE will terminate the spin. Before spinning any <b>aircraft</b> the <b>flight</b> <b>manual</b> should be consulted to establish if the particular type has any specific spin recovery techniques that differ from standard practice.|$|R
50|$|On August 16, 2001, Moussaoui {{was arrested}} by Harry Samit of the FBI and INS agents in Minnesota and charged with an {{immigration}} violation.

5000|$|Investigators {{initially}} {{suspected the}} right wing had been modified during maintenance {{in such a way}} that it resulted in an aerodynamic imbalance. To confirm this hypothesis, the remains of {{the right wing}} were sent to the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute, where engineers concluded the right wing was fully functional until impact. Investigators recreated the flight path until impact on another Tupolev Tu-104, and published their findings. Flight testing showed that the Tupolev Tu-104 was prone to banking in a side wind. In the low altitude situation, the pilot's response of adjusting the ailerons was not sufficient; the proper response would have been to sharply pull back on the throttles. They concluded that as soon as the aircraft separated from the runway, the aircraft exceeding the <b>aircraft</b> <b>flight</b> <b>manual</b> recommended 2-3° angle of takeoff, at times reaching a dangerous 3-4°; the wind was believed to have pushed the right wing into the roll. [...] Calculations showed the right fuel tanks held an estimated 1300-1500 kilos more fuel than the left, contributing to the roll.|$|E
50|$|The {{investigation}} found the propellers oversped because the Captain pulled the power levers through the flight idle gate {{and into the}} ground beta range during flight. This was prohibited by the <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>Manual.</b> Although a 'beta lockout' mechanism did exist for DHC-8-100,-200, and -300 series aircraft which prevented the propellers from going into reverse even if the power levers were moved into the beta range during flight, this mechanism was only required by regulation to be installed in DHC-8 aircraft operating in the USA. It was not required to be fitted to DHC-8 aircraft in Papua New Guinea, {{and it was not}} fitted to MCJ. If a beta lockout mechanism had been installed on the aircraft, the double propeller overspeed would not have occurred when the power levers were moved below the flight idle range and in the ground beta range during flight. Installation of this mechanism is now mandatory on DHC-8 aircraft worldwide by 19 June 2016. If the pilots had followed the standard emergency procedures detailed in company manuals, they would have given themselves more time to manage the emergency, consider their options, and carry out the approach and forced landing.|$|E
50|$|U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{investigators}} queried the German Luftfahrt-Bundesamt (LBA), Germany's {{equivalent of}} the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regarding the accident history of the Nimbus-4DM {{in conjunction with a}} 1999 accident near Minden, Nevada where both occupants of the aircraft were killed. In this accident, the glider broke up in flight during the recovery phase after a departure from controlled flight while maneuvering in thermal lift conditions. Airborne witnesses in other gliders who saw the beginning of the accident sequence said the glider was in a tight turn, as if climbing in a thermal, when it entered a spiral. With a 45-degree nose-down attitude, the speed quickly built up as the glider completed two full rotations. The rotation then stopped, the flight stabilized on a northeasterly heading, and the nose pitched further down to a near-vertical attitude (this is consistent with the spin recovery technique specified in the <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>Manual</b> (AFM)). The glider was observed to level its attitude, with the wings bending upward and the wing tips coning higher, when the outboard wing tip panels separated from the glider, the wings disintegrated, and the fuselage dived into the ground. Several witnesses estimated that the wing deflection reached 45 degrees or more before the wings failed. Examination of the wreckage disclosed that the left and right outboard wing sections failed symmetrically at two locations.|$|E
40|$|Aircraft {{departing from}} the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW) {{encounter}} vertical restrictions that prevent continuous ascent operations. The {{result of these}} restrictions are temporary level-offs at 10, 000 feet. A combination of flow direction, specific Area Navigation (RNAV) route geometry, and arrival streams {{have been found to}} be the biggest factors in the duration and frequency of a temporary level-offs. In total, 20 % of DFW departures are affected by these level-offs, which have an average duration of just over 100 seconds. The use of continuous descent approaches at DFW are shown to lessen the impact arrivals have on the departures and allow more continuous ascents. The fuel used in a continuous ascent and an ascent with a temporary level-off have been calculated using a fuel burn rate model created from a combination of actual aircraft track data, <b>aircraft</b> manufacturer <b>flight</b> operations <b>manuals,</b> and Eurocontrol’s Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) simulation tool. This model represents the average aggregate burn rates for the current fleet mix at DFW. Continuous ascents would save approximately seven gallons of fuel out of 450 gallons used to climb to a cruise altitude of 31, 000 ft per departure. I...|$|R

40|$|Many {{types of}} paper {{documentation}} are employed on the flight-deck. They {{range from a}} simple checklist card to a bulky <b>Aircraft</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>Manual</b> (AFM). Some of these documentations have typographical and graphical deficiencies; yet, many cockpit tasks such as conducting checklists, way-point entry, limitations and performance calculations, and many more, {{require the use of}} these documents. Moreover, during emergency and abnormal situations, the flight crews' effectiveness in combating the situation is highly dependent on such documentation; accessing and reading procedures has a significant impact on flight safety. Although flight-deck documentation are an important (and sometimes critical) form of display in the modern cockpit, there is a dearth of information on how to effectively design these displays. The object of this report is to provide a summary of the available literature regarding the design and typographical aspects of printed matter. The report attempts 'to bridge' the gap between basic research about typography, and the kind of information needed by designers of flight-deck documentation. The report focuses on typographical factors such as type-faces, character height, use of lower- and upper-case characters, line length, and spacing. Some graphical aspects such as layout, color coding, fonts, and character contrast are also discussed. In addition, several aspects of cockpit reading conditions such as glare, angular alignment, and paper quality are addressed. Finally, a list of recommendations for the graphical design of flight-deck documentation is provided...|$|E
