50|$|FHSS is a {{wireless}} technology that spreads its signal over rapidly changing frequencies.Each available frequency band {{is divided into}} sub-frequencies. Signals rapidly change ("hop") among these in a pre-determined order. Interference at a specific frequency will only affect the signal during that short interval. FHSS can, however, cause interference with adjacent direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) systems.
