5|$|In the War of the Third Coalition, 1803–1806, an {{alliance}} of Austria, Portugal, Russia, and others fought the First French Empire and its client states. Although several naval battles determined control of the seas, {{the outcome of the}} war was determined on the continent, predominantly in two major land operations. In the Ulm campaign, Klenau's force achieved the single Austrian victory prior to the surrender of the Austrian army in Swabia. In the second determining event, the decisive French victory at the Battle of Austerlitz over the combined Russian and Austrian force forced a final capitulation of the Austrian forces and took the Habsburgs out of the Coalition. This did not establish a lasting peace on the continent. Prussian worries <b>about</b> <b>growing</b> French influence in Central Europe sparked the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806, in which Austria did not participate.|$|E

5|$|The second {{determining}} event, {{the decisive}} French {{victory at the}} Battle of Austerlitz over the combined Russian and Austrian armies, forced the Austrian withdrawal from the Coalition. The subsequent Peace of Pressburg, signed on 26 December 1805, reinforced the earlier treaties of Campo Formio and Lunéville. Furthermore, Austria ceded land to Napoleon's German allies, and paid an indemnity of 40million francs. Victory at Austerlitz also gave Napoleon the latitude to create a buffer zone of German states between France and the states of Prussia, Russia, and Austria. These measures did not establish a lasting peace on the continent. Prussian worries <b>about</b> <b>growing</b> French influence in Central Europe sparked the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806, in which Austria did not participate.|$|E
5|$|The Allied {{disaster}} significantly {{shook the}} faith of Emperor Francis in the British-led war effort. France and Austria agreed to an armistice immediately and the Treaty of Pressburg followed shortly after, on 26 December. Pressburg took Austria out of both {{the war and the}} Coalition while reinforcing the earlier treaties of Campo Formio and of Lunéville between the two powers. The treaty confirmed the Austrian loss of lands in Italy and Bavaria to France, and in Germany to Napoleon's German allies. It also imposed an indemnity of 40 million francs on the defeated Habsburgs and allowed the fleeing Russian troops free passage through hostile territories and back to their home soil. Critically, victory at Austerlitz permitted the creation of the Confederation of the Rhine, a collection of German states intended as a buffer zone between France and Central Europe. The Confederation rendered the Holy Roman Empire virtually useless, so the latter collapsed in 1806 after Francis abdicated the imperial throne, keeping FrancisI of Austria as his only official title. These achievements, however, did not establish a lasting peace on the continent. Prussian worries <b>about</b> <b>growing</b> French influence in Central Europe sparked the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806.|$|E

25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Evangelicals within the diocese were concerned <b>about</b> <b>growing</b> Anglo-Catholicism and Modernism within the church and fought very hard to preserve Sydney's Evangelical nature—especially as Tractarian clergy had started arriving from England in the 19th century.
