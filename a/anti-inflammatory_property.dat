Methods: Wistar male rats (150 - 200 gm) {{were divided}} into 7 groups- 3 standard groups, 3 test groups and 1 control group. Each group consists of six rats. A control group was treated with 0. 2 ml of normal saline, 3 standard groups were treated with different doses of Diclofenac (Standard drug) : 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 15 mg/kg body weight, respectively and 3 test groups were treated with different doses of Theophylline (Test drug) : 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg, respectively.
