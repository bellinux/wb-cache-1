5|$|On a Clear Night drew {{mixed reviews}} from critics both in Australia and abroad. More {{positive}} reviews compared Higgins to Sarah McLachlan and Alanis Morissette, and praised the album's maturity and <b>assertiveness</b> compared to The Sound of White. Less complimentary reviews said that On a Clear Night fails to lift Higgins above {{the level of}} her peers. Higgins was nominated for four awards at the 2007 ARIA Music Awards and won 'Best Female Artist'.|$|E
5|$|A {{collective}} {{leadership was}} founded immediately after Khrushchev's ouster, consisting of Brezhnev as First Secretary, Kosygin {{as head of}} government, and Anastas Mikoyan (and later Nikolai Podgorny) as head of state. From the beginning, Suslov was a vocal critic of one-man rule such as that seen under Joseph Stalin and Khrushchev. While he condemned Stalin's one-man rule, he equally criticised the individualistic <b>assertiveness</b> of Khrushchev's de-Stalinisation policy. A strong supporter of democratic centralism, Suslov prevented Brezhnev from taking over Kosygin's post as head of government in 1970. Kirilenko, Brezhnev, and Suslov were members of an unofficial Troika within the Communist Party leadership.|$|E
5|$|The RSK's {{response}} to the agreement ended Fischer's efforts. Moreover, Fischer, Zabala and Platzer were criticised by the UN, citing their excessive <b>assertiveness</b> in the matter. Fischer left Croatia, and Jordanian General Shabshough replaced Zabala in March. The Zagreb–Belgrade motorway was reopened in December 1994 through an agreement between {{the governments of the}} RSK and Croatia. However, a series of armed incidents in late April 1995 led to a Croatian military intervention and the capture of the portion of Sector West previously controlled by the RSK in Operation Flash in early May.|$|E
5|$|Emperor Gaozong {{supported}} settling a {{peace treaty}} with the Jurchens and sought {{to rein in the}} <b>assertiveness</b> of the military. The military expeditions of Yue Fei and other generals were an obstacle to peace negotiations. The government weakened the military by rewarding Yue Fei, Han Shizhong, and Zhang Jun (1086–1154) with titles that relieved them of their command over the Song armies. Han Shizhong, a critic of the treaty, retired. Yue Fei also announced his resignation as an act of protest. In 1141 Qin Hui had him imprisoned for insubordination. Charged with treason, Yue Fei was poisoned in jail on Qin's orders in early 1142. Jurchen diplomatic pressure during the peace talks may have played a role, but Qin Hui's alleged collusion with the Jin has never been proven.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{emergence}} of the Polish state, a series of rulers converted the population to Christianity, created a kingdom of Poland in 1025 and integrated Poland into the prevailing culture of Europe. Mieszko's son Bolesław I the Brave established a Roman Catholic Archdiocese in Gniezno, pursued territorial conquests and was officially crowned in 1025 as the first king of Poland. The first Piast monarchy collapsed with the death of Mieszko II Lambert in 1034, followed by its restoration under Casimir I in 1042. In the process, the royal dignity for Polish rulers was forfeited, and the state reverted to the status of a duchy. Duke Casimir's son Bolesław II the Bold revived the military <b>assertiveness</b> of Bolesław I, but became fatally involved in a conflict with Bishop Stanislaus of Szczepanów and was expelled from the country.|$|E
5|$|Less {{concrete}} changes {{include the}} growing <b>assertiveness</b> of the Dominions within the British Empire. Battles such as Gallipoli for Australia and New Zealand, and Vimy Ridge for Canada led to increased national pride {{and a greater}} reluctance to remain subordinate to London. These battles were often portrayed favourably in these nations' propaganda as symbolic of their power during the war. The war released pent-up indigenous nationalism, as populations tried {{to take advantage of}} the precedent set by the introduction of self-determination in eastern Europe. Britain was to face unrest in Ireland (1919–21), India (1919), Egypt (1919–23), Palestine (1920–21) and Iraq (1920) at a time when they were supposed to be demilitarising. Nevertheless, Britain's only territorial loss came in Ireland, where the delay in finding a resolution to the home rule issue, along with the 1916 Easter Rising and a failed attempt to introduce conscription in Ireland, increased support for separatist radicals, and led indirectly to the outbreak of the Irish War of Independence in 1919.|$|E
5|$|Social {{hierarchy}} {{in western}} jackdaw flocks {{is determined by}} supplanting, fighting, and threat displays—several {{of which have been}} described. In the bill-up posture, the western jackdaw tilts its bill and head upwards and sleeks its plumage. Indicating both appeasement and <b>assertiveness,</b> the posture is used by birds intending to enter feeding flocks. A bill-down posture is another commonly used agonistic behaviour. In this display, a bird lowers its bill and erects its nape and head feathers, and sometimes slightly lifts its wings. Western jackdaws often face off in this posture until one backs down or a fight ensues. In the forward-threat posture, a bird holds its body horizontally and thrusts its head forwards. In intense versions, the bird ruffles its feathers and spreads or raises its tail and wings. This extreme is seen when facing off over nests or females. In the defensive-threat posture, the bird lowers its head and bill, spreads its tail and ruffles its feathers. Supplanting is where one bird moves in and displaces another from a perch-site. The second bird usually retreats without resorting to a fight. Western jackdaws fight by launching themselves at each other feet-first and then wrestling with their feet intertwined and pecking at each other. Other individuals gather and call noisily.|$|E

25|$|Young {{children}} {{preparing to}} enter kindergarten {{need to develop}} the socially important skill of being assertive. Examples of <b>assertiveness</b> include asking others for information, initiating conversation, or being {{able to respond to}} peer pressure.|$|E
25|$|In addition, REBT is {{used with}} non-clinical {{problems}} {{and problems of}} living through counselling, consultation and coaching settings dealing with problems including relationships, social skills, career changes, stress management, <b>assertiveness</b> training, grief, problems with aging, money, weight control etc.|$|E
25|$|The second mode {{of therapy}} is skills training; a core {{component}} of DBT is learning new behavioral skills, including mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness (e.g. <b>assertiveness</b> and social skill), coping adaptively with distress and crises, and identifying and regulating emotional reactions.|$|E
25|$|Cultures {{in which}} the {{community}} is closed and based on agriculture (Kenya, India, etc.) experience lower social engagement than those in more open communities (United States, Okinawa, etc.) where interactions with peers is encouraged. Children in Mayan, Indian, Mexican, and Kenyan cultures are less expressive in social styles during interactions and they spend little time engaged in socio-dramatic activities. They are also less assertive in social situations. Self-expression and <b>assertiveness</b> in social interactions are related to shyness and inhibition in that when one is shy or inhibited one exhibits little or no expressive tendencies. <b>Assertiveness</b> is demonstrated in the same way, being shy and inhibited lessen one's chances of being assertive {{because of a lack}} of confidence.|$|E
25|$|Masculine (Fire and Air signs): The {{masculine}} {{signs are}} Aries, Gemini, Leo, Libra, Sagittarius, and Aquarius. A native with these signs predominating will tend towards extroversion, confidence and <b>assertiveness,</b> {{and have the}} ability to solve problems with courage and enterprise.|$|E
25|$|Traits {{traditionally}} {{cited as}} masculine include courage, independence and <b>assertiveness.</b> These traits vary by location and context, and {{are influenced by}} social and cultural factors. An overemphasis on masculinity and power, often associated with a disregard for consequences and responsibility, is known as machismo.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to individual psychotherapy, both group psychotherapy and self-help, or support groups, {{can be an}} effective line of treatment for dysthymia as well. Through these treatment modalities, issues such as self-esteem, self-confidence, relationship issues/patterns, <b>assertiveness</b> skills, cognitive restructuring, etc., can be worked through and strengthened.|$|E
25|$|Fired: Ruth, for lacking <b>assertiveness</b> {{within her}} team {{that could have}} changed the task's outcome, and only showing it at the most {{inappropriate}} moment: during the team's pitch itself. Bill also emphasised disappointment in the assertive issue {{as a result of}} Ruth's work background requiring those character traits.|$|E
25|$|There are {{positive}} correlations between positive orgasm experience in women and testosterone levels where relaxation {{was a key}} perception of the experience. There is no correlation between testosterone and men's perceptions of their orgasm experience, and also no correlation between higher testosterone levels and greater sexual <b>assertiveness</b> in either sex.|$|E
25|$|Many lower-order factors, or facets, {{are similar}} {{between the two}} taxonomies. For instance, both {{approaches}} contain factors for sociability/gregariousness, for activity levels, and for <b>assertiveness</b> within the higher order factor extraversion. However, there are differences too. First, the three-factor approach contains nine lower-order factors and the five-factor approach has six.|$|E
25|$|Boldness. Low fear {{including}} stress-tolerance, toleration of unfamiliarity and danger, {{and high}} self-confidence and social <b>assertiveness.</b> The PCL-R measures this relatively poorly and mainly through Facet 1 of Factor 1. Similar to PPI Fearless dominance. May correspond {{to differences in}} the amygdala and other neurological systems associated with fear. Psychopaths tend to have reduced fear.|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies have}} {{suggested}} social skills training (SST) can help with social anxiety. Examples of social skills focused on during SST for social anxiety disorder include: initiating conversations, establishing friendships, interacting {{with members of the}} preferred sex, constructing a speech and <b>assertiveness</b> skills. However, {{it is not clear whether}} specific social skills techniques and training are required, rather than just support with general social functioning and exposure to social situations.|$|E
25|$|On 23 October 2006, a Toronto Star {{column by}} Carol Goar said DiNovo {{had brought a}} new clarity and <b>assertiveness</b> to the NDP caucus' voice in the Ontario Legislative Assembly. Since {{entering}} the Assembly, DiNovo has approached a variety of poverty-related issues, including raising minimum wage and welfare rates in the province, creating more affordable housing and ending the government's tax clawback of the federal child benefit supplement.|$|E
25|$|From this view, {{rather than}} {{concepts}} such as <b>assertiveness,</b> aggression, violence and criminal violence existing as distinct constructs, they exist instead along a continuum with moderate levels of aggression being most adaptive. Such scholars do not consider this a trivial difference, noting that many traditional researchers' aggression measurements may measure outcomes lower down in the continuum, at levels which are adaptive, yet they generalize their findings to non-adaptive levels of aggression, thus losing precision.|$|E
25|$|In {{reaction}} to events in Quebec and formal {{demands of the}} Lesage government, Lester Pearson's ruling Liberal government in Ottawa sought to address the new political <b>assertiveness</b> of Quebec. He commissioned the Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism in 1963. Pearson also recruited Pierre Trudeau, who campaigned against the violation of civil liberties under Duplessis and {{the economic and political}} marginalization of French Quebecers in the 1950s. Trudeau saw official bilingualism in Canada as the best way of remedying this.|$|E
25|$|There {{were several}} {{prevailing}} {{social and political}} conditions in the 1980s which prompted {{the introduction of the}} bill. These were detailed in the Maintenance of Religious Harmony white paper. First, there had been an increase in religious fervour and <b>assertiveness</b> among religious groups, which was part of a worldwide religious revival. This had led to an increase in inter-religious tensions. Secondly, intra-religious tensions had also been observed. Thirdly, several incidents had taken place suggesting that religious groups and leaders were entering the realm of politics.|$|E
25|$|In the Italian culture {{emotional}} expressiveness during interpersonal {{interaction is}} encouraged. From {{a young age}} children engage in debates or discussions that encourage and strengthen social <b>assertiveness.</b> Independence and social competence during childhood is also promoted. Being inhibited is looked down upon and those who show this characteristic are viewed negatively by their parents and peers. Like other cultures where shyness and inhibition is viewed negatively, peers of shy and inhibited Italian children reject the socially fearful, cautious and withdrawn. These withdrawn and socially fearful children express loneliness and believe themselves to be lacking the social skills needed in social interactions.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{expedition}} to Korea in 1871, {{also known as}} Sinmiyangyo (Western Disturbance of the Year Sinmi year), was the first American military action in Korea. It took place predominantly on and around the Korean island of Ganghwa. The reason {{for the presence of}} the American military expeditionary force in Korea was to support an American diplomatic delegation sent to establish trade and diplomatic relations with Korea and to ascertain the fate of the General Sherman merchant ship. The isolationist nature of the Joseon Dynasty government and the <b>assertiveness</b> of the Americans led to an armed conflict between the two parties. Eventually, the United States failed to secure its objectives.|$|E
25|$|In 2013, Dawn {{reported}} that, although Khan had no post in PML-N, he {{was known}} for his <b>assertiveness</b> in the party’s affairs and had had differences with other PML-N leaders. Reportedly, before the 2013 election, Khan lobbied to become the Chief Minister of Punjab, Pakistan, and proposed that Shehbaz Sharif be made Minister for Water and Power, but Nawaz Sharif did not give the party ticket to Khan for the provincial seat. In spite of that, Khan contested the election for provincial assembly seat as an independent candidate and won. Dawn reported that Khan was once considered the de facto chief minister of Punjab.|$|E
25|$|The face {{of urban}} Auckland changed when the government's {{immigration}} policy began allowing immigrants from Asia in 1986. According to the 1961 census data, Māori and Pacific Islanders comprised 5 per cent of Auckland's population; Asians less than 1 per cent. By 2006 the Asian population had reached 18.0 per cent in Auckland, and 36.2 per cent {{in the central}} city. New arrivals from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea gave a distinctive character to the areas where they clustered, while a range of other immigrants introduced mosques, Hindu temples, halal butchers and ethnic restaurants to the suburbs. The <b>assertiveness</b> of Pacific Island street culture and the increasing political influence of ethnic groups contributes to the city's multicultural vitality.|$|E
25|$|Macdonald left in August 1900 {{to take up}} {{the command}} of the fourth Balloon section with the British {{imperial}} troops fighting the Boxer Rebellion in China. He was then appointed Director of Railways for the China expeditionary force. The fighting in China was the result of growing <b>assertiveness</b> by European powers in China over trade, religion and control of territory during the dying days of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, aggravated by poverty due to harvest failures. A widespread popular uprising led to a siege of Europeans in Beijing. The European colonial powers cooperated in military action to suppress the uprising and imposed harsh indemnities and conditions. From China, Macdonald was posted to Mauritius as general officer commanding later in 1900.|$|E
25|$|The {{wealth of}} Upper Peru and its {{remoteness}} from Lima convinced {{the authorities to}} create a new audiencia in the city of Chuquisaca (present-day Sucre) in 1558. Chuquisaca had become particularly important as Potosí's administrative and agricultural supply center. The jurisdiction of the audiencia, known as Charcas, initially covered a radius of 100 leagues (1,796km²) around Chuquisaca, but it soon included Santa Cruz and territory belonging to present-day Paraguay and, until 1568, also the entire district of Cuzco. The president of the audiencia had judicial authority as well as administrative and executive powers in the region, but only in routine matters; more important decisions were made in Lima. This situation led to a competitive attitude and the reputation of Upper Peru for <b>assertiveness,</b> a condition reinforced by the economic importance of the region.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{data used}} by {{the government for the}} definition of the Maratha-Kunbi castes puts them between 30% and 40%, depending on whether a narrow or an inclusive definition of the caste is used. This causes the percentage of OBCs to vary between 29% and 38% of the population. According to Hansen, it is critically important for the politicians of the state to ensure a narrow definition of OBC and maximise the Maratha representation. The Maratha Mahasangha (All-Maratha Federation), fearing that the Mandal Commission would divide the Maratha-Kunbis into Kunbis and high Marathas, took an anti-Mandal stance and tried to attract marginalised Maratha-Kunbis by propagating martial and chauvinistic myths, which in turn stigmatized Muslims and Dalits. While the organization never received success outside of Mumbai, it showed that political leaders were willing to counter the rising OBC <b>assertiveness.</b>|$|E
25|$|Problems in {{developing}} social skills, or 'social fluency', {{may be a}} cause of some social anxiety disorder, through either inability or lack of confidence to interact socially and gain positive reactions and acceptance from others. The studies have been mixed, however, with some studies not finding significant problems in social skills while others have. What does seem clear is that the socially anxious perceive their own social skills to be low. It {{may be that the}} increasing need for sophisticated social skills in forming relationships or careers, and an emphasis on <b>assertiveness</b> and competitiveness, is making social anxiety problems more common, at least among the 'middle classes'. An interpersonal or media emphasis on 'normal' or 'attractive' personal characteristics has also been argued to fuel perfectionism and feelings of inferiority or insecurity regarding negative evaluation from others. The need for social acceptance or social standing has been elaborated in other lines of research relating to social anxiety.|$|E
25|$|Causes for {{the high}} female {{dismissal}} rate were studied at Jimma University. Students re-admitted in 2007-08 and staff completed questionnaires and took part in focus groups. Only 37% of female students had been taught by female teachers. The advantages of having female teachers were that female teachers were better than male teachers at understanding their problems, they could share their experiences of the challenges they had to overcome, they could discuss their problems freely and find solutions. In class, female students felt free to ask and answer questions and female teachers showed them {{that it was possible}} for them to attain higher levels if they worked hard like men. Only 27% of female students had received <b>assertiveness</b> training. However, female students had received informal orientation advice from senior female students in their first year. Lack of <b>assertiveness</b> training encourages female students to feel inferior about their abilities and to lack confidence in speaking up when conflict arises. This contributes to low achievement, dismissal and dropping out. Feelings of powerlessness make them dependent on others such as male students. Some students (46%) had not chosen their university and 74.1% had not chosen their department. The former increased homesickness when they were too far away to visit their parents, and the latter reduced interest in the university and in attending lessons. There was a guidance and counseling service but only 22% of students were aware of its existence and none had attended. Poor time management could be another reason for dropping out. When female students first arrived, their time was wasted by male students repeatedly trying to start love affairs. If a love affair did start, it was the man who decided when they would meet so interrupting the woman's studies. The women agreed with the man's decisions to maintain the relationship and avoid losing the academic benefits the relationship provided. Many students were from poor families and could not afford necessities for education and university life. They might try to resolve their economic difficulties through high risk sexual activity. There was widespread sexual harassment and discrimination from male students and, sometimes, male teachers. Both consensual and non-consensual sex could result in HIV, pregnancy and drop out.|$|E
