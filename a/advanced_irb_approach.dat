40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{question}} whether the risk weights in the <b>advanced</b> (<b>IRB)</b> <b>approach</b> of the Basel 2 regulation are appropriate, on a strictly theoretical ground. The major {{concern is that the}} model behind the regulation considers defaults only {{at the end of the}} time horizon for which capital is to be held - whereas defaults in the whole time interval should be taken into consideration. This latter approach is represented by a model that is different from the Basel model. It follows, as I show, that the Basel model should be viewed just as a technical tool to turn the expected value of the unconditional loss distribution into a given percentile of the same distribution - making use of conditional (on the systemic factor) default probabilities - and should not be interpreted as describing even 'virtual' firms and asset values. More importantly, I also show that a logical step in the theoretical foundation of the model is missing which raises the {{question whether the}} risk weights calculated with the model are indeed appropriate. Due to difficulties in the calculation in the alternative approach of the percentiles of the loss distribution no clean-cut answer is given in this paper. ...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to propose a {{methodology}} to estimate loss given default (LGD) and apply it to a set of micro-data of loans to SME and corporations of an anonymous commercial bank from Central Europe. LGD estimates are important inputs in the pricing of credit risk and the measurement of bank profitability and solvency. Basel II <b>Advance</b> <b>IRB</b> <b>Approach</b> requires internally estimates of LGD to calculate risk-weighted assets and to estimate expected loss. We analyse the recovery rate dynamically over time and identify the efficient recovery period of a workout department. Moreover, we focus on the appropriate choice of a discount factor by introducing risk premium based on a risk level of collaterals. We apply statistical methods to estimate LGD and test empirically its determinants. Particularly, we analyse generalised linear models using symmetric logit and asymmetric log-log link functions for ordinal responses as well as for fractional responses. For fractional responses we employ two alternatives, a beta inflated distribution and a quasi-maximum likelihood estimator. We find out that the main drivers of LGD are a relative value of collateral, a loan size as well as a year of the loan origination. Different models provided similar results. As for the different links in more complex models, log-log models in some cases perform better, implying an asymmetric response of the dependent variable. credit risk, bank loan, loss given default, LGD, recovery rate, fractional responses, ordinal regression, quasi-maximum likelihood estimator...|$|R

For example, banks using either of the proposed Internal Ratings Based (IRB) approaches will face incentives to construct loan portfolios that generate large losses should a bank default. Such incentives are at odds with the objective of least cost resolution mandated in FDICIA.

We find, for all the countries, banks will have significant benefits, in terms of lower capital requirements, when considering small and medium sized firms as retail customers. But they will be obliged to use the <b>Advanced</b> <b>IRB</b> <b>approach</b> (providing their own estimates of probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD) for each counterparty) and to manage them on a pooled basis.

Moreover, we show that the percentage of SMEs to be classified as retail increases to at least 40 % if banks will want to enjoy lower capital requirements by implementing the Advanced IRB instead of the Standardized approach. Since one of the main goals of the new Basel Capital Accord is to improve the efficiency of banks risk management systems, we conclude that a likely impact will be an additional motivation for banks to consider and manage their SMEs clients as retail customers. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{outlines}} how {{proposed changes}} to international capital adequacy standards – {{commonly referred to}} as “Basel II” – will reinforce financial stability. Basel II is designed to contribute to the prevention of individual bank failures by making minimum capital standards more flexible and aligning them more closely with actual risks and changes in the level of risk. By bringing regulatory capital closer to the concept of economic capital that banks use in their internal management, and by going to the core of banks’ financial information systems, the proposed changes will foster better control of risks. By reducing credit disruptions, the changes should help to limit the severity of macro-economic and sectoral downturns and thereby improve financial stability. Concerns have been expressed about the potential “procyclicality” of the new standards, and the possibility of sharp swings in regulatory capital requirements leading to dramatic shifts in the availability of credit. These concerns, while theoretically appealing, do not appear warranted in practice. The Basel Committee took steps early on to ensure that cyclical effects would be moderated, while still achieving the goal of making capital ratios more risk-sensitive, more closely related to the bank’s management of its “risk-return” tradeoff, and therefore more useful as an internal control tool. In contrast with Basel I, which is external to banks’ methods of management, Basel II incorporates an <b>advanced</b> <b>IRB</b> <b>approach.</b> It can therefore figure as a central element in banks’ strategic planning. The success of the proposed changes will depend on how they are applied by bank managers and on the vigilance of bank supervisors in overseeing their implementation. Numerous contacts and on-site examinations carried out to date are encouraging in this regard. A hoped-for reform in the rules on provisioning, consistent with the new capital standard – factoring in ex ante the impact of expected but unrealized credit losses over the credit cycle instead of concentrating them at the lowest point of the cycle – would contribute significantly to financial stability. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Basel II {{internal}} ratings-based (<b>IRB)</b> <b>approach</b> {{to capital}} adequacy for credit risk {{plays an important}} role in protecting the Australian banking sector against insolvency. We outline the mathematical foundations of regulatory capital modelling for credit risk, and extend the model specification of the <b>IRB</b> <b>approach</b> to a more general setting than the usual Gaussian case. It rests on the proposition that quantiles of the distribution of conditional expectation of portfolio percentage loss may be substituted for quantiles of the portfolio loss distribution. We present a more compact proof of this proposition under weaker assumptions. The <b>IRB</b> <b>approach</b> implements the so-called asymptotic single risk factor (ASRF) model, an asset value factor model of credit risk. The robustness of the model specification of the <b>IRB</b> <b>approach</b> to a relaxation in model assumptions is evaluated on a portfolio that is representative of the credit exposures of the Australian banking sector. We measure the rate of convergence, in terms of number of obligors, of empirical loss distributions to the asymptotic (infinitely fine-grained) portfolio loss distribution; and we evaluate the sensitivity of credit risk capital to dependence structure as modelled by asset correlations and elliptical copulas. A separate time series analysis takes measurements from the ASRF model of the prevailing state of Australia's economy and the level of capitalisation of its banking sector. These readings find general agreement with macroeconomic indicators, financial statistics and external credit ratings.
