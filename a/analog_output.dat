The microphone system employs an array of resonant gate transistors (RGT) to transduce acoustic input directly into bandpass filtered <b>analog</b> <b>outputs.</b> The bandpass filtered <b>analog</b> <b>outputs</b> are encoded as spike time events by a spike event coder and are then transmitted asynchronously by using the Address Event Representation (AER) protocol.
