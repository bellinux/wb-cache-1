40|$|Abstract — The Internet {{has taken}} its place beside the {{telephone}} and the television as <b>an</b> <b>major</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> people's day-to-day lives. Consumers rely on online shopping and banking. Most online shoppers use credit cards {{to pay for their}} purchases. As credit card becomes the most popular mode of payment, cases of fraud associated with it are also increasing. In this paper, we model the sequence of operations in credit card transaction processing using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and show how it can be used for the detection of frauds. An HMM is trained with normal behavior of cardholder. If an incoming credit card transaction is not accepted by the HMM with sufficiently high probability, it is considered to be fraudulent. We present detailed experimental results to show the effectiveness of our approach. Keywords—Internet,online shopping,credit card,e-commerc...|$|R
