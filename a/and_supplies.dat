Our research agenda focuses on the challenges in combining sourcing <b>and</b> <b>supply</b> chain management perspectives. The tentative research perspectives in our research agenda include the following: the management system for global purchasing <b>and</b> <b>supply</b> management, evolution of purchasing <b>and</b> <b>supply</b> management, purchasing <b>and</b> <b>supply</b> management capabilities in a globally operating firm, and attractivity of the buying firm towards desired suppliers...|$|R

40|$|This is the {{ground-breaking}} {{new book}} for aspiring purchasing <b>and</b> <b>supply</b> chain leaders <b>and</b> {{anyone with a}} keen interest in this rapidly evolving field. For too long business has focused on short-term cost advantages through low-cost country sourcing with little regard for the longer-term implications of global sustainability. As the first book to fully address the environmental, social and economic challenges of how companies manage purchasing <b>and</b> <b>supply</b> chains, it aims to inspire the development of current and future purchasing <b>and</b> <b>supply</b> chain leaders. In addition to explaining the basic principles and processes of both purchasing <b>and</b> <b>supply</b> chain management, the book evaluates how to develop strategic and sustainable purchasing <b>and</b> <b>supply</b> chain management. A key message is that purchasing <b>and</b> <b>supply</b> chain management needs to focus on value creation rather than cost cutting. This requires the development of completely new purchasing <b>and</b> <b>supply</b> chain models that involve closed-loop supply structures, <b>supply</b> chain transparency <b>and</b> collaboration with new stakeholders in traditional sourcing <b>and</b> <b>supply</b> chain processes. Aimed at students, educators and practitioners the book integrates sustainability into each chapter as a core element of purchasing <b>and</b> <b>supply</b> chain management. Incorporating case studies from industry into each chapter, the book strikes a balance between theoretical frameworks and guidelines for implementation in practice...|$|R

5|$|Italy's {{position}} in {{the centre of the}} Mediterranean made it unacceptably hazardous to send ships from Britain to Egypt via that route, so British reinforcements <b>and</b> <b>supplies</b> for the area had to travel around the Cape of Good Hope. For this reason, it was more convenient to reinforce General Sir Archibald Wavell's Middle East Command with troops from Australia, New Zealand and India. Nonetheless, even when Britain was threatened with invasion after the Battle of France and equipment was urgently required to re-equip the British Expeditionary Force after its losses in the Dunkirk evacuation, troops <b>and</b> <b>supplies</b> were still despatched to the Middle East Command. A convoy that departed the United Kingdom in August 1940 brought guns, stores, ammunition, and three armoured regiments, including the 7th Royal Tank Regiment, equipped with Matilda II tanks.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to discuss the existing sectoral and economy wide logistics <b>and</b> <b>supply</b> chain models (mathematical and computational methods), which can be used for the formulation of logistics <b>and</b> <b>supply</b> chain systems <b>and</b> policies. Mathematical models are important tools in a holistic representation of the important components of a logistics <b>and</b> <b>supply</b> chain system <b>and</b> in formulating logistics <b>and</b> <b>supply</b> chain policies to address the underlying issues and choices. Therefore, to examine the issues surrounding a logistics <b>and</b> <b>supply</b> chain system, an understanding the integrated mathematical models of the system can be very useful. These models include sectoral logistics <b>and</b> <b>supply</b> chain models <b>and</b> economy wide models such as general equilibrium models, inputoutput analysis, and optimal control models, among others. Since a critical discussion of the modelling and computational methods in integrated economic <b>and</b> logistics <b>and</b> <b>supply</b> chain systems is lacking in the existing literature, this paper makes an important contribution to the literature...|$|R
