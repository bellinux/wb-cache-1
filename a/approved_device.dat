30|$|Septic hyperresistinemia {{strongly}} {{correlates with}} inhibition of neutrophil migration in vitro. Hyperresistinemia itself reversibly impairs neutrophil intracellular bacterial clearance and ROS generation. Hemoadsorption therapy with a clinically <b>approved</b> <b>device</b> corrects hyperresistinemia and neutrophil dysfunction. It may therefore provide a therapeutic option to improve neutrophil function during septic hyperresistinemia and ultimately alleviate immunosuppression in this disease state.|$|E

30|$|Hemoadsorption {{therapy with}} a {{clinically}} <b>approved</b> <b>device</b> (CytoSorb™) removes cytokines (interleukin- 6, interleukin- 10, and tumor necrosis factor, amongst others) and improves short-term survival in a rat model of endotoxemia [47, 48] [1, 3, 4]. Case studies {{in patients with}} septic shock have corroborated these findings [49]. Moreover, recent studies indicate a role for hemoadsorption therapy that go beyond removal of common sepsis mediators [50]. In particular, improvement in neutrophil recruitment and bacterial clearance as well as reduced remote organ damage, e.g., secondary acute respiratory distress syndrome, all appear to contribute to improved survival following treatment with CytoSorb™ cartridges during experimental sepsis [51]. Treatment effects of hemoadsorption with CytoSorb™ cartridges are therefore consistent with {{a growing body of}} evidence that supports the concept of immune system incompetence as a driving factor in sepsis morbidity and mortality [1, 52].|$|E
40|$|Test {{weight is}} a {{fundamental}} measurement thatcurrently determines the official market grade ofwheat. If the test weight of wheat is lower than theusual standard (U. S. Grade No. 2), the grower typically will receive a reduced price. This is because approximately 40 % of U. S. soft wheat is exported and foreign buyers often specify U. S. Grade No. 2. Discounts for low test weight wheat are responsible for {{millions of dollars of}} losses annually for growers in the Eastern soft wheat region (Frahm, 1994). Test weight is defined by the USDA FGIS (1997) as “Test weight per bushel, The weight per Winchester bushel (2, 150. 42 in. 3) as determined using an <b>approved</b> <b>device</b> according to procedures prescribed by FGIS instructions”.

40|$|Radiofrequency {{machines}} {{for medical use}} are known to produce moderate clinical improvement of skin laxity without invasive procedures. Numerous equipment with different characteristics have been proposed after the introduction in 2002 of the first FDA <b>approved</b> <b>device.</b> This report is aimed to test if RF treatment is effective when performed at low frequency and low energy level. Two RF treatments were performed unilaterally 7 and 2 days before a planned eyebrow lifting surgery, with a radiofrequency device with 0. 52 to 0. 7 MHz frequencies, maximum energy of 200 W, used at 40 % of its power. A bipolar handpiece with a diameter of 30 mm and a maximum power of 9 - 9. 5 W was massaged along the temporal area for 10 min. Skin samples of treated and untreated sides were collected during surgery and processed for histologic examination and RT-PCR analysis, to test differences in gene activation in a panel of proteins that are relevant in extracellular matrix of dermal connective tissue. The histological examination of the samples showed that the treatment induced a loss of the typical oriented structure in the reticular dermis. The study through RT-PCR evidenced that ELN, the gene codifying for Elastine was strongly enhanced. Some collagen-tested genes (COL 1 A 1, COL 3 A 1 and COL 9 A 1) were inhibited by the treatment, whereas COL 2 A 1 and COL 11 were activated. The genes responsible for Metallo-proteases (MMP) 2, 3 and 13 were depressed, while the MMP 9 was stimulated. Gene codifying for Hyaluronic synthase 1 (HAS 1), Hyluronidase 1 (HYAL 1), Neutrophyl elastase (Elane), Desmoplakin (DSP) and GDF 6 were inhibited. Insulin like growth factor (IGF 1) gene activity was enhanced. RF treatment, with the tested non-ablative equipment, produced histological effects and change in DNA expression of some extracellular matrix related genes, confirming the biostimulatory role of this procedure...|$|E
40|$|Epilepsy is a {{spectrum}} of diseases characterized by recurrent seizures. It is estimated that 50 million individuals worldwide are affected and 30 % of cases are medically refractory or drug resistant. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS) are the only FDA <b>approved</b> <b>device</b> based therapies. Neither therapy offers complete seizure freedom in a majority of users. Novel methodologies are needed to better understand mechanisms and chronic nature of epilepsy. Most tools for neuromodulation in rodents are tethered. The few wireless devices use batteries or are inductively powered. The tether restricts movement, limits behavioral tests, and {{increases the risk of}} infection. Batteries are large and heavy with a limited lifetime. Inductive powering suffers from rapid efficiency drops due to alignment mismatches and increased distances. Miniature wireless tools that offer behavioral freedom, data acquisition, and stimulation are needed. This dissertation presents a platform of electrical, optical and radiofrequency (RF) technologies for device based neuromodulation. The platform can be configured with features including: two channels differential recording, one channel electrical stimulation, and one channel optical stimulation. Typical device operation consumes less than 4 mW. The analog front end has a bandwidth of 0. 7 Hz - 1 kHz and a gain of 60 dB, and the constant current driver provides biphasic electrical stimulation. For use with optogenetics, the deep brain optical stimulation module provides 27 mW/mm 2 of blue light (473 nm) with 21. 01 mA. Pairing of stimulating and recording technologies allows closed-loop operation. A wireless powering cage is designed using the resonantly coupled filter energy transfer (RCFET) methodology. RF energy is coupled through magnetic resonance. The cage has a PTE ranging from 1. 8 - 6. 28 % for a volume of 11 x 11 x 11 in 3. This is sufficient to chronically house subjects. The technologies are validated through various in vivo preparations. The tools are designed to study epilepsy, SUDEP, and urinary incontinence but can be configured for other studies. The broad application of these technologies can enable the scientific community to better study chronic diseases and closed-loop therapies...|$|E
40|$|The global {{medical device}} {{industry}} has dramatically ex-panded {{in the past}} 5 years, with the market expected to be valued at more than $ 228 billion by 2015 as medical devices increase in number, use, and complexity (1). High-risk (class III) devices (those that “support or sustain hu-man life ” [2]) are generally approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) via a pathway known as “pre-market approval ” (PMA), which uses criteria of safety and effectiveness. However, modifications of PMA devices may be approved by a less rigorous procedure known as “PMA supplement, ” which has substantially fewer evidence re-quirements than an original PMA. Recent events have raised safety concerns for this alternate pathway, and un-derstanding these implications is important for clinicians and policymakers. A PMA supplement is required for a “change affecting the safety or effectiveness of the device for which the ap-plicant has an approved PMA ” (3). Device manufacturers may frequently have improvements or minor changes to approved devices, and PMA supplements allow iterative changes without the need {{to go through the}} rigorous PMA process. The need for rapid approval of design improve-ments to marketed devices must be weighed against the possibility of introducing unknown risks to patient health from such modifications, especially because devices often have multiple supplements. In one recent tragic example, the Sprint Fidelis defibrillator lead (Medtronic, Minneap-olis, Minnesota) was recalled after 665 failures and 5 deaths (4). The Fidelis lead had undergone successive changes to the original <b>approved</b> <b>device</b> via several PMA supplements, none of which required clinical data. Because of the cumulative modifications, the devices ultimately marketed as the Fidelis differed substantially from the one originally studied in clinical trials before the PMA supple-ments. Implantations of the Fidelis lead—the safety and efficacy of which were never shown through clinical trials—exploded to 268 000 worldwide until the device was recalled in 2007 because of increased risk for life-threatening lead fractures (5). To this day, caring for more than 150 000 Americans with this lead remains a clinical challenge (6). In a similar heartrending example, from 2002 to 2006...|$|E
