5|$|After {{many years}} of ambitious and {{successful}} free-lance acting, Bosse found her options narrowing in the 1930s. The Great Depression brought her economic hardship, <b>and,</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> looked younger than her age, most important women's roles were out of her age range. Her technique was still often praised, but also sometimes perceived as old-fashioned and mannered, {{in comparison with the}} more ensemble-oriented style of the times. Finding herself unneeded by any Swedish repertory theatre, she only managed to return as a member of Dramaten by means of skillful persuasion and pointed reminders of her long history there. A humble employee at a humble salary, she played only fifteen roles, all minor, during her last ten years at Dramaten, 1933–43.|$|E

Lemmon noted that the book's [...] "subtle, lyrical writing" [...] brings the reader into the characters' minds, which [...] "is an enlivening but uncomfortable place to be". In a review of Gordimer's 1980 story collection, A Soldier's Embrace in The New York Times Book Review, American novelist and critic A. G. Mojtabai stated that despite the troubled times Gordimer lived through {{at the time she}} wrote Burger's Daughter, she remained [...] "subdued" [...] and [...] "sober", <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> [...] "scarcely raise her voice", it still [...] "reverberate over a full range of emotion".|$|E

500|$|Although Caged Bird was {{refreshing}} in its honesty, something {{its readers}} and reviewers value, Angelou's honesty in Gather Together had become, as reviewer John McWhorter perceives it, [...] "more and more formulaic". McWhorter {{asserts that the}} events that Angelou describes in Gather Together and in her subsequent autobiographies require more explanation, which she does not provide, although she expects her readers to accept them on face value. In Gather Together, for example, Angelou insists {{that she is not}} religious, but she refuses welfare, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> was afraid of becoming a lesbian in Caged Bird and presents herself as shy, awkward, and bookish, she pimps for a lesbian couple and becomes a prostitute herself. McWhorter criticizes Angelou for her decisions in Gather Together, and for not explaining them fully, and states, [...] "The people in these flamboyant tales—the narrator included—have a pulp-novel incoherence".|$|E

Hubbell, on the other hand, is exhausted, unable to live on the pedestal Katie erected for him and face her disappointment in his decision to compromise his potential.|$|E

I know the audience loved Michelle Fowler so much, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> hasn’t been on our screen for 20 years, she’s very much in the fans’ psyche.

[...] Executive producer Sean O'Connor said he is [...] "thrilled to have secured Jenna Russell to play Michelle Fowler, one of the show’s most celebrated characters" [...] and [...] "the Square really has missed her over the past twenty years." [...] O'Connor added, [...] "Jenna was always in mind when I [...] first started planning for Michelle’s return". O'Connor also said Michelle is [...] "still flawed, complicated and infuriating after two decades away, but still loveable all the same.

Leonard, though, is buoyed by optimism over Penny's admission. Alex Jensen asks Leonard out to dinner in [...] "The Egg Salad Equivalency", which boosts Leonard's ego because two beautiful women are interested in him, however, Alex's interest makes Penny insecure. After another dispute with Sheldon, Leonard tries to move in with Penny in [...] "The Spoiler Alert Segmentation", however she is not ready. During their Valentine's Day dinner in [...] "The Tangible Affection Proof", Leonard again tries to propose to Penny and she cuts him off quickly. She admits that she is very happy with him, but she also admits to commitment issues and the thought of being married forever really [...] "freaks" [...] her out. Leonard then tells her that when she is ready to get married, she can propose to him. In the season finale, Leonard leaves for an overseas job for four months and Penny is confident enough in their relationship to wait for him. [...] In [...] "The Gorilla Dissolution", Leonard and Penny become engaged. Throughout season 8, a running gag is their reluctance to decide upon a wedding date. In the season 8 finale, Penny asks Leonard to marry her that night in Las Vegas. Leonard happily accepts, but during the journey, after Penny expresses happiness that they will get married while knowing everything about each other, Leonard confesses to having shared a drunken kiss with another woman while on the boat in Europe, though he adds that the woman started it and he rejected her. Penny becomes hurt by the revelation, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> claims to forgive Leonard, there is clearly tension between them, leaving the season ending in a cliffhanger {{as to whether or not}} they will go through with the wedding.|$|E

60|$|He rode {{for a while}} bareheaded, {{with the}} water {{trickling}} over him. Though he was physically very weary, the lassitude and dejection melted out of him. There {{was no longer a}} tension in the atmosphere, and he was an optimist again, vaguely thankful for the things he had and the strength to grapple with those against him. With that, a great tenderness towards his wife swept over him like a wave, and he remembered, not her scorn and bitter words, but that there was so much she must miss at Prospect. He had left her alone, neglected, while he thought only of his work, <b>and,</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> cared nothing for him, he might in many ways have made her life pleasanter. He could, he reflected, do it yet, for ruin seemed remote, now the wheat was saved.

6000|$|Recovery {{is often}} more trying than illness, and Rachel {{suffered}} greatly. Indeed, she was not sure that she ought to have recovered at all, and perhaps the shock to her nerves and spirits was more serious than {{the effect of the}} sharp passing disorder, which had, however, so much weakened her that she succumbed entirely to the blow. [...] "Accountable for all," [...] the words still rang in her ears, and the all for which she was accountable continually magnified itself. She had tied a dreadful knot, which Fanny, meek contemned Fanny had cut, but at the cost of grievous suffering and danger to her boys, and too late to prevent that death which continually haunted Rachel; those looks of convulsive agony came before her in all her waking and sleeping intervals. Nothing put them aside, occupation in her weakness only bewildered and distracted her, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> was advancing daily towards convalescence, leaving her room, and being again restored to her sister, she still continued listless, dejected, cast down, and unable to turn her mind from this one dreary contemplation. Of Fanny and her sons it was hardly possible to think, and one of the strange perturbations of the mind in illness caused her to dwell far less on them than on the minor misery of the fate of the title-deeds of the Burnaby Bargain, which she had put into Mauleverer's hand. She fancied their falling into the hands of some speculator, who, if he did not break the mother's heart by putting up a gasometer, would certainly wring it by building hideous cottages, or desirable marine residences. The value would be enhanced so as to be equal to more than half that of the Homestead, the poor would have been cheated of it, and what compensation could be made? Give up all her own share? Nay, she had nothing absolutely her own while her mother lived, only £5,000 was settled on her if she married, and she tortured herself with devising plans that she knew to be impracticable, of stripping herself, and going forth to suffer the poverty she merited. Yes, but how would she have lived? Not like the Williamses! She had tried teaching like the one, and writing like the other, but had failed in both. The Clever Woman had no marketable or available talent. She knew very well that nothing would induce her mother and sister to let her despoil herself, but to have injured them would be even more intolerable; and more than all was the sickening uncertainty, whether any harm had been done, or what would be its extent.|$|E
60|$|I {{lingered in}} the sala when I went to and fro; I used to watch--as long as I thought decent--the door that led to Miss Bordereau's part of the house. A person observing me might have {{supposed}} I was trying to cast a spell upon it or attempting some odd experiment in hypnotism. But I was only praying it would open or thinking what treasure probably lurked behind it. I hold it singular, as I look back, that I should never have doubted {{for a moment that}} the sacred relics were there; never have failed to feel a certain joy at being under the same roof with them. After all they were under my hand--they had not escaped me yet; and they made my life continuous, in a fashion, with the illustrious life they had touched at the other end. I lost myself in this satisfaction to the point of assuming--in my quiet extravagance--that poor Miss Tita also went back, went back, as I used to phrase it. She did indeed, the gentle spinster, but not quite so far as Jeffrey Aspern, who was simply hearsay to her, quite as he was to me. Only she had lived for years with Juliana, she had seen and handled the papers <b>and</b> (<b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>she</b> was stupid) some esoteric knowledge had rubbed off on her. That was what the old woman represented--esoteric knowledge; and this was the idea with which my editorial heart used to thrill. It literally beat faster often, of an evening, when I had been out, as I stopped with my candle in the re-echoing hall on my way up to bed. It was as if at such a moment as that, in the stillness, after the long contradiction of the day, Miss Bordereau's secrets were in the air, the wonder of her survival more palpable. These were the acute impressions. I had them in another form, with more of a certain sort of reciprocity, during the hours that I sat in the garden looking up over the top of my book at the closed windows of my hostess. In these windows no sign of life ever appeared; it was as if, for fear of my catching a glimpse of them, the two ladies passed their days in the dark. But this only proved to me that they had something to conceal; which was what I had wished to demonstrate. Their motionless shutters became as expressive as eyes consciously closed, and I took comfort in thinking that at all events through invisible themselves they saw me between the lashes.|$|E
