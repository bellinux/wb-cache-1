40|$|Abstract. An image {{retrieval}} system based on local affine frames is introduced. The system provides highly discriminative retrieval of rigid objects under a very wide range of viewing and illumination conditions, and is robust to occlusion and background clutter. Distinguished regions of data dependent shape are detected, and local <b>affine</b> frames (<b>coordinate</b> <b>systems)</b> are obtained. Photometrically and geometrically normalised image patches are extracted and used for matching. Local correspondences are formed either by direct comparison of photometrically normalised colour intensities in the normalised patches, or by comparison of DCT (discrete cosine transform) coefficients of the patches. Experimental results are presented on a publicly available database of real outdoor images of buildings. We demonstrate {{the effect of the}} number of DCT coefficients that are used for the matching. Using the DCT, excellent results with a retrieval performance of 100 % in rank 1 are achieved, and memory usage is reduced by a factor of 4. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{well-known}} {{theory of}} the "rational canonical form of an operator" describes the invariant factors, or equivalently, elementary divisors, as {{a complete set of}} invariants of a similarity class of an operator on a finite-dimensional vector space V over a given field F. A finer part of the theory is the contribution by Frobenius dealing with the structure of the centralizer of an operator. The viewpoint is that of finitely generated modules over a PID, cf. for example [8], ch. 3. In this paper we approach the issue from a "dynamic" viewpoint. We also extend the theory to affine maps. The formulation is in terms of the action of the general linear group GL(n), resp. the group of invertible affine maps GA(n), on the semigroup of all linear, resp. affine, maps by conjugacy. The theory of rational canonical forms is connected with the orbits, and the Frobenius' theory with the orbit-classes, of the action of GL(n) on the semigroup of linear maps. We describe a parametrization of orbits and orbit-classes of both GL(n) - and GA(n) - actions, and also provide a parametrization of all linear and affine maps themselves, which is independent of the choices of linear or <b>affine</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>systems,</b> cf. sections 7, 8, 9. An important ingredient in these parametrizations is a certain flag. For a linear map T on V, let Z(L) (T) denote its centralizer associative F-algebra, and Z(L) (T) * the multiplicative group of invertible elements in Z(L) (T). In this situation, we associate a canonical, maximal, Z(L) (T) - invariant flag, and precisely describe the orbits of Z(L) (T) * on V, cf. section 3. The classical theory uses only invariance under T, i. e. V is considered only as a module over F[T]. The finer invariance under Z(L) (T), i. e. considering V as a module over Z(L) (T), makes the construction of the flag canonical. We believe that this flag has not appeared before in this classical subject. Using this approach, we strengthen the classical theory in a number of ways...|$|R

40|$|The Invariant Coordinate Selection (ICS) method shows {{remarkable}} {{properties for}} revealing data {{structures such as}} outliers in multivariate data sets. Based on the joint spectral decomposition of two scatter matrices, it leads to a new <b>affine</b> invariant <b>coordinate</b> <b>system.</b> The Euclidian distance considering all the invariant coordinates corresponds to a Mahalanobis distance in the original system. However, unlike the Mahalanobis distance, ICS {{makes it possible to}} select relevant components for displaying potential outliers. Using asymptotic arguments, the present paper shows the performance of ICS when the number of variables is large and outliers are contained in a small dimensional subspace. Owing to the resulting dimension reduction, the method is expected to improve the power of outlier detection rules such as Mahalanobis distance-based criteria. It also greatly simplifies outliers interpretation. The paper includes practical guidelines for using ICS {{in the context of a}} small proportion of outliers. The choice of scatter matrices together with the selection of relevant invariant components through parallel analysis and normality tests are addressed. An extensive simulation study provides a comparison with Principal Component Analysis and Mahalanobis distance.

40|$|Abstract. The rapid {{development}} of modeling of various electro-mechanic energy transformers (power transformers, electric machines) {{over the past}} years created the necessity to develop the systematic method of quality and quantity model analysis. Typical analysis of model includes the following stages: the calculation of transient processes, the calculation of established processes, the evaluation of static stability, and the parametric sensitiveness defining. Nowadays, only the analysis of transient processes is performed continuously, i. e. in the state cognate with the physical nature of a process. Other stages are studied in discrete time. The variety of mathematical apparatus used on each stage complicates the analysis and requires significant expenses. In this article, the author describes the method of solving all four tasks {{on the basis of a}} unified mathematic apparatus – general theory of differential equations based on a unified algorithm. The completion of first three stages is illustrated on example of the induction machine, the mathematical model of which is arranged to the normal Cauchy form in order to avoid inversion of coefficient matrix on each integration step. By using the <b>affine</b> <b>coordinate</b> <b>system</b> the physical meaning of stator variables has been preserved and the rank of model equation system has been reduced.
