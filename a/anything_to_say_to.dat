25|$|My {{grandfather}} Thorgny {{could well}} remember the Uppsala king Eirik Eymundson, {{and used to}} say of him {{that when he was}} in his best years he went out every summer on expeditions to different countries, and conquered for himself Finland, Kirjalaland, Courland, Esthonia, and the eastern countries all around; and at the present day the earth-bulwarks, ramparts, and other great works which he made are to be seen. And, more over, he was not so proud that he would not listen to people who had <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> him.|$|E
2500|$|According to Mercieca, he {{had last}} seen Foley at a dinner meeting 18 years before, in a {{restaurant}} in Fort Worth. When asked whether he had <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> Foley, Mercieca said, [...] "Remember the good times we had together, you know, and how well we enjoyed each other's company." [...] He added, [...] "Don’t keep dwelling on this thing, you know?" [...] Mercieca could not be prosecuted for his activities with Foley because the relevant statutes of limitations had expired, and the Palm Beach County state attorney's office [...] "cannot conduct an investigation because Foley has declined to press charges." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cynthia Leive, {{the editor}} in chief of Glamour, asked Cheney if she had <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> critics like James Dobson. Cheney accused Dobson of {{distorting}} the research he cited and added: [...] "Every piece of remotely responsible research that has been done in the last 20 years has shown there is no difference between children raised by same-sex parents and children raised by opposite-sex parents; what matters is being raised in a stable, loving environment." [...] She also said that Dobson was entitled to his opinion, [...] "but he's not someone whose endorsement I have ever drastically sought." ...|$|E

6000|$|Westover did {{not find}} that he had <b>anything</b> useful <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> this; so he said: [...] "I've no doubt it's better than being a painter." ...|$|R
6000|$|He mounted {{his horse}} slowly. [...] "Well," [...] he said smilingly, {{looking down the}} road, [...] "you ain't got <b>anything</b> more <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> me, have you?" ...|$|R
2500|$|This is {{the first}} time I have felt that I could take the time to write and also that I had <b>{{anything}}</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> anything except my manuscript book. You remember that I had an idea that I was going to write the autobiography of a Communist ... There lay the trouble. I had planned to write a journalistic account of a strike. But as I thought of it as fiction the thing got bigger and bigger. It couldn't be that. I've been living with this thing for some time now. I don't know how much I have got over, but I have used a small strike in an orchard valley as the symbol of man's eternal, bitter warfare with himself.|$|E
2500|$|Bush, the Vice President of the United States from 1981 to 1989, began {{planning}} a presidential run {{as early as}} 1985, and he entered the Republican primary in October 1987. His challengers for the Republican presidential nomination included U.S. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, U.S. Representative Jack Kemp of New York, former Governor Pete DuPont of Delaware, and conservative Christian televangelist Pat Robertson. Though considered the early frontrunner for the nomination, Bush came in third in the Iowa caucus, behind winner Dole and runner-up Robertson. Much as Reagan did in 1980, Bush reorganized his staff and concentrated on the New Hampshire primary. With Dole ahead in New Hampshire, Bush ran television commercials portraying the senator as a tax raiser; he rebounded to win the state's primary. Following the primary, Bush and Dole had a joint media appearance, when the interviewer asked Dole if he had <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> Bush, Dole said, {{in response to the}} ads, [...] "yeah, stop lying about my record" [...] in an angry tone. This is thought to have hurt Dole's campaign to Bush's benefit. Bush continued seeing victory, winning many Southern primaries as well. Once the multiple-state primaries such as Super Tuesday began, Bush's organizational strength and fundraising lead were impossible for the other candidates to match, and the nomination was his. Bush chose little-known U.S. Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana as his running mate. Despite the popularity of President Ronald Reagan popularity, Bush trailed Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis, then Governor of Massachusetts, in most polls for much of 1988.|$|E
6000|$|... "If I have <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you!" [...] he repeated, and {{his whole}} tone seemed {{vibrating}} with hardly subdued passion. [...] "If I have <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you! Is this your greeting?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't want <b>anything</b> more <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you," [...] {{said the}} captain, sternly. [...] "I've shown you the door once. Am I to take forcible measures?" ...|$|R
6000|$|RANKIN. If {{a man has}} {{the heart}} to pull the trigger, it matters little what color his hand is, Mr. Drinkwotter. Have ye <b>anything</b> else <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> me this afternoon? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{tell you}} the truth, Lady Laura," [...] said Phineas, [...] "I doubt whether the men of Loughshane,--or rather the man of Loughshane, will have <b>anything</b> more <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> me." ...|$|R
60|$|Bartley had by {{this time}} {{made up his mind}} that, if Witherby had <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> him, he should say it unaided.|$|E
6000|$|... "About Bell?" [...] said Mrs Dale, {{as though}} much {{surprised}} {{that he should have}} <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> her respecting her eldest daughter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Naturally," [...] Bellamy answered. [...] "If Mademoiselle {{really has}} <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you, I will, if I am permitted, {{return for a}} moment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Have you <b>anything</b> more <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> me?" [...] {{she asked}} in a low tone, but still proud and coldly. The revulsion within her was not tending to soften her. Everyone seemed hateful.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I'm {{not going}} <b>to</b> have <b>anything</b> more <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> Peter and Paul at present," [...] he {{declared}} at last. [...] "You'd keep me here all night, and the tea will be spoilt." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{have done}} you many injuries, but I never {{intended}} this. I am sorry for it. Have you <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> me before I go?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He won't have <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> me--thinks I'm an ass. I'm {{a simple}} sort of fellow--on the outside. But I'm {{not such a}} fool as I look." ...|$|E
6000|$|He was {{sensible}} of it, {{he achieved}} his performance. [...] "Why, that if I don't get the things back--every blessed {{one of them}} except a few she'll pick out--she won't have <b>anything</b> more <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Could I,’ said Rosa, rising, as {{he jerked}} {{out of his}} chair in his ungainly way: ‘could I ask you, most kindly to come to me at Christmas, if I had <b>anything</b> {{particular}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> you?’ ...|$|R
30|$|Entering {{into the}} group {{drumming}} really is {{learning a new}} language (…) there wasn’t <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> or <b>to</b> internalise or to even judge, it was just about a different way of talking to each other. (Focus group 3, patient).|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{came to live}} in Casterbridge {{entirely on}} my account," [...] he said. [...] "Yet now you are here you won't have <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> my offer!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Certainly," [...] was the {{somewhat}} cold assent. [...] "If {{you really have}} <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> me, perhaps you had better {{let me know what}} it is at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ferdinand, it will {{be better}} that we should not speak about my father. I will in all things strive to do as you would have me, but I cannot hear him abused. If you have <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> go <b>to</b> Everett." ...|$|R
6000|$|While {{looking at}} the work {{produced}} by the inmates, I asked Commissioner Cox if she had <b>anything</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> as <b>to</b> the charges of sweating which are sometimes brought against the Army, and of underselling in the markets. Her answer was:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{answered}} it. It {{was very}} bad, my letter. I should think {{after that he}} will never want <b>to</b> have <b>anything</b> more <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> me. I tried for two days, but I could not write a nice letter." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I am {{disappointed}} in you altogether, Harry. I have looked upon you {{as being a}} real friend of Frank, and now you desert him directly his enemy says a few soft words to you.
