5|$|During {{their stay}} in Annapolis, {{the men of}} 21st {{assisted}} in the escape of a slave belonging to Maryland Governor Thomas Holliday Hicks. While the slave was hidden in <b>a</b> <b>chimney</b> {{in one of the}} Naval Academy barracks, Governor Hicks's repeated demands for his return were refused by the officers of the regiment.|$|E
5|$|The {{third floor}} is a single, unparitioned room that was likely used for storage. The cellar of the jail has <b>a</b> <b>chimney</b> {{on the west}} that has several ovens, {{including}} a beehive oven, and was not partitioned except for the fieldstone foundation required to support the cells in the southeast corner.|$|E
5|$|Tremors were felt {{to varying}} degrees {{throughout}} New York State, including by people in some buildings in Manhattan. Physical damage occurred in Brooklyn, where <b>a</b> <b>chimney</b> in Red Hook was toppled. There were some disruptions, including building evacuations and delays at airports. Amtrak train service at Penn Station was also delayed.|$|E
25|$|<b>A</b> solar <b>chimney</b> often {{referred}} to as <b>a</b> thermal <b>chimney</b> is <b>a</b> way of improving the natural ventilation of buildings by using convection of air heated by passive solar energy. A simple description of <b>a</b> solar <b>chimney</b> is that of a vertical shaft utilizing solar energy to enhance the natural stack ventilation through a building.|$|R

5|$|Since {{the house}} passed to the National Trust in 1972, major works of {{restoration}} and re-creation have been undertaken {{and a number of}} pieces of Burges furniture, mostly not original to the house, are displayed. These include a bookcase from Buckingham Street and <b>a</b> <b>chimney</b> piece from the Hall at Worcester College, Oxford, where, in the 1960s, some decorative works by Burges were removed, although his redecoration of the college Chapel remains. The aim is, as far as possible, to reinstate the work of Burges and Crace.|$|E
5|$|Between 1847 and 1850, when Blore was {{building}} the new east wing, the Brighton Pavilion {{was once again}} plundered of its fittings. As a result, many of the rooms in the new wing have a distinctly oriental atmosphere. The red and blue Chinese Luncheon Room is made up from parts of the Brighton Banqueting and Music Rooms with a large oriental chimney piece sculpted by Richard Westmacott. The Yellow Drawing Room has wallpaper supplied in 1817 for the Brighton Saloon, and <b>a</b> <b>chimney</b> piece which is a European vision of how the Chinese chimney piece may appear. It has nodding mandarins in niches and fearsome winged dragons, designed by Robert Jones.|$|E
5|$|He {{was then}} {{commissioned}} to repair <b>a</b> <b>chimney</b> {{at a local}} brewery. While working on this, he met a local welder who also knew the vicar of Bolton (Richard Greville Norburn), who wanted some repairs made to Bolton parish church's weathervanes. The vicar drove a 1929Humber limousine and was impressed by Dibnah's AJS motorcycle; the two quickly became friends. The church was the tallest building in Bolton and once Dibnah had repaired the weathervane the vicar asked him to gild it. Dibnah appeared in the local newspaper and the publicity and his friendship with the vicar enabled him to gain more work from the local clergy.|$|E
50|$|The {{remains of}} the smelter-works {{includes}} a blast furnace, concrete engine mounts and <b>an</b> iron <b>chimney.</b> <b>A</b> large, well-formed slag dump extends northward from the smelter. Adjacent to the furnace is <b>a</b> second iron <b>chimney,</b> powerhouse foundations and roasting furnace. The steel plate chimneys {{and parts of the}} smelter are all heavily rusted and the foundations are showing signs of heavy cracking.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1930s engine no. 1197 was fitted with <b>an</b> {{experimental}} <b>chimney</b> designed by Watson. <b>A</b> similar <b>chimney,</b> {{the shape of}} which earned it a nickname that referred to a night bucket, was also tested on Class 5B no. 726.

50|$|Worsdell {{gave the}} Class A some design {{features}} {{that would become}} characteristic of most NER locos from then on. These included <b>a</b> tapered <b>chimney,</b> <b>a</b> brass cover for the safety valves and a large protective cab.|$|R
5|$|In 1844, the London and Croydon Railway {{was given}} {{parliamentary}} authority to test an experimental pneumatic propulsion {{system on the}} railway (referred to {{at the time as}} the atmospheric-propulsion system). A pumping station was built on Portland Road; this created a vacuum in a pipe paralleling the railway tracks. A piston extended downwards from the trains into a slit in the pipe, meaning that trains were literally sucked towards the pumping station or blown away from it. The pumping station was built in a Gothic style, with a very tall ornate tower which served both as <b>a</b> <b>chimney</b> and as an exhaust vent for air pumped from the propulsion pipe.|$|E
5|$|In Martinsburg, West Virginia, several {{government}} buildings were evacuated, and multiple citizens reported feeling their homes shaking violently enough to rattle picture frames off the walls. In Charleston, the Kanawha County Courthouse, the West Virginia State Capitol campus, {{and several other}} downtown buildings were evacuated; Kanawha County dispatchers received more than 350 telephone calls in 45 minutes, but there were not any reports of damage to buildings and infrastructure other than minor plaster cracking in the old courthouse. In Philippi, part of <b>a</b> <b>chimney</b> collapsed at the Barbour County courthouse. The West Virginia Office of Miners' Health, Safety and Training stated that West Virginia coal mines were safe following the tremors. A roof collapse in Patriot Coal Company's Big Mountain Complex forced {{the closure of the}} mine.|$|E
5|$|In contrast, air {{furnaces}} (such as reverberatory furnaces) {{are naturally}} aspirated, usually by the convection of hot gases in <b>a</b> <b>chimney</b> flue. According to this broad definition, bloomeries for iron, blowing houses for tin, and smelt mills for lead would {{be classified as}} blast furnaces. However, the term has usually been limited to those used for smelting iron ore to produce pig iron, an intermediate material used {{in the production of}} commercial iron and steel, and the shaft furnaces used in combination with sinter plants in base metals smelting.|$|E

5|$|The Palace of Westminster, {{the medieval}} royal palace {{used as the}} home of the British parliament, was largely {{destroyed}} by fire on 16 October 1834. The blaze was caused by the burning of small wooden tally sticks which had been used as part of the accounting procedures of the Exchequer until 1826. The sticks were disposed of in a careless manner in the two furnaces under the House of Lords, which caused <b>a</b> <b>chimney</b> fire in the two flues that ran under the floor of the Lords' chamber and up through the walls.|$|E
5|$|The {{conversion}} to be a dovecote took place around 1780. Pigeons and doves were an important food source historically kept for their eggs, flesh, and dung. Although {{it is now}} a roofless ruin with some of the windows blocked up, it previously had <b>a</b> <b>chimney</b> and the fireplace can still be seen. The National Trust acquired the freehold from Sir Henry Hugh Arthur Hoare of the Hoare baronets, whose family seat was at Stourhead, in 1915. The tower was subsequently designated as a scheduled monument in 1953 and a listed building (Grade II*) in 1961.|$|E
5|$|The {{gathering}} of the dignitaries at the station and {{the departure of the}} trains was a major event. Every hotel room and lodging-house in Liverpool was full the night before. From 9.00am onwards the area around the station was filled with people, and crowds thronged the trackside at Liverpool to watch the trains depart. One group of men had each paid two shillings for access to the best vantage point, the top of <b>a</b> <b>chimney</b> near the tunnel leading to Crown Street railway station; they were hoisted up by rope and board shortly after dawn to watch proceedings.|$|E

5|$|Those {{tending the}} {{furnaces}} were {{unaware that the}} heat from the fires had melted the copper lining of the flues and started <b>a</b> <b>chimney</b> fire. With the doors of the furnaces open, more oxygen was drawn into the furnaces, which ensured the fire burned more fiercely, and the flames driven further up the flues than they should have been. The flues had been weakened over time by having footholds cut in them by the child chimney sweeps. Although these footholds would have been repaired as the child exited on finishing the cleaning, the fabric of the chimney was still weakened by the action. In October 1834 the chimneys had not yet had their annual sweep, and a considerable amount of clinker had built up inside the flues.|$|E
5|$|A leat runs to {{the east}} of the town's main street but it is {{uncertain}} when it was first constructed. By the early seventeenth century, {{the southern end of the}} leat and one mill are shown on a map. There were three main mills: Higher Mill, Lower Mill and Middle Mill. Higher Mill appears to have always been a corn mill and it continued to produce animal feed until 1974. It has since been converted to housing but a water turbine remains. Middle Mill was used as a woollen mill in the nineteenth century and was also associated with Bilbie's bell foundry (see below). Around 1900, the mill was steam powered and had a boiler delivered. It is labelled as an axle works on the 1904 Second Edition Ordnance Survey map. The only remains of Middle Mill are some walls and <b>a</b> <b>chimney</b> base. Lower Mill ceased working in 1968. The building is now in residential use but the sluices (made by Stenner and Gunn of the Lowman Ironworks, Tiverton) can still be seen, as can the water wheel and gearing.|$|E
5|$|A storm system {{moved to}} the {{northern}} and central Great Plains region during the day, as strong winds helped push a moist air mass northward ahead of the system. Thunderstorms developed during the afternoon ahead of a cold front from southeast South Dakota into central Kansas. Strong winds along with instability in the atmosphere created favorable conditions for supercell development {{with the potential to}} produce strong tornadoes. At approximately 6:35 pm CDT (2335 UTC) a tornado hit the Little Sioux Scout Ranch in Little Sioux, Iowa, killing four Boy Scouts after <b>a</b> <b>chimney</b> collapsed on them and injuring 48others. The camp received a tornado warning 12minutes before it struck. There were 93campers and 25staff members at the camp. The campers were between 13and 18 years old and were attending a leadership training camp. The tornado was rated EF3on the Enhanced Fujita Scale.|$|E

5|$|The falling trees downed {{power lines}} and poles, causing power outages and some {{property}} damage due to the trees and poles hitting houses. One indirect fatality occurred when a motorist drove into a downed tree. Two other vehicles in Franklin County and a fire truck in York were hit and greatly damaged by trees. Downed wires set a Family Dollar on fire in Paradise Township and was believed to have started a fire in a church in Ringtown. Falling trees hit at least eleven houses, with one tree severely damaging a mobile home in Bellwood. Damage directly from the wind was generally minor, and included a house losing <b>a</b> <b>chimney</b> in Camp Hill, a carport being blown over in New Oxford, and at least four houses reporting roof or siding damage. The hurricane also damaged corn fields near Lancaster. Downed trees closed or disrupted traffic on at least 56roads in the region, including U.S. Routes 6 and 322, as well as Interstate 83 in York County.|$|E
5|$|The story {{opens with}} a lengthy {{explanation}} of ratiocination. Dupin demonstrates his prowess by deducing his companion's thoughts as if through apparent supernatural power. The story then turns to the baffling double murder of Madame L'Espanaye and her daughter at their home in the Rue Morgue, a fictional street in Paris. According to newspaper accounts, the mother {{was found in a}} yard behind the house, with multiple broken bones and her throat so deeply cut that her head fell off when the body was moved. The daughter was found strangled to death and stuffed upside down into <b>a</b> <b>chimney.</b> The murders occurred in a fourth-floor room that was locked from the inside; on the floor were found a bloody straight razor, several bloody tufts of gray hair, and two bags of gold coins. Several witnesses reported hearing two voices {{at the time of the}} murder, one male and French, but disagreed on the language spoken by the other. The speech was unclear, and every witness admits that he does not know the language he claims to have heard.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} from National Service in 1962 Dibnah {{retrieved}} his tools from storage, bought a 1927 350cc AJS motorcycle for 21guineas and looked for more work. Bolton, however, {{was in the midst}} of post-industrial decline; between 1957 and 1965 about 70mills were closed in the town, leaving only 37mills operational and about 50disused. Initially he was unable to find much work and existed on smaller, domestic jobs, until he earned enough to buy his own set of ladders and secured his first commission while working at a local mill. He was paid £140 to point a mill tower, which he did at weekends. He struggled, however, to get any more meaningful work, until he met Lonsdale Bonner, one of his teachers from art college. The two agreed a deal whereby Bonner would be paid a commission for each job he got for Dibnah. His first job was dismantling <b>a</b> <b>chimney</b> alongside the Manchester and Bolton Railway, a difficult proposition, as a mistake could force the temporary closure of the railway. The two managed to gain commissions for several jobs, but their relationship was terminated when Dibnah was called upon to undertake another six months of National Service.|$|E
