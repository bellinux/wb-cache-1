5|$|The former British colonies include Trinidad and Tobago, whose calypso {{style is}} an {{especially}} potent part of {{the music of the}} other former British colonies, which <b>also</b> <b>share</b> traditions like the Big Drum dance. The French islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe share the popular zouk style and have also had extensive musical contact with the music of Haiti, itself once a French colony though not part of the Lesser Antilles. The Dutch colonies of Curaçao, Bonaire and Aruba share the combined rhythm popular style. The islands <b>also</b> <b>share</b> a passion for kaseko, a genre of Surinamese music; Suriname and its neighbors Guyana and French Guiana share folk and popular styles that are connected enough to the Antilles and other Caribbean islands that both countries are studied in the broader context of Antillean or Caribbean music.|$|E

5|$|Armstrong and Ward {{transcribed}} intonation in {{a system}} where lines and dots correspond to stressed and unstressed syllables, respectively, and vertical position corresponds to pitch. Their method of transcribing intonation was anticipated by the one used in H. S. Perera and Daniel Jones's (1919) reader for Sinhalese, and the preface to Handbook of English Intonation notes an inspiration in Hermann Klinghardt's notation for intonation. Klinghardt said his book {{would have been impossible}} without Daniel Jones; his exercises <b>also</b> <b>share</b> similarities to Jones's intonation curves. Armstrong and Ward used a system of discrete dots and marks to mark the intonation contour because they found it easier for learners of English to follow than a continuous line.|$|E
5|$|Former first five-eighth Tony Brown {{holds the}} record for most career points with 857. His 857 career points {{included}} 144conversions, 183penalties, and six drop-goals.

5|$|Ideological and {{political}} rivals for centuries, Taoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism deeply influenced one another. For example, Wang Bi, {{one of the}} most influential philosophical commentators on Laozi (and Yijing), was a Confucian. The three rivals <b>also</b> <b>share</b> some similar values, with all three embracing a humanist philosophy emphasizing moral behavior and human perfection. In time, most Chinese people identified to some extent with all three traditions simultaneously. This became institutionalised when aspects of the three schools were synthesised in the Neo-Confucian school.|$|E
5|$|The Lawton PD is {{especially}} pleased that “prominent crimes”, such as robbery and homicide have declined nearly 50%. Sergeants Stephanie Crawford and Tim Jenkins credit the marked improvement {{to not only}} the outstanding work of the LPD, {{but also to the}} involvement of Lawton’s citizens. One of the key contributing factors is local Neighborhood Watch groups, which act as the eyes and ears of the police department in the areas they represent.

5|$|Western jackdaws {{practice}} active food sharing– {{where the}} initiative {{for the transfer}} lies with the donor– {{with a number of}} individuals, regardless of sex or kinship. They <b>also</b> <b>share</b> more of a preferred food than a less preferred food. The active giving of food by most birds is found mainly in the context of parental care and courtship. Western jackdaws show much higher levels of active giving than has been documented for other species, including chimpanzees. The function of this behaviour is not fully understood, though it {{has been found to be}} detached from nutrition and compatible with hypotheses of mutualism, reciprocity and harassment avoidance. It has also been proposed that food sharing may be motivated by prestige enhancement.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there are}} minor traces of Punic-Phoenician and Romano-Italian influence, the Delian mosaics {{generally}} {{conform to the}} major trends found in Hellenistic art. The same wealthy patrons who commissioned paintings and sculptures at Delos may have also been involved in hiring mosaic artists from abroad. Delian mosaics share certain characteristics with mosaics {{in other parts of}} the Greek world, such as Macedonian mosaics in Pella. They <b>also</b> <b>share</b> some attributes with Greek painting traditions and often employ a similar black-background technique found in red-figure pottery of the Classical period. Some of the styles and techniques used at Delos were later found in Roman art and mosaics, although contemporary Roman examples from Pompeii, for instance, reveal significant differences in the production and design of mosaics in the western versus eastern Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|In their {{original}} description, Krause and colleagues suggested that Lavanify was most {{closely related to}} the then-unnamed Indian sudamericid. They based this proposed relationship on the shared presence of prominent, continuous bands of IPM. The teams who named the Indian gondwanathere in 2007 both agreed with this proposed relationship. In their description of Dakshina, Wilson and colleagues added the presence of an infundibulum and of perikymata to the evidence for the relationship between the two. These three characters are synapomorphies (shared derived traits) for the Bharattherium-Lavanify clade. They <b>also</b> <b>share</b> the presence of furrows on the lingual side of the teeth only, but whether this is a derived feature is uncertain. Wilson and colleagues list two autapomorphies (unique derived traits) of Lavanify: presence of a V-shaped dentine island and absence of enamel {{on one side of the}} crown. Prasad and colleagues who named Bharattherium, noted the absence of enamel on part of the crown of a Bharattherium tooth and interpreted this trait as a synapomorphy of Bharattherium and Lavanify. They also mentioned the presence of a furrow and infundibulum as shared traits.|$|E
5|$|Since {{detailed}} {{descriptions of}} extinct macaws exist only for the species on Cuba, {{it is impossible to}} determine the species' relationships. It has been suggested that the closest mainland relative of the Cuban macaw is the scarlet macaw (Ara macao), due to the similar distribution of red and blue in their plumage, and the presence of a white patch around the eyes, naked except for lines of small red feathers. Furthermore, the range of the scarlet macaw extends to the margins of the Caribbean Sea. The Cuban macaw is distinct due to its lack of a yellow shoulder patch, its all-black beak, and its smaller size. The two <b>also</b> <b>share</b> a species of feather mite, which supports their relationship. James Greenway believed the scarlet macaw and the Cuban macaw formed a superspecies with the other extinct species suggested to have inhabited Jamaica, Hispaniola and Guadeloupe.|$|E

5|$|The 20S {{proteasome}} is both ubiquitous {{and essential}} in eukaryotes. Some prokaryotes, including many archaea and the bacterial order Actinomycetales <b>also</b> <b>share</b> homologs of the 20S proteasome, whereas most bacteria possess heat shock genes hslV and hslU, whose gene products are a multimeric protease {{arranged in a}} two-layered ring and an ATPase. The hslV protein has been hypothesized to resemble the likely ancestor of the 20S proteasome. In general, HslV is not essential in bacteria, and not all bacteria possess it, whereas some protists possess both the 20S and the hslV systems. Many bacteria also possess other homologs of the proteasome and an associated ATPase, most notably ClpP and ClpX. This redundancy explains why the HslUV system is not essential.|$|E
5|$|The Hadza {{people of}} Tanzania <b>also</b> <b>share</b> food, {{possibly}} to gain in reputation. Hunters cannot be sharing meat mainly to provision their families or to gain reciprocal benefits, as teenage boys often give away their meat {{even though they}} do not yet have wives or children, so costly signalling of their qualities is the likely explanation. These qualities include good eyesight, coordination, strength, knowledge, endurance, or bravery. Hadza hunters more often pair with highly fertile, hard-working wives than non-hunters. A woman benefits from mating with a man who possesses such qualities as her children will most likely inherit qualities that increase fitness and survivorship. She may also benefit from her husband’s high social status. Thus, hunting is an honest and costly signal of phenotypic quality.|$|E
5|$|The incisive foramina, which {{perforate}} {{the palate}} between the incisors and the molars, {{are long and}} narrow, extending between the first molars. The back margins of the zygomatic plates, the flattened front portions of the zygomatic arches (cheekbones), are located before the first molars. Like its close relatives Lundomys and Holochilus, Pseudoryzomys has spinous processes on its zygomatic plates. These genera <b>also</b> <b>share</b> relatively simple posterolateral palatal pits, perforations of the palate near the third molar. Unlike Holochilus and Lundomys, however, Pseudoryzomys has a flat palate, lacking a ridge on the middle that extends {{along the length of}} the palate. The parapterygoid fossae, which are located behind the third molars, are excavated beyond the level of the palate, but not as deeply as in Holochilus and Lundomys. The mastoid skull bone contains a conspicuous opening, as in most oryzomyines.|$|E

5|$|The {{relationship}} between the three domains is of central importance for understanding the origin of life. Most of the metabolic pathways, which are {{the object of the}} majority of an organism's genes, are common between Archaea and Bacteria, while most genes involved in genome expression are common between Archaea and Eukarya. Within prokaryotes, archaeal cell structure is most similar to that of gram-positive bacteria, largely because both have a single lipid bilayer and usually contain a thick sacculus (exoskeleton) of varying chemical composition. In some phylogenetic trees based upon different gene/protein sequences of prokaryotic homologs, the archaeal homologs are more closely related to those of gram-positive bacteria. Archaea and gram-positive bacteria <b>also</b> <b>share</b> conserved indels in a number of important proteins, such as Hsp70 and glutamine synthetaseI; however, the phylogeny of these genes was interpreted to reveal interdomain gene transfer, and might not reflect the organismal relationship(s).|$|E
5|$|Between 2011–12, {{they met}} in four {{consecutive}} Grand Slam tournament finals, just {{the second time in}} tennis history this has happened. In doing so, they also became the second pair in history, after Venus and Serena Williams, to meet in the finals of each of the four different Grand Slam events. Djokovic defeated Nadal in the first three (from Wimbledon to the Australian Open), making Nadal the first player in history to lose three consecutive Grand Slam event finals. However, Nadal defeated Djokovic in the French Open final, denying him a Career Grand Slam and the opportunity to become the first man since Rod Laver to hold all four Majors at once. The two <b>also</b> <b>share</b> the record for the longest Australian Open and Grand Slam tournament final match ever played (5 hours and 53 minutes), at the 2012 Australian Open final. This and the 2013 French Open semifinal they contested, are considered two of the greatest matches of all time. At ATP Masters 1000 level, they have met 26 times, 12 of which were in the final (a record), including the 2013 Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters, where Djokovic ended Nadal's 47-match winning run and eight-year winning streak at the event.|$|E
5|$|The camera app {{includes}} a new shooting mode known as Zoe (alluding to the zoetrope), which captures a short video alongside each photo taken. Individual frames {{can be saved}} from the clip, while the frames {{can also be used}} with other editing features such as Sequence Shot (which superimposes multiple frames into a composite image). Photos taken in Zoe mode are also displayed with animated thumbnails in the gallery. The Highlights feature can automatically generate a montage video from photos and videos with multiple theme and soundtrack options. The resulting video can be exported, or posted online through the HTC Share service (where they are accessible for 30 days). A television guide app is also provided, which incorporates remote control functionality via an infrared blaster hidden in the One’s power button, show recommendations powered by Peel, and the ability to display show reminders as stories on BlinkFeed. An updated music app now {{includes a}} visualizer and support for on-screen lyrics. An updated version of the Get Started feature (as introduced by HTC One X+) allows users to perform initial setup for their One via a web-based service, while a new Sync Manager allows data to be migrated from iOS device backups or HTC devices with Android 4.0 and higher. As with all devices in the One series, 25GB of Dropbox storage is available free for two years. Using NFC, the One can <b>also</b> <b>share</b> content between other compatible Android devices with Android Beam, and conduct mobile payments where compatible systems (such as FeliCa in Japan) are available.|$|E
