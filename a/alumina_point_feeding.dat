40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of water vapour and additives on {{the decrease in}} surface area of gamma Al 2 O 3 at 1378 K, before its transformation into alpha Al 2 O 3, was investigated. The experimental rate of this decrease was found to vary as P H 2 O at constant value of surface area and for a value of water vapour pressure ranging from 0. 1 to 1 kPa. This reduction in surface area was inhibited by a slight addition of Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, La 3 +, Th 4 + or Zr 4 + ions but its rate was drastically increased by increasing both additive content up to 4 % (cationic fraction) and oxygen pressure.

40|$|Abstract- Chromate (CrO 4 2 -) {{adsorption}} {{was investigated}} onkaolinite (0. 2 - 2 ~m) saturated with NaC 104 over {{a range of}} pH. Adsorption increased with decreasing pH because of protonation of chromate and/ or variable charge sites on kaolinite. Chemical pretreatment to remove noncrystalline and crystalline oxide contaminants affected the magnitude ofCrO 42 - adsorption, but not the pH range over which CrO 42 -adsorbed. Chromate adsorption at different sorbate and sorbent concentrations i creased below the pHz~ for the kaolinite dge, suggesting the formation of weak surface complexes. If f rO 4 2 - and SO 42 - were present at equal concentration (5. 0 x 10 - 7 M), the two solutes orbed independently, suggesting binding to separate sites. The presence of excess SO 42 - (5. 0 x 10 - 4 M), however, unexplainably enhanced CrO 42 -adsorption. The adsorption of both chromate and sulfate {{can be described in}} terms of a site-binding model of the kaolinite dge, in which the edge is viewed as composite layers of AI and Si oxide.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of many conservation programs {{is to increase}} population size by improving a species' survival and reproduction. However, density dependence of demographic parameters may confound this approach. In this study we used a 25 -year data set on Bearded Vultures (Gypaetus barbatus) in Spain to evaluate the consequences of population growth on reproductive performance. Unlike its coefficient of variation (CV), mean annual productivity decreased with increasing population size. After controlling for territorial heterogeneity, productivity also was negatively related to {{the distance to the}} nearest conspecific breeding pair and to supplementary <b>feeding</b> <b>points</b> where floaters congregate. These results suggest that vulture populations are regulated as posited by the site-dependency hypothesis: as the population increases, average productivity decreases because progressively poorer territories are used. The combined effects of the shrinkage of territories and the presence of floaters around supplementary <b>feeding</b> <b>points</b> seem to be the main causes of productivity decline and are therefore the main determinants of territory quality. This has conservation implications, especially concerning the role of supplementary <b>feeding</b> <b>points.</b> Supplementary <b>feeding</b> should be reviewed given that its usefulness in reducing preadult mortality has not yet been proved and its effect on productivity, as our results suggest, is negative. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.
