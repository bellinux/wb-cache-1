5|$|After two failed attempts, {{about 60}} common {{starlings}} were released in 1890 into New York's Central Park by Eugene Schieffelin. He {{was president of}} the American <b>Acclimatization</b> Society, which tried to introduce every bird species mentioned in the works of William Shakespeare into North America. About the same date, the Portland Song Bird Club released 35 pairs of common starlings in Portland, Oregon. These birds became established but disappeared around 1902. Common starlings reappeared in the Pacific Northwest in the mid-1940s and these birds were probably descendants of the 1890 Central Park introduction. The original 60 birds have since swelled in number to 150 million, occupying an area extending from southern Canada and Alaska to Central America.|$|E
5|$|Bumblebees are Northern Hemisphere animals. When {{red clover}} was {{introduced}} as a crop to New Zealand {{in the nineteenth}} century, it {{was found to have}} no local pollinators, and clover seed had accordingly to be imported each year. Four species of bumblebee from the United Kingdom were therefore imported as pollinators. In 1885 and 1886 the Canterbury <b>Acclimatization</b> Society brought in 442 queens, of which 93 survived and quickly multiplied. As planned, red clover was soon being produced from locally-grown seed. Bumblebees are also reared commercially to pollinate tomatoes grown in greenhouses. The New Zealand population of buff-tailed bumblebees naturally colonised Tasmania, 1,500 miles away, in 1992.|$|E
5|$|During the First World War, Newfoundland was {{a largely}} rural Dominion of the British Empire with a {{population}} of 240,000, and not yet part of Canada. The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 led the Government of Newfoundland to recruit a force for service with the British Army. Even though the island had not possessed any formal military organization since 1870, enough men soon volunteered that an entire battalion was formed, and later maintained throughout the war. The regiment trained at various locations in the United Kingdom and increased from an initial contingent of 500 men to full battalion strength of 1,000 men, before being deployed. After a period of <b>acclimatization</b> in Egypt, the regiment was deployed at Suvla Bay on the Gallipoli peninsula with the 29th British Division in support of the Gallipoli Campaign. With the close of the Gallipoli Campaign the regiment spent a short period recuperating before being transferred to the Western Front in March 1916.|$|E
25|$|Adaptation {{differs from}} flexibility, <b>acclimatization,</b> and learning. Flexibility {{deals with the}} {{relative}} capacity of an organism to maintain itself in different habitats: its degree of specialization. <b>Acclimatization</b> describes automatic physiological adjustments during life; learning means improvement in behavioral performance during life. These terms are preferred to adaptation for changes during life which are not inherited by the next generation.|$|E
25|$|Athletes {{can also}} take {{advantage}} of altitude <b>acclimatization</b> to increase their performance. The same changes that help the body cope with high altitude increase performance back at sea level. However, this {{may not always be}} the case. Any positive <b>acclimatization</b> effects may be negated by a de-training effect as the athletes are usually not able to exercise with as much intensity at high altitudes compared to sea level.|$|E
25|$|Geographical {{societies}} {{like the}} Royal Geographical Society and the Société de géographie supported imperialism by funding explorers and other colonial proponents. Scientific societies acted similarly. <b>Acclimatization</b> societies directly supported colonial enterprises and enjoyed their benefits. The writings of Lamarck provided theoretical backing for the <b>acclimatization</b> doctrines. The Société Zoologique d'Acclimatation was largely founded by Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire—son of Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, a close colleague and supporter of Lamarck.|$|E
25|$|The 500 {{square meter}} {{facility}} of ABS-CBN Film Archives {{is covered with}} insulated walls. It has two film vaults: the medium-term vault and the long-term vault. The medium term vault holds betacam tapes, U-matic, 16mm negatives and prints, and some 35mm negatives and prints while the long-term vault holds the 35mm negatives and master prints. The facility is protected by a special fire suppression system. <b>Acclimatization</b> rooms are located between the vaults and the exit. Before a film could be taken out from the vault, it has {{to stay in the}} first <b>acclimatization</b> room for 24 hours and in the second <b>acclimatization</b> room for another 24 hours to prevent damage caused by condensation due to rapid temperature change. The temperature in the long-term vault is maintained between 8 and 10°C with 31 to 35 percent relative humidity while in the medium-term vault, the temperature is maintained between 15 and 20°C with 35 to 50 percent relative humidity. The air-conditioning system of the facility operates 24 hours a day. The facility is accessible to visitors for academic and research purposes.|$|E
25|$|Increased {{water intake}} {{may also help}} in <b>acclimatization</b> to replace the fluids lost through heavier {{breathing}} in the thin, dry air found at altitude, although consuming excessive quantities ("over-hydration") has no benefits and may cause dangerous hyponatremia.|$|E
25|$|Altitude {{sickness}} usually occurs {{following a}} rapid ascent and {{can usually be}} prevented by ascending slowly. In most of these cases, the symptoms are temporary and usually abate as altitude <b>acclimatization</b> occurs. However, in extreme cases, altitude sickness can be fatal.|$|E
25|$|The soybean {{was first}} {{cultivated}} in France by 1779 (and perhaps {{as early as}} 1740). The two key early people and organizations introducing the soybean to France were the Society of <b>Acclimatization</b> (starting in 1855) and Li Yu-ying (from 1910). Li started a large tofu factory, where the first commercial soyfoods in France were made.|$|E
25|$|In {{his first}} tournament outside the USSR, the Hastings 1934–35, Botvinnik {{achieved}} only {{a tie for}} 5th–6th places, with 5/9. He wrote that, in London after the tournament, Emanuel Lasker said his arrival only {{two hours before the}} first round began was a serious mistake and that he should have allowed tendays for <b>acclimatization.</b> Botvinnik wrote that he did not make this mistake again.|$|E
25|$|Ascending slowly is {{the best}} way to avoid {{altitude}} sickness. Avoiding strenuous activity such as skiing, hiking, etc. in the first 24 hours at high altitude reduces the symptoms of AMS. Alcohol and sleeping pills are respiratory depressants, and thus slow down the <b>acclimatization</b> process and should be avoided. Alcohol also tends to cause dehydration and exacerbates AMS. Thus, avoiding alcohol consumption in the first 24–48 hours at a higher altitude is optimal.|$|E
25|$|People {{who wish}} to trek to the summit of Kilimanjaro are advised to {{undertake}} appropriate research and ensure that they are both properly equipped and physically capable. Though the climb is technically not as challenging as when climbing the high peaks of the Himalayas or Andes, the high elevation, low temperature, and occasional high winds make this a difficult and dangerous trek. <b>Acclimatization</b> is essential, {{and even the most}} experienced trekkers suffer some degree of altitude sickness.|$|E
25|$|Defects of {{character}} supposedly generated by tropical climates {{were believed to}} be inheritable under the Lamarckian theory of inheritance of acquired characteristics, a discredited precursor to the Darwinian theory of natural selection. The outdated theory begins with the observation that an organism faced with environmental pressures may undergo physiological changes during its lifetime through the process of <b>acclimatization.</b> Lamarckianism suggested that those physiological changes may be passed directly to offspring, without the need for offspring to develop the trait in the same manner.|$|E
25|$|The {{human body}} can adapt to high {{altitude}} through both immediate and long-term <b>acclimatization.</b> At high altitude, {{in the short}} term, the lack of oxygen is sensed by the carotid bodies, which causes {{an increase in the}} breathing depth and rate (hyperpnea). However, hyperpnea also causes the adverse effect of respiratory alkalosis, inhibiting the respiratory center from enhancing the respiratory rate as much as would be required. Inability to increase the breathing rate can be caused by inadequate carotid body response or pulmonary or renal disease.|$|E
25|$|Perth Zoo {{was opened}} on 17 October 1898 by the Governor of Western Australia, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Gerard Smith. Planning for the zoo had started in 1896 when the Western Australian <b>Acclimatization</b> Committee first met, the {{original}} purpose {{of which was}} to introduce European animals to Australia and establish a zoo. In 1897 this group invited {{the director of the}} Melbourne Zoo, Albert Le Souef, to choose a site. His son Ernest was chosen as the first director of the Perth Zoo, and work began in 1897.|$|E
25|$|The death zone, in mountaineering, {{refers to}} altitudes above {{a certain point}} where the amount of oxygen is {{insufficient}} to sustain human life. This point is generally tagged as , less than 356 millibars of atmospheric pressure). All 14 summits in the death zone above 8000 m, called eight-thousanders, {{are located in the}} Himalaya and Karakoram mountain ranges. The concept of the death zone (originally the lethal zone) was first conceived in 1953 by Edouard Wyss-Dunant, a Swiss doctor, in an article about <b>acclimatization</b> published in the journal of the Swiss Foundation for Alpine Research.|$|E
25|$|Full <b>acclimatization,</b> however, {{requires}} days or even weeks. Gradually, {{the body}} compensates for the respiratory alkalosis by renal excretion of bicarbonate, allowing adequate respiration to provide oxygen without risking alkalosis. It takes about four days {{at any given}} altitude and can be enhanced by drugs such as acetazolamide. Eventually, the body undergoes physiological changes such as lower lactate production (because reduced glucose breakdown decreases the amount of lactate formed), decreased plasma volume, increased hematocrit (polycythemia), increased RBC mass, a higher concentration of capillaries in skeletal muscle tissue, increased myoglobin, increased mitochondria, increased aerobic enzyme concentration, increase in 2,3-BPG, hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction, and right ventricular hypertrophy. Pulmonary artery pressure increases {{in an effort to}} oxygenate more blood.|$|E
25|$|A major {{handicap}} of all {{expeditions to}} {{the north side of}} Mount Everest is the tight time window between the end of winter and the start of the monsoon rains. To travel from Darjeeling in northern India over Sikkim to Tibet, it was necessary to climb high, long snow-laden passes east of the Kangchenjunga area. After this first step, a long journey followed through the valley of the Arun River to the Rongbuk valley near the north face of Mt. Everest. Horses, donkeys, yaks, and dozens of local porters provided transport. The expeditions arrived at Mt. Everest in late April and only had until June before the monsoon began, allowing only six to eight weeks for altitude <b>acclimatization,</b> setting up camps, and the actual climbing attempts.|$|E
25|$|In the {{treatment}} of mountain sickness, acetazolamide forces the kidneys to excrete bicarbonate, the conjugate base of carbonic acid. By {{increasing the amount of}} bicarbonate excreted in the urine, the blood becomes more acidic. As the body equates acidity of the blood to its CO2 concentration, artificially acidifying the blood fools the body into thinking it has an excess of CO2, and it excretes this imaginary excess CO2 by deeper and faster breathing, which in turn increases the amount of oxygen in the blood. Acetazolamide is not an immediate cure for acute mountain sickness; rather, it speeds up part of the <b>acclimatization</b> process which in turn helps to relieve symptoms. Acetazolamide is still effective if started early in the course of mountain sickness. As prevention it is started one day before travel to altitude and continued for the first 2 days at altitude.|$|E
25|$|If humans move to {{a higher}} altitude, {{respiration}} and physical exertion become a problem, but after spending time in high altitude conditions they acclimatize to the reduced partial pressure of oxygen, such as by producing more red blood cells. The ability to acclimatize is an adaptation, but the <b>acclimatization</b> itself is not. Fecundity goes down, but deaths from some tropical diseases also goes down. Over {{a longer period of}} time, some people are better able to reproduce at high altitudes than others. They contribute more heavily to later generations, and gradually by natural selection the whole population becomes adapted to the new conditions. This has demonstrably occurred, as the observed performance of long-term communities at higher altitude is significantly better than the performance of new arrivals, even when the new arrivals have had time to acclimatize.|$|E
25|$|In Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World (1978), Girard {{develops}} {{the implications of}} this discovery. The victimary process is the missing link between the animal world and the human world, the principle that explains the humanization of primates. It allows us to understand the need for sacrificial victims, which in turn explains the hunt which is primitively ritual, and the domestication of animals as a fortuitous result of the <b>acclimatization</b> of a reserve of victims, or agriculture. It shows that at the beginning of all culture is archaic religion, which Durkheim had sensed. The elaboration of the rites and taboos by proto-human or human groups would take infinitely varied forms while obeying a rigorous practical sense that we can detect: the prevention of the return of the mimetic crisis. So we can find in archaic religion the origin of all political or cultural institutions.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{establishment}} of the Brisbane Showgrounds, or Exhibition Grounds, in 1876, the site was part of the Queensland Acclimatisation Society's grounds. In July 1863 this Society, established in 1862 to promote the introduction, <b>acclimatization,</b> propagation and distribution in Queensland of economically useful plants and animals, was granted 33 acres of land bounded by Bowen Bridge Road, O'Connell Terrace, Brookes Street and Gregory Terrace. At the northwestern corner of the site, fronting Bowen Bridge Road and O'Connell Terrace, the Society established a public exhibition garden Bowen Park. The remainder of the site was used for experimentation purposes, growing and propagating plants and seeds sent from other parts of Queensland, other colonies and around the world, and raising various introduced animals. The Society {{played an important role in}} the beginnings of commercial agriculture in Queensland, introducing or trialling crops and plants such as mango trees, ginger plants, sugar cane, olive trees and choko vines.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} single {{victory of}} the SNA-WSLF was a second assault on Jijiga in mid-September (the Battle of Jijiga), in which the demoralized Ethiopian troops withdrew from the town. The local defenders were {{no match for the}} assaulting Somalis and the Ethiopian military was forced to withdraw past the strategic strongpoint of the Marda Pass, halfway between Jijiga and Harar. By September Ethiopia was forced to admit that it controlled only about 10% of the Ogaden and that the Ethiopian defenders had been pushed back into the non-Somali areas of Harerge, Bale, and Sidamo. However, the Somalis were unable to press their advantage because of the high attrition on its tank battalions, constant Ethiopian air attacks on their supply lines, and the onset of the rainy season which made the dirt roads unusable. During that time, the Ethiopian government managed to raise and train a giant militia force 100,000 strong and integrated it into the regular fighting force. Also, since the Ethiopian army was a client of U.S weapons, hasty <b>acclimatization</b> to the new Warsaw Pact bloc weaponry took place.|$|E
25|$|Each {{mission was}} to {{be turned over to}} a secular clergy and all the common mission lands {{distributed}} amongst the native population within ten years after its founding, a policy that was based upon Spain's experience with the more advanced tribes in Mexico, Central America, and Peru. In time, it became apparent to the Rev. Serra and his associates that the natives on the northern frontier in Alta California required a much longer period of <b>acclimatization.</b> None of the California missions ever attained complete self-sufficiency, and required continued (albeit modest) financial support from mother Spain. Mission development was therefore financed out of El Fondo Piadoso de las Californias (The Pious Fund of the Californias, which originated in 1697 and consisted of voluntary donations from individuals and religious bodies in Mexico to members of the Society of Jesus) to enable the missionaries to propagate the Catholic Faith in the area then known as California. Starting with the onset of the Mexican War of Independence in 1810, this support largely disappeared, and missions and converts were left on their own. As of 1800, native labor had made up the backbone of the colonial economy.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of reasons for low sales outside Japan. One main reason is that it takes some time for the {{customers}} {{to get used to the}} idea of a washlet. Sales in Japan were also slow when the device was introduced in 1980, but after some <b>acclimatization,</b> sales improved significantly starting in 1985. Around 1990, 10% of Japanese households had a washlet, and this number increased greatly to over 50% in 2002. Toto expects a corresponding improvement in foreign sales within the next few years. Another reason is the lack of a power supply near the toilet. While virtually all Japanese washrooms have an electric outlet behind the toilet, many foreign bathrooms do not have a nearby outlet. In Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, the UK, and many other countries, high current electrical outlets installed in close proximity to water, or where persons may be wet, are prohibited by legally enforced codes due to health and safety reasons. Finally the outlet of the toilet (for S-type toilets) is max. 10 ~ 15cm from back wall but Japanese toilets need it to be at least 30cm so a S-type European toilet cannot be replaced easily with a Japanese toilet. They are also much more expensive than traditional Western toilets. Finally, in Europe, there is the competition of the traditional Western bidet; conversely, North Americans are not accustomed to any sort of bidet.|$|E
500|$|Ibrăileanu {{additionally}} credited the Moldavian faction, Kogălniceanu included, {{with having}} helped introduce spoken Romanian into the literary language, {{at a time}} when both Ion Heliade Rădulescu and successors of the Transylvanian School made use of the dialect prevalent in Orthodox and Greek-Catholic religious culture. This was in connection with Kogălniceanu's advocacy of pragmatic Westernization: [...] "Civilization never does banish the national ideas and habits, but rather improves them {{for the benefit of the}} nation in particular and of humanity in general". He was adverse to fast cultural reforms, stressing that <b>acclimatization</b> was always required.|$|E

The team's efforts at <b>acclimatization</b> were not helped when Bobby Moore was falsely accused of stealing the infamous [...] "Bogotá Bracelet".

500|$|Cacti can be {{propagated}} by seed, cuttings or grafting. Seed sown {{early in}} the year produces seedlings that benefit from a longer growing period. Seed is sown in a moist growing medium and then kept in a covered environment, until 7–10 days after germination, to avoid drying out. A very wet growing medium can cause both seeds and seedlings to rot. A temperature range of [...] is suggested for germination; soil temperatures of around [...] promote the best root growth. Low light levels are sufficient during germination, but afterwards semi-desert cacti need higher light levels to produce strong growth, although <b>acclimatization</b> is needed to conditions in a greenhouse, such as higher temperatures and strong sunlight.|$|E
500|$|Uric acid {{is by far}} {{the highest}} {{concentration}} antioxidant in human blood. [...] Uric acid (UA) is an antioxidant oxypurine produced from xanthine by the enzyme xanthine oxidase, and is an intermediate product of purine metabolism. In almost all land animals, urate oxidase further catalyzes the oxidation of uric acid to allantoin, but in humans and most higher primates, the urate oxidase gene is nonfunctional, so that UA is not further broken down. The evolutionary reasons for this loss of urate conversion to allantoin remain the topic of active speculation. The antioxidant effects of uric acid have led researchers to suggest this mutation was beneficial to early primates and humans. Studies of high altitude <b>acclimatization</b> support the hypothesis that urate acts as an antioxidant by mitigating the oxidative stress caused by high-altitude hypoxia.|$|E
