In the case of initial RTT of 150  msec cf. Figure  16), {{there is little or no}} difference in <b>actual</b> <b>average</b> RTT between the lower BW (i.e. 60 Mbps) and the higher BW (i.e., 350  msec). For fixed latency, minimizing the available BW increases the VM migration time and the <b>actual</b> <b>average</b> RTT significantly. The significance is more noticeable for low latency. For low BW, 60 Mbps, the <b>actual</b> <b>average</b> RTT is independent of the initial RTT. Regardless of the initial RTT, the <b>actual</b> <b>average</b> RTT reflects the same amount. For the high BW, 350 Mbps, the <b>actual</b> <b>average</b> RTT increases as the initial RTT increases. However, the amount of the RTT added to the initial RTT is not the same.|$|R

30|$|Due to the {{uncertainty}} and intermittency of wind power, when the dispatched power {{is less than}} the actual minimum output power, the output power of wind farm will be constant; when the predicted average output power is greater than the <b>actual</b> <b>average</b> output power, there will be a transient power sag; when the predicted average output power is between the <b>actual</b> <b>average</b> output power and the actual minimum output power, there may be a power sag which is related to the wind conditions. During power system restoration, a transient power sag represents uncertainty: it is difficult to precisely predict the start time and the duration of transient power sags.
