5|$|The {{agreement}} {{put an end}} to hostilities {{between the}} JNA and Slovene forces in the Ten-Day War. Slovenia and Croatia agreed to suspend activities stemming from their 25 June declarations of independence for a period of three months. The document also resolved border control and customs inspection issues regarding Slovenia's borders, resolved <b>air-traffic</b> <b>control</b> responsibility and mandated an exchange of prisoners of war. The Brioni Agreement also formed the basis for an observer mission to monitor implementation of the agreement in Slovenia. Eleven days after the agreement was made, the federal government pulled the JNA out of Slovenia. Conversely, the agreement made no mitigating impact on fighting in Croatia.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{receiving}} clearance, a non-standard terminology {{was used}} by <b>air-traffic</b> <b>control.</b> As {{he did not have}} authorization to use a localizer back-course approach, the captain should have requested a different approach. Instead, the crew opted to conduct a VOR approach without informing <b>air-traffic</b> <b>control.</b> Neither pilot had carried out instrument approach and landing at runway 07R, making them less familiar with this than their commonly used Runway 25. Another factor was that the SAS aircraft was forced to operate at the lowest-permissible safe speeds while closing in on the Cessna.|$|E

5|$|Fifteen {{minutes into}} the flight, the hijackers injured at least three people (possibly killing one), {{forcibly}} breached the cockpit, and overpowered the captain and first officer. Atta, an al-Qaeda member and licensed commercial pilot, took over the <b>controls.</b> <b>Air-traffic</b> controllers noticed the flight was in distress when the crew was no longer responding. They realized the flight had been hijacked when Mohamed Atta's announcements for passengers were transmitted to air traffic control. On board, flight attendants Amy Sweeney and Betty Ong contacted American Airlines, and provided information about the hijackers and injuries to passengers and crew.|$|R
40|$|Inter-connected objects, either via {{public or}} private {{networks}} are the near future of modern societies. Such inter-connected objects {{are referred to as}} Internet-of-Things (IoT) and/or Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). One example of such a system is based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The fleet of such vehicles are prophesied to take on multiple roles involving mundane to high-sensitive, such as, prompt pizza or shopping deliveries to your homes to battlefield deployment for reconnaissance and combat missions. Drones, as we refer to UAVs in this paper, either can operate individually (solo missions) or part of a fleet (group missions), with and without constant connection with the base station. The base station acts as the command centre to manage the activities of the drones. However, an independent, localised and effective fleet control is required, potentially based on swarm intelligence, for the reasons: 1) {{increase in the number of}} drone fleets, 2) number of drones in a fleet might be multiple of tens, 3) time-criticality in making decisions by such fleets in the wild, 4) potential communication congestions/lag, and 5) in some cases working in challenging terrains that hinders or mandates-limited communication with control centre (i. e., operations spanning long period of times or military usage of such fleets in enemy territory). This self-ware, mission-focused and independent fleet of drones that potential utilises swarm intelligence for a) <b>air-traffic</b> and/or flight <b>control</b> management, b) obstacle avoidance, c) self-preservation while maintaining the mission criteria, d) collaboration with other fleets in the wild (autonomously) and e) assuring the security, privacy and safety of physical (drones itself) and virtual (data, software) assets. In this paper, we investigate the challenges faced by fleet of drones and propose a potential course of action on how to overcome them.

25|$|The combat {{systems on}} board the carrier are {{controlled}} by LESORUB-E, the computer-aided action information system. It gathers data from the ship’s sensors and data links and creates comprehensive situation awareness. The CCS Mk II communication complex is installed for external communications and the Link II tactical data system enables integration into the Indian Navy’s network-centric operations. Modern launch and recovery systems are installed for handling different aircraft – the LUNA landing system for MiG-29Ks and the DAPS Landing system for Sea Harriers. The Resistor-E automated <b>air-traffic</b> <b>control</b> system has been installed, which provides assistance during approach, landing and short range navigation down to a distance of 30 metres short of flight deck to the pilots. Along with various other sub-systems, it provides navigation and flight data to ship-borne aircraft operating at long distances from the carrier.|$|E
25|$|On October 15, 2015, Runway 10R/28L was commissioned. The new 7,500-foot runway {{will be used}} almost {{exclusively}} for landings toward the east up until 10 p.m. daily. The runway will increase arrival and departure rates at O'Hare by about 25 percent in good weather, all while handling only 5 percent of all daytime flights annually {{over the next five}} years. However, the runway sits on the southernmost part of the airfield which aligns roughly with Irving Park Road in Bensenville. Since the runway is several miles from the passenger terminals, the average taxi time is estimated at about 20 minutes. The cost of the runway and a taxiway was $516 million, and they are being controlled by a new <b>air-traffic</b> <b>control</b> tower that cost $41 million to build, according to the FAA and the Chicago Department of Aviation.|$|E

2500|$|Building of the {{new airport}} started in April 1958 and lasted until 28 April 1962, when it was officially opened by President Josip Broz Tito.

2500|$|The flight {{engineer}} {{carried out a}} systems check, first from memory and then after consulting the flight manual. At this time, 19:20:42, the captain informed <b>air-traffic</b> <b>control</b> that he was experiencing nose-gear problems that, if not resolved {{by the time the}} aircraft reached minimum altitude, would force him to cancel the landing and divert to the designated alternate (McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas). This was the last transmission from Flight 933. The {{flight engineer}} conducted a manual check of the landing gear from the cockpit peephole, confirming it was down and locked. At this time, the aircraft had an elevation of 300 meters (1,000ft). The lowest speed that the pilots remembered was [...] with full flap extension.|$|E
2500|$|Its war-time {{facilities}} {{consisted of}} three tarmac runways in a standard R.A.F.

It possessed also a mix of 27 pan and spectacle dispersals, which were used to spread the aircraft around the site to make targeting of them more difficult {{in the event of an}} attack by the Luftwaffe, and air-raid shelters. The airfield was equipped with ground assault defensive concrete pill-boxes, 2 of them of the distinctive [...] "F.C. Construction" [...] (or [...] "Mushroom") type.

2500|$|The sky {{was dark}} and the pilots lacked any visual ground references.

While retaining use of the autopilot, the pilots reduced their speed to [...] at the request of <b>air-traffic</b> <b>control</b> at 19:07. At this point the pilots were working through the approach checklist. The captain halted the checklist at the point regarding the radio altimeter, as the aircraft was above its operational limit, and he wanted to control the plane's operation during further descent. At 19:11, the aircraft received permission to bear 180 degrees and descend to and maintain 1,000 meters (3,000ft) of altitude. Both navigational receivers were tuned to the ILS frequency.|$|E

The nose gear was showing an unsafe indication; should the flaps be extended fully without the nose gear down, a horn would blow, {{which could not be}} silenced without retracting the flaps. The captain recycled the gear, but the indicator light still showed an unsafe condition. Meanwhile, the first officer believed that the flaps were fully extended, and started reducing speed to [...] After the flight engineer confirmed that the nose gear was down and locked, the captain fully extended the flaps.|$|E

5000|$|A space {{elevator}} {{would present}} a navigational hazard, both to aircraft and spacecraft. Aircraft could be diverted by <b>air-traffic</b> <b>control</b> restrictions.

50|$|When {{designing}} a system, {{it is important}} to consider what the system should do when deadlines are not met.
