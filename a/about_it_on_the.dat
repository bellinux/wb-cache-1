And I talked about it to the papers, gay magazines, and it didn't wind up on the album with the cut-off date. I felt really badly about that. So he just handed me a CD and said, ‘Here are 10 tracks for the kids; tell me which one you like the best.’ I fell in love with 'Rock With U'." ...|$|E

2500|$|Various {{negligence}} {{cases were}} brought against the police by spectators {{who had been}} at the ground but had not been in the pens, and by people who watched the incident unfolding on television (or heard <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radio). A case, Alcock v Chief Constable of South Yorkshire Police [...] 1 A.C. 310, was eventually appealed to the Appellate Committee of the House of Lords and was an important milestone in the law of claims of secondary victims for negligently inflicted psychiatric injury. It was held that claimants who watched the disaster on television/listened on radio were not '' and their claims were rejected.|$|E
2500|$|In 1942, RHC-Azul {{gave her}} a program Yo no sé nada (I don't know anything!) to do the {{character}} La Chismosa again, and once more the government (Fulgencio Batista's first term) applied pressure to have it taken off the air. Much later, in 1946, she had a third chance. CMQ {{gave her a}} program Mejor que me calle (Better I shut up! [...] a line {{from one of her}} songs) in which her street character, Lengualisa, had a side-kick Mojito (Alexandro Lugo). When the government (Ramón Grau's second term) tried to bribe her, she talked <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> program!

2500|$|That year, Gunn {{published}} a second collection of occasional essays, Shelf Life, and his substantial Collected Poems, which David Biespiel {{hailed as a}} highlight of the century's poetry: [...] "Thom Gunn is a poet of 'comradely love.' Compassion has always been his domain and his work's principal emotion. If 20th century verse written in English {{can be seen as}} a battle between memory and voice - between the phenomena and its history, on the one hand, and the poet's conviction and feeling <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> other - then Gunn's importance lies in the accuracy with which he unifies the language and emotion of experience. You're not sure where one ends and the other starts. The result is that his poems find the limits of their imaginative territory and then push beyond that." [...] His final book of poetry was Boss Cupid (2000).|$|E
2500|$|The {{extent of}} popular {{support among the}} Lakota people for {{independence}} is unclear. Russell Means and Canupa Gluha Mani have claimed that some 13,000 Lakota, including 77% {{of the population of}} Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, have shown support for the Republic of Lakotah, and that the eight-member delegation which traveled to Washington, D.C. was only a portion of some 77 tribal elders and activists taking part in the movement. However, Rapid City Journal reporter Bill Harlan reported on his blog that [...] "most folks I talk to hadn't heard about the declaration. The ones who had heard the news, to a person, did not want to talk <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> record." [...] The Journal has also noted that [...] "there were no tribal presidents in the group which made the announcement, no one from the top ranks of any of the Lakota Sioux tribes." [...] Nanwica Kciji, an Oglala Lakota and first president of the Native American Journalists Association, has also discredited the December 2007 developments, arguing that the Lakotah Freedom Delegation [...] "never considered that treaties are made between nations and not individuals." ...|$|E
