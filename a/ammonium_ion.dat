40|$|An aluminovanadate {{oxynitride}} (AlVON) catalyst is synthesized. This catalyst {{is active}} in the Knoevenagel condensation reaction between malononitrile and benzaldehyde, showing that it has basic sites. DRIFT characterization has evidenced the presence of <b>ammonium</b> <b>ions</b> due to the neutralization by ammonia of hydroxyl Bronsted acid sites. Since the catalyst loses its basic activity when the <b>ammonium</b> <b>ions</b> are removed by thermal treatment, the hypothesis of a negatively charged oxygen,generated by the neutralization of the Bronsted acid hydroxyls by ammonia, like V-O- NH 4 +, is proposed as a basic center. This hypothesis is strengthened by three observations. (1) The inactive thermally treated AlVON recovers its catalytic activity when the <b>ammonium</b> <b>ions</b> are regenerated by gaseous ammonia adsorption. (2) When CDCl 3 adsorption is carried out at increasing pretreatment temperature of the AlVON, a linear correlation is obtained {{between the amount of}} deuterated chloroform adsorbed and the <b>ammonium</b> <b>ions</b> staying after thermal desorption.

(3) The oxide precursor that retains <b>ammonium</b> <b>ions</b> at the surface {{is active in}} the Knoevenagel condensation reaction.

25|$|Later in 2008–2010 new {{infrared}} spectroscopic observations with {{a higher}} signal-to-noise ratio revealed additional spectral features. Among them are a deep water ice absorption band at 1.65μm, which is an evidence of the crystalline water ice {{on the surface of}} Orcus, and a new absorption band at 2.22μm. The origin of the latter feature is not completely clear. It can be caused either by ammonia/ammonium dissolved in the water ice or by methane/ethane ices. The radiative transfer modeling showed that a mixture of water ice, tholins (as a darkening agent), ethane ice and <b>ammonium</b> <b>ion</b> (NH4+) provides the best match to the spectra, whereas a combination of water ice, tholins, methane ice and ammonia hydrate gives a slightly inferior result. On the other hand, a mixture of only ammonia hydrate, tholins and water ice failed to provide a satisfactory match. So, as of 2010, the only reliably identified compounds on the surface of Orcus are crystalline water ice and, possibly, dark tholins.
