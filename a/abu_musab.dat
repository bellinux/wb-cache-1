5|$|On 9 November 2005, Al-Qaeda under <b>Abu</b> <b>Musab</b> al-Zarqawi's {{leadership}} launched coordinated {{explosions in}} three hotel lobbies in Amman, resulting in 60 deaths and 115 injured. The bombings, which targeted civilians, caused widespread outrage among Jordanians.

5|$|Al-Balawi, 32, was a Jordanian {{doctor who}} worked at a clinic for Palestinian refugee women and {{children}} in the Marka refugee camp near Amman, Jordan. He was an al-Qaeda sympathizer from the town of Zarqa, the hometown of Jordanian militant Islamist <b>Abu</b> <b>Musab</b> al-Zarqawi. He was married and had two daughters. Islamist websites, as well as some newspapers, characterized the attacker as a triple agent, someone who is believed to be a double agent by the intelligence organization he infiltrates.|$|E

The bombings, which targeted civilians, caused widespread outrage among Jordanians. The attack {{is considered to}} be a rare event in the country, and Jordan's internal security was dramatically improved afterwards. No major terrorist attacks have occurred since then. Abdullah and Jordan are viewed with contempt by Islamic extremists for the country's peace treaty with Israel and its relationship with the West.|$|E
25|$|Abu Sufyan was {{the chief}} of the Banu Abd-Shams clan of the Quraysh, which {{made him one of the}} most {{powerful}} in Mecca. <b>Abu</b> Sufyan's brother <b>Musab</b> was among several Muslims who migrated to Abyssinia to escape persecution in Mecca.|$|R
5000|$|Timothy was {{a native}} of Hazza in Adiabene. As a young man, he studied under Abraham Bar Dashandad at the school of Bashisho in Sapsapa, in the Aqra district. He later became bishop of the diocese of Beth Bgash, in the {{metropolitan}} province of Adiabene, winning the respect of <b>Abu</b> Musa ibn <b>Musab,</b> the Moslem governor of Mosul, and his Christian secretary Abu Nuh al-Anbari. On the death of the patriarch Hnanisho II in 778, Timothy used a judicious mixture of bribery, deceit and (probably) murder to secure his own election as patriarch. One rival for the post was the elderly Ishoyahb, the superior of the monastery of Beth Abe, and Timothy first frightened him by advising him that he might not be fit enough to survive the intrigues of high office, but honored him by offering him the position of metropolitan of Adiabene. A second potential rival, Giwargis, was nominated at a synod convened by the bishop Thomas of Kashkar in the monastery of Mar Pethion in Baghdad. Giwargis enjoyed the support of the caliph al-Mahdi's Christian doctor Isa ibn Quraysh, and might have been a serious threat to Timothy had he not died suddenly in suspicious circumstances. Timothy then secured a majority in the subsequent ballot by promising to reward his supporters handsomely. After he was elected, he did nothing of the sort. Those who complained were told, 'The priesthood is not sold for money.' ...|$|R
25|$|The Jamestown Foundation {{considered}} <b>Abu</b> <b>Musab</b> al-Zarqawi and his Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad {{responsible for}} this attack.|$|E
25|$|<b>Abu</b> <b>Musab</b> al-Zarqawi, {{the leader}} of {{terrorist}} organization Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad, in April 2004 {{claimed responsibility for the}} 19 August blast.|$|E
25|$|Al-Oraydi was {{influenced}} by the teachings of Syrian jihadist <b>Abu</b> <b>Musab</b> al-Suri, who fought against the Syrian regime in the 1970s and '80s.|$|E
25|$|On May 7, 2004 Nick Berg, an American {{businessman}} {{who went to}} Iraq after the US Invasion, was captured and decapitated by the Islamist militant organization al-Ansars in response to Abu Ghraib. The masked man who carried out the execution {{is believed to have}} been <b>Abu</b> <b>Musab</b> al-Zarqawi.|$|E
25|$|Abu Ayyub al-Masri's al-Qaeda {{movement}} in Iraq regularly releases short videos glorifying {{the activity of}} jihadist suicide bombers. In addition, {{both before and after}} the death of <b>Abu</b> <b>Musab</b> al-Zarqawi (the former leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq), the umbrella organization to which al-Qaeda in Iraq belongs, the Mujahideen Shura Council, has a regular presence on the Web.|$|E
25|$|On 28 March 2008, Chérif {{was convicted}} of {{terrorism}} and sentenced {{to three years in}} prison, with 18 months suspended, for recruiting fighters for militant Islamist <b>Abu</b> <b>Musab</b> al-Zarqawi's group in Iraq. He said outrage at the torture of inmates by the US Army at Baghdad Central Prison in Abu Ghraib inspired him to help Iraq's insurgency.|$|E
25|$|There {{is little}} {{evidence}} of ongoing Hezbollah contact or cooperation with al-Qaeda. Hezbollah's leaders denies links to al-Qaeda, present or past. al-Qaeda's leaders, such as former Al-Qaeda in Iraq leader <b>Abu</b> <b>Musab</b> al-Zarqawi, consider Shia, which most Hezbollah members are, to be apostates, as do Salafi-jihadis today. However, the 9/11 Commission Report found that several Al-Qaeda operatives and top military commanders were sent to Hezbollah training camps in Lebanon in 1994.|$|E
25|$|Fifty-eight years later, on April 21, 2003, Time {{released}} {{another issue}} {{with a red}} X over Saddam Hussein's face, {{two weeks after the}} invasion. On June 13, 2006, Time magazine printed a red X cover issue following the death of <b>Abu</b> <b>Musab</b> al-Zarqawi in a U.S. airstrike in Iraq. The most recent red X cover issue of Time was published on May 2, 2011, after the death of Osama bin Laden.|$|E
25|$|Following the U.S. {{invasion}} of Iraq {{as part of}} the George W. Bush administration's post 9/11 foreign policy, many foreign Mujahideen joined several Sunni militant groups resisting the U.S. occupation of Iraq. A considerable part of the insurgents did not come from Iraq but instead from many other Arab countries, notably Jordan and Saudi Arabia. Among these recruits was <b>Abu</b> <b>Musab</b> al-Zarqawi, a Jordanian national who would go on to assume the leadership of Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI).|$|E
25|$|U.S. marines encircled Fallujah with an earth wall, {{trying to}} control access to the city, {{allowing}} only women and children to leave the city. On 19 June 2004, twenty two Iraqis, among them women and children, {{were killed in a}} U.S. air strike on a residential neighborhood. Allawi condemned the rebellion and called upon the city to surrender <b>Abu</b> <b>Musab</b> al-Zarqawi, the leader of the Tawhid-e-Jihad group who is alleged to be hiding in Fallujah, or face aerial bombing by the United States.|$|E
25|$|The US {{government}} {{presents the}} case differently. It says that U.S. military forces, operating in Iraq pursuant to U.N. Security Council Resolutions 1546 (2003) and 1637 (2004) {{as part of}} the Multi-National Force-Iraq (MNF-I), captured Omar during a raid on associates of <b>Abu</b> <b>Musab</b> al-Zarqawi. The government concluded that Omar was part of Zarqawi's network and that he facilitated terrorist activities both in and outside of Iraq. Four Jordanian foreign fighters and an Iraqi insurgent were captured along with Omar, and weapons and improvised explosive device (IED)-making materials were found in Omar's home.|$|E
25|$|In addition, the Kurdish Islamist {{militant group}} Ansar al-Islam {{controlled}} a small section of northern Iraq {{in an area}} outside of Saddam Hussein's control. Ansar al-Islam had been fighting against secular Kurdish forces since 2001. At {{the time of the}} invasion they fielded about 600 to 800 fighters. Ansar al-Islam was led by the Jordanian-born militant <b>Abu</b> <b>Musab</b> al-Zarqawi, who would later become an important leader in the Iraqi insurgency. Ansar al-Islam was driven out of Iraq in late March by a joint American-Kurdish force during Operation Viking Hammer.|$|E
25|$|In 1970, Amman was a {{battlefield}} during {{the conflict between}} the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Jordanian Army known as Black September. The Jordanian Army defeated the PLO in 1971, and the latter were expelled to Lebanon. On 9 November 2005, Al-Qaeda under <b>Abu</b> <b>Musab</b> al-Zarqawi's leadership launched coordinated explosions in three hotel lobbies in Amman, resulting in 60 deaths and 115 injured. The bombings, which targeted civilians, caused widespread outrage among Jordanians. Jordan's security as a whole was dramatically improved after the attack, and no major terrorist attacks have been reported since then.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} no ricin had been found was known to some {{government}} departments very early on, but this information was not revealed to the public until after Bourgass's trial two years later, although in the interim it was cited as evidence for further terrorism laws, as well as featuring in US Secretary of State Colin Powell's 5 February 2003 speech to the UN to build {{the case for the}} 2003 invasion of Iraq, as part of the alleged <b>Abu</b> <b>Musab</b> al-Zarqawi global terrorist network. As late as February 2006, Chancellor Gordon Brown described it as a significant terrorism plot spanning 26 countries.|$|E
25|$|During {{the month}} of September, {{negotiations}} with local commanders produced a city council which was to govern the city. However, insurgents soon seized control and the agreement fell apart. The city government was infiltrated by insurgents and the city came {{under the control of}} the Iraqi insurgency. Fighters loyal to the insurgents, including but not particularly <b>Abu</b> <b>Musab</b> Zarqawi, roamed the streets, confiscating music cassette tapes, which were condemned as haram. Attacks on American and Iraqi forces in the vicinity of the city greatly increased. American commanders decided to re-take the city as a precursor to the upcoming battle to retake Fallujah.|$|E
25|$|Some Wahabi groups, often labeled as takfiri and {{sometimes}} linked to Al-Qaeda, have even advocated {{the persecution of}} the Shia as heretics. Such groups have been allegedly responsible for violent attacks and suicide bombings at Shi'a gatherings at mosques and shrines, most notably in Iraq during the Ashura mourning ceremonies where hundreds of Shias were killed in coordinated suicide bombings, but also in Pakistan and Afghanistan. However, in a video message, Al-Qaeda deputy Dr Ayman al-Zawahiri directed <b>Abu</b> <b>Musab</b> al-Zarqawi, of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, not to attack civilian targets but {{to focus on the}} occupation troops. His call seems to have been ignored, or swept away in the increasing tensions of Iraq under occupation.|$|E
25|$|Stanley Allen McChrystal (born August 14, 1954) is {{a retired}} United States Army general {{best known for his}} command of Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) in the mid-2000s. His last {{assignment}} was as Commander, International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and Commander, U.S. Forces Afghanistan (USFOR-A). He previously served as Director, Joint Staff from August 2008 to June 2009 and as Commander of JSOC from 2003 to 2008, where he was credited with the death of <b>Abu</b> <b>Musab</b> al-Zarqawi, leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq, but also criticized for his alleged role in the cover-up of the Pat Tillman friendly fire incident. McChrystal was reportedly known for saying and thinking what other military leaders were afraid to; {{this was one of the}} reasons cited for his appointment to lead all forces in Afghanistan. He held the post from June 15, 2009, to June 23, 2010.|$|E
25|$|The Information Minister {{suggested}} that Al-Shabaab {{had intended to}} hold up the Makka al-Mukarama hotel for days and kill many civilians as they had previously done at the Westgate shopping mall in Nairobi in 2013, but Somali government forces succeeded in quashing their plans. The hotel's owner Gurey Abdi Hassan partly blamed Hodan district officials and state forces for the attack. He indicated that the local Hodan district commissioner had ignored his request to set up a security checkpoint in the hotel's rear, while simultaneously providing lax security despite the premises having been attacked three times before. Al-Shabaab concurrently claimed responsibility for the raid, with the group's spokesman Sheikh Ali Mahamud Rage emailing that some militants had survived the attack and escaped the scene. Al Shabaab's military operations spokesman Abdiasis <b>Abu</b> <b>Musab</b> also indicated that the insurgents were targeting government officials only and had left civilians unharmed. Government forces displayed the bodies of the slain militants at a press gathering, deeming the counter-terrorist operation a success.|$|E
500|$|American and Israeli {{counter-terrorism}} officials {{claim that}} Hezbollah has (or had) links to Al Qaeda, although Hezbollah's leaders deny these allegations. Also, some al-Qaeda leaders, like <b>Abu</b> <b>Musab</b> al-Zarqawi and Wahhabi clerics, consider Hezbollah to be apostate. But United States intelligence officials speculate {{that there has}} been contact between Hezbollah and low-level al-Qaeda figures who fled Afghanistan for Lebanon. However, Michel Samaha, Lebanon's minister of information, has said that Hezbollah has been an important ally of the government in the war against terrorist groups, and described the [...] "American attempt to link Hezbollah to al-Qaeda" [...] to be [...] "astonishing".|$|E
500|$|Attempting {{to emulate}} the {{perceived}} success in Fallujah, US commanders in Ramadi responded to the 28 June transfer of sovereignty from the CPA to the Iraqi Interim Government by pulling most forces back to camps outside the city and focusing on securing a highway that ran through its center. Fighting continued to escalate throughout Anbar Province. On 21 June, a four-man Scout Sniper team operating with 2nd Battalion 4th Marines in Ramadi was executed {{by a group of}} insurgents who had infiltrated their observation post. In mid-July, General Mattis predicted that Anbar would [...] " [...] to hell" [...] if the Marines could not hold Ramadi. On 5 August, Anbar Provincial Governor Abd al-Karim Barjas resigned following the kidnapping of his two sons by <b>Abu</b> <b>Musab</b> al-Zarqawi. Barjas appeared on television and publicly apologized for [...] "cooperation with the infidel". He was replaced by an interim governor until January 2005. The head of the Ramadi police force was subsequently arrested for complicity with the kidnappings.|$|E
500|$|Conditions in Anbar {{particularly}} favored an insurgency. The province was overwhelmingly Sunni, {{the minority}} religious group that lost {{its power and}} influence in post-Saddam Hussein Iraq. Hussein was also very popular in the province {{than anywhere else in}} the country. Many did not fight during the invasion (allowing them to claim that they had not been defeated) and [...] "still wanted to slug it out", according to journalist Tom Ricks. Military service was compulsory in Saddam's Iraq and the Amiriyah area contained a sizeable portion of Iraq's arms industry. Immediately after Saddam fell, insurgents and others looted many of the 96 known munitions sites, as well as local armories and weapons stockpiles. [...] These weapons were used to arm the insurgents in Anbar and elsewhere. While only a small minority of Sunnis were initially insurgents, many either supported or tolerated them. Sympathetic Ba'athists and former Saddam officials in Syrian exile provided money, sanctuary, and foreign fighters to insurgent groups. Future al-Qaeda in Iraq leader <b>Abu</b> <b>Musab</b> al-Zarqawi spent part of 2002 in central Iraq, including Anbar Province, preparing for resistance. [...] Within several months of the invasion the province had become a sanctuary for anti-occupation fighters.|$|E

Later, Powter decided to give him {{permission}} to record the parody, which {{was to have been}} called [...] "You Had a Bad Date", but was told by Yankovic told that [...] "the train had left the station"; he had recorded [...] "White & Nerdy" [...] the day before instead. In April 2006, [...] "Bad Day" [...] was parodied on an episode of the television series Saturday Night Live, featuring a montage of former member of the United States House of Representatives Tom DeLay. The Daily Show used the song for an American Idol-based montage satirizing the June 2006 death of <b>Abu</b> <b>Musab</b> al-Zarqawi, leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq. It was parodied by comedy group Moron Life titled [...] "Overplayed" [...] and was released on MySpace in August 2006. [...] "Bad Day" [...] was also covered by the fictional music group Alvin and the Chipmunks for their 2007 film Alvin and the Chipmunks. Their version made the charts in January 2008, peaking at number 67 on the Billboard Hot 100.|$|E

In 2002, Willis's then 8-year-old daughter, Tallulah, suggested that he purchase Girl Scout cookies to send to troops. Willis purchased 12,000 boxes of cookies, and they were distributed to sailors aboard USS John F. Kennedy and other troops stationed throughout the Middle East at the time. In 2003, Willis visited Iraq {{as part of the}} USO tour, singing to the troops with his band, The Accelerators. Willis considered joining the military to help fight the second Iraq war, but was deterred by his age. It was believed he offered $1 million to any noncombatant who turns in terrorist leaders Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, or <b>Abu</b> <b>Musab</b> al-Zarqawi; in the June 2007 issue of Vanity Fair, however, he clarified that the statement was made hypothetically and not meant to be taken literally. Willis has also criticized the media for its coverage of the war, complaining that the press were more likely to focus on the negative aspects of the war: ...|$|E
