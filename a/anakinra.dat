5|$|A {{number of}} new {{medications}} are under study for treating gout, including <b>anakinra,</b> canakinumab and rilonacept. Canakinumab may result in better outcomes than a low dose of a steroid but costs five thousand times more. A recombinant uricase enzyme (rasburicase) is available; its use, however, is limited, as it triggers an immune response. Less antigenic versions are in development.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{drugs are}} considered as DMARDs: methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, TNF-alpha inhibitors (certolizumab, infliximab and etanercept), abatacept, and <b>anakinra.</b> Rituximab and tocilizumab are monoclonal antibodies {{and are also}} DMARDs.|$|E
2500|$|Biological agents should {{generally}} {{only be used}} if methotrexate {{and other}} conventional agents are not effective after a trial of three months. [...] They {{are associated with a}} higher rate of serious infections as compared to other DMARDs. [...] Biological DMARD agents used to treat rheumatoid arthritis include: tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) blockers such as infliximab; interleukin 1 blockers such as <b>anakinra,</b> monoclonal antibodies against B cells such as rituximab, and tocilizumab T cell co-stimulation blocker such as abatacept. They are often used in combination with either methotrexate or leflunomide. Abatacept should not be used {{at the same time as}} other biologics. In those who are well controlled on TNF blockers decreasing the dose does not appear to affect overall function. Persons should be screened for latent tuberculosis before starting any TNF blockers therapy to avoid reactivation.|$|E
50|$|Live-virus {{vaccines}} {{should not}} be given to patients during <b>anakinra</b> treatment. Information is not available, if <b>anakinra</b> would affect the rate of secondary transmission of vaccine virus (e.g., measles or poliomyelitis viruses) following administration of a live virus vaccine or regarding any other effect of vaccination on patients receiving the drug. Due {{to the fact that}} <b>anakinra</b> decreases the immune response to antigens in general, vaccine efficacy may be reduced in patients receiving <b>anakinra.</b>|$|E
50|$|An {{increased}} {{incidence of}} serious infections {{and an increased}} risk of neutropenia have been seen when <b>anakinra</b> and etanercept were used concomitantly in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Similar interactions can be anticipated for the combination therapy of <b>anakinra</b> together with other agents blocking TNF (alpha) (e.g., adalimumab, infliximab). Therefore, combined drug therapy with <b>anakinra</b> and any TNF-blocking agent is not recommended and should be avoided. Moreover, in a 24-week clinical study a regime with <b>anakinra</b> and etanercept did not provide any additional benefit to the patients.|$|E
50|$|Neutrophil counts {{should be}} {{assessed}} prior to initiating <b>anakinra</b> treatment, and while receiving <b>anakinra,</b> monthly for 3 months, and thereafter quarterly {{for a period}} up to 1 year.|$|E
50|$|Due to the {{specific}} mechanism of action of <b>anakinra,</b> a possible efficiency may be anticipated in patients with inflammatory joint diseases such as psoriatic arthritis, and spondylarthritis. Possibly, <b>anakinra</b> may even benefit patients with destructive osteoarthritis in inflammatory phases. Clinical studies have not been initiated so far regarding these diseases. Currently, the use of <b>anakinra</b> in these patients is therefore not recommended.|$|E
50|$|It {{should not}} be used in {{combination}} with <b>anakinra</b> or TNF antagonists. Because abatacept, <b>anakinra,</b> and TNF antagonists suppress the immune system, using them in combination may significantly increase the risk for severe infections.|$|E
5000|$|As well {{as being}} more effective, <b>anakinra</b> is safer than the other {{treatments}} available for Schnitzler's syndrome. The Cochrane review entitled, ‘Anakinra for rheumatoid arthritis’ (Mertens and Singh, 2009 [...] ) evaluates the (clinical effectiveness and) safety of <b>anakinra</b> in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis, using data from 2876 patients, from five trials which constituted 781 randomized to placebo and 2065 to <b>anakinra.</b> The authors conclude, “There were {{no statistically significant differences}} noted in most safety outcomes with treatment with <b>anakinra</b> versus placebo - including number of withdrawals, deaths, adverse events (total and serious), and infections (total and serious). Injection site reactions were significantly increased, occurring in 1235/1729 (71%) versus 204/729 (28%) of patients treated with <b>anakinra</b> versus placebo, respectively”. These injection site reactions last for no more than four months, and are trivial compared to the very debilitating symptoms of Schnitzler's syndrome.|$|E
5000|$|Blood {{and blood}} forming organs : Frequently, {{decrease}} in neutrophil counts (8% under <b>anakinra,</b> placebo 2%), infrequent significant neutropenia (0.4% under <b>anakinra),</b> moderate eosinophilia, moderately low platelet count, and malignant lymphomas (0.12 cases/100 patient years) (see malignancies).|$|E
5000|$|Treatment {{with either}} glucocorticoids, methotrexate, <b>anakinra,</b> or tocilizumab has been examined. <b>Anakinra</b> {{has been shown}} to resolve the {{clinical}} features of the disease in 87% of patients. It also induces remission in half of corticosteroid-resistant patients. The results of another study were similar, with half of the patients responding to treatment with <b>Anakinra.</b> [...] Canakinumab, an antibody to interleukin-1 beta, is indicated for treatment in patients who respond poorly to other treatments.|$|E
50|$|On April 12, 2007 {{an article}} in the New England Journal of Medicine {{discussed}} the possibility of using <b>anakinra</b> for treatment of type 2 diabetes. A few studies have looked at the effectiveness of <b>anakinra</b> in some familial periodic fever syndromes.|$|E
50|$|The Cochrane Collaboration (www.cochrane.org) is an {{independent}} body which produces systematic literature reviews to a high academic standard. The Cochrane review entitled, ‘Anakinra for rheumatoid arthritis’ (Mertens and Singh, 2009; http://mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clsysrev/articles/CD005121/pdf_standard_fs.html) evaluates the clinical effectiveness and safety of <b>anakinra</b> in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis, using data from 2876 patients, from five trials which constituted in total 781 randomized to placebo and 2065 to <b>anakinra.</b> The authors conclude, “There were {{no statistically significant differences}} noted in most safety outcomes with treatment with <b>anakinra</b> versus placebo - including number of withdrawals, deaths, adverse events (total and serious), and infections (total and serious).

These injection site reactions last for no more than four months and are not serious. Each of the trials reviewed measured prevalence of malignancies and found no evidence that these are increased amongst patients taking <b>anakinra.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Anakinra</b> had an {{absolute}} bioavailability of 95% for healthy adults (n = 11) after a 70 mg subcutaneous bolus injection. Peak plasma concentrations of <b>anakinra</b> generally occurred 3 to 7 hours after s.c. administration of clinically relevant doses (1 to 2 mg/kg: n = 18) {{for patients with}} rheumatoid arthritis. The terminal half-life ranged from 4 to 6 hours. After daily s.c. dosing for up to 24 weeks, no unexpected accumulations of <b>anakinra</b> were observed in the plasma samples of rheumatoid arthritis patients.|$|E
5000|$|Because Schnitzler's {{syndrome}} is so rare, {{the efficacy of}} different treatments cannot be compared using statistics. Nevertheless, case studies provide evidence that <b>anakinra</b> (otherwise known as kineret) is much more effective for Schnitzler's syndrome than any other drug, and that the improvement in symptoms associated with this treatment is dramatic. For example, Beseda and Nossent (2010) [...] reviewed the literature concerning IL1-RA treatment (i.e. <b>anakinra)</b> for Schnitzler's syndrome. They concluded that, “Twenty-four patients with Schnitzler's syndrome... have been successfully treated with anakinra.” They add that “seven out of seven patients Schnitzler’s syndrome, that either interrupted or used <b>anakinra</b> every other day, had relapse of their symptoms within 24-48 h; <b>anakinra</b> was restarted in all patients with the same clinical efficiency.” Kluger et al. (2008) investigated the effectiveness of <b>anakinra</b> {{for a range of}} conditions. They searched MEDLINE for English-language trials of <b>anakinra</b> and abstracts from rheumatologial scientific meetings. They conclude that, “Over the last few years it has become increasingly evident that <b>anakinra</b> is highly effective and safe in patients with ... Schnitzler’s syndrome”. The year before, De Koning et al. (2007) [...] reviewed the disease characteristics of Schnitzler syndrome and collected follow-up information to gain insight into long-term prognosis and treatment efficacy. They used data from 94 patients, and their conclusions about treatment for the condition are that, “There have been promising developments in therapeutic options, especially antiinterleukin-1 treatment, which induced complete remission in all 8 patients treated so far.” ...|$|E
5000|$|There are {{no direct}} studies {{comparing}} <b>anakinra</b> with TNF-α inhibitors, but indirect data suggests that <b>anakinra</b> may be inferior to TNF-α inhibitors. [...] In a study with infliximab plus methotrexate 50% of all patients had significant remission (according {{to at least}} ACR 20 criteria) after a 30-week treatment period.|$|E
5000|$|A 2005 article {{published}} in Arthritis & Rheumatism reported rapid improvement in four patients with Adult-Onset Still's Disease who were treated with <b>Anakinra.</b> Authors of a 2012 review {{article published}} in the International Journal of Inflammation concluded that [...] "a growing number of evidences supports the utilisation of <b>anakinra</b> in Adult-Onset Still's Disease".|$|E
50|$|In {{patients}} receiving <b>anakinra</b> {{a decrease in}} neutrophil counts may be found. In the placebo-controlled studies 8% of {{patients receiving}} <b>anakinra</b> had decreases in neutrophil counts of at least 1 World Health Organization (WHO) toxicity grade compared with 2% in the placebo control group. Anakinra-treated patients experienced defined neutropenia (ANC < 1 x 109/L) in 0.4%.|$|E
5000|$|In July 2012, the University of Manchester {{scientists}} {{have demonstrated the}} effectiveness of the drug <b>Anakinra</b> (IL-1Ra), which is already used for rheumatoid arthritis in experimental studies of stroke: MRI scans revealed that the rats that were given IL-1Ra (<b>Anakinra)</b> up to three hours after the stroke, had only about half the brain damage of the placebo group. (http://medicalxpress.com/news/2012-07-treatments-reality.html) ...|$|E
5000|$|On May 2, 2008 {{an article}} in the review Science {{discussed}} the possibility of using <b>anakinra</b> for treatment of asbestosis."Since <b>Anakinra</b> (IL-1ra) is efficiently used in the clinical treatment of autoinflammatorysyndromes as well as gout patients, the present study suggests a potential use ofAnakinra in order to slow down progression of asbestosis, silicosis and possibly otherinflammatory lung diseases." ...|$|E
5000|$|Reports of {{individual}} patients treated with <b>anakinra</b> illustrate its effectiveness. Beseda and Nossent (ibid.) report treating a longstanding multidrug resistant Schnitzler’s syndrome patient with anakinra: “Within 24 h {{after the first}} injection, both the urticaria and the fever disappeared and have not recurred. For the past 6 months, the patient has been in clinical and biochemical remission.” Other authors report “a complete resolution of symptoms” (Dybowski et al., 2008). Crouch et al. (2007) [...] report the effective treatment of a 52-year-old {{man who had been}} diagnosed with Schnitzler’s syndrome 8 years earlier: “On review, one week later, the patient’s systemic symptoms had resolved, and his previously elevated white cell count and inflammatory markers had normalised. The use of <b>anakinra</b> in our patient resulted in resolution of symptoms and has enabled cessation of oral prednisolone. Our patient remains symptom free on <b>anakinra</b> after 14 months of follow-up”. Similar stories are reported by Frischmeyer-Guerrerio et al. (2008), Wastiaux et al. (2007), and Eiling et al. (2007), Schneider et al. (2007). De Koning et al. (2006) [...] treated three patients with Schnitzler’s syndrome with thalidomide and <b>anakinra.</b> Thalidomide was only effective for one of the three patients and was discontinued because of polyneuropathy. In contrast, for all three patients, <b>anakinra</b> “led to disappearance of fever and skin lesions within 24 hours. After a follow-up of 16-18 months, all patients are free of symptoms”. The authors concluded that <b>anakinra</b> as a treatment for Schnitzler’s syndrome “is preferable to thalidomide... as it has fewer side effects”.|$|E

50|$|<b>Anakinra</b> showed {{moderate}} but {{statistically significant}} therapeutic efficacy; in most studies methotrexate was administered concomitantly. In the methotrexate plus <b>anakinra</b> group 38% of 250 patients reached an improvement/relief of symptoms {{of at least}} 20% within 24 weeks. In the control group of 251 patients under methotrexate treatment alone response was seen in 22% only. The clinical response was measured according to ACR-criteria (20, 50, and 70).|$|E

50|$|The Nijmegen ME/CFS centre is {{starting}} a RCT {{to study the}} effects of <b>Anakinra</b> treatment in 46 female ME/CFS patients.|$|E
50|$|Methotrexate {{has been}} coadministered with <b>anakinra</b> in quite {{extended}} clinical studies. Neither specific drug interactions nor increased toxicity of <b>anakinra</b> and/or methotrexate have been noticed. In animal models (rats) studying {{the effects of}} both drugs when coadminstered, no effects on clearing of both drugs form plasma or on the respective toxicologic properties have been seen.

50|$|<b>Anakinra</b> may be {{effective}} in pediatric patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), also known as Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) or Still's Disease.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 5-10% of FMF {{cases are}} {{resistant}} to colchicine therapy alone. In these cases, adding <b>anakinra</b> to the daily colchicine regimen has been successful.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Anakinra</b> is a {{recombinant}} {{version of}} the interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL1-RA). <b>Anakinra</b> differs from native human IL-1Ra in that it has {{the addition of a}} single methionine residue at its amino terminus [...] <b>Anakinra</b> blocks the biologic activity of naturally occurring IL-1, including inflammation and cartilage degradation associated with rheumatoid arthritis, by competitively inhibiting the binding of IL-1 to the Interleukin-1 type receptor, which is expressed in many tissues and organs. IL-1 is produced in response to inflammatory stimuli and mediates various physiologic responses, including inflammatory and immunologic reactions. IL-1 additionally stimulates bone resorption and induces tissue damage like cartilage degradation as a result of loss of proteoglycans. In patients with rheumatoid arthritis the natural IL-1 receptor antagonist is not found in effective concentrations in synovium and synovial fluid to counteract the elevated IL-1 concentrations in these patients.|$|E
50|$|<b>Anakinra</b> (brand name Kineret) {{is a drug}} used {{to treat}} {{rheumatoid}} arthritis. It is an interleukin 1 (IL1) receptor antagonist. It is produced by Swedish Orphan Biovitrum.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Anakinra</b> is {{indicated}} {{for the management}} of signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and to inhibit the progression of structural damage associated with the disease in adults with moderately to severely active disease who have had an absence of clinical improvement of symptoms or inadequate response in therapy with one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). It is used as monotherapeutic agent or in combination with DMARDs. <b>Anakinra</b> should not be used in combination with anti-TNF agents such as etanercept (Enbrel), infliximab (Remicade) or adalimumab (Humira).First EU approval 8 March 2002 : ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Anakinra</b> is not {{considered}} a 'disease-modifying antirheumatic drug' (DMARD) but rather a 'biological response modifier' (BRM) because it is selectively able to target the pathologic element of the disease.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{drugs are}} considered as DMARDs: methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, TNF-alpha inhibitors (certolizumab, infliximab and etanercept), abatacept, and <b>anakinra.</b> Rituximab and tocilizumab are monoclonal antibodies {{and are also}} DMARDs.|$|E
