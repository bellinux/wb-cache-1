Strips of herbal rejuvenator capsules were sold {{along with the}} film's music cassettes. Before the film's release, Rahman asked Ravikumar if the soundtrack could be released in August 1999. Ravikumar informed Rahman that he had <b>already</b> <b>discussed</b> a release date with the press, and that Rahman would be blamed for any delay. To make the deadline, Rahman did a live re-recording of both the soundtrack and score to finish them on time.|$|E

This is also called gustatolacrimal reflex or Bogorad's Syndrome and involves the sufferer shedding tears while eating. This is thought to be due to faulty regeneration of the facial nerve, a branch of which controls the lacrimal and salivary glands. Gustatorial sweating can also occur.|$|E

However, few studies provide in-depth empirical analyses of how innovators and managers actually can using this form of reasoning, so more research into the day-to-day innovation practices in complex innovation eco-systems is needed.|$|R
25|$|The {{differential}} analyser, {{a mechanical}} analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration, used wheel-and-disc mechanisms {{to perform the}} integration. In 1876 James Thomson had <b>already</b> <b>discussed</b> the possible construction of such calculators, {{but he had been}} stymied by the limited output torque of the ball-and-disk integrators. In a differential analyzer, the output of one integrator drove the input of the next integrator, or a graphing output. The torque amplifier was the advance that allowed these machines to work. Starting in the 1920s, Vannevar Bush and others developed mechanical differential analyzers.|$|E

AAFC owners had <b>already</b> <b>discussed</b> merging with the National Football League (NFL) the previous year, and most teams in both leagues were losing money. The talks fell apart, however, when the owners could not agree on which of the AAFC's teams would join the NFL. As the league faltered, Brown entertained but ultimately declined offers to leave the Browns and return to Ohio State University, where he had coached in the early 1940s.|$|E

His son John Mor (II) MacDonnell (executed 1499), the 3rd Lord of Dunnyveg, also lived his life in Scotland, but his son was the Alexander Carragh <b>already</b> <b>discussed,</b> evidently responsible for completely ousting the Bissetts in the Glens in the 1520s or not long after.|$|E

25|$|After a {{few years}} of peace came the first of three wars between France and the Empire. The {{aggressive}} policy pursued by Louis XIV towards the Dutch Republic had aroused the serious attention of Europe, and steps had been taken to check it. Although the French king had sought the alliance of several German princes and encouraged the Ottomans in their attacks on Austria the Emperor at first took no part in this movement. He was on friendly terms with Louis, to whom he was closely related and with whom he had <b>already</b> <b>discussed</b> the partition of the lands of the Spanish monarchy. Moreover, in 1671, he arranged with him a treaty of neutrality.|$|E
25|$|During the 19th and 20th centuries, materialistic monism {{became the}} norm. Still, in {{addition}} to <b>already</b> <b>discussed</b> theories of dualism (particularly the Christian and Cartesian models) there are new theories {{in the defense of}} dualism. Naturalistic dualism comes from Australian philosopher, David Chalmers (born 1966) who argues there is an explanatory gap between objective and subjective experience that cannot be bridged by reductionism because consciousness is, at least, logically autonomous of the physical properties upon which it supervenes. According to Chalmers, a naturalistic account of property dualism requires a new fundamental category of properties described by new laws of supervenience; the challenge being analogous to that of understanding electricity based on the mechanistic and Newtonian models of materialism prior to Maxwell's equations.|$|E
25|$|Harry Sherman was a {{director}} of Shermans Pools Ltd of Cardiff, a football pools promoter. The post-war paper-shortage had led the government to make an allocation of paper to the Football Pool Promoters' Association and to leave the association to share it among its members. Sherman believed his share to be unjust and took every opportunity to canvass anyone who could influence his case or find him an alternative source. However, Sherman's record of complaints of his misconduct in a closely regulated industry led the Board of Trade to start a prosecution against the company in January 1948. The magistrate who heard the case died before giving judgment and Sherman and his legal team galvanised into action to prevent a new hearing. Belcher was the minister responsible and was inundated with protests. Stanley contacted Sherman sometime in May, claiming to have <b>already</b> <b>discussed</b> the paper problems with Sherman's brother.|$|E

25|$|The {{existence}} of two supplementary functions, D and E, {{have also been}} proposed {{in addition to the}} A, B and C functions <b>already</b> <b>discussed.</b> Function D specifies the identity of the ovule, as a separate reproductive function from the development of the carpels, which occurs after their determination. Function E relates to a physiological requirement that is a characteristic of all floral verticils, although, it was initially described as necessary {{for the development of the}} three innermost verticils (Function E sensu stricto). However, its broader definition (sensu lato) suggests that it is required in the four verticils. Therefore, when Function D is lost the structure of the ovules becomes similar to that of leaves and when Function E is lost sensu stricto, the floral organs of the three outer most verticils are transformed into sepals, while on losing Function E sensu lato, all the verticils are similar to leaves. It is interesting to note that the gene products of genes with D and E functions are also MADS-box genes.|$|E

500|$|Mendes {{found that}} he still had to {{convince}} DreamWorks' production executives to let him direct. He had <b>already</b> <b>discussed</b> the film with Jinks and Cohen, and felt they supported him. Ball was also keen; having seen Cabaret, he was impressed with Mendes' [...] "keen visual sense" [...] and thought he did not make obvious choices. Ball felt that Mendes liked to look under the story's surface, a talent he felt {{would be a good}} fit with the themes of American Beauty. Mendes' background also reassured him, because of the prominent role the playwright usually has in a theater production. Over two meetings—the first with Cooper, Walter Parkes, and Laurie MacDonald, the second with Cooper alone—Mendes pitched himself to the studio. The studio soon approached Mendes with a deal to direct for the minimum salary allowed under Directors Guild of America rules—$150,000. Mendes accepted, and later recalled that after taxes and his agent's commission, he only earned $38,000. In June 1998, DreamWorks confirmed that it had contracted Mendes to direct the film.|$|E

The gavaksha (decorative arch) on the northern and southern sides are royal court and sikshadana scenes, with a balustraded window on each side. The frames of the windows are decorated with scrollwork, jaliwork, playing boys, floral designs, creepers and dancing women. The structure is topped with a pyramidal shikhara.
