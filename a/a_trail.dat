It occurs in rotating circular saws under idling conditions and may be called the circular saw whistle. Under load conditions, blade vibration plays a role which is not addressed here.|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, the Lackawanna River Watershed Conservation Plan {{recommended}} constructing a greenway and connecting trail along Roaring Brook.

5|$|A service ramp at {{the rear}} of the {{basement}} led to a sliding door that opened into an alley; the police found the door had been tampered with so it could be opened without unlocking it. Later examination found bloody fingerprints on the door, as well as a metal pipe that had been used as a crowbar. Some evidence at the crime scene was improperly handled by the police investigators: <b>a</b> <b>trail</b> in the dirt (from the elevator shaft) along which police believed Phagan had been dragged was trampled; the footprints were never identified.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing the}} {{connection}} to the Lincoln Highway, officials convinced planners of the Victory Highway to traverse the state. The highway entered Colorado from Kansas along what was previously called the Smoky Hill Trail. The highway crossed the mountains along <b>a</b> <b>trail</b> blazed by a railroad surveyor and captain in the American Civil War, cresting at Berthoud Pass. After a round of political infighting between Utah and Nevada, the Victory Highway would become the Lincoln Highway's main rival for San Francisco-bound traffic. When the U.S. Highway system was unveiled in 1926, the Victory Highway was numbered U.S. Highway 40.|$|E
5|$|Alice and the Redfields {{board the}} Arcadia, {{discovering}} it functional but abandoned. Claire then remembers Arcadia is an Umbrella trap to get test subjects; they release the survivors, among them K-Mart (Spencer Locke). Alice follows <b>a</b> <b>trail</b> of blood {{deeper into the}} ship, where she finds Wesker. The T-virus revived him, but it battles Wesker for control, something he believes fresh human DNA can pacify; the Umbrella staff fled when he began eating test subjects. Alice's DNA is superior to his, since she retained control despite her bonding with the virus at a cellular level; Wesker believes eating her will help him regain control of his body over {{the effects of the}} T-virus.|$|E

5|$|Around 1821, the Zulu general Mzilikazi of the Khumalo clan {{successfully}} {{rebelled against}} King Shaka and created his own clan, the Ndebele. The Ndebele fought their way northwards into the Transvaal, leaving <b>a</b> <b>trail</b> of destruction {{in their wake}} and beginning an era of widespread devastation known as the Mfecane. When Dutch trekboers converged on the Transvaal in 1836, they drove the tribe even further northward. By 1838, the Rozwi Empire, {{along with the other}} smaller Shona states were conquered by the Ndebele and reduced to vassaldom.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of outgassing, comets leave in their wake <b>a</b> <b>trail</b> of solid debris too large to be swept away by {{radiation}} pressure and the solar wind. If the Earth's orbit sends it though that debris, there {{are likely to be}} meteor showers as Earth passes through. The Perseid meteor shower, for example, occurs every year between 9 and 13 August, when Earth passes through the orbit of Comet Swift–Tuttle. Halley's Comet {{is the source of the}} Orionid shower in October.|$|E

5|$|As aforesaid, SVT {{wanted to}} make a good use of Malmo Arena's space to {{highlight}} the performances and increase the audience's visibility compared to previous years. SVT created a main stage and a smaller stage with higher-lower shifted floors, connected by <b>a</b> <b>trail</b> closely surrounded by a standing crowd from both sides of it and around the small stage. The main stage mobility was expressed as a main artistic medium at the opening act of the second semifinal and with highlighting Moldova's performance towards its finish, as a movable part beneath the singer's dress making her look gradually taller. The small stage mobility highlighted United Kingdom's performance towards its finish, lifted above the close-standing audience.|$|E

Shortly after, Cecil Rhodes walked unarmed into the Matabele stronghold and made peace with the rebels, ending the Second Matabele War.|$|E
5|$|Hańska met {{the painter}} Jean Gigoux when she hired him in 1851 to paint Anna's portrait. They began a {{relationship}} that lasted many years, but never married.

Jerzy, meanwhile, succumbed to mental disorders and died in 1881, leaving behind <b>a</b> <b>trail</b> of debts. Hańska was forced to sell the house, but was allowed to continue living there. She died on 11 April 1882 and was buried in Balzac's grave at Père Lachaise Cemetery.|$|E
