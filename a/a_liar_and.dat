5|$|The Bible {{is central}} in Zwingli's {{work as a}} {{reformer}} and is crucial {{in the development of}} his theology. Zwingli appealed to scripture constantly in his writings. This is strongly evident in his early writings such as Archeteles (1522) and llarity and Certainty of the Word of God (1522). He believed that man is <b>a</b> <b>liar</b> <b>and</b> only God is the truth. For him scripture, as God's word, brings light when there is only darkness of error.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Ben tells Jack {{that they}} had a perfect plan to convince Jack to operate on Ben's spine, but it failed when Jack saw the X-rays. Afterwards, Juliet brings to Jack's cell a movie, which consists of Juliet speaking through cue cards. As Juliet discusses how the surgery will proceed, on the tape she tells Jack that Ben is <b>a</b> <b>liar</b> <b>and</b> very dangerous, and thus the surgery should be intentionally botched to kill Ben, and that she will protect Jack if he does so.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the main}} characters, only Otho is not morally contemptible. Agrippina is an unscrupulous schemer; Nero, while not yet the monster he would become, is pampered and hypocritical; Claudius is pompous, complacent, and {{something}} of a buffoon, while Poppaea, the first of Handel's sex kittens, is also <b>a</b> <b>liar</b> <b>and</b> a flirt. The freedmen Pallas and Narcissus are self-serving and salacious. All, however, have some redeeming features, and all have arias that express genuine emotion. The situations in which they find themselves are sometimes comic, but never farcical—like Mozart in the Da Ponte operas, Handel avoids laughing at his characters.|$|E

5|$|After leaving politics, Hastings {{returned}} to {{his work as a}} barrister, and eventually surpassed even his previous reputation and success as an advocate. His first major case after returning was representing F. A. Mitchell-Hedges, a noted professional explorer, in his libel action against London Express Newspapers, the owner of the Daily Express. The Daily Express had published two articles saying that he was <b>a</b> <b>liar,</b> <b>and</b> had planned out a bogus robbery to advertise a device known as the Monomark. The case opened on 9 February 1928 in front of Lord Hewart, with Hastings and Norman Birkett representing Mitchell-Hedges and William Jowitt and J.B. Melville representing London Express Newspapers. Despite the skills of both Hastings and Birkett, who later became a much-lauded barrister in his own right, Mitchell-Hedges lost his case and had his reputation destroyed as a result.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{resuming}} his naval duties, Scott {{revealed to}} the Royal Geographical Society his intention to return to Antarctica, but the information was not at that stage made public. Scott was forestalled by Shackleton, who early in 1907 announced his plans to lead an expedition with the twin objectives of reaching the geographic and magnetic South Poles. Under duress, Shackleton agreed not to work from McMurdo Sound, which Scott was claiming as his own sphere of work. In the event, {{unable to find a}} safe landing elsewhere, Shackleton was forced to break this promise. His expedition was highly successful, its southern march ending at 88°23′, less than 100 geographical miles from the South Pole, while its northern party reached the location of the South Magnetic Pole. However, Shackleton's breach of his undertaking caused a significant break in relations between the two men, with Scott dismissing his former companion as <b>a</b> <b>liar</b> <b>and</b> a rogue.|$|E
5|$|In the 1959 gubernatorial primary, Chandler {{threw his}} support to Lieutenant Governor Harry Lee Waterfield. The anti-Chandler forces {{eventually}} put forth Bert Combs as their nominee again. Having {{learned from his}} previous campaign, Combs now attacked Chandler for allegedly requiring state employees to donate 2% of their salaries to his campaign. According to Combs, Chandler had deposited the money in a Cuban bank, but the money was lost when Fidel Castro overthrew {{the government in the}} Cuban Revolution. Ultimately, Combs prevailed in the primary by a vote of 292,462 to 259,461. Republicans nominated John M. Robsion, Jr. to oppose Combs, and when Democratic President Harry S. Truman came to Paducah to campaign for Combs, Chandler refused to welcome him to the state, a customary duty of the sitting governor. Instead, in a letter to Truman, Chandler launched a blistering attack on his party's nominees, calling Combs <b>a</b> <b>liar</b> <b>and</b> alleging that his running mate, Wilson W. Wyatt, who had previously served in Truman's administration, had actually tried to undermine Truman by helping found Americans for Democratic Action. Combs ultimately won the general election by a wide margin.|$|E

Willy had been {{having an affair with a}} receptionist on one of his sales trips when Biff unexpectedly arrived at Willy's hotel room. A shocked Biff angrily confronted his father, calling him <b>a</b> <b>liar</b> <b>and</b> a fraud. From that moment, Biff's views of his father changed and set Biff adrift.|$|E
500|$|Mostly, Bessie was uncompromising in her {{attitude}} towards the council's ruling Conservatives; on one occasion she was ejected from the council chamber by the police, after she had called the Housing Committee chairman <b>a</b> <b>liar</b> <b>and</b> refused the mayor's order to withdraw the remark. She justified this behaviour {{on the grounds that}} [...] "if you didn't do something outrageous, nobody would take any notice of you". She had earlier resorted to using a two-foot megaphone in a council meeting, to demand action over housing conditions and slums.|$|E
500|$|Balked again, Butler {{attempted}} {{to turn the}} campaign personal, calling Tillman <b>a</b> <b>liar</b> <b>and</b> trying to strike him. Tillman warned that Butler's tactics risked sundering white unity, stating to a questioner who asked why he did not meet Butler's insults with violence, [...] "Yes, I tell you, you cowardly hound, why I took them , and I'll meet you wherever you want to.

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1788 Metternich began {{studying}} law at the University of Strasbourg, matriculating on 12 November. While a student he was for some time accommodated by Prince Maximilian of Zweibrücken, the future King of Bavaria. At {{this time he was}} described by Simon as [...] "happy, handsome and lovable", though contemporaries would later recount how he had been <b>a</b> <b>liar</b> <b>and</b> a braggart. Metternich left Strasbourg in September 1790 to attend Leopold II's October coronation in Frankfurt, where he performed the largely honorific role of Ceremonial Marshall to the Catholic Bench of the College of the Counts of Westphalia. There, under the wing of his father, he met with the future Francis II and looked at ease among the attendant nobility.|$|E
500|$|Ibn Hazm, an Andalusian Muslim scholar, {{explicitly}} accused Ezra {{of being}} <b>a</b> <b>liar</b> <b>and</b> a heretic who falsified and added interpolations into the Biblical text. Ibn Hazm provided a polemical {{list of what}} he considered [...] "chronological and geographical inaccuracies and contradictions; theological impossibilities (anthropomorphic expressions, stories of fornication and whoredom, and the attributing of sins to prophets), as well as lack of reliable transmission (tawatur) of the text", Hava Lazarus-Yafeh states. In response to attacks on the personality of Ezra, the Byzantine Emperor Leo III defended Ezra as a pious, reliable person. The Jewish convert to Islam al-Samaw'al (d. 1175) accused Ezra of interpolating stories such as Gen. 19:30-8 in the Bible in order to sully David’s origins and to prevent {{the rule of the}} Davidic dynasty during the second Temple.|$|E
500|$|In November 1823, the American sealing captain Benjamin Morrell {{reached the}} South Sandwich Islands in the {{schooner}} Wasp. According {{to his own}} later account he then sailed south, unconsciously following the track taken by James Weddell a month previously. Morrell claimed to have reached 70°14'S, at which point he turned north because the ship's stoves were running short of fuel—otherwise, he says, he could have [...] "reached 85° without the least doubt". After turning, {{he claimed to have}} encountered land which he described in some detail, and which he named New South Greenland. This land proved not to exist. Morrell's reputation as <b>a</b> <b>liar</b> <b>and</b> a fraud means that most of his geographical claims have been dismissed by scholars, although {{attempts have been made to}} rationalize his assertions.|$|E

500|$|Author and {{journalist}} Heidi Stringell finds Flagg [...] "an embodiment of pure evil", contending that King sees {{good and evil}} as “real forces”; Flagg’s embodiment of evil is confirmed {{by the fact that}} [...] "he is a killer, a maker of mischief, <b>a</b> <b>liar,</b> <b>and</b> a tempter". To Stringell, Flagg’s disappearance at the end of The Stand shows that “evil ultimately leads nowhere”. The author calls Flagg a [...] "generic hybrid" [...] of the archetypical [...] "Dark Man and the Trickster". To her, the combination of these two characteristics found in different cultural realms forces people to face their [...] "flawed humanity" [...] with the [...] "amorality” Flagg represents. Jenifer Paquette, author of Respecting The Stand: A Critical Analysis of Stephen King's Apocalyptic Novel, writes that [...] "Flagg's horror is that he looks like an ordinary man, and his behavior is a mockery of humanity—a terrible insight into the human psyche. King suggests that the thing to fear the most is inside ourselves." ...|$|E
500|$|Cope {{took his}} sinking {{fortunes}} in stride. In writing to Osborn about the articles, {{he laughed at}} the outcome, saying, [...] "It will now rest largely with you whether or not I am supposed to be <b>a</b> <b>liar</b> <b>and</b> am actuated by jealousy and disappointment. I think Marsh is impaled on the horns of Monoclonius sphenocerus." [...] Cope {{was well aware of}} his enemies and was carefree enough to name a species after a combination of [...] "Cope" [...] and [...] "hater", Anisonchus cophater. Through his years of financial hardship, he was able to continue publishing papers—his most productive years were 1884 and 1885, with 79 and 62 papers published, respectively. The 1880s marked the publication of two of the best-known fossil taxa described by Cope: the pelycosaur Edaphosaurus in 1882 and the early dinosaur Coelophysis in 1889. In 1889, he succeeded Leidy, who had died the previous year, as professor of zoology at the University of Pennsylvania. The small yearly stipend was enough for Cope's family to move back into one of the townhouses he had been forced to relinquish earlier.|$|E
500|$|The {{questions}} about the veracity of Chatwin's writing are compounded by the revelation of his sexual orientation and the true cause of his death. Once it became known that Chatwin had been bisexual and had died of an AIDS-related illness, some critics viewed him as <b>a</b> <b>liar</b> <b>and</b> dismissed his work. Nicholas Shakespeare said, [...] "His denial [...] bred a sense that if he lied about his life, he must have lied about his work. Some readers have taken this as a cue to pass judgement on his books – or else not to bother with them." [...] In 2010 The Guardian's review of Under the Sun: The Letters of Bruce Chatwin opened with the question, [...] "Does anyone read Bruce Chatwin these days?" [...] However, Rory Stewart has stated, [...] "His personality, his learning, his myths, and even his prose are less hypnotizing [...] And yet he remains a great writer, of deep and enduring importance.” In 2008 The Times [...] named Chatwin #46 on their list of [...] "50 Greatest British Writers Since 1945".|$|E

500|$|Markham faced further {{problems}} in securing {{funding for the}} expedition. In 1898, after three years' effort, {{only a fraction of}} what was required had been promised. Meanwhile, the Anglo-Norwegian explorer Carsten Borchgrevink had obtained a sum of £40,000 (over [...] in 2008) from publisher George Newnes, to finance a private Antarctic venture. Markham was furious, believing that funds were being diverted from his own project, and denounced Borchgrevink as [...] "evasive, <b>a</b> <b>liar</b> <b>and</b> a fraud". He was equally hostile to William Speirs Bruce, the Scottish explorer who had written to Markham asking to join the National Antarctic Expedition. On receiving no confirmation of an appointment, Bruce obtained finance from the Scottish Coats family and organised his own Scottish National Antarctic Expedition. Markham accused Bruce of [...] "mischievous rivalry", and of attempting to [...] "cripple the National Expedition... in order to get up a scheme for yourself". The Scottish expedition duly sailed, but Markham remained unforgiving towards it, and used his influence to ensure that its participants received no Polar Medals on their return.|$|E
500|$|Castro {{founded a}} legal {{partnership}} with two fellow leftists, Jorge Azpiazu and Rafael Resende, focusing on helping poor Cubans assert their rights. A financial failure, its main client was a timber merchant who paid them in timber to furnish their office. Caring little for money or material goods, Castro {{failed to pay}} his bills; his furniture was repossessed and electricity cut off, distressing his wife. He {{took part in a}} high-school protest in Cienfuegos in November 1950, fighting a four-hour battle with police in protest at the Education Ministry’s ban on the founding of student associations. Arrested and charged for violent conduct, the magistrate dismissed the charges. He also became {{an active member of the}} Cuban Peace Committee, campaigning against western involvement in the Korean War. His hopes for Cuba still centered on Eduardo Chibás and the Partido Ortodoxo; however Chibás had made a mistake when he accused Education Minister Aureliano Sánchez of purchasing a Guatemalan ranch with misappropriated funds, but was unable to substantiate his allegations. The government accused Chibás of being <b>a</b> <b>liar,</b> <b>and</b> in 1951 he shot himself during a radio broadcast, issuing a [...] "last wake-up call" [...] to the Cuban people. Castro was present and accompanied him to the hospital where he died.|$|E
500|$|The willie wagtail was {{a feature}} in Australian Aboriginal folklore. Aboriginal tribes {{in parts of}} southeastern Australia, such as the Ngarrindjeri of the Lower Murray River, and the Narrunga People of the Yorke Peninsula, regard the willie wagtail as the bearer of bad news. It was thought that the willie wagtail could steal a person's secrets while {{lingering}} around camps eavesdropping, so women would be tight-lipped {{in the presence of}} the bird. The people of the Kimberley held a similar belief that it would inform the spirit of the recently departed if living relatives spoke badly of them. They also venerated the willie wagtail as the most intelligent of all animals. Its cleverness is also seen in a Tinputz tale of Bougainville Island, where Singsing Tongereng (Willie Wagtail) wins a contest among all birds to see who can fly the highest, by riding on the back of the eagle. However, the Gunwinggu in western Arnhem Land took a dimmer view and regarded it as <b>a</b> <b>liar</b> <b>and</b> a [...] The willie wagtail was held to have stolen fire and tried to extinguish it in the sea in a dreaming story of the Yindjibarndi people of the central and western Pilbara, and was able to send a strong wind if frightened.
