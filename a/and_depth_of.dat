5|$|In skeletally {{immature}} individuals, {{the blood}} supply to the epiphyseal bone is good, supporting both osteogenesis and chondrogenesis. With disruption of the epiphyseal plate vessels, varying degrees <b>and</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> necrosis occur, resulting in a cessation of growth to both osteocytes and chondrocytes. In turn, this pattern leads to disordered ossification of cartilage, resulting in subchondral avascular necrosis and consequently OCD.|$|E

5|$|The eyes of tadpoles lack lids, but at metamorphosis, {{the cornea}} becomes more dome-shaped, the lens becomes flatter, and eyelids and {{associated}} glands and ducts develop. The adult eyes are an improvement on invertebrate eyes and were {{a first step}} in the development of more advanced vertebrate eyes. They allow colour vision <b>and</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> focus.

5|$|Halo 3 {{utilizes}} a proprietary, in-house graphics engine. As detailed on the Bungie website, {{it employs}} advanced graphics {{technologies such as}} high dynamic range, global lighting <b>and</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field effects within cutscenes. Motion blurring was absent from the beta, but {{was added to the}} final game. Most of the dynamic objects in the game cast real-time shadows on themselves and the environment around them, including the game's plant life. Halo 3 uses normal, bump, and parallax mapping to give surfaces more detail without dramatically increasing the number of polygons. Players can see distances of up to ten miles (16km) away, all fully three-dimensional. Real time reflections were written into the engine; however, they are often unused as Bungie considered it a waste of resources.|$|E
40|$|By {{researching and}} {{applying}} new methods {{we will be}} able to improve significantly estimation <b>of</b> shapes, dimensions <b>and</b> <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> gravity sources. After shapes estimation of gravity sources through support vector classifier (SVC) in our last research [Hekmatian et al. 2015], in this paper SVC is applied for estimating <b>depths</b> <b>and</b> dimensions <b>of</b> gravity sources. These estimations give us logical and complete initial guesses regarding shapes, <b>depths</b> <b>and</b> dimensions <b>of</b> gravity sources which are needed in more precise interpretations and inversions of gravity sources. Also for better application of SVC, we selected more proper features using the technique called feature selection (FS). In this paper, we trained SVC with 320 synthetic gravity profiles for estimation <b>of</b> dimensions <b>and</b> <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> gravity sources. We tested the trained SVC codes by about 200 other synthetic and some real gravity profiles. The <b>depths</b> <b>and</b> dimensions <b>of</b> a well along with two ore bodies (three real gravity sources) are estimated during the testing process...|$|R

5|$|Hergé's {{supporting}} {{characters have}} been cited as far more developed than the central character, each imbued with strength of character <b>and</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> personality, which has been {{compared with that of}} the characters of Charles Dickens. Hergé used the supporting characters to create a realistic world in which to set his protagonists' adventures. To further the realism and continuity, characters would recur throughout the series. The occupation of Belgium and the restrictions imposed upon Hergé forced him to focus on characterisation to avoid depicting troublesome political situations. As a result, the colourful supporting cast was developed during this period.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 2010s, British public-service {{broadcaster}} Channel 4 resolved {{to improve the}} accuracy <b>and</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> their representation of transgender people. My Transsexual Summer was the first transgender programme they created after making this resolution. Channel 4 broadcast the series in November 2011. It was rebroadcast in the UK on More4 in 2012, and on ABC2 in Australia in 2013. Also in 2013, two of the show's participants themselves started making documentary short films and videos about transgender.|$|E
5|$|Near Umbriel's equator {{lies the}} most {{prominent}} surface feature: Wunda crater, which has a diameter of about 131km. Wunda has a large ring of bright material on its floor, which may be an impact deposit or deposit of carbon dioxide ice. Nearby, seen along the terminator, are the craters Vuver and Skynd, which lack bright rims but possess bright central peaks. Study of limb profiles of Umbriel revealed a possible very large impact feature having the diameter of about 400km <b>and</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> approximately 5km.|$|E
50|$|Roughing {{cuts are}} used to remove large amount of {{material}} from the starting workpart as rapidly as possible, i.e. with a large Material Removal Rate (MRR), {{in order to produce}} a shape close to the desired form, but leaving some material on the piece for a subsequent finishing operation.Finishing cuts {{are used to}} complete the part and achieve the final dimension, tolerances, and surface finish. In production machining jobs, one or more roughing cuts are usually performed on the work, followed by one or two finishing cuts. Roughing operations are done at high feeds <b>and</b> <b>depths</b> - feeds <b>of</b> 0.4-1.25 mm/rev (0.015-0.050 in/rev) <b>and</b> <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> 2.5-20 mm (0.100-0.750 in) are typical, but actual values depend on the workpiece materials. Finishing operations are carried out at low feeds <b>and</b> <b>depths</b> - feeds <b>of</b> 0.0125-0.04 mm/rev (0.0005-0.0015 in/rev) <b>and</b> <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> 0.75-2.0 mm (0.030-0.075 in) are typical. Cutting speeds are lower in roughing than in finishing.|$|R

5|$|The {{arterial}} partial {{pressures of}} oxygen {{and carbon dioxide}} in the arterial blood are homeostatically controlled. A rise in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and, to a lesser extent, a fall in the arterial partial pressure of oxygen, will reflexly cause deeper and faster breathing till the blood gas tensions return to normal. The converse happens when the carbon dioxide tension falls, or, again to a lesser extent, the oxygen tension rises: the rate <b>and</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> breathing are reduced till blood gas normality is restored.|$|E
5|$|The {{technologies}} of deep tube tunnelling and electric traction pioneered and proved by the C shaped {{the direction of}} subsequent underground railways built in London. The C demonstrated that an underground railway could be constructed without the need to purchase large and expensive tracts of land for the shallow cuttings of sub-surface steam operated railways. Instead, it became possible to construct a tunnel at deep level without adversely affecting conditions on the surface. The C thus encouraged {{the construction of a}} network of underground railways in London, far larger than might have been the case otherwise. The size <b>and</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the tunnels used on the deep tube lines, including the Northern line, does have drawbacks: the tunnels have a limited loading gauge and the lines suffer from overheating in the summer.|$|E
5|$|Three {{different}} early {{versions of}} the play are extant: the First Quarto (Q1, 1603); the Second Quarto (Q2, 1604); and the First Folio (F1, 1623). Each version includes lines and entire scenes missing from the others. The play's structure <b>and</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> characterisation have inspired much critical scrutiny. One such example is the centuries-old debate about Hamlet's hesitation to kill his uncle, which some see as merely a plot device to prolong the action, but which others argue is a dramatisation of the complex philosophical and ethical issues that surround cold-blooded murder, calculated revenge, and thwarted desire. More recently, psychoanalytic critics have examined Hamlet's unconscious desires, while feminist critics have re-evaluated and attempted to rehabilitate the often maligned characters of Ophelia and Gertrude.|$|E

40|$|According to {{previous}} research of dynamic end milling models, the instantaneous dynamic radii on every cutting position affects the cutting forces directly since the simulated forces are {{proportional to the}} chip thickness, and the chip thickness {{is a function of}} dynamic radii and feedrate. With the concept of flute engagement introduced, it is important to discuss it with respect to radial <b>and</b> axial <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> cut because the length of the engaged flutes is affected by factors in the axial feed and rotational directions. Radial <b>and</b> axial <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> cut affect the “contact area”, which is the area that a cutter contacts with the workpiece. When radial <b>and</b> axial <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> cut increase, the cutting forces also increase since the engaged flute lengths are increased. Therefore, {{in order to have a}} clearer idea of the milling forces, the influences of dynamic radii, cutting feedrate, and radial <b>and</b> axial <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> cut are discussed in this paper. Key Words: simulated forces, milling forces, dynamic radii, cutting feedrate, flute engagement, radial <b>and</b> axial <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> cut, rake angle 1...|$|R
5|$|Also {{noting the}} unachievable {{ambition}} {{of solving the}} conflict between naturalism and religion, Martin A Greenman, remarks that one must come to the book “with a certain mood”. Too critical a mood would blind the reader to its religious insights, while the sensitivity <b>and</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> its philosophic insights would be lost {{if one were to}} approach it in a too enthusiastically religious mood. Greenman finishes by justifying Stace’s philosophy to logical positivists by quoting from Wittgenstein's Tractatus: “My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out through them, on them, over them….He must surmount these propositions: then he sees the world rightly” (6. 54.) Dorothy M. Emmet found issue with the notion that the mystical experience is the point of intersection between the temporal and eternal orders. She writes that there are difficulties in Stace defining these orders as two distinct “orders of being”, rather than just as a way of speaking, because this then means some statements about the temporal order are relevant to what is said about the eternal order and vice versa. Indeed, the interrelation between these two orders is difficult to maintain. She also questioned Stace’s characterisation of mystical consciousness as being the same everywhere.|$|E
5|$|The {{leaves of}} red maple, {{especially}} when dead or wilted, are extremely toxic to horses. The toxin is unknown, but {{believed to be}} an oxidant because it damages red blood cells, causing acute oxidative hemolysis that inhibits the transport of oxygen. This not only decreases oxygen delivery to all tissues, but also leads {{to the production of}} methemoglobin, which can further damage the kidneys. The ingestion of 700grams (1.5 pounds) of leaves is considered toxic and 1.4 kilograms (3 pounds) is lethal. Symptoms occur within one or two days after ingestion and can include depression, lethargy, increased rate <b>and</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> breathing, increased heart rate, jaundice, dark brown urine, colic, laminitis, coma, and death. Treatment is limited and can include the use of methylene blue or mineral oil and activated carbon in order to stop further absorption of the toxin into the stomach, as well as blood transfusions, fluid support, diuretics, and anti-oxidants such as Vitamin C. About 50% to 75% of affected horses die or are euthanized as a result.|$|E
5|$|To {{promote the}} game, Valve has {{produced}} three machinima trailers depicting {{the game in}} play. The trailers are themed around wartime propaganda news reports for both Germany and the United States. To convey this effect, the trailers make extensive usage of the Source engine's capabilities for film grain, color correction, motion blur <b>and</b> <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> field, as well as sepia toning. The first trailer was released {{as part of the}} game's post-release marketing on December 20, 2005. Entitled Prelude to Victory, the trailer depicted a large firefight in the game as a report from the German perspective, complete with a commentator speaking in the German language. Two further trailers were released to promote the major update to Day of Defeat: Source {{in the second quarter of}} 2006. The trailers, both from the American viewpoint, displayed how the new detonation gameplay worked, emphasising teamwork as the key to success, as well as introducing the viewer to the two new maps added by the update. To further create interest in the game, Valve has opened Day of Defeat: Source to three free weekends, the first taking place on February 10, 2006, the second on July 8, 2006 and the third on July 4, 2008, where anyone with a Steam account could download and play the game for a maximum of 48 hours free of charge.|$|E
