5|$|Bedell {{sponsored}} several bold initiatives {{during his}} tenure in the United States House of Representatives. One initiative, which came from his constituents' problems with the barge industry, focused on waterway usage fees. He introduced legislation in 1977 {{that would require the}} barge industry to pay <b>a</b> <b>fee</b> <b>for</b> using the waterways which, Bedell pointed out, the Government paid millions of dollars to create and maintain. Bedell's original plan set the rate the barge industry paid as directly related to the amount the Government spent on waterway projects. This would have the additional effect of helping curb unnecessary waterway projects, and it was the same plan proposed by Pete Domenici in the Senate.|$|E
5|$|He {{was elected}} the first {{president}} of the Edmonton Board of Trade upon its founding in 1889. He served until 1894. He also played a vital {{role in the development of}} the school system in Edmonton, involving himself in education-related affairs as early as 1881, and serving on the public school board from 1886–87 and 1889 until 1897. In 1881, he was part of a group that provided funds for the first school teacher in the city. In 1886, with the school board, Cameron was responsible for introducing <b>a</b> <b>fee</b> <b>for</b> the parents of students attending schools in the Edmonton Public School District who did not live within the district, as district residents were taxed for the school's services. He would serve as secretary-treasurer from 1882 to 1884 and later as chairman of the school board from 1890 to 1892 and 1894.|$|E
5|$|In July 2005, Johnson again {{moved on}} loan this time {{returning}} to Crewe Alexandra in a six-month deal. It took him eight games to score his first goal which {{came in a}} 1–1 draw with Plymouth Argyle on 13 September 2005. Three more goals followed {{by the end of}} 2005 including one on Boxing Day against Hull City, who then offered him a permanent deal. Hull and Manchester United agreed <b>a</b> <b>fee</b> <b>for</b> Johnson but he decided to extend his loan deal at Crewe {{until the end of the}} 2005–06 season. It was not until the last game of the season against Millwall that he scored another to bring his tally to five from 22games. Having failed to make an impact at Manchester United, Johnson was among seven United players given a free transfer at the end of the 2005–06 season. He was offered a contract at Crewe, but also attracted interest from Barnsley and Bradford City, the latter of whom he joined on a two-year deal in June 2006.|$|E

5|$|Boyd {{played in}} Peterborough's first match of the 2009–10 season, scoring from the penalty {{spot in a}} 2–1 defeat to Derby County at Pride Park. Three days later, Boyd netted Peterborough's third in the club's 4–0 away win at Wycombe Wanderers. He scored his third goal of the {{campaign}} in a 2–1 home win against Ipswich Town, as well as scoring in the club's 1–1 draw at Leicester City. His sixth of the season came in Peterborough's 3–2 home victory over Reading, with Boyd scoring the club's third goal with a backheel in injury-time. In October 2009, Boyd made a club record-equalling 124th consecutive appearance, scoring a last minute equaliser against Bristol City at Ashton Gate. He subsequently broke the record three days later in a match against Doncaster Rovers, before scoring twice in the following match against Scunthorpe United. He continued his goalscoring form throughout October with a goal at Ewood Park, scoring his third goal in Peterborough's League Cup campaign in a 5–2 defeat against Premier League team Blackburn Rovers. The following week, Boyd scored in a 2–1 defeat at home to Barnsley, as well as netting in a 2–2 draw against Middlesbrough shortly after. He assisted both of Peterborough's goals in a 2–1 victory at home to Watford. Boyd also scored in Peterborough's 4–4 draw against Cardiff City, scoring Peterborough's third goal as the club came back from four goals down to earn a point. Upon Mark Cooper's arrival as manager, Boyd was made team captain in January 2010. In February 2010, {{it was announced that}} Peterborough rejected a bid for Boyd from fellow Championship side Middlesbrough in the January transfer window. The following day, Peterborough United director of football Barry Fry confirmed that Middlesbrough were in talks over Boyd, although talks broke down after the two clubs failed to agree <b>a</b> <b>fee</b> <b>for</b> the player. Boyd scored a total of 12 times in 37 appearances during the 2009–10 season.|$|E

This fee consists of an administrative fee for the university (only in some of the states), <b>a</b> <b>fee</b> <b>for</b> Studentenwerk, which is a statutory student affairs organization, <b>a</b> <b>fee</b> <b>for</b> the university's AStA (Allgemeiner Studentenausschuss, students' government) and Studentenschaft (students' union), at many universities <b>a</b> <b>fee</b> <b>for</b> public transportation, and possibly more fees as decided by the university's students' parliament (e.g., for a cooperation with a local theater granting free entry for students).

25|$|Prior to 1995, Microsoft {{licensed}} MS-DOS (and Windows) {{to computer}} manufacturers under {{three types of}} agreement: per-processor (<b>a</b> <b>fee</b> <b>for</b> each system the company sold), per-system (<b>a</b> <b>fee</b> <b>for</b> each system of a particular model), or per-copy (<b>a</b> <b>fee</b> <b>for</b> each copy of MS-DOS installed). The largest manufacturers used the per-processor arrangement, which had the lowest fee. This arrangement made it expensive for the large manufacturers to migrate to any other operating system, such as DR DOS. In 1991, the U.S. government Federal Trade Commission began investigating Microsoft's licensing procedures, resulting in a 1994 settlement agreement limiting Microsoft to per-copy licensing. Digital Research did not gain by this settlement, and years later its successor in interest, Caldera, sued Microsoft for damages in the Caldera v. Microsoft lawsuit. It was believed that the settlement ran {{in the order of}} $150million, but was revealed in November 2009 with the release of the Settlement Agreement to be $280million.|$|E
