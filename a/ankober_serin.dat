50|$|The <b>Ankober</b> <b>serin</b> was {{formerly}} {{placed in the}} genus Serinus but phylogenetic analysis using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences found that the genus was polyphyletic. The genus was therefore split {{and a number of}} species including the <b>Ankober</b> <b>serin</b> were moved to the resurrected genus Crithagra.|$|E
50|$|This bird is {{endemic to}} Ethiopia, inhabiting steep rocky slopes and high cliff-tops; the {{reported}} {{range of the}} <b>Ankober</b> <b>serin</b> consists of several disjointed areas in northern Shewa and in the northern Amhara Region. It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Ankober</b> <b>serin</b> (Crithagra ankoberensis) is {{a species}} of finch in the Fringillidae family. It is a small brown seedeater, about 12 centimeters or 5 inches in length with brown upperparts and its head and breast {{distinguished}} with heavy buffy-colored streaking. It is gregarious and is often encountered in flocks. Its song consists of a constant, low twitter.|$|E
5000|$|... 114 {{bird species}} have been {{recorded}} in the Guassa Area: 12% of the 862 species of birds in Ethiopia. The area {{is also home to}} a multitude of birds of prey and serves as a wintering ground for 38 species of Palearctic and intra-African migratory birds. Endemic birds include: <b>Ankober</b> <b>serin</b> (Serinus ankoberensis), Abyssinian catbird (Parophasma galinieri), Abyssinian longclaw (Macronyx flavicollis), blue-winged goose (Cyanochen cyanoptera), Ethiopian/black-headed siskin (Serinus nigriceps), black-winged lovebird (Agapornis taranta), Rouget's rail (Rougetius rougetii), spot-breasted plover (Vanellus melanocephalus), thick-billed raven (Corvus crassirostris), wattled ibis (Bostrychia carunculata), white-collared pigeon (Columba albitorques) and white-winged cliff chat (Myrmecocichla semirufa).|$|E
5000|$|Ankober was {{formerly}} {{the capital of}} the Ethiopian kingdom of Shewa. Buildings that survive from the Shewa period include the Kidus Mikael church, built by Sahle Selassie. According to Philip Briggs, all that survives of Menelik's palace, which he had built on the site of his father's palace, is [...] "one long stone-and-mortar wall measuring some 1.5m high." [...] Briggs comments that it is [...] "difficult to say why this one wall should have survived virtually intact {{when the rest of the}} palace crumbled into virtual oblivion." [...] Ankober is also known as where the endemic <b>Ankober</b> <b>serin</b> was first observed by ornithologists in 1979.|$|E
50|$|These slopes {{are home}} {{to a number of}} endemic reptiles, birds and animals {{including}} the endangered walia ibex (Capra walie) and the gelada baboon, whose thick fur allows it to thrive in the cooler climates of the mountains. These two species are only found on the northern side of the valley while another rare endemic the mountain nyala (Tragelaphus buxtoni) is restricted to the southern side, and now survives at higher altitudes than its original habitat as the lower slopes are heavily farmed. More widespread mammals found here include the mantled guereza (Colobus guereza), which is also threatened as its habitat disappears as is that of many other mammals of the highlands such as olive baboon (Papio anubis), Egyptian wolf (Canis aureus lupaster), African leopard (Panthera pardus pardus), Masai lion (Panthera leo nubica), spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta), caracal (Caracal caracal), serval (Felis serval), common duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia) and red river hog (Potamochoerus porcus). Birds include Rueppell's chat, the finch <b>Ankober</b> <b>serin</b> (Serinus ankoberensis), white-winged flufftail (Sarothrura ayresi), and blue-winged goose. The farmland is home to many butterflies, especially Papilio, Charaxinae, Pieridae and Lycaenidae.|$|E
50|$|Ash {{was born}} in Gosforth, Northumberland on 26 May 1925 as son of Sidney and Kathleen Ash né Denley. In 1945, he {{graduated}} to Bachelor of Science at the University of Durham. He received the D.I.C. at the Imperial College London in 1948 and promoted there to Ph.D. in 1952. He was co-author of two fieldguides, The Birds of Somalia (with John E. Miskell) in 1998, and Birds of Ethiopia and Eritrea (with John Atkins) in 2009. Ash discovered several new bird taxa, including the <b>Ankober</b> <b>serin</b> (Serinus ankoberensis), Turdoides squamulata carolinae (a subspecies of the scaly babbler) which he named for his daughter Caroline, Hippolais pallida alulensis (a subspecies of the eastern olivaceous warbler), Acrocephalus baeticatus avicenniae (a subspecies of the African reed warbler), the Ash's lark (Mirafra ashi) which was named after him by Peter Colston in 1982, and Ploceus victoriae, which is now {{thought to be a}} hybrid between the black-headed weaver and the northern brown-throated weaver. In May 1968, he co-discovered the Sidamo lark along with Christian Érard who described this species in 1975 but is now considered as conspecific with Archer's lark. He died on 6 January 2014. In November 1951, Ash married Jonquil Gudgeon, a zoologist, who died three days before him. The couple had one daughter, Caroline Penelope-Jane.|$|E
