5|$|Nielsen {{views the}} brachiopods and closely related phoronids as {{affiliated}} with the deuterostome pterobranchs because their lophophores are driven by one cilium per cell, while those of bryozoans, which he regards as protosomes, have multiple cilia per cell. However, pterobranchs are hemichordates and probably closely related to echinoderms, {{and there is no}} evidence that the latest common <b>ancestor</b> <b>of</b> pterobranchs and other hemichordates or the latest common <b>ancestor</b> <b>of</b> hemichordates and echinoderms was sessile and fed by means of tentacles.|$|E

5|$|A {{source of}} {{confusion}} {{is the notion}} that a transitional form between two different taxonomic groups must be a direct <b>ancestor</b> <b>of</b> one or both groups. The difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that {{one of the goals of}} evolutionary taxonomy is to identify taxa that were ancestors of other taxa. However, it is almost impossible to be sure that any form represented in the fossil record is a direct <b>ancestor</b> <b>of</b> any other. In fact, because evolution is a branching process that produces a complex bush pattern of related species rather than a linear process producing a ladder-like progression, and because of the incompleteness of the fossil record, it is unlikely that any particular form represented in the fossil record is a direct <b>ancestor</b> <b>of</b> any other. Cladistics deemphasizes the concept of one taxonomic group being an <b>ancestor</b> <b>of</b> another, and instead emphasizes the identification of sister taxa that share a more recent common ancestor with one another than they do with other groups. There are a few exceptional cases, such as some marine plankton microfossils, where the fossil record is complete enough to suggest with confidence that certain fossils represent a population that was actually ancestral to a later population of a different species. But, in general, transitional fossils are considered to have features that illustrate the transitional anatomical features of actual common ancestors of different taxa, rather than to be actual ancestors.|$|E

5|$|Analyses since 2001 have {{concluded}} that Eumetazoa (more complex than sponges) are {{more closely related to}} particular groups of sponges than {{to the rest of the}} sponges. Such conclusions imply that sponges are not monophyletic, because the last common <b>ancestor</b> <b>of</b> all sponges would also be a direct <b>ancestor</b> <b>of</b> the Eumetazoa, which are not sponges. A study in 2001 based on comparisons of ribosome DNA concluded that the most fundamental division within sponges was between glass sponges and the rest, and that Eumetazoa are more closely related to calcareous sponges, those with calcium carbonate spicules, than to other types of sponge. In 2007 one analysis based on comparisons of RNA and another based mainly on comparison of spicules concluded that demosponges and glass sponges are more closely related to each other than either is to calcareous sponges, which in turn are more closely related to Eumetazoa.|$|E

5|$|Ian Rowley {{proposed}} that the common <b>ancestor</b> <b>of</b> the five species diverged into a tropical crow and temperate raven sometime after entering Australia from the north, which molecular evidence indicates occurred in the early Pliocene epoch around 4 million years ago. The raven diverged into the <b>ancestor</b> <b>of</b> the forest and little ravens {{in the east and}} Australian raven in the west, this split occurring around 2 million years ago in the early Pleistocene. As the climate became cooler and drier, the aridity of central Australia split them entirely. Furthermore, the eastern birds diverged into nomadic little ravens and, in forested refuges, forest ravens. As the climate eventually became warmer, the western birds spread eastwards and almost outcompeted forest ravens on mainland Australia. Rowley noted that the western subspecies of the Australian raven had features intermediate between the eastern subspecies of Australian and little ravens.|$|E
