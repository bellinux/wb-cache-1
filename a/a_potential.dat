40|$|Bacteriorhodopsin (BR) is a {{membrane}} protein which pumps protons through the plasma membrane. Seven transmembrane BR helical segments {{are subjected to}} simulation studies in order to investigate the packing process of transmembrane helices. A Monte Carlo simulated annealing protocol is employed to optimize the helix bundle system. Helix packing is optimized according to <b>a</b> semi-empirical <b>potential</b> mainly composed of six components: <b>a</b> bilayer <b>potential,</b> <b>a</b> crossing angle <b>potential,</b> <b>a</b> helix dipole <b>potential,</b> <b>a</b> helix-helix distance <b>potential,</b> <b>a</b> helix orientation <b>potential</b> and <b>a</b> helix-helix distance restraint <b>potential</b> (<b>a</b> loop <b>potential).</b> Necessary parameters are derived from theoretical studies and statistical analysis of experimentally determined protein structures. The structures from the simulations are compared with the experimentally determined structures in terms of geometry. The structures generated show similar shapes to the experimentally suggested structure even without the helix-helix distance restraint potential. However, the relative locations of individual helices were reproduced only when the helix-helix distance restraint potential was used with restraint conditions. Our results suggest that transmembrane helix bundles resembling those observed experimentally may be generated by simulations using simple potentials...|$|R

50|$|<b>A</b> {{receptor}} <b>potential</b> {{is often}} produced by sensory transduction. It is generally a depolarizing event resulting from inward current flow. The influx of current will often bring the membrane {{potential of the}} sensory receptor towards the threshold for triggering <b>an</b> action <b>potential.</b> Receptor potential can work to trigger <b>an</b> action <b>potential</b> either within the same neuron or on an adjacent cell. Within the same neuron, <b>a</b> receptor <b>potential</b> can cause local current to flow to a region capable of generating <b>an</b> action <b>potential</b> by opening voltage gated ion channels. <b>A</b> receptor <b>potential</b> can also cause the release of neurotransmitters from one cell that will act on another cell, generating <b>an</b> action <b>potential</b> in the second cell. The magnitude of the receptor potential determines {{the frequency with which}} action potentials are generated, and is controlled by adaption, stimulus strength, and temporal summation of successive receptor potentials. Receptor potential relies on receptor sensitivity which can adapt slowly, resulting in a slowly decaying receptor potential or rapidly, resulting in a quickly generated but shorter lasting receptor potential.|$|R
