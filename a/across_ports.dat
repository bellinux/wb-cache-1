5000|$|The {{relations}} between imperial China and ancient Indonesia commenced during the 7th century, possibly earlier. Indonesia {{was part of}} the maritime Silk Road connecting China with India and the Arab world. Numerous Chinese ceramics were discovered throughout Indonesia, suggesting ancient trade links between both countries. The National Museum of Indonesia has one of the best and the most complete collections of Chinese ceramics discovered outside of China, dated from the Han, Tang, Sung, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, spanning for almost two millennia. This particular collection provides a good insight into Indonesia's maritime trade over the centuries. Research indicates that the Chinese sailed to India via Indonesia as early as Western Han period (205 BC to 220 AD) {{as a part of the}} maritime silk road and firm trade relations were subsequently established. Traditionally, the Indonesian archipelago, identified by ancient Chinese geographer as Nanyang, was the source of spices such as cloves, cubeb, and nutmeg, raw materials such as sandalwood, gold and tin, as well as exotic rare items such as ivory, rhino horn, tiger fur and bone, exotic birds and colorful feathers. While the fine silk and ceramics of China was sought by ancient Indonesian kingdoms. Indonesia also played some role in the expansion of Buddhism from India to China. A Chinese monk, I-Tsing, visited Srivijaya in 671 for 6 months during his mission to acquire sacred Buddhist texts from India. Other Chinese accounts and chronicles also mention several ancient states in Indonesia today. Chinese records mentioned about Kunlun sailors, presumably Cham or Malays sailors, that sailed and traded many products <b>across</b> <b>ports</b> in Southeast and South Asia. The Malay sailors are most probably hailed from Srivijayan empire in Sumatra. Ancient Indonesian sailors seems to actively sought trade around Southeast Asia and as far as China and India. Since I-Tsing, numbers of Chinese travelers such as Chou Ju-kua began to visit and wrote about the Indonesian archipelago.|$|E

40|$|Managing {{shipping}} vessel profitability {{is a central}} problem in marine transportation. We consider two commonly used types of vessels, “liners ” (ships whose routes are fixed in advance) and “trampers ” (ships for which future route components are selected based on available ship-ping jobs) and formulate a vessel profit maximization problem as a stochastic dynamic program. For liner vessels, the profit maximization reduces {{to the problem of}} minimizing refueling costs over a given route subject to random fuel prices and limited vessel fuel capacity. Under mild assumptions about the stochastic dynamics of fuel prices at different ports, we provide a char-acterization of the structural properties of the optimal liner refueling policies. For trampers, the vessel profit maximization combines refueling decisions and route selection which adds a combinatorial aspect to the problem. We characterize the optimal policy in special cases where:) prices are constant through time and do not differ <b>across</b> <b>ports,</b> and) prices are constant through time and differ <b>across</b> <b>ports.</b> The structure of the optimal policy in such special cases yields insights on the complexity of the problem and also guides the construction of heuristics for the general problem setting. ...|$|E

Yet, there is only limited comprehensive information available on the efficiency of ports or evidence {{of the effect of}} port efficiency on trade. We develop and apply a straightforward approach to estimate port efficiency. The approach uses detailed data on US imports and associated import costs, yielding estimates <b>across</b> <b>ports,</b> products, and time. These measures are incorporated into a gravity trade model where we estimate that improved port efficiency significantly increases trade volumes.

Unlike previous measures, this study's methodology can provide such estimates for a much broader sample of countries and years with little cost. Thus, such data can be used by future researchers to examine a myriad of new issues, including the evolution of port efficiencies over time and its effects on international trade flows and country-level growth...|$|E

We characterize the unique equilibrium outcome and perform comparative statics. We provide insights relevant to policy planners and to private sector trading firms. We find that, for a given level of inspection capacity, implementation of C-TPAT results in a Pareto reduction in costs. The membership level increases as the environment becomes riskier but is unaffected by changes in inspection capacity. The latter result implies that the program structure should be stable, and it indicates {{that it may be}} possible to decouple inspection problems <b>across</b> <b>ports.</b> At the same time, because CBP cannot base C-TPAT agreements upon observed outcomes (terrorist incidents) the program’s equilibrium does not achieve an economic First Best. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{applies the}} {{production}} framework {{associated with a}} mixture of data envelopment analysis (DEA) and stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) to evaluate the relative efficiency of port management across countries. Differently from previous studies, a three stage approach is adopted in order to identify the role of contextual factors on an input-by-input basis. It involves using DEA for evaluating efficiency in the I and in the III stage, and SFA, carried out through fixed-effect estimators, in the II stage. The latter for controlling the role of external environment in determining input-specific efficiency differentials <b>across</b> <b>ports.</b> The sample is composed of 30 ports observed over the period 1995 – 2009. The outcome of the DEA applied in the III stage shows that netting inputs of the impact of factors considered outside direct ports' managers control, relative performances of ports change significantly. Any evaluation procedure of port performance should take into account the effect of contextual variables, as identified not only through overall efficiency, but also through input performance...|$|E
40|$|Switched Ethernet {{arose in}} the last decade as a means to {{increase}} global throughput with parallel switching paths, segment the network and create isolated collision domains, thus reducing the non-determinism of the original shared Ethernet. However, COTS Ethernet switches still suffer from a few drawbacks that affect negatively their real-time communication capabilities. For example, there can be overflows in ports queues with consequences <b>across</b> <b>ports,</b> priority levels and virtual LANs, and the number of priorities is too short for any kind of priority-based scheduling. Moreover, switches present extra latencies and jitter due to the need to interpret frame addresses and also due to different internal architectural solutions. In this paper we propose using the Flexible Time-Triggered communication paradigm to enhance the temporal behavior of Ethernet switches with respect to periodic streams. We explain the system architecture and we present a formulation of the global periodic traffic scheduling problem handled by the FTT master. Simulation and experimental results show the advantages of using such synchronized framework. 1...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the performance of}} 13 major ports of India in respect of key operational performance indicators. Following rapid economic growth India's share in international trade is escalating. This puts increased pressure on these ports, which handle {{a substantial portion of}} the trade to perform with optimal efficiency. The study presents a systematic analysis of different performance indicators for a ten-year time period (2003 to 2013) using a variety of statistical methods and evaluates status of each port in different categories of performance. This will enable the ports to gauge their own effectiveness and appraise reasons for their shortcomings. In this context, the work further develops an integrated composite performance index by relegating comparative weightages to different indicators, to assess the relative overall performance of different ports. The study underlines the need of such estimates to adjudge the consistency of performance, internal and <b>across</b> <b>ports</b> to enable planning and development of measures for enhanced performance. performance indicators; composite performance index; CPI; standardised composite performance index; SCPI; port grouping; statistical analysis; India...|$|E
40|$|Port {{authorities}} increasingly need {{to communicate}} {{with a variety of}} external stakeholders in order to maintain and strengthen the societal acceptance of seaport activities. The availability of socio-economic impact studies on port authority and regional development agency websites has often made this information accessible to the public at large. However, the differences in methodologies adopted, in terms of selecting, defining and measuring various types of socio-economic impacts, sometimes lead to misconceptions as well as misleading comparisons <b>across</b> <b>ports</b> within and between regions. In this paper, we suggest guidelines for the design and application of a potential best practice from an interregional perspective (UK, France and Belgium), based on research in the framework of a European Commission co-funded project, ‘IMPACTE’. The paper also aims to develop guidelines for comparing the socio-economic impacts of ports across regional and national borders and discusses the development of a European port economic impact measurement toolkit. We analyse a sample of 33 recent socio-economic impact assessment reports in terms of methodologies adopted and types of impacts measured.

40|$|This article {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} the performance of a panel of Southern European ports. In contrast with previous research, a multi-step approach is followed. This methodology allows distinguishing between the role of both factors that are external and internal to the organisation of the port in determining the relative ranking of ports in terms of efficiency. Furthermore, it enables the identification of the impact on an input-by-input basis. Managerial capacities, port infrastructure endowment and services are tested together with port policies, macroeconomic conditions and other external factors to verify their individual impact. In the first stage, efficiency is measured via the traditional input-oriented Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). In the second stage a stochastic frontier analysis in carried out through fixed-effect estimators in order to identify the determinants of input-specific efficiency differentials <b>across</b> <b>ports.</b> In general, governance-related factors and macroeconomic conditions predominate the managerial skills for the more flexible factors of production. The outcome of the DEA applied in the third stage shows that netting inputs of the impact of factors considered outside direct port managers’ control, relative to performances, change significantly. This is particularly true for multi-functional ports. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} market-based policy on {{pollution}} control {{in a region}} with multiple ports. Although the fraction of in-port pollution is modest compared to at-sea emission, port pollutions generally occur near populated areas and have a higher impact on public health. Most of the studies on maritime pollution control have focused on technical designs and operating issues over deep sea shipping. In addition, while pollution from a port's operation may spread out and has influence over a wider region, few studies have analyzed emission control <b>across</b> <b>ports.</b> This paper aims to complement this stream of research by examining the behaviors of ports and port users (i. e., shippers and shipping lines) if a certain incentive or disincentive policy is implemented. Our investigation reveals that {{in the absence of}} inter-port coordination, pollution spill-over and inter-port competition can lead to distorted pollution taxation and emission constraints. As a result, there will be excessive pollution and sub-optimal social welfare. Therefore, despite the potential competition among the ports in a region, it is important for them to coordinate their pollution control efforts. Our study recommends a regional approach in pollution control, and suggests areas where inter-port cooperation is needed among the competing ports. Department of Logistics and Maritime Studie...|$|E
40|$|The United States Navy {{is seeking}} {{substantial}} cost savings {{in the operation}} of its aircraft carrier fleet, including the costs of port visits. This thesis analyzes data on aircraft carrier port visits from fiscal years 2002 through 2007 to develop statistical models for characterizing and predicting port-visit costs. The models account for explanatory factors that include the ship and port, whether the ship is moored pier side or at anchor, length of the port visit, and the arrival date. A total of 13 U. S. Navy Carrier Vessel (CV) and Carrier Vessel Nuclear (CVN) aircraft carriers made 118 visits to ports in 25 countries during the period under study. For each port visit, individual lineitem expenses are aggregated into four categories and by total cost. Regression modeling is then used to identify factors that explain these categorized and total costs. For total costs, the average regression prediction error is about 17 percent. Costs are found to vary across ships and, more substantially, <b>across</b> <b>ports.</b> These findings can be used in the formulation of initiatives aimed at reducing the costs of aircraft carrier port visits.

40|$|Invasive {{species are}} a {{negative}} externality associated with imported goods. Policies aimed at excluding pests associated with imports include pre-shipment treatment requirements, varied inspection schemes, {{treatment at the}} border, penalties, and import bans or restrictions. Existing policies {{are based on the}} reasoning that increased enforcement effort will result in higher detection levels, or more specifically, that increased inspection will result in a higher number of interceptions and in turn, higher compliance. In addition to a deterrence effect, however, under which importers respond to increased enforcement with increased due care with respect to pest control, importers may respond in ways that regulators do not intend. For example, importers may choose to not bring goods into the country, may ship a reduced amount, or may switch ports-of-entry. Moreover, different types of firms are likely to respond to enforcement in different ways. In this paper, we present a framework to analyze invasive species border enforcement given heterogeneous importers and ports. We develop a theoretical model of firm response to border enforcement, analyze both the intended and unintended effects of this enforcement for different types of firms, and evaluate the tradeoffs associated with location. Firms not only consider the changes in the levels of enforcement and other conditions at a single port, they consider the cost and benefit tradeoffs associated with location e. g., differences in inspection intensity or port-entry fees versus distance to port-of-entry and final market <b>across</b> <b>ports</b> and may switch ports. The result is that increased inspection intensity may not result the overall damages from invasive species introductions. Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|E
