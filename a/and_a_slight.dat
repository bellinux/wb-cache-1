5|$|Although the tested {{potatoes}} {{were not}} a commercial variety and not {{intended for human consumption}} a contract was signed with Cambridge Agricultural Genetics, which included a profit-sharing agreement, if potatoes developed using this technology were approved and released commercially. In earlier ten-day feeding trials on GNA-fed rats, Pusztai concluded that they did not significantly affect growth, despite some hypertrophy of the small intestine <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> decrease of gut enzyme activity.|$|E
5|$|On May 19, 2009 a 20th anniversary {{stand-alone}} edition was released. This stand-alone version contains {{exactly the}} same special features as its anthology set (both DVD and Blu-ray) counterparts. There are two differences: This version includes a 50-page booklet guide to the film, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> variation in packaging from normal Blu-ray cases (i.e. a Warner Bros. digibook). They both include a digital copy of the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{mushroom}} is edible, {{with a mild}} taste <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> odor {{of maple}} syrup. American author David Arora suggests that the fruit bodies {{may be used in}} a manner similar to the candy cap mushrooms, despite being not as fragrant. Chefs in the San Francisco Bay Area have been known to use it for desserts such as ice creams, cakes and caramels.|$|E

5|$|After several {{exhausting}} {{tours of}} Italy, the band split in 1972. They reformed in 1975, releasing Godbluff and frequently touring Italy again, before a major line-up change <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> rename to Van der Graaf. The band split in 1978. After many years apart, the band finally united at a gig at the Royal Festival Hall {{and a short}} tour in 2005. Since then, the band has continued as a trio of Hammill, Banton, and Evans, who record and tour regularly in between Hammill's concurrent solo career.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Sounds President Larry Schmittou {{noticed a}} 5%drop in season ticket sales, a higher ratio of no-shows from season ticket holders, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> decline in overall attendance. These issues with spectator turnout were {{accompanied}} by a decline in local media coverage, particularly in regard to road games. In order to boost interest in the team, Schmittou tried, unsuccessfully, to purchase a Triple-A franchise late in the 1983 season. His desire to land a Triple-A team {{was part of a}} larger plan to put Nashville in a position to contend for a major league franchise in the future. Attendance continued to drop in 1984, as season ticket sales were down 12% and overall attendance was down almost 20%.|$|E
5|$|LACM 149371 is {{a poorly}} {{preserved}} molar-like tooth that largely lacks a recognizable enamel surface and shows many small grooves and holes on the crown surface. This suggests the tooth {{may have been}} chemically degraded, perhaps by acidic water or because it passed through the digestive tract of a predator. The roots are broken off, but remaining pulp cavities suggest the presence of four main roots, which are partially joined into two pairs. A smaller pulp cavity between those roots suggests the likely presence of a fifth root <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> depression in the tooth may represent another root.|$|E

5|$|Some changes {{introduced}} into Devil May Cry 4 are {{the presence of}} two playable characters, Dante and Nero, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> modification to the shop system. A new currency, Proud Souls, is used to buy new abilities while Red Orbs are used to buy items. Proud Souls are rewarded {{at the end of}} missions and the amount varies depending on how well the player performed. Cost of abilities also increase with the purchase of other abilities, though all abilities can be sold back for the original price.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the first}} episode to have Mila Kunis {{providing}} the voice of Meg. Lacey Chabert, the original voice of Meg, left the series due to time constraints with her acting role in Party of Five, as well as schoolwork. Kunis won the role after auditions <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> rewrite of the character, {{in part due to}} her performance on That '70s Show. Seth MacFarlane, the show's creator, called Kunis back after her first audition, instructing her to speak slower, and then told her to come back another time and enunciate more. Once she claimed that she had it under control, MacFarlane hired her.|$|E
5|$|When diving, {{this bird}} pulls its {{head back and}} then arches it forward into the water, with the body {{following}} <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> springing. The legs only start moving when they are underwater. When swimming {{on the surface of}} the water, the body of this grebe is relatively high, although none of the underparts are seen. The neck is held straight up in a relaxed manner, with the bill being held forward and parallel to the water. Each of the feet perform strong alternating strokes.|$|E

5|$|By 1978 {{the initial}} {{excavation}} work had uncovered {{a complete and}} coherent site with an intact ship structure and {{the orientation of the}} hull had been positively identified as being on an almost straight northerly heading with a 60-degree heel to starboard <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> downward tilt towards the bow. As no records of English shipbuilding techniques used in vessels like the Mary Rose survive, excavation of the ship would allow for a detailed survey of her design and shed new light on the construction of ships of the era. A full excavation also meant removing the protective layers of silt that prevented the remaining ship structure from being destroyed through biological decay and the scouring of the currents; the operation had to be completed within a predetermined timespan of a few years or it risked irreversible damage. It was also considered desirable to recover and preserve the remains of the hull if possible. For the first time, the project was faced with the practical difficulties of actually raising, conserving and preparing the hull for public display.|$|E

25|$|When Curly was 12, he accidentally {{shot himself}} in the left ankle while {{cleaning}} a rifle. Moe rushed him to the hospital and saved his life. The wound resulted in a noticeably thinner left leg <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> limp. He was so frightened of surgery that he never had the limp corrected. While with the Stooges, he developed his famous exaggerated walk to mask the limp on screen.|$|E
25|$|Two common {{tests of}} {{response}} inhibition used in humans are the go/no-go task, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> variant {{known as the}} stop signal reaction time (SSRT) test. During a go/no-task, the participant is trained over multiple trials to make a particular response (e.g., a key-press) when presented with a 'go' signal. On some trials, a 'stop' signal is presented just prior to, or simultaneously with the 'go' signal, and the subject must inhibit the impending response.|$|E
25|$|Set 96 to win {{after hitting}} from Dean Minors and Lionel Cann <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> Duckworth-Lewis adjustment, Bangladesh fell to 37 for three after three wickets from Saleem Mukuddem, but Shakib Al Hasan went unbeaten {{for his second}} match running against Bermuda, making 26 not out and a {{partnership}} of 59 for the fourth wicket with Mohammad Ashraful. Extras made up {{almost a quarter of}} the total, with Kevin Hurdle conceding seven wides in his four overs.|$|E

25|$|The Southern Pacific Company Railroad {{tracks were}} damaged {{in several places}} between Ventura and Gaviota. In particular, a portion between Naples and Santa Barbara was badly damaged and displaced. Seaside bluffs fell into the ocean, <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> tsunami was noted by {{offshore}} ships. The town was completely cut off from telephone and telegraph, and news {{from the outside world}} arrived by shortwave radio. The absence of post-earthquake fire permitted scientists to study earthquake damage to various types of construction.|$|E
25|$|On 2 February 1916, Berthold and Althaus flew an {{interception}} at about 15:00 hours. Dodging through spotty cloud coverage and sporadic rain, the duo set upon {{a pair of}} Voisin LAs and shot down one apiece. It was Berthold's first aerial victory. He would score another three days later. Then, on 10 February, Berthold was himself downed, with a holed fuel tank <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> wound to his left hand. He was rewarded with the Military Merit Order, 4th class on 29 February; one of only 12 Orders awarded to aviators during the war.|$|E
25|$|Helena {{began to}} flood <b>and</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> list {{of no more}} than five degrees was {{maintained}} by counter-flooding. Only one of the two engine rooms and one boiler room were flooded. Wiring to the main and secondary gun batteries was severed, but prompt action by damage control brought the forward diesel generator up within minutes, making power available to all gun mounts, for fire fighting and counter-flooding. With attacking planes flying overhead, the crew began to break out the service ammunition, and by 0801 hours the ship began to fight back by sending up anti-aircraft fire.|$|E
