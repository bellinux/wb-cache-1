Equity stock valuations, which are often much higher, are based on other considerations related to the business' operating cash flow, profits and future prospects; some factors are derived from the <b>accounting</b> <b>statement.</b> While accounting equity can potentially be negative, market price per share is always positive since equity shares represent ownership in limited liability companies. The principal of limited liability guarantees that a shareholder's losses may never exceed her investment.|$|E

50|$|<b>Accounting</b> <b>Statement</b> FAS 157 defines fair value, which {{under the}} new guideline, is {{typically}} referred to as “mark to market” accounting. With Auction Rate Securities no longer being liquid, public companies began to write down their ARS holdings starting {{in the first quarter}} of 2008. Through May 31, 2008, 402 publicly traded companies had reported Auction Rate Securities on their books. Of those 402, 185 had taken some level of impairment. However, there had been no ascertainable trend in the amount of writedowns taken. Firms have reported discounts ranging from 0-73% of par value. IncrediMail, Ltd. proved the most extreme example of this as it booked an impairment of 98% off face value for its ARS holdings, while Berkshire Hathaway took no impairment on its more than $3.5 billion of these securities. Some of the higher-profile firms taking writedowns include Bristol-Myers Squibb, 3M and US Airways. Citigroup took a $1.5 billion loss on its inventory of auction rate securities.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Skandia’s {{intellectual}} capital supplements are pioneering {{forms of communication}} that inform internal as well as external readers of the attempts to manage and create value from intellectual resources. These supplements to the financial <b>accounting</b> <b>statement</b> communicate not only in numbers but also in stories and illustrations about the challenges facing the firm. They help develop a narrative for the path ahead for Skandia as a ` ̀ capable’ ’ firm that thrives through intellectual resources found in humans, structures and relations. In this paper we discuss how this is possible and we suggest that {{intellectual capital}} statements are not only new types of communication; they also anticipate new ` ̀ contracts’ ’ between labour and management where employees are persuaded to help managers craft the strategies to be pursued in the marketplace of the future.
