5|$|The {{number of}} Persian ships and men {{involved}} with the battle are, <b>as</b> <b>so</b> <b>often</b> in the Greco-Persian Wars, somewhat problematic. It {{is clear that the}} Persian fleet did not dare conduct operations against the Greeks, and thus must have been approximately equal to, or smaller than the Greek fleet. Herodotus gives the size of the Persian fleet at 300 ships; the Greeks had 378 at Salamis, but must have suffered significant losses, and so they probably also had around 300 in total (though not necessarily all these ships formed part of the allied fleet for 479 BC). The Phoenician ships were dismissed from the Persian fleet before the battle, which reduced its strength further.|$|E

25|$|Most Lystrosaurus fossils {{have been}} found in the Balfour and Katberg Formations of the Karoo basin in South Africa; these {{specimens}} offer the best prospects of identifying species because they are the most numerous and have been studied for the longest time. <b>As</b> <b>so</b> <b>often</b> with fossils, there is debate in the paleontological community as to exactly how many species {{have been found}} in the Karoo. Studies from the 1930s to 1970s suggested a large number (23 in one case). However, by the 1980s and 1990s, only six species were recognized in the Karoo: L. curvatus, L. platyceps, L. oviceps, L. maccaigi, L. murrayi, and L. declivis. A study in 2011 reduced that number to four, treating the fossils previously labeled as L. platyceps and L. oviceps as members of L. curvatus.|$|E
25|$|<b>As</b> <b>so</b> <b>often</b> in {{the history}} of the abbey things did not go smoothly; {{preparing}} the site took considerable time and the first monks, led by Abbot John Chaumpeneys, did not arrive at Darnhall from Dore Abbey until 1274. The foundation of the new abbey provoked anger, resentment and strong resistance from the people of the area and the Darnhall site itself was found to be unsuitable for the huge buildings planned. In 1276 Edward, by now king, agreed to move the abbey to a better site and a location was chosen in nearby Over on the edge of the Forest of Mondrem. With its foundation, the new ecclesiastical site was named Vale Royal. In 1277 the King and Queen Eleanor and numerous great nobles arrived at Over to lay the foundation stones of the new abbey. In 1281 the monks moved from Darnhall to temporary accommodation on the Vale Royal site while the abbey started to rise around them.|$|E

500|$|During {{the first}} half of the 20th century The Relapse was {{relatively}} neglected, along with other Restoration drama, and experts are uncertain about exactly when Vanbrugh's original again resurged to prominence on the stage and thereby marginalised Sheridan's version. These experts now believe the play may have been first brilliantly rehabilitated by Anthony Quayle's 1947 production at the Phoenix Theatre, starring Cyril Ritchard as Lord Foppington and brought to Broadway by Ritchard in 1950. A musical version, Virtue in Danger (1963), by Paul Dehn and [...] "John Bernard", opened to mixed reviews. John Russell Taylor in Plays and Players praised the cast, which included Patricia Routledge as Berinthia and John Moffatt as Lord Foppington, but complained that the production was [...] "full of the simpering, posturing and sniggering which usually stand in for style and sophistication in Restoration revivals." [...] Following Donald Sinden's outstanding and award-winning performance at the Aldwych Theatre in the mid-1970s Vanbrugh's original play is now again a favourite of the stage. A 2001 revival by Trevor Nunn at the National Theatre was described by Sheridan Morley as [...] "rare, loving and brilliantly cast." [...] <b>As</b> <b>so</b> <b>often</b> with commentary on The Relapse, Morley focused on the role of Lord Foppington and its different interpretations: [...] "Alex Jennings superbly inherits the role of Lord Foppington which for 20 years or so belonged to Donald Sinden, and for another 20 before that to Cyril Ritchard." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{opening of}} 1915 saw growing {{division}} between Lloyd George and Kitchener over {{the supply of}} munitions for the army. Lloyd George considered that a munitions department, under his control, was essential to co-ordinate [...] "the nation's entire engineering capacity".

This did little to dampen press criticism and, on 20 April, Asquith sought to challenge his detractors in a major speech at Newcastle; [...] "I saw a statement {{the other day that}} the operations of our army were being crippled by our failure to provide the necessary ammunition.

[...] Most of their bishops and priests were either French or Spanish. [...] Most Vietnamese disliked and suspected this sizeable Christian community and its foreign leaders. [...] The French, conversely, began to feel responsible for their safety. [...] Harassment of the Christians eventually provided France with a respectable pretext for attacking Vietnam. [...] The tension built up gradually. [...] During the 1840s, persecution or harassment of Catholic missionaries in Vietnam by the Vietnamese emperors Minh Mạng and Thiệu Trị evoked only sporadic and unofficial French reprisals. [...] The decisive step towards the establishment of a French colonial empire in Indochina was not taken until 1858.|$|E

2500|$|Early in 1016, the Vikings {{crossed the}} Thames and harried Warwickshire, while Edmund Ironside's {{attempts}} at opposition {{seem to have}} come to nothing—the chronicler says the English army disbanded because the king and the citizenry of London were not present. The mid-winter assault by Cnut devastated its way northwards across eastern Mercia. Another summons of the army brought the Englishmen together, and they were met this time by the king, although [...] "it came to nothing <b>as</b> <b>so</b> <b>often</b> before", and Æthelred returned to London with fears of betrayal. Edmund then went north to join Uhtred the Earl of Northumbria and together they harried Staffordshire, Shropshire and Cheshire in western Mercia, possibly targeting the estates of Eadric Streona.

2500|$|The {{sources of}} De Almeida's {{knowledge}} are not spelled out, but {{they at least}} reflect contemporary views. His comments regarding the Hebrew knowledge of the Beta Israel of that time is very significant: {{it could not have}} come from recent intercourse with Jews elsewhere, so it indicates deep antiquity to Beta Israel traditions, at least at that time, before their literature was taken away from them and demolished by the later conquering Christians. (The more sceptical school of historians, whose views are discussed above, deny that the Ethiopian Jews ever knew Hebrew; they certainly have no Hebrew texts remaining, and have been forced in recent centuries to use the Christian [...] "Old Testament" [...] in Ge'ez after their own literature was destroyed.) It is also of interest that he mentions more Jewish communities dwelling beyond Ethiopia in the Sudan. [...] <b>As</b> <b>so</b> <b>often</b> in such medieval hearsay accounts, however, loose claims are made that may not be accurate.

It thus came to be tacitly agreed that a dead author usually hated what he described, hated it as much as we do, even, and wanted his book to shame everybody out of being so nasty ever again.
