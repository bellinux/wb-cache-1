5|$|Arafat's long {{personal}} and political survival was taken by most Western commentators {{as a sign of}} his mastery of <b>asymmetric</b> <b>warfare</b> and his skill as a tactician, given the extremely dangerous nature of politics of the Middle East and the frequency of assassinations. Some commentators believe his survival was largely due to Israel's fear that he could become a martyr for the Palestinian cause if he were assassinated or even arrested by Israel. Others believe that Israel refrained from taking action against Arafat because it feared Arafat less than Hamas and the other Islamist movements gaining support over Fatah. The complex and fragile web of relations between the US, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and other Arab states contributed also to Arafat's longevity {{as the leader of the}} Palestinians.|$|E

We present an inference algorithm for GLDMs called global/local particle filtering, that introduces the principle of reasoning globally about global dynamics and locally about local dynamics. We have applied GLDMs to an <b>asymmetric</b> urban <b>warfare</b> environment, in which enemy units form teams to attack important targets, and the task is to detect such teams as they form. Experimental results for this application show that global/local particle filtering outperforms ordinary particle filtering and factored particle filtering. ...|$|R
50|$|The rebels also {{adopted a}} form of <b>asymmetric</b> sea <b>warfare,</b> by using small, fast vessels to avoid the Royal Navy, and {{capturing}} or sinking large numbers of merchant ships; however the British responded by issuing letters of marque permitting private armed vessels to undertake reciprocal attacks on enemy shipping. John Paul Jones became notorious in Britain for his expedition from France in the little sloop of war Ranger in April 1778, during which, {{in addition to his}} attacks on merchant shipping, he made two landings on British soil. The effect of these raids, particularly when coupled with his capture of the Royal Navy's HMS Drake—the first such success in British waters, but not Jones's last—was to force the British government to increase resources for coastal defence, and to create a climate of fear among the British public which was subsequently fed by press reports of his preparations for the 1779 Bonhomme Richard mission.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} blast waves {{generated}} by energetic and non-energetic sources are of continuing {{interest to the}} ballistics research community. Modern conflicts are increasingly characterised by <b>asymmetric</b> urban <b>warfare,</b> with improvised explosive devices (IEDs) often playing a dominant role {{on the one hand}} and an armed forces requirement for minimal collateral effects from their weapons on the other. These problems are characterised by disparate length- and time-scales and may also be governed by complex physics. There is thus an increasing need to be able to rapidly assess and accurately predict the effects of energetic blast in topologically complex scenarios. To this end, this paper presents a new QinetiQ-developed advanced computational package called EAGLE-Blast, which is capable of accurately resolving the generation, propagation and interaction of blast waves around geometrically complex shapes such as vehicles and buildings. After a brief description of the numerical methodology, various blast scenario simulations are described and the results compared with experimental data to demonstrate the validation of the scheme and its ability to describe these complex scenarios accurately and efficiently. The paper concludes with a brief discussion on the use of the code in supporting the development of algorithms for fast running engineering models...|$|R
40|$|The {{changing}} face {{of contemporary}} military conflicts has forced {{a major shift}} of focus in tactical planning and evaluation from the classical Cold War battlefield to an <b>asymmetric</b> guerrilla-type <b>warfare</b> in densely populated urban areas. The new arena of conflict presents unique operational difficulties due to factors like complex mobility restrictions and the necessity to preserve civilian lives and infrastructure. In this paper we present a novel method for autonomous agent control in an urban environment. Our approach is based on fusing terrain information and agent goals {{for the purpose of}} transforming the problem of navigation in a complex environment with many obstacles into the easier problem of navigation in a virtual obstacle-free space. The main advantage of our approach is its ability to act as an adapter layer for a number of efficient agent control techniques which normally show poor performance when applied to an environment with many complex obstacles. Because of the very low computational and space complexity at runtime, our method is also particularly well suited for simulation or control of a huge number of agents (military as well as civilian) in a complex urban environment where traditional path-planning may be too expensive or where a just-in-time decision with hard real-time constraints is required...|$|R

40|$|Inequality in arms, indeed, {{significant}} {{disparity between}} belligerents, {{has become a}} prominent feature of various contemporary armed conflicts. Such asymmetries, albeit not at all a new phenomenon {{in the field of}} warfare, no longer constitute a random occurrence of singular battles. As a structural characteristic of modern-day <b>warfare</b> <b>asymmetric</b> conflict structures have repercussions on the application of fundamental principles of international humanitarian law. How, for example, can the concept of military necessity, commonly understood to justify the degree of force necessary to secure military defeat of the enemy, be reconciled with a constellation in which one side in the conflict is from the outset bereft of any chance of winning the conflict militarily? Moreover, military imbalances of this scope evidently carry incentives for the inferior party to level out its inferiority by circumventing accepted rules of warfare. This article attempts tentatively to assess the repercussions this could have on the principle of reciprocity, especially the risk of the instigation of a destabilizing dynamic of negativ e reciprocity which ultimately could lead to a gradual intensification of a mutual disregard of international humanitarian law...|$|R

40|$|Different {{meanings}} of the term ‘politics’ define its different dimensions - dimensions in which politics is being carried out. The overwhelming feature of contemporary politics is its mediatisation, which {{can be understood as}} ‒ according to Franciszek Ryszka, who said that “words create politics” - the hegemony of the symbolic sphere. Therefore, the study of politics should take into account not only the sphere of decision-making, but also the discourse which restricts and directs political activities. The case of Ukraine demonstrates that civic media (i. e. Media which are decentralized, non-hierarchical, based on networking and social media) are now the plane on which certain political ideas are manifested most fully, including declarations of intent to pursue a particular doctrine of the state. At the same time - due to its axiological marking – civic media are becoming an important forum for various discourses in the service of community. The analysis of politics, perceived as power over the meaning, is the primary dimension of the analysis, since other planes of politics and corresponding analytical areas are, in the modern world, increasingly subordinated to the discursive sphere which creates a meaningful (discursive, symbolic, axiological etc.) framework for political action. The article discusses the impact of civic journalism on political change - from the “Orange Revolution” to “Revolution of Dignity”. This section of the article presents, among other issues, the most important means of civic journalist narration.

25|$|There {{have been}} {{a wide variety of}} rapidly {{advancing}} tactics throughout the history of war, ranging from conventional war to <b>asymmetric</b> <b>warfare</b> to total war and unconventional warfare.

These fields have also overlapped in the forms of marines, paratroopers, aircraft carriers, and surface-to-air missiles, among others.

40|$|Defence {{organizations}} {{have to meet}} the challenge of a changed focus in military missions towards <b>asymmetric</b> and irregular <b>warfare</b> and Stability, Security, Transition and Reconstruction (SSTR) operations. A range of operations (e. g., psychological operations, humanitarian missions) are performed in a large variety of locations and cultures (e. g., Africa, Asia). In this type of mission, influencing target audiences is one of the (many) methods available to achieve the desired effects. Cultural differences between practitioners and the target audiences could have a negative impact upon influencing activities.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyse the {{efficacy}} and legality of drones in modern warfare. It argues that the use of drones is a specific characteristic of modern warfare strengthening the conclusion that modern warfare cannot be explained sufficiently by the classic understanding of peace and war anymore. It is the <b>asymmetric</b> nature of <b>warfare</b> and armed conflict that makes the use of drones both necessary and dangerous at the same time. In particular, the long-term effects on the population directly affected by drone strikes and the resultant consequences for the relationship between the involved states as well as the possible change in the dynamic of modern armed conflicts evolving from growing knowledge and cheaper technology are reason for concern regarding the to date unregulated use of drones both in- and outside combat. In addition to the socio-political concerns, the paper outlines that, from a legal point of view, the use of drones is not as unproblematic as military and government officials tend to say. Using statistics from the US army and the US CIA, this paper will argue that the technology itself is indeed able to be highly precise and efficient. This, however, does not mean that the application of drones does not leave room for highly disproportionate attacks. It is the humane application of the weapon that makes the difference. Considering both the socio-political effects and the problems arising from the core principles of LOAC, particularly proportionality, this paper will argue that it is necessary to create a legal frame work regulating the use of drones in- and outside combat...|$|R
