5|$|Aerith was {{designed}} by Tetsuya Nomura, with influence from director and scenario writer Yoshinori Kitase and Hironobu Sakaguchi, whilst Yoshitaka Amano created conceptual artwork which also helped to influence her design. She has green eyes and long brown hair tied in a braid with a pink ribbon. She wears a long pink dress, a bolero jacket, and brown hiking boots. The long dress {{was designed}} to appear ladylike and as <b>a</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> Tifa Lockhart's miniskirt. During development, Aerith {{was supposed to be}} Sephiroth's sister as both designs resembled each other, but they were made former lovers with Aerith remembering Sephiroth when meeting Cloud as both are ex-SOLDIERS. Late during development, Aerith's first love was changed to Zack Fair.|$|E
5|$|As in {{many other}} ISSF events, the target for air pistol was reduced in size in 1989, also {{lowering}} the scores (although not by much), and thereby resetting all records. The development after this shows <b>a</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> that of air rifle shooting: whereas in air rifle the winning score of the 1989 World Championships would not have reached the final 17 years later, the same result increase has not occurred in air pistol, and Sergei Pyzhianov's world record of 593 points, set in the first World Cup Final with the new targets, remained unbeaten for almost 20 years.|$|E

5|$|Larsson was {{commissioned}} to decorate all {{the walls of}} the central staircase in the museum except for one, and he wanted to decorate the last wall as well. He intended the last wall to present <b>a</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the other illustrations of the staircase. Whereas the painting Gustav Vasa enters Stockholm 1523 presented a midsummer theme with a triumphant king, Larsson wanted the last illustration to be a midwinter theme with a king who sacrificed himself for his people.|$|E
5|$|Summerteeth (stylized as summerteeth) is {{the third}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band Wilco, released on March 9, 1999 by Reprise Records. The album was heavily influenced lyrically by 20th century literature, as well as singer Jeff Tweedy's marital problems. Unlike previous albums, Summerteeth was heavily overdubbed {{in the studio with}} Pro Tools. Tweedy and Jay Bennett wrote most of the album in the studio, <b>a</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the band's previous albums, which were often recorded live by the entire band with minimal overdubs.|$|E

5|$|Elle Bishop is {{a fictional}} {{character}} who {{appeared on the}} American psychological thriller science fiction series Heroes, which aired on NBC from 2006 to 2010. The character was created by series creator Tim Kring and portrayed by actress Kristen Bell. Elle was created by Kring to act as <b>a</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> {{the rest of the}} characters, who had all recently found out they had abilities, whereas Elle had known her whole life. Bell, who had previously starred in the then recently cancelled series Veronica Mars, was a fan of the series and had met up with the writers that informed her they would love to have her on the show. While the character of Elle was created before Bell was cast, following her casting, the character was slightly altered to better resemble her. Elle was one of the new characters introduced in the second season and according to contract, would continue on the series for at least 13 episodes into season three.|$|E
5|$|For the 40th {{anniversary of}} All Things Must Pass, EMI reissued the album in its {{original}} configuration, in a limited-edition box set of three vinyl LPs. Available via participating Record Store Day retailers, with each copy individually numbered, the release took place on 26 November 2010. In what Bergstrom notes as <b>a</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the more aggressive marketing campaign run simultaneously by John Lennon's estate, to commemorate Lennon's 70th birthday, a digitally remastered 24-bit version of the album was made available for download from Harrison's official website. The reissue coincided with the Harrison estate's similarly low-key release of the Ravi Shankarâ€“George Harrison box set Collaborations and East Meets West Music's reissue of Raga, the long-unavailable documentary on Shankar that Harrison had helped release through Apple Films in 1971.|$|E
5|$|Ivy's {{alternate}} character {{designs in}} the games are <b>a</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> her primary designs, with the secondary from Soulcalibur to Soulcalibur III consisting of countess attire of either blue or red pants, vest, and jacket, with white boots covering her feet and her hair combed back. In Soulcalibur II, a tertiary alternate design was added consisting of a red leotard and gloves with gold trimming, with red stockings on her legs; in addition, a fourth design resembling her appearance {{at the conclusion of}} Soulcalibur was considered, incorporating a cloak and the symbol of caduceus on the front of her leotard cupping her breasts, but was unused. In Soulcalibur III, a long, rose-themed dress with hat and veil was used as a tertiary alternate, one of several considered designs. For Soulcalibur IV, a similarly themed black dress was used as her sole alternate design for the game.|$|E

5|$|Released in 1989, Adobe Garamond is {{designed}} by Robert Slimbach for Adobe Systems, {{based on a}} Roman type by Garamond and an italic type by Robert Granjon. The font family contains regular, semibold, and bold weights and was developed through viewing fifteenth-century equipment at the Plantin-Moretus Museum. Its quite even, mature design attracted attention on release for its authenticity to Garamond's work, <b>a</b> <b>contrast</b> <b>to</b> the much more aggressive ITC Garamond popular at the time. The OpenType version of the font family was released in 2000 as Adobe Garamond Pro, with enhanced support for its alternate glyphs such as ligatures, small caps and italic swash capitals, and is sold through Adobe's Typekit system. It {{is one of the}} most popular versions of Garamond in books and fine printing.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{treats the}} problem of {{determining}} the lift, moment, and induced drag of a thin wing of circular plan form in uniform incompressible flow {{on the basis of}} linearized theory. <b>As</b> <b>contrasted</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> similar paper by Kinner, in which the acceleration potential method was used, the present paper utilizes the concept of the velocity potential. Calculations of the lift and moment are presented for several deformed shapes. It is shown that considerable deviations exist between the strip theory analysis and the more exact theory. The lift, moment, and induced drag are also determined for a harmonically oscillatory circular plan form wing. <b>As</b> <b>contrasted</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> similar paper by Schade, in which the acceleration potential method was used, the present paper utilizes the concept of the velocity potential. Expressions for lift, moment, and induced drag are given and finally specialized to the case of a slowly oscillating circular wing...|$|R

25|$|Tocqueville {{asserted}} that the values that had triumphed in the North and {{were present in the}} South had begun to suffocate old-world ethics and social arrangements.
