25|$|Compressibility is an {{important}} factor in aerodynamics. At low speeds, the compressibility of air is not significant in relation to aircraft design, but as the airflow nears and exceeds the speed of sound, a host of new <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>effects</b> become important in the design of aircraft. These effects, often several of them at a time, made it very difficult for World War II era aircraft to reach speeds much beyond 800km/h (500mph).|$|E
25|$|The Ba.88 had all {{the design}} {{specifications}} {{to be a very}} effective heavy fighter-bomber. It had a slim, streamlined shape (noted by all aviation observers), a rugged structure, heavy firepower, long range and high speed, with the same horsepower of medium bombers such as the Br.20 (but at 9tonnes/10tons vs. 5tonnes/6tons). Despite its promising beginning, the addition of military equipment in the production series aircraft resulted in high wing loading and detrimental <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>effects</b> with a corresponding loss of performance, below any reasonable level. The contract was subsequently canceled, but production was later resumed, mostly for political reasons to avoid closing production lines of Breda and its satellite company IMAM.|$|E
25|$|Most phylogenetically {{advanced}} insects {{have two}} pairs of wings located on {{the second and third}} thoracic segments. Insects are the only invertebrates to have developed flight capability, and this has played an important part in their success. Insect flight is not very well understood, relying heavily on turbulent <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>effects.</b> The primitive insect groups use muscles that act directly on the wing structure. The more advanced groups making up the Neoptera have foldable wings, and their muscles act on the thorax wall and power the wings indirectly. These muscles are able to contract multiple times for each single nerve impulse, allowing the wings to beat faster than would ordinarily be possible.|$|E

25|$|In its Special Bulletin of 18 February 2008, the AAIB noted {{evidence}} that cavitation {{had taken place}} in both high pressure fuel pumps, which could be indicative of a restriction in the fuel supply or excessive aeration of the fuel, although the manufacturer assessed both pumps as still being able to deliver full fuel flow. The report noted the aircraft had flown through air that was unusually cold (but not exceptionally so), and concluded that the temperature had not been low enough to freeze the fuel. Tests were continuing in an attempt to replicate the damage seen in the fuel pumps and to match this to the data recorded on the flight. A comprehensive examination and analysis was to be conducted on the entire aircraft and engine fuel system, including modelling fuel flows, taking account of environmental and <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>effects.</b>|$|E

2500|$|As {{with all}} spinners, leg spinners bowl the ball far slower (70–90km/h or 45–55mph) than fast bowlers. The fastest leg spinners will {{sometimes}} top 100km/h (60mph). Leg spinners typically use variations of flight by sometimes looping {{the ball in}} the air, allowing any cross-breeze and the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>effects</b> of the spinning ball to cause the ball to dip and drift before bouncing and spinning (usually called [...] "turning") sharply. While very difficult to bowl accurately, good leg spin {{is considered one of the}} most threatening types of bowling to bat against, since the flight and sharp turn make the ball's movement extremely hard to read and the turn away from the batsman (assuming he or she is right-handed) is more dangerous than the turn into the batsman generated by an off spinner.|$|E
2500|$|The Vampyr had a {{fuselage}} with {{a simple}} rectangular cross-section but that of the Greif was more refined, with an elliptical section, though both were rather similar in profile. Both fuselages were completely ply skinned over wooden bulkheads and stringers. [...] The Greif's wing was mounted closer to the fuselage than on its predecessor, with the consequence that a cut-out {{had to be made}} in the leading edge for the pilot's head. This turned out to have deleterious <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>effects.</b> [...] Its undercarriage consisted of a pair of semi-recessed wheels with balloon tyres on the centreline, one under the nose and the other larger one under the wing spar. [...] The tail surfaces of the Greif were very similar to those of the Vampyr; a rectangular all-moving tailplane was hinged at the extreme rear of the fuselage with the rudder hinged at the same point. The fin was broad as required by the short fuselage; fin and rudder had straight vertical edges and a straight, rising top. The bottom of the rudder was parallel with its top, leaving room the tailplane movement.|$|E
2500|$|For taxiing {{and during}} the {{beginning}} of the take-off, aircraft are steered by a combination of rudder input as well as turning the nosewheel or tailwheel. [...] At slow speeds the nosewheel or tailwheel has the most control authority, but as the speed increases the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>effects</b> of the rudder increases, thereby making the rudder more and more important for yaw control. [...] In some aircraft (mainly small aircraft) both of these mechanisms are controlled by the rudder pedals so there is no difference to the pilot. [...] In other aircraft there is a special tiller controlling the wheel steering and the pedals control the rudder, and a limited amount of wheel steering (Usually 5 degrees of nosewheel steering). [...] For these aircraft the pilots stop using the tiller after lining up with the runway prior to take-off, and begin using it after landing before turning off the runway, to prevent over correcting with the sensitive tiller at high speeds. The pedals may also be used for small corrections while taxing in a straight line, or leading in or out of a turn, before applying the tiller, to keep the turn smooth.|$|E

The wind shear effect was computed using a modified vortex-lattice computer program and characterized through the formulation of wind shear aerodynamic coefficients. The magnitude of the <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>effect</b> was demonstrated by computing the resultant change in the aerodynamics of a conventional wing and tail combination on a fixed flight path through a simulated microburst.

40|$|Abstract. Against {{the problem}} of the <b>aerodynamic</b> {{interference}} <b>effects</b> on aerostatic coefficients between parallel continuous rigid frame bridges with high-pier and long-span, the <b>aerodynamic</b> interference <b>effects</b> on aerostatic coefficients of main beam in the parallel long-span continuous rigid frame bridges were investigated in details by means of wind tunnel test. The space between the two main beams and wind attack angles were changed during the wind tunnel test to study the <b>effects</b> on <b>aerodynamic</b> interferences of aerostatic coefficients of main beam. The test got aerostatic coefficients of 10 conditions. The research results have shown that the <b>aerodynamic</b> interference <b>effects</b> on aerostatic coefficients of main beam in parallel bridges can not be ignored. The <b>aerodynamic</b> interference <b>effects</b> on parallel bridge main beam is shown mainly as follows: The drag coefficient of main beam downstream dropped and the drag coefficient of main beam upstream changed but not change significantly. There are also the <b>aerodynamic</b> interference <b>effects</b> of lateral force coefficient and torque coefficient between the main beams upstream and downstream.

40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration {{has been}} {{conducting}} {{a series of tests}} to determine the effect of heavy rain on airfoil aerodynamics.

50|$|Dynamic stall is a {{non-linear}} unsteady <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>effect</b> {{that occurs}} when airfoils rapidly change the angle of attack. The rapid change can cause a strong vortex to be shed from {{the leading edge of}} the aerofoil, and travel backwards above the wing.

As soon as it passes behind the trailing edge, however, the lift reduces dramatically, and the wing is in normal stall.|$|R

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{deals with}} the {{trajectory}} planning of a soccer ball driven by a kicking robot. The trajectory of a ball is function of its initial velocity, launch angle, and some <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>effect.</b> Specially, the initial velocity is created by an instant impulse given to the ball. The external impulse exerted to a ball by a kicking robot is function of robot geometry and dynamic parameters. Initially, we analyze the external impulses for several kicking postures and simulate trajectories for several different kicking conditions. Based on this observation, a trajectory-planning algorithm of a ball, in which the initial velocity and the launch angle of the ball are calculated for a desired trajectory of the ball, is proposed, and then an external impulse required for that motion is calculated and applied to the kicking simulation. The <b>aerodynamic</b> <b>effect</b> such as drag force and lift force is also incorporated into the dynamic simulation of the soccer ball. A kicking robot has been developed for experimental verification of the proposed analytical methodology. It was shown that experimental result is in good agreement with simulation result within 10 % error bound...|$|R
