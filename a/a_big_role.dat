Page and James M. Lentz. In 1912, a simple cement pad was poured around the marker. The first modern Navajo government convened in 1923 {{in an effort to}} organize and regulate an increasing amount of oil exploration activities on Navajo lands, and they would play <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>role</b> in the monument's further development.|$|E
5|$|Buildings play <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>role</b> in gameplay, as {{they are}} used for {{training}} civilian and military units, researching improvements, supporting population, providing structural defense or as resource providers. The buildings portrayed in Age of Empires III resemble the architectural design of that era. All of the games in the series share several buildings, including the Town Center and Docks. The appearance and attributes of a building change as the player advances through the Ages, and some civilizations have their own unique buildings. The appearance of these buildings depends on the civilization. Some buildings can only be built at certain times like the defensive towers.|$|E

5|$|In 1937, {{when the}} {{government}} required that Hindi be taught in the school system, E.V. Ramasamy organised opposition to this policy through the Justice Party. After 1937, the Dravidian movement derived considerable support from the student community. In later years, opposition to Hindi played <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>role</b> {{in the politics of}} Tamil Nadu. The fear of the Hindi language had its origin in the conflict between Brahmins and non-Brahmins. To the Tamils, acceptance of Hindi in the school system was a form of bondage. When the Justice Party weakened in the absence of mass support, E.V. Ramasamy took over the leadership of the party after being jailed for opposing Hindi in 1939. Under his tutelage the party prospered, but the party's conservative members, most of whom were rich and educated, withdrew from active participation.|$|E

Liu Quiyi (劉揆一), Jiao Dafeng (焦達峰), Zhang Boxiang (張伯祥) and Sun Wu (孫武) established Gongjinhui (Progressive Association) (共進會). In January 1911, the revolutionary group Zhengwu Xueshe (振武學社) was renamed as Wenxueshe (Literary society) (文學社). Jiang Yiwu (蔣翊武) was chosen as the leader.

25|$|Music (or Mezmur in Amharic, the Ethiopian {{national}} language) plays <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>role</b> in {{preaching and}} the daily life of Ethiopian P'ent'ay Christians.

25|$|Numerous {{studies have}} shown that gender {{stereotyping}} plays <b>a</b> <b>big</b> <b>role</b> in influencing women’s academic and career aspirations by reducing their interest in male-typed occupations like engineering, leadership and mathematics. In a 2002 study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, a group of researchers found that gender-stereotypic television commercials can restrain women academically and professionally. Exposure to the stereotypic commercials resulted in women underperforming on a subsequent math test and avoiding math items in favor of verbal items. Furthermore, the women who viewed the stereotypic commercials expressed less interest in quantitative fields and more interest in verbal domains, both academically and professionally.|$|E
