As long as it's coming from a genuine place. I actually am a big fan of that song and a big fan of the Johnny Cash cover. But that song in particular really speaks to me. Lyrically it's a song that is very intense and has painful lyrics. It's reflective of <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was at. When I recorded it, it was healing to get it out." ...|$|E
500|$|Lifehouse {{lead singer}} Jason Wade had many inspirations when writing songs for Who We Are.

[...] Like {{the first time you}} realize there's more to that relationship than you thought. I had to dig a little for that one, but I find myself at <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> can write stuff that's a little deeper than your average love song in terms of emotion." [...] Wade was inspired to write [...] "The Joke" [...] after he read a newspaper article that detailed the story of a British boy who hung himself as a result of being bullied by his fellow schoolmates. The song [...] "Broken" [...] was written by Wade after he visited a friend in Nashville that needed a kidney transplant.|$|E

500|$|The song [...] "Cyprus Avenue" [...] is a three chord blues {{composition}} and served {{for many years}} as the closing song for most of Morrison's live shows. [...] Along with [...] "Madame George", it {{is the centerpiece of}} the album and both songs are Belfast related and highly impressionistic. [...] The song is told {{from the point of view}} of an outsider watching from inside an automobile and getting tongue-tied as the refined school girl he fantasizes about appears and he imagines her a fine lady with [...] "rainbow ribbons in her hair" [...] in a carriage drawn by six white horses and [...] "returning from a fair". Van Morrison described Cyprus Avenue as [...] "a street in Belfast, [...] a place where there's a lot of wealth. [...] It wasn't far from where I was brought up and it was a very [...] different scene. [...] To me it was a very mystical place. [...] It was a whole avenue lined with trees and I found it <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> could think." ...|$|E

She also stated [...] "The album is almost like a diary I have been keeping over the last two years", [...] "Every track has a meaning behind it that's personal to me.

2500|$|Rather than hiding or {{trimming}} her laissez faire views, Lane {{seized the}} chance to sell them to the readership. She sought out topics of special interest to her audience. Her first entry characterized the Double V campaign {{as part of the}} more general fight for individual liberty in the United States. She wrote, [...] "Here, at last, is <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> belong. [...] Here are the Americans who know the value of equality and freedom." [...] Her columns highlighted success stories of blacks to illustrate broader themes about entrepreneurship, freedom, and creativity. In one, she compared the accomplishments of Robert Vann and Henry Ford. Vann's rags to riches story illustrated the benefits in a [...] "capitalist society in which a penniless orphan, one of a despised minority can create The Pittsburgh Courier and publicly, vigorously, safely, attack a majority opinion" [...] while Ford's showed how a poor mechanic can create [...] "hundreds of jobs ... putting even beggars into cars." ...|$|E
2500|$|Regarding his {{treatment}} of the family he had with his wife, he stated, [...] "I am not the beast the media make me to be". Regarding {{his treatment}} of Elisabeth and her children in the cellar, {{he explained that he}} brought flowers for Elisabeth and books and toys for the children into the [...] "bunker", as he called it, and often watched videos with the children and ate meals with Elisabeth and the children. Fritzl decided to imprison Elisabeth after she [...] "did not adhere to any rules any more" [...] when she became a teenager. [...] "That is why I had to do something; I had to create <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> could keep Elisabeth, by force if necessary, away from the outside world." [...] He suggested that the emphasis on discipline in the Nazi era, during which he grew up, might have influenced his views about decency and good behavior. The chief editors of News magazine noted in their editorial that they expected Fritzl's statement to form the basis of the defence strategy of his lawyer. Critics said his statement may have been a ploy to prepare an insanity defence.|$|E

2500|$|The NAACP of Portland withdrew {{its support}} of the protest, accusing the {{original}} organizers of failing to discuss discrimination affecting minority groups, specifically immigrants, Muslim women, and women of color. The group's president said she was told that those issues, along with anti-Trump and Black Lives Matter messaging and signage, were [...] "too political". As {{a result of the}} affiliate's criticism, a small group of women from Eastern Oregon who served as the original organizers of the Portland event were replaced with new leaders to [...] " [...] a larger platform to women of color". After the NAACP chapter was made aware of the leadership changes, its president explained: [...] "I felt it was important that we not miss this teachable moment about what role of race and religion and class were playing in pulling this march together." [...] Furthermore, she told Willamette Week: [...] "Putting a black woman's face {{at the beginning of the}} march doesn't fundamentally change the reason we withdrew our support. It's always been the case that if somebody suffers a racist incident, you're just supposed to suck it up and then, for the sake of unity, let's all join hands and pretend it didn't happen.

2500|$|Describing the {{increase}} in his rate of killing in the two months prior to his arrest, he stated he had been [...] "completely swept along" [...] with his compulsion to kill, adding: [...] "It was an incessant and never-ending desire to be with someone at whatever cost. Someone good looking, really nice looking. It just filled my thoughts all day long." [...] When asked {{as to why he}} had preserved a total of seven skulls and the entire skeletons of two victims, Dahmer stated {{he had been in the}} process of constructing a private altar of victims' skulls which he had intended to adorn upon the black table located in his living room and upon which he had photographed the bodies of many of his victims. This display of skulls was to be adorned at each side with the complete skeletons of Ernest Miller and Oliver Lacy. The four severed heads found in his kitchen were to be removed of all flesh and used in this altar, as was the skull of at least one future victim. Incense sticks were to be placed at each end of the black table, above which Dahmer intended to place a large blue lamp with extending blue globe lights. The entire construction was to be placed before a window covered with a black, opaque shower curtain, in front of which Dahmer intended to sit in a black leather chair. When asked in a November 18, 1991 interview who the altar was dedicated to, Dahmer replied: [...] "Myself ... It was <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> could feel at home." [...] He further described his intended altar as a [...] "place for meditation," [...] from where he believed he could draw a sense of power, adding: [...] "If this [...] had happened six months later, that's what they would have found." ...|$|E
