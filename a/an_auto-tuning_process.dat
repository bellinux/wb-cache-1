40|$|Abstract—Stencils {{represent}} an important class of computations {{that are used}} in many scientific disciplines. Increasingly, many of the stencil computations in scientific applications are being offloaded to GPUs to improve running times. Since {{a large part of the}} simulation time is spent inside the stencil kernels, optimizing the kernel is therefore important in the context of achieving greater computation efficiencies and reducing simulation time. In this work, we proposed a novel in-plane method for stencil computations on GPUs and compared its performance with the conventional method implemented in the Nvidia SDK. We also implemented <b>an</b> <b>auto-tuning</b> framework for our method to select the optimal parameters for different GPU architectures. A performance model was developed for our proposed method, and is used to speed up the <b>auto-tuning</b> <b>process.</b> Our results show that a speedup of nearly 2 × can be achieved compared to Nvidia’s implementation.

40|$|Abstract—As high {{performance}} computing (HPC) heads towards the exascale era, the computing power surges tremen-dously and applications will scale {{to hundreds of}} thousands cores. Consequently, the amount of data processed and gener-ated will increase dramatically. Nowadays, a parallel shared file system is a must have for a supercomputer.

40|$|This study investigates {{application}} of analytical sensor redundancy to improve reliability of gas turbine control system. Analytical redundancy, {{which uses a}} reference engine model to provide redundant estimates of a measured engine variables, has been utilized {{as a basis for}} the proposed sensor fault detection and accommodation method. Model-based compensation of measurement fault is usually resolved by introducing virtual engine sensors, which are obtained via accurate engine modelling. In this paper, a real-time dynamic gas turbine engine model is used in order to generate the redundant virtual measurements. The engine model accuracy directly determines the validity of the modelbased approach for sensor fault diagnosis, and hence <b>a</b> model with <b>auto-tuning</b> capability is deployed as a reference for the gas turbine. The proposed fault detection technique examines the residuals between the redundant channels. Once the discrepancy between the virtual and the sensor measurement exceeds the prescribed tolerance levels, the sensor fault diagnosis determines the state of the switching logic in the dual lane control configuration. The deployed logic is also used for reconfiguration of the <b>auto-tuning</b> <b>process.</b> When <b>a</b> sensor fault occurs, the estimation process is affected, and hence the tuning process must be adjusted to account for this deficiency. Single and multiple sensor failures are simulated during the gas turbine transient manoeuvre to assess capability of the proposed model-based detection and accommodation method.

40|$|It is {{rare for}} a {{programmer}} {{to solve a}} numerical problem with a single library call; most problems require a sequence of calls. In the case of linear algebra, programmers will chain a series of Basic Linear Algebra Subprogram (BLAS) library calls to achieve the desired result. When a sequence of BLAS calls is memory bound, {{a great deal of}} performance is missed because optimization has not occurred between library routines. It is not practical to create a library with every required sequence of linear algebra operations, {{but at the same time}} it is difficult for programmers to write their own high performance implementation.

40|$|Sparse Matrix-Vector {{multiplication}} (SpMV) is {{an important}} computational kernel in scientific applications. Its performance highly depends on the nonzero distribution of sparse matrices. In this paper, we propose a new storage format for diagonal sparse matrices, defined as Compressed Row Segment with Diagonal-pattern (CRSD). We design diagonal patterns to represent the diagonal distribution. As the diagonal distributions are similar within matrices from one application, some diagonal patterns remain unchanged. First, we sample one matrix to obtain the unchanged diagonal patterns. Next, the optimal SpMV codelets are generated automatically for those diagonal patterns.
