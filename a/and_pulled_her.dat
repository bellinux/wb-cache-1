5|$|Falkenberg and Næsheim {{held onto}} Bågenholm's skis {{as they waited}} for the rescue teams to arrive. At first Bågenholm {{struggled}} in the cold water before she found an air pocket and was able to remain conscious for 40minutes before becoming a victim of circulatory arrest. Ketil Singstad led the rescue team {{from the top of the}} mountain. He skied as fast as he could to Bågenholm's location, where he and his rescue team tried unsuccessfully to pull her out with a rope. They then tried to dig her out, but their snow shovel could not break through the ice. Rescuers from the bottom of the mountain then arrived, bringing with them a pointed gardening shovel. They were able to cut a hole in the ice, <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> through at 19:40. Bågenholm had been in the water for 80minutes when she was rescued.|$|E
25|$|As she {{was being}} pulled out, Krekian grabbed another little girl's arm <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> out as well.|$|E
25|$|On July 4, 2007, at 11:00a.m., a 29-year-old female from Fort Wayne, Indiana {{died after}} {{collapsing}} {{near the edge}} of The Wave, falling face-down into two inches of water. Lifeguards immediately responded <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> out, then attempted to revive her with help from park medical personnel. Resuscitation attempts continued as the victim was transported by ambulance to Jasper Memorial Hospital, where she died. An autopsy determined the cause of death to be congestive heart failure.|$|E

25|$|Of {{the twenty}} {{who survived the}} sinking, only one was a female. Anna Boecker was a shy, quiet maid in the {{employment}} of an elderly lady, travelling with her employer to Southampton. In the panic and confusion of the collision she had been unable to save her employer. She joined the terrified crush of passengers lowered into the first lifeboat. When it capsized under the sheer weight of numbers, Anna ended up in the ocean. All the others from her lifeboat clambered back onto the sinking ship. Anna was alone in the treacherous sea until the survivors in the second lifeboat spotted her foundering in the water <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> up to safety.|$|E
25|$|Marianne Vos {{signaled}} {{her presence}} {{right after the}} start, as she attacked during the first kilometer but was caught soon after. The pace was high from the beginning, and the first climb saw some riders struggling already. In front of the peloton, the Polish and Lithuanian riders were setting the pace, as well as Rebecca Much from the United States who was present in front during the whole race. The first lap was completed after {{a bit more than}} 26 minutes, with the peloton still together. Climbing the Torricelle for the second time, the race got a little more nervous with some attacks, but the leading riders from Italy, Germany and East-European countries controlled the pace. Another rider in front was Amanda Spratt from Australia, who closed the gap to a Polish rider's attack. The field slowly diminished in number, as some struggled to keep up and the first riders abandoned. After passing the finish line for the second time, {{at the foot of the}} Torricelle climb, Spratt crashed inside the bunch, but got up quickly again, made it back to the front and even attacked soon after that. The Italian riders were paying attention <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> back. Instead, Francesca Andina and Savrina Bernardi escaped, but were caught by the leading bunch under control of the Ukrainian riders. Spratt was relentless in her efforts, but could not create a gap on her own. With two laps to go the Italian Savrina Bernardi set the pace in the climb and the only riders able to follow were Spratt and Ekaterina Tretiakova from Russia, until a chase group of about 15 joined them on the descent. For the final lap, another group of 15 joined them making a field of about 30 riders, half of the peloton, that rode the decisive phase of the race. The Italian and Dutch teams attacked each other on the last climb, but no break attempt was as powerful as the one by Vos. She took off and nobody could follow. Increasing her lead rapidly, it was about 20 seconds on top of the Torricelle climb, and the chase group down the descent had three other Dutch riders in it, not helping it much. Rebecca Much from the United States was leading the group on her own, and during the last kilometres it became apparent that Vos would take her solo to the finish. The other Dutch riders therefore did not hold back any more and managed to place a second rider on the podium, Ellen van Dijk, who crossed the line right after Marta Bastianelli from Italy.|$|E

2500|$|After {{two hours}} had elapsed - {{a time when}} the {{frequent}} appearance of Japanese aircraft prohibited the use of lights and made the handling of lines, hoses, and damage control equipment difficult - Vigilance finally succeeded in extinguishing USS England's fires and took the destroyer escort under tow. Underway for the northern entrance of Kerama Retto at 2135, the two ships arrived at their destination two hours later. There, at the harbor entrance, [...] took England under tow <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> inside the anchorage. At that time, the harbor was blanketed with smoke as enemy aircraft were again in the vicinity. Vigilance crept alongside [...] at 0110 on 10 May and transferred USS England's casualties to the transport. Gherardi (DD-637) and YMS-93 soon arrived and transferred 25 more survivors to the transport.|$|E
2500|$|Texas law {{provides}} for police officer discretion in arresting any person caught committing a misdemeanor, such as violating its mandatory seat belt laws. Violation of its seat belt law in 1999 was punishable with the maximum fine of $50. [...] In March 1997, Gail Atwater, a long-term resident of Lago Vista, Texas, was driving her pick-up truck with her three-year-old son and five-year-old daughter from soccer practice. [...] One {{of the children}} had lost a toy and she allowed them to unbuckle their seat belts to stand {{to search for the}} toy; hence, none of them were wearing seat belts. Police officer Bart Turek, then with the city of Lago Vista, recognized Ms. Atwater <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> <b>her</b> over. According to court records, witnesses observed that Atwater and her children remained in her pick up when Turek approached the driver's side window and aggressively jabbed his finger toward Atwater’s face. According to Atwater's complaint (allegations, previously supported by witnesses at the scene, that the court also presumed to be true for its purposes), Turek screamed at Atwater about the seatbelts, frightening her children. When Atwater calmly and in a normal tone requested that Turek lower his voice. Turek immediately yelled [...] "you’re going to jail." [...] According to the record, Atwater remained calm when Turek told her she was going to jail. She did not act suspiciously, she did not pose any threat to Turek, and she did not engage in any illegal conduct other than failing to wear a seat belt. Turek continued to verbally abuse Atwater, accusing her of not caring for her children. Atwater's children and bystanders, including friends and other Lago Vista residents who drove or walked by, witnessed Turek's tirade.|$|E

60|$|She found that, {{in all her}} {{outgoings}} and her incomings, he prevented her.
