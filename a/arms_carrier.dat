5000|$|The {{introduction}} of the rail service further eroded the towns main coaching inns (the Swan and Talbot and the Angel) as local transport centres. Despite this the number of inns in the town remained almost unchanged from sixteen in 1837 to fifteen by 1861. [...] Despite this, many innkeepers were forced to seek supplementary incomes including an agricultural machinist (Blacksmiths <b>Arms),</b> <b>carrier</b> (Crown Inn), wheelwright (Fox Inn), purveyor of wines and spirits (Red Lion), farmer (White Hart) and a blacksmith (White Horse). [...] The coming of the railway dented Wetherby's importance as a coaching town greatly. What's more, the town wasn't to get the crucial rail link to Leeds until 1876.|$|E

The analysis and evaluation presented in this paper demonstrates that for an output voltage with a given number of levels and same amount of stored energy in the <b>arms,</b> <b>carrier</b> interleaving between the arms of the MMC results in a similar overall performance compared to an MMC without carrier interleaving, despite having less SMs in each arm. The set of presented results complement existing analysis for carrier interleaving applied to MMCs with a given number of SMs per arm. The simulation and experimental results confirm the similar performance of the two configurations and modulation techniques...|$|E

30|$|There are two {{possible}} explanations for {{the origin of the}} magnetic minerals that were <b>ARM</b> <b>carriers</b> at the deeper sites and lost by storage diagenesis. The water quality data (Fig.  4) revealed that hypolimnion water deeper than 18  m was characterized by high turbidity and high chlorophyll a concentrations (Fujiwara et al. 2003 b; Seto et al. in preparation), which implies that fine-grained magnetic minerals might have been supplied in suspension in the hypolimnion water delivered from the Pacific Ocean. However, ARM acquisition and demagnetization curves for sediments from the deep sites (Fig.  3 f) were different from those observed at the shallow sites around the Takase-gawa River (Fig.  3 c). Thus, it is more plausible that authigenic formation of iron sulfide occurred in the deeper lake floor sediments, which are overlain by anoxic water with high salinity and high organic matter content. This assumption is consistent with the occurrence of greigite in Holocene lake sediments such as those in Loch Lomond (Snowball and Thompson 1990). It is difficult, however, to clarify the magnetic mineralogy of the <b>ARM</b> <b>carriers</b> from the available data because it has been affected by storage diagenesis, which suggests that freezing of samples immediately after recovery is crucial for future environmental magnetic studies of organic-rich sediments.|$|R

30|$|Our {{measurements}} of the magnetic susceptibility and ARM of dredged sediment samples from Lake Ogawara showed that medium sand samples at shallow littoral sites are characterized by high magnetic concentrations. The results of stepwise acquisition and demagnetization of ARM showed several patterns that possibly represent differences in the provenance of the sediments and different water depths. For the sites at water depths greater than 10  m, where lake floor sediments consist of greenish black mud with very high TOC contents, the magnetic susceptibility and ARM decreased with increasing water depth, although the initial measurements in 2012 showed {{a slight increase in}} the ARM for water depths greater than 16  m. The <b>ARM</b> <b>carriers</b> were characterized by a narrow coercivity range around 40  mT, but this component was considerably reduced after sample storage for about 3  years. Although {{it is not clear whether}} the <b>ARM</b> <b>carriers</b> were the result of authigenic formation of iron sulfide or the deposition of material suspended in the hypolimnion water, we suggest that the magnetic properties of the surficial sediments on the lake floor are controlled by both their location in the basin and the limnological stratification of the brackish lake water. However, we conclude that freezing of samples immediately after recovery to avoid the effects of storage diagenesis is crucial for future environmental magnetic studies of organic-rich sediments. The results of our study may provide an analog for down-core variations of magnetic parameters associated with modification of magnetic minerals during reductive diagenesis.|$|R

5000|$|... 1976 was CANE's initial year of protest. There were demonstrations at Perth Airport, and Rockingham, against US nuclear <b>armed</b> <b>carriers</b> {{headed by}} Barrie Machin: http://barriemachin.com, a {{lecturer}} at the University of Western Australia (UWA). CANE, under Barrie Machin's leadership, was {{very active in}} its criticism of the Fox Report 1977. It {{was also the first}} anti-nuclear organisation to draw attention to Aboriginal Land Rights and Uranium mining. Gloria Brennan, who was the first Aboriginal student at the Department of Social Anthropology at UWA, was invited to join CANE and lobby and inform Aboriginal communities in WA. She did this very successfully. Gloria later died of cancer, probably brought about from the fall-out from the Maralinga tests.|$|R

(2015) {{presented}} the magnetic properties of sediment collected from Lake Ogawara {{to examine the}} limnological conditions on the Pacific coast of northeastern Japan shortly after the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and flooding of the lake by tsunami waves. At water depths below 10  m, the magnetic susceptibility and anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) of high organic content greenish-black mud decreased considerably with increasing water depth.

Although {{it is not clear}} whether the <b>ARM</b> <b>carriers</b> were the result of authigenic iron sulfide formation or the deposition of material suspended in the hypolimnion water layer, they suggest that the magnetic properties of the surficial sediments on the lake floor are controlled by both their location within the basin and the limnological stratification of the brackish lake water.|$|R

30|$|To examine limnological {{conditions}} in Lake Ogawara on the Pacific coast of northwestern Japan, we investigated the magnetic properties of dredged bottom sediment originally {{collected from the}} lake {{in the summer of}} 2011. We used non-destructive methods to measure the low-field magnetic susceptibility shortly after sampling, and anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM) was assessed in 2012 and 2015. The ARM acquisition and demagnetization curves from littoral sites showed several patterns that reflect the provenance of the sediments. At water depths below 10  m, the magnetic susceptibility and ARM of greenish black mud with high organic content decreased considerably with the increase in water depth, but ARM increased slightly at water depths greater than 16  m. We also found that the magnetic concentrations of mud samples were reduced markedly during a period of storage for about 3  years. We attributed these reductions to diagenetic loss of magnetic minerals, which had been enhanced at deeper sites. It is possible that the <b>ARM</b> <b>carriers</b> in deeper areas were derived from authigenic formation of iron sulfide or from deposition of suspended matter in the hypolimnion water. We propose that the magnetic properties of surficial sediments are controlled by limnological stratification of the brackish lake water, thus possibly providing an analog for down-core variations of magnetic parameters associated with the modification of magnetic minerals during reductive diagenesis.|$|R
