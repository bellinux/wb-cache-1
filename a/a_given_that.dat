500|$|Zack Handlen, {{writing for}} The A.V. Club, had mixed {{feelings}} about the episode, ultimately rating it a B-. He felt that the character of Virgil Incanto was [...] "wonderfully gross", although he [...] "lacks the universal creepiness" [...] of first season villain Eugene Tooms, from the episode [...] "Squeeze". Handlen also felt that the episode was let down {{by the fact that}} it [...] "takes it as <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>that</b> single women are targets", failing to give any real depth to its female characters. An overview of the third season in Entertainment Weekly also rated the episode a B-, and called Incanto a [...] "fine example" [...] of the series' [...] "unassuming" [...] villains, comparing him to Tooms and to the second season villain Donnie Pfaster. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five, calling it [...] "a retread of Squeeze" [...] and [...] "a little too formulaic to be truly satisfying". However, Shearman and Pearson felt that the episode [...] "has a heart to it" [...] and [...] "jogs along at a fair pace", also praising its gory visuals.|$|E
500|$|Suggesting {{that many}} of the {{philosophical}} and political underpinnings of the author's short stories stemmed from his views on domestic life, Palmer's focus turned to Dick's common use of sterility as a metaphor. In [...] "The Gun", [...] "Second Variety", The Penultimate Truth, and [...] "The Last of the Masters", people and sometimes the earth itself have been driven to sterility. As Palmer noted of [...] "The Last of the Masters", Bors can be interpreted as a symbol of infertility: [...] "It is not clear why he does not replicate himself, or educate his human servants: it is simply <b>a</b> <b>given</b> <b>that</b> he is sterile. The old, technologically advanced, highly organized civilization is a civilization of production, but now under Bors it can do no more than maintain itself." [...] Following an inspection of other short stories with similar references to sterility, Palmer asserts that Dick's work presented a social and existential protest. Palmer interpreted Dick's social critique to be that if the act of creation validates existence, and genuinely expresses a form of individuality, then the process of reproduction is alienating, oppressive, and retards an individual's liberty. As Palmer explains, [...] "...this process disempowers consumers, and even technocrats, by making them dependent on a process of which they have become entirely ignorant." [...] Existentially, Palmer interpreted Dick to further mean that reproduction violated the author's concept of what made an object unique and valuable: [...] "A thing can't be a real thing unless it is in some sense an individual thing." ...|$|E

[...] Editor from Rolling Stone Arion Berger, called it [...] "nasal, silken and declarative" [...] while [...] "riding the percolating beat."
