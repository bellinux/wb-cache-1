5|$|Geoffrey and Maud's oldest granddaughter, Joan, married Roger Mortimer in 1301, giving Mortimer {{control of}} Ludlow Castle. Around 1320, Roger built the Great Chamber block {{alongside}} the existing Great Hall and Solar complex, copying what {{was becoming a}} popular tripartite design for domestic castle buildings in the 14th century; an <b>additional</b> <b>building</b> was also constructed by Roger on {{the location of the}} later Tudor Lodgings, and the Guardrobe Tower was added to the curtain wall. Between 1321 and 1322 Mortimer found himself on the losing side of the Despenser War and, after being imprisoned by Edward II, he escaped from the Tower of London in 1323 into exile.|$|E
5|$|The first West Saxon nunneries {{were founded}} in Ine's reign by Ine's kinswoman, Bugga, the {{daughter}} of King Centwine, and by Ine's sister Cuthburh, who founded the abbey of Wimborne at some point after she separated from her husband, King Aldfrith of Northumbria. At the bishop Aldhelm's suggestion in 705, Ine built the church which later became Wells Cathedral, and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle also records that Ine built a minster at Glastonbury. This must refer to <b>additional</b> <b>building</b> or re-building since there was already a British monastery at Glastonbury.|$|E
5|$|The {{rectangular}} west {{tower was}} a relatively short defensive structure, {{designed to protect the}} more vulnerable western slope of the ridge. A similar tower in the south overlooks the entrance to the castle. At {{the north end of the}} castle is the hall, stretching across the courtyard; in the east corner is an <b>additional</b> <b>building,</b> probably built by the English at the end of the 13th century. Although the hall is relatively large, 50 by 27feet (15 by 8m), these buildings follow a simpler design to those current in England at the time, where a combination of a hall, chamber and a service block in castles was becoming more common.|$|E

5|$|Various architects {{were invited}} by an {{appointed}} War Memorial Board to submit designs for a memorial intended to honor all {{who fought in}} World War I and also to provide meeting places, archives, and offices for the American Legion. The partnership of Walker and Weeks of Cleveland, Ohio was chosen in 1923. Their plan consisted of a main memorial and two auxiliary buildings, an obelisk, a mall, and a cenotaph. Bids for the American Legion building, {{one of the two}} auxiliary buildings, were put out in 1925 and construction by the Craig-Curtiss Company began the same year. In style the structure complimented the nearby local library. The second auxiliary building was not constructed until 1950. When Congress authorized the payment of World War I veterans' bonuses in 1936, the state of Indiana used the money for construction of the memorial plaza, rather than paying it to the veterans. The Neoclassical design incorporated the existing library, federal building, and University Park. One <b>additional</b> <b>building</b> was planned but never built.|$|E

NMSUC has a student population of approximately 2,000 {{and a staff}} of 104 faculty. Previously known as the Carlsbad Instructional Center, the campus was established in 1950 as the state's first community college. It was renamed a branch of NMSU in 1960. The present-day main building was built in 1980; an additional instruction center was added in 1987 and the computer facilities wing was completed in 1996. By 2011, the campus had added an <b>additional</b> <b>building</b> to house its nursing program, the Allied Health and University Transfer Center.|$|E
25|$|By 1978, {{another factor}} began to {{influence}} the debate. The school, now over 600 strong with a regular 3 form entry into the senior department was desperately cramped and any <b>additional</b> <b>building</b> could only now {{take place at the}} expense of playing field space. In late 1978 {{it became clear that the}} whole of the convent site was available and an offer to buy would be accepted subject to surveys and discussion of associated issues. The contract was signed in March 1979 at an agreed price of £250,000 although it was immediately obvious that a considerable amount of repair and remedial work would be necessary over the next years. The acquisition of the convent buildings meant that, in theory at least, the immediate overcrowding problem was averted but there was still the issue of cost and fees.|$|E

In July, Berkshire acquired a 90% equity interest in MiTek Inc., which makes engineered connector products, engineering software and services, and manufacturing machinery for the truss fabrication segment of the building components industry and is headquartered in Chesterfield, Missouri. Finally in 2001, Berkshire acquired 87 percent of Dalton, Georgia-based Shaw Industries, Inc. Shaw is the world’s largest carpet manufacturer based on both revenue and volume of production and designs and manufactures over 3,000 styles of tufted and woven carpet and laminate flooring for residential and commercial use under approximately 30 brand and trade names and under certain private labels. In 2002, Berkshire Acquired the remaining 12.7 percent of Shaw.|$|E

25|$|After a time {{he moved}} to Healey, in Burnley, Lancashire. Here in 1663 he was placed under arrest on suspicion, and was shortly {{afterwards}} committed to custody at Skipton, on the charge of keeping a conventicle. Soon after his release he was arrested while riding in Lancashire, and confined in York Castle for some months in the winter. In 1664 he was seized at a conventicle and imprisoned for eleven weeks in Lancaster Castle; in 1665 he was again under arrest. He had {{a friend in the}} presbyterian Lady Hoghton, whom he frequently visited at Hoghton Tower, Lancashire. In 1667 he bought the farmhouse of Wymondhouses (Pendleton), at the foot of Pendle Hill, near Clitheroe, in the parish of Whalley, Lancashire. In 1669 he was committed to gaol at Preston for six months, under the Five Miles Act, for preaching near Altham. On the indulgence of 1672 he took out licenses for four preaching places at and about Wymondhouses. An ingenious arrangement of the staircase at Wymondhouses enabled him to evade arrest while preaching there after the revocation of indulgence. He was committed, however, for preaching at Slaidburn, near Clitheroe, in 1674, and was fined £20. In 1684 he was brought before Chief-justice Jeffreys at Preston for keeping conventicles, was bound over to the next assizes, and was then discharged by Baron Atkins. At the revolution he built a meeting-house at Wymondhouses adjoining his residence. In 1689 an <b>additional</b> <b>building</b> was licensed at Sparth, and another later at Newton-in-Bowland, both in the parish of Whalley.|$|E

2500|$|The {{design of}} the many {{buildings}} of the cultural center were assigned to various architects Hitler favored.
