All measurements were done by one investigator, 10  days apart, and showed a significant correlation at the 0.01 level. However, multiple measures done by a series of investigators would be necessary to determine the reproducibility of the measures.|$|E

40|$|A Bayesian model {{averaging}} {{approach to}} the estimation of lag structures is introduced and applied {{to assess the impact}} of (R&D) on agricultural productivity in the United States from 1889 to 1990. Lag and structural break coefficients are estimated using a reversible jump algorithm that traverses the model space. In addition to producing estimates <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> coefficients, the probability that a given lag (or break) enters the model is estimated. The approach is extended to select models populated with gamma distributed lags of different frequencies. Results are consistent with the hypothesis that R&D positively drives productivity. Gamma lags are found to retain their usefulness in imposing a plausible structure on lag coefficients, and their role is enhanced through the use of model averaging.

Under the assumption that innovations are rare, we obtain a bursty branching process of speciations.

For a tree with n leaves generated by the introduced model, the average distance of leaves from root scales as (log n) 2 to be compared to log n for random branching. The mean values <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> tree shape indices depth (Sackin index) and imbalance (Colless index) of the model are compatible with those of real phylogenetic trees from databases.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to study the influence of maternal effects on the genetic evaluation of sire production in Tabapuã beef cattle. Single and multiple trait analyses were done with adjusted animal weights at 120, 240 and 420 days of age. Antagonism was observed between additive direct and maternal genetic effects, with the maternal effect being higher until weaning. The inclusion of maternal effects in the models removed part of the additive variance only in single trait analyses and resulted in smaller means <b>and</b> <b>standard</b> <b>deviations</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> sire breeding values. The use of maternal effect associated with single or multiple traits may affect sire ranking. The contradictory results of the single and multiple trait analyses for additive direct and maternal effects indicate that caution is needed when considering recommendations about the importance of maternal effects in Tabapuã beef cattle...|$|E
