25|$|Resistance: Fall of Man is a first-person shooter set in an {{alternate}} history. Many of its gameplay features stem from this, {{most notably the}} weapons. Some weapons are based on real weapons circa the 1950s, while some weapons are futuristically altered {{in accordance with the}} game's storyline. Insomniac Games has combined its passion for creating exotic weapons and vehicles, such as those found in the Ratchet and Clank series, with its proprietary development engine and physics system to create unique human and Chimeran weaponry. Each weapon provides a unique play style and strategy. An example of this is found with the Auger (Chimeran). The primary fire for this weapon is simple rapid fire, but the bullets burrow through walls, actually coming out stronger on the other side, opening up <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> <b>level</b> of strategy. The secondary fire creates a barrier that is resistant to all bullets but its own. In addition to the usual short- and long-range weapons, the game features several different types of grenades, with both historical and futuristic varieties. For example, one grenade, known as the Backlash grenade, is capable of creating a dome-shaped barrier, where the player can enter for cover. The barrier reflects shots from opposing Chimera. Some weapons are not available on the first play-through of the game but can be found at certain locations on replaying the game.|$|E

[...] While working for the series, Richards worked with Hans Rosenfeldt, the Swedish writer who created The Bridge.

500|$|Michelle Gibson and Deborah Townsend Meem, {{authors of}} Femme/Butch, commended the video for showing {{a shift in}} power between the sexes, declaring that [...] "Madonna assertively claimed all {{possible}} gender space like Marlene Dietrich." [...] Professor Carol Vernallis noted in her book, Experiencing Music Video that the diffused light around Madonna in the video was adopted to mimic the diffusion of sound and make the borders around Madonna appear soft, and her body spread outwards. In the book The 1980s, authors Bob Batchelor and Scott Stoddart called [...] "Express Yourself" [...] as one of Madonna's most challenging videos. They noted the video for its [...] "exploitation" [...] of the male body and sexualizing them {{as an object of}} desire. The authors also added that the video [...] "was a colorful homage to the term gaze, but Madonna is the bearer of it—not men." [...] Batchelor explained that the scenes of Madonna performing alone in her room and atop the stairs suggested that she was the object of the gaze, however it seemed to them that she was mocking the movement of the men below. [...] "She controls the mind of the men below, with a form of siren's song of female empowerment, signalling that the men do move in unison to her song", Stoddart concluded. Elizabeth Edwards, {{one of the authors of}} Visual Sense: A Cultural Reader, explained that the shot of Madonna crawling on the floor, while another image of hers watches from a nearby sofa, illustrated the mutation that Madonna's image was undergoing. According to her, Madonna was acting out self-consciousness by [...] "watching herself". She concluded by saying, [...] "'Express Yourself' gives its viewers a whole new series of image references to traditional American gendered and sexual icons—male and female—and <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> <b>new</b> <b>level</b> of irony." [...] Shari Benstock and Suzanne Ferriss, authors of On Fashion, deconstructed the video for its display of the artificiality of images of gender. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine reviewed the video in 2003, and commented that the video [...] "is the embodiment of 'queer chic', a bombastic masterpiece that heralds Madonna's uncanny ability to use her consumer-driven image to code her feminist politics." ...|$|E

Salon.com's Andrew Leonard stated:The success is all the more remarkable because [...] without mass market publicity or any kind of buzz in the fantasy/SF scene. George R. R.
