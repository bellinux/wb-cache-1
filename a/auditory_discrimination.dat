25|$|In 2008, S Heim et al. {{was one of}} {{the first}} studies not to just compare {{dyslexic}}s with a non dyslexic control, but to go further and compare the different cognitive sub groups with a non dyslexic control group. Different theories conceptualise dyslexia as either a phonological, attentional, auditory, magnocellular, or automatisation deficit. Such heterogeneity suggests the existence of yet unrecognised subtypes of dyslexics suffering from distinguishable deficits. The purpose of the study was to identify cognitive subtypes of dyslexia. Out of 642 children screened for reading ability 49 dyslexics and 48 controls were tested for phonological awareness, <b>auditory</b> <b>discrimination,</b> motion detection, visual attention, and rhythm imitation. A combined cluster and discriminant analysis approach revealed three clusters of dyslexics with different cognitive deficits. Compared to reading-unimpaired children cluster no. 1 had worse phonological awareness; cluster no. 2 had higher attentional costs; cluster no. 3 performed worse in the phonological, auditory, and magnocellular tasks. These results indicate that dyslexia may result from distinct cognitive impairments. As a consequence, prevention and remediation programmes should be specifically targeted for the individual child's deficit pattern.|$|E

Animals were studied using <b>auditory</b> <b>discriminations</b> {{based on the}} position of the sound and on the spectral content differences between a pure tone and a noise. After the percentage of correct responses reached asymptote, head orientation was measured using videotape recordings. Orientation occurred on virtually every trial and was under the control of {{the position of the}} sound under all conditions. Lever responding was controlled by the same parameters of the sound under some conditions, and by different parameters in others. Orientation and lever responding were correlated (a level response could be predicted from the direction of orientation) when both responses were {{under the control of the}} same parameters of the sound. The two responses were uncorrelated when they were controlled by different parameters of the sound. Orientation and lever responding were not functionally related...|$|R
50|$|A radically {{different}} {{approach has been}} developed by Tallal and colleagues, who have devised a computer-based intervention, Fast Forword, that involves prolonged and intensive training on specific components of language and auditory processing. The theory underlying this approach maintains that language difficulties are caused by a failure to make fine-grained <b>auditory</b> <b>discriminations</b> in the temporal dimension, and the computerised training materials are designed to sharpen perceptual acuity.|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} test the {{effectiveness}} of classroom translations of some laboratory procedures for teaching simple <b>auditory</b> <b>discriminations</b> to learners with developmental disabilities. Three participants with autism and mental retardation were trained to make topographically distinct responses {{in the presence of}} two different stimuli, either a pure tone and silence, or two tones. A portable electronic piano keyboard was used to produce tones. Delayed prompt and differential reinforcement procedures were used to teach the responses.

40|$|Background and Aim: Contralateral {{stimulation}} with noise {{can improve}} <b>auditory</b> intensity <b>discrimination.</b> This {{may be related}} to function of the efferent system. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the relationship between the <b>auditory</b> intensity <b>discrimination</b> and the efferent system function. Methods: Twenty students with normal hearing were included in this descriptive-analytic study. We examined Difference Limen for Intensity (DLI), Otoacoustic Emissions suppression and Speech In Noise. DLI was evaluated with and without contralateral noise stimulation at two different stimulus levels (20, 70 dB SL). Results: There was significant difference between mean DLI scores of with contralateral masking comparing to without it, which was more prominent as frequency increased. Mean DLI score while masking with white noise was more than mean scores when masking with narrow band noise (p< 0. 05). Transient evoked otoacoustic emissions responses decreased significantly in amplitude with contralateral masking. (p< 0. 05) Conclusion: These results suggest that medial olivocochlear bundle functions as a key role in <b>auditory</b> intensity <b>discrimination...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between language, {{performance on the}} Assessment of Basic Learning Abilities (ABLA) test, and stimulus equivalence was examined. Five participants with minimal verbal repertoires were studied; 3 who passed up to ABLA Level 4, a visual quasi-identity discrimination and 2 who passed ABLA Level 6, an auditory-visual non identity discrimination. Only the latter 2 participants demonstrated positive equivalence test outcomes similar to previous studies (Brady & McLean, 2000; Carr, Wilkinson, Blackman, & Mcllvane, 2000). The results suggest that well-developed language skills are not necessary to demonstrate positive outcomes on equivalence tests among three 3 -member stimulus classes, and that visual and <b>auditory</b> <b>discriminations</b> {{as measured by the}} ABLA test may be prerequisite for the learning of equivalence relations. A controversy exists {{as to whether or not}} individuals with minimal verbal repertOires can learn stimulus equivalence. Studies that have addressed this question have typically rel ied on global measures of language assessment (e. g., Carr, Wilkinson, Blackman, & Mcllvane, 2000). Perhaps research on this topic can be advanced by measures of more precise language discriminations of which participants are capable, such as visual and <b>auditory</b> <b>discriminations</b> assessed by the Assessment of Basic Learning Abilities (ABLA) test (Kerr, Meyerson, & Flora, 1977), and/or by a test of echoics, tacts, and mands. The present research is a step in that direction...|$|R
50|$|Moreover, {{musicians and}} music {{educators}} {{may be able}} to lessen the amount of practice they have to physically do by honing their auditory imagery due to the refinement of <b>auditory</b> <b>discrimination</b> and organization.

5000|$|Innovation {{and problem}} solving tasks are {{the most widely used}} {{experimental}} measures of non-human intelligence. The same assessment often uses several tasks, which may involve memory, spatial reasoning, visual and <b>auditory</b> <b>discrimination,</b> and object manipulation. [...] Innovation has often been observed in animals, typically involving novel solutions to everyday problems or the use of tools to achieve a goal. Instances include termite fishing in chimpanzees or nut cracking in robust capuchins. Such observations provide ecologically valid measures without the need for experimentation.|$|E
50|$|MMN, {{which is}} {{elicited}} irrespective of attention, provides an objective means for evaluating possible <b>auditory</b> <b>discrimination</b> and sensory-memory anomalies in such clinical groups as dyslexics and patients with aphasia, {{who have a}} multitude of symptoms including attentional problems. Recent results suggest that a major problem underlying the reading deficit in dyslexia might be an inability of the dyslexics' auditory cortex to adequately model complex sound patterns with fast temporal variation. According {{to the results of}} an ongoing study, MMN might also be used in the evaluation of auditory perception deficits in aphasia.|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} auditory cortex&#x 2019;s {{role in this}} {{frequency discrimination}} task, we used GABA-A receptor agonist muscimol to transiently and reversibly inactivate auditory cortexes bilaterally in rats performing simple interleaved <b>auditory</b> and olfactory <b>discrimination.</b> With olfactory discrimination performance serving as internal control for motivation and decision making capability, we found only <b>auditory</b> two-tone <b>discrimination</b> was selectively impaired in these rats.

40|$|How does {{attention}} modulate sensory representations? In {{order to}} probe the underlying neural mechanisms, we established a simple rodent model of modality-specific attention.

50|$|The {{concept of}} a perceptual noise {{exclusion}} deficit (impaired filtering of behaviorally irrelevant visual information in dyslexia or visual-noise) is an emerging hypothesis, supported by research showing that subjects with dyslexia experience difficulty in performing visual tasks (such as motion detection {{in the presence of}} perceptual distractions) but do not show the same impairment when the distracting factors are removed in an experimental setting. The researchers have analogized their findings concerning visual discrimination tasks to findings in other research related to <b>auditory</b> <b>discrimination</b> tasks. They assert that dyslexic symptoms arise because of an impaired ability to filter out both visual and auditory distractions, and to categorize information so as to distinguish the important sensory data from the irrelevant.|$|E
50|$|Naturally, {{abnormalities}} {{in speech}} mechanisms {{would need to}} be ruled out by a medical professional. Therapies for articulation problems must be individualized to fit the individual case. The placement approach—instructing the individual on the location in which the tongue should be and how to blow air correctly—could be helpful in difficulties with certain speech sounds. Another individual might benefit more from developing <b>auditory</b> <b>discrimination</b> skills, since he/she has not learned to identify error sounds in his/her speech. Generalization of these learned speech techniques will need to be generalized to everyday situations. Phonological process treatment, on the other hand, can involve making syntactical errors, such as omissions in words. In cases such as these, explicit teaching of the linguistic rules may be sufficient.|$|E
50|$|Music therapy {{interventions}} {{used with}} children can {{fall into two}} categories. The first, Supportive active therapy, is product- oriented and can included rhythm activities such as body percussion (stomping feet, clapping hands, etc.), singing songs which re-inforce nonmusical skills, awareness and expression, or movement to music (as simple as marching to the beat, as complex as structured dances). The second area is called Insight music therapy which is process-oriented. Activities could include song-writing, active listening and reacting, or <b>auditory</b> <b>discrimination</b> activities for sensory skill development. Music therapy for children is conducted either in a one-on-one session or in a group session. The therapist typically plays either a piano or a guitar, which allows {{for a wide variety}} of musical styles to suit the client's preferences. The child is usually encouraged to play an instrument adapted to his or her unique abilities and needs. These elements are designed to improve the experience and outcome of the therapy.|$|E
40|$|Two {{different}} prompting {{procedures to}} teach visual and <b>auditory</b> <b>discriminations</b> to autistic children were compared. The first involved presenting an added cue as an extra-stimulus prompt. This required {{the child to}} respond to both prompt and training stimulus. The second involved {{the use of a}} within-stimulus prompt. This consisted of an exaggeration of the relevant component of the training stimulus and thus did not require that the child respond to multiple cues. The results indicated that (1) children usually failed to learn the discriminations without a prompt, (2) children always failed to learn when the extra-stimulus prompt was employed but usually did learn with the within-stimulus prompt, and (3) these findings were independent of which modality (auditory or visual) was required for the discrimination...|$|R

40|$|Rammsayer & Brandler (2002) have {{proposed}} that <b>auditory</b> temporal <b>discrimination</b> tasks provide a measure of temporal resolution of the CNS which is argued to be partly responsible for higher order cognitive functioning. We report on two studies designed to elicit {{the nature of the}} functions underpinning these auditory tasks. Study 1 assessed whether temporal generalisation (TG) might be better considered as a measure of working memory rather than of temporal resolution of the CNS. In N = 66 undergraduates TG did not predict speed of processing tasks; however, there was evidence of a relationship between TG and working memory. Study 2 reanalyzed pre- viously published data on temporal discrimination tasks and showed that the relationship between auditory tem- poral tasks and intelligence reflects memory functions and processing speed. <b>Auditory</b> temporal <b>discrimination</b> tasks are confounded by speed and memory and should not be considered as measures of temporal resolution of the CNS.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was two-fold.

40|$|Auditory spatial functions, {{including}} {{the ability to}} discriminate between the positions of nearby sound sources, are subserved by a large temporo-parieto-frontal network. With the aim of determining whether and when the parietal contribution is critical for <b>auditory</b> spatial <b>discrimination,</b> we applied single pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation on the right parietal cortex 20, 80, 90 and 150 ms post-stimulus onset while participants completed a two-alternative forced choice <b>auditory</b> spatial <b>discrimination</b> task in {{the left or right}} hemispace. Our results reveal that transient TMS disruption of right parietal activity impairs spatial discrimination when applied at 20 ms post-stimulus onset for sounds presented in the left (controlateral) hemispace and at 80 ms for sounds presented in the right hemispace. We interpret our finding in terms of a critical role for controlateral temporo-parietal cortices over initial stages of the building-up of auditory spatial representation and for a right hemispheric specialization in integrating the whole auditory space over subsequent, higher-order processing stages...|$|R
