People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way I try to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E

25|$|The reason Spinoza {{thinks the}} {{parallelism}} follows from this axiom {{is that since}} the idea we have of each thing requires knowledge of its cause, and this cause must be understood under the same attribute. Further, {{there is only one}} substance, so whenever we understand some chain of ideas of things, we understand that the way the ideas are causally related must be the same as the way the things themselves are related, since the ideas <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> are the same modes understood under different attributes.|$|E

500|$|Production of {{the album}} began quickly with {{the writing of the}} track [...] "Politik", which was a song seen as a {{reflection}} of the world at the time, giving the band a renewed perspective on their lives and society. Many of the song lyrics on the album relate strongly to the theme of urgency. Martin has commented that previous songs were more relaxed since they were in a comfortable state of mind: [...] "Perhaps there's a bit more urgency on some of these songs. And that's born from all the places we've been <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> we've experienced." [...] Martin has explained. In relation to the theme of urgency, Martin has also started that the album's title means [...] "doing something on impulse".|$|E
500|$|After the {{completion}} of filming A League of Their Own, Madonna began working on her fifth studio album Erotica with Shep Pettibone. [...] "Rain" [...] {{was one of the}} first songs developed for the album, alongside [...] "Deeper and Deeper", [...] "Erotica", and [...] "Thief of Hearts", during the writing session in October and November 1991. According to Pettibone, these songs were essentially Madonna's stories <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> she wanted to say. [...] "Rain" [...] was written and produced together by Madonna and Pettibone. She had initially written the song for a musical version to be directed by Alek Keshishian based on the 1939 film, Wuthering Heights. Pettibone also sequenced, programmed, and played keyboards for the song. The recording process was engineered by P. Dennis Mitchell and Robin Hancock, while the mixing was engineered by Goh Hotoda. Another musician involved was Tony Shimkin, who provided the drum programming.|$|E

500|$|Loevs {{script was}} penned by Sudhanshu Saria [...] in the United States, {{when he was}} working on the {{screenplay}} of another film, I Am Here. Describing the film as [...] "small, fragile, honest", Saria said that through his endeavour he [...] "tries to capture the silences <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> unsaid in male friendships". He wrote Loev because he was unable to put together the financing for I Am Here. At the time of the script's inception, Saria had no plan of making it into a feature film, as he believed that no investors or actors would want to be associated with a film that he thought would be censored or banned in its home country. The plot of the film follows many personal experiences that Saria himself went through, growing up in the Indian hill town of Darjeeling, and later at the Ithaca Arts College, New York.|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics have}} taken a more lenient view. Historian and {{television}} presenter Dan Snow described the show's modus operandi as [...] "one step above Blackadder, but that's fine... it plays to stereotypes, but it's fantastic as entry-level history."

500|$|Some People Change was {{the title}} of Montgomery Gentry's fifth album, which was {{released}} in 2006 under the production of Rutherford and Wright. Its title track, co-written by Neil Thrasher, Jason Sellers, and Michael Dulaney, was previously recorded by Kenny Chesney on his 2004 album When the Sun Goes Down. Gentry told the Edmonton Sun that Some People Change [...] "is based more on family issues, {{the love of the}} family, the love of neighbors, relationships", and said that the title track [...] "is about being able to challenge your inner demons <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that can bring people down, alcoholism, or hatred or racism." [...] Montgomery Gentry's version of the song peaked at number 7, followed by the two-week number 1 hit [...] "Lucky Man" [...] and the number 3 [...] "What Do Ya Think About That". In 2008, [...] "Lucky Man" [...] was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, the duo's first Grammy nomination.|$|E

500|$|The most {{important}} advice he gives aspiring songwriters {{is to write}} what you know or what you've experienced. [...] "Use reality as the springboard to whatever you're writing about", Paul said. Paul also says that being a successful songwriter is like being a journalist who writes about what he sees and knows, the times people are living in <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> people are facing today. [...] "The journalist {{looks out the window}} and writes about what is really happening." [...] "I make sure it's real. [...] I don't want to fictionalize about things I haven't witnessed." [...] Paul states that over the years he's learned the value of simplicity in writing. He's learned that he can say more when he writes more simply and direct. [...] "It's almost as if you can be complex and intricate by adopting a shorter, less complicated structure." [...] "I'm not doing rocket science -- I'm a storyteller", he said.

[...] The alternative endings included three varying scenes: in the first, the video ends with a close-up of Lopez's face in the silver lace catsuit; the second ends with a shot of dancers defying gravity on the walls and ceiling, while the final ending ends with a shot of Lopez on the dance floor in her harem pants.

500|$|On March 26, 2002, {{recording}} for Poodle Hat officially {{began at}} Santa Monica Sound Records, in Santa Monica, California. By mid-2002, six originals—"Hardware Store", [...] "Party At The Leper Colony", [...] "Wanna B Ur Lovr", [...] "Why Does This Always Happen To Me?", [...] "Bob", and [...] "Genius In France"—had been recorded. The album's first original song is [...] "Hardware Store", which, {{as the title}} suggests, is about a new neighborhood hardware store <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that can be purchased therein. The song was originally {{supposed to be a}} style parody of another (unspecified) artist, but it eventually evolved into its own, original composition. [...] "Party At The Leper Colony" [...] describes a party at a leper colony. The song makes heavy use of wordplay, using common English idioms to describe events wherein people literally lose body parts (e.g. [...] "Dance all night to a rotten band/Come on, people, let's give 'em a hand"). [...] "Wanna B Ur Lovr", a pastiche of Midnite Vultures-era Beck, consists of pick-up lines which become steadily more ridiculous and suggestive. Because the spelling of the song's title recalls the manner in which Prince titled many of his records, Yankovic specified on his website that the [...] "song is actually intended to sound like me trying to sound like Beck trying to sound like Prince" [...]|$|E
500|$|Casting Crowns' lead vocalist, Mark Hall, {{commented on}} the lyrical content of the song, stating that: [...] "For believers, in context with our other songs, the {{messages}} are that God wants to use you, He wants you to grow and He wants {{you to have a}} purpose". Hall elaborated that: [...] "There are a trilogy of songs and messages that go together on the album. , “Glorious Day,” and “To Know You.” [...] reminds me to be more intentional about what I do. I {{may not be able to}} get on a plane and fly to China and give out Bibles and preach the gospel, but how can I witness to my co-workers and my friends and my family." [...] The portion of the chorus that says [...] "like voices in the wilderness we're crying out" [...] is a reference to John the Baptist; Hall said that one of his favorite characters in the New Testament was John the Baptist, and commented that [...] "he [...] was so black and white. This is wrong, and this is right. And he was speaking into a grey world, saying black and white things, and it cost him his life". He elaborated on that, commenting that: [...] "Until the whole world hears are the lines <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> that John the Baptist said into a culture that did not want to hear it. And we've got to be in a place in our walk with Jesus that he's filled us to where we step into something that's unpopular and we can speak the truth, but that we can also speak it in love. We've got to live in such a way that I have the purpose that John had".|$|E
500|$|Unlike Carey's debut album, which {{featured}} a more contemporary pop and R background, Emotions {{proved to be}} far different. It borrowed from several genres ranging from gospel, R, soul, pop and 1960s and 1970s influences. The album's lead single [...] "Emotions" [...] borrowed heavily from 1970s disco, and flaunted Carey's upper range and extensive use of the whistle register. The song's lyrics were described as [...] "joyful" [...] by author Chris Nickson, and told of a strong and deep emotion felt by the protagonist when with their lover. One of the album's more gospel infused songs, [...] "And You Don't Remember," [...] featured organ chord changes and held minimal production {{in order to give}} the vocals a more [...] "raw and sixties feel." [...] It and the former song were part of a trio of tracks from the album that were meant to pay homage to Motown ballads, with the inclusion of soft church choir vocals, and sole musical arrangement by Carey. Its lyrics reflected the song's raw chorus, telling of girl that is promised the world by her boyfriend, and quickly forget about her and moves to the next one. After the heartbreak, the protagonist asks him [...] "Don't You Remember" [...] all those things he had promised her, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> they had spoken and dreamed about doing together. [...] "Can't Let Go," [...] the album's second single, is a slow ballad, featuring sad and yearning lyrical content. The song's introduction featured minor chord changes, and drew influence from fifties balladry. For the duration {{of the first half of}} the song, Carey sings in her lower and huskier registers, eventually leading to the belted crescendo and falsetto and whistle finish. Of the ten tracks on the album, Carey felt her most autobiographical lyrics were featured on [...] "Make It Happen," [...] which told of Carey's poor and difficult teen life prior to being signed by Columbia. It continues telling of the importance of faith and prayer to God. Nickson described its instrumentation as [...] "restrained" [...] and [...] "very Motownish," [...] as well as noting its soft gospel infusion. Critically, the most anticipated song on the album was Carey's collaboration with King. It was influenced by sixties and seventies gospel and other soulful genres. According to Nickson, the song's instrumentation and basis was crucial to Carey's performance throughout the song. Additionally, he described its content and instrumentation: ...|$|E
