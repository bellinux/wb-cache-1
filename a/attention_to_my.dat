6000|$|... "I {{desire to}} bring to your notice the great {{assistance}} I received from Lieutenant Turnbull, whom I afterwards placed {{in charge of the}} prize, and from Mr. Lippincott.

6000|$|... "Well, I'm {{willing to}} let past matters, drop -- just for the present," [...] he answered, hardly knowing what to say. [...] "I wish <b>to</b> pay all <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> finding <b>my</b> father." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now be careful," [...] he added, when {{about to}} re-cross the bridge. [...] "Your life {{may depend on}} your <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> instructions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, but we {{were both}} angry, and, I think, said more than we meant. I paid very little <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> mother's actual words." ...|$|E

60|$|As {{they talked}} I gave <b>my</b> <b>attention</b> pretty {{exclusively}} <b>to</b> <b>my</b> uncle.|$|R
6000|$|... "The very man," [...] was the reply; [...] "and he was {{the most}} {{formidable}} rival I ever had in that sort of affair. The proper thing for me to do, according to the custom of the times, would have been to take him aside, as soon as I found that he was paying <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> sweetheart, and fight him; but the more I looked at him and his peculiar proportions, the more I was convinced that he was not a man with whom I wanted to fight." ...|$|R
6000|$|I am {{not sure}} whether Frances had accorded due <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> harangue; instead of {{answering}} me with her usual respectful promptitude, she only sighed and said,-- ...|$|E
60|$|My {{uncle was}} too enraged to pay <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> words. He hurled the chair aside and sprang upon me as a wild beast springs upon its prey.|$|E
60|$|In my mind--and modestly--I {{asked for}} particulars, but Satan paid no <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> thought. Next, my mind wandered to the astrologer, and I {{wondered}} {{where he might}} be.|$|E

6000|$|The next day, accordingly, I {{received}} a parcel from Mr. Fairscribe with a newspaper enclosed, among the advertisements of {{which one was}} marked with a cross as requiring <b>my</b> <b>attention.</b> I read, <b>to</b> <b>my</b> surprise:-- ...|$|R

60|$|Hans paid no <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> remark, which {{probably}} he thought only {{worthy of a}} white man who does not understand, but rolled his yellow, bloodshot eyes about, as though in search of explanations.

I then saw him behaving, as it appeared to me, so very improperly and unfeelingly--I may speak of it now because it is all over--so improperly by poor Mr. Rushworth, not seeming to care how he exposed or hurt him, and paying <b>attentions</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> cousin Maria, which--in short, at the time of the play, I received an impression which will never be got over." ...|$|R
