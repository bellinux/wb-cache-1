25|$|Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the No. 3 Democrat in the House, said he {{believed}} the investigation was fueled by officials determined to derail Jackson’s efforts to expand affirmative action. “Is {{there something wrong with}} trying to make sure African-Americans participate in the contracting program with the American government?” <b>asked</b> <b>Mr.</b> Clyburn.|$|E
25|$|Fred {{develops}} a deep debt and finds himself unable {{to repay the}} money. Having <b>asked</b> <b>Mr.</b> Garth, Mary's father, to co-sign the debt, he now tells Garth he must forfeit it. As a result, Mrs. Garth's savings, which represent 4 years worth of income she held in reserve {{for the education of}} her youngest son, and Mary's savings are completely wiped out. Consequently, Mr. Garth warns Mary against ever marrying Fred.|$|E
25|$|On 4 July 1862, in a {{rowing boat}} {{travelling}} on the Isis from Folly Bridge, Oxford, to Godstow {{for a picnic}} outing, 10-year-old Alice asked Charles Dodgson (who wrote under the pen name Lewis Carroll) to entertain her and her sisters, Edith (aged 8) and Lorina (13), with a story. As the Reverend Robinson Duckworth rowed the boat, Dodgson regaled the girls with fantastic stories of a girl, named Alice, and her adventures after she fell into a rabbit-hole. The story was not unlike those Dodgson had spun for the sisters before, but this time Liddell <b>asked</b> <b>Mr.</b> Dodgson {{to write it down}} for her. He promised to do so but did not get around to the task for some months. He eventually presented her with the manuscript of Alice's Adventures Under Ground in November 1864.|$|E

Note that I don't <b>ask</b> <b>Mr.</b> Razumov whether he has {{justified}} his absence to his guest. No doubt he did this sufficiently. But I don't <b>ask.</b> <b>Mr.</b> Razumov inspires confidence. It is a great gift. I only suggest that a more prolonged absence might awaken the criminal's suspicions and induce him perhaps to change his plans." ...|$|R

2500|$|Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar came to {{my office}} the other day to recount his country's {{remarkable}} transformation. He described a nation {{of people who are}} harder-working, more virtuous – yes, more virtuous, because the market punishes immorality – and more hopeful about the future than they've ever been in their history. I <b>asked</b> <b>Mr.</b> Laar where his government got the idea for these reforms. Do you know what he replied? He said, [...] "We read Milton Friedman and F. A. Hayek." ...|$|E
2500|$|Media {{reports said}} that no {{evidence}} of sedition had been produced against the accused by the Chhattisgarh Government. According to The Hindu, {{one of the two}} judges told the senior state counsel [...] ""We are a democratic country. He may be a sympathiser. That does not make him guilty of sedition." [...] Drawing an analogy, he <b>asked</b> <b>Mr.</b> Lalit: “if Mahatma Gandhi's autobiography is found in somebody's place, is he a Gandhian? No case of sedition is made out on the basis of materials in possession unless you show that he was actively helping or harbouring them [...]"" ...|$|E

2500|$|After the {{compulsory}} retirement of Rev. Jones later in 1815, Boys {{was chosen to}} succeed him, also inheriting his responsibilities as Master of the Upper School on the island. The promotion did little {{to rein in the}} chaplain's strident nature as further council records attest. On 30 March 1817 the Council <b>asked</b> <b>Mr</b> Boys for an explanation of his conduct in refusing to take into the church a coffin for burial. He countered by claiming that the funeral attendees were pagans who were disrespecting the church. In 1821 the minutes recall an incident when the Reverend publicly accused a shopkeeper of being a liar and a spy, calling after him in the street: [...] "Blenkens, when is the green bag to be given out?" [...] ("green bag" [...] at the time being a term describing a bag containing the fabricated evidence of paid informers).|$|E
