5|$|<b>As</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> pattern, Hosseini drew on {{his early}} {{experiences}} in Afghanistan {{to create the}} foundation of the book. He states that his travels to Afghanistan later in life also influenced his writing, albeit involuntarily. For example, during a 2009 visit he met two young sisters in a remote village outside Kabul. The older one, who he estimated to be around six years old, acted as a mother figure to the younger girl. Hosseini stated that their bond formed {{the foundation of the}} relationship between Abdullah and Pari in the novel.|$|E
5|$|His curveball, like Madison Bumgarner, has two speeds with {{different}} types of movement, though he throws his slow curveball much more frequently than does Bumgarner, and will sometimes throw a curve that is more in the middle range combining the types of movement. His two-seamer is his most-used pitch against right-handed hitters and is used more frequently than against lefties, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> slider. His changeup is only thrown to left-handed hitters. Greinke's curveball is typically used early in the count, while his slider is his most common 2-strike pitch.|$|E

5|$|His {{observations}} on catfish, electric fish (Torpedo) and angler fish are detailed, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> writing on cephalopods including the octopus, cuttlefish {{and the paper}} nautilus. His claim that the octopus had a hectocotyl arm which was perhaps used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved, until its rediscovery in the 19th century. He separated the aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that sharks and rays {{were part of the}} group he called Selachē (roughly, the modern zoologist's selachians).|$|E
5|$|Nystrom {{was born}} and raised in Syosset, New York, where his father, Bob, was an NHL player for the New York Islanders. Bob, who was himself born in Sweden but grew up in Hinton, Alberta, won four {{consecutive}} Stanley Cups between 1980 and 1983. Bob coached his son during his formative years in hockey. Nystrom is Jewish <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> mother. He attended high school at Portledge School in Locust Valley, New York. He has an older sister, Marissa.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the primary}} sources, i.e., those {{composed}} by the Jesuits themselves {{during the years}} 1691 through 1767, {{those that have been}} extensively researched (many as yet have not been thoroughly examined) are few. The most useful is the monumental Historia general de la Compañía de Jesús en la Provincia del Perú: Crónica anómina de 1600 que trata del establecimiento y misiones de la Compañía de Jesús en los países de habla española en la América meridional, vol. II, edited by Francisco Mateos (Madrid: Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas, 1944). Also of importance is the unedited archive of correspondence from the Jesuits of Paraguay from the years 1690-1718. Collectively known as “Cartas a los Provinciales de la Provincia del Paraguay 1690-1718,” these manuscripts are housed in the Jesuit Archives of Argentina in Buenos Aires, which also contain the invaluable annals of the Paraguay Province of the Company of Jesus, covering the years 1689-1762. The German edition of Fr. Julián Knogler’s Inhalt einer Beschreibung der Missionen deren Chiquiten, Archivum Historicum Societatis Jesu, 39/78 (Rome: Company of Jesus, 1970) is indispensable, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> account Relato sobre el país y la nación de los Chiquitos en las Indias Occidentales o América del Sud y en la misiones en su territorio, for a condensed version of which, see Werner Hoffman, Las misiones jesuíticas entre los chiquitanos (Buenos Aires: Fundación para la Educación, la Ciencia y la Cultura, 1979). Fr. Juan de Montenegro’s Breve noticia de las missiones, peregrinaciones apostólicas, trabajos, sudor, y sangre vertida, en obsequio de la fe, de el venerable padre Augustín Castañares, de la Compañía de Jesús, insigne missionero de la provincia del Paraguay, en las missiones de Chiquitos, Zamucos, y ultimamente en la missión de los infieles Mataguayos, (Madrid: Manuel Fernández, Impresor del Supremo Consejo de la Inquisición, de la Reverenda Cámara Apostólica, y del Convento de las Señoras de la Encarnación, en la Caba Baxa, 1746) and Fr. Juan Patricio Fernández’s Relación historial de las misiones de los indios, que llaman chiquitos, que están a cargo de los padres de la Compañía de Jesús de la provincia del Paraguay (Madrid: Manuel Fernández, Impresor de Libros, 1726) are also valuable. There are other primary sources as yet unexamined, the majority of which are archived in Cochabamba, Sucre, and Tarija (in Bolivia); Buenos Aires, Córdoba, and Tucumán (in Argentina); Asunción (Paraguay); Madrid; and Rome.|$|E

25|$|Machen's {{influence}} {{is not limited}} to genre fiction, however. Jorge Luis Borges recognized Machen as a great writer, and through him Machen has had an influence on magic realism. He was also a major influence on Paul Bowles and Javier Marías. He {{was one of the most}} significant figures in the life of the Poet Laureate Sir John Betjeman, who attributed to Machen his conversion to High Church Anglicanism, an important part of his philosophy and poetry. Sylvia Townsend Warner (a niece of Machen's second wife, Purefoy) admired Machen and was influenced by him, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> great-granddaughter, the contemporary artist Tessa Farmer.|$|E
25|$|Among rabbis of his generation, Heller was {{exceptionally}} {{well versed in}} the secular sciences. His Talmudic works and his sermons {{show that he was}} interested in questions of arithmetic, astronomy, and natural science. His notes on the Giv'at ha Moreh of Joseph ben Isaac ha-Levi prove that he occupied himself with philosophy. He praised the Me'or 'Enayim of Azariah dei Rossi in spite of the anathema that his master, Judah ben Bezalel, whom he held in great esteem, had launched against the book and its author. His statement on the universal dignity of humanity is also notable, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> openness to study of works by non-Jews. One of his sermons alludes to the “new astronomy” of Copernicus and Tycho Brahe.|$|E

25|$|Milk {{begins on}} Harvey Milk's 40th {{birthday}} (in 1970), {{when he was}} living in New York City and had not yet settled in San Francisco. It chronicles his foray into city politics, and the various battles he waged in the Castro neighborhood as well as throughout the city, and political campaigns to limit the rights of gay people in 1977 and 1978 run by Anita Bryant and John Briggs. His romantic and political relationships are also addressed, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> tenuous affiliation with troubled Supervisor Dan White; the film ends with White's double homicide of Milk and Mayor George Moscone. The film's release was tied to the 2008 California voter referendum on gay marriage, Proposition 8, when it made its premiere at the Castro Theatre two weeks before election day.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle is the {{earliest}} natural historian whose work has survived in some detail. Aristotle certainly did {{research on the}} natural history of Lesbos, and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas. The works that reflect this research, the History of Animals, Generation of Animals, Movement of Animals, and Parts of Animals, contain some observations and interpretations, along with sundry myths and mistakes. The most striking passages are about the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen. His observations on catfish, electric fish (Torpedo) and angler-fish are detailed, <b>as</b> <b>is</b> <b>his</b> writing on cephalopods, namely, Octopus, Sepia (cuttlefish) and the paper nautilus (Argonauta argo). His description of the hectocotyl arm, used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the 19th century. He separated the aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called Selachē (Greek for 'sharks').|$|E
