50|$|Rose {{perfumes}} {{are made}} from rose oil (also called attar of roses), which {{is a mixture of}} volatile essential oils obtained by steam distilling the crushed petals of roses. An <b>associated</b> <b>product</b> is rose water which is used for cooking, cosmetics, medicine and religious practices. The production technique originated in Persia and then spread through Arabia and India, and more recently into eastern Europe. In Bulgaria, Iran and Germany, damask roses (Rosa × damascena 'Trigintipetala') are used. In {{other parts of the world}} Rosa × centifolia is commonly used. The oil is transparent pale yellow or yellow-grey in colour. 'Rose Absolute' is solvent-extracted with hexane and produces a darker oil, dark yellow to orange in colour. The weight of oil extracted is about one three-thousandth to one six-thousandth of the weight of the flowers; for example, about two thousand flowers are required to produce one gram of oil.|$|E
50|$|In this pathway, G-coupled protein receptors and {{tyrosine}} kinase receptors are activated, {{resulting in the}} activation of phospholipase C (PLC). PLC hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2), resulting in a membrane <b>associated</b> <b>product,</b> diacylglycerol (DAG), and a water-soluble product, inositol triphosphate (IP3). DAG acts as a second messenger, activating several protein kinases and produces extended downstream signaling. IP3 is also a second messenger which activates receptors on the endoplasmic reticulum to release calcium ion stores into the cytoplasm, creating a complex signaling system that can be involved in modulating fertilization, proliferation, contraction, cell metabolism, vesicle and fluid secretion, and information processing in neuronal cells. Overall, DAG and IP3 signaling has implications for neuronal plasticity, impacting hippocampal long term potentiation, stress-induced cognitive impairment, and neuronal growth cone spreading. Furthermore, not only is PIP2 a precursor to several signaling molecules, it can be phosphorylated at the 3’ position to become PIP3, which is involved in cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell movement.|$|E
