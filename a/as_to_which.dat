50|$|The {{terminology}} Osborne {{uses for}} the grammatical categories, in particular the aspects and voices, does not conform to more recent cross-linguistic standards (see terms for various aspects). For instance, Osborne glosses verbs containing the beginning aspect <b>as</b> started <b>to,</b> <b>which</b> closer aligns <b>to</b> {{what is now called}} the inceptive or inchoative, while the aspect that Osborne calls inceptive is glossed <b>as</b> about <b>to,</b> <b>which</b> is more reminiscent of the prospective.|$|R

They are prohibited from communicating information obtained during the counting of votes <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> candidate has been voted for in any particular ballot paper.

5|$|As a freshman, he {{was given}} a redshirt year so he did not play during the team's 2005 {{national}} championship season. He served as the quarterback for the scout team in practice against the starting defense. During this time, Matt McCoy (no relation) was officially listed as the number three quarterback behind Vince Young and Matt Nordgren. When Brown chose to play Matt McCoy in four separate game situations where Texas had a commanding lead, confusion arose <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> McCoy was in the game. Many sportscasters mistakenly referred to Matt McCoy as Colt McCoy, as Colt was the more widely known player. The following year, with Young forgoing his senior year to enter the NFL and Nordgren graduating, the position of starting quarterback for the defending National Champion Texas Longhorns came down to a competition between redshirt freshman Colt McCoy and true freshman newcomer Jevan Snead.|$|E
5|$|As in {{the first}} study, the second one also {{included}} a task relating to disliking letters. Subjects were asked to select the six letters they liked the least. As before, merely having a letter in one's own name significantly reduced the chances of disliking it. This task revealed an asymmetry in the letter preference hierarchy. While {{there was a large}} consensus within each of the 12 languages <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> letters were least preferred, there was not much consensus at all around the most preferred letters.|$|E
5|$|During Taiwan under Japanese rule (1895–1945), {{the use of}} Pe̍h-ōe-jī was {{suppressed}} and it faced further countermeasures {{during the}} Kuomintang martial law period (1947–1987). In Fujian, use declined after {{the establishment of the}} People's Republic of China (1949) and in the early 21st century the system was not in general use there. Taiwanese Christians, non-native learners of Southern Min, and native-speaker enthusiasts in Taiwan are among those that continue to use Pe̍h-ōe-jī. Full native computer support was developed in 2004, and users can now call on fonts, input methods, and extensive online dictionaries. Rival writing systems have evolved, and there is ongoing debate within the Taiwanese mother tongue movement <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> system should be used. Versions of pe̍h-ōe-jī have been devised for other Chinese varieties, including Hakka and Teochew Southern Min.|$|E

5|$|Following his {{military}} service, Jose Sarria returned to San Francisco. He enrolled in college with plans {{of becoming a}} teacher.

Sarria and Teresa both became smitten with a waiter named Jimmy Moore and bet <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> of them could get him into bed first. José won the bet and soon Moore and he were lovers. Sarria began covering for Moore when {{he was unable to}} work and soon Black Cat owner Sol Stoumen hired him as a cocktail waiter.|$|E
5|$|If a {{cerebral}} aneurysm is identified on angiography, two measures {{are available to}} reduce the risk of further bleeding from the same aneurysm: clipping and coiling. Clipping requires a craniotomy (opening of the skull) to locate the aneurysm, followed by the placement of clips around the neck of the aneurysm. Coiling is performed through the large blood vessels (endovascularly): a catheter is inserted into the femoral artery in the groin and advanced through the aorta to the arteries (both carotid arteries and both vertebral arteries) that supply the brain. When the aneurysm has been located, platinum coils are deployed that cause a blood clot to form in the aneurysm, obliterating it. The decision <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> treatment is undertaken is typically made by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a neurosurgeon, neuroradiologist, and often other health professionals.|$|E
5|$|In April 1992, ITV offered Parry an {{improved}} bid of £34 million per year, which bettered the BBC's joint-bid with BSkyB. East was confident of closing the deal – he {{was supported by}} 11 club chairmen and was informed that ITV's rivals {{would have to come}} up with £100 million a year to better their offer. Parry was undecided <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> bid he preferred; though he favoured a non-exclusive deal with ITV, he wanted the reconsider its decision to work with subscription companies. He harboured the idea of a football channel and noted SBC's approval amongst other clubs. Parry also hoped BSkyB would increase their bid, which they later did.|$|E

5|$|In captive Egyptian fruit bats, 70% of the {{directed}} calls {{could be}} identified <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> bat made it, and 60% could be categorised into four contexts: squabbling over food, jostling over position in their sleeping cluster, protesting over mating attempts and arguing when perched {{in close proximity to}} each other. The animals made slightly different sounds when communicating with different individuals, especially one of the opposite sex. Male hammerheaded bats produce deep, resonating, monotonous calls to attract females. Bats in flight make vocal signal for traffic control. Individual greater bulldog bats honk when {{on a collision course with}} each other.|$|E
5|$|In general, insulin {{is given}} at 0.1unit/kg per hour {{to reduce the}} blood sugars and {{suppress}} ketone production. Guidelines differ <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> dose to use when blood sugar levels start falling; some recommend reducing the dose of insulin once glucose falls below 16.6mmol/l (300mg/dl) but other recommend infusing glucose in addition to saline to allow for ongoing infusion of higher doses of insulin.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, {{there were four}} notable Christian heavy metal groups: Messiah Prophet, Leviticus, Saint, and Stryper. Although it is {{debatable}} <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> band was formed first, the Orange County native glam metal group Stryper {{was the most popular}} one. Stryper was also the first band to identify as Christian metal. Stryper gained attention with their way of throwing Bibles to the audience at their concerts. In the beginning, mostly Christians went to Stryper's concerts but soon they reached non-Christian audience. In the 1980s, Christian metal bands closely followed the trends of mainstream metal bands.|$|E
