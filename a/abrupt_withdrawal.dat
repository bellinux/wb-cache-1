5|$|The most {{frequent}} symptoms of withdrawal from benzodiazepines are insomnia, gastric problems, tremors, agitation, fearfulness, and muscle spasms. The less frequent effects are irritability, sweating, depersonalization, derealization, hypersensitivity to stimuli, depression, suicidal behavior, psychosis, seizures, and delirium tremens. Severe symptoms usually {{occur as a}} result of abrupt or over-rapid withdrawal. <b>Abrupt</b> <b>withdrawal</b> can be dangerous, therefore a gradual reduction regimen is recommended.|$|E
5|$|Those {{taking more}} than 4mg per day have an {{increased}} potential for dependence. This medication may cause withdrawal symptoms upon <b>abrupt</b> <b>withdrawal</b> or rapid tapering, which in some cases {{have been known to}} cause seizures, as well as marked delirium similar to that produced by the anticholinergic tropane alkaloids of Datura (scopolamine and atropine). The discontinuation of this medication may also cause a reaction called rebound anxiety.|$|E

5|$|Psoriasis vulgaris (also {{known as}} chronic {{stationary}} psoriasis or plaque-like psoriasis) {{is the most}} common form and affects 85%–90% of people with psoriasis. Plaque psoriasis typically appears as raised areas of inflamed skin covered with silvery-white scaly skin. These areas are called plaques and are most commonly found on the elbows, knees, scalp, and back. Psoriatic erythroderma (erythrodermic psoriasis) involves widespread inflammation and exfoliation of the skin over most of the body surface. It may be accompanied by severe itching, swelling, and pain. It is often the result of an exacerbation of unstable plaque psoriasis, particularly following the <b>abrupt</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of systemic glucocorticoids. This form of psoriasis can be fatal as the extreme inflammation and exfoliation disrupt the body's ability to regulate temperature and perform barrier functions.|$|E
25|$|The {{committee}} {{recommended that}} withdrawal from benzodiazepines be gradual, as <b>abrupt</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from {{high doses of}} benzodiazepines may cause confusion, toxic psychosis, convulsions, or a condition resembling delirium tremens. <b>Abrupt</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from lower doses may cause depression, nervousness, rebound insomnia, irritability, sweating, and diarrhea.|$|E

25|$|Discontinuing benzodiazepines or {{antidepressants}} abruptly due {{to concerns}} of teratogenic {{effects of the}} medications has {{a high risk of}} causing serious complications, so is not recommended. For example, <b>abrupt</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of benzodiazepines or antidepressants has a high risk of causing extreme withdrawal symptoms, including suicidal ideation and a severe rebound effect of the return of the underlying disorder if present. This can lead to hospitalisation and potentially, suicide. One study reported one-third of mothers who suddenly discontinued or very rapidly tapered their medications became acutely suicidal due to 'unbearable symptoms'. One woman had a medical abortion, as she felt she could no longer cope, and another woman used alcohol in a bid to combat the withdrawal symptoms from benzodiazepines.

25|$|Benzodiazepine {{dependence}} is {{the condition}} resulting from repeated use of benzodiazepine drugs.

40|$|Predictors for {{operative}} mortality (OM) {{were studied}} in 172 consecutive patients (pts) undergoing coronary artery grafts (CAG) for angina pectoris. Seventy eight pts had Class IV angina; of the 147 patients given propranolol, 41 were gradually withdrawn from propranolol and finally discontinued 24 hours before surgery, and 106 were abruptly withdrawn from propranolol 24 hours before CAG; 20 pts had left main coronary disease; 156 pts had cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time shorter than 20 minutes, and 16 pts had a CPB longer than 120 minutes. The operative mortality was 5. 2 % (9 / 172) {{for the entire}} group. Class IV angina (OM 7 %), <b>abrupt</b> propranolol <b>withdrawal</b> (OM 6. 6 %), left main coronary artery disease (OM 25 %), and CPB longer than 120 minutes (OM 50 %o), all significantly increased OM. These variables were interdependent, however, as many pts belonged to several predictor categories, combinations of predictors were examined, in order to more accurately predict the risk of individual pts. The combination of left main coronary artery disease and CPB longer than 120 minutes; and Class IV angina and CPB longer than 120 minutes {{were significantly associated with}} higher operative mortality. We conclude that Class IV angina, <b>abrupt</b> propranolol <b>withdrawal,</b> left main coronary artery disease and prolonged CPB are potent, interdependent predictors of OM in pts undergoing CAG. Consideration of these predictors, alone and in combination, allows effective prediction of OM for CAG in patients with stable angina pectoris...|$|R

25|$|<b>Abrupt</b> or over-rapid <b>withdrawal</b> from {{clonazepam}} {{may result}} {{in the development of}} the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, causing psychosis characterised by dysphoric manifestations, irritability, aggressiveness, anxiety, and hallucinations. Sudden withdrawal may also induce the potentially life-threatening condition, status epilepticus. Anti-epileptic drugs, benzodiazepines such as clonazepam in particular, should be reduced in dose slowly and gradually when discontinuing the drug to mitigate withdrawal effects. Carbamazepine has been tested in the treatment of clonazepam withdrawal but was found to be ineffective in preventing clonazepam withdrawal-induced status epilepticus from occurring.|$|R
25|$|Withdrawal {{symptoms}} {{may occur}} during gradual or particularly <b>abrupt</b> <b>withdrawal</b> of tricyclic antidepressant drugs. Possible symptoms include: nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, insomnia, headache, nervousness, anxiety, dizziness and worsening of psychiatric status. Differentiating between {{the return of}} the original psychiatric disorder and clomipramine withdrawal symptoms is important. Clomipramine withdrawal can be severe. Withdrawal symptoms can also occur in neonates when clomipramine is used during pregnancy. A major mechanism of withdrawal from tricyclic antidepressants is believed to be due to a rebound effect of excessive cholinergic activity due to neuroadaptations as a result of chronic inhibition of cholinergic receptors by tricyclic antidepressants. Restarting the antidepressant and slow tapering is the treatment of choice for tricyclic antidepressant withdrawal. Some withdrawal symptoms may respond to anticholinergics, such as atropine or benztropine mesylate.|$|E
25|$|Temazepam, {{like other}} {{benzodiazepine}} drugs, can cause physical dependence and addiction. Withdrawal from temazepam or other benzodiazepines after regular use {{often leads to}} a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, which resembles symptoms during alcohol and barbiturate withdrawal. The higher the dose and the longer the drug is taken, the greater the risk of experiencing unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms can also occur from standard dosages and after short-term use. <b>Abrupt</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from therapeutic doses of temazepam after long-term use {{may result in a}} severe benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Gradual and careful reduction of the dosage, preferably with a long-acting benzodiazepine with long half-life active metabolites, such as chlordiazepoxide or diazepam, are recommended to prevent severe withdrawal syndromes from developing. Other hypnotic benzodiazepines are not recommended. A study in rats found temazepam is cross tolerant with barbiturates and is able to effectively substitute for barbiturates and suppress barbiturate withdrawal signs.|$|E
25|$|Neuroactive steroids, e.g., {{progesterone}} and its active metabolite allopregnanolone, {{are positive}} modulators of the GABAA receptor and are cross tolerant with benzodiazepines. The active metabolite of progesterone {{has been found}} to enhance the binding of benzodiazepines to the benzodiazepine binding sites on the GABAA receptor. The cross-tolerance between GABAA receptor positive modulators occurs because of the similar mechanism of action and the subunit changes that occur from chronic use from {{one or more of these}} compounds in expressed receptor isoforms. <b>Abrupt</b> <b>withdrawal</b> from any of these compounds, e.g., barbiturates, benzodiazepines, alcohol, corticosteroids, neuroactive steroids, and nonbenzodiazepines, precipitate similar withdrawal effects characterized by central nervous system hyper-excitability, resulting in symptoms such as increased seizure susceptibility and anxiety. While many of the neuroactive steroids do not produce full tolerance to their therapeutic effects, cross-tolerance to benzodiazepines still occurs as had been demonstrated between the neuroactive steroid ganaxolone and diazepam. Alterations of levels of neuroactive steroids in the body during the menstrual cycle, menopause, pregnancy, and stressful circumstances can lead to a reduction in the effectiveness of benzodiazepines and a reduced therapeutic effect. During withdrawal of neuroactive steroids, benzodiazepines become less effective.|$|E
5000|$|A {{wide range}} of drugs whilst not causing a true {{physical}} dependence can still cause withdrawal symptoms or rebound effects during dosage reduction or especially <b>abrupt</b> or rapid <b>withdrawal.</b> These can include caffeine, stimulants, steroidal drugs and antiparkinsonian drugs. It is debated if the entire antipsychotic drug class causes true physical dependency, if only a subset does, or if none do, but all, if discontinued too rapidly, cause an acute withdrawal syndrome. [...] When talking about illicit drugs rebound withdrawal is, especially with stimulants, {{sometimes referred to as}} [...] "coming down" [...] or [...] "crashing".|$|R
40|$|To {{examine a}} {{possible}} role for gonadal steroid hormones in the enhanced accumulation of hypothalamic oxytocin (OT) messenger RNA (mRNA) and peptide in late pregnancy, we used an established model (22) in which sequential administration of estradiol (E 2) and progesterone (P) SILASTIC capsules to ovariectomized rats {{is followed by}} removal of P. Long term and sustained E 2 combined with <b>abrupt</b> P <b>withdrawal</b> mimics the gonadal steroid hormone pattern of late gestation in the rat (22). Using this paradigm, we demonstrate that OT mRNA is increased in the rat hypothalamus after long term P treatment, {{but only in the}} presence of E 2 and only when P capsules are removed 48 h before killing. Furthermore, we show that P replacement in primiparous rats during late pregnancy blunts the increase in OT mRNA normally observed at the end of gestation. Our results support a role for E 2 priming and P withdrawal in the enhanced accumulation of OT mRNA in the hypothalamus of the female rat...|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{potentiation}} (LTP) in nociceptive spinal pathways shares several features with hyperalgesia and {{has been}} proposed to be a cellular mechanism of pain amplification in acute and chronic pain states. Spinal LTP is typically induced by noxious input and has therefore been hypothesized to contribute to acute postoperative pain and to forms of chronic pain that develop from an initial painful event, peripheral inflammation or neuropathy. Under this assumption, preventing LTP induction may help to prevent the development of exaggerated postoperative pain and reversing established LTP may help to treat patients who have an LTP component to their chronic pain. Spinal LTP is also induced by <b>abrupt</b> opioid <b>withdrawal,</b> making it a possible mechanism of some forms of opioid-induced hyperalgesia. Here, we give an overview of targets for preventing LTP induction and modifying established LTP as identified in animal studies.

We {{investigated}} whether IH mitigates brain oxidative stress and behavioral deficits in rats subjected to ethanol intoxication and <b>abrupt</b> ethanol <b>withdrawal</b> (EW). The effects of IH on overt EW behavioral signs, superoxide generation, protein oxidation, and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) opening were examined. Methods: Male rats consumed dextrin or 6. 5 % (w/v) ethanol for 35 days. During the last 20 days, rats were treated with repetitive (5 - 8 /day), brief (5 - 10 min) cycles of hypoxia (9. 5 - 10 % inspired O 2) separated by 4 min normoxia exposures. Cerebellum, cortex and hippocampus were biopsied on day 35 of the diet or at 24 hours of EW. Superoxide and protein carbonyl contents in tissue homogenates and absorbance decline at 540 nm in mitochondrial suspensions served as indicators of oxidative stress, protein oxidation and PTP opening, respectively. Results: Although IH altered neither ethanol consumption nor blood ethanol concentration, it sharply lowered the severity of EW signs including tremor, tail rigidity, and startle response.

50|$|MOH {{is common}} {{and can be}} treated. The {{overused}} medications must be stopped for the patient's headache to resolve. Clinical data shows that the treatment of election is <b>abrupt</b> drugs <b>withdrawal,</b> followed by starting prophylactic therapy. However, the discontinuation of overused drugs usually leads to the worsening of headache {{and the appearance of}} drug withdrawal symptoms (that greatly depend on the previously overused drugs and typically last from two to ten days and that are relieved by the further intake of the overused medication), which might reinforce the continuation of overuse. Where physical dependence or a rebound effect such as rebound headache is possible, gradual reduction of medication may be necessary. It is important that the patient's physician be consulted before abruptly discontinuing certain medications as such a course of action has the potential to induce medically significant physical withdrawal symptoms. Abruptly discontinuing butalbital, for example, can actually induce seizures in some patients, although simple over the counter analgesics can safely be stopped by the patient without medical supervision. A long-acting analgesic/anti-inflammatory, such as naproxen (500 mg twice a day), can be used to ease headache during the withdrawal period. Two months after the completion of a medication withdrawal, patients suffering from MOH typically notice a marked reduction in headache frequency and intensity.|$|R
