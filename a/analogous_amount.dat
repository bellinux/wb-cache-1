40|$|We {{exploit the}} {{regional}} variation in negative attitudes towards immigrants to Sweden {{in order to}} analyse {{what are the consequences}} of such attitudes have on immigrants welfare. A well educated immigrant from a non developed country who lives in a municipality with strong negative attitudes earns less than what she would earn if she lived in a municipality where natives are more positive. If attitudes changed from the average level to the most positive level, her wage would increase by 12 %. This would reduce the wage gap to well-educated immigrants from developed countries by 70 %. We interpret this eect as evidence of labour market discrimination. The same reduction in negative attitudes would increase the welfare of immigrants from Africa and Asia, through their wage and local amenities, by an equivalent to one third of their wage. The <b>analogous</b> <b>amount</b> for immigrants from South America and Eastern Europe is one fourth of their wage if they are well educated and one tenth otherwise. na...|$|E
40|$|Schedules of {{intermittent}} brain-stimulation reinforcement {{have been}} shown to maintain performances when a reinforcement is defined as several response-produced, brief trains of stimulation. The present experiments show that the number of response-produced trains permitted per reinforcement is a variable <b>analogous</b> to <b>amount</b> or magnitude of reinforcement in the conventional food-reinforcement experiment. Systematic effects were obtained when that variable was manipulated within a multiple schedule and also on variable-interval schedules programmed concurrently...|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} lipophilic extracts of the ripe pulp of mangoes from twelve cultivars of Mangifera indica L from Madeira Island was investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for the first time. The ripe pulp of these mango cultivars showed <b>analogous</b> <b>amounts</b> of lipophilic extractives, as well as similar qualitative {{chemical composition}}s. The predominant compounds were free and glycosylated sterols and fatty acids, representing 44. 8 - 70. 7 % and 22. 6 - 41. 9 %, respectively, of {{the total amount of}} lipophilic components. Smaller amounts of long chain aliphatic alcohols and alpha-tocopherol were also identified. These data indicate that the investigated mango cultivars are a rich source of valuable phytochemicals, contributing to the intake of at least 9. 5 - 38. 2 mg of phytosterols (free and glycosylated) and 0. 7 - 3. 9 mg of fatty adds (omega- 3 and omega- 6) per 100 g of fresh mango, with recognizable beneficial effects on human nutrition and health.

5000|$|Navigating {{the world}} on the basis of sensory {{stimulation}} alone represents an inverse problem in the realm of biology. Consider, for example, the case of the distance and line length. When light reflected from a linear object falls on the retina, the object in 3-D space is transformed into a two-dimensional line. Note, however, that a distant line can form the same image on the retina as a shorter but close line. All the eyes receive is an image, which is analogous to the bucket of water. It is impossible to go backward to know the real distance, length, and orientation of the source of the projected line, <b>analogous</b> to the <b>amounts</b> of water that came from each hose. Despite this fact, percipients usually manage to behave effectively in response to sensory stimulation.|$|R
40|$|Chimeric kinesin 1 (KHC) / kinesin 5 (Eg 5) {{constructs}} {{were used}} to study the force generation mechanism of the motor protein. The kinesin family of proteins walk along microtubules to carry cargo or pull microtubules along each other and do so by hydrolyzing a single ATP per 8 nm step. The mechanism that is employed by kinesin to generate the force necessary for motion is not completely understood. One recent model, the cover neck bundle (CNB) model, utilizes two structural elements of the motor (the coverstrand, {{which is at the}} N-terminus of the motorhead) and [beta] 9, {{which is part of the}} necklinker (C-terminus of the motorhead) to form a beta sheet. The CNB folds toward the motor head and causes the rear, unbound head to travel from behind to in front of the bound motorhead. Recent investigations have shown that the CNB produces enough force to explain single molecule experiments, and that when the CNB is not allowed to form by deletion of the coverstrand, the motor looses the ability to generate force. Recent experiments on dimeric forms of Eg 5 (a member of the kinesin 5 family) have shown that the motor is capable of generating nearly <b>analogous</b> <b>amounts</b> of force as kinesin 1, but that it generally dissociates from the microtubule under load rather than coming to a true stall. To investigate the applicability of the CNB model of force generation and to see if a motor with high force capabilities could be generated, these chimeras employed the Eg 5 CNB (and in some cases L 13), and the rest of the kinesin 1 motorhead. It was found from experiments with a stationary optical trap to measure stall force and the force-velocity relationship of the motors as well as unloaded measurements, such as processivity and velocity, that motors with a matched CNB operated the best, however the use of the Eg 5 CNB did not reproduce the force generation capabilities of dimeric Eg 5 constructs. These results suggest that perhaps while the CNB mechanism is very important to force generation, it may not be the full explanation. A possible link between the CNB's effect on the rate of the mechanical step of the mechanochemical cycle and the stall force is discussed. This link between mechanical rate and stall force is a potential avenue for rational design of kinesin motors for a specific stall force. Secondly, these results show that the parts of kinesin are not directly interchangeable, and that careful consideration of the interactions between parts must be considered when engineering these motors. A second set of experiments were designed to explore whether the CNB mechanism could be exploited for a rational purpose. The literature consists of many reports of various methods to target kinesin and stop its motility for therapeutic reason. For example, some chemotherapies target kinesin to treat cancer. In this way, an antibody was designed to bind specifically with the coverstrand, thus hopefully disrupting the CNB formation and mechanism of force generation. These experiments demonstrated the the antibody was successful in targeting the coverstrand and in inhibiting kinesin's motion. by William R. Hesse. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|In the {{assignment}} game of Shapley and Shubik [Shapley, L. S., Shubik, M., 1972. The assignment game. I. The core, International journal of Game Theory 1, 11 - 130] agents {{are allowed to}} form one partnership at most. That paper proves that, {{in the context of}} firms and workers, given two stable payoffs for the firms there is a stable payoff which gives each firm the larger of the two amounts and also one which gives each of them the smaller <b>amount.</b> <b>Analogous</b> result applies to the workers. Sotomayor [Sotomayor, M., 1992. The multiple partners game. In: Majumdar, M. (Ed.), Dynamics and Equilibrium: Essays in Honor to D. Gale. Mcmillian, pp. 322 - 336] extends this analysis to the case where both types of agents may form more than one partnership and an agent`s payoff is multi-dimensional. Instead, this note concentrates in the total payoff of the agents. It is then proved the rather unexpected result that again the maximum of any pair of stable payoffs for the firms is stable but the minimum need not be, even if we restrict the multiplicity of partnerships to one of the sides.

40|$|Photonic {{crystals}} (PhCs) are periodic dielectric {{structures that}} exhibit a photonic band gap; {{a range of}} wavelengths for which light propagation is forbidden. 2 D PhCs exhibit most of the properties as their three dimension counterparts with a compatibility with standard semiconductor processing techniques such as epitaxial growth, electron beam lithography, Plasma deposition/etching and electromechanical lapping/polishing. Indium Phosphide (InP) is the material of choice for photonic devices {{especially when it comes}} to realization of coherent light source at 1. 55 μm wavelength. Precise engineering of the nanostructures in the PhC lattice offers novel ways to confine, guide and control light in phonic integrated circuits (PICs). Strong confinement of light in PhCs offer novel opportunities in many areas of physics and engineering. Dry etching, a necessary process step in PhC device manufacturing, is known to introduce damage in the etched material. Process induced damage and its impact on the electrical and optical properties of PhCs depends on the etched material, the etching technique and process parameters. We have demonstrated a novel post-etch process based on so-called mass-transport (MT) technology for the first time on InP-based PhCs that has significantly improved side-wall verticality of etched PhC holes. A statistical analysis performed on several devices fabricated by MT process technology shows a great deal of improvement in the reliability of optical transmission characteristics which is very promising for achieving high optical quality in PhC components. Several PhC devices were manufactured using MT technology. Broad enough PhC waveguides that operate in the mono/multi-mode regime are interesting for coarse wavelength de-multiplexing. The fundamental mode and higher order mode interaction creates mini-stop band (MSB) in the dispersion diagram where the higher order mode has a lower group velocity which can be considered as slow light regime. In this thesis work, the phenomena of MSBs and its impact on transmission properties have been evaluated. We have proposed and demonstrated a method that enables spectral tuning with sub-nanometer accuracy which is based on the transmission MSB. Along the same lines most of the thesis work relates to broad enough PhC guides that operated in the multimode regime. Temperature tuning experiments on these waveguides reveals a clear red-shift with a gradient of dλ/dT= 0. 1 nm/˚C. MSBs in these waveguides have been studied by varying the width in incremental <b>amounts.</b> <b>Analogous</b> to semiconductors heterostructures, photonic heterostructures are composed of two photonic crystals with different band-gaps obtained either by changing the air-fill factor or by the lattice constant. Juxtaposing two PhC and the use of heterostructures in waveguide geometry has been experimentally investigated in this thesis work. In particular, in multimode line defect waveguides the “internal” MSB effect brings a new dimension in single junction-type photonic crystal waveguide (JPCW) and heterostructure W 3 (HW 3) for fundamental physics and applications. We have also fabricated an ultra-compact polarization beam splitter (PBS) realized by combining a multimode waveguide with internal PhC. MSBs in heterostructure waveguides have shown interesting applications such as designable band-pass flat-top filters, and resonance-like filters with high transmission. In the course of this work, InGaAsP suspended membrane technology was developed. An H 2 cavity with a linewidth of ~ 0. 4 nm, corresponding to a Q value of ~ 3675 has been shown. InGaAsP PhC membrane is an ideal platform to study coupled quantum well/dot-nanocavity system. QC 20120831 </p...|$|R
