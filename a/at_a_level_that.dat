Bourque won five Norris Trophies as the league's top defenceman and finished second to Mark Messier in 1990 in the closest race ever for the Hart Memorial Trophy, the league's Most Valuable Player award.

25|$|With the {{adoption}} of standards-based education, most states have created examinations in which students are compared to a standard of what educators, businesspeople, parents, and other stakeholders have determined to be what every student {{should know and be}} able to do. Students are graded as exceeding, meeting, or falling below the standard. The advantage is that students are not compared against each other, and all have the opportunity to pass the standard. However, the standard is typically set <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>that</b> is substantially higher than previous achievement, so that a relatively high percentage of students fail at least some part of the standards in the first year, including an especially high percentage non-college bound students.|$|E

25|$|During WW1, the Nepalese {{army was}} {{expanded}} and six new regiments, {{totaling more than}} 20,000 troops—all volunteers—were sent to India, most {{of them to the}} North-West Frontier Province, to release British and Indian troops for service overseas. Simultaneously, the Nepalese government agreed to maintain recruitment <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>that</b> would sustain the existing British Gurkha units and allow the establishment of additional ones. The battalions were increased to thirty-three with the addition of 55,000 new recruits and Gurkha units were placed at the disposal of the British high command for service on all fronts. Many volunteers were assigned to non-combat units, such as the Army Bearer Corps and the labour battalions but they also were in combat in France, Turkey, Palestine and Mesopotamia. The Rana prime ministers urged Nepalese males to fight in the war. Of the more than 200,000 Nepalese who served in the British army, there were some 20,000 Gurkha casualties included above with the British Indian Army.|$|E
25|$|The {{most notable}} feature of Miragaia is its long neck, which was {{composed}} of at least seventeen vertebrae. According to the authors, this represents {{the culmination of a}} trend towards longer necks seen in stegosaurians. The Thyreophora, the larger group they belong to, originally seem to have had nine neck vertebrae and this is also the number shown by the basal stegosaurian Huayangosaurus. Later forms like Stegosaurus or Hesperosaurus had twelve or thirteen. This is the more remarkable that Miragaia had more neck vertebrae than most sauropods, a different group of dinosaurs and one that is famous for its long necks, which contrasts with the traditional view of stegosaurians as low browsers with short necks. Only the Chinese sauropods Euhelopus, Mamenchisaurus and Omeisaurus had as many neck vertebrae as Miragaia, with most sauropods of the Late Jurassic possessing only twelve to fifteen. Mateus and colleagues suggested that the long neck either allowed Miragaia to browse <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>that</b> other herbivores were not exploiting, or that the neck arose due to sexual selection. The possible food gathering function of the neck makes sexual selection a less plausible explanation, but is not in itself entirely convincing: though the contemporary Iberian sauropods Lusotitan, Dinheirosaurus and Turiasaurus were all very large and might not have competed with a medium-height browser, the niche partitioning is still problematic because in Iberia stegosaurian remains have been referred to Dacentrurus and Stegosaurus, which would have possessed a feeding envelope or feeding height stratification overlapping that of Miragaia.|$|E

Individuals then surrender these credits when buying fuel or electricity. Individuals wanting or needing to emit <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>level</b> above <b>that</b> permitted by their initial allocation {{would be able}} to engage in emissions trading and purchase additional credits. Conversely, those individuals who emit <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>level</b> below <b>that</b> permitted by their initial allocation have the opportunity to sell their surplus credits. Thus, individual trading under Personal Carbon Trading is similar to the trading of companies under EU ETS.|$|R

500|$|During a 20-year playing career, Bradman {{consistently}} scored <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>that</b> made him, in {{the words}} of former Australia captain Bill Woodfull, [...] "worth three batsmen to Australia". A controversial set of tactics, known as Bodyline, was specifically devised by the England team to curb his scoring. As a captain and administrator, Bradman was committed to attacking, entertaining cricket; he drew spectators in record numbers. He hated the constant adulation, however, and it affected how he dealt with others. The focus of attention on his individual performances strained relationships with some teammates, administrators and journalists, who thought him aloof and wary. Following an enforced hiatus due to the Second World War, he made a dramatic comeback, captaining an Australian team known as [...] "The Invincibles" [...] on a record-breaking unbeaten tour of England.|$|E
500|$|Oblivions view {{distance}} {{is far greater}} than its predecessor's, extending player sightlines to the horizon and giving views of distant towns and mountain ranges. According to a Microsoft press release, Oblivions game world is approximately 16 square miles (41 square kilometers) in size. Wilderness quests, ruins, and dungeons were added to fill surplus space. Content in the dungeons is more densely packed than in dungeons in Morrowind, {{with an increase in}} the frequency of creature encounters, quest-related NPCs, and puzzles. The populations represented in Oblivion, however, do not match the [...] "thousands upon thousands" [...] described in previous in-game literature. The development team decided to set the NPC populations <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>that</b> would play well, rather than one that would match game lore, since the presence {{of a large number of}} NPCs on screen would have caused the game to slow down.|$|E
500|$|Water {{fluoridation}} is {{the controlled}} addition of fluoride {{to a public}} water supply to reduce tooth decay. Fluoridated water contains fluoride <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>that</b> is effective for preventing cavities; this can occur naturally or by adding fluoride. Fluoridated water operates on tooth surfaces: in the mouth, it creates low levels of fluoride in saliva, which reduces {{the rate at which}} tooth enamel demineralizes and increases the rate at which it remineralizes {{in the early stages of}} cavities. Typically a fluoridated compound is added to drinking water, a process that in the U.S. costs an average of about $ per person-year. Defluoridation is needed when the naturally occurring fluoride level exceeds recommended limits. In 2011 the World Health Organization suggested a level of fluoride from 0.5 to 1.5mg/L (milligrams per litre), depending on climate, local environment, and other sources of fluoride. [...] Bottled water typically has unknown fluoride levels.|$|E

[...] As the demonstrators left the church, police warned them to stop and turn back, [...] "or you'll get wet". When they continued, Connor ordered the city's fire hoses, set <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>that</b> would peel bark off a tree or separate bricks from mortar, to be turned on the children. Boys' shirts were ripped off, and young women were pushed {{over the tops of}} cars by the force of the water.

Connor allowed white spectators to push forward, shouting, [...] "Let those people come forward, sergeant. I want 'em to see the dogs work." ...|$|E
500|$|Seeking to {{distinguish}} his 26-episode proposal from APF's earlier productions, Anderson attempted to pitch stories <b>at</b> <b>a</b> <b>level</b> <b>that</b> {{would appeal to}} both adults and children.

Sylvia remembers that [...] "our market had grown and a 'kidult' show... was the next step." [...] The Andersons retired to their holiday villa in Portugal to expand the premise, script the pilot episode and compose a scriptwriters' guide. According to Sylvia, the writing process depended on a [...] "division of labour", whereby Gerry created the action sequences while she managed characterisation. The decision to make a father and his sons the main characters {{was influenced by the}} premise of Bonanza, as well as Sylvia's belief that the use of more than one heroic character would broaden the series' appeal. The Tracy brothers were named after Mercury Seven astronauts: Scott Carpenter, John Glenn, Virgil [...] "Gus" [...] Grissom, Gordon Cooper and Alan Shepard.|$|E
