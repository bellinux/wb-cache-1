5|$|Glam metal band Holy Soldier, {{another group}} hailing from California, {{released}} its self-titled debut on Word and A Records (Myrrh imprint) in 1990 to critical and commercial acclaim. Two years later, the band followed up their debut with Last Train, <b>another</b> <b>critical</b> success, leading to 60 city world tour. The band Guardian achieved some mainstream attention for its album Fire and Love, {{and one of}} the videos was included in the MTV's Headbangers Ball rotation. The heavy metal band Angelica introduced vocalist Rob Rock, who also achieved initial fame as the vocalist for guitar virtuoso Chris Impellitteri's band Impellitteri during the 1980s and 1990s and then went solo with his Rage of Creation album.|$|E

25|$|Compounds at {{temperatures}} below the Curie temperature exhibit long-range magnetic {{order in the}} form of ferromagnetism. <b>Another</b> <b>critical</b> temperature is the Néel temperature, below which antiferromagnetism occurs. The hexahydrate of nickel chloride, NiCl2·6H2O, has a Néel temperature of 8.3 K. The susceptibility is a maximum at this temperature. Below the Néel temperature the susceptibility decreases and the substance becomes antiferromagnetic.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} Oldsmobile's {{critical}} successes since the mid-1990s, a reported shortfall {{in sales and}} overall profitability prompted General Motors to announce in December 2000 their plans {{to shut down the}} Oldsmobile organization. That announcement was officially revealed two days after Oldsmobile distributed the Bravada SUV - which became <b>another</b> <b>critical</b> hit for the division and turned out to be their final vehicle to manufacture.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>critical</b> {{turning point}} in the company's history was the 1964 {{decision}} to build a small-block Chevy intake manifold for a 4-barrel carburetor. The C-4B manifold, developed with help from Bob Joehnck, opened the door to a new line of performance products. Although competing with the factory was a risky proposition, {{it turned out to be}} a beneficial one, as it allowed the company to expand into a new market.|$|E
25|$|Equalisation of {{pressure}} in gas spaces to avoid barotraumas. The expansion or compression of enclosed air spaces may cause discomfort or injury while diving. Critically, the lungs {{are susceptible to}} over-expansion and subsequent collapse if a diver holds their breath while ascending: during training divers are taught to never hold their breath while diving. Ear clearing is <b>another</b> <b>critical</b> equalisation procedure, usually requiring conscious intervention by the diver.|$|E
50|$|The {{discovery}} of the CEP290 gene has led researchers to find <b>another</b> gene <b>critical</b> in retinal function, LCA5. Clinical trials involving gene replacement of these two genes have started in Philadelphia, where researchers are hopeful that Leber Congenital Amaurosis {{will one day be}} cured.|$|R
25|$|<b>Another</b> issue {{considered}} <b>critical</b> was rural sanitation, particularly measures {{aimed at}} reducing the risks of malaria and typhoid fever.|$|R
25|$|Simpson later {{preferred}} writing over political pursuits and is {{also noted}} for his other works which include a dual biography of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and <b>another</b> biography <b>critical</b> of prominent Philadelphia banker Girard. Simpson's social and political philosophy embraced both conservative and radical ideals.|$|R
25|$|Initially, the {{aircraft}} {{was to use}} Frank Whittle's latest engine, the Power Jets W.2/700, which would only reach supersonic speed in a shallow dive. To develop a fully supersonic version of {{the aircraft}}, an innovation incorporated was a reheat jetpipe – also known as an afterburner. Extra fuel was to be burned in the tailpipe to avoid overheating the turbine blades, making use of unused oxygen in the exhaust. Finally, the design included <b>another</b> <b>critical</b> element, {{the use of a}} shock cone in the nose to slow the incoming air to the subsonic speeds needed by the engine.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} Life on Earth {{prompted}} the BBC {{to consider a}} follow-up, and five years later, The Living Planet was screened. This time, Attenborough built his series around the theme of ecology, the adaptations of living things to their environment. It was <b>another</b> <b>critical</b> and commercial success, generating huge international sales for the BBC. In 1990 The Trials of Life completed the original Life trilogy, looking at animal behaviour through the different stages of life. The series drew strong reactions from the viewing public for its sequences of killer whales hunting sea lions on a Patagonian beach and chimpanzees hunting and violently killing a colobus monkey.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, Ullman {{returned}} to British television with the ITV television comedy special, Tracey Ullman: A Class Act. She {{was joined by}} Monty Python alum, Michael Palin. A Class Act took a satirical jab at the British class system. The special {{proved to be a}} critical success, garnering the attention of American cable television network, HBO. The network approached Ullman with the idea of doing a special for them, with the caveat that she take on a more American subject. Tracey Ullman Takes On New York was <b>another</b> <b>critical</b> and award-winning success, sparking HBO to offer Ullman her own series. Tracey Takes On... ran for four seasons (1996–1999), raking up numerous accolades and critical praise. It eventually aired on Channel 5 in the UK in 1998.|$|E

25|$|In 2005, after {{a bidding}} war with several labels, Sheard finally signed with Word Records and issued It's Not Over, (Originally Finally Karen 2: There's Something About Worship). the {{following}} year. Most of It's Not Over was recorded live in 2005 at Karen's home church in Detroit, Michigan while the last three tracks were studio-recorded. It was Sheard's first solo album not to feature guest vocals from her daughter (Kierra Sheard) {{and was the first}} to include production from Israel Houghton – who handled the majority of the project. Despite having a much grander sound than her previous albums, it was <b>another</b> <b>critical</b> success for Karen and charted modestly at #124 on the U.S. Billboard 200 and #4 on the U.S. Billboard Top R/Hip-Hop Albums.|$|E
25|$|Vanderbilt {{subsequently}} played <b>another</b> <b>critical</b> role on Amasa Stone's railroad career. Vanderbilt wanted {{control of}} the Lake Shore Railway, which had formed out {{of a combination of}} smaller Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois railroads on March 31, 1868. In May 1868, Vanderbilt's proxies attended the first Lake Shore stockholders' meeting, and discovered that LeGrand Lockwood had a sizeable financial interest in the company. Vanderbilt was defeated in his attempt to install his own man as the Lake Shore's president. During the next several months, Lockwood worked with investor and robber baron Jay Gould, who was engaged in the Erie War for {{control of the}} Erie Railroad and wanted to divert all Lake Shore traffic to the Erie. On August 19, 1869, Lockwood and Gould rammed their plan through the Lake Shore's board of directors. Vanderbilt fought them, but his only victory was in securing the election of Amasa Stone to the Lake Shore's board. Stone served until his health failed again in 1875, when he resigned.|$|E
25|$|<b>Another</b> <b>critical</b> {{addition}} {{was the use}} of a power-operated stabilator, {{also known}} as the all-moving tail or flying tail, a key to supersonic flight control which contrasted with traditional hinged tailplanes (horizontal stabilizers) connected mechanically to the pilot's control column. Conventional control surfaces became ineffective at the high subsonic speeds then being achieved by fighters in dives, due to the aerodynamic forces caused by the formation of shockwaves at the hinge and the rearward movement of the centre of pressure, which together could override the control forces that could be applied mechanically by the pilot, hindering recovery from the dive. A major impediment to early transonic flight was control reversal, the phenomenon which caused flight inputs (stick, rudder) to switch direction at high speed; it was the cause of many accidents and near-accidents. An all-flying tail {{is considered to be a}} minimum condition of enabling aircraft to break the transonic barrier safely without a loss of pilot control. The M.52 was the first instance of this solution, which has since gone on to be universally applied upon high-speed aircraft.|$|E
500|$|The {{success of}} the singles and album allowed the Kinks to {{negotiate}} a new contract with RCA Records, construct their own London Studio, which they named Konk, and assume more creative and managerial control. The record also proved influential: Tom Petty told Rolling Stone that he [...] "especially liked" [...] it, and cited the album as an influence on The Last DJ, <b>another</b> album <b>critical</b> of the music industry.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> {{organisation}} <b>critical</b> of {{the treatment}} of Fantome Island patients was the Relatives and Friends Association. Dedicated to improving the rights and conditions of patients with Hansen's disease, the Association became particularly active around 1950, donating packages of food, toys and other items to the patients, writing letters to the Queensland Government demanding better lazaret conditions or an end to isolation, and publishing a newsletter, the Moreton Star.|$|R

25|$|Meanwhile, Thomas began courting Lucy Coleman, {{daughter}} of Pittsburgh iron manufacturing magnate William Coleman. Coleman provided Thomas with critical {{advice on how}} to improve the Union Iron Mills, and inside information on the coming railroad building boom. <b>Another</b> <b>critical</b> business relationship was with Piper & Shiffler (later known as the Keystone Bridge Company), an iron bridge building firm invested in by Andrew Carnegie in 1862. Andrew diverted much of Piper & Shiffler's contracts to the Union Iron Mills, further bolstering the company's profits. Tom often tried to rein in some of his brother's excesses, but to no avail. For example, in 1866 Andrew proposed purchasing a pipe works adjacent to the old Cyclops iron works. Thomas opposed the purchase, arguing that the time for expansion was not ripe and that the pipe works used a kind of iron which the Union Iron Mills did not produce. The pipe works {{turned out to be a}} white elephant, but they burned down shortly thereafter (saving the firm from further losses).|$|E
25|$|The Coen brothers' next film, O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000), was <b>another</b> <b>critical</b> and {{commercial}} success. The title was {{borrowed from the}} Preston Sturges film Sullivan's Travels (1941), whose lead character, movie director John Sullivan, had planned {{to make a film}} with that title. Based loosely on Homer's Odyssey (complete with a cyclops, sirens, et al.), the story is set in Mississippi in the 1930s and follows a trio of escaped convicts who, after absconding from a chain gang, journey home to recover bank-heist loot the leader has buried—but they have no clear perception of where they are going. The film highlighted the comic abilities of George Clooney as the oddball lead character Ulysses Everett McGill, and of Tim Blake Nelson and John Turturro, his sidekicks. The film's bluegrass and old-time soundtrack, offbeat humor and digitally desaturated cinematography made it a critical {{and commercial}} hit. It was the first feature film to use all-digital color grading. The film's soundtrack CD was also successful, spawning a concert and concert/documentary DVD, Down from the Mountain, that coincided with a resurgence in interest in American folk music.|$|E
5000|$|In 2015, {{the film}} 45 Years, based on Constantine's short story [...] "In <b>Another</b> Country", enjoyed <b>critical</b> acclaim. The film stars Tom Courtenay and Charlotte Rampling. Rampling was {{nominated}} for an Academy Award for her performance.|$|R
25|$|Nancy Olson's pairing with William Holden was {{considered}} a success, and she appeared opposite him in several films during the 1950s, although none of them repeated their earlier success. She went on to star in The Absent-Minded Professor (1961) and Son of Flubber (1963), {{in which she was}} paired with Fred MacMurray, but despite the films' popularity with movie-goers, her career stalled. Holden and Wilder also rejoined forces in 1978 for Fedora, <b>another</b> film <b>critical</b> of Hollywood.|$|R
50|$|<b>Another</b> less <b>critical</b> {{response}} to Al-Ghazali's arguments {{was written by}} Ibn Rushd's predecessor Ibn Tufail (Abubacer) {{as part of his}} Arabic philosophical novel, Hayy ibn Yaqzan (later translated into Latin and English as Philosophus Autodidactus). Ibn Tufail cites al-Ghazali as an influence on his novel, especially his views on Sufism, but was critical of his views against Avicennism. Ibn al-Nafis later wrote another novel, Theologus Autodidactus, as a {{response to}} Ibn Tufail's Philosophus Autodidactus, defending some of al-Ghazali's views.|$|R
25|$|Although Pollock {{is closely}} {{associated}} with Action Painting because of his style, technique, and his painterly touch and his physical application of paint, art critics have likened Pollock to both Action painting and color field painting. <b>Another</b> <b>critical</b> view advanced by Clement Greenberg connects Pollock's allover canvasses to the large-scale Water Lilies of Claude Monet done during the 1920s. Greenberg, art critic Michael Fried, and others have observed that the overall feeling in Pollock's most famous works – his drip paintings – read as vast fields of built-up linear elements often reading as vast complexes of similar valued paint skeins that read as all over fields of color and drawing, and {{are related to the}} mural-sized late Monets that are constructed of many passages of close valued brushed and scumbled marks that also read as close valued fields of color and drawing that Monet used in building his picture surfaces. Pollock's use of all-over composition lend a philosophical and a physical connection to the way the color field painters like Newman, Rothko and Still construct their unbroken and in Still's case broken surfaces. In several paintings that Pollock painted after his classic drip painting period of 1947-1950, he used the technique of staining fluid oil paint and house paint into raw canvas. During 1951 he produced a series of semi-figurative black stain paintings, and in 1952 he produced stain paintings using color. In his November 1952 exhibition at the Sidney Janis Gallery in New York City Pollock showed Number 12, 1952, a large, masterful stain painting that resembles a brightly colored stained landscape (with an overlay of broadly dripped dark paint); the painting was acquired from the exhibition by Nelson Rockefeller for his personal collection. In 1960 the painting was severely damaged by fire in the Governors Mansion in Albany that also severely damaged an Arshile Gorky painting and several other works in the Rockefeller collection. However, by 1999 it had been restored and was installed in Albany Mall.|$|E
