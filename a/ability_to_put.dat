5|$|A less violent side to Alexander's {{government}} {{is demonstrated by}} other evidence. Over a century after his time, his administrative decisions were still being cited as precedents. Some of these are known from a surviving edict issued on July 6, 68, {{less than a month}} after Nero's death. This denounces, and introduces measures against, a variety of abuses including inaccurate tax assessments, malicious prosecutions and the imprisonment of debtors by private creditors. The edict's only allusion to the chaotic political situation comes as a call for trust in the benevolence of the new Emperor, Galba, and his <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> right the wrongs of the past. Alexander was making representations to Galba on behalf of the provincials, presumably representing the desired reforms as the price of loyalty from this vital grain-producing province.|$|E
5|$|The Maltese {{position}} {{had already}} been severely weakened by {{the large number of}} Frenchmen who were part of the Order, who refused en masse to take up arms against Bonaparte. The French Revolution had already significantly reduced the Knights' income and their <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> up serious resistance to Bonaparte was seriously compromised by a lack of resources. On 12 June, Bonaparte finally announced to his troops the destination of the expedition and on 19 June he sailed for Alexandria, initially steering east towards Crete. He left behind Vaubois and 4,000 men to maintain Malta as a base to control the Central Mediterranean. To ensure that news of the impending attack on Egypt did not spread ahead of the fleet, Brueys ordered that any merchant ships that sighted the convoy during the passage were to be seized and detained until his force had reached Alexandria. On 26 June, the British gained the first firm intelligence of French intentions, when the frigate HMS Seahorse under Captain Edward Foote encountered and captured the French frigate Sensible, which was returning to Toulon from Malta with a cargo of treasure and wounded soldiers, including General d'Hilliers. From these prisoners the destination of the French fleet was discovered and Seahorse, joined shortly afterwards by Terpsichore, sailed in pursuit, hoping to encounter Nelson.|$|E

25|$|The one-bit SD {{protocol}} {{was derived from}} the MMC protocol, which envisioned the <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> up to three cards on a bus of common signal lines. The cards use open collector interfaces, where a card may pull a line to the low voltage level; the line is at the high voltage level (because of a pull-up resistor) if no card pulls it low.

The <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> aside stubborn problems is referred to by Jex & Britt as productive forgetting. Creativity-relevant skills also require the individual contributor to evaluate a problem from multiple vantage points. One must be able to take on the perspective of various users.

25|$|An {{important}} quality {{which supports}} right action is Heedfulness (Appamada), {{a combination of}} energy/effort (Viriya) and Mindfulness. Mindfulness is an alert presence of mind which allows one to be more aware {{of what is happening}} with one's intentional states. Heedfulness is aided by 'clear comprehension' or 'discrimination' (Sampajañña), which gives rise to moral knowledge of what is to be done. Another important supporting quality of Buddhist morality is Trust or Confidence in the teachings of the Buddha and in one's own <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> them into practice. Wisdom and Understanding are seen as a prerequisite for acting morally. Having an understanding of the true nature of reality is seen as leading to ethical actions. Understanding the truth of not-self for example, allows one to become detached from selfish motivations and therefore allows one to be more altruistic. Having an understanding of the workings of the mind and of the law of karma also makes one less likely to perform an unethical action.|$|E

In his adult years, Aang grew a neatly cropped chinstrap beard, which many statues of Aang's adult form depict him with, including the one in the restored Southern Air Temple. He also founded the Air Acolytes, a sect who eschewed their home cultures in favor of following the Air Nomads' way of life (the comics reveal that the first Air Acolytes were the reorganized Avatar Fan Club). [...] A forty-year-old Aang assisted Toph in arresting Water Tribe crime lord Yakone. As Aang watched the trial where Yakone was convicted of using the rare and illegal technique Bloodbending, Yakone tried to escape Republic City, using his unique <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> subdue everyone in the court room, thus leaving them unconscious.

One of his first moves in the House was to help block passage of the Equal Rights Amendment; the state House Speaker George Ryan appointed Hastert to a committee that worked to prevent the ERA from coming to the House floor. In the state House, Hastert opposed bills barring discrimination against gays; supported (unsuccessfully) proposals to raise the driving age to 18; and voted for a mandatory seat belt law, although he later voted to repeal it.|$|E

40|$|Participation and {{legitimate}} opposition are two central features of what Robert Dahl identified as polyarchies. Despite normative emphases {{on the importance}} of political opposition for ‘more’ democracy, studies of opposition parties are yet to flourish. By comparing the British Labour Party and the Democratic Party of Japan, this paper will explore {{the way in which the}} practice of a political party in opposition has an impact on the party's performance once in government. Both Britain and Japan are known to be parliamentary democracies, experiencing an alternation of power by landslide: Britain in 1997 and Japan in 2009. However, the Labour government in Britain and the coalition government led by the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) showed a remarkable difference in their <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> their election manifestoes into practice, as well as in their courses of policy position after they took power. To understand the discrepancy between the Labour Party and the DPJ in their performances in government, this paper will argue that the power resources provided for the party leadership, and the intra-party decisionmaking system, both of which are set during the years in opposition, define, to a significant extent, the strength of the political leadership once in government...|$|R
40|$|Funding: The College of Radiographers Partnership SchemeMammography {{is often}} painful and unpleasant, but {{effective}} interventions {{to improve the}} experience remain scarce. As a first step towards more effective interventions, we aimed to achieve a thorough, contemporary understanding of thoughts, feelings and behaviours which affect and arise from mammography experiences. Research and professional experience suggest that the interaction between client and practitioner may be paramount in determining {{the quality of a}} client’s experience. Therefore this study aimed to capture the perspectives of clients and mammography staff from UK breast screening programmes. Thematic analysis of semi-structured qualitative in-depth interviews with 22 clients and 18 staff revealed that clients had positive attitudes to breast screening and mostly low knowledge about potential harms. Staff data indicated that some women attend for breast screening under pressure from others. Pain and coping with it were prominent themes, with wide variations in pain experiences. Clients recognised differences in mammographers’ <b>abilities</b> <b>to</b> <b>put</b> them at ease. Staff difficulties included empowering clients within the confines of a taxing technique, and maintaining compassionate care when under strain. Future intervention development should focus on the information and support needs of women prior to the appointment and on effectively training and supporting mammographers to deal with challenging encounters.
