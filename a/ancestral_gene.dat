5|$|Mutations {{can involve}} large {{sections}} of a chromosome becoming duplicated (usually by genetic recombination), which can introduce extra copies of a gene into a genome. Extra copies of genes are {{a major source of}} the raw material needed for new genes to evolve. This is important because most new genes evolve within gene families from pre-existing genes that share common ancestors. For example, the human eye uses four genes to make structures that sense light: three for colour vision and one for night vision; all four are descended from a single <b>ancestral</b> <b>gene.</b>|$|E
5|$|New genes can be {{generated}} from an <b>ancestral</b> <b>gene</b> when a duplicate copy mutates and acquires a new function. This process is easier once a gene has been duplicated because it increases the redundancy of the system; one gene in the pair can acquire a new function while the other copy continues to perform its original function. Other types of mutations can even generate entirely new genes from previously noncoding DNA.|$|E
5|$|A central {{organizing}} {{concept in}} biology is that life changes and develops through evolution, {{and that all}} life-forms known have a common origin. The theory of evolution postulates that all organisms on the Earth, both living and extinct, have descended from a common ancestor or an <b>ancestral</b> <b>gene</b> pool. This universal common ancestor of all organisms {{is believed to have}} appeared about 3.5 billion years ago. Biologists regard the ubiquity of the genetic code as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent for all bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes (see: origin of life).|$|E
40|$|International audienceDeCoSTAR is a {{software}} that aims at reconstructing {{the organization of}} <b>ancestral</b> <b>genes</b> or genomes {{in the form of}} sets of neighborhood relations (adjacencies) between pairs of <b>ancestral</b> <b>genes</b> or gene domains. It can also improve the assembly of fragmented genomes by proposing evolutionary-induced adjacencies between scaffolding fragments. <b>Ancestral</b> <b>genes</b> or domains are deduced from reconciled phylogenetic trees under an evolutionary model that considers gains, losses, speciations, duplications, and transfers as possible events for gene evolution. Reconciliations are either given as input or computed with the ecceTERA package, into which DeCoSTAR is integrated. DeCoSTAR computes adjacency evolutionary scenarios using a scoring scheme based on a weighted sum of adjacency gains and breakages. Solutions, both optimal and near-optimal, are sampled according to the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution centered around parsimonious solutions, and statistical supports on ancestral and extant adjacencies are provided. DeCoSTAR supports the features of previously-contributed tools that reconstruct ancestral adjacencies, namely DeCo, DeCoLT, ART-DeCo and DeClone. In a few minutes, DeCoSTAR can reconstruct the evolutionary history of domains inside genes, of gene fusion and fission events, or of gene order along chromosomes, for large data sets including dozens of whole genomes from all kingdoms of life. We illustrate the potential of DeCoSTAR with several applications: <b>ancestral</b> reconstruction of <b>gene</b> orders for Anopheles mosquito genomes, multidomain proteins in Drosophila, and gene fusion and fission detection in Actinobacteria.

40|$|Recent {{thought on}} genome {{evolution}} {{has focused on}} the creation of new genes and changes in regulatory mechanisms while ignoring the role of selective gene loss in shaping genomes. Using data from two cnidarians, the jellyfish Clytia and the coral Acropora, we examined the relative significance of new ‘taxonomically restricted’ genes and selectively retained <b>ancestral</b> <b>genes</b> in enabling the evolution of novel traits. Consistent with its more complex life-cycle, the proportion of novel genes identified in Clytia was higher than that in the ‘polyp only’ cnidarians Nematostella and Hydra, but each of these cnidarians has retained a proportion of <b>ancestral</b> <b>genes</b> not present in the other two. The ubiquity and near-stochastic nature of gene loss can explain the discord between patterns of gene distribution and taxonomy...|$|R

25|$|Recently, {{there had}} been {{discussion}} connecting copy number variations to gene families. Gene families are defined {{as a set of}} related genes that serve similar functions but have minor temporal or spatial differences and these genes likely derived from one <b>ancestral</b> <b>gene.</b> The main reason copy number variations are connected to gene families {{is that there is a}} possibility that genes in a family may have derived from one <b>ancestral</b> <b>gene</b> which got duplicated into different copies. Mutations accumulate through time in the genes and with natural selection acting on the genes, some mutations lead to environmental advantages allowing those genes to be inherited and eventually clear gene families are separated out. An example of a gene family that may have been created due to copy number variations is the globin gene family. The globin gene family is an elaborate network of genes consisting of alpha and beta globin genes including genes that are expressed in both embryos and adults as well as pseudogenes. These globin genes in the globin family are all well conserved and only differ by a small portion of the gene, indicating that they were derived from a common <b>ancestral</b> <b>gene,</b> perhaps due to duplication of the initial globin gene.|$|E

25|$|Mutations {{can involve}} the {{duplication}} of {{large sections of}} DNA, usually through genetic recombination. These duplications are {{a major source of}} raw material for evolving new genes, with tens to hundreds of genes duplicated in animal genomes every million years. Most genes belong to larger gene families of shared ancestry, known as homology. Novel genes are produced by several methods, commonly through the duplication and mutation of an <b>ancestral</b> <b>gene,</b> or by recombining parts of different genes to form new combinations with new functions.|$|E
25|$|According to Eichler and Sankoff the two mean {{processes}} in eukaryotic chromosome evolution are 1) rearrangements of chromosomal segments and 2) localized duplication of genes. Clustering {{could be explained}} by reasoning that all genes in a cluster are originated from tandem duplicates of a common ancestor. If all co-expressed genes in a cluster were evolved from a common <b>ancestral</b> <b>gene</b> it would have been expected that they’re co-expressed because they all have comparable promoters. However, gene clustering is a very common tread in genomes and it isn’t clear how this duplication model could explain all of the clustering. Furthermore, many genes that are present in clusters are not homologous.|$|E
25|$|Another {{instance}} of lateral gene transfer {{is responsible for}} S. mutans’ acquisition of the glucosyltransferase (GTF) gene, which allows the bacteria to produce polysaccharides from sucrose. These sticky polysaccharides {{are responsible for the}} bacteria’s ability to aggregate with one another and adhere to tooth enamel, i.e. to form biofilms. The GTF genes found in S. mutans most likely are derived from other anaerobic bacteria found in the oral cavity, such as Lactobacillus or Leuconostoc. Additionally, the GTF genes in S. mutans display homology with similar genes found in Lactobacillus and Leuconostoc. The common <b>ancestral</b> <b>gene</b> {{is believed to have been}} used for hydrolysis and linkage of carbohydrates.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The histone-like nucleoid-structuring (H-NS) protein binds to {{horizontally}} acquired {{genes in}} the bacterium Salmo-nella enterica serovar Typhimurium, silencing their expression. We now report that overcoming the silencing effects of H-NS imposes a delay in the expression of genes activated by the transcriptional regulator PhoP. We determine that PhoP-activated <b>genes</b> <b>ancestral</b> to Salmonella are expressed before those acquired horizontally. This expression timing reflects the in vivo occu-pancy of the corresponding promoters by the PhoP protein. These results are surprising because some of these horizontally ac-quired genes reached higher mRNA levels than <b>ancestral</b> <b>genes</b> expressed earlier and were transcribed from promoters harboring PhoP-binding sites with higher in vitro affinity for the PhoP protein. Our findings challenge the often-made assumption that for genes coregulated by a given transcription factor, early genes are transcribed to higher mRNA levels than those transcribed at later times. Moreover, they provide a singular example of how gene ancestry can impact expression timing. IMPORTANCE We report that gene ancestry dictates the expression behavior of genes under the direct control of the Salmonella transcriptional regulator PhoP. That is, <b>ancestral</b> <b>genes</b> are transcribed before horizontally acquired genes. This reflects both the need to overcome silencing by the H-NS protein of the latter genes and {{the architecture of the}} corresponding promoters. Unex...|$|R

40|$|We have reconstructed {{the gene}} content and {{order of the}} last common {{ancestor}} of the human pathogens Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. During the reductive evolution of M. leprae, 1537 of 2977 <b>ancestral</b> <b>genes</b> were lost, among which we found 177 previously unnoticed pseudogenes. We find evidence that a massive gene inactivation took place very recently in the M. leprae lineage, leading {{to the loss of}} hundreds of <b>ancestral</b> <b>genes.</b> A large proportion of their nucleotide content (∼ 89 %) still remains in the genome, which allowed us to characterize and date them. The age of the pseudogenes was computed using a new methodology based on the rates and patterns of substitution in the pseudogenes and functional orthologous genes of closely related genomes. The position of the genes that were lost in the ancestor’s genome revealed that the process of function loss and degradation mainly took place through a gene-to-gene inactivation process, followed by the gradual loss of their DNA. This suggests a scenario of massive genome reduction through many nearly simultaneous pseudogenization events, leading to a highly specialized pathogen...|$|R
25|$|Here, protein domains act as modules, {{each with}} a {{particular}} and independent function, that can be mixed together to produce genes encoding new proteins with novel properties. For example, the human eye uses four genes to make structures that sense light: three for cone cell or color vision and one for rod cell or night vision; all four arose from a single <b>ancestral</b> <b>gene.</b> Another advantage of duplicating a gene (or even an entire genome) is that this increases engineering redundancy; this allows one gene in the pair to acquire a new function while the other copy performs the original function. Other types of mutation occasionally create new genes from previously noncoding DNA.|$|E
25|$|Another gene {{necessary}} for synthesis of di-rhamnolipids, rhlC, {{has also been}} identified. RhlC catalyses {{the addition of the}} second rhamnose moiety to mono-rhamnolipids forming di-rhamnolipids, hence is often labelled rhamnosyltransferase 2. Like rhlA and rhlB, rhlC is thought to be an <b>ancestral</b> <b>gene</b> controlled by the same quorum sensing system as rhlA and rhlB. The rhamnose moiety for mono- and di-rhamnolipids is derived from AlgC activity and the RmlABCD pathway, encoded on the rmlBCAD operon. AlgC produces sugar precursors directly for alginate and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as well as rhamnolipids. In rhamnose synthesis, AlgC produces glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) which is converted to dTDP-D-glucose by RmlA followed by conversion to dTDP-6-deoxy-D-4-hexulose and then dTDP-6-deoxy-L-lyxo-4-hexulose by RmlB and RmlC respectively. Finally, dTDP-6-deoxy-L-lyxo-4-hexulose is converted to dTDP-L-rhamnose by RmlD. The rhamnose can then be used in the synthesis of rhamnolipids by RhlB and RhlC.|$|E
500|$|All organisms on Earth are {{descended from}} a common {{ancestor}} or <b>ancestral</b> <b>gene</b> pool. Current species are a stage {{in the process of}} evolution, with their diversity the product of a long series of speciation and extinction events. The common descent of organisms was first deduced from four simple facts about organisms: First, they have geographic distributions that cannot be explained by local adaptation. Second, the diversity of life is not a set of completely unique organisms, but organisms that share morphological similarities. Third, vestigial traits with no clear purpose resemble functional ancestral traits and finally, that organisms can be classified using these similarities into a hierarchy of nested groups—similar to a family tree.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{here the}} reconstruction of the genome of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of modern monocots and eudicots, accounting for 95 % of extant angiosperms, with its potential repertoire of 22, 899 <b>ancestral</b> <b>genes</b> conserved in present-day crops. The MRCA provides a starting point for deciphering the reticulated evolutionary plasticity between species (rapidly versus slowly evolving lineages), subgenomes (pre- versus post-duplication blocks), genomic compartments (stable versus labile loci), <b>genes</b> (<b>ancestral</b> versus species-specific <b>genes)</b> and functions (gained versus lost ontologies), the key mutational forces driving the success of polyploidy in crops. The estimation of the timing of angiosperm evolution, based on MRCA genes, suggested that this group emerged 214 million years ago during the late Triassic era, before the oldest recorded fossil. Finally, the MRCA constitutes a unique resource for scientists to dissect major agronomic traits in translational genomics studies extending from model species to crops...|$|R

Saposins are highly conserved glycoproteins, approximately 80 amino acid residues long and forming a four alpha helical structure. They have a nearly identical placement of cysteine residues and glycosylation sites. The cDNA sequence that codes for saposin is called prosaposin.
