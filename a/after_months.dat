40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of Opalescence PF 10 % just after treatment, at 6 -month follow-up and at a 14 -month follow-up period. Methods: Opalescence PF 10 % was applied nightly for 14 days. The color of teeth 11 and 21 of 17 subjects were measured with a spectrophotometer (L*; a*; b*) before treatment, just after treatment (14 days), <b>after</b> 6 <b>months</b> and <b>after</b> 14 <b>months.</b> Subjects were instructed to take note of any tooth sensitivity. Results: For all three components (L*, a* and b*) statistical significant differences (p < 0. 05) in the values between base-line, after treatment (14 days later), <b>after</b> 6 <b>months</b> and <b>after</b> 14 <b>months</b> were found (Wilcoxon Signed Rank Sum Test). The decrease in L* was about 20 % <b>after</b> 6 <b>months</b> and about 50 % <b>after</b> 14 <b>months.</b> The a* value decreased approximately 14 % <b>after</b> 6 <b>months</b> but was worse <b>after</b> 14 <b>months</b> than at the beginning.

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} chronic hypoxia on human spermatogenic parameters and their recovery time. METHODS: Seminological parameters of six male healthy mountain trekkers were evaluated in normoxia at sea level. After 26 days exposure to altitude (ranging from 2 000 m to 5 600 m, Karakorum Expedition) the same parameters were again evaluated after returning to sea level. These parameters were once again evaluated <b>after</b> 1 <b>month</b> and then again <b>after</b> 6 <b>months.</b> RESULTS: Sperm count {{was found to be}} lower immediately after returning to sea level (P = 0. 0004) and again <b>after</b> a <b>month</b> (P = 0. 0008). Normal levels were reached <b>after</b> 6 <b>months.</b> Spermatic motility (%) shows no reduction immediately after returning to sea level (P = 0. 0583), whereas <b>after</b> 1 <b>month</b> this reduction was significant (P = 0. 0066). <b>After</b> 6 <b>months</b> there was a recovery to pre-hypoxic exposure values.
