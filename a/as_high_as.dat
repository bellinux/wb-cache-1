Sites upstream of Vassar Lake were recorded in a separate study as having specific conductances twice <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> locations downstream of the lake, suggesting a regulating effect caused by water mixing and retention in Vassar Lake. The total inorganic nitrogen in the kill, which is usually correlated with surrounding green cover, was about , average for measurements taken in the Fonteyn Kill and Casperkill in that study. The study also found that the Fonteyn Kill's score on the Hilsenhoff family biotic index (HBI), a scale measuring pollution based on the tolerance of endemic benthic macroinvertebrates, was approximately six, indicating fairly poor water quality, with scores {{for the rest of the}} Casperkill–Fonteyn Kill watershed were <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> seven (poor water quality) to as low as four (very good water quality).|$|E
