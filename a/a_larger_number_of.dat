After the Spanish Civil War the club started attracting more members and <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> spectators at matches. This led to several expansion projects: the grandstand in 1944, the southern stand in 1946, and finally the northern stand in 1950.

5|$|Loveless is {{the second}} studio album by Irish rock band My Bloody Valentine, {{released}} on 4 November 1991 by Creation Records. The album was recorded {{over a two-year period}} between 1989 and 1991. Vocalist and guitarist Kevin Shields dominated the arduous recording process; intent on achieving a particular sound, he experimented with texturised guitar tremolo techniques and tuning systems, unorthodox production methods, obscured vocals, and sampled percussion and feedback. The group cycled through nineteen studios and <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> engineers during the album's two-year creation, with total recording costs rumoured to have reached £250,000.|$|E

If the population of aposematic individuals all originated from the same few individuals, the predator learning process would result in a stronger warning signal for surviving kin, resulting in higher inclusive fitness for the dead or injured individuals through kin selection.|$|E

5|$|D'Eyncourt {{probably}} avoided proposing any {{design with}} 16-inch guns {{when he saw}} the political situation. In meetings with Leão, designs of only ten 12-inch guns mounted on the centerline were quickly rejected, even though their broadside was as strong as that of the Minas Geraes class, but a design with no less than fourteen 12-inch guns emerged as the frontrunner. Author David Topliss attributes this to political necessity, as he believed the Minister of the Navy could not validate purchasing a seemingly less-powerful dreadnought than the Minas Geraes class: with larger guns ruled out, the only remaining choice was <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> guns.|$|E
5|$|Epidemiological {{studies of}} {{serotonin}} syndrome are difficult as many physicians {{are unaware of}} the diagnosis or they may miss the syndrome due to its variable manifestations.

The incidence may be increasing as <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> pro-serotonergic drugs (drugs which increase serotonin levels) are now being used in clinical practice. One postmarketing surveillance study identified an incidence of 0.4 cases per 1000 patient-months for patients who were taking nefazodone.

5|$|For {{owners of}} 33rpm LPs and 45singles, loud and deep bass was {{limited by the}} ability of the {{phonograph}} record stylus to track the groove. Some hi-fi aficionados solved the problem by using reel-to-reel tape players which were capable of delivering accurate, naturally deep bass from acoustic sources, or synthetic bass not found in nature. With the popular introduction of the compact cassette and the CD, it became possible to add more low frequency content to recordings, and satisfy <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> consumers.

5|$|Once {{purchased}} by Sightholders (which is a trademark term {{referring to the}} companies that have a three-year supply contract with DTC), diamonds are cut and polished in preparation for sale as gemstones ('industrial' stones are regarded as a by-product of the gemstone market; they are used for abrasives). The cutting and polishing of rough diamonds is a specialized skill that is concentrated in {{a limited number of}} locations worldwide. Traditional diamond cutting centers are Antwerp, Amsterdam, Johannesburg, New York City, and Tel Aviv. Recently, diamond cutting centers have been established in China, India, Thailand, Namibia and Botswana. Cutting centers with lower cost of labor, notably Surat in Gujarat, India, handle <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> smaller carat diamonds, while smaller quantities of larger or more valuable diamonds {{are more likely to be}} handled in Europe or North America.

5|$|The Thoroughbred as it {{is known}} today was {{developed}} in 17th- and 18th-century England, when native mares were crossbred with imported Oriental stallions of Arabian, Barb, and Turkoman breeding.

During the 18th and 19th centuries, the Thoroughbred breed spread throughout the world; they were imported into North America starting in 1730 and into Australia, Europe, Japan and South America during the 19th century.

5|$|The average horse {{can carry}} up to {{approximately}} 30% {{of its body}} weight. While all horses can pull more than they can carry, the weight horses can pull varies widely, depending on the build of the horse, the type of vehicle, road conditions, and other factors. Horses harnessed to a wheeled vehicle on a paved road can pull as much as eight times their weight, but far less if pulling wheelless loads over unpaved terrain. Thus, horses that were driven varied in size and {{had to make a}} trade-off between speed and weight, just as did riding animals. Light horses could pull a small war chariot at speed. Heavy supply wagons, artillery, and support vehicles were pulled by heavier horses or <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> horses. The method by which a horse was hitched to a vehicle also mattered: horses could pull greater weight with a horse collar than they could with a breast collar, and even less with an ox yoke.|$|E

5|$|The most {{significant}} coin find {{from the end}} of Roman Britain, the hoard contains all major denominations of coinage of the time, and many examples of clipped silver coinage typical of late Roman Britain.

The largest single Romano-British hoard was the Cunetio Hoard, of 54,951 third-century coins, but these were debased radiates with little precious-metal content. The Frome Hoard, unearthed in Somerset in April 2010, contains 52,503 coins minted between 253 and 305, also mostly debased silver or bronze. Larger hoards of Roman coins have been found at Misrata, Libya and reputedly also at Evreux, France (100,000 coins) and Komin, Croatia (300,000 coins).|$|E
5|$|This {{interpretation}} {{has been}} accepted by most modern scholars.

He considers that the 300 mounted warriors would have been accompanied by <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> foot soldiers, not considered worthy of mention in the poem. Jarman also follows Williams' interpretation. Jackson suggested that {{after the fall of}} the kingdom of Gododdin, in or about 638, the poem was preserved in Strathclyde, which maintained its independence for several centuries. He considers that it was first written down in Strathclyde after a period of oral transmission, and may have reached Wales in manuscript form between the end of the 8th and the end of the 9th century. There would be particular interest in matters relating to the Gododdin in Gwynedd, since the founding myth of the kingdom involved the coming of Cunedda Wledig from Manaw Gododdin.|$|E
5|$|In 1910, Sadler went to Europe {{and studied}} {{psychiatry}} {{for a year}} under Sigmund Freud. Sometime between 1906 and 1911, Sadler attempted to treat a patient with an unusual sleep condition. While the patient was sleeping he spoke to Sadler and claimed to be an extraterrestrial. Sadler spent years observing the sleeping man {{in an effort to}} explain the phenomenon, and eventually decided the man had no mental illness and that his words were genuine. The man's identity was never publicized, but speculation has focused on Sadler's brother-in-law, Wilfred Kellogg. Over the course of several years, Sadler and his assistants visited the man while he slept, conversing with him about spirituality, history, and cosmology, and asking him questions. <b>A</b> <b>larger</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> interested people met at Sadler's home to discuss the man's responses and to suggest additional questions. The man's words were eventually published in The Urantia Book, and the Urantia Foundation was created to assist Sadler in spreading the book's message. It is not known who wrote and edited the book, but several commentators have speculated that Sadler played a guiding role in its publication. Although it never became the basis of an organized religion, the book attracted followers who devoted themselves to its study, and the movement continued after Sadler's death.|$|E
