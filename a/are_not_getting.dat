25|$|At 12 months, the Consorzio Parmigiano-Reggiano {{inspects}} every wheel. The {{cheese is}} tested by a master grader who taps each wheel to identify undesirable cracks and voids within the wheel. Wheels that {{pass the test}} are then heat branded on the rind with the Consorzio's logo. Those that do not pass the test used to have their rinds marked with lines or crosses {{all the way around}} to inform consumers that they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> top-quality Parmigiano-Reggiano; more recent practices simply have these lesser rinds stripped of all markings.|$|E
25|$|The ignorance fallacy is {{sometimes}} confused (or combined) with logically valid contrapositive arguments. Contrapositive arguments rightly utilize the transposition rule of inference in classical logic to conclude something like: To {{the extent that}} C implies E then Not-E must also imply Not-C. In other words, if a cause always leads to an effect, then absence of the expected effect is evidence of absence of the cause. For example, if the causal proposition that If it's raining outside then the streets will be wet is assumed, then it can be assumed that if the streets are not wet then it is not raining outside. The inference that it cannot be raining outside because the streets <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> wet is exactly as true, or perhaps exactly as untrue, as the original proposition. The statements are logically equivalent.|$|E
25|$|Irrigation canals are {{classified}} into principal canals (Rayah), main canals (first level canals), branch canals (second level canals), distribution canals (Mesqas, or third level canals) and irrigation ditches (Merwas). Flow in {{the principal and}} main canals is continuous; in the branch and distribution canals it is on a rotation basis. However, the government supports a process of converting some of the lower-level canals gradually to continuous flow. Farmers pump water from the mesqas to irrigate fields (lift: about 0.5-1.5 m). A Mesqa typically serves an area of 50 to 200 feddan (20 to 80 hectares). In areas {{where there is no}} formal operational structure for proper water distribution, the tail-end users usually <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> enough water to maintain crops. Water user associations have been formed beginning in the 1990s to better distribute water among farmers on a mesqa and to rationalize pumping, with the aim of reducing water abstraction, pumping costs and to increase yields.|$|E

5000|$|In May 1968 {{students}} rioted in Paris and elsewhere. French, German and Italian students {{protested that}} they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> the education they needed: many lecturers were out-of-touch {{and there were}} too few good ones. Lectures were over-crowded and students <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> the help they needed. In Britain many students refused to leave their universities and art schools and [...] "sat-in".

500|$|English-speaking {{film critics}} were more lenient towards Afrikaans-language films lest they {{be accused of}} Boerehaat. According to The Star film critic Robert Greig, [...] "An apology {{situation}} developed with the English-language newspapers who tended not to slam Afrikaans films because they didn't want {{to be accused of}} boerehaat (Boer-hater)." [...] According to film critic Barry Ronge, [...] "The cries of boerehaat come from the industry itself when they feel they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> 'support'." ...|$|E
500|$|While the Australian {{team lost}} the Ashes {{for the first}} time in twenty years, Johnson spent the winter of 1953 calling Australian rules {{football}} matches for local radio station 3AW and writing columns for The Argus newspaper. [...] Later that year, the Victorian Cricket Association appointed him to succeed the retired Hassett as captain of Victoria. [...] In the middle of the season, at a mutual friend's New Year's Eve party, Hassett approached Johnson to discuss his form. [...] Taking a confrontational approach, Hassett said to Johnson, [...] "The problem is that you <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> stuck in. [...] You're not trying." [...] When Johnson protested, Hassett continued [...] "If you have got any brains, you will start taking this game seriously. [...] Because if you do you will end up captaining Australia next year." ...|$|E
500|$|The Irish Republican Army (IRA) {{also had}} a bombing {{campaign}} ongoing, and in December 1975 Bond [...] "saturated" [...] the centre of London with plainclothes police officers. Four IRA members took two people hostage in Balcombe Street, following a police chase which involved a shoot out on 7 December. The terrorists called the police, in a call which was routed to Bond; who refused their demands of a plane to fly to Ireland, proclaiming that [...] "They are not going anywhere and they <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> any plane to Ireland. We {{are not going to}} make any deals at all." [...] The gunmen gave up on 12 December, their surrender sparking fears of reprisals, after what Bond called a [...] "rather humiliating episode," [...] Bond [...] "masterminded" [...] the operation to regain the hostages. He retired the following year, in 1976, and received the Order of the British Empire in the New Year's honours list. Upon his retirement in February 1976, he had served in the police for 30 years, full of [...] "exemplary conduct."

500|$|The Supreme Court {{upheld the}} {{constitutionality}} of Sections 4 and 5 in South Carolina v. Katzenbach (1966). However, in Shelby County v. Holder (2013), the Supreme Court ruled that Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights Act, which established the coverage formula that determined which jurisdictions were subject to preclearance, was no longer constitutional and exceeded Congress's enforcement authority under Section 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment. The Court declared that the Fifteenth Amendment [...] "commands {{that the right to}} vote shall not be denied or abridged on account of race or color, and it gives Congress the power to enforce that command. The Amendment is not designed to punish for the past; its purpose is to ensure a better future." [...] According to the Court, [...] "Regardless of how to look at the record no one can fairly say that it shows anything approaching the 'pervasive,' 'flagrant,' 'widespread,' and 'rampant' discrimination that faced Congress in 1965, and that clearly distinguished the covered jurisdictions {{from the rest of the}} nation." [...] In dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote, [...] "Throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>getting</b> wet." [...] While the preclearance provision itself was not struck down, it will continue to be inoperable unless Congress passes a new coverage formula.|$|E
