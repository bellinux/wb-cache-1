[...] This is another reason to quiet title after a successful adverse possession or adverse prescription: it clarifies the record of who should take action to preserve the <b>adverse</b> <b>title</b> or easement while evidence is still fresh.|$|E
50|$|The {{suit was}} brought for breach of {{covenant}} of warranty of title to a tract of land in Kansas. Plaintiff in error was defendant below. Its title was derived from grants of public land {{to aid in the}} construction of a railway to the Pacific. The tract was within the location of the railroad grants, but was excepted from those grants by reason of a homestead entry and possession. Subsequent to this entry and possession, the party so in possession took title from the railroad company, and the homestead entry was cancelled. The alleged paramount <b>adverse</b> <b>title</b> was derived from a patent from the United States issued on a homestead entry made subsequent to these proceedings. The Supreme Court of Kansas found that there was a breach of the warranty, and rendered judgment accordingly. This writ of error was brought to review that judgment.|$|E

50|$|Shortly {{before taking}} over the label, Johnson began editing a fanzine called Grim Humour, {{initially}} covering non-mainstream artists such as Big Black, Swans, Killing Joke, Lydia Lunch, Whitehouse and Sonic Youth. These often came with cassette or vinyl compilations (usually given FD catalogue numbers) with participants including the aforementioned Sonic Youth, Cindytalk, Ausgang, Con Demek and Portion Control. The fanzine ceased in the mid 1990s but Johnson has since launched a new <b>title,</b> <b>Adverse</b> Effect, which has been praised by Record Collector and Ptolemaic Terrascope, lasted four editions and now can be found as a blogspot and via the Fourth Dimension website.|$|R
2500|$|Almost 40 years later, on February 14, 1874, an Act of Congress was {{approved}} stating that [...] "the United States hereby release whatever title they have" [...] regarding Austin's former land (now located in Washington County, Missouri) [...] "to the heirs, legal representatives, or assigns of said Moses Austin, {{according to their}} respective interests therein, provided however that this act shall not affect nor impair the title which any settler or other person may have acquired <b>adverse</b> to the <b>title</b> of said Moses Austin to any portion of said land." [...] Bryan's heirs now brought an action for ejectment of Deane's successors in title, alleging (among other things) that Austin had not received complete title to his land from the Spanish government and thus {{he could not have}} mortgaged the land, which reverted to the possession of the United States and then passed to Bryan's heirs by operation of the Act of Congress.|$|R
5000|$|In 2008, due to {{the volume}} of adverse {{possession}} and boundary dispute cases throughout New York City, the New York State Legislature amended and limited the ability of land to be acquired by adverse possession. [...] Prior to the 2008 amendment, to acquire property by adverse possession, all that was required was a showing that the possession constituted an actual invasion of or infringement upon the owner’s rights. Approximately eight (8) years after the 2008 amendment, on June 30, 2016, the New York State Appellate Division, First Department (i.e., the appellate court covering the territory of Manhattan) determined the legal questions concerning the scope of rights acquired by adverse possession and how the First Department would treat claims of <b>adverse</b> possession where <b>title</b> had vested prior to 2008. [...] The Court specifically held that title to the adversely possessed property vested when the plaintiff [...] "Satisfied the requirement of the statute in effect at the relevant time." [...] In other words, if title had vested at some time [...] "after" [...] the 2008 amendment, a plaintiff would have to satisfy the adverse possession standards amended by the New York State Legislature in 2008; however, if title vested at some time [...] "before" [...] the 2008 amendment, a plaintiff would have lawfully acquired title to the disputed area by satisfying the pre-amendment standard for adverse possession. Hudson Square Hotel also resolved two often highly litigated issues in adverse possession cases where the air rights are more valuable than the underlying land itself: (a) [...] "where" [...] (i.e., in three-dimensional physical space) is an encroachment required in order for such encroachment to have any relevant operative effect or consequences under the law of adverse possession, and (b) [...] "what" [...] property rights are acquired {{as a result of}} title to the ground floor area (i.e., the land) vesting with the plaintiff. In Hudson Square Hotel the defendant argued that the plaintiff had only acquired title to the underlying land, but not the air rights, because the plaintiff never encroached above the two-story building. This argument was motivated, in part, {{by the fact that the}} zoning laws at the time permitted the owner of the land to build (i.e., develop) up to six (6) times the square footage of the ground floor area. For example, if the disputed area was 1,000 square feet, there would be 6,000 square feet of buildable square footage to potentially be won or lost by adverse possession. The Court clarified, [...] "It is the encroachment on the land ... that allows title to pass to the adverse possessor." [...] In other words, the plaintiff did not need to encroach upon all six stories in order to adversely possess the air rights above the land. The Court also held, [...] "With title to land come air rights." [...] In other words, by acquiring title to the land (i.e., ground floor area), the plaintiff also acquired ownership of the more valuable air rights that were derivative of title to the underlying land.|$|R
