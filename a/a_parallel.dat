5|$|Dataflow {{programming}} languages describe {{systems of}} operations on data streams, and {{the connections between}} the outputs of some operations and the inputs of others. These languages can be convenient for describing repetitive data processing tasks, in which the same acyclically-connected collection of operations is applied to many data items. They can be executed as <b>a</b> <b>parallel</b> algorithm in which each operation is performed by <b>a</b> <b>parallel</b> process as soon as another set of inputs becomes available to it.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> massively <b>parallel</b> {{processor}} array, {{also known}} as a multi purpose processor array (MPPA) is a type of integrated circuit which has <b>a</b> massively <b>parallel</b> array of hundreds or thousands of CPUs and RAM memories.

5|$|The eastern {{terminus}} of the Louisa Railroad {{was originally}} at Hanover Junction (now known as Doswell) with the RF Railroad. The charter of that line protected it from construction of <b>a</b> <b>parallel</b> competitor, but an act by the Virginia General Assembly in 1848 authorized {{the extension of}} the Louisa Railroad easterly through Hanover and Henrico Counties to reach Richmond. This act was protested by the RF for violating the earlier decree of the Assembly against <b>a</b> <b>parallel</b> competitor. The RF's claim was originally overturned by a Virginia State Court, which ruled that the Assembly retained the right to authorize construction of other railroads between Richmond and Fredericksburg, and that the original charter of the RF only applied to the transportation of passengers. The decision of the court was appealed and eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court in , which ruled in favor of the Louisa Railroad, upholding the state court's decision.|$|E
