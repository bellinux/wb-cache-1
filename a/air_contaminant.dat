The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess and describe ways in which organizational trust-building can be enhanced by identifying effective methods of gathering and sharing information related to occupational exposure to <b>air</b> <b>contaminants</b> at Spectro Alloys Corporation. Based on employee feedback and past air sampling data, the two major <b>air</b> <b>contaminants</b> at Spectro Alloys are hydrogen chloride and aluminum dust. For this study, the health hazards associated with aluminum and hydrogen chloride were researched.

5000|$|Cunninghamella echinulata is a fungal {{species in}} the genus Cunninghamella. It is an asexually {{reproducing}} fungus and a mesophile, preferring intermediate temperature ranges. C. echinulata is a common <b>air</b> <b>contaminant,</b> and is currently {{of interest to the}} biotechnology industry due to its ability to synthesize γ-linolenic acid as well as its capacity to bioconcentrate metals. This species is a soil saprotroph that forms rhizoids, preferring soils enriched in nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. It has been reported occasionally an agent of mucormycosis following the inhalation of fungal spores. Czapek's agar is a suitable growth medium for the propagation of C. echinulata.|$|E
50|$|Cunninghamella echinulata is a saprotrophic {{resident}} of the soils in warmer regions of the world, particularly those enriched with NPK fertilizers (Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium). It has been reported from both cultivated and uncultivated soils, including soils from greenhouses and forests in the mediterranean and subtropical zones but {{is thought to be}} comparatively rare in temperate zones. Soil depth and pH are not considered to be strongly influential on the growth properties of this fungus in vivo. This species is able to cause rot in foods such as Kola nuts and is a common <b>air</b> <b>contaminant.</b> It can be parasitized by other fungi including species of Piptocephalis, and Trichoderma viride. Additionally, its growth is inhibited in vitro by the fungus, Memnoniella echinata.|$|E
50|$|An {{impinger}} {{system is}} a device in which particles are removed by impacting the aerosol particles into a liquid. Modular media type units combine a variety of specific filter modules in one unit. These systems can provide solutions to many <b>air</b> <b>contaminant</b> problems. A typical system incorporates a series of disposable or cleanable pre-filters, a disposable vee-bag or cartridge filter. HEPA or carbon final filter modules can also be added. Various models are available, including free-hanging or ducted installations, vertical or horizontal mounting, and fixed or portable configurations. Filter cartridges are made out {{of a variety of}} synthetic fibers and are capable of collecting sub-micrometre particles without creating an excessive pressure drop in the system. Filter cartridges require periodic cleaning.|$|E

40|$|In 1989, {{after almost}} two decades of substance-by-substance {{standard}} setting, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) promulgated its <b>Air</b> <b>Contaminants</b> Standard, imposing new exposure limits for 376 toxic substances encountered in U. S. industry. In marked contrast to earlier regulations, the <b>Air</b> <b>Contaminants</b> Standard has generated relatively little industry opposition. This paper analyzes the standard {{in the context of}} the twenty-year debate over the appropriate role for technological feasibility and economic compliance costs in occupational health policy. The political feasibility of the new standard is traced to OSHA's abandonment of "technology forcing" in favor of reliance on "off-the-shelf" technologies already in use in major firms. While important as an embodiment of OSHA's new "generic" approach to regulation, the <b>Air</b> <b>Contaminants</b> Standard cannot serve as a model for future occupational health policy, due to its reliance on informal, closed-door mechanisms for establishing regulatory priorities and permissible exposure limits...|$|R

50|$|Diesel exhaust {{particulate}} matter (PM) {{was identified as}} a toxic <b>air</b> <b>contaminant</b> by the Air Resources Board in 1998 after study results showed its potential to cause cancer, premature death, and other health problems. Two years later, in September 2000, the Air Resources Board adopted the Risk Reduction Plan to Reduce Particulate Matter Emissions from Diesel-Fueled Engines and Vehicles which committed to establish retrofit requirements for in-use diesel vehicles to reduce diesel {{particulate matter}} 75 percent by 2010 and 85 percent by 2020. In 2007 the Air Resources Board then adopted a State Implementation Plan (SIP) which requires heavy-duty in-use diesel trucks operating in the South Coast and San Joaquin Valley to be retrofitted to meet model year 2007 emission levels by 2014 and 2017, respectively. The State Implementation Plan was implemented to help California's Air Quality Control Regions (AQCR) meet the requirements of the Federal Clean Air Act and also aims to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions (NOx) and ozone in the state. This regulation is the next step to help the Air Resources Board achieve their goal to reduce diesel particulate matter.|$|E
50|$|While overall {{pollution}} {{levels have}} dropped, {{it was found}} that oil sands pollution has increased by 20% since 2009. According to a 2009 study, Alberta’s oil sands are one of the major causes of air pollution in Canada. Tar sands facilities were found to be among the top four highest polluters of volatile organic compounds (VOCs)- a major <b>air</b> <b>contaminant.</b> VOCs and other air contaminants are set to increase in the future as a result of continued output from the oil sands. Oil sands pollution is not only set to increase VOCs, but also, acid rain. Acid rain is rain that has been contaminated by airborne chemicals, making it acidic. Two major causes of acid rain are sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. Acid rain can cause damage to soil, water, wildlife, plants and buildings. Additionally, the airborne particles that cause acid rain can also contribute to smog. In recent years {{progress has been made in}} reducing acid rain, however, Alberta's oil sands may soon set back this progress.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationships}} between {{indoor and outdoor}} levels of various <b>air</b> <b>contaminants</b> (NO, NO 2, SO 2 and O- 3) in 10 non-smoking residential buildings were discussed in this paper. Levels of these four <b>air</b> <b>contaminants</b> from 10 domestic units in Hong Kong were obtained using passive samplers. An integral approach {{was applied to the}} mass balance equation and with some approximations, the source and sink, strengths of the <b>air</b> <b>contaminants</b> were estimated. It has been found that the average ratios of the indoor and outdoor levels of NO, NO 2, SO 2 and O- 3 were 0. 98 (S. D. = 0. 19), 0. 79 (S. D. = 0. 30), 1. 01 (S. D. = 0. 78) and 0. 40 (S. D = 0. 31), respectively. The results also indicated that the residential buildings in Hong Kong acted as sinks for these four <b>air</b> <b>contaminants</b> on average. The average sink strengths of NO, NO 2, SO 2 and O- 3 were 3. 01, 0. 42, 0. 32 and 1. 39 mg/h respectively. The deposition velocity of ozone onto wall surfaces in the buildings was estimated to be 0. 0225 cm/s. Comparison of the measured data to the newly developed indoor air quality guidance notes in Hong Kong indicated that the nitrogen oxides level needed some concern while the sulphur dioxide and ozone levels were low in the indoor residential environment.

40|$|The {{preponderance}} of scientific {{studies on the}} effects of <b>air</b> <b>contaminants</b> and emissions on animal health has been conducted in and around swine facilities. <b>Air</b> <b>contaminants</b> can be divided into gases, particulates, bioaerosols, and toxic microbial by-products. Excess ammonia has been associated with lowered average number of pigs weaned, arthritis, porcine stress syndrome, muscle lesions, abscesses, and liver ascarid scars. Particulates (dust) have been related to reduced growth in growing pigs and turbinate pathology. Bioaerosols have been associated with lowered feed efficiency, decreased growth, and increased morbidity and mortality due to respiratory disease and abscesses. There are few scientific studies regarding the health effects and productivity problems of <b>air</b> <b>contaminants</b> on cattle and other livestock. Ammonia and hydrogen sulfide are the two most important inorganic gases affecting the respiratory system of cattle raised in confinement facilities.
