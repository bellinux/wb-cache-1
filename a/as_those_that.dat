The largest protest occurred on election night; reporters for the Associated Press estimated that approximately 10,000 people turned out. Election observers from the Russia-led Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) differed on the Belarusian election.|$|E

Her {{existence}} and relation to Nyuserre are attested by a fragmentary alabaster statuette of her discovered in the valley temple of Nyuserre's pyramid complex.

5|$|Recent extinctions can be {{directly}} attributable to human influences. The IUCN characterizes 'recent' extinction <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> have occurred past the cut-off point of 1500, and around 80 mammal species have gone extinct since that time and 2015. Some species, such as the Père David's deer are extinct in the wild, and survive solely in captive populations. Other species, such as the Florida panther, are ecologically extinct, surviving in such low numbers that they essentially have {{no impact on the}} ecosystem. Other populations are only locally extinct (extirpated), still existing elsewhere, but reduced in distribution, as with the extinction of gray whales in the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Submarine springs found {{along the}} coast of Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula produce water with a {{naturally}} low pH (relatively high acidity) providing conditions similar to those expected to become widespread as the oceans absorb carbon dioxide.

5|$|The ascetic, Vedic and Tantric sub-traditions {{related to}} Shiva, such <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> became ascetic warriors during the Islamic rule period of India, {{celebrate}} the Kumbha Mela festival.

The biggest is in Prayaga (renamed Allahabad during the Mughal rule era), where millions of Hindus of different traditions gather at the confluence of rivers Ganges and Yamuna. In the Hindu tradition, the Shiva-linked ascetic warriors (Nagas) get the honor of starting the event by entering the sangam first for bathing and prayers.|$|E
5|$|The {{deep vacuum}} of space could make it an {{attractive}} environment for certain industrial processes, such <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> require ultraclean surfaces. However, like asteroid mining, space manufacturing requires a significant investment with little prospect of an immediate return. An {{important factor in the}} total expense is the high cost of placing mass into Earth orbit: $– per kg in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to a 2006 estimate. Proposed concepts for addressing this issue include non-rocket spacelaunch, momentum exchange tethers, and space elevators.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} sector in Kuala Terengganu is mostly {{made up of}} small-scale manufacturing industries such as the traditional textile making, local food industries, arts and craft factories, and agriculture, with most of them centred around residential areas or villages.

Factories such <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> produce bricks or timber products are located further away from the main city areas.

5|$|While the {{development}} of wings in insects is clearly defined in those {{who are members of}} Endopterygota, which undergo complete metamorphosis; in these species, the wing develops while in the pupal stage of the insects life cycle. However, insects that undergo incomplete metamorphosis do not have a pupal stage, therefore they must have a different wing morphogenesis. Insects such <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> are hemimetabolic have wings that start out as buds, which are found underneath the exoskeleton, and do not become exposed until the last instar of the nymph.|$|E
5|$|William Lane Craig criticised Oppy's {{study as}} too vague for useful classification. Craig argued that an {{argument}} can be classified as ontological if it attempts to deduce the existence of God, along with other necessary truths, from his definition. He suggested that proponents of ontological arguments would claim that, if one fully understood the concept of God, one must accept his existence. William L. Rowe defined ontological arguments <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> start from the definition of God and, using only a priori principles, conclude with God's existence.|$|E

5|$|A 2007–2008 {{survey of}} over 19% of all colonies {{revealed}} {{a total loss}} of 35.8%.

The 37.9% of operations that reported having at least some of their colonies die with a complete lack of bees had a total loss of 40.8% of colonies compared to the 17.1% loss reported by beekeepers without this symptom. Large operations {{were more likely to have}} this symptom, suggesting a contagious condition may be a causal factor. About 60% of all colonies that were reported dead in this survey died without the presence of dead bees in the hive, thus possibly suffered from CCD.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} caldera-forming eruption occurred about 160,000 years ago. It {{formed the}} relatively small caldera that contains the West Thumb of Yellowstone Lake. Since the last supereruption, a series of smaller eruptive cycles between 640,000 and 70,000years ago, has nearly filled in the Yellowstone Caldera with 80 different eruptions of rhyolitic lavas such <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> {{can be seen at}} Obsidian Cliffs and basaltic lavas which can be viewed at Sheepeater Cliff. Lava strata are most easily seen at the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone, where the Yellowstone River continues to carve into the ancient lava flows. The canyon is a classic V-shaped valley, indicative of river-type erosion rather than erosion caused by glaciation.|$|E
5|$|Eruptive {{activity}} in the Mount Cayley volcanic field is typical of past volcanism elsewhere in the Garibaldi Belt. Large earthquakes would occur under the volcanic field weeks to years in advance as molten rock intrudes through the Earth's rocky lithosphere. The extent of earthquakes and the local seismographs in this region would warn the Geological Survey of Canada and possibly cause an upgrade in monitoring. While molten rock breaks through the crust, {{the size of the}} volcano vulnerable to an eruption would probably swell and the area would rupture, creating much more hydrothermal activity at the regional hot springs and the formation of new springs or fumaroles. Small and probably significant rock avalanches may result and could dam the nearby Squamish River for a limited amount of time, such <b>as</b> <b>those</b> <b>that</b> occurred in the past without seismic activity and deformation related to magmatic activity. At some point the subsurface magma will produce phreatic eruptions and lahars. At this time Highway 99 would be out of service and the residents of Squamish would have to travel away from the eruptive zone.|$|E
40|$|Oddballs—low-probability, attention-capturing {{expectancy}} violations—are {{judged as}} longer than non-oddballs, but are temporal intervals that contain oddballs judged <b>as</b> longer than <b>those</b> <b>that</b> do not? In 2 experiments, we tested competing model predictions using a novel and covert measure of subjective duration—musical imagery reproduction. Participants verbally estimated and reproduced with musical imagery repeated, coherent, or incoherent familiar or unfamiliar chord sequences (3. 5 s, 7 s, or 12 s) that either {{did or did}} not contain dynamic auditory oddballs. Participants verbally estimated repeated chord sequences that contained oddballs <b>as</b> shorter than <b>those</b> <b>that</b> did not, but reproduced with musical imagery incoherent chord sequences that contained oddballs <b>as</b> longer than <b>those</b> <b>that</b> did not. These findings suggest that (a) intervals that contain attention-capturing, high-priority events are judged <b>as</b> shorter than <b>those</b> <b>that</b> do not when people are engaged in relatively temporal information processing, but <b>as</b> longer than <b>those</b> <b>that</b> do not when people are engaged in relatively nontemporal information processing, and (b) temporal and nontemporal information processing are interdependent. These results support the resource allocation model of short interval time estimation. We discuss implications for attention- and memory-based models, dynamic attending theory, and the ongoing debate about the mechanisms driving the temporal oddball illusion...|$|R
