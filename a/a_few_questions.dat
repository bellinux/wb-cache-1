5|$|While Manhattan {{is being}} evacuated, a Japanese man named Kunihiko Maeda manages {{to sneak into}} the city, {{witnessing}} a police officer combust into flames in the process. Aya awakens in an apartment in SoHo, with Daniel and Maeda at her side. Maeda reveals the origins of Eve: A scientist tried to culture the cells of his wife after {{she was involved in}} a car accident, and the mitochondria in her cells took over her body. Maeda believes that Eve may be trying to give birth to an “Ultimate Being”. The next day, the three go to see Dr. Klamp again. After examining cell samples from that of Eve and Aya's, Maeda concludes that based on selfish gene theory, Aya and Eve's mitochondria are in an evolutionary race for survival. Dr. Klamp suddenly appears and asks <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions</b> of Aya in a hostile manner. The three leave and head for the St. Francis Hospital, where Maeda thinks Eve may try to get sperm for the Ultimate Being. When they arrive, they find that Eve is already there. Eve takes the sperm and escapes.|$|E

25|$|Richter {{parachute}}d into Britain on {{the early}} morning of 12 May 1941, landing near London Colney north of London. Richter quickly hid his parachute and equipment {{and spent the next}} few days and nights hiding in the forest, too nervous to travel to London. When Richter eventually came out of hiding, he was approached by a lorry driver who asked Richter for directions. Unable to give directions, Richter aroused the suspicions of the lorry driver who drove a short distance and reported the strange foreigner to a police officer. The police officer found Richter and, after examining his papers and asking him <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions,</b> decided to take Richter to the local police station. Richter's identity papers, in the name of Fred Snyder, were clearly forged and did not match the expired Czechoslovak passport in his possession (which was in his own name). Richter was sent to Camp 020 where he was interrogated by officers of MI5. Richter was a difficult agent to break and it was only when he was confronted with fellow spy Josef Jakobs that Richter began to crack. Richter revealed the true purpose of his mission, to check up on agent Wulf Schmidt.|$|E

500|$|Reviews were positive, {{though most}} critics {{found that the}} {{character}} of Eko was killed too soon in the show. Writing for Zap2it, Rick Porter said that while [...] "The Cost of Living" [...] was the best episode of season 3 thus far with [...] "an illuminating flashback, some heavy island juju and a nice mix of the campers and the Others", the death of Eko removed from Lost [...] "one of its most compelling characters and best actors, which just flat-out sucks." [...] Kristin dos Santos of E! Online called Mr. Eko [...] "the best character of the show", and was therefore very disappointed with his death. Christine Fenno of Entertainment Weekly stated that she would miss Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, and found Juliet's message {{to be the best}} part of the episode, that like the rest of season three [...] "answered <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions</b> (whose tumor?), raised <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions</b> (who's the eye-patch guy?), and ignored many long-standing questions (how did Yemi and Eko crash on the same island?)." ...|$|E

[...] Engine 145 reviewer Brady Vercher rated it three stars out of five, praising Walker's vocal performance but saying that the song selection [...] "seemed to be lacking in everything but fluff." [...] Country Standard Time reviewer Jeffrey B. Remz wrote that Walker showed [...] "a very pleasant country voice with {{a good sense of}} emotion" [...] and that the production was more country-sounding than most mainstream acts, but said that it had several [...] "generic" [...] songs.|$|E

500|$|In {{the second}} segment, Springer reveals the second piece of baggage, {{contained}} in the medium-sized suitcase. The suitcases are placed in random order, so the central character does not know to whom each belongs. The three contestants are placed {{on the other side}} of the stage, along with the central contestant. Only the three contestants know which piece of baggage belongs to whom. The main contestant chooses the piece of baggage which is the [...] "deal breaker" [...] (i.e., the one secret that they cannot accept). After stating this, the contestants then return to the other side of the stage and reveal which suitcase belongs to them. The person who claims the deal breaker baggage is immediately eliminated, and later backstage reveals the largest piece of baggage that would have been shown in the final round. The central contestant and two remaining contestants discuss the secrets in the medium pieces of baggage; the two contestants then plead their cases as to why they should be the central contestant's choice. Springer then asks the two remaining contestants, one at a time, <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions</b> (usually five or six each) about their personal lives.|$|E

There are more than <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>questions</b> raised that will have us eagerly tuning in when the show returns in the fall." [...] Aubry D'Arminio praised the season, but she also showed disapproval at what she felt was a lack of use for some of The Offices supporting cast in the episodes directly following the Writers' Strike, saying [...] "I just feel a bit sad that, minus Leslie David Baker's Stanley, these excellent actors/characters haven't been highlighted nearly enough since the series' return in April." [...] In a comprehensive review of the fourth season DVD, IGN reviewers Travis Fickett and Phil Pirrello both believed [...] "this season {{to be one of the}} show's best, [...] that 14 episodes across four discs gives way to crowding, especially when the season tries to tackle Jim and Pam dating, Angela and Dwight breaking up, Andy and Angela dating by way of awkward silence, Michael and Jan breaking up, Toby leaving the office and a new love interest for Michael joining the cast." [...] Fickett and Pirrello gave the season a total score of 8 out of 10.|$|E

500|$|In the Battle of Long Island on August 27, 1776, British forces {{successfully}} occupied western Long Island (modern Brooklyn), compelling Washington {{to withdraw}} his army to Manhattan.

[...] During the battle they had captured several high-ranking Continental Army officers, including Major General John Sullivan. [...] The Howes managed to convince Sullivan that a conference with members of the Continental Congress might yield fruit, and released him on parole to deliver a message to the Congress in Philadelphia, proposing an informal meeting to discuss ending the armed conflict between Britain and its rebellious colonies. [...] After Sullivan's speech to Congress, John Adams cynically commented on this diplomatic attempt, calling Sullivan a [...] "decoy-duck" [...] and accusing the British of sending Sullivan [...] "to seduce us into a renunciation of our independence"; others noted that it appeared to be an attempt to blame Congress for prolonging the war. [...] The Congress did however agree to send three of its members – Adams, Benjamin Franklin and Edward Rutledge – to a conference with Lord Howe. [...] They were instructed [...] "to ask <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>Questions</b> and take [...] Answers", but had no further authority. [...] When Howe learned of the committee's limited authority, he briefly considered calling the meeting off, but decided to proceed after discussion with his brother.
