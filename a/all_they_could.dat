William Penney and Group Captain Leonard Cheshire were sent to Tinian, but found that LeMay would not let them accompany the mission. <b>All</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> do was send a strongly worded signal back to Wilson.|$|E
5|$|Casualties were {{cared for}} by medical officers, {{stretcher}} bearers, camel drivers and sand-cart drivers who worked tirelessly, often in the firing line, covering enormous distances in difficult conditions and doing <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> to relieve {{the suffering of the}} wounded. The casualties were transported on cacolets on camels or in sand-carts back to the field ambulances, as the heavy sand made it impossible to use motor- or horse-drawn ambulances. Between 4 and 9 August, the Anzac Mounted Division's five field ambulances brought in 1,314 patients, including 180 enemy wounded.|$|E

5|$|On November 4, Wayne ordered Scott's militiamen {{to destroy}} a nearby Delaware village. Still resentful and distrustful of federal {{officers}} and aware that Wayne would not launch a major offensive so close to winter, the men were not enthusiastic about the mission, which many of them considered trivial. That night, 501 of them deserted their camp, though Wayne noted in his report that he believed Scott and his officers had done <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> do to prevent the desertions. Scott attempted to continue the mission with his remaining men, but inclement weather prevented him from conducting a major offensive. Ultimately, the men were only able to disperse a small hunting camp before continuing on to Fort Washington and mustering out on November 10. Wayne ordered Scott to return with a full quota of troops after the winter.|$|E
5|$|Foiled at the AOC, boycott advocates {{turned to}} the AAU, hoping that the {{athletics}} organization, though also led by Brundage, would refuse to certify athletes for Berlin. Although no vote took place on a boycott at the AAU's December 1934 meeting, Brundage did not seek re-election, and delegates elected Judge Jeremiah T. Mahoney as the new president, to take office in 1935. Although pro-boycott activities briefly fell into a lull, renewed Nazi brutality against the Jews in June 1935 sparked a resurgence, and converted Mahoney to the pro-boycott cause. In October, Baillet-Latour wrote to the three American IOC members: William May Garland, Charles Sherrill, and Ernest Lee Jahncke, asking them to do <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> to ensure a US team was sent to Germany. Garland and Sherrill agreed; Jahncke, however, refused, stating {{that he would be}} supporting the boycott. Brundage, at Baillet-Latour's request, took the lead in the anti-boycott campaign. Matters came to a head at the AAU convention in December 1935. Brundage's forces won the key votes, and the AAU approved sending a team to Berlin, specifying that this did not mean it supported the Nazis. In victory, Brundage was not magnanimous, demanding the resignation of opponents. Although not all quit, Mahoney did.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the catastrophic flooding in Monterrey, an appeal {{was made to}} the United States and other nations for aid. Many residents and visitors in the city did <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> to help rescue those trapped in the flood waters {{and take care of}} the homeless. According to the New York Times, one person rescued 30 people stranded in flood waters. Numerous rescue operations were undertaken during the flood, saving many lives. However, survivors faced another issue after losing their homes: lack of food. Food was unavailable to most residents in the wake of the storm until August31 when the first relief supplies arrived. Even then, most only received a small amount of bread and beans. Once the flood along the Santa Catarina River receded, searches were conducted to attempt to locate the bodies of victims. However, reports indicated that the river bed was similar to quicksand and most bodies on it were likely underground.|$|E

5|$|In early 1880 Hicks Beach {{forwarded}} {{a scheme}} for South African federation to the Cape Parliament. Kruger travelled to the Cape to agitate against the proposals alongside Joubert and Jorissen; {{by the time}} they arrived the Liberals had won an election victory in Britain and Gladstone was Prime Minister. In Cape Town, Paarl and elsewhere Kruger lobbied vigorously against the annexation and won much sympathy. Davenport suggests that this contributed to the federation plan's withdrawal, which in turn weakened the British resolve to keep the Transvaal. Kruger and Joubert wrote to Gladstone asking him to restore the South African Republic's independence, but to their astonishment the Prime Minister replied in June 1880 that he feared withdrawing from the Transvaal might lead to chaos across South Africa. Kruger concluded that they had done <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> to try to regain independence peacefully, and over the following months the Transvaal burghers prepared for rebellion. Wolseley was replaced as Governor and High Commissioner by Sir George Pomeroy Colley.|$|E

25|$|God's gift of freedom.

Most of <b>all,</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> form their own churches, associations, and conventions. These institutions offered self-help and racial uplift, and provided places where the gospel of liberation could be proclaimed. As a result, black preachers continued to insist that God would protect and help him; God would be their rock in a stormy land.|$|E
25|$|The city, provincial, {{and federal}} police were all {{standing}} by during the strike, {{along with several}} hundred special constables because, the government claimed, {{it was part of}} a larger plot on the part of the Communists, on orders from Moscow, to spark a general strike in Vancouver. Another strike was developing amongst longshoremen, whose union was also under WUL leadership, and the government feared that the two might merge into one large strike, which might spread. The relief camp strikers, however, decided that they had accomplished <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> in Vancouver, and voted to take their grievances to Ottawa in what became the more famous On-to-Ottawa Trek.|$|E

25|$|By mid-1975, {{the band}} had become disillusioned with {{their lack of}} success in America. Feeling that they were {{becoming}} stale and had achieved <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> in Europe, Slade decided to a make a permanent move to the States and try to build a solid reputation from live performances; {{just as they had}} previously done in the UK. According to the Slade Fan Club newsletter of August and September 1975, the band took twelve tons of equipment, worth approximately £45,000 at the time. Throughout the remainder of 1975 and 1976, Slade toured the US, often with other bands such as Aerosmith, ZZ Top and Black Sabbath, only returning to the UK for TV performances of new singles.|$|E
25|$|The Fourth Crusade in {{agreement}} for funds attempted {{to help the}} deposed emperor Alexius IV regain his throne. After taking Constantinople, returning Alexius IV to the throne, the revolt against and death of Alexius IV, the Crusaders were left without payment. On 12 April 1204, the crusaders inflicted a severe sacking on Constantinople for three days, during which many ancient and medieval Roman and Greek works were either stolen or destroyed. Despite their oaths {{and the threat of}} excommunication, the Crusaders ruthlessly and systematically violated the city's holy sanctuaries, destroying, defiling, or stealing <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> lay hands on; nothing was spared. It was said that the total amount looted from Constantinople was about 900,000 silver marks. The Venetians received 150,000 silver marks that was their due, while the Crusaders received 50,000 silver marks. A further 100,000 silver marks were divided evenly up between the Crusaders and Venetians. The remaining 500,000 silver marks were secretly kept back by many Crusader knights.|$|E
25|$|On one occasion, {{they entered}} the Hudson's Bay Company Department Store to {{publicize}} their grievances to shoppers. The police came to evict the men, and a bloody clash ensued. After that incident, the unemployed congregated at Victory Square Park, where McGeer came and read the Riot Act. The camp strikers left the city after two months to begin the On-to-Ottawa Trek. They felt they accomplished <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> in Vancouver and voted to take their grievances directly to Prime Minister R. B. Bennett. Shortly before the trekkers left, another Communist-led strike broke out on the waterfront, culminating with another bloody clash that {{became known as the}} Battle of Ballantyne Pier. Gerry McGeer treated these protests not as strikes, but as an attempted Bolshevik uprising. Although he came from a background as an iron molder and union representative, he came to be seen as an enemy of organized labour because of these events.|$|E

25|$|The salmon {{fisheries}} of the Columbia River are now but {{a fraction}} of what they were twenty-five years ago, and what they would be now if the United States Government had taken complete charge of them by intervening between Oregon and Washington. During these twenty-five years the fishermen of each State have naturally tried to take <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> get, and the two legislatures {{have never been able to}} agree on joint action of any kind adequate in degree for the protection of the fisheries. At the moment the fishing on the Oregon side is practically closed, while there is no limit on the Washington side of any kind, and no one can tell what the courts will decide as to the very statutes under which this action and non-action result. Meanwhile very few salmon reach the spawning grounds, and probably four years hence the fisheries will amount to nothing; and this comes from a struggle between the associated, or gill-net, fishermen on the one hand, and the owners of the fishing wheels up the river.|$|E
25|$|Singles {{were taken}} to end the over, but McGrath was to bowl the last over of the game, with England still needing ten to win. Things got easier for England when McGrath overstepped with the first ball of the over, Gough making contact and running the single to cut the target by two – the no-ball for {{overstepping}} and the run single – and the no-ball meant McGrath still had to bowl six balls in the over. Giles then played and missed, before hitting a single, and then Gough drove the two next balls to cover for two. Suddenly, England only needed three off two – and were, incredibly, in a winning position again. But Gough's next shot was right back to McGrath, who took it up well and tossed it at the stumps, running out Gough and meaning that McGrath would bowl to Ashley Giles – and England still required three to win. The ball hit Giles' pads, ran away down the off side, and Giles and Harmison ran <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> to scamper two leg byes – and tie the game.|$|E
25|$|One last {{attempt to}} capture Moscow {{was made on}} 2 December, but lack of fuel and {{ammunition}} and increasingly stiff resistance prevented its success. By this time, the Soviet air forces had gained air superiority. By 5 December, when the counteroffensive drove Army Group Centre back, they could muster 1,376 aircraft against just 600 German. The Germans possessed just 487 fighters (200 serviceable) on the entire Eastern Front. There were 674 Soviet fighters (480 serviceable) on the Moscow front. When the Soviet offensive began it quickly gained ground. German morale sank and Army Group Centre, overstretched and exhausted, was threatened with collapse. Richthofen's forces, despite enemy air superiority, did <b>all</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> to blunt the attack. The effectiveness and determination of German air units improved {{the morale of the}} army. Concentrating aviation against Soviet ground forces, the Luftwaffe delivered a series of attacks that took the wind out of the Soviet offensive within two weeks. Richthofen's forces bore the main burden of the air defence against the Soviet attack, and had been reinforced with four Kampfgruppen. Hitler had forbidden a retreat, and Richthofen endorsed this view. His refusal to give ground and his tenacity saw him become one of Hitler's favourites. Hitler gave him a further five transport groups to keep his Corps effective. Fliegerkorp VIII would stay on the front until April 1942, fighting a series of Soviet counter offensives.|$|E
