25|$|An almost {{exhausted}} Swift (Richmond’s no.15; and, as always, {{with the}} 5 askew), with great anticipation, leapt high {{in front of}} Wade and palmed the ball away to his right from {{in front of the}} pack. He raced back towards the goal square, just in time to intercept a kick from Colin Eales and, to add insult to injury, ran across the face of goal, bounced the ball, with Wade in hot pursuit, <b>and</b> <b>calmly</b> passed the ball to John Perry.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, Bittaker {{was arrested}} for assault with attempt to commit murder. This charge arose from an {{incident}} in which he stabbed a young supermarket clerk named Gary Louie following a confrontation in a supermarket parking lot: Louie had observed Bittaker steal a steak from the supermarket in which he (Louie) worked. Upon observing Bittaker's actions, Louie had followed Bittaker into the car park <b>and</b> <b>calmly</b> asked him whether he had forgotten to pay for anything. In response to this question, Bittaker stabbed Louie once in the chest, narrowly missing his heart. Bittaker attempted to flee {{the scene of the}} stabbing, but was restrained by two of Louie's fellow employees.|$|E
25|$|In early March 1912, {{along with}} over 100 others Allan {{participated in a}} window smashing protest in central London. The women {{secreted}} large stones and hammers under their skirts and, once in position, in a coordinated action they destroyed shop windows in Regent Street, Oxford Street, and the vicinity. Following this, the women patiently <b>and</b> <b>calmly</b> waited {{for the police to}} arrive. While police attention was diverted elsewhere by the protests, Emmeline Pankhurst and three others managed to get close enough to 10 Downing Street to throw stones through four of its windows. In the aftermath, along with many of her associates Allan was arrested, tried, and sentenced to four months in Holloway Prison.|$|E

25|$|Athy {{had to wait}} 24 {{years before}} {{reaching}} the summit of Kildare Senior Football once again. On 9 October 2011 in St Conleths Park Newbridge Michael Foley captained a young Athy side to victory against Carbury with a final score of 2.11 to 2.07. Athy scored 2–5 in the opening 15 minutes and two points in the closing four minutes but managed just four points in between, a period during which Carbury accumulated 2–4. Indeed, when Daryl O'Brien rasped home Carbury's second goal in the 57th minute {{to cut the deficit}} to two points, it looked as if they might have timed their run to perfection. The next score was crucial and it went Athy's way as Man of the Match Cian Reynolds held his nerve <b>and</b> <b>calmly</b> pointed a free.|$|E
25|$|Cárdenas {{and his men}} intercepted and {{surrounded}} the vehicle on a public street and demanded for the informant to be released to him. According to the two agents, the Gulf Cartel sicarios outnumbered and outgunned them. Their only way out was to talk their way out.

Cárdenas pounded the Ford Bronco <b>and</b> <b>calmly</b> asked for the informant. Fuentes flashed his FBI badge, giving Cárdenas a smile.

After surging out of midfield and finding Flavio Amado with a pinpoint pass, the mercurial playmaker latched on to the Angolan's return ball <b>and</b> <b>calmly</b> slotted the ball past Mexican goalkeeper for his third goal of the tournament. Al-Ahly won the third place, after Aboutrika lifted his team to an unprecedented result for the Egyptian club or any African outfit.

25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} while serving as Commanding Officer, Company K, Third Battalion, Fourth Marines, Third Marines, Third Marine Division, in the Republic of Vietnam from 15 to July 18, 1966. On July 15, during Operation HASTINGS, Company K was landed in an enemy infested jungle area to establish a blocking position at a major enemy trail network. Shortly after landing, the company encountered a reinforced enemy platoon in a well organized, defensive position. Major (then Captain) Modrzejewski led his men in the successful seizure of the enemy redoubt, which contained large quantities of ammunition and supplies. That evening a numerically superior enemy force counterattacked in an effort to retake the vital supply area, thus setting the pattern of activity for the next two and one-half days. In the first series of attacks, the enemy assaulted repeatedly in overwhelming numbers but each time was repulsed by the gallant Marines. The second night the enemy struck in battalion strength, and Major Modrzejewski was wounded in this intensive action which was fought at close quarters. Although exposed to enemy fire, and despite his painful wounds, he crawled 200 meters to provide critically needed ammunition to an exposed element of his command and was constantly present wherever the fighting was heaviest. Despite numerous casualties, a dwindling supply of ammunition and the knowledge that they were surrounded, he skillfully directed artillery fire to within a few meters of his position and courageously inspired the efforts of his company in repelling the aggressive enemy attack. On July 18, Company K was attacked by a regimental size enemy force. Although his unit was outnumbered and weakened by the previous fighting, Major Modrzejewski reorganized his men <b>and</b> <b>calmly</b> moved among them to encourage and direct their efforts to heroic limits as they fought to overcome the vicious enemy onslaught. Again he called in air and artillery strikes at close range with devastating effect on the enemy, which together with the bold and determined fighting of the men of Company K, repulsed the fanatical attack of the larger North Vietnamese force. His unparalleled personal heroism and indomitable leadership inspired his men to a significant victory over the enemy force and reflected great credit upon himself, the Marine Corps and the United States Naval Service.|$|E

Each time the guards checked on him, {{he was standing}} or kneeling {{in the middle of}} the cell and looking calmly at those who entered. [...] After two weeks of dehydration and starvation, only Kolbe remained alive. “The guards wanted the bunker emptied, so they gave Kolbe a lethal injection of carbolic acid. Kolbe is said to have raised his left arm <b>and</b> <b>calmly</b> waited for the deadly injection. His remains were cremated on 15 August, the feast day of the Assumption of Mary.|$|E

[...] Leading the 1st Regiment (Canajoharie district), Colonel Ebenezer Cox was shot off his horse and killed in the first volley. [...] Herkimer turned his horse to see the action, and was very shortly thereafter struck by a ball, which shattered his leg and killed the horse. [...] He was carried by several of his officers to a beech tree, where his men urged him to retire from further danger.

500|$|Although a {{male voice}} actor was sought for the Japanese {{adaptation}} of the Naruto role, the actress Junko Takeuchi was chosen instead over many male applicants. Before recording the first episode, Takeuchi noticed several lines from the script that ended with exclamation marks, which helped her to define Naruto's voice. She noted difficulties in transitioning from the young Naruto to the older Naruto in the animated adaptation of Part II. She had to record the first episode of Part II when Naruto's character was older and more mature only one week after voicing the younger, immature character. Nine years after first voicing the character, while still finding it tough to voice Naruto, Takeuchi's opinion of him changed with her feeling he was [...] "a very reliable young man". She admired his ability to prioritize <b>and</b> <b>calmly</b> make important decisions, and believes these traits will inspire viewers worldwide.|$|E

However, in contrast with Muir, he views the sequences set inside Altares during the descent as [...] "a bit of a hoot", directing particular criticism at the actors' exaggerated gesticulations. Commenting that the plot contains [...] "plenty of wonky pseudo-science and insanely improbable coincidences", Mills also recalls his fascination at [...] "how 'British'... the characters , facing each new peril with remarkable calm and 'stiff upper lip' stoicism. By the time they're caught in the clutches of the ominous black hole, they're apparently so resigned to being jerked around by the universe that they just hold hands <b>and</b> <b>calmly</b> await their fate." ...|$|E

After several minutes, medical attendants arrived and lifted Kennedy onto a stretcher, prompting him to whisper, [...] "Don't lift me..." [...] which were to become his last words. He lost consciousness shortly thereafter. Kennedy was taken a mile away to Central Receiving Hospital, where he arrived near death. One doctor slapped his face, calling, [...] "Bob, Bob", while another doctor manually massaged Kennedy's heart. After obtaining a good heartbeat, doctors handed a stethoscope to Ethel so she could hear her husband's heart beating, much to her relief.|$|E

Jim Carroll of The Irish Times found the song to be proof of Oh Land's [...] "efforts {{to find new}} ground"; he also praised the track for containing [...] "timeless drama" [...] and recommended that readers of his column download the track. James Christopher Monger from AllMusic called the song a [...] "better version" [...] of Oh Land's single [...] "Cherry on Top" [...] (2013) and described it as [...] "stark and surprisingly quaint". Other critics called the track romantic, such as The Guardians Paul MacInnes who described it as [...] "heart-smooshing" [...] and Leonie Cooper from NME who stated it was [...] "starkly romantic" [...] {{and called for a}} [...] "heart-swelling shift in mood" [...] on Wish Bone. Michael Jose Gonzalez, an editor for Gaffa, stated that the song was both beautiful and a delight. Neon Tommys Jennifer Joh wrote that [...] "Love You Better" [...] and album track [...] "Kill My Darling" [...] were both [...] "dark <b>and</b> <b>calmly</b> chaotic", adding that their [...] "satisfying harmonies [...] make one's head spin". Christopher Monk, a writer for musicOMH, noted that Oh Land's self-produced songs on Wish Bone ("3 Chances" [...] and [...] "Love You Better") are both [...] "pretty", but ultimately she claimed that [...] "they belong on a different album altogether".|$|E

500|$|Four battalions of rebel troops moved {{before dawn}} towards Saigon from the Mekong Delta, with armored {{personnel}} carriers and jeeps carrying machine guns. After cowing a police checkpoint {{on the edge of}} the capital, they put sentries in their place to seal off Saigon [...] from incoming or outgoing traffic. They then captured communication facilities in the capital. As the rebel troops took over the city without any firing and sealed it off, Phát sat in a civilian vehicle <b>and</b> <b>calmly</b> said, [...] "We'll be holding a press conference in town this afternoon at 4 p.m." [...] Claiming to represent The Council for the Liberation of the Nation, Phát proclaimed the deposal of Khánh's [...] "junta" [...] over national radio, and accused Khánh of promoting conflict within the nation's military and political leadership. He promised to capture Khánh and pursue a policy of increased anti-communism, stronger government and military. Phát stated he would return to the crypto-fascist, Catholic integrist ideology of the Ngô family to lay the foundation for his junta. According to historian George McTurnan Kahin, Phát's broadcast was [...] "triumphant" [...] and may have prompted senior officers who were neither part of the original conspiracy nor fully loyal to Khánh to conclude that Phát and Đức would not embrace them if they rallied to their side.|$|E
500|$|Warner {{learned from}} twelfth man Leo O'Brien that Woodfull was badly injured. Later in the afternoon, while Ponsford and Richardson were still batting, Warner and Palairet visited the Australian {{dressing}} {{room with the}} intention of enquiring about Woodfull's health. Accounts vary about what followed. According to the original newspaper reports and Fingleton's later description, Woodfull was lying on the masseur's table, awaiting treatment from a doctor, although this may have been an exaggeration for dramatic effect. Leo O'Brien described Woodfull as wearing a towel around his waist, having showered. Warner expressed sympathy to Woodfull but was surprised by the Australian's response. According to Warner, Woodfull replied, [...] "I don't want to see you, Mr Warner. There are two teams out there. One is trying to play cricket and the other is not." [...] Fingleton wrote that Woodfull had added, [...] "This game is too good to be spoilt. It is time some people got out of it." [...] Woodfull was usually dignified and quietly spoken, making his reaction surprising to Warner and others present. Warner recalled saying, [...] "Apart from all that, we most sincerely hope you are not too badly hurt," [...] to which Woodfull replied, [...] "The bruise is coming out." [...] Embarrassed and humiliated, Warner and Palairet turned and left. Fingleton noted that Woodfull spoke quietly <b>and</b> <b>calmly,</b> which increased the effectiveness of his words. He also pointed out that Warner prided himself on sportsmanship, so an accusation of [...] would have stung the Englishman. Warner was so shaken that he was found in tears later that day in his hotel room.|$|E
