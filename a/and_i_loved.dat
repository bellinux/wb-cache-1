500|$|At this time, as an {{adolescent}} in Los Angeles, bebop and the swing era big bands both attracted Farmer's attention. Decades later, he stated that, at that time, [...] "I knew I {{had to be}} in jazz. Two things decided me – the sound of a trumpet section in a big band and hearing a jam session". Farmer's trumpet influences in the 1940s were Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis and Fats Navarro, but, in his own words, [...] "then I heard Freddie Webster, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> his sound. I decided to work on sound because it seemed like most of the guys my age were just working on speed".|$|E

Hetrick underwent ten hours of make-up for the sequence where Q shows Vash what could have happened if he did not save her life following an insect bite in the Gamma Quadrant.

He {{believes}} that an actor with a [...] "proven track record" [...] would likely have been chosen if another network had broadcast the show. He went through numerous auditions; each time he explained to the casting directors what he could bring to the character, if given the part. Alan Taylor and Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner initially thought Hamm was too handsome for the role but ultimately decided, [...] "it was perfect to cast sort of the perfect male in this part". Weiner also sensed that the actor had suffered early loss of his parents, which was similar to Draper's backstory.|$|E

500|$|... "Porcelain" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Moby for his fifth studio album Play (1999) and recorded in his Little Italy, Manhattan apartment. He found the inspiration to compose the song from his experiences with an unidentified woman; speaking to Billboard, he explained: [...] "I {{was involved with}} this really, really wonderful woman, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> her very much. But I knew deep in my heart of hearts that we had no business being romantically involved. So, it's sort of about being {{in love with someone}} but knowing you shouldn't be with them."

500|$|Reviewers {{who gave}} Wipeout 3 lower marks noted {{a sense of}} {{disappointment}} that the series broke little new ground.

[...] Alistair Wallace of Gamasutra, in a retrospective on Wipeout 2097, remembered that [...] "I enjoyed [...] because it was more of the same <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> it, but I think the series ran out of its innovation. Doing loop the loops isn't a big deal really." [...] GameSpot summed up its review of the game by judging Wipeout 3 an excellent racer, but not able to beat Wipeout 2097 as the best futuristic racing game of all time.|$|E

500|$|Ellie Kendrick, who portrays Meera Reed in the series, in an {{interview}} with The Hollywood Reporter spoke about the re-introduction of Benjen Stark, or Coldhands Benjen, and working with Joseph Mawle, saying [...] "It was so fantastic. And it's interesting. If you've read the books, then you know about the Coldhands character, who was cut out of the Bran, Meera and Jojen storyline on the show. It was always interesting, having read the books, watching this amalgamation of story lines happen. Benjen is sort of like the Coldhands character in that he's a slightly suspicious guy who is half-dead and half-alive with blue hands. I thought that was very cool, the way it happened. It was a nice marriage between the book and TV revelations rolled into one. I was very excited having him on set. I loved working with Joseph Mawle, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> having another member of our rapidly dwindling gang." ...|$|E

Courtney was like 'Let's go, fuckers', <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> that." [...] In a later interview, Fleming said: Courtney was great at the time—it was before she even knew Kurt [...] She gave 180%. I've worked with some people that you've had to coax the performance out of them. With Courtney, there was no attitude. She was gonna give it all. And she did and it was really impressive to me... I loved the whole band; they were a lot of fun. That early lineup of Hole—I felt they were the real deal. They were Hollywood misfits—all of them. I felt it really captured what they were.|$|E

Frakes enjoyed the episode too, saying, [...] "A fabulous show. Those were the kind of chances we took first season that when they worked, they worked great. It was a very chancy show <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> it." [...] Director Paul Lynch also thought that the Bynars were [...] "great". Carolyn McCormick appeared as Minuet and subsequently became a regular cast member in Law and Order. She returned to the role of Minuet in the [...] episode [...] "Future Imperfect".

500|$|Schuur {{started singing}} {{when she was}} about three years old. Her mother, who died when Schuur was 13, loved jazz and had a Duke Ellington record collection. Her father, a police captain, was an amateur {{musician}} who often played piano with his daughter sitting by his side. Schuur stated, [...] "As far back as I can remember, singing was in my blood. My parents loved music, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> to sing. I was scatting at an early age". She has absolute pitch memory. Unlike the average person, in Schuur's mind every sound – musical or not – has a note value; for example, if she hears a humming motor, she knows the name that note has on a musical instrument. Schuur listened to the radio avidly in her youth; her early musical idols were Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington. She said that as a small child she would often retreat to a closet to sing.|$|E

[...] She added, [...] "It {{was just one of}} those charming, charming, charming times where I just got to blow it out. I just wanted Sue Ellen to be raw unlike any other time in her life, where she was the victim and she was this and she was that; J.R. Ewing would do something and she would react, he would do something and she would have an affair or drink or whatever. This was just like, 'Let me go. Let Sue Ellen out of that box' ...|$|E

Later that year, ex-Moody Blues guitarist Denny Laine joined the McCartneys and Seiwell to form the band Wings.

I found myself in that very position. However, it was a choice between going on or finishing, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>loved</b> music too much to think of stopping."
