5|$|In 1973, Douglas {{attended}} a meeting addressing conservation of the Everglades in Everglades City, and was observed by John Rothchild: Mrs. Douglas was {{half the size}} of her fellow speakers and she wore huge dark glasses, which along with the huge floppy hat made her look like Scarlett O'Hara as played by Igor Stravinsky. When she spoke, everybody stopped slapping mosquitoes and more or less came to order. She reminded us all of our responsibility to nature and I don't remember what else. Her voice had the sobering effect of a one-room schoolmarm's. The tone itself seemed to tame the rowdiest of the local stone crabbers, plus the developers, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> on both sides. I wonder if it didn't also intimidate the mosquitoes... The request for a Corps of Engineers permit was eventually turned down. This was no surprise to those of us who'd heard her speak.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese {{royal family}} left Europe {{and settled in}} colonial Brazil in 1808, after their escape from the Napoleonic {{invasion}} of Portugal. Carlota Joaquina, sister of FerdinandVII, was {{the wife of the}} Portuguese prince regent, but had her own political projects. As she avoided the later capture of the Spanish royal family, she attempted to take charge of the viceroyalty as regent. This political project, known as Carlotism, sought to prevent a French invasion of the Americas. A small secret society of criollos, composed of politicians such as Manuel Belgrano and Juan José Castelli, and military leaders such as Antonio Beruti and Hipólito Vieytes, supported this project. They considered it an opportunity to get a local government instead of a European one, or a step towards a potential declaration of independence. The project was resisted by Viceroy Liniers, most peninsulars, and some criollos, including Cornelio Saavedra <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> Mariano Moreno and Juan José Paso. They suspected that it concealed Portuguese expansionist ambitions over the region. The supporters of Carlota Joaquina intended her to head a constitutional monarchy, whereas she wanted to govern an absolute monarchy; these conflicting goals undermined the project and led to its failure. Britain, which had a strong influence in the politics of the Portuguese Empire, opposed the project as well: they did not want Spain split into several kingdoms, and considered Carlota Joaquina unable to prevent this.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{attacked}} the report as a , which they claimed read {{more like a}} legal defense than an objective investigation. They noted investigators could not interview any {{of the most important}} figures in the scandal, and contended that Mastro had a conflict of interest since his firm was politically tied to Christie. Wisniewski and Weinberg, co-chairs of the legislature investigative committee, criticized the report as incomplete and potentially biased since it was prepared by lawyers hired by the Christie administration, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> did not interview key figures in the scandal. Baroni, Kelly, Samson, Stepien, and Wildstein declined to be interviewed.|$|E

In October 1917, Saint Maximillian Kolbe and six other friars formed the Militia Immaculata {{with the goal of}} using every possible means to promote total consecration to Mary. Kolbe wanted the entire Franciscan Order consecrated to the Immaculata by an additional vow. The idea was well received, but faced the hurdles of approval by the hierarchy of the order <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawyers,</b> so it was never formally adopted during his life and was no longer pursued after his death.|$|E
500|$|It is {{believed}} that the Inns of Chancery evolved {{in tandem with the}} Inns of Court. During the 12th and 13th century the law was taught in the City of London, primarily by the clergy. During the 13th century two events happened which destroyed this form of legal education – firstly a decree by Henry III of England that no institutes of legal education could exist in the City of London, and second a papal bull that prohibited the clergy from teaching the law. As a result, the system of legal education fell apart, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> instead settled immediately outside the City of London {{as close as possible to}} Westminster Hall, where Magna Carta provided for a permanent court. This was the small village of Holborn, where they inhabited [...] "hostels" [...] or [...] "inns", which later took their name from the landlord of the Inn in question.|$|E

Thus <b>the</b> <b>lawyer's</b> five years of therapy - presumably for rage fits - turn out to be for nothing.

Consequently, there was a twelve-year gap between her work on Scorsese's student films and her Oscar-winning work on Raging Bull. “I {{would have loved to}} work with Marty, but I wasn’t in the union….And then, finally, Marty called me about Raging Bull <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> got me in the union.” ...|$|E

2500|$|The Bear Stearns case {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as the seminal case of legal counsel conflicts among hedge fund directors. [...] Investors in the funds lost approximately $1.6 billion and “the two supposedly independent directors appointed by Walkers to serve Cioffi’s two hedge funds were Scott Lennon and Michelle Wilson-Clarke” were found by the Cayman Islands court to be conflicted as they were employees of an affiliate of Walkers. [...] In his judgment the Chief Justice of the Cayman Islands said “For reasons which I need not elaborate now (but would be prepared to if asked), I am led to an irresistible impression that the manner of the conduct of the directors, trustee <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> advising them” — all Walkers employees — “over the resolutions for winding up was clandestine and suspicious and was certainly in breach of the strict prohibition — against such a resolution being taken during the pendancy of the investors’ petition for the removal of the directors." ...|$|E
2500|$|One motion, the {{so-called}} Hamilton-Proctor motion, involved the forensic ballistic evidence {{presented by the}} expert witnesses for the prosecution and defense. The prosecution's firearms expert, Charles Van Amburgh, had re-examined the evidence {{in preparation for the}} motion. By 1923, bullet comparison technology had improved somewhat, and Van Amburgh submitted photos of the bullets fired from Sacco's [...]32 Colt in support of the argument that they matched the bullet that killed Berardelli. In response, the controversial self-proclaimed [...] "firearms expert" [...] for the defense, Albert H. Hamilton, conducted an in-court demonstration involving two brand new Colt [...]32-caliber automatic pistols belonging to Hamilton, along with Sacco's [...]32 Colt of the same make and caliber. In front of Judge Thayer <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lawyers</b> for both sides, Hamilton disassembled all three pistols and placed the major component parts – barrel, barrel bushing, recoil spring, frame, slide, and magazine – into three piles on the table before him. He explained the functions of each part and began to demonstrate how each was interchangeable, in the process intermingling the parts of all three pistols. Judge Thayer stopped Hamilton and demanded that he reassemble Sacco's pistol with its proper parts.|$|E
