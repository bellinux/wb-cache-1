5|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} diplomatic contact between present-day Malaysia and Vietnam {{dates back to}} 1469. Soldiers of Vietnamese Later Le dynasty had captured a Malaccan tributary mission {{en route to the}} Chinese Ming dynasty, killing some of them, and castrating and enslaving the survivors. Tonkin expressed their intent to conquer Malacca; this intent was conveyed to the Chinese emperor in a later mission in 1481. The Chinese emperor ordered Malacca to raise soldiers {{in the event of a}} similar attack. Malacca defeated the Vietnamese during an invasion of Lan Xang <b>as</b> <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> a Chinese account. The Malay Annals also mention a Cham prince taking some of his followers to form a small Cham colony in Malacca when Vietnam invaded Champa in 1471, and deploying military assistance to Johor to fend off a botched military conquest in the 1590s. In the mid 17th-century, the Cham vassal states Panduranga and Kelantan cultivated close diplomatic ties when they led a long-term diplomatic mission to Kelantan to learn more about Malay culture and Islam. Subsequent Champa kings after Po Rome, beginning with his son Po Saut, periodically received Malay Muslim missionaries from Kelantan in the 17th and 18th centuries.|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies can {{bioaccumulate}} {{the toxic}} heavy metal arsenic {{from the soil}} {{in the form of}} the compound methylarsonic acid. Although less toxic than arsenic trioxide, it is still relatively dangerous. Concentrations over 1000mg/kg (dry weight) are often reached. <b>As</b> <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> one 2004 publication, a mature specimen collected near the town of Český Šternberk in the Czech Republic was found to have an arsenic content of 7090mg/kg dry weight, the highest concentration ever reported in a mushroom. Typically, the arsenic content of mycorrhizal mushrooms collected from unpolluted areas is lower than 1mg/kg. In a 2007 Turkish study of 23 wild edible mushroom species (collected from areas not known to be polluted), S.coronaria had the highest concentration of arsenic at 8.8mg/kg dry weight, while the arsenic concentration of the other tested mushrooms ranged from 0.003mg/kg (in Sarcodon leucopus) to 0.54mg/kg (in Lactarius salmonicolor).|$|E

5|$|This {{interpretation}} is corroborated by the different rhetoric {{and actions of}} Ibn al-Ash'ath and his followers, <b>as</b> <b>reported</b> <b>in</b> the sources: the former was {{ready and willing to}} compromise with the Umayyads, and continued to fight only because he had no alternative, while the great mass of his followers, motivated by discontent against the Umayyad regime couched in religious terms, were far more uncompromising and willing to carry on the struggle until death. Al-Hajjaj himself seems to have been aware of the distinction: in suppressing the revolt, he pardoned the Quraysh, the Syrians, and many of the other Arab clans, but executed tens of thousands among the mawālī and the Zutt of the Mesopotamian Marshes, who had sided with the rebels.|$|E
