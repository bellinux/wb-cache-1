40|$|The {{behavior}} was investigated of graphite and several charring <b>ablators</b> {{in a variety}} of high-radiative heat-flux environments. A commercial-grade graphite and nine state-of-the-art charring <b>ablators</b> were subjected to various radiative environments produced by a CO 2 laser and a carbon arc. Graphite was also tested in xenon-arc radiation. Heat-flux levels ranged from 10 to 47 MW/sq m. Tests were conducted in air, nitrogen, helium, and a CO 2 -N 2 mixture which simulated the Venus atmosphere. The experimental results were compared with theoretical results obtained with a one-dimensional charring-ablator analysis and a two-dimensional subliming-ablator analysis. Neither the graphite nor the charring <b>ablators</b> showed significant differences in appearance or microstructure after testing in the different radiative environments. The performance of phenolic nylon and graphite was predicted satisfactorily with existing analyses and published material property data. Good agreement between experimental and analytical results was obtained by using sublimation parameters from a chemical nonequilibrium analysis of graphite sublimation. Some charring <b>ablators</b> performed reasonably well and could withstand radiative fluxes of the level encountered in certain planetary entries.
