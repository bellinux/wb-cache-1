50|$|The Middle Game in Chess by Reuben Fine lists {{three major}} {{factors in the}} middlegame: king safety, force (material) and mobility, {{although}} {{not all of these}} factors are of equal importance. If king safety is a serious issue, a well-executed attack on the king can render other considerations, including material <b>advantages,</b> <b>irrelevant.</b> Material is another important consideration, Fine notes that—if all other things are equal—any material advantage will usually be decisive. According to Fine, a material advantage will usually not give a direct mating attack unless the advantage is very large (a rook or more), rather it {{can be used as a}} means of gaining more material and a decisive endgame advantage. To gain mobility is to ensure that the pieces have a wide scope of action and targets to focus on. The concept is largely strategic in nature, and involves such concepts as space, pawn weaknesses (since weak pawns can compel pieces to defensive duties, reducing their mobility), and securing outposts for the pieces.|$|E
5000|$|Lee {{chose to}} play a type of extreme strategy, known as amashi, in {{response}} to AlphaGo's apparent preference for Souba Go (attempting to win by many small gains when the opportunity arises), taking territory at the perimeter rather than the center. By doing so, his apparent aim was to force an [...] "all or nothing" [...] style of situation — a possible weakness for an opponent strong at negotiation types of play, and one which might make AlphaGo's capability of deciding slim <b>advantages</b> largely <b>irrelevant.</b>|$|R
25|$|When war {{finally broke}} out officially in July 1932, the Bolivians were {{confident}} of a rapid victory. Their country was {{richer and more}} populous than Paraguay, and their armed forces were larger, had a superior officer corps, and were well-trained and well-equipped. These <b>advantages</b> quickly proved <b>irrelevant</b> {{in the face of}} the Paraguayans' zeal to defend their homeland. The highly motivated Paraguayans knew the geography of the Chaco better than the Bolivians and easily infiltrated Bolivian lines, surrounded outposts, and captured supplies. In contrast, Indians from the Bolivian high plateau area, known as the Altiplano, were forced into the Bolivian army, had no real interest in the war, and failed to adapt to the hot Chaco climate. In addition, long supply lines, poor roads, and weak logistics hindered the Bolivian campaign. The Paraguayans proved more united than the Bolivians, at least initially, as President Eusebio Ayala and Colonel (later Marshal) Estigarribia worked well together.|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{research}} {{examines the}} roles of both approach–avoidance and approach– approach conflicts {{in the relationship between}} the degree of deliberation and persistence of preference for the chosen option. In three experiments, we reverse the negative effect of deliberation on persistence reported by Nordgren and Dijksterhuis (2009). In study 1 A, we conceptually replicate Nordgren and Dijksterhuis’s results in a choice context with simultaneous presentation of options. In study 1 B, we reversed this effect by making minor alterations to the choice set. When the choice set contains a brand with <b>advantage</b> on an <b>irrelevant</b> attribute with conflict caused by the more important attributes remains unchanged, deliberation leads to greater preference stability. In study 2, we obtain process evidence for a reduction in conflict and dominance structuring caused by discrimination in terms of an irrelevant attribute. In study 3, we found that when choice set induces conflict between two attractive options, deliberation causes persistent preference. In study 4, we vary perceived conflict without varying the choice set and replicate the effects obtained in experiments 1 A and 1 B. Thus, our studies provide evidence for {{the roles of}} approach–avoidance and approach–approach conflicts (Coombs and Avrunin 1988) in the deliberation–persistence relationship...|$|R
