We present a simple technological process which, thanks to the suppression of substrate, allows direct Hall measurement on superlattice structures grown on conductive GaSb substrate. Two samples were used to characterize the transport: one grown on a semi-insulating GaAs substrate and another grown on n-GaSb substrate where <b>a</b> <b>etch</b> stop layer was inserted to remove the conductive substrate.

In order for a systematic comparison, four samples are prepared, respectively, by conventional photolithography and ICP etching using MWCNT as <b>a</b> <b>etch</b> mask. MWCNT-etched Si with HMDS dispersion shows the highest RMS roughness and the lowest reflectance of the four. Two test device structures are fabricated with active regions of bare-Si as a reference and MWCNT etch masked Si with HMDS dispersion. The increased light-trapping was most significant at mid-UV, somewhat less at visible and less noticeable at infrared. With an ICP-etched Si using CNT HMDS dispersion, PS is very sharply increased. This result can lead to applications in optoelectronics where the enhancement in light-trapping is important.|$|E

The nitride LEDs having nano-patterned p-GaN were fabricated by selective deep etching of p-GaN by using self-assembled ITO nano-dots as <b>a</b> <b>etch</b> mask. For comparison, we also fabricated the nitride LEDs having groove-etched p-GaN as well as the LEDs having a normal p-GaN layer. The results show that the LEDs having nano-patterned p-GaN showed the higher color conversion efficiency of 15. 5 % and the improved effective internal quantum efficiency of 71 %. The enhanced efficiency can be attributed to sufficient close QD-MQW separation due to deep etching of p-GaN by using nano-patterning, which resulted in faster energy transfer rate of 2. 47 ns- 1 for non-radiative QD-MQW energy-transfer. close...|$|E

On the other hand, surface patterning or texturing instead of planar substrates have been widely investigated and adapted in order to handle light-trapping in a more efficient way [12 – 14]. Patterns {{that can be used}} in surface texturing can be either regular or random. A regularly textured surface can be yield with various types of patterns [3, 5, 6] using conventional photolithography. Randomly textured surfaces have been demonstrated [4, 7 – 10] using SnO 2, ZnO, Ag, glass, and plastics, which showed an improved spectral response in longer wavelengths. Meanwhile, CNTs have been widely proposed in composite materials to reinforce the mechanical strength and catalytic activities [15 – 21], which varies from metals, metal oxides, and ceramic composites to polymers. CNTs can also be used in various applications such as an emitter for the field effect displays, micro-supercapacitors, color fine-tuning, electrochemical sensors and hydrogen storage, etc. [22 – 29]. On the other hand, due to their superior mechanical strength, CNTs can be used as <b>a</b> <b>etch</b> mask in plasma dry-etching process [30]. While etch masks through conventional photolithography process can generate micron-scale patterns, CNT etch mask technique can provide nanoscale surface patterns as observed by microscopy [31 – 33].|$|E
40|$|Herein, {{we present}} {{the results of a}} {{systematic}} material development study we carried out in order to obtain a new positive tone resist for high resolution electron-beam lithography. Several acrylic copolymer materials with different mass fractions of the comonomers, different molecular weights and similar molecular weight distributions were synthesized and - as resist solutions - evaluated in terms of electron-beam lithography performance. On the one hand, within the ranges investigated, it was shown that the lithographic sensitivity is significantly influenced by the composition rather than by the molecular weight or molecular weight distribution. On the other hand, the etch resistance of the materials remains unaffected by changes of these parameters. The resist material exhibiting the best combination of the desired properties, mr-PosEBR, is 2 times more sensitive than PMMA (495 kDa) and performs comparably to the known high resolution resist ZEP 520 A. For example, a grating pattern with 29 nm wide lines with a period of 100 nm could be generated in films of mr-PosEBR with an area dose of 100 mu C/cm(2). In terms of resolution, single lines of only 35 nm width could be fabricated via metal lift-off using 100 kV EBL. Furthermore, the dry etch stability of mr-PosEBR in a reactive-ion etching (RIE) process (etch gases: CF 4 /SF 6) is similar to the one of ZEP 520 <b>A</b> (<b>etch</b> rates, mr-PosEBR: 190 nm/min, ZEP 520 A: 150 nm/min, silicon: 440 nm/min). Moreover, high resolution nanopatterns in mr-PosEBR could be smoothly transferred into the underlying Si substrate by a RIE process. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|Wet bulk {{micromachining}} is {{a popular}} technique for the fabrication of microstructures in research labs {{as well as in}} industry. However, increasing the throughput still remains an active area of research, and can be done by increasing the etching rate. Moreover, the release time of a freestanding structure can be reduced if the undercutting rate at convex corners can be improved. In this paper, we investigate a non-conventional etchant in the form of NH 2 OH added in 5 wt% tetramethylammonium hydroxide (TMAH) to determine its etching characteristics. Our analysis is focused on a Si{ 1 [*] 0 [*] 0 } wafer as this is the most widely used in the fabrication of planer devices (e. g. complementary metal oxide semiconductors) and microelectromechanical systems (e. g. inertial sensors). We perform a systematic and parametric analysis with concentrations of NH 2 OH varying from 5 % to 20 % in step of 5 %, all in 5 wt% TMAH, to obtain the optimum concentration for achieving improved etching characteristics including higher etch rate, undercutting at convex corners, and smooth etched surface morphology. Average surface roughness (R <b>a),</b> <b>etch</b> depth, and undercutting length are measured using a 3 D scanning laser microscope. Surface morphology of the etched Si{ 1 [*] 0 [*] 0 } surface is examined using a scanning electron microscope. Our investigation has revealed a two-fold increment in the etch rate of a { 1 [*] 0 [*] 0 } surface with the addition of NH 2 OH in the TMAH solution. Additionally, the incorporation of NH 2 OH significantly improves the etched surface morphology and the undercutting at convex corners, which is highly desirable for the quick release of microstructures from the substrate. The results presented in this paper are extremely useful for engineering applications and will open a new direction of research for scientists in both academic and industrial laboratories...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: This study {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} extended acid etching on microtensile bond strength (µTBS) of <b>a</b> <b>etch</b> and rinse adhesive system to sound vital dentin. Etching times of 5, 20 and 80 seconds {{was used to evaluate}} the µTBS on vital dentin with resin bonded composite [RBC] restoration (Esthet-XTM) which used a two step etch and rinse adhesive system(Prime Bond NTTM) for bonding. Methods: 26 premolars which were going to be extracted for orthodontic treatment were used for this experiment. The teeth were randomly divided into 3 groups based on the etch times and restored with RBC using two step adhesive and extracted in `Guarulhos University 2 ̆ 7 Brazil. After extraction, these teeth were sectioned (Microtome) in such a way to obtain 2 testing beams of 2 mm diameter from each tooth were obtained which were trimmed (CNC specimen former, University of Iowa, IA, USA) to a dumb bell shape and tested for the microtensile bond strength in University of Iowa. Out of 26 teeth, 46 beams were obtained. For statistical analysis, One-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey-Kramer 2 ̆ 7 s test was used to determine whether there were significant differences in micro-tensile bond strength among three etching times under each condition. All tests had a 0. 05 level of statistical significance. SAS for Windows (v 9. 1, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA) was used for the data analysis. Fracture mode was analyzed using scanning electron microscopy. Results: Bond strengths in 20 seconds and 5 seconds groups were significantly greater than that observed in 80 seconds group, while {{there was no significant difference}} between 20 and 5 etching times. SEM showed majority of the failure was adhesive/ joint failure. Significance: The results in this In-vivo study are consistent with other in-vitro studies and thus bring an insight on the importance of duration of phosphoric acid application on dentin and extended etch times could compromise the bond strength of the restorations...|$|E
40|$|GaN {{and related}} {{materials}} keep drawing attention {{because of their}} successful application in light emitter diodes (LEDs) and laser diodes (LDs) and their high potential application in high power and high temperature electric devices. Lots of efforts have been devoted to dry etching of GaN due to ongoing device size minimization and chemical inertness of the material. The first goal {{of this research is}} to develop a procedure for fabricating GaN patterns in the nanometer scale. To achieve this goal, the dose of electron beam lithography and plasma parameters have been varied. The effort has concentrated on obtaining the fine patterns with steep sidewall and smooth etched surface for the device applications. Scanning electron microscopy has been used to inspect the pattern profile and atomic force microscopy has been employed to monitor the surface roughness. Nano-wires and dots have been fabricated in gallium nitride using electron beam lithography and reactive ion etching (RIE). The developed nanofabrication procedure has been successfully implemented in nano-dots fabrication in Si/Siâ‚“Ny superlattice. High density plasma (HDP) has been recommended for etching GaN, because of high reactive species and ion density, predominately controllable ion energy and easier scale-up for production (inductively coupled plasma (ICP)). Thus, study ICP for etching GaN has become the second goal. A Langmuir probe has been used to quantify the amount of ion bombardment during plasma etching by measuring the ion flux, while optical emission spectroscopy has been employed to monitor atomic F radical. ICP etching of GaN is highly ion induced. The etch condition has been optimised, resulting in an almost vertical pattern profile and <b>a</b> <b>etch</b> rate of 67 nm/min. This is about 5 times more of that obtained in RIE by using the same gas composition (SFâ‚†+Nâ‚‚). To achieve higher etch rate, ICP chlorine plasma etching of GaN has been investigated. The fastest etch rate of 314 nm/min has been obtained with good vertical nature of pattern profile. However dry etch induced damage may affect material properties and deteriorate device quality. Thus, the study of dry etch-induced damage effects at the microscopic scale and optimisation of the etch conditions to obtain fast etch rate, smooth surface morphology, anisotropic profile and minimal etch damage is the final goal of this project. We achieved this goal by correlating the plasma characteristics to etch behaviour, diodes properties to photoluminescence (PL) properties for studying the top surface damage, and quantum device conductivity for the sidewall damage. Our data show that SFâ‚† + Nâ‚‚ ICP plasma with high ion energy improves diodes properties with reasonable etch rate, almost vertical profile and smooth surface morphology. However, it reduces PL D 0 X intensity dramatically. While, 25 %Clâ‚‚ + 75 %Ar ICP plasma produces a fast etch rate and does not reduce the PL intensity significantly. However, it deteriorates the diodes properties. These results suggest that a SFâ‚† + Nâ‚‚ (1 : 1) plasma with high ion energy should be appropriate for GaN transistor gate recessing, subjecting to mobility investigation. A 75 % Ar + 25 % Clâ‚‚ plasma is suitable for the fabrication of optical devices, such as light emitting diodes and laser diodes. The preliminary result of quantum wire devices shows that sidewall depletion in quantum wire structures is about 65 nm at the given SFâ‚† + Nâ‚‚ plasma conditions. This gives an indication that length scale of the depth of defects introduced by etching is about 52 nm in our GaN. However, the defects may propagate deeper...|$|E

40|$|Single {{junction}} Si {{solar cells}} have a maximum theoretical efficiency of 31 % under 1 sun illumination. This is generally {{referred to as}} the Shockley-Queisser limit. A significant part of the losses of these devices are related to the thermalization of hot electrons generated by photons with an energy higher than the forbidden bandgap. A proven way of reducing these thermalization losses consists of stacking materials with different bandgaps {{on top of each other}} in a multi-junction device. III-V materials are a convenient choice of material for this stack since the bandgap can be tuned in a straightforward manner. Finding an all-Si based alternative would however allow significant cost advantages. Earlier attempts in literature to make all-Si based tandem solar cells focused on Si quantum dots. However, the level of control required to optimize both the quantum confinement in the quantum dots and the tunneling between quantum dots has so far proven to be beyond the current technological capabilities. Towards the goal of an all-Si based tandem solar cell, this study investigates the potential use of Si nanowires as a higher bandgap crystalline material to form the top cell. The innovative device concept relies on quantum confinement in two directions to tune the bandgap while maintaining the third direction for current collection. This alleviates the problems related to tunneling between quantum dots. The scope of this study is centered on answering 2 main questions: is it possible to fabricate the necessary type of nanowires, and can the nanowires serve as active material for a top cell?A proof of concept process flow is developed based on a combination of DUV lithography, dry etching and oxidation to obtain the right size of nanowires. This process results in nanowires that taper slightly from a diameter of 8 - 13 nm at the foot of the nanowires to 2. 5 - 4. 5 nm at the top of the nanowires. A dense array of nanowires is created with a pitch of 90 nm between the nanowires and a nanowire length of 500 nm. Electrical contacts to the nanowires are obtained by a combination of PECVD oxide filling of the gaps between the nanowires and chemical-mechanical polishing of the overfill and thermal oxide. The quality of the Si/SiO 2 interface is investigated by ESR. The density of dangling bonds along the vertical interface of the nanowires themselves were measured as well as their passivation kinetics. The effective interface defect density [Pb 0 NW] = 3. 3 x 1012 cm- 2, with a passivation activation energy Ea of 1. 53 eV and a standard deviation sEa of 0. 23 +/- 0. 02 eV. This high value of sEa is indicative of a strained interface. Considering the values for the passivation kinetics, the prognosis is that [Pb 0] can only be decreased ~ 25 times by hydrogen or forming gas annealing. This means that the nanowires can't be passivated better than [Pb 0] = 1. 3 x 1011 cm- 2. Optical pump THz probe spectroscopy shows that this high density of interface traps cause almost immediate trapping (picosecond time-scale) and recombination of photogenerated carriers. An optical time-of-flight technique on the other hand, measured the time it took carriers to travel through the nanowires. From the transit time measured by this technique, the mobility is extracted. The mobility is 0. 06 +/- 0. 009 cm 2 /Vs. This much lower value is representative of the impact of all the dangling bonds on the mobility. From these material properties it seems highly unlikely that the nanowires, as currently produced by a top-down approach and size-reduction by oxidation, can serve as active material for a top cell. In the device measurements performed on the nanowires their role could not clearly be distinguished. In the I-V curves they could only be distinguished as an additional series resistance. They did not seem to form part of the active layer.
