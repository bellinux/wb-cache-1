40|$|Background: Circadian rhythms are 24 hour {{oscillations}} in many behavioural, physiological, cellular {{and molecular}} {{processes that are}} controlled by an endogenous clock which is entrained to environmental factors including light, food and stress. Transcriptional analyses of circadian patterns demonstrate that genes showing circadian rhythms {{are part of a}} wide variety of biological pathways. Pathway <b>activity</b> <b>method</b> can identify the significant pattern of the gene expression levels within a pathway. In this method, the overall gene expression levels are translated to a reduced form, pathway activity levels, via singular value decomposition (SVD). A given pathway represented by pathway activity levels can then be as analyzed using the same approaches used for analyzing gene expression levels. We propose to use pathway <b>activity</b> <b>method</b> across time to identify underlying circadian pattern of pathways. Results: We used synthetic data to demonstrate that pathway activity analysis can evaluate the underlying circadian pattern within a pathway even when circadian patterns cannot be captured by the individual gene expression levels. In addition, we illustrated that pathway activity formulation should be coupled with a significance analysis to distinguish biologically significant information from random deviations. Next, we performed pathway activity level analysis on a rich time series of transcriptional profiling in rat liver. The over-represented fiv...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} work {{was to assess the}} relative effectiveness of three teaching methods on students’ achievement in secondary school Mathematics. The design of the study was a quasi-experimental pretest posttest research design using intact classes. A sample of 150 students randomly selected from three secondary schools in Ogbadibo Local Government Area was used in this study. The instrument for data collection was a 25 -item achievement test in mathematics (ATM) developed by the researcher for the purpose of measuring students ’ achievement in mathematics. The reliability coefficient for the instrument using Cronbach coefficient alpha was 0. 95. In the study, two research questions were answered and two hypotheses were tested. The results indicated that students taught using <b>activity</b> <b>method</b> performed better than those taught using discussion and lecture methods; {{there was no significant difference}} in mean achievement between boys and girls when they are taught using <b>activity</b> <b>method.</b> Moreover, a significant difference exists in mean achievement scores of male and female students when they are taught mathematics using lecture method.

40|$|This paper aims {{to present}} a {{sociology}} of literary studies that is distinguished from the sociology of literature in that its focus is on literary studies as a social practice {{rather than as a}} socio-cultural institution: how literary studies is institutionalized as such not how it functions in relation to literature. The sociological analysis of literary studies in this paper entails two tasks. Firstly, it constructs a methodological frame within which literary studies can be observed and analysed in terms of the rules of discursive formation rather than as a pre-discursive entity. This is achieved through conceptualizing the Foucauldian notion of discursive formation and knowledge practice as an analytic strategy and operationalising it via Paul Dowling's Social <b>Activity</b> <b>Method.</b> Empirically, the analysis produces a description of the practice of literary studies as instantiated in the particular region of the practice constituted with what I refer to as the crisis discourse. The analysis describes literary studies as that which is emergent upon differing institutionalising strategies articulated by its participants to mark out literary studies from other practices and to maintain its disciplinarity through regulating the distribution and the access of the distribution of the discourse within and beyond the practice. The generalisability of the research in this paper lies in the applicability of the analytical method that can be employed at any given level of analysis to examine discursive practiceâ€”such as literary studiesâ€”as the effects of the particular discourses in terms of how they articulate and sustain the institutionalised identity of the practice.

The approach puts emphasis on the autonomy and emergent quality of well-formed research activity. SAM is not, however, solipsistic: it is designed to recursively self-organise in relation to what it encounters elsewhere but on the explicit basis of its own principles.
