5|$|In 1868, Catholicos Gevorg (George) IV {{made the}} last major {{alteration}} to the cathedral by adding a sacristy to its east end.

5|$|Agagianian was {{elevated}} to the cardinalate in 1946 by Pope Pius XII.

5|$|Based on Henry VIII's {{desire for}} an {{annulment}} {{of his marriage}} (first requested of Pope Clement VII in 1527), the English Reformation was at the outset more of a political affair than <b>a</b> <b>theological</b> dispute.

5|$|In 1780, in {{his first}} {{discussion}} of purely religious matters, Espejo wrote <b>a</b> <b>theological</b> letter, Carta al Padre la Graña sobre indulgencias (Letter to Father la Graña about indulgences). In this work, he looked at indulgences in the Catholic Church. The letter showed a profound knowledge of theology and dogma. It analyzed the historical beginnings of indulgences and their development and cited decrees and bulls written about abuses of indulgences. In this work, Espejo staunchly supported {{the authority of the}} Pope.|$|E
5|$|John Chilembwe, born locally {{in around}} 1871, {{received}} his early education at a Church of Scotland mission and later met Joseph Booth, a radical Baptist missionary {{who ran the}} Zambezi Industrial Mission. Booth preached a form of egalitarianism and his progressive attitude towards race attracted Chilembwe's attention. Under Booth's patronage, Chilembwe travelled to the United States to study at <b>a</b> <b>theological</b> college in Virginia. There he mixed in African-American circles and was influenced by stories of the abolitionist John Brown and the egalitarianist Booker T. Washington.|$|E

The discovery and theft of the True Cross threatens to tip the internecine conflict in the favor of the Owls, leaving them in control of the Group; the assembled members are Roosters and wish to stop this.|$|E
5|$|At {{the core}} of Confucian ethics were the {{selected}} virtues of filial piety, harmonious relationships, ritual, and righteousness. The amalgamation of these ideas into <b>a</b> <b>theological</b> system involving earlier cosmological theories of yin and yang {{as well as the}} five phases (i.e. natural cycles which governed Heaven, Earth, and Man) was first pioneered by the official Dong Zhongshu (179104 BCE). Although full authenticity of Dong's authorship of the Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals comes into question with hints that parts were rewritten around the time of Liu Xiang (798 BCE) or Liu Xin (d. 23 CE), three of his original memorials sent to the throne discussing his syncretic version of Confucianism were preserved in the 1st-century-CE Book of Han.|$|E
5|$|Augustine of Hippo (354–430 AD) was {{a philosopher}} and theologian born in Roman Africa (present-day Algeria). He {{followed}} the Manichaean religion during his early life, but converted to Christianity in 386. His two major works, Confessions and City of God, develop key ideas regarding {{his response to}} suffering. In Confessions, Augustine wrote that his previous work was dominated by materialism and that reading Plato's works enabled him to consider {{the existence of a}} non-physical substance. This helped him develop a response to the problem of evil from <b>a</b> <b>theological</b> (and non-Manichean) perspective, based on his interpretation of the first few chapters of Genesis and the writings of Paul the Apostle. In City of God, Augustine developed his theodicy as part of his attempt to trace human history and describe its conclusion.|$|E

5|$|During Becket's exile Foliot {{collected}} {{and sent to}} Rome Peter's Pence, the annual payment from England to the papacy. Foliot observed during the conflict {{that it was not}} <b>a</b> <b>theological</b> or moral dispute, merely one over church government. During Becket's exile, the king confiscated the archbishop's estates, and also confiscated the benefices of the clerks who had followed Becket into exile. Foliot was made custodian of those benefices in the diocese of Canterbury. Becket blamed both Foliot and Roger of York for the confiscations, but evidence appears to show that the confiscations were Henry's decision, and that Foliot, at least, was a conscientious custodian who made sure that little profit went to the king, and most of the revenues from the benefices went to religious purposes.|$|E
5|$|In 1845 King's {{established}} a Military Department to train officers for the Army and the British East India Company, and in 1846 <b>a</b> <b>Theological</b> Department to train Anglican priests. In 1855, King's pioneered evening classes in London; that King's granted {{students at the}} evening classes certificates of college attendance {{to enable them to}} sit University of London degree exams was cited {{as an example of the}} worthlessness of these certificates in the decision by the University of London to end the affiliated colleges system in 1858 and open their examinations to everyone.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, R.C. Horner, a Canadian holiness evangelist, {{introduced}} <b>a</b> <b>theological</b> distinction {{that would be}} important {{for the development of}} Pentecostalism. He argued in his books Pentecost (1891) and Bible Doctrines (1909) that the baptism in the Holy Spirit was not synonymous with the second blessing but was actually a third work of grace subsequent to salvation and sanctification that empowered the believer for service. Charles Fox Parham would build on this doctrinal foundation when he identified speaking in tongues as the Bible evidence of Spirit baptism.|$|E

5|$|Process ethics, Palmer argues, {{is closer}} to individualist consequentialism than individualist deontological {{environmental}} ethics. In considering collectivist environmental ethics, Palmer asks how process thinkers could approach natural collectives, such as ecosystems. She argues that Whitehead could view them as single entities with a good of their own, while Hartshorne could not. The primary difference between process ethics and collectivist environmental ethics, however, is that the former has <b>a</b> <b>theological</b> basis. The advocates of deep ecology have previously sought support from the views of Whitehead; two affinities are the shared holism and a shared concern with {{the extension of the}} self, but Palmer finds that the views of Whitehead and the views of the deep ecology advocate Arne Næss differ in these areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{final years}} of Alexios's reign were marked by {{persecution}} of the followers of the Paulician and Bogomil heresies—one of his last acts was to burn at the stake the Bogomil leader, Basil the Physician, {{with whom he had}} engaged in <b>a</b> <b>theological</b> controversy; by renewed struggles with the Turks (1110–1117); and by anxieties as to the succession, which his wife Irene wished to alter in favour of her daughter Anna's husband Nikephorus Bryennios, for whose benefit the special title panhypersebastos ("honored above all") was created. This intrigue disturbed even his dying hours.|$|E
5|$|The term baptism {{with the}} Holy Spirit {{originates}} in the New Testament, and all Christian traditions {{accept it as}} <b>a</b> <b>theological</b> concept. Nevertheless, different Christian denominations and traditions have interpreted its meaning {{in a variety of}} ways due to differences in the doctrines of salvation and ecclesiology. As a result, Spirit baptism has been variously defined as part of the sacraments of initiation into the church, as being synonymous with regeneration, as being synonymous with Christian perfection, or as being a second work of grace that empowers a person for Christian life and service.|$|E

5|$|Tinne {{was born}} Emily Margaret McCulloch on 21 August 1886 near Calcutta, India. Her father, William McCulloch, was a Presbyterian missionary and {{principal}} at <b>a</b> <b>theological</b> college in nearby Chinsurah, West Bengal.

Tinne had two brothers and a sister, and the four were sent to boarding school in 1893, when Tinne was about seven. During the school holidays, the children would live either with Tinne's maternal aunt in Sevenoaks, Kent or grandparents in Edinburgh. Her parents remained in India until the 1920s.|$|E
5|$|When the Persians conquered Anatolia, Maximus {{was forced}} to flee to a monastery near Carthage. It was there that he came {{under the tutelage of}} Saint Sophronius, and began {{studying}} in detail with him the Christological writings of Gregory of Nazianzus and Dionysius the Areopagite. Maximus continued his career as <b>a</b> <b>theological</b> and spiritual writer while his lengthy stay in Carthage. Maximus was also held in very high esteem by the exarch Gregory, the eparch George and the population as a holy man, ostensibly becoming an influential unofficial political advisor and spiritual head in North Africa.|$|E
5|$|Ideologically, al-Mu'tasim {{followed}} {{the footsteps of}} al-Ma'mun, continuing his predecessor's support for Mu'tazilism, <b>a</b> <b>theological</b> doctrine that attempted to tread a middle way between secular monarchy and the theocratic nature of rulership espoused by the Alids and the various sects of Shi'ism. Mu'tazilis espoused {{the view that the}} Quran was created and hence fell within the authority of a God-guided imām to interpret according to the changing circumstances. While revering Ali, they avoided taking a position on the righteousness of the opposing sides in the conflict between Ali and his opponents. Mu'tazilism was officially adopted by al-Ma'mun in 827, and in 833, shortly before his death, al-Ma'mun made its doctrines compulsory, with the establishment of an inquisition, the miḥna. During his brother's reign, al-Mu'tasim played {{an active role in the}} enforcement of the miḥna in the western provinces, and continued on the same course after his accession: the chief advocate of Mu'tazilism, the head qādī Ahmad ibn Abi Duwad, was perhaps the dominant influence at the caliphal court throughout al-Mu'tasim's reign.|$|E
