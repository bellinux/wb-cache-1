500|$|When {{asked what}} caused the {{explosion}} of the popularity of rock 'n roll {{that took place in the}} 1950s, with him and a handful of others, mainly him, Berry said, [...] "Well, actually they begin to listen to it, you see, because certain stations played certain music. The music that we, the blacks, played, the cultures were so far apart, we would have to have a play station in order to play it. The cultures begin to come together, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> see one another's vein of life, then the music came together." ...|$|E
500|$|To placate anxious fans, Broussard {{decided to}} create another trailer for E3 2001â€”it was the first public look at the game in three years. The video showed {{a couple of minutes}} of in-game footage, which notably showed the player moving in what appears to be Las Vegas and a certain level of {{interactivity}} (the player buys a sandwich from a vending machine and pushes each individual button on a keypad with Duke's outstretched finger). The trailer was impressive, and Duke Nukem was the talk of the convention; IGN reported on the game's graphics, saying, [...] "Characters come to life with picturesque facial animations that are synced perfectly with speech, hair that swings as they bob their heads, eyes that follow gazes, and more. The particle effects system, meanwhile, boasts impressive explosion effects with shimmering fire, shattered glass, and blood spilt in every direction [...] Add in real-time lighting effects, interactive environments, and a variation in locales unequaled in any other first-person shooter <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> see and understand why Duke Nukem Forever {{has been one of the}} most hotly anticipated titles over the last couple of years." [...] Duke Nukem Forever looked as good or better than most games, and staff at 3D Realms recalled a sense of elation after the presentation; [...] "The video was just being eaten up by people," [...] one said. [...] "We were so far ahead of other people at the time." [...] While many of the staff expected Broussard to make a push for finishing the game, however, he still did not have a finished product in mind. Following the death of one of Gathering of Developers' co-founders and continuing financial problems, the publishers' Texas-based offices were shut down and absorbed into parent company Take-Two Interactive.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{documentary}} aired by CBS, Vinod Khosla, co-founder of Sun Microsystems states, [...] "The IITs probably are the hardest {{school in the}} world to get into, {{to the best of my}} knowledge".

6000|$|... "There wasn't {{much for}} either of us to look forward to, was there, when we first looked down on the river {{together}} <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> tell me fairy stories." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By a {{sequence}} of fortuitous circumstances," [...] I pursued, [...] "it became {{possible for me to}} circumvent the obstacle upon which you had based your calculations. Those same circumstances led later to my being arrested in error and in place of another man. You discovered how I had contravened the influence upon which you counted; you trembled to see how the unexpected had befriended me, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> fear for your wager.|$|R

6000|$|... "Don't grow impatient, Walter," [...] said Caleb. [...] "We'll run {{up against}} {{something}} soon--perhaps {{more than you}} care for. It's easy enough to think of sinking an enemy's ship. Supposing he puts a few thirteen-inch shells through your craft, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> go down--what then?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What is it I have said?" [...] {{asks the}} young lady. [...] "I have only said Sir John Armytage has volunteered, and Mr. Wolfe has covered himself with honour, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> scold me! How can I help it if Mr. Wolfe is brave and famous? Is that any reason {{you should be}} angry, pray?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! You {{see some}} {{young girl who}} strikes you as {{particularly}} charming whether she really is or not doesn't matter a bit <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> think about her a great deal, to want to see her, and to get generally sentimental and absurd," [...] began Rose, finding it difficult to give a diagnosis of the most mysterious disease under the sun.|$|E
6000|$|The {{other day}} {{they said you}} were trifling with him, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> almost proved that you were not; lately they have said that <b>you</b> be not, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> {{straightway}} <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> show--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, that clever man, Bickley, {{lifted the}} bone {{which had been}} crushed in. Only then {{something}} broke in your head <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> bleed here," [...] and she touched what I believe is called the temporal artery. [...] "The vein had been crushed by the blow, and gave way. Bickley worked and worked, and just in time he tied it up before you died. Oh! then I felt as though I loved Bickley, though afterwards Bastin said that I ought to have loved him, since it was not Bickley who stopped the bleeding, but his prayer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'There was,' said Psmith, 'in {{a measure}} {{what might be}} {{described}} as a row. At least, when you find a perfect stranger attaching himself to your collar <b>and</b> pulling, <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> suspect that something of that kind is on the bill.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{trick is}} {{to die in the}} jacket, to will {{yourself}} to die. I know you don't get me yet, but wait. You know how you get numb in the jacket--how your arm or your leg goes to sleep. Now you can't help that, but you can take it for the idea and improve on it. Don't wait for your legs or anything to go to sleep. You lie on your back as comfortable as you can get, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> use your will.|$|E
6000|$|When you get {{a sudden}} alarm, {{of the sort that}} I had got now, nine times out of ten the place you feel it in is your stomach. When you feel it in your stomach, your {{attention}} wanders, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> fidget. I fidgeted silently in my place on the sand. Mr. Franklin noticed me, contending with a perturbed stomach or mind--which you please; they mean the same thing--and, checking himself just as he was starting with his part of the story, said to me sharply, [...] "What do you want?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You can {{be alone}} for a minute. You can be alone just in that minute when you've broken free, and you feel heart thankful to be alone, because the other thing wasn't to be borne. But you can't keep on being alone. No matter how many tunes you've broken free, and feel, thank God to be alone (nothing on earth is so good as to breathe fresh air and be alone), {{no matter how many}} times you've felt this--it wears off every time, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> look again--and you begin to roam round. And even if you won't admit it to {{yourself}}, still you are seeking--seeking. Aren't you? Aren't you yourself seeking?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Most {{commentators}} {{mentioned the}} titanic {{size of the}} convention center. Darrell Schweitzer said of it, [...] "Imagine a convention held in a zeppelin hangar -- designed for multiple zeppelins -- <b>and</b> <b>you</b> will <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> get the idea ... was enough airspace to fly a small plane indoors." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed yes!" [...] replied Madeline, with {{a little}} laugh. [...] "You will think so when Stillwell gets hold of <b>you</b> <b>and</b> <b>begins</b> <b>to</b> talk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ned," [...] {{said the}} Doctor to him one day, in his gruffest tone, [...] "you are not {{turning out to}} be the boy I looked for and meant to make. I have given you sturdy English instruction, and solidly {{grounded}} you in matters that the poor superficial people and time merely skim over; I looked to see the rudiments of a man in you, by this time; <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> mope and pule as if your babyhood were coming back on you. You seem to think more than a boy of your years should; and yet it is not manly thought, nor ever will be so. What do you mean, boy, by making all my care of you come to nothing, in this way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr Whyte {{heard the}} old man to the end in silence; then, without {{altering}} his position, he looked round on the assembly with a frown, and said, [...] "Now listen to me; I am a man of few words. I have told you over and over again, and now repeat it, that you shall get no gratuities until you prove yourselves worthy of them. I shall not increase your advances by so much as half an inch of tobacco till your last year's debts are scored off, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> show more activity in hunting and less disposition to grumble. Hitherto you have not brought in anything like the quantity of furs that {{the capabilities of the}} country led me to expect. You are lazy. Until you become better hunters you shall have no redress from me." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{is always}} a {{question}} how much or little we had better know {{about the history of}} a strange country when seeing it. If the great mass of travelers voted according to their ignorance, the majority in favor of knowing next to nothing would be overwhelming, and I do not say they would be altogether unwise. History itself is often of two minds about the facts, or the truth from them, and when you have stored away its diverse conclusions, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> apply them to the actual conditions, you are constantly embarrassed by the misfits. What did it avail me to believe that when the Goths overran the north of Spain the Vandals overran the south, and when they swept on into Africa and melted away in the hot sun there as a distinctive race, they left nothing but the name Vandalusia, a letter less, behind them? If the Vandals were what they are reported to have been, the name does not at all characterize the liveliest province of Spain. Besides, the very next history told me that they took even their name with them, and forbade me the simple and apt etymology which I had pinned my indolent faith to.|$|E
5000|$|Living in {{the house}} also generates heat. Active human beings can produce as much heat as a one bar {{electric}} fire. Add to this heat from cooking, washing, lights etc. <b>and</b> <b>you</b> can <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> see how an eco-house could get too hot. Conventionally opening the windows reduces heat, but an eco-house design could include heat recovery ventilation systems.|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{should like}} to get that powder <b>and</b> ball before <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> trade with the Indians, Mr Grant," [...] said Jasper, after breakfast was concluded, [...] "I'm anxious to be off as soon as possible." ...|$|R
60|$|That we {{may know}} the Laird better, a brief {{description}} of his home may be introduced. Within {{a mile and a half}} of the east end of Princes Street, Edinburgh, lies, on the left of the railway to the south, a squalid suburb. You drive or walk on a dirty road, north-eastwards, through unambitious shops, factories, tall chimneys, flaming advertisements, and houses for artisans. The road climbs a hill, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> find, on each side of you, walls of ancient construction, and traces of great old doorways, now condemned. On the left are ploughed fields, and even clumps of trees with blackened trunks. Grimy are the stacks of corn in the farmyard to the left, at the crest of the hill. On the right, a gateway gives on a short avenue which leads to a substantial modern house. Having reached this point in my pilgrimage, I met a gentleman who occupies the house, and asked if I might be permitted to view the site. The other, with much courtesy, took me up to the house, of which only the portion in view from the road was modern. Facing the west all was of the old Scottish chÃ¢teau style, with gables, narrow windows, and a strange bulky chimney on the north, bulging out of the wall. The west side of the house stood on the very brink of a steep precipice, beneath which lay what is now but a large deep waterhole, but, at the period of the Gowrie conspiracy, was a loch fringed with water weeds, and a haunt of wild fowl. By this loch, Restalrig Loch, the witch more than three centuries ago met the ghost of Tam Reid, who fell in Pinkie fight, and by the ghost was initiated into the magic which brought her to the stake.|$|E
60|$|I {{was to have}} {{an early}} breakfast, and start at dawn, for that was the usual way; but I had the demon's own time with my armor, and this delayed me a little. It is {{troublesome}} to get into, and {{there is so much}} detail. First you wrap a layer or two of blanket around your body, for a sort of cushion and to keep off the cold iron; then you put on your sleeves and shirt of chain mail--these are made of small steel links woven together, and they form a fabric so flexible that if you toss your shirt onto the floor, it slumps into a pile like a peck of wet fish-net; it is very heavy and is nearly the uncomfortablest material in the world for a night shirt, yet plenty used it for that--tax collectors, and reformers, and one-horse kings with a defective title, and those sorts of people; then you put on your shoes--flat-boats roofed over with interleaving bands of steel--and screw your clumsy spurs into the heels. Next you buckle your greaves on your legs, and your cuisses on your thighs; then come your backplate and your breastplate, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> feel crowded; then you hitch onto the breastplate the half-petticoat of broad overlapping bands of steel which hangs down in front but is scolloped out behind so you can sit down, and isn't any real improvement on an inverted coal scuttle, either for looks or for wear, or to wipe your hands on; next you belt on your sword; then you put your stove-pipe joints onto your arms, your iron gauntlets onto your hands, your iron rat-trap onto your head, with a rag of steel web hitched onto it to hang over the back of your neck--and there you are, snug as a candle in a candle-mould. This is no time to dance. Well, a man that is packed away like that is a nut that isn't worth the cracking, there is so little of the meat, when you get down to it, by comparison with the shell.|$|E
5000|$|... â€³You reach {{a certain}} age, say twenty-five, thirty, it varies with your intelligence, <b>and</b> <b>you</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> say, â€œOh, Christ, {{this is for}} nothing.

60|$|Jerome. Yes. It was in {{the garden}} you got the trance last time.

All the friars came to listen to you. We had never heard such preaching before, but it was very like heresy.|$|R
6000|$|Lawson went his oratorical way.

That was our situation, but I think that anyone, if he gets into a certain routine, in the end he gets frustrated and has no motivation." ...|$|E
