40|$|The closed-orbit {{measurement}} {{system for the}} new Antiproton Decelerator (AD) employs 59 electrostatic pick-ups (PU). The intensity range from 2 &# 183; 10 10 down to 10 7 particles poses challenging demands on the dynamic range and noise of the head amplifier. A low noiseamplifier has been developed, having an equivalent input noise of 0. 6 nV/&# 8730;(Hz), allowing beam positions to be measured to &# 177; 0. 5 mm with 5 &# 183; 10 6 particles. Two different gains {{take care of the}} large dynamic range. After amplification and multiplexing, the PU signals are fed to a network analyser, where each measurement point corresponds to one PU. The network analyser is phase locked to the RF of the AD, thus acting as a &# 0147;tracking filter&# 0148; instrument. An orbit measurement takes from 0. 2 to 12 s depending on the IF-bandwidth of the network analyser, selected according to the beam intensity, and the precision required. At the end of the network <b>analyser</b> <b>sweep</b> the data are read via a GPIB interface and treated by a real-time task running in a VME based Power PC...|$|E
