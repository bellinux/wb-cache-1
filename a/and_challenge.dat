40|$|Purpose – To justify an {{increase}} in information technology (IT) spending and to understand utilization of limited organizational resources on IT, the correlation between IT and business performance has been {{of great interest to}} business managers. However, business managers face issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> in finding out how and to what extent IT is able to deliver the intended benefits. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine IT evaluation issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> faced by information systems (IS) researchers, IS specialists, and business managers.

Findings – The eight issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> identified are: evaluation scope, evaluation timing, unit of analysis, level of analysis, different perspectives, different dimensions, different measures, and underpinning theoretical frameworks. It concludes with some suggestions on ways to improve IT evaluation practices. Originality/value – This paper posits that before a pragmatic IT evaluation approach can be developed, it is necessary to first understand the issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges</b> faced by IS researchers, IS specialists, and business managers in IT evaluation. Having identified the eight issues <b>and</b> <b>challenges,</b> this paper provides pointers on what needs to be considered when conducting IT evaluation...|$|R

40|$|Business Intelligence (BI) has {{embarked}} on decision-making setting. This has influenced many organizations from different industries that are located in diverse regions to implement BI. Critical Successful Factors (CSF) becomes the guideline for the implementer to adopt BI successfully.
