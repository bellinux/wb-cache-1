40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the relationships between firm resources and performance. We divide firm resources into two types: primary resources and support resources. Primary resources include technological <b>assets</b> <b>and</b> reconfiguration <b>capabilities,</b> which directly contribute to a firm's competitive advantage. Support resources include internal human capital, interfirm collaboration, and managerial vision, which contribute to the development of primary resources. Using a sample of 302 small-and-medium manufacturing firms in Japan, our analysis revealed that both technological <b>assets</b> <b>and</b> reconfiguration <b>capabilities</b> significantly enhanced firm performance, that the firms with superior technological assets tended to possess superior reconfiguration <b>capabilities,</b> <b>and</b> that most of the support resources significantly contributed to the development of both technological <b>assets</b> <b>and</b> reconfiguration <b>capabilities.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the relationships between digital technology, tangible/intangible <b>assets</b> <b>and</b> marketing <b>capabilities</b> to gain more insight into the factors related to small- and medium-sized enterprises’ (SMEs’) growth in the UK. Based on the resource-advantage theory, this research addresses the question “to what extent does digital technology influence marketing capability which leads to companies’ growth?” Design/methodology/approach Data were gathered through 21 in-depth interviews with managers from different multinational organizations and six focus groups with employees. Findings The study identifies the two key components of digital technology as information quality and service convenience. In addition, the relationships between digital technology, tangible/intangible <b>assets</b> <b>and</b> marketing <b>capabilities</b> perform the significant role of facilitator of a company’s growth. Research limitations/implications The focus on UK SMEs limits the generalizability of the results. Further studies should be conducted in other sectors and country settings to examine the associations identified in the current study. Originality/value This study identifies the main impacts of digital technology on intellectual/physical <b>assets.</b> While managers <b>and</b> employees have specified that marketing capability is significant for organizations, there are a few other areas of concern with regard to consequences related to a company’s growth, competence and core competence, particularly in an SME’s setting...|$|R

During the 1990s, it was determined that the <b>assets</b> <b>and</b> <b>capabilities</b> needed to complete deepwater missions were antiquated and becoming obsolete and included 93 cutters and 207 aircraft.

5000|$|United States' liquid rocket {{propulsion}} {{technology has evolved}} {{over the past five}} decades to meet the changing needs of the commercial community, agree with Department of Defense (DoD) diminishing budgets, and ensure national access to space. [...] The importance of the United States having assured access to space is best laid out by the National Presidential Directive Number 40 which states:Access to space through U.S. space transportation capabilities is essential to:# place critical United States Government <b>assets</b> <b>and</b> <b>capabilities</b> into space;# augment space-based capabilities in a timely manner in the event of increased operational needs or minimize disruptions due to on-orbit satellite failures, launch failures, or deliberate actions against U.S. space assets;# support government and commercial human space flight.The United States, therefore, must maintain robust, responsive, and resilient U.S. space transportation capabilities to assure access to space.The United States’ current solution to assure space access for operational space assets is to maintain two families of launch vehicles under the EELV program.The EELV program was initiated in 1995 as the Air Force’s premium space lift modernization program. The purpose of this program was to reduce the cost of operational space launch by 25-50% and to improve reliability over the heritage launch systems (Atlas II, Delta II, and Titan IV). Procurement of EELV boosters for military space launch was to evolve into a [...] "commercial like" [...] nature. [...] The EELV program eventually produced two families of launch vehicles as the solution to US space lift needs. These two families are the Delta IV launch system, developed by McDonnell Douglas (now The Boeing Company), and the Atlas V launch system, developed by Lockheed Martin.|$|E

In the spirit of spurring intellectual debate, this article proposes a revised framework that incorporates newer findings about the benefits of related product-diversification strategies from the strategic management literature. A differentiated view of the "media content" notion is presented that distinguishes between <b>assets,</b> skills, <b>and</b> <b>capabilities</b> <b>and</b> competencies. From this differentiated perspective, I argue that there are 2 types of scope effects: traditional economies of scope that grant the media firm a short-term competitive advantage over rivals and dynamic scope effects that contribute to a sustainable competitive advantage. ...|$|R
