We found that <b>alpha-lipoic</b> <b>acid</b> enhanced sirtuin 1 deacetylase activity through liver kinase B 1 and stimulated AMP-activated protein kinase. By activating the sirtuin 1 /liver kinase B 1 /AMP-activated protein kinase pathway, the translocation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein- 1 into the nucleus and forkhead box O 1 into the cytoplasm was prevented. <b>Alpha-lipoic</b> <b>acid</b> increased adipose triacylglycerol lipase expression and decreased fatty acid synthase abundance.

Background. Diabetic polyneuropathy {{is one of}} the most common long-term complications of diabetes. Hyperglycemias caused by ischemia and peroxidation of lipids are the presumed cause of diabetic neuropathy. Appointment of <b>alpha-lipoic</b> <b>acid</b> can restore the function of peripheral nerves, preventing the development of autonomic and trophic disorders. Objective. To determine the extent of changes in the ultrastructure of the sciatic nerve in rats with streptozotocin-induced simulated peripheral neuropathy in experimental therapy with α-lipoic acid. Methods. The research was conducted on 22 white rats divided randomly in 3 groups: group 1 – intact animals; group 2 – rats with streptozotocin-induced neuropathy; group 3 – rats with streptozotocin neuropathy + <b>alpha-lipoic</b> <b>acid.</b> Diabetes mellitus was induced in rats by a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (50 mg/kg). <b>Alpha-lipoic</b> <b>acid</b> was administered intraperitoneally and intragastrically once per day during 40 days from the 56 th day after streptozotocin injection.

40|$|Aim. The aim of {{this study}} is to assess the {{therapeutic}} efficacy of <b>alpha-lipoic</b> <b>acid</b> in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Materials and methods. 47 patients with mild to moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy were included in this trial. Dynamics of ophthalmologic parameters were assessed by means of stereoscopic photography of ocular fundus. Patients were examined every 6 months in order to register new cases of clinically significant macular oedema. Results. During 24 months follow-up period, patients treated with 600 mg of <b>alpha-lipoic</b> <b>acid</b> showed stabilization in development of diabetic retinopathy. New cases of macular oedema, as well as transition into a more severe stage of retonopathy were less common in those patients. Vision and contrast sensation also remained stable in the majority of participants from experimental group. Conclusions. 600 mg of <b>alpha-lipoic</b> <b>acid</b> may be recommended for patients with type 2 DM as part of complex therap...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010. Acne is {{a common}} disease characterised by {{follicular}} hyperkeratinisation, bacterial hipercolonisation as well as immune reactions and inflammation. In acne, reactive oxygen species (ROS) may be released from the damaged follicular walls, which could cause the advancement of inflammation in the pathogenesis of the disease. The topical application of antioxidants is a promising approach to support the endogenous antioxidant defence and avoid oxidative injury {{that may lead to}} acne. The skin provides a painless and patient-friendly approach for systemic drug administration. Transdermal drug delivery not only improves patient compliance, but also avoids the first-pass effect. The major hurdle to penetration of matter through the skin is provided by an outward layer of the skin, the stratum corneurm (SC). Overcoming this barrier safely and reversibly is a fundamental problem in the field of transdermal drug delivery. <b>Alpha-lipoic</b> <b>acid</b> was utilised as the cosmeceutical active and can be classified in a mixed category of compounds that lie between cosmetics and drugs. <b>Alpha-lipoic</b> <b>acid</b> and its reduced form, dihydrolipoic acid, have been described as the "universal antioxidants" because of their capacity to quench a number of free radicals in both aqueous and lipid environments, their metal-chelating properties and ability to restore other antioxidants from their inactive form. The Pheriod™ system is a new manner of drug delivery aimed at overcoming the barrier function of the skin. It consists of vesicular structures, the sizes of which vary from 200 - 440 nm. These vesicles, prepared from customised essential fatty acids, were found to advance the efficacy of topically administered compounds. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether the Pheroid™ delivery system would enhance the transdermal delivery of formulations containing <b>alpha-lipoic</b> <b>acid</b> to the target site by performing Franz cell diffusion studies over a 12 hour period, followed by tape-stripping experiments. The results of the formulations containing Pheroid™ were compared to those of the formulations without Pheroid™. Experimental determination of transdermal flux of the <b>alpha-lipoic</b> <b>acid</b> formulations revealed that Pheroid™ improved the transdermal delivery of <b>alpha-lipoic</b> <b>acid.</b> The average flux of Pheroid™ cream from 0 to 2 hours wass 58. 01 ± 6. 63 ug/cm 2. h. The average flux of Pheroid™ gel from 4 to 12 hours was 22. 18 ± 3. 33 ug/cm 2. h. Tape-stripping experiments proved that the concentrations of <b>alpha-lipoic</b> <b>acid</b> in Pheroid™ cream and cream that remained in the epidermis after application to the skin were 569. 10 ug/ml and 764. 93 ug/ml respectively. The concentrations of <b>alpha-lipoic</b> <b>acid</b> in Pheroid gel and gel that diffused into the dermis were 23. 62 ug/ml and 61. 06 ug/ml respectively. Aqueous solubility and log D partition coefficient of <b>alpha-lipoic</b> <b>acid</b> were determined. Inspection of the log D value of - 0. 78 indicated that the compound was unfavourable to penetrate the skin, whereas the aqueous solubility of 8. 602 mg/ml in PBS at a temperature of 32 °C indicated favourable penetration.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to examine the cardioprotective effects of <b>alpha-lipoic</b> <b>acid</b> and amlodipine against isoproterenol-induced myocardial infarction in rats. Electrocardiograph parameters were monitored, diagnostic cardiac marker enzymes and myocardial antioxidative parameters were measured. Histopathological examination of heart tissues was also performed. Subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (85 mg/kg at 24 h intervals for 2 days) to male Wistar rats induced marked alterations in ECG-patterns, as well as significant increases in serum level of creatine phosphokinase–MB (CPK-MB), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Moreover, the level of myocardial thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances was significantly increased, while reduced glutathione content and the activities of antiperoxidative enzymes [catalase and superoxide dismutase] in heart tissue were significantly decreased. Daily pre-treatment with either <b>alpha-lipoic</b> <b>acid</b> (100 mg/kg p. o.) or amlodipine (5. 0 mg/kg p. o.) for respective periods of 15 or 7 days altered almost all of the above mentioned myocardial changes induced by isoproterenol. Meanwhile, the combination of <b>alpha-lipoic</b> <b>acid</b> and amlodipine significantly reduced isoproterenol-induced elevations in diagnostic marker enzyme levels and almost restored normal ECG-patterns in experimental animals. In addition, this combination exerted a synergistic antioxidant effect by blocking the induction of lipid peroxidation. The same combination also prevented isoproterenol-induced alterations in the level of reduced glutathione and the activities of antiperoxidative enzymes. Histopathological observations were found to support these biochemical results. These findings indicate that <b>alpha-lipoic</b> <b>acid</b> and amlodipine exerted a synergistic cardioprotective effect on acute myocardial infarction induced by isoproterenol in rats...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate the effects of oral supplementation of <b>alpha-lipoic</b> <b>acid</b> (ALA) on contrast sensitivity (CS) in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T 1 DM) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM). The study included 12 patients with T 1 DM aged 43 ± 12 years, 48 patients with T 2 DM aged 59 ± 10 years, and 20 control subjects aged 33 ± 8 years. Patients from each studied group, including the control group, were randomly assigned to receive 300 mg of ALA orally once daily for 3 months. CS was evaluated with the Functional Acuity Contrast Test (FACT, Stereo Optical). In the group of patients with T 1 DM receiving ALA for 3 months CS remained stable and improved in those with T 2 DM. Reduction of CS in both T 1 DM and T 2 DM patients without <b>alpha-lipoic</b> <b>acid</b> supplementation was observed. In the control group on <b>alpha-lipoic</b> <b>acid</b> supplementation, CS improvement was noticed at one spatial frequency. Changes in the CS were observed, despite stable visual acuity and eye fundus image in all studied subjects. Our study demonstrated that oral administration of <b>alpha-lipoic</b> <b>acid</b> had influence on CS in both T 1 DM and T 2 DM patients. 1...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effects of dietary antioxidant supplementation with alpha-tocopherol and <b>alpha-lipoic</b> <b>acid</b> on cyclosporine A (cyclosporine) -induced alterations to erythrocyte and plasma redox balance. Rats were randomly assigned to either control, antioxidant (alpha-tocopherol 1000 IU/kg diet and <b>alpha-lipoic</b> <b>acid</b> 1. 6 g/kg diet), cyclosporine (25 mg/kg/day), or cyclosporine + antioxidant treatments. Cyclosporine was administered for 7 days after an 8 week feeding period. Plasma was analysed for alpha-tocopherol, total antioxidant capacity, malondialdehyde, and creatinine. Erythrocytes were analysed for glutathione, methaemoglobin, superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase, alpha-tocopherol and malondialdehye. Cyclosporine administration caused a significant decrease in superoxide dismutase activity (P 0. 05 control versus cyclosporine + antioxidant), however, supplementation did not alter the cyclosporine induced increase in plasma malondialdehyde concentration (P > 0. 05 cyclosporine versus cyclosporine + antioxidant). Antioxidant supplementation resulted in significant increases (P < 0. 05) in plasma and erythrocyte alpha-tocopherol in both of the supplemented groups compared to non-supplemented groups. In conclusion, dietary supplementation with alpha-tocopherol and <b>alpha-lipoic</b> <b>acid</b> enhanced the erythrocyte antioxidant defence and reduced nephrotoxicity in cyclosporine treated animals...|$|E
