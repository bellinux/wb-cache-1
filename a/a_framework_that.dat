5|$|Urban design {{management}} offers prescriptive advice for practitioners trying to organise city planning activities {{in a way}} that will increase sustainability by increasing satisfaction levels. Real estate development and urban planning often occur at very different decision-making levels. The practitioners involved may have diverse educational and professional backgrounds.

Providing prescriptive advice for differing, possibly conflicting, groups requires construction of <b>a</b> <b>framework</b> <b>that</b> accommodates all of their daily activities and responsibilities.

25|$|A Scheffler cooker (named {{after its}} inventor, Wolfgang Scheffler) uses a large ideally {{paraboloidal}} reflector which is rotated around an axis that is {{parallel with the}} earth's using a mechanical mechanism, turning at 15 degrees per hour {{to compensate for the}} earth's rotation. The axis passes through the reflector's centre of mass, allowing the reflector to be turned easily. The cooking vessel is located at the focus which is on the axis of rotation, so the mirror concentrates sunlight onto it all day. The mirror has to be occasionally tilted about a perpendicular axis to compensate for the seasonal variation in the sun's declination. This perpendicular axis does not pass through the cooking vessel. Therefore, if the reflector were a rigid paraboloid, its focus would not remain stationary at the cooking vessel as the reflector tilts. To keep the focus stationary, the reflector's shape has to vary. It remains paraboloidal, but its focal length and other parameters change as it tilts. The Scheffler reflector is therefore flexible, and can be bent to adjust its shape. It is often made up {{of a large number of}} small plane sections, such as glass mirrors, joined together by flexible plastic. <b>A</b> <b>framework</b> <b>that</b> supports the reflector includes a mechanism that can be used to tilt it and also bend it appropriately. The mirror is never exactly paraboloidal, but it is always close enough for cooking purposes.|$|E

500|$|In 1975, in {{a seminal}} paper, Minsky noted {{that many of}} his fellow [...] "scruffy" [...] {{researchers}} were using the same kind of tool: <b>a</b> <b>framework</b> <b>that</b> captures all our common sense assumptions about something. For example, if we use the concept of a bird, there is a constellation of facts that immediately come to mind: we might assume that it flies, eats worms and so on. We know these facts are not always true and that deductions using these facts will not be [...] "logical", but these structured sets of assumptions are part of the context of everything we say and think. He called these structures [...] "frames". Schank used a version of frames he called [...] "scripts" [...] to successfully answer questions about short stories in English. Many years later object-oriented programming would adopt the essential idea of [...] "inheritance" [...] from AI research on frames.|$|E
500|$|Since the Mass Effect {{series was}} envisioned as a trilogy from its inception, work on Mass Effect 2 started {{shortly before the}} {{original}} Mass Effect was released. The game was initially developed exclusively for the Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 platforms with {{the same level of}} dedication. As a result, each version of the game features different user interfaces and controls. Like its predecessor, Mass Effect 2 was built using Epic Games' Unreal Engine 3 in conjunction with <b>a</b> <b>framework</b> <b>that</b> BioWare specifically developed for the Mass Effect games. As most of these Mass Effect technologies were already developed in the first game, the development team focused on adding a lot of new content and perfecting new features rather than creating them from scratch. Technical improvements included better memory management, greater textures, a higher frame rate, and better lighting scenarios. According to Hudson, [...] "I actually can't think of an aspect of the game that we haven't overhauled and made 100% better." ...|$|E
500|$|Alberta's {{first years}} as a {{province}} were optimistic ones, and one way that this optimism manifested itself was in a desire for railroads. [...] The public, media, and politicians all called for the rapid development of new lines and expansion of existing ones. [...] Rutherford's Liberals had set up <b>a</b> <b>framework</b> <b>that</b> allowed almost anybody to enter the railroad business, but few firms had done so by 1909. [...] The opposition Conservatives called for the government's direct entry into the industry. [...] Rutherford's government instead opted for a regime of loan guarantees: the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway and the Canadian Northern Railway (CNR) had their bonds, which were to pay 4% per year over their thirty-year term, guaranteed {{at a rate of}} $13,000 per mile of railway constructed. [...] The legislature had the right to increase this to $15,000. [...] In exchange, the railways were subject to a minimum rate of line construction: the CNR was required to build [...] and the Grand Trunk Railway [...] before the end of 1909.|$|E

500|$|The {{works of}} French comic book creator Fabrice Neaud have been {{described}} as the [...] "most ambitious autobiographical comics project yet published". These include his 1994 series Ego Comme X and the ongoing Journal, of which Neaud has self-published one volume every other year since 1996. The works chronicle day to day experiences and place them in <b>a</b> <b>framework</b> <b>that</b> examines representation and self-identity of sexual-minorities and the creative process. Volumes one and three focus on the author's homosexuality and status as a struggling gay artist in French small-town life: One story arc covered Neaud's unrequited love for a male friend. Neaud's works have been pointed to as examples that legitimised comics as serious literature, and elevated the regard for autobiographical works within comics. The retrospective and subjective nature of the works leads to significant emotional events being afforded greater coverage, with the result that issues of sexuality and interactions between the author and other men are highlighted, reflecting the importance of sexuality to identity. This has led critic (and character) Dominque Goblet to dismiss the works as trivial; such criticisms have been attributed to bias against autobiography or comics, or inability to identify with a gay character.|$|E
500|$|The broad {{theoretical}} framework for current versions of RAD is attachment theory, based on work conducted from the 1940s to the 1980s by John Bowlby, Mary Ainsworth and René Spitz. Attachment theory is <b>a</b> <b>framework</b> <b>that</b> employs psychological, ethological and evolutionary concepts to explain social behaviors typical of young children. Attachment theory {{focuses on the}} tendency of infants or children to seek proximity to a particular attachment figure (familiar caregiver), in situations of alarm or distress, [...] behavior which appears to have survival value. This {{is known as a}} discriminatory or selective attachment. Subsequently, the child begins to use the caregiver as a base of security from which to explore the environment, returning periodically to the familiar person. Attachment {{is not the same as}} love and/or affection although they are often associated. Attachment and attachment behaviors tend to develop between the ages of six months and three years. Infants become attached to adults who are sensitive and responsive in social interactions with the infant, and who remain as consistent caregivers for some time. Caregiver responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment, that in turn lead to internal working models which will guide the individual's feelings, thoughts, and expectations in later relationships. For a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder, the child's history and atypical social behavior must suggest the absence of formation of a discriminatory or selective attachment.|$|E
