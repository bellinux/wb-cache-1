40|$|We {{present a}} BDI-based {{framework}} for a cognitive agent {{that acts as}} an assistant to a human user by performing tasks on her behalf. This framework accommodates: (1) user delegation of tasks to the agent, which may be inconsistent or infeasible or both, and (2) user-specified guidance and preferences on the execution and management of these tasks, which we call advice. Within this delegative BDI model, we propose a combined mechanism for the problems of goal adoption and commitment revision, with the aim of a well-founded, practical framework for an <b>assistive</b> <b>agent</b> with extended life-cycle...|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} our ongoing {{practical}} experience in designing, implementing, and deploying PTIME, a personalized agent for time management and meeting scheduling in an open, multi-agent environment. In developing PTIME {{as part of}} a larger <b>assistive</b> <b>agent</b> called CALO, we have faced numerous challenges, including usability, multi-agent coordination, scalable constraint reasoning, robust execution, and unobtrusive learning. Our research advances basic solutions to the fundamental problems; however, integrating PTIME into a deployed system has raised other important issues for the successful adoption of new technology. As a personal assistant, PTIME must integrate easily into a user’s real environment, support her normal workflow, respect her authority and privacy, provide natural user interfaces, and handle the issues that arise with deploying such a system in an open environment...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{our experience}} of designing the educational collaborative role-play game ORIENT with a special focus on the multimodal interaction used in the game. The idea behind ORIENT is to try increasing a user’s intercultural empathy through role-play set in a science fiction narrative in which the users have to befriend an alien race, the Sprytes. The Sprytes are virtual characters that communicate with the users through a mix of gestures and natural language. We explain how the choice and design of those output modalities was driven by choice of interaction technology. We also show how the user’s perception of the Spryte’s behaviour could be enhanced through the inclusion of an <b>assistive</b> <b>agent,</b> the ORACLE and report {{on a small scale}} evaluation of the system and its interaction technology...|$|E

In two experiments with a robotic agent and a screen agent (both n = 30) this {{relationship between these}} two concepts could be confirmed. In addition, both studies showed that social presence correlates with the Intention to Use the system, although there were some differences between the agents. This implicates that factors that influence social presence are relevant when designing <b>assistive</b> <b>agents</b> for elderly people...|$|R

40|$|Although play is {{recognized}} as the main drive for the child's physical, cognitive and social development, it is first of all a unique source of pleasure, fun and recreation. Playfulness, the individual intrinsic involvement in play {{has been described as}} a measurable characteristic of these aspects of play. Play and playfulness can be limited in children with physical impairment (PI) and robotic toys might offer good options and opportunities for playing. Five robotic toys of the mainstream market were proposed to seven children with PI to verify their playfulness and their usability. Playfulness was coded according to the Test of Playfulness (Bundy & Skard, 1997). Results show that all the robots were playful and interesting to the children; however, the role of the adult expert play companion proved crucial both as <b>assistive</b> <b>agent</b> and as a scaffolding partner, to assure a high level of playfulness to the play activity. A first discussion proposal of the results on the basis of the playfulness construct and of their constituent elements is presented, with the aim of laying the foundations for new reflections and deepening studies in the field of play and children with disabilities...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} {{modeling}} approach {{to develop an}} agent that assists users discreetly in teleoperation when ava-teering a robot via an inexpensive motion sensor. Avateering is a powerful metaphor, and {{can be an effective}} teleoperating strategy. Avateering a Humanoid Robot (HR) with no wearable device encumberment, such as using the popular Kinect/NUI motion sensor, is also desirable and very promising. However, this control scheme makes it difficult for the slave robot to make contact and interact with objects with high accuracy due to factors such as viewpoint, individually-unique and unilateral human-side control imprecision, and lack of informative tactile feedback. Our research explores the addition of an <b>assistive</b> <b>agent</b> that arbitrates user input without disrupting the overall experience and expectation. Additionally, our agent assists with maintaining a higher level of accuracy for interaction tasks, in our case, a grasping and lifting scenario. Using the Webots robot simulator, we implemented 4 assistive agents to augment the user in avateering the Darwin-OP robot. The agent iterations are described, and results of a user study are presented. We discuss user perception towards the avateering metaphor when enhanced by the agent and also when unassisted, including perceived easiness of the task, responsiveness of the robot, and accuracy.

40|$|AbstractAssistive {{robotics}} may extend capabilities {{for individuals}} with reduced mobility or dexterity. However, effective use of robotic agents typically requires the user to issue control commands {{in the form of}} speech, gesture, or text. Thus, for unskilled or impaired users, the need for a paradigm of intuitive Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) is prevalent. It can be inferred that the most productive interactions are those in which the <b>assistive</b> <b>agent</b> is able to ascertain the intention of the user. Also, to perform a task, the agent must know the user's area of attention in three-dimensional space. Eye gaze tracking {{can be used as a}} method to determine a specific Volume of Interest (VOI). However, gaze tracking has heretofore been under-utilized as a means of interaction and control in 3 D space. This research aims to determine a practical volume of interest in which an individual's eyes are focused by combining past methods in order to achieve greater effectiveness. The proposed method makes use of eye vergence as a useful depth discriminant to generate a tool for improved robot path planning. This research investigates the accuracy of the Vector Intersection (VI) model when applied to a usably large workspace volume. A neural network is also used in tandem with the VI model to create a combined model. The output of the combined model is a VOI that can be used as an aid in a number of applications including robot path planning, entertainment, ubiquitous computing, and others...|$|E

Our model for proactive assistance employs a meta-level layer to identify potentially helpful actions and determine when it is appropriate to perform them. We conclude by identifying technical challenges in developing systems that embody proactive behaviors. ...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimited. This paper presents evidence that operational video-teleconference-room (VTC) interfaces contribute to delaying {{the start of}} meetings in corporate settings. Some companies rely on VTCs for cost-effective collaboration across locations; however, if VTCs contribute to meeting delays, they result in lost productivity for entire teams. To explore this notion, the team recorded observations of human subjects in corporate VTC meetings, and identified the various challenges in collecting user-interface data in that environment. The analysis and discussion shows that improvement in equipment setup times would contribute to reducing the delay in meeting start times. Furthermore, evidence points to {{the significance of the}} time equipment-use begins, rather than the time it ceases. The data collected is vital to continue research into intelligent user interfaces, <b>assistive</b> <b>agents,</b> and context modeling for improving the usability of VTC equipment.

The research in this paper develops and tests an adaptation and theoretical extension of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) by explaining intent to use {{not only in terms}} of variables related to functional evaluation like perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, but also variables that relate to social interaction. The new model was tested using controlled experiment and longitudinal data collected regarding three different social agents at elderly care facilities and at the homes of older adults. The model was strongly supported accounting for 59 - 79 % of the variance in usage intentions and 49 - 59 % of the variance in actual use. These findings contribute to our understanding of how elderly users accept <b>assistive</b> social <b>agents...</b>|$|R
40|$|The ROBOCARE Domestic Environment (RDE) is {{the result}} of a three-year project aimed at {{developing}} cognitive support technology for elderly people. Specifically, the domestic environment is equipped with sensors, intelligent software components and devices which cooperate to provide cognitive support to the assisted person. The ROBOCARE interaction capabilities have been concentrated in a robotic mediator who acts as the main communication channel between the users and the intelligent domestic environment. This paper presents an evaluation of elderly people 2 ̆ 7 s perception of assistive robots and smart domotic environments. Results show how the acceptability of robotic devices in home settino does not depend only on the practical benefits they can provide, but also on complex relationships between the cognitive, affective and emotional components of people 2 ̆ 7 s images of robot. Specially, we analyzes a number of evaluation criteria related to the robot 2 ̆ 7 s aspect, the way in which it communicates with the user, and the perceived usefulness of its support services. Among these criteria, the paper proposes and reports an evaluation of how perceived frailty, with reference to both health in general and fear of cognitive weakening, more specifically, can influence the evaluation of a potential aid in everyday life, namely the robotic assistant.

40|$|Abstract-The {{advent of}} more {{portable}} and affordable sens-ing devices has facilitated {{the study of}} rehabilitation robotics. Critical to the further development of therapies and inter-ventions are low-cost, easy-to-use devices {{that can be applied}} in clinical and home care settings. In this paper, we present a low-cost motion capture system that relies on the open-source Player/Stage software development environment, and can be used in conjunction with a socially <b>assistive</b> robotic <b>agent</b> (or a computer interface) for various types of motor task rehabilitation training. We describe the hardware and soft-ware development for the device, and the activity recognition algorithm we developed to capture the relevant motion data. We present the overall framework in which this system can be adapted to other motor task-based rehabilitation regimens. Finally, we present initial experimental data in the domain of gait rehabilitation, in which we use the system to estimate cadence, walking speed, and stride length. I...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{vision that}} drives {{this work is}} that humans and robots working {{together}} as peers in a team setting can accomplish complex tasks that are not possible with current technology. However, maximizing robustness and efficiency in these teams is non-trivial. A key requirement for effective coordination {{is the ability to}} dynamically adjust the level of autonomy of the team to accommodate different situations and failures, and also to optimize the use of the team capabilities in different settings. While the notion of sliding autonomy is well studied in cases where a single human is working with a single robot and in the case where humans are working with <b>assistive</b> software <b>agents,</b> the methodology for sliding autonomy in the case of humans working with multiple robots is largely unexplored. This paper builds upon related work in sliding autonomy for teams to explore the challenges and provide a methodology for sliding autonomy in the setting of peer-to-peer human-robot teams. First results are reported for a heterogeneous peer-to-peer human-robot team engaged in a treasure hunt task...|$|R
40|$|Medication intake {{can prove}} a {{complicated}} {{task for the}} elderly. Since roughly 50 % of all prescribed medication is taken incorrectly (MacLaughlin, et al., 2005), simplification of this task might have beneficial effects on this group’s general health and society’s healthcare costs. In response, Assistobot Corporation has commissioned the present study alongside its development of an assistive robot for the elderly, called RITA (the Reliable Interactive Table Assistant). The {{aim of this study}} was twofold: Firstly to develop a robot interface to assist the elderly with their medication intake. Secondly, to investigate whether the target group is willing to accept medication intake assistance from a robot. In order to fully map the process involved and so prepare for the initial stages of development, caregivers were interviewed about the medication intake task. The responses were analyzed and served to guide the development of the robot interface. The caregivers indicated that it was important for them to check whether the elderly actually took their medication. Wireframes were created before the actual interface was developed. A focus group was asked to provide feedback on the clarity of the design, and whether it met their requirements. Our test group found that the font size should be increased for optimal utility. The interface was developed in HTML 5 and tested in a user study which consisted of a usability test and the post-study Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) (Lewis, 1992). The questionnaire was extended with an acceptance questionnaire to investigate whether elderly would accept a robot to assist them with their medication intake. This questionnaire was based on the ALMERE-model (Heerink, Krose, Evers, & Wielinga, 2010) (Xu, et al., 2014). The usability test showed that the majority of participants in this study (17 out of 19) were able to take their medication with assistance of the interface. However, they found it difficult to work certain interface settings, such as those concerning the notifications interval or their pharmacy's contact details. Furthermore, on a five-point Likert scale, the PSSUQ resulted in a mean score of 3. 9 (between 'Neutral' and 'Agree'); the Robot Acceptance Questionnaire scored a 3. 5. Along with the results of the usability test, the questionnaire findings indicate that the interface could be used by the elderly for assistance with the medication intake task and {{that they are willing to}} accept assistance of a robot with this task in the future.
