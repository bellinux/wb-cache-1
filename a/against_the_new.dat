25|$|<b>The</b> <b>News</b> of <b>the</b> World royal phone hacking scandal {{had raised}} {{evidence}} of victims being targeted outside the Royal Family, but this evidence {{did not lead}} to criminal proceedings.

Those who began legal action included the football agent Sky Andrew, actress Sienna Miller, actor Steve Coogan, television presenter Chris Tarrant and football pundit Andy Gray. In December 2009, footballer Sol Campbell instructed his solicitor to contact the police in response to various media reports. The Max Clifford case, which in early 2010 had appeared to make likely the disclosure of previously secret <b>News</b> of <b>the</b> World documents, was settled out of court in March 2010, keeping the documents secret.
