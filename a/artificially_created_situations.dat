All in a Day is the diary of a day through the actions of four real characters. The format's concept is to bring together four points of view, as diverse as possible, within a context of a specific event, limited to a 24-hour period. The show's narrative device {{is similar to that}} ascribed to [...] "real television", however in All in a Day it is applied to an absolute reality: there are no selected contestants tested in <b>artificially</b> <b>created</b> <b>situations,</b> such as an island or an apartment; instead there are the lives of four real people, their four distinct viewpoints of one particular day, which is revealed through their tensions, faces, words, and feelings. With the TV screen split in four, the characters’ stories unfold simultaneously. When one individual’s prospective emerges as more riveting, his story takes over, filling the entire screen temporarily, and then it returns to its original small quarter screen, [...] "passing the scene" [...] to another protagonist. The Herald Tribune saluted the show with an article titled [...] "Braking the rules of TV conformism"All in a Day won the Anart Award for best TV program in 2001.|$|E

We investigated the foraging strategies of individuals with respect to their social position in the group in a flock of nonbreeding, moulting barnacle geese, Branta leucopsis, on high Arctic Spitsbergen. We first determined the dominance rank of individually marked birds. The dominance of an individual was best described by its age and its sex-specific body mass. Mating status explained the large variation in dominance among younger birds, as unpaired yearlings ranked lowest. In an <b>artificially</b> <b>created,</b> competitive <b>situation,</b> subordinate individuals occupied explorative front positions in the flock and-were the first to-find sites with experimentally enriched vegetation. Nevertheless, they were displaced quickly from these favourable sites by more dominant geese which were able to monopolize them. The enhanced sites were subsequently visited preferentially by individuals that succeeded in feeding there when the exclosures were first opened. Data on walking speed of foraging individuals and nearest-neighbour distances in the group suggest that subordinates try to compensate for a lower energy intake by exploring and by lengthening the foraging bout. Observations of our focal birds during the following breeding season revealed that females that returned to the study area were significantly more dominant in the previous year than those not seen in the area again.
