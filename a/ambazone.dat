50|$|Through {{experimental}} testing <b>ambazone</b> {{has shown}} antiseptic properties, along with anti-tumor properties. <b>Ambazone</b> has the following physical characteristics.|$|E
50|$|The mode {{of action}} for <b>ambazone</b> has been studied {{extensively}} and {{has been shown to}} react via different methods. <b>Ambazone</b> shows low mutagenic activity and no cardiovascular, CNS, metabolic, or gastrointestinal side-effects with I.V. doses up to 10-5 mol/kg and oral doses up to 10-3 mol/kg. <b>Ambazone</b> can be administered via oral or I.V. administration, but the problem with oral administration is that one experimental study shows there is only a 35-50% absorption while another study shows 40% in the intestines; These results would tend to lead the reader to think that <b>ambazone</b> would not be the best choice for treatment, because with such a low absorbance, there {{is going to have to}} be a greater concentration ingested to gain a positive effect from the drug. The problem with a greater concentration is that <b>ambazone</b> has a half-life of 6-7 hours. It was stated above that <b>ambazone</b> possess no CNS side-effects due to the fact, that it will not cross the blood brain barrier. Although this is the body’s way of protecting unwanted substances from attacking the brain, this also limits the treatment of brain tumors with <b>ambazone.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Ambazone</b> is an oral antiseptic.|$|E
50|$|The {{therapeutic}} properties of <b>ambazone</b> were studied in lab rats and the therapeutic dose {{was determined to}} be 60-125 mg/kg of body weight. As stated above, <b>ambazone</b> possesses anti-septic properties shown by its increased activity against gram-positive cocci. Along with anti-septic properties, <b>ambazone</b> has also shown its ability to fight forms of leukemia in lab rats. When administered orally the results showed prolongation of life expectancy and curing of L1210 and P388 leukemia in lab rats. Scientist used different methods to determine the results, such as; mean survival time (MST), percent increase of life span, survival rates, percent change in body weights and number of peritoneal cells. When testing <b>ambazone</b> via AMES with no metabolic activation we find there are no mutagenic or carcinogenic properties. When the same test is performed with metabolic activation or when the C-Test is performed we do see the potential for mutagenicity. The results show two different paths and until further testing has been performed we cannot determine if the good outweighs the bad when it comes to using <b>ambazone</b> for treatment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ambazone</b> is {{prepared}} {{by way of}} solid based crystallization or grinding.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ambazone</b> can be {{obtained}} in a two step synthetic method, reacting 1,4-benzochinone with aminoguanidine and thiosemicarbazide.|$|E
40|$|Tyrosinase catalyzes two {{distinct}} sequential reactions in melanin biosynthesis: The hydroxylation of tyrosine to dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) and the oxidation of DOPA to dopaquinone. Developing functional modulators of tyrosinase {{is important for}} therapeutic and cosmetic purposes. Given the abundance of thiourea moiety in known tyrosinase inhibitors, we studied other thiourea-containing drugs as potential tyrosinase inhibitors. The thiourea-containing drugs in clinical use were retrieved and tested {{for their ability to}} inhibit tyrosinase. We observed that methimazole, thiouracil, methylthiouracil, propylthiouracil, <b>ambazone,</b> and thioacetazone inhibited mushroom tyrosinase. Except for methimazole, there was limited information regarding the activity of other drugs against tyrosinase. Both thioacetazone and <b>ambazone</b> significantly inhibited tyrosinase, with IC 50 of 14 and 15 μM, respectively. <b>Ambazone</b> decreased melanin content without causing cellular toxicity at 20 μM in B 16 F 10 cells. The activity of <b>ambazone</b> was stronger than that of kojic acid both in enzyme and melanin content assays. Kinetics of enzyme inhibition assigned the thiourea-containg drugs as non-competitive inhibitors. The complex models by docking simulation suggested that the intermolecular hydrogen bond via the nitrogen of thiourea and the contacts via thione were equally important for interacting with tyrosinase. These data were consistent with the results of enzyme assays with the analogues of thiourea...|$|E
