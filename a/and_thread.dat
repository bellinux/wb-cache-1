5|$|Two days later, Tuesday 23 February, Gothenburg passed Cooktown {{at about}} 2:00pm. The {{wind and rain}} {{severely}} increased and cloud cover became so thick it blocked out the sun. Despite this, she continued the journey south into worsening weather, in a deep water passage between the North Queensland coastline and the Great Barrier Reef, known as the inner route. Although taking this route provided some protection from the open sea, captains had to navigate <b>and</b> <b>thread</b> {{their way through a}} number of then uncharted reefs. All passengers and crew expected to be in Newcastle on Sunday evening for a scheduled stopover.|$|E

The wound is now ready to be stitched or for thorns to be applied. If a needle <b>and</b> <b>thread</b> are being used, close tight sutures will be placed to ensure that a flap of skin covers the vulva and extends from the mons veneris to the perineum, and which, after the wound heals, will form a bridge of scar tissue that will totally occlude the vaginal introitus.|$|E
5|$|The {{object of}} the game is to collect the eight pieces of the Android Queen's body then stitch her back {{together}} again. The player must first find and approach the refrigerator in order to be told where the first body part can be found. Once this has been returned to the player's trapped father, the next body part location will be revealed. Once all eight body parts have been collected and returned to the refrigerator, the player must find a needle <b>and</b> <b>thread</b> in order to restore the Android Queen. The location of the refrigerator is randomized {{at the beginning of each}} new game.|$|E

5|$|Giraffes were {{probably}} common targets for hunters throughout Africa. Different {{parts of their}} bodies were used for different purposes. Their meat was used for food. The tail hairs served as flyswatters, bracelets, necklaces <b>and</b> <b>thread.</b> Shields, sandals and drums were made using the skin, and the strings of musical instruments were from the tendons. The smoke from burning giraffe skins {{was used by the}} medicine men of Buganda to treat nose bleeds. The Humr people of Sudan consume the drink Umm Nyolokh; which is created from the liver and marrow of giraffes. Umm Nyolokh often contains DMT and other psychoactive substances from plants the giraffes eat such as Acacia; and is known to cause hallucinations of giraffes, believed to be the giraffes' ghosts by the Humr. In the 19th century, European explorers began to hunt them for sport. Habitat destruction has hurt the giraffe, too: in the Sahel, the need for firewood and grazing room for livestock has led to deforestation. Normally, giraffes can coexist with livestock, since they do not directly compete with them.|$|E

25|$|Efforts {{to expand}} the size and number of coral reefs {{generally}} involve supplying substrate to allow more corals to find a home. Substrate materials include discarded vehicle tires, scuttled ships, subway cars, and formed concrete, such as reef balls. Reefs also grow unaided on marine structures such as oil rigs. In large restoration projects, propagated hermatypic coral on substrate can be secured with metal pins, superglue or milliput. Needle <b>and</b> <b>thread</b> can also attach A-hermatype coral to substrate.|$|E

25|$|Clothing {{and shoes}} were quickly rationed as shops sold out. Jersey opened the Summerland factory to make clothes out of blankets, {{curtains}} and sheets. Nothing was thrown away, knitted objects were unravelled and remade. Other clothes were patched and repaired. Clothes in houses {{that belonged to}} evacuated people were requisitioned. As people lost weight due to the diet, new clothes needed to be found or clothes adjusted. Elastic supplies ran out. Shortages of needles <b>and</b> <b>thread</b> were relieved with supplies from France.|$|E
25|$|There is some {{industry}} there, which employs {{about a third}} of the workforce. The main ones are Los Molinos de la Covadonga, La Harinera Amecameca, Hilos Cadena, which produced milled products <b>and</b> <b>thread.</b> In addition, there are small workshops which produce saddles, ironwork and machine pieces. Most commerce occurs in the municipal seat, mostly with the sale of staple foods and other basic necessities. Market days are Monday, Wednesday and Sunday when the town is covered in portable stalls in a tradition called the tianguis. In addition, there are several hotels and other businesses that cater to tourists. This sector of the economy employ about 45% of the municipality’s population.|$|E
25|$|Most {{banknotes}} {{are made}} using the mould made {{process in which}} a watermark <b>and</b> <b>thread</b> is incorporated during the paper forming process. The thread is a simple looking security component found in most banknotes. It is however often rather complex in construction comprising fluorescent, magnetic, metallic and micro print elements. By combining it with watermarking technology the thread {{can be made to}} surface periodically on one side only. This is known as windowed thread and further increases the counterfeit resistance of the banknote paper. This process was invented by Portals, part of the De La Rue group in the UK. Other related methods include watermarking {{to reduce the number of}} corner folds by strengthening this part of the note, coatings to reduce the accumulation of dirt on the note, and plastic windows in the paper that make it very hard to copy.|$|E

25|$|As of July 2015, the Philippine Passport {{is printed}} in Asian Productivity Organization or APO Productions under the Presidential Communications Group. On August 15, 2016, the new {{generation}} e-passport was released by the Department of Foreign Affairs with advanced security features such as the upgraded microchip to capture the personal data of the applicant, invisible ultraviolet (UV) fluorescent ink <b>and</b> <b>thread,</b> and elaborate design when subject to UV light. Security inks were also used to print the passports to prevent forgery. These inks include intaglio, which are visible inks that have a distinct ridged feel and ultraviolet ink that appears when exposed to infrared lights. Other security features include watermarks, perforated passport numbering, embedded security fibers, among others. Aside from making the new e-passport tamper-proof, each leaf of the 44-page document depicts Philippine artifacts, cultural icons, historic places, renowned tourist destinations, and even lyrics of the national anthem.|$|E
25|$|Thread forming <b>and</b> <b>thread</b> rolling are {{processes}} for forming screw threads, {{with the former}} referring to creating internal threads and the latter external threads. In both of these processes threads are formed into a blank by pressing a shaped tool, commonly called a 'thread rolling die' against the blank, in a process similar to knurling. These processes are used for large production runs because typical production rates are around one piece per second. Forming and rolling produce no swarf and less material is required because the blank size starts smaller than a blank required for cutting threads; there is typically a 15 to 20% material savings in the blank, by weight. A rolled thread can be easily recognized on fasteners that were formed from an unstopped blank because the thread has a larger diameter than the blank rod from which it has been made; however, necks and undercuts can be cut or rolled onto blanks with threads that are not rolled, and some fasteners are made from blanks with a reduced shank {{in the region to}} be rolled to maintain a constant major diameter from thread to unthreaded shank. Unless faced off, the end threads of a rolled fastener have a cupped end, as the surplus material in the tapering down final threads collapses uniformly over the end of the blank.|$|E
500|$|Among prior works, the artist's 2014 {{exhibition}} at the London Mosaic Rooms featured a video piece, No, [...] in which a disembodied mouth chants questions from an immigration visa interrogation, to which church congregants chant the replies. The video installation had previously debuted at the 2012 Liverpool Biennale. Kaabi-Linke's 2015 solo show at the Dallas Contemporary explored themes of international borders. A performance at the show ran its duration, wherein volunteers circled two poles while unraveling the 3,000 kilometers of thread, to create a symbolic wall that represents {{the length of the}} border the United States shares with Mexico. In an interview, she said that she was interested in the recent resurgence of geopolitical borders, such as the Mexico–United States border and the separation of the Islamic and Western worlds. She also reflected on her own experiences with immigration bureaucracies. As part of her practice, Kaabi-Linke takes prints of city walls, which she finds expressive of the city's history. Hyperallergic described Kaabi-Linke's six Dallas pieces as having high conceptual impact for addressing heavy political themes (e.g., politics of borders, identity, and military) with delicate media (e.g., hair, language, <b>and</b> <b>thread).</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{stitching}} of {{the binding}} uses [...] "Coptic sewing", that is [...] "flexible unsupported sewing (produced by two needles <b>and</b> <b>thread</b> looping round {{one another in}} a figure-of-eight sewing pattern)" [...] Coptic sewing uses small threads both to attach the leaves together and, knotted together, to attach the pages to the cover boards. Normal Western binding uses thread for the former and thicker cord running across the spine of the book for the latter, with the thread knotted onto the cords. [...] Coptic sewing is also found in the earliest surviving leather bookbindings, which are from Coptic libraries in Egypt from the 7th and 8th centuries; in particular the design of the cover of one in the Morgan Library (MS M.569) has been compared to the St Cuthbert Gospel. [...] In the techniques used in the binding, apart from the raised decoration, the closest resemblance is to an even smaller Irish pocket gospel book from some 50 years later, the Cadmug Gospels at Fulda, which is believed to have belonged to Saint Boniface. [...] This is also in red goatskin, with coloured incised lines, and uses a similar unsupported or cordless stitching technique. [...] The first appearance of the cords or supports that these [...] "unsupported" [...] bindings lack is found in two other books at Fulda, and they soon became universal in, and characteristic of, Western bookbinding until the arrival of modern machine techniques. [...] The cords run horizontally across the spine, and are thicker than the threads that hold the pages together. [...] They are attached, typically by lacing through holes or glue, to the two boards of the cover, and the threads holding the gatherings are knotted to them, resulting in a stronger binding.|$|E
