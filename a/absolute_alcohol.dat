25|$|The medieval Muslims {{used the}} {{distillation}} process extensively, and applied {{it to the}} distillation of alcohol. The Arab chemist Al-Kindi unambiguously described the distillation of wine in the 9th century. The process later spread from the Middle East to Italy. Production of alcohol from distilled wine was later recorded by the School of Salerno alchemists in the 12th century. Mention of <b>absolute</b> <b>alcohol,</b> in contrast with alcohol-water mixtures, was later made by Raymond Lull in the 14th century.|$|E
25|$|Absolute or {{anhydrous}} alcohol refers to ethanol {{with a low}} water content. There are various grades with maximum water contents ranging from 1% to a few parts per million (ppm) levels. If azeotropic distillation is used to remove water, it will contain trace amounts of the material separation agent (e.g. benzene). <b>Absolute</b> <b>alcohol</b> is not intended for human consumption. Absolute ethanol {{is used as a}} solvent for laboratory and industrial applications, where water will react with other chemicals, and as fuel alcohol. Spectroscopic ethanol is an absolute ethanol with a low absorbance in ultraviolet and visible light, fit for use as a solvent in ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy.|$|E

40|$|The {{clinical}} and histopathological effects of two alcoholic neurolytics were studied in horses. Normal horses were shod with a designed shoe adaptted with 5 screws to produce solar pain. After gait and lameness score analysis, the palmar nerve of 5 horses was injected with 5 ml of 0, 75 % benzyl alcohol (Group A) and 5 horses were injected with 5 ml of <b>absolute</b> ethyl <b>alcohol</b> (Group B). The animals were submitted to regular lameness evaluation and solar sensibility tests during next six months. The solar sensitivity returned 5 months latter {{in the group}} injected with benzyl alcohol 0, 75 %, while in the group injected with <b>absolute</b> ethyl <b>alcohol,</b> the sole was still desensitized 6 months latter. The histopathological findings showed that the nerve injected with benzyl alcohol 0, 75 %, resulted in axonotmesis, characterized by axonal nerve degeneration, with possibilities for the nerve conduction recovery. The perineural injection of ethyl <b>alcohol</b> <b>absolute,</b> resulted in neurotmesis with difficult nerve regeneration. It was concluded that chemical neurolysis with alcohol is an option for temporary or permanent nerve blocks in horses...|$|R
40|$|The rate of {{penetration}} of the simpler alcohols into brine shrimp cysts and cucumber seeds was studied. In solutions below 70 % the rate of penetration is related to lipid solvent capacity of the alcohol. In concentrations above 70 %, particularly in <b>absolute</b> <b>alcohols,</b> methanol penetrates brine shrimp rapidly and ethanol penetrates slowly. All the other alcohols tested did not penetrate the dormant structures. Ethionine and deuteroxy-methanol {{did not affect the}} rate of {{penetration of}} methanol. It is suggested that in dehydrated membranes the lipid moiety is protected by a continuous sheet of protein. Methanol, which is fairly similar to water, is probably able to penetrate the membrane by initiating a conformation change in the protein, exposing the lipid which subsequently dissolves in the methanol thus destroying the membrane...|$|R

50|$|Murexide (NH4C8H4N5O6, or C8H5N5O6·NH3), {{also called}} {{ammonium}} purpurate or MX, is the ammonium salt of purpuric acid. It may be prepared by heating alloxantin in ammonia gas to 100 °C, or by boiling uramil (5-aminobarbituric acid) with mercury oxide. W.N. Hartley found considerable difficulty in obtaining specimens of murexide sufficiently pure to give concordant results when examined {{by means of}} their absorption spectra, and consequently devised a new method of preparation for murexide. In this process alloxantin is dissolved in a large excess of boiling <b>absolute</b> <b>alcohol,</b> and dry ammonia gas is passed into the solution for about three hours. The solution is then filtered from the precipitated murexide, which is washed with <b>absolute</b> <b>alcohol</b> and dried. The salt obtained {{in this way is}} in the anhydrous state.
