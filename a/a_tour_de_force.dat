Also of importance is the Becket Casket dated c1180 to contain relics of St Thomas Becket, made from gilt copper, with enamelled scenes of the saint's martyrdom. Another highlight is the 1351 Reichenau Crozier. The Burghley Nef, a salt-cellar, French, dated 1527–28, uses a nautilus shell to form the hull of a vessel, which rests on {{the tail of a}} parcelgilt mermaid, who rests on a hexagonal gilt plinth on six claw-and-ball feet.

Before the recording session took part, the main voice actors of the show (Dan Castellaneta, Harry Shearer, Julie Kavner, Yeardley Smith, Nancy Cartwright, and Hank Azaria) sat down with executive producer David Mirkin and a crew of writers at a table reading to determine what shape the script was in. There was [...] "genuine hearty laughter at various points" [...] during the script run-through, said Ray Richmond, a reporter for the Los Angeles Daily News. Immediately after the reading, the crew of writers hurried to make script changes based on what got laughs and what did not, while the actors waited impatiently. Mirkin told Richmond that the script would require the equivalent of ten rewrites: [...] "At every step, there are amendments and additions and refinements." [...] Richmond commented that as the recording session started, the [...] "astounding versatility" [...] of the actors became clear; [...] "Castellaneta bounces from being Homer to Grampa to Barney without taking a breath and minus any evident vocal similarities." [...] Mirkin said the episode was also <b>a</b> <b>tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>force</b> for Kavner, who in one scene voices Marge, Marge's two sisters, and Marge's mother. He added that even though she enjoyed the process, it was tough on Kavner's voice because those characters talk with [...] "gravelly voices".|$|E

500|$|Some {{characters}} {{are present in}} multiple entries of the series, such as Giygas, Mr. Saturn, and Pokey/Porky. Giygas is the primary antagonist in both Mother and EarthBound. The alien creature's emotional complexity deviates from genre norms. Giygas shows internal conflict in Mother and has no appearance but as an [...] "indescribable" [...] force in EarthBound final boss battle. In both final battles, Giygas is defeated through love and prayer instead of through <b>a</b> <b>tour</b> <b>de</b> <b>force</b> of weaponry, unlike the endings of other period games. Nadia Oxford wrote for IGN that nearly two decades later, EarthBound final fight against Giygas continues to be [...] "one of the most epic video game standoffs of all time" [...] with noted emotional impact. This battle's dialogue was based on Itoi's recollections of a traumatic scene from the Shintoho film The Military Policeman and the Dismembered Beauty that he had accidentally seen in his childhood. Oxford wrote for 1UP.com that Itoi intended to show the alien's yearning for love in [...] "a manner ... beyond human understanding". Despite EarthBound and Mother 3 dissimilar settings, the Mr. Saturn fictional species appear in similar Saturn Valleys in both games. The Mr. Saturn look like an old man's head with feet, a large nose, and bald except for a single hair with a bow. Though they are a technologically advanced and peaceful species with a pureness of heart, they are under constant attacks from encroaching enemies. Nadia and David Oxford of 1UP.com considered the Mr. Saturn to be aliens despite their human-like and fleshy appearance, as described a piece arguing the central theme of aliens in the Mother series. They compared the Mr. Saturn to Kurt Vonnegut's Tralfamadorian alien species. Finally, Pokey begins as Ness's child neighbor who [...] "cowers" [...] and [...] "refuses to fight" [...] in EarthBound, but grows into a [...] "vicious control freak with no regard for human life", Porky, {{by the end of}} the series' Mother 3.|$|E
