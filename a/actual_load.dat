50|$|In civil engineering, {{specified}} loads are {{the best}} estimate of the <b>actual</b> <b>loads</b> a structure is expected to carry. These loads come in many different forms, such as people, equipment, vehicles, wind, rain, snow, earthquakes, the building materials themselves, etc. Specified Loads also known as Characteristic loads in many cases.|$|R
50|$|The HotSpot Java {{virtual machine}} (JVM) uses profile-guided {{optimization}} to dynamically generate native code. As a consequence, a software binary is optimized for the <b>actual</b> <b>load</b> it is receiving. If the load changes, adaptive optimization can dynamically recompile the running software to optimize {{it for the}} new load. This means that all software executed on the HotSpot JVM effectively make use of profile-guided optimization.|$|E
50|$|The {{missing link}} {{of a full}} Voltage {{sensitive}} - voltage intensive (VSVI) system was the reliable AC Constant Voltage generator. Therefore {{the invention of the}} constant voltage generator by the Ganz Works in 1883 had crucial role in the beginnings of the industrial scale AC power generating, because only these type of generators can produce a stated output voltage, regardless {{of the value of the}} <b>actual</b> <b>load.</b>|$|E
50|$|It {{is normal}} {{to apply a}} partial safety factor to the loads and to the {{material}} strengths, to design using 95th percentiles (two standard deviations from the mean). The safety factor applied to the load will typically ensure that in 95% of times the <b>actual</b> <b>load</b> will be smaller than the design load, while the factor applied to the strength ensures that 95% of times the actual strength will be higher than the design strength.|$|E
40|$|Bridges are {{structures}} that propose the service life up to hundred years. However, the <b>actual</b> traffic <b>load</b> models significantly {{differ from the}} characteristic load models used in the design. The analysis of former design codes of bridges used at the last century in Latvia showed the considerable increase of values of characteristic traffic loads. The traffic loads proposed in Eurocode 1 : “Actions on structures – Part 2 : Traffic loads on bridges” considerably increase the <b>actual</b> traffic <b>loads</b> passing Latvian bridges. Therefore, {{the use of the}} <b>actual</b> traffic <b>load</b> models for assessment of the load carrying capacity of the older bridges will extend the service life and save financial founds for the maintenance of the bridges. Earlier, the obtaining of the correct traffic data was complicated. Today after implementation of the Weight-In-Motion system, it is possible to collect vehicle information without interruption of the traffic flow. This includes data of the number of axles, vehicle wheelbase, speed and axle loads that describes the <b>actual</b> <b>loading</b> cases on the roads and bridges. The analysis of the recorded data of Weight-In-Motion the system allowed to obtain the load distribution diagrams, determine the position of the heaviest axel, traffic speed and intensity values. The obtained results of statistical analysis of <b>actual</b> traffic <b>loads</b> allowed developing the integrated traffic load models for bridges, based on <b>actual</b> traffic <b>load</b> in Latvia. Obtained integrated traffic load models for bridges in Latvia is used for evaluation {{of the value of the}} adjustment factor α of the load model LM 1 proposed in Eurocode 1 : “Actions on structures – Part 2 : Traffic loads on bridges. ...|$|R

5000|$|As {{traction}} motors use a reduction gear setup to transfer torque from the motor armature to the driven axle, the <b>actual</b> <b>load</b> {{placed on the}} motor varies with the gear ratio. Otherwise [...] "identical" [...] {{traction motors}} can have significantly different load rating. A traction motor geared for freight use with a low gear ratio will safely produce higher torque at the wheels {{for a longer period}} at the same current level because the lower gears give the motor more mechanical advantage.|$|E
5000|$|The Class 1E builders, works numbers, {{years of}} {{construction}} and modifications to Classes ES and 1ES {{are listed in}} the table. The axle load and adhesive weight as shown under [...] "Specifications" [...] in the infobox may be considered as average figures for the Class 1E since these weights varied between the seven series.

5000|$|The {{outermost}} loop, {{the main}} loop, regulates load position. In this example, position feedback of the <b>actual</b> <b>load</b> position is presented by a Rotary encoder {{that produces a}} binary output code. The actual position is compared to the desired position by a digital subtracter that drives a DAC (Digital-to-analog converter) that drives the position control amplifier (KP). Position control allows the servo to compensate for sag and for slight position ripple caused by gears (not shown) between the motor and the telescope ...|$|E

30|$|All the {{concentrated}} loads applied on {{the beam}} {{in the model}} acted at nodes. The effect of bearing plates, which were actually used in the load-test to apply vertical loads on the beam, was ignored for simplicity. The loads were distributed among three nodes adjacent {{to the location of}} the applied load. The analysis yielded similar results in the cases when (a) larger load was applied at the node corresponding to the <b>actual</b> <b>loading</b> point and lower loads were applied at the two adjacent nodes and (b) loads were distributed equally among the three nodes. Hence, the concentrated vertical loads on the beams were modeled at a node corresponding to the <b>actual</b> <b>loading</b> point and two adjacent nodes. The results of beam analysis i.e. vertical forces and nodal deflections, were computed at every loading step that had numerically converged. Additionally, the stresses and strains in the beam elements were also calculated by the program (Laskar 2009).|$|R
50|$|Influence {{lines are}} both scalar and additive. This {{means that they}} can be used even when the load that will be applied is not a unit load or if there are {{multiple}} loads applied. To find the effect of any non-unit load on a structure, the ordinate results obtained by the influence line are multiplied by the magnitude of the <b>actual</b> <b>load</b> to be applied. The entire influence line can be scaled, or just the maximum and minimum effects experienced along the line. The scaled maximum and minimum are the critical magnitudes that must be designed for in the beam or truss.|$|E
50|$|Electronic loads {{are used}} in diverse applications, {{particularly}} for the test of power supplies, batteries, solar and fuel cells, generators. AC loads are used to test transformers, uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) or onboard power supplies.The equipment and power spectrum of such electronic loads begins with simplest circuits consisting in general of a potentiometer for current setting and a transistor circuit for power transforming. Further developed electronic loads supply several operating modes, in most cases constant current, voltage, power and resistance. Nowadays, the equipment may be controlled by a PLC or remotely by a PC. Settings and measured values such as input voltage and <b>actual</b> <b>load</b> current are indicated on a display.|$|E
5000|$|Structural loads are an {{important}} consideration {{in the design of}} buildings. Building codes require that structures be designed and built to safely resist all actions that they are likely to face during their service life, while remaining fit for use. [...] Minimum loads or actions are specified in these building codes for types of structures, geographic locations, usage and materials of construction. [...] Structural loads are split into categories by their originating cause. In terms of the <b>actual</b> <b>load</b> on a structure, there is no difference between dead or live loading, but the split occurs for use in safety calculations or ease of analysis on complex models.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{the guidelines for}} simulation of fuel-cell (FC) stacks by using a computer-controlled high-power converter, which drives <b>actual</b> electric <b>loads,</b> or injects power to the grid. The FC output static and dynamic characteristics are closely reproduced {{in such a way}} the <b>actual</b> <b>loads</b> are seamlessly driven as if they were supplied by the simulated FC. The simulator char-acteristics include the membrane temperature and humidity, ef-ficiency, flow of the reactants, cooling air fan and water pumps, the actual air environmental temperature and humidity, and the regimen of operation of the <b>actual</b> electrical <b>load.</b> Any type of FC of ordinary size can be simulated without having to use hydrogen with improved safety, variety of tests, flexibility, and demo facili-ties. Those features allied to the low cost of this FC simulator con-tribute for market analysis and life-cycle studies of a site installa-tion.

But in a cooperative scenario, it is difficult to model and analyze due to different cross-cell scheduling [27, 28].

5000|$|An {{autotransformer}} has one winding that is tapped at {{some point}} along the winding. Voltage is applied across {{a portion of the}} winding, and a higher (or lower) voltage is produced across another portion of the same winding. The equivalent power rating of the autotransfomer is lower than the <b>actual</b> <b>load</b> power rating. It is calculated by: load VA × (|Vin [...] - [...] Vout|)/Vin. For example, an auto transformer that adapts a 1000 VA load rated at 120 Volts to a 240 Volt supply has an equivalent rating of at least: 1,000VA × (240V [...] - [...] 120V) / 240V = 500VA. However, the actual rating (shown on the tally plate) must be at least 1000 VA.|$|E

This is the life at which ten percent of the bearings in that application can be expected to have failed due to classical fatigue failure (and not any other mode of failure like lubrication starvation, wrong mounting etc.), or, alternatively, the life at which ninety percent will still be operating.The L10 life of the bearing is theoretical life and may not represent service life of the bearing. Bearings are also rated using C0 (static loading) value. This is the basic load rating as a reference, and not an <b>actual</b> <b>load</b> value.|$|E

The rotor of the synchro {{control transformer}} is turned by the response shaft, which is geared to the load and so indicates what {{the position of the}} load actually is. The synchro compares the <b>actual</b> <b>load</b> position with the ordered position; and, if the two do not agree, it generates an alternating-current signal which is transmitted to the amplifier. The angular difference between the two positions is called the error, and the signal to the amplifier is the error signal. The error signal indicates by its electrical characteristics the size and direction of the error. If no error exists, the system is said to be in correspondence and the error signal is zero." ...|$|E
40|$|Buckling of {{load-carrying}} column structures is {{an important}} design constraint in light-weight structures as it may result {{in the collapse of}} an entire structure.
