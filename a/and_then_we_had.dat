500|$|Captain America's shield, {{which serves}} as both a {{defensive}} tool and a weapon, came in four types: metal, fiberglass, rubber, and computer graphics (CG). Prop master Barry Gibbs specified that [...] "We had the 'hero shield,' which was made of aluminum, for our beauty shots [...] close-up work. We then created a lighter shield that was aluminum-faced with a fiberglass back, for use on a daily basis.... <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> a stunt shield made of polyurethane, {{which is sort of}} a synthetic rubber... and we made an ultrasoft one we put on [...] back, so that if there were an accident, it wouldn't hurt him." [...] Visual effects supervisor Christopher Townsend said Evans [...] "would practice swinging the practical shield so he knew the arc and the speed at which he should move. We would take the shield from him and shoot the scene with him miming it. Then we would add in a CG shield".|$|E
500|$|Frank Spotnitz, Richard Zajdlic, Tony Saint and Simon Burke were {{contracted}} as {{the series}} writers, while Alex Holmes, Bill Eagles, Paul Wilmshurst and Daniel Percival {{serve as the}} series directors. Andy Harries and Elaine Pyke were the show's executive producers, with Percival and Spotnitz working as Co-Executive Producers. In addition, Michael Casey, Trevor Hopkins and Sue De Beauvoir were the series producers, with Bill Shepard serving as co-producer. Spotnitz wrote the first episodes. He was approached to write for the series because the producers needed somebody to reimagine the show as Armitage was committed to The Hobbit in New Zealand, by introducing two new leads. Spotnitz described the process; [...] "We had this great format, this great world of 'Strike Back' <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to imagine who were the new characters {{who were going to}} drive the show in the second year." [...] Before Project Dawn was even announced, the crew were scouting for locations in South Africa, where the first series was shot, as well as investigating {{other parts of the world}} including the United States, South America, and Europe.|$|E
500|$|When Manfredini {{returned}} {{for the first}} sequel, he had an easier time composing since he only needed to perfect what he had already created. Over {{the course of the}} sequels, Manfredini loosened the philosophy that the theme should be reserved just for the killer. Manfredini describes the style of the sequels as more of a [...] "setting 'em up and knocking 'em down" [...] approach, which meant that there were more [...] "McGuffins and red‑herrings" [...] that required the killer's theme music be played to try to trick the audience. Manfredini explains, [...] "The original had the real myopic approach, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> to start thinking of the sequels as more conventional films." [...] For Part 3, Manfredini only returned to score the first and last reels of the film because he was busy with a Broadway production. Jack Tillar pieced together portions of the score from the first two films to fill the remaining time for Part 3, while Michael Zagar composed an opening and closing theme. Manfredini and Zagar met at the latter's apartment, where Zagar rescored the original opening theme using a disco beat. Manfredini {{returned for}} The Final Chapter, and although there were similar elements to the score, everything was newly recorded for the fourth Friday the 13th.|$|E

2500|$|Gable did {{not want}} to shed tears for the scene after Rhett {{inadvertently}} causes Scarlett to miscarry their second child. Olivia de Havilland made him cry, later commenting, [...] "...Oh, he would not do it. He would not! Victor (Fleming) tried everything with him. He tried to attack him on a professional level. We had done it without him weeping several times <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> one last try. I said, 'You can do it, I know you can do it and you will be wonderful...' Well, by heaven, just before the cameras rolled, you could see the tears come up at his eyes and he played the scene unforgettably well. He put his whole heart into it." ...|$|E
60|$|Thus {{the work}} was accomplished. With his own guns we drove him from the field. <b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> him carted to a distant small hotel and put to bed with his nuggets and baby seal-skins stuffed around him.|$|E

60|$|May 3.--An early {{visit from}} Mr. Thomas Stewart, nephew of Duchess of Wellington, {{with a letter}} from his aunt. He seems a well-behaved and {{pleasant}} young man.

"Yes, signer," [...] she answered; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{some talk}} about the age {{and the beauty of}} the baby, which I {{declared}} wonderful for both, in praises loud enough for the father and mother to hear. After that they seemed to hold a family council, from which I thought it respectful to stand apart until the grandmother spoke to me again.|$|E
60|$|<b>And</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{to discuss}} and decide what {{provisions}} we were to take--compressed foods, concentrated essences, steel cylinders containing reserve oxygen, an arrangement for removing carbonic acid and waste from the air and restoring oxygen by means of sodium peroxide, water condensers, and so forth. I remember the little heap they made in the corner--tins, and rolls, and boxes--convincingly matter-of-fact.|$|E

60|$|Another {{interval}} passed; <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> another {{short visit}} from him. He was still unaltered. My father's temper suffered under this second disappointment.

5000|$|Asked {{about the}} musical {{direction}} of Brotherhood of the Snake, Peterson replied, [...] "It's different. This {{one is more}} thrash.

Usually, <b>we</b> <b>have</b> one or two thrash songs, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> some mid-tempo, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a slow, heavy one, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> up-tempo kind of stuff. Half of the new record is thrash, which we've never done before." [...] He also described the album as their [...] "kind of Reign in Blood record", a reference to Slayer's third studio album.|$|R
6000|$|There was {{a certain}} grimness in Wyllard's laugh.

60|$|When we were snugly {{lodged in}} the tree and curtained with foliage, the king was satisfied, but I was doubtful. I {{believed}} we could crawl along a branch {{and get into the}} next tree, and I judged it worth while to try. We tried it, and made a success of it, though the king slipped, at the junction, and came near failing to connect. We got comfortable lodgment and satisfactory concealment among the foliage, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> nothing to do but listen to the hunt.|$|E
