25|$|The {{celestial}} sphere has been divided into 88 constellations. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) constellations are {{areas of the}} sky. Each of these contains remarkable X-ray sources. Some of them are have been identified from astrophysical modeling to be galaxies or black holes at the centers of galaxies. Some are pulsars. As with sources already successfully modeled by X-ray astrophysics, striving to understand the generation of X-rays by the apparent source helps to understand the Sun, the universe as a whole, and how these affect us on Earth. Constellations are an astronomical device for handling observation and precision independent of current physical theory or interpretation. Astronomy has been <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time.</b> Physical theory changes with time. With respect to celestial X-ray sources, X-ray astrophysics tends {{to focus on the}} physical reason for X-ray brightness, whereas X-ray astronomy tends to focus on their classification, order of discovery, variability, resolvability, and their relationship with nearby sources in other constellations.|$|E

When Stan finds Sparky at the Big Gay Animal Sanctuary, Big Gay Al takes Stan on a boat ride through his sanctuary and gives a speech about how homosexuality has been <b>around</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> <b>time,</b> which eventually makes Stan accept his dog's homosexuality. Meanwhile, Richard Stamos fails to hit the high note of the song at half time.

In his speech after the game, Stan tells the people of South Park about the Big Gay Animal Sanctuary and that [...] "it's okay to be gay". He leads the people {{to the site of the}} Sanctuary, but it has mysteriously disappeared; people's runaway gay pets, however, return. Before leaving, Big Gay Al thanks Stan for making everyone understand homosexuality. Although the Cows beat the spread, Richard Stamos appears to prove he can hit the high note that he missed earlier, triggering the bomb and killing the Middle Park team's mascot.|$|E

By this time, she had hoped that Rand had moved over to become a counselor – an idea originally suggested by a fan.
