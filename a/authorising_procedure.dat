40|$|EFSA {{requested}} the preparation and prioritisation {{of a list}} of microorganism species likely to be notified to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in the future in the regulatory context of food and feed additives, food enzymes and food flavourings by consulting the following EFSA scientific Units (Food Ingredients and Packaging (FIP), FEED, Genetically Modified Microorganisms (GMO), Pesticides). This list {{is intended to be}} considered for the annual updates and reviews of the Qualified Presumption of Safety (QPS) recommended list of biological agents. EFSA’s QPS assessment has entered EU law only recently with the publication of a new Commission Implementing Regulation No 562 / 2012 regarding specific data required for risk assessment of food enzymes having regard to Regulation (EC) No 1331 / 2008 establishing a common <b>authorising</b> <b>procedure</b> for food additives, food enzymes and food flavourings and to the EFSA guidance on data requirements for the evaluation of food enzyme applications. An EFSA internal working group (WG) prepared a list of microorganism species that maybe likely to be notified to EFSA in the near future based on available information relevant in the legal framework. A high number of application dossiers for risk assessment of enzymes are expected to be submitted until March 2015 in the context of enzyme safety evaluation to the FIP Unit and Food Contact Materials, Enzymes, Flavourings and Processing Aids (CEF) Panel. It is therefore recommended to consider the list as soon as possible by the annual QPS WG of the Biological Hazards (BIOHAZ) Panel to avoid where possible any unnecessary toxicity testing for taxonomic units which would potentially receive a QPS recommendation...|$|E

50|$|Lord Gardiner {{published}} the Minority Report in March 1972 {{as part of}} the Parker Report (Report of the Committee of Privy Counsellors appointed to consider <b>authorised</b> <b>procedures</b> for the interrogation of persons suspected of terrorism), which considered the interrogation procedures used against suspects of terrorism in Northern Ireland, with particular reference to allegations of torture during internment in 1971 (See Sensory deprivation, Use of torture since 1948#United Kingdom, Five techniques). Lord Gardiner was appointed a Companion of Honour in the 1975 New Year's Honours.|$|R
50|$|A {{series of}} {{amendments}} to Commonwealth legislation in 2008 provided complete recognition of same-sex couples at the federal level. This led to a contradiction with Queensland laws, particularly where children were involved. For example, federal law could require the non-biological parent to pay child maintenance even though Queensland law may not have recognised that person as a parent. Without legal guardianship, health services may not have accepted the other parent <b>authorising</b> <b>procedures</b> for the child. If the biological parent died, his or her partner {{would not have been}} considered the next of kin. These issues were remedied when Queensland allowed same-sex adoption legislation in 2016.|$|R

25|$|The {{laws in the}} UK {{cover the}} remains of all {{aircraft}} which have crashed during military service (land or sea) are protected by the Protection of Military Remains Act 1986. This Act defines an offence of tampering with, damage to, moving, or unearthing the aircraft remains. Exceptions apply to those holding licences, which can be issued by the Secretary of State, <b>authorising</b> specific <b>procedures</b> to be performed.|$|R
50|$|When it was {{realized}} that the aircraft was too high 10 effect a landing, a 360° orbit was requested. The speed at this time was 119 kts VREF that was the landing speed. The procedure {{to carry out a}} 360° turn was not an <b>authorised</b> <b>procedure</b> as per the Alliance Air Operations Manual and could have caused considerable confusion in the mind of First Officer Arvind. It was clear from the FDR recording that the aircraft was not following the ILS procedure but Patna ATC was being given the impression that the aircraft was doing so. At any busy airport with some more traffic, this would have been unthinkable and would have created a conflict. However, there was no other traffic for miles around Patna and ATC gave the permission, only after confirming that the crew had the airfield in sight. Captain Manjit tried to resolve this issue without any discussion with First Officer Arvind. The atmosphere in the cockpit was relaxed and tension free till 15 secs before the crash. The first sign of anxiety became apparent only when Arvind called for raising the landing gear.|$|R

50|$|After {{a family}} holiday, Sacha's {{daughter}} Rachel is taken ill, {{and he is}} devastated to learn she has leukaemia. As her treatment begins, he shaves his head to show support to her. When he learns that Daniel is a bone marrow match and is potentially {{the only one that}} can save Rachel's life, he <b>authorises</b> the <b>procedure</b> without Chrissie's permission, creating problems between them. After a rocky few months, Chrissie takes Daniel and visits her father in Australia. When she returns, he learns through Daniel's nursery that she is back and suspects Chrissie of having an affair with Michael. However, it conspires she has breast cancer, which devastates Sacha. He later moves back in with Chrissie to support Daniel, but their separation continues.|$|R
25|$|In {{places where}} paramedics are {{recognized}} {{health care professionals}} registered with an appropriate body, they can conduct all <b>procedures</b> <b>authorised</b> for their profession, including the administration of prescription medication, and are personally answerable to a regulator. For example, in the United Kingdom, the Health and Care Professions Council regulates paramedics and can censure or strike a paramedic from the register. In some cases paramedics may gain further qualifications to extend their status {{to that of a}} paramedic practitioner or advanced paramedic, which may allow them to administer a wider range of drugs and use a wider range of clinical skills.|$|R
40|$|On 20 December 2011 the European Commission {{published}} its {{proposals for}} two new procedural directives on public procurement, one to replace Public Sector Directive 2004 / 18 {{and one to}} replace Utilities Directive 2004 / 17, with the stated aims of “simplification” and “flexibilisation” (sic) of the rules to improve value for money. However, following {{the pattern of the}} previous reforms in 2004, whilst the proposals do indeed provide for some additional flexibility, they have {{at the same time in}} many respects introduced more rigidity and burdensome requirements for Member States. Furthermore, these and other changes proposed will result in a set of rules which is vastly more complex than the current regime that the proposals purport to simplify. In this context, this article proposes a simple blueprint for reforming the directives to in the shape of a single directive for all regulated contracts that is based on the Utilities Directive, although with some modifications. Such an approach will afford the flexibility necessary for Member State to promote their own procurement policies, including value for money, in an appropriate way - in particular, it will allow Member States to <b>authorise</b> use of <b>procedures</b> involving negotiation, allow them to take account of the significant benefits of qualification systems, and facilitate cost-effective approaches to advertising contracts. Further, it will greatly reduce the complexities and uncertainties that apply under the current regulatory regime. This will result both from the greater simplicity of the content of the utilities rules as compared with the rules that apply under the other directives, and from the very existence of a single regime, which, inter alia, will eliminate the need to operate under multiple regimes and to determine the boundaries between them. Thus this approach will promote both the flexibility and simplification objective of the current reform agenda whilst at the same, it is submitted, providing a suitable framework of rules for promoting the single market in public procurement in the EU...|$|R
