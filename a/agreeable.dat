Red is associated with heat, blue with cold, and green with an <b>agreeable</b> temperature. Red is associated with dry, blue with wet, and green, in the middle, with dampness. Red is the most active color, blue the most passive; green, in the middle, {{is the color of}} neutrality and calm, sometimes used in architecture and design for these reasons. Blue and green together symbolize harmony and balance.|$|E

5|$|Victoria {{found her}} cousin Albert <b>agreeable</b> and soon proposed. This {{connection}} would have many implications upon Ernest in the future; for instance, {{he was selected}} as godfather for Albert's second daughter Princess Alice, and would eventually come to give her away at her wedding, only months after Albert's death.|$|E
5|$|Mickiewicz {{was welcomed}} into the leading {{literary}} circles of Saint Petersburg and Moscow, {{where he became}} a great favorite for his <b>agreeable</b> manners and extraordinary talent for poetic improvisation. The year 1828 saw {{the publication of his}} poem Konrad Wallenrod. Novosiltsev, who recognized its patriotic and subversive message, which had been missed by the Moscow censors, unsuccessfully attempted to sabotage its publication and to damage Mickiewicz's reputation.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer {{submitted}} {{his resignation}} as Director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, but remained until a successor could be found. The Director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., wanted someone {{with both a}} solid academic background and a high standing within the project. Oppenheimer recommended Bradbury. This was <b>agreeable</b> to Groves, who {{liked the fact that}} as a naval officer Bradbury was both a military man and a scientist. Bradbury accepted the offer on a six-month trial basis.|$|E
5|$|TGS {{producer}} Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) {{learns that}} the new actor on the show, Danny, is a talented singer. Despite Danny's {{lack of interest in}} singing on the show, Pete gives him the Christmas solo as revenge for Jenna not chipping in to tip the cleaning ladies, which is a yearly source of frustration for Pete. Jenna is outraged when she hears Danny was assigned the solo, and tries to get Subhas the janitor to punch Danny in the throat. But when the <b>agreeable</b> Danny learns of Jenna's hurt feelings, he arranges for them to perform a duet, in which he sings off-key to make Jenna look good.|$|E
5|$|Harold Larwood {{maintained}} {{great respect}} for Jardine, treasuring a gift his captain gave him after the Bodyline tour and believing {{him to be a}} great man. Jardine showed affection for Larwood in return even after both of their retirements; he expressed his concern for the way Larwood was treated, hosted a lunch for the former fast bowler shortly before he emigrated to Australia and met him there in 1954. On the other hand, Donald Bradman would never speak to journalists about Bodyline or Jardine, and refused to give a tribute when Jardine died in 1958. Jack Fingleton admitted that he had liked Jardine and stated that he and Larwood had each done their job on the Bodyline tour, and expressed regret at the way both left cricket in acrimonious circumstances. Fingleton also described Jardine as an aloof individual who preferred to take his time in judging a person before befriending them, a quality that caused problems in Australia. Bill O'Reilly stated that he disliked Jardine at the time of Bodyline, but on meeting him later found him <b>agreeable</b> and even charming.|$|E
5|$|By this time, Schwarzkopf {{commanded}} {{an international}} army of 750,000, comprising 500,000 U.S. troops and 250,000 troops from other nations, {{as well as}} thousands of main battle tanks, combat aircraft and six carrier battle groups. Most of the U.S. and allied forces, however, were not combat veterans, and Schwarzkopf and the other allied commanders wanted to fight cautiously to minimize casualties. Schwarzkopf's experience in the Middle East allowed him to understand the factors surrounding the conflict, including allied commanders, with greater ease. He had {{a good relationship with}} Saudi commander Khalid bin Sultan, who in turn helped Schwarzkopf win over the Saudi Arabian populace. In spite of the cooperation, he later said he considered the Arab troops to be the least effective of the war. Schwarzkopf also had an <b>agreeable</b> relationship with his deputy commander, Lieutenant General Cal Waller, who handled much of the administrative burden. Peter de la Billière, commander of the British contingent, and Michel Roquejeoffre, commander of the French contingent, also cooperated well with Schwarzkopf. The good relationship between the allied commanders meant their forces were able to cooperate effectively during the operation.|$|E
5|$|In January 1827, the General Assembly {{considered}} {{whether to}} elect U.S. Senator John Randolph {{for a full}} six-year term. Randolph was a contentious figure; although he shared the staunch states' rights views held {{by most of the}} Virginia legislature, he had a reputation for fiery rhetoric and erratic behavior on the Senate floor, which put his allies in an awkward position. Furthermore, he had made enemies by fiercely opposing President John Quincy Adams and Kentucky Senator Henry Clay. The nationalists of the Democratic-Republican Party, who supported Adams and Clay, were a sizable minority in the Virginia legislature. They hoped to unseat Randolph by capturing the vote of states' rights supporters who were uncomfortable with the senator's reputation. They approached Tyler, and promised their endorsement if he sought the seat. Tyler repeatedly declined the offer, endorsing Randolph as the best candidate, but the political pressure continued to mount. Eventually he agreed to accept the seat if chosen. On the day of the vote, one assemblyman argued there was no political difference between the two candidates—Tyler was merely more <b>agreeable</b> than Randolph. The incumbent's supporters, though, contended that Tyler's election would be a tacit endorsement of the Adams administration. The legislature selected Tyler in a vote of 115–110, and he resigned his governorship on March 4, 1827, as his Senate term began.|$|E
5|$|Stone and Blackwell {{developed}} a private agreement aimed at preserving and protecting Stone’s financial independence and personal liberty. In monetary matters, {{they agreed that}} the marriage be like a business partnership, with the partners being “joint proprietors of everything except the results of previous labors.” Neither would have claim to lands belonging to the other, nor any obligation for the other’s costs of holding them. While married and living together they would share earnings, but if they should separate, they would relinquish claim to the other’s subsequent earnings. Each would {{have the right to}} will their property to whomever they pleased unless they had children. Over Blackwell’s objections, Stone refused to be supported and insisted on paying half of their mutual expenses. In addition to financial independence, Stone and Blackwell agreed that each would enjoy personal independence and autonomy: “Neither partner shall attempt to fix the residence, employment, or habits of the other, nor shall either partner feel bound to live together any longer than is <b>agreeable</b> to both.” During their discussion of marriage, Stone had given Blackwell a copy of Henry C. Wright’s book Marriage and Parentage; Or, The Reproductive Element in Man, as a Means to His Elevation and Happiness, and asked him to accept its principles as what she considered the relationship between husband and wife should be. Wright proposed that because women bore the results of sexual intercourse, wives should govern a couple’s marital relations. In accordance with that view, Blackwell agreed that Stone would choose “when, where and how often” she would “become a mother.” In addition to this private agreement, Blackwell drew up a protest of laws, rules, and customs that conferred superior rights on husbands and, as part of the wedding ceremony, pledged never to avail himself of those laws.|$|E
25|$|Agreeableness is {{negatively}} correlated with income, although <b>agreeable</b> people can be less disruptive in teams {{and are more likely}} to be liked, although not necessarily respected, by their coworkers. Less <b>agreeable</b> people tend to make more effective managers, perhaps because it is not easy to take advantage of them.|$|E

25|$|Most recent is a {{study done}} by Larsen, Pulkkinen, and Adams (2002) in which they looked at many {{different}} levels of childhood behavior and emotion and the correlation into adulthood agreeableness. In their first analyses, structure coefficients showed that childhood compliance, aggression, and self-control discriminated high-agreeableness from low-agreeableness in adults better than did activity versus passivity, constructiveness, and anxiety. In their second analyses, structure coefficients indicated that adulthood socialization and impulsivity discriminated high-agreeableness from low-agreeableness in adults better than did inhibition of aggression and anxiety. In linking childhood behavioral profiles to adulthood personality profiles, high-compliant, high-self-control, and low-aggressive children {{were most likely to}} become high-agreeable, high-socialized, and low-impulsive adults. These children were more unlikely to become low-agreeable, low-socialized, and high-impulsive adults. Further, low-compliant, low-self-control, and high-aggressive children were likely to become low-agreeable, low-socialized, and high-impulsive adults and these children were unlikely to become high-agreeable, high-socialized, and low-impulsive adults. In addition to this, children classified as low-compliance, low-self-control, low-aggression types and children classified as high-compliance, high-self-control, low-aggression types had a greater probability of becoming adults with high-agreeableness, high-socialization, high-impulsivity profiles. Looking at stability of agreeableness they found results that indicated that stable low <b>agreeable</b> individuals reported less career stability and more depression when compared with stable high <b>agreeable</b> individuals and low to high <b>agreeable</b> individuals. Further, stable high <b>agreeable</b> individuals reported lower levels of alcoholism than did the other groups and fewer arrests than did stable low <b>agreeable</b> individuals.|$|E

25|$|In the Abhaya-raja-kumara Sutta, the Buddha {{explains}} {{the virtue of}} right speech in different scenarios, based on its truth value, utility value and emotive content. The Tathagata, states Abhaya Sutta, never speaks anything that is unfactual or factual, untrue or true, disagreeable or <b>agreeable,</b> if that is unbeneficial and unconnected to his goals. Further, adds Abhaya Sutta, the Tathagata speaks the factual, the true, if in case it is disagreeable and unendearing, {{only if it is}} beneficial to his goals, but with a sense of proper time. Additionally, adds Abhaya Sutta, the Tathagata, only speaks with a sense of proper time even when what he speaks is the factual, the true, the <b>agreeable,</b> the endearing and what is beneficial to his goals.|$|E

25|$|Because <b>agreeable</b> {{children}} are {{more sensitive to the}} needs and perspectives of others, {{they are less likely to}} suffer from social rejection.
