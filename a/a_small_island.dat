5|$|East of the railway, {{the route}} crosses below US1. The {{eastbound}} lane has an exit ramp that connects to both directions of US1; in contrast, the westbound lane has a dedicated exit for both US1 northbound and a loop to US1 southbound. The road continues to the east, crossing a small inlet and <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>island</b> before ascending over the Indian River with twin bridges. At {{the eastern end}} of the bridges, the route again crosses <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>island</b> and inlet before reaching a narrow portion of Merritt Island. There, the causeway intersects with CR3. The route crosses a series of islands, forming another twin set of bridges over the Banana River. After reaching land for the final time, the route enters South Patrick Shores. It has a partial interchange with SR513, with only an eastbound exit and a westbound entrance. After passing north of a housing development, the causeway ends at an intersection with SR A1A.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{prior to}} the Minoan eruption, {{the walls of the}} caldera formed a nearly {{continuous}} ring of islands with the only entrance lying between Thera and the tiny island of Aspronisi. This cataclysmic eruption was centered on <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>island</b> just north of the existing island of Nea Kameni in the centre of the then-existing caldera. The northern part of the caldera was refilled by the volcanic ash and lava, then collapsed again.|$|E

5|$|The {{ancestor}} of Noronhomys {{may have been}} a semiaquatic animal, similar to living Holochilus or Lundomys, that arrived on Fernando de Noronha by chance on a floating log. The morphology of the limb bones in Noronhomys suggests that the animal was not semiaquatic like its relatives, but terrestrial, consistent with its occurrence on <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>island,</b> where streams and pools are rare or absent.|$|E
5|$|The series also {{gained a}} new true/false {{guessing}} game called False Or True however {{perhaps the most}} significant was L Castaway which saw two teams (boys against girls) spend a week on <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>island</b> in Loch Lomond with Tammy Huff and Toby Waterman from Castaway 2000 as their team captains.

5|$|During the Late Quaternary period (0.7 {{million years}} ago), small emus {{lived on a}} number of {{offshore}} islands of mainland Australia. In addition to the King Island emu, these included taxa found on Kangaroo Island (D.n.baudinianus) and Tasmania (D.n.diemenensis), all of which are now extinct. The smallest taxon, the King Island emu, was confined to <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>island</b> situated in the Bass Strait between Tasmania and Victoria, approximately 100km (62mi) from both coasts. King Island was once part of the land bridge which connected Tasmania and mainland Australia, but rising sea levels following the last glacial maximum eventually isolated the island. As a result of phenotypic plasticity the King Island emu population possibly underwent a process of insular dwarfism.|$|E

Prior to the outbreak of war, Morotai had a population of 9,000 and had not been commercially developed.

One day later, on September 11, the Congressional {{delegation}} arrived on Staten Island and met with Admiral Lord Howe for several hours.

5|$|Soon after, Dr. Schenker {{reveals that}} the {{antidote}} for the chemical reagent is located in H.A.R.M.'s space station.
