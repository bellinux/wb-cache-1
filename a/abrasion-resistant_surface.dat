It is also used as an <b>abrasion-resistant</b> <b>surface</b> coating on metal parts, such as tool bits and watch mechanisms. Titanium carbide is also used as a heat shield coating for atmospheric reentry of spacecraft.|$|E
40|$|Self-metallizing. {{flexible}} polyimide {{films with}} highly reflective surfaces are prepared by an in situ self-metallization procedure involving thermally initiated reduction of polymer-soluble silver(I) complexes. Polyamic acid solutions are doped with silver(I) acetate and solubilizing agents. Thermally curing the silver(I) doped resins leads to flexible. metallized films which have reflectivities {{as high as}} 100 %. <b>abrasion-resistant</b> <b>surfaces.</b> thermal stability and, in some cases, electrical conductivity, rendering them useful for space applications...|$|R
