6000|$|... "What {{shall we}} do with the other four berries?" [...] asked Trot, <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>picked</b> up her sunbonnet, marveling that she had ever been small enough to ride in it. [...] "They're no good to us now, are they, Cap'n?" ...|$|E

6000|$|She knelt <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>picked</b> up the pocketbook, {{and raised}} her playfellow of happier days to take her leave of him.

60|$|Her eyes dwelt affectionately on Green Gables, {{peering through}} its network {{of trees and}} {{reflecting}} the sunlight back from its windows in several little coruscations of glory.

60|$|Still, she {{was truly}} sorry {{to lose her}} friend the Hibou, {{although}} {{she had not been}} able to fulfil her mother's wish, and make him fall in love with her, or even to fall in love with him herself.

But the number of speeches that passed was very small in proportion to the meanings exchanged. Long experience together often enabled them to see the course of thought in each other's minds without a word being spoken. Behind them, in the centre of the room, the table was spread for supper, certain whiffs of air laden with fat vapours, which ever and anon entered from the kitchen, denoting its preparation there.|$|E
60|$|It must be admitted, however, that Barbox by {{no means}} hurried himself. His heart being in his work of good-nature, he revelled in it. There was the joy, too (it was a true joy to him), of {{sometimes}} sitting by, listening to Phoebe <b>as</b> <b>she</b> <b>picked</b> out more and more discourse from her musical instrument, and as her natural taste and ear refined daily upon her first discoveries. Besides being a pleasure, this was an occupation, {{and in the course}} of weeks it consumed hours. It resulted that his dreaded birthday was close upon him before he had troubled himself any more about it.|$|E
