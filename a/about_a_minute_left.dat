50|$|In {{the return}} leg in Düsseldorf, North Rhine-Westphalia, both teams drew 2-2. Fortuna Düsseldorf won on {{aggregate}} 4-3. However, {{the second half}} was marred by trouble. Hertha BSC supporter threw flares onto the field. Hertha BSC supporters did this after Fortuna Düsseldorf scored their second goal of the night going up 2:1. The other problem of the night was when several Fortuna Düsseldorf supporters ran onto the field with <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>left.</b> It took 21 minutes to restore order and stoppage time ended up being 28 minutes {{by the time the}} final whistle blew. With Fortuna Düsseldorf winning the 2 legged affair, they return to the Bundesliga after 15 seasons.|$|E
50|$|The Rest of the Story What {{is often}} left untold is what {{happened}} after John Smith kicked the go-ahead field goal. Despite the snowy conditions, the Dolphins methodically marched down the field {{on the strength of}} their running backs Andra Franklin and Tony Nathan and Quarterback David Woodley. With <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>left</b> in the game, and well within field goal range, the Dolphins faced a 4th down. Mark Henderson had driven his John Deere tractor down to that side of the field and was ready at motion from the referee, {{to go out on the}} field and clear a path for Dolphins Kicker Uwe von Schamann. Shula decided to go for the first down instead of a tying field goal. The Patriots stopped the Dolphins and took over on downs.|$|E
50|$|Later {{that same}} night, 21 December, the IPLO Volunteers carried out their attack. The attackers knew the pub would be packed with {{customers}} on a Saturday night. Three IPLO Volunteers {{seemed to be}} involved in the attack, 2 gunmen and a getaway driver. According to witnesses two gunmen entered the bar, one with an automatic rifle and the other with a hand gun. The gunman with the rifle shot at anything that moved in the bar, while terrified patrons scrambled for cover. The gunfire only lasted <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute,</b> but it <b>left</b> two Protestant civilians dead: Thomas Gorman, 55, and Barry Watson, 25, who both died almost instantly. Three other people, also civilians, were injured in the shooting. The stolen car used in the attack was found at Devonshire Place in the Lower Falls area of west Belfast. A few hours after the attack, the UDA shot dead a Catholic civilian less than 2 miles from the Donegall Arms.|$|R
50|$|The Aggies {{started the}} second half {{and were able to}} advance the ball 54 yards using a {{balanced}} rushing and passing attack. They missed the opportunity to move past the KSU 33 on 4th-and-8, and had to turn the ball over on downs. K-State used the drive to make a 49-yard field goal. With 7:53 remaining in the third quarter, A&M utilized its passing game to move the ball, thanks in part to two 22-yard receptions, one made by Jeff Fuller, and the other completed by Ryan Tannehill. Jerrod Johnson rushed to the endzone from the KSU 5. Randy Bullock, however, missed the extra point. Still trailing 30-16, the Aggies looked to pull a comeback. Hopes of a comeback diminished when Jorvorskie Lane's second attempt at scoring on a short goal-line rush failed. A&M had to turnover on downs once again, despite moving the ball for 62 yards and just a yard shy of scoring. K-State used its rushing game to drain out the clock a little, and successfully ended the drive on a 1-yard run by Josh Freeman. Less than 5 minutes remained in the game once A&M got the ball. Johnson made 3 consecutive completions to Tannehill worth 50 yards, and Goodson scored on the next play via a 23-yard reception. After their quick touchdown, the Aggies attempted an onside kick, which was recovered by K-State at the A&M 41. The Wildcats ran the ball once again, and were rewarded yet another touchdown to extend their lead to 44-23. <b>About</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> was <b>left,</b> and on the second play of A&M's last possession, Johnson connected to Tannehill for a 55-yard touchdown. The Aggies tried another onside kick, but K-State found the ball and preserved their 44-30 win.|$|R
25|$|Once {{the second}} quarter commenced, both Brown and Gresham moved the ball for a {{touchdown}} on three different plays. Tech started their next drive at their own 38 and advanced the ball through the air to eventually get to the Oklahoma 15. Two incompletions caused the Red Raiders to face a 4th-and-3. Tech {{decided to go for}} it. Woods was unable to catch a pass by Harrell to convert and Tech turned the ball over on downs. Murray rushed the ball for 23yards on Oklahoma's first play of the drive. Murray followed with a 31-yard reception, which put the ball on the Tech 30. After two rushes by Brown, Gresham scored a touchdown on a 19-yard catch, and the subsequent extra point extended the Sooners lead to 21–0. Oklahoma's defense forced Tech to four plays on the next drive, with the fourth play being a 4th-and-4, Tech's second 4th down conversion attempt. With 9:31 remaining, Oklahoma completed a 1:44 scoring drive, which was capped by Juaquin Iglesias' 28-yard scoring reception. On the following possession, the Red Raiders reached the end zone, thanks to Harrell's 25-yard throw to Tramain Swindall. Matt Williams' extra point brought the score to 28–7. With 6:28 left in the half, Oklahoma began to drain the clock using their running game. The Sooners eventually scored on the 12th play of the drive. Once Tech got the ball, <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> was <b>left</b> on the clock. On the second play, Harrell threw an interception to Travis Lewis, who returned the ball 47yards. Tech offensive guard Brandon Carter, who stopped Lewis at the Tech 1, received a personal foul. Murray scored on a 1-yard rush to increase the Sooners' lead to 42–7. Tech got the ball again after the Sooner touchdown with 18 seconds remaining in the game. Harrell threw a shovel pass to Baron Batch, who ran 21 yards to the Tech 28. The half ended with Tech receiving a 16-yard personal foul. The Red Raiders left the field facing their biggest deficit of the season (35 points).|$|R
50|$|Twenty-five {{minutes into}} the final quarter and with scores level, Collingwood's Wayne Richardson had a shot at goal on the run but kicked it out of bounds on the full. St Kilda then began to work {{the ball out of}} defence after winning the {{boundary}} throw-in. A kick from Ian Cooper saw the ball make its way to centre half forward. Collingwood defender Ted Potter failed to mark the ball low down and with the players scrummaging for the ball a bounce was called. Brian Mynott won the tap for the Saints but it was intercepted by Potter who was quickly tackled. Potter however managed to get out a hand pass but it found its way to St Kilda's Barry Breen who snapped at goal and kicked a behind to put his side in front. With <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>left</b> on the clock, Collingwood were able to work the ball towards their forward line. Bob Murray, however, was able to take a mark at centre half back and the siren sounded after he kicked the ball towards the wing.|$|E
50|$|With <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>left</b> in the round, Chávez hit Taylor {{squarely}} {{with several}} hard punches, and Taylor responded by mockingly feigning weakness, but Chávez was not convinced by Taylor's bravado and {{stayed on the}} attack, continuing to hit Taylor with well-placed shots. Finally, with about 25 seconds to go, Chávez landed a hard right hand that caused Taylor to stagger forward towards a corner, forcing Chávez back ahead of him.

50|$|As {{they began}} the recon, the crew {{reported}} eighteen Japanese aircraft either taxiing or taking off. Zeamer began the mapping run, {{hoping that they}} could finish the mapping run before the enemy aircraft could reach their mapping altitude of 25,000 feet. It was indeed close. Two passes from below {{with just a few}} minutes left proved ineffectual, but with <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>left,</b> the crew observed five Zeros coordinating into a multi-pronged attack on the plane from below, with two approaching from the rear and three fanned across the front from the 10:00 to 2:00 positions. In the past, drawing on his experience with the 22nd Bomb Group prior to joining the 43rd, Zeamer would turn into approaching fighters, inside their line of fire, eventually rolling them almost completely over {{by the time they reached}} Zeamer's B-17. Zeamer saw that he couldn't execute such a maneuver in this case, however, without exposing '666's belly to one or two of the three coordinated fighters across his front. Aware that they were now over Empress Augusta Bay, the single most important objective of the mapping mission, Zeamer kept his course, planning to fight it out.|$|E
50|$|As Ainar's only MP, Japua {{proposed}} {{a moratorium on}} the sale of real estate to foreign citizens {{for as long as the}} necessary legal framework was absent, including a cadastre and zoning plans. The sale of real estate to foreign citizens has been prohibited since 1994, but there was a rival bill that proposed to legalise it. On 15 April 2016, neither proposal was accepted at the committee-level, with, in each case, two votes in favour, two votes against and one abstention. The following day, between 18:10 and 18:25, Japua's car was blown up with a bomb. The explosion occurred <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> after Japua <b>left</b> the car, and a theory being investigated is that the attack was not meant to hurt Japua, but to warn him. During an emergency session of Parliament in the evening of the following Monday, 18 April, Japua proposed to discuss both rival bills there and then, but the deputies decided to delay the matter until the following Thursday. Japua then declared that since he wouldn't be heard in Parliament, he would resign as deputy, and that the moratorium would be defended by its co-initiators. A few hundred people only broke off their protest in front of Parliament after Speaker Valeri Bganba announced that the rival bill proposing the legalisation of the sale of real estate to foreign citizens had been withdrawn. Bganba also declared that for Japua's resignation to be effective, it would have to be submitted to and approved by the other deputies. The following Thursday, 21 April, the moratorium was rejected by deputies, but instead a resolution was adopted to the same effect. The moratorium in its original form was criticised by Bganba as legally vacuous, because Parliament could not restrict its own law-making powers. On 29 April, he stated that Japua had withdrawn his resignation.|$|R

50|$|Oakland linebacker Rod Martin intercepted Eagles quarterback Ron Jaworski's {{first pass}} {{of the game}} and {{returned}} it 17 yards to Philadelphia's 30-yard line, setting up Jim Plunkett's 2-yard touchdown pass to Cliff Branch 7 plays later. After each team punted once, Jaworski threw a 40-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Rodney Parker, but the score was nullified by an illegal motion penalty on wide receiver Harold Carmichael, and the Eagles ended up being forced to punt. The Raiders later scored another touchdown with <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>left</b> in the quarter. On third down from the Oakland 20-yard line, Plunkett threw the ball to running back Kenny King at the 39-yard line as he was scrambling around in the backfield to avoid being sacked. King caught the pass as it carried just over the outstretched arms of defensive back Herman Edwards and took off to the end zone for a Super Bowl record 80-yard touchdown reception. The Raiders led 14-0 and tied the Miami Dolphins' record (which still stands) for the largest Super Bowl lead (14 points) {{at the end of the}} first quarter, set in Super Bowl VIII.|$|E

Kyle Roselle looked like he was in perfect position to make the play but was pushed forward and away from the play by Ty Tomlin. Howry ran 76 yards down the field untouched to give the Ducks their first lead of the ball game. Most Beaver fans who saw the game insist that Tomlin's block was in Roselle's back and thus illegal. Most Duck fans insist that the block was not in Roselle's back and thus clean. Whether Tomlin's block was legal or not, the touchdown stood. Oregon's Maurice Morris tacked on an eight-yard touchdown with 4:36 left, which appeared to put the game out of reach. However, the Beavers did not fold. They capped off an 11-play drive with a 24-yard Jonathan Smith to Josh Hawkins pass with 2:05 left, Smith's last touchdown pass. Smith hit Shawn Kintner for the two-point conversion to pull Oregon State within three at 17-14. However, the onside kick squirted out-of-bounds at the Beaver 45, which looked as if it would wrap up an Oregon victory. But on third-and-nine with 1:49 left, Joey Harrington rolled out. Kyle Roselle managed to strip the Heisman Trophy hopeful and Jake Cookus pounced on the ball at the Duck 33. However, the Beavers lost seven yards on two plays.

50|$|Alabama next {{faced the}} surging Bulldogs of Mississippi State at Humphrey Coliseum. The Crimson Tide was very {{hampered}} by injuries, inherently missing Dazon Ingram while also missing starter Shannon Hale due to injury and losing junior forward Michael Kessens (who started {{in place of}} Hale) to an injury during the game. The game was a close one throughout, and a clutch, acrobatic running jumper by Retin Obasohan with <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>left</b> in regulation tied the game at 67, ultimately forcing overtime.

Obasohan continued his all-SEC-caliber style of play, finishing with 25 points (his fifth-straight game with at least 20 points) and a career-high eight assists. The team followed that victory with an easy 80-71 win over a struggling Missouri squad. Five Tide players scored in double figures, Coleman Coliseum sold out {{for the third time}} of the season, and the win, coupled with the victory at MSU, signified back-to-back SEC wins for Alabama {{for the first time in}} nearly three years. Having built a little bit of momentum, the Crimson Tide turned to a major home game against #15 Texas A&M, who entered the game on a three-game SEC losing streak after starting 7-0 in the league. Alabama enjoyed nice contributions from essentially every scholarship player, including 16 points from Obasohan and a career-high ten rebounds from freshman forward Donta Hall, and the Tide held on for a thrilling 63-62 win over the Aggies. Anthony Collins, the SEC's leading free-throw shooter at the time, missed two potentially game-tying free throws for A&M with 2.3 seconds remaining in the game. This game marked Alabama's fourth win over a ranked team, a feat the school had not accomplished since the 2001-02 season. Hale returned from a two-game hiatus due to injury to play in this game, scoring ten points off the bench.|$|E

Gambit would go on to take a 7-6 lead, but the Swedes came back to win the half, 8-7. Gambit suddenly rocketed up to 14 rounds as Fnatic only took one round in the meantime to start the second half. Fnatic took one more round before a crucial 27th round, in which both teams had a full buy. About 20 seconds into the round, mou just about caught a peeking JW near the A Bombsite. The combination of KRiMZ and flusha took out a hiding Dosia, but AdreN was able to trade out flusha as Fnatic planted the bomb. olofmeister peeked to take down HObbit, but Zeus killing KRiMZ left olofmeister in a 1 vs. 3.

5000|$|An {{example of}} a style matchup was the {{historical}} fight of Julio César Chávez, a swarmer or in-fighter, against Meldrick Taylor, the boxer or out-fighter (see Julio César Chávez vs. Meldrick Taylor). The match was nicknamed [...] "Thunder Meets Lightning" [...] as an allusion to punching power of Chávez and blinding speed of Taylor. Chávez was the epitome of the [...] "Mexican" [...] style of boxing. Taylor's hand and foot speed and boxing abilities gave him the early advantage, allowing him to begin building a large lead on points. Chávez remained relentless in his pursuit of Taylor and due to his greater punching power Chávez slowly punished Taylor. Coming into the later rounds, Taylor was bleeding from the mouth, his entire face was swollen, the bones around his eye socket had been broken, he had swallowed {{a considerable amount of}} his own blood, and as he grew tired, Taylor was increasingly forced into exchanging blows with Chávez, which only gave Chávez a greater chance to cause damage. While there was little doubt that Taylor had solidly won the first three quarters of the fight, the question at hand was whether he would survive the final quarter. Going into the final round, Taylor held a secure lead on the scorecards of two of the three judges. Chávez would have to knock Taylor out to claim a victory, whereas Taylor merely needed {{to stay away from the}} Mexican legend. However, Taylor did not stay away, but continued to trade blows with Chávez. As he did so, Taylor showed signs of extreme exhaustion, and every tick of the clock brought Taylor closer to victory unless Chávez could knock him out.With <b>about</b> <b>a</b> <b>minute</b> <b>left</b> in the round, Chávez hit Taylor squarely with several hard punches and stayed on the attack, continuing to hit Taylor with well-placed shots. Finally, with about 25 seconds to go, Chávez landed a hard right hand that caused Taylor to stagger forward towards a corner, forcing Chávez back ahead of him. Suddenly Chávez stepped around Taylor, positioning him so that Taylor was trapped in the corner, with no way to escape from Chávez' desperate final flurry. Chávez then nailed Taylor with a tremendous right hand that dropped the younger man. By using the ring ropes to pull himself up, Taylor managed to return to his feet and was given the mandatory 8-count. Referee Richard Steele asked Taylor twice if he was able to continue fighting, but Taylor failed to answer. Steele then concluded that Taylor was unfit to continue and signaled that he was ending the fight, resulting in a TKO victory for Chávez with only two seconds to go in the bout.|$|E
