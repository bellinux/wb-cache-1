40|$|The {{data set}} {{used in our}} study is the T 2 LEAP {{database}}. T 2 LEAP, created by Statistics Canada, is a unique firm-level database that is the universe of incorporated firms that file a tax return and hire employees in Canada. The current version of the database covers the year 1984 to 1998. T 2 LEAP is a merger of two Canadian administrative databases. The first database, the Longitudinal Employment Analysis Project (LEAP), is used to identify de novo entry and exit, industry classification (at the 3 -digit SIC level), {{and the number of}} employees. The second database is the Corporate Tax Statistical Universe File (T 2 SUF). This database is used to assess firm specific annual financial variables such as profit, debt, equity, assets, sales and location. The employment record of each business is derived from <b>administrative</b> <b>taxation</b> records that each Canadian employer must file. The payroll data are associated with a Revenue Canada employer identification number. Firms enter into the LEAP database in the year they first hire employees (should they enter after 1984), and record their last entry in the database in the last year they have employees (should they exit before 1998). For each year, total payroll and employment are calculated. The latter is the average annual number of employees within the firm, or Average Labor Units (ALU). Measured by either output or employment, the database includes almost the entire Canadian private sector. The omitted components are non...|$|E

40|$|The {{goals of}} this article were to {{determine}} whether the efficiency of tax authorities in Croatia improved over the period 1997 - 2012 and to identify how their efficiency can be improved in the future. According to our research the <b>administrative</b> costs of <b>taxation</b> in Croatia, as a percentage of GDP, decreased slightly over the past fifteen years but still remain above the EU average. Thus, {{there is a need to}} reduce the <b>administrative</b> costs of <b>taxation,</b> first by identifying and abolishing nuisance taxes that raise very little revenue and have high administrative costs. Second, special attention should be devoted to analysing and reducing the service expenses of tax authorities (especially IT expenses and expenses for telephone, mail and transportation services). The main problem related to research into administrative costs in Croatia over a longer period is the lack of relevant and reliable data, and hence the Croatian tax authorities should collect more data and release them to the public...|$|R

It was excavated by the Channel 4 archaeological television programme Time Team, revealing the remains of a two-storey mansio built around a courtyard and also many other buildings. The site was enclosed by massive ramparts and ditches four metres wide and as deep which were dated by pottery finds to around 90 AD. The ditches were filled in by the mid-third century.
