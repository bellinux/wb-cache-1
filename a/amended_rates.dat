40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} {{that the presence of}} the capital femoral ossific nucleus confers protection against ischemic injury or avascular necrosis (AVN) at the time of reduction of a congenitally dislocated hip. The current literature is contradictory. A prospective study was undertaken of the clinical and radiologic outcomes following closed or open reduction. Fifty hips were included in the study. These cases had presented late or had failed conservative treatment. In 28 hips treatment was intentionally delayed until the appearance of the ossific nucleus (but not beyond 13 months) and in 22 the ossific nucleus was present at clinical presentation. Six hips reached the age of 13 months without an ossific nucleus appearing and progressed to treatment. The significant AVN rate (more than grade 1) was 7 % for closed reduction and 14 % for open. However, the <b>amended</b> <b>rate</b> if hips were excluded that had failed Pavlik harness treatment was 0. 0 % and 9 %, respectively (4 % overall). Further surgical procedures were necessary in 57 % of hips undergoing closed reduction and 41 % after open, which compares favorably with other series. The authors conclude that the presence of the ossific nucleus {{is an important factor in}} the prevention of AVN, particularly after late closed reduction. Intentional delay in the timing of surgery does not condemn a hip to open surgery, but there is a comparable rate of secondary procedures becoming necessary, particularly after closed reduction. A simultaneous pelvic procedure may be appropriate after late closed reduction. The delayed strategy to await the appearance of the ossific nucleus for previously untreated dislocation allows a simple treatment algorithm to be employed that produces good clinical and radiologic outcomes...|$|R

BC amendments increased soil pH by 0. 11 to 0. 24 and by 0. 09 to 0. 24 units, respectively, while the soil CaCl 2 -extracted Cd was reduced by 10. 1 % to 40. 2 % and by 10. 0 % to 57. 0 % in 2010 and 2011, respectively.

This is achieved via a coordinated interplay between the intestine, bone and kidney by <b>amending</b> the <b>rate</b> of absorption, storage and excretion, respectively. Discovery of the transient receptor potential (TRP) family identified several new ion channels acting as gatekeepers of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + transport in these epithelia, greatly increasing {{our understanding of}} the molecular processes that facilitate the movement of these minerals. In the intestine, TRP channels contribute to the saturable active transcellular movement of divalent cations from the lumen into the enterocyte. Furthermore, in bone, TRPV channels play important roles by influencing the osteoclastic resorption process, thereby contributing importantly to overall bone mineral content. The divalent cation-permeable TRPV 5 and TRPM 6 channels are located in the renal distal convolution, the main site of active transcellular Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + transport. The channels are regulated by a multitude of factors and hormones that contribute importantly to keeping the systemic concentrations of Ca 2 + and Mg 2 + within normal limits. Dysregulation of either channel impacts the renal reabsorptive capacity for these cations.

There has however been surprising resistance by Member States to any proposed amendments which might lead to a reduced rate differentiation. Thus giving weight to the intuition that once reduced rates of VAT are introduced it is almost politically impossible to remove then.

40|$|Background and Aims The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to test the suitability of greenwaste biochar to aid nitrogen (N) retention in rehabilitated bauxite-processing residue sand (BRS). Methods Bauxite residue sand was collected from the Alcoa of Australia Pinjarra refinery. The pH of BRS was adjusted to values of 5, 7, 8 and 9 and subsequently <b>amended</b> with different <b>rates</b> (1, 5, 10 and 20 %, w/w) of greenwaste biochar. The loss of N via NH 3 volatilization following addition of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) was determined using an acid trapping method. Results At low pH (5), increasing pH rather than adsorption capacity, resulting from biochar addition, caused greater losses of N through volatilization from BRS. In BRS with medium pH (7, 8), increasing adsorption capacity, induced by biochar addition, played the more dominant role in enhancing adsorption of NH 4 + -N /NH 3 -N and lowering NH 3 volatilization. In the BRS with high pH (9), the majority of NH 4 + -N /NH 3 -N pools was lost via NH 3 volatilization due to the strong acid-base reaction at this pH. Conclusions It is concluded that the interaction of changes in pH and adsorption capacity induced by greenwaste biochar addition affects the availability and dynamics of NH 4 + -N/ NH 3 -N in BRS amended with DAP.

Based on the values of the coefficient of correlation (R), the KostiakovÃ¢Â€Â™s model provided the best fit with experimental data for both fresh (FW) and burnt (BW) rice-mill waste for the two seasons. It was followed by the PhilipÃ¢Â€Â™s and then HortonÃ¢Â€Â™s models. However, transmissivity coefficients (A) of the PhilipÃ¢Â€Â™s model were negative while KostiakovÃ¢Â€Â™s coefficients were very insensitive to variations in application rates (q) of waste.

No studies have been reported that quantify {{the effects of these}} varying construction and maintenance practices on the playability of the skinned {{portions of}} infields. In Connecticut, USA, skinned infield plots were constructed from five different soils (silt loam, loam, coarse sandy loam, loamy sand, loamy coarse sand) and <b>amended</b> with four <b>rates</b> of calcined clay (0, 4. 9, 9. 8, 19. 6 kg m– 2) to determine the effects on surface hardness, traction, and ball-to-surface friction (static and dynamic) at varying soil moisture contents (10, 14, and 18 %). Bulk density, saturated hydraulic conductivity, and shear strength of the different soil–calcined clay rate combinations were determined. Increasing the rate of calcined clay decreased bulk density and shear strengths, and increased saturated hydraulic conductivity. Surface hardness increased more with coarse-textured soils and increasing calcined clay rate, but decreased more with fine-textured soils and increasing soil moisture. Increasing the calcined clay rate resulted in decreases in ball-to-surface static friction across all soils and decreased dynamic friction with the fine-textured soils. Increases in soil moisture increased friction in all soils. The fine-textured soils had greater traction than the sandy soils, but no consistent calcined clay or moisture effects on traction were observed. Shear strength of the soils was highly correlated with traction and friction. The results suggest that differences in skinned infield soils are quantifiable, which could lead to the development of playing surface standards...|$|R
40|$|Many extractors {{are used}} to {{quantify}} available P in soils, but few studies have assessed the availability of P in soils of the wet tropics <b>amended</b> with high <b>rates</b> of biosolids. In this study, ion exchange resin, Mehlich- 1 solution, and Fe-impregnated strips were used to quantify available P in samples from an Oxisol amended with surface-applied biosolids in a long-term field experiment. The soil's maximum capacity for P adsorption was also estimated. Experimental design consisted of randomized blocks, with four treatments and three replicates. Samples of biosolids were collected every year during the experiment, from 1999 to 2002. In 1999, two applications were made before growing maize (Zea mays L.) in austral summer and winter. Treatments were: Control (no biosolids added); B (biosolids added at rates based on their total N content); B 2 (biosolids added at {{twice the rate of}} B), and B 4 (biosolids added at four times the rate of B). Soil samples were collected at 0 - to 0. 1 -, 0. 1 - to 0. 2 -, and 0. 2 - to 0. 4 -m depths. Biosolids were broadcast applied and incorporated into the soil to a depth of 0. 2 m using a rotary hoe. The Oxisol had a high P-adsorption capacity (around 2450 mg kg(- 1)) because of its high contents of clay and Fe and Al oxides. All the extractors were effective at assessing P availability and were positively correlated among themselves. Available P soil contents correlated positively with P content in maize leaves and grains, and the resin method yielded the highest correlation with P contents in leaves and grains...|$|R
40|$|An {{increasing}} {{proportion of}} recycled fibers {{are used in}} paper industries due to their important environmental and economic benefits. However, removing the ink, clay, coatings and contaminants from paper waste {{in order to produce}} recycled fibers creates large amounts of de-inking paper sludge. For this reason, the preparation of biochar from pyrolysis process of this kind of waste rich in cellulose fibers, carbonates and clays, and their use in soil remediation contaminated by heavy metals can be perceived as an interesting valorization alternative. The aim of the present work is to study the influence of biochar from de-inking paper sludge (HP) pyrolysis in a Ni 2 + polluted soil. Selected soil (S) was artificially contaminated with Ni 2 + at 1000 mg Ni kg(- 1) (S 1000) and then <b>amended</b> at a <b>rate</b> of 5 wt% using HP and two biochars prepared from pyrolysis of HP at 300 degrees C (HP 300) and 500 degrees C (HP 500). Non-contaminated soil (S) was used as control and amended with the same rate of HP, HP 300 and HP 500. An incubation experiment was designed and soil CO 2 emissions were measured in the different treatments during 77 days. The results have shown that CO 2 emissions followed the order S = S + HP = S + HP 300 > S + HP 500 for the non-polluted soil and the patternS 1000 + HP 300 > S 1000 approximate to S 1000 + HP > S 1000 + HP 500 for the soil spiked with Ni. Finally, it was observed that HP 500 addition to the polluted soil reduced the quantity of mobile, leached and bioavailable Ni...|$|R
40|$|Sewage sludges {{added to}} arable land can improve soil {{fertility}} and physical properties. However, {{the concentrations of}} heavy metals commonly found in sludges limits their application to soil. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to evaluate the mobility of heavy metals (Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn) in four soils <b>amended</b> with different <b>rates</b> (0, 80, 60 and 320 t ha- 1) of anaerobically stabilized urban sewage sludge. Total metal content in the sewage sludge was Zn much greater than Cu > Pb > Ni much greater than Cd. Sludge, soils and sludge-soil mixtures were fractionated by the Tessier sequential extraction procedure. The fractions extracted by H 2 O 2 /HNO 3 and NH 2 OH. HCl were the most abundant pools for metals under study. The apparent mobility of metals in the sludge was Zn approximate to Cd approximate to Ni > Pb > Cu. The addition of sewage sludge in soils increased the percentages of metal extracted in non-residual fractions. ANOVA showed that the most significant increases were those of Zn, followed by Cu and Pb; there were no statistical differences (P < 0. 05) for Ni and Cd. Exchangeable Zn from sludge was immobilized in basic soils. The other trace metals showed no fraction redistribution. The soils and sludge-treated soil samples were also extracted with EDTA and DTPA. Extraction with EDTA was more sensitive to soil type, whereas extraction with DTPA showed wider variation with metals. Both chelates seemed to be more effective to assess the mobility of metals added with the sludges at low concentrations than the Tessier's chemical partitioning.

40|$|Two Lysimeter {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} Egypt to: explore possible effects of land-applying Al-WTRs and /or biosolids on the environment, and recommends ways to minimize human and animal impacts. The specific objectives were to (1) determine the co-application effects on Diethylene Triamine Penta Acetic acid (DTPA) -extractable heavy metals {{in relation to their}} accumulation in plant, (2) assess the effectiveness of WTRs in reducing bioavailability of heavy metals in the soils <b>amended</b> with different <b>rates</b> of biosolids, and (3) quantify the optimum application ratio of WTRs to biosolids in relation to the reduction of plant metal accumulation. Thus, in these lysimeter experiments, the WTRs and biosolids were obtained twice in 1999 and 2008. The used soil was classified as Typic torrifluvent. Treatments in both experiments consisted of the combination of WTRs (0, 20, 40, 80, and 160 Mg. ha- 1) and biosolids (0, 25, and 50 Mg. ha- 1, DW) by fixing one rate of biosolids and with varying the rate of WTRs. The results showed that land application of biosolids increases the accumulation of toxic metals in corn tissues in slightly alkaline soils. However, WTRs-application of (20, 40, 80 and 160 Mg. ha- 1) to the soil amended with (0, 25 and 50 Mg. ha- 1) of biosolids decreases significantly the DTPA-extractable metal concentrations. The reduction in DTPA-extractable metals resulting from the application of WTRs to biosolid-amended soils can be explained by formation of metal-sulfate, low solubility product, and the floc-adsorption and the co-precipitation processes, in which the formation of a mixed solid phase by the incorporation of metal ions into the crystal lattice of another precipitating solid phase is expected. The combined studies clearly demonstrate that Al-WTRs should have no negative impacts on the environment when appropriate rates are land applied. Thus, Al-WTRs are safe soil amendments to control heavy metals contamination in soil and water bodies...|$|R
40|$|Entomopathogenic {{nematodes}} in {{the genus}} Steinernema are promising biological control agents of soil insect pests. Two factors which may influence efficacy of biological control applications are virulence and dispersal of nematodes. This research examined {{the influence of}} fertilizers on the virulence of nematodes {{and the effects of}} earthworm presence on nematode dispersal;The virulence of Steinernema carpocapsae (Weiser) was determined in soil amended with fertilizer treatments of fresh cow manure, composted manure, and urea. Urea and fresh manure reduced nematode virulence in laboratory experiments. Field experiments, however, only indicated reduced nematode virulence in soil amended with fresh manure. Soil amended with composted manure did not affect nematode virulence;The effects of fertilizers on the ability of S. carpocapsae to control the black cutworm, Agrotis ipsilon (Hufnagel), were determined in a corn ecosystem. Fertilizer treatments included fresh cow manure, composted manure, and urea. Except in soil <b>amended</b> with high <b>rates</b> of fresh manure, nematode applications resulted in reduced cutworm damage relative to a control (no nematodes or fertilizers added). Analysis of black cutworm damage may be an efficient method to study effects of other biotic and abiotic factors on the efficacy of entomopathogenic nematodes in biological control;Vertical dispersal of S. carpocapsae, S. feltiae (Filipjev), and S. glaseri (Steiner) was determined in the presence and absence of the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris (L.). Nematode dispersal was evaluated through a bioassay and through direct extraction of nematodes from soil. Dispersal of S. carpocapsae and S. feltiae was increased in the presence of earthworms. Dispersal of S. glaseri was reduced in the presence of earthworms relative to absence of earthworms. The differences in effects of earthworms among nematode species may have been due to interspecific differences in dispersal behavior. In soil void of earthworms, dispersal of S. glaseri was greatest followed by dispersal of S. carpocapsae and then S. feltiae. The presence of earthworm burrows did not affect nematode dispersal. Therefore a phoretic relationship between the earthworms and nematodes is likely...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2006 The {{effect of}} serial (multiple-year) organic matter (OM) {{amendment}} on soil properties {{has been described}} in some cropping systems, although less {{is known about the}} effect of serially amended field soils on soil-borne plant diseases. The objectives of this study were to describe the effects of the third and fourth years of annual, serial amendment with dairy manure solids on 1) soil physical and biological properties and 2) severity of sweet corn root rot. Plots were <b>amended</b> with five <b>rates</b> of separated dairy manure solids annually for three years. In the fourth year, plots were split and only half of each plot was re-amended. Soil physical properties [bulk density, free and occluded particulate organic matter (POM), soil water retention, total porosity, gravimetric moisture content] and biological properties [microbial activity (as hydrolysis of fluorescein diacetate; FDA) and microbial biomass-C] were assessed each year in all treatments. Root rot severity was assessed in situ and in the greenhouse with multiple sweet corn (Zea mays L. cv Golden Jubilee) bioassays conducted in the amended field soils. Necrosis of the radicle and nodal roots was assessed when plants reached the 6 - leaf stage. Amendment rate was positively associated with increases in soil properties that serve as indicators of soil quality, such as POM content, total porosity, microbial biomass, and FDA activity. In the third year after amendment, weak root rot suppression was observed in-field and was associated with FDA activity. By the fourth year of serial amendment this trend was no longer evident, however evidence from the high-rate treatment that was not re-amended (3 HNRA) pointed to an emerging suppressive mechanism that persisted up to 13 months after the third amendment. Factors that may be interacting over time to generate observed disease suppression in these serially amended soils include: short-term post-amendment microbiostasis, soil moisture retention, inoculum potential, and a novel suppressive mechanism...|$|R
40|$|Through {{the centuries}} {{it became clear}} that sovereigns and states very often do not abide by their {{contractual}} undertakings either because they are unable to do so or because they are merely unwilling due to some or other whim or political reason. Examples of such actions can be found as far back as in the days of Dionysius of Syracuse and Phillip II of Spain, where the person in question either devalued the currency when he was pushed for payment or simply changed the terms of the agreement, <b>amended</b> interest <b>rates</b> and declared a debt standstill when it did not suit him to continue with payment. The reliance on reprisals and attachment of the person or goods of even the citizens of the country involved to ensure that the principle of pacta sunt servanda was properly adhered to continued until the early 1900 s, when it was thought that less violent methods should rather be used to force a sovereign to comply with its obligations. Gunboat diplomacy was no longer {{the order of the day}} and it was left to the creditors to rely on the courts for enforcement of their debts. If an individual or corporation were to renege on their obligations or indicate that they are no longer able to service their debts, insolvency proceedings exist that could be utilised in order to ensure that the creditors are treated equally and are paid. This option is not available in international law: there are no customary international law principles relating to insolvency that can be used to assist the creditors of sovereign debtors. In the past, ad hoc procedures were used to assist the so-called highly indebted poor countries via loans from the International Monetary Fund, negotiations through the Paris and London Clubs, debt restructuring and eventually mainly debt relief. The current situation in Europe is again calling for the establishment of an international insolvency regime that would be applicable to all states. The use of specific clauses in contracts (eg collective action clauses) assists only a small group of creditors and then only the super-majority of those; a code of conduct; the creation of an international insolvency tribunal or even an arbitration tribunal are also possible solutions that can be considered, even the conclusion of a treaty in terms of which these problems can be solved. However, no matter what, if politics do not take a back seat in this car, nothing is going to change. States have to keep to their obligations: it is their contractual and moral duty. Instead of dealing with the problems that arise after a state's insolvency, the focus should be on prevention. Why should a state end up in a situation where it cannot service its debts? Is the provision of credit too cheap? Are the risks properly quantified? The rule normally is that the lower the risk the cheaper the credit and vice versa. Are creditors insisting on the provision of proper security? Is the international community prepared to assist creditors in enforcing their rights against sovereigns in national courts? Unless there is a movement back to the principles of the law and pacta sunt servanda is rigorously enforced, we are not going to have legal certainty in dealings with sovereigns; and unless the international community is going to be prepared to refrain from falling back on politics, there will not be an easy answer and solution to the problem of state bankruptcies...|$|R
