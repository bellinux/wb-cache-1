This was a [...] "cycle of 4", since it took four jumps until it got back to the start letter. Another cycle on the same day might be AFWA, or a [...] "cycle of 3". If there were enough messages on a given day, all the letters of the alphabet might be covered by a number of different cycles of various sizes. The cycles would be consistent for one day, and then would change to a different set of cycles the next day. Similar analysis could be done on the 2nd and 5th letters, and the 3rd and 6th, identifying the cycles in each case and the number of steps in each cycle.|$|R
