50|$|Ericsson {{ignored the}} growth of {{automatic}} telephony in the United States and concentrated on manual exchange designs. Their first dial telephone was produced in 1921, although sales of the early <b>automatic</b> <b>switching</b> <b>systems</b> were slow until the equipment had proven itself on the world's markets. Telephones of this period had a simpler design and finish, {{and many of the}} early automatic desk telephones in Ericsson's catalogues were magneto styles with a dial on the front and appropriate changes to the electronics. Elaborate decals decorated the cases. World War I, the subsequent Great Depression, and the loss of its Russian assets after the Revolution slowed the company's development and restricted its sales to countries such as Australia.|$|R
5000|$|Gilbert Sandford Vernam (3 April 1890 [...] - [...] 7 February 1960) was a Worcester Polytechnic Institute 1914 {{graduate}} and AT&T Bell Labs engineer who, in 1917, invented an additive polyalphabetic stream cipher and later co-invented an automated one-time pad cipher. Vernam proposed a teleprinter cipher {{in which a}} previously prepared key, kept on paper tape, is combined character by character with the plaintext message to produce the ciphertext. To decipher the ciphertext, the same key would be again combined character by character, producing the plaintext. Vernam later worked for the Postal Telegraph Company, and became an employee of Western Union when that company acquired Postal in 1943. His later work was largely with <b>automatic</b> <b>switching</b> <b>systems</b> for telegraph networks.|$|R

5000|$|The Great Kantō {{earthquake}} struck Japan in 1923. 140,000 {{people were}} killed and 3.4 million were left homeless. [...] Four of NEC's factories were destroyed, killing 105 of NEC's engineers and workers. Thirteen of Tokyo's telephone offices were destroyed by fire. Telephone and telegraph service was interrupted by damage to telephone cables. In response, the Ministry of Communications accelerated major programs to install automatic telephone switching systems and enter radio broadcasting. [...] The first automatic switching systems were the Strowger-type model made by Automatic Telephone Manufacturing Co. (ATM) in the United Kingdom. NEC participated in the installation of the automatic switching systems, ultimately becoming the general sales agent for ATM. NEC developed its own Strowger-type <b>automatic</b> <b>switching</b> <b>system</b> in 1924, a first in Japan. One of the plants almost leveled during the Kanto earthquake, the Mita Plant, was chosen to support expanding production.

40|$|Commuters are {{regularly}} exposed to short-term peak concentration of traffic produced nanoparticles (i. e. particles < 300  nm in size). Studies indicate that these exposures pose {{adverse health effects}} (i. e. cardiovascular). This study aims to obtain particle number concentrations (PNCs) and distributions (PNDs) inside and outside a car cabin whilst driving on a road in Guildford, a typical UK town. Other objectives are to: (i) investigate the influences of particle transformation processes on particle number and size distributions in the cabin, (ii) correlate PNCs inside the cabin to those measured outside, and (iii) predict PNCs in the cabin based on those outside the cabin using a semi-empirical model. A fast response differential mobility spectrometer (DMS 50) was employed in conjunction with an <b>automatic</b> <b>switching</b> <b>system</b> to measure PNCs and PNDs in the 5 – 560  nm range at multiple locations {{inside and outside the}} cabin at 10  Hz sampling rate over 10  s sequential intervals. Two separate sets of measurements were made at: (i) four seats in the car cabin during ∼ 700  min of driving, and (ii) two points, one the driver seat and the other near the ventilation air intake outside the cabin, during ∼ 500  min of driving. Results of the four-point measurements indicated that average PNCs at all for locations were nearly identical (i. e. 3. 96, 3. 85, 3. 82 and 4. 00  ×  104  cm− 3). The modest difference (∼ 0. 1 %) revealed a well-mixed distribution of nanoparticles in the car cabin. Similar magnitude and shapes of PNDs at all four sampling locations suggested that transformation processes (e. g. nucleation, coagulation, condensation) have minimal effect on particles in the cabin. Two-point measurements indicated that on average, PNCs inside the cabin were about 72 % of those measured outside. Time scale analysis indicated that dilution was the fastest and dominant process in the cabin, governing the variations of PNCs in time. A semi-empirical model was proposed to predict PNCs inside the cabin as a function of those measured outside. Performance evaluation of the model against multiple statistical measures was within the recommended guidelines for atmospheric dispersion modelling. Trip average PNCs obtained using the model demonstrate a reasonably good correlation (i. e. R 2  =  0. 97) with measured values...|$|E
