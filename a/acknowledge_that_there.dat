5|$|Criticism often arises after single acts of {{violence}} committed during fights. For example, on March 21, 2007, Colton Orr of the New York Rangers fought with Todd Fedoruk of the Philadelphia Flyers and ended up knocking Fedoruk unconscious. Fedoruk already had titanium plates in his face from a fight {{earlier in the season}} with Derek Boogaard. The resulting media coverage of the incident renewed calls for a fighting ban. Some players <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no harm in discussing the issue; however, most players and administrators continue to insist that fighting stay as a permanent element of organized ice hockey. Some league administrators, such as former NHL senior vice-president and director of hockey operations Colin Campbell, have been circulating the idea of banning fighting in response to incidents such as the Fedoruk–Orr fight.|$|E
25|$|Although no {{invertebrates}} {{have been}} identified as endangered or vulnerable, it is important to <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are a plethora of invertebrates within the Cape Byron Marine Park which are critical {{to the health of the}} local ecosystems. These include a variety of molluscs such as the gold ring cowries (Cypraea annulus), Crustaceans such as the Zebra Shrimp (Ganthophylum americanum) and a specimen of the seven armed sea star (Luidia australiae). These Invertebrates have been noted as they are not usually found in areas and climates such as the Cape Byron Marine Park. The Zebra Shrimp and the seven armed sea star are rarely found in intertidal habitats and the gold ring cowries share a tropical affinity and demonstrate a rare occurrence in which the Cape Byron Marine Park is a habitat for both temperate and tropical species.|$|E

The press release read, [...] "Both parties <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a difference of opinion about where the show should go moving forward, and conclude that it is best to part ways." [...] Scott M. Gimple succeeded Mazzara as showrunner for season four, with new writers joining the writing staff, such as Curtis Gwinn, Channing Powell, and Matt Negrete.|$|E

He expressed {{the view that}} while he regretted his involvement in them, he was not ashamed of having done so: [...] "though some of my former beliefs were mistaken, I will never <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was anything dishonourable about holding them." [...] As leader of the NF he continued to openly approve of Hitler's social and economic program and well as his policies of German territorial expansion. In his 1988 autobiography The Eleventh Hour, he stated that while he thought that [...] "many of [...] intentions were good ones {{and many of his}} achievements admirable", he did not think [...] "that it is right for a British movement belonging to an entirely different phase of history to model itself on the movement of Hitler".|$|E
500|$|The techno soundtrack {{and general}} audio were also praised by critics. Robinson {{recognised}} that techno music featured {{played an important}} part in the Wipeout series, opining that the entire game is set to a [...] "now-standard thumping soundtrack". Additionally, Robinson enjoyed how the music was filtered out each time the player an airborne jump. Roper similarly acknowledged that soundtracks have always been {{an integral part of the}} Wipeout franchise, and said that the music tracks in Wipeout HD [...] "work perfectly in line" [...] with both visuals and the overall racing experience by blending into the background. Regarding the sound effects, Roper noted that [...] "there aren't too many", although he appreciated the few ones that are in the game. Cocker felt that the game's soundtrack was enjoyable for fans of electronica, although he liked the fact that players could import their own playlists to the game, an aspect he thought that introduced more variation. In cohesion with other critics, Cocker recognised that music was important to the franchise, and commended the mix of techno, dubstep, and drum and bass soundtracks. Orry stated that the game featured a [...] "brilliant" [...] soundtrack, and also commended its integrated custom soundtrack support. Goyon praised the electro-orientated music, stating that the sound [...] "sticks well" [...] to the futuristic universe of Wipeout, and also enjoyed the idea of playing customised music if the player did not like the standard soundtrack. Although Davis noted the lack of [...] "huge acts" [...] like The Prodigy, Daft Punk, or The Chemical Brothers (all of whom were featured in Wipeout 2097), he did <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were still [...] "plenty of chilly synths" [...] and [...] "thumping backbeats" [...] to listen to.|$|E

2500|$|Proponents {{of young}} Earth creationism are {{regularly}} accused of quote mining, {{the practice of}} isolating passages from academic texts that appear to support their claims, while deliberately excluding context and conclusions to the contrary. For example, scientists <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are indeed a number of mysteries about the Universe left to be solved, and scientists actively {{working in the fields}} who identify inconsistencies or problems with extant models, when pressed, explicitly reject creationist interpretations. Theologians and philosophers have also criticized this [...] "God of the gaps" [...] viewpoint.|$|E
2500|$|Critics and {{commentators}} broadly held Frasier in high regard. Caroline Frost {{said that the}} series overall showed {{a high level of}} wit, but noted that many critics felt that the marriage of Daphne and Niles in season ten had removed much of the show's comic tension. Ken Tucker felt that their marriage made the series seem desperate for storylines, while Robert Bianco felt that it was symptomatic of a show that had begun to dip in quality after so much time on the air. Kelsey Grammer acknowledged the creative lull, saying that over the course of two later seasons the show [...] "took itself too seriously". Commentators do, however, <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was an improvement following the return of the writers Christopher Lloyd and Joe Keenan, although not necessarily to its earlier high standards.|$|E

2500|$|Gamergate {{has been}} {{described}} as being driven by anti-feminist ideologies. [...] Some supporters have denied this, but <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are misogynistic voices within Gamergate. Antonsen, Ask, and Karlstrom wrote in Nordic Journal of Science and Technology Studies [...] "in the case of #gamergate, it is the explicit goal of many of the participants to exclude groups of people, particularly women, from the debate and from the game industry and limit women's rights as citizens." [...] Jon Stone, in The Guardian, called it a [...] "swelling of vicious right-wing sentiment" [...] and compared it to the men's rights movement. Commentators such as Jon Stone, Liana Kerzner and Ryan Cooper have said that the controversy is being exploited by right-wing voices and by conservative pundits who had little interest in gaming. Chrisella Herzog states that in addition to violent sexism, Gamergate has virulent strains and violent sentiments of homophobia, transphobia, anti-Semitism, racism, and neo-Nazism. Some in the gamergate movement went on {{to be part of the}} alt-right.|$|E
2500|$|Amos' {{brother died}} in a car crash in 2005 and it is widely {{believed}} that the song that closes the album, Our New Year, deals with her own thoughts and feelings behind his tragic demise. However, when asked, Amos chose to keep the meaning of the song private, [...] "I think {{at this time of year}} you think of people that might not be in your life anymore or who’ve left the planet. I get really nostalgic at Christmas, and memories of other times with other people who you might not have heard from in a long time can cross your mind." [...] Finally, when asked pointedly if she had anyone in mind when writing the song, Amos responded definitively, [...] "I did. But, we’ll leave it there." [...] "People get nostalgic and you have to <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are people that aren’t with you anymore, so there’s a song that does that. But," [...] Amos insisted, [...] "for the most part, for a Tori record, it’s pretty upbeat." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that a person involved in the incident of March 10, 2004 hospital room meeting with John Ashcroft has said that much of the confusion and conflicting testimony that occurred about intelligence activities was because certain programs were so classified that they were impossible to speak about clearly. The DOJ Inspector General recognized that Gonzales was in the difficult position of testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee about a highly classified program in an open forum On July 31, 2007, Director of National Intelligence J. Michael McConnell confirmed, in a letter to Senator Specter, that the activities publicly referred to [...] "as the TSP did not exhaust the activities subject to periodic authorization by the President. [...] Gonzales was then able to explain publicly, on August 1, 2007, that while TSP [...] "was an extraordinary activity that presented novel and difficult issues and was, as , the subject of intense deliberations within the Department," [...] the aspect of Mr. Comey's advise [...] that prompted the Gang of Eight meeting on March 10, 2004, was not about TSP, but was about another or other aspects of the intelligence activities in question, which activities remain classified. [...] Comey himself acknowledged that the nature of the disagreement at issue on March 10, 2004, is [...] "a very complicated matter", but he declined to discuss in a public setting. Professor Jack Goldsmith appears to <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a difference between TSP and other classified intelligence activities that prompted the March 10, 2004 Gang of Eight meeting and visit to General Ashcroft's hospital room.|$|E

2500|$|There is {{significant}} {{controversy over the}} presence of Eastern Cougars in the U.P. Historically, {{the last of the}} species, or subspecies, was extirpated near Newberry in 1906, although there have been sightings of the creatures over the years since. These reports increased in number over {{the first decade of the}} 21st century. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Environment (DNRE) formed a four-person team to investigate sightings in the state. The biologists with the DNRE currently do not believe that there is a breeding population anywhere in the state, rather that the sighted animals are visitors to the state. As late as January 2007, the DNRE's official position was that no cougars lived in Michigan. Several residents in the state disagree with both current and previous positions on the part of the DNRE. Researchers at Central Michigan University and the Michigan Wildlife Conservancy in 2006 published the findings of a study using DNA analysis of fecal samples taken in the Upper and Lower peninsulas that showed the presence of cougars at the time. These results were disputed in a second journal article in 2007 by other researchers from Eastern Michigan University and the U.S. Forest Service. A citizen's group, the Michigan Citizens for Cougar Recognition (MCCR), independently tracked sightings and in 2009 listed Delta County as the location with the greatest number of reports in the state. The DNRE verified five sets of tracks and two trail camera photos in Delta, Chippewa, Marquette, and Menominee counties since 2008. DNRE officials <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are cougars in the UP, but not elsewhere in the state. Critics of the DNRE's position on the species, including the founder of the MCCR, say that the department is attempting to [...] "avoid paying for a cougar management program".|$|E
2500|$|No Isis album {{contains}} an explicit , or story arc, instead focusing on themes rather than stories. As such, releases {{are defined by}} some as [...] "pseudo-concept albums". The band see lyrics as important, {{but at the same}} time, Turner does not feel it necessary to enunciate every word. Instead, any connections made are mainly conjecture, and the formation of a theme takes into account the album artwork, previous albums, track titles and the use of metaphor just as much as lyricism. Oceanic tells a convoluted tale involving love, incest and suicide by drowning. This relates to the theme of the all-powerful female, present lyrically in every album except Panopticon. Turner does not explicitly acknowledge an [...] "overtly feminine theme"; however, he does state: [...] "I just think it's interesting to include that as part of what we do, simply because metal, especially, is considered to be this very male-oriented, testosterone-driven art form, and I feel like it's important to recognize the other side of our nature. As manly as we might or might not be, we have to <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a feminine part of our persona, and that the world isn't made up of absolutes. To achieve balance, you have to recognize every facet of yourself and everyone else around you." [...] Certain threads do reappear between albums, notes Turner. [...] "There are certain themes which reoccur in my work just because of what I'm interested in and what is aesthetically pleasing for me", he says. [...] "The idea of futuristic utopias and dystopias is probably something that does consciously and subconsciously return time and time again [...] and sometimes I just can't help the fact that these themes creep into my work whether it's conscious or not". The other two ongoing motifs in the lyrics and artwork are that of towers and mosquitos.|$|E
2500|$|There {{has been}} {{significant}} resistance to adopting a westernized, mainstream feminist approach to Indigenous rights and self-determination. The most significant criticism of mainstream feminism {{has been its}} marginalization of minorities and lack of racial diversity. White feminists [...] "are extraordinarily reluctant to see themselves in the situation of being oppressors, as they feel {{that this will be}} at the expense of concentrating upon being oppressed." [...] The priority of white women's needs before those of Indigenous women have a historical root, and therefore make Indigenous feminists weary of homogenizing the rights of [...] "women". While Indigenous women may <b>acknowledge</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is overlap in the goals of Indigenous feminists and mainstream feminists, many, like Celeste Liddle (Arrernte) [...] "strongly believe that as Aboriginal women, whilst our fights are related to ongoing feminist struggles within other racially marginalised groups, they are not the same." [...] An argument made by Minnie Grey in her essay, From the Tundra to the Boardroom to Everywhere in Between, about feminism is how it often fails to look beyond female oppression at other issues, such as class, education, and the effects of oppression has on men. [...] "We, as Inuit women, have been striving for such things as equal pay for equal work, equal share of roles {{for the good of the}} family, equal rights to participate in the decision-making processes of our governments, equal rights for the hiring of women at all levels of commerce and science, equal rights in education, and most importantly, equal rights to raise our children in safe, healthy, and positive conditions. This means, among other things, above the poverty line. I look at these aspirations not as women's liberation, but as people's liberation. In fact, we need and love our men, and similarly, we need to liberate them from the concepts that bind them to unbreakable traditional roles that, in turn, keep the status quo intact in many regions of the world."One such example of the need to incorporate uniquely Indigenous perspectives is in the second wave's struggle for wage parity with their male counterparts. Celeste Liddle argues that [...] "for example, whilst equal pay is important for all of us, for many years Aboriginal people were historically not paid for their labour at all." [...] Therefore, the second wave's fight for wage equality (among other issues), was perceived to push the rights of Indigenous women to the periphery.|$|E
