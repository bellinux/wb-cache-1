5000|$|Although P. obovatum is {{primarily}} {{thought to be}} saprotrophic, it can cause infections in human hosts under certain circumstances, and more rarely, of other animals notably dogs. The capacity of Phialemonium obovatum to grow at and above human body temperature is a key pathogenicity factor of this species that distinguishes it from many other dematiaceous molds. This species has been reported as a causative agent of endocarditis, keratitis, peritonitis, osteomyelitis, subcutaneous infections, and infections arising secondary to burns. In case studies involving infections following severe burns, the hyphae of P. obovatum {{have the ability to}} invade into blood vessels and tissues. Infections caused by this species are largely opportunistic and restricted to immunocompromised individuals with few cases reported from individuals with normally functional immune systems. It has a proclivity to invade central nervous system tissues. Given the rising population burden of immunocompromised people due to improved management of immunological diseases or mediate by therapeutic side effects, this and other agents of opportunistic disease are sometimes considered to be [...] "emerging" [...] agents of disease. Accordingly, P. obovatum and other dematiaceous fungi have been increasingly reported in <b>allogenic</b> <b>transplant</b> recipients possibly as a consequence of chemotherapeutic immune suppression primarily intended to reduce tissue rejection.|$|E

40|$|Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and graft {{rejection}} are major problems following intestinal transplantation (IT). Natural killer (NK) cells {{may be important}} effector cells in both conditions. In this study, Sprague-Dawley (SD) or SD-Brown Norway (BN) F 1 rat intestine was transplanted into BN recipients with and without associated graft mesenteric lymphadenectomy (GML). Cyclosporine (15 mg/kg day) was administered to all animals. Pieces of the intestinal graft were examined 4 days posttransplant and again at death. NK activity calculated using intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IL) was determined utilizing an 18 -hr cytotoxic assay assessing 51 Cr release {{and the results are}} reported as lytic units. YAC- 1 cells were used as the target. NK activity was reduced 4 days after IT both in native (8. 02 +/- 0. 64) and in grafted bowel (3. 14 +/- 1. 51), with histological evidence of rejection as compared with that of control bowel in ungrafted rats (21. 1 +/- 2. 14).

40|$|Background and aims: We {{report a}} case of a 27 -year-old male {{affected}} by acute myeloid leukaemia MLL-PTD positive. After autologous stem cell transplantation, he was monitored based on cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus and human herpes virus 6 (HHV- 6) DNA quantification in blood. Relapse occurred one year after transplantation; then the patient underwent to allogenic bone marrow transplantation using genotypically HLA-identical donor (sister). HHV- 6 DNAemia was positive and persistently elevated, either after autologous either after <b>allogenic</b> <b>transplant</b> suggesting the occurrence of HHV- 6 chromosomally integration. The work aim is to prove the occurrence of chromosomally integrated-HHV- 6 (ci-HHV- 6). Materials and Methods: HHV- 6 DNA extraction was performed by automated extractor and DNA was amplified-quantified by Real Time polymerase chain reaction. Species identification was performed by sequencing HHV 6 -U 100 glycoprotein using automated sequencer and sequencing products were analysed using the Blast program. Results: After autologous transplantation HHV 6 -DNAemia was 5. 4 log copies/mL setting to 3. 9 log copies/mL for a long period post allogenic transplantation. The patient’s hair follicles were tested for HHV- 6 DNA having positive results. Sequences of both strains of HHV 6 extracts from blood and hair follicles resulted species B. HHV 6 viral load decreased significantly after Lymphocyte Infusion by ci-HHV 6 negative donor (sister), having steady viral load during the following six months of monitoring. One year later, patient is in complete haematological remission. Conclusions: Detection of HHV- 6 in hair follicles and HHV- 6 DNAemia persistently elevated before <b>allogenic</b> <b>transplant,</b> confirm the occurrence of ci-HHV- 6. The observed important decreasing viral load is potentially due to the successful engraftment of ci-HHV- 6 -negative donor marrow after allogeneic transplant...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the aptitude of TRAIL gene expression for inducing apoptosis in co-cultivated T-cells. This should allow preparing a strategy for the development of a durable, allogenic skin substitute based on the induction of an immune-privileged transplant. In order to counteract the significant potential of rejection in <b>transplanted</b> <b>allogenic</b> keratinocytes, we created a murine keratinocyte cell line which expressed TRAIL through stable gene transfer. The exogenic protein was localized on the cellular surface and was not found in soluble condition as sTRAIL. Contact to TRAIL expressing cells in co-culture induced cell death in sensitive Jurkat-cells, which was further intensified by lymphocyte activation. This cytotoxic effect is due to the induction of apoptosis. We therefore assume that the de-novo expression of TRAIL in keratinocytes can trigger apoptosis in activated lymphocytes and thus prevent the rejection of keratinocytes in <b>allogenic,</b> immune-privileged <b>transplants.</b> </p...|$|R

Excellent engraftment rates are associated with a very low incidence of acute and chronic GVHD and regimen-related mortality even in patients who are over 50 years old.

Autologous transplantation, on the other hand, as a result of advances in the use of peripherally collected cells instead of bone marrow, prophylactic antimicrobials and heparin, has an associated morbidity and mortality at St Vincent‟s of less than 1 %.

40|$|ABSTRACT PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} remote ischemic preconditioning (IPC-R) in the fetal small bowel transplantation model. METHODS: Two groups were constituted: The Isogenic transplant (ISO, C 57 BL/ 6 mice, n= 24) and the <b>allogenic</b> <b>transplant</b> (ALO, BALB/c mice, n= 24). In each group, the animals were distributed with and without IPC-R. It was obtained the following subgroups: Tx, IPC-R, Fk, IPC-Fk, in both strains. Intestinal grafts were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemically. RESULTS: The graft development evaluation in ISO group showed that IPC-R reduced the development compared with ISO-Tx (5. 2 ± 0. 4 vs 9. 0 ± 0. 8) and IPC-R-Fk increased the graft development compared with IPC-R (11. 2 ± 0. 7 and 10. 2 ± 0. 8). In ALO group, IPC-Fk increased the development compared with ALO-Tx and ALO with IPC-R (6. 0 ± 0. 8, 9. 0 ± 1. 2, 0. 0 ± 0. 0, 0. 5 ± 0. 3). The PCNA expression was increased in ISO group treated with Fk and IPC-R compared to other groups (12. 2 ± 0. 8 vs Tx: 8. 8 ± 0. 9, IPC-R: 8. 0 ± 0. 4 and Fk: 9. 0 ± 0. 6).

40|$|Background: Chronic venous {{insufficiency}} (CVI) represents a major {{global health problem}} with increasing prevalence and morbidity. CVI is due to an incompetence of the venous valves, which causes venous reflux and distal venous hypertension. Several {{studies have focused on}} the replacement of diseased venous valves using xeno- and <b>allogenic</b> <b>transplants,</b> so far with moderate success due to immunologic and thromboembolic complications. Autologous cell-derived tissue-engineered venous valves (TEVVs) based on fully biodegradable scaffolds could overcome these limitations by providing non-immunogenic, non-thrombogenic constructs with remodeling and growth potential. Methods: Tri- and bicuspid venous valves (n= 27) based on polyglycolic acid-poly- 4 -hydroxybutyrate composite scaffolds, integrated into self-expandable nitinol stents, were engineered from autologous ovine bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) and endothelialized. After in vitro conditioning in a (flow) pulse duplicator system, the TEVVs were crimped (n= 18) and experimentally delivered (n= 7). The effects of crimping on the tissue-engineered constructs were investigated using histology, immunohistochemistry, scanning electron microscopy, grating interferometry (GI), and planar fluorescence reflectance imaging. Results: The generated TEVVs showed layered tissue formation with increasing collagen and glycosaminoglycan levels dependent on the duration of in vitro conditioning. After crimping no effects were found on the MSC level in scanning electron microscopy analysis, GI, histology, and extracellular matrix analysis. However, substantial endothelial cell loss was detected after the crimping procedure, which could be reduced by increasing the static conditioning phase. Conclusions: Autologous living small-diameter TEVVs can be successfully fabricated from ovine BM-MSCs using a (flow) pulse duplicator conditioning approach. These constructs hold the potential to overcome the limitations of currently used non-autologous replacement materials and may open new therapeutic concepts for the treatment of CVI in the future...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Mesenchymal {{stem cells}} (MSCs), which possess {{immunosuppressive}} characteristics on induced T-cells, {{were shown to}} be applicable in prevention and treatment of graft-versus-host disease. However, knowledge of effective cell sources is still limited. In this study, MSCs from different human tissues, i. e. bone marrow (BM), Wharton’s jelly (WJ), and adipose tissue, were isolated, and the immune suppression of stimulated T cells was analyzed comparatively. Materials and Methods: MSCs were co-cultured with phytohemagglutinin-induced T-cells with co-culture techniques with and without cell-to-cell contact. After co-culture for 24 and 96 h, the proliferation rate of T cells was estimated by carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester and apoptosis by annexin V/PI methods. Both T cells and MSCs were analyzed with respect to gene expressions by real-time polymerase chain reaction and their specific protein levels by ELISA. Results: The results showed that all three MSC lines significantly suppressed T-cell proliferation; BM-MSCs were most effective. Similarly, T-cell apoptosis was induced most strongly by BM-MSCs in indirect culture. In T cells, the genes in NFkB and tumor necrosis factor pathways were silenced and the caspase pathway was induced after co-culture. These results were confirmed with the measurement of protein levels, like transforming growth factor β 1, IL- 6, interferon-γ, interleukin (IL) - 2, and tumor necrosis factor-α. Additionally, IL- 17 A was detected in high levels in WJ-MSC co-cultures. We showed that IL- 17 A-producing Tregs are the key mediators {{in the treatment of}} graft-versus-host disease. Conclusion: BM-MSCs, which have been used in clinical applications for a while, showed the greatest immunosuppressive effect compared to other MSCs. However, a promising cell source could also be WJ, which is also effective in suppression with fewer ethical concerns. We described the molecular mechanism of WJ-MSCs in <b>allogenic</b> <b>transplants</b> for the first time...|$|R
40|$|The prime {{cause of}} failure of a transplanted kidney is {{immunological}} rejection of the graft. Graft rejection will not occur, when the transplanted organ is obtained from a donor which is genetically identical to the recipient (isogenic transplant). Graft rejection can always occur, when donor and recipient are genetically different (<b>allogenic</b> <b>transplant).</b> Unrelated people are always genetically different. Only when donor and recipient are monozygotic twins, complete genetic identity exists. Thus a transplanted organ will be antigenic, when donor and recipient are not monozygotic twins. The immune reaction, evoked by the antigens of such an allograft, consists of two components. In the first place, antibodies will be produced, which are specifically directed against the transplanted antigens (the so called humoral immune response). Secondly, immune reactive cells are generated, which specifically can attack the transplanted organ (the cellular immune response). The mechanism {{of the destruction of}} the allograft is complicated and only partly known. Both different types of antibodies and different types of cells are involved. Microscopically, arteritis and a cellular infiltrate can be seen (Busch et al., 1977). Progressive damaging of the glomeruli and tubuli results in a increasing loss of function of the transplanted kidney. Two factors determine the strength of the immune reaction of the recipient against the allograft. These factors are the immune response potential of the recipient and the strength of the antigenic stimulus (Lengerova, 1969). The strength of the antigenic stimulus is dependent on the immunogenetic difference between donor and recipient. Consequently, two methods are available to prevent allograft rejection, namely modification of the immune response and selection of compatible donor-recipient pairs...|$|E
40|$|Plasma cell leukemia (PCL) is a {{rare and}} {{aggressive}} plasma cell disorder, characterized {{by the presence of}} a peripheral blood absolute plasma cell count of at least 2 × 109 /l and more than 20 % circulating plasma cells. The prognosis of PCL patients remains poor. Even by using autologous or <b>allogenic</b> <b>transplant</b> procedures, median survival does not exceed 3 years (Saccaro et al., 2005). Thalidomide, bortezomib and lenalidomide (Revlimid) have emerged as high active agents in the treatment of PCL (Johnston and abdalla, 2002; Musto et al., 2007; Finnegan et al., 2006). In particular, Lenalidomide is a structural analogue of thalidomide with similar but more potent biological activity; it is used as first line therapy in MM (Palumbo et al., 2007; Niesvizky et al., 2007), although information regarding its associated use with dexamethasone use as salvage therapy in PCL derives from anecdotal single case reports (Musto et al., 2008).

40|$|Conventional {{chemotherapy}} {{has been}} used in the treatment of multiple myeloma. However the development of autologous stem cell transplant represented a major advance in its therapy. Complete response (CR) rates to the tune of 40 - 45 % were seen and this translated into improvements in progression-free survival and also overall survival in some studies. As a result the autologous stem cell transplants (ASCT) is the standard of care in eligible patients and can be carried out with low treatment-related mortality. <b>Allogenic</b> <b>transplant</b> carries the potential for cure but the high mortality associated with the myeloablative transplant has made it unpopular. Reduced Intensity Stem Cell Transplants (RIST) have been tried with varying success but {{with a high degree of}} morbidity as compared to the ASCT. Introduction of newer agents like thalidomide, lenalidomide, bortezomib and liposomal doxorubicin into the induction regimens has resulted in higher CR and very good partial response rates (VGPR) as well as improvement in ease of administration. These drugs have also proved useful in patients with adverse cytogenetics. Recent trials suggest that this has translated into improvements in response rates post-ASCT. There is a suggestion that patients achieving CR/nCR or VGPR after induction therapy should be placed on maintenance and ASCT then could be used as a treatment strategy at relapse. All these trends however await confirmation from further trials. Tandem transplants have been used to augment the results obtained with ASCT and have demonstrated their utility in patients who achieved only a partial response or stable disease in response to the first transplant as well as patients with adverse cytogenetics. Incorporation of bortezomib along with melphalan into the conditioning regimen has also been tried. RIST following ASCT has been tried with varying success but does not offer any major advantage over ASCT and is associated with higher morbidity. It is hoped that recent advances in therapy will contribute greatly to improved survival...|$|E
40|$|Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD) is {{a common}} {{complication}} in <b>allogenic</b> bone marrow <b>transplants</b> and in some cases, it involves the oral mucosa. Therefore, the appropriate diagnosis and timely treatment is essential to prevent local complications which interfere with normal oral functions and facilitate infection spread. We report a 17 years old woman with GVHD associated to lichenoid and ulcerative lessions in the oral mucosa, which responded to the topical administration of a 0. 1 % tacrolimus ointmen...|$|R

To the Editor: We present {{the case of}} a 12 -year-old boy with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma that was treated with an <b>allogenic</b> bone marrow <b>transplant</b> from a related donor. The patient developed acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) that was brought under control with cyclosporin and systemic corticosteroids. Approximately 100 days after the transplant, the patient began to develo...|$|R
40|$|Epidermal keratinocytes {{are used}} as a cell source for {{autologous}} and <b>allogenic</b> cell <b>transplant</b> therapy for skin burns. The question addressed here is {{to determine whether the}} culture process may induce cellular, molecular, or genetic alterations that might increase the risk of cellular transformation. Keratinocytes from four different human donors were investigated for molecular and cellular parameters indicative of transformation status, including (i) karyotype, (ii) telomere length, (iii) proliferation rate, (iv) epithelial-mesenchymal transition, (v) anchorage-independent growth potential, and (vi) tumorigenicity in nude mice. Results show that, despite increased cell survival in one keratinocyte strain, none of the cultures displayed characteristics of cell transformations, implying that the culture protocol does not generate artefacts leading to the selection of transformed cells. We conclude that the current protocol does not result in an increased risk of tumorigenicity of transplanted cells...|$|R
