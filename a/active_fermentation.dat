40|$|The {{initiation}} of fermentation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{is associated with}} a rapid drop in stress resistance. This is disadvantageous for several biotechnological applications, e. g. the preparation of freeze doughs. We have isolated mutants in a laboratory strain which are deficient in fermentation-induced loss of stress resistance ('fil' mutants) using a heat shock selection protocol. We show that the fil 1 mutant contains a mutation in the CYR 1 gene which encodes adenylate cyclase, It causes a change at position 1682 of glutamate into lysine and results in a tenfold drop in adenylate cyclase activity. The fil 1 mutant displays a reduction in the glucose-induced cAMP increase, trehalase activation and loss of heat resistance. Interestingly, the fil 1 mutant shows the same growth and fermentation rate as the wild type strain, as opposed to other mutants with reduced activity of the cAMP pathway. Introduction of the fil 1 mutation in the vigorous Y 55 strain and cultivation of the mutant under pilot scale conditions resulted in a yeast that displayed a higher freeze and drought resistance during <b>active</b> <b>fermentation</b> compared to the wild type Y 55 strain.

Similar results are reported by the artificial introduction of carbon dioxide into the rumen. Sheep showing paralysis of the rumen, caused by KCN, are able to eructate two litres of gas per minute introduced through the ruminal fistula.

40|$|It {{has long}} been known that {{bacterial}} fermentation of cellulose in the rumen is associated with the production of a mixture of lower fatty acids, methane and carbon dioxide. It was first shown by Pringsheim (1912) and later confirmed by Woodman & Stewart (1928) that the addition of toluene to thermophilic cultures of cellulose-splitting bacteria resulted in the accumulation of glucose, and Woodman (1930) suggested that glucose was the product that was of nutritional value to the animal. Broadly speaking, theories regarding digestion of cellulose fall into two categories; those that emphasize the importance of the chemical products of fermentation, glucose and the lower fatty acids, and those that regard the food eaten by the animal as a substrate upon which the organisms of the rumen thrive, the bacteria and Protozoa forming the end-product which is subsequently digested by the sheep. Pochon (1935, 1938) put forward an ingenious explanation which belongs to the first school of thought; he isolated a cellulose-splitting organism which he named Plectridiwn cellulolytiam from the rumen of the ox and found that if the pH of the medium in which <b>active</b> cellulose <b>fermentation</b> was proceeding was reduced to 4, glucose accumulated.

However, {{a major problem}} is unbalanced flavour production when these fermentors are used {{for the production of}} alcoholic beverages. One of the keys to obtaining better control over flavour formation may be the concentration of dissolved CO 2, which has inhibitory effects on yeast growth and metabolism. This article demonstrates that the presence of immobilisation matrices facilitates the removal of CO 2 from the liquid medium, which results in a low level of dissolved CO 2 during fermentation. Moreover, the formation of volatile higher alcohols and esters was greatly enhanced in the immobilised-cell system when compared to the free cell system. By sparging a CO 2 flow (45 ml/min) into the immobilised-cell system, cell growth was reduced by 10 - 30 % during the <b>active</b> <b>fermentation</b> stage, while the fermentation rate was unaffected.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{expression}} and {{activity of the}} different Saccharomyces cerevisiae hexose uptake systems (Hxt) and the kinetics of glucose uptake are considered essential to industrial alcoholic fermentation performance. However, the dynamics of glucose uptake kinetics during the different stages of fermentation, depending on glucose and nitrogen availability, is very poorly characterized. The objective of the present work was to examine thoroughly the alterations occurring in glucose uptake kinetics during alcoholic fermentation, by the wine strain S. cerevisiae PYCC 4072, of a synthetic grape juice basal medium with either a limiting or non-limiting initial nitrogen concentration and following nitrogen supplementation of the nitrogen-depleted sluggish fermentation. Results Independently of the initial concentration of the nitrogen source, glucose transport capacity is maximal {{during the early stages}} of fermentation and presumably sustained by the low-affinity and high-capacity glucose transporter Hxt 1 p. During nitrogen-limited sluggish fermentation, glucose uptake capacity was reduced to approximately 20 % of its initial values (V max [*]=[*] 4. 9 [*]¬±[*] 0. 8 compared to 21. 9 [*]¬±[*] 1. 2 [*]Œºmol[*]h - 1 10 - 8 cells), being presumably sustained by the low-affinity glucose transporter Hxt 3 p (considering the calculated K m [*]=[*] 39. 2 [*]¬±[*] 8. 6 [*]mM). The supplementation of the sluggish fermentation broth with ammonium led to the increase of glucose transport capacity associated to the expression of different glucose uptake systems with low and high affinities for glucose (K m [*]=[*] 58. 2 [*]¬±[*] 9. 1 and 2. 7 [*]¬±[*] 0. 4 [*]mM). A biclustering analysis carried out using microarray data, previously obtained for this yeast strain transcriptional response to equivalent fermentation conditions, indicates that the activation of the expression of genes encoding the glucose transporters Hxt 2 p (during the transition period to <b>active</b> <b>fermentation)</b> and Hxt 3 p, Hxt 4 p, Hxt 6 p and Hxt 7 p (during the period of <b>active</b> <b>fermentation)</b> may have {{a major role in the}} recovery of glucose uptake rate following ammonium supplementation. These results suggest a general derepression of the glucose-repressible HXT genes and are consistent with the downregulation of Mig 1 p and Rgt 1 p. Conclusions Although reduced, glucose uptake rate during nitrogen-limited fermentation is not abrogated. Following ammonium supplementation, sluggish fermentation recovery is associated to the increase of glucose uptake capacity, related to the de novo synthesis of glucose transporters with different affinity for glucose and capacity, presumably of Hxt 2 p, Hxt 3 p, Hxt 4 p, Hxt 6 p and Hxt 7 p. This study is a contribution to the understanding of yeast response to different stages of alcoholic fermentation at the level of glucose uptake kinetics, in particular under nitrogen limitation or replenish, which is useful knowledge to guide fermentation practices. </p...|$|E

Similarly, acid-adapted cells showed greatly improved survival in low-pH foods (orange juice and salad dressing) containing acids other than lactic acid.

Potentiometric titration under aerated water (so not as normally in factories) showed that 'Buds' ('Pecco': best quality leaves) contained more ascorbid acid (AA) and fermented more rapidly than older leaves. More withered leaves fermented more actively and completely. Optimum temperature for fermentation was found to be about 26 ¬∞C. Aeration to a certain point encouraged fermentation strongly. Thorough grinding promoted fermentation most. AA had to be oxidized to allow reddish brown discoloration of fermenting tea-leaves. 'Buds' oxidized AA much quicker than older leaves.

Thirty-six cheesemaking trials were carried out in a dairy: 12 with 0. 2 % of young whey starter addition, 12 with 0. 4 % and 12 as control. The addition of young whey starter improved the coagulation properties of the cheese milk and did not affect the normal succession of thermophilic and mesophilic lactic acid bacteria during the cheese ripening. The chemical composition of the ripened cheeses was not affected by the practice of whey starter addition. From the sensory point of view, the addition of natural whey starter improved the compliance scores and decreased the defects, as eyes and cracks.

In this study, the yeast disruptome was screened for mutants with differential susceptibility to stress induced by high ethanol concentrations in minimal growth medium.

The most significant gene ontology terms enriched in this data set are those associated with intracellular organization, biogenesis, and transport, in particular, regarding the vacuole, the peroxisome, the endosome, and the cytoskeleton, and those associated with the transcriptional machinery. Clustering the proteins encoded by the identified determinants of ethanol resistance by their known physical and genetic interactions highlighted {{the importance of the}} vacuolar protein sorting machinery, the vacuolar H+-ATPase complex, and the peroxisome protein import machinery. Evidence showing that vacuolar acidification and increased resistance to the cell wall lytic enzyme Œ≤-glucanase occur in response to ethanol-induced stress was obtained. Based on the genome-wide results, the particular role of the FPS 1 gene, encoding a plasma membrane aquaglyceroporin which mediates controlled glycerol efflux, in ethanol stress resistance was further investigated. FPS 1 expression contributes to decreased [3 H]ethanol accumulation in yeast cells, suggesting that Fps 1 p may also play a role in maintaining the intracellular ethanol level during <b>active</b> <b>fermentation.</b> The increased expression of FPS 1 confirmed the important role of this gene in alcoholic fermentation, leading to increased final ethanol concentration under conditions that lead to high ethanol production...|$|E
40|$|The Mekong Delta {{region of}} South Vietnam is {{particularly}} {{known as a}} production area of purple glutinous rice wine (Ruou Nep Than). The latter differs from regular rice wine for its sherry-like taste and flavour and its attractive brown-red colour. Wine is made from purple glutinous rice at home or by small cottage industries, by washing, soaking, steam-cooking, cooling and inoculation of the cooled rice with powdered rice-wine starter (Men). The fermentation takes place in two stages, i. e. an aerobic phase which is dominated by mycelial fungi from Men that convert rice starch into glucose, and an anaerobic phase during which an <b>active</b> alcoholic <b>fermentation</b> {{is caused by the}} yeasts originating from Men. Of pure isolates from Vietnamese rice wine starters Amylomyces rouxii (CBS 111757) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (LU 1250) were selected as a powerful glucose producer and a superior fermentative strain, respectively. These were shown to be compatible in mixed cultures, which is of importance for the production of starters with good quality. The development of a laboratory-scale process to formulate defined mixed-culture starter granules was established. The process was based on traditional starter manufacturing methods and modified where appropriate, as determined by optimization experiments. The herbs "Tieu Hoi" (Fennel: Foeniculum vulgare Miller) and "Dinh Huong" (Clove: Syzygium aromaticum L.) as supplementary ingredients were observed to stimulate the yeast and mould growth. Starter m ould viability and its enzymatic activity were found to be quite stable during a 3 months storage test. Yeast activity is most likely the limiting factor for shelf-life and stability of starter. The dry matter content of starter granules is one of the factors influencing the shelf-life of the starter. Based on Vietnamese standard 3215 - 79 the wine produced with experimental dehydrated defined mixed-culture starter was assessed as superior compared with commercially available rice wines, particularly because of its flavour and overall acceptability...|$|R
40|$|The rate {{of ethanol}} {{production}} per milligram of cell protein begins to {{decline in the}} early stage of batch fermentation before high concentrations of ethanol have accumulated. In yeast extract-peptone medium (20 % glucose), this initial decline appears {{to be related to}} growth and to result in part from a nutrient deficiency. The addition of yeast extract, peptone, and ashed preparations of these restored the ability of glucose-reconstituted medium (in which cells had been previously grown) to support vigorous growth. Magnesium was identified as the <b>active</b> component. Supplementing <b>fermentations</b> with 0. 5 mM magnesium prolonged exponential growth, resulting in increased yeast cell mass. The addition of magnesium also reduced the decline in fermentative activity (micromoles of CO 2 evolved per hour per milligram of protein) during the completion of batch fermentations. These two effects reduced the time required for the conversion of 20 % glucose into ethanol by 1 / 3 with no measurable loss in ethanol yield (98 % of theoretical maximum yield). It is possible that some of the reported beneficial effects of complex nutrients (soy flour and yeast extract) for ethanol production also result from the correction of a simple inorganic ion deficiency, such as magnesium...|$|R
40|$|Samples from {{different}} industrial grape cultivars were {{collected during the}} vintage season from the vineyard of the winery (the ¬´Shabo¬ª winery Company, located in the Odesa region, Ukraine). The following industrial cultivars of grapes were selected for the research: Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Sauvignon, Riesling Rhenish, Aligote, Rkatsiteli, Bastardo, Traminer, Telti Kuruk, Grinosh. The grape cultivars were cultivated on the sandy soils in the district located between the Black Sea and the Dnestrovsky estuary. Grape must derived {{from different}} grape cultivars was placed into sterile glass flasks to half of the 450 ml flask volume. Each flask was carefully closed with a rubber stopper with an injection needle in it. During the fermentation process, {{it was necessary to}} remove carbon dioxide, which was present as a result of <b>active</b> anaerobic <b>fermentation</b> processes in the grape must. At the end of grape must fermentation, pure yeast cultures were isolated using traditional microbiological methods by consistent inoculation of a sample into a Petri dish with a few modifications of nutrient selective agar for yeast isolation and cultivation. Primary yeast isolation was carried out using Inhibitory Mold Agar medium (Becton Dickinson Company, USA). The yeast culture morphological properties were analyzed after the primary yeast culture isolation. Yeasts were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using universal yeast primers. After yeast culture identification, the next step in yeast cultivation was carried out on Wort Agar medium (Becton Dickinson Company, USA). Each isolated, and identified yeast culture was deposited in the Genebank of Japan, MAFF culture Collection, Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan and (NCYC) - Yeast Culture Collection (National Collection of Yeast Cultures, Institute of Food Research, Norwich, United Kingdom). Each yeast culture was tested for technological characteristics such as growth resistance to high temperature (+ 42 ¬∞C) and low temperature (+ 6 ¬∞C), growth at low pH 2. 6 ‚Äì 3. 0 (acid resistance), growth in the presence of 5, 10, and 15...|$|R
