5|$|A tornado is a violently {{rotating}} {{column of}} air {{that is in}} contact with both {{the surface of the}} earth and a cumulonimbus cloud or, in rare cases, the base of a cumulus cloud. Also referred to as twisters, a collequial term in America, or cyclones, <b>although</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> cyclone is used in meteorology, in a wider sense, to name any closed low-pressure circulation.|$|E
5|$|Opera as a {{dramatic}} genre originated {{around the turn}} from the 16th to the 17th centuries, <b>although</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> itself was not in use before 1650. Precursors of musical drama included pastoral plays with songs and choruses, and the madrigal comedies of the late 16th century. Monteverdi had already {{established himself as a}} leading composer of madrigals before writing his first full-length operas in the years 1606–08, {{while he was in the}} service of Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua. These works, L'Orfeo and L'Arianna, deal respectively with the Greek myths of Orpheus and Ariadne. After a disagreement in 1612 with Vincenzo's successor, Duke Francesco Gonzaga, Monteverdi moved to Venice to take up the position of director of music at St Mark's Basilica, where he remained until his death in 1643.|$|E

25|$|<b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> polychrome {{is created}} from the {{combining}} of two Greek words, {{it was not}} used in ancient Greece. The term was coined {{in the early nineteenth}} century by Antoine Chrysostôme Quatremère de Quincy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> beak was, in the past, {{generally}} {{restricted to}} the sharpened bills of birds of prey, in modern ornithology, the terms beak and bill are {{generally considered to be}} synonymous. The word, which dates from the 13th century, comes from the Middle English bec, which itself comes from the Latin beccus.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} {{group in the}} tales of the First Age were the Edain. <b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> Edain refers to all Men, the Elves use it to distinguish those Men who fought {{with them in the}} First Age against Morgoth in Beleriand. Those Men who fought against Morgoth in the First Age were divided into three Houses.|$|E

50|$|<b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> {{faith and}} belief are {{sometimes}} erroneously conflated {{and used as}} synonyms, faith properly refers to a particular type (or subset) of belief, as defined above.|$|R
25|$|<b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> {{has come}} to {{describe}} a trend of dress and culture modeled after African-Americans, it is inherently problematic because of its origins. The soundtrack of Wild Style was marketed in Japan as a cassette with a book of photos-scenes from the film, neighborhoods, breakers, graffiti, etc. Japan's hip hop contributions have been perceived {{by many to be}} based more on appearances than anything else.|$|E
25|$|<b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> hooponopono was not used, early Hawaiian historians {{documented}} {{a belief}} that illness was caused by breaking kapu, or spiritual laws, and that the illness could not be cured until the sufferer atoned for this transgression, often {{with the assistance of}} a praying priest (kahuna pule) or healing priest (kahuna lapaau). Forgiveness was sought from the gods or from the person with whom there was a dispute.|$|E
25|$|<b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> latent means hidden or invisible, {{in modern}} usage for {{forensic}} science the term latent prints means any chance or accidental impression left by friction ridge skin on a surface, {{regardless of whether}} it is visible or invisible at the time of deposition. Electronic, chemical and physical processing techniques permit visualization of invisible latent print residues whether they are from natural sweat on the skin or from a contaminant such as motor oil, blood, ink, paint or some other form of dirt. The different types of fingerprint patterns, such as arch, loop and whorl, will be described below.|$|E

25|$|The Royal Australian Engineers (RAE) is a {{corps of}} the Australian Army (<b>although</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> corps {{does not appear}} in their name or on their badge). The RAE is ranked fourth in {{seniority}} of the corps of the Australian Army, behind the Staff Cadets, Armoured and Artillery Corps. The corps was formed by the amalgamation of the various colonial engineer corps of the states and territories of Australia in 1902 and since then has served in various conflicts including World War I, World War II and the Vietnam War. The corps has also served on numerous peacekeeping operations and was heavily involved in the Australian contribution to the war in Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|The {{controversy}} {{followed the}} HKEAA's announcement in 2007 {{that if a}} candidate exceeded the word limit (500 words) in a task in Section E (Practical skills for work and study), anything written beyond the limit would not be marked. However, according to the marking guidelines issued the previous year, students who did so should be deducted only two marks from the style mark for doing so. That resulted in criticism by many students, who claimed that <b>although</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> limit instruction was stated in the paper, they were not clearly informed of the marking criteria and that the marking scheme the HKEAA adopted {{in the previous year}} gave them a misleading impression. The authority later stated that candidates should have read all instructions before attempting the questions. It also stated that candidates who followed the instructions strictly should be treated fairly.|$|E
500|$|The Thoroughbred is a horse breed {{best known}} for its use in [...] horse racing. <b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> {{thoroughbred}} is sometimes used to refer to any breed of purebred horse, it technically refers only to the Thoroughbred breed. Thoroughbreds are considered [...] "hot-blooded" [...] horses that are known for their agility, speed, and spirit.|$|E

500|$|Hugh Urban {{notes that}} <b>although</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] appears {{as early as}} the Atharva Veda, the first use of it as a proper name is in the Kathaka Grhya Sutra (19.7). Kaali appears in the Mundaka Upanishad (section 1, chapter 2, verse 4) not {{explicitly}} as a goddess, but as the black tongue of the seven flickering tongues of Agni, the Hindu god of fire.|$|E
500|$|The first {{texts to}} use [...] "tefillin" [...] are the Targumim and Peshitta {{and it is}} also used in {{subsequent}} Talmudic literature, <b>although</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "ṭoṭafah" [...] was still current, being used with the meaning of [...] "frontlet." [...] "Tefillin" [...] may have derived from the Aramaic palal, [...] "to plead, pray," [...] a word closely related to the Hebrew tefillah, [...] "prayer." [...] Jacob ben Asher (14thcentury) suggests that [...] "tefillin" [...] is derived from the Hebrew pelilah, [...] "justice, evidence," [...] for tefillin act as a sign and proof of God's presence among the Jewish people.|$|E
500|$|In English-language use, {{the word}} Bahá'í [...] is used either as an {{adjective}} {{to refer to}} the Bahá'í Faith or as a term for a follower of Bahá'u'lláh. The word is not a noun meaning the religion as a whole. It is derived from the Arabic Bahá' (...) , meaning [...] "glory" [...] or [...] "splendor", <b>although</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> Bahá'í [...] is actually derived from its use as a loan word in Persian, in particular the [...] "'i" [...] suffix is Persian rather than Arabic. The term [...] "Bahaism" [...] (or [...] "Baha'ism") is still used, mainly in a pejorative sense.|$|E

50|$|<b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> emblem and symbol {{are often}} used interchangeably, an emblem is a pattern {{that is used to}} {{represent}} an idea or an individual. An emblem crystallizes in concrete, visual terms some abstraction: a deity, a tribe or nation, or a virtue or vice.|$|R
500|$|Porpoises {{are small}} {{cetaceans}} {{of the family}} Phocoenidae. They are distinct from dolphins, <b>although</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> [...] "porpoise" [...] {{has been used to}} refer to any small dolphin, especially by sailors and fishermen. The most obvious visible {{difference between the two groups}} is porpoises have spatulate (flattened) teeth distinct from the conical teeth of dolphins. In addition, porpoises are relatively r-selected compared with dolphins: that is, they rear more young more quickly than dolphins. All seven species have small flippers, notched tail flukes, and no beaks. All carry at least 11 pairs of small teeth in their upper and lower jaws.|$|E
500|$|The Christian {{doctrine}} of the Session of Christ or heavenly session says that Jesus Christ is seated at the right hand of God the Father in Heaven—the word [...] "session" [...] is an archaic noun meaning [...] "sitting." [...] <b>Although</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> formerly meant [...] "the act of sitting down," [...] its meaning is somewhat broader in current English usage, and is {{used to refer to}} a sitting for various reasons, such as a teaching session, or a court or council being in session. The New Testament also depicts Jesus as standing and walking in Heaven, but the Session of Christ has special theological significance because of its connection to the role of Christ as King. The Session of Christ is one of the doctrines specifically mentioned in the Apostles' Creed, where [...] "sitteth on the right hand of God the Father Almighty" [...] immediately follows the statement of the Ascension.|$|E
500|$|A tornado is {{a rapidly}} {{rotating}} column of air {{that is in}} contact with both {{the surface of the}} Earth and a cumulonimbus cloud or, in rare cases, the base of a cumulus cloud.

Tornadoes come in many shapes and sizes, and they are often visible {{in the form of a}} condensation funnel originating from the base of a cumulonimbus cloud, with a cloud of rotating debris and dust beneath it. Most tornadoes have wind speeds less than , are about [...] across, and travel a few miles (several kilometers) before dissipating.
