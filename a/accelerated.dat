5|$|Starting 10 {{million years}} ago, {{vertical}} movement along the Sierra fault started to uplift the Sierra Nevada. Subsequent tilting of the Sierra block {{and the resulting}} <b>accelerated</b> uplift of the Sierra Nevada increased the gradient of western-flowing streams.

Additional uplift occurred when major faults developed to the east, especially the creation of Owens Valley from Basin and Range-associated extensional forces.

30|$|When {{using an}} IL as a {{conducting}} material for SEM observation, the <b>accelerating</b> voltage of the SEM {{is an important}} factor to consider (Ishigaki et al. 2011 a). The images of the biofilms strongly depend on <b>accelerating</b> voltage (Figure  4), and it appears that the subsurface structure of the biofilm is observed better at higher <b>accelerating</b> voltages because the electrons are able to penetrate deeper into the specimen. This is an advantage of the IL method, and allows both the surface and subsurface structure to be imaged. When imaging IL-treated cultured human cells by SEM, the samples were easy to charge up at <b>accelerating</b> voltages of 10 – 15  kV, which are the optimum <b>accelerating</b> voltages for platinum-coated samples (Ishigaki et al. 2011 a). In contrast, a high <b>accelerating</b> voltage did not charge up the biofilm samples treated with ILs in this study. To observe the outermost surface of the biofilm, 1  kV {{is believed to be the}} most suitable <b>accelerating</b> voltage, but such a low <b>accelerating</b> voltage gives poor image resolution.|$|R

5|$|A {{key feature}} of the Cadet Nurse Corps program was its <b>accelerated</b> {{training}} curricula. Participating schools of nursing were required to compress the traditional nursing program of 36 months to 30 months. They were also bound to provide the students with the four clinical experiences of medical, surgical, obstetrics, and pediatrics. The students became senior cadets {{in the last six}} months before graduation, requiring them to serve in a federal or civilian hospital. They rendered full-time service equivalent to that of a graduate nurse. During their first nine months of service, the cadets were protected by regulation from working on the wards for more than 24 hours each week. Junior cadets typically worked between 40 and 48 hours each week, including classes. Senior cadets were free of classes. All State Boards of Nursing modified their regulations to agree with the <b>accelerated</b> program.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the coherent and incoherent nonparaxial Weber beams, theoretically and numerically. We {{show that the}} superposition of coherent self-accelerating Weber beams with transverse displacement cannot display the nonparaxial <b>accelerating</b> Talbot effect. The reason is that their lobes do not <b>accelerate</b> in unison, which is a requirement for {{the appearance of the}} effect. While for the incoherent Weber beams, they naturally cannot display the <b>accelerating</b> Talbot effect but can display the nonparaxial <b>accelerating</b> properties, although the transverse coherence length is smaller than the beam width, based on the second-order coherence theory. Our research method directly applies to the nonparaxial Mathieu beams as well, and one will obtain similar conclusions as for the Weber beams, although this is not discussed in the paper. Our investigation identifies families of nonparaxial <b>accelerating</b> beams that do not exhibit the <b>accelerating</b> Talbot effect, and in addition broadens the understanding of coherence properties of such nonparaxial <b>accelerating</b> beams.
