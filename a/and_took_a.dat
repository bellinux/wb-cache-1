5|$|The Australians {{crossed the}} border into South Africa and Davidson scored 100 <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> total of 4/62 against Transvaal as Craig's men started with a nine-wicket win. The next match was against a South African XI, and was {{effectively}} a dress rehearsal for the Tests. Davidson scored 34 <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> total of 7/103 as the Australians crushed the hosts by an innings. He rounded off his Test preparation with match figures of 6/35 against Border and a 76 against Western Province.|$|E

5|$|A larger crowd {{attended}} on {{the second}} day, including more men. Amelia Bloomer arrived late <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> seat in the upstairs gallery, there being none left in the main seating area. Quaker James Mott was well enough to attend, and he chaired the morning meeting; it was still too radical a concept that a woman serve as {{chair in front of}} both men and women.|$|E
5|$|A second {{forerunner of}} the Analytical Review was Paul Henry Maty's {{periodical}} A New Review (published 1782–86), which was likewise devoted to reviewing books and offering {{a summary of}} their contents. Like its successor, the New Review paid special attention to foreign literature <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> leading role in introducing German literature to the British public.|$|E
5|$|At 01:44, as Mikawa's ships headed {{towards the}} Allied {{northern}} force, Tenryū and Yūbari split {{from the rest}} of the Japanese column <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> more westward course. Furutaka, either because of a steering problem, or to avoid a possible collision with Canberra, followed Yūbari and Tenryū. Thus, the Allied northern force was about to be enveloped and attacked from two sides.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the {{following}} season, McCabe appeared with the New South Wales Colts team in one match against Queensland, before being selected for the New South Wales Second XI to play their Victorian counterparts. McCabe scored 60 not out in the second innings <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> total of 6/100 for the match. He was selected to represent New South Wales in his first-class debut against Queensland in the 192829 Sheffield Shield season while the Test players competed against England. He made 60 and 34, and bowled 17 overs without success, but was later omitted when the Test players returned from international duty. In four first-class matches in his debut season, McCabe scored 197 runs at 32.83 <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> total of 1/111. McCabe played twice against the touring England cricket team led by Percy Chapman, once in a match at Goulburn for the Southern Districts of New South Wales, and the other time for his state, but managed only 24 runs in three innings.|$|E

5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the second season, Conrad and Wahler had ended their relationship, while Montag began dating Spencer Pratt. Montag increasingly spent more time with Pratt and neglected her friendship with Conrad, which placed a strain on the pair's friendship. Consequentially, Conrad strengthened her relationship with her friend Lo Bosworth <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> romantic interest in Pratt's friend Brody Jenner. Montag and Pratt moved into an apartment together in the season finale, at which point Patridge became Conrad's new housemate.|$|E
5|$|Caro Martínez was re-elected mayor (primer alcalde) of Pichilemu in 1897, 1900, and 1903. On 7 May 1905, {{just one}} year before his fourth term expired, he decided to resign to the primer alcalde office, <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> {{position}} as segundo alcalde of Pichilemu until 1906. Following his resignation, Francisco Javier Asalgado became the mayor, and held the office between that year and 1909, and again in 1912, but only {{for less than a}} month.|$|E
5|$|Davidson {{started the}} tour well, when Australia arrived in Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) to play two tour matches against the Rhodesia.

He made 82 as Australia scored 9/516 declared <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> 321-run first innings lead, but England could not be dismissed in the second innings and salvaged a draw. He continued his form with an unbeaten 104 against Kent between the Tests.|$|E
5|$|In 1838, Greeley met Albany editor Thurlow Weed. Weed {{spoke for}} a liberal {{faction of the}} Whigs in his {{newspaper}} the Albany Evening Journal.

5|$|In 1977, the Huntington Civic Arena was {{constructed}} on one parcel. One year later, {{a group of}} entrepreneurs wanted to construct a 350-room hotel and retail stores, however, the plan died by 1980. In 1983, the National Shamrock Development and Investment Company wanted to develop the property <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> two-year lease on the project. By mid-1985, however, the lease ran out and the developers could not receive financial backing due to the failure in their $15 million Urban Development Action Grant request.|$|E

5|$|In 2006 all-rounder Trent Johnston became Ireland's first ODI captain. He {{stepped down}} as captain in early 2008 <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> break from cricket as he was {{struggling}} with injury problems. William Porterfield succeeded Johnston as Ireland's full-time captain in April 2008. On occasions when Porterfield has been unavailable, sometimes due to commitments with his county side, Kyle McCallan and Kevin O'Brien have filled the role of captain.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} races of the 2012 season, Cancellara showed a good form: he powered {{to a second}} victory on the gravel roads of the Strade Bianche <b>and</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> victory in the closing time trial of the Tirreno–Adriatico. In {{the final of the}} first {{monument}} of the year, Milan–San Remo, he was the strongest rider during the descent of the Poggio, but was outsprinted for victory by Simon Gerrans.|$|E
