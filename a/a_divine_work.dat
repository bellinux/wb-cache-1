2500|$|The {{dominant}} and widely accepted view among Latter Day Saints {{is that the}} Book of Mormon is a true and accurate account of these ancient American civilizations whose religious history it documents. Joseph Smith, whom most Latter Day Saints believe to have translated the work, stated, [...] "I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book." [...] Unresolved issues of the book's historicity {{and the lack of}} supporting archaeological evidence have led some adherents to adopt the position that the Book of Mormon may have been the creation of Smith, but that it was nevertheless divinely inspired. Between these two views is the view held by some Latter Day Saints that the Book of Mormon is <b>a</b> <b>divine</b> <b>work</b> of a spiritual nature, written in ancient America, but that its purpose is to teach of Christ and not {{to be used as a}} guide for history, geology, archaeology, or anthropology.|$|E

60|$|Nevertheless, Evangelicalism {{had brought}} into palpable {{existence}} and operation in Milby society that idea of duty, that recognition {{of something to}} be lived for beyond the mere satisfaction of self, which is to the moral life what {{the addition of a}} great central ganglion is to animal life. No man can begin to mould himself on a faith or an idea without rising to a higher order of experience: a principle of subordination, of self-mastery, has been introduced into his nature; he is no longer a mere bundle of impressions, desires, and impulses. Whatever might be the weaknesses of the ladies who pruned the luxuriance of their lace and ribbons, cut out garments for the poor, distributed tracts, quoted Scripture, and defined the true Gospel, they had learned this--that there was <b>a</b> <b>divine</b> <b>work</b> to be done in life, a rule of goodness higher than the opinion of their neighbours; and if the notion of a heaven in reserve for themselves was a little too prominent, yet the theory of fitness for that heaven consisted in purity of heart, in Christ-like compassion, in the subduing of selfish desires. They might give the name of piety to much that was only puritanic egoism; they might call many things sin that were not sin; but they had at least the feeling that sin was to be avoided and resisted, and colour-blindness, which may mistake drab for scarlet, is better than total blindness, which sees no distinction of colour at all. Miss Rebecca Linnet, in quiet attire, with a somewhat excessive solemnity of countenance, teaching at the Sunday school, visiting the poor, and striving after a standard of purity and goodness, had surely more moral loveliness than in those flaunting peony-days, when she had no other model than the costumes of the heroines in the circulating library. Miss Eliza Pratt, listening in rapt attention to Mr. Tryan's evening lecture, no doubt found evangelical channels for vanity and egoism; but she was clearly in moral advance of Miss Phipps giggling under her feathers at old Mr. Crewe's peculiarities of enunciation. And even elderly fathers and mothers, with minds, like Mrs. Linnet's, too tough to imbibe much doctrine, were the better for having their hearts inclined towards the new preacher as a messenger from God. They became ashamed, perhaps, of their evil tempers, ashamed of their worldliness, ashamed of their trivial, futile past. The first condition of human goodness is something to love; the second, something to reverence. And this latter precious gift was brought to Milby by Mr. Tryan and Evangelicalism.|$|E

40|$|Jonathan Edwards 2 ̆ 7 {{theology}} {{has been}} portrayed {{in a wide}} variety of ways. Perry Miller described Edwards as a Lockean philosopher who surreptitiously ushered the Enlightenment into Puritan New England. Conrad Cherry pictured him as a theologian under the dominant influence of Calvinism and Puritanism. While agreeing with Cherry, I argue that his representation of Edwards 2 ̆ 7 soteriology fails to emphasize properly a feature that permeated the entire corpus of Edwards 2 ̆ 7 writings [...] namely that salvation is the result of <b>a</b> single <b>divine</b> <b>work</b> of grace. Addressing both the traditional Puritan notion of preparationism and rising Enlightenment empiricism, Edwards spoke of the 2 ̆ 2 graces 2 ̆ 2 of salvation [...] illumination, humiliation, faith, works [...] as concatenated into <b>a</b> single <b>divine</b> <b>work</b> of electing grace. Although the fruits of this grace are logically distinct, they are not separate; the existence of one implies the existence of all others. In this way, for Edwards, salvation is the result of a 2 ̆ 2 one-step 2 ̆ 2 act of divine grace. Edwards distinguished between a natural and a spiritual knowledge of God, the former being that which may be grasped by natural human ability (i. e., sense perception, reasoned reflection), consisting of little more than propositional maxims regarding God 2 ̆ 7 s existence. Spiritual knowledge is communicated to the elect immediately by the illumination of the Holy Spirit, and it consists of an experiential knowledge of God 2 ̆ 7 s benevolence and gloriousness. Spiritual knowledge is characterized by the unwavering presence of faith. Employing a traditional Puritan distinction between 2 ̆ 2 historical faith 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 saving faith, 2 ̆ 2 Edwards unites spiritual knowledge to saving faith, declaring the illumination of the mind to be inseparably joined to an inclination of the heart (i. e., the alteration of the will), by which one is enabled to consent to and trust in the God that is spiritually known. This inward change of one 2 ̆ 7 s nature that enables saving faith is also an abiding principle that yields good works of evangelical obedience. Thus, all facets of salvation [...] from the illumination of divine truth that enables saving faith that yields the fruit of good works [...] are parts of God 2 ̆ 7 s gracious work of salvation, united in a single, illuminating work of the Holy Spirit...|$|R

40|$|Whereas much Western {{theology}} {{tends to}} portray the sacrifice of Christ {{as an act of}} penal substitution, the patristic tradition of the Eastern Orthodox Church emphasizes an understanding of Christ 2 ̆ 7 s atoning work that is participatory rather than substitutionary, ontological rather than juridical, and cosmic rather than individual. These differences in emphasis arise from different understandings of such foundational doctrines as man 2 ̆ 7 s original created nature, the fall, and the Old Testament sacrificial system. Since man was created in a dynamic condition in the image of God, called to attain to the likeness through deification in the energies of God, and as a microcosm whose vocation is to mediate grace to the entire created cosmos as the priest of creation, man 2 ̆ 7 s fall is understood in ontological rather than juridical categories. Death is not imposed upon man by God as a divine punishment; it is the consequence of failure in man 2 ̆ 7 s vocation and parasitically infects the entire creation. The sacrifices described by the Old Testament Law are not prescribed by God for His benefit, but for that of man, signifying the cleansing that will be accomplished by the true Lamb of God and calling man 2 ̆ 7 s mind back to obedience and spiritual worship. As a result, the atonement, <b>a</b> <b>divine</b> <b>work</b> which began with Christ 2 ̆ 7 s incarnation, finds its fulfillment in the sacrifice of His death, not as a surrogate to placate divine wrath, but as a blessed victory that overthrows the domain of death by death, freeing man from bondage to sin and death and removing the barriers which prevented the fulfillment of humanity 2 ̆ 7 s original vocation...|$|E

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis reads Karl Barth’s work {{as being}} {{concerned}} with the healing of the Enlightenment ‘absolute’ subject, manifesting itself both in the individual subject, and politically {{in the formation of}} the modern nation state. The ‘turn to the subject’ is indicative for Barth of the turn to forms of contractual political relation that inevitably absolutise ideological agendas in their failure to be attentive to their own fragility and particularity by virtue of the structuring of power as possession. The dominant reading of Barth at present is concerned to locate him within a Kantian epistemic frame of reference; this thesis challenges this reading by locating him as respondent, from the outset of his Church Dogmatics, to the problem of German Idealism’s framing of subjectivity. Not only this, it sees locating Barth within this Kantian tradition as deeply problematic in the way it structures consciousness prior to the event of revelation. Consequently, Barth’s dislocation of persona in favour of Seinsweise is seen not as a move toward absolutising the subject, but as a generalised way of unsettling the stability of the Idealist subject. In speaking of a singular subject in three ‘modes’ he reframes the relation between known and knower, subject and object. By the grounding revelation in the doctrine of the Trinity, the subject’s knowing is located in <b>a</b> <b>divine</b> <b>work</b> of dispossessive judgement. Reading Barth’s doctrine of reconciliation we can see his intense interest in themes of judgement and dispossession coming to give shape to an account of the subject refigured in the Christ event. Donald MacKinnon’s interrogative Christological reflections serve to illuminate Barth’s critical project by providing conversation within the kenotic traditions. It is as the grammar of God is moved away from an abstract theism toward the concrete particularity of the incarnation that language of both the subject and God are unsettled by Christ’s death and resurrection. MacKinnon provides a window into a reading of kenosis that need not fall into the problems of revisionist readings of Barth’s doctrine of election and its ontological consequence. We find in Barth a form of dispossessive knowing that radically challenges the individuated ‘I’ of the absolute subject by re-ordering speech about God in attention to concrete historicity. Christ cannot be abstracted from his historical particularity, and yet we must find ways of speaking of the communication of the Gestalt of Christ’s life to us. Fyodor Dostoyevsky’s literary art serves to dramatise the ways narrative and history function as the theatre for the formation of the subject in dialogical action. This forms an implicit theology of divine presence in history that embraces the tensive relation between a particular historical locale as the site of divine self-disclosure and the historical as constituted by this event. It is Barth’s construal of the Spirit that is critical for the healing of the absolute subject, for it is the Spirit who drives us back into attention to ethical performance that is responsive to the object of theological inquiry in creative ways. It is in the Spirit that we are dispossessed of our subjectivity as we return again and again to the judgement of God...|$|E
