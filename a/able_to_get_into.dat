5|$|The {{introduction}} of Ryō as a cross-dressing idol has been praised by one reviewer who {{called him the}} cutest out of the three playable idols because of both his appearance and his personality. Miyokawa suggested that Ryō may have been created to lessen any sense of awkwardness that male players would feel from playing as female idols, but upon playing his scenario, Miyokawa noted that the player is naturally <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the story, {{in part due to}} the comical events surrounding Ryō's story that deal with him cross-dressing.|$|E
5|$|When Newark, New Jersey, {{hosted the}} 21st National Sängerfest, held on 1–4 July 1906 in Olympic Park, 25,000 {{people showed up}} to hear the music, many {{arriving}} on chartered trains. Only a few thousand were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the hall, and 2,000 were standing. Five thousand singers {{from more than a}} hundred sängerbunds representing forty cities from New Jersey, New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Delaware competed for a $20,000 prize offered by Kaiser Wilhelm II. Park vendors offered souvenirs, refreshments, games, and a carousel.|$|E
5|$|Many of Khrushchev's {{innovations}} {{were reversed}} after his fall. The requirement that one-third of officials be replaced at each election was overturned, {{as was the}} division in the Party structure between industrial and agricultural sectors. His vocational education program {{for high school students}} was also dropped, and his plan for sending existing agricultural institutions out to the land was ended. However, new agricultural or vocational institutions thereafter were located outside major cities. When new housing was built, much of it was in the form of high rises rather than Khrushchev's low-rise structures, which lacked elevators or balconies. He began to change the economic base of the country, away from heavy industry beginning light, consumer industries. People were required to register to attend, and church-going would bar you from party membership, from promotion, from better housing and your children would not be <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the better schools.|$|E

5|$|Early in {{the second}} quarter, McCarron threw a 67-yard {{touchdown}} pass to DeAndrew White for a 17–14 lead. However, {{this would be the}} last time the Crimson Tide led in the game as a pair of turnovers by the Crimson Tide later in the quarter directly resulted in a pair of Oklahoma touchdowns. After the Sooners tied the game with a 47-yard Michael Hunnicutt field goal, Geneo Grissom recovered a Yeldon fumble at their eight-yard line and returned it to the 34. Seven plays later Knight threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to Saunders for a 24–17 Oklahoma lead. On the next offensive series, McCarron threw his second interception of the game to Zack Sanchez who returned it to the Alabama 13-yard line. On the next play, Sterling Shepard extended the Sooners' lead to 31–17 with his 13-yard touchdown run. The Crimson Tide was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> field goal range late, but Foster missed an attempt from 32-yards as time expired for the first half.|$|E
5|$|Per the {{regulations}} for the 2016 season, two ninety-minute practice and one sixty-minute session were held before qualifying on Saturday. The first two usually {{take place on}} Friday, with Monaco being the single exemption, where those sessions are held on Thursday, in order to minimise road-closure disruptions to local residents. In the first session on Thursday morning, Lewis Hamilton topped the timesheets {{with a time of}} 1:15.537, one tenth of a second faster than his teammate Nico Rosberg. They were followed by Sebastian Vettel, almost half a second down on Hamilton, and the two Red Bull cars of Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen respectively. Daniil Kvyat, driving for Toro Rosso, in sixth was the last driver to get within a second of Hamilton's time. He {{was the only one of}} the front runners to set his time on the supersoft instead of the faster ultrasoft tyres. There were several incidents during the session: After twenty-four minutes, Felipe Massa hit the barrier in turn one, damaging his car and leading to a virtual safety car (VSC) period. Later, Lewis Hamilton had a brake lockup at the same spot, but was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the run-off area without touching the guardrail. Several other drivers had dangerous moments in turn one as well, but the most severe incident of the session came three minutes to the end: A drain cover had come loose around the first corner, puncturing Rosberg's left rear tyre and damaging Jenson Button's McLaren MP4-31, causing the practice to be red flagged, ultimately ending the session.|$|E

From that lead off the start line, Oracle led the whole race to win race twelve by 31 seconds on the line. During the upwind leg, Oracle's performance was excellent, which including getting up on the foils at speeds approaching 32 knots. Oracle gained their second point to take the score to 2–8.|$|E
25|$|The battle {{began with}} the Americans repulsing the British land attack on 14 September. Nicolls, ill at the time, was observing on Hermes. On 15 September, after {{contrary}} winds had died down, Percy crossed the bar with Hermes, Sophie, Carron, and Childers. The fort opened fire at 3:20p.m. and at 3:30 Hermes opened fire. The U.S. fort and Hermes were at musket-shot range. At 3:40, Sophie opened fire also, but the other two vessels were not <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> a firing position. During the battle, a wooden splinter wounded Nicolls in the eye.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Albert (1–13 July 1916) was {{the opening}} {{battle of the}} Somme offensive, and in the Albert–Bapaume road sector 34th Division {{attacked}} towards the village of La Boiselle.

Congestion caused by the withdrawal of 34th Division delayed 19th Division's deployment, and on 2 July only its 58th Brigade was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> action, capturing the western half of the village at 21:00.|$|E

25|$|Crossing the Rapidan River on May 4, 1864, Grant {{sought to}} defeat Lee's army by quickly placing his forces between Lee and Richmond and {{inviting}} an open battle. Lee surprised Grant by attacking the larger Union army aggressively in the Battle of the Wilderness (May 5–7), resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. Unlike his predecessors in the Eastern Theater, however, Grant did not withdraw his army following this setback, but instead maneuvered to the southeast, resuming {{his attempt to}} interpose his forces between Lee and Richmond. Lee's army was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> position to block this movement. At the Battle of Spotsylvania Court House (May 8–21), Grant repeatedly attacked segments of the Confederate defensive line, hoping for a breakthrough, but the only results were again heavy losses for both sides.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} series, Baldrick's {{attempts}} {{to raise his}} social status bring much lower results due to his much smaller intelligence. His most visible attempt is in the first episode, where he tries to marry Lord Edmund Blackadder as his bridesmaid (after Kate eloped). Fortunately, Baldrick still has enough intelligence left to admire Blackadder and clearly has desire to please him. Unfortunately, Edmund despises him and even fires him once. This great obstacle was removed {{for a short period}} of time when Edmund was kidnapped by Prince Ludwig the Indestructible along with Lord Melchett, thus Baldrick was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the royal court by becoming the Queen's personal pet. A few hours later he was murdered by Prince Ludwig along with Blackadder, Melchett, Queenie, Nursie, and Lord Percy.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the guards}} were <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the cells, they {{stripped}} the inmates naked, tore apart the beds and the cell, {{and put the}} prisoners who had started the rebellion in solitary confinement. As all nine guards could not be on duty at once, they began rewarding the prisoners for good behavior. The prisoners {{who had not been}} involved in starting the riot were allowed to lie in their beds, wash themselves and brush their teeth and eat while those who had started the riot were not allowed to. The guards continued to use tormenting tactics to divide the prisoners and forestall further organized resistance. In the case of one prisoner, who was a smoker, the guards were able to control his behavior because they decided when and if he was allowed to smoke.|$|E

25|$|Carey's Squadron Leader {{had ordered}} him to cover the {{squadron}} with just three other pilots. A large number of escorting Bf 109s engaged his three-man section. Carey was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> firing positions several times before a Bf 110 hit him with cannon fire. The round hit the port wing and exploded the ammunition stored there, causing a large hole. The Hurricane turned onto its back and Carey noticed blood seeping from his hands and arm. He corrected {{the attitude of the}} aircraft and succeeded in attacking a flight of Bf 109s from astern and hit one but was again attacked and hit by a Bf 110 which shot off his rudder and one elevator. The fight had taken him near to Cherbourg and he decided to extract himself and fly to Tangmere. The Hurricane, P3202, was later repaired. 43 Squadron's tormentors in the battle were probably from V./LG 1.|$|E
25|$|Nimrod sailed from Cork on 13 January 1828 for the Clyde. A gale {{developed}} during the night that damaged her and caused her to take on water. As she approached Anglesey Sparshott decided to take refuge at Holyhead. She was <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> the harbour and anchor. The wind changed direction and she lost her anchor and the wind and sea drove her onto a ridge of rocks. By midnight of 14 January it became possible to get a line to shore and get the crew off her. Over {{the next few days}} her stores were landed and on 12 February the steamer Harlequin was able to pull her off the rocks. The Navy judged her not worth repairing. She was sold to Rowland Robert & Co. on 22 February for £510. The subsequent court martial acquitted Sparshott, his officers, and men of her loss.|$|E
25|$|Up until 1918, Lalonde cleverly used a {{specific}} rule of hockey – which stipulated that goaltenders could not drop {{to their knees}} to block shots – to compliment his superb accuracy. Coming off the right wing or down the centre, he would unleash a “wicked knee-high shot” which would catch the opposing goalie between the glove – or stick – and pad. This shot placement was deliberately done in order to slow down a goalie’s reaction time; they were often unable to decide between using their glove hand or blocker hand to deflect or catch the puck, and shuffling to {{one side or the}} other to use their pads. Lalonde’s snapper was so lethal that opposing coaches would often assign three to four of their own players just to shadow him, and – in one of the earliest iterations of the trap – attempt to pin him into a corner in order to prevent his being <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>into</b> a scoring position.|$|E
