40|$|Introduction Since 2005, we produce, at {{academic}} {{scale in}} Orleans, 211 At for needs of chemistry and physicians teams of Nantes in research project of <b>alpha</b> <b>immunotherapy.</b> Between 2005 and 2014, several modifications were {{been made on}} preparation of target, targetry and radiation to protect personnel. Material and Methods The first target was a molten Bi metal onto a Cu support pre-treated with acid attack. The wished thickness (up to 100 µm) was obtained by mechanical treatment of target. The target is irradiated at 32 MeV alpha particle beam for around 2 hours and then delivered by road transport to users. Only a measure of radiation dose was made to evaluate target activity. The second target we have used since 2010 is a electrodeposition of Bi (thickness of around 30 µm) onto AlN backing. We used a beam of 30. 5 MeV for reaction 207 Bi(α,n) 211 At (2 h with a current intensity of 2 µA). Activity has measured with a detector Ge at 687 keV (γ-branching fraction = 0. 26 %) before to be delivered. For all targets, beam energy on target was around 28. 7 Mev {{in order not to}} produce too much 210 At. Results and Conclusion 138 productions with the first target were delivered with an estimated activity of less than 100 MBq. Difficulties with wet extraction 1, low yield of radiolabelling (metallic impurities and activation of copper resulting in 66 Ga and 67 Ga) made necessary to change process of extraction. With support of AlN, dry extraction was used with good yield (75 – 80 %) and without activation of support. Until today, 46 batchs were delivered with activity of 44 ± 12 MBq/µAh. Yield activity of 211 At has been almost doubled compared to first target (25 MBq/µAh). The dose burden to personnel was decreased with modification of targetry (outside of blockhouse of cyclotron, in a specific line beam to radionuclide production, cf. FIG. 1). In the case of 211 At production, energy of reaction is of major impact. With our versatile accelerator (range of energy in alpha between 10 and 50 MeV) and a low thickness of metal, it’s easy to reach the right energy. This radionuclide production will be continued until ARRONAX, Nantes cyclotron, could take over from us for bigger activity of 211 At...|$|E
40|$|The {{science of}} cancer {{research}} is currently expanding {{its use of}} alpha particle emitting radioisotopes. Coupled with the discovery and proliferation of molecular species that seek out and attach to tumors, new therapy and diagnostics are being developed to enhance the treatment of cancer and other diseases. This latest technology is {{commonly referred to as}} <b>Alpha</b> <b>Immunotherapy</b> (AIT). Actinium- 225 /Bismuth- 213 is a parent/daughter alpha-emitting radioisotope pair that is highly sought after because of the potential for treating numerous diseases and its ability to be chemically compatible with many known and widely used carrier molecules (such as monoclonal antibodies and proteins/peptides). Unfortunately, the worldwide supply of actinium- 225 is limited to about 1, 000 mCi annually and most of that is currently spoken for, thus limiting the ability of this radioisotope pair to enter into research and subsequently clinical trials. The route proposed herein utilizes high energy protons to produce actinium- 225 via spallation of a thorium- 232 target. As part of previous R and D efforts carried out at Argonne National Laboratory recently in support of the proposed US FRIB facility, it was shown that a very effective production mechanism for actinium- 225 is spallation of thorium- 232 by high energy proton beams. The base-line simulation for the production rate of actinium- 225 by this reaction mechanism is 8 E 12 atoms per second at 200 MeV proton beam energy with 50 g/cm 2 thorium target and 100 kW beam power. An irradiation of one actinium- 225 half-life (10 days) produces {approx} 100 Ci of actinium- 225. For a given beam current the reaction cross section increases slightly with energy to about 400 MeV and then decreases slightly for beam energies in the several GeV regime. The object of this effort is to refine the simulations at proton beam energies of 400 MeV and above up to about 8 GeV. Once completed, the simulations will be experimentally verified using 400 MeV and 8 GeV protons available at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory. Targets will be processed at Argonne National Laboratory to separate and purify the actinium- 225 that will subsequently be transferred to NorthStar laboratory facilities for product quality testing and comparison to the product quality of ORNL produced actinium- 225, which is currently the industry standard. The test irradiations at FNAL will produce 1 - 20 mCi per day which is more than sufficient for quantitative evaluation of the proposed production process. The beneficial outcome of this effort will be a new production route for actinium- 225 that does not use or require any uranium- 233 materials owned by DOE or use any radium- 226 as an irradiation target but can supply the medical community's needs for actinium- 225 now and in the future...|$|E
