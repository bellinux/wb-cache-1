5|$|From 1969 to 1972, NASA {{visited the}} real Moon through the Apollo program {{and found that}} its surface does not closely {{resemble}} this part of Idaho. NASA astronauts discovered that real Moon craters were almost all created by meteorites while their namesakes on Earth were created by volcanic eruptions. Apollo astronauts performed part of their training at Craters of the Moon Lava Field by learning to look for and collect good rock specimens in <b>an</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> and harsh environment.|$|E
5|$|Robben did {{not make}} his {{competitive}} debut for Chelsea until November 2004, as he was injured in a pre-season friendly match against Roma, breaking a metatarsal bone in his right foot in a challenge from Olivier Dacourt. During this time, he told club doctors that he had noticed <b>an</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> growth {{on one of his}} testicles. The medical team quickly did tests to check for testicular cancer, but he was subsequently given the all clear.|$|E

5|$|The inaccessibility of many tern colonies {{gave them}} a measure of {{protection}} from mammalian predators, especially on islands, but introduced species brought by humans can seriously affect breeding birds. These can be predators such as foxes, raccoons, cats and rats, or animals that destroy the habitat, including rabbits, goats and pigs. Problems arise not only on formerly mammal-free islands, as in New Zealand, but also where an alien carnivore, such as the American mink in Scotland, presents <b>an</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> threat.|$|E

5|$|Lawless was sidelined with a groin injury at the {{beginning}} of the 2013–14 season, and did not make his first start until 17 September in a 3–0 victory against Dartford, in which he scored one goal and set up another. This victory provided the springboard for Luton to embark on a 27-game unbeaten run in the league, in which Lawless was heavily involved, scoring five further times and contributing 10 assists. After playing in 32 games and scoring six goals, including many games in <b>an</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> position as a left midfielder, he missed the final part of the season due to injury. On 15 April 2014, with three games to spare, Luton won the Conference Premier title and were promoted to League Two; this was Lawless' first title and promotion as a player.|$|E

5|$|Starting all {{but four}} of Manchester City's matches in the 1925–26 season, Cowan {{was a key}} part of the team which reached the 1926 FA Cup Final, winning several ties by wide margins en route. However, in the final City were beaten 1–0 by Bolton Wanderers. Further {{disappointment}} followed in the league, when after a campaign characterised by erratic form, City were relegated on the final day of the season. By this time Cowan's reputation as a competent centre-back had grown, and he received an international call-up. He made his England debut on 24 May 1926 playing <b>an</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> left-half role in a 5–3 win against Belgium. By 1931, he had earned three international caps, the others gained in matches against France and Austria. He also made appearances for the Football League team, including a trial match against England in 1931.|$|E

5|$|After {{they drive}} {{together}} and work naturally as a team, Speed begins {{to suspect that}} Racer X is actually his brother Rex in disguise. His family discovers that he has entered the race and agree to support him. With {{the help of his}} family and Trixie, Speed defeats many brutal racers who have been bribed by fixer Cruncher Block to stop him, and overcomes seemingly insurmountable obstacles to win the race. However, Taejo's arrangement is revealed to be a sham, as he was only interested in increasing the value of his family's company so that they could profit from Royalton's buyout. An angry Speed hits the track that he used to drive with his brother, and confronts Racer X with his suspicion that he is Rex. Racer X removes his mask, revealing <b>an</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> face, and tells Speed that Rex is indeed dead. Speed returns home, where Taejo's sister Horuko Togokahn gives him Taejo's automatic invitation to the Grand Prix, which Taejo had rejected. The Racer family bands together and builds the new Mach 6 in 32 hours.|$|E
5|$|Comminges {{had played}} youth {{football}} {{in his native}} Guadeloupe for local side Rapid Club Petit-Canal before moving to France in 1997. After a successful spell on trial, he joined the youth academy at Amiens SC {{at the age of}} 15, breaking into the first-team in 2002. Although naturally right-footed, Comminges' first experience in the Amiens first-team came as a left sided player as manager Denis Troch was forced to utilise him in <b>an</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> position following an injury crisis at the club. During the 2002–03 season, he made 14 league appearances as Amiens finished in a mid-table position, despite only being on an amateur contract at the club. He left the club in May 2003, and joined Stade Reims of Championnat National, the third division of the French football league system, on a free transfer. In his first season with the club, he helped the side earn promotion to Ligue 2, with Reims finishing the season as champions. During his four years with the club, Comminges made 74 league appearances, with Reims establishing themselves in the second tier of French football.|$|E
5|$|Gamal Abdel Nasser {{wrote in}} his memoirs that already by May 25, the Egyptian forces were spread so thin {{that they had no}} mobile {{reserves}} to assault a Jewish force, and considered it strange that they would be ordered to allocate a major contingent to fight in <b>an</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> area. Following-up his victory in the Battle of Yad Mordechai on May 23–24, al-Mwawi pushed north along the coast, bypassing the relatively well-defended Israeli village of Nitzanim. His column was reinforced by sea near Majdal, where he sent part of his force to the Majdal–Hebron road, hoping it would be able to link with another column, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Abd el-Aziz, south of Jerusalem. Reduced to about 2,500 men, al-Mwawi resumed his march northwards. Brigadier General Muhammad Naguib was put in charge of the column by al-Mwawi, because the original commander was on vacation in Egypt.|$|E

5|$|Haber has {{represented}} Canada from the U15 {{through to the}} U23 Olympic levels. He appeared in all three games in the 2007 FIFA U20 World Cup, although he was played in <b>an</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> role as a centre-back. In March 2008, Haber made three Olympic qualification appearances in Canada's unsuccessful campaign to reach the 2008 Men's Olympic Football Tournament in Beijing. He {{was a member of}} Canada's U20 squad that did not qualify for the 2009 FIFA U20 World Cup in Egypt, finishing third in their group. As a result, Canada did not qualify for the Championship round. In March 2012, Haber was once again part of the U23 squad that would attempt to qualify for the Summer Olympics later that year. Canada qualified from the group stage, finishing in second place with five points, qualifying {{at the expense of the}} USA U23 side after securing a surprise 2–0 victory over them. Haber played in two out of the three group matches. They lost in the semi-final stage to the eventual gold medal side, going down 3–1 to their Mexican counterparts, with Haber scoring Canada's solitary goal to briefly restore parity in the match.|$|E
5|$|Teena Mulder (Rebecca Toolan) and The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) visit Mulder, who is paralyzed in a hospital. After {{administering}} a {{drug that}} cures his paralysis, The Smoking Man reveals himself to be Mulder's father and takes him from the hospital. Meanwhile, Kritschgau visits Scully and claims that Mulder's contact with the shard of an alien spaceship has reawakened the extraterrestrial black oil with which he was infected three years previously; because he is infected with the virus, Mulder is proof of alien life. Skinner, who has been looking for Mulder, tells Scully that Mulder's mother signed {{him out of the}} hospital. The Smoking Man takes Mulder to <b>an</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> neighborhood; inside a new home, he finds his former informant Deep Throat (Jerry Hardin). Deep Throat claims to have faked his own death to escape the burden he was under by being a part of the Syndicate, and he suggests that Mulder can now do the same. Mulder meets Fowley, and the two become intimate.|$|E
5|$|Waddington first {{played for}} Yorkshire after the First World War, {{when the team}} had been {{weakened}} by injuries and retirements. He made an immediate impression in 1919, his first season; he took 100 wickets and was largely responsible for Yorkshire's victory in the County Championship that year. After a similarly successful season in 1920, he was selected for the 1920–21 Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour of Australia, during which he appeared {{in two of the}} five Tests. However, the England team were outclassed; used in <b>an</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> tactical role, Waddington took just one wicket and never played for England again. He continued to be effective for Yorkshire, particularly against the weaker counties, but was often inconsistent. His reputation as an uncompromising opponent was cemented when he was found guilty of dissent and inciting the crowd in a game against Middlesex. A succession of injuries reduced his effectiveness and he retired from first-class cricket in 1927. He continued to play league cricket and worked for the family business, a fat-refining firm, but maintained his connection with Yorkshire cricket.|$|E

5|$|Western jackdaws are voluble birds. The main call, {{frequently}} {{given in}} flight, is a metallic and squeaky chyak-chyak or kak-kak. This is a contact or greeting call. A feeding call made by adults to call young, or males when offering food to their mates, has been transcribed as kiaw or kyow. Females in return give a more drawn out version when begging for food from males, written as kyaay, tchaayk or giaaaa. Perched birds often chatter together, and before settling for the night, large roosting flocks make a cackling noise. Western jackdaws {{also have a}} hoarse, drawn-out alarm call, arrrrr or kaaaarr, used when warning of predators or when mobbing them. Nestlings begin making a soft cheep at about a week of age. As they grow, their voice becomes louder until their call is a penetrating screech around day 18. After this, the voice deepens and softens. From day 25, the young cease calling and become silent if they hear <b>an</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> noise. The European jackdaw can be trained to imitate human speech.|$|E
5|$|As a {{descriptive}} {{model of the}} two levels, Hare posited two extreme cases of people, one of whom would only use critical moral thinking and the other of whom would only use intuitive moral thinking. The former he called the 'archangel' and the latter the 'prole'. It {{is worth noting that}} it is not Hare's intention to divide up the entire human race into either archangels or proles; according to his theory each person shares the traits of both to limited and varying extents at different times. The archangel has superhuman powers of thought, superhuman knowledge and no weaknesses. This unbiased 'ideal observer', when presented with <b>an</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> situation, would be able to immediately scan all potential consequences of all possible actions in order to frame a universal principle from which he/she could decide an appropriate action for the situation. Such a person would not need a set of intuitive moral rules, as he/she would be able to decide the correct response to any possible situation by reason alone. By contrast, the prole has these human weaknesses to an extreme degree. He/she must rely upon intuitions and sound prima facie principles all of the time, as he is incapable of critical thought. The set of intuitive moral rules that the prole follows must be simple and general enough that they can be easily understood and memorised, and also quick and easy to use.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, {{he moved}} to Second Division Grimsby Town. Though now playing in the {{professional}} Football League, Chapman was still an amateur at this stage and obtained {{a job with a}} firm of local solicitors to earn his way. Grimsby started the season poorly – they were {{near the bottom of the}} division by Christmas and were beaten 7–0 by Preston North End in the FA Cup, but rallied to finish tenth at the end of the 1898–99 season. By this time Chapman had been dropped from the team, having been unsuccessfully moved to centre forward, <b>an</b> <b>unfamiliar</b> position for him. He was released by Grimsby and drifted down into non-league football with a brief spell at Swindon Town, playing three games and scoring twice, but had to leave the club as he was unable to find a job in the area. He moved on to see out the season with Sheppey United, who finished bottom of the Southern League in 1899–1900. Chapman finished as United's top scorer but was injured at the end of this season, and still unable to find a job. Disheartened, he returned to his home town and turned out for Worksop Town of the Midland League in 1900–01, while resuming his studies, this time at Old Firth College in Sheffield.|$|E
