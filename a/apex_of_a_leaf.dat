Keystones are often placed in {{the centre of the}} flat top of openings such as doors and windows, essentially for decorative effect.|$|R
40|$|Since <b>a</b> <b>leaf</b> has <b>a</b> certain thickness, each {{mesophyll}} {{layer in}} it absorbs different light energy. In this paper, by using parameters related {{with the light}} transmission and reflection <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>leaf,</b> the equation describing the absorption of light in each layer <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>leaf</b> was proposed. Spectral distribution of tobacco, soybean, corn and rice plant leaves with different chlorophyll content were measured by a spectra-photometer equipped with spherical ball and opal glass. Attenuation coefficients of visible light to chlorophyll content <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>leaf</b> on dicotyledonous plants (tobacco and soybean) were larger than that of monocotyledonous plants (corn and rice).
