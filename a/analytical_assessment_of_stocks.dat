40|$|The Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) {{mandates}} that European Union (EU) member states achieve Good Environmental Status (GEnS) {{based on an}} ecosystem-based approach to management. For commercial fisheries, the primary target under the MSFD is one of maximum sustainable yield. Of Black Sea riparian nations, only Romania and Bulgaria are EU member states. Focusing at the supranational level, we review institutions and instruments relevant to management of the Black Sea. The economic values of current fish catches are assessed, and the results <b>of</b> a recent <b>analytical</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> fish <b>stocks</b> are used to estimate potential future values based on maximum sustainable yields. In the Black Sea region, despite long-standing attempts to improve fisheries management, there remains a lack of effective regional cooperation. Evidence from the scenario analysis suggests that achieving GEnS would not have an undue negative impact on overall fishery sector incomes, and could, with appropriate investments in processing and marketing, deliver increased economic benefits for Black Sea countries. The ongoing policy debate between and within Black Sea coastal states needs to be extended to include recognition of the potential economic and social benefits of effective fisheries management. More work is required to assess returns on investment in interim management measures to deliver GEnS...|$|R

The {{terms of}} reference for the Working group were: To carry out <b>assessments</b> <b>of</b> the <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> Pandalus in Skagerrak and the Norwegian Deeps (IIIa and Iva East) and the stock in the Barents Sea and Svalbard area (I and II) and to provide advice (catch options) for these stocks in 2006, see Section 1. This year’s meeting was organised as a joint meeting between WGPAND and NAFO STACFIS annual shrimp meeting with common participation in all sessions by both WGPAND and STACFIS members. THE PANDALUS STOCKS INCLUDED IN WGPAND. The WG deals with the Pandalus stock in the Barents Sea and two Pandalus stocks in the North Sea area: The stock in the Skagerrak and Norwegian Deep and the stock in the Fladen Ground, see Section 3.

40|$|A new {{modeling}} and experimentation methodology for assessing fragmentation characteristics of blast-enhanced explosive fragmentation munitions had been developed. Fragmentation performance of two high explosive compositions had been {{examined in this}} work: a baseline, PBXN- 9 (92 % HMX, 6 % Dioctyl adipate, 2 % Hycar 4454) explosive, and an aluminized blast-enhanced PAX-Al composition. The experimental <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the fragmentation performance of tested charges was accomplished using the fragmentation arena tests, the sawdust fragment recovery experimentation, and the flash-screen fragment velocity tests. The <b>analytical</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the thermodynamic parameters of the PBXN- 9 and the PAX-Al compositions was performed employing the JAGUAR code. The <b>analytical</b> <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> the fragmentation parameters of the explosive fragmentation charges was performed employing the PAFRAG (Picatinny Arsenal Fragmentation) modeling methodology linking the three-dimensional axial symmetric high-strain high-strain-rate hydrocode analyses with a phenomenological fragmentation model based on the Mott’s theory of break-up of ideal cylindrical “ring-bombs”.

40|$|Stock–recruit {{relationships}} that use spawning stock biomass (SSB) to represent reproductive potential {{assume that the}} proportion of SSB composed of females and the relative fecundity (number of eggs produced per unit mass) are both constant over time. To test these two assumptions, female-only spawner biomass (FSB) and total egg production (TEP) were estimated for the Northeast Arctic <b>stock</b> <b>of</b> Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) over a 56 -year time period. The proportion of females (FSB/SSB) varied between 24 % and 68 %, and the variation was systematic with length such that SSB became more female-biased as the mean length of spawners increased. Relative fecundity <b>of</b> the <b>stock</b> (TEP/SSB) varied between 115 and 355 eggs·g– 1 and was significantly, positively correlated with mean length of spawners. Both FSB and TEP gave a different interpretation of the recruitment response to reductions in stock size (overcompensatory) compared with that obtained using SSB (either compensatory or depensatory). There was no difference between SSB and FSB in the <b>assessment</b> <b>of</b> <b>stock</b> status; however, in recent years (1980 – 2001) TEP fell below the threshold level at which recruitment becomes impaired more frequently than did SSB.
