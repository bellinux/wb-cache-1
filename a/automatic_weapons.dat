5|$|Lance Corporal Jose Francisco Jimenez (1946–1969) was {{assigned}} to Company K, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines, 1st Marine Division. On August 28, 1969, his unit came under heavy attack by North Vietnamese Army soldiers concealed in well-camouflaged emplacements at Quang Nam Province. Jimenez personally destroyed several enemy personnel and silenced an antiaircraft weapon. He then maneuvered to within ten feet of hostile soldiers who were firing <b>automatic</b> <b>weapons</b> from a trench and, {{in the face of}} vicious enemy fire, destroyed the position. As he moved to attack another enemy soldier, he was mortally wounded.|$|E
5|$|On 15 June 1952, Overton led {{a bombing}} raid over Pyongyang {{to destroy a}} series of targets near the Pyongyang Air Base. The targets had been un{{successful}}ly bombed earlier by a similar strike force, but Overton's group was successful in destroying {{almost all of the}} targets while none of his aircraft took major damage from the 48 antiaircraft and 100 <b>automatic</b> <b>weapons,</b> and without harming the many nearby UN prisoner of war concentrations.|$|E
5|$|All {{four main}} Einsatzgruppen {{took part in}} mass shootings {{from the early days}} of the war. Initially the targets were adult Jewish men, but by August the net had been widened to include women, children, and the elderly—the entire Jewish population. Initially there was a semblance of {{legality}} given to the shootings, with trumped-up charges being read out (arson, sabotage, black marketeering, or refusal to work, for example) and victims being killed by a firing squad. As this method proved too slow, the Einsatzkommandos began to take their victims out in larger groups and shot them next to, or even inside, mass graves that had been prepared. Some Einsatzkommandos started to use <b>automatic</b> <b>weapons,</b> with survivors being killed with a pistol shot.|$|E

5|$|In the stalemate, the Belgians {{studied the}} Italians' tactics; they would post pairs of snipers and {{artillery}} spotters in trees guarded at the bases by infantry squads. Their artillery barrages were usually avoided by Belgian patrols, though they would continue {{up to an}} hour after they withdrew. On 21 April, the Italians launched a large counterattack. After a two-hour bombardment, Eritrean troops armed with <b>automatic</b> <b>weapons</b> and hand grenades and covered by Galla snipers penetrated the Belgians' left and right flanks. With Van der Meerch's battalion suffering the brunt of the assault, the Belgians retreated behind a pair of hills that obscured them from Italian observers, which the latter then seized.|$|E
5|$|Jonas Skarssen, the {{chairman}} of the IBBC, reveals to his senior men White and Wexler that the bank had Calvini killed so that they could deal with his sons to buy missile guidance systems in which the bank has invested. Since the bank knows that Salinger and Whitman are close to finding their assassin, they send a hit team to kill him at a meeting between him and his handler, Wexler. Wexler leaves and is arrested by Ornelas. As Salinger speaks to the assassin, a spectacular gunfight at the Guggenheim erupts when a number of gunmen attempt to kill them with <b>automatic</b> <b>weapons.</b> They escape, but the assassin is mortally wounded.|$|E
5|$|On 6 August 1950, as the Battle of Pusan Perimeter was beginning, the 25th Infantry Division {{was engaged}} in a counteroffensive near Masan, during the Battle of Masan. That night, M Company was {{supporting}} the division's advance {{near the city of}} Haman, South Korea, in a mountain valley south of Sobuk-san. As Thompson's platoon approached the town, it was ambushed by a large force of North Korean People's Army troops. <b>Automatic</b> <b>weapons</b> fire caused several men in the company to panic and flee. Those remaining were ordered into a tight perimeter by Second Lieutenant Herbert H. Wilson.|$|E

5|$|On {{the evening}} of September 9, Church formed Task Force Davidson to {{eliminate}} this threat to Yonil. The airfield itself had not been used {{since the middle of}} August except for emergency landing and refueling of planes, but evacuation of US Air Force equipment, bombs, and petroleum products was still in progress. Davidson commanded the task force, which was composed of the US 19th Infantry, less the 3rd Battalion, the 3rd Battalion of the 9th Infantry, the 13th Field Artillery Battalion, C Battery of the 15th Field Artillery Battalion, A Company of the 3rd Engineer Combat Battalion, the 9th Infantry Regimental Tank Company, two batteries of antiaircraft <b>automatic</b> <b>weapons,</b> and other miscellaneous units.|$|E
5|$|One monk {{was thrown}} from a balcony {{down to the}} {{courtyard}} six meters below. Nhu's men vandalized the main altar and confiscated the intact charred heart of Thích Quảng Đức, which had failed to burn during his re-cremation. However, some of the Buddhists were able to flee the pagoda with a receptacle containing his ashes. Two monks jumped {{the back wall of}} Xá Lợi to enter the grounds of the adjoining United States Agency for International Development (USAID) mission, where they were given asylum, despite the presence of troops behind the pagoda walls who opened fire with <b>automatic</b> <b>weapons</b> on any monks who tried to flee by jumping the fence.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{enlisted in}} the army in October 1945, and after basic combat {{training}} was assigned to a post in Adak, Alaska. After 18 months, he was honorably discharged from the military, but found adjustment to civilian life difficult and opted {{to return to the}} military. In January 1948, Thompson reenlisted and was assigned to the U.S. 6th Infantry Division, which was on occupation duty in South Korea. When the 6th Infantry Division returned to the United States, he was reassigned to the U.S. 24th Infantry Regiment, U.S. 25th Infantry Division which was assigned to the post-World War II occupation of Japan. His Military Occupational Specialty was 4812, that of a heavy weapons infantryman who operated <b>automatic</b> <b>weapons.</b>|$|E

5|$|A {{variety of}} weapons are {{available}} including handguns, <b>automatic</b> <b>weapons</b> and shotguns, with various ammunition types also in existence. Ammunition {{is limited in}} the game and weapons must be reloaded, although additional ammunition can be collected. Players can also call out to enemies who will sometimes surrender and can then be captured (put in handcuffs) with their ammunition also collected. There are also civilians in the game who can also be called out to and then rescued by the player. Health bars for enemies, vehicles or friendly subjects that must be protected are also sometimes shown. There are health packs which can be picked up, as well as health stations mounted on walls which can be used. Body armor is also sometimes provided or found in levels. A small heads-up-display features a radar/map with an arrow showing the character's direction, red dots for enemies, green dots for civilians, and yellow stars for objectives. The direction and field of vision of enemies is shown on the radar.|$|E
5|$|Following the raids, {{tensions}} {{were high}} {{in the streets of}} the cities. Police were ordered to shoot those who defied the 21:00 to 05:00 curfew, and troops in full camouflage battle dress guarded every major intersection and bridge with <b>automatic</b> <b>weapons</b> bearing fixed bayonets. The empty pagodas were ringed by troops and armored cars. All outgoing news was censored, forcing reporters to smuggle their copy out with travelers flying to foreign countries. The telephone lines in the homes and offices of all U.S. military and embassy staff were disconnected. The head of the USAID mission, Joe Brant, was stopped and searched while commuting to work, and other American officials had their meetings with Vietnamese officials and applications for permits to travel after the curfew hours delayed. The 14,000 U.S. military advisers in the country were given orders to stay in their homes, and all leave was canceled.|$|E
5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} the end of the war, Cilicia had also become a source of dispute between the British and French, who both aspired to establish influence in the region. The British government, however, was under strong domestic pressure to withdraw and demobilize its forces in the Middle East and on 15 September 1919, Prime Minister David Lloyd George begrudgingly accepted a proposal by Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau to have the French formally assume control of Cilicia. The transfer of command took place on 4 November, but Field Marshal Ferdinand Foch's promise to reinforce the existing forces in the area with at least 32 infantry battalions, 20 cavalry squadrons and 14 artillery batteries went unfulfilled. The French units were thus deprived of armored cars and air support and lacked <b>automatic</b> <b>weapons,</b> heavy artillery and even wireless transmitters and carrier pigeons.|$|E

5|$|Moving {{by itself}} and {{completely}} {{cut off from}} all other units, G Company, numbering only about 80 men, was hardest hit. At 08:00, nearing the top of Hill 464, it surprised and killed three North Korean soldiers. Soon after, North Korean <b>automatic</b> <b>weapons</b> and small arms fire struck the company. All day G Company maneuvered around the hill but never gained its crest. At mid-afternoon it received radio orders to withdraw that night. The company left six dead on the hill and, carrying its wounded on improvised litters of ponchos and tree branches, it started down the shale slopes of the mountain in rain and darkness. Halfway down, friendly fire injured Captain Herman L. West, the G Company commander. The company scattered but West reassembled it. Cautioning his men to move quietly and not to fire their weapons, West led his men to the eastern base of Hill 464 where he went into a defensive position {{for the rest of}} the night.|$|E
5|$|On 14 June 1952, Bleak {{was part}} of a patrol of the 2nd Battalion, 223rd Infantry, sent north to probe Chinese forward {{positions}} and attempt to obtain Chinese prisoners of war for interrogation. Bleak volunteered to accompany the 20-man patrol of an I Platoon on this mission, which was to send them to a sparsely vegetated feature called Hill 499, where Chinese forces were known to be operating. The patrol left United Nations lines at 04:30 Korea Standard Time on 14 June, under cover of darkness. It was preceded by an attack by F Company, 223rd Infantry, to the west which was intended to distract Chinese forces. However, as the patrol ascended the hill, it came under heavy Chinese <b>automatic</b> <b>weapons</b> fire which struck the lead elements, injuring several soldiers. Bleak, {{at the rear of the}} formation, rushed forward and treated and stabilized several soldiers hit in the initial volley, then followed the remainder of the patrol as it continued its mission.|$|E
5|$|On July 9, the US 2nd Infantry Division, {{with several}} armor and antiaircraft {{artillery}} units, {{was ordered to}} proceed to the Far East. The next day, MacArthur requested that the 2nd Division be brought to full war strength, if possible, without delaying its departure. He also reiterated his need of the units required to bring the four infantry divisions already in the Far East to full war strength. He detailed these as four heavy tank battalions, 12 heavy tank companies, 11 infantry battalions, 11 field artillery battalions, and four antiaircraft <b>automatic</b> <b>weapons</b> battalions per division. By August 7, the US 9th Infantry Regiment was operational in Korea, and {{had been sent to}} the Naktong Bulge area. However it {{would be the end of}} the month before the rest of the 2nd Infantry Division arrived in Korea.|$|E

The sling was from the BAR. Like the M14, it was chambered for 7.62×51mm NATO.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the first}} Gatling gun {{was capable of}} firing continuously, it {{required}} a person to crank it; therefore {{it was not a}} true <b>automatic</b> <b>weapon.</b> The Maxim gun, invented and patented in 1883, was the first true fully <b>automatic</b> <b>weapon,</b> making use of the fired projectile's recoil force to reload the weapon. Nonetheless, the Gatling gun represented a huge leap in firearm technology.|$|R

5|$|Squads of Special Forces {{and combat}} police {{flattened}} the gates and smashed {{their way into}} the pagoda at around 00:20 on 21 August as Xá Lợi's brass gong was struck to signal the attack. Nhu's men were armed with pistols, submachine guns, carbines, shotguns, grenades and tear gas. The red-bereted Special Forces were joined by truckloads of steel-helmeted combat police in army camouflage uniforms. Two of Nhu's senior aides were seen outside Xá Lợi directing the operation, while Nhu and his wife, Madame Nhu, watched the action from a nearby tank. Monks and nuns who barricaded themselves behind wooden shields were attacked with rifle butts and bayonets. The sound of the pagoda's gong was largely masked by that of <b>automatic</b> <b>weapons</b> fire, exploding grenades, battering rams, shattering glass and human screaming. The military personnel shouted as they attacked, as did the occupants, in fear.|$|E
5|$|The police's {{operating}} procedure—and the {{law which}} governed their actions—meant {{they were unable}} to open fire without being fired upon first. This, along with the structure of the building, which had a narrow, winding stairwell up which police would have to pass, meant any approach to the gang members was too perilous to attempt. It was decided to wait until dawn before taking any action. At about 7:30am a policeman knocked on the door of number 100, which elicited no response; stones were then thrown at the window to wake the men. Svaars and Sokoloff appeared at the window and opened fire at the police. A police sergeant was wounded in the chest: he was evacuated under fire across the rooftops, and taken to the London Hospital. Some members of the police returned fire, but their guns were only effective over shorter ranges, and proved ineffective against the comparatively advanced <b>automatic</b> <b>weapons</b> of Svaars and Sokoloff.|$|E
5|$|Mumbai was lashed by torrential rains on 26–27 July 2005, {{during which}} the city was brought to a {{complete}} standstill. The city received 37inches (940 millimeters) of rain in 24 hours— the most any Indian city has ever received in a single day. Around 83 people were killed. On 11 July 2006, a series of seven bomb blasts took place {{over a period of}} 11 minutes on the Suburban Railway in Mumbai at Khar, Mahim, Matunga, Jogeshwari, Borivali, and one between Khar and Santa Cruz. 209 people were killed and over 700 were injured. According to Mumbai Police, the bombings were carried out by Lashkar-e-Toiba and Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI). In 2008, the city experienced xenophobic attacks by the activists of the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) under Raj Thackeray on the North Indian migrants in Mumbai. Attacks included assault on North Indian taxi drivers and damage of their vehicles. There were a series of ten coordinated terrorist attacks by 10 armed Pakistani men using <b>automatic</b> <b>weapons</b> and grenades which began on 26 November 2008 and ended on 29 November 2008. The attacks resulted in 164 deaths, 308 injuries, and severe damage to several important buildings. The city again saw a series of three coordinated bomb explosions at different locations on 13 July 2011 between 18:54 and 19:06 IST. The blasts occurred at the Opera House, Zaveri Bazaar, and Dadar, which left 26 killed, and 130 injured. The city's Wankhede Stadium was the venue for 2011 Cricket World Cup final, where India emerged as a champion for the second time after the 1983 Cricket World Cup.|$|E
