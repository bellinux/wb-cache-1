25|$|The poem {{allows the}} reader to {{experience}} this, her dying wish, in a very personal and powerful way as she entreats us to come in close <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> {{she has to say}} like a loved one and a confidence. Yet the reader is {{struck by the fact that}} even as we read her final request, we know it goes un-honored. This has a further social implication on the silencing of marginalized cultures and, additionally, women.|$|E
2500|$|According to Jardine, {{each member}} was taught their {{individual}} vocal lines by Brian at a piano. He explains, [...] "Every night we'd {{come in for}} a playback. We'd sit around <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> we did the night before. Someone might say, well, that's pretty good but we can do that better... We had somewhat photographic memory as far as the vocal parts were concerned so that never a problem for us." [...] This process proved to be the most exacting work the group had undertaken yet. During recording, Mike Love often called Brian [...] "dog ears", a nickname referencing a canine's ability to detect sounds far beyond the limits of human hearing. Love later summarized: ...|$|E
2500|$|... 11 April - Members of the Movement of Young Venezuelans began {{a hunger}} strike while {{continuing}} to protest in tents {{in front of the}} UN headquarters. Diosdado Cabello insulted opposition members who attended the peace talks a day before declaring, [...] "They sat a group of Venezuelans whose intention to sit <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> we were saying is recognized, but do not like to be told things". Leaders of Popular Will told Venezuelans to keep protesting until the Venezuelan government provided changes and said that the previous day peace talks had taken place in [...] "unfair conditions", during which [...] "a sole party acted as moderator". [...] A group on motorcycles protested in Sucre causing blockages of traffic.|$|E

6000|$|... 'But {{do you not}} think,' said Anne, 'that {{enduring}} restraint, <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> is not amusing, for {{the sake}} of pleasing others, is doing something?' ...|$|R
6000|$|We sat {{so still}} that the {{woodpeckers}} came [...] And pillaged the berries overhead; [...] From his log the chipmonk, waxen tame, [...] Peered, <b>and</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> we said.|$|R
2500|$|With 19 Recordings {{continuing}} to manage him, DeWyze chose {{to take an}} optimistic view {{of the situation and}} saw it as an opportunity to finally make the record that he had always wanted to make. Feeling that he had been misunderstood as an artist, he returned to a folk rock sound, more comparable to what had been present on his independent albums. Many people were surprised to hear him release music in this style and drew comparisons to Mumford & Sons, but DeWyze responded, [...] "anyone can go back <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> I was doing when I was sixteen or seventeen years old, {{those are the kind of}} records that I was making then. I just wasn't able to put them out there like I am now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, they've all settled it amongst themselves, haven't they?" [...] he murmured. [...] "Here you may sit <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> may {{be called}} the modern voice." ...|$|E
6000|$|Friends {{and neighbors}} all draw near, [...] <b>And</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> I have to say; [...] And never leave your {{children}} dear [...] When they are small, and go away.|$|E
60|$|He saw Ferris {{in earnest}} {{conversation}} {{at a small}} counter, which ran across the office, which was narrow but quite deep. Hal edged up <b>and</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> passed between the tall youth and a man in charge.|$|R
50|$|The {{adventure}} part {{is similar}} to most Japanese romantic adventure games: the player reads <b>and</b> <b>listens</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> a girl says and occasionally has to choose an answer. The dialogue sequences are interspersed with mini-games such as rock-paper-scissors or rhythm games like PaRappa the Rapper.|$|R
5000|$|So if {{somebody}} is watching tonight <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> {{the two of you}} just said, is it fair to say, okay, the differences between Governor Bush and Vice President Gore are as follows. You're for doing something on the consumption end and you're for doing something on the production end? How would you draw the difference? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come on <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> happens," [...] said Andy, and presently, having {{slipped off}} their shoes, {{he and the}} others {{followed}} Walt down the corridor, but kept well in the background.|$|E
6000|$|... “Oh, do let’s all {{go down to}} the cow-house <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> they’ve got to say!” exclaimed Beryl, to whom {{anything}} was thrilling and amusing if you did it in a troop.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the letters}} differ in length {{in accord with}} the needs of each community, all {{conclude}} with an appeal to hold fast <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> the Spirit is saying to the churches. Each church is promised that everyone who conquers will be rewarded by Christ.|$|R
5000|$|The band {{decided to}} rewrite the whole album {{following}} Taylor's departure. Fourteen songs had been completed for Reportage but according to Simon Le Bon: [...] "When we sat down <b>and</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> we had done on our own, we didn’t feel we had a lead track, so we {{got in touch with}} Timbaland, who was the only producer out there that we knew we all liked." ...|$|R
60|$|The answer {{had been}} wrung from him. Still, {{it was the}} answer she wanted--it {{opened the door to}} hope. The instant he had consented to hear her her mind awakened to the serious {{necessity}} of averting discovery by any third person who might stray idly into the summer-house. She held up her hand for silence, <b>and</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> was going forward on the lawn.|$|R
6000|$|In {{the front}} room she could only lie back in the Morris chair sobbing, <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> {{occurred}} in the kitchen. [...] "I'll stay {{to the end of}} the week," [...] the fireman was saying. [...] "I've paid in advance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lawsy!" [...] exclaimed Polly Ann. [...] "Be still, honey!" [...] Taking a {{piece of}} corn-pone from the cupboard, she bent over and thrust it between little Peggy's chubby fingers [...] "Be still, honey, <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> your Pa says. Whar did ye find 'em, Tom?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall be}} ready {{to pack up and}} follow you any day, Merton. And I think that I might assist you a little; at all events I shall try, and go about among the women <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> they say while you are {{listening}} to the men." ...|$|E
60|$|Byron Lyall, a grizzled, elderly man, half farmer, half fisherman, and Maxwell Holmes, the Prospect schoolteacher, {{came up to}} {{the boat}} presently. Paul lay softly <b>and</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> they were saying. He was not troubled by any sense of dishonour. Honour was {{something}} Paul King could not lose since it was something he had never possessed. They were talking of him and Joan.|$|R

5000|$|... "The {{problem with}} Index on Censorships {{position}} is that, by its nature, {{they have to}} publish things that they dont agree with {{in order to prove}} their own point. I would hope that by giving a fanatic a platform <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> he says, that people would be able to see how crazy that person is and refute his arguments. On the other hand, no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the public." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} all right, if I were once in a seaport. No one {{would be likely to}} ask me any questions. Then I could stroll about, <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> was said and, certainly, I could talk quite well enough to go in and get a meal, and all that sort of thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{will be no}} {{occasion}} for vigorous action, at least as regards me, if you will agree to forget your suspicions for a few minutes, <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> I have got to say. Meanwhile, in order to shew you how thoroughly in earnest I am, and how regardless of my personal safety, I render myself defenceless--thus." ...|$|E

He know your voice, Blossom, <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> you say; but he won't hear Peter, who has so long hated his enemy. P'raps he angry if he hear Peter speak." ...|$|E
60|$|He passed, however, for {{an admirer}} of her dancing; and Sir Thomas, by no means displeased, {{prolonged}} the conversation on dancing in general, and was so well engaged in describing the balls of Antigua, <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> his nephew could relate of the different modes of dancing which had fallen within his observation, {{that he had not}} heard his carriage announced, and was first called to the knowledge of it by the bustle of Mrs. Norris.|$|R
50|$|Kenney {{first began}} {{recording}} her songs {{at a small}} recording studio housed at the Shambhala School, a non-denominational private school in Halifax, when she was 17. Joel Plaskett visited the school one day to talk about playing and recording music, <b>and</b> <b>listened</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> she had recorded. Two years later, Plaskett's manager called Kenney {{with the news that}} she was invited to attend Gordie Sampson's Songcamp in Cape Breton. Kenney later began working on her first recording with Plaskett, starting in April 2011.|$|R

6000|$|... "D'you hear that?" [...] whispered Sharp to Gurwood, as the [...] "fwend" [...] in question--he {{with the}} checked trousers--sauntered past holding a {{handkerchief}} to his nose. [...] "I know {{by the way}} in which that was said that there will be something more heard some day hence of our fop in checks. Just come and stand with me {{in the doorway of the}} waiting-room, <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> some of the other passengers are saying." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If only I had {{the address}} of that Obadiah Jones, I might go and see him <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> {{he has to say}} about Ward Porton," [...] he told himself. [...] "Of course he may not be Porton's uncle at all--I know lots of {{children}} taken from poorhouses and orphan asylums who call the folks aunt and uncle. But even if he isn't, he may be able to give me some information that will put me on the right track regarding this affair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've got {{the front}} room all ready for you," [...] went on the aunt. And she led {{the way into the}} house and to the {{apartment}} in question. Here the sufferer was put to bed, and his aunt did all in her power to make him comfortable. The local doctor had already been notified, and soon he appeared, to read a note written by the city specialist <b>and</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> Sam had to tell him. Then he took charge and said Tom must be kept very quiet.|$|E
60|$|On {{hearing the}} {{declaration}} of the Jewish doctor, {{the chief of police}} commanded that he should be led to the gallows, and the Sultan's purveyor go free. The cord was placed round the Jew's neck, and his feet had already ceased to touch the ground when the voice of the tailor was heard beseeching the executioner to pause one moment <b>and</b> <b>to</b> <b>listen</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> he had <b>to</b> say.|$|R
5000|$|Mansell {{researched}} possible {{scores to}} compose one tying together the three storylines. He sought {{to have an}} organic feeling to the score and explored implementing orchestral and electronic elements that would have [...] "a real human element to them that breathes". Contrary to most films' scores composed in post-production, Mansell's score was composed concurrently with the film's production; he created a mood that flourished as the film progressed. The composer described the parallel process, [...] "It's instinct <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> the film is telling you it needs".|$|R
60|$|He sank {{upon the}} settle as one quite worn out. The ale was brought by some one, and he drank a long draught, while, at a sign from Ridley, {{one of the}} serving-men began to draw off his heavy boots and greaves, covered with frosted mud, snow, and blood, all melting together, but {{all the time he}} talked, and the hearers {{remained}} stunned <b>and</b> <b>listening</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> had hardly yet penetrated their understanding. Lady Whitburn had collapsed into her own chair, and was as still as the rest.|$|R
