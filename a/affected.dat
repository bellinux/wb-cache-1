The concept of meta-affect was introduced by DeBellis and Goldin (1997). Just as meta-cognition describes how cognitive mental systems are handled, meta-affect describes how the mind handles <b>affect.</b> Goldin describes meta-affect in the following way: “An idea that has assumed a central role in our thinking is meta-affect, referring to <b>affect</b> about <b>affect,</b> <b>affect</b> about and within cognition that may again be about <b>affect,</b> monitoring of <b>affect</b> both through cognition and <b>affect.</b> Our hypothesis is that meta-affect is {{the most important aspect of}} <b>affect</b> ” (Goldin, 2004; 113).

40|$|Alexithymia {{has been}} {{frequently}} {{studied in the}} context of negative <b>affect</b> frequency but rarely {{in the context of}} positive <b>affect</b> frequency or in the context of <b>affect</b> intensity. However, <b>affect</b> intensity and frequency, even if they are independent, are generally confounded due to an overlap in items wording (tapping both dimensions). The aim {{of the study was to}} examine the incremental validity of alexithymia for predicting both <b>affect</b> intensity and frequency, regarding positive and negative valence. Two hundred and fifty five students fulfilled measurements for alexithymia, <b>affect</b> intensity and <b>affect</b> frequency. Results showed that the factor "Difficulty identifying feelings" is related to higher positive and negative <b>affect</b> intensity, as well as to negative <b>affect</b> frequency. Men were also more sensitive to positive <b>affect</b> intensity and frequency if they scored higher on alexithymia. They experienced less often positive <b>affect,</b> but the intensity of their <b>affect</b> was more intense. Conversely, alexithymia did not influence women's <b>affect</b> intensity or <b>affect</b> frequency. Thus, alexithymia factors are associated with specific patterns of <b>affect</b> intensity and frequency, highlighting an overall deficit in the processing of emotions with contrasting patterns regarding gender.

30|$|<b>Affect</b> {{is used as}} an {{umbrella}} term for emotions, moods, and traits (Barsade and Gibson 2007). Researchers recognize two categories of affect: trait <b>affect</b> and state <b>affect.</b> Trait <b>affect</b> reflects an individual’s tendency to produce a specific emotion across different situations, whereas state <b>affect</b> refers to an individual’s <b>affect</b> at a given point in time (Watson et al. 1988). Some scholars have argued that state <b>affect</b> has a more direct impact on human behavior than trait <b>affect</b> (Elfenbein 2007). In addition, a previous study found that positive <b>affect</b> was positively associated with positive behaviors, such as organizational citizenship (Shockley et al. 2012). Therefore, in this study, {{we focus on the}} positive <b>affect</b> and assume that it plays a critical role in linking transformational leadership to voice.|$|R

30|$|The Bradburn’s <b>Affect</b> Balance Scale (ABS) (Bradburn 1969) {{was used}} to assess the students’ <b>affect</b> states. There are 10 items in the scale. Five items explore {{positive}} <b>affect,</b> while the other five items examine negative <b>affect.</b> The students’ <b>affect</b> states were measured as a net balance of negative <b>affect</b> (5 items) and positive <b>affect</b> (5 items). Participants were asked if they had experienced certain emotions in the previous four weeks (e.g. feeling “bored” or “on top of the world”). Responses were made in a “yes” and “no” format but only each affirmative answer would be given one score. The overall “Affect Balance Score” (ABS) comes from subtracting the negative <b>affect</b> score from the positive <b>affect</b> score. Higher ABS scores suggest more positive <b>affect</b> is being experienced. The ABS has been tested to be a reliable and valid instrument (Bradburn 1969). Internal consistency reliabilities for Negative <b>Affect</b> scores range from 0.61 to 0.73; for Positive <b>Affect</b> scores range between 0.55 and 0.73. Factor analyses indicated that positive and negative <b>affect</b> were distinct dimensions with small associations between them (0.04 – 0.15).|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Although {{difficulty}} with <b>affect</b> regulation {{is generally considered}} a core component of borderline personality disorder (BPD), surprisingly little {{research has focused on}} the nature of <b>affect</b> regulation and dysregulation in BPD. A random national sample of 117 experienced clinicians provided data on a randomly selected patient with BPD (N 90) or dysthymic disorder (DD; N 27). Clinicians described their patients using the <b>Affect</b> Regulation and Experience Q-sort-Questionnaire Version, a psychometric instru-ment designed for expert informants to assess <b>affect</b> and <b>affect</b> regulation. BPD and DD patients appear to differ in both the emotions they experience and the ways they regulate or fail to regulate them. Whereas DD patients are characterized by negative <b>affect,</b> BPD patients are characterized by both negative <b>affect</b> and <b>affect</b> dysregulation, which appear to be distinct constructs.

40|$|Therapist {{effects have}} been {{increasingly}} {{recognized as an}} important contributor of psychotherapy process and outcome. Most therapist factors studied so far, however, have been trait factors. Little is known about state factors. Given the emotional nature of psychotherapy, therapist affective states seem relevant. In particular, how does therapist <b>affect</b> change in sessions? What predict therapist <b>affect</b> change, and how is therapist <b>affect</b> related to psychotherapy process and outcome? Data involved 1, 172 sessions of 15 therapists and 51 clients at a psychodynamically-oriented psychotherapy clinic. Therapists and clients rated pre-session <b>affect</b> and post-session <b>affect,</b> as well as post-session working alliance, session quality, and real relationship. Participants also wrote down their <b>affect</b> changes, and attributions to these changes, {{at the end of}} each session. Quantitative data were analyzed using multilevel modeling. Qualitative data were analyzed using Consensual Qualitative Research. Therapists qualitatively reported <b>affect</b> changes in 67 % of sessions, with equal amounts of increases in positive and negative <b>affect.</b> Therapists most frequently attributed their increase in positive <b>affect</b> to being able to collaborate with clients, and their increase in negative <b>affect</b> to having difficult clients. Therapist pre- to post-session change in <b>affect</b> was related to client pre-session <b>affect</b> and client pre- to post-session change in <b>affect.</b> After controlling for therapist change in <b>affect</b> from pre- to post-session, higher therapist pre-session positive <b>affect</b> was associated with better client-rated working alliance and session quality, whereas higher therapist pre-session negative <b>affect</b> was associated with poorer client-rated session quality. Increase in therapist positive <b>affect</b> from pre- to post-session was related to better client-rated session quality and therapist-rated working alliance, session quality, and real relationship, whereas increase in therapist negative <b>affect</b> was related to poorer client-rated real relationship and therapist-rated working alliance, session quality, and real relationship.

40|$|This {{study is}} an attempt at getting a better {{understanding}} of the relationship between the therapist's <b>affect</b> attunement and the patient's motivation, and find out to what degree the patient's experience of <b>affect</b> contributes to this relationship. It was assumed that <b>affect</b> attunement would lead to a more profound experience of <b>affect,</b> which again would increase motivation for therapeutic change. The selection comprises 18 videotaped first-sessions encounters across a variety of different psychotherapeutic modalities. The <b>Affect</b> Attunement Scales (AAS) were used to assess therapist levels of <b>affect</b> attunement, and the Achievement of Therapeutic Objectives Scale (ATOS) was applied for assessing the patient degree of <b>affect</b> experience and degree of motivation. The results revealed that the patient's degree of <b>affect</b> seems to play a pivotal part in explaining the relationship between <b>affect</b> attunement and motivation. The results further suggested that higher levels of <b>affect</b> attunement in the therapist`s response, was followed by increased levels of <b>affect</b> experience in the patient, which again predicted higher levels of patient's motivation. Following the results, the present study emphasizes the importance of therapist's <b>affect</b> attunement and the patient's <b>affect</b> experience in order to explain what leads to motivation for change in a therapeutic setting...|$|R
