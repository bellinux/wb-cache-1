5|$|In tone clusters, {{the notes}} are sounded fully and in unison, {{distinguishing}} them from ornamented figures involving acciaccaturas and the like. Their effect {{also tends to}} be different: where ornamentation is used {{to draw attention to}} the harmony or the relationship between harmony and melody, tone clusters are for the most part employed as independent sounds. While, by definition, the notes that form a cluster must sound at the same time, there is no requirement that they must all begin sounding at the same moment. For example, in R. Murray Schafer's choral Epitaph for Moonlight (1968), a tone cluster is constructed by dividing each choir section (soprano/alto/tenor/bass) into four parts. Each of the sixteen parts enters separately, humming a note one semitone lower than the note hummed by the previous part, until all sixteen <b>are</b> <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> the cluster.|$|E
5|$|The major {{differences}} in life expectancy for women between {{developed and developing}} countries lie in the childbearing years. If a woman survives this period, {{the differences between the}} two regions become less marked, since in later life non-communicable diseases (NCDs) become the major causes of death in women throughout the world, with cardiovascular deaths accounting for 45% of deaths in older women, followed by cancer (15%) and lung disease (10%). These create additional burdens on the resources of developing countries. Changing lifestyles, including diet, physical activity and cultural factors that favour larger body size in women, <b>are</b> <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> an increasing problem with obesity and diabetes amongst women in these countries and increasing the risks of cardiovascular disease and other NCDs.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the main}} pillars of REBT is that irrational and {{dysfunctional}} ways and patterns of thinking, feeling and behaving <b>are</b> <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> much, though hardly all, human disturbance and emotional and behavioral self-defeatism and social defeatism. REBT generally teaches that when people turn flexible preferences, desires and wishes into grandiose, absolutistic and fatalistic dictates, this tends to contribute to disturbance and upset.|$|E
25|$|The {{economy is}} at a boom level and is {{increasing}} dramatically. Housing costs are rising as are employee wages. The {{cost of living}} has increased dramatically which {{is a problem for}} the non-educated Afghans, who cannot support themselves.

While Spain's economy itself is not doing great, purchasing power parity is generally going back up.

25|$|As {{it becomes}} more {{apparent}} that belowground organisms and functions heavily influence forest productivity, recovery and stability, ectomycorrhiza are becoming a prime focus for conservation ecologists. The recent decline of many species of EcM fungi in Europe has also allowed the importance of EcM disappearance to gain traction in more widespread conservation circles. Many factors <b>are</b> <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> the decline, including reduced tree vitality, conversion of forests to other uses, pollution and acidification of forest soils.|$|E
25|$|Children who are obese {{are likely}} to be obese as adults. Thus, they are more at risk for adult health {{problems}} such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, several types of cancer, and osteoarthritis. One study showed that children who became obese as early as age 2 {{were more likely to be}} obese as adults. According to an article in The New York Times all of these health effects <b>are</b> <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> a shorter lifespan of five years for these obese children. It is the first time in two centuries that the current generation of children in America may have a shorter lifespan than their parents.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, hip hop and rap pioneer Chuck D, {{from the}} group Public Enemy criticized young hip hop artists from the 2010s, stating that they have taken a music genre with {{extensive}} roots in underground music {{and turned it into}} commercialized pop music. In particular, seminal figures in the early underground, politically-motivated music, such as Ice T, have criticized current hip hop artists for being more concerned with image than substance. Critics have stated that 2010s hip hop artists <b>are</b> <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> cultural stereotyping of African-American culture and are poseur gangsters. Critics have also stated that hip hop music promotes drug use and violence.|$|E

25|$|The 2007 {{documentary}} America the Beautiful explores how {{the fashion}} and beauty industries <b>are</b> <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> {{the problems that}} individuals feel regarding body image due to their beauty obsession. The film discusses {{a wide range of}} topics like plastic surgery, dieting, eating disorders, the modeling industry along with the fashion industry and much more. Young middle-school aged girls were portrayed {{in the beginning of the}} film and asked if they found themselves beautiful. The girls who are around the ages of 13 had decided that they were not beautiful. In today's society, people are starting to see themselves as ugly at an earlier age than ever before. As individuals who identify as ugly increase, the number of body image issues also increase.|$|E
25|$|Vouvrays {{are known}} for their {{longevity}} and aging potential, particularly if the vintage was favorable. Some wines, most notably the sweeter Moelleux styles, have the potential to age and develop in the bottle for several decades to a century. While modern producers <b>are</b> <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> making examples more approachable to drink while young, some premium examples still made in the traditionally high acid style will often need 3 to 7 years of bottle age before the acidity tones down. Dry or Sec examples from favorable vintages can have the potential to age for 15â€“20 years or more but many are ready to drink within 4 or 5 years after vintage. Sparkling Vouvrays tend not to have the same aging potential as their still wine counterparts or vintage dated Champagne and are usually meant to be consumed within 3 years of vintage or, for non-vintage bottling, soon after purchase.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the genre}} was pioneered by Rudra {{in the late}} 1990s, it has grown in popularity. Bands like Wingz of Vayraag(India), Aryadeva (Ukraine), Symmetry (Indonesia), Warriors of Peace (India), Asura (India), Advaita (India), The Aryan March (India), Bhairav (India), Madhavas Rock Band (India), Narasimha (Singapore), Kaliyuga (Singapore), Azrael (Australia), Dying Out Flame (Nepal), Blue River (Sri Lanka) and Punarjanma (India) have done {{pioneering}} work in the genre. Often, along with the Vedic lyrics, the music has shades of Indian classical music. With {{the introduction of new}} subgenre of heavy metal,the Vedic-Core bands like, Antim-Yuddha, Roktobeej <b>are</b> <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> the Rising Indian Underground Rock Culture.The definitive album of this genre is the Rudra album The Aryan Crusade released in 2001. In addition, India has produced many metal bands that combine ethnic-folk music with various forms of metal to create folk metal bands. Indian rock has been influenced by some notable cultural trends, and has in turn produced influences of its own. Indian musicians have also collaborated with other musicians from across the globe.|$|E

25|$|The natural area, {{which has}} been named as an Important Bird Area, is studded with cliffs and eroded {{sandstone}} badlands that serve as important nesting and foraging habitat to the area's raptors. Important birds of prey are the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), ferruginous hawk (Buteo regalis), prairie falcon (Falco mexicanus), and burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia), of which the burrowing owl and ferruginous hawk are considered endangered in Alberta, and the prairie falcon, a species of special concern. Raptor populations have experienced rebounds since the 1970s when the insecticide DDT was outlawed, but new concerns about other pesticides and PCBs along with habitat degradation and land use conversion <b>are</b> <b>contributing</b> <b>to</b> the decline of species such as the burrowing owl. The prairie falcon is at its northern range limit in southern Alberta and although populations appear to be stable at present, loss of grasslands and subsequent decline in their prey of ground squirrels may lead to reduced numbers of falcons. Endemic to western North America, the ferruginous hawk is under threatened status nationally and {{appears to have been}} decreasing in numbers since at least 1987, possibly due to prey availability, or habitat or land use change; subsequently, nest poles have been erected to facilitate nesting. The Milk River is also home to many pond and wetland birds, and the grasslands are sharp-tailed grouse (Pedioecetes phasianellus) dancing grounds, or leks. Sharp-tailed grouse also appear to be declining in Alberta and are considered a sensitive species due to the increase of land-use conversion to agriculture.|$|E

Native Americans in Phoenix, Arizona picketed at the game between the Chiefs and the Arizona Cardinals, and have asked the Cardinals' management to bar [...] "Redface", the wearing of headdresses and face paint, protesting what they perceive to be a mockery of Native American culture. A protest took place in Minnesota when the Chiefs played the Vikings on October 18, 2015.
