40|$|Abstract. In many chess tournaments {{the number}} of players is much larger than {{the number of}} rounds to be played. In such tournaments the Swiss pairing system is usually used. This means that players with equal or almost equal scores so far are played <b>against</b> <b>each</b> <b>others.</b> Moreover, <b>each</b> player should {{alternately}} have, if possible, white and black pieces, and every pair of two players is allowed to play at most once <b>against</b> <b>each</b> <b>others.</b> This paper shows how the well-known stable roommates algorithm can be used to determine the pairs in a pairing system similar to the Swiss system...|$|R

5|$|Six {{teams from}} North America and six teams {{representing}} {{the rest of}} the World play a series of games <b>against</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> in order to win points. The first side to win a majority of the points available wins the cup. Teams compete in four formats: team games, mixed doubles games, singles competitions, and skins games. Team games are regular curling games, with two teams of four playing <b>against</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Mixed doubles games involve two teams, each consisting of one male and one female, playing <b>against</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> Mixed doubles teams use only six stones per end, one of which is positioned {{prior to the start of}} the end. This is in contrast to the eight stones per end used by teams of four in regular curling games. The singles competition involves two teams playing <b>against</b> <b>each</b> <b>other.</b> There are six types of shots contested in the singles competitions. Each curler from each team is assigned to throw at least one type of shot. Points are given based on how well the shot is made. After all of the shots have been thrown, the team with the most points wins the competition. Skins games involve two teams playing <b>against</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> where the objective is to win skins by scoring two or more points with the hammer or stealing points without the hammer. The points for the skins games, which go toward the total points for the cup, are distributed throughout the game, and the teams earn these points by winning skins.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the link between}} income volatility and household decision. I develop a collective model to study how married couples insure <b>against</b> <b>each</b> <b>other’s</b> permanent and transitory wage shocks by making joint labor supply decision. Estimation using SIPP 2001 panel provides some evidence on household insurance. Couples insure against both permanent and transitory wage shocks via household labor supply, while labor response is larger to the shocks which are permanent. There is little evidence of insurance by labor supply for liquidity constrained households, and little evidence of insurance against high individual wage volatility...|$|R

40|$|Sexual {{conflict}} {{occurs when}} {{males and females}} act <b>against</b> <b>each</b> <b>others</b> 2 ̆ 7 interest, typically resulting in selection favoring harmful males. We performed laboratory experiments on sexual conflict that both confined individuals in isolated groups, which prevents selection acting counter to this conflict, and provided more naturalistic multigroup population structures. We show that in water striders, aggressive male mating behavior was strongly favored within groups but not favored in a multigroup population when individuals can freely disperse among groups. These observations explain the persistence of less-aggressive males within natural populations...|$|R
