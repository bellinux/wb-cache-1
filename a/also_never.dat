5|$|Partial capping (covering) of the site: The {{ore body}} in Iron Mountain was {{determined}} to be shallow, so this alternative was considered. However, the recurring high occurrence of fractures in the mountain made this inefficient, so it was <b>also</b> <b>never</b> implemented.|$|E

5|$|After Knight's granddaughter {{forwarded}} him {{a copy of}} Knight's autobiographical manuscript, Ottaviani made Knight's role more prominent. Ottaviani's {{interest in}} Knight eventually led to his company G.T. Labs publishing Knight's autobiography, with notes by Ottaviani and forewords by Ray Bradbury and Ray Harryhausen. Other character relationships were fictionalized as well; editor James Gordon Bennet, Jr. never lobbied with Cope, and never exposed Marsh's will. Cope's bones <b>also</b> <b>never</b> made it to New York.|$|E
5|$|Although she {{was never}} {{successful}} in her {{more than a decade}} of legal pursuits for recompense from the United States government for seized land, in 1911 she was finally granted a $1,250 a month lifetime pension by the Territory of Hawaii. Historian Sydney Lehua Iaukea noted that besides being a greatly reduced figure from what she had asked for recompense, it <b>also</b> <b>never</b> addressed the question of the legality of the seizure itself.|$|E
5|$|Despite Marx's {{stress on}} {{critique}} {{of capitalism and}} discussion of the new communist society that should replace it, his explicit critique of capitalism is guarded, {{as he saw it}} as an improved society compared to the past ones (slavery and feudal). Marx <b>also</b> <b>never</b> clearly discusses issues of morality and justice, although scholars agree that his work contained implicit discussion of those concepts.|$|E

5|$|The {{project was}} never carried out, being {{cancelled}} primarily {{out of a}} fear of a negative public reaction, with the potential militarization of space that it would also have signified, and because a moon landing would undoubtedly be a more popular achievement {{in the eyes of}} the American and international public alike. A similar project by the Soviet Union <b>also</b> <b>never</b> came to fruition.|$|E

5|$|Each cavalry {{regiment}} was {{to consist}} of four cavalry squadrons, a machine gun squadron, and an engineer squadron. Shortly before the war, an abortive {{attempt was made to}} motorise the 1st Cavalry Division, but this was stymied by a lack of motor transport and the division largely remained a horsed formation throughout its existence. The 1st Cavalry Division was <b>also</b> <b>never</b> equipped with the planned motorised anti-tank battery, and the divisional artillery battalion was largely equipped with World War I-vintage pieces. Two peacetime components of the division, the 2nd Cavalry Brigade and 3rd Cavalry Regiment, were earmarked to join other formations when they were mobilised, so the primary fighting formation of the 1st Cavalry Division was the 1st Cavalry Brigade, commanding the 2nd, 6th and 8th Cavalry Regiments.|$|E
5|$|Following his {{discharge}} from the RAAF as an honorary air vice marshal, Anderson lived in East Melbourne. A lifelong bachelor, he shared a house with his sister, who <b>also</b> <b>never</b> married. From 1947 until 1971, he served as honorary chairman of the Victorian branch of the Services Canteens Trust Fund. On 31March 1971, he was among {{a select group of}} surviving founder members of the RAAF who attended a celebratory dinner at the Hotel Canberra to mark the service's Golden Jubilee; his fellow guests included Air Marshal Williams, Air Vice-Marshal Wrigley, Air Commodore Hippolyte (Frank) De La Rue, and Wing Commander Sir Lawrence Wackett. Bill Anderson died on his birthday in 1975, and was buried in Boroondara Cemetery, Kew.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1960s, a limited-access {{toll road}} called the Garden State Thruway was planned along the US 9 {{alignment}} between Toms River and Woodbridge. This freeway {{was intended to}} serve all vehicles and provide a shortcut to the Garden State Parkway and US 9 through central New Jersey but was never built. In the early 1970s, another plan surfaced for a US 9 freeway from Route 34 in Madison Township (now Old Bridge Township) north to Route 35 in Sayreville. The freeway, which was to cost $17 million, was not built due to financial problems. A freeway was also proposed for US 9 in Atlantic County in the late 1960s, running from the proposed Route 60 freeway in Somers Point to CR 575 in Smithville. This freeway, which was to cost $35 million and intended to alleviate traffic on the current US 9 and the Garden State Parkway, was <b>also</b> <b>never</b> built due to financial and environmental issues.|$|E

5|$|James was not {{a perfect}} {{stand-in}} for Montgomery. He had lost a finger during the First World War, so a prosthetic had to be made. He had <b>also</b> <b>never</b> flown before, so the London Controlling Section's Dennis Wheatley took James up for a test flight {{to make sure he}} did not suffer from air sickness. Finally, James both drank heavily and smoked cigars, while Montgomery was a teetotaler and disliked smoking. The deception planners were worried that James might be spotted drinking, spoiling the performance. Despite these hitches, and with Montgomery's approval, the plan went forward. To get into character, James spent some time with the general, posing as a journalist, to study his mannerisms.|$|E
5|$|Kosygin {{initiated}} the 1973 Soviet economic reform {{to enhance the}} powers and functions of the regional planners by establishing associations. The reform was never fully implemented; indeed, members of the Soviet leadership complained that the reform had not even begun {{by the time of}} the 1979 reform. The 1979 Soviet economic reform was initiated to improve the then-stagnating Soviet economy. The reform's goal was to increase the powers of the central ministries by centralising the Soviet economy to an even greater extent. This reform was <b>also</b> <b>never</b> fully implemented, and when Kosygin died in 1980 it was practically abandoned by his successor, Nikolai Tikhonov. Tikhonov told the Soviet people at the 26th Party Congress that the reform was to be implemented, or at least parts of it, during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (1981–1985). Despite this, the reform never came to fruition. The reform is seen by several Sovietologists as the last major pre-perestroika reform initiative put forward by the Soviet government.|$|E
5|$|Some {{women were}} able {{to arrive at the}} {{recruiting}} station in a man's suit, deny ever having been in love with another woman, and be easily inducted. Sexual activity, however, was forbidden, and blue discharge was almost certain if one identified oneself as a lesbian. As women found each other, they formed into tight groups on base, socialized at service clubs, and began to use code words. Historian Allan Bérubé documented that homosexuals in the armed forces either consciously or subconsciously refused to identify themselves as homosexual or lesbian, and <b>also</b> <b>never</b> spoke about others' orientation.|$|E

5|$|In June 2007, Jones {{was traded}} to the Portland Trail Blazers along with the draft rights to Rudy Fernandez, the 24th pick in the 2007 NBA draft, in {{exchange}} for cash considerations. In late January 2008, Jones was leading the NBA in three-point percentage with a percentage slightly over 50%. He missed 12 games from February 4 to February 27 with a knee injury. He had also missed 12 games in November 2007 due to knee problems, spending five games on the inactive list and seven as a DNP-CD. Jones finished the 2007–08 season third in the league in three-point percentage with a percentage of 44.4%. Despite his good shooting for the year, he was not selected to participate in the Three-Point Shootout contest during the 2008 NBA All-Star Game, much to the chagrin of Trail Blazers fans. He played in 58 games, starting 3, during the season while averaging 8.0 points, 2.8 rebounds and 22.0 minutes per game. The Trail Blazers finished the 2007–08 season with a 41–41 record. That season was the only time in Jones's NBA career that he missed the playoffs. He was <b>also</b> <b>never</b> on a team with a losing record. On June 26, 2008, he used his player option to opt out of his contract with the Trail Blazers, making him a free agent for the off-season.|$|E
5|$|The HL234, {{an engine}} born from the {{developments}} initiated {{by attempting to}} convert the Maybach HL230 to fuel injection, would have increased the power to about 800 to 900 PS (hp). The Entwicklungskommission Panzer unanimously decided that HL234 be immediately included in the engine design and procurement program. The AK-7-200 was also explored {{as an alternative to}} the Maybach Olvar-B drive train, but Waffenamt research and development department Wa Prüf 6 found that it offered inferior driving characteristics and so the Maybach Olvar-B was retained. There are also a program using the Simmering- Graz-Pauker Sla.16 engine, but the war's constraint on supplies and capitulation resulted in the cancellation of this program. Krupp proposed mounting a new main weapon, the 10.5cm KwK L/68. Wa Prüf 6 was not supportive of this as the Heer had not accepted the cannon itself. Other suggested improvements included stabilised sights, a stabilised main gun, an automatic ammunition feed, a Zeiss stereoscopic range finder, heated crew compartment, stowage for an additional 12 rounds, and an overpressure & air filtration system to protect against poison gas. However, these <b>also</b> <b>never</b> got beyond the proposal stage or did not enter production before the war ended.|$|E
