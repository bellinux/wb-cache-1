40|$|AbstractThe {{current work}} {{can be seen as}} a {{starting}} point for the discussion of the problematic on risk <b>acceptance</b> <b>criteria</b> in occupational environments. Some obstacles to the quantitative <b>acceptance</b> <b>criteria</b> formulation and use were analyzed. A look to the long tradition of major hazards accidents was also performed. This work shows that organizations can have several difficulties in <b>acceptance</b> <b>criteria</b> formulation and that the use of pre-defined <b>acceptance</b> <b>criteria</b> in risk assessment methodologies can be inadequate in some cases. It is urgent to define guidelines that can help organizations in the formulation of risk <b>acceptance</b> <b>criteria</b> for occupational environments...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{appropriate}} <b>acceptance</b> <b>criteria</b> {{in the risk}} assessment process for occupational accidents {{is an important issue}} but often overlooked in the literature, particularly when new risk assessment methods are proposed and discussed. In most cases, there is no information on how or by whom they were defined, or even how companies can adapt them to their own circumstances. Bearing this in mind, this study analysed the problem of the definition of risk <b>acceptance</b> <b>criteria</b> for occupational settings, defining the quantitative <b>acceptance</b> <b>criteria</b> for the specific case study of the Portuguese furniture industrial sector. The key steps to be considered in formulating <b>acceptance</b> <b>criteria</b> were analysed in the literature review. By applying the identified steps, the <b>acceptance</b> <b>criteria</b> for the furniture industrial sector were then defined. The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) for the injury statistics of the industrial sector was identified as the maximum tolerable risk level. The acceptable threshold was defined by adjusting the CDF to the Occupational, Safety & Health (OSH) practitioners’ risk acceptance judgement. Adjustments of <b>acceptance</b> <b>criteria</b> to the companies’ safety cultures were exemplified by adjusting the Burr distribution parameters. An example of a risk matrix was also used to demonstrate the integration of the defined <b>acceptance</b> <b>criteria</b> into a risk metric. This work has provided substantial contributions to the issue of <b>acceptance</b> <b>criteria</b> for occupational accidents, which may be useful in overcoming the practical difficulties faced by authorities, companies and experts...|$|R
40|$|The American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler and Pressure Vessel (B&PV) Code was {{primarily}} written with stress-based <b>acceptance</b> <b>criteria.</b> These criteria are applicable to force, displacement, and energy-controlled loadings and ensure {{a factor of}} safety against failure. However, stress-based <b>acceptance</b> <b>criteria</b> are often quite conservative for one time energy-limited events such as accidental drops and impacts. For several years, the ASME Working Group on Design of Division 3 Containments has been developing the Design Articles for Section III, Division 3, “Containments for Transportation and Storage of Spent Nuclear Fuel and High-Level Radioactive Material and Waste,” and has wanted to establish strain-based <b>acceptance</b> <b>criteria</b> for accidental drops of containments.

2500|$|ABC {{can be used}} {{to infer}} {{problems}} in high-dimensional parameter spaces, although one should account for the possibility of overfitting (e.g., see the model selection methods in [...] and [...] ). However, the probability of accepting the simulated values for the parameters under a given tolerance with the ABC rejection algorithm typically decreases exponentially with increasing dimensionality of the parameter space (due to the global <b>acceptance</b> <b>criterion).</b> Although no computational method (based on ABC or not) seems to be able to break the curse-of-dimensionality, methods have recently been developed to handle high-dimensional parameter spaces under certain assumptions (e.g., based on polynomial approximation on sparse grids, which could potentially heavily reduce the simulation times for ABC). However, the applicability of such methods is problem dependent, and the difficulty of exploring parameter spaces should in general not be underestimated. For example, the introduction of deterministic global parameter estimation led to reports that the global optima obtained in several previous studies of low-dimensional problems were incorrect. For certain problems, it might therefore be difficult to know whether the model is incorrect or, as discussed above, whether the explored region of the parameter space is inappropriate. A more pragmatic approach is to cut the scope of the problem through model reduction.|$|E

5000|$|Using the GEH Statistic avoids some pitfalls {{that occur}} when using simple {{percentages}} to compare {{two sets of}} volumes. This is because the traffic volumes in real-world transportation systems vary over a wide range. For example, the mainline of a freeway/motorway might carry 5000 vehicles per hour, while one of the on-ramps leading to the freeway might carry only 50 vehicles per hour (in that situation {{it would not be}} possible to select a single percentage of variation that is acceptable for both volumes). The GEH statistic reduces this problem; because the GEH statistic is non-linear, a single acceptance threshold based on GEH can be used over a fairly wide range of traffic volumes. The use of GEH as an <b>acceptance</b> <b>criterion</b> for travel demand forecasting models is recognised in the UK Highways Agency's Design Manual for Roads and Bridges [...] the Wisconsin microsimulation modeling guidelines, the Transport for London Traffic Modelling Guidelines [...] and other references.|$|E

40|$|Different {{approaches}} {{to determine the}} <b>acceptance</b> <b>criteria</b> for fatigue induced failure of structural systems and components are discussed and compared. The considered approaches take basis in either optimization (societal cost-benefit analysis) or are derived from past and actual practice or codes (revealed preferences).

Test-based decoding procedures employ simple algebraic tests conducted on candidate codewords, efficiently generated by low-complexity sub-optimal decoding strategies, and channel reliability measures.

40|$|A {{systematic}} approach to determining reliability-based <b>acceptance</b> <b>criteria</b> for deteriorating elements in structural systems is proposed, {{as a basis}} for calibration of safety factors in codes and standards and for verifying acceptability of inspection and maintenance strategies for specific structures.
