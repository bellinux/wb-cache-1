5|$|All welding of {{tantalum}} {{must be done}} in an {{inert atmosphere}} of argon or helium in order to shield it from contamination with <b>atmospheric</b> <b>gases.</b> Tantalum is not solderable. Grinding tantalum is difficult, especially so for annealed tantalum. In the annealed condition, tantalum is extremely ductile and can be readily formed as metal sheets.|$|E
5|$|All welding of {{titanium}} {{must be done}} in an {{inert atmosphere}} of argon or helium to shield it from contamination with <b>atmospheric</b> <b>gases</b> (oxygen, nitrogen, and hydrogen). Contamination causes a variety of conditions, such as embrittlement, which reduces {{the integrity of the}} assembly welds and leads to joint failure.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} welding {{processes}} such as gas metal arc welding, shielding gases are necessary in GTAW to protect the welding area from <b>atmospheric</b> <b>gases</b> such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they {{come in contact with}} the electrode, the arc, or the welding metal. The gas also transfers heat from the tungsten electrode to the metal, and it helps start and maintain a stable arc.|$|E

40|$|The {{amount of}} gas {{imparted}} {{to the atmosphere}} by an interaction of an impactor with a planet is estimated. The interaction of an impactor with a planet is described. The enthalpy of the gas, the kinetic energy of mass motion, and the evaporation of the impactor are examined. The properties of the shock-heated gas are calculated and analyzed. It is observed that the mass of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>gas</b> driven off into space by an impact {{is proportional to the}} mass of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>gas</b> encountered by the impactor...|$|R
5|$|The average {{salinity}} of Earth's oceans {{is about}} 35grams of salt per kilogram of sea water (3.5% salt). Most of this salt {{was released from}} volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks. The oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved <b>atmospheric</b> <b>gases,</b> which are essential {{for the survival of}} many aquatic life forms. Sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large heat reservoir. Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation.|$|E
5|$|Ecologists {{study and}} measure {{nutrient}} budgets {{to understand how}} these materials are regulated, flow, and recycled through the environment. This research {{has led to an}} understanding that there is global feedback between ecosystems and the physical parameters of this planet, including minerals, soil, pH, ions, water, and <b>atmospheric</b> <b>gases.</b> Six major elements (hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus; H, C, N, O, S, and P) form the constitution of all biological macromolecules and feed into the Earth's geochemical processes. From the smallest scale of biology, the combined effect of billions upon billions of ecological processes amplify and ultimately regulate the biogeochemical cycles of the Earth. Understanding the relations and cycles mediated between these elements and their ecological pathways has significant bearing toward understanding global biogeochemistry.|$|E
5|$|Glacier National Park has {{a highly}} {{regarded}} global climate change research program. Based in West Glacier, with the main headquarters in Bozeman, Montana, the U.S. Geological Survey has performed scientific research on specific climate change studies since 1992. In addition {{to the study of}} the retreating glaciers, research performed includes forest modeling studies in which fire ecology and habitat alterations are analyzed. Additionally, changes in alpine vegetation patterns are documented, watershed studies in which stream flow rates and temperatures are recorded frequently at fixed gauging stations, and atmospheric research in which UV-B radiation, ozone and other <b>atmospheric</b> <b>gases</b> are analyzed over time. The research compiled contributes to a broader understanding of climate changes in the park. The data collected, when compared to other facilities scattered around the world, help to correlate these climatic changes on a global scale.|$|E

30|$|Herein, {{we report}} a facile way for meso-SAPO- 11 {{fabrication}} by citric acid (CA) modification and further employ it as additive into the typical FCC catalyst for catalytic activity evaluation with <b>atmospheric</b> <b>gas</b> oil (AGO) and Coking gas oil (CGO).|$|R
5|$|Shielding gases are {{necessary}} for {{gas metal arc welding}} to protect the welding area from <b>atmospheric</b> <b>gases</b> such as nitrogen and oxygen, which can cause fusion defects, porosity, and weld metal embrittlement if they come in contact with the electrode, the arc, or the welding metal. This problem is common to all arc welding processes; for example, in the older Shielded-Metal Arc Welding process (SMAW), the electrode is coated with a solid flux which evolves a protective cloud of carbon dioxide when melted by the arc. In GMAW, however, the electrode wire does not have a flux coating, and a separate shielding gas is employed to protect the weld. This eliminates slag, the hard residue from the flux that builds up after welding and must be chipped off to reveal the completed weld.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century the idea that plants could {{synthesise}} almost all their tissues from <b>atmospheric</b> <b>gases</b> had not yet emerged. The energy component of photosynthesis, the capture and storage of the Sun's radiant energy in carbon bonds (a process on which all life depends) was first elucidated in 1847 by Mayer, but the details of how this was done would take many more years. Chlorophyll was named in 1818 and its chemistry gradually determined, to be finally resolved in the early 20th century. The mechanism of photosynthesis remained a mystery until the mid-19th century when Sachs, in 1862, noted that starch was formed in green cells only in the presence of light and in 1882 he confirmed carbohydrates as the starting point for all other organic compounds in plants. The connection between the pigment chlorophyll and starch production was finally made in 1864 but tracing the precise biochemical pathway of starch formation did not begin until about 1915.|$|E

50|$|Amplified {{piezoelectric}} actuators have {{no sliding}} parts {{due to the}} flexural hinges and do not require lubrication. Lubrication-free performance is important for cryogenics, where traditional lubricants may freeze, and for vacuum applications, where lubricants could outgas or trap <b>atmospheric</b> <b>gasses.</b>|$|R

25|$|Naturally {{occurring}} {{sources of}} human exposure include volcanic ash, weathering of minerals and ores, and mineralized groundwater. Arsenic {{is also found}} in food, water, soil, and air. Arsenic is absorbed by all plants, but is more concentrated in leafy vegetables, rice, apple and grape juice, and seafood. An additional route of exposure is inhalation of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>gases</b> and dusts.|$|E
25|$|Unbeknownst to her crew, {{the orbiter}} had {{suffered}} critical damage during its launch on January 16, when foam from the fuel tank's insulation fell off and tore {{a hole in}} Columbia's left wing. During re-entry, the hole allowed super-hot <b>atmospheric</b> <b>gases</b> to penetrate the orbiter's wing, leading to its destruction. The mission's duration was 15 days, 22 hours, and 20 minutes.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to reduce the {{decompression}} problems resulting from the high partial pressures of nitrogen the diver is exposed to when breathing air at depth, oxygen may be added as a substitute for some of the nitrogen. The resulting mixture of nitrogen and oxygen is known as nitrox. The traces of argon and other <b>atmospheric</b> <b>gases</b> are considered to be unimportant.|$|E
50|$|The <b>atmospheric</b> <b>gas</b> {{engine was}} in turn {{replaced}} by Otto's four-stroke engine. The changeover to four-stroke engines was remarkably rapid, {{with the last}} atmospheric engines being made in 1877. Liquid-fuelled engines soon followed using diesel (around 1898) or gasoline (petrol) (around 1900).|$|R
50|$|Technically, {{the word}} {{propellant}} {{is the general}} name for chemicals used to create thrust. For vehicles, the term propellant refers only to chemicals that are stored within the vehicle prior to use, and excludes <b>atmospheric</b> <b>gas</b> or other material that may be collected in operation.|$|R

25|$|Mercury {{has a very}} tenuous {{and highly}} {{variable}} atmosphere (surface-bound exosphere) containing hydrogen, helium, oxygen, sodium, calcium, potassium and water vapor, with a combined pressure level of about 10−14 bar (1 nPa). The exospheric species originate either from the Solar wind or from the planetary crust. Solar light pushes the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>gases</b> away from the Sun, creating a comet-like tail behind the planet.|$|E
25|$|Water vapor is a {{by-product}} of respiration in plants and animals. Its contribution to the pressure, increases as its concentration increases. Its partial pressure contribution to air pressure increases, lowering the partial pressure contribution of the other <b>atmospheric</b> <b>gases</b> (Dalton's Law). The total air pressure must remain constant. The presence of water vapor in the air naturally dilutes or displaces the other air components as its concentration increases.|$|E
25|$|Atmospheric {{pressure}} {{is caused by}} the gravitational attraction of the planet on the <b>atmospheric</b> <b>gases</b> above the surface, and {{is a function of the}} mass of the planet, the radius of the surface, and the amount of gas and its vertical distribution in the atmosphere. It is modified by the planetary rotation and local effects such as wind velocity, density variations due to temperature and variations in composition.|$|E
5000|$|Both internationally {{and within}} the People's Republic of China, {{there has been an}} ongoing debate over China's responsibilities, {{particularly}} since 2006, when China surpassed the US as the country with the highest emissions rate for the main <b>atmospheric</b> <b>gas</b> in global warming, carbon dioxide (CO2) ...|$|R

25|$|Since CFC {{molecules}} are {{heavier than}} air (nitrogen or oxygen), {{it is commonly}} believed that the CFC molecules cannot reach the stratosphere in significant amount. However, <b>atmospheric</b> <b>gases</b> are not sorted by weight; the forces of wind can fully mix the gases in the atmosphere. Lighter CFCs are evenly distributed throughout the turbosphere and reach the upper atmosphere, {{although some of the}} heavier CFCs are not evenly distributed.|$|E
25|$|The tropics take a {{major role}} in {{reducing}} atmospheric carbon dioxide. The tropics (most notably the Amazon rainforest) are called carbon sinks. As major carbon reducers and carbon and soil methane storages, their destruction contributes to increasing global energy trapping, <b>atmospheric</b> <b>gases.</b> Climate change has been significantly contributed to by the destruction of the rainforests. A simulation was performed in which all rainforest in Africa were removed. The simulation showed an increase in atmospheric temperature by 2.5 to 5 degrees Celsius.|$|E
25|$|The weak {{absorption}} of radio waves by the medium through which it passes is what enables radar sets to detect objects at relatively long ranges—ranges at which other electromagnetic wavelengths, such as visible light, infrared light, and ultraviolet light, are too strongly attenuated. Such weather phenomena as fog, clouds, rain, falling snow, and sleet that block visible light are usually transparent to radio waves. Certain radio frequencies that are absorbed or scattered by water vapour, raindrops, or <b>atmospheric</b> <b>gases</b> (especially oxygen) are avoided in designing radars, except when their detection is intended.|$|E
50|$|In a variable-volume balloon, {{the volume}} of the lifting gas changes due to heating and cooling in the diurnal cycle. The cycle is {{magnified}} by a greenhouse effect inside the balloon, while the surrounding <b>atmospheric</b> <b>gas</b> is subject to a much more limited cyclical temperature change. As the lift gas heats and expands, the displacement of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>gas</b> increases, while the balloon weight remains constant. Its buoyancy increases, and this leads to a rise in altitude unless it is compensated by venting gas. Conversely, if the balloon cools and drops, it becomes necessary to release ballast. Since both ballast and gas are finite, {{there is a limit to}} how long a variable-volume balloon can compensate in order to stabilize its altitude. In contrast, a superpressure balloon will change altitude much less without compensation maneuvers.|$|R
50|$|A book lung {{is a type}} of {{respiration}} organ {{used for}} <b>atmospheric</b> <b>gas</b> exchange that is found in many arachnids, such as scorpions and spiders. Each of these organs is found inside an open ventral abdominal, air-filled cavity (atrium) and connects with the surroundings through a small opening for the purpose of respiration.|$|R
30|$|Typically, {{the quality}} of service offered over a DVB-S 2 channel is subject to tropospheric phenomena, such as rain and clouds, {{as well as the}} {{influence}} of <b>atmospheric</b> <b>gas.</b> Both can severely degrade {{the quality of}} the transmission channel. These effects can have an influence on the long-term distribution of the channel attenuation statistics.|$|R
