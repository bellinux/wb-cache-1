25|$|The WCML was not {{originally}} {{conceived as}} a single trunk route, but was a number of separate lines built by different companies between the 1830s and the 1880s. After {{the completion of the}} successful Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1830, schemes were mooted to build more inter-city lines. The business practice of the early railway era was for companies to promote individual lines between two destinations, rather than to plan grand networks of lines, as it was easier to obtain backing from investors. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> how {{the early stages of the}} WCML evolved.|$|E
500|$|Article 13 of the Covenant {{recognises}} {{the right}} of everyone to free education (free for the primary level and [...] "the progressive introduction of free education" [...] for the secondary and higher levels).

2500|$|The Jacobi {{identity}} holds if {{and only}} if , <b>and</b> <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a necessary and sufficient condition for an anticommutative nonassociative algebra L to be a Lie algebra.

2500|$|Although reviewers {{have read}} {{political}} intonations into the album's ostensible themes, deeming it “unashamedly prog in its ambition and dimensions”, Turner {{is reluctant to}} admit to such an agenda. [...] "I'd hesitate to call the record 'political' because Isis has never taken a public political stand on anything. At the same time, it's intended to draw a parallel between the system that Bentham created and what's {{going on in the}} world right now". Likewise, he notes that the album is “absolutely not about a political agenda. I always try to write about stuff that is specific to my life during the time I write an album. And I try to find things that I'm emotionally and intellectually attached to. We've never been a political band. But right now politics are such a great importance. You can travel everywhere and you simply cannot ignore them. <b>And</b> <b>so</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> one of the main things that have been occupying my mind during the creation of this record. So beyond these things just being interesting themselves they have a lot of relevance to what's {{going on in the world}} right now [...] I think these things are relevant to everybody's lives and specifically to me and this band and what we experienced through living in this country over the last couple of years. And also I think my lyrics are so abstract and fragmented sometimes that I feel like those things are a better representation of what I'm writing about than printed lyrics might be.” Despite his denial that Panopticon is politically motivated, Turner does refer to the then-incumbent George W. Bush administration's tenure as a source of inspiration; about how Bentham's essay bore relevance to “hit home in terms of how [...] is treating its own citizens outside and within the country.” ...|$|E
