500|$|Stafford was {{admired by}} critics and the {{listening}} {{public for the}} purity of her voice, and {{was considered one of}} the most versatile vocalists of her era. Peter Levinson said that she was a coloratura soprano, whose operatic training allowed her to sing a natural falsetto. Her style encompassed a number of genres, including big band, ballads, jazz, folk and comedy. The music critic Terry Teachout described her as [...] "rhythmically fluid without ever sounding self-consciously 'jazzy' [...] ", while Rosemary Clooney said of her, [...] "The voice says it all: beautiful, pure, straightforward, no artifice, matchless intonation, instantly recognizable. Those things describe the woman too." [...] Writing for the New York Sun, Will Friedwald described her 1947 interpretation of [...] "Haunted Heart" [...] as [...] "effective because it's so subtle, because Stafford holds something back and doesn't shove her emotion in the listener's face." [...] Nancy Franklin described Stafford's version of the folk song [...] "He's Gone Away" [...] as [...] "wistful and tender, as if she had picked up <b>a</b> <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>clothing</b> once worn by a loved one and begun singing." [...] Frank Sinatra said, [...] "It was a joy to sit on the bandstand and listen to her". The singer Judy Collins has cited Stafford's folk recordings as an influence on her own musical career. The country singer Patsy Cline was also inspired by Stafford's work.|$|E
