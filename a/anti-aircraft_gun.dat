5|$|The Oerlikon 20 mm <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>gun,</b> one of {{the most}} heavily {{produced}} anti-aircraft guns of the Second World War, entered service in 1941, and replaced the /90 M2 Browning MG on a one-for-one basis. Between December 1941 and September 1944, 32% of all Japanese aircraft downed were credited to this weapon, with the high point being 48.3% for the second half of 1942; however, the 20mm guns were found to be ineffective against the Japanese Kamikaze attacks used during the latter half of World War II and were subsequently phased out in favor of the heavier Bofors 40 mm <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>gun.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1924 {{two of her}} 3in/40 {{guns were}} removed, as were all of her QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns, and a single 8cm/40 3rd Year Type <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>gun</b> was added. By August 1933, all ten of her casemated 6-inch guns had been removed in {{addition}} to four more 3in/40 guns.|$|E

5|$|A United States Army Armored Force {{requirement}} for a mobile <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>gun</b> {{to support the}} coming North African Campaign resulted in the T28 project being revived soon after its cancellation. The new vehicles used the larger M3 Halftrack chassis and an M2E1 sight for target spotting, receiving the designation T28E1 Combination Gun Motor Carriage (CGMC).|$|E
5|$|Indefatigable {{received}} a single QF 3-inch 20 cwt <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>gun</b> on a high-angle Mark II mount in March 1915. It was provided with 500 rounds. All of her 4-inch guns were enclosed in casemates and given gun shields during a refit in November 1915 to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action, although two aft guns were removed {{at the same}} time.|$|E
5|$|South & South-East: The 2nd Division, {{with support}} from one {{artillery}} unit (the 36th Artillery Regiment), one artillery battalion, one tank-armoured vehicles battalion, one <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>gun</b> battalion, and one anti-tank weapons company, were ordered to take Da Nang Air Base and the ARVN 1st Brigade Headquarters, then capture the city itself.

5|$|In 1979, due {{to issues}} {{caused by the}} transmission, the French Army began to {{modernize}} its fleet of tanks to AMX-30B2 standards, which included a new transmission, an improved engine {{and the introduction of}} a new fin-stabilized kinetic energy penetrator. Production of the AMX-30 also extended to a number of variants, including the AMX-30D armored recovery vehicle, the AMX-30R <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>gun</b> system, a bridge-layer, the Pluton tactical nuclear missile launcher and a surface-to-air missile launcher.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the museum}} building, an ex-Iraqi Army T-55 tank {{was put on}} display at the main {{entrance}} in August 2008. This vehicle was captured by the Royal Engineers during the opening stages of the Iraq War in 2003. The spot had previously been occupied by an Iraqi ZSU-23-4 Shilka <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>gun.</b> Captured by the Royal Artillery after the 1991 Gulf War, it was moved from Imperial War Museum Duxford and displayed to mark the museum's fifth anniversary in July 2007.|$|E
50|$|Nevertheless, the ship's {{armament}} {{was again}} revised after leaving Italian service, this time consisting of six 8.4 cm <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>guns,</b> four 4.7 cm <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>guns,</b> four 20 mm Oerlikon <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>guns,</b> and twenty-six 20 mm Breda <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>guns,</b> {{and she was}} commissioned on 8 November.

50|$|<b>Anti-aircraft</b> <b>guns</b> {{are usually}} mounted in a quickly-traversing turret {{with a high}} rate of elevation, for {{tracking}} fast-moving aircraft. They are often in dual or quadruple mounts, allowing {{a high rate of}} fire. Today, missiles (generally mounted on similar turrets) have largely supplanted <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>guns.</b>|$|R
5|$|Steiner was {{not present}} during the bombing, but at a command bunker in Franceville-Plage. After the raid, he {{set out for the}} battery, but was unable to gain entry due to the volume of fire from the British paratroopers. At the same time, a {{reconnaissance}} patrol from an army Flak unit with a half-track mounting a large <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>gun</b> arrived. The crew had intended to seek cover at the position, but instead used the gun to engage the paratroopers.|$|E
5|$|The Oerlikon 20 mm <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>gun</b> {{was one of}} {{the most}} heavily {{produced}} anti-aircraft guns of the Second World War; the US alone manufactured a total of 124,735 of these guns. When activated in 1941 these guns replaced the 0.50"/90 (12.7mm) M2 Browning MG on a one-for-one basis. The Oerlikon 20mm AA gun remained the primary anti-aircraft weapon of the United States Navy until the introduction of the 40mm Bofors AA gun in 1943.|$|E
5|$|A Type 271 surface {{search radar}} {{replaced}} the fire-control director and rangefinder above the bridge. A Type 290 surface warning radar was added {{at the top}} of the foremast. A High frequency direction finding system was added on a pole mast aft. The ship also received a Type 242 IFF system. Two 4.7-inch guns were removed, one each forward and aft, and the forward gun was replaced by a Hedgehog anti-submarine spigot mortar. The 3-inch <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>gun</b> amidships was also removed, but the number of 20mm AA guns was increased to six.|$|E

5|$|Fonda was {{a visible}} {{political}} activist in the counterculture era during the Vietnam War {{and later became}} involved in advocacy for women. She was famously and controversially photographed sitting on an <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>gun</b> on a 1972 visit to Hanoi. She has also protested the Iraq War and violence against women, and describes herself as a feminist. In 2005, she, Robin Morgan and Gloria Steinem co-founded the Women's Media Center, an organization that works to amplify the voices {{of women in the}} media through advocacy, media and leadership training, and the creation of original content. Fonda serves {{on the board of the}} organization.|$|E
5|$|Kress von Kressenstein's Fourth Army {{was made}} up of the 3rd (Anatolian) Infantry Division's three regiments, the 31st, 32nd and 39th Infantry Regiments, totalling 16,000 men, of whom 11,000 to 11,873 were combatants, Arab {{ancillary}} forces; and one regiment of the Camel Corps. Estimates of their arms range from 3,293 to 12,000 rifles, 38 to 56 machine guns, and two to five <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>gun</b> sections; they also fielded four heavy artillery and mountain gun batteries (30 artillery pieces) and the Pasha I formation. Nearly 5,000 camels and 1,750 horses accompanied the advance.|$|E
5|$|On 1 November 1944 a United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) F-13 Superfortress {{conducted}} {{the first flight}} by an Allied aircraft over the Tokyo region of Japan since the Doolittle Raid in April 1942. This photo reconnaissance sortie was highly successful, with the aircraft's crew taking thousands of photographs which were later used to plan many air raids on Japan during the final months of World War II. Attempts by Japanese air units and <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>gun</b> batteries to destroy the F-13 failed, as the available fighter aircraft and guns could not reach the high altitude it operated at.|$|E

5|$|The Commandos {{were divided}} into three groups: One and Two would travel in the MLs, while Three would be in Campbeltown. Under the command of Captain Hodgeson, Group One had the {{objectives}} of securing the Old Mole and eliminating the <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>gun</b> positions around the southern quays. They were then {{to move into the}} old town and blow up the power station, bridges and locks for the new entrance into the basin from the Avant port. The capture of the mole was a major objective, as it was to be the embarkation point for the evacuation after the mission.|$|E
5|$|In September 1940, Parsons and Merle Tuve of NDRC {{began work}} on a new concept. Shooting down an {{aircraft}} with an <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>gun</b> was a difficult proposition. As a shell had to hit a speeding aircraft at an uncertain altitude, the only hope seemed to be to fill the sky with ammunition. A direct hit was not actually required; an aircraft might be destroyed or critically damaged by a shell detonating nearby. With this in mind, anti-aircraft gunners used time fuzes to increase the possibility of damage. The question then arose as to whether radar {{could be used to}} create an explosion in the proximity of an aircraft. Tuve's first suggestion was to have an aircraft drop a radar-controlled bomb on a bomber formation. Parsons saw that while this was technically feasible, it was tactically problematic.|$|E
5|$|On {{the next}} day, Grodno was finally cleared of Polish troops. The 27th Brigade had lost two burned and 12 damaged BT-7 light tanks in the battle, some to Molotov cocktails thrown by the {{defenders}} from attics and trenches, and its casualties totaled 19 killed and 26 wounded. The 20th Brigade lost a BA-10 to Molotov cocktails, suffering casualties of 3 killed and 20 wounded. The 16th Rifle Corps' motorized detachment lost 25 killed, 110 wounded, and a burned tank. During the battle, the corps killed 320 officers, 20 non-commissioned officers, and 194 soldiers, {{many of whom}} were crushed by tanks {{in the eastern part of}} the city. Between 20 and 21 September, they had captured 38 Polish officers, 20 non-commissioned officers, and 1,477 enlisted men, as well as 514 rifles, 146 machine guns, a mortar, and an <b>anti-aircraft</b> <b>gun.</b>|$|E
