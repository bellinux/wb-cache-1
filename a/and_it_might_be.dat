500|$|Monotype Bembo {{is one of}} {{the most}} famous revivals of the Aldine {{typeface}} of 1495. It was created under the influence of Monotype executive and printing historian Stanley Morison by the design team at the Monotype factory in Salfords, Surrey, south of London. While most printers of the Arts and Crafts movement of the previous sixty years had been more interested in the slightly earlier typefaces of Nicolas Jenson, Morison greatly admired Aldus Manutius' typeface above others of the period. The main reasons for his admiration were the balance of the letter construction, such as the evenness of the 'e' with a level cross-stroke and the way the capitals were made slightly lower than the ascenders of the tallest lower-case letters. He described the Aldine roman as [...] "inspired not by writing, but by engraving; not script but sculpture." [...] His friend printer Giovanni Mardersteig similarly suggested the appeal of the Aldine face in his commentary that [...] "Griffo...rid himself of the influence of the characteristic round forms of letters written with a pen; he developed instead a more narrow <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> said a more modern form, which was better suited to ...whereas Jenson's style made a strong appeal to the sense of beauty prevalent in the period of Art Nouveau, today our taste in architecture and typography inclines towards simpler and more disciplined forms." ...|$|E
500|$|Nine demos were {{recorded}} at The Mill studio in September 2003 by Paul McCartney and his touring band.

However, the sessions were cut short and put on hiatus when McCartney started another album, Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, with producer Nigel Godrich. In the website constructed for the album, McCartney stated: [...] "I actually started this album, Memory Almost Full, before my last album Chaos and Creation in the Backyard, released September 2005. (...) When I was just finishing up everything concerned with Chaos and had just got the Grammy nominations (2006) I realised I had this album {{to go back to}} and finish off. So I got it out to listen to it again, wondering if I would enjoy it, but actually I really loved it. All I did at first was just listen to a couple of things and then I began to think, 'OK, I like that track– now, what is wrong with it?' <b>And</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> something like a drum sound, so then I would re-drum and see where we would get to. (...) In places it's a very personal record {{and a lot of it}} is retrospective, drawing from memory, like memories from being a kid, from Liverpool and from summers gone. The album is evocative, emotional, rocking, but I can't really sum it up in one sentence".|$|E

2500|$|Just as importantly, {{horizontally}} transferred segments need {{to exhibit}} the donor's genomic signature. This {{might not be}} the case for ancient transfers where transferred sequences are subjected to the same mutational processes {{as the rest of the}} host genome, potentially causing their distinct signatures to [...] "ameliorate" [...] and become undetectable through parametric methods. For example, Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus, a predatory δ-Proteobacterium, has homogeneous GC content, <b>and</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> concluded that its genome is resistant to HGT. However, subsequent analysis using phylogenetic methods identified a number of ancient HGT events in the genome of B. bacteriovorus. Similarly, if the inserted segment was previously ameliorated to the host's genome, as is the case for prophage insertions, parametric methods might miss predicting these HGT events. Also, the donor's composition must significantly differ from the recipient's to be identified as abnormal, a condition that might be missed in the case of short- to medium-distance HGT, which are the most prevalent. Furthermore, it has been reported that recently acquired genes tend to be AT-richer than the recipient's average, which indicates that differences in GC-content signature may result from unknown post-acquisition mutational processes rather than from the donor's genome.|$|E
