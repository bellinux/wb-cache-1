50|$|The Humidity Sounder for Brazil (HSB) was an {{instrument}} launched on NASA's Earth Observing System satellite Aqua launched in May 2002. It was a four-channel passive microwave radiometer, with one channel at 150 GHz and three channels at 183 GHz. It {{was very similar}} in design to the AMSU-B instrument, except it lacked the 89 GHz surface sounding channel. It was intended to study profiles of atmospheric water vapor and provide improved input data to the cloud-clearing algorithms in the Unified AIRS Retrieval Suite, but the scan mirror motor failed on February 5, 2003. It worked with the <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Infrared</b> <b>Sounder</b> and AMSU-A to form the AIRS Sounding Suite.|$|E

50|$|The OCO {{spacecraft}} {{was provided}} by Orbital Sciences Corporation. During its two-year mission, OCO will fly in a near polar orbit which enables the instrument to observe most of Earth's surface at least once every sixteen days. It is intended to fly in loose formation {{with a series of}} other Earth-orbiting satellites known as the Earth Observing System Afternoon Constellation, or the A-train. This coordinated flight formation was intended to enable researchers to correlate OCO data with data acquired by other instruments on other spacecraft. In particular, Earth scientists would like to compare OCO data with nearly simultaneous measurements acquired by the <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Infrared</b> <b>Sounder</b> (AIRS) instrument aboard NASA's Aqua satellite and ground-based data from the Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON). Alignment with the A-train demands a particularly short launch window of 30 seconds.|$|E
50|$|The {{study of}} {{supersaturation}} is also relevant to atmospheric studies. Since the 1940s, {{the presence of}} supersaturation in the atmosphere has been known. When water is supersaturated in the troposphere, the formation of ice lattices is frequently observed. In a state of saturation, the water particles will not form ice under tropospheric conditions. It {{is not enough for}} molecules of water to form an ice lattice at saturation pressures; they require a surface to condense on to or conglomerations of liquid water molecules of water to freeze. For these reasons, relative humidities over ice in the atmosphere can be found above 100%, meaning supersaturation as occurred. Supersaturation of water is actually very common in the upper troposphere, occurring between 20% and 40% of the time. This can be determined using satellite data from the <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Infrared</b> <b>Sounder.</b> Evidence of supersaturation in the troposphere {{can be seen in the}} contrails of airplanes and rocket ships, which need to reach a humidity above that of ice saturation in order to form.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a physical-based methodology for the retrieval of geophysical parameters (temperature, water vapor and ozone) from highly resolved infrared radiance, and presents the algorithm which implements the procedure. The algorithm we have implemented is mostly {{intended for the}} <b>Infrared</b> <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Sounding</b> Interferometer which is planned to be flown on the first European Meteorological Operational Satellite (Metop/ 1) in 2006. Nevertheless, with minor modifications, the code is well suited for any nadir viewing satellite and airborne infrared sensor with a sampling rate {{in the range of}} 0. 1 – 2 cm− 1. Basically, the implementation of the inverse scheme follows Rodgers' Statistical Regularization method. However, an additional regularization parameter is introduced in the inverse scheme which gains to the algorithm the capability of improving the retrieval accuracy and to constraint the step size of Newton updates in such a way to lead iterates toward the feasible region of the inverse solution. Although, the paper mostly focuses on documenting and discussing the mathematical details of the inverse method, retrieval exercises have been provided, which exemplify the use and potential performance of the method. These retrieval exercises have been performed for the <b>Infrared</b> <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Sounding</b> Interferometer.

40|$|Abstract. Atmospheric {{thermodynamic}} parameters, such as {{atmospheric temperature}} and moisture profiles, cloud opti-cal/microphysical properties, and surface properties are ba-sic meteorological variables for weather forecasting.

40|$|Since May 2009 {{high-resolution}} Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) {{solar absorption}} spectra are recorded at Addis Ababa (9. 01 ° N latitude, 38. 76 ° E longitude, 2443 m altitude a. s. l.), Ethiopia. The vertical profiles and total column amounts of ozone (O 3) are deduced from the spectra {{by using the}} retrieval code PROFFIT (V 9. 5) and regularly determined instrumental line shape (ILS). A detailed error analysis of the O 3 retrieval is performed. Averaging kernels analysis of the target gas shows that the major contribution to the retrieved information always comes from the measurement. We obtained 2. 1 degrees of freedom on average for signals in the retrieval of O 3 from the observed FTIR spectra. We have compared the FTIR retrieval of ozone Volume Mixing Ratio (VMR) profiles and column amounts with the coincident satellite observations of Microwave Limb Sounding (MLS), Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) and Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES), Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI), <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Infrared</b> <b>Sounding</b> (AIRS) and Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME- 2) instrument. The mean relative differences are generally found below + 15 % in the altitude range of 27 to 36 km for comparison of VMR profiles made between MLS and MIPAS, whereas comparison with TES has shown below 9. 4 % relative difference. Furthermore, the mean relative difference is positive above 31 km, suggesting positive bias in the FTIR measurement of O 3 VMR with respect to MLS, MIPAS and TES. The overall comparisons of column amounts of satellite measurements with the ground-based FTIR instruments show better agreement exhibiting mean relative differences of ground-based FTIR with respect to MLS and GOME- 2 within + 0. 4 % to + 4. 0 % and corresponding standard deviations of 2. 2 to 4. 3 % whereas, {{in the case of}} OMI, TES, AIRS, the mean relative differences are from − 0. 38 to − 6. 8 %.

40|$|The {{technique}} of partially scanned interferograms {{is applied to}} the retrieval of trace gases from <b>Infrared</b> <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Sounding</b> Interferometer (IASI) observations. For the specific case of CO, CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O, we show that this methodology allows us to retrieve trace gases column abundances at an unprecedented accuracy {{at the level of the}} single IASI footprint. The technique consists in transforming the IASI spectra back to the interferogram domain where we identify small regions that are mostly sensitive to single gas species. The retrieval is then performed by directly applying Least Squares estimation to these small segments of interferometric radiances. One of the main advantages of the technique is that it allows the efficient use of the information contained in all the IASI channels that are available in the absorption bands of a specific gas species. The retrieval technique has been applied to IASI radiances measured over the Mediterranean sea during the month of July 2010, one of the hottest months on record. Results have been validated against ground-based measurements. We have also carried out a comparison with <b>Atmospheric</b> <b>Infrared</b> Radiometer Sounder data and IASI retrievals obtained with usual variational approaches in the spectral domain...|$|R
