The cause {{which has}} now been {{assigned}} for the rotation in Arago's experiment, namely, the production of electrical currents, seems abundantly sufficient in all cases where the metals, or perhaps even other conductors, are concerned; but with regard to such bodies as glass, resins, and, above all, gases, it seems impossible that currents of electricity, capable of producing these effects, should be generated in them. Yet Arago found that the effects in question were produced by these and by all bodies tried (81.). Messrs. Babbage and Herschel, it is true, did not observe them with any substance not metallic, except carbon, in a highly conducting state (82.). Mr. Harris has ascertained their occurrence with wood, marble, freestone and <b>annealed</b> <b>glass,</b> but obtained no effect with sulphuric acid and saturated solution of sulphate of iron, although these are better conductors of electricity than the former substances.|$|E
50|$|Chemically {{strengthened}} {{glass is}} a type of glass that has increased strength. When broken it still shatters in long pointed splinters similar to float (<b>annealed)</b> <b>glass.</b> For this reason, it is not considered a safety glass and must be laminated if a safety glass is required. Chemically strengthened glass is typically six to eight times the strength of <b>annealed</b> <b>glass.</b>|$|E

This allows the glass {{to be used to}} create various ornaments and to create an aged glass patina.|$|E
50|$|The {{tempering}} process {{does not change}} the stiffness of the glass. <b>Annealed</b> <b>glass</b> undergoes a similar deflection compared to tempered glass under the same load, but tempered glass can take a higher load and, therefore, deflects further before breaking.|$|E
50|$|<b>Annealed</b> <b>glass,</b> heat-strengthened or {{tempered}} glass {{can be used}} to produce laminated glass.

50|$|<b>Annealed</b> <b>glass</b> is glass without {{internal}} stresses caused by heat treatment, i.e., rapid cooling, or by toughening or heat strengthening. Glass becomes annealed {{if it is}} heated above a transition point then allowed to cool slowly, without being quenched. Float glass is annealed {{during the process of}} manufacture.

5000|$|Mentioned in the {{publication}} of the Royal Society around 1740s, the Bologna bottle is named for where it was first discovered in Bologna, Italy. During this period, a glassblower would create a Bologna bottle by leaving the bottle in the open air instead of immediately placing the bottle back into the furnace to cool (<b>Annealing</b> (<b>glass)).</b> This produced a special phenomenon, where the bottle would remain intact even when dropped from a distance onto the brick floor, but would immediately rupture if a small piece of flint were placed inside.|$|R

50|$|It is this {{compressive}} stress {{that gives the}} toughened glass increased strength. This is because <b>annealed</b> <b>glass,</b> which has almost no internal stress, usually forms microscopic surface cracks, and any applied tension gets magnified at the surface, reducing the applied tension needed to propagate the crack. Once it starts propagating, tension gets magnified even more easily, causing it to propagate {{at the speed of}} sound in the material.|$|E
50|$|A {{glass cutter}} {{is a tool}} {{used to make a}} shallow score in one surface of a piece of glass that is to be broken in two pieces.

5000|$|Medieval {{glasshouse}} traditions {{continued in}} the Weald, which was becoming deforested by the early 17th century; local glassmaking spread elsewhere, where timber was available to fire furnaces, to Hampshire, Gloucestershire, North Staffordshire and the Scottish Borders. At Bagot's Park, Staffordshire, one such glasshouse has been recovered, which dates from circa 1535; it contained an early melting furnace and a smaller annealing furnace. [...] The melting furnace had two siege benches for the placement of three crucible pots, each with a central flue cut into the floor to create a draught {{that would allow the}} furnace to achieve 1200 °C in order to melt the glass. Fritting, and the preheating of crucibles may have occurred in the upper areas of the main furnace. <b>Annealing</b> (<b>glass)</b> and glass blowing probably occurred using a smaller furnace. Cullet heaps of broken glass residue were found on either side, suggesting the use of a flux to reduce melting temperatures. Some crushed white pebbles were recovered in the bottom of pots, and this may reflect the silica source used at this site. The glass recovered from Bagot's Park was badly weathered, yet the ends of broad glass and crown glass suggest that window and vessel glass were produced.|$|R
50|$|Toughened or {{tempered}} glass {{is a type}} of safety glass processed by controlled thermal or chemical treatments to increase its strength compared with normal glass. Tempering puts the outer surfaces into compression and the interior into tension. Such stresses cause the glass, when broken, to crumble into small granular chunks instead of splintering into jagged shards as plate glass (a.k.a. <b>annealed</b> <b>glass)</b> does. The granular chunks are less likely to cause injury.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{heat-treated}} glass: heat-strengthened and fully tempered. Heat-strengthened glass is twice as strong as annealed glass; while fully tempered glass typically has four to six times the strength of <b>annealed</b> <b>glass,</b> and withstands heating in microwave ovens. The difference is the residual stress in the edge and glass surface. Fully tempered glass in the US is generally rated above [...] in pressure-resistance, while heat-strengthened glass is between [...]|$|E
5000|$|Toughened {{glass is}} also used in {{buildings}} for unframed assemblies (such as frameless glass doors), structurally loaded applications, and any other application that would become dangerous {{in the event of}} human impact.

50|$|Over {{extended}} {{time periods}} thoriated glass may develop significant discoloration.

CaMgSi 2 O 6 (wt. %) on the properties of glasses and glass-ceramics were evaluated. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) examination of glasses revealed the precipitation of a nanosize droplet phase in the glassy matrices suggesting the occurrence of amorphous phase separation in all <b>annealed</b> <b>glasses.</b> An overall trend towards polymerization of the glass network with increasing albite content was demonstrated by employing MAS-NMR and FTIR spectroscopy. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential thermal analysis (DTA) were used to assess the effect of albite content on the devitrification process and formation of fluorapatite crystalline phase (Ca- 5 (PO 4) (3) F).
