50|$|In some {{solenoid valves}} the solenoid acts {{directly}} on the main valve. Others use a small, complete solenoid valve, known as a pilot, to actuate a larger valve.

Piloted valves require much less power to control, but they are noticeably slower. Piloted solenoids usually need full power at all times to open and stay open, where a direct acting solenoid may only need full power {{for a short period of}} time to open it, and only low power to hold it.|$|E

50|$|The Matrix uses a {{spool valve}} system to propel a paintball. The spool valve {{utilizes}} an airspace with a fixed volume and a regulated air source {{to deliver a}} consistent amount of force to each ball that is shot. The valve works {{in the matter of}} a spool that slides back and forth much like a piston. In one position the spool allows the fixed air chamber to be filled. In the firing position the spool moves forward and dumps the contents of the fixed air chamber into the breech of the marker, which in turn fires the paintball. The movement of the spool is controlled by the flow of air to it. This flow of air is controlled by a solenoid (electronically <b>actuated</b> <b>valve).</b> The Matrix has a sleek look and lacks external hoses that can become damaged over time. The gas is instead routed through passages inside the body of the marker and plugs in the front and rear of the marker keep these passages airtight. A low pressure regulator can also be attached {{to the front of the}} marker to help the consistency and help lower the force of the air hitting the ball.|$|E

40|$|The {{design and}} test results for {{two types of}} pulsed gas valves are presented. The valves, a piezo valve and a solenoid <b>actuated</b> <b>valve,</b> must have {{exceedingly}} long lifetime to support gas-fed pulsed electric thruster operation for missions of interest. The performance of both valves was tested, with both demonstrating the capability to throttle the gas flow rate while maintaining low leakage levels below 10 (exp - 3) sccs of He {{at the beginning of}} valve lifetime. The piezo valve varies the flow rate by changing the amount that the valve is open, which is a function of applied voltage. This valve demonstrated continuous throttlability from 0 - 10 mL/s, with opening and closing times of 100 microsecond or less. The solenoid <b>actuated</b> <b>valve</b> flow rate changes {{as a function of the}} inlet gas pressure, with demonstrated flow rates in these tests from 2. 7 - 11 mL per second. The valve response time is slower than the piezo valve, opening in 1 - 2 ms and closing in several ms. The solenoid <b>actuated</b> <b>valve</b> was tested to one million cycles, with the valve performance remaining relatively unchanged throughout the test. Galling of the sliding plunger caused the valve to bind and fail just after one million cycles, but at this point in the test the valve sealing surface leak rate still appeared to be well below the maximum target leak rake of 110 (exp - 3) sccs of He...|$|E
