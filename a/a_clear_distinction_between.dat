5|$|While most LARPs {{maintain}} <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> {{the real}} world and the fictional setting, pervasive LARPs mingle fiction with modern reality in a fashion similar to alternate reality games. Bystanders who are unaware that a game is taking place may be treated as part of the fictional setting, and in-character materials may be incorporated into {{the real world}}.|$|E
5|$|Jain texts make <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> the Sallekhana and suicide. Its dualistic {{theology}} differentiates between {{soul and}} matter. Soul is reborn in the Jain belief based on accumulated karma, how one dies {{contributes to the}} karma accumulation, and a pious death reduces the negative karmic attachments. The preparation for sallekhana must begin early, much before the approach of death, and when death is imminent, the vow of Sallekhana is observed by progressively slenderising {{the body and the}} passions.|$|E
5|$|When Peano {{formulated}} his axioms, {{the language}} of mathematical logic was in its infancy. The system of logical notation he created to present the axioms did not prove to be popular, although it was {{the genesis of the}} modern notation for set membership (∈, which comes from Peano's ε) and implication (⊃, which comes from Peano's reversed 'C'.) Peano maintained <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> mathematical and logical symbols, which was not yet common in mathematics; such a separation had first been introduced in the Begriffsschrift by Gottlob Frege, published in 1879. Peano was unaware of Frege's work and independently recreated his logical apparatus {{based on the work of}} Boole and Schröder.|$|E

5|$|Batman: The Ultimate Evil {{is a novel}} {{written by}} Andrew Vachss and {{published}} in 1995 by the Warner Aspect imprint of Warner Books. Vachss was an attorney specializing in child abuse cases, {{as well as a}} crime novelist best known for his series of books featuring the character Burke, a private investigator who also takes on child abuse cases. A representative from DC Comics approached Vachss about the possibility of writing a novel featuring Batman. Viewing {{this as an opportunity to}} reach a completely different audience, Vachss agreed and wrote a draft. He continued with his themes concerning child sexual abuse and explored the topic of child sex tourism. The publisher required Vachss to follow certain rules, like making <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> fiction and reality and prohibiting the Batman character from killing, cursing, or having sex.|$|E
5|$|The flaw in Dalton's {{theory was}} {{corrected}} in principle in 1811 by Amedeo Avogadro. Avogadro had proposed that equal volumes of any two gases, at equal temperature and pressure, contain {{equal numbers of}} molecules (in other words, the mass of a gas's particles {{does not affect the}} volume that it occupies). Avogadro's law allowed him to deduce the diatomic nature of numerous gases by studying the volumes at which they reacted. For instance: since two liters of hydrogen will react with just one liter of oxygen to produce two liters of water vapor (at constant pressure and temperature), it meant a single oxygen molecule splits in two in order to form two particles of water. Thus, Avogadro was able to offer more accurate estimates of the atomic mass of oxygen and various other elements, and made <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> molecules and atoms.|$|E
5|$|In 1667 Nicholas Steno wrote a {{paper about}} a shark head he had dissected. He {{compared}} {{the teeth of}} the shark with the common fossil objects known as tongue stones. He concluded that the fossils must have been shark teeth. Steno then took an interest in the question of fossils, and to address some of the objections to their organic origin he began studying rock strata. The result of this work was published in 1669 as Forerunner to a Dissertation on a solid naturally enclosed in a solid. In this book, Steno drew <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> objects such as rock crystals that really were formed within rocks and those such as fossil shells and shark teeth that were formed outside of those rocks. Steno realized that certain kinds of rock had been formed by the successive deposition of horizontal layers of sediment and that fossils were the remains of living organisms that had become buried in that sediment. Steno who, like almost all 17th century natural philosophers, believed that the earth was only a few thousand years old, resorted to the Biblical flood as a possible explanation for fossils of marine organisms that were far from the sea.|$|E

5000|$|At {{a speech}} at New York City Hall in 2001 Weiss criticized President George W. Bush for not making <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> Arab acts of {{terrorism}} and Israeli acts of self-defense. [...] "The trap that he's falling into is that he's drawn a moral equivalency between cold-blooded murder and acts of self-defense," [...] Weiss said.|$|R
30|$|In general, {{because of}} less surface {{sensitivity}} (and hence less influence of oxygen-containing contaminants) oxygen NEXAFS spectra offered <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> the surfactant and binder than the O 1 s XPS, which highlights a possible {{benefit of the}} technique. However, {{this needs to be}} balanced against the ease of accessing a lab based (XPS) vs. an exclusively synchrotron based (NEXAFS) technique.|$|R
25|$|Some authors do {{not make}} <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> {{algebraic}} sets and varieties and use irreducible variety to make the distinction when needed.|$|E
25|$|The close helmet was {{developed}} from the later versions of the sallet and the superficially similar armet in the late 15th century. In contemporary sources it was sometimes {{also referred to as}} an 'armet', though modern scholarship draws <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> the two types.|$|E
25|$|Although most of {{the texts}} in Écrits and Autres écrits {{are closely related to}} Lacan's lectures or lessons from his Seminar, more often than not the style is denser than Lacan's oral delivery, and <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> the {{writings}} and the transcriptions of the oral teaching is evident to the reader.|$|E
50|$|A third study design, the {{sequential}} design, combines both methodologies. Here, {{a researcher}} observes members of different birth cohorts {{at the same}} time, and then tracks all participants over time, charting changes in the groups. While much more resource-intensive, the format aids in <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> what changes {{can be attributed to}} individual or historical environment from those that are truly universal.|$|R
40|$|Measurement of the serum Lactobacillus casei (`folic-acid') {{activity}} {{is widely used}} as an index of folic-acid deficiency. Present methods of assay result in recovery of about half the active material in normal serum. A modified method of assay is described which gives higher L. casei values and <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> the sera of normal subjects and of patients with folic-acid deficiency...|$|R
50|$|The Gospel genre {{field was}} redefined to make <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> the {{traditional}} gospel {{music and the}} style known as Contemporary Christian Music (CCM). As mentioned above, the Best Roots Gospel Album category is new. The categories in the Gospel field will now be known as Best Gospel Performance/Song, Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song, Best Gospel Album, Best Contemporary Christian Music Album and Best Roots Gospel Album.|$|R
25|$|<b>A</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> glass {{making and}} glass working must be made. Glass making is the {{production}} of raw glass from the raw materials. Glass working {{on the other hand}} refers to the processing of raw glass or recycled glass to create new glass objects, although this may take place in the same location as glass making, it can also take place elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Although some {{consider}} that the distinction between transpersonal psychology and the psychology of religion, is fading (e.g. The Oxford Handbook of Psychology and Spirituality), there is still {{generally considered to be}} <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> the two. Much of the focus of psychology of religion is concerned with issues that wouldn't be considered 'transcendent' within transpersonal psychology, so the two disciplines do have quite a distinct focus.|$|E
25|$|Similar to his predecessors, Herodotus {{also made}} mistakes. He {{accepted}} <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> the civilized Greeks in {{the centre of}} the earth and the barbarians on the world's edges. In his Histories we can see very clearly that he believed that the world became stranger and stranger when one traveled away from Greece, until one reached the ends of the earth, where humans behaved as savages.|$|E
5000|$|Faced with {{a growing}} {{identity}} crisis and continually dwindling numbers, Wesleyan-Holiness Evangelicals have hosted several inter-denominational conferences and begun several initiatives to draw <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> Wesleyan theology and that of other Evangelicals and to explore how to address contemporary social issues and appear winsome to a [...] "post-modern world." [...] As one such example, in 2006 the Wesleyan Holiness Consortium published [...] "The Holiness Manifesto" [...] in conjunction with representatives from historic Holiness denominations.|$|R
50|$|Brad Bird {{also helped}} Silverman, {{particularly}} with Krusty's design. An early idea for The Simpsons saw Krusty the Clown being revealed as Homer Simpson's secret stage identity. This storyline never developed, but this episode allowed writers to comment upon the design similarity {{of the two}} characters. Krusty's appearance and design is just that of Homer's, with clown make-up. Silverman enhanced the lines under Krusty's eyes, and reshaped his beard line {{in order to make}} <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> the two characters.|$|R
30|$|Burke and Stats (1998) {{advocated}} {{that social}} identity theory {{is having a}} greater emphasis on socio-cognitive processes, contextual responsiveness, group behaviour and intergroup relations and <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> role and group. Social identity theory has concentrated on the causes and consequences of identifying with a social group or category and has focused more on the meaning associated with being a member of a social category. Again, Turner et al. (1994) have argued that because people defined themselves in terms of their social group membership and enact roles as part of their acceptance of the normative expectations of in group members.|$|R
25|$|George {{reconciled}} {{the issues}} of efficiency and equity, showing that both could be satisfied under a system in harmony with natural law. He showed that Ricardo's Law of Rent applied not just to an agricultural economy, but even more so to urban economics. And he showed {{that there is no}} inherent conflict between labor and capital provided one maintained <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> classical factors of production, capital and land.|$|E
25|$|Gautier's {{literary}} criticism was more reflective in nature; his literary analysis was {{free from the}} pressure of his art and theatre columns and therefore, {{he was able to}} express his ideas without restriction. He made <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> prose and poetry, stating that prose should never be considered the equal of poetry. The bulk of Gautier's criticism, however, was journalistic. He raised the level of journalistic criticism of his day.|$|E
25|$|According to al-Kindi, {{the goal}} of metaphysics is the {{knowledge}} of God. For this reason, he does not make <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> philosophy and theology, because he believes they are both concerned with the same subject. Later philosophers, particularly al-Farabi and Avicenna, would strongly disagree with him on this issue, by saying that metaphysics is actually concerned with being qua being, and as such, the nature of God is purely incidental.|$|E
50|$|According to Réti {{the opening}} was {{introduced}} into master {{play in the}} early part of 1923. Réti used the opening most famously to defeat José Raúl Capablanca, the reigning World Chess Champion, in a game at the 1924 New York tournament. Alexander Alekhine played the Réti in the 1920s, but at that time almost any game that began with Nf3 and c4 by White was considered to be the Réti. Réti popularized these moves against all defenses in the spirit of hypermodernism, and as the opening developed it gained structure and <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> it and other openings.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} extensions to {{a scheme}} for evaluating parse selection accuracy based on named grammatical relations between lemmatised lexical heads. The scheme {{is intended to}} directly reflect the task of recovering grammatical and logical relations, rather than more arbitrary details of tree topology. There is a manually annotated test suite of 500 sentences which {{has been used by}} several groups to perform evaluations. We are developing software to create larger test suites automatically from existing treebanks. We are considering alternative relational annotations which draw <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> grammatical and logical relations in order to overcome limitations of the current proposal...|$|R
50|$|The two Estates are not, {{strictly}} speaking, distinguishable {{from each}} other, {{although they are}} easily identifiable as a joint entity by a glance at {{a map of the}} area. Local residents make <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction,</b> however <b>between</b> the older Firs Estate and the more recent Bromford.|$|R
25|$|LDS Church {{leaders in}} the 20th century sought to make <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> Marxist {{communism}} and the law of consecration as practiced by the United Order, teaching that the practices differed as related to the topics of free will, private property, and deity. The law of consecration and the United Order {{can be compared to}} the shared economic arrangement presented in the New Testament as practiced by 1st-century Christians in Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|Effective {{analytic}} QC methods {{serve as}} a gatekeeper for excellent quality assays. In a typical HTS experiment, <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> a positive control and a negative reference such as a negative control is an index for good quality. Many quality-assessment measures have been proposed to measure the degree of differentiation between a positive control and a negative reference. Signal-to-background ratio, signal-to-noise ratio, signal window, assay variability ratio, and Z-factor have been adopted to evaluate data quality.|$|E
25|$|The Taizong Shilu had {{combined}} {{the second and}} third voyages into one expedition. This was followed by the Mingshi. It led to the confusion of Zheng He's Palembang journey of 1424–25 as being wrongly construed as the sixth voyage {{to make up for the}} seven voyages. However, the Liujiagang and Changle inscriptions made <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> {{the second and third}} voyage as they correctly date the second voyage from 1407 to 1409 and the third voyage from 1409 to 1411.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} argued (http://www.ramas.com/ipbrussels.htm) that DS theory {{provides}} <b>a</b> <b>clearer</b> <b>distinction</b> <b>between</b> epistemic uncertainty and physical uncertainty than Bayesian theory. For example, the height of an unobserved person from a population may have a Gaussian belief distribution with a high variance, but Bayesian theory obtains the same distribution in the case where all people are the same height but little data is available about what that height is, {{as in the case}} where there is a wide range of physically different heights in the population. Standard Bayesian theory may lead to suboptimal decisions if this difference is not accounted for using second-order probability and machinery to estimate utilities of information-gathering actions.|$|R
