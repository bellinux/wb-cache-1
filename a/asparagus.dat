5|$|Cicadas are not major {{agricultural}} pests {{but in some}} outbreak years, trees may be overwhelmed by the sheer numbers of females laying their eggs in the shoots. Small trees may wilt and larger trees may lose small branches. Although in general, the feeding activities of the nymphs do little damage, during the year before an outbreak of periodic cicadas, the large nymphs feed heavily and plant growth may suffer. Some species have turned from wild grasses to sugar cane, and this has affected the crop adversely, {{and in a few}} isolated cases, females have oviposited on food crops such as date palms, grape vines, citrus trees, <b>asparagus</b> and cotton.|$|E

Puccinia <b>asparagi</b> thrives where dews or fogs are prevalent because droplets of water are needed for successful infection of the host plant. At 59 °F (15 °C) a three-hour, spore-wetting period is needed for initial infection. Maximum infection at this temperature occurs after the spores are wet for nine hours.|$|R
5|$|A {{wide variety}} of plant {{material}} is also consumed, including the fruit or berries of Ficus species, Leucopogon species, Exocarpos species, a cycad Macrozamia riedlei, a mistletoe Lysiana exocarpi, Astroloma humifusum, A.pinifolium, Myoporum insulare, Enchylaena tomentosa and Coprosma quadrifida. The grey currawong also eats berries of introduced plants such as Pyracantha angustifolia and P.fortuneana, and Cotoneaster species, and crops such as maize, apples, pears, quince, various stone fruit of the genus Prunus, grapes, tomato, passion flowers, and the nectar of gymea lily (Doryanthes excelsa). On Kangaroo Island, the grey currawong {{has been identified as}} the main vector for the spread of bridal creeper (<b>Asparagus</b> asparagoides). Boneseed (Chrysanthemoides monilifera subspecies monilifera), another invasive species readily dispersed in bird droppings, is also consumed by grey currawongs.

Corn and sorghum are most favored by corn earworms. Various signs reveal the presence of these moths. Young maize crops have holes in their leaves, following whorl-feeding on the apical leaf. Eggs can be found on silks on larger plants, and silks display grazing evidence. The soft, milky grains in the top few centimeters of corn cobs are eaten as the corn ears develop. One larva per cob can be observed. Bore holes are observed in cabbage and lettuce hearts, flower heads, cotton bolls, and tomato fruits. Sorghum heads are grazed, and legume pod seeds are eaten.|$|E
40|$|Chitosan is an {{abundant}} and renewable polysaccharide, its derivatives exhibit attractive bioactivities {{and the wide}} applications in various biomedical fields. In this paper, two novel cationic chitosan derivatives modified with quaternary phosphonium salts were successfully synthesized via trimethylation, chloride acetylation, and quaternization with tricyclohexylphosphine and triphenylphosphine. The structures and properties of synthesized products in the reactions were characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, 1 H-NMR, 31 P-NMR, elemental and thermogravimetric analysis. The antifungal activities of chitosan derivatives against four kinds of phytopathogens, including Phomopsis <b>asparagi,</b> Watermelon fusarium, Colletotrichum lagenarium, and Fusarium oxysporum were tested using the radial growth assay in vitro. The results revealed that the synthesized cationic chitosan derivatives showed significantly improved antifungal efficiency compared to chitosan. It was reasonably suggested that quaternary phosphonium groups enabled the obviously stronger antifungal activity of the synthesized chitosans. Especially, the triphenylphosphonium-functionalized chitosan derivative inhibited the growth of Phomopsis <b>asparagi</b> most effectively, with inhibitory indices of about 80 % at 0. 5 mg/mL. Moreover, the data demonstrated that the substituted groups with stronger electron-withdrawing ability relatively possessed greater antifungal activity.

50|$|In {{many species}} {{reproduction}} is solely through thelytoky, i.e. female eggs {{are produced by}} parthenogenesis, while in others varying proportions of males are produced from unfertilised eggs while females are produced from fertilised eggs. This can differ within species, for example there are no records of males in North American specimens of Tetrastichus <b>asparagi</b> but are recorded in small numbers in European samples. Another reason for the scarcity of males is that in some taxa (e.g. Melittobia) they have been observed {{to stay within the}} host pupa on emergence and aggressively attack and kill each other until only a few survive. The surviving males then have to complete a complicated courtship ritual before they are able to copulate with the females.|$|R

5|$|Rommel {{believed}} that the Normandy coast could be a possible landing point for the invasion, so he ordered the construction of extensive defensive works along that shore. In addition to concrete gun emplacements at strategic points along the coast, he ordered wooden stakes, metal tripods, mines, and large anti-tank obstacles {{to be placed on}} the beaches to delay the approach of landing craft and impede the movement of tanks. Expecting the Allies to land at high tide so that the infantry would spend less time exposed on the beach, he ordered many of these obstacles to be placed at the high water mark. Tangles of barbed wire, booby traps, and the removal of ground cover made the approach hazardous for infantry. On Rommel's order, the number of mines along the coast was tripled. The Allied air offensive over Germany had crippled the Luftwaffe and established air supremacy over western Europe, so Rommel knew he could not expect effective air support. The Luftwaffe could muster only 815 aircraft over Normandy in comparison to the Allies' 9,543. Rommel arranged for booby-trapped stakes known as Rommelspargel (Rommel's <b>asparagus)</b> to be installed in meadows and fields to deter airborne landings.|$|E

To further evaluate the biosynthetic potential of secondary metabolites, we sequenced the genome of Streptomyces sp. W 007 and analyzed the identifiable secondary metabolite gene clusters. Moreover, one gene cluster with type II PKS implied the possibility of Streptomyces sp. W 007 to produce aromatic polyketide of angucyclinone antibiotics. Therefore, two novel compounds, 3 -hydroxy- 1 -keto- 3 -methyl- 8 -methoxy- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydro-benz[a]anthracene and kiamycin with potent cytotoxicities against human cancer cell lines, were isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces sp.

The antifungal activities of starch derivatives against Colletotrichum lagenarium, Watermelon fusarium, and Phomopsis <b>asparagi,</b> were then assayed by hypha measurement in vitro. Apparently, starch derivatives showed enhanced antifungal activity against three fungi at the tested concentrations compared with starch. Especially, the best inhibitory index of starch derivative (III) against Colletotrichum lagenarium attained 97 % above at 1. 0 mg/mL. Meanwhile, starch derivative (III) had stronger antifungal activity than starch derivative (II), which was reasonable {{to propose that}} the alkylation of 1, 2, 3 -triazole and pyridine was significant for enhanced antifungal activity. As this novel starch derivative bearing 1, 2, 3 -triazolium and pyridinium could be prepared efficiently and exhibited superduper antifungal activity, this material might provide an effective way and notion to prepare novel antifungal agents.

Digestion during 6 weeks took place with a 50 / 50 % (v/v) ratio of digested and fresh, undigested material, respectively. Survival of the plant pathogens Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. <b>asparagi</b> and Ralstonia solanacearum, and of the human pathogen Salmonella typhimurium was below the detection levels, and survival of the plant pathogen Plasmodiophora brassicae was low in one experiment and below the detection level in two replicates. In addition, numbers of Enterobacteriaceae originally present in the waste decreased significantly during digestion. However, sclerotia of the plant pathogen Sclerotium cepivorum recovered from the digestion vessel were, at least in part, viable. It is concluded that many pathogens may be inactivated readily, but that anaerobically digested compost may involve some significant phytohygienic problems.

In the present work, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) with particle diameters of ~ 110 nm and pore sizes of ~ 3. 7 nm were synthesized via a liquid crystal templating mechanism. A water-soluble chitosan (CS) derivative (N-(2 -hydroxyl) propyl- 3 -trimethyl ammonium CS chloride, HTCC) was successfully capped {{on the surface}} of pyraclostrobin-loaded MSNs. The physicochemical and structural analyses showed that the electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding were the major forces responsible for the formation of HTCC-capped MSNs. HTCC coating greatly improved the loading efficiency (LC) (to 40. 3 %) compared to using bare MSNs as a single encapsulant (26. 7 %). The microstructure of the nanoparticles was revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The pyraclostrobin-loaded nanoparticles showed an initial burst and subsequent sustained release behavior. HTCC-capped MSNs released faster than bare MSNs in the initial stage. Pyraclostrobin-loaded HTCC-capped MSNs with half doses of pyraclostrobin technical demonstrated almost the same fungicidal activity against Phomopsis <b>asparagi</b> (Sacc.), which obviously reduced the applied pesticide and enhanced the utilization efficiency.
