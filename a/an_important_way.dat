In physics, a matrix {{model is a}} particular kind of physical theory whose mathematical formulation involves the notion of a matrix in <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>way.</b> A matrix model describes the behavior of a set of matrices within the framework of quantum mechanics.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, {{many factors}} were {{important}} in arranging royal marriages. One such factor was {{the amount of}} territory that the other royal family governed or controlled. Another, related factor was {{the stability of the}} control exerted over that territory: when there was territorial instability in a royal family, other royalty would be less inclined to marry into that family. Another factor was political alliance: marriage was <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>way</b> to bind together royal families and their countries during peace and war and could justify many important political decisions.|$|E
5|$|Unlike some countries, {{the growth}} of men's netball is {{hampered}} by cultural bias against it; when parents see their boys playing it, they actively discourage them from continuing. Despite this, the Cook Islands also has a men's national team that has competed in the 2006, 2009 and 2011 International Challenge Men’s and Mixed Netball Tournament. The popularity of netball is growing amongst men on the island, as sport is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>way</b> of villages keeping in touch with each other.|$|E

5|$|Enzyme inhibitors {{also occur}} {{naturally}} and {{are involved in}} the regulation of metabolism. For example, enzymes in a metabolic pathway can be inhibited by downstream products. This type of negative feedback slows the production line when products begin to build up and is <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>way</b> to maintain homeostasis in a cell. Other cellular enzyme inhibitors are proteins that specifically bind to and inhibit an enzyme target. This can help control enzymes that may be damaging to a cell, like proteases or nucleases. A well-characterised example of this is the ribonuclease inhibitor, which binds to ribonucleases in one of the tightest known protein–protein interactions. Natural enzyme inhibitors can also be poisons and are used as defences against predators or as ways of killing prey.|$|E
5|$|Speaking at {{the string}} theory {{conference at the}} University of Southern California in 1995, Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study made the {{surprising}} suggestion that all five superstring theories were in fact just different limiting cases of a single theory in eleven spacetime dimensions. Witten's announcement drew together all of the previous results on S- and T-duality {{and the appearance of}} two- and five-dimensional branes in string theory. In the months following Witten's announcement, hundreds of new papers appeared on the Internet confirming that the new theory involved membranes in <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>way.</b> Today this flurry of work is known as the second superstring revolution.|$|E

40|$|Book delves {{with the}} puzzle that assets play {{important}} role in the theory of international finance but hardly any any role in the theory of international trade. Where this dichotomy comes from? Main feature is that trade in assets may interact in <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>ways</b> with trade in goods and services. The book develops a theory that clarified these interactions. It should also help in the understanding of the effects of capital-market policies on trade in goods and assets. ...|$|R

5000|$|Linguistic and non-linguistic {{indices are}} also <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>ways</b> of {{indexing}} social identity. For example, the Japanese utterance -wa {{in conjunction with}} raising intonation (indexical of increasing affect) by one person who [...] "looks like a woman" [...] and another who looks [...] "like a man" [...] may index different affective dispositions which, in turn, can index gender difference. Ochs and Schieffilen also claim that facial features, gestures, {{as well as other}} non-linguistic indices may actually help specify the general information provided by the linguistic features and augment the pragmatic meaning of the utterance.|$|R

25|$|Domain Analysis: Domain {{analysis}} {{represents a}} search for the larger units of cultural knowledge, which Spradley (1979) called domains. This method of analysis stems from the belief that symbols are <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>way</b> of communicating cultural meaning. This analysis should be used when researchers are interested in understanding relationships among concepts.|$|E

As Crusader rule stabilized, Ramla became the seat of a seigneury in the Kingdom of Jerusalem (the Lordship of Ramla within the County of Jaffa and Ascalon). It was a city of some economic significance and <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>way</b> station for pilgrims travelling to Jerusalem.

25|$|Around 1980, red {{imported}} {{fire ants}} began spreading throughout the West Indies, {{where they were}} first reported in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Between 1991 and 2001, the ant was recorded from Trinidad and Tobago, several areas in the Bahamas, the British Virgin Islands, Antigua, and the Turks and Caicos Islands. Since then, red imported fire ants have been recorded on more islands and regions, with new populations discovered in: Anguilla, Saint Martin, Barbuda, Montserrat, Saint Kitts, Nevis, Aruba, and Jamaica. The ants recorded from Aruba and Jamaica have only been found on golf courses; these courses import sod from Florida, so such importation may be <b>an</b> <b>important</b> <b>way</b> for the ant to spread throughout the West Indies.|$|E
