5|$|Gritters {{are among}} the winter service {{vehicles}} also used in airports, to keep runways free of ice. However, the salt normally used to clear roads can damage the airframe of aircraft and interferes with the sensitive navigation equipment. As a result, airport gritters spread less dangerous potassium acetate or urea onto the runways instead, <b>as</b> <b>these</b> do not corrode the aircraft or the airside equipment.|$|E
