5|$|The {{conservative}} {{tradition of}} the mosque, with its {{lack of attention to}} science, was shaken by Napoleon's invasion. <b>A</b> <b>seminal</b> innovation occurred with the introduction of printing presses to Egypt, finally enabling the curriculum to shift from oral lectures and memorization to instruction by text, though the mosque itself only acquired its own printing press in 1930. Upon the withdrawal of the French, Muhammad Ali Pasha encouraged the establishment of secular learning, and history, math, and modern science were adopted into the curriculum. By 1872, under the direction of Jamāl al-Dīn al-Afghānī, European philosophy was also added to the study program.|$|E

Based on these morphological differences, supported by preliminary molecular data, five North American species (originally placed in Monobothrium) are proposed {{to be transferred}} to Promonobothrium Mackiewicz, 1968 as new combinations. European species Monobothrium auriculatum Kulakovskaya, 1961 should be transferred to Caryophyllaeus Gmelin, 1790 as C. auriculatus n. comb. As a result of this transfer, Monobothrium becomes monotypic, with M. wageneri Nybelin, 1922 representing its only species...|$|R

5|$|Although a {{commercial}} smash, the record received initially lukewarm reviews from mainstream music critics; many contemporary reviewers deemed it inferior to Definitely Maybe, with the songwriting and production particular points of criticism. In the ensuing years, however, critical opinion towards the album reversed, {{and it is}} now generally considered <b>a</b> <b>seminal</b> record of both the Britpop era, and the 1990s in general. Over several months in 1995 and 1996, the band performed an extensive world tour in support of the album.

5|$|Chng Suan Tze v. Minister for Home Affairs is <b>a</b> <b>seminal</b> case in {{administrative}} law {{decided by the}} Court of Appeal of Singapore in 1988. The Court decided the appeal in the appellants' favour on a technical ground, but considered obiter dicta the reviewability of government power in preventive detention cases under the Internal Security Act ("ISA"). The case approved the application by the court of an objective test in the review of government discretion under the ISA, stating that all power has legal limits {{and the rule of}} law demands that the courts should be able to examine the exercise of discretionary power. This was a landmark shift from the position in the 1971 High Court decision Lee Mau Seng v. Minister of Home Affairs, which had been an authority for the application of a subjective test until it was overruled by Chng Suan Tze.|$|E

5|$|Television's {{debut album}} Marquee Moon, {{released}} in 1977, is frequently cited as <b>a</b> <b>seminal</b> album in the field. The no wave movement that developed in New York {{in the late}} 1970s, with artists such as Lydia Lunch and James Chance, is often treated as the phenomenon's U.S. parallel. The later work of Ohio protopunk pioneers Pere Ubu is also commonly described as post-punk. One {{of the most influential}} American post-punk bands was Boston's Mission of Burma, who brought abrupt rhythmic shifts derived from hardcore into a highly experimental musical context. In 1980, Australia's Boys Next Door moved to London and changed their name to the Birthday Party, which evolved into Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. Led by the Primitive Calculators, Melbourne's Little Band scene would further explore the possibilities of post-punk. Later alternative rock musicians found diverse inspiration among these post-punk predecessors, as they did among their new wave contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|The abdomen {{consists}} of ten segments and contains the gut and genital organs. The front eight segments have spiracles and the terminal segment is modified for reproduction. The male has {{a pair of}} clasping organs attached to a ring structure, and during copulation, a tubular structure is extruded and inserted into the female's vagina. A spermatophore is deposited in the female, following which the sperm {{make their way to}} <b>a</b> <b>seminal</b> receptacle where they are stored for later use. In both sexes, the genitalia are adorned with various spines, teeth, scales and bristles, which act to prevent the butterfly from mating with an insect of another species. After it emerges from its pupal stage, a butterfly cannot fly until the wings are unfolded. A newly emerged butterfly needs to spend some time inflating its wings with hemolymph and letting them dry, during which time it is extremely vulnerable to predators.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>seminal</b> {{paper by}} Noether, Helmut Hasse, and Richard Brauer {{pertains}} to division algebras, which are algebraic systems in which division is possible. They proved two important theorems: a local-global theorem stating {{that if a}} finite-dimensional central division algebra over a number field splits locally everywhere then it splits globally (so is trivial), and from this, deduced their Hauptsatz ("main theorem"): every finite dimensional central division algebra over an algebraic number field F splits over a cyclic cyclotomic extension. These theorems allow one to classify all finite-dimensional central division algebras over a given number field. A subsequent paper by Noether showed, as a special case of a more general theorem, that all maximal subfields of a division algebra D are splitting fields. This paper also contains the Skolem–Noether theorem which states that any two embeddings of an extension of a field k into a finite-dimensional central simple algebra over k, are conjugate. The Brauer–Noether theorem gives a characterization of the splitting fields of a central division algebra over a field.|$|E
