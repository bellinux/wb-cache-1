5|$|M-87 {{was assumed}} {{into the state}} {{trunkline}} system by July 1, 1919, when the system was first signed. At the time, the highway connected M-65 in Fenton with M-10 east of Holly. Later when the United States Numbered Highway System was created on November 11, 1926, those two highways were renumbered US23 and US10 respectively. The highway was fully paved in 1937. In 1958, Fenton was bypassed by the Fenton–Clio Expressway {{to the west of}} downtown. and the former route through downtown was redesignated Bus. US23.

5|$|Hurricane Felix caused severe beach erosion {{along the}} East Coast of the United States in August1995. The seventh {{tropical}} cyclone, sixth named storm, and third hurricane of the 1995 Atlantic hurricane season, Felix developed from a tropical wave {{in the eastern}} Atlantic Ocean on August8. Although initially a tropical depression, it strengthened into Tropical Storm Felix later that day. Further intensification was slow, with Felix reaching hurricane status on August11. Under favorable conditions, Felix began to rapidly deepen while curving northwestward. Late on August12, Felix peaked as a low-end Category4 hurricane. However, it soon weakened rapidly to a Category1 hurricane. Less than three days later, Felix passed only 75mi (120km) southeast of Bermuda. Although it also posed {{a threat to the}} East Coast of the United States, Felix curved northward and then east-northeastward while remaining offshore, thereby avoiding landfall. Felix briefly threatened Bermuda again, but weakened to a tropical storm <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the northeast on August20. It accelerated east-northeastward, and passed a short distance offshore of Newfoundland, where Felix transitioned into an extratropical storm on August22.|$|E

25|$|Fashion in {{the period}} 1500–1550 in Western Europe is marked by voluminous {{clothing}} worn in an abundance of layers (one reaction to the cooling temperatures of the Little Ice Age, especially in Northern Europe and the British Isles). Contrasting fabrics, slashes, embroidery, applied trims, {{and other forms of}} surface ornamentation became prominent. The tall, narrow lines of the late Medieval period were replaced with a wide silhouette, conical for women with breadth at the hips and broadly square for men with width at the shoulders. Sleeves were a center of attention, and were puffed, slashed, cuffed, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> reveal contrasting linings.|$|E
25|$|The Romans {{established}} a camp of which no archaeological trace has been found, received ambassadors and had Commius, {{who had been}} arrested {{as soon as he}} had arrived in Britain, returned to them. Caesar claims he was negotiating from a position of strength and that the British leaders, blaming their attacks on him on the common people, were in only four days awed into giving hostages, some immediately, some as soon as they could be brought from inland, and disbanding their army. However, after his cavalry had come within sight of the beachhead but then been scattered <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Gaul by storms, and with food running short, Caesar, a native of the Mediterranean, was taken by surprise by high British tides and a storm. His beached warships filled with water, and his transports, riding at anchor, were driven against each other. Some ships were wrecked, and many others were rendered unseaworthy by the loss of rigging or other vital equipment, threatening the return journey.|$|E

25|$|The {{additional}} funding, though significant, {{expanded the}} scope of the game and causes some setbacks, and for some periods, the Greens lived off loans and donations during the development. Following Joel's death March 2014, Ryan was further committed to completing the game to honor Joel's memory and as a way to cope with his loss, <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> work a few days after Joel's funeral. The game, up to that point, had been written based on unknowing of Joel's fate, but with his death, the team recognized that much of what they had in place was more focused on the narrative from Ryan and Amy's side, and made it feel more of a selfish work. There were also concerns from investors about the interactivity of the title. They rewrote about 70% of the game to make it more focused on the interactions with Joel. Originally, the game would have ended with the player witnessing a machine with numerous levers that could be pulled, giving the player some sense of control, but when they examined the machine's internals, found that all of the levers were disconnected, and that they had no control of the situation. Following Joel's death, they felt this scene was no longer applicable, and instead replaced it with the players interacting a final time with Joel in a cathedral in an afterlife-type setting as to bring closure to their story. With the change, Ryan hoped that the game would help others to cope and open up with others with the loss of loved ones. One design decision made was to represent the characters in the game with feature-less faces. Ryan stated that this was both that being a small team they did not have the technical capability to fully program and animate the character's faces, and that by leaving the faces feature-less, it would help players engage by imagining themselves in the place of the game's characters.|$|E
500|$|Starting in 1953, the westernmost {{approximately}} [...] of M-81 {{was also}} used for a US23 concurrency. When the bypass of Saginaw was completed in late 1961, M-81 was extended along M-13 southwesterly into downtown Saginaw where it turned west across the Saginaw River to Midland Road west of the city. This routing across the city was removed in 1971 when I-675 was completed; west of that freeway the highway became M-58, the rest was either removed from the highway system <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> local control, or it had the M-81 designation removed. Since this truncation, M-81 has ended at its junction with M-13 north of downtown Saginaw.

500|$|Barlow took {{possession}} of the battered French vessel and set his men to making hasty repairs before the weather could worsen. The first task was dealing with the dead and wounded on the French ship: Magadie reported {{in the immediate aftermath}} that 200 men had been killed and 143 were seriously wounded or dying, figures that Barlow considered to be understated. When repairs were complete, Barlow turned his ships towards nearby Gibraltar, but {{in the face of a}} westerly breeze progress was slow and after fours days he abandoned the attempt <b>and</b> <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Menorca, concerned for the state of the wounded men and the large number of prisoners of war aboard both vessels. However, the wind dropped when the ships were off the Southern coast of Majorca and Phoebe and Africaine did not reach Port Mahon until 5 March. The action was highly praised by the station commander Captain Manley Dixon, who stated in a letter to the Admiralty dated 10 March 1801 [...] "that more Skill or effective Gunnery were never displayed in any Combat than in the present Instance".|$|E

In the new government, there was a strong tendency to accept the Chilean offer of Tacna and Arica, but it was eventually refused and Bolivia signed the creation of the United States of Peru and Bolivia, a political fantasy without any practical consequences. Bolivia helped Peru with money and weapons but the Bolivian army never again intervened in the war.|$|E

2500|$|Sturt {{was driven}} by a {{conviction}} {{that it was his}} destiny to discover a great salt water lake, known as 'the inland sea', in the middle of Australia. At very least, he wanted to be the first explorer to plant his foot in 'the centre' of Australia. In August 1844, [...] he set out with a party of 15 men, 200 sheep, six drays and a boat to explore north-western New South Wales and to advance into central Australia. They travelled along the Murray River and Darling River before passing the future site of Broken Hill, but were then stranded for months by the extreme summer conditions near the present site of Milparinka. When the rains eventually came Sturt moved north and established a depot at Fort Grey in today's Sturt National Park.

On the morning of 23 September, the cruiser was fired on by shore batteries at Dakar while intercepting and driving back two Fantasque-class destroyers, but did not receive damage. That afternoon, Australia and the British destroyers [...] and [...] engaged the French destroyer L'Audacieux, setting her on fire. On 24 September, despite poor visibility, Australia joined other Allied ships in shelling Dakar and the French warships in the harbour; during the withdrawal to the rest of the fleet, the Australian cruiser was unsuccessfully attacked by high-altitude bombers.
