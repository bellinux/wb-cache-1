5000|$|Arthropods include Madagascar hissing {{cockroaches}} and Chilean <b>rose</b> <b>tarantulas</b> ...|$|R
5000|$|Grammostola rosea, the Chilean <b>rose</b> <b>{{tarantula}},</b> the Chilean flame tarantula or Chilean fire tarantula, {{a spider}} species ...|$|R
50|$|Reptiles and {{invertebrates}} {{at the zoo}} include Madagascan hissing cockroaches, royal pythons, two-spot assassin bugs, giant African land snails, bearded dragons, rainbow boas, Mexican redknee tarantulas, leopard geckos, Honduran milk snakes, Chilean <b>rose</b> <b>tarantulas,</b> curly-haired tarantulas, and Tanzanian red-legged millipedes.|$|R
50|$|Sun beetle, leaf insects, Mcklay's spectre, giant thorny stick insect, orange headed cockroaches, Indian {{ornamental}} tarantula, Brazilian black <b>tarantula,</b> Chilean <b>rose</b> <b>tarantula,</b> tailless whip scorpion, and tiger land snails.|$|R
5000|$|These three toxins are {{structurally}} similar peptides of 29-32 {{amino acids}} [...] They show sequence similarity to Hanatoxins, {{which can be}} isolated from the venom of the Chilean <b>rose</b> <b>tarantula</b> Grammostola rosea [...]|$|R
50|$|The Chilean <b>rose</b> <b>{{tarantula}}</b> (Grammostola rosea), {{also known}} as the <b>rose</b> hair <b>tarantula,</b> the Chilean fire tarantula, or the Chilean red-haired tarantula (depending on the color morph), is probably the most common species of tarantula available in American and European pet stores today, due to the large number of wild-caught specimens exported cheaply from their native Chile into the pet trade. The species is also known from Bolivia and Argentina.|$|R
50|$|These spiders are {{medium to}} large {{in size and}} usually brown in color, with pinkish or orangish-red hairs. The very docile Chilean <b>rose</b> <b>{{tarantula}}s</b> (Grammostola rosea and Grammostola porteri) are popular as a beginner's spider among tarantula enthusiasts.|$|R
50|$|Phrixotoxins are peptide toxins {{derived from}} the venom of the Chilean copper {{tarantula}} Phrixotrichus auratus, also named Paraphysa scrofa. Phrixotoxin-1 and -2 block A-type voltage-gated potassium channels; phrixotoxin-3 blocks voltage-gated sodium channels. Similar toxins are found in other species, for instance the Chilean <b>rose</b> <b>tarantula.</b>|$|R
25|$|Dublin Zoo's Reptile House {{was opened}} in 1876. It {{features}} reptiles such as West African crocodiles, Gila monsters, veiled chameleons, pancake tortoises, leopard tortoises, plated lizards, Bell's hinge-back tortoises, Burmese pythons, Asian leaf turtles, Asian water monitors and East African black mud turtles, {{as well as}} invertebrates such as Macleay's spectres and Chilean <b>rose</b> <b>tarantulas.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Spider {{potassium}} channel inhibitory toxins is {{another group of}} spider toxins. A representative of this group is hanatoxin, a 35 amino acid peptide toxin which was isolated from Chilean <b>rose</b> <b>tarantula</b> (Grammostola rosea, syn. G. spatulata) venom. It inhibits the drk1 voltage-gated {{potassium channel}} by altering the energetics of gating. See also Huwentoxin-1 [...]|$|R
50|$|Gadolinium (Gd3+) {{and other}} {{lanthanides}} {{have been shown}} to block stretch-activated ion channel function. The peptide toxin isolated from the Chilean <b>rose</b> <b>tarantula</b> (Grammostola spatulata), mechanotoxin 4 (GsMTx4) has been shown to inhibit these channels from the extracellular side, but it does not inhibit all stretch-activated ion channels and particularly has no effect on 2p channels.|$|R
50|$|Crawl-A-See-Em lets {{visitors}} observe tarantulas, leaf insects, scorpions, beetles, {{and giant}} millipedes, and even hold Rosie, a Chilean <b>rose</b> hair <b>tarantula.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Large spiders used in Hollywood movies (e.g., Indiana Jones series, The Mummy Returns) {{are often}} Brachypelma hamorii or Brachypelma emilia {{because they are}} very docile, though the much less {{expensive}} and only moderately more aggressive Chilean <b>rose</b> <b>tarantula</b> is frequently used, as well. [...] While it is almost unheard of for a Brachypelma to bite a human, they are quick to kick urticating hairs in self-defense, though their hairs can be less irritating than those of other species, especially the goliath birdeater.|$|R
2500|$|Reaction and {{the degree}} of {{irritation}} to a defensive urticating hair barrage can vary tremendously, based on the species in question. [...] Some, such as those of the Chilean <b>rose</b> <b>tarantula</b> (Grammastola rosea) and the Pinktoe tarantula (Avicularia avicularia), are fairly mild and innocuous to humans. [...] Others, such as those of the Brazilian giant white knee tarantula (Acanthoscurria geniculata), are moderately irritating. [...] Still others, such as the Goliath Birdeater (Theraphosa blondi), are far more severe. [...] These hairs can result in painful rashes, and have been likened to sharp shards of fiberglass.|$|R
5000|$|The Chilean <b>rose</b> <b>tarantula</b> (Grammostola rosea) is {{a common}} pet, its {{behavior}} being generally docile and its venom very mild. It needs {{to be kept dry}} and dislikes being wet (its natural habitat being one of the driest deserts on earth). If the substrate is too wet, it will stand [...] "on tiptoes" [...] in discomfort, or climb the sides of its enclosure, risking fall and injury. It feeds on other invertebrates. Its attributes and care {{are similar to those of}} its relative the Chaco golden knee tarantula (Grammostola pulchripes).|$|R
50|$|The {{education}} {{building houses}} reptiles, arachnids, amphibians, and one emperor scorpion. Species of reptiles include bearded dragon, red-tailed boa, ball python, blue-tongued skink, and European glass lizard. Two amphibian species are on display, the Amazon milky tree frog and the African bullfrog. There are {{two species of}} arachnids, the Chilean <b>rose</b> hair <b>tarantula</b> and the orange baboon tarantula.|$|R
5000|$|Containing {{many animals}} {{previously}} kept in Pets' Corner, this area opened in 2009 and contains many exotic and familiar mammals, birds, reptiles and insects. There are small areas for striped skunk, ferrets, chickens, guinea pigs, cockatoos, Indian runner ducks, Hermann's tortoises, pancake tortoise, spur-thighed tortoise, iguanas, armadillos, rock hyraxes, and a fennec fox. An undercover area houses a regular Parrot show, where keepers demonstrate {{the intelligence of}} the resident macaws. Next door is a walk-through butterfly house, home to a large variety of the species, which replaced an older butterfly house built in the 1980s. Inside the main building is the Animal Handling Hall, where visitors can {{get a chance to}} hold a variety of creatures such as a Chilean <b>rose</b> <b>tarantula</b> or a corn snake, or even get up close to a selection of reptiles. Secretary bird can also be found in a aviary ...|$|R
40|$|Protein toxins from venomous animals exhibit remarkably {{specific}} and selective interactions {{with a wide}} variety of ion channels. Hanatoxin and grammotoxin are two related protein toxins found in the venom of the Chilean <b>Rose</b> <b>Tarantula,</b> Phrixotrichus spatulata. Hanatoxin inhibits voltage-gated K+ channels and grammotoxin inhibits voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels. Both toxins inhibit their respective channels by interfering with normal operation of the voltage-dependent gating mechanism. The sequence homology of hanatoxin and grammotoxin, as well as their similar mechanism of action, raises the possibility that they interact with the same region of voltage-gated Ca 2 + and K+ channels. Here, we show that each toxin can interact with both voltage-gated Ca 2 + and K+ channels and modify channel gating. Moreover, mutagenesis of voltage-gated K+ channels suggests that hanatoxin and grammotoxin recognize the same structural motif. We propose that these toxins recognize a voltage-sensing domain or module present in voltage-gated ion channels and that this domain has a highly conserved three-dimensional structure...|$|R
50|$|A further {{addition}} {{which opened}} in 2011 was the education centre which was created as a renovation of the old soft bill aviary. The pheasants and kookaburras which lived in the soft bill aviary were {{moved to a new}} pheasantry along the front of the tropical house, while a group of Old English Game fowl from the building now join the other free roaming animals (including peafowl, helmeted guineafowl, silver pheasant, chicken and Parma wallaby). This new centre houses a hands on animal encounter hall in which both schools and general visitors are given the chance to hold bearded dragons, corn snake and a Chilean <b>rose</b> <b>tarantula,</b> while being given an educational talk about them. On the adjoining side there is also a museum which displays a variety of items which have been seized by HM customs at Heathrow Airport and donated to the park, a display of tribal artefacts (including genuine weaponry, tattoo kits and replica shrunken heads), displays of bones, feathers, eggs and fossils, along with an alligator skin which visitors are able to touch.|$|R
