25|$|The two sectors form a continuum, with VET at {{the lower}} end and Higher Education at the higher. VET courses are {{typically}} short, practical in nature and delivered by a TAFE college or Registered Training <b>Organisation</b> at a <b>certificate</b> to diploma level. Higher Education courses take three years or longer to complete, are academic in nature and are delivered by universities at degree level. There is significant overlap, however; a TAFE college may offer degrees and universities may offer certificates and diplomas. A number of private institutions and community education centres cover the full range of qualifications.|$|R

40|$|The key term, {{which is}} a central piece of the present {{bachelor}} thesis, is project management. This study, that is steadily gaining in importance, has {{become an integral part}} of education in many of Czech universities. The core of the work is thus a comparison of education of project management on the selected institutions in our country. For obtaining some quantitative result that would compare the education I studied the percent coverage of the certificate IPMA level D in the chosen subjects. Therefeore the content of certificate has been divided according to elements of competences. The parts have been given a point evaluation according to their total number. Whenever possible, I tried to consult the precise content of the subject with the appropriate teacher. In other cases I relied on the syllabus of the subject on webpages of faculty. Except the comparison the work itself offers a necessary introduction to the issue and introduces the basic concepts. After introductory chapter, that briefly touches project management in general, follow chapters devoted to standards and certifications. With future purposes in mind, a special place is reserved for IPMA. In the last chapter other possibilites of preparation to the IPMA are mentiones. These we can understand as the official preparation to IPMA recommended by the <b>organisation</b> issuing <b>certificate</b> in Czech republic...|$|R
40|$|Organisations {{worldwide}} {{strive to}} develop their management systems for business functions, ranging from quality and environment to safety, information security and social responsibility. During the latest decade {{a considerable amount of}} these efforts has been concentrated on introducing and applying standards such as the ISO 9001 and ISO 14001. The need for Integrated Management Systems (IMS) often arises as a result of decisions to implement Environmental Management Systems (EMS) and/or an occupational health and safety management system in addition to a Quality Management System (QMS) At the end of 2003, approximately 3200 organisations in Sweden had an ISO 9001 certificate, and approximately 3400 <b>organisations</b> had a <b>certificate</b> based on an EMS. Dealing with separate management systems and ensuring that they align with the organisation’s strategies and goals, has proved difficult. Owing to the large number of organisations certified according to multiple types of systems, an increasing number of organisations are establishing IMS. There are examples of companies, which chose to integrate EMS and QMS into a co-ordinated implementation approach, and although sparse, the research within this area indicates potential benefits of using an integrated approach. This paper presents both a theoretical and an empirical investigation with the aim to elucidate problems related to the integration of management systems. Furthermore, the paper will present recommendations for succeeding in such integrations and, hence, contributing to an increased understanding on how IMS should be designed and implemented...|$|R
