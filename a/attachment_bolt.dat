More recently, underwing sensor pod development has been completed, for the conduct of jet aircraft emission flight research, with the intention of being able to fully measure various aspects of emissions holistically, over the whole of the aircraft wake regimes. Critical airworthiness issues included the loads that the aircraft and pods would be subjected to, in the wake turbulence regimes of wakes, and the trailing-pair wake vortex regime in particular. NRC CT- 133 wake turbulence data without the pods has been analysed and transformed to the pod CG locations, and resulting reactions derived for the pod mounting rack <b>attachment</b> <b>bolt</b> locations, the critical loading points. The resulting pod mounting rack <b>attachment</b> <b>bolt</b> loads have been parametrically related for wake turbulence parameters.

40|$|Cylindrical fuel casks {{often have}} impact {{limiters}} surrounding just {{the ends of}} the cask shaft in a typical 'dumbbell' arrangement. The primary purpose of these impact limiters is to absorb energy to reduce loads on the cask structure during impacts associated with a severe accident.

For this credit to be taken in safety analyses, the impact limiter attachment system must be shown to retain the impact limiter following Normal Conditions of Transport (NCT) and Hypothetical Accident Conditions (HAC) impacts.

However, after considerable in-service experience of the boom-renewal process British Aircraft Corporation amended the procedure to allow re-use of the engine nacelle rear mount fittings. Re-use of the old fittings relied on the existing holes aligning closely with the bushes in the new inner lower booms.

Out of the six bush nuts, four were found with the propeller extension flange. All these bush nuts were either loose or could be taken out of the propeller flange by finger push and/or slight tapping. From the available evidences and the failure patterns, it appears that the bush-nuts were not interference fitted on to the propeller extension flange. Analysis showed that in such a situation, the bush nuts are unlocked and could work their way out due to vibration. Evidences suggest that at least three bush-nuts got loosened in service, which resulted in excessive load on the other three bolts leading to fatigue failure.

Panels {{of these materials}} are often bolted to vehicles to provide soldier protection. Design guidelines and durability of <b>bolted</b> <b>attachments</b> in static and fatigue loadings are not well understood. In this study, Discontinuous Ceramic Cored Sandwich Structures, comprised of S 2 -Glass/epoxy composite face sheets bonded to a ceramic tile core are fabricated and tested to understand the complexities of stress distribution and load transfer between materials and the stress concentrations and failure modes in the bolted connections. Static testing of the composite structure with and without bolted joints provides insight into failure modes and joint capacity. Fatigue testing provides insight into long term durability as measured by stiffness loss, residual strength and change in failure modes. Previous testing has been performed to study the in-plane stresses and failure modes due to tensile loading with pinned joints. This study examines the effect of bolt torque through static loading and quantifying the changes in failure progression and load capacity. Data provided from these tests allow for fatigue parameters to be established {{in order to examine}} stiffness loss and joint sensitivity to fatigue loading.

40|$|In early 2011, the ISS Vehicle Configuration Office began {{considering}} {{the relocation of}} the Permanent Multipurpose Module (PMM) to the aft facing Common Berthing Mechanism (CBM) on Node 3 to open a berthing location for visiting vehicles on the Node 1 nadir CBM. In this position, computer-aided design (CAD) models indicated that the aft end of the PMM would be {{only a few inches}} from the stowed Functional Cargo Block (FGB) port solar array. To validate the CAD model clearance analysis, in the late summer of 2011 the Image Science and Analysis Group (ISAG) was asked to determine the true geometric relationship between the on-orbit aft facing Node 3 CBM and the FGB port solar array. The desired measurements could be computed easily by photogrammetric analysis if current imagery of the ISS hardware were obtained. Beginning in the fall of 2011, ISAG used the Dynamic Onboard Ubiquitous Graphics (DOUG) program to design a way to acquire imagery of the aft face of Node 3, the aft end-cone of Node 1, the port side of pressurized mating adapter 1 (PMA 1), and the port side of the FGB out to the tip of the port solar array using cameras on the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS). This was complicated by the need to thread the SSRMS under the truss, past Node 3 and the Cupola, and into the space between the aft side of Node 3 and the FGB solar array to acquire more than 100 images from multiple positions. To minimize the number of SSRMS movements, the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM) would be attached to the SSRMS. This would make it possible to park the SPDM in one position and acquire multiple images by changing the viewing orientation of the SPDM body cameras using the pan/tilt units on which the cameras are mounted. Using this implementation concept, ISAG identified four SSRMS/SPDM positions from which all of the needed imagery could be acquired. Based on a photogrammetric simulation, it was estimated that the location of the FGB solar array could be measured within an accuracy of about 1 in. in each axis relative to the ISS Analysis Coordinate System (ISSACS). In October 2011, a proposed image-acquisition plan was drafted by ISAG and released for review. The ISS Robotics flight control team (ROBO) proposed minor changes to SPDM positions 1 and 4 to meet ISS proximity requirements. The updated image acquisition plan and draft chit were presented to and approved by the Systems Working Group (SWG) November 18 and were sent to the Vehicle Configuration Board (VCB) in early December 2011. Working with ROBO on 3 successive days (February 21, 22, and 23), ISAG collected 161 images of the ISS. Approximately 40 images were collected from each of the four different SSRMS/SPDM positions, with each set mapping the region from the Node 3 end cone, across Node 1, along the forward port side portion of the FGB, and out the port side FGB solar arrays. From this imagery, the best 80 images were selected for use in the analysis. The images were radiometrically enhanced to improve color and contrast and loaded into the FotoG analysis software along with the camera parameters and control data, which consisted of the coordinates for 54 handrail <b>attachment</b> <b>bolts</b> on the aft face of Node 3, in the ISSACS coordinate system. The results of this analysis produced the measured coordinates of 116 points distributed across the face of the FGB solar array panels (see figure 3) along with propagated uncertainty estimates in each coordinate axis. These results were sent to the ISS Vehicle Configuration Office, which sent them to the Configuration Analysis Modeling and Mass Properties (CAMMP) team for comparison with the Russian-provided CAD model for the retracted FGB solar arrays. The CAMMP analysis unexpectedly showed that the measured location of the port FGB solar array was up to 41 -in. further outboard than the design and was slightly twisted about its rotational axis. The unexpected comparison results produced some initial concern regarding the accuracy of the photogrammetric measurements. To verify the measured results, ISAG personnel conducted a second analysis using just the imagery of the solar arrays in an arbitrary coordinate system defined by the three corner points of the inboard-most panel, with the design distance between points A 1 and A 10 as the only scale. The new measurements agreed with the original results to within less than 1 in. RMS in each axis, confirming the original solar array measurements. ISAG produced a final report for the ISS Vehicle Configuration Office documenting an apparent anomaly in the retracted configuration of the port FGB solar arrays. A copy of the measurement report was translated and sent to the Russian Space Agency. During a Vehicle Integrated Performance and Resources (VIPeR) teleconference September 24, 2012, the Russians acknowledged receipt of a translated copy of the ISAG report. The Russian representative stated that the head of the solar array design team claimed that the measured configuration was impossible unless the structure was physically broken. The Russians acknowledged that they had no expertise in photogrammetry, so the analysis technique employed was a "black box" to them, and they {{did not know how to}} use the ISAG results. They asked for a single image in which the overextension of the port solar array could be obviously seen. On November 10, 2012, during a face-to-face meeting with their Russian counterparts at JSC, ISAG presented nadir-view imagery of the FGB acquired during Space Shuttle rendezvous. Using the known width of the pressurized portion of the FGB as a scale, this analysis clearly showed that the port FGB solar array was extended outboard further than the Russian design for the retracted solar array...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{experimental}} investigations on progressive bearing failure mechanisms of composite bolted joints and their integration into a crash design concept. The {{objective of the}} presented test program is a crash design for a generic composite transport aircraft fuselage structure that utilizes tension loads in the passenger cross beam for energy absorption. In this design, the passenger cross beams are fabricated from carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) and kinetic energy shall be absorbed by progressive bearing failure of their <b>bolted</b> <b>attachments.</b> A specific design for a standard bolted joint was developed and experimentally investigated, which provides controlled bearing failure to reliably ensure energy absorption in combination with sufficient structural integrity in a crash event. The concept ensures â€¢ controlled direction of bearing failure under various loading conditions (on- and off-axis loading), â€¢ a robust stop mechanism to limit the progressive bearing failure to a certain displacement, â€¢ steady, progressive failure with non-constraining flow of the debris out of the local crush zone to prevent blockage effects, which may lead to abrupt load increase. In a comprehensive test program on coupon level several design concepts were investigated under quasi-static loading considering the progressive failure mechanisms of one single bolt. This bolt connects two CFRP sheets and is set under regular conditions (pre-stressed). In the shear tests, the bolt shaft is pulled {{through one of the}} CFRP sheets leading to significant energy absorption. Different design concepts, including specific notches and modified washers, were tested with the aim to ensure constant load level during the failure process by steady debris outflow that prevents debris blockage effects in the local crush zone in front of the bolt. Subsequently, preferential concepts were tested with a crash relevant dynamic loading rate of v = 2 m/s. The concept was proven on element level using multi-bolt specimens (2 -bolt and 4 -bolt). On-axis and off-axis loading up to 30 Â° was tested under dynamic loading conditions of v = 0. 1 m/s and v = 2 m/s. Further design modifications were investigated that focused on enhanced robustness and an improved connection for the standard operating condition. On this element level, the concept feasibility could successfully be confirmed. Finally, this paper presents application aspects of the tension absorber concept. Crash simulations of a fuselage section are presented that illustrate the potential of energy absorption by utilization of tensile crash loads in the passenger cross beam...|$|R
