40|$|Abstract—Fire {{disaster}} {{is a great}} threat to lives and property. <b>Automatic</b> fire <b>alarm</b> system provides real-time surveillance, monitoring and <b>automatic</b> <b>alarm.</b> It sends early alarm when the fire occurs and helps to reduce the fire damage. Wireless sensor network {{has become the most}} important technology in environmental monitoring and home or factory automation in recent years. In this paper, an <b>automatic</b> fire <b>alarm</b> system based on wireless sensor networks is developed, which is designed for high-rise buildings. In order to provide early extinguishing of a fire disaster, large numbers of detectors which periodically measure smoke concentration or temperature are deployed in buildings. Those scattered detectors report their monitoring information to the surveillance center via the self-organizing hierarchical wireless sensor networks. Test results from the prototype system show that the <b>automatic</b> fire <b>alarm</b> system achieves the design requirements.
