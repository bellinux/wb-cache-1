40|$|SYNOPSIS Concentrated faecal {{extracts}} from breast and artificially fed infants {{during the first}} week of life were examined by paper chromatography. Besides lactose, glucose and galactose, five oligosaccharide spots were detected. Breast-fed infants showed an additional fucose spot. Complete hydrolysis of the individual oligosaccharides showed glucose and galactose always and fucose in two instances. The oligosaccharides are probably similar to those isolated by other workers from colostrum and human milk. This is a preliminary report. Recently observed defects of disaccharide absorp-tion in dystrophic infants suggested a more detailed investigation of the carbohydrates found in the faeces of 200 healthy infants. Paper chromatography showed that the faeces of such healthy infants frequently contained, in addition to the expected glucose, galactose, and lactose, a larger number of oligosaccharides and fucose. These substances were found more frequently during the first four weeks of life rather than in later infancy and in breast-fed rather than in artificially fed infants.

While there are two non-FDA approved drugs to treat acute Chagas disease, there is no treatment available for its chronic stage. The objective of this project is to synthesize the substrate for acyl dihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase (ADS). This enzyme participates in the first step of alkyl lipid synthesis which is very abundant in T. cruzi, and is a potential target for developing more efficient drugs or inhibitors to treat Chagas disease. Recently, several alkyl phospholipid derivatives have been developed, and some of them have been shown to have potent anti-parasitic activity against several protozoan parasites, such as T. cruzi, Leishmania ssp., and Plasmodium falciparum. Therefore the importance to synthesize the ADS substrate (palmitoyl dihydroxyacetonephosphate) is that it will allow us to examine and biochemically characterize the native T. cruzi ADS enzyme, which has not been done before.
