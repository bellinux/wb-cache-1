40|$|As a {{structural}} optimization technique, topology optimization {{is an important}} tool for helping designers to determine the most suitable shape of a structure. With this powerful tool, designers can define families of candidate solutions by modifying the input volume reduction (VR) ratio, reducing the structural weight as much as possible. However, finding the best compromise between material savings and structural performance among these candidate solutions is a critical issue for designers. To deal with this issue, an optimization index (OI) is presented in this paper. It provides a mathematical procedure that highlights the best choice among several candidate solutions obtained by the optimization procedure. The index was originally defined in a previous study on the structural optimization of composite steel-concrete bridges. In this paper, a generalized version of the original optimization index is introduced and used to investigate a particular aspect related to concrete shell-supported bridges. Starting from three shell-supported footbridges, the shapes of which are the final result of form-finding optimization procedures, different starting models are defined, and each is characterized by different edge-stiffening conditions. Despite using an <b>anticlastic</b> <b>shell</b> shape, unavoidable tensile stresses occur because of {{the thickness of the}} shell, variations in the material, the loading of the deck, and other factors. For each starting model, a finite-element topological optimization conducted with the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) method is performed to minimize the weight (i. e., volume) of the shell by a certain percentage. According to the results obtained from topology optimization, the proposed generalized optimization index (OIâˆ—) analytical formulation is discussed in detail, and its effectiveness is validated...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new form}} finding approach {{for the design of}} flexible formwork, consisting of pre-stressed structural membranes, for the construction of thin, <b>anticlastic,</b> concrete <b>shells.</b> The approach is based on the Force Density Method [1] and an adaptation of the non-linear extension of Thrust Network Analysis (TNA) [2]. First, the adaptation of the basic version of TNA to tension-only structures is discussed, and fundamental assumptions formulated. Key aspects herein are the use of reciprocal diagrams and the control of forces in indeterminate networks. Then, the strategy using an overall optimization process, for finding the closest possible tension-only, equilibrium surface to a given target surface under the appropriate loading (i. e. weight of the concrete), is presented. Finally, the strategy is applied to a chosen target surface and loads, and the equilibrium solutions for different starting points of the optimization process are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Ever since Lucio Blandini {{developed}} a doubly curved synclastic shell with adhesively bonded glass components, {{the concept of}} building a self-supporting glass-only shell has almost become within reach. In the current contribution a small-scaled experimental concept is presented of a self-supporting <b>anticlastic</b> all-glass <b>shell</b> scale model, created {{by means of an}} adaptable mould. First, different manufacturing parameters of relatively small shells are investigated, such as mould type, glass supporting system and dimensions, oven temperature and shell curvature. Next, an adjustable mould for the bending of glass is developed, built and tested. With this mould it is possible to make glass panels synclastic and anticlastic in a great variety of forms. With this new moulding technique we were able to create different prototypes. They are forming the basis an intended larger shell, composed of smaller segments. The objective is to join the latter by using fusing techniques, which result is completely transparent monolithic all-glass shells. Therefore, additional experiments have been performed to explore different variants of glass fusion techniques to be applied for double curved glass shells...|$|R
