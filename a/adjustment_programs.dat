ISI works by having the state lead economic development through nationalization, subsidization of vital industries (including agriculture, power generation, etc.), increased taxation, and highly protectionist trade policies. Import substitution industrialization was gradually abandoned by developing countries in the 1980s and 1990s due to the insistence of the IMF and World Bank on their structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>programs</b> of global market-driven liberalization aimed at the Global South.|$|E
25|$|The World Bank, a United Nations {{specialized}} agency, {{has been}} a primary force in promoting the Habitat conferences, and since the first Habitat conference has used their declarations {{as a framework for}} issuing loans for urban infrastructure. The bank's structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>programs</b> contributed to urbanization in the Third World by creating incentives to move to cities. The World Bank and UN-Habitat in 1999 jointly established the Cities Alliance (based at the World Bank headquarters in Washington, D.C.) to guide policymaking, knowledge sharing, and grant distribution around the issue of urban poverty. (UN-Habitat plays an advisory role in evaluating the quality of a locality's governance.) The Bank's policies have tended to focus on bolstering real estate markets through credit and technical assistance.|$|E

The paper establishes a trilateral game model on pricing <b>adjustment</b> <b>program</b> participants, including governments, public transport enterprise and passengers. Through analyzing trilateral benefits, the model can conclude if an <b>adjustment</b> <b>program</b> succeeds or not. Furthermore, adopting the modeling method of Stackelberg oligopoly model, applying backward induction method in model analysis, the model presents an evaluation method for estimating whether the public transit pricing <b>adjustment</b> <b>program</b> is successful or not. The work provides a research method for studying the feasibility of an urban transportation pricing <b>adjustment</b> <b>program...</b>|$|R

Our find ings are based on analyzing the literature regard ing (a) the possibility and consequences of a Greek exit from the Eurozone, (b) the viab ility of the Greek economy given the <b>adjustment</b> <b>program,</b> and (c) the magnitude of the discussion regarding Greece's troubled economy before and during the crisis period...|$|R

500|$|The act largely {{retains the}} {{existing}} structure of Medicare, Medicaid, and the employer market, but individual markets were radically overhauled around a three-legged scheme. Insurers in these markets {{are made to}} accept all applicants and charge the same rates regardless of pre-existing conditions or sex. To combat resultant adverse selection, the act mandates that individuals buy insurance and insurers cover a list of [...] "essential health benefits". To help households between 100–400% of the Federal Poverty Line afford these compulsory policies, the law provides insurance premium subsidies. Other individual market changes include health marketplaces and risk <b>adjustment</b> <b>programs.</b>|$|E
2500|$|During the 1980s {{the bank}} {{emphasized}} lending to service Third-World debt, and structural adjustment policies designed {{to streamline the}} economies of developing nations.

2500|$|It {{is claimed}} that conditionalities retard social {{stability}} and hence inhibit the stated {{goals of the}} IMF, while Structural <b>Adjustment</b> <b>Programs</b> {{lead to an increase}} in poverty in recipient countries. The IMF sometimes advocates [...] "austerity programmes", cutting public spending and increasing taxes even when the economy is weak, to bring budgets closer to a balance, thus reducing budget deficits. Countries are often advised to lower their corporate tax rate. In Globalization and Its Discontents, Joseph E. Stiglitz, former chief economist and senior vice-president at the World Bank, criticises these policies. He argues that by converting to a more monetarist approach, the purpose of the fund is no longer valid, as it was designed to provide funds for countries to carry out Keynesian reflations, and that the IMF [...] "was not participating in a conspiracy, but it was reflecting the interests and ideology of the Western financial community".|$|E

40|$|Nigeria {{adopted and}} {{implemented}} four fixed medium-term national development plans between 1960 and 1985 {{with a view}} to ultimately achieving optimum societal wellbeing. However, due to the economic problems of the 1980 s, an extensive structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>program</b> (SAP) was put in place in 1986. Among other things, SAP was meant to restructure and diversify the Nigerian economy. This paper empirically analyzes the impact of the four plans and the structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>program</b> on aggregate economic activity in Nigeria. The study employs a growth equation that contains major macroeconomic variables such as credit to private sector, foreign direct investment and foreign trade as well as dummy variables that capture eras of the four fixed medium-term national development plans and the structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>program.</b> Contemporary econometric techniques of co integration and autoregressive modeling form part of the methodology for this study. The study is based on annual time series data from 1960 to 2009 obtained from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The estimates of the study, among other things, reveal that the fixed medium-term national development plans in general had no significant impact on aggregate economic activity in Nigeria whereas the structural <b>adjustment</b> <b>program</b> had some significant positive impact on aggregate economic activity in the country. Thus there is need for optimum state planning in the country, especially if the planning is for fixed medium-term. In general, there is need for optimal management of the country’s economy...|$|R

This study utilized enrollment and claims data for one insurer and employs graphical analysis to test for adverse selection. Previous studies have been unable to utilize actual insurer data to test for adverse selection in under the ACA risk <b>adjustment</b> <b>program.</b> Until the implementation of the ACA, insurers relied on underwriting methods to avoid being adversely selected. The ACA has removed the underwriting model by requiring insurers to move to a community rated model for pricing plans. This approach, along with risk adjustment was intended, by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to attract insurers to participate in the individual health insurance marketplaces. Unfortunately, not all states enjoyed a large contingent of participating insurers which consequently had a dramatic financial impact on certain insurers being adversely selected. This dissertation discusses the potential drivers of adverse selection. In addition, the study examines potential improvements to help balance the risk pool and move toward the intended goal of risk adjustment...|$|R
