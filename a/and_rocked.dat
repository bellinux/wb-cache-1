However, the judges scored the bout 114–114, 114–115, 113–115 in favor of Barrera, in what was justifiably a very, very close, but non-controversial and justifiable win for Barrera.

25|$|Although Kelly may {{be better}} known for his paintings, he also worked at {{sculpture}} throughout his career. In 1958, Kelly conceived {{one of his first}} wood sculptures, Concorde Relief I (1958), a modestly scaled wall relief in elm, which explores the visual play and balance between two rectangular forms layered on top of each other, the uppermost with its top-right and lower-left corners removed. He made 30 sculptures in wood throughout his career. From 1959 onwards, he created freestanding folded sculptures. The Rocker series began in 1959 after Kelly's casual conversation with Agnes Martin, who lived below him on Coenties Slip in Lower Manhattan. Playing with the paper top from a take-out coffee cup, Kelly cut and folded a section of the round object, which he then put on the table <b>and</b> <b>rocked</b> back and forth. Soon after, he constructed his first sculpture-in-the-round, Pony. The title refers to a child's hobby horse with curving rocker supports.|$|E
25|$|Although {{much closer}} to the epicenter, the states of Jalisco, Colima, Guerrero and Michoacán {{suffered}} only mild to moderate damage. Landslides caused damage at Atenquique, Jalisco, and near Jala, Nayarit. Rockslides were reported along highways near Ixtapa, Guerrero, with sand volcanos and ground cracks in Lazaro Cardenas. Students at the Universidad de las Américas in nearby Puebla reported feeling as if the cafeteria had been lifted <b>and</b> <b>rocked</b> back and forth, shattering windows and injuring some people but mostly causing panic. A small tsunami caused only mild damage to Lázaro Cárdenas and Zihuatanejo. Some fishing boats were reported missing but these reports were never confirmed. One exceptional case was in Ciudad Guzmán, Jalisco, where about 60 percent of the buildings were destroyed, with about 50 dead. Some damage also occurred as far away as the states of Mexico, Morelos and parts of Veracruz, on the Gulf coast. Coastal and most inland damage was moderated by {{the fact that most of}} the west of Mexico sits on bedrock, which serves to transmit the shockwaves without amplifying them. La Villita, and Infiernillo Dams, near the coast, were superficially damaged and undamaged respectively.|$|E

Salon writer Nellie Engoron acclaimed the episode, while pointing out that [...] "with this episode’s tilt of the seesaw back to the older generation from the flailing youngsters, we’re reminded that while the 1960s saw a cultural shift towards youth, like a drunk, no historical change walks a straight line. For all the claims that Don and others have made that the “kids” increasingly hold the cards, the real truth (if we’re telling it) is that older white guys like Bert and Roger never truly lost power, even if they began to hide behind the scenes while fresh young faces took the public glory." ...|$|E

500|$|After being rested against Surrey, the {{following}} match was against Gloucestershire at Bristol, where in only five hours, Morris scored his career best of 290. Having lost the opening two {{games of the}} series, England were contemplating changes to their team: Tom Goddard was tipped to replace Jim Laker as the off spinner, having been in prolific form in county cricket. The English hoped {{that he would be}} the weapon to cut through Australia's strong batting line-up. Morris' assault ended Goddard's hopes of Test selection. His innings was highlighted by his quick assessment of the pitch of the ball, followed by decisive footwork. Morris confidently went out of his crease when the ball was of a full length <b>and</b> <b>rocked</b> onto the back foot to drive and cut if it was short. On many occasions, he hit Goddard on the full. Unable to contain Morris, Goddard packed the leg side field and bowled outside leg stump. Morris stepped down the wicket, repeatedly lofting the ball over the off side. Morris reached his century by lunch and was 231 by the tea interval. By the time he was dismissed, he had struck 40 fours and a six. Fingleton said that [...] "Morris flayed it [...] in all directions", while former English Test paceman Maurice Tate said [...] "Tom [...] is not used to batsmen using their feet to him ... the county batsmen diddle and diddle [...] to him and that gets him many wickets."

When writing the second season, Daniel Cerone said that the writers [...] "didn't see the opportunity in the second book" [...] to continue on the path that they hoped to go down and chose to depart from Lindsay's second Dexter novel, Dearly Devoted Dexter. Instead, they chose [...] "to turn our biggest card up - [...] "What if Dexter's bodies were discovered?" [...] - and just chart that course throughout the season." [...] According to executive producer Clyde Phillips, they decided to resume the second season storyline five weeks after season one's finale [...] "so all of the emotional resonance of what each [...] went through [...] will continue as if that were the actual passage of time, so they're still dented <b>and</b> <b>rocked</b> by what has happened." [...] Cerone added that [...] "The nice thing with Dexter is it's actually the lack of emotional resonance." [...] Speaking about Dexter's situation {{at the beginning of the}} second season, Hall said, [...] "I think his world is pretty rocked. He encountered , a person he never anticipated encountering, someone who sees him for who he is, accepts him as such, and he really has no choice but to do him in ... he's still reeling from that, and any footing he's able to establish for himself is pretty much immediately pulled out from under him." ...|$|E

40|$|Jazz <b>and</b> <b>rock</b> {{have been}} {{historically}} treated as separate musical traditions, despite having many similar musical and cultural characteristics, {{as well as}} sharing significant periods of interaction and overlap throughout popular music history. The rift between jazz <b>and</b> <b>rock,</b> <b>and</b> jazz <b>and</b> <b>rock</b> scholarship, {{is based on a}} set of received assumptions as to why jazz <b>and</b> <b>rock</b> are different. However, these assumptions are not naturally inherent to the two genres, but are instead the result of a discursive construction that defines them in contrast to one another. Furthermore, the roots of this discursive divide {{are to be found in}} the history of popular music journalism. In this thesis I challenge the traditional divide between jazz <b>and</b> <b>rock</b> by examining five historical case studies in American jazz <b>and</b> <b>rock</b> journalism. My underlying argument is that we cannot take for granted the fact that jazz <b>and</b> <b>rock</b> would ultimately become separate discourses: what are now represented as inevitable musical and cultural divergences between the two genres were actually constructed under very particular institutional and historical forces. There are other ways popular music history could have been written (and has been written) that call the oppositional representation of jazz <b>and</b> <b>rock</b> into question. The case studies focus on the two oldest surviving and most influential jazz <b>and</b> <b>rock</b> periodicals: Down Beat and Rolling Stone. I examine the role of critics in developing a distinction between the two genres that would eventually be reproduced in the academic scholarship of jazz <b>and</b> <b>rock.</b> I also demonstrate how the formation of jazz <b>and</b> <b>rock</b> as genres has been influenced by non-musicological factors, not least of all by music magazines as commercial institutions trying to survive and compete in the American press industry.

Current research is focusing on the waste flows of construction material and little is known about the overall management practices of excavated soil <b>and</b> <b>rock.</b> Clearly, excavated soil <b>and</b> <b>rock</b> are often disposed at landfills and the recycling rate for high quality purposes is low.
