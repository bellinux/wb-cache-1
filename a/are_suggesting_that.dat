25|$|Evolutionary {{researchers}} {{have suggested that}} men and women have innate mechanisms that contribute to why they become sexually jealous, especially for certain types of infidelity. It has been hypothesized that heterosexual men have developed an innate psychological mechanism that responds to the threat of sexual infidelity more than emotional infidelity, and vice versa for heterosexual women. This is because it is thought that the threat of cuckoldry is more detrimental to the male, who could potentially invest in offspring that is another male's, and for females, emotional infidelity would be more worrisome because they could lose the parental investment in their offspring for another woman's offspring, therefore affecting their chances of survival. However the evidence for this gender difference is debatable, as new findings <b>are</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> more and more men and women today would find emotional infidelity psychologically worse (Harris, 2002).|$|E
500|$|In 1998, a Swedish study {{reported}} trace amounts of phenethylamine in P. semilanceata up to 146 microg/g wet weight which the authors refereed to as [...] "high amount of PEA" [...] that play a possible role in adverse reactions. However, a typical dose of 30 grams of fresh mushrooms will correspond to maximum 4.38 mg phenethylamine. The authors mention that phenethylamine is rapidly inactivated through metabolic breakdown by monoamine oxidase (MAO), but <b>are</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> {{there may be}} an interaction between phenylethylamine and psilocin (the metabolic breakdown product of psilocybin) through competitive inhibition of monoamine oxidase enzymes. The issue has been described by the United Nations/CCOHS joint project IPCS INCHEM in a monograph, and by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA).|$|E

500|$|At her {{deportation}} {{hearing on}} October 27, Goldman {{refused to answer}} questions about her beliefs on the grounds that her American citizenship invalidated any attempt to deport her under the Anarchist Exclusion Act, which could be enforced only against non-citizens of the US. She presented a written statement instead: [...] "Today so-called aliens are deported. Tomorrow native Americans will be banished. Already some patrioteers <b>are</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> native American sons to whom democracy is a sacred ideal should be exiled." [...] Louis Post at the Department of Labor, which had ultimate authority over deportation decisions, determined that the revocation of her husband's American citizenship in 1908 after his conviction had revoked hers as well. After initially promising a court fight, she decided not to appeal his ruling.|$|E
500|$|Decades later, {{there is}} no {{consensus}} among researchers over Murphy and Lucas's investigation and findings. Richard G. Fernicola published two studies of the event, and notes that [...] "there are many theories behind the New Jersey attacks," [...] and all are inconclusive. Researchers such as Thomas Helm, Harold W. McCormick, Thomas B. Allen, William Young, Jean Campbell Butler, and Michael Capuzzo generally agree with Murphy and Lucas. However, the National Geographic Society reported in 2002 that [...] "some experts <b>are</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> the great white may not in fact be responsible for many of the attacks pinned on the species. These people say the real culprit behind many of the reported incidents—including the famous 1916 shark attacks in New Jersey that may have served as inspiration for Jaws—may be the lesser known bull shark." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although sexual {{selection}} {{plays a major}} role in the development of feathers, in particular the color of the feathers it is not the only conclusion available. New studies <b>are</b> <b>suggesting</b> <b>that</b> the unique feathers of birds is also a large influence on many important aspects of avian behavior, such as the height at which a different species build their nests. Since females are the prime care givers, evolution has helped select females to display duller colored down so that they may blend into the nesting environment. The position of the nest and whether it has a greater chance of being under predation has exerted constraints on female birds' plumage. A species of bird that nests on the ground, rather than the canopy of the trees, will need to have much duller colors in order not to attract attention to the nest. Since the female is the main care giver in some species of birds, evolution has helped select traits that make her feathers dull and often allow her to blend into the surroundings. The height study found that birds that nest in the canopies of trees often have many more predator attacks due to the brighter color of feathers that the female displays. Another influence of evolution that could play a part in why feathers of birds are so colorful and display so many patterns could be due to that birds developed their bright colors from the vegetation and flowers that thrive around them. Birds develop their bright colors from living around certain colors. Most bird species often blend into their environment, due to some degree of camouflage, so if the species habitat is full of colors and patterns, the species would eventually evolve to blend in to avoid being eaten. [...] Birds' feathers show a large range of colors, even exceeding the variety of many plants, leaf and flower colors.|$|E
