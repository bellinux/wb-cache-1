2500|$|Rosette, {{lower and}} {{intermediate}} pitchers remain unknown {{as they do}} not form part of the examined herbarium material. Upper pitchers are subcylindrical with an ellipsoid base. They measure [...] 16.4cm in height by 5.5cm in width. They are broadest in the basal portion, becoming slightly constricted in the middle (4.1 cm wide), and expanding again to around 5cm below the peristome. Sessile glands {{similar to those found}} on the stem are also present on the exterior of the upper pitchers, where they occur at a density of 3–4 per mm². In these <b>aerial</b> <b>traps</b> the wings are reduced to a pair of ridges on the ventral surface of the pitcher cup. The pitcher mouth is [...] and has an oblique insertion. It measures around 6cm by 4cm. The peristome is cylindrical in cross section and slightly lobed, with tightly infolded inner and outer margins. It is rather narrow, measuring only 2.5–4mm in diameter. The peristome bears low ribs only 0.1mm high. These are tightly packed, occurring at a density of two per millimetre. The inner margin of the peristome lacks conspicuous teeth. The peristome is elongated into a short neck and here the apertures of the marginal nectar glands are clearly visible.|$|E

40|$|In fine warm weather, {{the daytime}} {{convective}} atmosphere over land areas {{is full of}} small migrant insects, among them serious pests (e. g. some species of aphid), but also many beneficial species (e. g. natural enemies of pests). For many years intensive <b>aerial</b> <b>trapping</b> studies were {{the only way of}} determining the density profiles of these small insects, and for taxon-specific studies trapping is still necessary. However, if we wish to determine generic behavioural responses to air movements shown by small day-migrating insects as a whole, the combination of millimetre-wavelength ‘cloud radars’ and Doppler lidar now provides virtually ideal instrumentation. Here we examine the net vertical velocities of > 1 million insect targets, relative to the vertical motion of the air in which they are flying, as a succession of fair-weather convective cells pass over the recording site in Oklahoma, USA. The resulting velocity measurements are interpreted in terms of the flight behaviours of small insects. These behaviours are accounted for by a newly-developed Lagrangian stochastic model of weakly-flying insect movements in the convective boundary layer; a model which is consistent with classic characterisations of small insect aerial density profiles. We thereby link patterns to processes...|$|R
40|$|Effects of {{temperature}} and precipitation on the temporal patterns of dispersing tobacco thrips, Frankliniella fusca, and onion thrips, Thrips tabaci, caught on yellow sticky traps were estimated {{in central and}} eastern North Carolina and eastern Virginia from 1997 through 2001. The impact that these environmental factors had on numbers of F. fusca and T. tabaci caught on sticky traps during April and May was determined using stepwise regression analysis of 43 and 38 site-years of <b>aerial</b> <b>trapping</b> data from 21 and 18 different field locations, respectively. The independent variables used in the regression models included degree-days, total precipitation, and the number of days in which precipitation occurred during January through May. Each variable was significant in explaining variation for both thrips species and, in all models, degree-days was the single best explanatory variable. Precipitation had a comparatively greater effect on T. tabaci than F. fusca. The numbers of F. fusca and T. tabaci captured in flight were positively related to degree-days and the number of days with precipitation but negatively related to total precipitation. Combined in a single model, degree-days, total precipitation, and the number of days with precipitation explained 70 and 55 % of the total variation in the number of F. fusca captured from 1 April through 10 May and from 1 April through 31 May, respectively. Regarding T. tabaci flights, degree-days, total precipitation, and the number of days with precipitation collectively explained 57 and 63 % of the total variation in the number captured from 1 April through 10 May and from 1 April through 31 May, respectivel...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Pheidole obscurithorax, the South-American big-headed ant, is {{native to}} South America, but now common along the United States Gulf Coast region. Although the major and minor workers castes have been described, {{reproductive}} castes have not. The spread of exotic and potentially invasive ant species that disperse by flight can be monitored in part {{through the use of}} various <b>aerial</b> and light <b>traps.</b> However, due to a paucity of descriptions of reproductive castes of ants in general, identifications of these castes from traps are difficult at best. To better facilitate the identification of P. obscurithorax and its spread in the Gulf Coast region of the US, the queen caste of the exotic Pheidole obscurithorax is described.

50|$|The pitcher fluid of N. flava {{is highly}} viscous and coats the inner pitcher walls. This is {{especially}} true of <b>aerial</b> <b>traps,</b> which must contend with the action of the wind.

It has been suggested that the pitchers of this species function not only as pitfall traps but also as flypaper traps. Indeed, this trapping method is employed by the closely related N. inermis, which also produces highly viscous pitcher fluid.|$|E
40|$|Effective entomological {{surveillance}} planning stresses {{a careful}} consideration of methodology, trapping technologies, and analysis techniques. Herein, {{the basic principles}} and technological components of arthropod surveillance plans are described, as promoted in the symposium "Advancements in arthropod monitoring technology, techniques, and analysis" presented at the 58 th {{annual meeting of the}} Entomological Society of America in San Diego, CA. Interdisciplinary examples of arthropod monitoring for urban, medical, and veterinary applications are reviewed. Arthropod surveillance consists of the three components: 1) sampling method, 2) trap technology, and 3) analysis technique. A sampling method consists of selecting the best device or collection technique for a specific location and sampling at the proper spatial distribution, optimal duration, and frequency to achieve the surveillance objective. Optimized sampling methods are discussed for several mosquito species (Diptera: Culicidae) and ticks (Acari: Ixodidae). The advantages and limitations of novel terrestrial and <b>aerial</b> insect <b>traps,</b> artificial pheromones and kairomones are presented for the capture of red flour beetle (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), small hive beetle (Coleoptera: Nitidulidae), bed bugs (Hemiptera: Cimicidae), and Culicoides (Diptera: Ceratopogonidae) respectively. After sampling, extrapolating real world population numbers from trap capture data are possible with the appropriate analysis techniques. Examples of this extrapolation and action thresholds are given for termites (Isoptera: Rhinotermitidae) and red flour beetles.

50|$|This {{technique}} {{was developed in}} Knoxville, Tennessee in 1989, and in the pilot study {{was found to be}} more effective than using an <b>aerial</b> net. The <b>traps</b> are constructed using manufactured sticky traps measuring approximately 9 in by 10 in in the shape of an inverted “V”, or pup tent, with the sticky material on the outside (see fig 1).These traps generally have four clothespins clipped to the bottom corners to provide ground clearance. The traps are placed at varying distances from the body, between 1 ft and 12 ft, with one side facing the body. The sides of the traps should be set at a 60 degree angle. When collection is done the sticky trap should be labeled with both the time it was put out and the time it was picked up. In the lab insect can be individually removed and rinsed with paint thinner or xylene before preservation.|$|R

We found that about 25 % of juvenile orb-weaving spiders' diet consisted of pollen, the other 75 % of flying insects, mainly small dipterans and hymenopterans. The pollen grains in our study were too large to be taken up accidentally by the spiders and had first to be digested extraorally by enzymes in an active act of consumption.
