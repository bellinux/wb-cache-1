5|$|St. Laurent {{tried to}} project an image as <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>man,</b> {{and to that}} end often {{addressed}} schoolchildren. As he had in previous elections, he spoke to small groups of children regarding Canadian history or civics. The strategy backfired while addressing children in Port Hope, Ontario. With the children inattentive, some playing tag or sticking cameras in his face, St. Laurent angrily told them that it was their loss {{if they did not}} pay attention, as the country would be theirs to worry about far longer than it would be his.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, Hammer {{signed a}} book {{contract}} with publishing company Simon & Schuster {{which called for}} a release the following year. However, a manuscript for an inspirational book called Enemies of the Father: Messages from the Heart on Being <b>a</b> <b>Family</b> <b>Man</b> (addressing the situation of African American men), for which Hammer received advance money to write, was never submitted in 2003. This resulted in Hammer being sued by the book company over claims that he never finished the book as promised. The company's March 2009 lawsuit sought return of the US$61,000 advance given to Hammer for the unwritten book about fatherhood.|$|E
25|$|Jackie Earle Haley as Guerrero – an ex-assassin {{formerly}} {{employed by}} the Old Man, who also went rogue alongside Chance after {{he was ordered to}} kill Katherine Walters when Chance refused to do it. Guerrero works as part of the team, and despite his complicated nature, cares greatly about Winston and Chance, considering the former a friend and secretly protecting the latter from the Old Man's agents. Outwardly, Guerrero appears weak and nerdy when in reality he is actually a highly intelligent, vicious, and deadly killer. Despite this, he is deeply loyal to his friends and <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>man</b> with a child of his own. He helps Chance and Winston in their missions by using his underworld contacts, as an accomplished computer hacker, and is also an expert in torturing people for information.|$|E
25|$|Whatever {{residual}} fears many in England {{may have}} felt {{at the prospect of}} being ruled by a Scot, James's arrival aroused a mood of high expectation. The twilight years of Elizabeth had been a disappointment; and for a nation troubled for so many years by the question of succession, the new king was <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>man</b> who already had male heirs in the wing. But James's honeymoon was of very short duration; and his initial political actions were to do much to create the rather negative tone which was to turn a successful Scottish king into a disappointing English one. The greatest and most obvious of these was the question of his exact status and title. James intended to be King of Great Britain and Ireland. His first obstacle along this imperial road was the attitude of the English Parliament.|$|E

25|$|Uthman was <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>man</b> who {{apparently}} led a simple life even after becoming the Caliph of the Rashidun Empire {{and regardless of}} the fact that he was rich due to his flourishing family business. The caliphs were paid for their services from bait al-mal, the public treasury, but Uthman never took any salary for his service as a Caliph, as he was independently wealthy. Uthman was also a humanitarian: He developed a custom to free slaves every Friday, look after the widows and orphans, and give unlimited charity. His patience and endurance were among the characteristics that made him a successful leader. As a way of taking care of Muhammad's wives, he doubled their allowances. Uthman wasn't completely plain and simple, however: Uthman built a Palace for himself in Medina, known as Al-Zawar, with a notable feature being doors of precious wood. Although Uthman paid for the palace with his own money, Shia Muslims considered it his first step towards ruling like a King.|$|E
25|$|Stravinsky proved {{adept at}} playing {{the part of}} a 'man of the world', {{acquiring}} a keen instinct for business matters and appearing relaxed and comfortable in public. His successful career as a pianist and conductor took him to many of the world's major cities, including Paris, Venice, Berlin, London, Amsterdam and New York and he was known for his polite, courteous and helpful manner. Stravinsky was reputed to have been a philanderer and was rumoured to have had affairs with high-profile partners, such as Coco Chanel. He never referred to it himself, but Chanel spoke about the alleged affair at length to her biographer Paul Morand in 1946; the conversation was published thirty years later. The accuracy of Chanel's claims has been disputed by both Stravinsky's widow, Vera, and by Craft. Chanel's fashion house avers {{there is no evidence that}} any affair between Chanel and Stravinsky ever occurred. A fictionalization of the supposed affair formed the basis of the novel Coco and Igor (2002) and a film, Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky (2009). Despite these alleged liaisons, Stravinsky was considered <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>man</b> and devoted to his children.|$|E
25|$|Mixing {{deduction}} and character-driven drama, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation {{follows a}} team of crime-scene investigators, employed by the Las Vegas Police Department, as they use physical evidence to solve murders. The team is originally led by Gil Grissom (William Petersen), a socially awkward forensic entomologist and career criminalist who is promoted to CSI supervisor {{following the death of}} a trainee investigator. Grissom's second-in-command, Catherine Willows (Marg Helgenberger), is a single mother with a cop's instinct. Born and raised in Vegas, Catherine was a stripper before being recruited into law enforcement and training as a blood-spatter specialist. Following Grissom's departure during the ninth season of the series, Catherine is promoted to supervisor. After overseeing the training of new investigator Raymond Langston (Laurence Fishburne), Willows is replaced by D.B. Russell (Ted Danson), and recruited to the FBI shortly thereafter. Russell is <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>man,</b> a keen forensic botanist and a veteran of the Seattle Crime Lab. In the series' 12th season, Russell is reunited with his former partner Julie Finlay (Elisabeth Shue), who like Catherine, is a blood-spatter expert with an extensive knowledge of criminal psychology. Together {{with the rest of the}} team, they work together to tackle Las Vegas' growing crime rate and are on the case 24/7, scouring the scene, collecting the evidence, and finding the missing pieces that will solve the mystery.|$|E

500|$|Created by Moore and Bolland {{as their}} own take on the Joker's source and psychology, the story became famous for its origin of the Joker as a tragic character; <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>man</b> and failed comedian who {{suffered}} [...] "one bad day" [...] that finally drove him insane. Moore stated that he attempted to show the similarities and contrasts between the two characters. The story's effects on the mainstream Batman continuity also included the shooting and paralysis of Barbara Gordon (a.k.a. Batgirl), an event that {{laid the groundwork for}} her to develop the identity of Oracle.|$|E

Synchronic with the lyrics relating to [...] "winter" [...] ("freeze"; [...] "no leaves on the trees") in this verse, some of the mise-en-scene is minimal. It shows his father as <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>man</b> during the day but an abusive alcoholic all the time. The line [...] "He hit me again, and again, and again" [...] {{is accompanied by a}} baseball scene, rather than visually depicting the violence of [...] "hit" [...] that the autobiographical elements suggest.|$|E

500|$|With {{the help}} of the Kansas City Democratic machine led by Tom Pendergast, Truman was elected in 1922 as County Court judge of Jackson County's eastern district—this was an {{administrative}} rather than judicial position, somewhat similar to county commissioners elsewhere. [...] (At the time Jackson County elected a judge from the western district (Kansas City), one from the eastern district (Jackson County outside Kansas City), and a presiding judge elected countywide.) Truman was not re-elected in 1924, losing in a Republican wave led by President Calvin Coolidge's landslide election to a full term. Two years selling automobile club memberships convinced him that a public service career was safer for <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>man</b> approaching middle age, and he planned a run for presiding judge in 1926.|$|E
500|$|John Dudley was an {{imposing}} figure {{with a strong}} temperament who could also charm people with his courtesy and a graceful presence. He was <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>man,</b> an understanding father and husband who was passionately loved by his wife. Frequent phases of illness, partly due to a stomach ailment, occasioned long absences from court but did not reduce his high output of paperwork, and may have had an element of hypochondria in them. The English diplomat Richard Morrison wrote of his onetime superior: [...] "This Earl had such a head that he seldom went about anything but he had three or four purposes beforehand." [...] A French eyewitness of 1553 described him as [...] "an intelligent man who could explain his ideas and who displayed an impressive dignity. Others, {{who did not know}} him, would have considered him worthy of a kingdom." ...|$|E
500|$|Over {{his career}} he {{acquired}} significant wealth, and funded {{a number of}} churches and other prestigious buildings. He often worked with the Jesuits, including funding their College in Kražiai. He strongly believed his service for the state should be rewarded with land grants, {{but at the same}} time he would often use his own money to pay for the army's military expenses. In his private life he is remembered as a very proud individual, and for stressing his identity as a member of the Lithuanian nobility. He was <b>a</b> <b>family</b> <b>man,</b> devoted to his family, but his only son, from his marriage in 1593 to Zofia Mielecka, died aged 16 in 1613, and she died in 1618. He remarried in 1620, wedding Anna Alojza Ostrogska in [...] November 1620, shortly before departing on his final campaign.

5000|$|The Kanun {{dictates}} that families must be patrilineal (meaning wealth is inherited through <b>a</b> <b>family's</b> <b>men)</b> and patrilocal (upon marriage, a woman {{moves into the}} household of her husband's family).
