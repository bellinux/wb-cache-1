50|$|Dyce Juniors were {{established}} in 1989 following the amalgamation of two existing sides, Mugiemoss F.C. (founded 1887) and Rosslyn Sport F.C. (founded 1923 as Rosemount). The merger was spurred by problems both clubs faced concerning their home grounds. The Linksfield Stadium facility in Aberdeen, which Mugiemoss shared with two other sides, Lewis United and Parkvale, was due to undergo redevelopment, {{reducing the number of}} pitches available. Rosslyn Sport were struggling to maintain their own Rosslyn Park ground in Dyce. With both sides wishing to retain their own name, a compromise of Dyce Juniors was chosen and the club set up at Rosslyn Park. Within one season, disagreements <b>at</b> <b>committee</b> <b>level</b> led to the resignation of the previous Rosslyn Sport officials, leaving the club as essentially Mugiemoss F.C. playing under the Dyce Juniors banner. The Dyceclub colours are blue and white hoops, but have retained the Mugiemoss tradition by using their black and white stripes as the change kit. The Rosslyn Park ground continued to prove troublesome, requiring new dressing rooms to be constructed and in 2000 the stadium was renamed Ian Mair Park in memory of a club official who died.|$|E
5000|$|When rugby union turned {{professional}} in the mid-1990s, {{it quickly became}} clear that Aberavon RFC had neither the financial resources nor the ambition, at least <b>at</b> <b>committee</b> <b>level,</b> to seek {{a return to the}} upper echelon of the Welsh club game, instead appearing to settle for a regular position in the second tier, much to the frustration of their loyal supporter base. Financial difficulties encountered by several Welsh clubs, most notably by neighbours and great rivals Neath who went bust on at least two occasion (only to be [...] "bailed out" [...] by the WRU and a team of local businessmen), served only to reinforce this cautious approach until the realization that in such circumstances club committee members may find themselves liable for uncleared debts. This in turn led to the club being incorporated as a limited company run by a board of directors, which was essentially what the players were seeking in 1988. With a management structure more aligned to the professional era now in place, there followed a highly successful period under coach Chris O'Callaghan (who had been one of those players to have left the club in frustration twelve years earlier, and who had been approached by the club's committee in November 1999 to take the helm following a string of disastrous results), but promotion to the game's top tier was then repeatedly blocked by successive rule changes made by the Welsh Rugby Union (on one occasion {{a matter of a few}} weeks before the season ended), until the game in Wales was restructured in 2003, at which point Aberavon RFC found itself frustratingly outside looking in as the new professional [...] "regions" [...] were set up.|$|E
40|$|M. A. (Public Management and Governance) This {{research}} is {{an assessment of}} the level of goal achievement by the Gauteng Provincial Legislature’s (GPL) Infrastructure Development Portfolio Committee (IDCP). The overall aim is to determine the effectiveness of the Portfolio Committee, the reasons behind the discovered level of performance, and how to improve the status quo. Research findings reveal that the IDPC managed to achieve 61 % of its targets over a four-year period (2009 - 2014). This is a fairly respectable achievement considering that the Portfolio Committee was only established in the current legislative term. Research findings also reveal a number of factors to support this achievement, such as capacity issues for both Members of the Provincial Legislature (MPLs) and staff and the institution’s congested programme. Quite a number of these factors need to be addressed at institutional level, including capacitation of MPLs and administrative support staff, the GPL’s congested programme, and the identification of relevant stakeholders. However, there are issues that can be addressed <b>at</b> <b>committee</b> <b>level</b> and include engaging in law making discussions, providing feedback to stakeholders on a regular basis and systematically, and gathering more independent information for verification purposes...|$|E

40|$|The U. S. {{motor vehicle}} {{manufacturing}} industry employs about 1 millions workers, or about 7. 5 % of the entire U. S. manufacturing workforce, including those who work in manufacturing parts and bodies, {{as well as those}} who assemble motor vehicles. Since 2000, the industry has eliminated about 300, 000 manufacturing jobs, but the employment level is still almost as high as in 1990. By comparison, manufacturing in general has suffered a much higher rate of job loss. The Detroit-based U. S. -owned manufacturers (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler, collectively known as the “Big Three”), all of which are organized by the United Auto Workers union (UAW), have cut back domestic production by 3 million units since 2000, accounting for all the net employment losses. The shift in consumer preferences from trucks and SUVs to smaller vehicles has accelerated a loss of market share by the Big Three producers and gains for foreign-owned domestic manufacturers and imports. Big Three employment losses were partially offset by new investments by foreign-owned manufacturers in the United States. Today, companies owned by foreign investors produce 28 % of all U. S. -made light motor vehicles, up from 11 % in 1990. The patterns of job loss and creation have not been evenly distributed around the country. Forty-four percent of all persons in the industry work in a “heartland auto belt” of three states, Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana, each of which has more than 100, 000 persons in the industry. Michigan alone has accounted for more than a third of the net job loss in the industry since 2000. Losses in Ohio and Indiana have been less severe, offset somewhat by foreign investment. Alabama has been the big recent job gainer, adding 15, 000 jobs since 2000. Tennessee and Kentucky, now the fourth and fifth largest producing states, have added the most jobs since 1990, and South Carolina has also seen a big net gain. These jobs, mostly non-union, have stretched the “auto belt” more to the South. New fuel economy standards for automobiles and light trucks, as approved by Congress and signed into law (P. L. 110 - 140), may encourage greater development of small, fuel efficient cars, but the number of such U. S. plants, even for foreign-owned companies, has declined in recent years. S. 2191, approved <b>at</b> <b>committee</b> <b>level</b> in the Senate in December 2007, would use funds from the auction of emission allowances to support domestic manufacture of fuel-efficient vehicles and components. Congress may also consider the proposed Korea-U. S. Free Trade Agreement, which addresses the current imbalance in automotive trade. The Employee Free Choice Act (H. R. 800), approved by the House, but on which a cloture vote failed in the Senate, could help the UAW organize foreign-owned companies. In seeking to improve the competitiveness of Big Three assembly operations against both non-union domestic producers and imports, the UAW and the Big Three in 2007 negotiated new contract bargaining agreements. The deals addressed health care costs, wage levels, and other issues...|$|E

40|$|While {{much has}} been written about the {{behavior}} of representatives at the final stages of the legislative process, little has been done to examine their actions <b>at</b> the <b>committee</b> <b>level.</b> This research examines the level of participation of individual members on the House Foreign Affairs Committee in the 107 - 109 th congress (2001 - 2006). Participation was coded on a scale of 0 - 6 using robust standard error regressions with a number of independent variables broken down into three categories including individual characteristics, institutional position, and district characteristics. A total of eleven bills were analyzed covering a variety of foreign policy matters including sanctions, nuclear weapons, and bills to fund the state department. According to the findings, institutional position had the greatest effect in determining at what level a member will participate in the committee. District characteristics had much more varied results, yet representatives who had higher percentages of foreign born people tended to participate in more influential ways. Analyzing representatives’ characteristics on a liberal/conservative dimension suggests more conservative members were more active until the 109 th congress when liberals dominated participation. This suggests a growing dissatisfaction with the Bush Administration among the more liberal members of the Democratic Party. Participation <b>at</b> the <b>committee</b> <b>level</b> thus cannot be explained by one single factor, yet institutional position seems to provide an opportunity for participation that the others do not.

40|$|In Belgium, 2007 {{has been}} marked by long {{coalition}} negotiations over an agreement on a new government. The main bone of contention had been related to the reform of the Belgian Federal State. Among the suggested reforms, the regionalisation of the collective bargaining system turned out frequently. It relies {{on the assumption that the}} productivity differences between regions are not fully taken into account in a federal wage setting system. Our findings challenge this hypothesis by putting forward the current existence of wage differentials between regions and joint committees. We also show that regional wage differentials <b>at</b> the joint <b>committee</b> <b>level</b> are correlated to regional productivity differences. Finally, we find that the correlation between regional wage differentials and productivity is higher in decentralised joint committees. Hence, we conclude that productivity variations are already integrated in the Belgian wage setting system. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
