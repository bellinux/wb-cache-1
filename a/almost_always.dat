5|$|Adams {{has left}} behind a mixed legacy. Most historians applaud him for {{avoiding}} an all-out war with France during his presidency. His signing of the Alien and Sedition Acts is <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> condemned.|$|E
5|$|Head: The {{head has}} large {{compound}} eyes and if mouthparts are present, they are <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> a drinking straw-like proboscis.|$|E
5|$|Helium is <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> placed above neon (which {{is in the}} p-block) in the {{periodic}} table as a noble gas, although it is occasionally placed above beryllium due to their similar electron configuration.|$|E
5000|$|... “At {{the very}} least, the breach of mesirah <b>almost</b> {{certainly}} <b>always</b> leads to shunning and intimidation within the Jewish community and {{would almost certainly}} damage marriage prospects of your children.” ...|$|R
60|$|There was a {{touch of}} sensuality about her lips. The face was too broad across the brow and cheekbones, but the eyes were magnificent--ice-grey, {{sometimes}} <b>almost</b> green, <b>always</b> luminous, and set in with dark lashes.|$|R
60|$|No, I don't. I believe I like him. Yet it's <b>almost</b> unbelievable. I've <b>always</b> thought men so detestable.|$|R
5|$|Love darts {{are shaped}} in many {{distinctive}} ways, and vary considerably between species. The morphology of the dart is <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> species-specific.|$|E
5|$|Most Welsh cottages and farmhouses had a {{spinning}} wheel, <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> operated by women, and most parishes had carders, spinners, weavers and fullers.|$|E
5|$|Specialty {{mixed gas}} {{charging}} will <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> involve supply cylinders of high purity gas sourced from an industrial gas supplier.|$|E
5000|$|Cercignani's {{conjecture}} {{is sometimes}} true and <b>always</b> <b>almost</b> true, Communications in Mathematical Physics, vol. 234, No. 3 (March 2003), pp. 455-490, [...]|$|R
25|$|Adverbs {{are also}} formed with -s, -lies, lins, gate(s)and wey(s) -wey, whiles (at times), mebbes (perhaps), brawlies (splendidly), geylies (pretty well), aiblins (perhaps), airselins (backwards), hauflins (partly), hidlins (secretly), maistlins (<b>almost),</b> awgates (<b>always,</b> everywhere), ilkagate (everywhere), onygate (anyhow), ilkawey (everywhere), onywey (anyhow, anywhere), endweys (straight ahead), whit wey (how, why).|$|R
60|$|How strange it is {{that the}} great {{emotional}} scenes of history, one of which is coming along <b>almost</b> immediately, <b>always</b> begin in this prosaic way Shakespeare tries to conceal the fact, but {{there can be little doubt}} that Romeo and Juliet edged into their balcony scene with a few remarks on the pleasantness of the morning.|$|R
5|$|The two neurotransmitters {{that are}} used most widely in the {{vertebrate}} brain are glutamate, which <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> exerts excitatory effects on target neurons, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> inhibitory. Neurons using these transmitters {{can be found in}} nearly every part of the brain. Because of their ubiquity, drugs that act on glutamate or GABA tend to have broad and powerful effects. Some general anesthetics act by reducing the effects of glutamate; most tranquilizers exert their sedative effects by enhancing the effects of GABA.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most of {{the other}} German half-tracks, the Sd.Kfz. 8 was <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> used as a tractor for heavy {{artillery}} pieces and was not modified for other roles.|$|E
5|$|Hydrochloric acid is {{prepared}} by dissolving hydrogen chloride in water. Hydrogen chloride {{can be generated}} in many ways, and thus several precursors to hydrochloric acid exist. The large-scale production of hydrochloric acid is <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> integrated with the industrial scale production of other chemicals.|$|E
50|$|Tönnies’ Normaltyp {{was thus}} a {{conceptual}} tool created on a logical basis, an <b>almost</b> mathematical concept <b>always</b> open to subsequent refinement from {{a confrontation with}} the empirical evidence.|$|R
25|$|The north {{celestial}} pole is located {{very close to the}} pole star (Polaris or North Star), so from the Northern Hemisphere, all circumpolar stars appear to move around Polaris. Polaris itself remains <b>almost</b> stationary, <b>always</b> at the north (i.e. azimuth of 0°), and always at the same altitude (angle from the horizon), equal to the observer's latitude. These are then classified into quadrants.|$|R
50|$|There is {{very little}} {{recorded}} of {{the first few years}} of Scariff Hurling Club, but it has <b>almost</b> certainly <b>always</b> been a senior club. In 1907, Scariff play in its first Clare Senior Hurling Championship county final, which it won, beating O'Callaghan Mills. It won further senior championships in 1917, 1946, 1952 and 1953 and lost the final in 1918, 1919, 1942, 1943, 1960, 1991 and 1995.|$|R
5|$|In Wicca, salt is {{symbolic}} of the element Earth. It is also believed to cleanse an area of harmful or negative energies. A dish of salt and a dish of water are <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> present on an altar, and salt is used {{in a wide variety}} of rituals and ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|In most situations, revenue-maximizing {{prices are}} not profit-maximizing prices. For example, if {{variable}} costs per unit are nonzero (which they <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> are), then {{a more complex}} computation of a similar kind yields prices that generate optimal profits.|$|E
5|$|Ionic {{compounds}} {{typically have}} high melting and boiling points, and are hard and brittle. As solids they are <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> electrically insulating, but when melted or dissolved they become highly conductive, because the ions are mobilized.|$|E
6000|$|... "Quite true--nor I. Lucy is an {{excellent}} girl, and one is <b>almost</b> certain of <b>always</b> retaining a strong regard for her. How singularly the prospects of the Hardinges are changed by this sudden liking of Mrs. Bradfort!" ...|$|R
5000|$|The Wall Street Journal wrote, [...] "The first totally {{immersive}} home {{virtual reality}} rig is a pricey, awkward, isolating—and occasionally brilliant—glimpse {{of the future}} of computing." [...] The Verge said, [...] "Virtual Reality: 8/10. Virtual reality is <b>always</b> <b>almost</b> here." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{asked about}} being a [...] "social artist" [...] this was his reply:"I'm a social being and I don't {{see how you can}} be an artist and be separate....Artists have eyes...You go home. You see things that are <b>almost</b> forgotten. It's <b>always</b> shocking." ...|$|R
5|$|It {{appears that}} Nri had an artistic {{as well as}} {{religious}} influence on the lower Niger. Sculptures found there are bronze like those at Igbo-Ukwu. The great sculptures of the Benin Empire, by contrast, were <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> brass with, over time, increasingly greater percentages of zinc added.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms can {{be found}} almost {{anywhere}} on Earth. Bacteria and archaea are <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> microscopic, while a number of eukaryotes are also microscopic, including most protists, some fungi, {{as well as some}} micro-animals and plants. Viruses are generally regarded as not living and therefore not considered as microorganisms, although a subfield of microbiology is virology, the study of viruses.|$|E
5|$|Montana sapphires {{in general}} {{come in a}} variety of colors, but Yogos are <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> blue. About two percent of Yogos are purple, due to trace amounts of chromium. A very small number of rubies have been found at Yogo Gulch.|$|E
2500|$|A poet {{of organic}} books, where the whole {{is greater than}} the sum of the {{constituent}} poems, his style is characterized by simplicity and expressive language (<b>almost</b> conversational), <b>always</b> looking for openness, purity and precision, without unnecessary rhetoric, in the tradition of Antonio Machado. That desire led him to remove numerous poems from his latest compilation, making it [...] successively smaller. Some of this can be seen in his famous poem about the hanged François Villon. He preferred to express himself in Arte Mayor and the alexandrine.|$|R
30|$|The {{limiting}} {{processes for}} the electrochemical reactions {{take place at}} the anode. Several models [7, 8, 9, 17, 18, 21] consider the anode as the limiting factor of an MFC, which implies that all concentrations in the cathode are the maximum admissible and remain <b>always</b> <b>almost</b> constant.|$|R
60|$|Maikar was one {{of those}} men--of whom there are no doubt thousands--who powerfully appreciate, <b>almost</b> venerate, and <b>always</b> recognise, the spirit of justice when {{displayed}} by their fellows, although they may not always be {{aware of the fact that}} they do recognise it--hence his belief in the prince.|$|R
5|$|Severe and {{complicated}} malaria are <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> caused by infection with P. falciparum. The other species usually cause only febrile disease. Severe {{and complicated}} malaria are medical emergencies since mortality rates are high (10% to 50%). Cerebral malaria is {{the form of}} severe and complicated malaria with the worst neurological symptoms.|$|E
5|$|The Chalukyan architects {{retained}} features {{from both}} {{northern and southern}} styles. However, in the overall arrangement of the main temple and of the subsidiary shrines, they inclined towards the northern style and tended to build one main shrine with four minor shrines, making the structure a panchayatna or five-shrined complex. Chalukyan temples were, <b>almost</b> <b>always,</b> built facing the east.|$|E
5|$|The {{greatest}} risk in flying is in takeoff and landing, meaning that longer aircraft trips are safer per mile. Commuter planes used on shorter flights have higher risk than larger jet aircraft. Driving on U.S. Interstate highways, which are <b>almost</b> <b>always</b> controlled-access divided highways, is safer than driving on most other roads and highways.|$|E
60|$|And {{this most}} {{discreet}} remark caused Aunt Rosamund, avid--in a well-bred way--of music, to omit {{mention of the}} intruder when writing to her brother. The next two weeks he came <b>almost</b> every day, <b>always</b> bringing his violin, Gyp playing his accompaniments, and though his hungry stare sometimes made her feel hot, she would have missed it.|$|R
40|$|This note {{studies the}} {{behavior}} of an index I_t which {{is assumed to be}} a tradable security, to satisfy the BSM model dI_t/I_t = μ dt + σ dW_t, and to be efficient in the following sense: we do not expect a prespecified trading strategy whose value is <b>almost</b> surely <b>always</b> nonnegative to outperform the index greatly. The efficiency of the index imposes severe restrictions on its growth rate; in particular, for a long investment horizon we should have μ≈ r+σ^ 2, where r is the interest rate. This provides another partial solution to the equity premium puzzle. All our mathematical results are extremely simple. ...|$|R
5000|$|Flone Robinson (Becca in the American English dub) : The main protagonist {{and middle}} {{daughter}} of the Robinson family. Flone is free-spirited and willing to do <b>almost</b> anything. She <b>always</b> speaks her mind, and enjoys doing new things. The story is usually told from her point of view. She is voiced by Reba West in the English Dub, and by Yoshiko Matsuo in Japanese.|$|R
