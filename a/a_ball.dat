The game has a shop system that can provide boosts for players, such one that adds <b>a</b> <b>Ball</b> Saver. Coins are collected through various means, and are used to purchase items from this shop. If all balls are lost, the game is over.

Occasionally, a hole will open in the field, where players can either gain bonuses, such as an added Ball Saver or a score increase, or allow them to go to a special mode. There are four primary modes - Catch 'Em Mode, Egg Mode, Evolution Mode, and Travel Mode. These modes are typically activated by going through a certain path on the board three times, and then entering an area on the board, such as the Sharpedo, which will activate Catch 'Em Mode.|$|E
