5|$|For {{bills to}} become Law, {{they are to}} be first passed by both houses of the National Diet, signed by the Ministers of State, {{countersigned}} by the Prime Minister, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>finally</b> promulgated by the Emperor; however, without specifically giving the Emperor the power to oppose legislation.|$|E
5|$|The red ground {{resulted}} in a warmth of tone that {{was picked up by}} the sensitive panchromatic film.

5|$|The second manned mission, Apollo 8, brought astronauts for {{the first}} time in a flight around the Moon in December 1968. Shortly before, the Soviets had sent an {{unmanned}} spacecraft around the Moon. On the next two missions docking maneuvers that were needed for the Moon landing were practiced <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>finally</b> the Moon landing was made on the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969.|$|E

5|$|Another {{model of}} the {{evolution}} of this genus, also proposed by Casier in 1960, is that the direct ancestor of the Carcharocles is the shark Otodus obliquus, which lived from 60 mya to 13 mya during the Paleocene and Miocene epochs. In this model, O. obliquus evolved into O. aksuaticus, which evolved into C. auriculatus, and then into C. angustidens, and then into C. chubutensis, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>finally</b> into C. megalodon. The evolution of this lineage is characterized by the increase of serrations, the widening of the crown, the development of a more triangular shape, and the disappearance of the lateral cusps. The genus Otodus is ultimately derived from Cretolamna, a shark from the Cretaceous period.|$|E
5|$|By 1910, Sunday {{began to}} conduct {{meetings}} (usually {{longer than a}} month) in small cities like Youngstown, Wilkes-Barre, South Bend, and Denver, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>finally,</b> between 1915 and 1917, the major cities of Philadelphia, Syracuse, Kansas City, Detroit, Boston, Buffalo, and New York City. During the 1910s, Sunday was front page news in the cities where he held campaigns. Newspapers often printed his sermons in full, and during World War I, local coverage of his campaigns often surpassed that of the war. Sunday {{was the subject of}} over sixty articles in major periodicals, and he was a staple of the religious press regardless of denomination.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, a {{team from}} New York {{described}} detection of PrPSc even when initially present at only one part in a hundred billion (10−11) in brain tissue. The method combines amplification with a novel technology called Surround Optical Fiber Immunoassay (SOFIA) and some specific antibodies against PrPSc. After amplifying and then concentrating any PrPSc, the samples are labelled with a fluorescent dye using an antibody for specificity <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>finally</b> loaded into a micro-capillary tube. This tube is placed in a specially constructed apparatus {{so that it is}} totally surrounded by optical fibres to capture all light emitted once the dye is excited using a laser.|$|E

5|$|After Hitler's {{release from}} prison on 20 December 1924, the Nazi Party was officially refounded. In 1925, Hitler ordered Schreck to organise the {{formation}} of a new bodyguard unit, the Schutzkommando ("Protection Command"). Hitler wanted a small group of tough ex-soldiers like Schreck, who would be loyal to him. The unit included old Stoßtrupp members like Emil Maurice and Erhard Heiden. The unit made its first public appearance in April 1925. That same year, the Schutzkommando was expanded to a national level. It was also successively renamed the Sturmstaffel ("Storm Squadron") <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>finally</b> the Schutzstaffel ("Protection Squadron"; SS) on 9 November 1925. Schreck became SS member #5. He was asked by Hitler to command the bodyguard company. Schreck never referred to himself as Reichsführer-SS, but the title was retroactively applied to him in later years.|$|E
5|$|The 13th Airborne Division was {{the fifth}} {{airborne}} division to be formed in the United States during World War II, and was officially activated on Friday the 13th of August 1943 at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, {{under the command of}} Major General George W. Griner, Jr. Only {{a few months after the}} activation of the division, however, Major General Griner was ordered to take command of the 98th Infantry Division, and was replaced by Major General Elbridge Chapman, who would go on to command the division for the rest of the conflict. Chapman was one of the early pioneers of the American airborne concept, commanding the experimental 88th Airborne Infantry Battalion in late 1941 when he was a lieutenant colonel, before going on to take command of the 13th Airborne Division. The 88th Airborne Infantry Battalion would be renamed as the 88th Airborne Infantry Regiment, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>finally</b> become the 88th Glider Infantry Regiment on 21 September 1942, forming the core of the 13th Airborne Division. When it was activated, the 13th Airborne Division was initially composed of the 515th Parachute Infantry Regiment, the 88th Glider Infantry Regiment and the 326th Glider Infantry Regiment.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish {{education}} system underwent radical change and {{expansion in the}} 20th century. In 1918 Roman Catholic schools were brought into the system, but retained their distinct religious character, access to schools by priests and the requirement that school staff be acceptable to the Church. The school leaving age was raised to 14 in 1901, and although plans to raise it to 15 in the 1940s were never ratified, increasing numbers stayed on beyond elementary education and it was eventually raised to 16 in 1973. As a result, secondary education was the major area {{of growth in the}} inter-war period, particularly for girls, who stayed on in full-time education in increasing numbers throughout the century. New qualifications were developed to cope with changing aspirations and economics, with the Leaving Certificate being replaced by the Scottish Certificate of Education Ordinary Grade ('O-Grade') and Higher Grade ('Higher') qualifications in 1962, which became the basic entry qualification for university study. The centre of the {{education system}} also became more focused on Scotland, with the ministry of education partly moving north in 1918 <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>finally</b> having its headquarters relocated to Edinburgh in 1939. After devolution, in 1999 the new Scottish Executive set up an Education Department and an Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning Department, which together took over its functions. One of the major diversions from practice in England, possible because of devolution, was the abolition of student tuition fees in 1999, instead retaining a system of means-tested student grants.|$|E

50|$|The Sainte Marie Coal Mine {{is one of}} {{the major}} Ronchamp coal mines, located in Bourlémont (Ronchamp, Haute-Saône), in eastern France.

On 29 March 2001, the headframe was listed as a French national monument historique.|$|R
50|$|Through the centuries, the seven-turreted fort {{has changed}} hands many times.

The fort knew a golden period under Ranawat Thakur Bhawani Singh (1882-1934).|$|R
