5|$|Both the 1930s episode and the {{outbreak}} of competitive devaluation that began in 2009 occurred during global economic downturns. An important difference with the 2010s period is that international traders <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> able to hedge their exposures to exchange rate volatility due to more sophisticated financial markets. A second difference is that during the later period devaluations have invariably been effected by nations expanding their money supplies—either by creating money to buy foreign currency, {{in the case of}} direct interventions, or by creating money to inject into their domestic economies, with quantitative easing. If all nations try to devalue at once, the net effect on exchange rates could cancel out leaving them largely unchanged, but the expansionary effect of the interventions would remain. So while there has been no collaborative intent, some economists such as Berkeley's Barry Eichengreen and Goldman Sachs's Dominic Wilson have suggested the net effect will be similar to semi-coordinated monetary expansion which will help the global economy.|$|E

25|$|The product gap—also {{called the}} segment or {{positioning}} gap—is {{that part of}} the market a particular organization is excluded from because of product or service characteristics. This may be because the market is segmented and the organization does not have offerings in some segments, or because the organization positions its offerings in a way that effectively excludes certain potential consumers—because competitive offerings <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> placed for these consumers.|$|E

Usage of the original singular may be considered pedantic, hypercorrective, or incorrect. In the examples below, the original plural is now commonly used as a singular, {{and in some cases}} a regular English plural (effectively a double plural) has been formed from it.|$|E

The pupil teacher ratios <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> in private schools (1:31 to 1:37 for government schools) and more teachers in private schools are female. There is some disagreement over which system has better educated teachers. According to the latest DISE survey, the percentage of untrained teachers (para-teachers) is 54.91% in private, compared to 44.88% in government schools and only 2.32% teachers in unaided schools receive in-service training compared to 43.44% for government schools. The competition in the school market is intense, yet most schools make profit.|$|E
25|$|Commutative rings <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> {{understood}} than noncommutative ones. Algebraic {{geometry and}} algebraic number theory, which provide many natural examples of commutative rings, have driven {{much of the}} development of commutative ring theory, which is now, under the name of commutative algebra, a major area of modern mathematics. Because these three fields (algebraic geometry, algebraic number theory and commutative algebra) are so intimately connected it is usually difficult and meaningless to decide which field a particular result belongs to. For example, Hilbert's Nullstellensatz is a theorem which is fundamental for algebraic geometry, and is stated and proved in terms of commutative algebra. Similarly, Fermat's last theorem is stated in terms of elementary arithmetic, which is a part of commutative algebra, but its proof involves deep results of both algebraic number theory and algebraic geometry.|$|E

25|$|A third gain in {{cognitive}} ability involves thinking about thinking itself, a process {{referred to as}} metacognition. It often involves monitoring one's own cognitive activity during the thinking process. Adolescents' improvements in knowledge of their own thinking patterns lead to better self-control and more effective studying. It is also relevant in social cognition, resulting in increased introspection, self-consciousness, and intellectualization (in the sense of thought about one's own thoughts, rather than the Freudian definition as a defense mechanism). Adolescents <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> able than children to understand that {{people do not have}} complete control over their mental activity. Being able to introspect may lead to two forms of adolescent egocentrism, which results in two distinct problems in thinking: the imaginary audience and the personal fable. These likely peak at age fifteen, along with self-consciousness in general.|$|E
25|$|In {{describing}} Scansoriopteryx, Czerkas & Yuan cited {{evidence for}} an arboreal (tree-dwelling) lifestyle. They noted that, unlike all modern bird hatchlings, the forelimbs of Scansoriopteryx are {{longer than the}} hind limbs. The authors argued that this anomaly indicates the forelimbs {{played an important role}} in locomotion even at an extremely early developmental stage. Scansoriopteryx has a well-preserved foot, and the authors interpreted the hallux as reversed, the condition of a backward-pointing toe being widespread among modern tree-dwelling birds. Furthermore, the authors pointed to the short, stiffened tail of the Scansoriopteryx specimen as a tree-climbing adaptation. The tail may have been used as a prop, much like the tails of modern woodpeckers. Comparison with the hands of modern climbing species with elongated third digits, like iguanid lizards, also supports the tree-climbing hypothesis. Indeed, the hands of Scansoriopteryx <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> adapted to climbing than the modern tree-climbing hatchling of the hoatzin.|$|E

It was the final landing site of the first voyage of the Mayflower, and the location of the original settlement of the Plymouth Colony.

500|$|Cleveland {{began the}} season with a 30–14 win over the Buffalo Bills. The Browns got out to a fast start, scoring two touchdowns in the first quarter and adding two more in the second while holding the Bills scoreless. Buffalo came back in the third quarter, scoring two touchdowns of its own, but Cleveland held its lead. Browns coach Paul Brown criticized the {{performance}} after the game, saying the team had failed to keep pace in the second half after he rotated in some of his younger players. [...] "We got a good head of steam and took a commanding lead {{in the first half and}} then let down and looked bad in the last two periods," [...] he said. Buffalo quarterback George Ratterman felt pressure from Cleveland's defense the whole game, and said the Browns were better than the Chicago Bears, who had won the 1946 NFL Championship Game the previous season. [...] "Their line rushed me all night long and I didn't have much of a chance to get the ball away accurately," [...] Ratterman said. [...] "I think the Browns <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> than the Bears, especially their line." [...] Placekicker Lou Groza had his extra point blocked after the Browns' first touchdown.

500|$|The {{company had}} no {{standardization}} of level design tools. Leighton said, [...] "Some people used 3D Studio Max, some used Lightwave, and one designer even wrote his own custom modeler from scratch". This practice {{led to an}} inconsistent quality across the game's levels. For example, one designer would create structures with great geometry but bad texturing, while another would create the opposite. Once the structures were modeled individually, they were all imported into a custom editor, called D3Edit, so that the designers could [...] "glue everything together". The D3Edit editor received constant updates because it initially did not feature an intuitive interface for designers. It {{was not until the}} last third of the development period that the editor improved significantly. As Leighton notes, [...] "Even in the shipped game you can tell which levels were made early on and which were made {{near the end of the}} production cycle. The later levels <b>are</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> looking, have better frame rates, and generally have better scripts". Developers also considered the idea of shipping the game with a level editor based on the one they used to create the game's levels. However, due to the constant changes the developers made to their own editor, it was hard for them to design a more user-friendly one from the start.|$|E

Kimi Räikkönen was equally displeased, complaining about the rules concerning driving standards. Following his on-track battle with Max Verstappen, he demanded clarification on whether Verstappen's aggressive driving style was legal, saying: [...] "I just wanted to ask if it's OK when you are next to another car, at some point on the exit of the corner are you allowed to always push the other car up on the kerbs [...] Apparently it's fine. As long as everybody has the same rules that's OK." [...] Concerning the collision between Nico Hülkenberg and Ricciardo, Force India revealed that damage to Hülkenberg's front wing had caused him to lose downforce and slide into the Red Bull.
