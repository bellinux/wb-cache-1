5|$|According to {{the famous}} DNA {{hybridization}} study into avian phylogenetic relationships by Sibley and Ahlquist, the split of the Procellariiformes into the four families occurred around 30 million years ago; <b>a</b> <b>fossil</b> bone often attributed to the order, described as the genus Tytthostonyx, {{has been found in}} rocks dating around the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (70-60 mya), but the remains are too incomplete for placement within the Procellariiformes to be certain.|$|E

5000|$|Palaeopascichnus is a genus of Ediacaran {{organism}} comprising {{a series}} of lobes; it is plausibly a protozoan, but probably unrelated to the classical Ediacaran biota. [...] Once thought to represent <b>a</b> trace <b>fossil,</b> it is now recognized as <b>a</b> body <b>fossil.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>As</b> <b>fossil</b> fuels, burning wood causes green house effect gas. But wood is a {{renewable}} source of energy. A sustainable heat {{system would be}} to use solar heat in the summer, and the minimum of wood in the winter, thanks to maximum insulation.|$|R
5|$|Because fossils {{identifiable}} as P. sternbergi {{are found}} {{exclusively in the}} lower layers of the Niobrara Formation, and P. longiceps fossils exclusively in the upper layers, <b>a</b> <b>fossil</b> lacking the skull can be identified based on {{its position in the}} geologic column (though for many early fossil finds, precise data about its location was not recorded, rendering many fossils unidentifiable).|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the {{discovery}} of Bugtilemur, <b>a</b> <b>fossil</b> primate from Pakistan dating to the Oligocene and initially {{thought to be a}} cheirogaleid lemur, further challenged the theory of lemur origins; however, it was later shown to be a type of adapiform primate and not a lemur.|$|E
5|$|Lagrivea is <b>a</b> <b>fossil</b> genus of {{squirrel}} {{from the}} Middle Miocene of France. The single species, L. vireti, is known from three mandibles (lower jaws) and two isolated teeth. All {{come from the}} fissure filling (<b>a</b> <b>fossil</b> deposit formed when a rock fissure filled with sediment) of La Grive L5, part of the La Grive-Saint-Alban complex in Saint-Alban-de-Roche, southeastern France. Lagrivea was a large tree squirrel with flat lower incisors and a large, triangular fourth lower premolar (p4). Each of the four cheekteeth (p4 and three molars, m1 through m3) bears a deep basin {{in the middle of}} the crown. The m3 is about rectangular in shape, but rounded at the back. Although m1 and m2 have two roots, m3 has three.|$|E

5|$|Narcissus {{appears to}} have arisen {{in the area of}} the Iberian peninsula, {{southern}} France and north-western Italy, and within this area most sections of the genus appeared, with only a few taxa being dispersed to North Africa at a time when the African and West European platforms were closer together. Subgenus Hermione in turn arose in the southwestern mediterranean and north west Africa. However, these are reconstructions, the Amaryllidaceae lacking <b>a</b> <b>fossil</b> record.|$|E
5|$|Some {{sources such}} as the Mammal Species of the World {{recognize}} nine subspecies and list both P. o. palustris or P. o. paraguensis separately. However, both Pocock and Seymour considered them as synonyms for the same subspecies. The latter preferred P. o. paraguensis because the description of P. o. palustris was based on <b>a</b> <b>fossil</b> skull. In addition, extinct subspecies P. o. augusta and P. o. mesembrina lived throughout the Americas during the Pleistocene.|$|E
5|$|The {{cane toad}} {{is an old}} species. <b>A</b> <b>fossil</b> toad (specimen UCMP 41159) from the La Venta fauna of the late Miocene of Colombia is indistinguishable from modern cane toads from {{northern}} South America. It was discovered in a floodplain deposit, which suggests the R. marina habitat preferences have long been for open areas.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of Vegavis, a late Cretaceous {{member of the}} Anatidae, proved that the diversification of modern birds started before the Cenozoic. The affinities of an earlier fossil, the possible galliform Austinornis lentus, dated to about 85 million years ago, are still too controversial to provide <b>a</b> <b>fossil</b> evidence of modern bird diversification.|$|E
5|$|The first Devonian {{tetrapod}} identified from Asia {{was recognized}} from <b>a</b> <b>fossil</b> jawbone reported in 2002. The Chinese tetrapod Sinostega pani was discovered among fossilized tropical plants and lobe-finned {{fish in the}} red sandstone sediments of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region of northwest China. This finding substantially extended the geographical range of these animals and has raised new questions about the worldwide distribution and great taxonomic diversity they achieved within a relatively short time.|$|E
5|$|The {{fossil record}} for bees is {{incomplete}} with around 11 specimens that might possibly be Bombini, some poorly documented, had {{been described by}} 2011; some (such as Calyptapis florissantensis from Florissant, USA, and Oligoapis beskonakensis from , Turkey) dated from the Oligocene. In 2012 <b>a</b> <b>fossil</b> bumblebee, Bombus (Bombus) randeckensis was described from the Miocene Randeck Maar in southwestern Germany and confidently placed in the subgenus Bombus.|$|E

5|$|There is {{evidence}} of a mass kill of bony fishes at <b>a</b> <b>fossil</b> site immediately above the K–Pg boundary layer on Seymour Island near Antarctica, apparently precipitated by the K–Pg extinction event, however, the marine and freshwater environments of fishes mitigated environmental effects of the extinction event.|$|E
5|$|Two {{species of}} Pteranodon are {{traditionally}} recognized as valid: Pteranodon longiceps, the type species, and Pteranodon sternbergi. The species differ {{only in the}} shape of the crest in adult males (described above), and possibly in the angle of certain skull bones. Because well-preserved Pteranodon skull fossils are extremely rare, researchers use stratigraphy (i.e. which rock layer of the geologic formation <b>a</b> <b>fossil</b> is found in) to determine species identity in most cases.|$|E
5|$|<b>A</b> <b>fossil</b> site at a {{borrow pit}} in near Cheswold, Delaware created during highway {{construction}} unearthed 11 specimens of fragmentary and unassociated avian fossils, which {{were identified by}} Rasmussen as including a small loon, a small gull-like species and five specimens of a gannet-like seabird, probably Morus loxostylus, a common species in the Miocene.
