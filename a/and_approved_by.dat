5|$|A new {{central library}} was {{discussed}} by library administrators {{for several decades}} <b>and</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> the regional council in 2008.

Construction began later that year on a prominent downtown site that had been a parking lot for half a century.|$|E

Perrett, the head of Elswick Ordnance Company, <b>and</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> the Brazilian government on 20 February 1907. Argentina and Chile immediately annulled the 1902 treaty that had ended their naval arms race, and both planned to expand their own navies, though Chile was delayed by a financial depression in 1907 and a major earthquake the next year.|$|E

5|$|The two seaports, {{which had}} been rivals {{for most of the}} 20th century but lost ground to nearby ports in British Columbia, {{proposed}} a merger of marine cargo operations in 2014. A public development authority was created in 2015 <b>and</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> the Federal Maritime Commission, resulting in the formation of The Northwest Seaport Alliance on August 4, 2015.|$|E
5|$|A {{radical change}} of tactics, which {{involved}} {{the introduction of}} a bill to ban British subjects from aiding or participating in the slave trade to the French colonies, was suggested by maritime lawyer James Stephen. It was a shrewd move, since the majority of British ships were now flying American flags and supplying slaves to foreign colonies with whom Britain was at war. A bill was introduced <b>and</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> the cabinet, and Wilberforce and other abolitionists maintained a self-imposed silence, so as not to draw any attention to the effect of the bill. The approach proved successful, and the new Foreign Slave Trade Bill was quickly passed, and received royal assent on 23 May 1806.|$|E

5|$|As a {{condition}} of receiving the grant, the P.R. Department of the Family must submit an annual plan of operation to the FNS, which describes how it will distribute the funds assigned as nutrition assistance to qualifying persons. This includes identifying the island population which is eligible for the NAP benefits (i.e., family income limits, family status limits, etc.), establishing the process in which individual participants are selected, {{and the process of}} determining the benefit amount for each participant. The plan of operation is reviewed <b>and</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> the FNS before funds are disbursed.|$|E
5|$|Each team {{selected}} {{a squad of}} up to 15players, and any changes to that squad due to illness or injury had to be requested in writing <b>and</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> the ICC's Event Technical Committee. Three such replacements {{were made to the}} squads, with South Africa, Sri Lanka and the West Indies making a change. England entered the tournament with the top-ranked players in both the ICC's batting and bowling rankings, Claire Taylor and Isa Guha respectively, but Australia were commonly lidted in the press as favourites to win the tournament. Taylor finished the tournament as the leading run-scorer, accumulating 324 runs, and her England team-mate Laura Marsh was the most prolific wicket-taker, claiming 16 wickets.|$|E
5|$|In July 1942, the Germans ordered Gens {{to give up}} 500 {{children}} and old people, but by late July he had persuaded the Germans to abandon the order for children to be surrendered. He reduced the entire command to 100 older residents, and on 26 July handed over 84 elderly, mostly terminally ill or disabled, who were then executed by the Nazis. The Jewish administration employed over 1500 people in September 1942, including some intellectuals who were appointed to jobs to ensure their survival. This suggestion was made by community leaders <b>and</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> Gens.|$|E

5|$|Institute Professors are {{initially}} {{nominated by}} leaders representing either a department or school. The {{chair of the}} faculty then consults with the Academic Council and jointly appoints with the president an ad-hoc committee from various departments and non-MIT members to evaluate the qualifications and make a documented recommendation to the president. The final determination is made based upon recommendations from professionals in the nominee's field. The case is then reviewed again by the Academic Council <b>and</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> the Executive Committee of the MIT Corporation.|$|E
5|$|Landman {{had also}} been a {{prominent}} opponent of Zionism: when, in 1922, the United States Congress was considering the Lodge–Fish resolution {{in support of the}} Balfour Declaration, Landman and Rabbi David Philipson had presented the Reform movement's (then) anti-Zionist position to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. Landman also printed many opinions against the resolution and Zionism in his American Hebrew Magazine. The bill was eventually unanimously supported by both houses of Congress, <b>and</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> President Harding.|$|E

An application for this change was received by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) on March 26, 1968, <b>and</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> that body on June 18, 1968.|$|E

5|$|Political {{turmoil in}} Ireland {{continued}} as the Nationalists fought for independence; George expressed his horror at government-sanctioned killings and reprisals to Prime Minister David Lloyd George. At the opening {{session of the}} Parliament of Northern Ireland on 22 June 1921, the King appealed for conciliation in a speech part drafted by General Jan Smuts <b>and</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> Lloyd George. A few weeks later, a truce was agreed. Negotiations between Britain and the Irish secessionists led to {{the signing of the}} Anglo-Irish Treaty.

5|$|Since 1971, {{additional}} amendments {{have been}} passed by the General Assembly <b>and</b> <b>approved</b> <b>by</b> the voter to conform to provisions in the U.S. Constitution, rulings from the U.S. Supreme Court and Congressional statute. The voting age {{has been reduced to}} eighteen, voting residency requirements have been removed, and voter registration conforms to the Motor Voter Act. Additionally, the Virginia Constitution now provides for a General Assembly session following a governor’s veto, and {{the right of the people}} to hunt, fish and harvest game is guaranteed. In 2006, Virginians passed an amendment limiting marriage to “unions between one man and one woman”. That has since been overturned by Obergefell v. Hodges (2015).|$|E
