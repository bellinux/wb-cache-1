5|$|The NC's other planned {{extension}} was {{to branch}} from the BS's curve under Park Crescent. It was then to curve eastwards under Regent's Park <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>run</b> under Longford Street and Drummond Street to end at a {{station on the}} west side of Seymour Street (now Eversholt Street) under Euston station. An intermediate station was planned for the junction of Drummond Street and Hampstead Road.|$|E
5|$|During the German {{occupation}} of Norway {{as part of}} the Second World War, the Wehrmacht wanted a railway route past Trondheim which was guarded against sabotage. They decided {{that the best way to}} do this was to build a tunnel under the neighborhood of Tyholt. However, construction of the tunnel took much longer than expected, so instead Wehrmach started laying railway tracks in the streets in Trondheim. They planned that the railway would branch from the Dovre Line at Skansen Station and then follow Sandgata and Olav Tryggvasons gate, cross Nidelva on Bakke Bridge <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>run</b> up Innherredsveien before reaching the Meråker Line at Lademoen Station. However, by German capitulation on 8 May 1945, construction of the railway had only reached Søndre gate.|$|E

5|$|The highway {{designation}} {{was created}} in 1930 out of {{the southern end of}} US127. Three sets of reroutings through Adrian have resulted in the creation of two different business loops through the city. A change proposed in the 1960s and implemented in the 1970s shifted the southern end of US223 to replace M-151 <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>run</b> along the US23 freeway between Whiteford Township, Michigan, and Sylvania, Ohio. Since the 1980s, US223 no longer reaches Toledo, instead feeding into the freeway system for the city. Changes proposed and enacted into law in the 1990s would upgrade the highway as an Interstate Highway. Congress has designated this corridor as part of Interstate 73 (I-73), although neither state intends at this time to complete the freeway.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, NSB {{launched}} a now abandoned proposal {{to establish an}} urban train service in Trondheim. According to the proposal, trains would have operated along the Dovre Line from Melhus Station <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>run</b> to Lerkendal before continuing onwards to Lademoen and running in a loop back to the central station. The services was proposed to be operated {{as part of the}} commuter rail system. It would have required investments of 120 million Norwegian krone, including a connection for trains to be able to run from the east end of the line and westwards on the Nordland Line, and investments to noise insulate the Tyholt Tunnel. In a 2005 report, SINTEF recommended that if such a service should be introduced, it should have four services per hour and operated with light rail rolling stock as a circle line with a tail southwards to Heimdal or Melhus. The report further commented that the new connection at Lademoen would have a 3.6-percent gradient, which would be too steep for mainline trains.|$|E

25|$|During peak hours, trains {{generally}} run in shorter, express zones, making limited stops as {{they fill}} faster, with some overlap in start and end stations {{to allow for}} intra-zone transfers for those traveling locally.

25|$|The Heritage Foundation and the Reagan {{administration}} {{also sought to}} apply the Reagan Doctrine in Cambodia. The largest resistance movement fighting Cambodia's communist government was largely made up {{of members of the}} former Khmer Rouge regime, whose human rights record was among the worst of the 20th century. Therefore, Reagan authorized the provision of aid to a smaller Cambodian resistance movement, a coalition called the Khmer People's National Liberation Front, known as the KPNLF <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>run</b> by Son Sann; in an effort to force an end to the Vietnamese occupation.|$|E
25|$|The route {{west was}} arduous and fraught with many dangers, {{but the number}} of deaths on the trail is not known with any precision; there are only wildly varying estimates. Estimating is {{difficult}} because of the common practice of burying people in unmarked graves that were intentionally disguised to avoid their being dug up by animals or Indians. Graves were often put {{in the middle of a}} trail <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>run</b> over by the livestock to make them difficult to find. Disease was the main killer of trail travelers; cholera killed up to 3percent of all travelers in the epidemic years from 1849 to 1855.|$|E

25|$|The iliohypogastric (T12-L1) and ilioinguinal nerves (L1) {{emerge from}} the psoas major near the muscle's origin, from where they run {{laterally}} downward to pass anteriorly above the iliac crest between the transversus abdominis and abdominal internal oblique, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>run</b> above the inguinal ligament. Both nerves give off muscular branches to both these muscles. Iliohypogastric supplies sensory branches to {{the skin of the}} lateral hip region, and its terminal branch finally pierces the aponeurosis of the abdominal external oblique above the inguinal ring to supply sensory branches to the skin there. Ilioinguinalis exits through the inguinal ring and supplies sensory branches to the skin above the pubic symphysis and the lateral portion of the scrotum.|$|E
25|$|Coming {{off their}} {{impressive}} divisional road {{win over the}} Bears, the Vikings flew to Texas Stadium for a Week 7 intraconference duel with the Dallas Cowboys. In the first quarter, Minnesota trailed early as Cowboys QB Tony Romo completed a 5-yard TD pass to WR Terrell Owens. The Vikings would respond with rookie RB Adrian Peterson getting a 20-yard TD run. In the second quarter, Minnesota had an abnormal defensive touchdown, as LB Ben Leber picked up a Patrick Crayton fumble, ran a couple of yards, lateraled the ball to CB Cedric Griffin, who would eventually fumble and recover the ball at Dallas' 28-yard line, <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>run</b> into the endzone for a touchdown.|$|E
25|$|Already in {{existence}} {{prior to the}} planning for the line was a level crossing {{at the intersection of}} Fitzgerald and Roe streets in central Perth. The crossing allowed buses coming from Wellington Street Bus Station to connect with Fitzgerald Street <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>run</b> to the northern and north-eastern suburbs. Due to the need to construct a rail tunnel under Roe Street, it was considered unsafe and impractical to retain the existing level crossing, because it would be situated very near the tunnel entrance, and so make impossible for train drivers to see any vehicles on the crossing and take evasive action. That led to the construction of the Fitzgerald Street Bus Bridge.|$|E

25|$|Summer routes were {{introduced}} in 1932, cutting Sagene Ring's headway to fifteen minutes. Including slack a full round on the circle took 35 minutes. During a twelve-minute headway this went fine with three trams in each direction. The route {{could be done in}} 30 minutes, but without any slack. Oslo Sporveier ran the line with two trams per direction during the fifteen-minute headway services, but it was often difficult to keep the schedule with this scheme. During the summers 0 was combined with 13 so each service would run twice around the circle <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>run</b> on the Gamlebyen Line. From 1937 the reduced service and 0 and 13 combination was also run on Sundays. From 1940 line 13 was moved to the Sinsen Line.|$|E
25|$|The Itchy & Scratchy Game is a side-scrolling {{platformer}} {{based on}} The Itchy & Scratchy Show, a show within {{a show in}} the animated television series The Simpsons. There are seven levels in the game. The player controls Itchy, a mouse whose goal is to torture and kill the cat Scratchy. The game is played by running around the level and attacking Scratchy and various other enemies. Both Itchy and Scratchy carry mallets as their standard weapons, although various other weapons — coordinating with {{the theme of the}} level — can also be used. Every few moments, Scratchy will come onto the screen <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>run</b> away after attacking Itchy or Itchy has inflicted damage on Scratchy. Once Scratchy's health has been depleted, a boss battle will ensue.|$|E
25|$|After {{dealing with}} the rebellions of Magnentius and Sylvanus, Constantius felt he needed a {{permanent}} representative in Gaul. In 355, Julian was summoned {{to appear before the}} emperor in Mediolanum and on 6 November was made Caesar of the West, marrying Constantius' sister, Helena. Constantius, after his experience with Gallus, intended his representative to be more a figurehead than an active participant in events, so he packed Julian off to Gaul with a small retinue, assuming his prefects in Gaul would keep Julian in check. At first reluctant to trade his scholarly life for war and politics, Julian eventually took every opportunity to involve himself in the affairs of Gaul. In the following years he learned how to lead <b>and</b> <b>then</b> <b>run</b> an army, through a series of campaigns against the Germanic tribes that had settled {{on both sides of the}} Rhine.|$|E
