5|$|By then, Brown had put {{his system}} into place: a strict, {{systematic}} approach to coaching combined with a well-organized recruitment network that drew promising young players from Massillon's junior high school football program. He {{paid no attention to}} race, and brought several African-American players onto the team at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> northern schools excluded them.|$|E
5|$|During {{his brief}} term as mayor, Gallagher oversaw the town during <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> prospectors {{headed to the}} Klondike Gold Rush saw Edmonton as a {{stopover}} point. He also became the inaugural president of the Edmonton Hockey Club when it was founded on November 20, 1896.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} never to be a private {{residence}} again. It was offered for sale in 1929, and at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> country houses were being demolished was given a scrap value of £5,882. With {{the exception of the}} Phelips family portraits, the historic contents and furnishing were disposed of, and the house, an empty shell, remained on the market for two years.|$|E
50|$|To draw shock {{from the}} audience, a scene was {{included}} with the calculated decimation of a Mercedes Benz in an underground parking lot. This was at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> not <b>many</b> in India had seen a Mercedes, let alone sat in one.|$|R

25|$|Carnahan was the {{unsuccessful}} Democratic {{nominee for}} Lieutenant Governor. “Many {{of you have}} consistently encouraged me to continue serving our state in new ways — especially at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> so <b>many</b> of our state officials are so very disconnected from the everyday needs and aspirations of Missourians,” he wrote.He lost the general election to Republican Mike Parson.|$|R
5|$|As a critic, Willis did {{not believe}} in {{including}} discussions of personalities of writers when reviewing their works. He also believed that, though publications should discuss political topics, they should not express party opinions or choose sides. The Mirror flourished at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> publications were discontinuing. Its success was due to the shrewd management of Willis and Morris and the two demonstrated that the American public could support literary endeavors. Willis was becoming an expert in American literature and so, in 1845, Willis and Morris issued an anthology, The Prose and Poetry of America.|$|E
5|$|Garrow {{made much}} use of jury nullification {{to limit the}} {{punishment}} for his convicted clients, in <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> crimes carried the death penalty (the so-called Bloody Code). In 1784 a pair of women were arrested for stealing fans worth 15 shillings, meaning a conviction {{would result in the}} death penalty; Garrow convinced the jury to convict the women of stealing 4 shillings worth of fans, therefore changing the sentence to twelve months of hard labour.|$|E
5|$|Gillom {{played for}} the Massillon Tigers between 1938 and 1940, a period during which the team won all of its games and two High School Football National Championships. Gillom, who also played {{basketball}} and other sports, earned All-Ohio honors at Massillon {{and was one of}} several black players on the team at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> northern high schools excluded them. Brown's policy was to use his best players, regardless of race. Gillom set school records for points scored in a season and touchdown passes caught in a season. His record of 108 points in a season still stands.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} several fanzines {{published}} by supporters. Made in Brum, first issued in 2000, {{was the only one}} regularly on sale in 2013. The Zulu began some years earlier and ran for at least 16 seasons.

5|$|This was at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> {{television}} shows created websites to promote episodes; earlier that year, Fox created a website called whatbadgerseat.com {{in conjunction with}} the season premiere, in which badgers played an important role. On August18,2009, the episode was released as part of a DVD set called The Simpsons: The Complete Twelfth Season. Mike Scully, Ian Maxtone-Graham, Don Payne, John Frink, Matt Selman, Tom Gammill, Max Pross, Mark Kirkland and Joel H. Cohen participated in the audio commentary for the episode.|$|E
5|$|In the Browns' biggest {{trade of}} the offseason, Brown sent end John Harrington to the Chicago Rockets for Bill Boedeker, a halfback. Perhaps the most {{significant}} signing, however, was punter Horace Gillom, who had played for Brown at Massillon Washington High School and who Brown had recruited to Ohio State before World War II. Gillom could kick the ball further than most punters of his era. He changed the way teams approached punting by lining up 15 yards behind the center instead of the customary 10 yards to give himself more space and time to make his kicks. Gillom was also the third black player to sign with the Browns at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> teams did not employ African-Americans. Cleveland chose fullback Dick Hoerner in the AAFC draft, but he signed instead with the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League.|$|E
5000|$|Delegates from Taroom {{met with}} {{government}} representatives {{on numerous occasions}} [...] {{to discuss the issue}} but the propsoal was consistently rebuffed by the government who reasoned that they'd find it difficult to finance despite it providing Taroom with a convenient link to Toowoomba during <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> not <b>many</b> people own motor vehicles and those who did found long-distance travel slow and difficult due to inferior dirt tracks over challenging terrain.|$|R

5|$|Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray {{were born}} a week apart, played {{each other as}} juniors and made their Grand Slam tournament debuts in 2005. Djokovic made his ATP tour debut in 2004, while Murray's was in 2005, <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> bright youngsters joined the ATP tour. They both reached the world top 100 in 2005, and the world top 20 in 2006.

He also won two Masters tournament titles and 5 titles in total, finishing the year ranked number 3 in world. Murray, who was {{forced out of the}} French Open and Wimbledon by injury, ended 2007 ranked 11th, winning two ATP tournaments.|$|E
5|$|Safety overall has {{steadily}} improved in the United States for many decades. Between 1920 and 2000, {{the rate of}} fatal automobile accidents per vehicle-mile decreased {{by a factor of}} about 17. Except for a pause during the youth bulge of the 1960s (<b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> young, inexperienced drivers were on the road), progress in reducing fatal accidents has been steady. Safety for other types of U.S. passenger transportation has also improved substantially, but long-term statistical data are not as readily available. While the fatality rate roughly leveled off around 2000–2005 at around 1.5 fatalities per 100 million miles traveled, it has resumed a downward trend and reached 1.27 in 2008. The National Safety Council (whose data methodology differs slightly from the NHTSA) reports a rate (including deaths of pedestrians and cyclists killed in motor vehicle accidents) of 1.25 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles (or 12.5 deaths per billion vehicle miles) traveled in 2016.|$|E
5|$|The {{conductor}} of the combined choir was John Larkin Hopkins, who was also organist of Trinity College. He became ill, and handed over the conductorship to Stanford in 1873. Stanford was also appointed Hopkins's deputy organist at Trinity, and moved from Queens' to Trinity in April 1873. In the summer of that year Stanford made {{his first trip to}} continental Europe. He went to Bonn for the Schumann Festival held there, where he met Joachim and Brahms. His growing love of the music of Schumann and Brahms marked him as a classicist at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> music-lovers were divided into the classical or the modernist camps, the latter represented by the music of Liszt and Wagner. Stanford was not constrained by the fashion for belonging to one camp or the other; he immensely admired Die Meistersinger though he was unenthusiastic about some of Wagner's other works. After leaving Bonn he returned home by way of Switzerland and then Paris, where he saw Meyerbeer's Le prophète.|$|E

Preparations for the writing of this paper have led to the decision that education in nature conservation, although unquestionably running as a thread throughout most of our interpretative efforts is truly a very different approach. </p...|$|R
5|$|Within the {{recording}} industry, Martin {{was known for}} having become independent at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>many</b> producers were still salaried. However, EMI refused his pleas for royalties on his own work. By 1965, the Beatles' success had given Martin the leverage to start Associated Independent Recording (AIR), which enabled him to hire out his services to other artists. Martin also took EMI’s best producers and staff along with him to AIR. AIR demonstrated how important Martin's talents were to his artists, and it allowed him a share in record royalties on his hits. To this day, AIR {{remains one of the}} world's pre-eminent recording studios. In 1979, Martin opened a studio on the Caribbean island of Montserrat. This studio was destroyed by Hurricane Hugo ten years later.|$|E

50|$|The {{ultimate}} {{aim of the}} Living New Deal is {{to educate}} the general public, civic leaders and politicians about the New Deal and {{to show that it}} provides a proven model for reviving the economy in hard times, dealing with unemployment (especially among youth), rebuilding communities all across the country, restoring faith in government and renewing a sense of national purpose. In <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> so <b>many</b> people and places are hurting for good jobs and economic renewal, and the infrastructure of the country is crumbling, the New Deal can serve as an example for the present day.|$|R
60|$|Durbellière had {{not been}} in his parish, but he had always been peculiarly {{intimate}} with the family of the Larochejaquelins, and had warmly welcomed the return of Henri to the Bocage, at <b>a</b> <b>time</b> <b>when</b> so <b>many</b> of the nobility were leaving the country.
