40|$|This article {{reviews the}} cunent status of psychotropic {{drugs in the}} {{treatment}} of alcoholism and discusses the difficulties in assessing any treatment in light of the poor understanding of the condition. Phenothiazine tranquilizers, antidepressants, <b>anorexiants,</b> sedatives, antidipsotropics, and hallucinogens, are discussed through {{a review of the literature}} and in reporting present clinical and experimental studies. The phenothiazine tranquilizers, effective in most schizophrenia symp-toms, have not been conclusively proved effective in anxious or neurotic patients or for common alcoholic symptoms—except in those few patients suffering from concomitant psychosis. Antidepressants are discussed, as are their possible value in treating some alcoholics during the withdrawal phase. Newer, longer-acting sedatives, such as the benzodiazepines, are evaluated and pharmacological rea-sons for their popularity are considered. Hallucinogens, enthusiastically endorsed by some as effective treatments for alcoholism but controversial for want of well-controlled studies are also discussed. D HUGS are frequently used {{in the treatment of}} alcoholism. Hayman and Ditman 1 surveyed the psychiatrists of southern California on their use of drugs and found that alcoholism was the sec-ond most frequent condition in which psychoanalysts use drugs, and the third most frequent in which general psy-chiatrists use them. Drugs were used more frequently for schizophrenia and depression. Of the psychoanalysts re-sponding, 57 % said they used drugs in the treatment of alcoholism by classical psychoanalysis, and 85 % said they used them in psychoanalytic psychotherapy.

40|$|CONTEXT: Racial {{disparities in}} health care between black women and white women may be {{attributed}} in part to socioeconomic status and lack of insurance, but also {{may be due to}} lack of the dissemination of health information in black communities via black popular magazines. OBJECTIVE: Comparison of the number and type of pharmaceutical advertisements between black-oriented magazines and white-oriented magazines. DESIGN: Descriptive study. SETTING: Morehouse School of Medicine. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Recording of the type and number of over-the-counter and prescription drug advertisements. RESULTS: Five black-oriented magazines (Black Woman, Black Elegance, Essence, Ebony, and Upscale) and 5 white-oriented magazines (Family Circle, Working Mother, Good Housekeeping, Ladies' Home Journal, Women's Day) were evaluated for 3 months from June-August, 2000. White-oriented magazines had four to eight times more pharmaceutical ads than black-oriented magazines. Types of medications advertised in the white-oriented magazines and not the black-oriented magazines were, for example, cholinesterase inhibitors, calcium supplements, COX II-inhibitors, intranasal steroids, <b>anorexiants,</b> proton pump inhibitors, and smoking deterrent agents. Conversely, medications advertised in the black-oriented magazines and not the white-oriented magazines were antiviral agents and oral contraceptives. Pharmaceutical companies gave several reasons for the disparity, including the explanation that their particular company was advertising about HIV in the black community. CONCLUSIONS: A barrier to equitable health care for black women may be a low prioritization for health prevention and health management. This low prioritization or disinterest may be a reflection of the black magazine that she is reading {{due to the lack of}} pharmaceutical advertisements in black-oriented magazines. The result of this disinterest of black females may be seen in the increased morbidity and mortality for selected diseases...|$|R

The morbidity, mortality and reduced productivity associated with obesity and its complications result in a major burden to health care costs. Obesity is a complex chronic medical syndrome often with multiple different etiologic factors in individual patients. The long term successful management of obesity remains particularly challenging and invariably requires a multifaceted approach including lifestyle and behavioral modification, increased physical activity, and adjunctive pharmacotherapy. Bariatric surgery remains a last resort though at present it has the best results for achieving sustained robust weight loss. Obesity pharmacotherapy has been very limited in its role for long term obesity management because of the past history of several failed agents as well as the fact that presently available agents are few, and generally utilized as monotherapy. The recent FDA approval of the fixed drug combination of phentermine and extended release topiramate (topiramate-ER) (trade name Qsymia™) marks the first FDA approved combination pharmacotherapeutic agent for obesity since the Phen-Fen combination of the 1990 s. This review details the history and clinical trial basis for the use of both phentermine and topiramate in obesity therapeutics as well as the results of clinical trials of their combination for obesity treatment in humans. The initial clinical approval trials offer evidence that this fixed drug combination offers synergistic potential for effective, robust and sustained weight loss with mean weight loss of at least 10 % of baseline achieved and sustained for up to 2 years in over 50 % of subjects treated. It is anticipated that this agent will be the first in a new trend of multi-agent combination therapy for the chronic adjunctive management of obesity.

By contrast, an appetite stimulant {{is referred to as}} orexigenic.|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} and tolerance of a non-amplietaminic <b>anorexiant</b> drug has been evaluated in a short-term {{and in a}} long-term clinical trial in simple obesity and in refractory obesity. In the short-term 'crossover ' trial, a more evident {{effectiveness and}} tolerance result when the <b>anorexiant</b> is given in a late phase of treatment. The association of an <b>anorexiant</b> drug with the hypocaloric diet was seen {{to be effective in}} the treatment of so-called refractory obesity. In the evaluation of the long-term treatment it is seen that weight loss is greater and remains so for longer periods in patients receiving <b>anorexiant,</b> as compared to controls. This is related to a better maintenance of a restricted calorie regimen. Mazindol did not affect the improvement of glucose tolerance and insulin secretion which follows the weight reduction. I n t r o d u c t i o n Opportune caloric restriction is highly effec tive for weight reduction in obese subjects and therefore, theoretically, treatment of obesity appears simple. However, in practice, {{only a limited number of}} obese patients succeed in maintaining a strict and continuous adherence to a diet, and in obtaining signifi cant reduction of excess body-weight. A more important problem is the long-term maintenance of the result achieved, since it is known that most obese subjects who have obtained a consistent reduction in body-weight through a hypocaloric diet will quickly regain the lost weight (Glomset 1957, Stunkard & McLaren-Hume 1959, Glennon 1966, Bray 1970). This is due to a variously motivated inability to observe a restricted calorie intake over a long time period. It seems evident then that the use of <b>anorexiant</b> drugs can favour diet adherence, and conse quently, weight loss (Lawson et al 1970...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{currently}} available drugs {{for treatment of}} obesity act on two pharmacologic systems in the central nervous system: the noradrenergic system and the serotonergic system. There are clear and convincing clinical data that these drugs are effective and safe. However, several types of barriers exist to their proper and effective use, including public perceptions that obesity is a disease resulting from lack ofwillpower, professional expectations that <b>anorexiant</b> drugs should cure obesity, hindrance by state licensing agencies, regulatory rigidity, limited research funding, and legislative inaction. In spite of these limitations, several new and potentially valuable drugs are under develop-ment, and given an appropriate clinical and therapeutic envi-ronment, the future is bright for treatment of obesity.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{show why}} {{women are still}} seeking <b>anorexiant</b> {{medications}} despite current concerns over their use. DESIGN: In-depth interviews using grounded theory methodology. SETTING: Participants chose where {{they were to be}} interviewed. PARTICIPANTS: Women older than 18 years who had previously taken or were currently taking <b>anorexiant</b> medications for the purpose of losing weight. METHOD: Nine women completed two semistructured in-depth interviews during which they described their experiences from the time they began pharmacologic therapy for obesity until they discontinued the medications. Interview data were compiled and analyzed until saturation was reached. MAIN OUTCOME FINDINGS: Control was an important factor for the women. Their previous lack of control was due to frustration with failed dieting attempts and feeling pressure from others to lose weight. Prescription medications controlled physiologic hunger while the women sought to lose weight. Increased control over hunger and a decrease in weight gave participants confidence to continue their weight-loss efforts without the medications. Once the medications were discontinued, the women were able to maintain weight control through various lifestyle modifications. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Anorexiant</b> medications provide some women with a perception of control that helps them lose weight and not regain it. Health care professionals should be aware of their patients' struggles with weight loss and understand the importance of these medications for some patients...|$|E
40|$|Does {{phentermine}} use {{for weight}} loss have significant adverse effects? Evidence-Based Answer: <b>Anorexiant</b> drugs are associated with primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH); however, no reports specifically link phentermine to this condition (SOR: B, case control study and case series).

40|$|Background and Purpose: Some {{commonly}} used anorexiants, including methamphetamine and phenyl-propanolamine, {{have been associated}} with stroke. Because phentermine is an <b>anorexiant</b> with a chemical structure similar to that of amphetamines, similar side effects might be expected. Case Descriptions: Two patients using phentermine (one was also using phendimetrazine) developed ischemic cerebrovascular disease. One suffered a cerebral infarct with angiographic evidence of vasculopathy involving multiple vascular beds. The other patient developed headache and a hemisensory disturbance of 7 days ' duration. Conclusions: Phentermine, and possibly phendimetrazine, should be considered an <b>anorexiant</b> and sympathomimetic drug that can be associated with ischemic cerebrovascular disease.

40|$|The {{secondary}} {{analysis of}} transcripts {{from a study}} of 9 women who used prescription <b>anorexiant</b> medications {{described in this article}} was conducted to discover the role that hope played in the women’s weight-loss initiatives. It was found that hope grew throughout the women’s weight-loss initiative but peaked once the medications were discontinued. Seven components of the concept of hope were described {{in the context of the}} women’s weight-loss experiences. Characteristics of hope in women who have discontinued <b>anorexiant</b> medica-tions are different than those associated with hope in other contexts. A unique pattern of hope, hoping to maintain a balance, describes the women’s experiences as they strove to maintain the weight they had lost. Obesity is a growing concern in North American society for reasons of healthand fashion (American Dietetic Association & Canadian Dietetic Associa-tion, 1995; Pi-Sunyer, 1993; Rodin, 1993). In fact, dieting is growing into a popular pastime for North American women. It has been estimated that between 25 % and 50 % of women are overweight, and more than 44 % are currently dieting (Bjorntorp & Brodoff, 1992; Serdula et al., 1993).

40|$|Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is an {{endogenous}} lipid {{that contributes}} {{in important ways}} to the peripheral regulation of food intake. When administered intraperitoneally, OEA is a potent satiety-inducing <b>anorexiant</b> in rats and mice [Nature 414 (2001) 209; Neuropsycopharmacology 28 (2003) 1311; Nature 425 (2003) 90]. In the present study, we show that oral administration of OEA in pH-sensitive enteric-coated capsules produces a profound and long-lasting inhibition of food intake in free-feeding rats.

40|$|Oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is a {{structural}} analog of the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide, {{which does not}} activate cannabinoid receptors. The biosynthesis of OEA in rat small intestine is increased by feeding and reduced by fasting. Moreover, OEA decreases food intake in food-deprived rats via a mechanism that requires intact sensory fibers (Rodríguez de Fonseca, 2001). These results suggest that OEA {{may contribute to the}} peripheral regulation of feeding. In the present study, we have investigated the effects of systemic OEA administration (1 - 20 mg/kg, intraperitoneal) on meal pattern in free-feeding and food-deprived rats. In free-feeding animals, OEA delayed feeding onset in a dose-dependent manner, but had no effect on meal size or postmeal interval. In food-deprived animals, OEA both delayed feeding onset and reduced meal size. The selective effects of OEA in free-feeding rats are strikingly {{different from those of the}} serotonergic <b>anorexiant</b> d-fenfluramine (which delayed feeding and reduced meal size) and the intestinal peptide cholecystokinin (which reduced meal size). These results suggest that OEA may participate in the regulation of satiety and may provide a chemical scaffold for the design of novel appetite-suppressing medications. © 2003 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) {{have long}} been known as {{mediators}} of several physiological functions, among which the best characterized are lipid metabolism, energy balance and anti-inflammation. Their rather large and promiscuous ligand binding site has been recently discovered to accommodate, among a plethora of lipid molecules and metabolic intermediates, endocannabinoids and their cognate compounds, specifically belonging to the N-acylethanolamine group. In fact, oleoylethanolamide, palmitoylethanolamide and probably anandamide bind with relatively high affinity to PPARs and have now been included among their endogenous ligands. Through activation of PPARs these molecules exert a variety of physiological processes. Particularly, both long-term effects via genomic mechanisms and rapid non-genomic actions have been described, which in several instances are opposite to those evoked by activation of "classical" surface cannabinoid receptors. In this review, we describe how these effects are relevant under diverse physiological and pathophysiological circumstances, such as lipid metabolism and feeding behaviour, neuroprotection and epilepsy, circadian rhythms, addiction and cognition. A picture is emerging where nuclear receptors are involved in <b>anorexiant,</b> anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective, anti-epileptic, wakefulness-and cognitive-enhancing, and anti-addicting properties of endocannabinoid-like molecules. Further studies are necessary to fully understand cellular mechanisms underlying the interactions between endocannabinoids and PPARs, but also between their surface and nuclear receptors, and to exploit their potential therapeutic applications...|$|E
40|$|Amphetamine {{congeners}} can {{be prescribed}} as <b>anorexiant</b> drugs, despite their potential side effects, including cardiac toxicity. However, the morphologic features of cardiac damage related to protracted {{use of these}} compounds are unknown. We provide {{a detailed description of}} cardiac autopsy findings in three cases of sudden death associated with protracted use of high-doses of phendimetrazine and/or phenylpropanolamine or bupropion prescribed as anorexiants, in association with other compounds. The main cardiac findings were similar in all three cases: i) mild-moderate hypertrophy of the left ventricle and/or the septum; ii) myocardial non-ischemic scarring (mid-mural and/or sub-epicardial) appearing as discrete foci or with a band/like morphology; iii) mild-moderate intramural small vessel disease, in absence of significant epicardial coronary artery stenosis; iv) acute/recent inflammatory lesions consistent with toxic myocarditis. In summary, the detailed pathology examination of the heart in these three cases revealed myocardial lesions identical to those reported in catecholamine myocardial damage, in all their various stages of evolution. In presence of a clinical history of long-term intake of anorexiants of this category, it is most important at autopsy to recognize and correctly interpret the acute and chronic myocardial lesions of the type herein described, since they represent an anatomical substrate for arrhythmic death...|$|E
40|$|Key factors driving eating {{behavior}} are hunger and satiety, which {{are controlled by}} a complex interplay of central neurotransmitter systems and peripheral stimuli. The lipid-derived messenger oleoylethanolamide (OEA) is released by enterocytes in response to fat intake and indirectly signals satiety to hypothalamic nuclei. Brain histamine is released during the appetitive phase to provide {{a high level of}} arousal in anticipation of feeding, and mediates satiety. However, despite the possible functional overlap of satiety signals, it is not known whether histamine participates in OEA-induced hypophagia. Using different experimental settings and diets, we report that the <b>anorexiant</b> effect of OEA is significantly attenuated in mice deficient in the histamine-synthesizing enzyme histidine decarboxylase (HDC-KO) or acutely depleted of histamine via interocerebroventricular infusion of the HDC blocker α-fluoromethylhistidine (α-FMH). α-FMH abolished OEA-induced early occurrence of satiety onset while increasing histamine release in the CNS with an H 3 receptor antagonist-increased hypophagia. OEA augmented histamine release in the cortex of fasted mice within a time window compatible to its anorexic effects. OEA also increased c-Fos expression in the oxytocin neurons of the paraventricular nuclei of WT but not HDC-KO mice. The density of c-Fos immunoreactive neurons in other brain regions that receive histaminergic innervation and participate in the expression of feeding behavior was comparable in OEA-treated WT and HDC-KO mice. Our results demonstrate that OEA requires the integrity of the brain histamine system to fully exert its hypophagic effect and that the oxytocin neuron-rich nuclei are the likely hypothalamic area where brain histamine influences the central effects of OEA...|$|E
40|$|Background: Crinum purpurascens is a {{herbaceous}} plant belongingto the Amaryllidaceae family. We aimed to evaluatethe antisalmonellal {{properties of the}} leaf extracts and fractionsof C. purpurascens, and the toxicity {{of the most active}} extract. Methods: Three extracts and three fractions were prepared fromthe leaves of Crinum purpurascens Herb. (Amaryllidaceae) andtested for their antisalmonellal activities and toxicity profile. Theantibacterial activity was determined using agar diffusion, agardilution, and broth dilution techniques. Phytochemical screeningof the various extracts and fractions was performed. The toxicityprofile of the CH 2 Cl 2 /MeOH (1 : 1) extract was studied. Results: All the extracts and fractions, except hexane fraction,showed antimicrobial activity against Salmonella typhi, Salmonellaparatyphi A and Salmonella paratyphi B. TheCH 2 Cl 2 /MeOH (1 : 1) extract showed the highest activity. Theminimum inhibitory concentration values were 2. 50 mg/mlagainst S. typhi, and 1. 88 mg/ml against S. paratyphi A and S. paratyphi B. The minimum bactericidal concentration values were 7. 50 mg/ml against S. typhi and 3. 75 mg/ml against S. paratyphiA and S. paratyphi B. Mice administered high doses of extractexhibited reduced reaction to noise, locomotion, reactivity andreaction to pinch, and losses in body weight. Additionally, the ratsthat received high doses of the extract showed increase in liver,spleen and kidney to body weight ratios, and decrease in total proteinconcentrations of the liver and lung, and in hematocrit value. Conclusion: C. purpurascens leaf extract contains antisalmonellalprinciple(s) and at high doses, may have a depressant or sedativeeffect on the central nervous system and analgesic activity.

40|$|Fatty acids ethanolamides (FAEs) are {{a family}} of lipid mediators. A member of this family, anandamide, is an {{endogenous}} ligand for cannabinoid receptors targeted by the marijuana constituent Delta- 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol. Anandamide is now established as a brain endocannabinoid messenger and multiple roles for other FAEs have also been proposed. One emerging function of these lipid mediators is the regulation of feeding behavior and body weight. Anandamide causes overeating in rats because {{of its ability to}} activate cannabinoid receptors. This action is of therapeutic relevance: cannabinoid agonists are currently used to alleviate anorexia and nausea in AIDS patients, whereas the cannabinoid receptor CB 1 antagonist rimonabant was recently found to be effective in the treatment of obesity. In contrast to anandamide, its monounsatured analogue, oleoylethanolamide (OEA), decreases food intake and body weight gain through a cannabinoid receptor-independent mechanism. In the rat proximal small intestine, endogenous OEA levels decrease during fasting and increase upon refeeding. These periprandial fluctuations may represent a previously undescribed signal that modulates between-meal satiety. Pharmacological studies have shown, indeed, that, as a drug, OEA produces profound <b>anorexiant</b> effects in rats and mice, due to selective prolongation of feeding latency and post-meal interval. The effects observed after chronic administration of OEA to different animal models of obesity, clearly indicate that inhibition of eating is not the only mechanism by which OEA can control energy metabolism. In fact, stimulation of lipolysis is responsible for the reduced fat mass and decrease of body weight gain observed in these models. Although OEA may bind to multiple receptors, several lines of evidence indicate that peripheral PPAR-alpha mediates the effects of this compound. The pathophysiological significance of OEA in the regulation of eating and body weight is further evidenced by preliminary clinical results, showing altered levels of this molecule in the cerebrospinal fluid and plasma of subjects recovered from eating disorders. These results complete previous observation on anandamide content, which resulted altered in plasma of women affected by anorexia nervosa or binge-eating disorder...|$|E
