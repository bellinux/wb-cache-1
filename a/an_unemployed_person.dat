500|$|By mid-2000s, the Ballymun towers were in {{the process}} of being torn down, and the Ballymun area was the target of a €1.8billion {{regeneration}} scheme intended to create a self-sustaining community of 30,000 people that would be more successful than the original 1960s plan. [...] Despite their failure as housing, the towers had left a long cultural legacy, of which [...] "Running to Stand Still" [...] was the first and perhaps best-known exemplar; the link between the towers and the song was mentioned in some tourist books about Dublin. [...] Former towers residents were not always happy with the song. [...] Lynn Connolly, whose 2006 memoir The Mun: Growing Up in Ballymun detailed her raising there in the 1970s and 1980s, readily acknowledged the problems there and also wanted to get out at the time. [...] But she later came to realize that there had been much that was good at the towers – in terms of a collective wit among residents and a helping sense of community – which had been ignored by the media. [...] She thus wrote, [...] "regardless of what U2 say in their song, 'Running to Stand Still', there was certainly more than one way out." [...] In a newspaper interview, Connolly suggested that the song might have had a deleterious effect: [...] "It doesn't take a lot of imagination to picture <b>an</b> <b>unemployed</b> <b>person,</b> living alone in a flat in Ballymun, listening to that song and agreeing with what their hero was saying." [...] She further noted that some websites erroneously state that Bono grew up in Ballymun itself, and said, [...] "Perhaps it gave him a sort of street-cred to associate himself with the estate he could see from his bedroom window in nice, safe, respectable Cedarwood Road in Glasnevin." ...|$|E

30|$|Targeted hiring {{subsidies}} are tailored to <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons</b> {{who are still}} able to find subsidized private sector jobs.

Their aims are at least twofold: First, they should motivate a firm to hire <b>a</b> particular <b>unemployed</b> <b>person</b> for <b>a</b> particular job as the subsidy reimburses the firm for a factual or perceived gap between the wage and productivity of the hired person. This might be useful if minimum wages or collectively negotiated wages {{drive a wedge between}} initial individual productivity and wages. Second, subsidies might in the longer term raise tenure of a subsidized worker if an initial skill mismatch diminishes with training on the job. Furthermore, an employer’s uncertainty about an applicant’s productivity will be reduced during the subsidized employment period.|$|R

Our results indicate that the speed with which <b>an</b> <b>unemployed</b> young <b>person</b> finds employment is partly a function of his/her particular characteristics.

We further observe that for young men as well as young women there is strong evidence for non-monotonic duration dependence. These results turn out to remain robust to different specifications and to the introduction of unobserved heterogeneity. ...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, we {{examined}} whether <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons</b> differ from employed ones {{with respect to}} their willingness to accept job offers. The answer to this question is important to our understanding of interregional disparities in unemployment. Theoretically, <b>an</b> <b>unemployed</b> individual might simply relocate if there were a suitable job in another region. As differences in regional unemployment rates and available jobs indicate, this mechanism for labour market equilibrium does not function well. There are two possible reasons for this dysfunction. On the one hand, <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons</b> may refuse to accept job offers that require regional relocation. This argument is consistent with findings that individuals generally do not like to relocate because of the associated monetary and non-monetary costs (Lee 1966; Sjaastad 1962). These costs may be distributed unequally between unemployed and employed individuals. On the other hand, <b>unemployed</b> <b>persons</b> may not differ in their acceptance of interregional job offers but simply obtain fewer such offers from employers or may not search actively in other regions.|$|R
30|$|In an ideal-type, old-age {{part-time}} work programme employers received a subsidy if they: (a) established a phase-out programme for older workers and topped up their pension contributions during the {{part-time work}} period; and (b) hired <b>a</b> young <b>unemployed</b> <b>person</b> as <b>a</b> replacement worker. One prominent {{example is the}} system that was place in Germany until 2009 (Altersteilzeit). However, old-age part-time work neither helped to retain older workers, as it was hardly used for progressive retirement but rather for premature exit from work, nor was there any {{positive effect on the}} employment of younger workers (see the evaluation study by Wanger 2009). Indeed, at best it was neutral regarding its effects on younger workers while effectively lowering the employment rate of older workers. This is also confirmed by the similar case of Austria (Graf et al. 2011). Furthermore, the costs for subsidised early retirement had to be borne by employers and employees via social security contributions. In turn, this might have actually reduced overall demand for labour, therefore with detrimental effects on younger people. Accordingly, removing older workers from the labour market can harm the employment prospects of younger people.|$|R
