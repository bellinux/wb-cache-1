5|$|In {{the novels}} Halo: Fall of Reach and Halo: The Flood, it is {{told that the}} Grunts are methane {{breathers}} and described as dog-like. They have methane suits {{that allow them to}} remove the breathing apparatuses they usually wear to sustain them in a non-methane atmosphere. In Halo Reach, if a player kills <b>a</b> <b>Grunt</b> in a particular way, their methane tank will ignite causing them to fly and bounce around the area out of control, causing damage if they hit the player.|$|E
25|$|As {{toxicity}} progresses {{the combination}} of signs becomes more characteristic of tick envenoming. There is progressive limb weakness which is seen first in the hind legs. A dog may appear to walk as though 'drunken' (ataxic). There may be an inability to climb stairs or an inability to turn in tight circles without stumbling. The respiration may become slower and have <b>a</b> <b>grunt</b> {{at the end of}} expiration. Some animals are easily panicked at this stage and should be handled calmly (especially cats).|$|E
25|$|When {{the first}} {{prisoners of war}} were captured, the German Army’s superiority was put on display by making them march through towns, which {{produced}} scenes of collective hate. In certain train stations, mannequins dressed in Allied uniforms were hung, visible to prisoners passing by in trains: “I noticed that in many stations, the Krauts hung mannequins depicting sometimes a zouave, other times <b>a</b> <b>grunt</b> or an artilleryman”. Camp visits were organised for schoolchildren. “Sunday, schoolchildren ordered about by their teachers with drums, fifes and flags toured the camp. We had to tour the cinemas and the…menageries surrounding the city, for the public would not stop flooding in. They were especially curious to see the troops from Africa”.|$|E

2500|$|Every episode one {{of several}} games is played, all {{revolving}} around predicting how the Nation responded to poll questions. The winner (if there is one) gets to pick a video {{of his or her}} choice to be replayed. It is announced with a little voice saying, [...] "What time is it?," [...] with crowd saying [...] "Game Time!" [...] followed by <b>a</b> <b>grunt.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The Economist {{wrote on}} 6 January that on {{hearing of the}} campaign, [...] "the fashionable {{response}} in many sophisticated circles was a giggle", but it had transformed into [...] "something louder than <b>a</b> <b>grunt</b> of admiration". The newspaper concluded that the campaign [...] "may very well have accomplished, in the past week, the extraordinary feat of edging a national mood just an odd half-degree in the right direction". Likewise, the Financial Times regarded it as [...] "a beacon of light in an otherwise dismal economic and industrial prospect" [...] but encouraged the diversion of the campaign into opposing absenteeism and restrictive practices as well as encouraging individuals [...] "to identify their efforts with {{the success or failure}} of the country as a whole".|$|E

6000|$|Tarzan, {{following}} a natural impulse to aid his ally, leaped forward {{to enter the}} dispute only to be checked by <b>a</b> <b>grunted</b> admonition from Om-at. [...] "Back!" [...] he said. [...] "This fight is mine, alone." ...|$|R

6000|$|Here Tom {{bowed his}} head, and after <b>a</b> <b>grunting</b> sob or two, {{he raised his}} {{handkerchief}} in a very pathetic manner to his face, and THOUGHT to himself--"Well, if she stand THAT, the Lord only knows what I shall say next." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With Thee, oh, my Beloved, to do a dak [...] (a dak I {{believe is}} a sort of uncomfortable post-journey) [...] On the pack-saddle of <b>a</b> <b>grunting</b> yak, [...] With never room for {{chilling}} chaperone, [...] 'Twere better than a Panhard in the Park." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stand off!" [...] he yelled, and {{his voice}} rang through the woods; he noticed how harsh and wild it sounded in the silence. He heard <b>a</b> <b>grunting</b> sound, and gave one glance at the two men writhing amid the ferns silent as {{grappling}} bull-dogs.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Travers made an inarticulate noise partaking of a groan and <b>a</b> <b>grunt.</b>|$|E

50|$|Little {{is known}} of its biology and behaviour, {{although}} it {{is known to be}} nocturnal, and an active burrower. They feed primarily on ants and termites. They have been reported to make <b>a</b> <b>grunting</b> call, and to give birth to a single young at a time.|$|R
6000|$|Here {{a violent}} of sneezing, which the mendicant {{was unable to}} suppress, and {{which could not be}} {{considered}} by any means as the dying fall of an echo, accompanied by <b>a</b> <b>grunting</b> half-smothered cough, confounded the two treasure-seekers. [...] "Lord have mercy on us!" [...] said the Baronet.|$|R

5000|$|This is a noisy bird during mating, but its vocalisations {{are quite}} {{different}} from the Eurasian coot. It gives a fast kerrre like the little crake, a harsh ka-haa and <b>a</b> <b>grunting</b> hoot [...] "oot oot" [...] that suggests that the name [...] "coot" [...] might be onomatopoeia, but inspection of the etymology of [...] "coot" [...] fairly decisively negates any such suggestion.|$|R
