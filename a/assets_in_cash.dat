50|$|Budgetary {{problems}} caused the Greek government to dichotomization of the drachma. Unable to secure any more loans from abroad {{to finance the}} war with Turkey, in 1922 Finance Minister Petros Protopapadakis declared that each drachma was essentially to be cut in half. Half {{of the value of}} the drachma would be kept by the owner, and the other half would be surrendered by the government in exchange for a 20-year 6.5% loan. World War II led to these loans not being repaid, but even if the war had not occurred it is doubtful that the Greek government would have been able to repay such enormous debts to its own populace. This strategy led to large revenues for the Greek state, and inflation effects were minimal. This strategy was repeated again in 1926 due to the government’s inability to pay back loans incurred from the decade of war and the resettlement of the refugees.

40|$|In the {{research}} area of Chinese auditing market, {{few studies have}} been conducted on the effects that auditor-related characteristics have on auditing quality. Thus, the paper is to examine the influences auditor-related attributes have on auditing quality, including size of the auditing firm, its income, and whether it is Big 4 or not. In addition to that, research topic on relationship between relationship between market concentration level and auditing quality is also an attractive one among {{the research}}ers. However, many studies on this subject is usually performed on a short-run periods and many suggest with a dominative market structure. Thus this paper wants to broaden the time period of data to have a larger sample base and thus to test the relationship between market concentration and auditing quality to see whether the government should promote dominative market structure or not. Therefore, this paper mainly investigates two subjects in the Chinese auditing market: 1) auditor-related attributes’ impact on auditing quality; 2) market concentration level and its impact on auditing quality. In auditor-related attributes’ impact on auditing quality study, Total Accruals, which is the sum of the changes in current <b>assets,</b> <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> and cash equivalents, in current liabilities, in the current portion of debt and plus the amount of depreciation and amortization, is adopted as the proxy of the auditing quality of a listed firm as a firm will have low earning quality when holding high accruals. The subsequent multiple regression model demonstrates that auditor-related attributes, such as auditor’s income, its size, and whether it is BIG 4 or not, are not determinants of earning quality and auditing quality in China’s auditing market. Then in market concentration level and its impact on auditing quality part, the market share of the top four largest and eight auditing firms in the four areas of No. of Customers, Customers’ Assets, Auditor’s Income and Customers’ Income is used to measure the market concentration level, and it is found that overall the Chinese auditing market is characterized by oligopolistic competition. And the BIG 4 are found to outperform domestic CPA firms, especially in premium client segment. Then using Qualified Opinion, Adverse Opinion and Disclaimer of Opinion report as the proxy of good auditing work of an auditing firm, a reserve relationship is discovered by conducting regression analysis between concentration ratio and proxy of auditing quality. This indicates the need to reduce market concentration level in the Chinese auditing market so as to increase auditor’s auditing quality...|$|E
40|$|This study aims to {{determine}} the condition of LQ 45 index futures prices and basis of decision making. The existence of futures contracts is very useful for financial managers {{for the absence of}} futures contracts, money managers will only have one trading location to change the portfolio's position at the time they receive new information which was expected to change the value of managed <b>assets</b> <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> market or spot market. In this study, the author took the hypothesis is assumed that the value of LQ 45 index futures in the period of this study is not fair (undervalued / overvalued). This study uses the period 2007 until the year 2009. Data analysis tools used {{to determine}} pricing futures and testing hypotheses is a pricing model that futures contracts do not provide income to the formula F 0 = S 0 erT. Theoretical futures price can be higher than the market price in cash (the premium) or lower than the market price in cash (at a discount. Futures pricing model is very influential on futures prices. Efficiency of stock index futures market occurred while the stock index futures prices fluctuated or the price level will adjust so that prices quickly reflect the new information form. Movement or change in price as a proof that the markets function well and get the information efficiently. Based on the results of research showing LQ 45 index futures prices are not reasonable (undervalued / overvalued) proves that occurred in the efficiency of stock index futures market because of movement / change in price. Based on data analysis using futures pricing model using the model contract does not provide income to show that the LQ 45 index futures prices from January 2007 to December 2009 there were 36 times the transaction (transactions monthly). Things futures price is not reasonable because all year in 2007 stated that 25 % in 75 % overvalued and undervalued in the state. In the year 2008 states that in 16. 67 % 83. 33 % overvalued and undervalued in the state. Similarly in 2009 the conditions LQ 45 index futures price of 16. 67 % in 83. 33 % overvalued and undervalued in the state.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is {{therefore}} twofold. First, to establish the claim that currency in circulation has been rising. Second, to empirically quantify and give a full account of the reasons determining the dynamics and volatility of currency in circulation. Using annual data for the 1965 - 2004 period, this paper confirms that currency in circulation as a proportion of money stock has increased. From the initial estimation results, the paper establishes strong positive effects of inflation rate, underground economy activities, financial deepening on the CU/M 2 ratio, and significant negative effect of interest rates on this ratio. The other highlight result from this study is the positive and significant association between small-scale agriculture produce and CU/M 2 ratio. Using annual data, among other things, this study confirms findings from other studies that cash preference is a function of real interest rates. However, one striking finding here is the importance small-scale agriculture as a determinant of currency in circulation. This reflects the agriculture-dependent nature of the economy. Better performance of this sector injects cash in the economy and because of the lack of banking facilities in rural areas, most of the injected cash remains in circulation. The message from empirical results using monthly data is similar, with interest rates, financial deepening, tobacco selling season dummy and inflation rate playing significant roles in determining movements in currency in circulation. As expected, technological innovations in the banking system or payment systems, particularly cash dispensers (ATMs) have a significant impact on the overall level of currency in circulation, whereas no major impact seems to come from the MALSWITCH smart card, however, initial indications reveal its negative effect on the CU/M 2 ratio. Policy implications from these results are many. First, of late the Bank has reduced the bank rate and as is normally the case, all other interest rates were similarly adjusted. While the policy move has or is on course to achieve its intended goals, it has other side repercussions such as deposit taking capabilities by commercial banks. Currently, the minimum saving rate for the four major commercial banks averages around 7. 5 %. This against the current monthly inflation rate of 12. 2 (for October 2004) leaves real savings rate of around – 4. 7 % which rationally discourages savings mobilisation and consequent reduction in the availability of loanable funds for productive investment and economic growth. The public is most likely to hold their <b>assets</b> <b>in</b> <b>cash</b> rather than bank deposit form since the opportunity cost of doing so is essentially zero. However, due to high inflation in the past, savers in Malawi were used to high interest rates so that current demand deposits are considered as unattractive and non-worthwhile form of holding money. It is time the public get used to lower interest rates as in other countries and on the belief that causality direction is from interest rates to inflation, the reduction in the bank rate could eventually lead to a drop in inflation and, therefore, an increase in the real interest rate. Second, if the Bank intends to focus on reducing the CU/M 2 ratio, intensification of smart card use and publicity could play an important role. The smart card is a direct alternative of cash as a means of payment so that its widespread use can directly reduce currency in circulation. This, as is the case in other countries could also reduce the positive impact of ATM transactions on the overall level of currency in circulation. Third, the overall civic education on the use of banking facilities, in rural areas as well as to small-scale business men (vendors) is important for increased deposit taking and, therefore, the reduction in the amount of currency in circulation.

A renewal order-generation process is used having a waiting-time distribution between consecutive orders that follows a Weibull law, in line with previous studies. The simulation results show that this mechanism can reproduce fat-tailed distributions of returns without ad-hoc behavioral assumptions on agents. In the simulated trade process, when the order waiting-times are exponentially distributed, trade waiting times are exponentially distributed. However, if order waiting times follow a Weibull law, analogous results do not hold. These findings are interpreted in terms of a random thinning of the order renewal process. This behavior is compared with order and trade durations taken from real financial data...|$|R
