50|$|The {{fundamental}} steps in contact fabrication are semiconductor surface cleaning, contact metal deposition, patterning and annealing. Surface cleaning may {{be performed by}} sputter-etching, chemical etching, reactive gas etching or ion milling. For example, the native oxide of silicon may be removed with an hydrofluoric <b>acid</b> <b>dip,</b> while GaAs is more typically cleaned by a bromine-methanol dip. After cleaning, metals are deposited via sputter deposition, evaporation or chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Sputtering is a faster and more convenient method of metal deposition than evaporation but the ion bombardment from the plasma may induce surface states or even invert the charge carrier type at the surface. For this reason the gentler but still rapid CVD is increasingly preferred. Patterning of contacts is accomplished with standard photolithographic methods such as lift-off, where contact metal is deposited through holes in a photoresist layer that is later dissolved away. Post-deposition annealing of contacts is useful for relieving stress {{as well as for}} inducing any desirable reactions between the metal and the semiconductor.|$|E

40|$|A {{major problem}} for the mussel {{aquaculture}} industry on Prince Edward Island, Canada surfaced in the late 1990 s {{with the introduction of}} a fouling organism commonly known as the clubbed tunicate, Styela clava. This organism has the ability to infest mussel cultivation equipment to the point where productivity is severely compromised. This study examined the effects two anti-fouling treatments, air exposure and acetic acid, had on experimental mussel populations. Socked mussel seed obtained from a mussel farm on Prince Edward Island was exposed to three treatment regimes and subsequently placed on a long-line in New London Bay, P. E. I. The treatments were a 40 -h air exposure, 30 -s 5 % acetic acid immersion and a 2 -min 5 % acetic acid immersion. Treatment effects on mussels were measured after seven months in the field, along with untreated controls. Mussel quality was assessed using mussel sock weights, length, condition index and changes in genetic characteristics measured at allozyme loci. A significant decrease in mean sock weights was found for all three treatments compared to control sock weights (p< 0. 05). Sock weights for the air exposure, 30 -s acetic <b>acid</b> <b>dip</b> and 2 -min acetic <b>acid</b> <b>dip</b> were reduced by 38 %, 67 %, and 74 % respectively compared to control sock weights. This revealed a significant loss in productivity (incl. mortality and loss of attachment) in the treated mussel populations. However, results on the other characteristics used to assess mussel fitness found no long-term effects on the health or genetic structure of the mussel populations that survived the treatment regimes. Although air exposure is now considered an inefficient method to kill post-larval Styela clava, the results provide preliminary evidence regarding the safe use of the acetic acid treatment regimes tested in terms of long-term mussel population health.

40|$|In this paper, the {{corrosion}} mechanism behind damp heat-induced {{degradation of}} screen-printed silver front-side contacts of silicon solar cells {{due to the}} presence of acetic acid, which is known to be a decomposition product of the most common module encapsulation material ethylene vinyl acetate, is investigated. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) investigations and solder and peel-tests show that the interaction between screen-printed contacts and acetic acid results in a significant adhesion loss of the front-side metallization due to the corrosion of the glass layer inside the contacts. The application of a reductive potential to the front contact accelerates this process considerably and enables it at lower acetic acid concentrations. The analysis of the dissolved corrosion products of the contact (lead, silver) by chemical trace analysis (inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry) and the generation of Pourbaix diagrams of lead in acetic acid enable the elaboration of a detailed model, which suggests a cycle of dissolution and subsequent reduction of the dissolved species as the mechanism behind the corrosion of the contacts in the model experiment and most probably in module application.

40|$|Litchi (Litchi chinensis Sonn.) is a {{tropical}} to subtropical crop that originated in South-East Asia. Litchi fruit are prized {{on the world}} market for their flavour, semi-translucent white aril and attractive red skin. Litchi is now grown commercially in many countries and production in Australia, China, Israel, South Africa and Thailand has expanded markedly in recent years. Increased production has made significant contributions to economic development in these countries, especially those in South-East Asia. Non-climacteric litchi fruit are harvested at their visual and organoleptic optimum. They are highly perishable and, consequently, have a short life that limits marketability and potential expansion of demand. Pericarp browning and pathological decay are common and important defects of harvested litchi fruit. Postharvest technologies have been developed to reduce these defects. These technologies involve cooling and heating the fruit, use of various packages and packaging materials and the application of fungicides and other chemicals. Through the use of fungicides and refrigeration, litchi fruit have a storage life of about 30 days. However, when they are removed from storage, their shelf life at ambient temperature is very short due to pericarp browning and fruit rotting. Low temperature acclimation or use of chitsoan as a coating can extend the shelf life. Sulfur dioxide fumigation effectively reduces pericarp browning, but approval from Europe, Australia and Japan for this chemical is likely to be withdrawn due to concerns over sulfur residues in fumigated fruit. Thus, sulfur-free postharvest treatments that maintain fruit skin colour are increasingly important. Alternatives to SO 2 fumigation for control of pericarp browning and fruit rotting are pre-storage pathogen management, anoxia treatment, and dipping in 2 % hydrogen chloride solution for 6 - 8 min following storage at 0 degrees C. Insect disinfestation has become increasingly important for the expansion of export markets because of quarantine issues associated with some fruit fly species. Thus, effective disinfestation protocols need to be developed. Heat treatment has shown promise as a quarantine technology, but it injures pericarp tissue and results in skin browning. However, heat treatment can be combined with an <b>acid</b> <b>dip</b> treatment that inhibits browning. Therefore, the primary aim of postharvest litchi research remains the achievement of highly coloured fruit which is free of pests and disease.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{behind the}} present {{work is to}} develop a novel method for electrodeposition of alloys directly from their ores thereby avoiding costly and tedious procedures. The study involved optimization of the working parameters including the bath composition because most of them did influence the deposit quality. The alloys under consideration were ferrochromium (Fe-Cr), ferrotungsten (Fe-W) and ferrocopper (Fe-Cu) to be deposited from their respective indigenously available ores i. e. chromite, scheelite and chalcopyrite. It is the use of indigenous ores, simpler cost-effective procedure involved in the deposition and better features of the deposited alloys together with the potential for greater industrial applications that make this study significant. Making conditions of the so-called Metal Salt Method (MSM) as the starting point, experimental parameters have been optimized to achieve greater efficiency of the process as well as quality of the deposits. Optimization of the working conditions involved adjusting the bath composition for its various components and other variables such as pH, temperature, Cathodic Current Density (CCD) which was applied either as Continuous Direct Current (CDC) or Pulsed Direct Current (PDC). Considering that all the alloys contain paramagnetic metal(s) /ion(s), the study has also been under taken in the presence of weak magnetic field (upto 0. 2 T) which proved to significantly improve the deposit quality by decreasing the grain size in all the cases. The process efficiency has been monitored through the deposition rate (amount of alloy deposited per unit area of cathode per unit time). Morphological features of the deposits like uniformity, shine, colour etc., in the first instance, were examined by visual inspection under an ordinary microscope while for the elaborated surface properties the deposits have been monitored making use of Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The alloy compositions have been determined by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS). Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) was also used in some selected cases to complement the AAS results. Hardness of the deposited film was checked by a durometer. Corrosion resistance using salt spray apparatus and the <b>acid</b> <b>dip</b> test provided the chemical â€˜inertnessâ€™ of the deposits. The hardness and chemical inertness of the alloys were in no way inferior to those obtained by MSM while the alloy compositions were also in the desired range.

40|$|The {{integration}} of photonics with electronics {{has emerged as}} a leading platform for microprocessor technology and the continuation of Moore's Law. As electronic device dimensions shrink, electronic signals encounter crippling delays and heating issues such that signal transduction across large on-chip distances becomes increasingly more difficult. However, these issues may be mitigated by the use of photonic interconnects combined with electronic devices in electronic-photonic integrated circuits (EPICs). The electronics in proposed EPIC designs perform the logic operations and short-distance signal transmission, while photonic devices serve to transmit signals over longer lengths. However, the photonic devices are large compared to electronic devices, and thus the two types of devices would ideally exist on separate levels of the microprocessor stack in order to maximize the amount of silicon substrate available for electronic device fabrication. A CMOS-compatible back-end process for the fabrication of photonic devices is necessary to realize such a three-dimensional EPIC. Back-end processing is limited in thermal budget and does not present a single-crystal substrate for epitaxial growth, however, so high-quality crystal fabrication methods currently used for photonic device fabrication are not possible in back-end processing. This thesis presents a method for the fabrication of high-quality germanium single crystals using CMOS-compatible back-end processing. Initial work on the ultra-high vacuum chemical vapor deposition of polycrystalline germanium on amorphous silicon is presented. The deposition can be successfully performed by using a pre-growth hydrofluoric <b>acid</b> <b>dip</b> and by limiting the thickness of the amorphous silicon layer to less than 120 nm. Films deposited at temperatures of 350 ° C, 450 ° C, and 550 ° C show (110) texture, though the texture is most prevalent in growths at 450 ° C. Poly-Ge grown at 4500 C is successfully doped n-type in situ, and the grain size of as-grown material is enhanced by lateral growth over a barrier. Structures are fabricated for the growth of Ge confined in one dimension. The growths show faceting across large areas, in contrast to as-deposited poly-Ge, corresponding to enhanced grain sizes. Growth confinement is shown to reduce the defect density as the poly-Ge grows. When coalesced into a continuous film, the material grown from 1 D confinement exhibits a lower carrier density and lower trap density than as-deposited poly-Ge, indicating improved material quality. We measure an increased grain size from as-deposited poly-Ge to Ge grown from ID confinement. Single-crystal germanium is grown at 450 ° C from confinement in two dimensions. Such growths exhibit faceting across the entire crystal as well as the presence of E 3 boundaries ({ 111 } twins), with many growths showing no other boundaries. These twins mediate the growth of the crystal, as they serve as the points for heterogeneous surface nucleation of adatom clusters. The twins can form after the crystal nucleates and are strongly preferred in order to obtain appreciable crystal growth rates. We model the growths from the confining channels in order to find the optimum channel geometry for large, uniform, single-crystal growths that consistently emerge from the channel. The growths from 2 D confinement show lower trap density than those from 1 D confinement, indicating a further enhancement of the crystal quality due to the increased confinement. This method of single-crystal growth from an amorphous substrate is extensible to any materials system in which selective non-epitaxial deposition is possible. by Kevin A. McComber. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|This work {{evaluates the}} effect of acetic <b>acid</b> <b>dipping</b> on the growth of L. monocytogenes on poultry legs stored at 4 °C for eight days. Fresh inoculated chicken legs were dipped into either a 1 % or 2 % acetic acid {{solution}} (v/v) or distilled water (control). Changes in mesophiles, psychrotrophs, Enterobacteriaceae counts and sensorial characteristics (odor, color, texture and overall appearance) were also evaluated. The shelf life of the samples washed with acetic acid was extended by at least two days over the control samples washed with distilled water. L. monocytogenes counts before decontamination were 5. 57 log UFC/g, and after treatment with 2 % acetic acid (Day 0), L. monocytogenes counts were 4. 47 log UFC/g. Legs washed with 2 % acetic acid showed a significant (p < 0. 05) inhibitory effect on L. monocytogenes compared to control legs, with a decrease of about 1. 31 log units after eight days of storage. Sensory quality was not adversely affected by acetic acid. This study demonstrates that while acetic acid did reduce populations of L. monocytogenes on meat, it did not completely inactivate the pathogen. The application of acetic acid {{may be used as}} an additional hurdle contributing to extend the shelf life of raw poultry and reducing populations of L. monocytogenes...|$|R

When the CeO 2 buffer layers were exposed to UV light, water contact angles diminished drastically, however, an apparent effect on the superconducting properties was not observed.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the teat end health and skin conditioning performance of two experimental heptanoic <b>acid</b> based teat <b>dips</b> vs the commercial product Remain Gold ® using a split udder design during the winter season under best management winter milking practices. The experimental heptanoic <b>acid</b> teat <b>dips</b> KX- 6185 and KX- 6186 showed similar teat end health and teat skin conditioning to Remain Gold under winter conditions. Marked changes in teat end scores were measured over time and over periods as short as days. On the other hand, product treatment comparisons frequently showed parallel trends in score averages. This illustrates the importance of a split udder design to evaluate skin conditioning performance. The split udder design minimizes the risk of experimental bias due to cow and environmental factors. Most reported teat skin studies rely on comparing teat dips in separate cow groups with little consideration to group balancing even though factors such as hyperkeratosis is known to be affected by cow age and lactation stage. This study illustrates the high risk of traditional design skin toleration studies inaccurately attributing effects to teat dips...|$|R
