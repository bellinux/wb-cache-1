5|$|On December1, Epsilon began a {{northeast}} motion due to {{an approaching}} trough, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day it attained hurricane status. After turning to the east, it developed characteristics of an annular hurricane, meaning it had a circular eye, a ring of convection, and had few fluctuations in its intensity. On December5 Epsilon attained peak winds of 85mph (140km/h), <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> day it turned {{to the south and}} southwest. Late on December7, the winds dropped below hurricane status {{for the first time in}} five days, making Epsilon the longest-lasting December hurricane on record. Stronger wind shear caused rapid weakening, and the storm could no longer be classified as a tropical cyclone late on December8. The next day the remnant circulation of Epsilon dissipated.|$|E

5|$|The Moon orbits the Earth in {{approximately}} 27.3 days, {{relative to a}} fixed frame of reference. This {{is known as the}} sidereal month.
