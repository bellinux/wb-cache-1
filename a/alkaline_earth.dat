5|$|Being {{the second}} period 8 element, unbinilium is {{predicted}} to be an <b>alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> metal, below beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, and radium. Each of these elements has two valence electrons in the outermost s-orbital (valence electron configuration ns2), which is easily lost in chemical reactions to form the +2 oxidation state: thus the <b>alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> metals are rather reactive elements, {{with the exception of}} beryllium due to its small size. Unbinilium is predicted to continue the trend and have a valence electron configuration of 8s2. It is therefore expected to behave much like its lighter congeners; however, it is also predicted to differ from the lighter <b>alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> metals in some properties.|$|E

30|$|Further, Chadha’s (1999) plot can be {{classified}} into eight fields as given below: (1) <b>alkaline</b> <b>earths</b> exceed alkali metals, (2) alkali metals exceed <b>alkaline</b> <b>earths</b> (3) weak acidic anions exceed strong acidic anions, (4) strong acidic anions exceed weak acidic anions, (5) <b>alkaline</b> <b>earths</b> and weak acidic anions exceed both alkali metals and strong acidic anions, respectively, (6) <b>alkaline</b> <b>earths</b> exceed alkali metals and strong acidic anions exceed weak acidic anions, (7) alkali metals exceed <b>alkaline</b> <b>earths</b> and strong acidic anions exceed weak acidic anions, and (8) alkali metals exceed <b>alkaline</b> <b>earths</b> and weak acidic anions exceed strong acidic anions. The output of Chadha’s plot (Fig.  5) is in confirmation with that of Piper trilinear diagram (Fig.  4) in that <b>alkaline</b> <b>earths</b> exceed alkali metals (field 1), strong acidic anions exceed weak acidic anions (field 4) and <b>alkaline</b> <b>earths</b> exceed alkali metals and strong acidic anions exceed weak acidic anions (field 6).

5|$|Unbinilium has not {{yet been}} synthesized, despite {{multiple}} attempts from German and Russian teams. One 2011 attempt from the German team had a suggestive but not conclusive result suggesting the possible production of 299Ubn, but there were several inconsistencies with the theoretically expected decay energies and half-lives of 299Ubn and its daughters and the implanting compound nucleus and evaporation residue could not be identified with certainty. Planned attempts from Russian, Japanese, and French teams are scheduled for 2017–2020. Experimental evidence from these attempts show that the period 8 elements will likely be far more difficult to synthesise than the previous known elements, and that unbinilium may even be the last element that can be synthesized with current technology. Its position as the seventh <b>alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> metal suggests that it would have similar properties to its lighter congeners, beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, and radium; however, relativistic effects may cause some of its properties to differ from those expected from a straight application of periodic trends. For example, unbinilium is expected to be less reactive than barium and radium and be closer in behavior to strontium, and while it should show the characteristic +2 oxidation state of the <b>alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> metals, it is also predicted to show the +4 oxidation state unknown in any other <b>alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> metal.|$|E
5|$|Alkali metals form ionic {{and highly}} soluble monofluorides; these have the cubic {{arrangement}} of sodium chloride and analogous chlorides. <b>Alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> difluorides possess strong ionic bonds but are insoluble in water, {{with the exception}} of beryllium difluoride, which also exhibits some covalent character and has a quartz-like structure. Rare earth elements and many other metals form mostly ionic trifluorides.|$|E
5|$|Barium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolBa and atomic number56. It {{is the fifth}} element in group 2 and is a soft, silvery <b>alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> metal. Because of its high chemical reactivity, barium is never found in nature as a free element. Its hydroxide, known in pre-modern history as baryta, does not occur as a mineral, but can be prepared by heating barium carbonate.|$|E
30|$|The Chadha diagram (Chadha 1999) {{was used}} to define the major water types in the areas. It is a {{modified}} version of the Piper (1944) diagram and plots the difference in milliequivalent percentage between <b>alkaline</b> <b>earths</b> (Ca + Mg) and alkali metals (Na + K) expressed as percentage and plotted on the x-axis. The difference in milliequivalent percentage between weak acidic anions (CO 3  + HCO 3) and strong acidic anions (Cl + SO 4) is plotted on the y-axis. The rectangular field resulting from this is similar to the diamond-shaped field in the Piper diagram and describes the overall character of the water. Thus, there are eight fields in the rectangular plot which represent eight different water types as in the case of Piper diagram. Those eight water types are: (1) <b>alkaline</b> <b>earths</b> exceed alkali metals; (2) alkali metals exceed alkaline earths; (3) weak acidic anions exceed strong acidic anions; (4) strong acidic anions exceed weak acidic anions; (5) <b>alkaline</b> <b>earths</b> and weak acidic anions exceed both alkali metals and strong acidic anions, respectively (such water has temporary hardness); (6) <b>alkaline</b> <b>earths</b> exceed alkali metals and strong acidic anions exceed weak acidic anions (such water has permanent hardness); (7) alkali metals exceed <b>alkaline</b> <b>earths</b> and strong acidic anions exceed weak acidic anions; (8) alkali metals exceed <b>alkaline</b> <b>earths</b> and weak acidic anions exceed strong acidic anions (Chadha 1999).|$|R
30|$|The {{hardness}} {{of water}} {{is due to the}} presence of <b>alkaline</b> <b>earths</b> such as calcium and magnesium and exists in bicarbonate forms.|$|R
30|$|The {{output of}} Piper trilinear diagram is {{confirmed}} with the Chadha’s plot that maximum samples for surface water belong to <b>alkaline</b> <b>earths</b> and weak acidic anions exceed alkali metals and strong acidic anions, as Ca 2 +–Mg 2 +–HCO 3 − water type for both seasons, respectively. Only few samples of surface water fall in alkali metals exceed <b>alkaline</b> <b>earths</b> and weak acidic anions exceed strong acidic anions {{as indicated by}} Na+–HCO 3 − type of water.|$|R
5|$|Manganese {{phosphating}} is {{used for}} rust and corrosion prevention on steel. Ionized manganese is used industrially as pigments of various colors, which depend on the oxidation state of the ions. The permanganates of alkali and <b>alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> metals are powerful oxidizers. Manganese dioxide is used as the cathode (electron acceptor) material in zinc-carbon and alkaline batteries.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of unbinilium {{is predicted to}} be {{similar to that of the}} <b>alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> metals, but it would probably behave more like calcium or strontium than barium or radium. Like strontium, unbinilium should react vigorously with air to form an oxide (UbnO) and with water to form the hydroxide (Ubn(OH)2), which would be a strong base, and releasing hydrogen gas. It should also react with the halogens to form salts such as UbnCl2. While these reactions would be expected from periodic trends, their lowered intensity is somewhat unusual, as ignoring relativistic effects, periodic trends would predict unbinilium to be even more reactive than barium or radium. This lowered reactivity is due to the relativistic stabilization of unbinilium's valence electron, increasing unbinilium's first ionization energy and decreasing the metallic and ionic radii; this effect is already seen for radium. the {{chemistry of}} unbinilium in the +2 oxidation state should be more similar to the chemistry of strontium than to that of radium. On the other hand, the ionic radius of the Ubn2+ ion is predicted to be larger than that of Sr2+, because the 7p orbitals are destabilized and are thus larger than the p-orbitals of the lower shells. Unbinilium may also show the +4 oxidation state, which is not seen in any other <b>alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> metal, in addition to the +2 oxidation state that is characteristic of the other <b>alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> metals and is also the main oxidation state of all the known <b>alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> metals: this is because of the destabilization and expansion of the 7p3/2 spinor, causing its outermost electrons to have a lower ionization energy than what would otherwise be expected. The +1 state may also be stable in isolation. Many unbinilium compounds are expected to have a large covalent character, due to the involvement of the 7p3/2 electrons in the bonding: this effect is also seen to a lesser extent in radium, which shows some 6s and 6p3/2 contribution to the bonding in radium fluoride (RaF2) and astatide (RaAt2), resulting in these compounds having more covalent character. The standard reduction potential of the Ubn2+/Ubn couple is predicted to be −2.9V.|$|E
5|$|Beryllium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Be and atomic number 4. It {{is a relatively}} rare element in the universe, usually occurring {{as a product of}} the spallation of larger atomic nuclei that have collided with cosmic rays. Within the cores of stars beryllium is depleted as it is fused and creates larger elements. It is a divalent element which occurs naturally only in combination with other elements in minerals. Notable gemstones which contain beryllium include beryl (aquamarine, emerald) and chrysoberyl. As a free element it is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight and brittle <b>alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> metal.|$|E
30|$|The system SiO 2 -H 2 O is {{too simple}} for {{modeling}} natural processes because neither Al 2 O 3 nor alkali metals and <b>alkaline</b> <b>earths</b> are involved. The system Na 2 O-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 is more realistic even though <b>alkaline</b> <b>earths,</b> in particular, {{have not yet}} been addressed. The Na 2 O-Al 2 O 3 -SiO 2 system is also useful for characterization of the chemical interaction between nonbridging oxygen and important network-modifying cation (Na+) and protons (H+).|$|R

5|$|Calcium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Ca and atomic number 20. An <b>alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> metal, calcium is a reactive pale yellow metal that forms a dark oxide-nitride layer {{when exposed to}} air. Its {{physical and chemical properties}} are most similar to its heavier homologues strontium and barium. It is the fifth most abundant element in Earth's crust and the third most abundant metal, after iron and aluminium. The most common calcium compound on Earth is calcium carbonate, found in limestone and the fossilised remnants of early sea life; gypsum, anhydrite, fluorite, and apatite are also sources of calcium.|$|E
5|$|For {{the primary}} deposits, the source pegmatites, {{which are usually}} {{obtained}} by mining, are divided into small parts and then undergo flotation. <b>Alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> metal carbonates may be removed after reaction with hydrogen chloride; then follow thickening, filtration, and calcination. The result is a concentrate with rare-earth content of up to 90%. Secondary materials (such as coastal sands) undergo gravity separation. Magnetic separation follows, {{with a series of}} magnets of increasing strength. Monazite obtained by this method can be as pure as 98%.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} compare nobelium's chemical behavior to that of terbium, californium, and fermium. All four elements were reacted with chlorine and the resulting chlorides were deposited along a tube, along which they were carried by a gas. It {{was found that the}} nobelium chloride produced was strongly adsorbed on solid surfaces, proving that it was not very volatile, like the chlorides of the other three investigated elements. However, both NoCl2 and NoCl3 were expected to exhibit nonvolatile behavior and hence this experiment was inconclusive as to what the preferred oxidation state of nobelium was. Determination of nobelium's favoring of the +2 state had to wait until the next year, when cation-exchange chromatography and coprecipitation {{experiments were}} carried out on around fifty thousand 255No atoms, finding that it behaved differently from the other actinides and more like the divalent <b>alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> metals. This proved that in aqueous solution, nobelium is most stable in the divalent state when strong oxidizers are absent. Later experimentation in 1974 showed that nobelium eluted with the <b>alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> metals, between Ca2+ and Sr2+. Nobelium is the only f-block element for which the +2 state is the most common and stable one in aqueous solution. This occurs because of the large energy gap between the 5f and 6d orbitals {{at the end of the}} actinide series.|$|E
5000|$|On {{heating the}} salts {{that are not}} of alkali or <b>alkaline</b> <b>earths,</b> difluorophosphates {{decompose}} firstly by giving off POF3 forming a monofluorophosphate (PO3F2−) compound, and then this in turn decomposes to an orthophosphate [...] compound.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to about 75% SiO2 and 8-12% B2O3, these glasses contain up to 5% <b>alkaline</b> <b>earths</b> and alumina (Al2O3). This is a subtype of slightly softer glasses, which have thermal expansions {{in the range}} (4.0-5.0) × 10−6 K−1.|$|R
50|$|Characteristically, these {{glasses are}} free of alkali oxides and contain 15-25% AI2O3, 52-60% SiO2 and about 15% <b>alkaline</b> <b>earths.</b> Very high {{transformation}} temperatures and softening points are typical features. Main fields of application are glass bulbs for halogen lamps, high-temperature thermometers and thermally and electrically highly loadable film resistors.|$|R
5|$|Reactions of {{elemental}} fluorine with metals require varying conditions. Alkali metals cause {{explosions and}} <b>alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> metals display vigorous activity in bulk; to prevent passivation from {{the formation of}} metal fluoride layers, most other metals such as aluminium and iron must be powdered, and noble metals require pure fluorine gas at 300–450°C (575–850°F). Some solid nonmetals (sulfur, phosphorus) react vigorously in liquid air temperature fluorine. Hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide combine readily with fluorine, the latter sometimes explosively; sulfuric acid exhibits much less activity, requiring elevated temperatures.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} {{behavior of}} ytterbium {{is similar to}} that of the rest of the lanthanides. Most ytterbium compounds are found in the +3 oxidation state, and its salts in this oxidation state are nearly colorless. Like europium, samarium, and thulium, the trihalides of ytterbium can be reduced to the dihalides by hydrogen, zinc dust, or by the addition of metallic ytterbium. The +2 oxidation state occurs only in solid compounds and reacts in some ways similarly to the <b>alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> metal compounds; for example, ytterbium(II) oxide (YbO) shows the same structure as calcium oxide (CaO).|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of calcium {{is that of}} a typical heavy <b>alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> metal. For example, calcium spontaneously reacts with water more quickly than magnesium and less quickly than strontium to produce calcium hydroxide and hydrogen gas. It also reacts with the oxygen and nitrogen in the air to form a mixture of calcium oxide and calcium nitride. When finely divided, it spontaneously burns in air to produce the nitride. In bulk, calcium is less reactive: it quickly forms a hydration coating in moist air, but below 30% relative humidity it may be stored indefinitely at room temperature.|$|E
5000|$|The {{chemical}} term earths was historically {{applied to}} certain chemical substances, {{once thought to}} be elements, and this name was borrowed from one of the four classical elements of Plato.

50|$|Beryllium difluoride is {{very soluble}} in water, {{unlike the other}} <b>alkaline</b> <b>earths.</b> (Although they are {{strongly}} ionic, they do not dissolve because of the especially strong lattice energy of the fluorite structure.)

In common with Gay-Lussac and Davy, he held subterraneous thermic disturbances to be probably due to the contact of water with metals of the alkalis and <b>alkaline</b> <b>earths.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of lithium shows several differences {{from that of}} the rest of the group as the small Li+ cation polarises anions and gives its compounds a more covalent character. Lithium and magnesium have a diagonal relationship due to their similar atomic radii, so that they show some similarities. For example, lithium forms a stable nitride, a property common among all the <b>alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> metals (magnesium's group) but unique among the alkali metals. In addition, among their respective groups, only lithium and magnesium form organometallic compounds with significant covalent character (e.g. LiMe and MgMe2).|$|E
5|$|The {{main reason}} for the {{predicted}} differences between unbinilium and the other <b>alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> metals is the spin–orbit (SO) interaction—the mutual interaction between the electrons' motion and spin. The SO interaction is especially strong for the superheavy elements because their electrons move faster—at velocities comparable to the speed of light—than those in lighter atoms. In unbinilium atoms, it lowers the 7p and 8s electron energy levels, stabilizing the corresponding electrons, {{but two of the}} 7p electron energy levels are more stabilized than the other four. The effect is called subshell splitting, as it splits the 7p subshell into more-stabilized and the less-stabilized parts. Computational chemists understand the split as a change of the second (azimuthal) quantum number l from 1 to 1/2 and 3/2 for the more-stabilized and less-stabilized parts of the 7p subshell, respectively. Thus, the outer 8s electrons of unbinilium are stabilized and become harder to remove than expected, while the 7p3/2 electrons are correspondingly destabilized, perhaps allowing them to participate in chemical reactions. This stabilization of the outermost s-orbital (already significant in radium) is the key factor affecting unbinilium's chemistry, and causes all the trends for atomic and molecular properties of <b>alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> metals to reverse direction after barium.|$|E
5|$|Although usually trivalent, {{ytterbium}} readily forms divalent compounds. This {{behavior is}} unusual for lanthanides, which almost exclusively form compounds with an oxidation state of +3. The +2 {{state has a}} valence electron configuration of 4f14 because the fully filled f-shell gives more stability. The yellow-green ytterbium(II) ion {{is a very strong}} reducing agent and decomposes water, releasing hydrogen gas, and thus only the colorless ytterbium(III) ion occurs in aqueous solution. Samarium and thulium also behave this way in the +2 state, but europium(II) is stable in aqueous solution. Ytterbium metal behaves similarly to europium metal and the <b>alkaline</b> <b>earth</b> metals, dissolving in ammonia to form blue electride salts.|$|E
