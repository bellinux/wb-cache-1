50|$|An <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>vaporizer</b> is {{a device}} {{generally}} attached to an anaesthetic machine which delivers a given concentration of a volatile anaesthetic agent. It works by controlling the vaporisation of anaesthetic agents from liquid, and then accurately controlling the concentration {{in which these}} {{are added to the}} fresh gas flow.|$|E
50|$|Pressure {{and demand}} from dental {{surgeons}} {{for a more}} reliable method of administrating ether helped modernise its delivery. In 1877, Clover invented an ether inhaler with a water jacket, and by the late 1899 alternatives to ether came to the fore, mainly due {{to the introduction of}} spinal anaesthesia. Subsequently, this resulted in the decline of ether (1930-1956) use due to the introduction of cyclopropane, trichloroethylene, and halothane. By the 1980s, the <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>vaporizer</b> had evolved considerably; subsequent modifications lead to a raft of additional safety features such as temperature compensation, a bimetallic strip, temperature-adjusted splitting ratio and anti-spill measures....|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} carrier gas {{composition}} on {{the output of}} six <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>vaporizers</b> was studied using oxygen, nitrous oxide, helium and argon as the carrier gases. Vaporizer output was measured with an MGA 200 mass spectrometer and a Riken refractometer and, in addition, the pressure decrease across each vaporizer was determined simultaneously. A change in carrier gas composition produced both a transient and a steady state change in vaporizer output. The possible reasons for the changes in steady state output are discussed {{in relation to the}} construction of each vaporizer. The addition of nitrous oxide to the carrier gas produced changes of clinical significance only when the vaporizers were used at extreme dial settings and flow rates. Although <b>anaesthetic</b> <b>vaporizers</b> are usually calib-rated with air or oxygen as a carrier gas, in clinical practice the carrier gas usually contains at least 50 % v/v nitrous oxide. Air and oxygen have very similar physical properties and exhibit a similar flow profile over a given flow path. Nitrous oxide, on the other hand, differs markedly from the other two gases in both respects. The effect of this difference on vapor-izer performance has received little attention until recently. A study by Paterson, Hulands and Nunn (1969) on the performance of the Fluotec Mk III vaporizer demonstrated small differences when oxygen, and a mixture containing 3 5 % v/v oxygen in nitrous oxide, were compared. A later study by Stocking (1971) showed that nitrous oxide increased the output of the Fluotec Mk II vaporizer at low dial settings. Studies published subsequently have shown that the composition of the carrier gas affects the output o...|$|R
40|$|Background. The aim of {{this study}} was to detail the time-course, defined as the changes in end-tidal drug {{concentration}} with time, and consumption of inhaled anaesthetics when using a multifunctional closed-circuit anaesthesia machine in various drug delivery modes, and to compare it with a classical anaesthesia machine using an out-of-circle vaporizer under high and low fresh gas flow conditions. Methods. Using an artificial test lung, sevoflurane and desflurane time-course and consumption were compared when using the Zeus(R) apparatus (Drager, Lubeck, Germany) with direct injection of inhaled anaesthetics or the Primus(R) apparatus (Drager, Lubeck, Germany) using a classical out-of-circle <b>vaporizer.</b> <b>Anaesthetics</b> were targeted at 1 and 2 MAC end-tidal during 15 min. For both apparatus, out-of-circle high and low fresh gas control (FGC) and for Zeus(R), auto-control (AC) modes (fixed fresh gas flow at 6 and 1 litre min(- 1) and uptake mode) were compared. Time to reach target, initial overshoot and stability at target, and wash-out times were compared. Results. In FGC, an initial overshoot in end-tidal drug concentration is seen when using 6 litre min(- 1) fresh gas flow and a slower time course is observed when using only 1 litre min(- 1) in both apparatus. In auto-control mode, the time course of both sevoflurane and desflurane was very fast and not influenced by the changes in fresh gas flow. No overshoot at target was seen. At all settings, the wash-out times were faster when using Zeus(R) than Primus(R). Inhaled anaesthetic consumption was lowest with the Zeus(R) ventilator in uptake AC mode. Conclusion. A combination of the fastest time course and lowest consumption of sevoflurane and desflurane was found when using the Zeus(R) apparatus in AC uptake mode...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the sevoflurane concentrations produced within the Stephens <b>anaesthetic</b> machine circuit (<b>vaporizer</b> in-circle system) at different fresh gas flow rates (FGFRs), temperatures, vaporizer settings and vaporizer sleeve positions when used to anaesthetize dogs of different body sizes. Study design: Experimental non-blinded studies. Animals: Eighteen mixed breed dogs, weights 4 - 39 kg. Methods: Anaesthetic induction with propofol {{was followed by}} maintenance with sevoflurane in oxygen via the Stephens anaesthetic machine. In study 1, the vaporizer setting, temperature and circuit FGFRs were altered with the vaporizer sleeve down (n = 3), or in separate experiments, up (n = 3). Delivered (Fi′SEVO) and expired sevoflurane concentrations were recorded. Study 2 determined the vaporizer settings (sleeve up) required to achieve predetermined multiples of minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) of Fi′SEVO when sevoflurane was delivered to dogs (n = 12) of different bodyweights and at different FGFRs. Results: Delivered concentrations of sevoflurane were sufficient to maintain anaesthesia in all dogs, regardless of bodyweight, FGFR, vaporizer temperature and sleeve position. Fi′SEVO increased with increasing temperature, when the vaporizer sleeve was down, when vaporizer setting was increased and when FGFR was decreased. As the FGFR increased or the dog 2 ̆ 7 s bodyweight decreased, higher vaporizer settings were required to produce the same Fi′SEVO. The median Stephens vaporizer settings to achieve an Fi′SEVO of 1. 3 MAC ranged from 4. 3 to 5. 0 for a small dog (1 - 10 kg), 2. 5 to 5. 6 for a medium dog (15 - 25 kg) and 2. 5 to 3. 5 for a large dog (30 - 40 kg), depending on the FGFR. Conclusion and clinical relevance: The Stephens anaesthetic machine can deliver to dogs, weighing 4 kg and above, concentrations of sevoflurane sufficient or in excess of that required to maintain anaesthesia, at temperatures from 10 to 35 °C, FGFRs of 1 to 5 times the patient 2 ̆ 7 s estimated metabolic oxygen requirement and at any vaporizer sleeve position...|$|R
