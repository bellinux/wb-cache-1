5|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} on December 4, 2004, Boustany defeated Mount, 55 percent to 45 percent in an election with low voter turnout. Democrats had hoped on a big turnout, as the district is nearly a quarter African American, a reliable Democratic constituency. Analysis of the race suggested that Mount's defeat was helped by the open primary system that had the Democratic candidates work against each other and led to Cravin's conflict with the state Democratic Party which in turn led to suppressed voter turnout. The large number of negative advertisements was also cited as a factor that contributed to low turnout. Another detriment for Mount mentioned was the strong support for George W. Bush {{in the presidential election}} <b>against</b> <b>John</b> Kerry in the district, which he carried by about 60 percent of the vote.|$|E
