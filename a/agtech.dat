5000|$|The {{innovation}} {{began with}} {{the realization of the}} causes behind the poor state of millions of farmers around the developing world. The biggest realization was that this pain - both economic and emotional -must be addressed at an individual farmer level. RML <b>AgTech,</b> a business incubated by Thomson Reuters, was conceptualized as a one-page idea in 2006 to address this need. Following nearly 18 months of market research, prototyping and market trials, RML <b>AgTech</b> was launched in October 1, 2007, in Maharashtra by Sharad Pawar, the union minister of agriculture of India followed by launch in Punjab in 2008 by Mr. Prakash Badal, state’s Chief Minister. [...] Amit Mehra founded RML within Thomson Reuters and then spun it out with support from IvyCap Ventures Advisors Private Limited (IvyCap), a venture capital fund management company to drive commercial growth of RML <b>AgTech</b> (formerly Reuters Market Light). IvyCap, which is backed by the IIT Alumni Network, is the lead investor in RML <b>AgTech</b> with Thomson Reuters remaining as a shareholder and partner in the newly formed RML <b>AgTech</b> Pvt Ltd (formerly RML Information Services Private Limited).|$|E

50|$|Lester Teeple was {{an early}} settler in the Elgin, Illinois, vicinity. He ordered the {{construction}} of the barn to store lumber in 1885. Teeple wanted to construct an octagon barn, a style typical in the area, particularly with Flemish immigrants. However, the lumber he intended to use to build it was not long enough to allow such a construction. W. Wright Abell was tasked with designing the barn, which was given sixteen sides instead of eight; the barn was his last known standing building. Teeple's farm provided dairy products to the Midwest. Hay would be distributed throughout the barn by a fork pulley system that allowed the hay to be dropped anywhere in the barn. Teeple Barn was renowned as the largest barn in the Elgin area, {{and one of the first}} designed with a professional architect. The barn remained in the Teeple family for over a hundred years, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 10, 1979. In 1996, a non-profit group, <b>AgTech,</b> was created to restore the barn, and managed to restore the cupola in 1999. The group raised over $300,000 for repairs to the barn, which was the last sixteen-sided barn remaining in Illinois. On May 25, 2007, Teeple Barn was destroyed in a severe storm, and the remains were demolished a few days later.|$|E

40|$|Direct seeding {{in fields}} with high amounts of residue {{has always been}} a problem for producers. Excess residue causes hair-pining of the straw which results in {{decreased}} penetration of disk openers. Hair-pinning also results in poor seed placement which decreases the crop establishment. In the past, residue managers have commonly been used in the United States to clear residue for precision planters in high value crops. The precision planter residue managers are costly and therefore are not commonly used to seed other types of crops. Manufacturers have recently designed universal cheaper types of residue managers. The new residue managers are designed for cereal, pulse and oilseed type crops to clear the residue away from the path of the opener to allow for good soil penetration, residue clearance and seed placement. The <b>AgTech</b> Centre was approached by the Alberta Reduced Tillage Linkages (ARTL) to test the performance of several different residue managers. The ARTL wanted to increase the exposure of residue managers in Alberta with hopes of more producers direct seeding in heavy residue conditions. The <b>AgTech</b> Centre performed an experiment to test various types of residue managers while seeding with disk openers under different conditions. Measurements were made and analyzed. Residue managers did increase the crop emergence of wheat and canola but results were not significant. Further testing and data is needed to conclude the study...|$|E

40|$|In {{the summer}} of 2016 I worked at The Moore Street Market Farm run by Oko Farms LLC., New York City’s first and largest outdoor urban {{aquaponics}} company. Aquaponics is a method of farming that combines the cultivation of aquatic animals and plants in a mutually beneficial, symbiotic relationship. While the industry is in its infancy, aquaponics is acknowledged to have great potential to change the future of farming for sustainability, as it uses less water than traditional agriculture and can be implemented almost anywhere. This thesis examines current challenges to the industry and the potential future applications of aquaponics in urban environments, through discussion of current developments in aquaponics in Europe; Growing Power’s use of aquaponics for community benefit in the Milwaukee; {{as well as in}} the case-studies of Oko Farms and <b>Agtech</b> aquaponics companies in New York City. While eventually concluding that implementations of aquaponics for profit might not be viable in the long run, this thesis ends with a short discussion on hypothetical successful applications the industry could thrive in...|$|E
40|$|Summary: This {{study was}} {{initiated}} {{in response to}} concerns that vertebrate pest control operations in New Zealand may be having deleterious impacts on invertebrate populations and, secondarily, on insectivorous non-target vertebrate populations. Invertebrates feeding on non-toxic baits of the types used for vertebrate pest control were collected and identified. The bait types were diced carrots and three types of cereal-based baits (No. 7, RS 5, and <b>AgTech).</b> The {{study was conducted in}} two rata/kamahi dominated forests (Bell Hill Scenic Reserve and Kopara Forest, West Coast), in July and September 1996. The most common species found on baits was the ant Huberia brouni (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Other common taxa were Orthoptera (at least eight species of weta including Zealandosandrus aff. gracilis, Gymnoplectron sp., and Pleioplectron sp.), Coleoptera (at least nine species of beetles including Saphobius nitidulus, Nestrius sp., and Phrynixus sp.), Dermaptera (at least one species of the earwig Parisolabis sp.), Opiliones (at least three species of harvestmen), and Acarina (at least three species of mites). The ants and weta were found predominately on cereal-based baits, and the beetles, earwigs, harvestmen, and mites predominantly on carrot baits. More invertebrates were found on carrot and RS 5 cereal-based baits than on the other two bait types, and more on baits at night than during the day. Fewer invertebrates were found on cinnamon-flavoured baits (used for 1080 -poisoning of possums) than on plain baits (used for brodifacoum-poisoning of rodents). The number o...|$|E
40|$|Weed {{management}} {{is becoming more}} complex due {{to the rise of}} herbicide resistant weeds. Integrated weed management strategies are recommended to minimize herbicide resistance. However, weed management can be daunting and uncertain leading to biased, avoidant or suboptimal decisions. Existing weed management tools can be insensitive to user needs and changing contexts over time. This paper discusses a proof of concept cognitive tool for integrated weed management decisions. Our team has taken initial steps into the design of an interactive tool for cotton growers that allows them to explore the impact of individual priorities and strategy preferences (optimistic, pessimistic and risk related) on weed management decisions given uncertainty in temperature and rainfall. Our research tackles the challenge of engaging stakeholders in complex decision making in three ways: 1) recognizing individual cognitive priorities 2) visualising scientific weed management in an appealing mobile interface and 3) representing decision uncertainties and risk weighted against cognitive priorities. Specifically, our tool communicates personalised barnyard grass weeding management strategies for pre-crop and in-crop cotton weeding decisions. We ranked a set of actions including applications of herbicides: glyphosate, paraquat (shielded and unshielded), group A, trifluralin, diuron, pendimethalin, s-metolachlor, fluometuron, glufosinate; and non-chemical methods such as soil disturbance at various times prior to planting, at planting and in crop. Each action was evaluated against personal priorities including: saving time/effort, health/safety, saving money, sustainability and effectiveness. The adoption of decision support in <b>AgTech</b> is improved when users can represent the objective benefits of recommended actions proportionately to their own needs and measures of success. Our interactive decision tool provides individualised decision support and quantifies uncertainty about attributes relevant to decision-makers to optimise integrated weeding management. The framework, however, can be extended to other decision making context where user priorities and decision uncertainties need to be incorporated alongside scientific best-practice...|$|E
