5|$|Manchu shamans {{typically}} wore <b>an</b> <b>apron,</b> a feathered cap denoting {{their ability}} to fly to the spirit world, and a belt with dangling bells, and carried a knife, two wooden sticks with bells affixed to the top, and a drum they used during ceremonies. These attributes could still be observed among shamans from Manchuria and Mongolia {{in the early twentieth}} century.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} trap Williams, Power asked Williams {{to meet him}} at Moorgate Street Station the {{following}} day. Police were lying in wait and arrested both Power and Williams at the Moorgate station. Police covered Williams's head with <b>an</b> <b>apron</b> to prevent him from being photographed and thus possibly influencing witnesses. However, no one had glimpsed the murderer's face, and no one selected Williams from an identity parade. Power was immediately released.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to her limitations {{with the human}} form, MacDonald points out that Potter's mastery in the depiction of rabbits attains full flower in The Flopsy Bunnies. Potter conveys the rabbits' thoughts and emotions with {{the position of the}} tail or the ear. Benjamin, Peter, his mother, and Flopsy all wear clothes, but Flopsy wears only <b>an</b> <b>apron</b> that exposes her tail and is thus incompletely clothed in comparison to her family and by human standards. But this incompleteness in dress permits her tail to be exposed and to precisely convey her apprehension as she approaches the house across the vast expanse of the lawn in search of her babies.|$|E

50|$|Accordingly, {{beginning}} in October 1979, the Tonopah Airport base was reconstructed and expanded for the F-117 mission. The 6,000 ft runway was lengthened to 10,000 ft. Taxiways, <b>a</b> concrete <b>apron,</b> <b>a</b> large maintenance hangar, and a propane storage tank were added.|$|R
5|$|After Mary's death, Paul and Michael {{were sent}} to live with Jim's brother Joe, and his wife Joan, for two months, so as to let their father grieve in private. Jim {{depended}} heavily on his sisters, Jin and Millie, to help around the house. Jim later {{took part in the}} running of the household, as Cynthia Lennon remembered that when she and John Lennon used to visit Forthlin Road, Jim would often answer the door with his sleeves rolled up, a tea towel in his hand and <b>an</b> <b>apron</b> tied around his waist. When Paul later played at The Cavern during lunchtimes, Jim would drop off food there that Paul would later put in the oven at Forthlin Road. Ruth remembered that Jim was funny and musical with her, but also strict when she was young, and was insistent that she learned good table manners and etiquette when speaking to people.|$|E
5|$|The North of England {{is often}} stereotypically {{represented}} through the clothing worn by working-class {{men and women}} in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Working men would wear a heavy jacket and trousers held up by braces, an overcoat, and a hat, typically a flat cap, while women would wear a dress, or a skirt and blouse, with <b>an</b> <b>apron</b> on top as protection from dirt; in colder months they would often wear a shawl or headscarf. If not wearing leather lace-up shoes, some men and women would have worn English clogs, which were hardwearing and had replaceable soles and tips. Factory workers tapping their feet in time with the click of machinery developed a type of folk clog dance referred to as clogging, which was intricately developed in the North.|$|E
5|$|The {{hexagonal}} Great Tower {{was probably}} {{begun in the}} 1430s and 1440s, possibly on the motte of a previous castle. The tower today has lost not only one of its walls but part of its upper structure, and would originally have been three storeys high with probably additional machicolations on top similar to those on the gatehouse. It {{was designed to be}} a self-contained fortification, with its own water and food supplies, and luxurious quarters lit by large windows on the upper floors. Originally the tower was reached by a bascule drawbridge, usually considered to be drawn from contemporary French designs, such as those at Ferté-Milon and Vannes. This drawbridge was designed to have two parts— a wide, heavy bridge that would be raised or lowered when the family was in residence, and a thinner bridge, easier to lift, designed for the use of servants at other times. The Herberts used the bridge as their badge, and it {{can be seen in the}} carved window designs around the castle. The drawbridge was replaced with a grander stone bridge in the 1460s, probably at a cost of around £900 to £1000. <b>An</b> <b>apron</b> wall with six turrets was also added around the tower at around the same time.|$|E
50|$|Pinafores may be worn by {{girls and}} women as a {{decorative}} garment or as <b>a</b> protective <b>apron.</b> <b>A</b> related term is pinafore dress (American English: jumper dress); it is a sleeveless dress intended to be worn over a top or blouse.|$|R
50|$|The airport has {{capacity}} to handle 350 daily operations and 850,000 passengers per year, it comprises a concrete runway, a parallel taxiway, several hangars, <b>a</b> commercial aviation <b>apron,</b> <b>a</b> general aviation <b>apron,</b> <b>a</b> military base, and a state-of-the-art commercial terminal equipped with six glass jetways, {{two of which}} are capable of handling medium-large airliners such as the Boeing 767 and Airbus A330. To improve the airport's capacity, the check-in and boarding gates areas will be expanded in 2017 to accommodate up to 140,000 passengers per month.|$|R

25|$|In operation, the raw {{material}} (of various sizes) is usually delivered to the primary crusher's hopper by dump trucks, excavators or wheeled front-end loaders. A feeder device such as <b>an</b> <b>apron</b> feeder, conveyor or vibrating grid controls {{the rate at which}} this material enters the crusher, and often contains a preliminary screening device which allows smaller material to bypass the crusher itself, thus improving efficiency. Primary crushing reduces the large pieces to a size which can be handled by the downstream machinery.|$|E
25|$|In {{the design}} of a dam the energy of the fast-flowing stream over a {{spillway}} must be partially dissipated to prevent erosion of the streambed downstream of the spillway, which could ultimately lead to failure of the dam. This can be done by arranging for the formation of a hydraulic jump to dissipate energy. To limit damage, this hydraulic jump normally occurs on <b>an</b> <b>apron</b> engineered to withstand hydraulic forces and to prevent local cavitation and other phenomena which accelerate erosion.|$|E
25|$|Carmelite {{tradition}} {{holds that}} the Blessed Virgin Mary appeared to St. Simon Stock at Cambridge, England in 1251 in answer to his appeal for help for his oppressed order and recommended the Brown Scapular to him. Originally, the scapular was a broad band of cloth over the shoulders, serving as <b>an</b> <b>apron,</b> worn still {{as part of the}} religious habit by a number of orders of monks and friars. The Brown Scapular has been a key element of Carmelite history since the late 13th century.|$|E

25|$|In {{the design}} of a {{spillway}} and apron, the engineers select the point at which a hydraulic jump will occur. Obstructions or slope changes are routinely designed into the apron to force a jump at a specific location. Obstructions are unnecessary, as the slope change alone is normally sufficient. To trigger the hydraulic jump without obstacles, <b>an</b> <b>apron</b> is designed such that the flat slope of the apron retards the rapidly flowing water from the spillway. If the apron slope is insufficient to maintain the original high velocity, a jump will occur.|$|E
25|$|On {{the north}} {{wall of the}} north chapel is a white marble plaque set on a black relief {{background}} with curved top, dedicated to John Turnor of Stoke Rochford and Panton House, who died at Leamington Spa in 1845, aged 79 years, and to his sister, Frances Turnor, who died at Cheltenham in 1847, aged 83 years. Both were the children of a further Edmund Turnor (died 1806), and the siblings of Edmund Turnor (1755–1829). The memorial text is set within a recessed panel; a base moulding is supported by square brackets on <b>an</b> <b>apron</b> below, and a moulded cornice with plain pediment sits above.|$|E
25|$|The central island may be {{surrounded}} by <b>an</b> <b>apron</b> that is high enough to discourage drivers from crossing over it, but low enough to allow unusually wide/long vehicles to navigate the intersection (truck apron). The island may provide a visual barrier across the intersection to the drivers entering it. The barrier assists entering drivers into focusing only on the traffic approaching them {{in the path of}} the circle. Otherwise, vehicles anywhere in the circle cause entering drivers to stop outside the roundabout, waiting for the vehicles (even on the opposite side) to pass by them. This interferes with traffic flow, unnecessarily reducing the number of circling cars. The barrier may be a landscaped mound, a raised wall, a tree or tall shrubs. Road signage or flagpoles may be planted at the top of a landscaped mound.|$|E
