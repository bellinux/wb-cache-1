5|$|The series' January 15, 1981 debut, {{which was}} {{announced}} on October 22, 1980, occurred amid the industry's {{recovery from the}} 1980 Actors strike and NBC's recovery from the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott. The show debuted on <b>a</b> <b>night</b> <b>when</b> both competing networks were airing reruns. Unlike other high-profile debuts from the 1980–81 network television season that had two- and three-hour premieres, such as Dynasty and Flamingo Road, this premiere episode debuted by itself as a one-hour offering. That season, even some holdovers, such as B. J. and the Bear and Buck Rogers, had multi-hour season premieres.|$|E

On <b>a</b> <b>night</b> <b>when</b> teammate Jabari Parker went down with a knee injury, Middleton looked spry in limited action, scoring five points in 15 minutes in a 106–88 loss to the Miami Heat. Seven days later, in his fourth game back, Middleton scored a season-high 20 points in a 129–125 win over the Brooklyn Nets. He topped that mark on March 1, scoring 21 points to go with five rebounds and five assists in a 110–98 loss to the Denver Nuggets.

25|$|Schierholtz {{received}} regular {{playing time}} throughout the postseason {{as a defensive}} replacement for starting outfielder Pat Burrell. Burrell {{was one of the}} best hitters on the Giants, but was a poor defender in the outfield. Whenever the Giants held a lead in the sixth inning or later, Bochy would remove Burrell from the game, shift Cody Ross from right field to left field, and place Schierholtz in right field. This strategy was meant to provide the Giants with the best possible defensive outfield and, thus, the best chance of holding the lead and winning the game. Schierholtz ultimately appeared in 11 of San Francisco's 15 playoff games, accumulating 13 plate appearances and recording an RBI in Game 1 of the 2010 World Series against the Texas Rangers. In Game 4, <b>a</b> <b>night</b> <b>when</b> Bochy chose to start several of his backups, he got his first start of the postseason, playing right field in the Giants' 4–0 victory. The Giants won the World Series in five games, their first World Series victory since 1954.|$|E

Since 1993, it has been held at the current Hall of Fame building. The ceremony was first broadcast by The Sports Network in 1994. In 1999 the [...] "Hockey Hall of Fame game" [...] was established, a contest between the Toronto Maple Leafs and a visiting team, with a special ceremony honouring that year's inductees held before the game.

500|$|During {{a preseason}} game, Howard {{attempted}} to punch Al Harrington and Jermaine O'Neal, which {{earned him a}} suspension on October 25, 2002. As a result, Howard missed the ' first two games of the regular season, and this cost him $458,000 in salary. Howard first attempted to hit Harrington late {{in the fourth quarter}} on <b>a</b> <b>night</b> <b>when</b> Howard had missed nine of ten shots. When O'Neal intervened, the two pushed and shoved each other before Howard started punching again. At around the same time, the University of Michigan basketball scandal investigation came to an end with many of the accomplishments of the Fab Five being rescinded through National Collegiate Athletic Association sanctions. Although many of the records of the Fab Five were erased, Howard's and teammate Rose's 1994 All-American recognitions were unaffected by the scandal. During the 2002–03 regular season, he accumulated 18double-doubles, two 30-point performances, and three 15-rebound performances in 77games, while averaging 18.4points and 7.6rebounds. The 2002–03 Nuggets were 17–65 under Bzdelik. The team struggled with the league's lowest payroll and three rookies in the starting lineup. [...] Howard started all 77games in which he played.|$|E

Burke made his first seven shots of the game and scored 20 in the first half on <b>a</b> <b>night</b> <b>when</b> his former Michigan one-on-one training partner Caris LeVert had his first double digit scoring night for the Brooklyn Nets. Burke matched his season high of 27 points on 1013 shooting in the April 12 regular season finale against the Miami Heat as most of the starters rested for the playoffs. However, Burke saw little action after the signing of Brandon Jennings as John Wall's primary backup at the end of February. Following the season Washington did not extend Burke a qualifying offer, making him an unrestricted free agent.|$|E
500|$|By helming the 2012–13 Wolverines, Beilein {{reached his}} sixth {{season with the}} same team for the first time.

The 400th win came on <b>a</b> <b>night</b> <b>when</b> Michigan achieved its 16th straight victory which tied the school record for best start. Michigan went on to record its first 191 start to a season in school history. On January 28, Michigan was ranked number one in the AP Poll with 51 of the 65 first place votes. It marked the first time Michigan ranked atop the AP Poll since the 1992–93 team did so on December 5, 1992. John Beilein was selected as an assistant coach for the 2013 World University Games. [...] In the [...] 2013 NCAA Tournament, fourth-seeded Michigan defeated South Dakota State, 7156. in its South Regional opening game, and in so doing the team matched Beilein's career high with 27 wins. Michigan then surpassed this record, and continued to advance, by defeating fifth-seeded Virginia Commonwealth, 78–53 and top-seeded Kansas, 87–85 before beating third-seeded Florida 79–59 to send Michigan to the Final Four {{for the first time since}} 1993. In the 2013 Final Four, the Wolverines defeated East region champion Syracuse, 61–56, to advance to the national championship game against Louisville, which they lost, 82–76.

500|$|Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson: Cameron said {{he needed}} the cast to {{feel as though they}} were really on the Titanic, to relive its liveliness, and [...] "to take that energy and give it to Jack, [...] an artist who is able to have his heart soar". Jack is portrayed as an itinerant, poor orphan from Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, who has toured {{numerous}} places in the world, including Paris. He wins two tickets onto the RMS Titanic in a poker game and travels as a third-class passenger with his friend Fabrizio. He is attracted to Rose at first sight and meets her when she contemplates throwing herself off the stern of the ship. Her fiance's [...] "reward", an invitation to dine with them the next evening, enables Jack to mix with the first-class passengers for <b>a</b> <b>night.</b> <b>When</b> casting the role, various established actors, including Matthew McConaughey, Chris O'Donnell, Billy Crudup, and Stephen Dorff, were considered, but Cameron felt that a few of the actors were too old for the part of a 20-year-old. Tom Cruise was interested in portraying the character, but his asking price was too much for the studio to consider. Cameron considered Jared Leto for the role, but Leto refused to audition. DiCaprio, 21 years old at the time, was brought to Cameron's attention by casting director Mali Finn. Initially, {{he did not want to}} portray the character and refused to read his first romantic scene on the set (see below). Cameron said, [...] "He read it once, then started goofing around, and I could never get him to focus on it again. But for one split second, a shaft of light came down from the heavens and lit up the forest." [...] Cameron strongly believed in DiCaprio's acting ability and told him, [...] "Look, I'm not going to make this guy brooding and neurotic. I'm not going to give him a tic and a limp and all the things you want." [...] Cameron rather envisioned the character as a James Stewart type. Although Jack Dawson was a fictional character, in Fairview Cemetery in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where 121 victims are buried, there is a grave labeled [...] "J. Dawson". The real J. Dawson was Joseph Dawson, who shoveled coal in the bowels of the ship. [...] "It wasn't until after the movie came out that we found out that there was a J. Dawson gravestone," [...] said the film's producer, Jon Landau, in an interview.|$|E
