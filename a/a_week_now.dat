2500|$|In {{response}} to this, NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol grinned [...] "I assume [...] baseball strategy {{has to be}} a big disappointment." [...] Counting the All-Star Game, both League Championship Series and the World Series, CBS would have televised just 38 games. This comes on the account of both League Championship Series and the World Series going to a full seven games. Ebersol criticized Peter Ueberroth for negotiating the four-year, $1.06 billion deal with CBS. According to Ebersol, Ueberroth was totally focused on business. Ebersol said [...] "Ueberroth wanted his legacy to be the maximum amount of money. Baseball got this enormous overbid with CBS, coupled with expanding the cable package (on ESPN) from zero to four nights <b>a</b> <b>week.</b> <b>Now,</b> when they find themselves in trouble, they've got no place to expand. There just wasn't a lot of foresight. (Baseball was) just looking for the big score." ...|$|E
