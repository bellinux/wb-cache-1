50|$|Emphasis during {{chip design}} was on high-precision {{frequency}} control, and the SID was {{originally designed to}} have 32 independent voices, sharing a common oscillator. However these features could not be finished in time, so instead the mask work for a certain working oscillator was simply replicated three times across the chip's surface, creating three voices {{each with its own}} oscillator. Another feature that was not incorporated in the final design was a frequency look-up table for the most common musical notes, a feature that was dropped because of space limitations. The support for <b>an</b> <b>audio</b> <b>input</b> pin was a feature Yannes added without asking, which in theory would have allowed the chip {{to be used as a}} simple effect processor. The masks were produced in 7-micrometer technology to gain a high yield; the state of the art at the time was 6-micrometer technologies.|$|E
50|$|Audio {{feedback}} (also {{known as}} acoustic feedback, simply as feedback, or the Larsen effect) {{is a special}} kind of positive feedback which occurs when a sound loop exists between <b>an</b> <b>audio</b> <b>input</b> (for example, a microphone or guitar pickup) and an audio output (for example, a loudly-amplified loudspeaker). In this example, a signal received by the microphone is amplified and passed out of the loudspeaker. The sound from the loudspeaker can then be received by the microphone again, amplified further, and then passed out through the loudspeaker again. The frequency of the resulting sound is determined by resonance frequencies in the microphone, amplifier, and loudspeaker, the acoustics of the room, the directional pick-up and emission patterns of the microphone and loudspeaker, and the distance between them. For small PA systems the sound is readily recognized as a loud squeal or screech.|$|E

50|$|The Micromoog was {{designed}} by Robert Moog and Jim Scott as a scaled-down, cheaper alternative to the Minimoog. It {{was designed}} to tap into a market of musicians who wanted an introduction to synthesis, but could not afford the $1,500 Minimoog. It thus is extremely basic in design. It is a monophonic synthesizer, featuring 1 variable waveshape voltage-controlled oscillator. It has a -24 dB per octave low-pass filter with envelope generator, a voltage-controlled amplifier, noise generator, sample and hold circuit, low-frequency oscillator, and modulation routing. It has a 32-note keyboard {{and was one of}} the first synthesizers to include a built-in ribbon controller, in this instance for pitch bending. The Micromoog has <b>an</b> <b>audio</b> <b>input</b> allowing external audio to be run through the filter and VCA. It also features the Moog Open System control inputs, a pre-MIDI control system which enabled the unit to be controlled by other Moog synthesizers.|$|E

40|$|Audio {{feedback}} {{is defined as}} a positive feedback of acoustic signals where <b>an</b> <b>audio</b> <b>input</b> and output form a loop, and may be utilized artistically. This article presents new context-based controls over audio feedback, leading to the generation of desired sonic behaviors by enriching the influence of existing acoustic information such as room response and ambient noise. This ecological approach to audio feedback emphasizes mutual sonic interaction between signal processing and the acoustic environment. Mappings from analyses of the received signal to signal-processing parameters are designed to emphasize this specificity as an aesthetic goal. Our feedback system presents four types of mappings: approximate analyses of room reverberation to tempo-scale characteristics, ambient noise to amplitude and two different approximations of resonances to timbre. These mappings are validated computationally and evaluated experimentally in different acoustic conditions...|$|E
40|$|SoundSpotter is an {{open source}} {{software}} system for real-time matching of <b>an</b> <b>audio</b> <b>input</b> stream to a database of continuous audio or video. Among its novel features are real-time control over audio segmentation, feature selection and match radius. The system uses audio input to control selection of output from a database using similarity-based matching. The low latency methods employed create a feedback loop between the performer and the database, thus it {{is a type of}} electronic musical instrument. We employ exact nearest neighbor searching on variable-length sequences of audio features for matching. The feature space is controlled by range selection over the vector dimensions determining which are left out of similarity calculations. The current implementation is capable of real-time matching in tens of hours of audio or video on current laptop hardware.

40|$|Speaker Diarization is {{the process}} of {{partitioning}} <b>an</b> <b>audio</b> <b>input</b> into homogeneous segments according to speaker identity where the number of speakers in a given audio input is not known a priori. This master thesis presents a novel initialization method for Speaker Diarization that requires less manual parameter tuning than most current GMM/HMM based agglomerative clustering techniques and is more accurate at the same time. The thesis reports on empirical research to estimate the importance of each of the parameters of an agglomerative-hierarchical-clustering-based Speaker Diarization system and evaluates methods to estimate these parameters completely unsupervised. The parameter estimation combined with a novel non-uniform initialization method result in a system that performs better than the current ICSI baseline engine on datasets of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Rich Transcription evaluations of the years 2006 and 2007 (17 % overall relative improvement). i Acknowledgments This Master thesis was done {{in the context of an}} internship at the Internationa...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} the Chimera Architecture as the basis for a generative rhythmic improvisation system that is intended for use in ensemble contexts. This interactive soft- ware system learns in real time based on <b>an</b> <b>audio</b> <b>input</b> from live performers. The paper {{describes the}} components of the Chimera Architecture including a novel analysis engine that uses prediction to robustly assess the rhythmic salience of the input stream. Analytical results are stored in a hierarchical structure that includes multiple scenarios which allow ab- stracted and alternate interpretations of the current metrical context. The system draws upon this Chimera Architecture when generating a musical response. The generated rhythms are intended to have a particular ambiguity in relation to the music performance by other members of the ensemble. Ambi- guity is controlled through alternate interpretations of the Chimera.
