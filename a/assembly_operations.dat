5|$|Yet another {{structure}} {{available is}} λ/2 open-circuit stubs {{across the line}} coupled with λ/4 impedance transformers. This topology has both low-pass and band-pass characteristics. Because it will pass DC, {{it is possible to}} transmit biasing voltages to active components without the need for blocking capacitors. Also, since short-circuit links are not required, no <b>assembly</b> <b>operations</b> other than the board printing are required when implemented as stripline. The disadvantages are (i) the filter will take up more board real estate than the corresponding λ/4 stub filter, since the stubs are all twice as long; (ii) the first spurious passband is at 2ω0, as opposed to 3ω0 for the λ/4 stub filter.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a Colored Petri Net {{modeling}} method for early stage design of virtual <b>assembly</b> <b>operation</b> is presented. The characteristics of virtual assembly system, Petri Net and Colored Petri Net are analyzed. Some previous work in Petri Net application in assembly and virtual assembly system is discussed. The theoretical aspects of Colored Petri Net are introduced mathematically. Based on the mathematical presentation {{and the process}} of fasteners <b>assembly</b> <b>operation,</b> a Colored Petri Net model is constructed for the simulation of <b>assembly</b> <b>operation</b> in virtual environment. With CPN Tools software package, the simulation for evaluating the feasibility of modeling is implemented. It is demonstrated that the modeling approach can support the early stage design of virtual assembly system...|$|R

The <b>operation</b> of overlap <b>assembly</b> {{was defined}} by Csuhaj-Varju, Petre, and Vaszil as a formal model of the linear {{self-assembly}} of DNA strands: The overlap assembly of two strings, xy and yz, which share an “overlap ” y, results in the string xyz. This paper continues {{the exploration of the}} properties of the overlap <b>assembly</b> <b>operation</b> by investigating closure of various language classes under iterated overlap assembly, and the decidability of the completeness of a language.

40|$|Most {{proposed}} {{approaches for}} modelling and simulation of an assembly production line {{have focused on}} conventional assembly lines where one (or more) stationary worker stays at a given station to complete a repetitive <b>assembly</b> <b>operation</b> and when this operation is accomplished, the assembled part is transferred to another worker at the next station for the next <b>assembly</b> <b>operation.</b> This paper presents an investigation of a linear walking worker assembly line where one worker walks along the line to complete the assembly of a product from start to finish.
