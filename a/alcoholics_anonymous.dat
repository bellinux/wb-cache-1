5|$|Prevention of {{alcoholism}} may be attempted by regulating and limiting {{the sale of}} alcohol, taxing alcohol to increase its cost, and providing inexpensive treatment. Treatment may take several steps. Because of the medical problems that can occur during withdrawal, alcohol detoxification should be carefully controlled. One common method {{involves the use of}} benzodiazepine medications, such as diazepam. This can be either given while admitted to a health care institution or occasionally while a person remains in the community with close supervision. Other addictions or mental illness may complicate treatment. After detoxification support such as group therapy or support groups are used to help keep a person from returning to drinking. One commonly used form of support is the group <b>Alcoholics</b> <b>Anonymous.</b> The medications acamprosate, disulfiram, or naltrexone may also be used to help prevent further drinking.|$|E
5|$|Smashed was {{conceived}} by James Ponsoldt and Susan Burke {{after they had}} a conversation about things they had done while drunk.

Burke felt that her experiences with alcoholism had not been represented on film before, and so she decided to write about a young woman deciding to become sober. Burke and Ponsoldt discussed the story, characters and tone in detail before they began to write the script.

50|$|Another {{important}} Social Problem Film {{dealing with}} institutions is the alcoholism themed Days of Wine and Roses.

A sociological study done by Elizabeth Hirschman revealed that the film's portrayal was indeed relatable to addicts and alcoholics who after watching the film viewed AA as a viable option to address their problem. This effect on the real population indicates the interaction that Social Problem Films hope to have on their audience in comparison to films meant to purely entertain while skimming the surface of certain issues.|$|R

The many types of creativity that have these three features include: scientific constructivism – the core idea of the Enlightenment – narrative constructivism that uses subjective understanding of metaphorical concepts and is appropriate virtually to all disciplines including science, artistic creativity – such as poetry, music, painting, literature, dance – psychological transformations – such as stages of individuation from childhood to adulthood and transcending stress – and spiritual/religious conversions as exemplified by recovering addicts in <b>alcoholic</b> <b>anonymous</b> (AA) and Evangelical, born-again Christians.

Resultswe noticed that the vectoelectronystagmography was normal for most of the individuals in the experimental group, indicating that the labyrinth and the oculomotor-vestibular pathways were normal and that the balance disorder they presented would stem from the dysfunction {{in other areas of the}} central or peripheral nervous system. In the dynamic posturography we noticed that alcoholics who were not drinking presented significant alterations in their postural balance when compared to non-alcoholic individuals.

Recent studies deomonstrate that the highest rate of intimate partner violence (IPV) occur in substance abusing women. Those in addiction recovery programs reported the highes rate of IPV with more than 36 % reporting IPV in the previous year, and a lifetime prevalence of 73 %. There is conflicting data regarding the relationship of age, education and income to rates of violence. This study looks at significance of these 3 factors as being independent predictors of IPV. This study was conducted with 99 women in Livingston and Washtenaw Counties in Michigan who attend <b>Alcoholic's</b> <b>Anonymous</b> meetings and completed written surveys about 12 months and lifetime prevalence of IPV. Demographic data including age, income and years of formal education were collected, and the relationships of these factors as determinates of IPV were studied. Lifetime and 12 month rates of violence were consistent with national rates. The only statistically significant indicator of IPV was years of education (p =. 035). Nurse practitioners should implement screeing of women for IPV, with special attention paid to those who are alcoholic and with less years of formal education. Further research should examine the relationship of participation in a substance abuse recovery program and decreasing rate of IPV among alcoholic women...|$|R
5000|$|The Laurel Sanitarium for Nervous and Mental Diseases was a {{prominent}} sanitarium, and later a women's nursing home, and landmark building along U.S. Route 1 in Laurel, Maryland.

One of the original buildings was the Gambrills Home (later the Brewster Park Hotel), moved to its Route 1 site from 5th Street, south of Montgomery Street in Laurel. The sanitarium opened in 1905 on 163 acres and housed 90 women patients, two full-time physicians and 42 employees in four main buildings and five cottages.

40|$|A {{relationship}} between shame and alcohol dependence {{has been reported}} in the literature, however the precise nature of this relationship is largely unexplored. A review of the literature suggested that experiencing shame {{is considered to be a}} risk factor of relapse. The drinking of alcohol temporarily relieves the negative feelings of shame therefore reinforcing further drinking and maintaining addictive behaviour. As a consequence, learning how to cope with shame without drinking, may improve recovery. On the other hand, some evidence suggests that experiencing shame may be helpful for developing reasons for stopping drinking and also a necessary protective factor that helps to prevent relapse. This study sought to explore how shame is experienced and understood by those ‘in recovery’ from alcohol dependence, by looking at the different ways that shame is spoken about in personal narratives. Eight participants were recruited from <b>Alcoholic</b> <b>Anonymous</b> (AA) groups and invited to tell their story of recovery. Transcripts were analysed using a narrative approach, focusing on how participants narrated their stories and made sense of their experiences, by identifying specific narrative techniques used to talk about shame. An analysis across all transcripts then identified narrative themes in relation to shame and from this a tentative model of shame in alcohol dependence was proposed. A discussion of the findings evaluated evidence for the model, taking into account the results from this study and those from existing theory and research, whilst identifying areas of further research that are needed. Clinical implications in relation to addressing shame in recovery are also discussed...|$|R
