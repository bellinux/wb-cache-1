5|$|A release {{mechanism}} was provided on the gas-bag, such that, in an emergency, a {{pull on the}} attached rope would release hydrogen from the gas-bag.

5|$|At {{the second}} board, expert {{witnesses}} suggested {{that what was}} observed was the venting, through the engine-room ventilators, of a violent—but not instantaneous—explosion or deflagration in the 4-inch magazines. The same deflagration would have collapsed the bulkhead separating the 4-inch and 15-inch magazines, resulting very quickly in <b>a</b> <b>catastrophic</b> explosion similar to those previously witnessed at Jutland. This theory was ultimately adopted by the board.|$|E
5|$|In 1923 J Harlen Bretz {{published}} a paper {{arguing that the}} channeled scablands in Eastern Washington were caused by massive flooding in the distant past. This view, which was seen as arguing for <b>a</b> <b>Catastrophic</b> explanation for the geologic development, which ran counter the then prevailing view of uniformitarianism, and Bretz's views were initially decried. Bretz defended his theories, setting off a forty-year debate over the Missoula Floods before Bretz’s view of <b>a</b> <b>catastrophic</b> flood finally prevailed. Waitt extended Bretz's argument, arguing for a sequence of multiple Missoula Floods — 40 or more. Waitt's proposal was based mainly on analysis from glacial lake bottom deposits in Ninemile Creek and the Touchet Formation deposits in Burlingame Canyon. This represented a move away from a single catastrophic flood toward a series of catastrophic floods, but with the flood source still ascribed to Glacial Lake Missoula.|$|E
50|$|<b>As</b> <b>catastrophic</b> {{casualties}} {{continued into}} the early 20th century, the ASME developed its boiler code in 1915. While the code provided a solid reference of construction standards, it lacked an important component: the authority to regulate. This was complicated by existence of local and state jurisdictions having their own codes and standards. The result was a patchwork of confusion having no basis in consistency.|$|R

Relationship stress and excessive dependence in relationships increases risk of depression for the person with SCI; supportive relationships are protective.|$|E

It also has semiconducting properties with distinct advantages over traditional silicon or graphene in electronics applications. MoS2 is also used as a catalyst in hydrocracking of petroleum fractions containing nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen.|$|E

5|$|Radiolaria {{have left}} a {{geological}} record {{since at least the}} Ordovician times, and their mineral fossil skeletons can be tracked across the K–Pg boundary. There is no evidence of mass extinction of these organisms, and there is support for high productivity of these species in southern high latitudes as a result of cooling temperatures in the early Paleocene. Approximately 46% of diatom species survived the transition from the Cretaceous to the Upper Paleocene. This suggests a significant turnover in species, but not <b>a</b> <b>catastrophic</b> extinction of diatoms, across the K–Pg boundary.|$|E
