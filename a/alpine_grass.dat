40|$|Terrestrial {{latent heat}} flux (LE) in the Three-River Headwaters region (TRHR) of China plays an {{essential}} role in quantifying the amount of water evaporation and carbon sink over the high altitude Tibetan Plateau (TP). Global warming is expected to accelerate terrestrial hydrological cycle and to increase evaporation. However, direct field observations are lacking in this region and the long-term variability in LE remains uncertain. In this study, we have revised a semi-empirical Penman LE algorithm based on ground eddy covariance (EC) observations from an <b>alpine</b> <b>grass</b> site and provided new satellite-based evidence to assess LE change in the TRHR during 1982 - 2010. Our results show that the average annual terrestrial LE in the TRHR is about 38. 8 W/m (2) and there is no statistically significant change in annual LE from 1982 to 2010. We also found that during the same time period, terrestrial LE over the east region of the TRHR significantly decreased, on average, by 0. 7 W/m (2) per decade, which was driven primarily by the surface incident solar radiation (R (s)) limitation, offsetting the increased LE over the west region of the TRHR caused by the increased precipitation (P) and soil moisture (SM) ...|$|E
40|$|Plants of {{the genus}} Kobresia are <b>alpine</b> <b>grass</b> species of high {{ecological}} and economic importance. Vegetative growth is the dominant means of reproduction for the Kobresia. Studies suggest that substantial vegetative growth can reduce genetic diversity and renders populations less able to buffer changing and extreme conditions. Kobresia are dominant species in the Qinghai-Tibet plateau in China where they face harsh conditions and frequent disturbance. The genetic diversity of five Kobresia species (K. humilis, K. royleana, K. kansuensis, K. tibetica and K. setchwanensis) from the Qinghai-Tibet plateau was assessed. The results reveal high genetic diversity at the population level {{for all of the}} species and there {{does not appear to be}} a relationship between altitude and genetic diversity. AMOVA analysis shows that most genetic variability resides among individuals within populations, whereas only a minor portion is found among populations. Of the five species, K. royleana and K. kansuensis have the highest levels of gene flow and the lowest genetic differentiation. While K. setchwanensis has the lowest gene flow and the greatest genetic differentiation. The level of gene flow between populations and the mating system play a critical role in the genetic structure of these Kobresia populations. Despite the predominance of vegetative growth enough sexual reproduction occurs to maintain the relatively high genetic diversity in Kobresia populations...|$|E

The decadal MODIS fPAR trend analysis showed that, average growing season fPAR increased by 1. 2  ×  10 − 4 per year and in total increased 0. 86 % from 2002 to 2011 in alpine grassland, {{when most of the}} fPAR increments occurred in southeast and center of the Northern Tibetan Plateau, the alpine grassland tended to recover from degradation slightly. However, climatic factors have influenced the various alpine grassland vegetation fPAR over a period of 10 years; precipitation significantly affected the alpine meadow fPAR in the eastern region, whereas temperature considerably influenced the alpine desert steppe fPAR in the west region. These findings suggest that the regional heterogeneity in alpine grassland fPAR results from various environmental factors, except for vegetation characteristics, such as canopy structure and leaf area...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Phytothermotherapy (PTT) is a {{singular}} {{treatment consisting in}} immersing oneself in pools of fermenting <b>alpine</b> <b>grass,</b> to exploit its heat and rich aromatic components. The efficacy of PTT in rheumatic diseases (RD) is bolstered by ancient tradition. However, there is a marked lack of clinical validation of its efficacy and tolerability in current literature. The objective of this review was to summarize the actually available knowledges on possible effects of PTT in RD. Methodology: We conducted {{a search of the}} literature in May 2012. Medline was searched using the term "phytothermotherapy" and "hay baths" in combination with "rheumatic diseases", "fibromyalgia syndrome", "osteoarthritis". Results: We identified one article reporting the clinical effects of PTT in 56 patients with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and 3 trials describing the results of PTT in osteoarthritis (OA). The available data demonstrate that PTT is efficacy in decreasing pain and disability and improving function in patients with FMS and OA. Furthermore, the tolerability of PTT is excellent. The actual mechanism of action of PTT is yet not completely known, although it's probably due to different combined mechanical, physical and chemical effects. Discussion: PTT could represent a useful aid in the treatment of FMS and OA. However, further studies on a larger number of patients are needed to provide more precise therapeutic guidelines on the modalities of use of PTT. Additionally, {{there is a need for}} further botanical investigations and researches on the mechanisms of actions of PTT. © 2013 Elsevier GmbH...|$|E
40|$|An {{understanding}} of hereditary endophytic fungi, {{and the effects}} on grass persistence strategies (i. e. relative investment in sexual reproduction and vegetative growth) under natural conditions may help to predict how some alpine ecosystems will respond to environmental change. Grass persistence and endophyte maintenance in host populations are closely related, but could become independent due to endophyte loss mechanisms. We used native grass and endophyte populations {{to test the hypothesis}} that fungal endophytes manipulate grass persistence strategies to secure endophyte maintenance in plant populations. Two conditions were required to verify this hypothesis: 1) the fungus caused alterations in host plant strategies; and 2) plant phenotypic changes induced by the fungal endophyte increased endophyte transmission. We compared symbiotic (S) and non-symbiotic (NS) persistence strategies of Festuca eskia (Poaceae), an <b>alpine</b> <b>grass</b> infected by the asexual form of the fungal endophyte Epichloë festucae. We characterised endophyte transmission efficiency, and described vegetative growth and sexual reproduction in a field population that naturally supports approximately 50 % S plants. We built a demographic model to estimate plant vegetative growth rates. A correlation between plant persistence strategy, and fungal maintenance was evaluated by increasing soil resource levels. Under natural conditions, S and NS plants exploited different persistence strategies in the same population; S plants exhibited greater vegetative growth than their NS counterparts, while maintaining the same reproductive output. In response to higher soil resource levels, S plants shifted in persistence strategies and phenology, whereas NS plants maintained the same strategies. Therefore, results suggested the fungal endophyte fine-tuned host persistence strategies according to soil resource level. Finally, we found no direct relationship between the changes induced by fungal endophyte and endophyte transmission. Consequently, fungal endophytes affected host persistence strategies, but did not directly increase endophyte transmission. 10 page(s...|$|E
