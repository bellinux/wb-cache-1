25|$|In 2007, Stoltenberg {{went into}} more detail {{about how she}} {{started out as a}} drug addict, to TV {{journalist}} Tonje Steinsland–the second time her life as an addict {{was the subject of a}} television special. It started in 1991, when she was 27. She witnessed two drug addicts in a fight in a cafe in Oslo when something fell out of the pocket of one of them. She picked it up <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> heroin. Together with her boyfriend she went home and decided to snort the drug. For the next three years she was an intravenous drug user. By the end of the 1990s, she was close to dying. In the interview, Stoltenberg also tells of a boyfriend who subjected her to punishments, psychological terror and much fear, however, the heroin turned all of that into a feeling of freedom and made her perceive their relationship as simply wonderful, for a while.|$|E
25|$|One such {{story is}} that of Rabbi Joshua ben Levi. The rabbi, a friend of Elijah’s, was asked what favor he might wish. The rabbi {{answered}} only that {{he be able to}} join Elijah in his wanderings. Elijah granted his wish only if he refrained from asking any questions about any of the prophet’s actions. He agreed and they began their journey. The first place they came to was the house of an elderly couple who were so poor they had only one old cow. The old couple gave of their hospitality as best they could. The next morning, as the travelers left, Elijah prayed that the old cow would die and it did. The second place they came to was the home of a wealthy man. He had no patience for his visitors and chased them away with the admonition that they should get jobs and not beg from honest people. As they were leaving, they passed the man’s wall <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> crumbling. Elijah prayed that the wall be repaired and it was so. Next, they came to a wealthy synagogue. They were allowed to spend the night with only the smallest of provisions. When they left, Elijah prayed that every member of the synagogue might become a leader.|$|E
2500|$|Edgartown Police Chief James Arena {{arrived at}} the scene about 10 or 15 minutes later. After {{attempting}} unsuccessfully to examine {{the interior of the}} submerged vehicle, Arena summoned a commercial diver along with equipment capable of towing or winching the vehicle out of the water. Diver John Farrar arrived at 8:45 equipped with scuba gear and discovered Kopechne's body; he extricated it from the vehicle within 10 minutes. Police checked the car's license plate <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> registered to Kennedy. Kennedy was still at the pay phone by the ferry crossing and heard that his car and Kopechne's body had been discovered; he crossed back to Edgartown and went to the police station. Gargan simultaneously went to the hotel where the [...] "boiler room girls" [...] were staying to inform them about the incident.|$|E
60|$|Ralph {{glanced at}} the tall clock which stood {{at the end of}} the hall, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> lacked but ten minutes of nine. Percy might be in in a few minutes.|$|R
60|$|The {{rain had}} formed a long pool between the {{slanting}} rocks. He threw a chip into this pool <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> drifted slowly off between two scrub bushes growing partly under a shelving rock.|$|R
60|$|To the captain, however, came a new {{and terrible}} anxiety. He had looked into the water-keg, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> held but a few quarts. It had not lasted {{as long as he}} had expected, for this was a thirsty climate.|$|R
2500|$|Even when pastoring {{his church}} in Dallas, Bosworth would hold {{meetings}} in other areas, and his ministry {{always had an}} element of praying for the sick and divine healing. [...] When his wife died in 1919, he arranged for someone to look after his children, then went started larger scale evangelistic meetings. [...] It appears the turning point for Bosworth's healing ministry were meetings in Lima, Ohio in August 1920. [...] The pastor there asked Bosworth to preach on Divine healing. [...] While Bosworth had previously believed in Divine Healing, and had prayed for the sick, he had not previously preached Divine Healing. [...] Bosworth writes {{that he went to}} the Lord and asked [...] "'suppose I preach on Healing and the people come and don't get healed?' [...] The Lord said 'If people didn't get saved, you wouldn't stop preaching the gospel.'" [...] Bosworth studied the question, prayed about it <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> God's will to heal as well as save people. [...] In the Lima meetings Bosorth stepped out on the Word, preached Divine Healing, and stated that healing of the body was {{as much a part of}} the gospel as salvation of the soul. [...] He invited the sick to come and hear the word of healing for their bodies. [...] The people responded, they were healed, and it led to more who came for salvation.|$|E
2500|$|An early {{internet}} leak of Civil War was {{a source}} of some controversy. Aaron Hale-Williams, a writer for the online publication Racket Magazine, was given a password-encoded streaming media version of the album by Fat Wreck Chords so that he could publish a review prior to its release. Hale posted the password and a link to the album stream on the music news website Punknews.org, and the album soon spread onto peer-to-peer networks after the streaming audio was converted into MP3 format. Racket Magazine Editor Jonathan Yost learned of the leak from Hale and contacted Fat Wreck Chords: [...] "He called me to tell me how good it was, and mentioned that he gave it to 'two or three' people. I scoped it on PunkNews <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> all over the place, so [...] dropped Fat a line to change the password before it got too far out of control." [...] Meanwhile, Hale had been submitting samples of his writing to Scott Heisel, Music Editor for Alternative Press and former editor for Punknews.org. Heisel had been covering news of Civil Wars recording and development for Alternative Press and learned of the album leak, which he called [...] "illegal...immoral and immature." [...] He contacted Fat Wreck Chords to inform them of the situation {{at about the same time}} as Yost, and learned that the Hale was the suspected source of the leak: ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Just so,' said Lady Merrifield. 'Well, {{when she}} was a little older, poor Mr. White, who was one of the most honourable and scrupulous of men, took alarm, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would never do to have the young {{officers}} running after her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Conrad looked confusedly around, and {{the same}} voice said again, [...] "Mr. Dryfoos!" [...] <b>and</b> he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a lady {{speaking}} to him from a coupe beside the curbing, <b>and</b> then he <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was Miss Vance.|$|R
60|$|To {{one side}} of the camp lay a fantastically carved stick, evidently cut by {{somebody}} during his leisure. Dave picked this up <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> contained a heart, an anchor, a cross, several links of a chain, and some stars. At the big end of the stick was an American flag.|$|R
60|$|I {{picked the}} thing up, and {{smoothed}} it out, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{an end of}} a man's cravat.|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't be frightened, I guess I shan't have it badly. I {{looked in}} Mother's book, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> begins with headache, sore throat, and queer {{feelings}} like mine, so I did take some belladonna, and I feel better," [...] said Beth, laying her cold {{hands on her}} hot forehead and trying to look well.|$|R
5000|$|We could {{actually}} open our envelope before deciding on switching or not and the above formula would still {{give us the}} correct expected return.

60|$|During {{the attack}} on the last house, a shot struck Captain Bullen in the chest, and he {{instantly}} fell. When they saw this, the Pioneers dashed forward with a howl of rage, carried the fort, and bayoneted its defenders. The doctor of the party at once examined the wound, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would probably be fatal.|$|R
60|$|He {{glanced at}} the chair on which Tom had placed his clothes <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> empty. The door to the {{corridor}} was ajar.|$|E
60|$|The {{merchant}} {{followed her}} to the door <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> closed tightly behind her. Then he strode across the room and faced John Stumpy.|$|E

40|$|We make how {{a person}} acts intelligible by {{revealing}} it as rational {{in the light of}} what she perceives, thinks, wants and so on. For example, we might explain that she reached out and picked up a glass because she was thirsty <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> contained water. In doing this, we are giving a causal explanation of her behaviour in terms of her antecedent beliefs, desire...|$|R
60|$|Each of {{the boys}} brought around his rifle, which had been picked up on leaving the desperadoes' rendezvous, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> ready for use.|$|E
6000|$|... "You--you {{are holding}} my hands," [...] faltered Betty, in a doubtful, troubled voice. She {{looked up into}} his face <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> pale with {{suppressed}} emotion.|$|E
60|$|She {{took his}} hand mechanically, and then he left her. When she came down to dinner she looked furtively round to his place <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> vacant.|$|E

60|$|It {{was quite}} big--bigger even than mamma's {{traveling}} trunk--and was studded {{all over with}} tarnished brassheaded nails. It was heavy, too, for when Martha tried to lift one end of it she found she could not stir it a bit. But {{there was a place}} {{in the side of the}} cover for a key. She stooped to examine the lock, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would take a rather big key to open it.|$|R
60|$|In a dream he fell asleep. In a dream he rose <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> morning. In a waking dream he {{went through}} the quiet morning towards the college.|$|E

60|$|As she uttered {{these last}} words {{she began to}} weep bitterly. Between amazement and {{compassion}} the young Goth was speechless. He looked down upon the small, soft hand that she had placed on his arm while she spoke, <b>and</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> trembled; he pressed <b>it,</b> and felt <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was cold; {{and in the first}} impulse of pity produced by the action, he found the readiness of speech which he had hitherto striven for in vain.|$|R
