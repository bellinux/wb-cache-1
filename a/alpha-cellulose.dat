50|$|Mercerisation is a {{treatment}} for cotton fabric and thread that gives fabric a lustrous appearance. The process is applied to materials like cotton or hemp. The process was devised in 1844 by John Mercer of Great Harwood, Lancashire, who treated cotton fibres with sodium hydroxide. The treatment caused the fibres to swell, which in Mercer's version of the process shrunk the overall fabric size and made it stronger and easier to dye. In 1890 H. A. Lowe held the yarn under tension during treatment. This prevented shrinking and gave the yarn or resulting fabric a lustrous appearance.Mercerisation alters the chemical structure of the fibre,inter-convertings from <b>alpha-cellulose</b> to a thermodynamically more favorable beta-cellulose polymorph thus swelling of the cell wall. This increases the surface area and reflectance, and gives the fibre a softer feel.|$|E

40|$|International audienceWood is a {{heterogeneous}} material mainly constituted of cellulose, hemicelluloses, lignin, and extractives which all have different isotopic signatures. For applications where delta C- 13 measurement of <b>alpha-cellulose</b> is required, {{it is important}} that residues of the other constituents remain below an acceptable level. The laboratory method most widely used for the extraction of <b>alpha-cellulose</b> consists of several successive treatments: organic solvents and boiled water, acidified sodium chlorite (NaClO 2) application, and finally a NaOH treatment. Different variants of this method were tested systematically to optimize the extraction of <b>alpha-cellulose</b> from wood samples of four tree species: oak, beech, poplar, and pine. Mid-infrared spectroscopy in Attenuated Total Reflection mode (IR-ATR) combined with a curve resolution method (Bayesian Positive Sources Separation statistical analysis) was used to monitor the residues of other wood constituents in extracted <b>alpha-cellulose.</b> IR-ATR spectroscopy was shown to be sensitive enough to detect residual compounds in <b>alpha-cellulose</b> extracts below a concentration which does not present a measurable bias for delta C- 13 measurements. For all tree species, a residual concentration of lignin below the bias threshold for delta C- 13 measurements was reached with fewer additions of acidic NaClO 2 than usually reported. Further the NaOH treatment step was not necessary to remove the hemicelluloses from oak and beech. Infrared spectroscopy combined with a curve resolution method is appropriate to improve <b>alpha-cellulose</b> extraction species-specifically for reliable stable carbon isotope delta C- 13 measurements. It allows to check the extracted <b>alpha-cellulose</b> and to reduce the consumption of chemicals, the extraction time and the loss of <b>alpha-cellulose...</b>|$|E

In this study the feasibility has been examined of characterizing (<b>alpha-cellulose</b> through analysis by mass spectrometry (MS) of the degradation products from hydrolysis.

This species is known to be sensitive to seasonal variation in rainfall. In this region, the wet season occurs during the austral summer from mid November to early April followed by a dry winter season from around June through October. Overall, the total annual rainfall exhibits a high degree of spatial and temporal variation with a mean of less than 600 mm per year. I applied the Modified Brendel technique to isolate 2 ̆ 6 <b>alpha-cellulose</b> from raw wood samples extracted from two P. angolensis trees and measured the α-cellulose δ 18 O values using continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometry. I developed a 30 -year (1955 - 1984) 2 ̆ 6 <b>alpha-cellulose</b> δ 18 O chronology and correlated it with tree-ring width, meteoric water δ 18 O values, monthly and seasonal precipitation totals, and mean seasonal temperature. The δ 18 O values of meteoric water for this region were obtained from the Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP) and correlated with the δ 18 O values of tree ring 2 ̆ 6 <b>alpha-cellulose.</b> The strongest correlations were observed between 2 ̆ 6 <b>alpha-cellulose</b> δ 18 O values and February total precipitation (r = - 0. 49, p = 0. 006) and to a lesser degree total wet season (NDJFMA) precipitation, In particular, unusually rainy wet seasons were significantly correlated (r = - 0. 79, P = 0. 007) with 2 ̆ 6 <b>alpha-cellulose</b> δ 18 O. This relationship is consistent with 18 O-depleted values measured in summer precipitation during periods of high rainfall, which is most likely the result of the isotopic amount effect reported in tropical regions. I also identified a positive correlation (r = 0. 49, p = 0. 03) between 2 ̆ 6 <b>alpha-cellulose</b> δ 18 O and the δ 18 O values of meteoric water, and investigated the possibility of an isotopic temperature effect for δ 18 O in meteoric water, which also may be reflected in the δ 18 O values in tree ring 2 ̆ 6 <b>alpha-cellulose.</b> The strongest correlation with mean temperature was observed during the wet summer season (r = 0. 56, p = 0. 01).

In this new contribution, we surveyed 80 Poaceae (Gramineae) species grown in tropical Hainan Island (China) to test the hypothesis that the presence of oxygen-containing chemical linkage in Poaceae species is widespread. Our innovative natural abundance oxygen isotopic analysis allowed us to infer that more than 1 / 3 of the species investigated has chemical (ether) linkages between <b>alpha-cellulose</b> and lignin in their leaf cell walls, with a species-specific 2 - 89 oxygen-containing bonds for every 1000 glucose units. However, the presence of such linkage appears to be phylogeny-dependent. On average, species of C- 3 photosynthetic mode are found to have more extensive oxygen-containing linkages than those of C- 4 photosynthetic mode. Our finding challenges the conventional view that no chemical bonds between <b>alpha-cellulose</b> and lignin are present in higher plant cell walls and calls for new strategies for further understanding of the chemical linkage between the two major constituents of cell walls.

And in a long sequence for the bleaching of dissolving pulp, acid treatment {{can be used in}} two approaches: to remove the metal ions without washing before the chelation stage, and to reduce hemicellulose and ash in the final stage...|$|E
40|$|Ten 22 {{year old}} radiata pine trees growing in two stands in Chile, one in clay {{and the other}} in humid sand soils showing some lean, were {{assessed}} for chemical composition and wood density of compression wood. Significant differences in type of wood in density (33 kg/m³), lignin (1. 944 %), <b>alpha-cellulose</b> (- 2. 634 %), ethanol toluene extractives (0. 567 %) and pentose (0. 742 %) were found between matched sample of compression and opposite woods. Differences in juvenile and mature wood were significant for both density (- 4 kg/m³) and pentose (1. 628 %), and site differences were found for wood density (28 kg/m³), extractives (0. 978 %) and apparent for alpha cellulose (1. 223 %). In comparison with other studies, our results suggested that the compression wood formed from trees with light visible lean corresponded to a mild compression class...|$|E
40|$|Mangroves grow along coastal lines {{over a wide}} {{latitudinal}} {{range and}} therefore have great potential for recording high-resolution environmental information of tropical to sub-tropical regions. Such records can potentially be linked to tropical corals and temperate tree rings. We undertook carbon isotope, trace element and lead isotope analyses on a sample of a living mangrove (Rhizophora apiculata) of known age from Leizhou Peninsula (about 20 ºN, 109 - 110 ºE) from the northern coast of the South China Sea. The {{results show that the}} tree-rings are annual and their <b>alpha-cellulose</b> d 13 C values are significantly correlated with ring width, annual sea level, salinity and sea surface temperatures in the growth period, suggesting mangrove tree-rings may be used to characterize past sea level fluctuations (Yu et al, 2004, Geophysical Research Letters, 31, L 11203, doi: 10. 1029 / 2004 GL 019450). The concentrations of most trace elements show weak declining trends from 1982 to 1999, punctuated by several high concentration spikes. The declining trends are positively correlated with ring width and negatively correlated with water use efficiency inferred from <b>alpha-cellulose</b> delta 13 C, suggesting a physiological control over metal-uptake in this species. The episodic metal concentration-peaks cannot be interpreted with lateral movement in the tree trunk or growth activities, and appear to be related to local environmental pollution events. Lead isotope compositions clearly document the importance of gasoline Pb as an atmospheric contaminant taken up by tree leaves. Moreover, shale-normalised rare earth element and yttrium (REE+Y) patterns are relatively flat and consistent across the growth period, with all patterns showing a positive Ce anomaly and elevated Y/Ho ratio. The positive Ce anomaly is observed regardless of the choice of normaliser, in contrast to previously reported REE patterns for terrestrial and marine plants (Yu et al. 2007, Nuclear Instruments & Methods in Physics Research-B, doi: 10. 1016 /j. nimb. 11. 127). This study demonstrates the promising potential for the use of mangroves for monitoring environmental change...|$|E
30|$|Wet {{chemical}} analyses of wood components {{have been performed}} on untreated and heat-treated E. pellita wood. Before chemical analysis, the wood samples were grinded, sieved (0.425 – 0.250  mm), and air-dried. The moisture content (MC) of the samples was determined by oven drying at 105  °C to a constant weight and the ash content was determined by ashing in a muffle furnace at 575  ±  25  °C for 6  h based on National Standard of the People’s Republic of China [24, 25]. The contents of Klason lignin, holocellulose, <b>alpha-cellulose</b> in holocellulose, alcohol-benzene solubility, and 1 % NaOH extractives in E. pellita wood were determined according to National Standard of the People’s Republic of China [26 – 30], which were described by Sun et al. [31]. The amount of each chemical component is reported as % based on ash-free dry organic matter. Chemical analyses were performed in duplicate.|$|E
40|$|Commercial <b>alpha-cellulose</b> was compression-molded {{to produce}} 1 A {{dog-bone}} specimens under various operating conditions without any additive. The resulting agromaterials exhibited a smooth, plastic-like surface, and constituted a suitable target as replacement for plastic materials. Tensile and three-points bending {{tests were conducted}} according to ISO standards related to the evaluation of plastic materials. The specimens had strengths comparable to classical petroleum-based thermoplastics. They also exhibited high moduli, which is characteristic of brittle materials. A higher temperature and higher pressure rate produced specimens with higher mechanical properties while low moisture content produced weaker specimens. Generally, the strong specimen had higher specific gravity and lower moisture content. However, some parameters did not follow the general trend e. g., thinner specimen showed much higher Young's Modulus, although their specific gravity and moisture content remained similar to control, revealing a marked skin-effect which was confirmed by SEM observations...|$|E
40|$|Terentang wood (Campnosperma auriculata Hook. f) is {{relatively}} low in specific gravity (0. 3), hence its utilization as pulp by chemi-mechanical {{is an alternative}} process. Energy consumption was reduced by applying lignin degrading fungi (Phanerochaete chrysosporium) as pretreatment in the chemi-mechanical process. This paper examines the effects of P. chrysosporium incubation periods into chemical components and energy refining consumption of terentang wood. Four percent of NaOH {{was used in the}} chemi-mechanical process, and incubation periods studied were 0 (control), 3, 4 and 5 weeks. Results showed that P. chrysosporium significantly affected the weight loss, chemical properties, and refining energy consumption of terentang wood pulping process. Wood chip weight loss was about 15. 95 - 21. 31 % and <b>alpha-cellulose</b> raised up to 6. 77 %. Five weeks incubation time decreased lignin content up to 22. 97 % and saved the refining energy up to 22. 7 %...|$|E
40|$|Studies of {{specific}} gravity, fiber length, and the summative chemical analysis of Aucoumea klaineana and Khaya ivorensis plywood peeler cores (PPC), yielded holocellulose contents of 78 and 79 percent, <b>alpha-cellulose</b> values of 49. 7 and 49. 6 percent, pentosan of 17 and 19 percent, lignin contents of 27. 5 and 29. 4 percent, caustic soda solubles of 10. 3 and 12. 1 percent, hot-water solubles of 7. 1 and 11. 6 percent, alcohol-benzene solubles of 2. 1 and 2. 7 percent, ash contents of 0. 75 and 0. 79 percent, specific gravity values of 0. 43 and 0. 51, and average fiber length measurements of 1. 27 and 1. 57 mm, respectively. Based on {{the parameters of}} fiber length, specific gravity, and chemical composition {{it can be said}} that PPC retained from the rotary-cut veneer method (as wood wastes) of the previous wood species are suitable for pulp production...|$|E
