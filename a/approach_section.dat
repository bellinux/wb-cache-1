50|$|The basic {{layout of}} a yard ramp is an {{inclined}} section of about 9 m (29'6") {{in length and}} 2.25 m (7'5") in width, followed by a flat <b>approach</b> <b>section</b> of about 2.5 m (8'3") in length at the top, with a lip to enter the container or truck being loaded or unloaded. Both sides of the ramp usually have safety rails to prevent forklifts from accidentally driving over the edges. The yard ramp is supported on an undercarriage, or adjustable legs, fitted with wheels which are used to transport the yard ramps around.|$|E
50|$|Possibly one of {{the very}} first changes to the ride was the removal of the fire effect {{from the top of the}} temple and the {{steaming}} from the jaguars located in the Station <b>Approach</b> <b>section</b> of the track during Cedar Fair's corporate take over. Another change that occurred during the operation of Jaguar! was the addition of fabric seatbelts; very similar to the ones found on Montezooma's Revenge and GhostRider, also due to Cedar Fair. A second more noticeable change was the repainting of the attraction. It was changed from a red track with brown supports to a bright orange track with light blue supports. As of 2016 the colors have been returned to red track and light brown supports.|$|E

5000|$|The {{position}} in India {{is closer to}} that in EU. First, we follow the fair dealing approach and not the fair use <b>approach.</b> <b>Section</b> 52(1)(a) and (b) mention the specific purposes for which fair dealing exception is available. Hence, the Indian law has not given the Judges wide discretion with respect to this. Second, our statute does not lay down the factors {{that need to be}} considered while determining whether fair dealing has been done. We rely on judicial decisions for the same. The Indian Courts have frequently relied on Hubbard v Vosper [...] In the instant case, the Court laid down the relevant factors and tried to follow a factored approach. However, their approach was actually piecemeal as they did not apply one of the factors and gave more than required stress on some other factor. The first factor was not applied here and the second factor was treated as definitive. Interestingly, such an approach can be seen in other cases as well. For instance, in The Chancellor Masters and Scholars of The University of Oxford v. Narendera Publishing House and Ors. the ultimate question was whether the work was transformative and the other factors were not given the same amount of weight. The above-mentioned case also points out to how the Indian judiciary has adopted the requirement of transformation from the United States.|$|E
5000|$|Jaguar! has a semi-complex [...] "block system" [...] {{to avoid}} the trains from coming too close or in {{complete}} contact with each other. The location of each train is monitored by proximity sensors that when sensing the metal of the brake fin, send the location to the main computer, which is displayed on the main dispatch control panel. The ride has three different blocks not including the station. [...] "A Block" [...] is {{from the end of}} station approach into the station. [...] "B Block" [...] is from the top of Lift 1 to the top of Lift 2. [...] "C Block", the only possible place to have a [...] "Set Up" [...] occur, is {{from the top of the}} second lift to the station <b>approach</b> <b>section</b> of the track. A [...] "set up" [...] is what occurs when one train attempts to enter a block already occupied by another train. The dispatch panel only allows the operator to send one train after the second train has cleared the second lift, thus entering the [...] "C Block". There are six places where the train can stop: Station, Lift 1, Lift 2 Approach, Lift 2, [...] "C" [...] Brakes, Station Approach. The train enters the station from station approach automatically when [...] "Auto Advance" [...] is activated. However, if the [...] "Auto Advance" [...] is deactivated, the train will stay in Station Approach while the other train travels through A and B Block. Once the train hits the top of Lift 2 with the one train in Station Approach, both lifts will stop immediately and the dispatcher's display will read [...] "067 Block C/Setup", indicating the two trains are attempting to occupy the same block. The other possible setup is an [...] "061 Block R/Setup", when the trains become too close in the computer's readings, though only one train is occupying the blocks.|$|E
