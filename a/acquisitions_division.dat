50|$|Mergers, <b>acquisitions,</b> <b>division</b> and reorganizations {{occur between}} law firms {{as in other}} businesses. The {{specific}} books of business and specialization of attorneys {{as well as the}} professional ethical structures surrounding conflict of interest can lead to firms splitting up to pursue different clients or practices, or merging or recruiting experienced attorneys to acquire new clients or practice areas. Results often vary between firms experiencing such transitions. Firms that gain new practice areas or departments through recruiting or mergers that are more complex and demanding (and typically more profitable) may see the focus, organization and resources of the firm shift dramatically towards those new departments. Conversely, firms may be merged among experienced attorneys as partners for purposes of shared financing and resources, while the different departments and practice areas within the new firm retain a significant degree of autonomy.|$|E

Angel breaks the demon's neck, then learns from Harmony that he was supposed to meet with it to negotiate with its clan.

The 148-seat auditorium is equipped with the latest technology, including a network connection at every seat. The auditorium features Dolby surround sound, theater-style seating, a portable lectern with a touch screen control system and teleconference capabilities. Dedicated in 2008, the James F.

In 2003, the University of Scranton named the board room in honor of PNC Bank to recognize a significant grant from the PNC Foundation for the construction of Brennan Hall and to acknowledge the support PNC has consistently provided to the university, as [...] "PNC Bank has been a loyal friend of the University of Scranton and a generous supporter of our educational mission and commitment to serve those living in northeast Pennsylvania.” Additional facilities of the Executive Center, which is available to organizations outside the university, include a lobby and reception area, and a meeting room accommodating 20 people.|$|E

40|$|Technical Services at University of Michigan {{underwent}} a major reorganization in 2007, combining the Serials and <b>Acquisitions</b> <b>Division</b> with the Monograph Cataloging Division {{which led to}} a substantial reduction in time to shelf. Resources were reallocated for the increasing electronic assets and long neglected special projects. This paper details the changes made in staffing configurations and responsibilities, as well as adjustments in workflow, including employment of vendor records for a modified EDI ordering process and utilization of shelf-ready processing for print materials. To speed items to the shelf, new acquisitions were mainstreamed and cataloging on receipt was implemented for materials with bibliographic copy. A procedure to flag records needing further work was developed and implemented with the collaboration of the library systems staff. These flagged records were then searched online monthly via an automated process using defined match points to find and accept a fuller record for overlay. Only those materials for which no better record was found would be reviewed for any further cataloging which might be required. In this reorganization, some staff members were reassigned to areas in Electronic Resources and Database Management, while experienced and rare book catalogers could focus on uncataloged materials in the Special Collections Library, such as Transportation History and Rare books, as well as significant gifts including a 20, 000 item collection of Sheet Music and The Walp Collection of Children’s Literature.
