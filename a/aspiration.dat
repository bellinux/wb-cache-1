5|$|<b>Aspiration</b> {{may also}} be {{considered}} in secondary pneumothorax of moderate size (air rim 1–2cm) without breathlessness, with the difference that ongoing observation in hospital is required even after a successful procedure. American professional guidelines state that all large pneumothoraces – even those due to PSP – should be treated with a chest tube. Moderately sized iatrogenic traumatic pneumothoraces (due to medical procedures) may initially be treated with <b>aspiration.</b>|$|E
5|$|If {{investigations}} confirm NSCLC, {{the stage}} is assessed {{to determine whether the}} disease is localized and amenable to surgery or if it has spread {{to the point where it}} cannot be cured surgically. CT scan and positron emission tomography are used for this determination. If mediastinal lymph node involvement is suspected, the nodes may be sampled to assist staging. Techniques used for this include transthoracic needle <b>aspiration,</b> transbronchial needle <b>aspiration</b> (with or without endobronchial ultrasound), endoscopic ultrasound with needle <b>aspiration,</b> mediastinoscopy, and thoracoscopy. Blood tests and pulmonary function testing are used to assess whether a person is well enough for surgery. If pulmonary function tests reveal poor respiratory reserve, surgery may not be possible.|$|E
40|$|Self Determination Theory (SDT) asserts <b>aspirations</b> (life goals) of {{personal}} growth, relationship and community (intrinsic <b>aspirations)</b> support wellbeing, whereas <b>aspirations</b> for wealth, image and fame (extrinsic <b>aspirations)</b> is detrimental. The following study explores <b>aspirations</b> on {{a sample of}} 386 leaders towards job satisfaction, and also testing the differences by leadership position (senior and junior). Findings show that all <b>aspirations</b> are related to job satisfaction, with extrinsic <b>aspirations</b> negatively related and intrinsic <b>aspirations</b> positively. Regression analysis showed that significant predictors were image <b>aspirations</b> (negatively) and personal growth <b>aspirations</b> and relationships <b>aspirations</b> (positively). In addition, the majority of interaction effects were significant showing that senior leaders enjoyed greater job satisfaction than junior leaders, regarding most <b>aspirations.</b> This study is important as it highlights the positive nature of intrinsic <b>aspirations</b> and the negative influence of extrinsic <b>aspirations.</b> Furthermore, it {{highlights the importance of}} a senior leadership position for leveraging <b>aspirations</b> towards superior job satisfaction...|$|R
40|$|Are high <b>aspirations</b> harmful or beneficial? The hedonic {{adaptation}} prevention model {{posits that}} lofty <b>aspirations</b> are detrimental to well-being (Lyubomirsky, 2011; Sheldon & Lyubomirsky, 2012), yet other {{research suggests that}} happy people tend to have higher <b>aspirations</b> than their less happy peers (Jacobs Bao, 2012; Jacobs Bao, Boehm, & Lyubomirsky, 2013). The current {{study was designed to}} address the associations among height of <b>aspirations,</b> fulfillment of <b>aspirations,</b> and well-being. U. S. adults (N = 333) documented their well-being and <b>aspirations</b> over 12 weeks. Work and romantic relationship <b>aspirations</b> were reported each week, and fulfillment of those <b>aspirations</b> was assessed the following week. The height of the <b>aspirations,</b> as rated by objective coders, was not consistently related to well-being. However, higher <b>aspirations</b> were relatively less likely to be fulfilled, and lower fulfillment predicted lower well-being. Thus, high <b>aspirations</b> appear to be detrimental to well-being when those <b>aspirations</b> are not realized. The theoretical and applied implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R

The out-of-home care adolescents reported lower occupational <b>aspirations,</b> less career planning, more career barriers, lower educational <b>aspirations</b> for themselves, lower parental <b>aspirations,</b> and more school engagement. Further, career exploration was lower for out-of-home care children who had higher <b>aspirations,</b> lower self-efficacy, parents who communicated higher <b>aspirations,</b> and low aspiring friends.

5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} can {{be associated}} with minor complications such as broken teeth or lacerations of the tissues of the upper airway. It can also {{be associated with}} potentially fatal complications such as pulmonary <b>aspiration</b> of stomach contents which can result in a severe and sometimes fatal chemical <b>aspiration</b> pneumonitis, or unrecognized intubation of the esophagus which can lead to potentially fatal anoxia. Because of this, the potential for difficulty or complications due to the presence of unusual airway anatomy or other uncontrolled variables is carefully evaluated before undertaking tracheal intubation. Alternative strategies for securing the airway must always be readily available.|$|E

40|$|Four studies {{examined}} the effects of nature on valuing intrinsic and extrinsic <b>aspirations.</b> Intrinsic <b>aspirations</b> reflected prosocial and other-focused value orientations, and extrinsic <b>aspirations</b> predicted self-focused value orientations. Participants immersed in natural environments reported higher valuing of intrinsic <b>aspirations</b> and lower valuing of extrinsic <b>aspirations,</b> whereas those immersed in non-natural environments reported increased valuing of extrinsic <b>aspirations</b> and no change of intrinsic <b>aspirations.</b> Three studies explored experiences of nature relatedness and autonomy as underlying mechanisms of these effects, showing that nature immersion elicited these processes whereas non-nature immersion thwarted them and that they in turn predicted higher intrinsic and lower extrinsic <b>aspirations.</b> Studies 3 and 4 also extended the paradigm by testing these effects on generous decision making indicative of valuing intrinsic versus extrinsic <b>aspirations...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{develops}} an <b>Aspirations</b> Index for Children based on self-determination theory and elucidates {{the role of}} <b>aspirations.</b> A total of 1, 398 junior-high school students in the 7 th to 9 th grades participated in a questionnaire survey in Studies 1 and 2. The results of exploratory factor analysis reveal that the <b>Aspirations</b> Index consists of two aspirations: namely, intrinsic and extrinsic <b>aspirations.</b> As theoretically hypothesized, confirmatory factor analysis supports both seven sub-categories within the <b>aspirations</b> and a higher-order model. The results of correlation analysis indicate that, compared to extrinsic <b>aspirations,</b> intrinsic <b>aspirations</b> are positively correlated with life satisfaction, autonomous motivation for academic activities, and prosocial behaviors. In addition, we find that extrinsic <b>aspirations</b> are higher for boys than for girls. Finally, we discuss future directions {{and the benefits of}} using the <b>Aspirations</b> Index for Children for career education...|$|R

5|$|In a large PSP (>50%), or in a PSP {{associated}} with breathlessness, some guidelines recommend that reducing the size by <b>aspiration</b> is equally effective as {{the insertion of}} a chest tube. This involves the administration of local anesthetic and inserting a needle connected to a three-way tap; up to 2.5liters of air (in adults) are removed. If there has been significant reduction {{in the size of}} the pneumothorax on subsequent X-ray, the remainder of the treatment can be conservative. This approach has been shown to be effective in over 50% of cases. Compared to tube drainage, first-line <b>aspiration</b> in PSP reduces the number of people requiring hospital admission, without increasing the risk of complications.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{a theory of}} socially determined <b>aspirations</b> as reference points for the in-dividuals. In this theory, society-wide economic outcomes shape individual <b>aspirations,</b> which affect the investment incentives of individuals. Through its impact on investments, individual <b>aspirations</b> in turn affect ambient social outcomes. We explore this two-way link in settings in which <b>aspirations</b> and income (and the distribution of income) evolve jointly. In particular, we explore the relationship between <b>aspirations,</b> growth and widening inequality. Our model cap-tures both the inspiration and the potential frustrations that can result from higher <b>aspirations...</b>|$|R
40|$|The recent {{literature}} postulates that <b>aspirations</b> {{are one of}} the key {{determinants of}} economic decision making, and that <b>aspirations</b> are formed socially through observations and by learning from 'relevant others' (or the 'reference group'). This study empirically examines the latter using survey data collected from sample households in rural Ethiopia. Specifically, the study examines the effect of social interactions on <b>aspirations.</b> Based on several definitions of a 'reference group', we find that <b>aspirations</b> are indeed socially determined through observations as well as social interactions. Results also indicate that the social network size is an important determinant of <b>aspirations,</b> attesting to the importance of widening the <b>aspirations</b> window - a person's cognitive world that shapes their <b>aspirations.</b> Across gender, results indicate that the effect of social interactions on <b>aspirations</b> is larger for females...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} labour market {{behaviour}} of employed individuals that have entrepreneurial <b>aspirations</b> {{in addition to}} <b>aspirations</b> to switch job. We analyze empirically these two “search processes” side-by-side and find that entrepreneurial <b>aspirations</b> and <b>aspirations</b> to switch job are relatively common. However, most employees are not engaged in both search processes, nor are the two processes alike: It {{is more difficult to}} empirically explain entrepreneurial <b>aspirations</b> than <b>aspirations</b> to switch job. Only few observable characteristics of the employed are related to both processes. Varied experience and job dissatisfaction are directly related to the probability of having entrepreneurial <b>aspirations</b> and <b>aspirations</b> to switch job, while job tenure is inversely related to them. Our analysis also contributes {{to the understanding of the}} process of transition from work into entrpreneurship: Employees who can experiment with new things in their present job, regard the content of their work important, and are dissatisfied with their superiors have more often entrepreneurial <b>aspirations</b> than others.

The current study, guided by self-determination theory, examined the consequences of pursuing and attaining <b>aspirations</b> over a 1 -year period in a post-college sample. Results indicated that placing importance on either intrinsic or extrinsic <b>aspirations</b> related positively to attainment of those goals. Yet, whereas attainment of intrinsic <b>aspirations</b> related positively to psychological health, attainment of extrinsic <b>aspirations</b> did not; indeed, attainment of extrinsic <b>aspirations</b> related positively to indicators of ill-being. Also as predicted, the association between change in attainment of intrinsic <b>aspirations</b> and change in psychological health was mediated by change in the satisfaction of the basic psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness.

40|$|This {{exploratory}} research examined the contributing {{influence of a}} range of contextual and individual variables on the prediction of education, occupation and income <b>aspirations</b> for Maori. Such variables included parental support, parental <b>aspirations,</b> personality, socioeconomic status, age, and Treaty of Waitangi claims settlements. Of particular interest was determining whether Treaty of Waitangi settlements to Maori had influenced the <b>aspirations</b> of individual Maori affiliated to such iwi, compared to those Maori affiliated to iwi that had not received settlement. Two studies were conducted. A small qualitative study of ten Maori was first performed to ascertain participant subjective experiences related to their <b>aspirations.</b> In the second larger study, 225 Maori completed a questionnaire designed to determine participant <b>aspirations</b> and the variables that may influence them. Multiple regression analyses revealed that, education <b>aspirations</b> were predicted by parental education <b>aspirations</b> and age; occupation <b>aspirations</b> were predicted by parental occupation aspirations; and income <b>aspirations</b> were predicted by iwi settlement status. This last finding however was treated with caution. It is hoped that that the present study of variables influencing the <b>aspirations</b> of Maori will provide a comprehensive reference base of comparison for any future related research...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the role of}} energy provision in influencing the social <b>aspirations</b> {{of people living in}} slums. We examine factors that influence the shift in <b>aspirations</b> in five slum settlements using data from 500 interviews conducted in serviced and non-serviced slums from the state of Gujarat in India. The non-serviced slums did not have access to basic services namely water, sanitation, energy, roads, solid waste and rainwater management. We find empirical evidence which suggests that when basic infrastructure provisions are met, slum dwellers shift their focus from lower order <b>aspirations</b> to the higher order <b>aspirations</b> like health, education, housing and land ownership. We argue that energy provision enhances productivity and enables slum dwellers to shift their <b>aspirations</b> upwards. Furthermore, we test the effect of work days lost due to illness on the relationship between higher order <b>aspirations</b> and <b>aspirations</b> for energy provision. When provision of energy is low, higher work day loss dampens higher order <b>aspirations.</b> For policy makers, this study highlights the critical link between the infrastructure services preferred by slum dwellers and their social <b>aspirations</b> for growth...|$|R

40|$|The general aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the educational <b>aspirations</b> of the children of immigrants living in Italy and attending the last year of primary school (8 th grade). We look at the educational <b>aspirations</b> both as a predictor of educational choice and as a measure of social integration. We consider both secondary school track and university <b>aspirations</b> as indicators of educational preferences in the short and long run. Data have been collected during the 2005 - 2006 school year and they come from the ITAGEN survey: the first Italian nation-wide extensive survey on children with at least one foreign-born parent. First, we analyze association between <b>aspirations</b> and structural characteristics (e. g. migration status and country of origin) and social aspects such as family socioeconomic status, and friendship ties. These aspects seem to be determinants in defining both short and long time <b>aspirations,</b> while long-term <b>aspirations</b> are not associated with migration status. Second, we investigate the relevance of context in delineating educational <b>aspirations.</b> To develop this second aspect we perform multilevel analysis that takes into account both individual and school level variables. Our hypothesis, confirmed both for short and long <b>aspirations,</b> is that attending a school where most of the Italian pupils have high educational <b>aspirations</b> may lead children of immigrants to enhance their own <b>aspirations.</b> educational <b>aspirations,</b> immigrant integration, ITAGEN, friendship ties, scholastic context...|$|R
