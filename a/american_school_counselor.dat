The study shared school counselors' views on educational policies, practices, and reform, and how many of them, especially in urban and rural school settings, are not given the chance to focus on what they were trained to do, especially career and college access counseling and readiness for all students, in part due to high caseloads and inappropriate tasks that take up too much of their time. School counselors made strong suggestions about their crucial role in accountability and success for all students and how school systems need to change so that school counselors can be key players in student success. Implications for public policy and district and school-wide change are addressed. The National Center for Transforming School Counseling at The Education Trust released a brief, Poised to Lead: How School Counselors Can Drive Career and College Readiness, challenging all schools to utilize school counselors for equity and access for rigorous courses for all students and ensuring college and career access skills and competencies be a major focus of the work of school counselors K-12.|$|E

40|$|According to the <b>American</b> <b>School</b> Counseling Association (ASCA, 2010), <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> {{are charged}} with meeting the academic, social/emotional and career needs of all {{students}} (2010). In addition, <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> serve as the front line in dealing with trauma and crisis in their <b>schools.</b> Those <b>counselors</b> who {{understand the importance of}} their own wellness and practice healthy lifestyle behaviors are better equipped to meet these demands.

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 The <b>American</b> <b>School</b> Counseling Association’s Code of Ethics {{states that}} {{counselor}}s and counselor trainees must be competent providers of multicultural counseling, able to practice effectively with clients whose identities differ from their own. Pre-service <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> receive very little training around immigration status {{and how to}} work with clients who migrate from different countries and cultures. <b>School</b> <b>counselors,</b> counselor educators and pre-service counselors are also asked to seek out current, relevant research to provide a basis for the interventions and treatment offered to clients. Recent literature in school counseling has identified educational gaps among individuals who identify as, or are identified as, ethnic minorities. Higher rates of high school dropout and lower rates of postsecondary education matriculation have been found in immigrant samples as compared to nonimmigrant samples. However, existing articles are limited by: (a) sample sizes, (b) access to secondary student data, and (c) limited <b>school</b> <b>counselor</b> interventions. Additionally, <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> and counselor educators have not researched these differences in immigration and graduation or postsecondary aspirations. To address this gap three research questions were explored. The first question asked what was the relationship between certain resiliency skills and immigrant status of middle school students. Results indicated a small but significant relationship between immigrant status and the skills of wellbeing and understanding the importance of education. The second research question queried as to whether a relationship exists between immigrant student contact with a <b>school</b> <b>counselor</b> and college as a post-secondary plan in high school. The results indicated a significant but small negative relationship between immigrant students meeting with a <b>school</b> <b>counselor</b> on career and college planning and college as a postsecondary plan. The third research question inquired as to whether a relationship exists between immigrant status and utilization of a <b>school</b> <b>counselor</b> for career and college planning in high school. The results indicated a small but significant positive relationship between immigrant status and utilization of a <b>school</b> <b>counselor</b> for career and college planning. The primary implication that emerged from the aforementioned research was that <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> should be especially in tuned to the needs of immigrant students as their skills and needs may differ from native born students. Additionally, students who immigrate should be given an opportunity to meet individually with their <b>school</b> <b>counselor</b> for both wellbeing and career and college related topics...|$|R

To begin addressing this gap in the literature, the purpose of this qualitative dissertation {{study was to examine the}} experiences of high <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> in the southeastern United States who have served as advocates for and with LGBT students across identity groups, with a specific focus on race and class. The overarching research questions that informed and provided structure to the qualitative process were aimed at more thoroughly understanding how <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> define advocacy within the framework of school counseling; how <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> advocate for and with LGBT students across identity groups; and how <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> describe factors that facilitate and impede advocacy efforts for and with LGBT students. In order to explore diverse participant experiences and contextual differences, this qualitative study took place at various high schools across the southeastern United States in urban, rural and suburban school settings. Twelve high <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> were interviewed for this study. Data were collected through twelve one-time semi-structured interviews and a document review. A dialectical approach to data analysis (Galman, 2013), informed by both inductive and deductive reasoning, shaped the coding scheme.

Briefly, in this study leadership practice is the core unit of analysis in trying to understand school leadership from a distributed perspective. ^ The qualitative research methodology chosen for this study is ethnography and this ethnographic study conducted in Mid West in a high school setting. The data were analyzed with the line-by-line coding technique. The findings indicated that the <b>school</b> <b>counselors</b> at the research site made important systemic changes. These changes mostly happened as a result of the counselors 2 ̆ 7 personal willingness to be part of the leadership in the school. However, the institutionalized opportunities for counselors to lead were limited therefore many changes stayed at the idiosyncratic level and the counselors often relied on their informal working relationships to shape the leadership practice.
