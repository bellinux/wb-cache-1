In the temperature integration approach, considerable daily temperature variations are allowed, which not only have an important influence on plant growth {{but also on the}} development rate of arthropods in the crop. Therefore, we examined the influence of two constant temperature regimes (15 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C/ 15 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C and 20 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C/ 20 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C) and one alternating temperature regime (20 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C/ 5 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C, with <b>an</b> average of 15 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C) on life table parameters of Phytoseiulus persimilis and Neoseiulus californicus and their target pest, the two-spotted spider mite Tetranychus urticae at a 16 : 8 (L:D) h photoperiod and 65 +/- A 5 % RH. For females of both predatory mites the alternating temperature regime resulted in a 25 - 30 % shorter developmental time as compared to the corresponding mean constant temperature regime of 15 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C/ 15 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C. The immature development of female spider mites was prolonged for 7 days at 15 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C/ 15 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C as compared to 20 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C/ 5 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C. With <b>a</b> daytime temperature of 20 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C, no differences in lifetime fecundity were observed between a nighttime temperature of 20 and 5 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C for P. persimilis and T. urticae. The two latter species did show a higher lifetime fecundity at 20 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C/ 5 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C than at 15 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C/ 15 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C, and their daily fecundity at the alternating regime was about 30 % higher than at the corresponding mean constant temperature. P. persimilis and T. urticae showed no differences in sex ratio between the three temperature regimes, whereas the proportion of N. californicus females at 15 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C/ 15 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C (54. 2 %) was significantly lower than that at 20 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C/ 5 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C (69. 4 %) and 20 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C/ 20 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C (67. 2 %). Intrinsic rates of increase were higher at the alternating temperature than at the corresponding mean constant temperature for both pest and predators. Our results indicate that thermal responses of the studied phytoseiid predators to alternating temperature regimes used in energy saving strategies in glasshouse crops may have consequences for their efficacy in biological control programs...|$|R

Twenty-one patients who classified as grade I PLRI using dial test with subluxated tibia, but classified as grade II with tibial reduction evaluated retrospectively. The mean follow-up was 39. 3 months (range 24 - 61 months). Each patient was evaluated by the following variables: posterior translation and varus laxity on radiograph, KT- 1000 arthrometer, dial test (reduced and subluxated position), International Knee Documentation Committee, Orthopadische Arbeitsgruppe Knie scoring system and Tegner activity scale. There were significant improvements in posterior tibial translation (8. 6 +/- A 2. 0 to 2. 1 +/- A 1. 0 mm; P < 0. 001), varus laxity (3. 3 +/- A 1. 3 to 1. 4 +/- A 0. 5 mm; P < 0. 001) and external rotation (13. 2 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>A</b> A +/- A 0. 8 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> to 3. 6 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>A</b> A +/- A 1. 1 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> at 30 <b>A</b> <b>degrees,</b> 13. 3 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>A</b> A +/- A 0. 9 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> to 3. 6 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>A</b> A +/- A 0. 9 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> at 90 <b>A</b> degrees; P < 0. 001).

The growth rates of shrimp at 25 +/- <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C or 25 +/- <b>A</b> 3 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C were significantly higher than that at a constant temperature of 25 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C. On the other hand, the growth rate in 25 +/- <b>A</b> 4 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C regime was significantly lower than those in other regimes. The daily feed intake rate of shrimp at 25 +/- <b>A</b> 4 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C was the lowest, and the food conversion efficiency was also significantly lower than those at 25 +/- <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C and 25 +/- <b>A</b> 3 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C, respectively. The food conversion efficiency at 25 +/- <b>A</b> 2 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C or 25 +/- <b>A</b> 3 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C was significantly higher than those in other regimes. Thus, it can be inferred that the growth enhancement in the test shrimp at the suitable diel fluctuating temperatures was due to high food conversion efficiency. Studies of the physiological parameters showed that at 25 +/- <b>A</b> 4 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C, the hemolymph glucose content of the test shrimp was the lowest, while the activity of PK in hepatopancreas was the highest, which indicated that the test shrimp at 25 +/- <b>A</b> 4 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C was in a stressed condition. The hemolymph glucose content of the test shrimp at 25 +/- <b>A</b> 3 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C was the highest, and the activity of HK in hepatopancreas was the lowest. These results indicated that the test shrimps at 25 +/- <b>A</b> 3 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C were not in a stressed condition. Compared with the constant temperature regime, the expression of HSP 70 in any of the four cyclical temperature change regimes was not significantly increased.

The present study aimed to investigate the critical thermal maxima (CTMax) and the expression of HSP 70 in different tissues (gill, brain, muscle and liver) of an endemic catfish Horabagrus brachysoma acclimated at either 20 or 30 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C for 30 days. To understand the HSP 70 response, fish acclimated to the two temperatures were exposed to preset temperatures (26, 30, 34, 36 and 38 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C for 20 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C acclimated fish and 32, 34, 36, 38 and 40 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C for 30 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C acclimated fish) for 2 h, followed by 1 h recovery at their respective acclimation temperatures. The HSP 70 levels in the gill, brain, muscle and liver tissues were determined by Western blotting of one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A significant (P < 0. 05) increase in the CTMax values was observed for fish acclimated at 30 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C (41. 86 +/- A 0. 39 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C) than those acclimated at 20 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C (39. 13 +/- A 0. 18 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C). HSP 70 was detected in all the tissues with the highest level in the liver followed by intermediate levels in muscle and brain, and lowest level in gill tissue, irrespective of the acclimation temperatures (20 or 30 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C). The HSP 70 levels were significantly higher (P < 0. 05) in the tissues of fish acclimated at 30 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C than those acclimated at 20 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C. The mean induction temperature of HSP 70 in all the tissues of fish acclimated at either 20 or 30 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C was 30 and 34 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C, respectively.

40|$|International audienceFour sets of mono-element (ME) and {{two kinds}} of {{multifilament}} (MF) internal-Sn Nb 3 Sn superconducting strands were designed and fabricated through RRP method in which different compoment ratios, various composite configurations and some third element alloying were arranged. All the strand samples underwent <b>a</b> 210 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C/ 50 h + 340 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C/ 25 h thermal duration for Cu-Sn alloying. After that A 15 phase formation heat treatment (HT) was applied for which the ME samples were chosen at three reaction temperatures of 675 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C, 700 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C and 725 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C for 100 h and 200 h while the MF samples at four temperatures of 650 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C, 675 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C, 700 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C and 725 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C for 128 h and 200 h. The heat-treated samples were examined for A 15 phase composition distribution by X-ray EDS. SQUID magnetization measurement {{was used to determine}} critical temperature T (C). The obtained results demonstrate that for fully-reacted internal-Sn Nb 3 Sn superconductors the A 15 phase composition and the intrinsic property T (C) are determined by the diffusion and solid state reaction mechanism and are independent of the factors including HT temperature, strand composite component and configuration arrangement, and the third element addition within the experimental range...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{determine}} the normal three-dimensional relationship between the humeral and the glenoid plane of the individual patient. We measured the three-dimensional angle between the glenoid plane and the humeral plane (glenohumeral angle, <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> GH) and the angle between the plane of the scapula and the plane of the glenoid (glenoscapular angle, <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> GS) with the patient in a standardized position to the CT scan gantry. We hypothesized that a normal distribution with a small variation would exist for both angles. A total of 150 conventional CT scans of normal shoulders from patients aged between 18 and 80 years were examined and three-dimensional reconstructions were derived from it. The descriptive statistics and the variability of <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> GH and <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> GS were determined. The mean <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> GH was 57. 9 <b>A</b> <b>degrees,</b> and the mean <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> GS was - 3. 77 <b>A</b> <b>degrees.</b> The overall reliability of the measurement was good. Descriptive statistics of this study confirm the normal distribution and a narrow variation of both parameters. This is the first study to determine the normal 3 D relationship between the humerus and the glenoid (<b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> GH). This new three-dimensional anatomical information of the normal glenohumeral relationship and glenoid can be used to distinguish normal from pathological anatomy, as well as alternative surgical guidance especially in bony deficient glenoids...|$|R
40|$|Nitrification is a well-studied and {{established}} process to treat ammonia in wastewater. Although thermophilic nitrification could avoid cooling {{costs for the}} treatment of warm wastewaters, applications above 40 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C remain <b>a</b> significant challenge. This study tested the effect of salinity on the thermotolerance of mesophilic nitrifying sludge (34 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C). In batch tests, 5 g NaCl L- 1 increased the activity of aerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AerAOB) by 20 - 21 % at 40 and 45 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C. For nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB), the activity remained unaltered at 40 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C, yet decreased by 83 % at 45 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C. In <b>a</b> subsequent long-term continuous reactor test, temperature was increased from 34 to 40, 42. 5, 45, 47. 5 and 50 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C. The AerAOB activity showed 65 and 37 % higher immediate resilience in the salt reactor (7. 5 g NaCl L- 1) for the first two temperature transitions and lost activity from 45 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C onwards. NOB activity, in contrast to the batch tests, was 37 and 21 % more resilient in the salt reactor for the first two transitions, while no difference was observed for the third temperature transition. The control reactor lost NOB activity at 47. 5 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C, while the salt reactor only lost activity at 50 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C. Overall, this study demonstrates salt amendment as a tool for a more efficient temperature transition for mesophilic sludge (34 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C) and eventually higher nitrification temperatures...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the {{temperature}} response of photosynthesis in rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis Mull. Arg.) to provide data for process-based growth modeling, and to test whether photosynthetic capacity and temperature response of photosynthesis acclimates to changes in ambient temperature. Net CO 2 assimilation rate (A) was measured in rubber saplings grown in a nursery or in growth chambers at 18 and 28 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C. The temperature response of A was measured from 9 to 45 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C and the data were fitted to an empirical model. Photosynthetic capacity (maximal carboxylation rate, V (cmax), and maximal light driven electron flux, J (max)) of plants acclimated to 18 and 28 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C were estimated by fitting a biochemical photosynthesis model to the CO 2 response curves (A-C (i) curves) at six temperatures: 15, 22, 28, 32, 36 and 40 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C. The optimal temperature for A (T (opt)) was much lower in plants grown at 18 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C compared to 28 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C and nursery. Net CO 2 assimilation rate at optimal temperature (A (opt)), V (cmax) and J (max) at a reference temperature of 25 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C (V (cmax 25) and J (max 25)) as well as activation energy of V (cmax) and J (max) (E (aV) and E (aJ)) decreased in individuals acclimated to 18 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C. The optimal temperature for V (cmax) and J (max) could not be clearly defined from our response curves, as they always were above 36 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C and not far from 40 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C. The ratio J (max 25) /V (cmax 25) was larger in plants acclimated to 18 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C. Less nitrogen was present and photosynthetic nitrogen use efficiency (V (cmax 25) /N (a)) was smaller in leaves acclimated to 18 <b>A</b> <b>degrees</b> C. These results indicate that rubber saplings acclimated their photosynthetic characteristics in response to growth temperature, and that higher temperatures resulted in an enhanced photosynthetic capacity in the leaves, as well as larger activation energy for photosynthesis...|$|R
