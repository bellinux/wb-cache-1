5|$|Cockatoos {{prefer to}} eat seeds, tubers, corms, fruit, flowers and insects. They often feed in large flocks, {{particularly}} when ground-feeding. Cockatoos are monogamous and nest in tree hollows. Some cockatoo {{species have been}} <b>adversely</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> habitat loss, particularly from a shortage of suitable nesting hollows after large mature trees are cleared; conversely, some species have adapted well to human changes and are considered agricultural pests.|$|E
5|$|Darjeeling {{has seen}} a {{significant}} growth in its population, its decadal growth rate being 47% between 1991 and 2001. The colonial town was designed for a population of only 10,000, and subsequent growth has created extensive infrastructural and environmental problems. The district's forests and other natural wealth have been <b>adversely</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> an ever-growing population.|$|E

5|$|The {{market for}} supercars was growing when the {{production}} XJ220 was announced, with comparable cars immediately reselling after delivery {{for three and}} four times the list price. The Ferrari F40 had been selling for more than £800,000 in 1990, but like the XJ220 it was <b>adversely</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> the recession, and by 1992 prices had dropped to between £100,000 to £150,000.|$|E
5|$|Train {{operating}} {{companies were}} <b>adversely</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> the disruption, losing an estimated 19% of {{revenue in the}} year following the crash. Freight operator EWS was cancelling up to 400 trains per week as a result, whilst estimates put Freightliner's resultant losses at £1 million per month. The cost to the entire UK economy of the disruption was estimated at £6 million per day.|$|E

Farmers in Texas, also affected by a major hurricane, requested growers in Florida wait 15days so they could sell their citrus crop that fell. The damaged dam near Tampa initially resulted in waters from the Hillsborough River being pumped into the city's water treatment plant, and a new dam was eventually built in 1944.|$|E
5|$|Both {{subspecies}} of South Asian {{river dolphins}} {{have been very}} <b>adversely</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> human use of the river systems in the subcontinent. Irrigation has lowered water levels throughout both subspecies' ranges. Poisoning of the water supply from industrial and agricultural chemicals may have also contributed to population decline. Perhaps the most significant issue is the building of more than 50 dams along many rivers, causing the segregation of populations and a narrowed gene pool in which the dolphins can breed. Currently, three subpopulations of Indus river dolphins are considered capable of long-term survival if protected.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 18th century, Lima was <b>adversely</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> the Bourbon Reforms as it lost its {{monopoly}} on overseas trade and the important mining region of Upper Peru was transferred to the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. This economic decline made the city's elite dependent on royal and ecclesiastical appointment and thus, reluctant to advocate independence. In the 1810s, the city became a Royalist stronghold during the South American wars of independence led by a strong viceroy, José Fernando de Abascal y Sousa.|$|E

5|$|Invertebrate {{introductions}} {{have had}} an observable effect on Puerto Rican fauna. Native freshwater snails such as Physa cubensis have been <b>adversely</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> introduced species. Currently, the most abundant freshwater snail in Puerto Rico is the Quilted Melania (Tarebia granifera), an introduced species. Another invertebrate introduced to Puerto Rico is the honeybee. This animal competes with the endangered Puerto Rican parrot for secondary nesting cavities at the Caribbean National Forest. Africanized bees, which pose an even greater threat for secondary cavity nesters, have recently extended their range to Puerto Rico. Other introductions include 18 species of ant, {{one of the most}} abundant taxa in leaf litter habitats.|$|E

5|$|The largest {{breeding}} {{populations are}} in Russia (up to 500,000pairs), Spain (112,000 pairs) and Belarus (60,000 pairs). There have been declines {{in much of}} the range, but especially in northwestern Europe. The loss of insect prey through pesticide use, coupled with disturbance, collision with vehicles and habitat loss have contributed to the falling population. As ground-nesting birds, they are <b>adversely</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> disturbance, especially by domestic dogs, which may destroy the nest or advertise its presence to crows or predatory mammals. Breeding success is higher in areas with no public access; where access is permitted, and particularly where dog owners allow their pets to run loose, successful nests tend to be far from footpaths or human habitation.|$|E

5|$|Once Congress approves {{a salary}} {{reduction}} and the nominee is confirmed, legal experts conclude that in practice {{it is unlikely}} that an appointment would be successfully challenged in the courts. The most likely claimant would be an individual who has been <b>adversely</b> <b>affected</b> <b>by</b> a discretionary decision under the nominee's authority—for example someone denied a passport. It is unlikely that anyone would be found to have standing to contest the appointment. The Supreme Court has become less solicitous of standing since retreating from the most expansive level of United States v. SCRAP. In particular, it has been unwilling to grant standing for a generalized constitutional injury other than to a plaintiff who is protected by a statute or when a statute grants standing.|$|E
