5|$|The {{music video}} chronicles two {{alternative}} time frames, {{with the first}} of Carey in the present, tearful and remorseful their separation, while the other of several different past memories in which she shared with her lover. The video begins with Carey wearing a long brown blouse, laying on a sofa in an elegantly furnished home. As the song begins, she stands up and walks <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> while remembering and lamenting her failed relationship. As the first memory of Carey and her lover together on a soccer field is shown, she is once again shown in the present, however clothed in a large white sweater while tears trickle down her cheek. As the memory continues of that night on the soccer field, they are seen together, caressing each other and holding {{each other in a}} tight embrace. Carey, in the present, makes her way into a heated pool, where she lays her leg on the deck, re-enacting a famed scene from Marilyn Monroe's unreleased film, Something's Got to Give (1962). The next memory is of the pair together in the same pool, however in happier times. During the song's bridge, the scenes alternate from Carey at her home in the present, to the duo holding each other intimately in a car. The video ends with Carey alone in the car, while wearing her lover's jacket.|$|E

[...] Both videos were shot back to back, and were released simultaneously to music programs and channels for immediate circulation.

[...] As the video progresses as the lyrics continue, {{it appears to be}} 5 AM, and Carey is still unable to sleep. She lies in bed with the lamp on, pondering on thoughts of a past lover until she takes a bath. Afterwards, she makes her way to the kitchen, and begins pouring an abundant amount of cereal and milk into a bowl, spilling it over the counter in a restless rage. As the scene finishes, Snoop's face is seen on a small monitor, directing his verse to Carey in the video. As the last chorus plays, Carey becomes restless and tosses a champagne glass and bottle at a large window, shattering it and sending glass <b>around</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> The video ends with Carey lying down on the couch one more, attempting to sleep once more.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{continue}} the argument which {{was presented in}} a previous paper in Environment and Planning B. There, two spatial genotypes were established within a sample of sixteen Turkish vernacular houses. The first was configurationally integrated <b>around</b> <b>the</b> principal <b>living</b> <b>room</b> or sofa, and the second was configured {{by means of the}} external paved courtyard which gave access to the dwelling from the street. Houses of the first type were shown to structure significant configurational differences within the suite of principal, first-floor <b>living</b> <b>rooms.</b> <b>The</b> sofa seems to have acted as an integrating hinge which linked these spaces together, and controlled access to and egress from the relatively segregated street outside. The second type of room arrangement was characterised by an integration core whch ran from the exterior through to the interior of the dwelling, and was centred on an external paved courtyard. In this paper we explore further the spatial properties of the two house types, and characterise these as 'deep core' and 'shallow core', respectively. It is proposed that the first may be considered a more introverted or centripetal plan, and the second a more extroverted or centrifugal layout. These differences are shown to embody alternative forms of household organisation, in that they support different conceptions of family life, gender relations, and ways of receiving guests into the home. The social origin of the genotypes is attributed to the existence of conservative and liberal tendencies within Turkish society during the period at which the houses were constructed. ...|$|R
5000|$|The film {{is divided}} into two parts. For the first third of the movie, Godard {{discusses}} {{what it takes to make}} a film (money) and describes how he got the money. Numéro deux begins with a long monologue by Jean-Luc Godard, in an editing suite. Godard discusses his move to a smaller place from Paris, the finances required to make a film and alludes to the relationship between machines and people, bodies as factories and landscapes and the idea that a film studio is a factory in which he is both worker and the boss. He says that creating his movies has become like working in a factory for him: [...] "Now there are only machines. I am the boss, but I am also the worker. There are other factories: in Los Angeles, called Fox and Metro, in Moscow, in Algeria." [...] During this opening sequence of the film, viewers are presented with television monitors featuring characters who will return in the main section later on. [...] In the second part, the remaining two thirds, each character in the story discusses their quotidian experiences through dialogue. The film observes the life of the sexuality and economics in a middle-class family in a social housing complex in France. The wife complains of her constipation (her inability to make a 'number two,' alluded to in the title) to her children. When the husband discovers that she has slept with another man, he takes his revenge her by sodomizing her, which only makes her constipation worse. During this sex, they realize that their daughter has been watching them. They discuss this complacently. They discuss how a woman’s body is described as electricity, charging up and decharging, and sex is work when it becomes something for a child to watch. Godard, and later in the story, Sandrine and Pierre, describe these things as not being contradictory, but flowing from one to another through the word “and”. In one sequence, mother and daughter cavort <b>around</b> in <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> at lunch time - the mother wearing nothing but an untied robe and the daughter in underwear - while the son toys with his meal in the kitchen and holds his head in boredom. Sandrine says: Le plaisir, c’est pas simple. C’est l’angoisse qui est simple, pas le plaisir. C’est le chômage qui est simple, pas le plaisir. Quand il y a du plaisir à être chômeur, alors c’est le fascisme qui s’installe. The children participate in discussions about sex and body parts, and comment on it. Vanessa states: “Sometimes what my parents do is pretty, sometimes it’s caca.” [...] Sandrine and Pierre’s family is “observed” by static cameras installed in rooms of an apartment, that were later played back and recorded on 35 mm film. The opening sequence of the film is at full-screen resolution (having been filmed on 35 mm camera directly) but the scenes in the apartment often take up only a small portion of the screen, and play off each other. The sound design emphasises the outside noises (birds singing, children playing) over the people’s dialogue, giving the effect of the outside world coming in, affecting what occurs in the home.|$|R
