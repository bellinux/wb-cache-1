500|$|Cooper {{discusses}} how {{he feels}} Minority Report emphasizes the future importance over the control of imagery. According to him, the images captured from the precogs' visions in the film bestow power on those who control their processing. He says the film warns viewers that those who control images must be carefully overseen so as to prevent the abuse of power, and that the film presents [...] "governance as a problem of image arrangement." [...] The film also presents a future world where government probes use advanced media technology to monitor its citizenry. Cooper says the quandary arises when the film intimates that there were will be no way to escape the media industry's omnipotence in the future, {{while at the same}} time defending [...] "the need for image manipulating institutions." [...] He feels that this logically raises another issue in that the same concern could be leveled towards image-makers such as DreamWorks, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> [...] "film's virtue lies in provoking this question." [...] He notes that the film's tranquil ending concludes with the Andertons looking out into a peaceful exterior with only rain visible, and the precogs reading in their isolated, idyllic farm, and both families apparently free of electronic surveillance.|$|E
500|$|Hemingway {{scholars}} {{think the}} work is more complicated and important than a cursory read suggests. With the publication of True at First Light critics saw a more humane and empathetic Hemingway, and began to shift their emphasis away from {{the image of the}} [...] "white man with a gun." [...] Robert Fleming considers True at First Light [...] {{to be part of the}} Hemingway canon declaring, [...] "This is a more complicated book than it appears to be, and Hemingway deserves far more credit for it than the reviewers of the popular press have given it. Serious critics dealing with the late works would be advised not to ignore it". Gadjusek praises the prose style, which he says is a new direction in Hemingway's writing; he also believes, despite the editing, the book is cohesive and whole with well-ordered themes. [...] Burwell considers the edits to the manuscript generally well-done, though she laments losses that she thinks contribute to some of the subtexts in the book. Biographer Kenneth Lynn criticized Hemingway's sons for editing the manuscript but of Hemingway he says the [...] "memoirist is being totally, indeed helplessly honest," [...] and Gray concedes the publication of the book [...] "underscores Hemingway's courage as a writer". Despite what he considers poor workmanship in the book, Wood considers Hemingway even at his worst a compelling writer <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> literary estate should be left alone to save the literary influence.|$|E

25|$|According to Baudouin, {{who gives}} these details, {{there was no}} one in the French ships injured even by a wound, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> that <b>the</b> Indians on board behaved well.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear boy, {{you must}} have seen--you cannot have helped seeing--that my time is not long here. I have seen an English doctor today, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> end may come at any moment." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{dare say}} the first year you won't feel it. I have a brother settled in Canada, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> first year people come out from England they don't feel the cold {{anything}} like what they do later on.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{a letter}} from Mr. Ford, Mistress Blythe, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> life-book is {{accepted}} {{and is going to}} be published next fall. I felt fair uplifted when I got the news. To think that I'm to see it in print at last." ...|$|E

6000|$|At last Philip {{burst into}} Combe Manor, fiery red with riding and consternation. 'Oh! father, father, Paul Duval's boat is come in, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> that <b>the</b> villain Papists have butchered every Protestant in France.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It seems, sir, that he {{has been}} carrying, or helping to carry, a sick woman down from the mountains, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> ground was very rough and strewn with boughs, so that one can {{understand}} that he got some terrible shakes and jolts, which would quite account for the state of his wounds." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am so glad, {{for now it}} will {{be easier}} for me to tell you. And since that I have seen Mr. Furnival, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> same. I tell you because you are so good and so loving to me. I will keep nothing from you; but you must not tell Sir Peregrine that I talked to Mr. Furnival about this." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, that's {{the joke}} of it," [...] said Hicks, fluttered with his {{superior}} knowledge. [...] "I've been pumping the cabin-boy, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> captain {{never saw her}} till yesterday. She's an up-country school-marm, and she came down here with her grandfather yesterday. She's going out to meet friends of hers in Venice." [...] The little man pulled at his cigar, and coughed and chuckled, and waited confidently for the impression.|$|E
6000|$|... "Let the Dahcotah {{open his}} ears very wide," [...] he said 'that big words may {{have room to}} enter. His friend the Big-knife comes with an empty hand, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> that <b>the</b> Teton must fill it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Our {{lives are}} {{in the care of}} Providence, I see. If we can really rely on these two Injins, all may be well; for Peter has brought us to an admirable cover, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> that <b>the</b> Chippewa {{prepared}} it." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "The very thing. You've heard him. And saying our {{fortunes}} were made. Took {{me out to}} the Ho'burm Restaurant, George,--dinner, and we had champagne, {{stuff that}} blows up the back of your nose and makes you go SO, and he said at last he'd got things worthy of me--and we moved here next day. It's a swell house, George. Three pounds a week for the rooms. <b>And</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> Business'll stand it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I had {{a letter}} from Ryan, yesterday," [...] Terence said. [...] "He tells me {{that they have had}} no {{fighting}} since we left. They form only one battalion now, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> state of things in Madrid is dreadful.

6000|$|... "God knows," [...] he {{answered}} with a groan; [...] "but I {{think that he is}} sure that we shall never find the gold without you, since the Molimo has told him that it is for you and you alone, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> old man has second sight, or something of the sort. Well, he would have murdered me--I saw it in his eye--so I thought it better to give in rather than that you should be left here sick and alone. Of course there was one way----" [...] and he paused.|$|E
5000|$|Douglas R. Hofstadter, in Metamagical Themas: Questing for the Essence of Mind and Pattern, finds {{many of the}} {{illustrations}} [...] "grotesque and disturbing" [...] and others [...] "extremely beautiful <b>and</b> visionary". <b>He</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> book [...] "seems to people to glorify entropy, chaos, and incomprehensibility".|$|R
6000|$|Oh, my friends, is {{not this}} news? {{good news and}} {{unexpected}} news, perhaps, but still as true as what went before it? God hath said the one, and we believe it: <b>and</b> now <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> other; <b>and</b> shall we not believe it too? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said; [...] "I {{have been}} to one of <b>the</b> great doctors, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>he</b> thinks <b>the</b> scars will quite {{disappear}} in time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We're {{in an old}} {{wine cellar}} tonight, dad," [...] he wrote, [...] "in water to our knees. Rats everywhere--no fire--a drizzling rain coming down--rather dismal. But it might be worse. I got Susan's box today and {{everything}} was in tip-top order {{and we had a}} feast.

Tell Susan I'd give a year's pay for a good batch of her monkey-faces; but don't let that inspire her to send any for they wouldn't keep.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, Robert will be there. I've {{made him}} as neat {{as a new}} pin this morning, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> Bishop will think him too buckish by half. I took him into Mammy Dempster's room to show himself. We hear Tryan is making sure of the Bishop's support; but we shall see. I would give my crooked guinea, and all the luck it will ever bring me, to have him beaten, for I can't endure {{the sight of the}} man coming to harass dear old Mr. and Mrs. Crewe in their last days. Preaching the Gospel indeed! That is the best Gospel that makes {{everybody}} happy and comfortable, isn't it, mother?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Madam," [...] said Lodloe, [...] "don't {{think of}} it. I have made {{inquiries}} of the landlord, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> roads are rough, {{and that it}} will take more than an hour to reach the Squirrel Inn, so that if you do not start now I fear you and the baby will not get there before dark. I prefer to stay here to-night, and it will be no trouble at all for me to look up a suitable person for you, and to take her with me to-morrow. It will be a good plan to take four or five of them, and when you have selected the one you like best the others can come back here in the wagon. It will be a lark for them." ...|$|E

50|$|Several puzzles in Rise of the Dragon have {{multiple}} possible solutions Blade's activities {{can influence the}} plot of the game later on.

5000|$|Although Donovan credits {{directors}} Chi Chi LaRue and Steven Scarborough with influencing {{his career}} as a performer <b>and</b> director, <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> greatest influence has come from producer/director Jim Steel.

60|$|He {{thought it}} all over, {{and finally he}} {{concluded}} to try the low ground again, especially as he {{wanted to start a}} brickyard this time. He bought a flat, and put out a hundred thousand bricks to dry preparatory to baking them. But luck appeared to be against him. A volcano shoved itself through there that night, and elevated his brickyard about two thousand feet in the air. It irritated him a good deal. He has been up there, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> bricks are all baked right enough, but he can't get them down. At first, he thought maybe the government would get the bricks down for him, because since government bought the island, it ought to protect the property where a man has invested in good faith; but all he wants is quiet, and so {{he is not going to}} apply for the subsidy he was thinking about.|$|E
6000|$|... 'He {{has been}} thrown out of his gig in the Bridge Way, and he was taken up for dead. They were {{carrying}} him home as we were coming to church, and I stayed behind to see what I could do. I went in to speak to Mrs. Dempster, and prepare her a little, {{but she was not}} at home. Dempster is not dead, however, he was stunned with the fall. Pilgrim came in a few minutes, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> right leg is broken in two places. It's likely to be a terrible case, with his state of body. It seems he was more drunk than usual, and they say he came along the Bridge Way flogging his horse like a madman, till at last it gave a sudden wheel, and he was pitched out. The servants said they didn't know where Mrs. Dempster was: she had been away from home since yesterday morning; but Mrs. Raynor knew.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 21. I {{was this}} morning busy with my printer: I {{gave him the}} fifth sheet,(5) and then I went and dined {{with him in the}} City, to correct something, and alter, etc., and I walked home in the dusk, and the rain overtook me: and I found a letter here from Mr. Lewis; well, and so I opened it; <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> <b>the</b> peace is past danger, etc. Well, and so there was another letter {{enclosed}} in his: well, and so I looked on the outside of this t'other letter. Well, and so who do you think this t'other letter was from? Well, and so I'll tell you; it was from little MD, N.23, 23, 23, 23. I tell you it is no more, I have told you so before: but I just looked again to satisfy you. Hie, Stella, you write like an emperor, a great deal together; a very good hand, and but four false spellings in all. Shall I send them to you? I am glad you did not take my correction ill. Well, but I won't answer your letter now, sirrah saucyboxes, no, no; not yet; just a month and three days from the last, which is just five weeks: you see it comes just when I begin to grumble.|$|E
