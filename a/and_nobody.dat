For the upcoming game Kingdom Hearts III, there is a possibility of Roxas being revived despite Sora being alive at the same time.

5|$|His {{capital is}} {{believed}} to be somewhere in modern-day Haryana. Prithu used his Kshatriya power to make the earth yield its riches. Hence the earth is called Prithvi, daughter of Prithu.

Prithu enjoyed popularity amongst his subjects, hence all kings are called Rajas. Cows yielded buckets of rich milk when they were touched. Trees and lotuses always had honey in them. People were healthy and happy and had no fear of thieves or wild animals. Nobody died of accidents. Kusha grass was golden in colour. Fruits were always sweet and ripe <b>and</b> <b>nobody</b> went hungry. People lived in houses or caves or trees or wherever they liked.
