The teaching toolkit is comprised of a three-dimensional CAD drawing file, shear connection calculator tool, and a teaching guide document.

The calculator tool contains a series of MathCAD ® worksheets that illustrate the <b>applicable</b> <b>limit</b> states for the six types of shear connections that are represented on the Steel Sculpture. The worksheets are designed to be simple to use, with few limitations, yet able to accommodate nearly any standard shear connection design while still following the design and analysis provisions prescribed in the AISC-LRFD specification.

Also performed is a low resolution simulation of the Venus atmosphere by using a simplified GCM but with an accurate radiation model for the Venus atmosphere as a preparation for high resolution simulation.

The results of the simulations show a variety of small scale disturbances. Dust mass flux shows that small scale disturbances contribute dust lifting significantly. Dust mass flux increases as the increase of horizontal resolution. It is shown that the horizontal scale of small scale disturbances in the low latitude decreases as the increase of resolution. As for the simulation of the Venus atmosphere, zonal wind remains very weak especially below 50 km even with the use of an accurate radiation model, although the result shows mean wind with remarkable jet above 50 km.

For this reason the Umweltbundesamt (UBA) intends to extend the awarding catalogue for the ecolabel 'Blauer Engel RAL-UZ 53 ' for low-noise construction machines and construction implements by the category of the tower cranes. The present report shows that it is possible from the economical and technical aspect, to launch tower cranes - depending on the electrical drive power - with a sound power level L_W_A> 91 dB and > 86 dB on the market of the EU-States.

40|$|Design of {{experiment}} {{is a method}} where the relation between input factors and outputs can be studied. In practice, a number {{of experiment}}s are conducted and the input(s) are changed between each experiment. Gained information can then be used {{to find out how}} to improve the process under study. It is applicable to many areas from cooking to radio frequency (RF) simulations. This thesis focuses on the effects of transmission line lengths and their effect to different RF parameters. Study is applied to a long term evolution frequency division duplexing (LTE-FDD) mobile front end. The purpose is to find out the applicability of DOE to RF design process. To be able to start final simulations it is required that layout is completed. When layout is finished, accurate parameter values can be used to receive reliable results. For example, transmission line lengths are acquired from the layout. However, there may be situations where the layout is not entirely finished. Therefore, it would be an advantage if limits for the length of a transmission line length could be defined without compromising reliability. In this thesis DOE is applied to search for suitable limits for the transmission line lengths. If applicable boundaries are found, simulations could be done before layout is completed. To find out the acceptable boundaries, existing simulation models are used to study the effects of transmission line lengths to different RF parameters. Chosen transmission lines are then varied in length with desired limits. Acquired results, using the limits, are then compared to a nominal case, where no transmission line variation is done. A set of different percentual limits are used. Studied RF parameters are insertion loss and return losses in each port. DOE was utilized on two RF (LTE-FDD) front ends. LTE-FDD bands 2 and 12 were chosen to cover two unique cases. Though only LTE-FDD front ends are investigated, the information received could also be applied on other RF transmission lines in other types of front end, such as GSM or WCDMA front ends. ii The study revealed that DOE can be used as tool to evaluate whether a transmission line length, within a limit, is applicable to continue simulation process. In some situations the case might be that no <b>applicable</b> <b>limit</b> is found. If the limit is not usable, simulation process cannot be continued without compromising the accuracy of the results...|$|E
40|$|This paper concludes a {{five year}} program on {{research}} into {{the use of a}} portable X ray fluorescence (XRF) analyzer for analyzing lead in air sampling filters from different industrial environments, including mining, manufacturing and recycling. The results from four of these environments have already been reported. The results from two additional metal processes are presented here. At both of these sites, lead was a minor component of the total airborne metals and interferences from other elements were minimal. Nevertheless, only results from the three sites where lead was the most abundant metal were used in the overall calculation of method accuracy. The XRF analyzer was used to interrogate the filters, which were then subjected to acid digestion and analysis by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP OES). The filter samples were collected using different filter holders or "samplers" where the size (diameter), depth and homogeneity of aerosol deposit varied from sampler to sampler. The aerosol collection efficiencies of the samplers were expected to differ, especially for larger particles. The distribution of particles once having entered the sampler was also expected to differ between samplers. Samplers were paired to allow the between sampler variability to be addressed, and, in some cases, internal sampler wall deposits were evaluated and compared to the filter catch. It was found, rather surprisingly, that analysis of the filter deposits (by ICP OES) of all the samplers gave equivalent results. It was also found that deposits on some of the sampler walls, which in some protocols are considered part of the sample, could be significant in comparison to the filter deposit. If it is concluded that wall deposits should be analyzed, then XRF analysis of the filter can only give a minimum estimate of the concentration. Techniques for the statistical analysis of field data were also developed as part of this program and have been reported elsewhere. The results, based on data from the three workplaces where lead was the major element present in the samples, are summarized here. A limit of detection and a limit of quantitation are provided. Analysis of some samples using a second analyzer with a different X ray source technology indicated reasonable agreement for some metals (but this was not evaluated for lead). Provided it is only necessary to analyze the filters, most personal samplers will provide acceptable results when used with portable XRF analysis for lead around <b>applicable</b> <b>limit</b> values...|$|E
