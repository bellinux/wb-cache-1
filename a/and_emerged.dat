5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} west coast of Africa <b>and</b> <b>emerged</b> into the Atlantic Ocean on September11. After tracking westward for five days, the wave entered the Caribbean Sea on September16. Convection steadily increased in both coverage and intensity, and by September19, the system reached the southwestern Caribbean Sea. Satellite imagery and surface observations indicated that Tropical Depression Nine formed at 1800UTC on September19, while located 50miles (80km) north-northwest of San Andres Island.|$|E
5|$|After {{becoming}} an extratropical low, {{the remnants of}} Ivan turned to the southeast <b>and</b> <b>emerged</b> into the Atlantic Ocean, due to the building of an upper-level ridge to its east. As an extratropical cyclone, Ivan remained identifiable in both surface and upper-level data, and the system turned south and southwestward over the subsequent days. By September 20, the system was located off {{the east coast of}} Florida, producing scattered thunderstorms; unfavorable wind shear prevented tropical redevelopment, though forecasters indicated the possibility for more favorable conditions a few days later. On September 21 the low crossed southern Florida <b>and</b> <b>emerged</b> into the Gulf of Mexico, and as it moved across the warm waters of the region the low began to re-acquire tropical characteristics; the low-level circulation became increasingly better defined, and convection redeveloped over the center. Based on reports from Hurricane Hunters, it is estimated the low redeveloped into Tropical Depression Ivan late on September 22 while located about 175miles (280km) south-southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River.|$|E

5|$|Häkkinen set {{the fastest}} lap {{of the race}} on lap two and began to {{maintain}} the gap between himself and Michael Schumacher while both drivers {{pulled away from the}} rest of the field. Villeneuve moved into eighth position when he passed Herbert on lap seven, while Trulli clinched 11th from teammate Frentzen. Verstappen became the first retirement of the race when he coasted across the circuit with gearbox problems on lap nine and drove to his garage. Diniz made his first pit stop on lap 13, starting the first round of pit stops. At the front of the field, Häkkinen increased the gap between himself and Michael Schumacher to two seconds, who in turn was a further ten seconds ahead of Coulthard in third. Ralf Schumacher was a further 8.8 seconds behind the second McLaren driver, but was drawing ahead of Irvine in fifth. Further back, Trulli made a pit stop from tenth on lap 15 <b>and</b> <b>emerged</b> in 18th position.

40|$|Purpose {{of paper}} - This paper {{sets out to}} {{introduce}} the special issue on corporate governance in less developed <b>and</b> <b>emerging</b> economies. It summarises and reflects on themes and findings raised in the papers in the volume. Design/methodology/approach - The findings reported in the paper are based on desk research and review of the papers contained in the volume. Findings - The paper finds that the adoption of appropriate corporate governance systems is becoming a central issue in less developed <b>and</b> <b>emerging</b> economies. Factors such as the 1997 Asian financial crisis, the adoption of international donor led reforms, and the globalisation of capital markets are among the factors that are driving corporate governance reforms in less developed <b>and</b> <b>emerging</b> economies. Research limitations/implications - The pressure from international donors has compelled some less developed <b>and</b> <b>emerging</b> economies to adopt corporate governance models developed in the West with no modification. The paper argues that while it is imperative for less developed <b>and</b> <b>emerging</b> economies to reform their corporate governance systems, {{it is important that}} these systems are adapted to suite the specific needs of individual countries. Originality/value of paper - The paper is a summary of studies exploring various corporate governance issues in less developed <b>and</b> <b>emerging</b> economies. The issues addressed in these studies are important to understand corporate governance issues in both the private and public sectors in less developed <b>and</b> <b>emerging</b> economies. © 2008 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited...|$|R

5|$|A {{moderately}} strong hurricane with {{winds of}} 105mph (165km/h) was first spotted on October 6 east of Jamaica. Passing {{a short distance}} south of the island, the hurricane tracked northwestward and brushed the Yucatán Peninsula before turning north-northeastward into the Gulf of Mexico. Late on October 9, it made landfall a short distance east of Apalachicola, Florida at peak winds with an estimated pressure of 969mbar. Rapidly weakening to tropical storm status, the cyclone continued northeastward <b>and</b> <b>emerged</b> into the Atlantic Ocean from North Carolina on October 11. Later that day, it was last observed about 250mi (400km) southeast of Cape Cod.|$|E
5|$|After {{slightly}} weakening, Mekkhala tracked northwestward {{and made}} landfall over Dolores, Eastern Samar of the Philippines at around 15:00 Philippine Standard Time (07:00UTC), where Typhoon Hagupit also made landfall the month before. Both the JMA and the JTWC downgraded Mekkhala to {{a tropical storm}} on January17, due to land interaction weakening the storm significantly. Mekkhala weakened further while crossing the Bicol Region on January 18, leading the JTWC to downgrade it to a tropical depression when it turned northward <b>and</b> <b>emerged</b> into the Philippine Sea. Late on the same day, the JMA downgraded Mekkhala to a tropical depression, and shortly after the JTWC issued the final warning as strong wind shear exposed the LLCC. The tropical depression drifted northeastward and maintained its exposed low-level circulation east of Luzon, until the system was completely absorbed by a stationary front early on January 21.|$|E
40|$|Background: The use {{of ecstasy}} {{is a public}} health problem and is {{associated}} with a range of social costs and harms. In recent years, there has been growing concern about the availability and misuse of new <b>and</b> <b>emerging</b> drugs designed to mimic the effects of illicit drugs, including ecstasy. This, coupled {{with the fact that the}} age of use and the risk factors for using ecstasy <b>and</b> <b>emerging</b> drugs are similar, provides a compelling argument to implement prevention for these substances simultaneously. The proposed study will evaluate whether a universal Internet-based prevention program, known as the Climate Schools: Ecstasy <b>and</b> <b>Emerging</b> Drugs Module, can address and prevent the use of ecstasy <b>and</b> <b>emerging</b> drugs among adolescents. Methods. A cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted among Year 10 students (aged 15 - 16 years) from 12 secondary schools in Sydney, Australia. Schools will be randomly assigned to either the Climate Schools intervention group or the control group. All students will complete a self-report questionnaire at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and 6 -, 12 - and 24 -months post-baseline. The primary outcome measures will include ecstasy <b>and</b> <b>emerging</b> drug-related knowledge, intentions to use these substances in the future, and the patterns of use of ecstasy <b>and</b> <b>emerging</b> drugs. A range of secondary outcomes will also be assessed, including beliefs and attitudes about ecstasy <b>and</b> <b>emerging</b> drugs, peer pressure resistance, other substance use and mental health outcomes. Discussion. To our knowledge, this will be the first evaluation of an Internet-based program designed to specifically target ecstasy and NED use among adolescents. If deemed effective, the Climate Schools: Ecstasy <b>and</b> <b>Emerging</b> Drugs Module will provide schools with an interactive and novel prevention program for ecstasy <b>and</b> <b>emerging</b> drugs that can be readily implemented by teachers.

5|$|As of 1965, {{the route}} {{was located in}} eastern Wilkinson and western Amite counties. All of the route was a two-laned paved road. MS 572 began {{at the center of}} Centreville, near a {{railroad}} track. The route then traveled down Park Road until it exited Wilkinson County and entered Amite County. After crossing the county line, MS 572 intersected MS 24 and MS 33, and MS 572 was also branded Lower Centreville Road. Continuing eastward, the route exited Centreville and crossed over Beaver Creek <b>and</b> <b>emerged</b> into the village of Olio. MS 572 left Olio, and ended few miles later at MS 569 at a T-intersection. Lower Centreville Road continued east, concurrent with MS 569. MS 572 was maintained by the Mississippi State Highway Commission and Amite County, as part of the state highway system.|$|E

It was Cotto's first fight in Las Vegas since December 2004. According to promoter Bob Arum, the bout took place in Las Vegas to promote Cotto to a new audience while also appealing to Margarito's Mexican American fans in California. Cotto entered the fight as The Ring magazine's #1 ranked boxer in the welterweight division and #6 in their pound-for-pound rankings. Margarito entered the match as The Ring magazine's #4 ranked welterweight. Press conferences were held in Mexico, Los Angeles, New York City, and Puerto Rico to promote the world title bout.|$|E

5|$|Dan {{crossed over}} the island <b>and</b> <b>emerged</b> into the South China Sea, having lost its eye feature and {{weakened}} back into a tropical storm. Convection soon redeveloped as the storm moved northwestward through warm waters. The JTWC reports that Dan reattained typhoon status at 0000 UTC on October 12, although it according to the JMA it did so 24 hours earlier. The typhoon continued to intensify, and the JTWC estimates that it reached its peak intensity at 0600 UTC, with 1-minute maximum sustained winds of 130km/h (80mph). The JMA indicates that Dan peaked slightly afterward, with 10-minute sustained winds of 140km/h (85mph) and a minimum barometric pressure reading of 960 millibars.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} 1988–89 season, Arsenal led the First Division table; their manager George Graham had {{assembled}} a side mixed with youth and experience, captained by academy graduate Tony Adams. At one stage Arsenal were 11 points clear of defending champions Liverpool, but their lead diminished following a run of bad results. Liverpool, coached by player-manager Kenny Dalglish, capitalised after an indifferent start to the campaign, <b>and</b> <b>emerged</b> as Arsenal's main challengers for the title. Towards {{the end of the}} season Liverpool supporters were involved in a sporting disaster at Hillsborough, where 96 of the club's supporters lost their lives as a result of overcrowding during a match against Nottingham Forest on 15 April. The disaster was the worst of its kind in English sporting history, and led to an inquiry into safety standards of stadiums.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Dean {{was one of}} two {{storms in}} the 2007 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season to make landfall as a Category5 hurricane and was the seventh most intense Atlantic hurricane ever recorded, tied with Camille and Mitch.

5|$|Identified by {{its lack}} of {{associated}} frontal boundaries and closed circulation center, the first tropical cyclone of the 1911 season formed on August 4 over southern Alabama in the United States. At only tropical depression strength, it tracked eastward <b>and</b> <b>emerged</b> into the Atlantic Ocean the next day. Several days later, while located near Bermuda, the depression became a tropical storm and turned northeastward. The storm lasted several more days until dissipating on August 11. The storm produced heavy rainfall on the Bermuda, but no gale-force winds were reported. The storm was unknown until the 2005 Atlantic hurricane database revision recognized it as a tropical storm.|$|E
5|$|In 1531, the ikki {{control of}} Kaga was of such {{dominance}} that a conflict for leadership within the Hongan-ji embroiled the province {{in a civil}} war, often called the Daishō-Ikki, or Big League-Little League, war. A faction led by Renjun, a son of Rennyo, {{came to power in}} the Hongan-ji, and was hostile to the three main Kaga temples. In the resultant war, the three Kaga temples were backed by the Togashi clan, other powerful vassals, local Hongan-ji priests, and the ikki based in Echizen. Renjun was backed by many of the smaller temples <b>and</b> <b>emerged</b> victorious from the conflict when he brought in an Ikkō-Ikki army from Mikawa Province. Togashi Taneyasu was exiled, as were the other opposition leaders, and the position of shugo abolished.|$|E
