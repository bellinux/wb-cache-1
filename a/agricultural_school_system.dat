40|$|The {{role of the}} MTS (Maschinen-Traktoren Stationen), instituted in 1952 from MAS (Maschinen- Ausleihen Station), was not {{confined}} to giving the farm machinery service. It gained the political functions for advancing the rural socialism. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explain their historical significance by analyzing 1) the formation of new rural cadres through the MTS, 2) the conflict between the MTS and farmers on the use of the maschinery, 3) the function of MTS-"instructors" for the collectivization. The site of our study is Kreis Bad Doberan in Bezirk Rostock. This county was divided into 4 MTS-districts: MTS Jennewitz, MTS Radegast, MTS Rerik, and MTS Ravensberg. 　 1) The MTS was a important apparatus for the formation of new rural communist cadres. We would focus upon three groups in the MTS; the political cadre, the agricultural technocrat, and the tractor driver. Firstly the conflict on political power within the MTS arose mainly between the MTS-director and the leader of political sections. Secondly we could find 2 paths of young agronomists for moving up the social ladder. Some became from agronomist assistants into influential "instructors". Others, mainly educated and provided by the new <b>agricultural</b> <b>school</b> <b>system</b> in GDR, became often the directors of new cooperatives founded in 1957 - 1961. They were different from other cadres in that they showed, even if partially, the independence as a technocrat. In contrast, few tractor drivers made a career path for the political cadre. They consisted of rural young men and showed the higher mobility than others, in which we could find the difference from industrial workers in the social behavior. However, they did not always identified themselves with the farmers, as was recognized in their consciousness against the shift drivers. 　 2) Analyzing the utilization of the MTS-machinery, we could find the difference in working process of seed cultivation, harvest and threshing, and digging the potato. While in cultivation both farmers and cooperatives did without MTS-tractors any more, we could find the village farmers taking the leadership to avail sheaf-binders harvester and thresh machines within the villages. It was most difficult to mobilize the machines and workers for potatoes and beets, which cause to damage especially cooperatives. Concerning potatoes, strong-new-farmers did not depend upon the MTS-machinery. They confined it to the grain. 　The establishment of the MTS brigade satellite center covering the 3 - 4 villages was a measure to arrange the relation between the MTS and farmers. The dissolution of MTSs and the absorption of their machinery into large cooperative type III would finally solved these problems. We could not deny that it damaged individual farmers depending upon MTS-tractors. However, tractor drivers opposed against joining the cooperatives. While some drivers left their MTS, others could take the preferential treatment in the cooperatives, which means that the conflict between the MTS and farmers became included in the new large cooperatives. 　 3) "Instructors" of a political section, a remarkable characteristic of the MTS, had the task not only to control the discipline of MTS-organ. They had a strong influence on the village politics to advance SED political power. It is worthy to notice that many "instructors" came from rural population, although firstly engaged as a employee in the MTS. Therefore we could not regard them as a strange activist. In addition, some influential "instructors" of the MTS political section employed about 1952 / 53 were engaged in the activities as "district instructors" in 1958 - 1960. These "district instructors" had played the critical role of the collectivization after the end of 1957. They made and implemented the well-laid agitation plan for collectivization, mobilizing many kinds of rural cadres from both inside and outside of village. We could regard it as the sophisticated violence, that was one reason why the forced collectivization of GDR didn't caused the physical violence...|$|E

How social organization was handled {{by some of}} the early scholars whose work is associated with the symbolic interactionist tradition is reviewed, and a series of empirical and theoretical analyses that served as the building blocks of the perspective are described. These include analysis of the <b>agricultural</b> sciences, <b>school</b> <b>systems,</b> the American liquor industry, and passage of the Age Discrimination Act. Analytical issues in the perspective that are regarded as critical areas for further theoretical and empirical investigation include the nature of negotiations, historical processes and contexts, and the limits and consequences of negotiations. The most fundamental analytic thrust of the negotiation order perspective is its continual probing of the relation of negotiation processes to social orders. It is designed and is best utilized as a way of thinking systematically about social orders, rather than the dynamics internal to some particular episode of negotiation...|$|R

Neste trabalho, procura-se {{discutir}} alguns aspectos filosóficos referentes às ETAs e como a Cooperativa-Escola pode ajudar a solucionar seus principais problemas educativos e administrativos; um estudo de caso utilizando-se a técnica de auditoria administrativa foi desenvolvido numa ETA cuja Cooperativa-Escola é considerada um modelo de bom funcionamento e alguns procedimentos foram descritos, objetivando-se estender a prática de Cooperativa-Escola para outras escolas técnicas agrícolas brasileiras.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), School of the Environment, Washington State UniversityAdvances in the {{application}} of stable isotopes to address environmental issues have led to new understandings of biogeochemical cycles for both natural and agricultural systems. Of particular concern, is understanding nitrogen cycling in agricultural systems due to potential losses of reactive nitrogen to aquatic and atmospheric domains. Research in this area is timely because of growing concern about climate change and coastal eutrophication. The overarching concept for this research is that nitrogen cycling and pathways for nitrogen losses are substantially regulated by soil hydrologic conditions, with the premise that water availability and residence time in the soil are the key factors controlling nitrogen cycling in agricultural systems. The focus is on an artificially-drained dryland agricultural system, but the links between soil hydrology and nitrogen cycling developed here will be similar to irrigated and non-artificially drained <b>agricultural</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>School</b> of the Environment, Washington State Universit...|$|R
