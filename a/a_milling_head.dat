40|$|This work {{presents}} the concepts and definitions of a combined machining process, so called turn-milling. Several methods of turn-milling {{are presented with}} major emphasis on the orthogonal process, studied experimentally. Test specimens made of ABNT 52100 bearing steel, with average hardness of 60 - 61 HRc were machined. The cutting tool material applied was mixed ceramic inserts. Several feed rate, tool diameter and rotational speeds of workpiece and tool were tested. Tests were conducted on a CNC lathe which had <b>a</b> <b>milling</b> <b>head</b> coupled to it. This coupling was made on the transverse carrier, figuring an orthogonal exposure of the rotating axes for workpiece and tool, thus characterizing orthogonal turn-milling. The achieved results showed that work quality and low roughness values can be obtained; however, the technology must be better investigated...|$|E
40|$|The {{localization}} of {{the contact}} patch by cylindrical gears is realized usually through the flank grinding operation. This is achieved due by the continuous {{modification of the}} tooth thickness on the pitch circle. The tooth contact by external gears, as it knows by previous studies, will be produced between convex tooth flanks. M??t?? and Hollanda in [5] proposes a new procedure of cutting cylindrical gears using <b>a</b> <b>milling</b> <b>head</b> whose cutting edges are aligned on an Archimedic spiral. The meshing tooth results with a convex and a concave flank. As a consequence the localization of the contact patch will be achieved by modifying the surface curvature through variation of {{the parameters of the}} generating surface. The present paper, presents a quick CAD study solution to check, if the proposed aims in [5] is achieved. Based on the mathematical equations deduced by M??t?? e. a., using the meshing points calculated namerically, will be build the solid CAD model of the cylindrical gears with Archimedic spiral shaped teeth, will be made a proper visual reproduction of the contact patch during the gearing process.

In this paper, we present a method for the effective localisation of cutting edges of inserts in digital images of <b>an</b> edge profile <b>milling</b> <b>head.</b> We introduce <b>a</b> new image data set of 144 images of <b>an</b> edge <b>milling</b> <b>head</b> that contains 30 inserts.

40|$|Abstract. As a key {{component}} of heavy five-axis linkage CNC machine tools, the existing mechanical biaxial rotary <b>milling</b> <b>heads</b> are usually driven by worm gear, timing belt, or multi-stage gears. Worm gear is inefficiency to transmit motion, hard to maintain the accuracy and difficult to eliminate all clearance; Timing belt can be seriously worn and cannot maintain good accuracy; and multi-stage gears transmission has defects such as long chain, low transmission stiffness. This paper aims at designing <b>a</b> biaxial rotary <b>milling</b> <b>head</b> with large output torque of 3000 Nm, high precision and high rigidity. So a new design for biaxial rotary <b>milling</b> <b>head</b> with mechanical spindle, gear transmission and swinging fork structure is proposed. An integral supporting axis is applied to increase the rigidity of A-axis; through the closed numerical loop control based on precise encoder and the decoupling technology of feed motion of A/C axis, the contradiction between large reduction ratio and high precision transmission is solved, and then the requirement of high positioning accuracy (10 ") is met. Theoretical calculation and simulated analysis shown, the new design not only can guarantee transmission accuracy and dynamic characteristics of biaxial rotary <b>milling</b> <b>head,</b> but also can improve its structural stiffness and meet the high demands of large torque, high precision and high rigidity...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} how upland and paddy {{japonica rice}} responded to phosphorous (P) fertilizer under two cultivation methods. The upland rice Zhonghan 3 and the paddy rice Yangfujing 8 were both grown under moist cultivation (MC, control) and bare dry cultivation (DC) with three P levels, low (LP, 45 kg/hm 2), normal (NP, 90 kg/hm 2) and high (HP, 135 kg/hm 2). As P level increased, grain yields of both upland and paddy rice increased under DC. There {{were no significant}} differences in grain yields between HP and NP for either rice, although upland rice slightly increased and paddy rice slightly decreased in grain yield. Under DC at LP, Zhonghan 3 showed <b>a</b> higher <b>head</b> <b>milled</b> rice rate and better appearance, cooking and eating qualities than at HP or NP.

40|$|The {{recently}} proposed trainable COSFIRE {{filters are}} highly effective {{in a wide}} range of computer vision applications, including object recognition, image classification, contour detection and retinal vessel segmentation. A COSFIRE filter is selective for a collection of contour parts in a certain spatial arrangement. These contour parts and their spatial arrangement are determined in an automatic configuration procedure from a single user-specified pattern of interest. The traditional configuration, however, does not guarantee the selection of the most distinctive contour parts. We propose a genetic algorithm-based optimization step in the configuration of COSFIRE filters that determines the minimum subset of contour parts that best characterize the pattern of interest. We use a public dataset of images of <b>an</b> edge <b>milling</b> <b>head</b> machine equipped with multiple cutting tools to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed optimization step for the detection and localization of such tools. The optimization process that we propose yields COSFIRE filters with substantially higher generalization capability. With an average of only six COSFIRE filters we achieve high precision P and recall R rates (P = 91. 99 %; R = 96. 22 %). This outperforms the original COSFIRE filter approach (without optimization) mostly in terms of recall. The proposed optimization procedure increases the efficiency of COSFIRE filters with little effect on the selectivity...|$|R

50|$|A third type also exists, {{a lighter}} machine, called a mill-drill, {{which is a}} close {{relative}} of the vertical mill and quite popular with hobbyists. A mill-drill is similar in basic configuration to a small drill press, but equipped with an X-Y table. They also typically use more powerful motors than a comparably sized drill press, with potentiometer-controlled speed and generally have more heavy-duty spindle bearings than a drill press {{to deal with the}} lateral loading on the spindle that is created by <b>a</b> <b>milling</b> operation. <b>A</b> <b>mill</b> drill also typically raises and lowers the entire head, including motor, often on a dovetailed vertical, where a drill press motor remains stationary, while the arbor raises and lowers within a driving collar. Other differences that separate a mill-drill from a drill press may be a fine tuning adjustment for the Z-axis, a more precise depth stop, the capability to lock the X, Y or Z axis, and often a system of tilting the head or the entire vertical column and powerhead assembly to allow angled cutting. Aside from size and precision, the principal difference between these hobby-type machines and larger true vertical mills is that the X-Y table is at a fixed elevation; the Z-axis is controlled in basically the same fashion as drill press, where a larger vertical or knee <b>mill</b> has <b>a</b> vertically fixed <b>milling</b> <b>head,</b> and changes the X-Y table elevation. As well, a mill-drill often uses a standard drill press-type Jacob's chuck, rather than an internally tapered arbor that accepts collets. These are frequently of lower quality than other types of machines, but still fill the hobby role well because they tend to be benchtop machines with small footprints and modest price tags.|$|R
