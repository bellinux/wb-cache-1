60|$|<b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> that Kate did want? I believe {{nothing could}} have made her {{perfectly}} happy, or suited to her aunt; but {{that she would have}} been infinitely happier and better off had she had the spirit of obedience, of humility, or of unselfishness.|$|E

60|$|They did paint, {{and they}} did carve in marble, one {{historical}} scene, and one only, (of any great historical consequence.) <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> and why did they choose it, particularly? It was the Rape of the Sabines, and they chose it for the legs and busts.|$|E
6000|$|The {{thought of}} my wanderings since then became poignant, almost terrifying. The room, with all its memories, was unchanged. How safe I had been within its walls! Why could I not have been, content with what it represented? of tradition, of custom,--of religion? <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> within me that had lured me away from these? ...|$|E
6000|$|Geoffrey {{smiled again}} as he {{finished}} this letter.

40|$|<b>What</b> <b>is</b> an Austrian Regional Government Library <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> good for? (Translation of the title). Regional Government Libraries {{are rarely}} in the {{spotlight}} of public perception. Below I want to ask the question: "what is an Austrian Regional Government Library <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> good for"? For this purpose I describe and discuss some characteristics of Regional Government Libraries. These considerations are a (small) part of my master thesis entitled: "Can a regional government authority benefit from Regional Government Libraries, if they are linked together {{and if they are}} managed by information specialists"...|$|R
40|$|Some {{research}} has suggested {{the importance of}} 'enabling management' in developing pedagogies for adult literacy, numeracy and employability skills. As the journey proceeds to embed adult literacy and numeracy pedagogy into 'business as usual' for providers, what role does management play? What does enabling management look like - <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> like to <b>be</b> such a manager? Is it {{just a question of}} leadership? <b>What</b> skills <b>are</b> involved <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>it</b> important to know and to appreciate? This panel session will feature leaders from ITPs sharing their experience and answering questions...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was hard}} not to be allowed to help--it was hard to wait! When the heart was suffering, it was frightful! He turned and, looking furtively about him, lighted a cigar. Yes, it came to every one--at some time or other; <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it,</b> that death they talked of? Was it any worse than life? That frightful jumble people made for themselves! Poor Nicholas! After all, it was he that had the luck! ...|$|E

Misconduct of society belle. Norman W. Tupper, wealthy Chicago contractor, finds pretty but faithless wife in lap of officer Taylor. Belle in her bloomers misconducting herself, and her fancyman feeling for her tickles and Norman W.

60|$|We {{resolved}} {{to be going}} the next day, but about six o'clock at night we were alarmed with a great uproar in the street, and people riding {{as if they had}} been out of their wits; <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> but a hue-and-cry after three highwaymen that had robbed two coaches and some other travellers near Dunstable Hill, and notice had, it seems, been given that they had been seen at Brickhill at such a house, meaning the house where those gentlemen had been.|$|E

6000|$|He digged {{down into}} the barren earth of the desert; and he digged and he digged, but neither silver nor gold did he find. He digged and digged; and by-and-by, at last, he did find {{something}}. <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it?</b> Why, nothing but {{something that looked like}} a piece of blue glass not a big bigger than my thumb. [...] "Is that all?" [...] said Jacob Stuck. [...] "And have I travelled all this weary way and into the blinding desert only for this? Have I passed by silver and gold enough to make me rich for all my life, only to find a little piece of blue glass?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hypnos," [...] I sighed the word; and--another face, Fanny's, {{seemed to}} melt into and {{mingle with the}} visionary features. Why, why, was my desperate thought, why needed she allow the world to come to such close quarters? Why, with so many {{plausible}} reasons given in her letter for keeping poor Mr Crimble waiting, had she withheld the one that counted for most? <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it?</b> I knew {{in my heart that}} that could not be [...] "making the best use of the mess." [...] Surely, if one just told only the truth, there wasn't anything else to tell. It had taken me some time to learn this lesson.|$|E
6000|$|... "A miracle," [...] he answered. [...] "Well, {{what was}} it that led us {{to the top of the}} mount so that we were able to escape the avalanche? <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> which put that rock in your way as you sank into the bed of dust, and gave me wit and {{strength}} to dig you out of your grave of snow?

60|$|The {{dawn was}} breaking. It seemed odd {{to the king}} {{that he had been}} so long in the grave. It {{appeared}} but a few minutes ago that he had descended, passed along a few steps to the place where he had peeped beyond the veil, and returned again after perhaps five minutes of that wonderful view! <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>WAS</b> <b>it</b> he had seen? He racked his brains to remember, but he could not call to mind a single thing! How curious everything looked too! Why, his own city, which by now he was entering, seemed changed and strange to him! The sun was already up when he turned into the palace gate and entered the public durbar hall. It was full; a chamberlain came across and asked him why he sat unbidden in the king's presence. 'But I am the king!' he cried.|$|E
60|$|We were {{summoned to}} dinner. Our {{young woman was}} already seated: and a fat uniformed mate or purser or {{official}} of some sort was finishing off in the distance. The pale professor also appeared: and at a certain distance down the table sat a little hard-headed grey man in a long grey alpaca travelling coat. Appeared the beloved macaroni with tomato sauce: no food for the sea. I put my hopes on the fish. Had I not seen the cook making whiting bite their own tails viciously?--The fish appeared. <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it?</b> Fried ink-pots. A calamaio is an ink-pot: also it is a polyp, a little octopus which, alas, frequents the Mediterranean and squirts ink if offended. This polyp with its tentacles is cut up and fried, and reduced to the consistency of boiled celluloid. It is esteemed a delicacy: but is tougher than indiarubber, gristly through and through.|$|E
6000|$|I didn't {{believe she}} saw it, {{but that only}} made her the more natural; which was also the air she had on going to join Long, in his new contemplation, after I had {{admitted}} that it was of Brissenden I myself had thought. Obert and I remained together {{in the presence of}} the Man with the Mask, and, the others being out of earshot, he reminded me that I had promised him the night before in the smoking-room to give him to-day the knowledge I had then withheld. If I had announced that I was on the track of a discovery, pray had I made it yet, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it,</b> at any rate, that I proposed to discover? I felt now, in truth, more uncomfortable than I had expected in being kept to my obligation, and I beat about the bush a little till, instead of meeting it, I was able to put the natural question: [...] "What wonderful things was Long just saying to you?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Truly, {{it was a}} good {{hour when}} Dick had arrived at Fontonelles,--"just in time." [...] He could see now what a world of imbeciles was France. What stupid ignorance ruled, what low cunning and low tact could achieve,--in effect, what jugglers and mountebanks, hypocritical priests and licentious and lying noblesse went to make up {{existing}} society. Ah, there had been a fine excitement, a regular coup d'theatre at Fontonelles,--the chateau yonder; here at the village, where the news was brought by frightened grooms and silly women! He had been in the thick of it all the afternoon! He had examined it,--interrogated them like a juge d'instruction,--winnowed it, sifted it. <b>And</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> all? An attempt by these wretched priests and noblesse to revive in the nineteenth century--the age of electricity and Pullman cars--a miserable mediaeval legend of an apparition, a miracle! Yes; one is asked to believe that at the chateau yonder was seen last night three times the apparition of Armand de Fontonelles! ...|$|E
6000|$|Suppose {{some day}} one met Royalty. By accident, say! He soared to that! After all,--twelve hundred {{a year is}} a lift, a {{tremendous}} lift. How did one address Royalty? [...] "Your Majesty's Goodness," [...] it will be, no doubt--something like that--and on the knees. He became impersonal. Over a thousand a year made him an Esquire, didn't it? He thought that was it. In which case, wouldn't he have to be presented at Court? Velvet cycling breeches like you wear cycling, and a sword! What a curious place a court must be! Kneeling and bowing, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it</b> Miss Mergle used to talk about? Of course!--ladies with long trains walking about backward. Everybody walked about backward at court, he knew, when not actually on their knees. Perhaps, though, some people regular {{stood up to the}} King! Talked to him, just as one might talk to Buggins, say. Cheek of course! Dukes, it might be, did that--by permission? Millionnaires?...|$|E
6000|$|... "Blood's the word," [...] said James, gulping {{the ruby}} fluid down. [...] "Nothing like blood, sir, in hosses, dawgs, AND men. Why, only last term, just before I was rusticated, that is, I mean just before I had the measles, ha, ha--there was me and Ringwood of Christchurch, Bob Ringwood, Lord Cinqbars' son, having our beer at the Bell at Blenheim, when the Banbury {{bargeman}} offered to fight {{either of us}} for a bowl of punch. I couldn't. My arm was in a sling; couldn't even take the drag down--a brute of a mare of mine had fell with me only two days before, out with the Abingdon, and I thought my arm was broke. Well, sir, I couldn't finish him, but Bob had his coat off at once--he {{stood up to the}} Banbury man for three minutes, and polished him off in four rounds easy. Gad, how he did drop, sir, <b>and</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>it?</b> Blood, sir, all blood." ...|$|E

6000|$|So King Mark marvelled at the haughtiness of Tristram's appearance, and he {{felt his}} heart drawn toward Tristram with love and admiration.
