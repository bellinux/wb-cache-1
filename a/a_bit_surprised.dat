25|$|In 1572, Captain Juan de Salcedo of the Spanish expeditionary army {{set sail}} from Cebu and {{explored}} {{the west coast}} of the island, encountering the Mangyans, who appeared used to seeing foreigners and were not at all <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>surprised</b> at their arrival. On the contrary, it was Salcedo and Martin de Goiti who were surprised to see cross designs on the clothing and basketwork of the natives, and thought some early Christian missionary had been there before them. But later scholars believed the design was Indic in origin and had no religious meaning.|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to [...] "Homesick" [...] {{was generally}} positive. Allmusic reviewer Johnny Loftus selected the song as a track pick on {{his review of}} Undone, commenting that [...] " [...] is a delicate ballad about being apart." [...] Russ Breimeier of The Fish noted, [...] "The beautiful ballad 'Homesick' is both similar to and an improvement on 'Imagine', the difference in how it focuses on persevering on earth in anticipation of heaven". Kim Jones of About.com commented, [...] "'Homesick' is the true gem on this release," [...] also opining, [...] "Should it be a radio release, I won't be <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>surprised</b> {{to see it in}} the number one spot for many, many weeks".|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Paul Hunter, known {{for his work on}} previous Michael Jackson and TLC clips. However, for unknown reasons, the video was scrapped, and Hilson re-shot a clip for the video with [...] "Knock You Down" [...] and [...] "Number One" [...] director Chris Robinson. Robinson told Rap-Up, [...] "Keri Hilson has a great personality and is a real girl. That’s what we want to get across." [...] He also talked about the premise and plot of the video, stating that the video portrays Hilson as a woman who doesn't take herself seriously, commenting, [...] "It’s a really sexy song, but we don’t want to fall into the typical love, love, love R vibe with that... it starts where you think, ‘Oh, it’s about her and being sexy.' She’s in her house and by herself, and you kind of think it could be serious, but the song drops out in the middle and her friends catch her being all sexy, basically like, ‘What the f**k [...] are you doing? You are not singing by yourself.’" [...] In an interview with That Grape Juice, when asked about the video and on the sensuality of the live performances compared to video, Hilson responded, [...] "Yeah. It is a bit of that, but it’s a bit toned down for the video, because you got so much censoring, I can’t do everything I do on stage (laughs). So when people come out they’re probably still gonna be <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>surprised</b> to see it live, after seeing the video. But I’m very pleased with the video. I love the colours and it’s reminiscent of the whole late 70s early 80s era in music." [...] Chris Brown, Omarion, Monica, Melody Thornton, and Polow Da Don all appear in the video. The video begins with Hilson, dressed lavishly, arriving late to a Jeep full of the previous stated people. The clip flips back to what happened earlier that night, showing Hilson getting ready in a seductive fashion, as she chooses perfume and picks out clothes. Scenes of Hilson performing in front of a leather-like wall are interspersed in between her and her friends riding down a boulevard to the club. Once she arrives to the club, she is attracted to a particular man, and subsequently performs elaborate, sensual choreography with him and other dancers, before slow dancing. VIBE said, [...] "Keri Hilson is fine as wine. You know it. We know it. And she knows it. But for the doubters, she proves it once again with this seductive new video from In A Perfect World." [...] A writer for Rap-Up said that Hilson, [...] "takes it nice and slow in the video for 'Slow Dance.'" [...] The video ranked at number 80 on [...] Top 100 Videos of 2009 countdown.|$|E

The only complaint I ever had with John was that I didn't think he worked hard enough at getting himself ready and getting the team ready to play games." ...|$|R
2500|$|Maurice Richardson in The Observer of 13 November 1966 concluded, [...] "There is {{the usual}} double-take {{surprise}} solution centring round a perhaps rather artificial identity problem; but the suspense holds up all the way. Dialogue and characters are lively as flies. After this, I shan't be <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>surprised</b> to see A.C. wearing a mini-skirt." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1999, Smith re-joined Iron Maiden, {{along with}} vocalist Bruce Dickinson, who commented, [...] "When {{he left the}} band in 1990, I think {{everybody}} was <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>surprised</b> at how much we missed him and certainly, I don't think anybody had realized how much the fans would miss him – big time. I wouldn't have rejoined Iron Maiden if he wasn't in the band. I just don't {{think it would have}} been complete without Adrian, and now, it's great having three guitarists." [...] The band embarked on a short tour, after which the new line-up's first album, Brave New World, was recorded with producer Kevin Shirley and released in 2000.|$|E
2500|$|Gooch's {{commitment}} to England cricket and {{passion for the}} game remains. When commenting on the new England coaching role he said: [...] "It {{came out of the}} blue. I met Andy at Trent Bridge when I was working for radio and I was <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> <b>surprised</b> when he asked me to do it. But you spend your career trying to do your bit for England and when you're asked to help again the call of your country is special.". He has since remained as England's batting coach on a permanent basis, continuing this role for the 2010 series against Bangladesh and Pakistan, and the winter Ashes series against Australia in Australia. Double-centurion Alastair Cook (at the first test at the Gabba in Brisbane) hailed Gooch's influence on England's and his own batting prowess. Gooch subsequently has supervised England's batting (or 'run-scoring', as Ian Bell has noted Gooch refers to it) throughout their rise to number 1 in the Test cricket ICC Rankings. Prior to Gooch taking over, English batsmen had scored 6 test double-centuries in 15 years. 15 months after he became the batting coach, England had already beaten that total.|$|E

Hill. “He sat in with us and he took for granted that we knew the songs,” Cook says of his first encounter with the legendary Godfather of Soul. “So we played, and from his expression seemed he was <b>a</b> little <b>bit</b> <b>surprised</b> that we could play so well.
