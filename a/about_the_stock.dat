25|$|By {{the time}} the hotel's {{demolition}} started, Raskob had secured all of the investors {{that he needed to}} fund the construction of the building. The plan was to start construction later that year, but on October 24, the New York Stock Exchange started a steep and sudden crash, sparking what would become the decade-long Great Depression. Even so, Raskob refused to cancel the project because of the progress that had been made up to that point. Neither Raskob nor Smith lost much money in the crash: Raskob because he had stopped his speculation <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> market the previous year, Smith because he had never invested a great amount of money in the market. However, most of their investors did lose money, and as a result, in December of that year, the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company loaned Empire State Inc. some $27.5 million so the group could start construction. Even though the stock market crash obviated the need for any new office space, Raskob and Smith proceeded to start construction anyway, since canceling the project would cause investors to incur great losses.|$|E

60|$|Let us {{go back to}} {{a certain}} fine morning in the September of the year 1857, when Mr. Hopper had arrived, all unnoticed, at the age of two and thirty. Industry had told. He was now the manager's assistant; and, be it said in passing, knew more <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> than Mr. Hood himself. On this {{particular}} morning, about nine o'clock, he was stacking bolts of woollen goods near that delectable counter where the Colonel was wont to regale his principal customers, when a vision appeared in the door. Visions were rare at Carvel & Company's. This one was followed by an old negress with leathery wrinkles, whose smile was joy incarnate. They entered the store, paused {{at the entrance to the}} Colonel's private office, and surveyed it with dismay.|$|E
60|$|So Carter Druse, bowing reverently to his father, who {{returned}} the salute with a stately courtesy that masked a breaking heart, left {{the home of}} his childhood to go soldiering. By conscience and courage, by deeds of devotion and daring, he soon commended himself to his fellows and his officers; and it was to these qualities and to some knowledge of the country that he owed his selection for his present perilous duty at the extreme outpost. Nevertheless, fatigue had been stronger than resolution and he had fallen asleep. What good or bad angel came in a dream to rouse him from his state of crime, who shall say? Without a movement, without a sound, in the profound silence and the languor of the late afternoon, some invisible messenger of fate touched with unsealing finger the eyes of his consciousness--whispered into the ear of his spirit the mysterious awakening word which no human lips ever have spoken, no human memory ever has recalled. He quietly raised his forehead from his arm and looked between the masking stems of the laurels, instinctively closing his right hand <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> of his rifle.|$|E
6000|$|From the {{beginning}} I have watch'd the sharp and sometimes heavy and deep-penetrating objections and reviews against my work, and I hope entertain'd and audited them; (for I have probably had {{an advantage in}} constructing from a central and unitary principle since the first, but at long intervals and stages--sometimes lapses {{of five or six}} years, or peace or war.) Ruskin, the Englishman, charges as a fearful and serious lack that my poems have no humor. A profound German critic complains that, compared with the luxuriant and well-accepted songs of the world, there is about my verse a certain coldness, severity, absence of spice, polish, or of consecutive meaning and plot. (The book is autobiographic at bottom, and may-be I do not exhibit and make ado <b>about</b> <b>the</b> <b>stock</b> passions: I am partly of Quaker stock.) Then E.C. Stedman finds (or found) mark'd fault with me because while celebrating the common people en masse, I do not allow enough heroism and moral merit and good intentions to the choicer classes, the college-bred, the etat-major. It is quite probable that S. is right in the matter. In the main I myself look, and have from the first look'd, to the bulky democratic torso of the United States even for esthetic and moral attributes of serious account--and refused to aim at or accept anything less. If America is only for the rule and fashion and small typicality of other lands (the rule of the etat-major) it is not the land I take it for, and should to-day feel that my literary aim and theory had been blanks and misdirections. Strictly judged, most modern poems are but larger or smaller lumps of sugar, or slices of toothsome sweet cake--even the banqueters dwelling on those glucose flavors as a main part of the dish. Which perhaps leads to something: to have great heroic poetry we need great readers--a heroic appetite and audience. Have we at present any such? ...|$|E

40|$|Institution investors face {{investment}} {{constraints that}} may limit {{their ability to}} fully utilize their information.

Such demand distortion may lead to price underreaction to news and cross-sectional return predictability: Stocks with good news that institutions overweight are undervalued and subsequently have abnormal high returns; stocks with bad news that institutions underweight are overvalued and have abnormal low subsequent returns. Our tests strongly support this hypothesis. We find that stocks with higher institutional investment constraints have stronger price momentum and larger post earnings announcement drift. ...|$|R
