2500|$|That night, Louis Martin and his daughters, Léonie, Céline and Thérèse, {{attended}} the midnight mass at the cathedral in Lisieux— [...] "but {{there was very}} little heart left in them. On 1 December, Léonie, covered in eczema and hiding her hair under a short mantilla, had returned to Les Buissonnets after just seven weeks of the Poor Clares regime in Alençon", and her sisters were helping her get over her sense of failure and humiliation. Back at Les Buissonnets as every year, Thérèse [...] "as was the custom for French children, had left her shoes on the hearth, empty in anticipation of gifts, not from Father Christmas but from the Child Jesus, who was imagined to travel through the air bearing toys and cakes." [...] While she and Celine were going up the stairs she heard her father, [...] "perhaps exhausted by the hour, or this reminder of the relentless emotional demands of his weepy youngest daughter", say with some irritation [...] "Therese is far too old for this now. Fortunately this will be the last year!" [...] Thérèse had begun to cry and Céline advised her not to go back downstairs immediately. Then, suddenly, Thérèse pulled herself together <b>and</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>her</b> tears. She ran down the stairs, knelt by the fireplace and unwrapped her surprises as jubilantly as ever. In her account, nine years later, of 1895 : [...] "In an instant Jesus, content with my good will, accomplished the work I {{had not been able to}} do in ten years." [...] After nine sad years she had [...] "recovered the strength of soul she had lost" [...] when her mother died and, she said, [...] "she was to retain it forever". She discovered the joy in self-forgetfulness and added, [...] "I felt, in a word, charity enter my heart, the need to forget myself to make others happy—Since this blessed night I was not defeated in any battle, but instead I went from victory to victory and began, so to speak, [...] "to run a giant's course" [...] (Psalms [...] ).|$|E
60|$|She paused <b>and</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>her</b> brow. I sat still, {{and listened}} eagerly.|$|E
60|$|Miss Jellyby {{tapped her}} foot upon the floor <b>and</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>her</b> eyes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very ready,' said Mrs. Gummidge, shaking <b>her</b> head, <b>and</b> <b>wiping</b> <b>her</b> eyes. 'Yes, yes, very ready. I {{am sorry}} {{it should be}} along of me that you're so ready.' ...|$|R
60|$|MRS WARREN [crying again] Praddy: don't let him {{be cruel}} to me. [She hastily checks <b>her</b> tears <b>and</b> <b>wipes</b> <b>her</b> eyes]. She'll be so angry if she sees I've been crying.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not without me," [...] ses Mrs. Bullet, sobbing, <b>and</b> <b>wiping</b> <b>her</b> eyes on {{something}} she {{used for a}} pocket-hankercher. [...] "He never could bear {{to be away from}} me. Was there no last words?" ...|$|R
60|$|His relict, with {{a glance}} at his portrait, shook her head <b>and</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>her</b> eyes.|$|E
60|$|She sighed <b>and</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>her</b> eyes. Still Tavernake said nothing. She {{looked at}} him, a little surprised.|$|E
60|$|While speaking, Mrs Plornish {{shook her}} head, <b>and</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>her</b> eyes, and looked {{retrospectively}} about the room.|$|E
6000|$|She {{drew her}} hand away to find <b>her</b> {{handkerchief}} <b>and</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>her</b> tears. [...] "I suppose you've come to see Suzette; but she's gone up to the village to talk with Mr. Putney; he's our lawyer." ...|$|R
60|$|At these {{touching}} words Miss Nugent was undisguisedly affected, <b>and</b> <b>wiping</b> <b>her</b> {{bright eyes}} with her pinafore, gave her small, well-shaped nose a slight touch en passant with the same useful garment, and squeezed his arm affectionately.|$|R
60|$|Again Miss Baker {{found it}} easiest to lie well back into <b>her</b> chair, <b>and</b> <b>wipe</b> <b>her</b> eyes comfortably. She was not {{prepared}} to say much about the depths of her own heart at so very short a notice.|$|R
60|$|Miss Mowcher {{sat down}} on the fender again, and took out her handkerchief, <b>and</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>her</b> eyes.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Tetterby {{bringing}} his chair closer, Mrs. Tetterby laughed again, {{gave him a}} hug, <b>and</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>her</b> eyes.|$|E
60|$|She obeyed him instinctively. Then {{she took}} out a miserable little piece of a {{handkerchief}} <b>and</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>her</b> eyes.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Brice sighed, <b>and</b> furtively <b>wiped</b> <b>her</b> {{eyes with}} her handkerchief.|$|R
60|$|To have {{suggested}} such a story {{was certainly not}} very exhilarating, in a serious view of their position. However, {{in a few minutes}} Sue seemed to see that their position this morning had a ludicrous side, <b>and</b> <b>wiping</b> <b>her</b> eyes she laughed.|$|R
6000|$|... "You ain't {{the only}} one that has got a dear friend," [...] she says, looking. at 'im <b>and</b> <b>wiping</b> <b>'er</b> lips with the 'ankercher. [...] "I've got one, and if Charlie Brice don't promise to stay at 'ome to-morrow night I'll bring her with me." ...|$|R
60|$|Maggy at {{the range}} rammed down a greyish mass beneath {{bubbling}} suds twice with her potstick <b>and</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>her</b> brow.|$|E
60|$|She {{paused for}} breath <b>and</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>her</b> hot face, and Osborn signed to the keeper. The woman was making him ridiculous.|$|E
60|$|The widow {{sat down}} <b>and</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>her</b> damp {{hands on her}} apron, looking upon her hopeful with an {{expression}} of mingled awe and pride.|$|E
60|$|She {{had come}} running from some {{place in the}} {{neighbourhood}} and had made all the haste she could. Consequently, though she was very light, {{she was out of}} breath and could not speak at first, as she stood panting, <b>and</b> <b>wiping</b> <b>her</b> arms, <b>and</b> looking quietly at us.|$|R
60|$|Now Eric and Swanhild {{did not see}} her, and {{presently}} they parted, <b>and</b> Swanhild <b>wiped</b> <b>her</b> eyes <b>and</b> glided thence.|$|R
60|$|He reared up, {{and walked}} to her side. She put him through the steps, even {{dragging}} him round the waltz. It was very ridiculous. When it was finished she bowed him to his seat, <b>and,</b> <b>wiping</b> <b>her</b> hands on her handkerchief, because his shirt where her hand had rested on his shoulders was moist, she thanked him.|$|R
60|$|Miss Maria {{took out}} her {{handkerchief}} <b>and</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>her</b> eyes; but Miss Patty came resolutely back from the regions of sentiment to those of business.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Stobell, {{about to}} reply, caught the staring {{eye of the}} photograph, and, shaking her head sorrowfully, took out her {{handkerchief}} <b>and</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>her</b> eyes. Mrs. Chalk softened.|$|E
60|$|The Bulletin {{says that}} she took out her {{handkerchief}} <b>and</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>her</b> face with it. Elle s'essuya le front qui fut perlé de sueur. The heat had become oppressive.|$|E
6000|$|George {{drew his}} seat near the door, <b>and</b> Eliza, <b>wiping</b> <b>her</b> tears, came forward also to listen, while Simeon read as follows: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{not leave}} me," [...] she said--"do not leave me, and call no one. I {{have never been}} in this way before, and would not now," [...] she said, sitting upright, <b>and</b> <b>wiping</b> <b>her</b> eyes with her apron,--"would not now--but that--but that he loved me. if he loved nothing else that was human- -To die so, and by such hands!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know, Master Ned; I know, sir," [...] {{the woman}} said, choking down <b>her</b> sobs, <b>and</b> <b>wiping</b> <b>her</b> {{eyes with her}} apron, [...] "and I will do my best, never fear. I feel better now I have had a good cry. Somehow I wasn't able to cry before. Now, sir, {{do you go to}} the {{children}} and I will look after things." ...|$|R
6000|$|Presently {{she became}} still. [...] "Oh, well," [...] she said, <b>and</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>her</b> eyes {{and sat down}} on the little sofa by the fire; and I sat down beside her.|$|E
6000|$|... "This afternoon? Why I'm {{perfectly}} strong; it's merely {{my nerves}} that are gone." [...] She sat up, <b>and</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>her</b> eyes. [...] "But Basil! If you're {{doing this for}} me--" ...|$|E
60|$|Eliza {{took out}} her {{handkerchief}} <b>and</b> <b>wiped</b> <b>her</b> eyes with it. Then she put it back again in her pocket and gazed into the empty grate for some time without speaking.|$|E
6000|$|Tom wetted {{the end of}} a towel <b>and</b> began <b>wiping</b> <b>her</b> face, grimy {{with blood}} and tears. She let him do it, just moaning amid her sobs: ...|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, {{posing as}} Colonel Masters, a new customer, the Master takes over Farrel Auto{{plastics}}, a nearby plastics factory, to build Autons. Jo, investigating the factory, is {{discovered by the}} Master, who hypnotises <b>her</b> <b>and</b> <b>wipes</b> <b>her</b> memory of their meeting. He sends her back to UNIT with a booby-trap, a box ostensibly containing the stolen energy unit. The Doctor realises she has been hypnotised and disposes of the bomb.|$|R
6000|$|They {{were quite}} {{screened}} from the market-square without, {{and he could}} not help putting out his arm towards her waist. His momentary desire was the means of her rallying. [...] "No, no!" [...] she said, drawing back stringently, <b>and</b> <b>wiping</b> <b>her</b> eyes. [...] "Of course not! It would be hypocrisy to pretend that it would be meant as from my cousin; and it can't be in any other way." ...|$|R
