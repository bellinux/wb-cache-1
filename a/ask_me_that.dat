500|$|In an {{interview}} in the January 2008 Issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly, Street Fighter IV producer Yoshinori Ono stated [...] "Let's just say that [...] that your magazine have reported in the past might {{find their way into}} the game as fan service." [...] Executive editor Shane Bettenhausen took this to mean the appearance of Sheng Long in Street Fighter IV, though added that if the character did appear in the game, it would be Gouken. When asked in a later interview by 1UP.com regarding the possibility of Sheng Long's appearance in the title, Ono replied [...] "Are you coming to the Tokyo Game Show? How about you <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> question again then." [...] Capcom later revealed Gouken as a character in Street Fighter IV, with Ono stating in {{an interview}} with Play magazine that his inclusion in the title was in response to fans requesting Sheng Long's presence in the game.|$|E
60|$|Don't <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> Violet. You know I {{love you}} {{with all my}} heart.|$|E
60|$|COKESON. Your lordship mustn't <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> or I {{shall have}} to tell you what I was told--and that'd never do.|$|E
60|$|My uncle <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{question}} as we alighted from the train.|$|R
6000|$|... "O, {{just the}} same, Mr. Michael, {{just the way}} he'll be till the end, worthy man!" [...] was the reply. [...] "But ye'll {{not be the first}} <b>that's</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> the day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! Madame," [...] he said, [...] "there {{have been}} so many people lately who have been <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> question, yet to you as to them I must return the same answer. She is my niece!" ...|$|R
60|$|Aca. Why {{should you}} <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that?</b> Those must be mine, though I have such excess; Divided griefs increase, and not grow less.|$|E
6000|$|Jimmy Skunk {{shrugged his}} shoulders. [...] "Don't <b>ask</b> <b>me.</b> <b>That</b> {{is one of}} Old Mother Nature's secrets; you'll have to ask her," [...] he replied.|$|E
6000|$|... "About--er--two years," [...] stammered Job Haskers. He looked keenly at Mr. Fordham {{and then}} at Mr. Passmore. [...] "What--er--why do you <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> question?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Una," [...] she {{answered}} very gravely, {{in a low}} strange tone, [...] "oh, don't <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> about <b>that,</b> dear. Don't <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> about <b>that.</b> You could never understand it.... I got them... in climbing over a high stone wall... a high stone wall, with bits of glass stuck on top of it." ...|$|R
50|$|Namitha: I didn’t have Namitha in my {{mind for}} that character. I tried many new faces. Namitha <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> she want to {{re-enter}} Telugu films with Billa. She slimmed down for this role {{and we had a}} photo shoot before signing her.|$|R
60|$|Jone laughed, and <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> if <b>that</b> {{was the way}} I showed people I liked them.|$|R
6000|$|... "What," [...] exclaimed Mr. Flint, [...] "you <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> question? You, my own daughter, {{about people}} who are trying to make me out a rascal!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why didn't you <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{at first}} simply, without {{speaking}} of the girl?" [...] said Osmond. [...] "You could have had her there at any rate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'But, my dear Dorothy,' Mr. Singleton said, 'why {{on earth}} do you <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> question? Surely you cannot wish me to mention {{anything}} about that trifling affair.' ...|$|E
30|$|There was one {{question}} <b>that</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> how I {{felt about the}} way I was communicating with my wife while I was caring for her. And I don’t think anybody’s ever <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> before. And generally, there is different emotions when you’re caring for things, depending on what physical state she’s in at the moment or what’s been happening prior in the day. Yeah, so I don’t think anybody has ever <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> a question about that before.|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{your mother}} had <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> question," [...] she {{retorted}} with spirit, [...] "I {{should have told}} her that he was the man who got me safely out of the theatre after you...." [...] She checked herself. She did not want to say the unforgivable thing. [...] "You see," [...] she said more quietly, [...] "you had disappeared...." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2014, {{there were}} reports in the media that Runtown wrote [...] "Aye". In an {{interview}} with the Nigerian Tribune, Runtown said, [...] "A {{lot of people have been}} <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> question. Davido has had a number of interviews where he addressed how the song came about. So if you want to learn more about Aye ask David or read his interviews".|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{that was}} a more daring shot, though I {{have no doubt that}} I was right. You must not <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> at the present state of the affair." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{think you}} <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> only {{to change the}} subject,' he said. 'I don't believe that ever in your life you have been {{unconscious}} {{of what you have}} done with your keys.' ...|$|E
60|$|Doctor Crocus {{makes no}} verbal answer, but {{gives me an}} imploring look, which says so plainly 'Will you <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> again, a little louder, if you please?' that I repeat the question.|$|E
6000|$|... "Had you <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{question}} {{a short time}} since," [...] replied Hollingsworth, after a pause, during which, it seemed to me, even the birch-trees held their whispering breath, [...] "I should have told you--'No!' My feelings for Priscilla differed little from those of an elder brother, watching tenderly over the gentle sister whom God has given him to protect." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you had <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{question}} this morning, Vincent," [...] replied Mrs. Agnes Parsons Jopp, [...] "I {{should have been}} obliged to say that I felt far from well. I had an odd throbbing feeling in the left elbow, and I am sure my temperature was above the normal. But this afternoon I am a little better. How are you, Vincent?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you had <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{question}} {{two years}} ago--even a year ago--I {{should have given}} you a different answer. It's taken me some time to learn it, too, you see, and I'm not a man. I once thought I should {{have liked to have}} been a king amongst money changers, and own railroad and steamship lines, and dominate men by sheer power." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You surely do {{not need}} to <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> question," [...] Tavernake answered, fervently. [...] "I should believe your word, {{whatever}} you told me. I should not believe that you could do anything wrong." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no, {{he did not}} <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that.</b> He {{asked of}} little things that {{happened}} at the time; but from his manner I am sure he knows it all. He says--that I shall escape." ...|$|E
60|$|AUGUSTA. You <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that?</b> I {{try hard}} to give you credit, Jonathan, for not knowing {{the ways of the}} world--but it's always been {{difficult}} to believe that Minnie Farrell had become well--a bad woman.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here," [...] he said, with an {{assumption}} of good nature, [...] "there's {{no reason why}} you and I should quarrel. I {{want to know who}} put you up to <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> question. It isn't that I want to do him any harm. I'll guarantee his safety, if you like, so far as I am concerned. Only I'm anxious to meet him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't <b>ask</b> <b>me.</b> Not <b>that</b> I mind telling you;--furniture, and {{the lease}} of a house, and his {{bill for the}} {{marriage}} settlement,--d---- him." ...|$|R
5000|$|For my part, {{the moment}} I {{sat down with}} Stein (with Mathis there) and he <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{question}} about firing people for expressing dissenting views a dozen times, I realized that I was being manipulated to give certain answers {{they were looking for}} me to give. I asked them both, several times, if they had anything else to <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> about evolutionary theory or Intelligent Design. In frustration I finally said something like [...] "Do you have any other questions to <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> or do you keep <b>asking</b> <b>me</b> this question in hopes that I'll give a different answer?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{unnecessary}} {{for you to}} <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that,</b> sir," [...] I answered quietly. [...] "Colonel Ray will doubtless have some explanation. He {{is a man of}} vigorous temper, and I fancy that Lord Blenavon was not quite himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|Whereat {{he replied}} {{in a tone}} of surprise, though perhaps not of ill humor: [...] "What you <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that</b> {{question}} for? Suppose I stretch 'em, you see 'em. May be your way talking, may be all right, no Indian way." ...|$|E
60|$|WIRTHIN. N-not very well; I {{was afraid}} you would <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> <b>that.</b> You see, they hate it, they don't take the least {{interest}} in it, and there isn't anything to incite {{them to an}} interest, you see. And so they can't talk at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "One flower only. It is not mine. A {{friend in}} Africa <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> to--well, <b>that</b> {{is a long}} story which might not {{interest}} you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you <b>ask</b> <b>me</b> in <b>that</b> way,--yes," [...] {{answered}} the painter. [...] "But I advise you nothing. I could not counsel another {{in such a}} case." ...|$|R
60|$|Umbelazi noted her at once, and, ceasing his {{political}} talk, {{of which he}} was obviously tired, <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> who <b>that</b> beautiful intombi (that is, girl) might be.|$|R
