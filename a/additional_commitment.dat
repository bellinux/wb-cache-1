5|$|Al Anbar, {{the only}} Sunni-dominated {{province}} in Iraq, saw little {{fighting in the}} initial invasion. Following the fall of Baghdad it was occupied by the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborne Division. Violence began on 28 April 2003 when 17 Iraqis were killed in Fallujah by U.S. soldiers during an anti-American demonstration. In early 2004 the U.S. Army relinquished command of the province to the Marines. By April 2004 the province was in full-scale revolt. Savage fighting occurred in both Fallujah and Ramadi {{by the end of}} 2004, including the Second Battle of Fallujah. Violence escalated throughout 2005 and 2006 as the two sides struggled to secure the Western Euphrates River Valley. During this time, Al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) became the province's main Sunni insurgent group and turned the provincial capital of Ramadi into its stronghold. The Marine Corps issued an intelligence report in late 2006 declaring that the province would be lost without a significant <b>additional</b> <b>commitment</b> of troops.|$|E

40|$|Scheduling <b>additional</b> <b>commitments</b> for {{policies}} affecting {{trade in}} goods in the GATT {{has been plagued by}} two sources of ambiguity: the treatment of changes introduced unilaterally by members subsequent to an initial commitment, and the treatment of new commitments by WTO members pertaining to nontariff policy measures affecting {{trade in goods}}. This is not the case for trade in services, as the GATS makes explicit provision for <b>additional</b> <b>commitments</b> to be scheduled. Neither secondary law, in the form of decisions formally adopted by the WTO membership, nor case law has clarified the situation for trade in goods. This matter is important for the WTO as it determines the feasibility of clubs of countries agreeing to new enforceable policy disciplines that bind only signatories but are applied on a non-discriminatory basis to all WTO members. In this paper, we discuss the legal state of play and the 'policy space' that WTO members have to establish new MFN club-based disciplines for nontariff measures...|$|R

50|$|The {{incurred}} service {{obligation is}} generally one-for-one for every service-paid year of schooling, {{with a minimum}} of two years for physicians and three years for other specialties. Additional time required for certain postgraduate programs, such as lengthy residencies, can result in longer service obligations. Fulfillment of the obligation begins only after postgraduate training is completed. For Navy officers, time spent as a GMO is credited towards the service obligation. However, physicians that serve time as a GMO or flight surgeon prior to residency (after internship) will incur <b>additional</b> <b>commitment</b> of one-for-one if they complete subsequent residency training. This usually results in a longer service commitment than if they entered residency directly (example: 4 year medical commitment - 3 year GMO tour + 4-year residency = 7 year total commitment versus only 4 years if residency was entered directly). It {{is important to note that}} longer initial commitments have a significant negative financial impact; medical officers may take certain multi-year bonuses (which may equal up to 40% of total pay) which will run consecutive with initial residency and certain other commitments, resulting in substantial lost income if residency commitment payback is delayed due to GMO/flight medicine tour or sponsored fellowship/residency.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} EUREKA, aproblem-solving {{architecture that}} operates under strong constraints on its memory and processes. Most significantly, EUREKA does not assume {{free access to}} its entire long-term memory. That is, failures in problem solving may arise not only from missing knowledge, but from the (possibly temporary) inability to retrieve appropriate existing knowledge from memory. Additionally, the architecture does not include systematic backtracking to recover from fruitless search paths. These constraints significantly impact EUREKA’s design. Humans are also subject to such constraints, but are able to overcome them to solve problems effectively. In EUREKA’s design, we have attempted to minimize the number of <b>additional</b> architectural <b>commitments,</b> while staying faithful to the memory constraints. Even under such minimal commitments, EUREKA provides a qualitative account of the primary types of learning {{reported in the literature}} on human problem solving. Further commitments to the architecture would refine the details in the model, but the approach we have taken de-emphasizes highly detailed modeling to get at general root causes of the observed regularities. Making minimal <b>additional</b> <b>commitments</b> to EUREKA’s design strengthens the case that many regularities in human learning and problem solving are entailments of the need to handle imperfect memory...|$|R

The -300ER, which combined the -300's added capacity with the -200ER's range, became the top-selling 777 variant in the late 2000s, benefitting as airlines replaced comparable four-engine models with twinjets for their lower operating costs.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—People-driven service engagements involve {{communication}} over channels such as chat and email.

Doing so provides a grounding for the communications and yields a business-level accounting of the progress of a service engagement. Existing work on commitment-based service engagements is limited to designtime model creation and verification. In contrast, we present a novel approach for capturing commitment-based engagements that are created dynamically in conversations. We monitor commitments identifying their creation, delegation, completion, or cancellation in the conversations. We have developed a prototype and evaluated it on real-world chat and email datasets. Our prototype captures commitments with a high F-measure of 90 % in emails (Enron email corpus) and 80 % in chats (HP IT support chat dataset) and provides promising results for capturing <b>additional</b> <b>commitment</b> operations.
