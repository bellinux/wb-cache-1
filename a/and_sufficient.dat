5|$|Subdivision rules give a {{sequence}} of tilings of a surface, and tilings give an idea of distance, length, and area (by letting each tile have length and area 1). In the limit, the distances that come from these tilings may converge in some sense to an analytic structure on the surface.

It was raised from the Savska military district, and was a very large and unwieldy formation which was almost entirely reliant on animal transport for mobility. Largely manned by Croat troops, many of whom saw the Germans as potential liberators from Serbian oppression during the interwar period, the division also lacked modern arms <b>and</b> <b>sufficient</b> ammunition.|$|E
