40|$|Enterovirus 71 (EV 71) causes {{life-threatening}} epidemics in Asia {{and can be}} phylogenetically {{classified into}} three major genogroups (A ∼ C) including 11 genotypes (A, B 1 ∼ B 5, and C 1 ∼ C 5). Recently, EV 71 epidemics occurred cyclically in Taiwan with different genotypes. In recent years, human studies using post-infection sera obtained from children have detected <b>antigenic</b> <b>variations</b> among different EV 71 strains. Therefore, surveillance of enterovirus 71 should include phylogenetic and antigenic analysis. Due to limitation of sera available from children with EV 71 primary infection, suitable animal models should be developed to generate a panel of antisera for monitoring EV 71 <b>antigenic</b> <b>variations.</b> Twelve reference strains representing the 11 EV 71 genotypes were grown in rhabdomyosarcoma cells. Infectious EV 71 particles were purified and collected to immunize rabbits. The rabbit antisera were then employed to measure neutralizing antibody titers against the 12 reference strains and 5 recent strains. Rabbits immunized with genogroup B and C viruses consistently have a lower neutralizing antibody titers against genogroup A (≧ 8 -fold difference) and <b>antigenic</b> <b>variations</b> between genogroup B and C viruses can be detected but {{did not have a}} clear pattern, which are consistent with previous human studies. Comparison between human and rabbit neutralizing antibody profiles, the results showed that ≧ 8 -fold difference in rabbit cross-reactive antibody ratios could be used to screen EV 71 isolates for identifying potential antigenic variants.

500|$|The {{mechanisms}} used {{to evade}} the adaptive immune system are more complicated. The simplest approach is to rapidly change non-essential epitopes (amino acids and/or sugars) {{on the surface of}} the pathogen, while keeping essential epitopes concealed. This is called <b>antigenic</b> <b>variation.</b> An example is HIV, which mutates rapidly, so the proteins on its viral envelope that are essential for entry into its host target cell are constantly changing. These frequent changes in antigens may explain the failures of vaccines directed at this virus. The parasite Trypanosoma brucei uses a similar strategy, constantly switching one type of surface protein for another, allowing it to stay one step ahead of the antibody response. Masking antigens with host molecules is another common strategy for avoiding detection by the immune system. In HIV, the envelope that covers the virion is formed from the outermost membrane of the host cell; such [...] "self-cloaked" [...] viruses make it difficult for the immune system to identify them as [...] "non-self" [...] structures.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recently, {{enterovirus}} 71 (EV 71) {{has caused}} life-threatening outbreaks involving neurological and cardiopulmonary complications in Asian children with unknown mechanism. EV 71 has one single serotype {{but can be}} phylogenetically classified into 3 main genogroups (A, B and C) and 11 genotypes (A, B 1 ∼B 5 and C 1 ∼C 5). In Taiwan, nationwide EV 71 epidemics with different predominant genotypes occurred in 1998 (C 2), 2000 - 2001 (B 4), 2004 - 2005 (C 4), and 2008 (B 5). In this study, sera were collected to measure cross-reactive neutralizing antibody titers against different genotypes. METHODS: We collected historical sera from children who developed an EV 71 infection in 1998, 2000, 2005, 2008, or 2010 and measured cross-reactive neutralizing antibody titers against all 11 EV 71 genotypes. In addition, we aligned and compared the amino acid sequences of P 1 proteins of the tested viruses. RESULTS: Serology data showed that children infected with genogroups B and C consistently have lower neutralizing antibody titers against genogroup A (> 4 -fold difference). The sequence comparisons revealed that five amino acid signatures (N 143 D in VP 2; K 18 R, H 116 Y, D 167 E, and S 275 A in VP 1) are specific for genogroup A and {{may be related to}} the observed <b>antigenic</b> <b>variations.</b> CONCLUSIONS: This study documented <b>antigenic</b> <b>variations</b> among different EV 71 genogroups and identified potential immunodominant amino acid positions.

S. vaccine strain (MLV) and the European prototype strain from Lelystad (LV). Nucleotide sequence analyses of the open reading frame (ORF) 5 genes showed that all of the isolates studied were heterogenous, amino acid (aa) identities varied from 88 to 99 % with the MLV strain, and between 51 and 54 % with the LV strain. The aa substitutions were randomly scattered across the protein, although one region between residues 26 and 39 was found to correspond to a hypervariable region which involved 0 to 3 potential N-glycosylation sites. The ORF 5 encoded products of 5 of these isolates, including the MLV and LV strains, were expressed in E. coli as recombinant proteins fused to the glutathione S-transferase (GST) protein and used to raise hyperimmune anti-ORF 5 sera in rabbits.

Here, we investigated the IgG immune response to T. phagedenis-like isolates by Western blotting with different sera using whole-cell lysates and extracted glycolipid from 18 and 8 isolates, respectively, including those from different cattle on the same or different farms, isolates from different lesions affecting a single cow, and different isolates from the same lesion affecting a single cow. The reactivity of sera in Western blot assays revealed different banding patterns or showed no bands, suggesting that considerable <b>antigenic</b> <b>variations,</b> including glycolipid, may exist among the isolates, even in those from single individuals.

The results obtained were as follows. (i) Although {{the majority of}} T-cell clones directed against HHV- 6 proliferated in response to stimulation with all strains of HHV- 6 used (U 1102, Z 29, SF, and HST), 7 % (8 of 122) of the T-cell clones showed distinct patterns of proliferative response against strain U 1102 (group A) and other strains of HHV- 6 (group B). (ii) Of 99 T-cell clones, 71 showed a distinct proliferative response to HHV- 6 and HHV- 7, whereas 28 proliferated in response to stimulation with both HHV- 6 and HHV- 7. (iii) A small number of T-cell clones (9 of 232) showed cross-reactivity against HHV- 6 and HCMV, and 2 of the 232 clones were reactive with HCMV {{as well as with}} HHV- 6 and HHV- 7.

5000|$|<b>Antigenic</b> <b>variation</b> {{refers to}} the {{mechanism}} by which an infectious agent such as a protozoan, bacterium or virus alters its surface proteins in order to evade a host immune response. It is related to phase variation. Immune evasion is particularly important for organisms that target long-lived hosts, repeatedly infect a single host and are easily transmittable. <b>Antigenic</b> <b>variation</b> not only enables immune evasion by the pathogen, but also allows the microbes to cause re-infection, as their antigens are no longer recognized by the host's immune system. When an organism is exposed to a particular antigen (i.e. a protein {{on the surface of}} a bacterium) an immune response is stimulated and antibodies are generated to target that specific antigen. The immune system will then [...] "remember" [...] that particular antigen, and defenses aimed at that antigen become part of the immune system’s acquired immune response. If the same pathogen tries to re-infect the same host the antibodies will act rapidly to target the pathogen for destruction. However, if the pathogen can alter its surface antigens, it can evade the host's acquired immune system. This will allow the pathogen to re-infect the host while the immune system generates new antibodies to target the newly identified antigen. <b>Antigenic</b> <b>variation</b> can occur by altering a variety of surface molecules including proteins and carbohydrates. There are many molecular mechanisms behind <b>antigenic</b> <b>variation,</b> including gene conversion, site-specific DNA inversions, hypermutation, as well as recombination of sequence cassettes. [...] In all cases, <b>antigenic</b> <b>variation</b> and phase variation result in a heterogenic phenotype of a clonal population. Individual cells either express the phase-variable protein(s) or express one of multiple antigenic forms of the protein. This form of regulation has been identified mainly, but not exclusively, {{for a wide variety of}} surface structures in pathogens and is implicated as a virulence strategy.|$|E
50|$|Subtelomeric {{transcripts}} are pseudogenes (transcribed genes producing RNA sequences not {{translated into}} protein) and gene families. In humans, they code for olfactory receptors, immunoglobulin heavy chains, and zinc-finger proteins. In other species, several parasites such as Plasmodium and Trypanosoma brucei have developed sophisticated evasion mechanisms {{to adapt to}} the hostile environment posed by the host, such as exposing variable surface antigens to escape the immune system. Genes coding for surface antigens in these organisms are located at subtelomeric regions, and it has been speculated that this preferred location facilitates gene switching and expression, and the generation of new variants. For example, the genes belonging to the var family in Plasmodium falciparum (agent of malaria) code for the PfEMP1 (Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1), a major virulence factor of erythrocytic stages, var genes are mostly localized in subtelomeric regions. <b>Antigenic</b> <b>variation</b> is orchestrated by epigenetic factors including monoallelic var transcription at separate spatial domains at the nuclear periphery (nuclear pore), differential histone marks on otherwise identical var genes, and var silencing mediated by telomeric heterochromatin. Other factors such as non-coding RNA produced in subtelomeric regions adjacent or within var genes may contribute as well to <b>antigenic</b> <b>variation.</b> In Trypanosoma brucei (agent of sleeping sickness), variable surface glycoprotein (VSG) <b>antigenic</b> <b>variation</b> is a relevant mechanism used by the parasite to evade the host immune system. VSG expression is exclusively subtelomeric and occurs either by in situ activation of a silent VSG gene or by DNA rearrangement that inserts an internal silent copy of a VSG gene into an active telomeric expression site. To contrast with Plasmodium falciparum, in Trypanosoma brucei, <b>antigenic</b> <b>variation</b> is orchestrated by epigenetic and genetic factors. In Pneumocystis jirovecii major surface glycoprotein (MSG) gene family cause <b>antigenic</b> <b>variation.</b> MSG genes are like boxes at chromosome ends and only the MSG gene at the unique locus UCS (upstream conserved sequence) is transcribed. Different MSG genes can occupy the expression site (UCS), suggesting that recombination can take a gene from a pool of silent donors and install it at the expression site, possibly via crossovers, activating transcription of a new MSG gene, and changing the surface antigen of Pneumocystis jirovecii. Switching at the expression site is probably facilitated by the subtelomeric locations of expressed and silent MSG genes. A second subtelomeric gene family, MSR, is not strictly regulated at the transcriptional level, but may contribute to phenotypic diversity. <b>Antigenic</b> <b>variation</b> in P. jirovecii is dominated by genetic regulation.|$|E
