Over the next year, complacent British commanders withdrew {{some of their}} forces even as popular resistance grew. They also ceased paying subsidies to the Ghilzais, who controlled the routes between Kabul and Peshawar. A brigade commanded by Brigadier Robert Sale was sent in October 1841 from Kabul to clear the route to India via the Khyber Pass, but faced opposition from Ghilzai tribesmen <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>and</b> was blockaded in Jalalabad, halfway to the Khyber Pass.|$|E
25|$|Durham Dynamos {{lost their}} second game in succession, having bowled first and taken nine Leicestershire Foxes wickets, while their opponents made 150 runs. Economical bowling from Dale Benkenstein, who took two for 17, made that possible, but he scored at a strike rate 22 points below the required, hitting 18 off 17 balls, while as Charl Willoughby and Jeremy Snape took wickets {{and refused to}} give him runs Gareth Breese hit 16 not out off 8 balls, and Gordon Muchall 38 not out off 30, but they couldn't carry Durham <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>and</b> they {{finished}} four runs short of victory.|$|E
25|$|After trading baskets {{early the}} US edged {{out to a}} double-digit lead in the second quarter. However the Canadians, spurred on by the home crowd cheering, fought back and tied up the game at halftime. In the third quarter, it was Canada's time to shine as they outscore the US 26–15. The lead would reach as high as 18 points. The USA would fight back, but not <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>and</b> Canada won {{the game and the}} gold-medal 81–73. It was Canada's first gold-medal in {{basketball}} in the Pan Am games. Nurse was the star for Canada with 33 points, hitting 11 of her 12 free-throw attempts in 10 of her 17 field-goal attempts including two of three three-pointers.|$|E

25|$|After an off day, the Blue Jays {{played against}} the Orioles at home. Toronto {{would win the}} first game of the series, 13–6. Tensions nearly boiled over when Jason Garcia threw behind Jose Bautista, and three pitches later, Bautista hit a home run, {{watching}} it <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>and</b> slowly rounding the bases. Between innings Bautista and Adam Jones exchanged words, and after the game Jones claimed that Garcia's pitch was unintentional. Bautista cited the previous series against Baltimore, in which reliever Darren O'Day threw behind him and he would hit a home run off O'Day in the same at-bat. Bautista would miss the following game with a right shoulder strain. Devon Travis returned to the lineup and hit a go-ahead two-run home run in the fifth inning to lead Toronto to a 4–2 victory. The Blue Jays would complete their first sweep of the season, beating Baltimore 7–6 on April 23. Drew Hutchison pitched 8 innings, taking a perfect game into the sixth inning, and became the first Toronto starter to go 8 innings in the 2015 season.|$|E

A week later he won the Brown Lad Hurdle again at Naas, leading <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>and</b> winning by six lengths when conceding more than twenty pounds to his five opponents. Seven days later he attempted to record his second win in the Morgiana Hurdle and started third favourite behind Ned Kelly who was unbeaten in seven races over hurdles including the Herald Champion Novice Hurdle, and Youlneverwalkalone who had won the Hatton's Grace Hurdle in 2000. Limestone Lad led until overtaken by Ned Kelly at the second last but rallied to regain the lead on the running and won by half a length. On 7 December, the gelding, ridden by Paul Carberry won the Hatton's Grace Hurdle for the second time, making all the running to win from Liss A Paoraigh, Ned Kelly and Bannow Bay. After the race, Michael Bowe named the Stayer's Hurdle at Cheltenham as his horse's main target but {{said that he would}} consider a run in the Champion Hurdle if the ground was soft. He ran twice more {{before the end of the}} year, winning a minor event at Navan from the Willie Mullins-trained Catch Ball and then finishing second to Bannow Bay in the Christmas Hurdle.|$|E
