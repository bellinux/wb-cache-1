5|$|Exmoor is an upland area formed almost {{exclusively}} from sedimentary rocks {{dating from the}} Devonian and early Carboniferous periods. The name of the geological period and system, 'Devonian', comes from Devon, as rocks of that age were first studied and described here. With {{the exception of a}} suite of Triassic and Jurassic age rocks forming the lower ground between Porlock and Timberscombe and from Minehead to Yarde (within Exmoor National Park but peripheral to the moor itself), all of the solid rocks of Exmoor are assigned to the Exmoor Group, which comprises a mix of gritstones, sandstones, slates, shales, limestone, siltstones and mudstones. Quartz and iron mineralisation can be detected in outcrops and subsoil. The Glenthorne area demonstrates the Trentishoe Member (formerly 'Formation') of the Hangman Sandstone Formation (formerly 'Group'). The Hangman Sandstone represents the Middle Devonian sequence of North Devon and Somerset. These unusual freshwater deposits in the Hangman Grits were mainly formed in desert conditions. As this area of Britain was not subject to glaciation, the plateau remains as a remarkably old landform. The bedrock and more recent superficial deposits are covered in part by moorland which is supported by wet, <b>acid</b> <b>soil.</b>|$|E

25|$|Asplenium ×gravesii, {{commonly}} known as Graves' spleenwort, is a rare, sterile, hybrid fern, named for Edward Willis Graves (1882–1936).

It is only found where its parent species are both present; in practice, this proves {{to be a few}} scattered sites in the Appalachian Mountains, Shawnee Hills, and Ozarks, reaching perhaps its greatest local abundance around Natural Bridge State Resort Park.

40|$|ABSTRACT- Cadmium (Cd) {{concentration}} in soil solution and its bioavailability {{is controlled by}} sorption-desorption reactions. The objective {{of this research was}} to compare Cd adsorption behavior in six calcareous and four <b>acid</b> <b>soils.</b> Soil samples were equilibrated with 0. 01 M Ca(NO 3) 2 containing 25 to 3200 mg Cd L− 1. Results showed that the tendency for adsorption was high at low Cd concentrations (0 - 400 mg L- 1), but decreased as the Cd increased (400 - 3200 mg L- 1). Among five equations evaluated, Freundlich, Langmuir, and Gunary equations best described Cd adsorption in both calcareous and <b>acid</b> <b>soils</b> as indicated by high values for coefficient of determination (R 2) and low values for standard error of estimate (SE). Stepwise regression equations between constants of the best-fitted models and soil properties revealed that cation exchange capacity (CEC) and clay content were the most important soil properties affecting Cd adsorption behavior in calcareous <b>soils,</b> whereas in <b>acid</b> <b>soils</b> Cd adsorption was mainly affected by soil pH. Constants of the best fitted models showed good correlations with pH, clay, and calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE) in combined calcareous and <b>acid</b> <b>soils.</b> Our tentative conclusion is that higher pH in calcareous soils resulted in greater negative exchange sites available for Cd sorption, therefore Cd adsorption in these soils is greater compared to that of <b>acid</b> <b>soils...</b>|$|R

500|$|Asplenium montanum, {{commonly}} known as the mountain spleenwort, is a small fern endemic to the eastern United States. It is found primarily in the Appalachian Mountains from Vermont to Alabama, with a few isolated populations in the Ozarks and in the Ohio Valley. It grows in small crevices in sandstone cliffs with highly <b>acid</b> <b>soil,</b> where it is usually the only vascular plant occupying that ecological niche. It can be recognized by its tufts of dark blue-green, highly divided leaves. The species was first described in 1810 by the botanist Carl Ludwig Willdenow. No subspecies have been described, although a discolored and highly dissected form was reported from the Shawangunk Mountains in 1974. Aspleniummontanum is a diploid member of the [...] "Appalachian Asplenium complex," [...] a group of spleenwort species and hybrids which have formed by reticulate evolution. Members of the complex descended from A.montanum are among the few other vascular plants that can tolerate its typical habitat.|$|E
500|$|Persoonia linearis {{is useful}} as a hedging plant and {{responds}} well to pruning. Its foliage {{has been used in}} floral arrangements, and its colourful bark is a horticultural feature. It is a fairly easy plant to grow in gardens, but is rarely seen due to difficulties in propagation. Germination from seed is low, and can take many months. Once established it can tolerate extended dry periods and is hardy to frosts. Optimum growing conditions are part shade and a well-drained <b>acid</b> <b>soil,</b> though P.linearis grows readily in full sun. Persoonias in general are sensitive to excessive phosphorus, and grow without fertiliser or with low-phosphorus slow-release formulations. They can also become deficient in iron and manganese. First cultivated in England in 1794 from seed, it was also reportedly propagated from cuttings; Andrews described it as a [...] "handsome greenhouse plant, continuing to flower through the autumnal months and producing good seeds." [...] Joseph Knight reported that cuttings would be successful as long as material was [...] "judiciously chosen", and that plants had set seed on occasion.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Acid</b> <b>soils</b> limit crop {{production}} on 30 — 40 % of the world's arable land {{and up to}} 70 % of the world's potentially arable land. Over 60 % of the total arable lands in Serbia are <b>acid</b> <b>soils.</b> Soil acidity is determined by hydrogen (H+) in soil solution and it is influenced by edaphic, climatic, and biological factors. Major constraints for plant growth on <b>acid</b> mineral <b>soils</b> are toxic concentrations of mineral elements like Al of H+ and/or low mineral nutrient availability due to low solubility (e. g. P and Mo) or low reserves and im-paired uptake (e. g. Mg 2 +) at high H+ concentrations. Aluminum (Al) toxicity is primary fac-tor limiting {{crop production}} on <b>acid</b> <b>soils.</b> This review examines our current understanding of mechanisms of Al-toxicity, {{as well as the}} physiological and genetic basis for Al-toxicity and tolerance. Inhibition of root growth by Al leads to more shallow root systems, which may affect the capacity for mineral nutrient acquisition and increase the risk of drought stress. Of the two principal strategies (tolerance and avoidance) of plants for adaptation to adverse soil conditions, the strategy of avoidance is more common for adaptation to <b>acid</b> mineral <b>soils.</b> At the same, the short view of the most important genetics tolerance mecha-nisms, developed and determined in some small grains genotypes, is showed as well.
