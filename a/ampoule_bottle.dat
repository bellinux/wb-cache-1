40|$|With the {{continuous}} development of computer vision technology, its application {{is more and}} more extensive. In recent years, the application of computer vision technology in the area of medical packing detection also made great achievements. This paper detailed a scientific and reasonable scheme of an <b>ampoule</b> <b>bottle</b> automatic detection equipment. In this scheme we use the computer vision technology and CNC technology, and select the appropriate transport mechanism and cameras to get images of ampoules. After getting the images, we use a software named MATLAB, which can deal with the images, to obtain some useful information about the ampoules. Then we can evaluate the quality of the ampoule according to these information...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{developing}} a novel technique based on machine vision for detection of foreign substances in injections. Mechanical control yields spin/stop movement of injections which helps to cause relative movement between foreign substances in liquid and an <b>ampoule</b> <b>bottle.</b> Foreign substances are classified into two categories: subsiding-slowly object and subsiding-fast object. A sequence of frames are captured by {{a camera and}} used to recognize foreign substances. After image preprocessing like noise reduction and motion detection, two different methods, Moving-object Clustering (MC) and Frame Difference, are proposed to detect the two categories respectively. MC is operated to cluster subsiding-slowly foreign substances, based on the invariant features of those objects. Frame Difference is defined to calculate the difference between two frames due to the change of subsiding-fast objects. 200 ampoule samples filled with injection are tested and the experimental result indicates that the approach can detect the visible foreign substances effectively...|$|E
40|$|Water shutoff and profile {{control is}} one of the most {{important}} technologies to enhance oil recovery. To ensure the success of this technology, the key is to accurately determine gelation time and gel strength during gel flow in porous media. The HPAM (Hydrolyzed PolyAcrylaMide) system and redox system (sodium bichromate and sodium sulfite) is widely used, whose static gelation time in <b>ampoule</b> <b>bottles</b> and porous media was determined, as well as the dynamic gelation time in an agitator and porous media. The shear rate was considered one of the major factors affecting gelation time. The results showed that the static gelation time in porous media was much longer than that in <b>ampoule</b> <b>bottles.</b> The Initial Gelation Time (IGT) in porous media was two or three times that in <b>ampoule</b> <b>bottles,</b> while the final gelation time in porous media was six times that in <b>ampoule</b> <b>bottles.</b> Under shearing in an agitator, the gelation process was divided into four phases: induction, sudden increase, stability and decrease. With the increase in shear rate, gelation time was prolonged and gel strength decreased. There was a critical gelation shear rate, above which there was no gel formed. Shear had almost no influence on gel strength during the induction stage but in the process of sudden increase, shear could degrade gel strength sharply. The time of dynamic gelation in porous media was much longer than that of static gelation in porous media and <b>ampoule</b> <b>bottles.</b> When HPAM and RS (Redox System) concentrations increased, the IGT of dynamic gelation in porous media was shortened...|$|R
