40|$|A {{large part}} of western Manatee County {{is devoted to the}} growing of winter {{vegetables}} and citrus fruits. As in most of peninsular Florida, rainfall in the county during the growing season is not sufficient for crop production and large quantites of artesian water are used for irrigation. The large withdrawals of artesian water for irrigation result in a considerable decline of the <b>artesian</b> <b>head</b> {{in the western part of}} the county. This seasonal decline of the <b>artesian</b> <b>head</b> has become larger as the withdrawal of artesian water has increased. The lowering of the fresh-water head in some coastal areas in the State has resulted in an infiltration of sea water into the water-bearing formations. The presence of salty water in the artesian aquifer in parts of the coastal area of Manatee County indicates that sea water may also have entered the waterbearing formations in this area as a result of the decline of artesian pressure during the growing season. The purpose of the investigation is to make a detailed study of the geology and ground-water resources of the county, primarily to determine whether salt-water encroachment has occurred or is likely to occur in the coastal area.

40|$|The Las Vegas {{ground-water}} basin {{as described}} in this report includes {{the southern part of}} Indian Spring Valley, Three Lakes Valley, the northern half of Ivanpah Valley, and Las Vegas Valley. These valleys in part are inferred to form a hydrologic unit that includes an area of about 3, 000 square miles {{in the southern part of}} Clark County, Nev. The valleys forming the Las Vegas ground-water basin are broad structural depressions surrounded by mountains. The climate of the region is arid, and precipitation in the basin lowlands rarely exceeds 5 inches per year. Drainage is interior except for occasional Hood runoff and waste from the industrial plants at Henderson; the occasional flood runoff and waste flow through the Las Vegas Wash to Lake Mead. The mountain ranges are composed of indurated rocks that impede the movement of ground water from the basin and form the boundary of the ground-water reservoir. The valley fill that forms the principal ground-water reservoir is composed of a thick sequence ranging from Miocene (?) through Recent in age. Most of the ground water is in a large leaky artesian system comprising four principal zones of aquifers—the deep, middle, and shallow zones of artesian aquifers and the near-surface zone of water-table aquifers. To facilitate quantitative analyses of recharge, discharge, and yield, the aquifers have been divided arbitrarily into an artesian system, which includes the three principal artesian aquifers, and the near-surface water-table system. Natural recharge to the artesian system is from precipitation in the mountainswithin the drainage area of the basin. As ground water moves from areas ofrecharge toward areas of discharge in the lower parts of Las Vegas Valley, itbecomes confined between relatively impermeable beds. Nearly imperviousbarriers caused by faulting of the valley fill impede the lateral movement of the ground water. Artesian pressure causes the water to leak upward along thefaults into shallow aquifers. The average annual natural recharge to the Las Vegas artesian system was estimated by the following methods: (1) Estimation of consumptive use by phreatophytes under natural conditions prior to ground-water development; (2) estimation of ground-water underflow to the Las Vegas area during a period of near-stability in the ground-water reservoir; and (3) study of the relationship between precipitation and recharge during periods of equilibrium in the ground-water reservoir. Estimates of the natural recharge based on these methods suggest that the average annual natural recharge to the basin is on the order of 25, 000 acre-feet. The total draft on the artesian aquifers in 1955 was approximately 48, 000 acre-feet, of which about 42, 000 acre-feet was from wells and springs and about 6, 000 acre-feet was from upward leakage. Therefore, overdraft on the artesian reservoir in 1955 was about 23, 000 acre-feet. Recharge to the near-surface reservoir in 1955 was derived from upward leakage from the underlying artesian aquifers and by infiltration of waste water. The total estimated recharge to the near-surface reservoir in 1955 was about 25, 000 acre-feet. The draft on the near-surface reservoir in 1955 was about 25, 000 acre-feet, of which about 24, 000 acre-feet was discharged by phreatophytes and about 1, 000 acre-feet was discharged by wells. During this study, the near-surface reservoir was in a state of approximate dynamic equilibrium. The above data indicate that the overdraft on the entire Las Vegas ground-water basin in 1955 was approximately equal to the overdraft on the artesian aquifers—that is, about 23, 000 acre-feet. As the artesian heads continue to decline in Las Vegas Valley, the quantity ofground water lost through upward leakage and subsequent transpiration willdecrease. Conditions of optimum development of the artesian system will beachieved when the artesian heads have been lowered to about 50 feet below land surface, because most of the upward leakage that is currently discharged by phreatophytes will have been eliminated. At the present rate of decline of the <b>artesian</b> <b>head</b> and with the present distribution and amount of withdrawals, the <b>artesian</b> <b>head</b> will be lowered sufficiently to prevent most natural discharge in the Las Vegas area in about 40 years and in the Paradise Valley area in about 75 years. The maximum sustained yield that can be developed from the artesian aquifers when the <b>artesian</b> <b>head</b> has been lowered below the root zone of phreatophytes will be limited to the approximate average annual natural recharge to the artesian system plus the amount of nonconsumptively used ground water and imported water which becomes available for reuse through downward leakage or artificial recharge. The accumulated annual discharge from the Las Vegas artesian aquifers hasexceeded the accumulated recharge since the development of the first successful well in 1906, and as a result the artesian pressure has declined almost uninterruptedly from year to year since that time. The <b>artesian</b> <b>head</b> in selected observation wells in the vicinity of Las Vegas and Paradise Valley declined about 30 feet between 1941 and 1956. During this time the approximate cumulative overdraft amounted to about 300, 000 acre-feet. The amount of overdraft per foot of lowering of <b>artesian</b> <b>head</b> within the area of approximately 40 square miles represented by the observation wells during this period was about 10, 000 acre-feet. The chemical quality of the ground water in Las Vegas Valley is, in general,better in the northern than in the southern part of the valley. In the northernpart of the valley, water from the shallow and middle zones of aquifers is of better quality than water in the deep zone of aquifers. As the ground water migrates southward into the Paradise Valley and the Whitney-Pittman areas, the water in the middle and shallow zones becomes more mineralized than the water in the deep zone of aquifers. The lowering of <b>artesian</b> <b>head</b> in the Las Vegas area between 1935 and 1950 has caused about 180 millimeters of local land subsidence in the vicinity of the Bonanza Street underpass, where the sediments are predominantly clay and silt. In the western part of the valley, where the sediments are predominantly sand and gravel, subsidence during the same period of time was negligible...|$|E

Because of significant hydrogeologic changes during the 1930 - 70 overdraft period, however, the ground-water basin will respond differently during a second cycle of overdraft.

50|$|Withdrawals {{from the}} Floridan aquifer system began in 1887 when the City of Savannah, Georgia, began to {{supplement}} surface water withdrawals from the Savannah River with groundwater. At that time <b>artesian</b> <b>heads</b> {{in the system}} were 40 ft above land surface and no pumps were needed; by 1898, {{it was estimated that}} between 200-300 wells had been finished in South Georgia and by 1943 about 3,500 in the six coastal counties of Georgia. By around 1910-1912, development of the Floridan aquifer system had already occurred in Fernandina and Jacksonville and south along the east coast of Florida as well as from Tampa south to Fort Myers on the west coast. Over time, the number of wells increased, as did the finished depths, as demand increased. Industrial supply for pulp and paper mills became {{a large proportion of the}} water withdrawn starting in the late 1930s. In the 1950s, all municipal, domestic, and industrial supply (except cooling) and about half of agricultural supply in Orlando, Florida, had been converted to groundwater from the Floridan aquifer system. Groundwater withdrawals from the Floridan aquifer system increased steadily from 630 Mgal/d in 1950 to 3,430 Mgal/d in 1990. Permitting and regulations enacted during the 1990s curtailed the year-on-year increases in withdrawal; however, withdrawals in 2000 increased to 4,020 Mgal/d due to extreme drought conditions between 1999 and 2001 that prevailed over much of the Southeastern United States. Much of the increase was due to increased agricultural demand.|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} wells {{penetrating}} the Floridan aquifer in eastern Clay County {{were found to}} be losing water to permeable zones above this aquifer. A differential in artesian pressure was observed in closely spaced wells of similar depth. Further investigation. revealed that the pressure differential in the wells was due to the design of the wells, of which there were four principal types. A comparison of the four types of wells in relation to the subsurface geology showed that three types of wells were open to the permeable zones above the Floridan aquifer. In such wells water of relatively high head from the Floridan aquifer moves up through the well bore and out into zones of relatively low head. The estimated water loss from poorly designed wells ranged from 32 to 180 gpm (gallons per minute). The <b>artesian</b> <b>head</b> loss in leaky wells ranged from 3 to 15 feet. A total loss of water of 39 mgd (million gallons per day) was estimated from all the leaky wells in the area. A significant decline of the piezometric surface of the Floridan aquifer was observed in eastern Clay County.

40|$|Energy {{developments}} in the Southwest have {{established a basis for}} the examination of complexities involved in environmental decision making. The coalfired generation facilities exhibit an impact potential on the social, physical, and economic surroundings of both local and distant communities. A recent seventeen-volume report directed by the U. S. Department of Interior, The Southwest Energy Study, is an indicator of the magnitude of the situation. The Four Corners Program is a team research project with emphasis placed upon technology transfer. Simulation models are used to estimate the physical, economic, and social effects of a range of decisions concerning alternate power schedules. The research results are communicated to interest groups in other than the usual report form. A workshop environment allows the participants to interact with the decisions, the models, the results, and one another. One of the simulation models is the groundwater model. The groundwater model is used to estimate head declines in the confined and unconfined portions of the Navajo Sandstone and the Mesaverde Formation on Black Mesa. The Mesaverde Formation is found to be isolated from the Navajo Sandstone by the Mancos Shale and other intervening layers. A simulation routine developed by the Illinois State Water Survey is modified and adapted to the problem. As a result of the small amount of published aquifer data, minimum or below minimum values of aquifer properties and a sensitivity analysis were incorporated into model considerations. Pumping rates and pumping durations of groundwater for slurry transfer of coal define the decision space. The mining pumpage will have a negligible effect upon the Indian wells located in recharge areas of the Navajo Sandstone. The effects of mining pumpage upon potentiometric surfaces in the artesian portion of the Navajo Sandstone will range from zero to twenty percent of the <b>artesian</b> <b>head,</b> depending upon location and aquifer properties. Theoretical effects of groundwater pumpage on four monitor locations are quantified in terms of ranges of variation. These results can help to evaluate development plans for decision makers and other interest groups. With the future acquisition of measured drawdowns, consideration of theoretical and actual results can provide additional precision to aquifer parameter estimates. The Four Corners Program has a two year duration. The goal of the first year effort was the completion of simulation modeling. Beyond technical or prejudicial hurdles, the workshop encounters will require a public relations and communications posture which is conducive to group participation. The effectiveness of simulation as a means of technology transfer to a variety of users is yet to be evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Groundwater {{withdrawal}} from underground aquifers {{in excess of}} natural recharge is causing land surface subsidence along the Texas coast. External costs of subsidence are estimated from a survey of damages and losses in property value in the Houston-Baytown area of Texas. Estimates of total costs, primarily in fresh- and saltwater flooding, are used in a break-even analysis to compare areal costs of groundwater to costs of water from surface sources. Substitution of surface water for all groundwater that results in subsidence is suggested {{as a means of}} minimizing total water costs to the area. Key words: land subsidence, externalities, cost minimization. •In the The Texas Gulf Coast is affected to an increas-ing degree by land subsidence, a term applied to compaction of subsurface strata resulting in a lowering of surface elevation. This sinking of the land surface has reached critical propor-tions in many areas and subsidence of as much as 9 feet has occurred (Gabrysch 1973). The severity of the phenomenon has been aggra-vated by the proximity of much of the affected area to bay waters. Permanent inundation of property by normal tides and temporary flood-ing during storm tides have resulted in sub-stantial damages and losses in property val-ues.

40|$|Cleanup of {{low-level}} {{radioactive wastes}} at the Wayne Interim Storage Site (WISS), Wayne, New Jersey {{during the period}} October, 2000 through November, 2001 required the design, installation and operation of a dual-aquifer dewatering system to support excavation of contaminated soils. Waste disposal pits from a former rare-earth processing facility at the WISS had {{been in contact with}} the water table aquifer, resulting in moderate levels of radionuclides being present in the upper aquifer groundwater. An uncontaminated artesian aquifer underlies the water table aquifer, and is a localized drinking water supply source. The lower aquifer, confined by a silty clay unit, is flowing artesian and exhibits potentiometric heads of up to 4. 5 meters above grade. This high potentiometric head presented a strong possibility that unloading due to excavation would result in a ''blowout'', particularly in areas where the confining unit was < 1 meter thick. Excavation of contaminated materials w as required down {{to the surface of the}} confining unit, potentially resulting in an <b>artesian</b> aquifer <b>head</b> of greater than 8 meters above the excavation surface. Consequently, it was determined that a dual-aquifer dewatering system would be required to permit excavation of contaminated material, with the water table aquifer dewatered to facilitate excavation, and the deep aquifer depressurized to prevent a ''blowout''. An additional concern was the potential for vertical migration of contamination present in the water table aquifer that could result from a vertical gradient reversal caused by excessive pumping in the confined system. With these considerations in mind, a conceptual dewatering plan was developed with three major goals: (1) dewater the water table aquifer to control radionuclide migration and allow excavation to proceed; (2) depressurize the lower, artesian aquifer to reduce the potential for a ''blowout''; and (3) develop a precise dewatering level control mechanism to insure a vertical gradient reversal did not result in cross-contamination. The plan was executed through a hydrogeologic investigation culminating with the design and implementation of a complex, multi-phased dual-aquifer dewatering system equipped with a state of the art monitoring network...|$|R

40|$|The glacier Holmstr+mbreen, in Spitsbergen, surged {{into the}} ice contact scarp of a proglacial outwash {{sequence}} at some time during its Neoglacial maximum. The outwash sediments were pushed along a decollement to produce a moraine in which deformation extended for 1. 5 km beyond the furthest extent of the glacier front. The style of folding and faulting {{and the nature of}} the pre-, syn- and post-tectonic sedimentary sequence across the whole push moraine is described from a continuously exposed section of the push moraine which extends from its proximal to distal extremities. The precise extent of incremental compressive shortening of the pushed sediments, of some 900 m, is established. The depth to the underlying decollement is inferred to be an average of about 30 m, indicating that stresses and movement were transmitted through a thin nappe with an aspect ratio of about 1 in 30. It is suggested that this nappe was frozen and that an <b>artesian</b> water pressure <b>head</b> of 60 m immediately beneath it reduced friction along its base to a very low value. It is calculated that a glacially generated force of about 1. 5] 107 kN was responsible for pushing the sediment nappe. The nature of the glacially controlled groundwater ßow system rather than the magnitude of longitudinal forces generated by the glacier is the principle determinant of large-scale push moraine characteristics.

40|$|This study {{provides}} a hydrochemical baseline survey of water-filled sinkholes at Bitter Lake Nation Wildlife Refuge (Roswell, NM). Water samples from 10 representative sinkholes taken at 1. 0 m increments were analyzed for major ions, stable isotopes [ 18 O, D], and dissolved gases. Sinkholes are surface features {{at a constant}} head boundary found at the discharge region for the Roswell Artesian Basin, recharged by upwardly flowing <b>artesian</b> springs. Constant <b>head</b> is confirmed {{by a lack of}} measured change in depth during two sampling sessions (October 2008, May 2009), low relief (< 10 m change across study area), and deployment of autonomous sensors (sondes). Sinkhole waters – regardless of depth or season – fall along a common isotopic evaporation trajectory (D = 3. 387 * 18 O – 19. 38), and adopt a Na-Cl chemical endmember facies. Driven primarily by physical sinkhole geometry (e. g., depth and surface area), sinkhole water follows a predictable evolutionary progression from a spring-like well-mixed (“young”), to moderately saline well-mixed (“transitional”), to saline and stratified (“old” or “evolved”), based on the relative volume of water that has entered and subsequently been evaporated from the system. The modality of water column structure may be predicted by measuring the density, TDS or conductivity at sinkhole surface, as these parameters {{can be used as a}} proxy for evolutionary “age. ” Simple geochemical models reveal calcium- and sulfate-bearing minerals (calcite, gypsum) precipitate early in the reaction while halite and magnesium-containing minerals precipitate late, yielding increased Cl- and Mg+ concentrations in fluids subjected to prolonged evaporation. More complicated models are needed to fully consider precipitation of additional mineral species and water budget. Both PO 4 and NH 4 were present in biologically-significant concentrations in sinkholes with chemically controlled water columns, and photosynthetic bacteria were found to organize at the bottom of the photic zone. High NH 4 and CO 2 accompanying low O 2 dissolved gas values confirm the increased biological control in stratified sinkholes. Resident fish populations are affected by water chemistry which reduces reproductive success or exceed the survivable range of habitable conditions. Results of this study may be used to aid with biological resource management and to predict stratified conditions using measurable proxies.

40|$|The city of Boise relies {{upon the}} {{underlying}} groundwater resource for 90 {{percent of its}} public water-supply. The cold-water aquifers are saturated sedimentary deposits of rivers and lakes that existed 9 -to- 2 million years ago. The basin-fill sediments which comprise this system of aquifers are divisible into five distinct hydrogeologic settings which differ {{on the basis of}} sediment type, geophysical log character, and hydraulic properties. A large buried alluvial-fan/fan-delta complex (the Boise Fan) occupies the head of the basin. Erratic and spiky signatures of natural gamma and electrical resistivity logs are typical of these thinly bedded and complexly intercalated sand, gravel, and silty mud deposits. Color is characteristically the yellowish brown of oxidized iron; reflecting the subaerial depositional environment of an alluvial fan. Down-valley gradations in sediment type show a general increase in unit thickness (smoother and more gradual deflections of geophysical log-response), and sediment color more typically gray; reflecting transition to the lake environment of deposition. Basinward, the ancient fan materials grade into lake/fan transitional sediments which grade to predominantly lake sediments which grade to gray mudstones and fine sand layers of the deep lake environment These translate into hydrogeologic settings respectively named: the Lake-to-Fan Transition, Central Boise Lacustrine Aquifers, and the Deep Artesian Lacustrine Sands of West Boise. A fifth setting are the Lake Margin Sands comprised of a wedge-shaped sand 2 ̆ 2 sheet 2 ̆ 2 of fluvial and lake margin sediments which thin away from the mountain front and may be separated from the other hydrogeologic settings by an erosional unconformity located 400 -to- 600 feet below the present day surface. Specific capacities of efficient wells open to 80 -to- 100 feet of sand are highest in the Lake-to-Fan Transition and the Central Boise Lacustrine Aquifers (25 -to- 40 gallons per minute per foot (gpm/ft), lowest for the Boise Fan (8 -to- 15 gpm/ft), and intermediate for the Deep Artesian Sand Aquifers of West Boise (15 -to- 20 gpm/ft) within the Boise Fan aquifer. As a result of screen and filter-pack design based upon careful attention to sampling drill cuttings, sieve analysis of sands, and geophysical log location of aquifers, efficiency and productivity of new wells has been greatly increased. For example, recent wells in the Boise Fan setting, completed with carefully placed screen and filter-packs, have resulted in production wells near sites where previous wells were considered unsuccessful. The degree to which the waters of the Boise aquifers are confined generally increases down-valley. Piezometric levels, inferred from static water-levels of wells, in east Boise change very little as wells are deepened and often the static levels decline slightly with depth. In west Boise the static levels in wells rise significantly as wells are deepened, and many are flowing <b>artesian</b> wells with <b>heads</b> up to 10 feet above surface. Sub-surface mapping of aquifer units and overlapping hydraulic well-test data suggest that hydraulic continuity exists across the system. Below east Boise, this hydraulic interconnection is most direct and inter-aquifer leakage is measurable over pumping periods of hours-to-several days. The subsurface of west Boise has the greatest degree of separation between aquifer units and leakage is more difficult to measure. The system of semi-confined and unconfined cold-water aquifers beneath Boise has boundaries related to lateral changes in the types and occurrence of lake and river sediments, and to crustal faulting. Interbedded sand, silt, and claystone of the upper Miocene and early Pliocene Idaho Group are the primary water-yielding strata. Production is mostly from the upper 500 feet in east and north-central Boise, and from as deep as 900 feet in south, west, and southeast Boise. The depths to which drinking-water aquifers extend is limited by an underlying sequence of relatively impermeable volcanic rocks identified by seismic exploration and deep-well data. In addition, a boundary to the available 2 ̆ 2 cold 2 ̆ 2 (less than 85 degrees F) water aquifers of the Boise area is defined by state law as the 85 -degree isotherm. Water from deep wells may have temperatures in excess of 85 degrees F, and appropriation of this 2 ̆ 2 low-temperature geothermal 2 ̆ 2 groundwater is currently restricted by the Idaho Code. Increasingly, we are discovering instances of local contamination of the surface-gravel aquifer. The present floodplain of the Boise River and the flight of river-terrace benches south of the river are mantled by a 2 ̆ 2 sheet 2 ̆ 2 of river gravels 30 -to- 100 feet thick. Groundwater recharge to the deeper aquifers is via these porous and permeable, saturated surface gravels. Increased groundwater withdrawals, commensurate with population growth, have possibly accelerated recharge (and so too, the downward movement of surface pollutants) by increasing vertical hydraulic gradients. Overbored wells with continuous surface-to-depth gravel packs, wells open to multiple aquifers, and improperly abandoned wells with deteriorating casing are also conduits for polluted shallow groundwater to enter the deeper aquifers. It is recommended that filter-packs be separated with bentonite-based seals within the formation/casing annulus and that surface casing be sealed by being driven into a low-permeability unit. Continued urbanization of flood-irrigated agricultural land and lining/sealing of the larger canals is beginning to cause a decrease in the amount of water available as replenishment to the groundwater reservoirs. Reduction of recharge, coupled with increased pumpage will result in lowered water-levels in wells. Water-levels in wells of the east Boise area are presently in decline and have lowered, on average, over 40 -feet during the last 20 years. A possible remedy to declining water-levels in the upper basin is artificial recharge to the Boise Fan aquifer...|$|R
