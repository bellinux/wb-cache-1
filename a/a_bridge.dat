5|$|The close {{distance}} between Mill Point and Point Lewis {{at the foot}} of Mount Eliza meant the site was suggested as a suitable location for <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> as early as 1849. <b>A</b> <b>bridge</b> was proposed for the site in 1899, but its expected cost of £13,000 was deemed too high. Preliminary planning for <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> at the site finally began in 1947, but was suspended so that a replacement, The Causeway, could be built at Heirisson Island, at the city's eastern end. The new Causeway bridges were opened in 1952, and by 1954 traffic using them to enter the city had doubled, renewing calls for <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> at The Narrows.|$|E

5|$|Another {{person who}} {{took up the}} {{initiative}} in the late 1950s was Rangvald Iversen, who was plant manager at Norwegian Talc at Knarrevik. The plant had large costs freighting their products across the sound on the Alvøy–Brattholmen Ferry. In 1958, he took the initiative to conduct a traffic count, which along with estimates of increased traffic from other places that had replaced a ferry with <b>a</b> <b>bridge,</b> would give estimates for the revenue from tolls. Norwegian Talc also paid for a draft plan for <b>a</b> <b>bridge.</b> In 1959, Iversen presented an estimate that <b>a</b> <b>bridge</b> would cost NOK15.5 million, and on 19 December 1959, the council voted unanimously to recommend that a committee be established to continue work on the bridge plans. In 1960, the bridge {{was included in the}} road plan for Hordaland.|$|E
