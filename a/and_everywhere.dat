5|$|Portland had {{strongly}} desired Washington, {{and their}} general manager Stu Inman, {{was a close}} friend of Pete Newell's. Inman had worked hard through Newell to let Washington know that they intended this to be the last time he was traded. This was important as the media coverage and re-locations had been hard on Pat and the children. To his great relief, the city of Portland welcomed Washington with open arms. Portland had one of the more rabid fan bases in the league, <b>and</b> <b>everywhere</b> Washington went he was treated like a beloved celebrity.|$|E
5|$|The Liverpool and Manchester Railway {{had opened}} the {{previous}} year, and proved a remarkable success in abstracting traffic from the parallel canal, and indicated that longer distances, not merely feeders to a harbour or from a colliery, could be dealt with, <b>and</b> <b>everywhere</b> business people were considering where a railway might advantageously be built next. When the Grand Junction Railway was authorised in 1833, {{it was possible to}} consider that railways might one day link central Scotland and the south of England.|$|E

5|$|Dragon Ball Z: Attack of the Saiyans, {{known in}} Japan as Dragon Ball Kai: Saiyan Invasion, is {{a video game}} based on the manga and anime series Dragon Ball for the Nintendo DS. The game is {{developed}} by Monolith Soft and distributed by Namco Bandai in North America <b>and</b> <b>everywhere</b> else under the Bandai label. It was released in Japan on April 29, 2009. The game was released in Europe and North America in November 2009. The game was originally planned to use the Z moniker, despite starting with events that occur in Dragon Ball, but was changed to Kai to associate it with the Dragon Ball Kai revision.|$|E
5|$|Filmmakers {{also made}} feature-length documentaries {{that covered the}} dark {{recesses}} of the globe, including the Amazon rainforest, Native American settlements, the Pacific islands, <b>and</b> <b>everywhere</b> in between. Taking advantage of audiences' voyeuristic impulses, aided by the allowance of nudity in tribal documentaries, the filming of lands untouched by modernity, and the presentation of locales never before filmed, these movies placated Depression era American audiences by showing them lifestyles more difficult than their own. Also captured were Arctic expeditions in films such 90° South and With Byrd at the South Pole, and Sub-Saharan Africa in the safari films of Martin and Osa Johnson, among others.|$|E

25|$|Before the 16th century, pepper {{was being}} grown in Java, Sunda, Sumatra, Madagascar, Malaysia, <b>and</b> <b>everywhere</b> in Southeast Asia. These areas traded mainly with China, or used the pepper locally. Ports in the Malabar area {{also served as}} a {{stop-off}} point for much of the trade in other spices from farther east in the Indian Ocean. Following the British hegemony in India, virtually all of the black pepper found in Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa was traded from Malabar region.|$|E
25|$|Antislavery as a {{principle}} {{was far more}} than just the wish to limit the extent of slavery. Most Northerners recognized that slavery existed in the South and the Constitution did not allow the federal government to intervene there. Most Northerners favored a policy of gradual and compensated emancipation. After 1849, abolitionists rejected this and demanded that slavery end immediately <b>and</b> <b>everywhere.</b> John Brown was the only abolitionist known to have actually planned a violent insurrection, though David Walker promoted the idea. The abolitionist movement was strengthened by the activities of free African-Americans, especially in the black church, who argued that the old Biblical justifications for slavery contradicted the New Testament.|$|E
25|$|Granting no {{concession}} to his precarious legal situation, Socrates speaks emotionally and provocatively to the court, {{and says that}} the greatest good to occur upon Athens is his moral concern for them as fellow citizens. That material wealth {{is a consequence of}} goodness; that the god does not permit a better man to be harmed by a lesser man; and that he is the social gadfly required by Athens: “All day long, I will never cease to settle here, there, <b>and</b> <b>everywhere</b> — rousing, persuading, and reproving every one of you.” In support of the moral mission assigned him by the Oracle at Delphi, Socrates tells the court that his daimonion continually forbids him to act unethically. That statement implicitly validates Meletus' accusation that Socrates believes in novel deities not of the Athenian pantheon.|$|E

25|$|Leaving the {{hospital}} in May 1893 {{he went to the}} Far East, and in February 1894 began a journey from Shanghai to Rangoon. He went partly by boat up the Yangtze River and rode and walked the remainder of the 3,000 miles (4,800km). He completed the journey in 100 days at a total cost of £18, which included the wages of two or three Chinese servants whom he picked up and changed on the way as he entered new districts. He was quite unarmed and then knew hardly more than a dozen words of Chinese. But he was willing to conform to and respect the customs of the people he met, <b>and</b> <b>everywhere</b> was received with courtesy. In his interesting account of his journey, An Australian in China, published in 1895, while speaking well of the personalities of the many missionaries he met, he consistently belittled their success in obtaining converts. In after years he regretted this, as he felt he had given a wrong impression by not sufficiently stressing the value of their social and medical work.|$|E
25|$|In 305 BC the consuls {{were sent}} to Samnium. Lucius Postumius Megellus marched on Tifernum and Titus Minucius Augurinus on Bovianum. There was a battle at Tifernum where some of Livy's sources say that Postumius was defeated, while others say that the battle was even and he withdrew to the {{mountains}} at night. The Samnites followed him and encamped near him. Livy said {{that he seemed to}} have wanted to gain a position where he could get abundant supplies. Postumius then left a garrison at this camp and marched to his colleague who was also encamped facing the enemy. He instigated Titus Minucius to give battle, which dragged on until the late afternoon. Then Postumius joined in and the Samnites were slaughtered. The next day the consuls begun the siege of Bovianum, which fell quickly. In 304 BC the Samnites sent envoys to Rome to negotiate a peace. The suspicious Romans sent the consul Publius Sempronius Sophus to Samnium with an army to investigate the true intentions of the Samnites. He travelled all over Samnium <b>and</b> <b>everywhere</b> he found peaceable people who gave him supplies. Livy said that the ancient treaty with the Samnites was restored. He did not specify what the terms were.|$|E
500|$|Shaivism {{is one of}} {{the four}} major sects of Hinduism, the others being Vaishnavism, Shaktism and the Smarta Tradition. Followers of Shaivism, called [...] "Shaivas", revere Shiva as the Supreme Being.

He is not only the creator in Shaivism, he is the {{creation}} that results from him, he is everything <b>and</b> <b>everywhere.</b> Shiva is the primal soul, the pure consciousness and Absolute Reality in the Shaiva traditions.|$|E

500|$|Jones's role as Hitchcock {{required}} him to spend four hours each day being made up with prosthetic makeup and a fatsuit, and he did daily twenty-minute vocal exercises to imitate Hitchcock's distinctive speech. In a December 2012 interview with The Scotsman, Jones said [...] " [...] voice was so beautiful. There's something in the rhythm and roll of it that {{is connected to the}} way Hitchcock thinks and moves. Then there is everything he ingestedthe cigar smoking and drinking that's imprinted on his voice. <b>And</b> <b>everywhere</b> he lived; you can hear cockney London, California, and a plummy received pronunciation in that voice".|$|E
500|$|As a {{composer}} Bennett was acknowledged {{in his time}} in both Britain and (particularly {{in the first half}} of the century) in Germany, although many British music lovers and several leading critics remained reluctant to acknowledge the possibility that an English composer could be of the same stature as a German one. The Leipzig public, which had initially held that view, had been rapidly converted. Mendelssohn wrote to Bennett [...] "...y Countrymen became aware that music is the same in England as in Germany <b>and</b> <b>everywhere,</b> and so by your successes you have destroyed that prejudice which nobody could ever have destroyed but a true Genius." ...|$|E
500|$|The Jersey Shore attacks {{compelled}} {{scientists in}} the United States to revise their assumptions that sharks were timid and powerless.

[...] He continued, [...] "One of the most prodigious, and perhaps the most formidable of sharks is the man-eater, Carcharodon carcharias [...] It roams through all temperate and tropical seas, <b>and</b> <b>everywhere</b> is an object of dread.
