The simplest tomato sauces consist just of chopped tomato flesh cooked in <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> and simmered until it loses its raw flavor, and seasoned with salt.|$|E
50|$|Pesto is {{traditionally}} prepared in a marble mortar {{with a wooden}} pestle.

50|$|Amatriciana {{originates}} from {{a recipe}} named gricia. Grici were what Romans—modern dwellers of Rome, not the ancient ones—called the sellers {{of bread and}} comestibles. They were so called in {{that a number of}} them emigrated from the Swiss canton of Grisons. According to another hypothesis, the name originates from the hamlet of Grisciano, in the comune of Accumoli, near Amatrice. The sauce was (and still is) prepared with guanciale (cured pork cheek) and grated pecorino. According to the matching hypothesis, ingredients reflect local products available either to a simple grocery store or to common folk who practiced herding in the mountainous area. At some point, <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> was added to the recipe; also {{it should be noted that}} in the 1960s the Amatriciana sauce was still prepared in this way in Amatrice itself.|$|E
50|$|The key is preparation. A dry-saute is best. Clean {{and slice}} the mushrooms, then {{put them in}} a skillet on maximum heat with no butter or oil. {{sprinkle}} them with salt (to help draw out the moisture). Stir constantly until they begin to give off liquid, then let them cook in their own juices. After the liquid has evaporated (you can pour off some of it for use as stock), continue to cook them for a couple of minutes, stirring constantly again so they don't stick. Then turn down the heat, add <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> or butter, and cook for another 5-10 minutes. They should be fairly chewy and full of flavor, not slimy, You can eat them as they are or incorporate them into any dish.|$|E

50|$|For 700 g of fish, finely chop {{an onion}} and saute it with oil, parsley, and two whole cloves of garlic. The moment the onion starts to brown, add 300 g of chopped from {{tomatoes}} or tomato paste, {{and season with}} salt and pepper. When the tomatoes are cooked, pour in one finger of strong vinegar or two fingers of weak vinegar, diluted in a large glass of water. Let boil for a few more minutes, then discard the garlic and strain the rest of the ingredients, pressing hard against the mesh. Put the strained sauce back on the fire along with whatever fish you may have on hand, including sole, red mullet, gurnard, dogfish, mantis shrimp, and other types of fish in season, leaving the small fish whole and cutting the big ones into small pieces. Taste for seasoning; but in any case it is not a bad idea to add <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> since the amount of soffritto was quite small. When the fish is cooked, the cacciucco is usually brought to the table on two separate platters: on one you place the fish, strained from the broth, and on the other you arrange enough finger-thick slices of bread to soak up all the broth.|$|E

30|$|EEC Regulation 2568 / 91 [1] and International Olive Council (IOC) [2] have {{established}} both analytical and organoleptic criteria {{to define the}} quality grade of an <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> According {{to the results of}} chemical and sensory analyses, an <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> can be classified as extra virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (EVOO), virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> or lampante <b>olive</b> <b>oil.</b> Each category has a completely different commercial and nutritional value. Extra virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> (EVOO) is a natural fruit juice with peculiar nutritional, healthy [3] and sensory [4] qualities as well as it represents a fundamental component of Mediterranean diet which is very rich in mono-unsaturated fatty acids [5] and polyphenols [6]. On the contrary, lampante <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> have a distinctly unpleasant smell, are not edible and are used for the production of refined <b>olive</b> <b>oils.</b> It is well known that selling virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> or lampante <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> as EVOOs is a fraud. However, another important aspect to consider is that the downgrading of an EVOO to a lower category implies a big economic loss for the producers. So, it is fundamental that both the chemical analyses and the organoleptic evaluations used to define quality grade are “sufficiently” objective and reproducible.|$|R
