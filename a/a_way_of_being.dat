La Maniarquía was accompanied to the ring by their mascot Maniaquito and their La Sociedad stablemate, AAA World Mixed Tag Team Champion Jennifer Blake, while Heavy Metal was accompanied by his valet Nanyzh Rock, midget companion Lokillo and musician Charly Montana. While {{every one of them}} followed the earlier agreement between Joaquin Roldán and Konnan and did not interfere in the match, Joe Líder's partner Nicho el Millonario, seeking revenge on La Maniarquía, ran in and tried to replace Heavy Metal, who had been taken out of the match by Chessman, which led to Roldán coming out with security and having them remove Nicho from the arena. Soon afterwards, Heavy Metal returned to the match and threw Último Gladiador from the top rope through a cello, given to him by Montana, while Electroshock superbombed Chessman through a table. Heavy Metal followed up by performing a diving elbow drop on Gladiador, after which the técnico duo scored a double pin on their opponents to win the match.|$|E
500|$|Blair {{later wrote}} that Serong had {{accepted}} the defence of South Vietnam from communism as his [...] "personal mission", and his decision to take an early retirement had been due to his increasing involvement with US organisations, the value they placed on his work and his profile as an international figure, {{as well as a}} growing [...] "emotional distance" [...] from the Australian Army and its senior leadership. He later wrote that he [...] "... found <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> of more service to the country outside it than in it." [...] Serong stayed in Vietnam as a security and intelligence adviser to the Vietnamese government. He also instructed at the National Defense College of South Vietnam and worked for the Rand organisation, Hudson Institute and other corporations, preparing strategic analyses. He was also a consultant to the Pentagon and the policy planning teams of several US presidents, including the Nixon administration. In 1971, Serong declared that South Vietnam had essentially won the war. Remaining long after the withdrawal of Australian forces, He continued to serve in Vietnam until the fall of Saigon. Serong departed Saigon the day prior to its capture, leaving by helicopter in the final airlift from the US embassy on 29 April 1975. He received several US and South Vietnamese awards, including the United States Legion of Merit, the (Vietnam) Medal of Honour, Cross of Gallantry (with palm), and Chevalier (Knight) of the National Order.|$|E

Goffman defined impression management as [...] "the way in which the individual ... presents himself and his activity to others, the ways in which he guides and controls the impression they form of him, and the kinds of things he may and may not do while sustaining his performance before them.

The minister readily agreed, although with conditions attached: the guns were to be used by military personnel, and troop transport was to be financed by the Western Australian government, and the farmers would provide food, accommodation, and payment for the ammunition. Pearce also supported the deployment {{on the grounds that the}} birds would make good target practice, although it has also been argued that some in the government may have viewed this as <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> seen to be helping the Western Australian farmers, and towards that end a cinematographer [...] from Fox Movietone was enlisted.|$|E
2500|$|Being-toward-death {{is not an}} {{orientation}} that brings Dasein closer to its end, in terms of clinical death, but is rather <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>being.</b> Being-toward-death refers to a process of growing through the world where a certain foresight guides the Dasein towards gaining an authentic perspective. It is provided by dread or death. In the analysis of time, it is revealed as a threefold condition of Being. Time, {{the present and the}} notion of the [...] "eternal", are modes of temporality. Temporality is the way we see time. For Heidegger, it {{is very different from the}} mistaken view of time as being a linear series of past, present and future. Instead he sees it as being an ecstasy, an outside-of-itself, of futural projections (possibilities) and one's place in history as a part of one's generation. Possibilities, then, are integral to our understanding of time; our projects, or thrown projection in-the-world, are what absorb and direct us. Futurity, as a direction toward the future that always contains the past—the has-been—is a primary mode of Daseins temporality.|$|E

In this study, passion was explored in semi-structured interviews with 12 participants. The qualitative grounded theory analysis revealed <b>a</b> passionate <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>being,</b> with passion being located in the individual {{rather than in a}} specific activity.

6000|$|The clue to {{all this}} tangle {{is as simple as}} it is terrible. If England is an aristocracy, England is dying.

It is the final sign of imbecility in a people that it calls cats dogs and describes the sun as the moon&mdash;and is very particular about the preciseness of these pseudonyms. To be wrong, and to be carefully wrong, that is the definition of decadence. The disease called aphasia, in which people begin by saying tea when they mean coffee, commonly ends in their silence. Silence of this stiff sort is the chief mark of the powerful parts of modern society. They all seem straining to keep things in rather than to let things out. For the kings of finance speechlessness is counted <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> strong, though it should rather be counted <b>a</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>being</b> sly.

Even the newspaper editors and proprietors are more despotic and dangerous by what they do not utter than by what they do. We have all heard the expression [...] "golden silence." [...] The expression [...] "brazen silence" [...] is the only adequate phrase for our editors. If we wake out of this throttled, gaping, and wordless nightmare, we must awake with a yell. The Revolution that releases England from the fixed falsity of its present position will be not less noisy than other revolutions. It will contain, I fear, a great deal of that rude accomplishment described among little boys as [...] "calling names"; but that will not matter much so long as they are the right names.|$|E
