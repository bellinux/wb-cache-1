Researcher Danah Boyd has raised concerns {{about the use of}} big data in science neglecting principles such as choosing a representative sample by being too concerned about actually handling the huge amounts of data. This approach may lead to results bias in one way or another. Integration across heterogeneous data resources—some that might be considered big data and others not—presents formidable logistical as well as analytical challenges, but many researchers argue that such integrations are likely to represent the most promising new frontiers in science.In the provocative article [...] "Critical Questions for Big Data", the authors title big data a part of mythology: [...] "large data sets offer a higher form of intelligence and knowledge ..., with the <b>aura</b> <b>of</b> truth, <b>objectivity,</b> and accuracy".

40|$|Identified as 'Editor's choice' {{for this}} issue, which meant it {{appeared}} on the journals website as open access and an additonal blog was written by the authors on the journal website to highlight the articles - [URL] rise of health issues such as HIV, pandemic influenza and Ebola on international agendas {{has led to the}} framing of threats to health as security issues. This has created an uneasy relationship between politics and health, by moving national interests into an area traditionally dominated by scientific rationalities and a predisposition towards cosmopolitan norms. Framing global health threats as risks, however, appears to be less politically charged and divisive, combining an <b>aura</b> <b>of</b> scientific <b>objectivity</b> with a moral call to action. In this article we argue that, despite its technical use in public health, in the policy discourse on global health the risk frame is not immune to values and interests but inherently political. It privileges a specific approach to global health policy which focuses on potential future catastrophes rather than presently existing health problems, emphasises technological solutions rather than addressing the socio-economic determinants of health, while there is no single risk frame, but rather multiple risk frames existing simultaneously, as seen during the 2014 - 15 West African Ebola outbreak. However, framing health in terms of risk is useful in understanding how health issues reflect and contribute to the wider zeitgeist concerning societal vulnerability: that dangers exist which are uncontrollable and are the product of technical progress. The risk frame allows us to place health issues into this wider context, where disease is just {{one of a number of}} concurrent dangers rather than a separately identifiable hazard.

40|$|In {{the course}} of the nineteenth century, the new {{scientific}} approach to history turned the past into a passive object of knowledge. This approach betrayed a strategy of domination, as it endowed certain interpretations of history with an <b>aura</b> <b>of</b> <b>objectivity,</b> while delegitimizing others as myth. On the contrary, Nietzsche asserted the formative powers of the present, and he argued that the historian had to actively re-create the past {{and turn it into a}} meaningful historical narrative. In his view, the meaning of the past depended on the will to transform the present itself. Since the beginning of the twentieth century, other theorists and writers, such as Croce, Péguy, and later Borges, attempted to reconceptualise the relation between the past and the present. Similarly to Nietzsche, they claimed that historians actively re-create and modify the past. This claim was also shared by Benjamin and Foucault, who emphasized the historians' duty to modify the past by seeking to revive subjugated historical knowledges. The aim of this article is to connect the writings of all these authors in a constellation that points to a shared conviction: that history is not objectively given, but constantly re-created and modified in the present...|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{an example}} of war footage in order to trace {{the ways in which}} the tension between presenting airwar as an `objective' piece of news and as an instance of intense human suffering is resolved in television's strategies of mediation. The bombardment of Baghdad in 2003 during the Iraq war was filmed in long-shot and presented in a quasi-literary narrative that capitalized on an aesthetics of horror, on sublime spectacle (Boltanski). The aestheticization of suffering on television is thus produced by a visual and linguistic complex that eliminates the human pain aspect of suffering, whilst retaining the phantasmagoric effects of a tableau vivant. The argument of this article is that such aestheticization of suffering manages simultaneously to preserve an <b>aura</b> <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> and impartiality, and to take a pro-war side in the war footage. The conclusion is that television's participation in the legitimation of war is more open to political and ethical criticism when seen in the light of the semiotic aestheticization of suffering than when it is confined to the general denunciation of `news bias' and the search for abstract objectivity...|$|E
40|$|Newspaper {{articles}} are commonly {{devoid of any}} authorial presence as they normally attempt to provide the <b>aura</b> <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> (McCabe and Heilman, 2007, p. 148). Bearing this in mind, {{this study was conducted}} to examine the traces of authorial subjectivity in four categories of news articles published in Scotland. These articles were published in 1938 in three news broadsheets. The traces of authorial subjectivity were analysed from the use of modal verbs by the authors. I am particularly interested in examining the modal markers through the use of modal verbs that writers use to inject their subjective voices into the texts with the purpose of ‘entertaining ’ dialogic alternatives with the readership. To serve this purpose, the appraisal framework propounded by Martin and White (2005) and Halliday’s (2004) notion of Mood and modality system were employed in the analysis of the resources of ‘engagement’. In the lexico-grammatical analysis of the newspaper articles, {{it was found that the}} Mood and modality systems expressing the interpersonal meaning of the texts were present in both independent clauses and dependent clauses in all four categories of news in the corpus. It was also found that all the clauses are in the declarative, suggesting an informative nature of the texts. In addition, the news writers also employed numerous modal verbs in presenting their subjective authorial positioning in the otherwise neutral journalistic texts...|$|E

40|$|Diffuse {{chemical}} use {{and pollution}} in agriculture create {{a number of}} risks, generating concern about food contamination, environmental degradation, health and safety and agricultural sustainability. While ecological inter-dependence ensures these risks have global implications, they do raise the interesting paradox that {{at the point of}} application farmers seem to constitute both cause and victim. However, while Australian broadacre farmers profess high levels of anxiety about using agricultural chemicals, their use continues to intensify. Farmers argue they have little choice in this if they are to maintain economic viability, but there is clearly more at work here than the playing out of the structural imperatives of capitalist accumulation. Technological innovation and productivity improvement are important elements of farmers' self-understandings of good farming practice, leading them into close association with agri-science institutions that promote intensification. Concerns about chemical use are alleviated by technologies of knowledge that lend an <b>aura</b> <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> to information that almost inevitably promotes input use. Further, a number of discursive strategies are employed by agri-businesses to associate chemical use with risk reduction, as well as with environmental and social responsibility. While the idea that farmers are simply dominated by more powerful interests is problematic, the diffuse deployment of disciplinary power through a range of social practices makes the likelihood of any fundamental realignment of the trajectory of agricultural development from within seem remote...|$|E
40|$|Is {{accounting}} {{a science}} of quantification, as many believe? We accountants provide the "bottom line", "performance evaluation numbers", "investment ratios", etc. These numbers {{have an impact}} on both society and our everyday lives. The corporate scandals of the late 1990 's and early 2000 's clearly demonstrate this impact. Ordinary citizens now realize that accounting is important and may affect their everyday lives. Porter (1992, 1995) argues that quantification as used (portrayed) in accounting obtains an <b>aura</b> <b>of</b> <b>objectivity,</b> which makes irrelevant any political and strategic overtones. We believe that most people view accounting as a merely technical discipline that reports economic "truths" about individuals, entities, and a host of managerial decisions. Our general research question is: how do people perceive characteristics of quantitative bits of evidence (including direct accounting information and other quantitative information) versus qualitative bits of evidence (including accounting information stated in a qualitative form and other qualitative information) ? We believe there is a perception of objectivity related to all quantitative elements (especially accounting oriented data) as compared to comparable qualitative elements and this may bias decision makers toward accepting quantitative information as "factual" and non-contestable. That is, the information is not merely an input to a decision but leads to the representation of the decision output. We address the primary research question in an experiment utilizing a capital investment scenario and a performance evaluation scenario. The scenarios facilitate using multiple cues in the tasks. The Balanced Scorecard framework, as developed by Kaplan and Norton (1992), provides the concepts used to identify relevant cues. This allowed us to address a secondary research question concerning whether financial cues are weighted heavier than non-financial cues in these two scenarios. İstanbul Ticaret Üniversites...|$|E
40|$|George O. May's (1952) prescient {{statement}} that "if accounting had not already become, {{it was well}} on its way to becoming a political phenomenon" provides the motivation for this study. Changing socioeconomic relationships in the post-World War II period make it an ideal period to examine the politicalization of accounting. Keynesian economic policies justified active government intervention in the economy to manage demand and ensure full employment. No longer could it be assumed that competitive market forces would ensure that corporations produced goods and services at a socially optimal level or that income would be distributed equitably. Claims that accounting profit provides a measure of managerial efficiency are based on these premises. This dissertation examines the political dynamics of one particular accounting measurement debate [...] the debate over the determination of business income. Policies, such as wage/price controls, the excess profits tax, and the undistributed profits tax, brought the accounting income determination debate to center stage. The perseverance of the historic cost allocation model in the face of significant economic changes presents a fascinating glimpse of the important role accounting played in justifying continued reliance on the private property rights paradigm. I use retrodiction (reasoning from present to past) to examine why the historic cost allocation model has been so enduring. In my examination, I use personal correspondence, transcripts of Congressional hearings, published financial statements, and relevant journal articles. My analysis indicates that, while accountants empathized with managers who claimed that inflation distorted reported earnings and recognized that a serious measurement scale issue existed, they also recognized that abandonment of historic cost would not be politically feasible. If accountants had adopted a strongly partisan position that favored management with respect to bargaining with labor, this could have undermined the profession's claim to neutrality and opened the standard-setting process to closer political scrutiny. Accountants responded to management in a less visible way. Standard setters adopted techniques that gave managers maximum flexibility in managing income while retaining the <b>aura</b> <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> that attached to historic cost...|$|E

40|$|Knowledge {{workers are}} an {{important}} resource for the typical modern business firm, yet financial reporting ignores such resources. Some researchers contend that the accounting profession has stressed reliability {{in order to make}} the accounting appear objective. Others concur, noting that accounting is an insecure profession and adopts strict rules when faced with uncertainty. Accountants have promulgated a strict rule to expense human resource costs, although many know that such resources have future benefits. Some researchers suggest that any discipline must modify its language in order to initiate change toward providing useful social ameliorations. If accounting theorists extend this idea to the accounting lexicon. s description of investments in human resources, investors and other accounting user groups might gain greater insight into how a firm fosters and nourishes human capital. I tested three hypotheses related to this issue by administering an experiment designed to assess financial analysts. perceptions about alternative financial statement treatments of human resources in an investment recommendation task. I predicted that (1) analysts' perceptions of the reliability (relevance) of the information they received would decrease (increase) as the treatment of human resources increasingly violated GAAP (became more current-oriented), (2) analysts exposed to alternative accounting treatments would report a lower likelihood of recommending that their clients invest in the company in the task, and (3) financial analysts who ranked reliability (relevance) as a more important information quality would be less (more) likely to recommend that their clients buy the stock represented in the case because the treatment of human resources on the financial statements violated GAAP (was more current-oriented) as compared to analysts who ranked reliability (relevance) as being lower (higher) in importance. Analysts receiving financial statements with accounting treatments of human resource costs that violated GAAP judged such information as less reliable and were also less likely to recommend that their clients buy the stock in the task than analysts receiving financial statements that conformed to GAAP. Also, analysts who perceived reliability as a more important information quality reacted more negatively to a replacement cost approach to accounting for human resources than participants who perceived reliability as being less important. A potential confounding explanation of the results is the varied language used in the audit opinions included with the treatment financial statements. Whether explained by the audit opinion language or the actual differences contained in the financial statements, the results suggest that an important user group, financial analysts, may be subject to the <b>aura</b> <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> suggested by Porter in 1995...|$|E

My aim is to understand and situate how objectivity has been conceptualized {{in the philosophy of}} science, and to question whether these conceptualizations are consistent with the actual ways in which objectivity has been sought in scientific practice. I examine the dominant views <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> in mainstream philosophy of science and feminist reactions to them.

One of the main criticisms against feminist epistemologies, which argue for the gender specificity of knowledge, is that they lead to epistemic relativism. And hence it is argued that feminist epistemologies undermine “scientific objectivity”. In arguing for the fruitfulness and consistency of a feminist account <b>of</b> <b>objectivity,</b> I examine in what ways claims about the gender specificity of knowledge could be understood without rendering the notion <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> redundant...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses issues {{relevant to}} philosophy of science {{as well as}} epistemology. I discuss the various definitions <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> and objective knowledge in science, and I argue for a dialectical sense <b>of</b> <b>objectivity.</b> This sense <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> holds that interaction between subject and object, between multiple subjects, and between subjects and their social/historical context are constitutive of the achievement of objective knowledge. Dialectical objectivity stands in contrast to other senses <b>of</b> <b>objectivity,</b> that advocate a strict separation of knower and the known {{in order to reduce}} or deny any subjective influences on knowledge claims. I clarify my notion <b>of</b> dialectical <b>objectivity</b> by comparing it to the work of other philosophers of science (such as Latour and Adorno) as well as by showing its historical roots in Hegel. Also, I apply the concept <b>of</b> dialectical <b>objectivity</b> to a case study from the history of sonar and underwater imaging technologies. The history of sonar technology involves the military-industrial complex, various countries, the academy, engineers, and popular culture. The recent shift to acoustic daylight imaging technology, which gives a new and significant role to the ambient underwater noise environment, has important philosophical implications. Acoustic daylight imaging reconceives the underwater world and its objects for sonar technicians and researchers, and holds that interaction with the underwater context produces knowledge. I argue that this combination of social interaction between various knowers, and the interaction between the knower and known, are best explicated by the dialectical sense <b>of</b> <b>objectivity.</b> Next I show how the dialectical sense <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> enriches the work of Philip Kitcher, clarifying his tools for characterizing scientific progress, and addressing criticism of his work with regard to the correspondence theory of truth. Finally, I argue that there are profitable connections between the dialectical sense <b>of</b> <b>objectivity</b> and the work of Sandra Harding on strong objectivity, and that those connections may provide a new common ground for mainstream and feminist philosophers of science...|$|R
