2500|$|Ford Racing Performance Group {{provided}} Shelby its FR1 Power Pack to add 25 horsepower to {{the existing}} Mustang GT powertrain with an additional 10ft/lb of torque. The package included a 90mm cold <b>air</b> <b>kit,</b> muffler kit, a new X-pipe and Ford Racing [...] "GTA" [...] axle-back mufflers. The Ford Shelby GT-H also had the Ford Racing Handling Pack (FR3) which included specially tuned dampers, lowering springs, sway bars, strut tower brace, and a Ford Racing 3.55:1 ratio rear axle assembly.|$|E
50|$|Tuning {{options are}} very limited with the Bosch K-Jetronic models. The siamesed inlet and exhaust ports of the 2.8 only {{respond well to}} forced {{induction}} or an overbore; normal tuning will yield only minor power results. The MFI 2.8 Cologne (Capri/Sierra 2.8i) uses a very restricted induction setup, and no open <b>air</b> <b>kit</b> is available due to this.|$|E

50|$|K&N {{was founded}} by Ken Johnson and Norm McDonald in 1964. The name K&N came from the first letters in the founders' first names. Johnson and McDonald sold {{motorcycles}} and motorcycle parts and supported a K&N factory race team. Air filters soon became {{the primary focus of}} the company. In the late 1980s, K&N introduced a bolt-on performance <b>air</b> intake <b>kit</b> to replace the factory air box and air filter. K&N also released a line of Wrench-Off oil filters. K&N has maintained very active involvement in racing and motorsports throughout its history, including the NASCAR Pro Series East and West, and the King of the West 410 Sprint Car Series.|$|R
50|$|The {{top speed}} of a Tundra Buggy is {{approximately}} 45 km/h (28 mph) on a smooth trail, but usually travels much slower.

50|$|The Lindholme Gear was {{originally}} designed to be carried by Hampden aircraft but was mainly carried by Royal Air Force maritime patrol aircraft like the Vickers Warwick and later the Avro Lancaster, Avro Shackleton and Hawker Siddeley Nimrod. The Gear was also used by the Royal Canadian Air Force and the South African Air Force Avro Shackleton. Lindholme gear was also carried in the bomb bay by the Royal Australian Air Force maritime patrol aircraft Lockheed P3B & P3C Orions, consisting of two 10-man liferafts and two stores containers; this equipment was later replaced by ASRK (<b>Air</b> Sea Rescue <b>Kits).</b>|$|R
50|$|Next, Area's Immediate Reading (AIR) was the group's {{prototyping}} {{of portable}} <b>air</b> quality measurement <b>kits</b> to monitor <b>air</b> pollutants in Lower Manhattan, {{and to create}} data visualizations of its finds. An early prototype was developed in San Francisco, with a public workshop taking place in June 2006 in New York City and the full project launching that September. Each device measured carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides levels, indicators for street-level pollution, and contained a GPS unit to pinpoint the reading's location, and could also reveal the location and emissions levels of major culprits, such as a power plant.|$|R

40|$|Maritime and {{air traffic}} through the Arctic has {{increased}} in recent years. Cruise ship and commercial jet liners carry {{a large number of}} passengers. With increased traffic, there is a higher probability that a major disaster could occur. Cruise ship and plane accidents could be catastrophic and may require mass rescue. Due to the remote location, limited search and rescue resources, time for these resources to get to the accident location and large number of survivors, the retrieval time could be several days. Therefore, survivors may be required to survive on their own for days while they await rescue. Recognizing that the International Maritime Organization does not have specific thermal performance criteria for liferafts and lifeboats and personal and group survival kits, a team of researchers from 14 Canadian and international government agencies, universities, companies and regulatory authority initiated a research project to improve safety and provide input for advances to regulations. The objective of the project is to investigate if the current thermal protective equipment and preparedness available to people traveling in the Canadian Arctic are adequate for surviving a major air or cruise ship disaster and to identify the minimum thermal protection criteria for survival. This project builds on the results and tools developed in other research projects conducted by the team on thermal protection of liferafts, lifeboats and immersion suits. The project is divided into three major phases 2 ÃÜ 013 clothing ensemble testing with thermal manikins, a physiology experiment on sustainable shivering duration and ensemble testing in Arctic conditions with human subjects. A numerical model uses these data to simulate survival scenarios. In the first phase of this project, the thermal resistance values of the protective clothing typically available to cruise ship and aircraft passengers were measured using two thermal manikins. The ensembles included Cabin Wear, Deck Wear, Expedition Wear, Abandonment Wear and protective clothing from Canada Forces Major <b>Air</b> Disaster <b>Kit</b> (MAJAID). Tests were conducted on dry and wet ensembles at 50 C and 150 C with and without wind. There is very good agreement between the thermal resistances measured by the two manikins. The differences in thermal resistances observed are likely caused by variations in fit and wrinkles and folds in the ensembles from dressing. With no wind, the thermal resistance is lowest with Cabin Wear and highest with MAJAID clothing inside the down-filled casualty bag. The Expedition Wear, the Abandonment Wear and the MAJAID clothing have about the same thermal resistance. With 7 metre-per-second wind, the thermal resistance of all ensembles decreased significantly by 30...|$|R
5000|$|Following the two gunship series NAA again {{produced}} the medium bomber configuration with the B-25J series.. It optimized {{the mix of}} the interim NA-100 and the H series having both the bombardier's station and fixed guns of the D and the forward turret and refined armament of the H series. NAA also produced a strafer nose first shipped to <b>air</b> depots as <b>kits,</b> then introduced on the production line in alternating blocks with the bombardier nose. The solid-metal [...] "strafer" [...] nose housed eight centerline Browning M2 [...]50 calibre machine guns. The remainder of the armament was as in the H-5. NAA also supplied kits to mount eight underwing 5 [...] "high velocity airborne rockets" [...] (HVAR) just outside the propeller arcs. These were mounted on zero length launch rails, four to a wing.The final, and the most built, series of the Mitchell, the B-25J, looked less like earlier series apart from the well-glazed bombardier's nose of nearly-identical appearance to the earliest B-25 subtypes. Instead, the J followed the overall configuration of the H series from the cockpit aft. It had the forward dorsal turret and other armament and airframe advancements. All J models included four [...]50 in (12.7 mm) light-barrel Browning AN/M2 guns {{in a pair of}} [...] "fuselage package", conformal gun pods each flanking the lower cockpit, each pod containing two Browning M2s. By 1945, however, combat squadrons removed these. The J series restored the co-pilot's seat and dual flight controls. The factory made available <b>kits</b> to the <b>Air</b> Depot system to create the strafer-nose B-25J-2. This configuration carried a total of 18 [...]50 in (12.7 mm) light-barrel AN/M2 Browning M2 machine guns: eight in the nose, four in the flank-mount conformal gun pod packages, two in the dorsal turret, one each in the pair of waist positions, and a pair in the tail - with 14 of the guns either aimed directly forward, or aimed to fire directly forward for strafing missions. Some aircraft had eight 5 in (130 mm) high-velocity aircraft rockets (HVAR). [...] NAA introduced the J-2 into production in alternating blocks at the J-22. Total J series production was 4,318.|$|R
