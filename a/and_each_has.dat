5|$|Several cheeses may {{be mixed}} {{together}} in its formulation, <b>and</b> <b>each</b> <b>has</b> individual browning and blistering characteristics. For example, {{a combination of}} Mozzarella and Cheddar may blister less when cooked compared to other combinations, because cheddar has less elasticity, while Mozzarella and provolone may brown less compared to other combinations.|$|E
5|$|Battles are turn-based {{and take}} place on grid-based maps. Victory is {{achieved}} when an enemy base is captured or all enemies are defeated. Each character holds four weapons and four items, <b>and</b> <b>each</b> <b>has</b> an assigned character class, which affects their movement range, damage and what weapons can be used. Mounted units also {{have the option to}} dismount, which changes their abilities and stats while reducing movement range.|$|E

5|$|The plot is {{traditional}} {{in regards to}} Restoration theatre and includes three female characters, three respectable males, three non-respectable males, and three side characters. Each respectable male meets their female counterpart three times, <b>and</b> <b>each</b> <b>has</b> a parallel incident with letters and an unmasking. The primary plot of the play deals with Wisemore and his pursuit of Lady Matchless. With {{the help of his}} friend Merital, Wisemore is able to overcome other lovers and various struggles in order to prove his worth to Matchless and win her love.|$|E
5|$|The {{station has}} a very small car park (eleven spaces) and is not {{permanently}} staffed, but it contains a ticket machine, one of an initial batch of ten installed by SPT in late 2003 and early 2004 {{as part of a}} drive to curb fare dodging, which was estimated to be costing the company £2 million a year. Both platforms are elevated <b>and</b> <b>each</b> <b>has</b> a wheelchair ramp. There is a connecting footbridge between the two platforms.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} approach was {{the development of}} the ADS or armoured suit, which isolates the diver from the pressure at depth, at the cost of mechanical complexity and limited dexterity. The technology first became practicable in the middle 20th century. Isolation of the diver from the environment was taken further by the development of remotely operated underwater vehicles in the late 20th century, where the operator controls the ROV from the surface, and autonomous underwater vehicles, which dispense with an operator altogether. All of these modes are still in use <b>and</b> <b>each</b> <b>has</b> a range of applications where it has advantages over the others, though diving bells have largely been relegated to a means of transport for surface supplied divers. In some cases combinations are particularly effective, such as the simultaneous use of surface orientated or saturation surface supplied diving equipment and work or observation class remotely operated vehicles.|$|E

5|$|Each {{platform}} has two same-level fare control areas, one {{at either}} end of the station, and there are no crossovers or crossunders. The full-time ones are at the north end <b>and</b> <b>each</b> <b>has</b> a turnstile bank, token booth, and two street stairs. The ones on the Manhattan-bound platform go up to the northeast and southeast corners of Bergen and Smith Streets while those on the Coney Island-bound platform go up to the northwest and southwest corners. The fare control areas on the south end of the platforms are unstaffed, containing full height turnstiles and one street stair to the northeast corner of Warren and Smith Streets on the Manhattan-bound platform and the northwest corner for the Coney Island-bound platform. The south fare control area is more heavily used.|$|E
5|$|Grand Teton National Park {{has five}} front-country {{vehicular}} access campgrounds. The largest are the Colter Bay and Gros Ventre campgrounds, <b>and</b> <b>each</b> <b>has</b> 350campsites which can accommodate large recreational vehicles. Lizard Creek and Signal Mountain campgrounds have 60 and 86campsites respectively, while the smaller Jenny Lake campground has only 49 sites for tent use only. Additionally, full hookups for recreational vehicles {{are at the}} concessionaire managed 112campsites at Colter Bay Village and another 100 at Flagg Ranch in the John D. Rockefeller Memorial Parkway. Though all front-country campgrounds are only open from late spring to late fall, primitive winter camping is permitted at Colter Bay near the visitor center.|$|E
5|$|Mysteries of the Sith is {{primarily}} a first-person shooter, but offers {{the choice of a}} third-person view. Unlike Dark Forces II, where the player's actions within the game dictate whether the story ends with the light side or the dark side ending, Mysteries of the Sith has a single, morally positive course. The player progresses through the game in a linear fashion; there are fourteen levels <b>and</b> <b>each</b> <b>has</b> set objectives that the player must complete before being able to continue to the next level. Within each level the player can encounter both hostile and non-hostile non-player characters (NPCs). As well as including some enemies that featured in Dark Forces II, Mysteries of the Sith adds twenty new monsters, including a rancor. Some non-hostile NPCs may help the player by attacking enemies.|$|E

5|$|Players {{can either}} choose {{to play a}} ranked Deathmatch or DarkOps, {{where they will be}} matched with other players using a system called TrueSkill Matchmaking, or they may choose a player match where they can choose their game from a list of player hosted games. Like the {{original}} Perfect Dark, these games can be highly customized and can also include computer game bots. Features such as their difficulty and behavior can be changed to match player preference. For example, the Judge bot always attacks leading players with the highest kills score. Players can also issue commands to them {{as long as they are}} on their respective team, such as follow or hold position, and set waypoints for them to walk to. The game includes by default six different maps <b>and</b> <b>each</b> <b>has</b> two variants; the only change is the placement of the bases. Most of the maps are large ones, ideal for 32 players at once, with small variants for 4-16 player games.|$|E
5|$|Some insects, {{occupying the}} {{biological}} niches that they do, {{need to be}} incredibly maneuverable. They must find their food in tight spaces and be capable of escaping larger predators – or they may themselves be predators, and need to capture prey. Their maneuverability, from an aerodynamic viewpoint, is provided by high lift and thrust forces. Typical insect fliers can attain lift forces up to three times their weight and horizontal thrust forces up to five times their weight. There are two substantially different insect flight mechanisms, <b>and</b> <b>each</b> <b>has</b> its own advantages and disadvantages – just because odonates have a more primitive flight mechanism does not mean they are less able fliers; they are, in certain ways, more agile than anything that has evolved afterward.|$|E
5|$|The {{restored}} east range measures around 31m by 10m, with a {{pitched roof}} and crow-step gables. It is entered through a richly carved doorway, dated 1622 and initialled SWS for Sir William Sinclair, which gives {{access to the}} third floor. The three lower floors are cut into the rock, <b>and</b> <b>each</b> <b>has</b> four vaulted rooms, with a fifth in the south-east tower. These lower levels were used for service rooms, with the principal rooms in the two upper floors. At the lowest level was a kitchen, with a bakehouse above. On the exterior, gunloops are found on the south wall, with several shot-holes on the east.|$|E

5|$|There are 13 {{residential}} neighbourhoods, {{each with}} a variety of housing types: terraced, semi-detached and detached houses, low-rise flats and bungalows. There are no residential tower blocks, apart from the 8 storey Milton Mount Flats at the North end of Pound Hill. Many houses have their own gardens and are set back from roads. The hub of each neighbourhood is a shopping parade, community centre and church, <b>and</b> <b>each</b> <b>has</b> a school and recreational open spaces as well. Crawley Development Corporation's intention was for neighbourhood shops to cater only to basic needs, and for the town centre to be used for most shopping requirements. The number of shop units provided in the neighbourhood parades reflected this: despite the master plan making provision for at least 20 shops in each neighbourhood, the number actually built ranged from 19 in the outlying Langley Green neighbourhood to just seven in West Green, close to the town centre.|$|E
5|$|Six {{athletes have}} each won four medals in volleyball. Cuban Ana Fernández and American Kerri Walsh Jennings each have three gold and one bronze, Soviet Inna Ryskal and Brazilian Sérgio Santos have two gold and two silver medals, Russian Sergey Tetyukhin has one gold, one silver, and two bronzes, and Italian Samuele Papi has two silvers and two bronzes. Eight athletes have won three gold medals. Five, {{including}} Fernández, {{were members of}} the Cuban women's indoor team that won consecutive golds in 1992, 1996 and 2000. May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings, as noted above, won beach volleyball gold medals in 2004, 2008 and 2012. The other is Karch Kiraly, who won gold with the United States men's indoor team in 1984 and 1988 and in beach volleyball in 1996. Kiraly is the only player of either sex to win medals in both indoor and beach volleyball. Kiraly is also one of four people that have won medals both as a player and coach. Apart from May-Treanor and Walsh Jennings, Ricardo Santos and Emanuel Rego of Brazil are the only athletes with three medals in beach volleyball. They have one gold and one bronze as a team, <b>and</b> <b>each</b> <b>has</b> one silver with other partners.|$|E
5|$|The NGC 4038 Group is a {{group of}} galaxies across Corvus and Crater. The group may contain between 13 and 27 galaxies. The best-known member is the Antennae {{peculiar}} galaxy, located 0.25 north of 31 Crateris. It consists of two interacting galaxies—NGC 4038 and 4039—that appear to have a heart shape as seen from Earth. The name originates from the huge tidal tails that come off the ends of the two galaxies, formed because of the spiral galaxies' original rotation. Both original galaxies were spiral galaxies and are now experiencing extensive star formation due to the interaction of gas clouds. The galaxies are 45 million light-years from Earth <b>and</b> <b>each</b> <b>has</b> multiple ultraluminous X-ray sources, the source of which is unknown. Astronomers theorize that they may be a rare type of x-ray emitting binary stars or intermediate-mass black holes. The Antennae Galaxies appear in a telescope at the 10th magnitude. SN 2004gt was a type Ic supernova that erupted on December 12, 2004. The progenitor was not identified from older images of the galaxy, and is either a type WC Wolf–Rayet star with a mass over 40 times that of the Sun, or a star 20 to 40 times as massive as the Sun in a binary star system. SN 2007sr was a Type Ia supernova event that peaked in brightness on December 14, 2007. The galaxy has been identified as a good place to take detailed images in case of further supernovae.|$|E
