5|$|Animals as a {{category}} have several characteristics that generally set them apart from other living things. Animals are eukaryotic and usually multicellular (although see Myxozoa), which separates them from bacteria, archaea, and most protists. They are heterotrophic, generally digesting food in an internal chamber, which separates them from plants and algae. They are also distinguished from plants, algae, <b>and</b> <b>fungi</b> by lacking cell walls.|$|E

5|$|However, in dinoflagellates, {{the nuclear}} {{envelope}} remains intact, the centrosomes {{are located in}} the cytoplasm, and the microtubules come in contact with chromosomes, whose centromeric regions are incorporated into the nuclear envelope (the so-called closed mitosis with extranuclear spindle). In many other protists (e.g., ciliates, sporozoans) <b>and</b> <b>fungi,</b> the centrosomes are intranuclear, and their nuclear envelope also does not disassemble during cell division.|$|E
5|$|In {{molecular}} phylogenetics analyses from 2005 onwards, important {{groups of}} developmental genes {{show the same}} variety in cnidarians as in chordates. In fact cnidarians, and especially anthozoans (sea anemones and corals), retain some genes that are present in bacteria, protists, plants <b>and</b> <b>fungi</b> but not in bilaterians.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1965, the first {{vascular}} plant was found growing on the northern shore of Surtsey, mosses became visible in 1967, and lichens were first found on the Surtsey lava in 1970. Plant colonisation on Surtsey has been closely studied, the vascular plants in particular {{as they have been}} of far greater significance than mosses, lichens <b>and</b> <b>fungi</b> in the development of vegetation.|$|E

5|$|Mycorrhizal {{symbiosis}} between plants <b>and</b> <b>fungi</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} well-known plant–fungus associations and is of significant importance for plant growth and persistence in many ecosystems; over 90% of all plant species engage in mycorrhizal relationships with fungi and are dependent upon this relationship for survival.|$|E
5|$|Mycotoxins are {{secondary}} metabolites (or natural products), {{and research}} has established {{the existence of}} biochemical pathways solely {{for the purpose of}} producing mycotoxins and other natural products in fungi. Mycotoxins may provide fitness benefits in terms of physiological adaptation, competition with other microbes <b>and</b> <b>fungi,</b> and protection from consumption (fungivory). Many fungal secondary metabolites (or derivatives) are used medically, as described under Human Use below.|$|E
5|$|Okapis are herbivores, {{feeding on}} tree leaves and buds, grasses, ferns, fruits, <b>and</b> <b>fungi.</b> They prefer {{to feed in}} treefall gaps. Staple foods {{comprise}} shrubs and lianas. The main constituents of the diet are woody, dicotyledonous species; monocotyledonous plants are not eaten regularly. In the Ituri forest, the okapi feeds mainly upon the plant families Acanthaceae, Ebenaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Flacourtiaceae, Loganiaceae, Rubiaceae and Violaceae.|$|E

5|$|The American artist Miriam C. Rice pioneered {{research}} into using various mushrooms for natural dyes. Starting {{in the late}} 1960s, she discovered mushroom dyes for a complete rainbow palette. Swedish and American mycologists, building upon Rice's research, have discovered sources for true blues (Sarcodon squamosus) and mossy greens (Hydnellum geogenium). Hypholoma fasciculare provides a yellow dye, <b>and</b> <b>fungi</b> such as Phaeolus schweinitzii and Pisolithus tinctorius are used in dyeing textiles and paper.|$|E

5|$|The major phosphosphingolipids {{of mammals}} are sphingomyelins (ceramide phosphocholines), whereas insects contain mainly ceramide phosphoethanolamines <b>and</b> <b>fungi</b> have phytoceramide phosphoinositols and mannose-containing headgroups. The glycosphingolipids are a diverse family of {{molecules}} composed {{of one or}} more sugar residues linked via a glycosidic bond to the sphingoid base. Examples of these are the simple and complex glycosphingolipids such as cerebrosides and gangliosides.|$|E
5|$|Typically nocturnal (active at night), {{the royal}} {{antelope}} exhibits remarkable alertness. Territories are marked with dung. A herbivore, the royal antelope prefers small quantities of fresh foliage and shoots; fruits <b>and</b> <b>fungi</b> {{may be taken}} occasionally. Like other neotragines, the royal antelope is monogamous. Both sexes can become sexually mature by as early as six months. Births {{have been reported in}} November and December. A single, delicate young is born after an unknown gestational period.|$|E
5|$|A herbivore, {{the royal}} {{antelope}} prefers small quantities of fresh foliage and shoots; fruits <b>and</b> <b>fungi</b> {{may be taken}} occasionally. Though the antelope {{is considered to be}} nocturnal, zoologist Jonathan Kingdon holds that feeding occurs throughout the day, though some foraging may also be observed at night. In comparison to Bates's pygmy antelope, the royal antelope has a longer muzzle, broader lips, a smaller mouth and smaller cheek muscles. These features do not allow complete digestion of lignified growth. Individuals may often move into new locations foraging for fresh growth.|$|E

5|$|Americium is an {{artificial}} element of recent origin, and thus {{does not have}} a biological requirement. It is harmful to life. It has been proposed to use bacteria for removal of americium and other heavy metals from rivers and streams. Thus, Enterobacteriaceae of the genus Citrobacter precipitate americium ions from aqueous solutions, binding them into a metal-phosphate complex at their cell walls. Several studies have been reported on the biosorption and bioaccumulation of americium by bacteria <b>and</b> <b>fungi.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ants form {{symbiotic}} {{associations with}} a range of species, including other ant species, other insects, plants, <b>and</b> <b>fungi.</b> They also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this ant mimicry (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving Batesian mimicry, where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show Wasmannian mimicry, a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines.|$|E
5|$|As {{knowledge}} has increased, paleontology has developed specialised subdivisions. Vertebrate paleontology concentrates on fossils of vertebrates, {{from the earliest}} fish to the immediate ancestors of modern mammals. Invertebrate paleontology deals with fossils of invertebrates such as molluscs, arthropods, annelid worms and echinoderms. Paleobotany focuses {{on the study of}} fossil plants, but traditionally includes the study of fossil algae <b>and</b> <b>fungi.</b> Palynology, the study of pollen and spores produced by land plants and protists, straddles the border between paleontology and botany, as it deals with both living and fossil organisms. Micropaleontology deals with all microscopic fossil organisms, regardless of the group to which they belong.|$|E
