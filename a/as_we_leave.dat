2500|$|May's {{supporters}} {{included a}} number of Cabinet ministers, such as Amber Rudd, Chris Grayling, Justine Greening, Jeremy Hunt, Michael Fallon and Patrick McLoughlin. She won {{the first round of}} voting on 5 July, receiving support from 165 MPs, with rivals Andrea Leadsom receiving 66 votes and Michael Gove 48. After the results were announced, May said she was [...] "pleased" [...] and [...] "grateful" [...] for the support of other MPs and confirmed that she wanted to unite the party and the UK, to negotiate the [...] "best possible deal <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> the EU", and to [...] "make Britain work for everyone". The two candidates with the fewest votes, Liam Fox and Stephen Crabb, immediately announced their support for May. May came in first place in the second ballot on 7 July with an overwhelming majority of 199 MPs, compared with 84 for Leadsom and 46 for Gove, who was eliminated. Afterwards, May stated that she was delighted with her support among MPs, and she progressed to a vote of the Conservative Party membership against Leadsom.|$|E

6000|$|... "It's a {{way they}} seem to have. Your trouble is that you're too diffuse; you spread {{yourself}} out too much. You want to fix your mind on one thing and {{that will have to}} be business as soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> here." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dorle nodded. [...] "What's your solution, then? As soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> {{the ground}} we'll be shot down." [...] His face twisted bitterly.

60|$|The farther she {{got from}} home the shabbier her gown seemed {{and the more}} {{impossible}} her coat and hat. At last, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> were <b>leaving</b> Minneapolis {{on our way to}} Osage she leaned her tired head against me and sobbed out a wild wish to go home.|$|R
6000|$|She also debated [...] "Mr. Newsome and Madame de Vionnet may, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> were saying, <b>leave</b> town. How long do {{you think}} you can bear it without them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "London makes {{children}} pale. I shall soon {{take her}} home to acquire a little colour. You must know Sir Henry has bitten us with his yachting tastes, and <b>as</b> soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> can <b>leave</b> London, <b>we</b> are going to spend six weeks with the Walkinghames at Ryde, and rival you, Harry. I think Miss Leonora will be better at home, so <b>we</b> must <b>leave</b> her there. Lodgings and irregularities don't suit people of her age." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Half a dozen will be enough. Pick {{out that}} number of strong fellows, whom you can rely upon.

There is a private door leading to the house, is there not?" ...|$|E
60|$|To {{mention it}} may be of help in {{visualizing}} and understanding that direct and forceful epoch, and may even suggest some lenience in considering a Pope's carnal paternity. To those to whom {{the point of view}} of the Renaissance does not promptly suggest itself from this plain statement of fact, all unargued <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> it, we recommend a perusal of Gianpietro de Crescenzi's Il Nobile Romano.|$|E

40|$|Have {{you ever}} {{realized}} just how great an influence Dame Fashion has upon {{us and our}} ways of living, thinking and acting? We think we are a free and independent people; but are <b>we</b> <b>as</b> free <b>as</b> <b>we</b> would <b>leave</b> ourselves - to believe~ We are slaves to an unwritten law-that of fashion.

I expect that, as soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave,</b> the people here will go down into one of their valleys. The cold up here must be getting frightful and, as there is not a tree anywhere near, they would not be able even to keep up fires.|$|E
6000|$|... "Truly, Albert," [...] Dame Agatha said, [...] "this {{is not a}} castle; it is {{a veritable}} enchanted palace. Mynheer Van Voorden is {{like one of the}} good genii the Saracens believe in, who can, at will, summon up from the ground a vast palace, ready built and furnished. I trust that it will not at once vanish as soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> it. Were it to do so I should {{scarcely}} be more surprised than I have been at its splendour and comfort." ...|$|E

But ye will get the blue bowl, Robin--the blue bowl--that will sloken all their drouth, and prevent the sinful repetition of whipping for an eke of a Saturday at e'en.

60|$|We had two {{deliveries}} {{of letters}} at Borden Tower, and just <b>as</b> <b>we</b> were <b>leaving</b> the dinner-table that evening the late post arrived.

As soon as the cloth was cleared I did so.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, my daughter; {{not quite}} as unmilitary <b>as</b> that. <b>We</b> shall <b>leave</b> Lieutenant Muir, brother Cap, Corporal M'Nab, and three men to compose the {{garrison}} during our absence. Jennie will remain with you in this hut, and brother Cap will occupy my place." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{arrangement}} being concluded, we bade {{the captain}} good morning; and <b>as</b> <b>we</b> were about <b>leaving</b> the cabin, he smiled again, and said, [...] "Well, Redburn, my boy, you won't get home-sick before you sail, {{because that will}} make you very sea-sick when you get to sea." ...|$|R
6000|$|God, who {{has been}} very good to us, will be more good, if we allow Him! Worldly-minded people think they can manage so much better than God. We must trust. Our weapons must be prayer and faith, and our only {{standard}} the Bible. As soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> these weapons and take to [...] "knowledge of the world," [...] and other people's clumsy prejudices as our guides, we must inevitably be beaten by the World, which knows how to use its own arms better than we do. What else is meant by becoming as a little child? ...|$|E
60|$|I {{write down}} {{his name in}} my little book, among those of others dearly loved, who, too, have been summoned hence. And so we meet and part; we {{struggle}} and succeed; or we fail and drop unknown on the way. <b>As</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> the fond mother's knee, the rough trials of childhood and boyhood begin; and then manhood is upon us, and the battle of life, with its chances, perils, wounds, defeats, distinctions. And Fort William guns are saluting in one man's honor,* while the troops are firing the last volleys over the other's grave--over the grave of the brave, the gentle, the faithful Christian soldier.|$|E
6000|$|Now behold {{her with}} her hands thrown to heaven, and hear the wild shriek [...] "Madonna!" [...] through all the hubbub. But she picks up her two skirt-knees, and with her thin legs in grey {{stockings}} starts with a mad rush after the train. In vain. The train inexorably pursues its course. Prancing, she reaches {{one end of the}} platform <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> the other end. Then she realizes {{it is not going to}} stop for her. And then, oh horror, her long arms thrown out in wild supplication after the retreating train: then flung aloft to God: then brought down in absolute despair on her head. And this is the last sight we have of her, clutching her poor head in agony and doubling forward. She is left--she is abandoned.|$|E
6000|$|... "And yet <b>as</b> {{he finds}} <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> him so fast," [...] {{returned}} Griffith, [...] "he must {{see that all}} his hopes rest in cutting us up aloft.

6000|$|... "England is most inconveniently placed," [...] Captain Truck dryly remarked as he {{witnessed}} this manoeuvre.

60|$|He {{got away}} from Lanfear with these hopeless words, and again Lanfear {{perceived}} that the case was left wholly to him. His consolation was the charm of the girl's companionship, the delight of a nature knowing itself from moment to moment as if newly created. For her, as nearly as he could put the fact into words, the actual moment contained {{the past and the}} future as well as the present. When he saw in her the persistence of an exquisite personality independent of the means by which he realized his own continuous identity, he sometimes felt as if in the presence of some angel so long freed from earthly allegiance that it had left all record behind, <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> here the records of our first years. If an echo of the past reached her, it was apt to be trivial and insignificant, like those unimportant experiences of our remotest childhood, which remain to us from a world outlived.|$|E
60|$|We emerge at last into a broad silent sea. It is the llano de Espiritu Santo. As {{the wind}} {{whistles}} by me, piling the shallower fresh water into mimic waves, I go back, in fancy, {{to the long}} ride of October over that boundless plain, and recall the sharp outlines of the distant hills which are now lost in the lowering clouds. The men are rowing silently, and I find my mind, released from its tension, growing benumbed and depressed as then. The water, too, is getting more shallow <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> {{the banks of the}} creek, and with my hand dipped listlessly over the thwarts, I detect the tops of chimisal, which shows the tide to have somewhat fallen. There is a black mound, bearing {{to the north of the}} line of alder, making an adverse current, which, as we sweep to the right to avoid it, I recognize. We pull close alongside, and I call to the men to stop.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, when my force comes up. There is no {{question}} but that the enemy is making the attack on our flotilla to cover his designs on Washington. He can have the fleet if he comes thus far. I hope by daylight {{to be on the}} march for the Wood Yard, where Winder is encamped, and count to take with me all the men that can be spared, for force enough will be left behind to destroy the fleet in case the enemy appears. Lieutenant Frazier is {{to be in charge of}} those who remain here, and you will act as his second in command. This is my plan: You shall have seventy men or more, and as soon <b>as</b> <b>we</b> <b>leave</b> you will make every craft ready for the torch; see to it that there are combustibles on board in sufficient quantity to insure a clean job when fire is applied. After that has been done, you will wait for the British. Once it becomes certain that you cannot save the fleet, start your fires, and put out for the American army, which will likely be near Washington by that time." ...|$|E

These guys were notorious for starting riots, {{not because they}} were instigators (they were all pretty passive and shy guys), but because their music was so high energy people would loose sic their minds. As a matter of factly the last time I saw them <b>as</b> <b>we</b> were <b>leaving</b> cause things were right out of control the riot squad was showing up to gain some order." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{had come}} to talk with Miss Mavis because she was attractive, but I had been rather {{conscious}} {{of the absence of}} a good topic, not feeling at liberty to revert to Mr. Porterfield. She hadn't encouraged me, when I spoke to her <b>as</b> <b>we</b> were <b>leaving</b> Boston, to go on with the history of my acquaintance with this gentleman; and yet now, unexpectedly, she appeared to imply--it was doubtless one of the disparities mentioned by Mrs. Nettlepoint--that he might be glanced at without indelicacy.|$|R
