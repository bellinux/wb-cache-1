5|$|Planning of {{the airport}} ran {{parallel}} with five other regional airports: Fagernes Airport, Leirin; Førde Airport, Bringeland; Mosjøen Airport, Kjærstad; Rørvik Airport, Ryum and Røst <b>Airport.</b> <b>Construction</b> {{was approved by the}} Parliament of Norway on 10 April 1984 and construction began in 1985. The municipality was granted concession to operate the airport on 22 August 1985. Værøy and Røst Airports were opened on 1 June 1986, after NOK15 million had been spent on constructing Værøy Airport.|$|E
5|$|Since the crash, {{there have}} been several other {{accidents}} involving reverse thrust. A Douglas DC-8 operating United Airlines Flight 859 crashed in 1961 when the first officer attempted to reverse all four engines during the landing roll. The left engines remained in forward thrust, while the right engines went into reverse, causing the aircraft to veer rapidly to the right and collide with <b>airport</b> <b>construction</b> vehicles, killing 17 of the 122 people aboard and 1 person on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The railway past Værnes {{opened on}} 27 October 1902 as the Hell–Sunnan Line—today {{part of the}} Nordland Line. The plans for a railway station in the {{terminal}} of Værnes were launched in 1990, along with the {{plans to build a}} second terminal at the <b>airport.</b> <b>Construction</b> of the new terminal started on 1 October 1992. On 15 March 1993, NSB announced that they would start a commuter train service between Steinkjer and Melhus, south of Trondheim. The service would give a half-hour headway during peak hours between Stjørdal and Melhus, and a one-hour headway onwards to Steinkjer. NSB stated that the concept was based on the success of the Jæren Commuter Rail and that they hoped to have a 70% increase in ridership, in part due to the opening of the airport station. The concept would also take advantage of expansion of Trondheim Central Station that would co-locate the main coach- and train terminals in Trondheim. The service would also give direct services along the Dovre Line to Oppdal and the Røros Line to Tynset. Estimates were that the railway would capture a 10% ground transport market share. The commuter rail service started on 1 September 1993.|$|E

25|$|It {{was built}} to replace Allegheny County Airport, which was closer to Pittsburgh but too small to handle the growing {{passenger}} traffic. The new <b>airport</b> <b>construction</b> began in 1946, with the airport opening in 1952. Over the decades, passenger traffic increased for the airport, especially as US Airways developed it as a major hub and expanded its services both domestically and internationally. Additional runways were added or lengthened and changes made in the terminal. Traffic continued to increase.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to providing aid for food and shelter, New Deal {{programs such as the}} Public Works Administration employed thousands of St. Louisans. Civic improvement bond issues for <b>airport</b> <b>construction</b> and the remainder of the 1923 bond issue construction program also contributed to lowering unemployment. Another bond issue for improvements came in 1934, providing funds for city beautification and renovations on civic buildings, reducing the number of persons on direct relief aid to 35,000 in 1936 from more than 100,000 in 1933.|$|E

25|$|The {{airlines}} Braathens SAFE and Widerøe both {{launched an}} alternative proposal whereby the government instead should build {{a network of}} short take-off and landing airports. When Håkon Kyllingmark was appointed Minister of Transport and Communications in 1965, he placed the primary <b>airport</b> <b>construction</b> plan on hold and instead focused on construction of regional airports. This caused local interest for airports at Kvæfjordeidet and Vidrek to resume, after initiative from Widerøe. Several commercial interest organizations in Narvik supported an airport at Vidrek, while their Harstad counterparts supported an airport at Evenes. Narvik Municipal Council continued to support Evenes until it was instead proposed as a regional airport. It voted in February 1968 to continue to support Evenes as a primary airport, but also work for a local airport in Narvik.|$|E
25|$|Parliament {{voted on}} 8 June 1988 {{to build the}} new {{national}} airport at Hurum. The decision included a four-lane motorway-crossing of the Oslofjord. The Public Roads Administration published six alternatives for a crossing, including four bridge alternatives, a conventional tunnel and an immersed tube. Planning halted in 1990 after the <b>airport</b> <b>construction</b> decision was shelved. By then only the Socialist Left Party in Hurum Municipal Council being opposed. Without the airport traffic, the profitability in the project fell through and the Public Roads Administration called to instead prioritize other investments. However, Minister of Transport and Communications Kjell Opseth was a staunch supporter of the Oslofjord Link, in part as a compensation {{for the loss of}} the airport after it in 1992 was decided to be built at Gardermoen.|$|E
25|$|The Federal Bureau of Investigation {{investigated}} Brown {{when he was}} Speaker. One {{investigation was}} a sting operation concerning a fake fish company attempting to bribe Brown; he was not charged with any criminal act. The FBI further investigated Brown from 1998 to 2003 over his appointees at the Airport Commission for potential conflicts of interests. Brown friend, contributor, and former law client, Charlie Walker was given a share of city contracts. He had served jail time in 1984 for violating laws concerning minority contracting. The FBI also investigated Brown's approval of expansion of Sutro Tower and SFO. Scott Company, with one prominent Brown backer, was accused of using a phony minority front company to secure an <b>airport</b> <b>construction</b> project. Robert Nurisso was sentenced to house arrest. During Brown's administration, there were two convictions of city officials tied to Brown.|$|E
