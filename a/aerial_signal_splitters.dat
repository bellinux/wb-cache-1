40|$|In this work, three {{strategies}} for shortening the output pulse of a silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) are reported. The first strategy is passive filtering, where band-pass filtering removes the lowest frequency {{components in the}} signal, getting a noticeable reduction in pulse width (a compression ratio of 10 : 1 was obtained). In the second place, a reflectometric scheme is proposed where the amplified signal coming from the SiPM is injected into a <b>signal</b> <b>splitter</b> with one of its stubs connected to a short-circuited stub. In the last strategy, the reflectometric part is replaced by an analog subtractor circuit. In this approach, a <b>signal</b> <b>splitter</b> with stubs of different lengths is used. All solutions provide good compression ratios, up to 10 : 1. Best pulses obtained are single narrow peaks, with width below 10 ns, preserving the photonic modulation and with good pseudo-Gaussian shape, single polarity and low ringing. The potential of pulse shortening for improving the capability of the detector to resolve single photons is demonstrated by mean of single photon counting patterns. The detection error probability is reduced in one order of magnitude when shortening is used for conditioning the output photosignal...|$|R

40|$|Important {{requirements}} of a millimetre-wave heterodyne receiver for radio astronomy are that it can detect dual-linear polarisation and retain both upper and lower sidebands. One such arrangement, {{referred to as a}} sideband-separating (2 SB) layout, uses a 900 phase shift on either the LO or signal path before mixing, and the upper and lower sidebands are separated into unique IF outputs once orthogonally re-combined. There is continuing interest to build arrays of heterodyne receivers and part of the challenge is to fit all of the receiver components within a given volume. To realise dual-linear polarisation and 2 SB within receiver arrays, a new, more compact approach must be taken. Integrating a turnstile as the <b>signal</b> <b>splitter</b> reduces overall layout space and provides excellent polarisation isolation. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R

30|$|SWIPT system {{combined}} with full duplex (FD) has advantages including {{the increase of}} spectral efficiency. In contrast to the conventional FD system where self-interference (SI) is harmful, SI can be beneficial in terms of energy source for harvesting in FD SWIPT system [6 – 10]. A number of studies using this advantage were performed for FD relay system where relay has no external power supply except for transmitted power from base station (BS) [7, 8, 10]. Also, the self-energy recycling (S-ER) scheme was proposed in point-to-point (P 2 P) FD system where PS-based EH is used at user equipment (UE) [9]. In general, the performance of PS SWIPT scheme is better than that of TS SWIPT scheme, because TS SWIPT scheme can {{be treated as a}} special case of PS SWIPT scheme with binary split power ratios [4, 11]. However, in contrast to TS receiver where a device requires only a simple switcher, PS receiver needs an RF <b>signal</b> <b>splitter</b> and its structure is relatively complicate [4, 12]. This means that TS-based SWIPT scheme is more applicable to UE than PS-based SWIPT scheme since the structure of UE needs to be simple.|$|R
50|$|Both sign-offs and sign-ons {{have become}} less {{common with the}} {{increasing}} prevalence of twenty-four hours a day, {{seven days a week}} broadcasting. They are, however, still conducted by a number of stations around the world, often by stations catering to small-markets or those in less developed countries, or when stations need to shut down for transmitter maintenance. Another consideration for whether providers shutdown is power consumption; <b>aerial</b> <b>signals,</b> such as those for UHF analog TV transmissions, can require tens of thousands of watts of power, making electricity a major expense, while power consumption would usually be considerably lower for cable and satellite providers. In relation to costs, viewer numbers are also a consideration. Another consideration is the licence issued by the government which indicates when their transmitters can be operated.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. It is very {{important}} to detect fiber orientation error in orthotropic composite laminates because the layup of a CFRP (carbon-fiber reinforced plastics) composite laminates affects the properties of the laminate, including stiffness, strength and thermal behavior. In this study, an investigation of shear wave ultrasonic technique was carried out in order to detect stacking orientation error for the orthotropic composite laminates. During testing, the most significant problem is that the couplant conditions do not remain the same because of changing the viscosity of the couplant. Therefore, the design and use of a shear wave transducers would greatly aid in alleviating the couplant problem. A pyramid with an isosceles triangle with two 45 o was made of aluminum to generate shear waves using two longitudinal transducers based on ultrasonic-polarized mechanism. Also, the <b>signal</b> <b>splitter</b> was connected to the pulser jack on the pulser/receiver and to the longitudinal transducers which were mounted with mineral oil. The shear transducer was mounted on the bottom as a receiver with burnt honey. It is found that the shear wave was generated at a maximum and a minimum based on the ultrasonic-polarized mechanism. Finally, test results with model data were compared for a fiber orientation of the laminates...|$|R

30|$|The {{dimensioning}} {{process is}} based on [5] supplemented with desk research and discussion with partners internal to the RAILS consortium. We illustrate the dimensioning process for WAPs, the antenna system and network support. The typical number of WAPs per carriage is two but this can {{vary depending on the}} layout and length of the carriage. The number of WAPs is also dependent on the expected service demand. The threshold for a decent connection will vary according to the bandwidth demand per user. When the number of connecting passengers is above this threshold, the service operator should consider adding an extra WAP. Based on expert opinion, we estimate that an industrial grade WAP can support 60 concurrent connections of 1 MB. For the case considered, 2 WAPs per rail car will be sufficient. A train will typically install several antennas which each make an individual connection to the wayside. Per train, eight antennas will be installed. For each antenna, a <b>signal</b> <b>splitter</b> is required, a transmitter radio and a receiver radio. Network support is provided by a manned network operations center. The QoS service drivers require that network support should be available during the whole time the train fleet is active. As such, a minimum of two full-time employees (FTEs) are needed. These can support a total of five services.|$|R

40|$|High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) Inner Tracker designs {{may include}} {{the sharing of}} Timing, Trigger and Control (TTC) signals between several tracker modules. This is {{possible}} because the highest frequency signals are common to all modules. Such designs are an attractive option because they {{reduce the number of}} optical links required and hence the cost. These designs will require optical <b>signal</b> <b>splitters</b> that are radiation hard up to high doses and capable of operating in cold temperatures. Optical splitters are available as either fused-fibre splitters or Planar Lightwave Circuit (PLC) splitters. PLC splitters are preferable because they are smaller than fusedfibre splitters. A selection of PLC splitters from different manufacturers and of two different technologies (silica and glass based) have been tested for radiation hardness up to a dose of 500 kGy(Si) and for temperature stability. All the tested splitters displayed small increases in insertion losses (< 0. 1 dB) in reducing the operating temperature from 25 °C to ? 25 °C. The silica based splitters from all manufacturers did not exhibit significant radiation induced insertion losses, despite the high dose they were exposed to. The glass based sample, however, had a per channel radiation induced insertion loss of up to 1. 16 dB. Whilst the silica based splitters can be considered as qualified for HL-LHC use with regards to radiation hardness, the glass technology would require further testing at a lower, more realistic, dose to also be considered as a potential component for HL-LHC upgrade designs. © 2011 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA...|$|R
