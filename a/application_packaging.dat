50|$|Even {{though the}} DML as an {{authorised}} store for media implies {{a degree of}} centralisation, Local Media Libraries (LMLs) will be {{required in order to}} achieve a global model. In this way, release and deployment of physical instances of media can be achieved in country in a timely manner by avoiding constant downloads over the global network. Replication of authorised media in non-prime windows would make required packages available locally as required, but the DML would remain as ‘master’ for process control reasons. The DML/LML hierarchy is synonymous with the master/secondary distribution layers seen within many distribution technologies and package management systems. However, whereas distribution tools tend to be biased towards a particular technology stack (e.g. Wintel, Unix, Mainframe etc), one of the main benefits of a DML is its technology-agnostic nature and a true central store for all authorised software. In this way, the distribution tools would connect to the DML to obtain the software package. <b>Application</b> <b>packaging</b> involves the preparation of standard, structured software installations targeted for automated deployment. Packaging is also required for bought-in (COTS) software, as packaging allows software to be configured to run efficiently on a particular platform or environment. Even a slight change in this platform (such as the swapping-out of disk) can prevent a package from successfully deploying so retention of the raw media (ISO) version of software is critical as this will be needed (often in an emergency) should the packaged version no longer deploy e.g. following the upgrade or replacement of the operating platform.|$|E

Packaging reduces the total cost of ownership (TCO) for the customers by enabling them to efficiently install and configure the applications. This results in an application package, which provides the product with newer capabilities like advertising features without installing them, installing products on demand, add user customizations etc. Now a days there is new development in this technology i. e., Application virtualization which has been introduced.

40|$|Scania {{is one of}} the world’s leading {{manufacturers}} of heavy trucks and buses. It also manufactures engines for motive power of heavy vehicles, marine, and general industrial applications. A common challenge for Scania today is to reduce lead-times caused by the <b>application</b> <b>packaging</b> and distribution process associated with client-server applications in. NET. Another problem caused by the client-server architecture is data inconsistency that may occur between an outdated client and its corresponding database. This Master’s Thesis evaluates technologies that might help in solving these problems. The technologies are ClickOnce, Windows Terminal Server, an “initiation program” and a web application. The evaluation is based on prototypes  of the different technologies. The prototypes  are implemented, tested and compared to one another in terms of advantages and disadvantages, and also in terms of cost-effectiveness and risks that may affect the business. The work is based on an applicable case - a specific client-server application developed in. NET that struggles with the problems mentioned. The prototypes  are applied on this specific application in order to test their effectiveness. The conclusion suggests “best practice” solutions to the problems for each of three different scenarios.

40|$|Within {{the policy}} {{supporting}} project "New market-oriented sustainable protein concepts" (BO- 08 - 018. 03 - 002), a literature study is performed to healthy fish alternatives. The research question was: "What is the nutritional importance of fish consumption, what are alternatives to fish, are there technological and legal barriers, {{and what are}} the limits for enrichment with nutritional components?" From a health perspective stimulation of fish consumption is desired, fish is a major supplier of the omega- 3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, and the present consumption of fish is too low to meet the nutritional recommendations for these fatty acids (Health Council: 450 mg/day, EFSA: 250 mg/day). The Health Council’s recommendation to eat fish twice a week provides health benefits, but is also ecologically unfavourable, because it is a threat for wild fish stocks. This report focuses on alternative sources for the supply of these fish oil fatty acids. In a previous report the Health Council concluded that alternative sources of fish oil fatty acids (such as certain meats, shrimp and krill) and alternatives to fish oil fatty acids (alphalinolenic acid from certain plants) were not regarded as options that could serve as good substitutes for fish oil fatty acids. We agree with this conclusion: at the moment we too cannot indicate suitable alternatives to fish which are applicable immediately. But there are some potential alternatives with perspective in the future. These mainly concern certain types of algae, transgenic oil crops and insects. The study of these sources is on-going. Micro-algae and transgenic oil crops are not primarily intended for human consumption as such, but as a source for the extraction of oil to be used for human consumption. The extracted oil can be used as an additive {{in a wide range of}} food products. The extracted oil or the micro-algae and transgenic oil crops as such can also be used in feed, in this way providing meat, milk, eggs and cultured fish enriched in EPA and DHA. Insects are both intended for human consumption and for feed. During extraction, <b>application,</b> <b>packaging</b> and storage much attention should be paid to the prevention of oxidative degradation of fish oil fatty acids. Due to their susceptibility to oxidation, the use of enriched products as a source of fish oil fatty acids is a major challenge and may be restrictive for the quantity that can be added to a food product. The potential alternatives mentioned before will have to comply with law and regulations regarding their use in foods, including the Novel Food Regulation in case of human food products. Furthermore, when used as feed and in food of animal origin Regulation 183 / 2005 and Regulation 853 / 2004 of the hygiene package must be met...|$|E
40|$|Summary of Changes New API and Use of Proper Datatypes This release adds a new {{versioned}} API {{for adding}} new trait data and for querying most all data. It updates measurement and statistical data {{to use the}} proper datatypes and adds and modifies many features to make maintenance of BETYdb easier. Administrators {{need to do a}} database migration. See "Database Changes" below. New API A new API (version v 0) has been added for obtaining data in both JSON and XML formats. The new API also supports insertion of new trait data (provided in either JSON or XML format), something not provided by previous APIs. Documentation of this API is forthcoming. (A brief introduction is given in some of the comments to GitHub issues [URL] and [URL] New Features Docker files for <b>application</b> <b>packaging</b> Docker files have been added. Travis A Travis configuration file has been added in order to hook BETYdb into the Travis CI continuous integration service. This service will automatically run all of the non-Javascript based RSpec tests each time a new commit is pushed to GitHub. New and Modified Rake Tasks A new Rake task bety:db:populate has been added {{to make it easier for}} developers to get a new BETYdb instance up and running or to get a fresh copy of the BETYdb database. This is a wrapper for Pecan's load. bety. sh script and replaces the wrapper script update-betydb. sh for most use-cases relevant to the BETYdb developer. db:test:load_structure has been modified to behave correctly when using the postgis adapter. It will now drop the test database if it exists and then recreate it and load the database schema defined by the *_structure. sql file corresponding to the current environment. This makes it easier to set up the test database for testing, even if the other databases have not been set up. A description has been added for the Rake task db:test:clone_structure. The task db:fixtures:load has been disabled for all but the test environment. This will help prevent data loss caused by inadvertently running it in the wrong environment. The db:create task now only creates the database corresponding to the current environment. (When Rails. env was "development", it used to also create the test database. Though perhaps useful, this seemed counterintuitive.) Bug Fixes Some missing model associations have been added. This should facilitate getting useful information from related tables via an API call. The script script/update-betydb. sh has been updated to make it consistend with the load. bety. sh script from the Pecan repository, for which it serves as a wrapper. Some fixes have been made to the Add-SQL-Geometry Python script (script/buildSQLGeom. py). A bug has been fixed in the header-normalization routine of the Bulk Upload wizard whereby any header (e. g. a trait name) containing the consecutive letters 'se' was getting capitalized. Now only the string 'se' itself is normalized (to 'SE'—Standard Error). Steps Needed for Upgrade Database Changes Administrators need to do database migrations! The migration ChangeNumericsToFloats changes the datatype of all columns that were previously arbitrary precision numbers of type NUMERIC(16, 4) into double precision floating-point types. The columns in question are those used to represent values of trait, covariate, and yield measurements and the values of associated statistics (and also the parameter columns in the priors table). This helps to make the number of significant digits recordable for a particular measurement independent of the unit used for recording the measurement. Moreover, as the PostgreSQL documentation points out, "arithmetic on numeric values is very slow compared [...] . to the floating-point types", so using floating-point types represents an improvement if computational features of SQL are to be used. The database version for this release is 20160303221049. Gem Installation Administrators need to run the bundler to install new Ruby Gems related to the new API. Status of RSpec Tests All tests continue to pass when run in the default environment and can be run using the command bundle exec rspec Pass/failure status of the latest commits to GitHub are now shown at [URL] Only the non-JavaScript based tests are run by Travis. To check the others, run bundle exec rspec -t js Complete details for running the rspec tests are on the updated Wiki page at [URL]...|$|E
