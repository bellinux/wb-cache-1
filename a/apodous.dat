50|$|The larva is <b>apodous</b> and eucephalic, cylindrical, {{very long}} and thin, and with tapered ends. The {{integument}} is smooth, white, or pink. The head capsule is well developed, but narrower than the other regions.|$|E
50|$|The larva is <b>apodous,</b> {{cylindrical}} and elongated, {{more or less}} flattened dorso-ventrally and tapered at the cephalic and caudal ends. The colour {{is white}} or yellowish. The head is small, rugged, dark pigmented and hypognathous, the abdomen is composed of 8 apparent urites, with the last two often fused and more or less reduced. The respiratory system is amphineustic, with two pairs of spiracles, one thoracic and one abdominal. There are also rudimentary and nonfunctional stigmas in other abdominal segments.|$|E
50|$|The egg is oval-shaped, {{white or}} yellowish. The larva is <b>apodous,</b> {{cylindrical}} and tapering at both ends. The {{length of the}} last instar larva is, as a rule, {{in the order of}} 2-3 mm. The tracheal system is metapneustic in the first instar early age and amphipneustic in the subsequent stages. The pupa is variable, from barrel shaped, to a more elongated shape. The outer surface can segmentation and is more or less smooth or wrinkled. The color varies from black to brown to yellowish white.|$|E
5000|$|The Diptera larva is <b>apodous</b> (with no legs), but sometimes, {{especially}} in aquatic larvae, has appendages similar to pseudopodia. The head is usually devoid of eyes, has chewing mouthparts, modified antennae {{with up to}} six segments, more or less developed or reduced to papillae. The head can be : clearly distinguished from the thorax (eucephalic larvae), indistinct {{from the rest of}} the body (microcephalic) or sunken in the thorax (cryptocephalic). Depending on the number and position of the tracheal spiracles, the following types of breathing apparatus can be distinguished.|$|E
50|$|J.W. Truman and L.M. Riddiford, in 1999, revitalized the {{precocious}} eclosion {{theory with}} a focus on endocrine control of metamorphosis. They postulated that hemimetabolan species hatch after three embryonic 'moults' into a nymphal form similar to the adult, whereas holometabolan species hatch after only two embryonic 'moults' into vermiform larvae that are very different from the adult. In 2005, however, B Konopova and J Zrzavý reported ultrastructural studies across a wide range of hemimetabolan and holometabolan species and showed that the embryo of all species in both groups produce three cuticular depositions. The only exception was the Diptera Cyclorrhapha (unranked taxon of ‘high’ Dipterans, within the infraorder Muscomorpha, which includes the highly studied D. melanogaster) which has two embryonic cuticles, most likely due to secondary loss of the third. Critics of the precocious eclosion theory also argue that the larval forms of holometabolans are very often more specialized than those of hemimetabolans. X. Bellés illustrates that the maggot of a fruitfly “cannot be envisaged as a vermiform and <b>apodous</b> (legless) creature that hatched in an early embryonic stage.” It is in fact extremely specialized: for example, the cardiostipes and dististipes of the mouth are fused, as in some mosquitoes, and these parts are also fused to the mandibles and thus form the typical mouth hooks of fly larvae. Maggots are also secondarily, and not primitively, <b>apodous.</b> They are more derived and specialized than the cockroach nymph, a comparable and characteristic hemimetabolan example.|$|E
5000|$|Larvae may {{be either}} aquatic or terrestrial. In regards to {{nutrition}} {{they may be}} saprophagous, mycophagous, or predatory.The larva is <b>apodous</b> and eucephalic and cylindrical-fusiform, depressed dorso-ventrally and distinctly segmented. The size of the mature larva is variable, depending on the species, from less than 1 cm in length up to 3-5 cm. The head is much narrower than the thorax and partially sunken into it. The integument is strongly sclerotized with the cuticle containing inclusions of calcium carbonate with hexagonal crystals which form a characteristic micro-sculpture. In aquatic species, the last urite is thin and more or less elongated forming a breathing tube which ends with a tuft of waterproofing bristles. It is used to draw air from the surface, the larva remaining submerged.|$|E

40|$|Cascolus ravitis gen. et sp. nov. is a three-dimensionally {{preserved}} fossil crustacean {{with soft}} parts from the Herefordshire (Silurian) Lagerstätte, UK. It {{is characterized by}} a head with a head shield and five limb pairs, and a thorax (pereon) with nine appendage-bearing segments followed by an <b>apodous</b> abdomen (pleon). All the appendages except the first are biramous and have a gnathobase. The post-mandibular appendages are similar one to another, and bear petal-shaped epipods that probably functioned {{as a part of the}} respiratory–circulatory system. Cladistic analysis resolves the new taxon as a stem-group leptostracan (Malacostraca).

40|$|An {{overview}} of the anamorphic development of Apfelbeckia insculpta is provided. As in other myriapods and arthropods, this period {{of the life cycle}} includes different stages that are separated by molts. Based on an earlier description of post-embryogenesis of A. insculpta and on our data, we describe ten stadia that occur after juveniles of our focal species hatch from the egg. Each molt is accompanied by the addition of podous and <b>apodous</b> pleurotergites, leg-pairs and ocelli. Thus, the numbers of these structures can be used as reliable criteria for the separation of post-embryonic stadia in A. insculpta. Adulthood is reached through teloanamorphosis, i. e., with the ninth and last molt individuals become sexually mature and achieve adulthood. Sexes can be distinguished from stadium VIII onward.

40|$|Abstract: The Ms. 4504 of the Bibliothèque Mazarine in Paris contains, {{on the one}} hand, five printed {{copies of}} the “Peregrinació del Venturós Pelegrí” ab les “Cobles de la Mort” and, on the other hand, a partial hand-written copy of the Venturós Pelegrí with an {{incomplete}} French translation by Josep Tastu (1787 - 1849), who compiled all the materials of this volume. Apart from presenting the general content of the ms. 4504, we describe in detail the five editions with particular emphasis on the oldest one, probably dating from the mid-sixteenth century or shortly thereafter. This printed book, now acephalous and <b>apodous,</b> in which the lines {{go all the way}} across the page, still preserves three woodcuts.

The present {{work is a}} confirmatory study to indicate the identity of this species in the ephemeral freshwater bodies in Taif, KSA and to ascertain that, {{if there is any}} other Triops species in the same area or not. Four sites were investigated in Taif governorate; Wadi Al-Arj, Saysed, Jabajeb pool and Ghadeer Al-Banat. The animal was {{not recorded}} in the first two sites all the year. The specimens were collected from Jabajeb pool on Al-Hada road and Ghadeer Al-Banat at Al-Roddaf region. No specimens were found in these sites during winter and autumn but they start in late spring and summer. One hundred and seven specimens were collected from both sites in this period. The animal was morphologically described to be distinguished from the other large branchiopods species. The supra-anal plate is absent, the dorsal organ of the present species is rounded, second maxilla is present, no supernumerary spines on <b>apodous</b> rings, the carina of T. c. simplex is smooth without spines in front of its terminal spine and presence of small spines on the furca...|$|E
