25|$|Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama congratulated Trump, {{while also}} taking the {{opportunity}} to emphasise that action on climate change is a priority for Fiji: Fiji has {{a close relationship with}} the United States <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to working with you and your administration in the months and years ahead. We especially seek America's support in our struggle against the extreme weather events and rising sea levels caused by climate change, which pose a particular threat to the Pacific islands and other low lying areas of the world. We also look forward to working with you to protect our oceans and seas from the threat of pollution and overfishing. With every best wish as you prepare to assume the presidency.|$|E
500|$|The most {{well-documented}} early European {{team was}} founded by activist Nettie Honeyball in England in 1894. It was named the British Ladies' Football Club. Nettie Honeyball is quoted, [...] "I founded the association late last year , with the fixed resolve of proving {{to the world that}} women are not the 'ornamental and useless' creatures men have pictured. I must confess, my convictions on all matters where the sexes are so widely divided are all on the side of emancipation, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to the time when ladies may sit in Parliament and have a voice in the direction of affairs, especially those which concern them most." [...] Honeyball and those like her paved the way for women's football. However, the women's game was frowned upon by the British football associations, and continued without their support. It has been suggested that this was motivated by a perceived threat to the 'masculinity' of the game.|$|E

We parted on very good terms, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to working with them again." [...] Jenkins felt she could not have made a good film [...] "out of Thor 2 because I wasn’t the right director... I could have made a great Thor if I could have done the story that I was wanting to do. But I don’t think I was the right person to make a great Thor out of the story they wanted to do." [...] Jenkins had {{intended}} to create a film based on the premise of Romeo and Juliet, where Jane was stuck on Earth with Thor forbidden to come save her. After Thor eventually does travel to Earth, he and Jane would have discovered that Malekith was [...] "hiding the dark energy inside of Earth because he knows that Odin doesn't care about Earth, and so he's using Odin's disinterest in Earth to trick him." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> started <b>and</b> {{a little}} exclamation of {{pleasure}} escaped me. There was no man whom I longed {{so much to}} see. What a reputation was his! A scholar of European fame, a poet, and a great sinner; a Croesus; at times a reckless Sybarite, at others an ascetic and a hermit; a student of Voltaire; the founder of a new school of philosophy. All these things I had heard of him at different times, but as yet I had never seen him. Something more than my curiosity had been excited <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> now to its gratification.|$|R

I'm {{a product of the}} Lancashire system, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to leading a very talented squad of players to future success".

60|$|Towards the {{beginning}} of June 1843, orders arrived from headquarters, appointing me to spend the approaching winter at York Factory, the place where I had first pressed American soil. It is impossible to describe the joy with which I received the news. Whether it was my extreme fondness for travelling, or the mere love of change, I cannot tell, but it had certainly the effect of affording me immense delight, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> set about making preparation for the journey immediately. The arrival of the canoes from Canada {{was to be the}} signal for my departure, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> to their appearance with great impatience.|$|R
2500|$|Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, whose {{organization}} Trump {{has said}} was [...] "obsolete" [...] during the campaign, said:US leadership {{is as important}} as ever. Our Alliance has brought together America's closest friends in times of peace and of conflict for almost 70 years. A strong NATO is good for the United States, and good for Europe. We face a challenging new security environment, including hybrid warfare, cyber attacks, the threat of terrorism. NATO has responded with determination to the new security situation. But we have more work to do. <b>And</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to meeting Mr. Trump soon, and welcoming him to Brussels for the NATO Summit next year to discuss the way forward.|$|E

60|$|Altogether, I {{was very}} nervous and anxious all this time, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> to Sarah's {{communications}} with feverish eagerness. I felt {{that to me}} far more depended on the discovery of this will than the mere matter of money. It was not the question of wealth or the reverse, it was--a life of happiness with Percy, or one of solitary unhappiness. Had {{it not been for}} the search Sarah was making, which kept hope alive, I should have felt it even more than I did. But when the secret spring was found, I did begin to think that all would come right again.|$|R

2500|$|In December 2010, {{while still}} serving as governor, Richardson {{returned}} to North Korea in an unofficial capacity {{at the invitation}} of the North's chief nuclear negotiator Kim Kye Gwan.

2500|$|At the 2006 U.S. Open, {{played on}} the West course of the Winged Foot Golf Club, Montgomerie had yet another chance to win his first major championship. He {{stood in the middle}} of the 18th fairway in the final round having sunk a 50-foot birdie putt on the 17th green, which put him in the joint lead with Phil Mickelson. While waiting in {{position}} on the 18th fairway for the group in front to finish, Montgomerie switched his club from a 6-iron to a 7-iron, assuming adrenaline would kick in. Once the wait was over, he hit the approach shot poorly, ending up short and right of the green, in thick rough. He pitched onto the green, and then three-putted from 30 feet to lose the tournament by one stroke. After the loss, Montgomerie said, [...] "At my age I've got to think positively. I'm 43 next week, and it's nice I can come back to this tournament and do well again, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to coming back here again next year and trying another U.S. Open disaster."

2500|$|In October 2009, a new {{agreement}} was made which allows Scottish Gaelic {{to be used}} formally between Scottish Government ministers and European Union officials. The deal was signed by Britain's representative to the EU, Sir Kim Darroch, and the Scottish government. [...] This does not give Scottish Gaelic official status in the EU, but gives it {{the right to be}} a means of formal communications in the EU's institutions. The Scottish government will {{have to pay for the}} translation from Gaelic to other European languages. The deal was received positively in Scotland; Secretary of State for Scotland Jim Murphy said the move was a strong sign of the UK government's support for Gaelic. He said that [...] "Allowing Gaelic speakers to communicate with European institutions in their mother tongue is a progressive step forward and one which should be welcomed". Culture Minister Mike Russell said that [...] "this is a significant step forward for the recognition of Gaelic both at home and abroad <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to addressing the council in Gaelic very soon.

[...] June Brown revealed that she had been asking producers to bring Altman back to the soap for 6 or 7 years, as the two of them share such a good working relationship. After spending time in Walsall, Cotton returns; walking normally again, and he is accompanied by his seven-year-old daughter, Dotty. He explained that he had met Dotty's mother Sandy while living in a squat, and that she was an alcoholic who had recently died, leaving him with custody of Dotty. Altman explained: [...] "Nick needed something, because I think if he didn’t have little Dotty, for him to walk through that door, she would just have treated him as a complete outcast." [...] The actor described other changes to his character since his last appearance, detailing how he had become a plumber, begun dressing more smartly, stopped gelling his hair back and no longer wore an earring.|$|E

Runi was absent, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> <b>looked</b> <b>forward</b> to his return with no little apprehension; he would doubtless decide my fate. Kua-ko was also away. The others sat or stood about the great room, staring at me in silence. I took no notice, but merely asked for food, then for my hammock, which I hung up in the old place, <b>and</b> lying down <b>I</b> fell into a doze. Runi made his appearance at dusk. <b>I</b> rose <b>and</b> greeted him, but he spoke no word and, until he went to his hammock, sat in sullen silence, ignoring my presence.|$|R
