25|$|The {{military}} postal {{experience of}} the Crimea <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> learnt from the Indian Army encouraged the British Army to seriously review the arrangements {{for the provision of}} a postal service to the troops in the field. There were two opinions; firstly, that the Army run its own services as in the Peninsular War. Secondly, that civilians from the Post Office be responsible for the service as in the Crimean and Indian Army example.|$|E
25|$|Indeed, as {{a result}} of the war <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> that were learned about the {{potential}} of airpower in the region, following the war, the Chief of the Air Staff, Sir Hugh Trenchard, proposed controlling the frontier by air power alone. This plan had proved highly successful in Mesopotamia, Aden and the Transjordan, however, due to the uniqueness of the North-West Frontier and also due to inter-service politics the plan was not accepted until later. In 1937, it was eventually decided that should another war break out with Afghanistan, or in the event of a major tribal uprising, the RAF would take the offensive, while the ground forces would act defensively.|$|E
25|$|After {{completion}} at Burbank, the CL-475 {{was taken}} to Rosamond Lake on Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert for testing. It was first flown on 2 November 1959, but the pilot reported severe vibrations. For six months, Lockheed experimented with three and four-bladed wooden rotors, but stability was finally achieved by using metal blades in a three-blade configuration {{and the addition of}} a gyroscopic control ring connected directly to the swashplate. In the mid-1960s, the helicopter was test flown by a number of government and military agencies and the military. The stability offered by the rigid rotor control system made the helicopter easy to fly, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> learned from the CL-475 rigid rotor were later used to develop the XH-51 and AH-56A Cheyenne.|$|E

25|$|Following the 2011 Fukushima I nuclear {{accidents}} Chris Huhne, Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, {{wrote to}} Dr Mike Weightman, {{head of the}} HSE's Nuclear Directorate, on March 12, asking for a report 'on {{the implications of the}} situation <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lessons</b> to be learned for the UK nuclear industry. The report is to be delivered within 6 months, with an interim report by mid-May, 'prepared in close cooperation with the International nuclear community and other nuclear safety regulators'. On March 15, Huhne expressed regret that some European politicians were 'rushing to judgement' before assessments had been carried out, and said that it was too early to determine whether the willingness of the private sector to invest in new nuclear plants would be affected. In the wake of the accident the Government was criticised for having colluded with EDF Energy, Areva and Westinghouse in order to manage communications and maintain public support for nuclear power.|$|E

500|$|FIS President Kasper {{stated that}} the first test weekend of 8–9 February 2008 [...] "went well" [...] in terms of sports organization.

A spring coordination meeting was held the week of 7 April 2008 that discussed preparations for the event. Among the participants were FIS, the EBU, and marketing partner APF, whom focused on {{lessons learned from the}} test events held in February 2008. Coordination group members were pleased in what transpired during the February 2008 test events, including an athletes village that was constructed at the local university. Final competition schedule was confirmed by the FIS Council in its May 2008 meeting in Cape Town, followed by a final inspection on 13 October 2008. Following the final inspection that day, a six-hour press conference was held on the status of preparations.

FIS President Kasper expressed his support of the organizing committee's efforts to present the best championships ever. Neumannová {{stated that the}} cross country skiing facility at Vesec was ready while the ski jumping facility at Ještěd was ready in the fall once construction of the access road and surrounding area was complete. The main concern of Neumannová's was the weather given the problems with the test events in February and the need for snow making equipment. The Czech government gave the organizing committee an additional CZK 189 million (€ 7.3 million) in financial support. At the end of 2008, the championships were the biggest sports event {{in the history of the}} Czech Republic. On 16 December 2008, FIS Secretary General Lewis, FIS Event and Sponsor Manager Niklas Carlsson, Neumannová, and other key Organizing Committee staff met to discuss promotional activities for the event, including ceremonies, social events, and the accreditation system. That same day, an entire inspection of the team village took place at the Technical University of Liberec where the entire complex was renovated. The students at the university left at the end of January 2009 for the teams to arrive on campus in mid-February.|$|E
