40|$|Aldo-keto reductase 1 C 3 (AKR 1 C 3) catalyses the NADPH {{dependent}} {{reduction of}} carbonyl {{groups in a}} number of important steroid and prostanoid molecules. The enzyme is also over-expressed in prostate and breast cancer and its expression is correlated with the aggressiveness of the disease. The steroid products of AKR 1 C 3 catalysis are important in proliferative signalling of hormone-responsive cells, while the prostanoid products promote prostaglandin-dependent proliferative pathways. In these ways, AKR 1 C 3 contributes to tumour development and maintenance, and suggest that inhibition of AKR 1 C 3 activity is an attractive target for the development of new anti-cancer therapies. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are one well-known class of compounds that inhibits AKR 1 C 3, yet crystal structures have only been determined for this enzyme with flufenamic acid, indomethacin, and closely related analogues bound. While the flufenamic acid and indomethacin structures have been used to design novel inhibitors, they provide only limited coverage of the NSAIDs that inhibit AKR 1 C 3 and that may be used for the development of new AKR 1 C 3 targeted drugs. To understand how other NSAIDs bind to AKR 1 C 3, we have determined ten crystal structures of AKR 1 C 3 complexes that cover three different classes of NSAID, N-phenylanthranilic acids (meclofenamic <b>acid,</b> mefenamic <b>acid),</b> <b>arylpropionic</b> <b>acids</b> (flurbiprofen, ibuprofen, naproxen), and indomethacin analogues (indomethacin, sulindac, zomepirac).

40|$|S Supporting Information ABSTRACT: Weak interfilament van der Waals {{interactions}} are potentially a significant roadblock {{in the development}} of carbon nanotube- (CNT-) and graphene-based nanocomposites. Chemical functionalization is envisioned as a means of introducing stronger intermolecular interactions at nanoscale interfaces, which in turn could enhance composite strength. This paper reports measure-ments of the adhesive energy of CNT−graphite interfaces functionalized with various coverages of <b>arylpropionic</b> <b>acid.</b> Peeling experiments conducted in situ in a scanning electron microscope show significantly larger adhesive energies compared to previously obtained measurements for unfunctionalized surfaces (Roenbeck et al. ACS Nano 2014, 8 (1), 124 − 138). Surprisingly, however, the adhesive energies are significantly higher when both surfaces have intermediate coverages than when one surface is densely functionalized. Atomistic simulations reveal a novel functional group interdiffusion mechanism, which arises for intermediate coverages in the presence of water. This interdiffusion is not observed when one surface is densely functionalized, resulting in energy trends that correlate with those observed in experiments. This unique intermolecular interaction mechanism, revealed through the integrated experimental−computational approach presented here, provides significant insights for use {{in the development of}} next-generation nanocomposites...|$|E
40|$|Using bovine {{vesicular}} gland microsomes and [14 C]indomethacin we {{demonstrated the}} presence of a specific binding site for nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Specific binding of [14 C]indomethacin to microsomes was rapid, with most of the ligand bound by 2 min at 4 degrees C. In routine binding assays the incubation temperature was maintained at 4 degrees C, because the maximal specific binding was obtained. Specific [14 C]indomethacin binding appeared to increase linearly with increasing protein concentration over the range of 0. 1 - 1. 0 mg of microsomal protein. Specific binding was saturable and Scatchard analysis of binding data showed a single class of binding sites with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 3. 8 microM and a maximal number of binding sites (Bmax) of about 1272 pmol/mg of protein. When these binding data were plotted according to the Hill equation, a straight line was obtained with a Hill coefficient of 1. 0. Structural specificity of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug site was studied with diclofenac, <b>arylpropionic</b> <b>acids</b> (ketoprofen and indoprofen), and aspirin. Diclofenac and arylpropionic derivatives were able to compete with [14 C]indomethacin for binding to microsomes, while aspirin was a weak inhibitor...|$|R

40|$|Background: Adverse {{reactions}} to nonsteroidal anti-infl ammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are a frequently reported problem {{due to the}} fact that these molecules are often used for control of pain and infl ammation. Although the use of selective inhibitors of cyclooxygenase (COX) 2 helps to prevent some of these adverse reactions, they can have cardiac side effects when taken for prolonged periods. Here we report the safety and tolerability of etoricoxib, a selective COX- 2 inhibitor with fewer cardiovascular effects, in patients with adverse {{reactions to}} NSAIDs. Patients and methods: We performed placebo-controlled oral challenge with etoricoxib in 65 patients with previous adverse reactions to NSAIDs: 13 to salicylates, 18 to <b>arylpropionic</b> <b>acids,</b> 10 to arylacetic acid, 12 to oxicam and derivates, 8 to pyrazolones, and 4 to acetaminophen (paracetamol). The reported symptoms were urticaria or angioedema in 69 %, rhinitis in 3 %, and 1 case of anaphylactic shock (1. 5 %). The challenge was done using the placebo on the fi rst day, half dosage of etoricoxib (45 mg) on the second day, and the therapeutic dose of 90 mg on the third day. The challenge was done in the outpatient department of the hospital and the subjects were monitored for a further 4 to 6 hours after challenge. Results: Oral challenge with etoricoxib was well tolerated in 97 % of the patients. Only 2 systemic reactions were reported during the challenge test. Conclusion: Etoricoxib can be considered a safe molecule for those patients with previous adverse reactions to NSAIDs. Key words: Etoricoxib. NSAID intolerance. Anaphylactic reaction. Asthma.

40|$|We {{report on}} hepatic effects {{obtained}} in vivo by treating mice with different doses of fenoprofen, an <b>arylpropionic</b> <b>acid</b> previously shown to inhibit in vitro peroxisomal very long chain fatty acid oxidation. A strong and dose-related induction of peroxisomal palmitoyl-CoA oxidase, and of carnitine acyltransferase and acyl-CoA hydrolase activities {{was recorded in}} liver homogenates of mice fed diets supplemented with different contents [0. 01, 0. 05, 0. 1, or 1 % (w/w) ] of fenoprofen for 6 d. Peroxisomal glycolate oxidase and mitochondrial butyryl-CoA, octanoyl-CoA, and palmitoyl-CoA dehydrogenases were unaffected or increased. Hepatic catalase activity was significantly increased in mice fed the diet with 0. 05 and 0. 1 % fenoprofen but, surprisingly, was not stimulated in mice fed the 1 % fenoprofen-containing diet. A time-related but unequal induction of acyl-CoA oxidases and catalase was observed with the 0. 1 % fenoprofen diet: at 21 d of treatment, the induction of lignoceroyl-CoA and palmitoyl-CoA oxidase activities were fivefold stronger than that of catalase activity. In mice treated with 1 % fenoprofen for up to 6 d, only acyl-CoA oxidase activities {{were found to be}} significantly increased. Morphometric analysis of the liver peroxisomes in mice treated with 0. 1 % fenoprofen evidenced an increase in size, volume density, and surface density along with a reduced ratio between perimeter and area of the peroxisomal profiles. No morphological marker for very long chain fatty acid deposition could be detected in livers from fenoprofen-treated animals. Our findings clearly demonstrate that fenoprofen acts as a peroxisome proliferator in the liver of mice and do not support the occurrence of in vivo reduction of very long chain fatty acid oxidation in liver from treated animals...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a series of}} investigations into the amide bond-hydrolyzing activity of bacterial strains RU-KM 1, RU-KM 3 L, RU-KM 3 S, and RU-OR, which were previously isolated {{for their ability to}} hydrolyze hydantoins to amino acids. The main aim {{of the study was to}} develop biotransformations with potential application in the production of enantiomerically pure amino acids and related compounds. Several compounds may be used as substrates by biocatalysts for the production of amino acids, such as hydantoins, amino nitriles, and amides. These compounds are not only important for amino acid production, but they may be used for production of other industrially important compounds, such as 2 - <b>arylpropionic</b> <b>acids,</b> which are non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Thus, the ability of the above-mentioned strains to hydrolyze these substrates was investigated, with the view to utilizing the maximum potential of these biocatalysts. The compounds used as substrates in the investigation are all essentially amides. Thus, the ability of the strains to hydrolyze imides, hydantoins, and amides, was investigated. In particular, imides have a structure which is very similar to that of hydantoins, and thus it was an objective of the study to determine whether these strains could hydrolyze imides. Imidehydrolyzing activity has only recently been discovered in microorganisms. Hydantoin conversion involves a two-step hydrolysis reaction which yields, initially, an Ncarbamylamino acid intermediate, and subsequently, an "-amino acid. The hydantoinhydrolyzing enzymes of a Pseudomonas putida strain, RU-KM 3 S, were characterized in a crude extract preparation and reaction conditions for its biocatalytic application were optimized. The optimum conditions for conversion of 5 -methylhydantoin were found to be 3 hours at 40 °C, with conversion yields greater than 50 % achieved. The enzymes of RU-KM 3 S demonstrated considerable stability, retaining 80 % of their activity after incubation at 40 °C for 3 hours. The activities of the enzymes were increased by the addition of a detergent to the extraction medium, suggesting that the enzymes might be membrane-bound. The results of the determination of the metal-dependence of the hydantoinase and N-carbamylase of RUKM 3 S suggested that these enzymes required metal ions for activity, with metal ions such as Mg²⁺, Mn²⁺, Zn²⁺, and Co²⁺ resulting in activation of the enzymes. However, Cu²⁺ and Fe²⁺ caused inactivation of these enzymes. The stereoselectivity of the enzymes was investigated, and the results suggested that the hydantoinase was non-selective, whereas the N-carbamylase was L-selective. The hydantoin substrate selectivity of RU-KM 3 S was compared to that of three other hydantoinase-producing bacteria, RU-KM 1, RU-KM 3 L, and RU-OR. The four strains were able to hydrolyze all of the seven substrates tested. However, there was a difference in activity levels between crude extract preparations and whole cells, with crude extracts generally showing higher activity than whole cells, except in the case of RU-KM 1. Some difference was also observed in the order of preference of substrates between whole cells and crude extracts. The preferred substrate for RU-KM 1 whole cells was isopropylhydantoin, whereas the crude extract preparation preferentially hydrolyzed p-hydroxyphenylhydantoin. RU-KM 3 L whole cells achieved a higher conversion yield with isobutylhydantoin, whereas the crude extract achieved a higher yield with 5 -t-butylhydantoin. RU-KM 3 S whole cells and crude extract preferentially hydrolyzed 5 -n-butylhydantoin, although the yield was greater with the crude extract. The highest conversion yields were observed with RU-KM 3 S crude extract, with conversion yields of 71. 6 % and 100 % for n-butylhydantoin and phydroxyphenylhydantoin, respectively. The ability of RU-KM 1, RU-KM 3 L, and RU-KM 3 S to hydrolyze nitriles, initially to amides and subsequently to carboxylic acids, was investigated. These strains were demonstrated to be unable to utilize acrylonitrile, propionitrile and benzonitrile as nitrogen sources, but were able to hydrolyze acrylonitrile, propionitrile and acetonitrile, in resting cell reactions. Nitrile hydrolysis was demonstrated to be inducible in all three strains, and the enzyme system responsible for nitrile hydrolysis was proposed to be a nitrile hydratase-amidase system. Amidase activity in the four bacterial strains was investigated. The ability of RU-KM 1, RUKM 3 L, RU-KM 3 S, and RU-OR to utilize amides as a nitrogen source was investigated, and the results showed that propionamide was a good nitrogen source for all four of the strains. Amide-hydrolyzing activity, by resting cells, was shown to be inducible by propionamide in all four strains. RU-KM 3 S demonstrated superior amide-hydrolyzing ability in that it hydrolyzed propionamide, acetamide, and acrylamide to a greater extent than the other strains. Resting cells of RU-KM 1 and RU-OR were demonstrated to have the ability to hydrolyze the imide substrate, succinimide, and this imidase activity was found to be inducible. These strains were also able to utilize this imide as the sole source of nitrogen for growth, which is a novel finding, as to date, bacteria have only be reported to utilize imides as a carbon source. The identity of the enzyme system responsible for succinimide hydrolysis is not yet clear. In conclusion, the hydantoin-hydrolyzing enzymes of RU-KM 3 S have been shown to be possibly membrane associated, which is a novel finding that has also been proposed in three other hydantoinase-producing strains in our laboratory. This study has shown that the Ncarbamylase of RU-KM 3 S is L-stereoselective, which, to our knowledge, is the first report of an L-stereospecific N-carbamylase in a Pseudomonas putida. Publication of these findings is already in progress. This is the first report on the study of imide hydrolysis in either an Agrobacterium tumefaciens or a Pseudomonas sp., and publications reporting these results are in preparation...|$|R
