40|$|This Interim Report makes {{recommendations}} to confer on members of Victoria Police a power to remove, hold and detain persons pending {{an application for}} an interim intervention order. As the initial response by police to a family violence incident is particularly important {{in the process of}} prevention, this power if introduced will be an appropriate addition to the current options for police. The report briefly considers the nature <b>and</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>family</b> violence to examine whether an extension of police powers is relevant and beneficial to victims, and notes the legal impediments police face in seeking intervention orders in a crisis situation. These impediments put pressure on police resources and can expose victims to further violence. Released September 200...|$|E
40|$|In 2005 in the Australian {{state of}} Victoria, {{significant}} {{changes were made}} to the defences to homicide. These reforms were in response to long standing concerns about the gendered operation of provocation and self-defence by feminist researchers and advocates, Law Reform Commissions, the media and political pressures.  This paper critically examines the reforms {{and the extent to which}} they have addressed these varied concerns and interests. The paper argues that these important law reforms have challenged some of the powerful narratives being used in the courts that minimise the existence <b>and</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>family</b> violence in intimate relationships. We see this particularly in judicial sentencing remarks. However, law reform must be accompanied by a shift in legal culture to be effective in practice. To this end, we argue that legal professionals need to have information about how to utilise the new family violence provisions as well as ongoing training and professional development to promote consistent understandings of family violence across the criminal justice system...|$|E
40|$|A {{new family}} of Cheilostomata, the Calescharidae, is {{introduced}} for the genus Caleschara MacGillivray and its Recent Australian typespecies, C. denticulata(MacGillivray), which is redefined from type and other material. The Australian Tertiary genus Tretosina Canu & Bassler and its type species,T. arcifera Canu & Bassler, are closely related,and are also {{assigned to the}} Calescharidae. The history <b>and</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>family</b> attributions of both genera are outlined, and RecentC. denticulata from Australian and other localities is distinguished from the Late Tertiary Victorian species C. parva Maplestone. Caleschara lithconis, sp. nov., from the Late Eocene of Victoria {{is one of the}} earliest known species: its morphology closely resembles a Recent form from the Philippines, C. junctifera Canu & Bassler. Another Recent species, Caleschara minuta (Maplestone) from the GilbertIslands, is a senior synonym of three other Indo-Pacific species,C. levinseni Harmer, C. laxa Canu & Bassler and Floridinella arculifera Canu & Bassler, and resembles the European Paleocene C. squamosa. Three other related species are briefly discussed. Close relationships to other families are problematic and are discussed; divergence in the early history of the cheilostomes is inferred. <br /...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 2008. This project {{begins to}} address this {{inattention}} through inquiry of transgenders with regard to family, {{at the same time}} contextualizing some of the larger issues facing this population. This is accomplished theoretically through integration of constructs from critical consciousness, structuration theory, feminist standpoint theories, and culturally anchored intervention research. Methodologically, this is achieved through the use of photovoice [...] a participatory research strategy involving the provision of cameras, not to professionals or specialists, but to members of the community being studied. This project is an exploration of local transgenders and their relationships to family. This seemed necessary given the misunderstanding, fear, and negative reaction towards transgenders, despite the continued evolution of professional and public views. This situation has resulted in attention to matters of illness and disease [...] e. g., Gender Identity Disorder and HIV/AIDS [...] to the exclusion of those of wellness or wellbeing; inadequate and ghettoized services for transgenders and other sexual minorities; and misunderstanding about and neglect of the role <b>and</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>family.</b> This project, then, relied on photographs, taken by 16 participants. All resided in Honolulu, self-identified as transgender, and were Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander mixed. Their photographs served as springboards for narratives, which were collected during a series of four focus groups. Narratives were transcribed verbatim and coded both theoretically and by way of an emic approach (in vivo). Results revealed biological; adopted or hanai; chosen, drag, or work-related; and blended family forms. Data were conceptualized as belonging to one of two main domains [...] kinship or collectivity, and melancholia (trauma, grief, and hardship, especially as these related to status loss). Melancholia was further understood as communal, serving to bring people together and provide a common understanding and shared mission (e. g., the sparing of the younger generation) [...] an understanding that linked the two main domains. An argument was made that attention to transgenders and their families is highly relevant to social work and to the discipline's promotion of social justice, and that social workers would do well to allow for, if not appreciate, transgender expression [...] on the level of the individual as well as family.

As francophones have laid claim to the decision-making spheres of power, anglophones have experienced losses to their community through out-migration and the loss of social power. This study reveals various responses within the church, incorporating concepts of community and 'place' as symbols in identity formation and cultural affirmation. Levels of financial commitment for individual parishes and mission outreach, numbers of Easter communicants and response to liturgical change all show distinctive patterns.

The proposal underlying the study was that adolescents who received structurally-oriented individual-family therapy during inpatient substance—abuse treatment would demonstrate a higher level of functioning on several variables than adolescents who did not receive this type of therapy. A static group comparison design was used in the study. The adolescents’ level of functioning was defined in terms of the following variables: (a) self esteem, (b) depression and (C) attitudes towards family.

40|$|Background: One of nine {{women will}} {{at some point}} in life be treated for breast cancer. When a woman {{receives}} a cancer diagnosis, it can be a trigger of a life crisis, which manifests itself in different phases: shock phase, reaction phase, processing phase and reorientation phase. Breast cancer affects the women's lifeworld and create suffering. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} describe women's experiences of receiving a breast cancer diagnosis. Method: This is a literature-based study of twelve qualitative articles. The articles was analyzed according to a qualitative content analysis of Graneheim and Lundman (2004). Results: The findings of this study were that women with a newly-diagnosed breast cancer went through a life crisis while diagnosed. Three themes emerged; 1 : 'To receive the diagnosis of breast cancer'. Subthemes that emerged in this theme was; 'To be in shock', 'Fear of the disease progress and its consequences', and 'Uncertainty about the future'. 2 : 'Strategies to master the new life situation'. Subthemes was; 'Activities to manage everyday life', 'Trust in spirituality' and 'To accept the diagnosis'. 3 : 'The inherent meaning of support'. Subthemes was; 'The importance of health professionals supportive and informative role' <b>and</b> 'The <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> friend's support'.

40|$|Background and {{objective}} Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) {{is one of}} the most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. As the overall prognosis for affected patients is still poor, there is a need for biomarkers for prediction of survival and guiding individual therapy. This study is to explore the expression <b>and</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> kinesin <b>family</b> member 23 (KIF 23) in NSCLC. Methods KIF 23 data were retrieved from Oncomine NSCLC database. The prognostic value of KIF 23 was retrieved from an online survival analysis tool “Kaplan-Meier Plotter” (KM plotter) database. Results In Oncomine database, there were 447 studies of different types concerning expression of KIF 23, of which 67 studies were <b>of</b> statistically <b>significance</b> (64 up-regulated <b>and</b> 3 down-regulated). A total of 16 studies were involved KIF 23 in NSCLC tissues and normal tissues, including a total of 1, 189 samples. Overall, KIF 23 expression in NSCLC is higher than that in normal tissues (P< 0. 05). Moreover, Kaplan-Meier plots of overall survival indicated that KIF 23 high expression is closely associated with poor survival in NSCLC (P< 0. 05). Subgroup analysis revealed that KIF 23 expression showed negative relation to the prognosis of pulmonary adenocarcinoma patients. Whereas, in those with squamous carcinoma KIF 23 expression showed no effects on the prognosis of the patients. Conclusion KIF 23 was found highly expressed in NSCLC, which might be a marker for NSCLC prognosis...|$|R
40|$|The family {{constitutes}} {{the background and}} security for everyone regardless of their age. At old age, the well-functioning <b>family</b> means security <b>of</b> psychical, physical and material aid. Moreover, the <b>family</b> develops activities <b>of</b> seniors, provides them {{with a number of}} opportunities and thus also strengthens their role in the society. One of negative social features is perception of the old generation as a useless and depending community. This social climate, negative for seniors, may be reflected somehow in the role held by them in the family. The theoretical part of the thesis addresses old age and its division, negative behaviour to seniors, a family as an institution and the role of seniors in a family. The respondents were seniors and their family members. The research was implemented {{in the form of the}} qualitatively quantitative data collection. The aim of the qualitative part was to ascertain how seniors characterize their role in the family and whether they are satisfied therewith. The objective of the quantitative research was to ascertain whether opinions <b>of</b> the other <b>family</b> members correspond to the opinions of seniors as far as the role of seniors in the family is concerned. Both objectives have been achieved. The research conclusions reflect how seniors perceive their role in the family and how their role is perceived by the other family members.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of {{coronary heart disease}} (CHD) remains significant in such developing countries as Thailand. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) {{is one of the}} most frequently used surgical procedures for CHD. Although CABG may relieve the symptoms of CHD, postoperative sequelae such as pulmonary complications, prolonged weakness, and volume overload still occur. Postoperative sequelae may be prevented by effective self-care behavior. Following discharge, CABG patients are expected to perform normal activities of daily living and live a healthy lifestyle. How Thai CABG patients take care of themselves and factors that influence the performance of self-care following CABG has not yet been studied. ^ The purpose of the ethnographic study, which was guided by Orem 2 ̆ 7 s (1995) Self-Care Deficit Theory of Nursing, was to describe self-care and dependent-care associated with the experience of recovering from CABG in Thai patients and to describe the influences <b>of</b> gender, <b>family,</b> and sociocultural factors on self-care and dependent-care actions. A series of ethnographic interviews and focused participant-observations were the primary data collection methods and Leininger 2 ̆ 7 s (1991) Phase of Analysis for qualitative data guided the data analysis. Four themes emerged from the data: (1) Getting Back to “Normal”; (2) Life Changing Event; (3) Living a Healthier Life; <b>and</b> (4) <b>Significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>Family</b> as Protection <b>and</b> Support were identified. In addition, the influences <b>of</b> gender, <b>family,</b> and sociocultural factors on self-care and dependent-care actions were presented. Results from this study provide the basis from which culturally responsive and effective nursing care for Thai patients and their families recovering from CABG surgery can be developed. Future research for nursing theory and practices related to CABG recovery process is discussed. ...|$|R

This study used data from the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States to examine associations between troubled sleep and family contact, social support, and strain. Results show that having strained family relationships is associated with more troubled sleep, while supportive family relationships are associated with less troubled sleep. Family strain is more consequential for sleep than support, and sleep troubles are greatest when family relationships are highly strained and provide inadequate emotional support. Family strain is also more harmful to sleep among individuals who are in frequent contact with family members.

The study also examined the specific cultural traditions and practices that are valued and have remained intact in the Filipino American culture. A qualitative research design was used to conduct in-depth interviews with ten Filipino American second-generation and older participants. A major finding showed that participants defined culture as a combination of components relating to individuals??? ethnic and familial ancestry, where family was a major aspect describing how traditions and or practices were defined, interpreted and passed on among generations.

40|$|Store-operated calcium {{channels}} (SOCs) {{are highly}} calcium-selective channels that mediate calcium entry in various cell types. We have previously reported that intraplantar injection of YM- 58483 (a SOC inhibitor) attenuates chronic pain. A previous study {{has reported that}} the function of SOCs in dorsal root ganglia (DRG) is enhanced after nerve injury, suggesting that SOCs may play a peripheral role in chronic pain. However, the expression, functional distribution <b>and</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> the SOC <b>family</b> in DRG neurons remain elusive and the key components that mediate SOC entry (SOCE) are still controversial. Here, we demonstrated that the SOC family (STIM 1, STIM 2, Orai 1, Orai 2, and Orai 3) was expressed in DRGs and STIM 1 was mainly present in small- and medium-sized DRG neurons. Using confocal live cell imaging, Ca 2 + imaging and electrophysiology techniques, we demonstrated that depletion of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + stores induced STIM 1 and STIM 2 translocation, and that inhibition of STIM 1 or blockage of Orai channels with pharmacological tools attenuated SOCE and SOC currents. Using the small inhibitory RNA knockdown approach, we identified STIM 1, STIM 2, Orai 1, and Orai 3 as the key components of SOCs mediating SOCE in DRG neurons. Importantly, activation of SOCs by thapsigargin induced plasma membrane depolarization and increased neuronal excitability, which were completely abolished by inhibition of SOCs or double knockdown of Orai 1 and Orai 3. Our findings suggest that SOCs exert an excitatory action in DRG neurons and provide a potential peripheral mechanism for modulation of pain hypersensitivity by SOC inhibition...|$|R

Through interviews about family relations with people in treatment, I have found several links with the theoretical starting points. The interviewees were mostly focusing on relationships with their parents, seeing them as the biggest problem. It turned out that all of them came from families, where they had problems with at least one of the parents. I realised that persons in treatment were more aware of how important relationships are and how they influence them than their parents who, according to the interviewees, still have the old-fashioned family dynamics deeply rooted in them. The rehabilitees were also more aware of the mistakes that their parents and themselves, have made in their relationship. ...|$|R

Methods:Stage I to IIIA tumors from 335 patients with NSCLC were immunohistochemically tested for protein expression <b>of</b> all Erb <b>family</b> members. Membranous HER 2 expression was compared with its gene copy number by SISH in paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed material. Correlations were made with clinicopathological variables. Results:Synchronous high immunohistochemical expression <b>of</b> all Erb <b>family</b> members was seen in 8 % of tumor samples. There was a significant correlation between the HER 2 gene copy number and HER 2 protein expression (p = 0. 003). High nuclear HER 3 expression correlated significantly with high HER 2 gene copy numbers (p = 0. 015). In univariate analyses, high HER 2 gene copy number was a highly significant negative prognostic indicator for disease-specific survival in women (p = 0. 005), whereas it did not show prognostic influence in men (p = 0. 9). Neither polysomy of chromosome 17 nor the IHC expression <b>of</b> Erb <b>family</b> member proteins as singles or pairs correlated significantly with survival. In the multivariate analysis, high HER 2 gene copy number in tumor epithelial cells (p = 0. 03) was an independent prognostic factor for disease-specific survival in female patients. Conclusions:IHC does not consistently identify patients likely to have a poor prognosis, whereas SISH provides superior prognostic information for female patients with NSCLC. High HER 2 gene copy number in tumor epithelial cells is an independent predictor of inferior survival in female patients with primary NSCLC...|$|R
40|$|Both parental {{monitoring}} and involvement with deviant peers have {{in previous research}} been associated with individual substance use during adolescence {{as well as to}} deviant behavior in general. Although such associations are well established, less is known <b>of</b> how the <b>significance</b> <b>and</b> interaction <b>of</b> <b>family</b> and peer influences may change during adolescence. It has been discussed whether peer factors independently influences on risk for substance use among adolescents, or if poor parenting is a prerequisite for peer risk factors to have an effect. In this study, changes in parental monitoring will be examined, as well as the longitudinal relations between parental {{monitoring and}} peer deviant behaviors in predicting adolescent substance use. The sample is drawn from the Malmö Individual and Neighbourhood Development Study (MINDS) and constitutes of four waves of data collection with 190 adolescents and their parents. When the first wave of data collection was carried out with the parents, the adolescents averaged between 12 and 13 years of age, and in the last wave of data collection, the adolescents had reached an averaged age between 16 and 17. The results showed that both parental monitoring and peer deviant behavior was associated with individual substance use. In addition, the results showed some variation in level of monitoring over time, with the highest level of monitoring in early adolescence. Overall, the adolescents are well monitored by their parents. Further, adolescents who have deviant peers tend to be less monitored.

40|$|Although the {{eruption}} of religious dissent in Germany touched off by Martin Luther in 1517 began as a theological disagreement, the ensuring years would reveal that these religious ideas had important social consequences. They set into motion a process of reordering society and forming of confessional identities that had significant implications for the nuclear family. Reflecting John Calvin 2 ̆ 7 s assertion that 2 ̆ 2 every individual Family {{ought to be a}} Little Church of Christ, 2 ̆ 2 Reformed Protestants sought to transform nuclear families into spiritual communities, creating domestic microcosms of the larger church. This project examines the religious formation <b>of</b> <b>families</b> among the French Reformed (Huguenot) Churches, demonstrating that this was a cultural offensive as much as it was a religious one. Huguenot leaders wanted far more than their congregants to attend church: this programme transformed the roles and responsibilities <b>of</b> <b>family</b> members, shaped the activities and routines of the household, circumscribed and defined the appropriate associations <b>of</b> <b>family</b> members, and reorganized the family schedule. This study illuminates the Huguenots 2 ̆ 7 conception of a 2 ̆ 2 holy household 2 ̆ 2 by analyzing the four primary characteristics <b>of</b> these godly <b>families</b> - ordered, educational, pure, and pious - and describes how they were conceived of and implemented in Reformed communities across early modern France. In order to provide a comprehensive understanding of the French Reformed family, this dissertation bridges the divide between intellectual history and social history. There was no greater intellectual source for French Protestantism than John Calvin and Geneva: Calvin was one of the primary theologians influencing the development of Protestantism in France, and the Genevan Church served as an advisor and template for many of the Huguenot churches. Accordingly, each chapter examines in depth the theological underpinnings of this effort, analyzing Calvin 2 ̆ 7 s sermons, commentaries, Institutes of the Christian Religion, and written correspondence with leaders of the Huguenot churches. This investigation, in turn, provides an understanding of the religious sources for this new emphasis holy family and domestic piety in France, without which {{it would be impossible to}} fully appreciate. To balance these prescriptive sources, I analyze descriptive records to understand how the actual reform <b>of</b> the <b>family</b> was carried out on the local level. In particular, my research relies extensively on church discipline records (consistory registers) from churches throughout France: Albenc (1606 - 1682), Archiac (1600 - 1637), Blois (1574 - 1579), Coutras (1582 - 1584), Die (1639 - 1686), Le Mans (1560 - 1561), Mussidan (1593 - 1599), Nîmes (1561 - 1564), Pont-de-Camares (1574 - 1579), Rochechouart (1596 - 1635), and Saint-Gervais (1564 - 1568). These records reveal the complex and messy manner of this reform, which was often marked by contestation and negotiation. Throughout, I compare these records to Genevan discipline records to compare and contrast how Calvin 2 ̆ 7 s own church instituted this familial reform in the Genevan context. My project, in sum, reveals the heretofore overlooked religious role <b>and</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>family</b> <b>and</b> home in Reformed churches of early modern France...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} an in-depth, {{qualitative}} study <b>of</b> the <b>family</b> lives <b>of</b> {{young people with}} a parent at the end <b>of</b> life. <b>Family</b> is an important concept in end of life care; the support and comfort <b>of</b> <b>family</b> members {{is thought to be}} valued by people at the end of life, and the presence <b>of</b> <b>family</b> is widely understood as essential to a ‘good death’. However, attempts to interrogate what is meant by ‘family’ in these circumstances have been limited. Research studies in psycho-oncology and health sciences have tended to substitute one adult as a proxy for family. Consequently, little is known about young people’s experiences of living with dying. This study employed a multiple perspectives methodology to privilege the views of young people whilst taking into account the familial and wider social context in which young people live. The study is based on semi-structured interviews with ten young people (aged 13 - 21) with a parent {{in the last year of}} life. In addition, five family members were interviewed, each of whom was nominated by a young person. Young people’s accounts were analysed using the voice-centred relational method, a narrative approach involving multiple readings of a transcript to illuminate different aspects of the young person’s account. The narratives <b>of</b> <b>family</b> members were used to support an analysis of how young people understand and experience the relational constructs <b>of</b> <b>family</b> and care. The results and discussion of the study findings are presented according to the three major subject areas <b>of</b> <b>family,</b> care and resources. The meaning, practice <b>and</b> moral <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> <b>of</b> care in the everyday lives of young people are examined in the light of wider social discourses on young people’s involvement in care and on ‘doing family’, particularly in the context of end of life care. Young people in the study talked about <b>family</b> in terms <b>of</b> presence, closeness and care; meanings that conflicted with their everyday experiences of absence, distance and loss. The acknowledgement that some family members were unwilling or unable to be there was troubling for young people and disrupted their sense of belonging to a proper family. In particular, the limited ability of parents to be there as a consequence of parental illness challenged the moral imperative for family to put the needs of children first. Instead, the need to provide care for a parent presented families with a new moral imperative to care for the dying. Young people wanted to be there for their parent; providing care was thus one response to getting on with everyday life. Furthermore, in caring for others, young people also cared for themselves by ensuring that their parent remained with them for as long as possible. Friends were named as the most important source of support for young people. Many young people had little contact with service providers, and those who had received support were sometimes ambivalent about its effectiveness. Most young people were able to articulate a future for themselves beyond the death of their parent, and this future narrative contributed a sense of meaning and purpose to their lives in the present. This study adds to current understandings of living with a parent at the end of life by applying a sociological lens to draw attention to the interpersonal and wider social factors that impact on young people’s experiences of living with dying. I conclude that, whilst living with dying is undoubtedly troubling at times, there is also a mundanity seldom acknowledged in the literature in that young people accommodated their experiences in and through the everyday routines and practices <b>of</b> <b>family</b> life. Research, policy and practice in end of life care may benefit from more emphasis on the relational and often lengthy experience of living with dying, and on factors that may help to promote a good dying for all family members, including young people...|$|R
40|$|To make a {{comprehensive}} {{assessment of the}} incidence, nature <b>and</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> MYC gene <b>family</b> amplification in medulloblastoma, we first developed a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay to identify MYCC, MYCN and MYCL amplification in a large patient cohort (n= 292), which included 178 children entered into the SIOP/UKCCSG PNET 3 clinical trial. MYCC, MYCN and MYCL copy number elevation was identified in 6 % (17 / 292), 6 % (18 / 292), and 1 % (3 / 292) of medulloblastomas, respectively. No evidence of co-incident copy number elevation {{of more than one}} MYC family member was identified in any sample. The transcript expression of genes frequently harboured within the MYCC and MYCN amplicons was assessed and a correlation was identified between gene copy number and transcript expression of four genes (TRIB 2, DDX 1, NESE 2 and AK 093424) neighbouring the MYCC and MYCN loci, suggesting that these genes may represent amplification targets and play a role in medulloblastoma. In cases where RNA was available (n= 60), a correlation was identified between MYCC copy number elevation (n= 8) and elevated expression of its transcript; however the relationship between MYCN copy number and transcript expression was less clear. MYCL expression was assessed in a smaller number (n= 18) of medulloblastoma primary tumours and was found to be significantly overexpressed in cases with MYCL amplification (n= 2). All three MYC family members were more highly expressed in medulloblastomas with a deregulated Shh- or Wnt- signalling pathway, suggesting that these pathways also {{play a role in the}} regulation <b>of</b> MYC <b>family</b> member expression in medulloblastoma. Comprehensive assessment <b>of</b> the clinico-histopathological <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> MYCC <b>and</b> MYCN amplification (HCN ≥ 5. 00) identified an association with the large cell anaplastic (LCA) medulloblastoma and all tumours with an elevated copy number of MYCC (n= 17) and MYCN (n= 18) were derived from patients greater than three years of age. Log-rank tests identified MYCC or MYCN amplifications as a marker of poor prognosis and Cox proportional hazards models revealed that MYCC and MYCN amplification had similar hazard ratios (hazard ratio (HR); 299) to establish markers fo disease risk (Metastatic (M) stage ≥ 2 (HR; 3. 33) and the LCA subtype (HR; 3. 63)). Multivariate analyses identified MYCC or MYCN amplification as independent markers of poor prognosis and together with LCA histology and M stage ≥ 2, formed a combined high risk group of patients with a significantly poorer prognosis (29. 4 % (75 / 255); p< 0. 0001).

WP 1 : CompilationThe study {{explores the}} family and its changes during the 20 th century and, particularly, between the 1960 s and 1990 s by {{comparing}} Finland and Spain within the West European context. The examination <b>of</b> the <b>family</b> arises from the following questions: (i) How, to what degree and why are family institutions in Europe different or similar? (ii) What are the roles <b>and</b> <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> the <b>family</b> in contemporary societies? (iii) How is the family defined and what social and cultural factors have affected the definitions in different countries?. The family {{is viewed as a}} social institution, with the interest lying in macro-level social changes and in the interrelationship between {{the family and}} other social institutions such as the welfare state, the labour market, politics, legislation and religion. The family as an institution has been examined from the viewpoints <b>of</b> <b>family</b> ideology and family practices. Family ideology has been studied by analysing how public and political institutions such as legislation and family policy define the family and how these definitions changed during the 20 th century and, second, by looking at attitudes and values concerning intimate relations, the family and family practices. Family practices have been studied by analysing and comparing socio-demographic statistics between the 1960 s and 1990 s, the focus being on the formation <b>of</b> the first <b>family.</b> Furthermore, cross-national differences and similarities concerning patterns <b>of</b> <b>family</b> formation and prevailing family ideologies have been examined in association with legislation, social policies, the labour market, housing policies, education, gender relations, and religion. The study questions the stereotypical notions of the modern North and traditional South and their typical families and demonstrates that differences between Finnish (Northern) and Spanish (Southern) families have been greatly exaggerated and oversimplified. Fundamentally, the family ideologies are the same based on Christian tradition and, furthermore, the evolution of ideologies has moved in the same direction along with modernisation processes, albeit at a different pace. The study demonstrates that the variations are not due to fundamentally different conceptions <b>of</b> the <b>family</b> but to the historical, social and political developments of the countries. Analyses of demographic statistics and data on Finns and Spaniards values and attitudes indicate that demographic statistics suggest a crisis <b>of</b> The <b>Family,</b> for in neither of the countries does a fixed or typical family form exist and the growing plurality <b>of</b> <b>family</b> forms is a fact. On the other hand, the study also shows that The Family ­ the conjugal nuclear family - is very much alive and well as an ideological model and ideal. Looking at patterns <b>of</b> <b>family</b> formation and considering a variety of hypotheses usually presented as explaining the differences: contraceptive use, premarital cohabitation and women s labour market participation, the study shows that these reasons do not explain the differences between Finnish and Spanish patterns <b>of</b> first <b>family</b> formation. The study suggests that family-relevant public policies, housing policies and the labour market in particular are factors that better explain why Spaniards have fewer children and form families later than Finns even though the female employment rate is considerably lower and the use of modern contraceptives and premarital cohabitation is clearly more infrequent in Spain than in Finland. Analysis of the role <b>of</b> <b>family</b> formation in the process of attaining adult status shows that financial independence and self-reliance have taken over from marriage and parenthood as the principal markers of adulthood both in Finland and Spain. However, prolonged periods in education and erratic labour markets tend to complicate the attainment of such independence, reflected in the postponement or even rejection <b>of</b> <b>family</b> formation, especially marriage and parenthood. Yet, a de-familialised welfare state like the Finnish one eases gaining independence and family formation even with limited means, whereas a familistic welfare state like the Spanish one makes it more difficult to cut the cord to the parental home and to form new families. The study elaborates a complex and subtle model for explaining both the differences between countries and changes in the West European family institution in general. The model emphasises the role of public policies, housing policies, legislation and the labour market in particular in shaping the framework within which people in different countries make their decisions concerning family and family life. This comparative study is a dissertation comprised of a lengthy summarising article that links four empirical studies that were previously published as articles in international scientific journals and edited volumes...|$|R

It rescues the Brazilian Childhood and Youth history since the colonization till the present time, crossed by the hygienism doctrine and also by the medical-judicial apparatus, as a relief tool of a specific population. It crosses {{the history of the}} Brazilian childhood-youth legislation, since the creation of the first Younger s Code till the implementation of the Childs and Teens Statute, in 1990. It utilizes the oral story as methodological tool. Analyses hegemonic practices that create subjectivities, built at the neo-liberal capitalist logic, which blame and hold responsible the families, in general the poor ones, considered unable to create their children within an instituted bourgeois style. It considers the speeches and practices built in those sheltering institutions which arrest the child and teen in their subjective constructions which label, stigmatize and characterize them as unstable which would justify their need of relief. It explains that, although the weakening of their previous familiar entails, the sheltering is not avoiding the formation of new affective nets <b>and</b> the new <b>significance</b> <b>of</b> <b>family,</b> school <b>and</b> their own future, creating other subjectivation modes. It concludes that, at the sheltering house, although the subjective construction which unpower/victimize the received children and teens, there are spaces for the invention of other ways to be and stay under shelter, ways that methods which individualize the human beingTrata das histórias de crianças e adolescentes abrigados em duas casas de acolhimento no município de Vitória-ES. Apresenta a situação de acolhimento sob o ponto de vista dos sujeitos acolhidos priorizando suas percepções sobre a própria condição, assim como sobre a de suas relações familiares e suas expectativas de futuro. Resgata a história da Infância e Juventude no Brasil desde a colonização até a atualidade, atravessada pela doutrina do higienismo e também pelo aparato médico-jurídico, como ferramenta de tutela de uma população específica. Percorre a história da legislação infanto-juvenil brasileira, desde a criação do primeiro Código de Menores até a implementação do Estatuto da Criança e do Adolescente, em 1990. Utiliza a história oral como ferramenta metodológica. Analisa práticas hegemônicas que produzem subjetividades, construídas na lógica do capitalismo neoliberal, as quais culpabilizam e responsabilizam famílias, em geral pobres, consideradas incapazes de criar seus filhos dentro de um modelo burguês instituído. Pondera sobre discursos e práticas construídas nessas instituições de acolhimento que aprisionam a criança e o adolescente em construções subjetivas as quais os rotulam, estigmatizam e os caracterizam como inseguros o que justificaria a sua necessidade de tutela. Explica que, apesar da fragilização dos vínculos familiares anteriores, o acolhimento não impede a formação de outras redes afetivas e a ressignificação de família, escola e do próprio futuro, criando outros modos de subjetivação. Conclui que, na casa de acolhimento, apesar da construção de subjetividades que despotencializam/vitimizam as crianças e adolescentes acolhidos, há espaços para invenção de outras formas de ser e de estar acolhido, formas que singularizam o sujeit...|$|R
