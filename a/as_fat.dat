5|$|The {{episode was}} written by David S. Cohen, and {{directed}} by Susie Dietter. Joe Mantegna guest stars in the episode <b>as</b> <b>Fat</b> Tony. The title of the episode is a parody of William Shakespeare's play Much Ado About Nothing. Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. It acquired a Nielsen rating of 8.2, and was the fourth highest-rated show on the Fox network the week it aired.|$|E
5|$|A {{strategy}} {{for dealing with}} seasonal plenty is to eat {{as much as possible}} and store the surplus nutrients <b>as</b> <b>fat.</b> Marmots do this, and may be 50% heavier in the autumn than in the spring. They rely on their fat reserves during their long winter hibernation. Beavers feed on the leaves, buds, and inner bark of growing trees, as well as aquatic plants. They store food for winter use by felling small trees and leafy branches in the autumn and immersing them in their pond, sticking the ends into the mud to anchor them. Here, they can access their food supply underwater even when their pond is frozen over.|$|E
5|$|Fat Freddy's Drop {{returned}} to touring New Zealand, Australia and Europe {{to promote the}} new album in 2009. Three shows {{on the west coast}} of the United States, and a show in Canada, were also included in the tour. The only previous time the band had played in the United States was a single performance at the Detroit Electronic Music festival in 2004. Before 2009, the cost of touring in the US, difficulty obtaining visas, and the band's low profile in North America prevented them from including tour dates there. Band members say they now consider playing together <b>as</b> <b>Fat</b> Freddy's Drop their first musical priority, and spend less time playing with other bands.|$|E

5|$|The thrifty gene {{hypothesis}} postulates that, due to dietary scarcity during human evolution, {{people are}} prone to obesity. Their ability {{to take advantage of}} rare periods of abundance by storing energy <b>as</b> <b>fat</b> would be advantageous during times of varying food availability, and individuals with greater adipose reserves {{would be more likely to}} survive famine. This tendency to store fat, however, would be maladaptive in societies with stable food supplies. This theory has received various criticisms, and other evolutionarily-based theories such as the drifty gene hypothesis and the thrifty phenotype hypothesis have also been proposed.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{nuthatch}} eats mainly insects, particularly caterpillar and beetles. In autumn and winter, {{the diet}} is supplemented with nuts and seeds, hazel nuts and beech mast being preferred. The young are fed {{mainly on the}} insects favoured by their parents, with some seeds. Food items are found mainly on tree trunks and large branches, but smaller branches may also be investigated, and food may be taken from the ground, especially outside the breeding season. Nuthatches can forage when descending trees head first, as well as when climbing. Some prey is caught in flight, and a nuthatch will remove bark or rotten wood to reach insects, although it cannot chisel into healthy wood like a woodpecker. A pair may temporarily join a mixed-species foraging flock as it passes near their territory. The Eurasian nuthatch readily visits bird tables and bird feeders in winter, eating human-made food items such <b>as</b> <b>fat,</b> cheese, butter and bread. It has even been recorded as taking slaughterhouse offal. Sizeable hard food items like nuts or large insects are wedged into crevices in tree bark and smashed with the strong bill.|$|E
5|$|The {{aim of the}} ducker was to {{get every}} {{duckling}} <b>as</b> <b>fat</b> as possible {{by the age of}} eight weeks (the first moult, the age at which they would be killed for meat), while avoiding any foods which would build up their bones or make their flesh greasy. In their first week after hatching, the ducklings would be fed on boiled eggs, toast soaked in water, boiled rice and beef liver. From the second week on, this diet would gradually be replaced by barley meal and boiled rice mixed with greaves. (Some larger-scale duckers would boil a horse or sheep and feed this to the ducklings in place of greaves.) This high-protein diet was supplemented with nettles, cabbage and lettuce to provide a source of vitamins. As with all poultry, ducks require grit in their diet to break up the food and make it digestible. Aylesbury ducklings' drinking water was laced with grit from Long Marston and Gubblecote; this grit also gave their bills their distinctive pinkish colour. Around 85% of ducklings would survive this eight-week rearing process to be sent to market.|$|E

B.C.: The First Thanksgiving, first aired on NBC in 1973, {{was directed by}} Abe Levitow, and featured the voice talents of Daws Butler (as B.C. and Clumsy), Don Messick as Peter and Thor, Bob Holt as Wiley and Grog, and Joanie Sommers <b>as</b> <b>Fat</b> Broad and Cute Chick.|$|E
25|$|Generally, French {{preparations}} of {{foie gras}} are made over low heat, <b>as</b> <b>fat</b> melts faster {{from the traditional}} goose foie gras than the duck foie gras produced in most {{other parts of the}} world.

25|$|An atrophic scar {{takes the}} form of a sunken recess in the skin, which has a pitted appearance. These are caused when {{underlying}} structures supporting the skin, such <b>as</b> <b>fat</b> or muscle, are lost. This type of scarring is often associated with acne, chickenpox, other diseases (especially Staphylococcus infection), surgery, certain insect and spider bites, or accidents. It can also be caused by a genetic connective tissue disorder, such as Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Fifteen {{miles north}} in the college towns of Northampton and Amherst, there is an active {{independent}} and alternative rock scene. Many of these bands perform regularly in Springfield's Club Quarter, at venues such <b>as</b> <b>Fat</b> Cats Bar & Grille, Theodore's, and the restored Paramount Theater. In the Club Quarter, centered on Stearns Square, nightly offerings include blues, college rock, jazz, indie, hip-hop, jam band, Latin, hard rock, pop, metal, karaoke, piano bars, and DJs.|$|E

25|$|The ash {{remaining}} represents very roughly 3.5% of the body's original mass (2.5% in children). Because {{the weight}} of dry bone fragments is so closely connected to skeletal mass, their weight varies greatly from person to person. Because many changes in body composition (such <b>as</b> <b>fat</b> and muscle loss or gain) do not affect {{the weight of}} cremated remains, {{the weight of the}} remains can be more closely predicted from the person's height and sex (which predicts skeletal weight), than it can be predicted from the person's simple weight.|$|E
25|$|Arthur's {{world was}} mainly {{populated}} by petty crooks, 'tea leaves', 'fences' and those happy to quickly turn over dodgy goods, usually (but not always) without violence. They included such memorable characters as 'Mournful Morris', 'Self Inflicted Sid', 'Freddy, the Fly', 'Scotch Harry', 'Pongo Harris' and 'Dipso Pete'. As the seasons progressed, the guest stars became more prestigious, including Michael Kitchen as 'Maltese Tony', {{and the last}} season starring Cole and Waterman featured Billy Connolly playing Tick-tack, a bookie and grifter, Brian Blessed as DI Dyer, Ian McShane as gangster Jack Last and Roy Kinnear <b>as</b> <b>Fat</b> Charlie.|$|E
25|$|Food, clothing, petrol, {{leather and}} other such items were rationed. However, items such as sweets and fruits were not rationed, as they would spoil. Access to luxuries was {{severely}} restricted, although {{there was also a}} significant black market. Families also grew victory gardens, and small home vegetable gardens, to supply themselves with food. Many things were conserved to turn into weapons later, such <b>as</b> <b>fat</b> for nitroglycerin production. People in the countryside were less affected by rationing as they had greater access to locally sourced unrationed products than people in metropolitan areas and were more able to grow their own.|$|E

50|$|Because {{water is}} a very good solvent, it is rarely pure and some of the {{properties}} of impure water can vary from those of the pure substance. There are also many compounds that are essentially, if not completely, insoluble in water, such <b>as</b> <b>fats,</b> oils and other non-polar substances.|$|R
25|$|After {{preparation}} of the raw material, i.e., reducing cross-links between collagen components and removing some of the impurities such <b>as</b> <b>fat</b> and salts, partially purified collagen is converted into gelatin by extraction with either water or acid solutions at appropriate temperatures. All industrial processes are based on neutral or acid pH values because although alkali treatments speed up conversion, they also promote degradation processes. Acidic extraction conditions are extensively used in the industry, but the degree of acid varies with different processes. This extraction step is a multistage process, and the extraction temperature usually is increased in later extraction steps, which ensures minimum thermal degradation of the extracted gelatin.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{inactivity}} as a {{child could}} result in physical inactivity as an adult. In a fitness survey of 6,000 adults, researchers discovered that 25% {{of those who were}} considered active at ages 14 to 19 were also active adults, compared to 2% of those who were inactive at ages 14 to 19, who were now said to be active adults. Staying physically inactive leaves unused energy in the body, most of which is stored <b>as</b> <b>fat.</b> Researchers studied 16 men over a 14-day period and fed them 50% more of their energy required every day through fats and carbohydrates. They discovered that carbohydrate overfeeding produced 75–85% excess energy being stored as body fat and fat overfeeding produced 90–95% storage of excess energy as body fat.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea that}} free {{radicals}} are toxic agents was first proposed by Rebeca Gerschman and colleagues. In 1956, Denham Harman proposed the free-radical theory {{of aging and}} even demonstrated that free radical reactions contribute to the degradation of biological systems. Oxidative damage of many types accumulate with age, such as oxidative stress that oxygen-free radicals, because the free radical theory of aging argues that aging results from the damage generated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS are small, highly reactive, oxygen-containing molecules that can damage a complex of cellular components such <b>as</b> <b>fat,</b> proteins, or from DNA, they are naturally generated in small amounts during the body's metabolic reactions. These conditions become more common as we age, including diseases related to aging, such as dementia, cancer and heart disease.|$|E
