Speculations of foul play began early on in the case; however, investigators were unable to find any other DNA at the scene besides Zahau's. On September 2, the San Diego County Sheriff's Department formally announced their finding that Zahau committed suicide.|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{performed}} [...] "Oh Father" [...] on her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour with [...] "Live to Tell", {{during the}} second segment of the show. As the performance of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] ended, Madonna, who {{was dressed in a}} clergyman's robe with a crucifix around her neck, and a veil <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> knelt on a church nave, while incense fumes wafted around her. She started singing [...] "Live to Tell" [...] from a confession bench, with Roman columns and a platform full of votive candles in the background. In the middle of the song, she started singing [...] "Oh Father" [...] while a dancer in a black frock played the role of a priest. The dancer, Carlton Wilborn, recalled that this performance required a lot of rehearsal time, since the dance portrayed Madonna as a woman trying to find her religion. He explained: [...] "One side knew she needed it, another side was resistant, and our dance represented that battle inside." [...] At the end of the performance, Wilborn pushed down Madonna's head before pulling her back up again, thus portraying his role as the priest, trying to wake up Madonna to the importance of religion. Two different performances were taped and released on video, the Blond Ambition – Japan Tour 90, taped in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and the Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990.|$|E
500|$|Scully goes to warn Fellig that he {{is about}} to be charged for murder, and accuses him of {{profiting}} from people's deaths. In his darkroom, Fellig shows Scully a photo of a dead woman with an odd fuzzy shape <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> which the photographer claims is Death. When asked why he bothers to try to photograph Death, Fellig says that it is so he can look Death in the face and finally die. He claims to be 149 years old, and says he cannot kill himself. Scully points out that most people would like to live forever, but Fellig says that he has experienced everything, and that even love does not last forever. Suddenly, he notices that Scully is gray, and says, [...] "Count your blessings." [...] When she asks about the science of his immortality, he says he was meant to die of yellow fever, but he refused to look Death in the face, so instead Death took the kind nurse who had taken care of him. [...] Fellig takes a photo just as Ritter enters and shoots. The bullet passes right through the camera and through Fellig into Scully, who collapses. While Ritter rushes to call an ambulance, Fellig asks Scully whether she saw Death and begs her to close her eyes. He covers her hand with his own. The color returns to Scully's hand as Fellig's turns gray. Looking up, he dies.|$|E
500|$|Canning reappeared {{at about}} 10pm on 29January 1753. [...] At {{the sight of}} her daughter, whom she had not seen for almost a month, Elizabeth Canning fainted. [...] Once {{recovered}} she sent James Lord to fetch several neighbours, and inside only a few minutes the house was full. [...] Elizabeth was described as being in a [...] "deplorable condition"; her face and hands were black with dirt, she wore a shift, a petticoat, and a bedgown. [...] A dirty rag tied <b>around</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> was soaked with blood from a wounded ear. [...] According to her story she had been attacked by two men near Bedlam Hospital. [...] They had partially stripped her, robbed her and hit her in the temple, rendering her unconscious. [...] She awoke [...] "by a large road, where was water, with the two men that robbed me" [...] and was forced to walk to a house, where an old woman asked if she would [...] "go their way" [...] (become a prostitute). [...] Canning had refused, and the woman cut off her corset, slapped her face and pushed her upstairs into a loft. [...] There the young maidservant had remained for almost a month, with no visitors and existing only on bread and water. [...] The clothing she wore she had scavenged from a fireplace in the loft. [...] Canning had eventually made her escape by pulling some boards away from a window and walking the five-hour journey home. [...] She recalled hearing the name [...] "Wills or Wells", and as she had seen through the window a coachman she recognised, thought she had been held on the Hertford Road. [...] On this evidence, John Wintlebury and a local journeyman, Robert Scarrat, identified the house as that of [...] "Mother" [...] Susannah Wells at Enfield Wash, nearly [...] distant.|$|E

The officers had with them a 4-inch wide restraint belt with attached handcuffs, and leather straps and rolls of adhesive tape to restrain her thighs and ankles.

She wore few clothes, as some were likely removed in the process of the assault, including her jacket and backpack containing personal items. Her underwear was later discovered inside of her pants pocket. A possible explanation to why some of her belongings were not found at the scene is that the murderer may have taken souvenirs. Authorities surmise that Creek may have been murdered by someone that may have received prostitution services from her.|$|E
