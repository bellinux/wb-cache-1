These criticisms are reviewed in this paper and to them is added a criticism of the concept of ‘normal decision-making’ by the courts that is the basis of Burrows’ views. Heil v Rankin was far from normal decision-making, but in this it was merely of a piece with all <b>awards</b> <b>of</b> damages for non-pecuniary loss, for such damages have no grounding in the common law adjudication <b>of</b> <b>awards</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation.</b> The further development in Simmons v Castle of the judicial legislation effected in Heil v Rankin is also considered...|$|R

It ordered re-engagement under the Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 section 69 for 12 applicants, and gave compensation to the others.

The employer successfully appealed to the Employment Appeal Tribunal {{on the ground that}} the employment tribunal had had no jurisdiction to make an <b>award</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> for non-economic loss on a complaint of unfair dismissal.

The Workmen's Compensation Commission of New York provided an award to Jensen's family members, in accordance with the state statute. The <b>award</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> was objected to by the Southern Pacific Company, who argued that Jensen had been involved in interstate commerce {{at the time of his}} death and that rules of liability were to be determined by Congress.

5000|$|The Court {{held that}} the Fifth Amendment does not require that the United States pay a public condemnee {{compensation}} measured by the cost of acquiring a substitute facility that the condemnee {{has a duty to}} acquire, when the market value of the condemned property is ascertainable and when there is no showing of manifest injustice. Rather, [...] "Just compensation" [...] under the Fifth Amendment normally is to be measured by the market value of the property {{at the time of the}} taking, and this case is not one in which an exception is required because fair market value is not ascertainable.

On 22 December, Chelsea lodged a new appeal before the CAS seeking the annulment of the DRC’s decision. On 21 May 2007, a CAS panel upheld the club’s appeal, set aside the DRC’s decision, and referred the matter back to the DRC, “which does have jurisdiction to determine and impose the appropriate sporting sanction and/or order for compensation, if any, arising out of the dispute” between the Club and the Player," ...|$|E

40|$|The {{proposal}} of the East Coast Highway, connecting the West Coast to East Coast of Peninsular Malaysia {{was an effort}} undertaken {{by the government to}} provide infrastructure to better accessibility, hence, helps sustain the economic growth of the country. The purpose of the highway is to shorten the traveling time, and, thus boost the economic development of the States involved. However, the initial {{proposal of}} the highway in 1994 was postponed until the first work starts at the end of 2000. The long delay period is caused by various constraints in negotiation, acquisition of land and construction stages. The study seeks to review literatures on the provision of infrastructure with special reference to the process and procedure of land acquisitions and valuation for compensation purposes. Secondary data is gathered from public and private valuation reports on land taken and then compared to the <b>awards</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> paid to the affected landowners using statistical analysis. In the end, it was revealed that there are differences in the valuation for compensation between public and private valuation that had created dispute on the amount <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> <b>of</b> the value of land taken. There seems to be slightly different between the public valuation and value awarded to the affected landowners. In contrast, the private valuation seems generally disregarded. This indicates the practical aspect and applicability of the present code <b>of</b> land <b>compensation</b> to ensure the way to avoid delays in developing highway and providing necessary infrastructure to the people...|$|R

40|$|Each year {{large numbers}} of persons sustain injury as a {{consequence}} of criminal behaviour. All Australian jurisdictions provide State-funded compensation to those harmed in this way. In the case of vulnerable applicants, the Assessor must consider not simply the appropriate and fair amount of compensation, but also how a person will be affected by the payment of compensation. Often a vulnerable applicant will apply through a guardian or a public trustee, although many apply in person. This article examines the use of legislative provisions, rules, regulations and practices in the various Australian jurisdictions in relation to how vulnerable applications may be protected and supported once an <b>award</b> <b>of</b> <b>compensation</b> is made in their favour. Most jurisdictions provide for a mechanism by which compensation may be held in trust where the Assessor considers that the applicant may be unable to manage his or her financial affairs in his or her best interests. This article explores what factors are taken into account by Assessors in the absence of and pursuant to legislative directions. It considers how the approach may vary across jurisdictions and creative approaches to financial protection of vulnerable applicants...|$|E
