Some raised cows, pigs and chickens; others had horses for carrying firewood. There was little refrigeration, and perishables were difficult to keep. Before the mercantile came to Elcor, residents went to the J. P. Ahlin store in McKinley, or to the Saari, Campbell and Kraker Mercantile in Gilbert. Deliveries were made daily, with orders taken for the following day. People bought on credit and paid monthly, on paydays.|$|E
5|$|Also {{according}} to the 2006 census, the median income in 2005 for <b>all</b> <b>families</b> was $67,031, compared to the provincial average of $62,346. 55.7% of respondents 15 {{years of age and}} older claim to have a post-secondary certificate, diploma or degree, compared to 52.2% province-wide. The 2001 census found that 20.2% of Coquitlam residents are Protestant and 21.6% are Catholic. 10.8% belong to other Christian denominations, 8.6% are adherents of other religions, and 35% profess no religion.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Warren and David Himmelstein {{published}} {{a study on}} bankruptcy and medical bills, which found that half of <b>all</b> <b>families</b> filing for bankruptcy did so {{in the aftermath of}} a serious medical problem. They say that three-quarters of such families had medical insurance. This study was widely cited in policy debates, although some have challenged the study's methods and offered alternative interpretations of the data, suggesting that only seventeen percent of bankruptcies are directly attributable to medical expenses.|$|E

5|$|Beetles are a {{group of}} insects that form the order Coleoptera, in the {{superorder}} Endopterygota. Their front pair of wings is hardened into wing-cases, elytra, distinguishing them from most other insects. The Coleoptera, with about 400,000 species, is the largest of all orders, constituting almost 40% of described insects and 25% of all known animal life-forms; new species are discovered frequently. The largest of <b>all</b> <b>families,</b> the Curculionidae (weevils) with some 70,000 member species, belongs to this order. They are found in almost every habitat except {{the sea and the}} polar regions. They interact with their ecosystems in several ways: beetles often feed on plants and fungi, break down animal and plant debris, and eat other invertebrates. Some species are serious agricultural pests, such as the Colorado potato beetle, while others such as Coccinellidae (ladybirds or ladybugs) eat aphids, scale insects, thrips, and other plant-sucking insects that damage crops.|$|E

25|$|Ordovician–Silurian {{extinction}} events (End Ordovician or O–S): 450–440Ma at the Ordovician–Silurian transition. Two events {{occurred that}} killed off 27% of <b>all</b> <b>families,</b> 57% of all genera and 60% to 70% of all species. Together they are ranked by many scientists {{as the second}} largest of the five major extinctions in Earth's history in terms of percentage of genera that became extinct.|$|E
25|$|Late Devonian extinction: 375–360Ma {{near the}} Devonian–Carboniferous transition. At {{the end of}} the Frasnian Age in the later part(s) of the Devonian Period, a {{prolonged}} series of extinctions eliminated about 19% of <b>all</b> <b>families,</b> 50% of all genera and at least 70% of all species. This extinction event lasted perhaps as long as 20 million years, and there is evidence for a series of extinction pulses within this period.|$|E
25|$|Whilst nearly <b>all</b> <b>families</b> {{of medieval}} {{aristocracy}} have become patrilineally extinct, there are families today whose patrilineal ancestors were close cognatic descendants of old noble families, for example some Nordland families, {{the most prominent}} being the Ellingsen family, whose progenitor shipper and tradesman Elling Christophersen was a great-grandson of Margrethe Jonsdotter Benkestok, and the Christensen family of the Husby Estate, whose progenitor shipper and tradesman Anders Christensen was a great-great-grandson of aforementioned Margrethe.|$|E

25|$|Triassic–Jurassic {{extinction}} event (End Triassic): 201.3Ma at the Triassic–Jurassic transition. About 23% of <b>all</b> <b>families,</b> 48% of all genera (20% {{of marine}} families and 55% of marine genera) and 70% to 75% of all species became extinct. Most non-dinosaurian archosaurs, most therapsids, {{and most of}} the large amphibians were eliminated, leaving dinosaurs with little terrestrial competition. Non-dinosaurian archosaurs continued to dominate aquatic environments, while non-archosaurian diapsids continued to dominate marine environments. The Temnospondyl lineage of large amphibians also survived until the Cretaceous in Australia (e.g., Koolasuchus).|$|E

He has also threatened the wives with closing the unit down, and restarting it somewhere else under another cover—forcing the uprooting of <b>all</b> <b>families</b> involved.|$|E

The brief submitted by the Chapter emphasizes, also, on the necessity of a specific two-year residency training program that <b>all</b> <b>family</b> physicians would be obliged to complete before they become eligible to obtain a licence to practice.
