5|$|The rapid {{introduction}} of new types of radars working on different frequencies meant the IFF system had to respond to <b>an</b> <b>ever-increasing</b> list of signals, and the direct response of the Mk. II required <b>an</b> <b>ever-increasing</b> number of sub-models, each turned to different frequencies. By 1941 {{it was clear that}} this was going to grow without bound, and a new solution was needed. The result was a new series of IFF units which used the indirect interrogation technique. These operated on a fixed frequency, different from the radar. The interrogation signal was sent from the aircraft by pressing a button on the radar, which caused the signal to be sent out in pulses synchronized to the radar's main signal. The received signal was amplified and mixed into the same video signal as the radar, causing the same extended blip to appear.|$|E

The political influence of the Jagiellonian kings gradually diminished during this period, while the landed nobility took over <b>an</b> <b>ever-increasing</b> role in central government and national affairs.

The Jagiellonian Era is often regarded as a period of maximum political power, great prosperity, and in its later stage, a Golden Age of Polish culture.|$|E

They had six children in India: Henry (1805–1807), Lucy Martha (1807–1808), Lucy Elizabeth (1809–1835), Emily (1811–1833), Henry Martyn (1813–?), and Sophia (1815–?). The deaths of the infants Henry and Lucy Martha and later of young Emily and Lucy Elizabeth affected Sherwood deeply; she frequently named the heroes and heroines of her books (many of whom die) after her late children.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the model}} by sinologist Karl August Wittfogel, the loess soils of Shaanxi made it {{possible}} for the Chinese to develop irrigated agriculture early on. Although this allowed them to expand into the lower reaches of the Yellow River valley, such extensive waterworks on <b>an</b> <b>ever-increasing</b> scale required collective labour, something that could only be managed by some form of bureaucracy. Thus the scholar-bureaucrats came to the fore {{to keep track of the}} income and expenses of the granaries. Walled cities grew up around the granaries for reasons of defence along with ease of administration; they kept invaders out and ensured that citizens remained within. These cities combined to become feudal states, which eventually united to become an empire. Likewise, according to this model, walls not only enveloped cities as time went by, but also lined the borders of the feudal states and eventually the whole Chinese empire to provide protection against raids from the agrarian northern steppes.|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{exponential}} growth of documents on the Internet and the emergent need to organize them, the automated categorization of documents into predefined labels has received <b>an</b> <b>ever-increased</b> {{attention in the}} recent years. A wide range of supervised learning algorithms has been introduced to deal with text classification. Among all these classifiers, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a widely used classifier in text categorization community because of its simplicity and efficiency. However, KNN still suffers from inductive biases or model misfits that result from its assumptions, such as the presumption that training data are evenly distributed among all categories. In this paper, we propose a new refinement strategy, which we called as DragPushing, for the KNN Classifier. The experiments on three benchmark evaluation collections show that DragPushing achieved a significant improvement {{on the performance of}} the KNN Classifier...|$|R

The Court has remained at a minimum of five justices since that time.

The library grew to become the primary legal library for the state and includes more than seventy-thousand volumes.|$|E
5|$|The {{period between}} c. 500 and 1300 saw {{a major change}} in diet that {{affected}} most of Europe. More intense agriculture on <b>an</b> <b>ever-increasing</b> acreage resulted in a shift from animal products, like meat and dairy, to various grains and vegetables as the staple of the majority population. Before the 14th century bread was not as common among the lower classes, especially in the north where wheat was more difficult to grow. A bread-based diet became gradually more common during the 15th century and replaced warm intermediate meals that were porridge- or gruel-based. Leavened bread was more common in wheat-growing regions in the south, while unleavened flatbread of barley, rye or oats remained more common in northern and highland regions, and unleavened flatbread was also common as provisions for troops.|$|E
5|$|To {{supply the}} orders and to repay debts, Densmore began to {{manufacture}} the machine in summer 1871. During this time, {{the machine was}} revised to improve durability and the platen was redesigned after feedback from Western Union, which wanted the ability to print on a continuous roll, indicated that clipping paper to the platen was impractical. The new design, however, infringed a patent granted to Charles A. Washburn in November 1870; Washburn, consequently, received royalties on future production. In 1872, to manufacture the new machine in earnest, a former wheelwright shop was secured along with several employees. Although the machines worked well, the lack of economies of scale prevented the venture from yielding a profit. In exchange for funding the ventures, Densmore had been acquiring <b>an</b> <b>ever-increasing</b> ownership interest. Sholes was eventually bought out for a cash payment of $12,000. Glidden kept his one-tenth right of the patent. Densmore consulted with George W. N. Yost, a manufacturer {{with whom he had}} been acquainted, who suggested showing the machine to E. Remington and Sons. Remington, an arms manufacturer seeking to diversify after the Civil War, possessed the machining equipment and skilled machinists necessary to further develop the complex machine. A typewritten letter was sent to Remington, where executive Henry H. Benedict was impressed by the novelty and encouraged company president Philo Remington to pursue the device.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new ascending-price multi-unit auction protocol. As {{far as the}} authors are aware, {{this is the first}} protocol that has an open format, and in which sincere bidding is an equilibrium strategy, even if the marginal utilities of each agent can increase and agents can submit falsename bids. <b>As</b> <b>ever-increasing</b> numbers of companies and consumers are trading on Internet auctions, a new type of cheating called “false-name bids ” has been noticed. Specifically, there may be some agents with fictitious names such as multiple e-mail addresses. The VCG is not an open format, and truth-telling is no longer a dominant strategy if agents can submit false-name bids and the marginal utilities of each agent can increase. The Iterative Reducing (IR) protocol with a sealed-bid format is robust against falsename bids, although it requires the auctioneer to carefully pre-determine a reservation priceforoneunit. Open format protocols, such as the Ausubel auction, outperform sealed-bid format protocols in terms of the simplicity and privacy-preservation. These two advantages are said to encourage more agents to bid sincerely and to provide the seller with higher revenue. We extend the Ausubel auction to our proposed protocol which can handle the cases where the marginal utilities of each agent can increase. Moreover, it is robust against false-name bids and does not require the auctioneer to set a reservation price. Oursimulation result indicates that our protocol herein obtains a social surplus close to Pareto efficient and that it outperforms the IR with respect to the social surplus and the seller’s revenue...|$|R
