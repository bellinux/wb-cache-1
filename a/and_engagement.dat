5|$|By {{applying}} post-structuralist {{theory to}} anarchism, Newman presents {{an account of}} post-anarchism.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between democratic classroom environment <b>and</b> student <b>engagement</b> <b>and</b> its three dimensions: cognitive <b>engagement,</b> emotional <b>engagement</b> <b>and</b> behavioral <b>engagement.</b> Previous research has extensively reported about the positive relationship between democratic classroom environment <b>and</b> student <b>engagement.</b> However, these studies have evaluated only {{the relationship between}} democratic classroom environment <b>and</b> student <b>engagement</b> neglecting the three dimensions. This study contributes to this gap by examining the three dimensions as well. Thus, the paper had two aims: First to investigate the relationship between democratic classroom and the three dimensions of classroom engagement: behavioral <b>engagement,</b> emotional <b>engagement</b> <b>and</b> cognitive <b>engagement</b> <b>and</b> second, to examine the moderating role of teacher between democratic classroom <b>and</b> student <b>engagement.</b> A survey questionnaire was utilized to collect data from secondary school teachers. Since the study was based on correlation method, therefore, regression analysis were conducted to test the hypotheses {{of the study and}} to analyze the relationship between the variables. The findings of the study showed that there is a strong positive correlation between democratic classroom environment <b>and</b> student <b>engagement</b> <b>and</b> its three dimensions: behavioral, emotional and cognitive. The study also discovered that teacher moderates the relationship between democratic classroom environment <b>and</b> student <b>engagement.</b> O...|$|R

5|$|Current Electoral College rules tend to {{decrease}} voter turnout in states without close races. Voters living outside the swing {{states have a}} greater certainty of which candidate is likely to win their state. This knowledge of the probable outcome decreases their incentive to vote. A report by the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate found that 2004 voter turnout in competitive swing states grew by 6.3% from the previous presidential election, compared to an increase of only 3.8% in noncompetitive states. A report by The Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning <b>and</b> <b>Engagement</b> (CIRCLE) found that turnout among eligible voters under age 30 was 64.4% in the 10 closest battleground states and only 47.6% {{in the rest of}} the country—a 17% gap.|$|E

5|$|T.C. Russell is {{the patriarch}} of the Russell family. He is {{characterized}} by his violent temper and hatred of Julian Crane for supposedly injuring him in a hit-and-run attack, and destroying his chances of becoming a professional tennis player. T.C. is initially portrayed as a harsh and unforgiving parent; he pushes Whitney to train to be a tennis champion, as he once wanted to be, and disapproves of her relationship with Chad Harris-Crane, feeling it is a distraction. He is also violent with Simone when she reveals she is a lesbian. After learning about Eve's past relationship with Julian and her responsibility for the car crash that ended his tennis career, T. C. files for divorce and has a brief romance <b>and</b> <b>engagement</b> to her adoptive sister Liz Sanbourne. The show humanizes T.C. and softens his temper during his recovery from a stroke; his final storylines focus on his attempts to rebuild {{his relationship with his}} ex-wife and children. In 2007, he moves to New Orleans to help Whitney with her pregnancy and reconnect with Simone. T.C. does not appear in the show after its transition to DirecTV, and he is neither seen nor mentioned in the series finale.|$|E

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were focussed on exploring the relationship between the individual constructs psychological contract breach (PCB), job satisfaction, organisational support and that of work engagement to add to previous literature. The relationship between PCB <b>and</b> work <b>engagement</b> has been previously researched and two different views are held. One that believes there is no direct relationship between PCB <b>and</b> work <b>engagement,</b> <b>and</b> one that believes there is a direct relationship. These different views confirm the complexity of the relationship that exist between PCB <b>and</b> work <b>engagement.</b> To explore this complex relationship we introduced two moderators to ascertain their moderating effect individually on the relationship between PCB <b>and</b> work <b>engagement.</b> The benefits to organisations and employees when work engagement levels are high have been researched and confirmed. An online survey specifically addressing the research objectives was sent out to members of a service organisation who are employed at different organisations across various industries within South Africa. A total of 1029 responses were analysed, using simple linear regression models to determine the relationship between psychological contract breach, job satisfaction and organisational support individually <b>and</b> work <b>engagement</b> <b>and</b> multi variable regression models were used to determine the moderating effect that job satisfaction and organisational support has as moderators on the relationship between psychological contract breach <b>and</b> work <b>engagement.</b> For the sample population, it was determined that this study support the view that there is a significant direct relationship between PCB breach <b>and</b> work <b>engagement</b> as well as between job satisfaction <b>and</b> work <b>engagement</b> <b>and</b> organisational support <b>and</b> work <b>engagement.</b> It was determined that job satisfaction has a moderating effect on the relationship that exist between psychological contract breach <b>and</b> work <b>engagement</b> <b>and</b> that organisational support does not have a moderating effect on the relationship.
