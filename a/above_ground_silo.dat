There are many publications that investigate the effect of climate change and deforestation on <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> C stock.

This study investigates the effect of moose browsing on <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> C stock in sucssetional boreal forests. Boreal forests are a habitat for different animals and plants. Studying the relationship of herbivory and plants used to investigate their interaction effect on ecosystem. The objective {{of this study is to}} investigate the impact of moose browsing on <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> biomass and C stock in boreal ecosystem. In this study data were collected from 15 browsed and unbrowsed recent clear-cut treatments in Norwegian boreal forests. The result indicated that even though, the deciduous species showed lower <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> biomass in the browsed treatment than the unbrowsed treatment, only rowan <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> biomass was significantly affected by moose browsing. Although Spruce and juniper showed higher <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> biomass in the browsed treatment, the interaction effect of treatment over year was not statistically significant. Moose browsing significantly affected the <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> C- stock in the study sites. Based on the result at the end of the study, the browsed treatment showed lower mean <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> C stock than the unbrowsed treatment. The current study confirmed that the presence of moose had negative impact on biomass of rowan and total <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> C-stock in Norwegian boreal forests.

Extensive field data were collected to characterize forest vegetation parameters in the plots. Ground inventory data viz., GBH, tree height was collected.

40|$|General EcologyThe {{invasive}} cattail Typha x glauca (referred to hereafter as Typha) decimates {{species diversity}} and abundance of native flora after its introduction to Great Lakes marshes. In some areas the conservation and restoration of marshes is of high priority, however, the optimum management option for controlling Typha growth and reproduction {{has yet to}} be determined. This study, conducted in a marsh in the northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan, examines the impacts of different types of management (removal of <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> Typha biomass, and removal of <b>above</b> and below <b>ground</b> Typha biomass) on the changes in species diversity in the marsh and on the biomass and height of Typha populations following management. We found that Typha biomass decreased significantly with removal of <b>above</b> and below <b>ground</b> biomass, and decreased insignificantly with removal of <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> biomass. Removal of <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> biomass significantly decreased Typha height, but removal of <b>above</b> and below <b>ground</b> biomass did not have a significant impact. Species diversity increased more with removal of <b>above</b> and below <b>ground</b> biomass than removal of only <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> biomass. Our conclusions are that removal of both <b>above</b> and below <b>ground</b> biomass is optimum to achieve higher species diversity and increase the abundance and number of native species in the marsh, but that removal of only <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> biomass due to limitations on labor or available funding for removal would still result in benefits to the native plant community while reducing Typha success. However, we caution that removal of only <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> biomass may have to be repeated over time as the Typha community regenerates from the rhizomes left behind...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: <b>Above</b> <b>ground</b> biomass {{production}} was estimated in a 25 year-old Pinus caribaea {{stand in the}} land belonging to the University of Peradeniya, in lower Hantana in the Central Province. Twenty four pine trees felled were used to collect data for developing allometric biomass equations and to estimate the <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> biomass. Empirical formulae were derived to estimate the <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> biomass separately for the cylindrical lower part and the conical {{upper part of the}} pine trees. Using these site-specific formulae derived from empirical data, the <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> biomass of the 25 year-old P. caribaea stand was found to be 194 t/ha. A second estimation of 136 t/ha for the <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> biomass was obtained using standard formulae. Of the live standing crop, the stem represented 60 %, the branches 17 %, leaves 13 %, cones 3 % and dead branches 7 %. This pine stand had 695 pine trees/ha, a mean diameter at breast height (dbh) of 20. 1 cm, a mean height of 20. 7 m and mean basal area of 23. 6 m 2 /ha. The estimated <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> biomass showed that the P. caribaea plantation studied is a good sink for sequestered carbon. Since the study was based on actual measurements through destructive sampling, yielding more accurate estimates than from standard derivations, the derived empirical formulae in this study are recommended for estimation of the <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> biomass of comparable pine tree stands in the Hantana plantation and also other plantations in similar steeply undulating topography. Based on a meta-analysis of literature data on P. caribaea in the tropics, it was found that a P. caribaea plantation up to an age of 25 years attains maximum <b>above</b> <b>ground</b> biomass when it reached ca. 22 years...|$|R
