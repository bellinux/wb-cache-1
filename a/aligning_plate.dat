40|$|Although {{most of the}} intraplate {{volcanism}} {{in ocean}} basins is expressed in linear chains, {{not all of these}} can be attributed to a stationary hotspot. Many ridges do not show a linear age-distance relationship predicted by the hotspot hypothesis- such as the Cook-Austal, Magellan or Line Islands, and Pukapuka ridges. Small-scale sub-lithospheric convection (SSC) has been proposed to account for the volcanism at Puka-puka [Buck and Parmentier, 1986] and may also explain enigmatic geochronology at other intraplate ridges. In the Earth’s uppermost mantle SSC is likely to develop due to instabilities of the thickened thermal boundary layer below mature oceanic lithosphere. It is charac-terized by convective rolls <b>aligning</b> <b>plate</b> motion. Their onset is earlier (i. e. beneath younger and thinner lithosphere) for lower mantle viscosities (e. g. for hot or wet man-tle) or adjacent to lateral thermal or compositional heterogeneity. In these cases, par-tial melt potentially emerges in the upwelling limbs of SSC. Partial melting changes the compositional buoyancy owing to melt retention and additional depletion of the residue. Therefore, it promotes upwelling and allows for further melting. This self...|$|E

50|$|BSCCO was {{the first}} HTS {{material}} {{to be used for}} making practical superconducting wires. All HTS have an extremely short coherence length, of the order of 1.6 nm. This means that the grains in a polycrystalline wire must be extremely good contact - they must be atomically smooth. Further, because the superconductivity resides substantially only in the copper-oxygen planes the grains must be crystallographically aligned. BSCCO is therefore a good candidate because its grains can be aligned either by melt processing or by mechanical deformation. The double bismuth oxide layer is only weakly bonded by van der Waals forces. So like graphite or mica, deformation causes slip on these BiO planes and grains tend to deform into <b>aligned</b> <b>plates.</b> Further, because BSCCO has n=1, 2 and 3 members these naturally tend to accommodate low angle grain boundaries so that indeed they remain atomically smooth. Thus first-generation HTS wires (referred to as 1G) have been manufactured for many years now by companies such as American Superconductor Corporation (AMSC) in the USA and Sumitomo in Japan - though AMSC has now abandoned BSCCO wire in favour of 2G wire based on YBCO.|$|R

Contrary to prior analytical studies, using Wiener-Hopf techniques and thus restricted to semi-infinite plates, we use a, finite elements method which allows us to deal with plates of finite length. To take into account irrotational perturbations induced by the trailing edge of the plate, a potential formulation requires the introduction of a vortex sheet behind the plate. The key point of the method is to get access at the singular coefficient of the velocity potential near the trailing edge, in order to cancel it using the so-called Kutta-Joukowski condition. This approach leads to an efficient finite elements method, and numerical computations are presented: we show the amplitude of the vortex sheet versus the Mach number and the plate length and the dissipated acoustic power versus the Mach number and the frequency. This method is extended to the case of two <b>aligned</b> <b>plates</b> to analyze the influence of the choice of the boundary condition on the downstream plate which interacts with a vortex sheet. © IMACS...|$|R

40|$|The Collaborative Research Centre SFB/TR 39 PT-PIESA is {{developing}} mass production technologies and process chains for the fabrication of aluminium piezo composites, {{which can be}} used as raw material for "smart sheet metal" [1]. Microstructuring by forming is a challenging task concerning material flow, tool and process design [2]. In this study, a hybrid forming process combined of micro impact extrusion and shear displacement is presented and discussed. The formed microstructure consists of ten parallel primary cavities with cross sections of 0. 30 ́ 20. 3 mm 2 and four larger secondarycavities which are surrounding the primary cavities. High demands are made concerning precision and reproducibility of the cavities' geometry according to the function of the cavities, which is to serve as collets for sensitive piezo rods. The microstructure has to be formed with one stroke of the stamp. Micro backward impact extrusion is chosen for structuring the primary cavities since it allows accurate forming without <b>aligning</b> die <b>plate</b> and stamp due to a flat die plate. Shear displacement forming, which is the selected process for the secondary cavities, requires a structured and <b>aligned</b> die <b>plate</b> but the forming forces are significantly lower than forming the same geometry with an extrusion process, which in turn increases the accuracy. The investigations are focused on the characterization of samples formed with the hybrid process in comparison to structures which are formed solely by impact extrusion.

First experiments show promising results, whereas higher degrees of deformation could be reached at lower forming forces...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe grain-damage and pinning {{mechanism}} of Bercovici and Ricard (2012) for lithospheric shear-localization is employed in two-dimensional flow calculations to test {{its ability to}} generate toroidal (strike-slip) motion and influence plate evolution. This mechanism posits that damage to the interface between phases in a polycrystalline material like peridotite (composed primarily of olivine and pyroxene) increases the number of small Zener pinning surfaces, which then constrain mineral grains to ever smaller sizes, regardless of creep mechanism. This effect allows a self-softening feedback in which damage and grain-reduction can co-exist with a grain-size dependent diffusion creep rheology; moreover, grain growth and weak-zone healing are greatly impeded by Zener pinning thereby leading to long-lived relic weak zones. The fluid dynamical calculations employ source-sink driven flow {{as a proxy for}} convective poloidal flow (upwelling/downwelling and divergent/convergent motion), and the coupling of this flow with non-linear rheological mechanisms excites toroidal or strike-slip motion. The numerical experiments show that pure dislocation-creep rheology, and grain-damage without Zener pinning (as occurs in a single-phase assemblages) permit only weak localization and toroidal flow; however, the full grain-damage with pinning readily allows focussed localization and intense, plate-like toroidal motion and strike-slip deformation. Rapid plate motion changes are also tested with abrupt rotations of the source-sink field after a plate-like configuration is developed; the post-rotation flow and material property fields retain memory of the original configuration for extensive periods, leading to suboptimally <b>aligned</b> <b>plate</b> boundaries (e. g., strike-slip margins non-parallel to plate motion), oblique subduction, and highly localized, weak and long lived acute plate-boundary junctions such as at what is observed at the Aleutian-Kurile intersection. The grain-damage and pinning theory therefore readily satisfies key plate-tectonic metrics of localized toroidal motion and plate-boundary inheritance, and thus provides a predictive theory for the generation of plate tectonics on Earth and other planets...|$|R

40|$|We {{explore the}} high-shear and gap-dependent {{rheological}} properties of multiphase complex fluids using narrow-gap parallel-plate rheometry. This technique {{has been developed}} to explore the apparent rheological properties of such fluids when they are confined to length scales {{comparable to that of}} their underlying microstructure. This is particularly relevant to processes such as lubrication and microfluidics, whereby complex fluids are typically confined to length scales of below 100 mu m and subjected to shear rates well in excess of 1000 s(- 1). We demonstrate that the parallel-plate geometry is capable of accessing extremely high shear rates (e. g. 10 (5) s(- 1)) using narrow gap heights (5 - 100 mu m) for Newtonian, shear-thinning, and elastic fluids. In order to obtain meaningful measurements, numerous errors that arise must be accounted for. The most apparent error is that the measured viscosity decreases with gap height at gaps below a few hundred microns. This results from an error in the gap that is typically 5 - 30 mu m and usually occurs due to misalignment, of the parallel plates, although there is also a contribution from the squeeze flow of air during the gap-zeroing procedure for very accurately <b>aligned</b> <b>plates.</b> The effect of microscale-confinement on the apparent viscosity and viscoelastic properties of microstructured fluids and suspensions is also considered, whereby confinement to gaps that are approaching that of the characteristic microstructure length scale causes a solid-like response with a substantially enhanced storage modulus and apparent yield stress. Despite confinement and jamming effects at low stresses, at high stress the multiphase fluids flow with a viscosity similar to that of bulk fluid and continuous phase even when the gap height is similar to the particle size. Slip and depletion effects are particularly apparent at narrow gaps and must be considered in order to obtain reliable rheological measurements. It is anticipated that the utilisation of these techniques to explore the dynamics of confined microstructures will lead to new insights into the behaviour of such systems under the extreme conditions of narrow gaps and/or high shear rates that are experienced during many processes and/or applications.
