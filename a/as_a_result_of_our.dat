25|$|Another {{controversial}} {{issue is the}} extent to which human behaviours resemble animal communication, or whether all such communication has disappeared <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> linguistic capacity. Some of our bodily features—eyebrows, beards and moustaches, deep adult male voices, perhaps female breasts—strongly resemble adaptations to producing signals. Ethologists such as Irenäus Eibl-Eibesfeldt have argued that facial gestures such as smiling, grimacing, and the eyebrow flash on greeting are universal human communicative signals that can be related to corresponding signals in other primates. Given how recently spoken language has emerged, it is very likely that human body language does include some more or less involuntary responses that have a similar origin to the communication we have.|$|E
25|$|Both ecofeminism {{and deep}} ecology {{put forward a}} new {{conceptualization}} of the self. Some ecofeminists, such as Marti Kheel, argue that self-realization and identification with all nature places {{too much emphasis on}} the whole, {{at the expense of the}} independent being. Similarly, some ecofeminists place more emphasis on the problem of androcentrism rather than anthropocentrism. To others, like Karen J. Warren, the domination of women is tethered conceptually and historically to the domination of nature. Ecofeminism denies abstract individualism and embraces the interconnectedness of the living world; relationships, including our relationship with non-human nature, are not extrinsic to our identity and are essential in defining what it means to be human. Warren argues that hierarchical classifications in general, such as racism or speciesism, are all forms of discrimination and are no different from sexism. Thus, anthropocentrism is simply another form of discrimination <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> flawed value structure and should be abolished.|$|E

When this news broke, {{the price of gasoline}} nervously dropped two cents a gallon, and Chico and I, along with the other shows, were dropped from the network." [...] In his 1976 book, The Secret Word Is Groucho, he writes, [...] "Company sales, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> show, had risen precipitously.

2500|$|The IBM {{archives}} of Frequently Asked Questions notes an inquiry {{about whether he}} said in the 1950s that he foresaw a market potential for only five electronic computers. The document says no, but quotes his son and then IBM President Thomas J. Watson, Jr., at the annual IBM stockholders meeting, April 28, 1953, as speaking about the IBM 701 Electronic Data Processing Machine, which it identifies as [...] "the company's first production computer designed for scientific calculations". He said that [...] "IBM had developed a paper plan for such a machine and took this paper plan across the country to some 20 concerns that we thought could use such a machine. I would like {{to tell you that the}} machine rents for between $12,000 and $18,000 a month, so it was not the type of thing that could be sold from place to place. But, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> trip, on which we expected to get orders for five machines, we came home with orders for 18." [...] Watson, Jr., later gave a slightly different version of the story in his autobiography, where he said the initial market sampling indicated 11 firm takers and 10 more prospective orders.|$|E
60|$|Another {{criticism}} {{may be made}} {{upon the}} author's peculiar delimitation of his subject. We will accept Mr. Seeley's definition of history as {{having to do with}} the state, with the growth and the changes of a certain corporate society, acting through certain functionaries and certain assemblies. If the expansion of England was important, not less important were other changes vitally affecting the internal fortunes of the land that was destined to undergo this process. Expansion only acquired its significance in consequence of what happened in England itself. It is the growth of population at home, <b>as</b> <b>a</b> <b>result</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> vast extension of manufactures, that makes our colonies both possible and important. There would be nothing capricious or perverse in treating the expansion of England over the seas as strictly secondary to the expansion of England within her own shores, and to all the causes of it in the material resources and the energy and ingenuity of her sons at home. Supposing that a historian were to choose to fix on the mechanical and industrial development of England as the true point of view, we are not sure that as good a case might not be made out for the inventions of Arkwright, Hargreaves, and Crompton as for the acquisition of the colonies; for Brindley and Watt as for Clive and Hastings. Enormous territory is only one of the acquisitions or instruments of England, and we know no reason why that particular element of growth should be singled out as overtopping the other elements that made it so important as it is. It is not the mere multiplication of a race, nor its diffusion over the habitable globe that sets its deepest mark on the history of a state, but rather those changes in idea, disposition, faculty, and, above all, in institution, which settle what manner of race it shall be that does in this way replenish the earth. From that point of view, after all, as Tocqueville said, the greatest theatre of human affairs is not at Sydney, it is not even at Washington, it is still in our old world of Europe.|$|E
