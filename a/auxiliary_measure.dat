50|$|Many {{light machine}} guns ({{such as the}} Bren gun or the M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle) were magazine-fed. Others, such as the MG 34, could be fed either from a belt or from a magazine. Modern light machine guns are {{designed}} to fire more rounds of a smaller caliber and, as such, tend to be belt-fed from a detachable box magazine, some such as the FN Minimi will also accept rifle magazine feeding as an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>measure</b> when belted ammunition has been exhausted.|$|E

Magazine feeding is used only as an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>measure,</b> when belted ammunition has been exhausted. The ammunition belt is introduced into the feed tray, magazines are seated inside the magazine port at a 45° angle, located beneath the feed tray port. When a belt is placed in the feed tray it covers the magazine port. Likewise, a magazine inserted into the magazine well will prevent the simultaneous insertion of a belt. The magazine port, when not in use, is closed with an L-shaped hinged flap equipped with a tooth, which engages a corresponding opening in the magazine and serves as a magazine release. This feature was developed by FN's Maurice V. Bourlet and allows the Minimi to be instantly changed from belt feed to magazine feed without any modification.|$|E

40|$|Surrogate {{models are}} {{data-driven}} models used to accurately mimic the complex {{behavior of a}} system. They are often used to approximate computationally expensive simulation code in order {{to speed up the}} exploration of design spaces. A crucial step in the building of surrogate models is finding a good set of hyperparameters, which determine the behavior of the model. This is especially important when dealing with sparse data, as the models are in that case more prone to overfitting. Cross-validation is often used to optimize the hyperparameters of surrogate models, however it is computationally expensive and can still lead to overfitting or other erratic model behavior.

Therefore, novel methods to prolong the effective duration time of Btx-A are highly needed. Rats were assigned to three major groups: control group (n = 30), Btx-A group (n = 30), and IGF- 1 Ab groups. IGF- 1 Ab groups were composed by sub-groups A 1 –A 5 (each has 25 rats) for the subsequent IGF- 1 Ab dose-effect study. Muscle strength was determined by a survey system for rat lower limbs nerve and muscle function. Muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK), Insulin-like growth factor binding protein- 5 (IGFBP 5), and growth-associated protein, 43 -kDa (GAP 43) were determined by real-time polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) and Western blot. We found that Btx-A decreased the muscle strength, with a paralysis maintained for 70 days. IGF- 1 Ab prolonged the effective duration time of Btx-A. Real-time PCRs and Western blot showed that IGF- 1 Ab delayed the increase of MuSK and IGFBP 5 after Btx-A injection, without affecting GAP 43.

40|$|The {{population}} dynamics of fisheries stock enhancement, {{and its potential}} for generating benefits over and above those obtainable from optimal exploitation of wild stocks alone are poorly understood and highly controversial. I review pertinent knowledge of fish population biology, and extend the dynamic pool theory of fishing to stock enhancement by unpacking recruitment, incorporating regulation in the recruited stock, and accounting for biological differences between wild and hatchery fish. I then analyse the dynamics of stock enhancement and its potential role in fisheries management, using the candidate stock of North Sea sole as an example and considering economic as well as biological criteria. Enhancement through release of recruits or advanced juveniles is predicted to increase total yield and stock abundance, but reduce abundance of the naturally recruited stock component through compensatory responses or overfishing. Economic feasibility of enhancement is subject to strong constraints, including trade-offs between the costs of fishing and hatchery releases. Costs of hatchery fish strongly influence optimal policy, which may range from no enhancement at high cost {{to high levels of}} stocking and fishing effort at low cost. Release of genetically maladapted fish reduces the effectiveness of enhancement, and is most detrimental overall if fitness of hatchery fish is only moderately compromised. As a temporary measure for the rebuilding of depleted stocks, enhancement cannot substitute for effort limitation, and is advantageous as an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>measure</b> only if the population has been reduced to a very low proportion of its unexploited biomass.

Tenho como foco a administração do Ministro dos Negócios do Estado Coutto Ferraz, procurando explorar principalmente três questões: Que perfil de professor atenderia às políticas públicas impostas pelo Governo? Que medidas tomadas pelo Governo vão tentar organizar, definir e controlar o cargo do professor público? Quais as reações encontradas à essa intervenção? Para tal exercício tratei de explorar a hipótese de que o concurso se constitui em medida auxiliar no processo de modelação do ofício, buscando examinar o efeito das regras instituídas na constituição do modelo de profissional para o Estado imperial. Para tal empreendimento o trabalho foi organizado em cinco capítulos: o primeiro procurou caracterizar a sociedade imperial a fim de perceber a forma como ela associa a idéia de Civilização com Instrução. Nesta perspectiva, pretendi destacar as estratégias produzidas pela administração do Estado imperial em relação à educação da população como um dos meios de controle e manutenção da ordem monárquica. No segundo capítulo, procurei refletir sobre o processo de estabelecimento das ordens desenvolvido em meio à construção do próprio Estado monárquico. Para isso destaquei as ordens: religiosa, médica e militar pela forte ligação destes campos com a questão da instrução no século XIX. Este esforço teve por fim, entender o processo de profissionalização desses agentes sociais no Brasil, aproximando-os da questão da qualificação e recrutamento do profissional desejado para estas diferentes ordens, percebendo os possíveis isomorfismos e desvios entre as formas de construção desses campos disciplinares. No terceiro capítulo, analisei as fontes (legislativas, relatórios, provas, atas, requerimentos e ofícios diversos) com as quais trabalhei na intenção de compreender a forma como a ordem docente foi configurada no processo de recrutamento e profissionalização do magistério primário, secundário e superior, procurando entender o sentido do recrutamento de professores no período estudado. Na quarta parte deste estudo, tratei da identidade destes profissionais, examinando o estatuto dos professores do século XIX, formas de adequação e de afastamento em relação às normas de controle e a contribuição para o processo de profissionalização docente ocorrido no período. No quinto e último capítulo procurei analisar as técnicas de recrutamento baseado em representações da classe, produzidas a partir de diferentes posições de Governo. This work aims the lecturing professionalization, {{particularly the}} recruiting process of teachers {{to the public}} education. I focus on {{the administration of the}} Minister Coutto Ferraz, trying to address three main questions: What sort of teacher would attend the Government demands? What measures, undertaken by the Government, define and control the position of public teacher? What reactions to this intervention occurred? To achieve these objectives I studied the hypothesis that the examination constitutes itself as an <b>auxiliary</b> <b>measure</b> in the teaching modeling, and aims to determine the effect of the rules of the Imperial State professional Model constitution. In order to successfully consider all facts involved, this work has been organized in five chapters: the first has the objective of describing the imperial society {{in such a way that}} it becomes comprehensible how it associates the concept of Civilization with the one of Lecturing. From this point of view, I intended to mark the strategies developed by the Imperial State regarding people education as a way of control and support of the monarchist order. In the second chapter I considered the process of the orders establishment developed at the same time of the Monarchy itself. To that purpose I pointed out the religious, military and medical orders, strongly related to the theme lecturing in the 19 th century. As a result it was possible to understand the process of professionalization of these social agents in Brazil. This way they could be studied considering the professional qualification and recruiting issues to the mentioned orders. Eventually the isomorphism and deviations between the construction form of these disciplinary field could be noticed. In the third chapter I analyzed the sources (legislative, reports, exams, records, solicitations and several official letters) which I made use in order to comprehend how the teaching order was configured during the process of the primary, secondary and superior professorship recruiting and professionalization, trying to determine the meaning of the recruiting of teachers in the studied period. In the forty part, the professionals identity was studied, the 19 th century teachers statute, ways of suitability and removal regarding the control rules and the contribution to the process of lecturing professionalization were considered as well.

40|$|A obtenção de plantas de arquitetura mais ereta vem crescendo em importância devido à demanda do produtor de áreas irrigadas com relação à possibilidade de colheita mecanizada, redução dos problemas de doenças e facilidade dos tratos culturais. Em geral vem se utilizando uma escala de notas para avaliar a arquitetura de plantas de feijão, porém, essa escala é visual, trabalhosa e depende de grande experiência do avaliador. Trabalhos recentes (Moura, 2011 e Silva, 2011) relatam que o diâmetro do hipocótilo é um indicador efetivo da arquitetura de plantas do feijoeiro e uma associação significativa entre o diâmetro do hipocótilo de plantas F 2 e suas progênies derivadas potencializaria os ganhos com a seleção visando melhoria da arquitetura do feijoeiro em programas de seleção recorrente, bem como a eficiência da seleção recorrente fenotípica. Ademais, no melhoramento do feijoeiro, selecionar plantas que associem boa produtividade e arquitetura ereta tem sido a preferência dos melhoristas. Os objetivos deste trabalho foram verificar a associação entre diâmetro do hipocótilo de plantas F 2 e de suas progênies F 2 : 3, e obter estimativas de parâmetros genéticos, visando a escolha da melhor estratégia de seleção para melhoria do porte do feijoeiro e analisar a eficácia do índice genótipo-ideótipo na seleção de famílias de feijoeiro quanto ao porte e produtividade de grãos, avaliadas em diferentes ambientes. Foram avaliadas 96 famílias F 2, suas progênies F 2 : 3 e quatro testemunhas (BRSMG Majestoso, L 1, BRSMG Madrepérola e A 525) em blocos ao acaso, com três repetições, quanto à arquitetura de plantas, diâmetro do hipocótilo e produtividade de grãos nas safras do inverno de 2010 e da seca de 2011. Observou-se que a associação entre o DH de plantas F 2 e caracteres relacionados ao porte nas progênies F 2 : 3 foram de {{magnitude}} relativamente baixa, comparada às estimativas de correlações considerando os genitores, indicando grande influência do ambiente na determinação do diâmetro do hipocótilo em plantas individuais de feijoeiro. Houve predominância de efeito aditivo na determinação deste caráter, que apresentou maior precisão e acurácia comparada à avaliação do porte pela nota de arquitetura das plantas, evidenciando que o diâmetro do hipocótilo pode ser utilizado como medida auxiliar na seleção de progênies no melhoramento do feijoeiro visando melhoria do porte das plantas, desde que a seleção se baseie, de acordo com a análise de repetibilidade, na média de pelo menos 40 plantas na parcela. Além disso, foram observadas famílias com produtividade de grãos acima dos maiores valores apresentados pelos pais nas duas safras, com notas de arquitetura e diâmetro do hipocótilo comparáveis aos genitores mais eretos. A utilização do índice da distância genótipo-ideótipo foi eficaz na seleção de famílias visando melhoria do porte e produtividade de grãos, avaliadas em diferentes ambientes, com destaque para as famílias da população oriunda do cruzamento entre as linhagens A 525 e BRSMG Majestoso. The obtaining {{of plants}} of more erect architecture {{is growing in}} importance due to the demand of the producing of irrigated areas regarding the possibility of automated crop, reduction {{of the problems of}} diseases and easiness of the cultural treatments. In general it comes if using a scale of notes to evaluate the bean plants architecture, however, that scale is visual, difficult and it depends on the appraiser's great experience. Recent works (Moura, 2011 and Silva, 2011) tell that the hypocotyl diameter is an effective indicator of the bean plant architecture and a significant association among hypocotyl diameter of F 2 plants and their derived progenies would potentiate the earnings with the selection seeking improvement of the bean plant architecture in programs of appealing selection, as well as the efficiency of the phenotypic recurrent selection. Besides, in the improvement of the bean plant, to select plants to associate good productivity and erect architecture has been the preference of the breeders. The objectives of this work were to verify the association among hypocotyl diameter of F 2 plants and their F 2 : 3 progenies, and to obtain estimates of genetic parameters, seeking the choice of the best selection strategy for improvement of the load of the bean plant and to analyze the effectiveness of the genotype-ideotype distance index in the selection of bean plant families as for the load and grains productivity, appraised in different atmospheres. They were appraised 96 F 2 families, their F 2 : 3 progenies and four controls (BRSMG Majestoso, L 1, BRSMG Madrepérola and A 525) in random blocks, with three repetitions, as for the plants architecture, hypocotyl diameter and grains productivity in the harvests of the winter of 2010 and of the drought of 2011. It was observed that the association among F 2 plants HD and characters related to the load in the F 2 : 3 progenies were of magnitude relatively low, compared to the estimates of correlations considering the genitors, indicating great influence of the atmosphere in the determination of the hypocotyl diameter in individual plants of bean plant. There was predominance of addictive effect in the determination of this character, that presented larger precision and accuracy compared to the evaluation of the load by the note of architecture of the plants, evidencing that the hypocotyl diameter can be used as <b>auxiliary</b> <b>measure</b> in the selection of progenies in the improvement of the bean plant seeking improvement of the load of the plants, since the selection is based, in agreement with the repeatability analysis, in the average of at least 40 plants within plots. Besides, families were observed with grains productivity above the largest values presented by the parents in the two harvests, with architecture notes and hypocotyl diameter comparable to the most erect genitors.

50|$|Levees {{are usually}} built by piling earth on a cleared, level surface. Broad at the base, they taper {{to a level}} top, where {{temporary}} embankments or sandbags can be placed. Because flood discharge intensity increases in levees on both river banks, and because silt deposits {{raise the level of}} riverbeds, planning and <b>auxiliary</b> <b>measures</b> are vital. Sections are often set back from the river to form a wider channel, and flood valley basins are divided by multiple levees to prevent a single breach from flooding a large area. A levee made from stones laid in horizontal rows with a bed of thin turf between each of them is known as a spetchel.|$|R
