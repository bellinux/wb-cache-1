5|$|The Age of Empires {{series has}} been a {{commercial}} success, selling over 20 million copies. Critics have credited part {{of the success of}} the series to its historical theme and fair play; the <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> (<b>AI)</b> players fight with fewer advantages than in many of the series' competitors.|$|E
5|$|Halo 3 (Xbox 360) by Bungie and Microsoft Studios broke many {{first day}} records, {{including}} preorders (1.7 million+), and first day sales (US$170 million+), surpassing its predecessor, Halo 2, {{in both of}} these fields. It also featured advanced <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> (<b>AI)</b> technology for enemies, though the player's allies' intelligence was less refined.|$|E
5|$|Modem Wars, {{released}} in 1988 for DOS and the Commodore 64, {{was the first}} RTS with multiplayer games by means of modems. Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, which allow two gamers to compete by modem or local networks, persuaded a wider audience that multiplayer competition was much more challenging than contests against the <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> (<b>AI),</b> and made multiplayer facilities essential for future RTS titles.|$|E

5|$|In Resident Evil 5, {{the primary}} player {{controls}} Redfield, whom Alomar follows throughout {{the game as}} an ally controlled by <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> (<b>AI).</b> In the game's co-operative gameplay mode, a second player will control Alomar. When the game has been completed once, there is an option to make Alomar the primary character. During {{the events of the}} game, Alomar and Redfield stop the Tricell corporation, who were continuing Umbrella's work, from infecting the world with a new BOW. In the end, they kill the series' villain Albert Wesker.|$|E
5|$|Sheva Alomar is {{a fictional}} {{character}} in the Resident Evil horror video game series by Capcom. She was introduced in 2009 as a co-protagonist in Resident Evil 5. In the game, she is a native African operative of an anti-bioterrorism group and the new partner of the series' veteran Chris Redfield. Alomar {{is controlled by the}} game's <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> (<b>AI)</b> when playing with a single player, and is controlled by a second player in the game's cooperative mode.|$|E
5|$|CGW {{said the}} in-game combat became a {{confusing}} mess once allies became involved, {{in part due}} to poor <b>Artificial</b> <b>Intelligence</b> (<b>AI)</b> that caused them to use powers liberally and become low on blood as a result. The AI was considered to be insufficient for the game; pathfinding failures meant allies would become stuck on environmental objects or each other during combat, use up their costliest abilities on enemies regardless of their threat, and were poor at staying alive in battle. Enemies were similarly dismissed for either not noticing the playable character in obvious circumstances or failing to respond to attacks on themselves.|$|E

5|$|Computer science {{concerns}} {{itself with}} the automatic processing of information (or at least with physical systems of symbols to which information is assigned) by means of such things as computers. From the beginning, computer programmers {{have been able to}} develop programs that permit computers to carry out tasks for which organic beings need a mind. A simple example is multiplication. It is not clear whether computers could be said to have a mind. Could they, someday, come to have what we call a mind? This question has been propelled into the forefront of much philosophical debate because of investigations in the field of <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> (<b>AI).</b>|$|E
5|$|The team {{aimed to}} {{replicate}} the playing experience and difficulty of the extant Syndicate. Starbreeze considered {{the difficulty of the}} first game {{to be part of the}} franchise's legacy and was worth preserving; they hoped the new game would be challenging enough for players without being frustrating. They introduced a rarely scripted <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> (<b>AI)</b> into the game. The AI reacts to players' actions and was programmed to relocate itself after being attacked. The new game has less gore than the older one; players still can kill innocent civilians but the team minimized these scenarios, which they thought were part of the game's environment rather than gameplay elements.|$|E
5|$|After the Spartans' first {{successful}} operation, John-117 is {{briefed on the}} threat posed by the Covenant, a theocratic alliance of alien races, and witnesses the utter devastation wrought by a single ship. In 2552, the Chief and Spartans return to Reach, where the UNSC High Command has developed a last-ditch plan to capture a Covenant High Prophet, who they hope could be used in order to barter a truce. The Master Chief's armor is upgraded, and he first encounters the <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> (<b>AI)</b> Cortana during a training mission. The Covenant arrive and invade, despite the best efforts of the Spartans and other UNSC forces. Aboard the spaceship Pillar of Autumn, Cortana plots a random course of escape. Seemingly the last Spartan alive, the Master Chief enters cryonic sleep along with the Pillar of Autumns crew.|$|E
50|$|Marathon 2 {{takes place}} {{seventeen}} {{years after the}} events of the first game. Durandal, one of the three <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligences</b> (<b>AIs)</b> from the colony ship UESC Marathon, sends the player and an army of ex-colonists to search the ruins of Lh'owon, the S'pht home-world. He does not mention what exactly he is looking for, although he does let it slip that the Pfhor are planning to attack Earth, and that being on Lh'owon may stall their advance.|$|R
50|$|The plot is {{primarily}} {{revealed to the}} player by computer terminals accessed {{throughout the course of}} the game. These terminals relay information such as crew logs, maintenance documents, historical accounts, and stories, but their primary function is to allow the player to interface with three <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligences</b> (<b>AIs),</b> who provide the player with information about his current mission at any given point in the game and teleport him out of a level when his mission is complete.|$|R

5|$|Halo is {{a science}} fiction video game {{franchise}} created by Bungie and owned and published by Microsoft Studios. Central to the Halo series are the three first-person shooter video games , Halo 2 and Halo 3; novelizations, soundtracks, and other media are also available. The story of the series is about the Master Chief, a cybernetically enhanced human super-soldier and his <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> (<b>AI)</b> companion, Cortana, as the humans of a futuristic universe battle the Covenant, a theocratic alliance of alien races. The Halo series has inspired machinima productions, such as Red vs. Blue, and other fan fiction; however, this list only covers media produced or endorsed by series creator Bungie, or the intellectual property overseer 343 Industries.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the main}} campaign, players can {{battle against the}} game's <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> (<b>AI)</b> in the Link Arena: after {{building}} a team and placing a wager, the player fights a battle against their own units controlled by the game AI. Fire Emblem also features a Link Arena multiplayer option in which up to four players can link up and do battle with teams of characters from the single-player save file. Players choose up to five characters and equip them like in the main story. During battle, each player takes turns to attack with one character. Weapons selected automatically for each battle Victory is determined either by surviving {{a period of time}} or aggregating the highest number of points.|$|E
5|$|StarCraft {{focuses around}} three {{distinct}} interstellar species: the psionic Protoss, the adaptable Terrans, and the insectoid Zerg. The game revolves around players collecting resources {{to construct a}} base, upgrade their militaries, and ultimately conquer opponents. Brood Wars gameplay remains fundamentally unchanged from that of StarCraft, although it made small alterations to unit costs and some abilities, and added some new units. These changes make rushing tactics—a factor that gained some criticism in the original StarCraft—less practical. The single-player campaign has an increased difficulty; missions are no longer entirely linear, and a greater focus on strategy is needed to complete missions. In addition, the game's <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> (<b>AI)</b> has been augmented so that AI-controlled players are more intelligent and tend to use tactics more effectively.|$|E
30|$|Thus, in the {{relatively}} near future {{we may have a}} sustainable energy system that increases energy supply and energy efficiency, decreases the price of energy, and allows citizens and organisations to become energy producers. These changes, then, enable wide use of new technologies – such as <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligences</b> (<b>AIs),</b> smart cities, internet of things (IoT), robotisation, and ubiquitous virtual realities – and empower new actors, big and small. To meet sustainable criteria, also material production should be designed as sustainable – for instance as circular economy.|$|R

5|$|The World was {{developed}} by a German programmer named Harald Hoerwick; its backstory {{is based on the}} Epitaph of Twilight, an epic poem by Emma Wielant. Her death inspired Hoerwick to create the game. Elements of the poem are coded into the game's programming. The hidden purpose of Hoerwick's game is to develop the ultimate <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> (<b>AI),</b> which is capable of making decisions for itself. To this end, Hoerwick inserted functions into the system which monitor and extract behavioral data from millions of the game's players to aid in the AI's learning process. After Hoerwick's death, these pieces of code became black boxes to the current developers, who cannot fathom their purpose, yet are critical to the proper functioning of the game.|$|E
5|$|The game {{takes place}} in a borderless and {{randomly}} generated universe, filled with asteroids, planets, stars and solar systems. Life forms are also present in the game. They appear on planets sufficiently big to store life, and are represented by a variety of ships of different size and attack power. Spaceships are coloured green if they belong to the player's planet, or to a planet that belongs to the player's solar system; red if they belong to an enemy planet or solar system; and white if they don't belong to any planet or system. All the spaceships in the map are controlled by the game's <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> (<b>AI),</b> and they will constantly engage in combat against enemy ships, asteroids or planets to destroy them.|$|E
5|$|The {{commander}} of the UNSC warship Spirit of Fire is Captain James Cutter (Gregg Berger), a strong leader who has earned the admiration of his subordinates. Cutter's lack of political ambition prevents him from climbing the ranks further. Serving under Cutter is Sergeant John Forge (Nolan North), a gruff Marine whose devotion to men has caused him to be jailed twice for disobeying orders and engaging in disorderly conduct. Joining the Spirit of Fires military expedition is Professor Ellen Anders (Kim Mai Guest), a scientist interested in ancient ruins of the mysterious Forerunners. The Spirit of Fire is operated with help from Serina (Courtenay Taylor), a super-intelligent <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> (<b>AI)</b> with a sardonic sense of humor; it has been noted that she demonstrates a level of contempt for the humans she assists. Leading the Covenant search for Forerunner technology is a holy warrior known as the Arbiter (David Sobolov), who the Covenant leaders, the Prophet Hierarchs, have tasked with the oversight of humanity's destruction.|$|E

5|$|Resident Evil 6 allows {{players to}} select between four {{scenarios}} with interwoven storylines. Each scenario follows {{one of four}} main protagonists: Leon S. Kennedy, Chris Redfield, Jake Muller and Ada Wong. The player-characters from each scenario will have their own partners whom are controlled by either <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> (<b>AI)</b> or another player via local or online multiplayer. In addition, each scenario features a different play-style; for example, some player-characters are more vulnerable to attacks whereas others are more resilient. Each central character has unique abilities, which vary from increased reload times and carrying more ammunition. Resident Evil 6 presents new innovations and gameplay mechanics such as rolling in any direction and running whilst shooting and sliding. The game also features a four-player co-operative mode. When playing in single player mode, the player can allow another player to join in online at any time. While performing certain actions, quick time events may occur, in which the player must follow onscreen prompts by pressing buttons or manipulating joysticks within {{a limited amount of}} time.|$|E
5|$|The <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> (<b>AI)</b> in NOLF was {{significantly}} advanced {{at the time}} of the game's release. Enemy AI can react to eleven different stimuli, including hearing the player's footsteps or weapon firing, seeing the player's footprints in the snow, or hearing an ally scream in pain. The AI can try and investigate the source of these stimuli, by following the footprints for example, and can sound alarms or call for backup. During combat, the AI finds cover positions, and, to some extent, can also use its environment for protection, such as flipping over a table and hiding behind it. After advancing AI technology in their subsequent games, Monolith likened the way NOLFs AIs pop randomly in and out of cover to a shooting gallery. Groups of AI guards make use of a group logic when investigating and combating the player. For example, one guard might start firing at the player, while another runs and calls for backup. The game's AI includes friendly and enemy humans, as well as dogs, sharks, and helicopters.|$|E
5|$|Troika {{wanted to}} make a 3D game, but was {{uncertain}} whether to build a new game engine or license an existing one and whether to use first- or third-person. At that time, the Source game engine was being built by Valve Corporation. Valve employee Scott Lynch approached Troika about using the engine, {{and it was the first}} external team to use it. Troika chose Source for its facial animation and lip-synching system, since it wanted players to speak to the characters face-to-face. Since the engine was in development with Bloodlines and Valve's own Half-Life 2, Troika was working with unfamiliar code and tools, forcing it to write its own code to compensate for the unfinished engine, and with only a single source for technical support. Troika developed a lighting system to create distinctive, moody illumination for the nighttime setting, a particle system for the special effects accompanying the vampire Disciplines, and a cloth system for clothing flow. Source lacked its later <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligence</b> (<b>AI)</b> coding, and Troika's code worked poorly with the Source engine.|$|E

The project has surpassed its initial goal to have the game run the mods and third-party units from Total Annihilation, and {{has evolved into a}} more general RTS engine. Most of the games running on the engine (as of December 2010) are focused on multiplayer gameplay. There are also currently a number of single player missions, built on frameworks utilizing the engine's Lua scripting abilities. There are also a large number of skirmish <b>artificial</b> <b>intelligences</b> (<b>AIs),</b> allowing for offline play or extra players in an online game.|$|R
