It'll obviously include all kinds of people. But <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> generations as social units, we consider it to be at least as powerful and, in our view, far more powerful than other social groupings such as economic class, race, sex, religion and political parties." ...|$|E
2500|$|In April 1983 the Federal Government tasked a Mirage jet {{and later}} an RF-111, from the Royal Australian Air Force, {{to perform a}} {{reconnaissance}} mission over the dam {{as part of its}} case that the Tasmanian Government was not complying with Federal legislation to stop work. A photograph of the Franklin River taken on one of these missions (and showing the construction road) was signed after the case by all the judges involved and a copy is displayed in the Australian National University College of Law staff library. On 1 July 2008, twenty five years after the High Court decision that saved the Franklin River an anniversary dinner was held at Hobart's Grand Chancellor Hotel where former Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke stated that the campaign to protect the Franklin River had important lessons for the struggle against global warming: [...] "And <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the arguments and the positions of political parties today you see a complete replication of what we experienced back there in 1983. The conservatives: they never change, they never learn. What was their argument back then? You can't do this, it will cost jobs. It will cost economic growth. You can't do it, you mustn't do it." ...|$|E

60|$|Lucy had no neck at all worth {{speaking}} of,--no neck, I mean, {{that ever}} produced eloquence; she was brown, too, and had addicted herself in nowise, as she undoubtedly should have done, to larder utility. In {{regard to the}} neck and colour, poor girl, she could not help herself; but in that other respect she must be held as having wasted her opportunities. But then what eyes she had! Mrs. Pole was right there. They flashed upon you, not always softly; indeed not often softly {{if you were a}} stranger to her; but whether softly or savagely, with a brilliancy that dazzled <b>you</b> <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> them. And who shall say of what colour they were? Green, probably, for most eyes are green--green or grey, if green be thought uncomely for an eye-colour. But it was not their colour, but their fire, which struck one with such surprise.|$|R

When Margaret grows up she will have a daughter, who is to be Peter's mother in turn; and thus it will go on, so long as children are gay and innocent and heartless.|$|E

60|$|Then, as Charlotte watched, the Pretty Lady {{with the}} Blue Eyes came along the footpath. Charlotte {{had never seen}} her before and hadn't the {{slightest}} idea in the world who she was, but that was what she called her as soon as she saw her. The lady was so pretty, with lovely blue eyes that were very sad, although somehow <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> them <b>you</b> felt that they ought to be laughing, merry eyes instead. At least Charlotte thought so and wished at once that she knew how to make them laugh. Besides, the Lady had lovely golden hair and the most beautiful pink cheeks, and Charlotte, who had mouse-coloured hair and any number of freckles, had an unbounded admiration for golden locks and roseleaf complexions. The Lady was dressed in black, which Charlotte didn't like, principally because the matron of the asylum wore black and Charlotte didn't--exactly--like the matron.|$|R

60|$|Just {{above the}} northwestern {{shore of the}} old island of Hispaniola--the Santo Domingo of our day--and {{separated}} from it only by a narrow channel of some five or six miles in width, lies a queer little hunch of an island, known, because of a distant resemblance to that animal, as the Tortuga de Mar, or sea turtle. It is not more than twenty miles in length by perhaps seven or eight in breadth; {{it is only a}} little spot of land, and <b>as</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> it upon the map a pin's head would almost cover it; yet from that spot, as from a center of inflammation, a burning fire of human wickedness and ruthlessness and lust overran the world, and spread terror and death throughout the Spanish West Indies, from St. Augustine to the island of Trinidad, and from Panama to the coasts of Peru.|$|E
6000|$|<b>As</b> <b>you</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the drawings, secrets {{come out}} of them,--private jokes, as it were, {{imparted}} to you by the author for your special delectation. How remarkably, for instance, has Mr. Leech observed the hair-dressers of the present age! Look at [...] "Mr. Tongs," [...] whom that hideous old bald woman, who ties on her bonnet at the glass, informs that [...] "she has used the whole bottle of Balm of California, but her hair comes off yet." [...] You can see the bear's-grease not only on Tongs's head but on his hands, which he is clapping clammily together. Remark him who is telling his client [...] "there is cholera in the hair;" [...] and that lucky rogue whom the young lady bids to cut off [...] "a long thick piece"--for somebody, doubtless. All these men are different, and delightfully natural and absurd. Why should hair-dressing be an absurd profession? ...|$|E

Listen, mother, and kiss me! When I go to the far country, I will make a garden there like my garden here, and plant the same flowers that we have planted here, and in the evening I will go out and give them water at the hour {{when you go out}} to give my flowers water at home; and so, though we see each other no more, it will yet be as if we laboured together in the garden as we labour now!' ...|$|E
