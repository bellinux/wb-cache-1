500|$|David Rose {{writes that}} a former detective {{inspector}} called the Blakelock investigation a [...] "pre-scientific inquiry, it was <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> to get Winston Silcott convicted, not discovering who killed Keith Blakelock." [...] By {{the time of}} the murder, local police saw Silcott as the [...] "biggest mafioso in Tottenham... running the mugging gangs, paying them with drugs," [...] according to another former senior officer in Tottenham.|$|E
500|$|In {{the same}} book, Melanie C further elaborated: [...] "'Mama's <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> you're such a cow to your mum when you're {{going through that}} rebellious teenage stage. Then {{when you get a}} bit older, you realise that {{whatever}} she was doing, she was only doing it for your own good. And you think: 'God, I was really horrible.'" [...] "Mama" [...] was released in the UK and Ireland as a double A-side along with [...] "Who Do You Think You Are" [...] in March 1997, timed not only for the Comic Relief telethon, but also for Mothering Sunday.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} talks {{about someone who}} has got over a broken relationship, declaring the partner as [...] "so yesterday". According to Duff, the song's lyrics are very {{empowering}} towards breaking up with someone and getting over it. In a 2006 interview with Instinct, Duff said that people often told her that [...] "So Yesterday" [...] was [...] "the ultimate post-breakup anthem". She said her mother instilled the notion of inner strength in her, and that she wanted the music she makes to be positive. [...] "I don't think there's very much of that out there anymore.", she said. She {{stressed the importance of}} strong songs that are not <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> [...] "a boy broke your heart and you're never going to get on your feet again", saying it was good for girls to hear.|$|E

500|$|Freelance writer Dan Vebber, who {{is known}} for his work on the {{animated}} series Futurama, wrote [...] "The Book Job" [...] with contributions from the staff writers on The Simpsons. Matt Selman, an executive producer and writer on The Simpsons, was the one who conceived of the idea behind the episode. He was inspired by an article in The New Yorker about the book packaging company Alloy Entertainment—the publisher of series such as Gossip Girl and Vampire Diaries—and the company's use of ghostwriters. According to Selman, the article [...] "was <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> these executives take market research and come up with the ideas for these books and farms them out and slaps the name of fake writers on them and fabricates backgrounds for these authors who don’t exist. We took that trend and kind of blew it up and shoved it in the face of Lisa".|$|E
500|$|Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music wrote a {{positive}} {{review of the}} song and rated it {{four out of five}} stars. He wrote, [...] "So, essentially doing a song like this is rocky ground, {{but the good news is}} that Demi generally comes across as the kind of bright, scrappy, girl-next-door type, so it doesn't sound quite so preposterous when she insists that she's still quite normal, really." [...] McAlpine concluded his review, writing, [...] "You can almost hear the paparazzi cameras going off as she's singing. [...] Of course, the only thing she has to worry about now is that having made this very public declaration, if she slips up for a second, we'll all be watching..." [...] Judy Coleman of The Boston Globe said that Lovato shows [...] "her Gen-Y stripes", and [...] "forcibly rhymes 'everything's the same' with 'the La-La land machine' – pronounced, of course,' ma-SHAYN'." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic noted it as one of the best tracks on Don't Forget. Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic included [...] "La La Land" [...] at number eight on his [...] "Top 10 from the Disney girls" [...] list, and wrote, [...] "Are Disney girls just naturally plagued by insecurity or is it all a plot to seem more real? Like Miley's [...] "Party in U.S.A.," [...] this song is <b>all</b> <b>about</b> <b>how</b> out of place Lovato feels in La La Land." ...|$|E
