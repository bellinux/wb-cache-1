5|$|But 1912 {{also brought}} {{some very good}} news for <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>local</b> river steamers, and the area in general. It was {{announced}} that another railway {{was going to be}} built, the Pacific Great Eastern which would run from Vancouver to Fort George and eventually beyond to the Peace River Country. Foley, Welch and Stewart would be the contractors for this railway as well and they planned to build the grade along the upper Fraser River from Fort George to Soda Creek so that sternwheelers could be used to aid in its construction.|$|E
5|$|In November 1874, several {{shipowners}} were contracted for {{two years}} from the South Australian government to provide ten round trips between the colonial capital of Adelaide and its furthest outpost, Port Darwin.

5|$|During {{his second}} term, Ross {{was forced to}} {{intervene}} in the Jaybird-Woodpecker War in Fort Bend County. Sheriff Jim Garvey feared there would be armed battles between the white supremacist Democrats (the Jaybirds) and the black men who had retained political power (who, with their white supporters, were known as Woodpeckers). At Garvey's request, Ross sent two militia companies, which managed to impose a four-month peace. In August 1889, Ross sent four Texas Rangers, including Sergeant Ira Aten, to quell the unrest. Violence erupted, leaving four people dead and injuring six, including a Ranger. Aten wired Ross for help. The following morning, the Houston Light Guard arrived and instituted martial law; that evening, Ross arrived with an Assistant Attorney General and another militia company. Ross fired <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>local</b> civil officials and called together representatives from both factions. On his suggestion, the two groups agreed to choose a mutually acceptable sheriff to replace Garvey, who had been killed in the firefight. When they could not agree on a candidate, Ross suggested Aten; both groups finally agreed, thus halting the conflict.|$|E
5|$|In 1855, {{the newly}} {{appointed}} Ottoman pasha ("governor") of the sanjak ("district") of Jerusalem, Kamil Pasha, attempted to subdue the rebellion in the Hebron region. Kamil Pasha marched towards Hebron with his army in July 1855, and after crushing the opposition, {{he ordered the}} local shaykhs to summon to his camp. Several of the shaykhs, including {{the leader of the}} 'Amr clan and Muslih al-'Azza, did not obey the summons. Kamil Pasha then requested that the British consul in Jerusalem, James Finn, serve as an envoy and arrange a meeting with Muslih. Finn sent his vice-consul to assure Muslih of his safety in Hebron and convinced him to meet with Kamil Pasha. Muslih was well received in Hebron and returned to Bayt Jibrin escorted by twenty of the governor's men. Soon after, the Kamil Pasha paid a visit to Bayt Jibrin to settle affairs and collect the town's overdue taxes. Kamil Pasha took an oath of loyalty from <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>local</b> shaykhs in the Hebron region, including those under the rule of Muslih al-'Azza.|$|E
5|$|Over £840 {{million in}} cash from more than 100 UK local {{authorities}} was invested in Icelandic banks. Representatives from each council met {{to try to persuade}} the Treasury to secure the money {{in the same way that}} customers' money in Icesave was fully guaranteed. Of <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>local</b> authorities, Kent County Council has the most money invested in Icelandic banks, currently £50 million. Transport for London, the organisation that operates and coordinates transport services within London, also has a large investment at £40 million. Local authorities were working under government advice to invest their money across many national and international banks as a way of spreading risk. Other UK organisations said to have invested heavily include police services and fire authorities, and even the Audit Commission. It is hoped that about one-third of the deposited money will be available fairly rapidly, corresponding to the liquid assets of the UK subsidiaries: liquidation of other assets, such as loans and offices, will take longer.|$|E
