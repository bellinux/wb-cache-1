500|$|In {{response}} to both this and Coke's {{establishment of a}} sub-committee to establish {{freedom of speech and}} discuss the rights of the Commons, James announced that [...] "you usurp upon our prerogative royal and meddle with things far <b>above</b> <b>your</b> reach". He first adjourned Parliament and then forbade the Commons from discussing [...] "matters of state at home or abroad". Ignoring this ban, Parliament issued a [...] "Remonstrance to the King" [...] on 11 December 1621, authored by Coke, in which they restated their liberties and right to discuss matters of state, claiming that such rights were the [...] "ancient and undoubted birthright and inheritance of the subjects of England". After a debate, it was sent to James, who rejected it; the Commons instead resolved to enter it into the Journal of the Commons, which required no royal authorisation. In the presence of Parliament, the king reacted by tearing the offending page from the Journal, declaring that it should be [...] "razed out of all memories and utterly annihilated", then dissolved Parliament. Coke was then imprisoned in the Tower of London on 27 December, but released nine months later.|$|E

[...] It was serviced to contemporary hit radio on May 3, 2016. On May 31, 2016, the official cover art for the single was released.

[...] Forrest also stated, [...] "The band I joined was sensational, but few special arrangements were written for me. I sang choruses, and made myself fit to the music.

In August 1941, Forrest quit the orchestra [...] "to avoid having a nervous breakdown". [...] After leaving Goodman, Forrest briefly recorded with Nat King Cole and Lionel Hampton.|$|E

2500|$|The Gemara {{read the}} {{reference}} in [...] to [...] "one portion <b>above</b> <b>your</b> brothers" [...] {{to mean that}} like a firstborn son, Joseph received a double portion. Rav Papa asked Abaye whether perhaps Jacob merely gave Joseph an extra palm tree. Abaye answered that [...] demonstrated that Jacob intended that Joseph would get two full portions [...] "even as Reuben and Simeon." [...] Rabbi Helbo asked Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani why Jacob took the firstborn's birthright from Reuben {{and gave it to}} Joseph. The Gemara answered by citing [...] to show that Reuben lost the birthright when he defiled Jacob's bed. The Gemara asked why Joseph benefited from Reuben's disqualification. Rabbi Samuel bar Nahmani responded with a parable of an orphan who was brought up by an adoptive father, and when he became rich he chose to give to his adoptive father from his wealth. Similarly, because Joseph cared for Jacob, Jacob chose to give to Joseph. Rabbi Helbo challenged that reason, arguing instead that Rabbi Jonathan said that Rachel should have borne the firstborn, as indicated by the naming of Joseph in [...] and God restored the right of the firstborn to Rachel because of her modesty. And a Baraita read the reference in [...] to [...] "my sword and [...] [...] [...] my bow" [...] to mean Jacob's spiritual weapons, interpreting [...] "my sword" [...] to mean prayer and [...] "my bow" [...] to mean supplication.|$|E
