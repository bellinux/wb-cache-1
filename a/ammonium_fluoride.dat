500|$|The {{chemical}} properties of hafnium and zirconium are nearly identical, {{which makes the}} two difficult to separate. The methods first used — fractional crystallization of <b>ammonium</b> <b>fluoride</b> salts or the fractionated distillation of the chloride — have not proven suitable for an industrial-scale production. After zirconium was chosen as material for nuclear reactor programs in the 1940s, a separation method had to be developed. Liquid-liquid extraction processes {{with a wide variety}} of solvents were developed and are still used for the production of hafnium. About half of all hafnium metal manufactured is produced as a by-product of zirconium refinement. The end product of the separation is hafnium(IV) chloride. The purified hafnium(IV) chloride is converted to the metal by reduction [...] with magnesium or sodium, as in the Kroll process.|$|E
500|$|Five {{nitrogen}} fluorides are known. Nitrogen trifluoride (NF3, first {{prepared in}} 1928) is a colourless and odourless gas that is thermodynamically stable, and most readily {{produced by the}} electrolysis of molten <b>ammonium</b> <b>fluoride</b> dissolved in anhydrous hydrogen fluoride. Like carbon tetrafluoride, {{it is not at}} all reactive and is stable in water or dilute aqueous acids or alkalis. Only when heated does it act as a fluorinating agent, and it reacts with copper, arsenic, antimony, and bismuth on contact at high temperatures to give tetrafluorohydrazine (N2F4). The cations [...] and [...] are also known (the latter from reacting tetrafluorohydrazine with strong fluoride-acceptors such as arsenic pentafluoride), as is ONF3, which has aroused interest due to the short N–O distance implying partial double bonding and the highly polar and long N–F bond. Tetrafluorohydrazine, unlike hydrazine itself, can dissociate at room temperature and above to give the radical NF2•. Fluorine azide (FN3) is very explosive and thermally unstable. Dinitrogen difluoride (N2F2) exists as thermally interconvertible cis and trans isomers, and was first found as a product of the thermal decomposition of FN3.|$|E

40|$|South Africa is {{the second}} largest {{producer}} of zircon (ZrSiO 4) in the world, Australia being the largest. Zircon is notorious for its chemical inertness. Extreme processing conditions such as alkaline fusion (NaOH at 600 °C or Na 2 CO 3 at 1200 °C) are used to extract the zirconium values from the mineral. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the use of microwave digestion as an alternative process, and to determine the parameters for this technique for the digestion of zircon with <b>ammonium</b> acid <b>fluoride</b> (AAF) under various conditions. <b>Ammonium</b> acid <b>fluoride</b> is more convenient and safer to use than conventional fluorination methods such as HF and F 2. In this study zircon was treated with <b>ammonium</b> acid <b>fluoride</b> (NH 4 F∙ 1. 5 HF) by means of microwave assisted digestion. Reaction times ranged from 10 to 330 minutes at temperatures between 100 °C and 240 °C. Successive microwave digestion steps, interrupted by an aqueous wash procedure, resulted in a > 99 % conversion of zircon to the water soluble intermediates (NH 4.) 3 ZrF 7 and (NH 4) 2 SiF 6. XRD and Raman spectroscopy confirm that zircon was the major phase present in the insoluble fraction of the product after washing. Arrhenius rate laws are derived for both reaction control (progressively shrinking particle) and diffusion control by the product layer. Both models show reasonably good agreement with the experimental data, but diffusion control was accepted as the most probable. The derived diffusion coefficient corresponds to a solid-liquid case.

The high separation of fluoride (synthetic sample) ≈ 99 % was obtained by resulting membranes pretreated with different amount and contact time of low cost adsorbent (fly ash) at pH 4.

40|$|More than 30 {{percent of}} the global demand for zircon (ZrSiO 4) is {{supplied}} by South Africa. A significant amount of the zircon is exported, and beneficiated products are then imported for industrial applications locally. Beneficiating the zircon locally could {{have a positive impact}} on the local market, since zircon is only one of many such cases. <b>Ammonium</b> acid <b>fluoride</b> serves as an alternative anhydrous fluorinating agent for zircon in the synthesis of several metal fluorides 1, 2. It provides an effective dry fluorinating method and is easier to handle than hydrogen fluoride or fluorine gas. Zircon exposed to extreme plasma temperatures dissociates and becomes more reactive. The reaction of the plasma-dissociated zircon (ZrO 2 ·SiO 2) with the <b>ammonium</b> acid <b>fluoride</b> (NH 4 F·xHF, where x = 1 to 5) forms two main intermediate compounds (NH 4) 3 ZrF 7 (s) and (NH 4) 2 SiF 6 (s), the latter decomposing to form volatile products at relatively low temperatures, providing easy separation of the silicon and zirconium compounds. The ammonium zirconate compound decomposes to form zirconium tetrafluoride (ZrF 4), which can be further manufactured into zirconium metal, to name but one product. Data on the kinetics of the reaction of <b>ammonium</b> acid <b>fluoride</b> with zircon and plasma-dissociated zircon, combined with the thermodynamic parameters of the reaction, is essential for the development of an industrial process for the production of a precursor for the manufacturing of zirconium metal, namely anhydrous ZrF 4.
