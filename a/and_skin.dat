40|$|The present {{work was}} carried out to isolate and {{identify}} aerobic bacteria associated with raw cattle hides <b>and</b> sheep <b>skins</b> <b>and</b> to examine their effect on tissue of hides <b>and</b> <b>skins,</b> in Gezira region. A total of 160 samples were collected. They were collected from slaughterhouse, warehouse and tannery. Samples collected were hides <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> treated with salt, washed and air dried. Samples taken 2 hours after slaughter and samples delivered without treatment. The bacterial damage was clear in raw hides <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> delivered without treatment. They showed signs of putrefaction, offensive odour and hair slipping. A number of bacteria were isolated. A number of bacteria were isolated also from traditional salted hides <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> <b>and</b> this was probably due to delay in curing and absence of bacteriocides. A number of bacteria were isolated from samples taken from washed and air dried hides <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> <b>and</b> samples 2 hours taken after slaughter, this probably due to poor hygiene, large number of labors and bad condition of collection room of raw hides <b>and</b> <b>skins.</b> A total of 414 organisms were isolated and consist of 379 Grampositive bacteria and 35 were Gram- negative bacteria. One hundred and thirty four bacterial strains were isolated from fresh and washed cattle hides <b>and</b> sheep <b>skins</b> in slaughterhouse these include: Staphylococcus spp, Micrococcus spp, Corynebacterium spp, Aerococcus homorri, Enterococcus casselifarus, Aerococcus viridans, Enterococcus faecalis, Gamella haemolysan, Stomococcus spp, Pseudomonas spp and Eschericha coli. Also one hundred and sixty three strains were isolated from salted and dried cattle hides <b>and</b> sheep <b>skins</b> in warehouse these include: Staphylococcus spp, Micrococcus spp, Corynebacterium spp, Enterococcus spp, Streptococcus faecalis, Stomatococcus mucilaginosus, Bacillus spp, Morexell bovis, Proteus vulgaris bigroup II, Pseudomonas spp and Eschericha coli. One hundred and seventeen bacterial strains were isolated from raw hides <b>and</b> <b>skins</b> delivered without treatment to tannery these include: Staphylococcus spp, Micrococcus spp, Corynebacterium spp, Lactobacillus jensenii, Streptococcus spp, Enterococcus spp, Stomatococcus mucilaginous, Bacillus spp, Aerococcus viridans, Proteus vulgaris biogroupII, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas spp. Staphylococcus spp, Micrococcus spp, Corynebacterium spp, Bacillus spp, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas spp were the predominant microorganisms isolated in this study. Staphylococcus sacchrolyticus, Staphylococcus capitis, Staphylococcus hyicus, Micrococcus lylate, Corynebacterium bovis, Corynebacterium xerosis, Lactobacillus jensenii, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus intermedius, Bacillus amylogliguesta, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Staphylococcus auricularis, Staphylococcus hominis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus xylosus, Micrococcus varinas, Micrococcus lentus, Corynebacterium bovis, Proteus vulgaris bigroup II and Morexella bovis were isolated from putrefied hides <b>and</b> <b>skins.</b> In this study the histological examination of putrefied area showed the most affected structures of skin layer were epidermis and dermis. The epidermis became thin with no cellular structure and appearing ribbon like and detached from dermis. The dermis became loose structures. This indicated the most affected tissue is epidermis and dermis which are valuable tissue in leather industry...|$|R

TSC is caused by mutations on either of two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, which encode for the proteins hamartin and tuberin respectively.

Originally regarded as a rare pathological curiosity, it is now an important focus of research into tumour formation and suppression.|$|E
