500|$|There {{was also}} a real Dayton out there, a charming Ohio city, famous as {{the birthplace of the}} Wright brothers. Its {{citizens}} energized us from the outset. Unlike the population of, say, New York City, Geneva or Washington, which would scarcely notice another conference, Daytonians were proud to be part of history. Large signs at the commercial airport hailed Dayton as the [...] "temporary center of international peace". The local newspapers and television stations covered the story from every angle, drawing the people deeper into the proceedings. When we ventured into a restaurant or a shopping center downtown, people crowded <b>around,</b> <b>saying</b> that they were praying for us. Warren Christopher was given at least one standing ovation in a restaurant. Families on the air base placed [...] "candles of peace" [...] in their front windows, and people gathered in peace vigils outside the base. One day they formed a [...] "peace chain", although it was not large enough to surround the sprawling eight-thousand-acre base. Ohio's famous ethnic diversity was on display.|$|E

[...] "Farewell" [...] contains lyrics that revolve <b>around</b> <b>saying</b> goodbye to a lover who {{is not able to}} be physically present in the relationship for long periods of time. Instrumentation consists of a piano. The song was composed in the key of G major and set in common time signature, and has a moderately slow tempo of 88 beats per minute. Rihanna's vocals span from the low note of G3 to the high note of D5. [...] Jason Lipshutz of Billboard magazine noted that the song's structure was similar to Beyoncé Knowles song [...] "Halo", while Priya Elan for NME wrote that the song was reminiscent of Rihanna's song [...] "Fire Bomb", from her fourth studio album, Rated R (2009). Lipshutz also noted that Rihanna delivered the bridge with [...] "powerhouse" [...] vocals. A reviewer for Flavour Magazine wrote that Rihanna displayed [...] "great vocals" [...] in the lyric [...] "Somebody's gonna miss you... Farewell."

2500|$|An {{attempt was}} made to fix the error in the {{extended}} title sequence used at the beginning of season two that included Neil Flynn, but the extended sequence (including corrected X-ray) was soon scrapped due to fan and network request. Finally, in [...] "My Urologist", Dr. Kim Briggs steps into the credits and switches the X-ray <b>around,</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "That's backwards; it's been bugging me for years". At the beginning of season eight, when the series switched to ABC, the chest X-ray was once again backwards.|$|E
2500|$|John Locke {{incorporated}} {{natural law}} into {{many of his}} theories and philosophy, especially in Two Treatises of Government. There is considerable debate about whether his conception of natural law was more akin to that of Aquinas (filtered through Richard Hooker) or Hobbes' radical reinterpretation, though the effect of Locke's understanding is usually phrased {{in terms of a}} revision of Hobbes upon Hobbesean contractualist grounds. Locke turned Hobbes' prescription <b>around,</b> <b>saying</b> that if the ruler went against natural law and failed to protect [...] "life, liberty, and property," [...] people could justifiably overthrow the existing state and create a new one.|$|E
2500|$|Rabbi Alexander Schindler, former {{chair of}} the Conference of Presidents, told an Israeli {{magazine}} in 1976, “The Presidents’ Conference and its members have been instruments of official governmental Israeli policy. It was seen as our task to receive directions from government circles and to do our best no matter what to affect the Jewish community.” Hymen Bookbinder, a high-ranking official of the American Jewish Committee, said “Unless something is terribly pressing, really critical or fundamental, you parrot Israel’s line in order to retain American support.

2500|$|Born into a Democratic-voting family, Sanders {{was first}} {{introduced}} to political activism when his brother Larry joined the Young Democrats of America and campaigned for Adlai Stevenson II in 1956. Although elected mayor of Burlington as an independent, Sanders endorsed Democratic presidential candidates Walter Mondale in 1984 and Jesse Jackson in 1988. His endorsement of Mondale was lukewarm (telling reporters that [...] "if you go <b>around</b> <b>saying</b> that Mondale {{would be a great}} president, you would be a liar and a hypocrite"), but he supported Jackson enthusiastically. The Washington Post reported that the Jackson campaign helped inspire Sanders to work more closely with the Democratic Party.|$|E
2500|$|Atwater: You {{start out}} in 1954 by saying, [...] "Nigger, nigger, nigger". By 1968 you can't say [...] "nigger"—that hurts you. Backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights {{and all that}} stuff. You're getting so {{abstract}} now [...] you're talking about cutting taxes, {{and all these things}} you're talking about are totally economic things and a byproduct of them is [...] blacks get hurt worse than whites. And subconsciously maybe that is part of it. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that if it is getting that abstract, and that coded, that we are doing away with the racial problem one way or the other. You follow me—because obviously sitting <b>around</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "We want to cut this", is much more abstract than even the busing thing, and {{a hell of a lot}} more abstract than [...] "Nigger, nigger".|$|E

Read the matrimonial columns in the papers. Yes, they don't indulge in crude forms of casteism – not allowing someone to drink out of the same glass – but will they allow a Dalit to come and sit at their table and eat with them? I doubt it very much. Of course, marriage is out of the question.

We {{had a bit of}} luck so {{we are not going to}} start going <b>around</b> <b>saying</b> that we are going to win the Championship just because we have won one match." [...] John Derrick, Glamorgan's coach, said, [...] "Although we batted much better second time around, we made it difficult for ourselves by not scoring enough first innings runs. Warwickshire showed what playing pressure cricket is all about. They bowled with a lot of discipline. They piled up a big score to make sure that we did not get back into the game." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kennedy, however, made {{efforts to}} keep Johnson busy, informed, and at the White House often, telling aides, [...] "I can't afford to have my vice president, who knows every {{reporter}} in Washington, going <b>around</b> <b>saying</b> we're all screwed up, so we're going to keep him happy." [...] Kennedy appointed him to jobs such {{as head of the}} President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunities, through which he worked with African Americans and other minorities. Kennedy may have intended this to remain a more nominal position, but Taylor Branch in Pillar of Fire contends that Johnson pushed the Kennedy administration's actions further and faster for civil rights than Kennedy originally intended to go. Branch notes the irony of Johnson being the advocate for civil rights, when the Kennedy family had hoped that he would appeal to conservative southern voters. In particular, he notes Johnson's Memorial Day 1963 speech at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania as being a catalyst that led to more action.|$|E

2500|$|Ever {{since that}} time, people run <b>around</b> <b>saying</b> {{they are looking}} for their other half because they are really trying to recover their primal nature. The women who were {{separated}} from women run after their own kind, thus creating lesbians. The men split from other men also run after their own kind and love being embraced by other men (191e). Those that come from original androgynous beings are the men and women that engage in heterosexual love. He says some people think homosexuals are shameless, but he thinks they are the bravest, most manly of all, as evidenced by the fact that only they grow up to be politicians (192a), and that many heterosexuals are adulterous and unfaithful (191e). Aristophanes then claims that when two people who were separated from each other find each other, they never again want to be separated (192c). This feeling is like a riddle, and cannot be explained. [...] Aristophanes ends on a cautionary note. [...] He says that men should fear the gods, and not neglect to worship them, lest they wield the axe again and we have to go about hopping on one leg, split apart again(193a). If man works with the god of Love, they will escape this fate and instead find wholeness.|$|E
2500|$|John William Carson {{was born}} on October 23, 1925, in Corning, Iowa, to Homer Lloyd [...] "Kit" [...] Carson (1899–1983), a power company manager, and Ruth Elizabeth (Hook) Carson (1901–1985), who was of Irish descent. He {{grew up in the}} nearby towns of Avoca, Clarinda, and Red Oak in {{southwest}} Iowa before moving to Norfolk, Nebraska at the age of eight. There, Carson grew up and began developing his talent for entertaining. At the age of 12, Carson found a book on magic at a friend's house and immediately purchased a mail-order magician's kit. After the purchase of the kit, Carson practiced his entertainment skills on family members with card tricks. He was known for following his family members <b>around</b> <b>saying,</b> [...] "Pick a card, any card." [...] Carson's mother sewed him a cape, and his first performance was staged in front of the local Kiwanis Club. He debuted as [...] "The Great Carsoni" [...] at age 14 and was paid $3 a show. Soon, many other performances at local picnics and country fairs followed. After graduating from high school, Carson had his first encounter with Hollywood. He hitchhiked to Hollywood, where he was arrested and fined $50 for impersonating a midshipman, a story often regarded as apocryphal. [...] "Johnny embarked on an adventure, one so laden with implications about his future, that some have wondered if the escapade might not actually be a legend." ...|$|E
2500|$|What ensued {{was one of}} {{the most}} vitriolic {{corporate}} battles of the 1980s, with Perot and Smith publicly exchanging barbs using the media, which delightedly splashed the story over every business publication in the U.S.. Perot notoriously lashed out at Smith in a 1988 exclusive to Fortune Magazine, saying: [...] "My question is: Why haven't we unleashed their potential? The answer is: the General Motors system. It's like a blanket of fog that keeps these people from doing what they know needs to be done. I come from an environment where, if you see a snake, you kill it. At GM, if you see a snake, the first thing you do is go hire a consultant on snakes. Then you get a committee on snakes, and then you discuss it for a couple of years. The most likely course of action is—nothing. You figure, the snake hasn't bitten anybody yet, so you just let him crawl around on the factory floor. We need to build an environment where the first guy who sees the snake kills it." [...] Perot went on to needle Smith regarding the opulent 25th floor GM offices in New York, [...] "An entire teak forest must have been decimated for that floor". Smith, who had obviously ignored the irony of the CEO of the largest public corporation in the world complaining about the opulence of the private office (which Perot had personally paid to furnish) of a rival, had responded to Perot's frequent criticism of GM's executive perks a year earlier, [...] "Perot's office (in Dallas) 'makes mine look like a shanty-town. He has Remingtons; he has a Gilbert Stuart painting hanging on the wall. Nobody runs <b>around</b> <b>saying</b> 'Get rid of Ross's office'".|$|E
