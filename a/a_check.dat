40|$|Methods for {{software}} testing based on Finite State Machines (FSMs) have been researched {{since the early}} 60 ’s. Many of these methods are about generating <b>a</b> <b>checking</b> sequence from <b>a</b> given FSM which is an input sequence that determines whether an implementation of the FSM is faulty or correct. In this paper, we consider one of these methods, which constructs <b>a</b> <b>checking</b> sequence by reducing the problem of generating <b>a</b> <b>checking</b> sequence to finding a Chinese rural postman tour on a graph induced by the FSM; we re-formulate the constraints used in this method {{as a set of}} Boolean formulas; and use a SAT solver to generate <b>a</b> <b>checking</b> sequence of minimal length...|$|R

5|$|Fundamental rights {{primarily}} protect {{individuals from}} any arbitrary state actions, but some rights are enforceable against individuals. For instance, the Constitution abolishes untouchability and also prohibits begar. These provisions act as <b>a</b> <b>check</b> both on state action {{as well as}} the action of private individuals. However, these rights are not absolute or uncontrolled and are subject to reasonable restrictions as necessary for the protection of general welfare. They can also be selectively curtailed. The Supreme Court has ruled that all provisions of the Constitution, including fundamental rights can be amended. However, the Parliament cannot alter the basic structure of the constitution. Since the fundamental rights can be altered only by a constitutional amendment, their inclusion is <b>a</b> <b>check</b> not only on the executive branch but also on the Parliament and state legislatures.|$|E

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{constructing}} <b>a</b> <b>checking</b> sequence for {{finite state machine}} (FSM) based testing is introduced. It {{is based on a}} recently suggested method which uses quite a different approach than almost all the methods developed since the introduction of the checking sequence generation problem around half a century ago. Unlike its predecessor which aggressively tries to recognize the states by applying identification sequences, our approach relies on yet to be generated parts of the sequence for this. The method may terminate without producing <b>a</b> <b>checking</b> sequence. We also suggest <b>a</b> method to <b>check</b> if <b>a</b> sequence is <b>a</b> <b>checking</b> sequence for this purpose. If it turns out not be <b>a</b> <b>checking</b> <b>a</b> sequence, a post processing phase extends the sequence further. We present the results of an experimental study showing that our two phase approach produces shorter checking sequences than the previously published methods. This experimental study is performed on FSMs that are randomly generated by using a tool implemented within this work to support this and other FSM based testing studies...|$|R

5|$|The king {{cannot be}} in check, nor can the king pass through squares {{that are under}} attack by enemy pieces, or move to a square where it would result in <b>a</b> <b>check.</b> Note that castling is {{permissible}} if the rook is attacked, or if the rook crosses a square that is attacked.|$|E
5|$|When a king {{is under}} {{immediate}} attack {{by one or}} two of the opponent's pieces, it is said to be in check. A response to <b>a</b> <b>check</b> is a legal move if it results in a position where the king is no longer under direct attack (that is, not in check). This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack. Castling is not a permissible response to <b>a</b> <b>check.</b> The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is in check, and there is no legal way to remove it from attack. It is illegal for a player to make a move that would put or leave the player's own king in check.|$|E

40|$|Given {{a finite}} state machine M, <b>a</b> <b>checking</b> {{sequence}} is <b>an</b> input sequence that is guaranteed {{to lead to a}} failure if the implementation under test is faulty and has no more states than M. There has been much interest in the automated generation of <b>a</b> short <b>checking</b> sequence from <b>a</b> {{finite state machine}}. However, such sequences can contain reset transitions whose use can adversely affect both the cost of applying the checking sequence and the effectiveness of the checking sequence. Thus, we sometimes want <b>a</b> <b>checking</b> sequence with <b>a</b> minimum number of reset transitions rather than <b>a</b> shortest <b>checking</b> sequence.
