5|$|The {{city has}} one of the most {{extensive}} bus networks outside London with over 50 bus companies operating in the Greater Manchester region radiating from the city. In 2011, 80% of public transport journeys in Greater Manchester were made by bus, amounting to 220 million passenger journeys by bus each year. Following deregulation in 1986, the bus system was taken over by GM Buses, which after privatisation was split into GM Buses North <b>and</b> <b>GM</b> Buses South and at a later date these were taken over by First Greater Manchester and Stagecoach Manchester respectively. First Greater Manchester also operates a three route zero-fare bus service, called Metroshuttle, which carries 2.8 million commuters a year around Manchester's business districts. Stagecoach Manchester is the Stagecoach Group's largest subsidiary and operates around 690 buses.|$|E
5|$|In June 1872, G.M. Shoop, a {{businessman}} from Danville bought 28 {{acres of land}} on the site that would become the Mountain Grove Campground. He reported this purchase in a meeting held on June 20, 1872 in Columbia County {{with a group of}} Methodists, including several ministers. In this meeting, an executive committee was appointed to arrange the camp meeting. The executive committee included Reverend S. Creighton, Reverend S. Barnes (the chairman), H.E. Sutherland (the secretary), Reverend B.P. King, Reverend E.T. Schwartz, M. Hartman, J.W. Cleaver, J.W. Eyer, <b>and</b> <b>G.M.</b> Shoop himself. Shoop intended to give the land to a local camp meeting organization once one existed. This idea was well received by the district superintendent of the Methodist Church. A committee consisting of four pastors and five lay leaders was subsequently created for the camp meeting site. Craig Newton, a history professor at what would become the Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania, stated that the site purchased by Shoop would be an ideal location for a camp meeting site.|$|E

5|$|The longest-tenured {{general manager}} is Paul Owens, with 11 {{years of service}} to the team in that role, from 1972 to 1983. Owens also served as the team manager in 1972, and from 1983 to 1984. After this time, he served as a team {{executive}} until 2003, and was inducted into the Philadelphia Baseball Wall of Fame in recognition of his services. The longest-tenured owner is Bob Carpenter, Jr., who was the team's primary shareholder from 1943 to 1972. He appointed the team's first general manager, Herb Pennock, during his tenure. In combination with his son, Ruly, the Carpenter family owned the Phillies for nearly 50 years (until 1981) until it was sold to Bill Giles, son of former league president Warren Giles. After Giles sold his part-ownership share, the Phillies are currently owned by John S. Middleton, Jim & Pete Buck, and former team President David Montgomery. The Phillies are currently overseen by team president Andy MacPhail <b>and</b> <b>GM</b> Matt Klentak.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the effect of matrigel microspheres (MM), gelatin hydrogel microspheres (<b>GM),</b> <b>and</b> matrigel-coated <b>GM</b> on the proliferated and biological functions of epithelial cells in cell aggregates incorporating the microspheres. The MM were prepared by a coacelvation method. When mammary epithelial EpH 4 cells were cultured with the MM, <b>GM,</b> <b>and</b> matrigel-coated <b>GM</b> in round U-bottom wells of 96 -multiwell culture plates which had been coated with poly (vinyl alcohol) (PVA) to suppress the cell adhesion, EpH 4 cell aggregates with each microspheres homogeneously incorporated were formed. Higher EpH 4 cells proliferation was observed for cell aggregates incorporating MM, <b>GM,</b> <b>and</b> matrigel-coated <b>GM</b> compared with the conventional 3 -dimensional (3 D) culture method. When examined to evaluate the epithelial differentiation of EpH 4 cells, the β-casein expression was significantly higher for the cell aggregates incorporating MM than that of aggregates incorporating <b>GM</b> <b>and</b> matrigel-coated <b>GM</b> or the conventional 3 D culture method. It is concluded that the proliferation and differentiation of mammary epithelial EpH 4 cells were promoted by the incorporation of MM...|$|R
