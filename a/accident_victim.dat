25|$|Bowie {{collaborated with}} English pop artist Derek Boshier {{on the cover}} design. The {{original}} gatefold album sleeve featured a full-length shot of Bowie by photographer Brian Duffy as an <b>accident</b> <b>victim,</b> heavily made up with an apparently broken nose. For effect, the image was deliberately of low resolution, taken with a Polaroid SX-70 type camera. The inside of the gatefold included pictures of Che Guevara's corpse, Andrea Mantegna's Lamentation of Christ and Bowie being readied for the cover photo. These images were not reproduced in the Rykodisc CD reissue in 1991.|$|E
500|$|There is an {{idealization}} of the [...] {{as presented}} in the film. In all but one case, the dead are either young or already made-up, such that [...] "the viewer can easily tolerate these images on the screen". The one corpse {{that had not been}} found for several days is never shown on screen. No bodies show the gaunt figure of one who has died after a long illness, or the cuts and bruises of an <b>accident</b> <b>victim.</b> Japanologist Mark R. Mullins writes that the gratitude shown in Departures would probably not have occurred in real life; according to Coffinman, there [...] "is nothing lower on the social scale than the mortician, and {{the truth of the matter}} is that [...] fear the coffinman and the cremator just as much as death and the corpse".|$|E

Malavika Avinash was approached to play Vikram's mother; she rejected the offer, stating, [...] "I am {{too young to}} do a screen mom and {{too old to be}} a heroine!" [...] Cochin Haneefa, Charle, Kalabhavan Mani, Shanmugarajan and Saurabh Shukla make cameo appearances as delinquent citizens. Haneefa played an indifferent car owner who refuses to help an <b>accident</b> <b>victim</b> as he does not want his [...] "brand new car" [...] to be soiled with blood. Following Haneefa's death in February 2010, Vikram recalled the actor's appearance in the film and said, [...] "Though he'd come only in a few scenes no one could miss him. For roles that have some ambiguity about whether it's a good guy or a bad guy, {{he is one of the}} best choices. Until the end, one cannot really guess if he'll end up being good or bad." [...] Comedian and character artiste Charle played an unnamed wastrel and alcoholic who extorts money from his ageing parents for his expenses and is considered by Anniyan to be a liability to society. Charle was instructed by Shankar, [...] "People should see only the character. Only later should they realise that it was Charle." ...|$|E

She {{played the role of}} a traffic <b>accident</b> <b>victim</b> in the film, which entered into the top five highest-grossing films of the year. Her performance in the film won her favourable reviews. Film critic M. Ali Ikram wrote about her performance: [...] "If there is a respite for Manisha's innumerable fans of late, this flick is it. We may not care about hits and flops, but it is painful to watch this acting virtuoso in the innumerable side roles she has been seen in of late. Indra Kumar's decision to cast Manisha here is a case of perfect casting, and she never lets him or the audience down. This lady is truly the Meena Kumari of her generation. It is great fun watching Manisha and Aamir Khan's perfect chemistry opposite one another. The film's climax has both stars permanently molding a spot for themselves in Bollywood history, and it will have you shedding tears by the bucketful.The film was considered 'Average' at the box office." ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction: Motor {{vehicles}} {{have transformed}} human life in radical and contradictory ways. At {{the same time}} that cars have brought comfort and ease to human life, they are also a main cause of trauma, pain, disability, and death worldwide. Objective: To investigate the quality of life and self-esteem of traffic <b>accident</b> <b>victims</b> undergoing physical rehabilitation. Methods: This was a controlled, cross-sectional study that compared quality of life and self-esteem among traffic <b>accident</b> <b>victims</b> in physical therapy with other <b>accident</b> <b>victims,</b> physical therapy patients for other causes, and the general population. Results: The self-esteem of individuals undergoing physical therapy due to traffic accidents was lower compared to <b>victims</b> of other <b>accidents</b> and those in physical therapy for other reasons (p < 0. 05). Regarding quality of life, the study group sample obtained the following mean scores: physical domain 48. 1; psychological 52. 8; social 68. 1; environmental 54. 1. These scores were lower than those of traffic <b>accident</b> <b>victims</b> who did not undergo physical therapy and of the general population in all domains (p < 0. 05), but higher than that of individuals undergoing physical therapy for other causes, except in the psychological domain. Conclusion: Self-esteem and quality of life were low in traffic <b>accident</b> <b>victims</b> undergoing physical therapy. Physical therapy professionals can {{play an important role in}} improving these conditions provided they assume a humanized posture, practicing patient-centered rather than disease-centered health actions...|$|R

40|$|The {{population}} on which forensic juvenile skeletal age estimation methods are applied {{has not been}} critically considered. Previous research suggests that child victims of homicide tend to be from socioeconomically disadvantaged contexts, and that these contexts impair growth. Thus, juvenile skeletal remains examined by forensic anthropologists may be short for age. Cadaver lengths were obtained from records of autopsies of 1256 individuals, aged birth to eighteen years at death, conducted between 2000 and 2015 in Australia, New Zealand, New Mexico, New York City, and Cuyahoga County. Growth status of the forensic population, represented by homicide victims, and general population, represented by <b>accident</b> <b>victims,</b> were compared using height for age Z-scores and independent sample t-tests. Cadaver lengths of the <b>accident</b> <b>victims</b> were evaluated against growth references using one sample t-tests to evaluate whether <b>accident</b> <b>victims</b> reflect the general population. Homicide victims are shorter for age than <b>accident</b> <b>victims</b> in samples from the United States, but not in Australia and New Zealand. <b>Accident</b> <b>victims</b> are more representative {{of the general population}} in Australia and New Zealand. Different results in Australia and New Zealand as opposed to the United States may be linked to higher socioeconomic inequality in the United States. These results suggest that physical anthropologists should critically select reference samples when devising forensic juvenile skeletal age estimation methods. Children examined in forensic investigations may be short for age, and thus methods developed on normal healthy children may yield inaccurate results...|$|R
