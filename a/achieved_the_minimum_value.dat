It is proved that if the basic virus reproductive number R 0 of the model is less than one, then the infection-free equilibrium point of the model is globally asymptotically stable; if R 0 of the model is more than one, then the endemic infection equilibrium point of the model is globally asymptotically stable.

The numerical simulation results are in agreement with the evolutions of the patients’ HIV RNA levels.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A delivery system based on novel polymeric hollow beads, loaded with Irgasan and methacrylated polymerizable Irgasan as active agents were used to manufacture three commonly formulated experimental resin composites. The non-modified resin was used as standard (ST). Material A contained the delivery system providing 4 % (m/m) Irgasan, material B contained 4 % (m/m) methacrylated Irgasan and material C 8 % (m/m) methacrylated Irgasan. Flexural strength (FS), flexural modulus (FM), water sorption (WS), solubility (SL), surface roughness Ra, polymerization shrinkage, contact angle Θ, total surface free energy γS and its apolar γS (LW), polar γS (AB), Lewis acid γS (+) and base γS (-) term as well as bacterial viability were determined. Significance was p < 0. 05. RESULTS: The materials A to C were not unacceptably influenced by <b>the</b> modifications and <b>achieved</b> <b>the</b> <b>minimum</b> <b>values</b> for FS, WS and SL as requested by EN ISO 4049 and did not differ from ST what was also found for Ra.
