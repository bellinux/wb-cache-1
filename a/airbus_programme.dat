40|$|Development, production, sales, {{and support}} of modern {{advanced}} technology aircraft has {{become more and more}} difficult, costly and risky for a single manufacturer to undertake the task alone. Joint ventures offer an attractive solution. Experience has shown that the old concept of a dominant manufacturer who retains full initiative, can be exceeded in efficiency by real 'cooperative ventures'. The key elements in such ventures are that pragmatic organizational and cooperative behavioural solutions are used. The positive aspects of joint 'team' work can indeed more than compensate for the apparently increased complexity. From the experience gained in the last 14 years in the European <b>Airbus</b> <b>Programme,</b> examples are given of representative problems and their solutions, covering: organization, optimization of the design through cross-fertilization, production sharing, market penetration in front of competition and others.

50|$|Airbus {{announced}} the first delay in June 2005 and notified airlines that deliveries would be delayed by six months. This reduced {{the total number}} of planned deliveries by the end of 2009 from about 120 to 90-100. On 13 June 2006, Airbus announced a second delay, with the delivery schedule slipping an additional six to seven months. Although the first delivery was still planned before the end of 2006, deliveries in 2007 would drop to only 9 aircraft, and deliveries by the end of 2009 would be cut to 70-80 aircraft. The announcement caused a 26% drop in the share price of Airbus' parent, EADS, and led to the departure of EADS CEO Noël Forgeard, Airbus CEO Gustav Humbert, and A380 programme manager Charles Champion. On 3 October 2006, upon completion of a review of the A380 <b>programme,</b> <b>Airbus</b> CEO Christian Streiff announced a third delay, pushing the first delivery to October 2007, to be followed by 13 deliveries in 2008, 25 in 2009, and the full production rate of 45 aircraft per year in 2010.

The measurements generally emphasize northern latitudes, although the simulation suggests that measurements over the Canadian, Northern and Central European regions {{are representative of}} the large-scale interannual ozone variability from 30 to 90 ° N at 500 hPa. CAM-chem is run with input meteorology from the National Center for Environmental Prediction; a tagging methodology is used to identify the stratospheric contribution to tropospheric ozone concentrations. A variant of the synthetic ozone tracer (synoz) is used to represent stratospheric ozone. Both the model and measurements indicate that on large spatial scales stratospheric interannual ozone variability drives significant tropospheric variability at 500 hPa and the surface. In particular, the simulation and the measurements suggest large stratospheric influence at the surface sites of Mace Head (Ireland) and Jungfraujoch (Switzerland) as well as many 500 hPa measurement locations. Both the measurements and simulation suggest the stratosphere has contributed to tropospheric ozone trends. In many locations between 30 - 90 ° N 500 hPa ozone significantly increased from 1990 - 2000, but has leveled off since (from 2000 - 2009). The simulated global ozone budget suggests global stratosphere-troposphere exchange increased in 1998 - 1999 in association with a global ozone anomaly. Discrepancies between the simulated and measured ozone budget include a large underestimation of measured ozone variability and discrepancies in long-term stratospheric ozone trends. This suggests the need for more sophisticated simulations including better representations of stratospheric chemistry and circulation...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to deliver the most accurate ozone (O 3) and carbon monoxide (CO) climatology for the pure troposphere only, i. e. exclusively from the ground to the dynamical tropopause on an individual profile basis. The results (profiles and columns) are derived solely from the Measurements of OZone and water vapour by in-service <b>AIrbus</b> airCraft <b>programme</b> (MOZAIC) over fifteen years (1994 - 2009). The study, focused on the northern mid-latitudes [24 ° N- 50 ° N] and [120 ° W- 140 ° E], includes more than 40 000 profiles over 11 sites to give a quasi-global zonal picture. Considering all the sites, the pure tropospheric column peak-to-peak seasonal cycle ranges are 23. 7 - 43. 2 DU for O 3 and 1. 7 - 6. 9 × 1018 mol cm− 2 for CO. The maxima of the seasonal cycles are not in phase, occurring in February-April for CO and May-July for O 3. The phase shift is related to the photochemistry and OH removal efficiencies. The purely tropospheric seasonal profiles are characterized by a typical autumn-winter/spring-summer O 3 dichotomy, (except in Los Angeles, Eastmed - a cluster of Cairo and Tel Aviv - and the regions impacted by the summer monsoon) and a summer-autumn/winter-spring CO dichotomy. We revisit the boundary-layer, mid-tropospheric (MT) and upper-tropospheric (UT) partial columns, using a new monthly-varying MT ceiling. Interestingly, the seasonal cycle maximum of the UT partial columns is shifted from summer to spring for O 3 and to very early spring for CO. Conversely, the MT maximum is shifted from spring to summer and is associated with a summer (winter) MT thickening (thinning). Lastly, the pure tropospheric seasonal cycles derived from our analysis are consistent with the cycles derived from spaceborne measurements, the correlation coefficients being r = 0. 6 - 0. 9 for O 3, and r > 0. 9 for CO. The cycles observed from space are nevertheless greater than MOZAIC for O 3 (by 9 - 18 DU) and smaller for CO (up to 1 × 1018 mol cm− 2). The larger winter O 3 difference between the two data sets suggests probable stratospheric contamination in satellite data due to the tropopause position. The study underlines the importance of rigorously discriminating between the stratospheric and tropospheric reservoirs and avoiding use of a monthly-averaged tropopause position without this strict discrimination, in order to assess the pure O 3 and CO tropospheric trends...|$|R
40|$|International audienceWe {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} stratospheric ozone on the interannual variability and trends in tropospheric ozone from 30 - 90 ° N between 1990 and 2009 using ozone measurements and a global chemical transport model (the Community Atmospheric Model with chemistry) with input meteorology from the National Center for Environmental Prediction. The model simulation uses constant interannual emissions. Both the model and measurements indicate that on large spatial scales stratospheric interannual ozone variability drives significant tropospheric variability and contributes to long-term tropospheric ozone trends. To diagnose the measured variability we utilized measurements from ozonesondes and the Measurements of OZone and water vapour by in-service <b>Airbus</b> airCraft <b>programme</b> (MOZAIC) north of 30 ° N. We identify a regionally robust 150 hPa ozone signal from measurements over Canadian, Northern European and Central European regions and at 500 hPa over Canadian, Northern European and Eastern US regions. Averaged over these regions, the 150 hPa interannual ozone variability explains 69 % of the interannual variability at 500 hPa. The simulated stratospheric signal explains 81 % of the simulated variability over these same regions. Simulated and measured ozone are significantly correlated over these regions and the simulation suggests that the ozone record over these regions {{is representative of the}} overall hemispheric 500 hPa ozone record from 30 - 90 ° N. The measured 500 hPa trends averaged over these three regions between 1990 and 2000 and 1990 and 2009 are 0. 73 (± 0. 51) ppbv yr− 1 and 0. 27 (± 0. 19) ppbv yr− 1, respectively. The simulated trends in 1990 - 2000 and 1990 - 2009 are 0. 29 ± 0. 10 ppbv yr− 1 and 0. 13 ± 0. 05 ppbv yr− 1, respectively; however, these trends are substantially larger when the model is sampled for missing data exactly as the measurements are. Simulated stratospheric ozone accounts for 79 % of the simulated 500 hPa trend between 1990 and 2000 and 100 % of the simulated trend between 1990 and 2009. Due to the importance of local meteorology and emissions at the surface it is difficult to isolate the stratospheric component of measured surface ozone variability. Overall when averaged between 30 - 90 ° N simulated surface interannual ozone trends are 0. 18 ppbv yr− 1 and 0. 07 ppbv yr− 1 between 1990 and 1999, and between 1990 and 2009, respectively. We have identified a number of surface sites where the measured interannual ozone variability is correlated with the 150 hPa ozone signal. Most notably these sites include the high mountain sites over Europe and Macehead, Ireland. Over Macehead the measured 150 hPa ozone signal explains 40 % of the interannual variability of the unfiltered measured ozone record. The simulated and measured ozone are highly correlated over Macehead. The Macehead measured and simulated unfiltered ozone trends between 1990 and 2000 are 0. 28 (± 0. 33) and 0. 17 (± 0. 13) ppbv yr− 1 respectively; between 1990 and 2009 the measured and simulated trends are 0. 18 (± 0. 11) and 0. 08 (± 0. 06) ppbv yr− 1, respectively. Increases in the simulated stratospheric ozone component accounts for 53 % and 75 % of the overall modeled trend for the two periods at Macehead...|$|R
