Instead of limiting our testing to code, we should start testing as soon as we start work on the requirements for a product.

30|$|REACH and in {{particular}} the classification, labelling, packaging (CLP) Regulation[37] base in general on the assumption that a substance has an intrinsic hazard profile independent from the manufacturing process. Thus, REACH information can be shared between the registrants of the substance, and the hazard classification based on the CLP Regulation should correspond (e.g. <b>agreed</b> <b>entry,</b> harmonised classification). However, this approach has limitations already for bulk materials. For example, bulk materials of the same substance can differ in their hazard profiles based on impurities or macroscopic particle size, leading to different classifications under the CLP Regulation. As already mentioned above, different nanomaterials of the same chemical composition often have very different properties and, subsequently, can differ in their hazard profile. This condition for instance can be utilised to define nanomaterials as substances on their own. In a paper from Competent Authorities for REACH and CLP (CARACAL), it is described that indeed in some cases the nanoform could be treated as a substance on its own: ‘In the case of substances at nanoscale, it is possible that some substances which in the past have been identified by the same EINECS number may have to be considered as different substances for the purpose of REACH’[38]. However, the paper does not provide criteria for this decision.|$|R

40|$|Abstract A {{study on}} {{investigating}} {{the issues of}} quality associated with cross-border higher education was carried out using the case study approach focusing on Zimbabwe. The methodology involved document analysis of the cases of regulation and accreditation of cross-border higher education providers and assessment of qualifications acquired from foreign higher education providers as well as interviews with staff from the national quality assurance body. The findings revealed that internationalisation of higher education, does offer several prospects and advantages {{but it can also}} negatively impact on the quality of higher education provision if certain activities are left unchecked. These include sub-standard and dubious foreign higher education providers who often enrol students who do not meet the minimum entry requirements as well as degree mills who sell qualifications to clients who do not merit obtaining them. Out of all the qualifications assessed from 2009 - 2013, 28 percent where found not comparable with similar local qualifications in terms of curriculum content, rigor, duration of study and entry requirements. The lessons from the study include the need for higher education institutions to enrol students who meet nationally <b>agreed</b> <b>entry</b> requirements as well as introducing qualifying courses before admission of those who do not initially meet the required standards for entry. Quality assurance bodies and institutions of higher learning should continue to collaborate with similar bodies globally in order to share best practices on quality assurance issues and setting of minimum standards.

To address the potential endogeneity of Paragraph IV challenges and settlements we estimate the model using instrumental variables. Our instruments include standard measures of patent strength and a measure of settlement legality based on a split between several Circuit Courts of Appeal. We find that Paragraph IV challenges increase generic entry, lower drug prices and increase quantity, while settlements effectively reverse the effect. These effects persist over time, inflating price and depressing quantity for up to 5 years after the challenge.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} low canonical polyadic (CP) rank tensor completion. A completion is a tensor whose <b>entries</b> <b>agree</b> with the observed entries and its rank matches the given CP rank. We analyze the manifold structure corresponding to the tensors with the given rank and define a set of polynomials based on the sampling pattern and CP decomposition. Then, we show that finite completability of the sampled tensor is equivalent to having {{a certain number of}} algebraically independent polynomials among the defined polynomials. Our proposed approach results in characterizing the maximum number of algebraically independent polynomials in terms of a simple geometric structure of the sampling pattern, and therefore we obtain the deterministic necessary and sufficient condition on the sampling pattern for finite completability of the sampled tensor. Moreover, assuming that the entries of the tensor are sampled independently with probability $p$ and using the mentioned deterministic analysis, we propose a combinatorial method to derive a lower bound on the sampling probability $p$, or equivalently, the number of sampled entries that guarantees finite completability with high probability. We also show that the existing result for the matrix completion problem can be used to obtain a loose lower bound on the sampling probability $p$. In addition, we obtain deterministic and probabilistic conditions for unique completability. It is seen that the number of samples required for finite or unique completability obtained by the proposed analysis on the CP manifold is orders-of-magnitude lower than that is obtained by the existing analysis on the Grassmannian manifold.

40|$|This entry {{examines}} {{the approach of}} Hyman P. Minsky to financial crisis. Minsky famously developed an ‘investment theory of the cycle and a financial theory of investment'. His thesis was that, {{over the course of}} the cycle, behaviour changes in such a way that financial fragility develops. This makes a financial crisis more likely. When the global financial crisis hit in 2008, many commentators returned to the theories of Minsky, calling it a ‘Minsky crisis' or a ‘Minsky moment'. This <b>entry</b> <b>agrees</b> that Minsky deserves credit for identifying the processes that led up to the crisis. However, it is not sufficient to narrowly constrain the analysis to the transition that occurred over the past decade or so. Beginning in the 1980 s and through to his death in 1996, Minsky had been arguing that a new form of capitalism had appeared, which he called ‘money manager capitalism'. In important respects it reproduced the conditions that Hilferding had called ‘finance capitalism' in the early 20 th century – a form of capitalism that collapsed into the Great Depression. What Minsky was arguing was that an extremely unstable form of capitalism had emerged – one based on what is often called financialisation of the economy. He (rightly) feared that it would ultimately lead to a great crash. The rest of the entry looks at Minsky's proposals for reforms that would help to promote stability. Yet, as Minsky always said, stability is destabilising. financial instability hypothesis, global financial crisis, Hyman Minsky, money manager capitalism, self-regulating markets, stability is destabilizing...|$|R
