Thymocytes bearing 2 C TCR differentiated normally. They were positively selected without evidence of intrathymic clonal deletion. Survival of H- 2 Ld-bearing skin allografts was significantly prolonged in pancreatic H- 2 Ld singly and doubly transgenic mice, consistent with an in vivo state of T-cell tolerance. The mechanism of tolerance induction was determined and found to have two components. First, up to 80 % of peripheral CD 8 + 2 C TCR+ <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> were eliminated. Second, those <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> which escaped elimination had a significantly reduced proliferative response to H- 2 Ld.

40|$|Therapeutic {{efficacy}} of a tumor cell–based vaccine against experimental B 16 melanoma requires {{the disruption of}} either of two immunoregulatory mechanisms that control <b>autoreactive</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> responses: the cytotoxic T lymphocyte–associated antigen (CTLA) - 4 pathway or the CD 25 � regulatory T (Treg) cells. Combination of CTLA- 4 blockade and depletion of CD 25 � Treg cells results in maximal tumor rejection. Efficacy of the antitumor therapy correlates with the extent of autoimmune skin depigmentation {{as well as with}} the frequency of tyrosinaserelated protein 2 180 – 188 –specific CTLs detected in the periphery. Furthermore, tumor rejection is dependent on the CD 8 � T cell subset. Our data demonstrate that the CTL response against melanoma antigens is an important component of the therapeutic antitumor response and that the reactivity of these CTLs can be augmented through interference with immunoregulatory mechanisms. The synergism in the effects of CTLA- 4 blockade and depletion of CD 25 � Treg cells indicates that CD 25 � Treg cells and CTLA- 4 signaling represent two alternative pathways for suppression of <b>autoreactive</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> immunity.

40|$|The {{central nervous}} system (CNS) is {{considered}} an immune-privileged tissue protected by a specific vessel structure, the brain-blood barrier (BBB). Upon infection or traumatic injury in the CNS, the BBB is breached, and various immune cells are recruited to the affected area. In the case of autoimmune diseases in the CNS like multiple sclerosis (MS), <b>autoreactive</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> against some CNS-specific antigens can theoretically attack neurons throughout the CNS. The affected CNS regions in MS patients can be detected as multiple focal plaques in the cerebrum, thoracic cord, and other regions. Vision problems are often associated with the initial phase of MS, suggesting a disturbance in the optic nerves. These observations raise {{the possibility that there}} exist specific signals that direct <b>autoreactive</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> past the BBB and into particular sites of the CNS. Using a mouse model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we recently defined the mechanism of the pathogenesis in which regional neural stimulations modulate the status of the blood vessel endothelium to allow the invasion of <b>autoreactive</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> into specific sites of the CNS via the fifth lumbar cord. This gate for <b>autoreactive</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> can be artificially manipulated by removing gravity forces on the hind legs or by electric pulses to the soleus muscles, quadriceps, and triceps of mice, resulting in an accumulation of <b>autoreactive</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> in the intended regions via the activation of regional neurons.

In this study, we report that CD 24 deficiency caused deletion of <b>autoreactive</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> that normally escape {{negative selection}}. Restoration of CD 24 expression on <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> alone did not prevent <b>autoreactive</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> from deletion; bone marrow chimera experiments suggest that CD 24 on radio-resistant stromal cells is necessary for preventing deletion of <b>autoreactive</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> CD 24 deficiency abrogated the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in transgenic mice with a TCR specific for a pathogenic autoan-tigen.

40|$|Major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC) genes, {{also known as}} human leukocyte antigen genes (HLA) in humans, are the prevailing contributors of genetic susceptibility to autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 Diabetes (T 1 D), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), among others (Todd and Wicker, 2001;MacKay et al., 2002;Hafler et al., 2007). Although the pathways through which MHC molecules afford autoimmune risk or resistance remain to be fully mapped out, it is generally accepted that they do so by shaping the central and peripheral T cell repertoires of the host towards autoimmune proclivity or resistance, respectively. Disease-predisposing MHC alleles would both spare autoreactive thymocytes from central tolerance and bias their development towards a pathogenic phenotype. Protective MHC alleles, on the other hand, would promote central deletion of autoreactive thymocytes and skew their development towards non-pathogenic phenotypes. This interpretation of the data {{is at odds with}} two other observations: that in MHC-heterozygous individuals, resistance is dominant over susceptibility; and {{that it is difficult to}} understand how deletion of one or a few clonal <b>autoreactive</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> types would suffice to curb autoimmune responses driven by hundreds if not thousands of <b>autoreactive</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> specificities.

40|$|How {{small numbers}} of CD 4 +CD 25 + {{regulatory}} T cells suppress autoimmune responses in vivo is unclear. In this report we analyze the immunomodulatory activity of CD 4 +CD 25 + T cells that are antigen-specifically redirected against myelin basic protein (MBP) 89 - 101 -specific autoreactive T cells by a MBP 89 - 101 -IAs-ζ chimeric receptor. We have previously shown that these redirected regulatory T cells are highly potent in treating a model autoimmune disease, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. We show here that they have only limited effect in vivo on <b>autoreactive</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> proliferation and therefore do not act by deleting or suppressing the expansion of pathologic effector cells. Rather, the redirected CD 4 +CD 25 + T cells divert the pathologic T helper 1 self-specific T cell response to one characterized by high IL- 10 and lower IL- 4 production. Significantly, when isolated from the inducing CD 4 +CD 25 + regulatory T cells, these self-specific T cells can independently suppress the <b>autoreactive</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> response and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis development in an IL- 10 -dependent manner.

These experiments strongly suggest that some autoreactive T cells are derived from antigen-stimulated precursors. This result contrasts with that obtained when autoreactive T cells are selected in bulk cultures, or in the presence of exogenous T cell factors. We conclude that, under optimal conditions, most autoreactive T cells are recruited from a relatively stable pool of predominantly I-A-specific precursors.

40|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is {{an inflammatory}} {{disease of the}} central nervous system (CNS), characterized by inflammation, demyelination and axonal loss underlying progressive clinical disability. The chronic inflammatory tissue damage involving myelin and axons is driven by <b>autoreactive</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> and represents a key mechanism in the immunopathogenesis of MS. Over the last few years, evidence from MS and experimental models of neuroinflammation has suggested that autoimmune responses could exert neuroprotective effects through the release of neurotrophins by <b>autoreactive</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> Specifically, the role of the Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in facilitating brain tissue repair in experimental traumatic injury has been well recognized. Support for this hypothesis comes from recent studies showing that glatiramer acetate, a currently approved treatment for MS, promotes the expansion of <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> clones crossing the blood-brain barrier and releasing BDNF in situ. A small subset of <b>autoreactive</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> expresses the high-affinity full-length receptor for BDNF (TrkB-TK) in the periphery.

40|$|Fate {{determination}} for <b>autoreactive</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> {{relies on}} a series of avidity-dependent interactions during <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> selection, represented by two general types of signals, one based on antigen expression and density during <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> development, and one based on genes that interpret the avidity of TCR interaction to guide developmental outcome. We used proinsulin-specific HLA class II tetramers to purify and determine transcriptional signatures for <b>autoreactive</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> under differential selection in type 1 diabetes (T 1 D), in which insulin (INS) genotypes consist of protective and susceptible alleles that regulate the level of proinsulin expression in the thymus. Upregulation of steroid nuclear receptor family 4 A (NR 4 A) and early growth response family genes in proinsulin-specific <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> was observed in individuals with susceptible INS-VNTR genotypes, suggesting a mechanism for avidity-dependent fate determination of the <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> repertoire in <b>T</b> 1 D. The NR 4 A genes act as translators of TCR signal strength that guide central and peripheral <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> fate decisions through transcriptional modification. We propose that maintenance of an NR 4 A-guided program in low avidity <b>autoreactive</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> in <b>T</b> 1 D reflects their prio...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAltered Ras {{superfamily}} {{guanine nucleotide}} triphosphatase signaling {{may contribute to}} the activation of autoreactive T cells in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. Here, we show that transgenic expression of activated Rap 1, a Ras-related protein which is protective in murine arthritis, in both wildtype (WT) and 2 D 2 mice, enhances <b>autoreactive</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> activation by myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide in vitro and in vivo. However, RapV 12 reduces the number of autoreactive T cells in both WT and 2 D 2 mice, and increases murine survival in experimental autoimmune encephalitis, suggesting Rap 1 activation restricts autoimmune T cell-mediated pathology through enhancing tolerance...|$|E
30|$|Our {{results do}} not suggest a role of CISH SNPs in the {{susceptibility}} to T 1 D, whereas other reports showed an association with susceptibility to infectious diseases [11]. CIS {{is involved in}} the regulation of several cytokines including IL- 7, which is crucial for naïve and memory T cell homeostasis and may promote <b>autoreactive</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> responses in T 1 D [23]. Therefore, a possible role of CIS in T 1 D may be more complex and not based on impaired cytokine-induced CIS expression of different haplotypes. In accordance, multiple roles of CIS in different immune cell populations have been described [12, 13, 24]. Further analyses are needed to address this question.|$|E

To {{investigate}} {{the spectrum of}} B cell autoimmunity in the recently described anti-CD 1 – <b>autoreactive</b> <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> receptor (TCR) –transgenic murine lupus-like (CD 1 lupus-like) model. Methods. Lethally irradiated BALB/c/nu/nu mice were injected intravenously with donor BALB/c bone marrow and spleen cells expressing TCR and TCR transgenes that recognize CD 1 d. Sera from adoptive host animals that developed lupus (i. e., CD 1 lupus mice) were collected at serial time points and analyzed by Western blotting and immunoprecipitation, using protein extracts prepared from NIH 3 T 3 mouse fibro-blasts and EL- 4 lymphocytes, respectively. Sera ob-tained from older animals in several models of sponta-neous lupus (NZB/NZW, MRL, and MRL/lpr mice) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{functional}} {{immune system}} requires a <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> repertoire that is extremely diverse {{so as to}} allow for the elimination of all possible pathogens. However, the production of an immense <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> repertoire also increases the likelihood of generating <b>autoreactive</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> The immune system must therefore also incorporate a means of silencing or eliminating <b>autoreactive</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells,</b> while minimally sacrificing <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> diversity. The induction and maintenance of <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> unresponsiveness to self antigens is thus defined as <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> tolerance. This review provides an overview of the <b>T</b> <b>cell</b> tolerance mechanisms invoked in the thymus and in the periphery to prevent the induction of autoimmunity. Factors that can influence the induction of tolerance and autoimmunity are also discussed. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|NK cell {{self-tolerance}} {{is maintained}} by inhibitory receptors specific for MHC class I molecules. Inhibitory NK receptors are also expressed on memory CD 8 <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> but their biological relevance on <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> is unclear. In this study, {{we describe the}} expression of the Ly 49 A receptor on a subset of <b>autoreactive</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> which persist in mice double-transgenic for the lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus-derived peptide gp 33 and a TCRalphabeta specific for the gp 33. No Ly 49 A-expressing cells are found in TCRalphabeta single-transgenic mice, indicating that the presence of the autoantigen is required for Ly 49 A induction. Direct evidence for an Ag-specific initiation of Ly 49 A expression has been obtained in vitro after stimulation of <b>autoreactive</b> TCRalphabeta <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> with the cognate self-Ag. This expression of Ly 49 A substantially reduces Ag-specific activation of <b>autoreactive</b> <b>T</b> <b>cells.</b> These findings thus suggest that autoantigen-specific induction of inhibitory NK <b>cell</b> receptors on <b>T</b> <b>cells</b> may contribute to peripheral self-tolerance...|$|R
