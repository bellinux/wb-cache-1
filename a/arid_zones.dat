However, there is a low density of elands in Africa due to poaching and human settlement.|$|E
5|$|Most birds scoop {{water in}} their beaks {{and raise their}} head to let water run down the throat. Some species, {{especially}} of <b>arid</b> <b>zones,</b> belonging to the pigeon, finch, mousebird, button-quail and bustard families are capable of sucking up water without the need to tilt back their heads. Some desert birds depend on water sources and sandgrouse are particularly well known for their daily congregations at waterholes. Nesting sandgrouse and many plovers carry water to their young by wetting their belly feathers. Some birds carry water for chicks at the nest in their crop or regurgitate it along with food. The pigeon family, flamingos and penguins have adaptations to produce a nutritive fluid called crop milk that they provide to their chicks.|$|E

40|$|The <b>arid</b> <b>zone</b> {{of northwestern}} India {{is a unique}} {{adaptation}} zone for crop plants because of its pervasive severe moisture stress and high temperatures. Pearl millet (Pennisetum glaucum) is a major cereal in this zone as it represents approximately 25 % of the total acreage of the crop in the country. Pearl millet hybrid cultivars, which have gained widespread acceptance from farmers elsewhere in the country, have not been adopted in the <b>arid</b> <b>zone.</b> Farmers continue to sow their traditional landraces because the yield advantage of current hybrids is not expressed in this zone, {{and the risk of}} failure in poor years with the hybrids is unacceptably high. The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research have been collaborating to understand the unique nature of pearl millet in the <b>arid</b> <b>zone</b> since the late 1980 s. This collaboration has produced {{a better understanding of how}} <b>arid</b> <b>zone</b> farmers manage their germplasm, of the unique features of this invaluable resource and of a range of ways of using this germplasm to produce well-adapted new varieties and hybrids that will meet the requirements of the farmers of the <b>arid</b> <b>zone.</b> It has been shown that new cultivars for the <b>arid</b> <b>zone</b> need to be based on parental materials, including traditional landraces that are specifically adapted to the <b>arid</b> <b>zone.</b> This paper summarizes the main lessons of nearly 20 years of this collaborative research...|$|R

40|$|In the <b>arid</b> <b>zone,</b> loosely {{defined as}} having {{rainfall}} below 300 mm/year, life survivesat {{the limits of}} its capacity for adaptation. Survival of both plants and animals requires them to be specialists and species must {{have the capacity to}} cope with, or avoid, stress resulting from lack of moisture in their environment. Behavioural adap-tations of animals and physiological adaptations of plants and animals able to survive in the <b>arid</b> <b>zone</b> are therefore of special interest. The study of their physiology raises general issues about the limits of adaptation of which species are capable. Although areas subject to drought, the <b>arid</b> <b>zone</b> and semi-arid zones, comprise between 30 and 45 per cent of the Earth’s landmass, they have been relatively little studied.

25|$|Flash floods are {{the most}} common flood type in normally-dry {{channels}} in <b>arid</b> <b>zones,</b> known as arroyos in the southwest United States and many other names elsewhere. In that setting, the first flood water to arrive is depleted as it wets the sandy stream bed. The leading edge of the flood thus advances more slowly than later and higher flows. As a result, the rising limb of the hydrograph becomes ever quicker as the flood moves downstream, until the flow rate is so great that the depletion by wetting soil becomes insignificant.|$|E
25|$|Crop {{areas were}} farmed in two highly diverse manners. Areas relying on {{non-irrigated}} cultivation (secano), which made up 85% {{of the entire}} crop area, depended solely on rainfall {{as a source of}} water. They included the humid regions of the north and the northwest, as well as vast <b>arid</b> <b>zones</b> that had not been irrigated. The much more productive regions devoted to irrigated cultivation (regadío) accounted for 3 million hectares in 1986, and the government hoped that this area would eventually double, as it already had doubled since 1950. Particularly noteworthy was the development in Almería—one of the most arid and desolate provinces of Spain—of winter crops of various fruits and vegetables for export to Europe.|$|E
25|$|In extratropical Eurasia and the Americas {{almost all}} song is {{produced}} by male birds; however in the tropics and {{to a greater extent}} the desert belts of Australia and Africa it is more typical for females to sing as much as males. These differences have been {{known for a long time}} and are generally attributed to the much less regular and seasonal climate of Australian and African <b>arid</b> <b>zones</b> requiring that birds breed at any time when conditions are favourable, although they cannot breed in many years because food supply never increases above a minimal level. With aseasonal irregular breeding, both sexes must be brought into breeding condition and vocalisation, especially duetting, serves this purpose. The high frequency of female vocalisations in the tropics, Australia and Southern Africa may also relate to very low mortality rates producing much stronger pair-bonding and territoriality.|$|E

25|$|Long {{associated}} with traditional images of Russian landscape and cossacks on horseback are the steppes, which are treeless, grassy plains. Although they covered only 15 percent of Soviet territory, the steppes were home to roughly 44 {{percent of the}} population. They extend for 4,000 kilometers from the Carpathian Mountains in the western Ukrainian Republic across most of the northern portion of the Kazakh Republic in Soviet Central Asia, between the taiga and <b>arid</b> <b>zones,</b> occupying a relatively narrow band of plains whose chernozem soils {{are some of the}} most fertile on earth. In a country of extremes, the steppe zone, with its moderate temperatures and normally adequate levels of sunshine and moisture, provides the most favorable conditions for human settlement and agriculture. Even here, however, agricultural yields were sometimes adversely affected by unpredictable levels of precipitation and occasional catastrophic droughts.|$|E
500|$|Cucurbita species {{fall into}} two main groups. The first group are annual or {{short-lived}} perennial vines and are mesophytic, i.e. they require {{a more or less}} continuous water supply. The second group are perennials growing in <b>arid</b> <b>zones</b> and so are xerophytic, tolerating dry conditions. Cultivated Cucurbita species were derived from the first group. Growing [...] in height or length, the plant stem produces tendrils to help it climb adjacent plants and structures or extend along the ground. Most species do not readily root from the nodes; a notable exception is C.ficifolia, and the four other cultivated mesophytes do this to a lesser extent. The vine of the perennial Cucurbita can become semiwoody if left to grow. There is wide variation in size, shape, and color among Cucurbita fruits, and even within a single species. C.ficifolia is an exception, being highly uniform in appearance. The morphological variation in the species C.pepo and C.maxima is so vast that its various subspecies and cultivars have been misidentified as totally separate species.|$|E

2500|$|The Paleogene (...) {{comprises}} {{the first part}} of the Cenozoic, which during this time the continents assumed their modern shapes. The fragments of Gondwana (South America, Africa, India and Australia) began to drift northwards. The collision of India with the Eurasian landmass led to the folding and formation of the Himalayas. Similarly, the Alps were folded in Central Europe by the collision of the African plate with Europe. A land bridge between North America and South America did not yet exist. The Atlantic Ocean continued to widen during the Paleogene. In the North, the last land bridge between North America and Europe broke up during the Eocene. Climate during the Paleogene was warm and tropical as most time during the Mesozoic. The climate in the beginning was drier and cooler than in the preceding Cretaceous, but the temperature strongly increased during the Eocene and subtropical vegetation spread up to Greenland and Patagonia. The climate near the poles was cool temperate, in Europe, North America, Australia and the southern part of South America warm temperate. Near the equator there was tropical climate, flanked by hot and <b>arid</b> <b>zones</b> in the north and the south. In the Oligocene, global cooling started. Antarctica was covered by an ice sheet and subsequently, sea levels dropped. Except an intermittent warm period during the late Oligocene, global cooling continued and finally led to the Pleistocene ice age.|$|E

Both <b>arid</b> <b>zone</b> honeyeaters had a significantly higher (P less than 0. 001) percentage of medulla in the kidneys, while the wet zone birds had a significantly higher (P less than 0. 001) percentage of cortex. There were few differences between <b>arid</b> and wet <b>zone</b> honeyeaters in the percentage of nephron components in the cortex and medulla. Both <b>arid</b> <b>zone</b> bird species had a significantly larger volume of medulla, a feature characteristic of a high ability to conserve water by producing a concentrated urine. Both wet zone species had a higher volume of cortex but the difference was not significant. Few differences were found in the volumes and surface areas of tubules within the nephron. Differences that did occur were not always consistent with a high ability to conserve either ions or water more efficiently. The volume and surface area of brush border in the proximal tubule were significantly higher in the little wattlebird.

50|$|Nubian {{sandstone}} exposures in sub-humid, semi-arid, and arid conditions produce {{soil that}} is red-sandy but {{very different in}} other aspects. Only in sub-humid zones do these soils contain a moderately developed profile, including a textural B horizon lacking soluble salts and carbonates. In semi-arid and <b>arid</b> <b>zones,</b> profile differentiation is either weak or does not exist. In <b>arid</b> <b>zones</b> soils are shallow and contain carbonates, and soluble salts, including gypsum. The sole clay common to all Nubian sandstone parent materials is Kaolinite, which is the major clay mineral in sub-humid zone soil. In semi-arid soils smectite is a second major clay component. In <b>arid</b> <b>zones</b> small amounts of smectite and palygorskite accompany kaolinite. It is likely that smectite and palygorskite are products of pedogenic neoformation. Aeolian material was probably introduced into the silt and fine sand fractions from semi-arid and arid soils. It {{is also possible that}} some contamination of clay fractions occurred.|$|E
