40|$|Intangible {{services}} have fewer cues to enable consumer evaluation compared to physical goods. Cues are therefore {{particularly important for}} highly intangible services, since they provide tangible evidence of quality. This study explores whether luxury brand <b>room</b> <b>amenities</b> {{can be used as}} cues for customers to evaluate a hotel. This study attempts to identify what items and amenities guests find most/least useful and to examine whether luxury brand <b>room</b> <b>amenities</b> can enhance customers&# 39; evaluation of a hotel and increase willingness to pay based on positivity bias. Wi-Fi was regarded as the most useful hotel amenity, while telephone was regarded as the least useful amenity. This study found customers willingness to pay is affected by providing luxury brand <b>room</b> <b>amenities.</b> When luxury amenities were placed in the room, customers&# 39; estimation of the room rate and their willingness to pay for it both increased. Moreover, about two out of five expressed a willingness to pay extra for an upgrade to access luxury brand <b>room</b> <b>amenities.</b> The findings of this study provide important implications for hotel practitioners. #C# 2014 Elsevier Ltd.
