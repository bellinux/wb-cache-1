5|$|The Raptor's {{aerodynamic}} performance, sensor fusion, and stealth {{work together}} for increased effectiveness. Altitude, speed, and advanced active and passive sensors allow the aircraft to spot targets at considerable ranges and increase weapons range; altitude and speed also complement stealth's ability to increase the aircraft's survivability <b>against</b> <b>ground</b> defenses such as surface-to-air missiles.|$|E
5|$|In November 1952, Bolt {{transferred}} to squadron VMF-115, {{an element of}} the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing flying F9F Panther fighter-bomber aircraft in South Korea. He flew 94 combat missions with the squadron, all of them in bombing runs and close air support and air strike missions <b>against</b> <b>ground</b> targets. He did not enjoy this duty, preferring instead to fly the Sabre in air-to-air combat. As his squadron headed to Japan for R, he traveled to Seoul to visit the 4th Fighter-Interceptor Wing at Kimpo Airfield.|$|E
5|$|To {{preserve}} the secrecy of the weapon, its use was initially permitted only over water, where a dud round could {{not fall into}} enemy hands. In late 1943, the Army obtained permission {{for it to be}} used over land. It proved particularly effective against the V-1 flying bomb over England, and later Antwerp in 1944. The use of a version fired from howitzers <b>against</b> <b>ground</b> targets was authorized in response to the German Ardennes Offensive in December 1944, with deadly effect. By the end of 1944, VT fuzes were coming off the production lines at the rate of 40,000 per day.|$|E

5|$|Braham was not {{satisfied}} with his current score-rate and lack of action in September 1943. Consequently, he flew a number of missions <b>against</b> <b>ground</b> targets. Successful night fighter pilots were ordered {{not to engage in}} such activities that exposed them to excessive risk. On one particular mission he decided to hunt enemy rail transport after failing to find enemy aircraft. On the Dieppe to Paris line he intercepted a locomotive which exploded after being hit. He attacked another but struck some trees which damaged the underside of the fuselage. Braham maintained control and flew home. It was not unusual for him to return with strange defections caused by collisions with objects. After one sortie against shipping the armourers were drenched in salt water and seaweed when they opened the panel housing the cannons with the intention of replacing spent ammunition.|$|E
5|$|By June 30, air {{assets were}} being rallied <b>against</b> <b>ground</b> targets {{as well as}} aircraft. That day the 19th Bombardment Group was being used to bomb targets along the Han River. Meanwhile, the 3rd Bombardment Group bombed targets around Seoul, seeking to slow the North Korean advance southward from the newly {{captured}} city. These assets also attacked North Korean convoys and troop movements along the roads to great effect. During these attacks North Korean aircraft rarely opposed the US aircraft, but in a few occasions Yak-9 flights appeared, and in one instance engaged a flight of F-80s from the 36th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, allowing Lieutenants Charles A. Wurster and John B. Thomas to score a victory each. In spite of 25 bombing missions in Seoul, however, the North Korean troops were continuing their advance, forcing the US forces to abandon Suwon Airfield.|$|E
5|$|Howell {{spent eight}} months flying {{operations}} over Italy, conducting attacks <b>against</b> <b>ground</b> targets {{and engaging in}} sorties against aerial forces. While in Italy, he was credited with shooting down a total of nineteen aircraft. In one particular sortie on 12 July 1918, Howell attacked, in conjunction with one other aircraft, a formation of between ten and fifteen German machines; he personally shot down five of these planes and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. He had previously been awarded the Military Cross and Distinguished Flying Cross for his gallantry in operations over the front. He was posted back to the United Kingdom in July 1918. In 1919, Howell was killed while {{taking part in the}} England to Australia air race. Piloting a Martinsyde A1 aircraft, he attempted to make an emergency landing on Corfu but the plane fell short, crashing into the sea just off the island's coast. Both Howell and his navigator subsequently drowned.|$|E

5|$|In August 2012, the 9th Expeditionary Bomb Squadron {{returned}} from a six-month tour in Afghanistan. Its 9 B-1Bs flew 770 sorties, {{the most of any}} B-1B squadron on a single deployment. The squadron spent 9,500 hours airborne, keeping one of its bombers in the air at all times. They accounted for a quarter of all combat aircraft sorties over the country during that time and fulfilled an average of two to three air support requests per day. On 4 September 2013, a B-1B participated in a maritime evaluation exercise, deploying munitions such as laser-guided 500lb GBU-54 bombs, 500lb and 2,000lb Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM), and Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles (LRASM). The aim was to detect and engage several small craft using existing weapons and tactics developed from conventional warfare <b>against</b> <b>ground</b> targets; the B-1 is seen as a useful asset for maritime duties such as patrolling shipping lanes.|$|E
25|$|In 1922 a {{radio station}} was established. It used two masts {{insulated}} <b>against</b> <b>ground</b> each with a height of 152 metres. The last mast of the station was demolished in 2009.|$|E
25|$|From 1 May to 14 June 1982, Argentine Canberras made 54 sorties; 36 of them bombing missions, {{of which}} 22 were at night <b>against</b> <b>ground</b> troops. Two {{aircraft}} {{were lost in}} combat, the first to a Sea Harrier's AIM-9L Sidewinder air-to-air missile on 1 May 1982.|$|E

25|$|Goliath used three {{umbrella}} antennae, {{which were}} arranged radially around three 210 metre tall guyed steel tube masts and were insulated <b>against</b> <b>ground.</b> At their edges these antennas were mounted on grounded 170 metre tall guyed lattice steel masts. Three of these masts carried two umbrella antennas to comprise 15 lattice steel masts.|$|E
25|$|Air raid shelters, {{also known}} as bomb shelters, are {{structures}} {{for the protection of}} non-combatants as well as combatants against enemy attacks from the air.

50|$|In 1949, the {{reconstruction}} of the transmitter started under the new socialist government. The transmitter was equipped with a 60-metre tall guyed tube mast, which was insulated <b>against</b> the <b>ground.</b> It entered service on 25 March 1951. This radio mast was replaced a little later by a 136-metre high guyed steel framework mast, which was also insulated <b>against</b> the <b>ground.</b>|$|R

No. 462 Squadron was the only Halifax-equipped squadron in North Africa during 1942 and suffered from shortages of aircrew as a result. This problem became so severe in December that the squadron became non-operational until January 1943.|$|E
25|$|By mid-1944, the Allies were {{achieving}} {{air superiority}} over Burma, sightings of Japanese aircraft had become rare and LAA guns were more often being used <b>against</b> <b>ground</b> targets in jungle fighting. Some LAA units were broken up to provide reinforcements for the infantry, while the LAA/AT units became solely A/T. On 1 September 1944, while back at Yairipok in India, 55th LAA/AT Rgt became 111th Anti-Tank Regiment, RA with 165th, 203rd and 290th A/T Btys.|$|E
25|$|It {{soon became}} clear that the unarmed troop {{helicopters}} were vulnerable <b>against</b> <b>ground</b> fire from Viet Cong and North Vietnamese troops, particularly as they came down to drop their troops in a landing zone. Without friendly support from artillery or ground forces, the only way to pacify a landing zone was from the air, preferably with an aircraft that could closely escort the transport helicopters, and loiter over the landing zone as the battle progressed. By 1962 a small number of armed UH-1As were used as escorts, armed with multiple machine guns and rocket mounts.|$|E

25|$|Many aerial {{victories}} {{were achieved}} and the Fw 190 fighter-bomber pilots demonstrated how effective the Fw 190 could be <b>against</b> <b>ground</b> targets, the III.Gruppe/ZG 2 (renamed III./SKG 10 in December 1942) being particularly successful. This unit operated throughout the Tunisian campaign, and attacked {{a variety of}} Allied targets including airfields, harbours, tanks, vehicles, troop concentrations, anti-aircraft positions, and on one occasion, a British submarine. The fighter pilots of II./JG 2 downed scores of British, American and French aircraft, especially {{during the first three}} months of 1943, and Kurt Bühligen and Erich Rudorffer became two of the top scorers in the Tunisian campaign.|$|E
25|$|On 12 September 1942, the 8th and 89th Bombardment Squadron A-20s {{attacked}} the Japanese airfield at Buna. The Japanese, expecting an attack from 3,000 to 4,000 feet were caught off guard. The A-20 crews {{came in at}} tree top level. When the last A-20 pulled away, it left the airfield a flaming wreck with 17 Japanese aircraft destroyed. The group continued low-level attacks <b>against</b> <b>ground</b> targets {{in support of the}} Papua Campaign in their A-20s, fought from 23 July 1942 to 23 January 1943, to clear the Japanese from its lodgments at Buna and Gona on the northeast coast of New Guinea. The campaign earned them their first Distinguished Unit Citation.|$|E
25|$|Missions {{flown by}} the 366th TFW {{consisted}} generally of two types—MiG-CAP patrols to protect strike aircraft from attack by marauding North Vietnamese fighters and fighter-bomber strikes {{carried out with}} iron bombs <b>against</b> <b>ground</b> targets. The MiG patrols and attacks in North Vietnam were {{taken over by the}} F-4s and F-105s based in Thailand, which could carry a larger bomb load further and faster. In addition, the F-105 was built to take the extreme structural loads of low-level, high-speed flight, whereas the F-100 was not. Consequently, the F-100D fighter bombers generally operated only in South Vietnam where the F-100 {{turned out to be a}} very effective ground support aircraft, and beat back many enemy attacks.|$|E
