40|$|This article {{investigates the}} causes and scale of land-related public service inefficiencies in Ghana. Public choice theorists contend that {{the primary cause of}} {{inefficiency}} of public service agencies is their tendency to grow excessively. The finding of the study did not support the excessive growth proposition as far as the land-related public service agencies in Ghana are concerned. On the contrary, the evidence suggests that the agencies in question are shrinking in size, with some experiencing deficit budgetary growth rate of approximately − 28. 71 % (Land Title Registry). Large proportions of inefficiencies were rather discovered in nontraditional (hidden) sources, such as insufficient budgets, misallocations of limited funds, and imbalances {{in the structure of the}} respective workforces of these agencies. These have led to heightened intensity of rent-seeking activities, inertia, lack of customer care, <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedures,</b> general dearth of professionalism, and considerable delays in the delivery of services...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} answer a {{seemingly}} intractable question in English human rights law: how should we understand the nature, constituent elements and application of a human right to enabled suicide? A moral framework is developed, based on the theories of Alan Gewirth and Deryck Beyleveld, in order to critique the approach to such a right in English law. The thesis argues that current approaches have failed to articulate the status of this right fully, in particular as regards the balance between its exercise {{and the protection of}} the right to life of others. Thus, the thesis seeks to use Gewirthian theory to defend an alternative understanding of the human right to enabled suicide. This ethically justified right is used to resolve the intractable questions of human rights law that, it is argued, have undermined the legal response to the right to enabled suicide thus far. Specifically, the thesis will address the problem of a slippery slope resulting from possible <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> <b>procedures</b> designed to give effect to the right. The thesis will also consider the defensibility of apparent inconsistency between English laws prohibiting assisted suicide and laws regulating different courses of ‘suicidal’ conduct such as refusal of vital treatments and ‘life-shortening’ treatment. The thesis will not claim that there is one ideal form of human rights-compliant legal response to these questions, but it will seek to justify certain minimal requirements of a Gewirthian conception of a human right to enabled suicide. The original and significant contribution of this thesis to knowledge is therefore the development of a detailed framework to govern the balance between the right to enabled suicide and the countervailing right to life, and the application of this framework to English law on assisted suicide and voluntary euthanasia...|$|E

40|$|This paper shows, using {{a history}} based methodology, the {{differences}} between the “people’s initiative procedures” or “progressive model” and the “authoritative body-initiative procedures” or “plebiscitary model” — two structural models for recall procedure. These two heuristic models will be inferred, respectively, by the recall procedures adopted in the U. S., starting from 1903, and the recall procedures adopted in some States of Europe, starting from the Weimar constitution of 1919. The political-constitutional reasons behind the evident structural differences (“bottom-up” and “top-down” procedures) will be explained by providing an historical reconstruction about the genesis of the idea of “the recall” in the first American constitutionalism (the “Antifederalist recall”). Then the political idea behind the “progressive model” will be considered with special attention paid to the Swiss direct democracy influence {{on the development of the}} American socialists idea of the recall. The other model will be contextualized by focusing on the constitutional debate of the Germany around the late 19 th and the early 20 th century. The <b>abuse</b> <b>of</b> both <b>procedures</b> will be presented in two recent cases <b>of</b> tested recall <b>procedures,</b> California and Romania. Both leaded to similar results.

40|$|The {{declaration}} {{of a state}} of emergency can be a legitimate constitutional method to take prompt measures in protecting the interests of the society in times of crises threatening the life of the nation. But as it entails restrictions on the fundamental rights of the citizens, it must be used with utmost care and as a means of last resort only. The objective {{of this paper is to}} examine whether it has been justifiable to deprive the citizens of Bangladesh from the enjoyment of all or majority of the 18 fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution during the continuance of the five emergencies invoked for dealing with 'internal disturbance'.

After the passage of the bill, the current political climate appears to require sixty votes for the passage of any major legislation, a practice which many argue is unsustainable. In this Debate, Professors Josh Chafetz and Michael Gerhardt debate the constitutionality of the Senate’s cloture rules by looking to the history of those rules in the United States and elsewhere. Professor Chafetz argues that the cloture rules represent an unconstitutional principle of entrenchment and highlights the absurdity by analogizing to a hypothetical rule requiring a supermajority to unseat an incumbent senator, which would surely not be tolerated. Chafetz concludes that historical practice fails to justify obstructionist tactics and that any constitutionally conscientious senator has a duty to reject the filibuster as it currently operates. Professor Gerhardt attributes the Senate’s behavior to the lack of a majority committed to curtailing <b>abuses</b> <b>of</b> Senate <b>procedure.</b> He argues that the weaknesses of the traditional arguments against the filibuster underscore the filibuster’s inherent constitutionality. Gerhardt points out that a majority of Senate seats is never subject to election {{at the same time and}} that the Constitution does not forbid, but instead expressly permits, the Senate to draft internal procedures. Failing to find an anti-entrenchment principle implied in the constitutional scheme, Gerhardt groups the filibuster with other Senate traditions - such as holds and bitter partisanship - and finds that the solution to unsatisfactory behavior in the legislature is, and always has been, accountability at the ballot box...|$|R
