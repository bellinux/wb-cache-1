25|$|As part of {{the move}} to Frostbite, BioWare decided to unite the combat systems of the single and {{multiplayer}} modes. In Mass Effect 3, the single-player mode used a system tailored to a slower, cover shooter approach while the multiplayer mode used a system tailored to a faster-paced approach. It was important to BioWare that, for all gameplay modes in Mass Effect: Andromeda, the player stay moving and have a strategy behind every action as opposed to remaining in one location for the entire duration of an encounter. To encourage players to play this way, BioWare built open combat layouts, which required the programming of complex artificial intelligence so that enemies could understand space <b>and</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> flank the player from all angles.|$|E

25|$|If {{you wish}} you may tell the police {{to be careful not}} to rile me. Of course, I am a {{reasonable}} spirit. I take no offense at the way they have conducted their investigations in the past. In fact, they have been so utterly stupid as to not only amuse me, but His Satanic Majesty, Francis Josef, etc. But tell them to beware. Let them not try to discover what I am, for it were better that they were never born than to incur the wrath of the Axeman. I don't think there is any need of such a warning, for I feel sure the police will always dodge me, as they have in the past. They are wise <b>and</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> keep away from all harm.|$|E
25|$|Statement {{measures}} tend {{to comprise}} more words, and hence consume more research instrument space, than lexical measures. Respondents are asked {{the extent to}} which they, for example, Talk to a lot of different people at parties or Often feel uncomfortable around others. While some statement-based measures of extraversion/introversion have similarly acceptable psychometric properties in North American populations to lexical measures, their generally emic development makes them less suited to use in other populations. For example, statements asking about talkativeness in parties are hard to answer meaningfully by those who do not attend parties, as Americans are assumed to do. Moreover, the sometimes colloquial North American language of statements makes them less suited to use outside America. For instance, statements like Keep in the background <b>and</b> <b>Know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> captivate people are sometimes hard for non-native English-speakers to understand except in a literal sense.|$|E
25|$|The late 20th century {{saw another}} period of {{domestic}} upheaval {{with the military}} coup known as the Carnation Revolution. Eventually military rule gave way to Portugal's transition to democracy which led to Portugal's entry into the European Union in 1986. Admission into the EU has had an immense impact on the Portuguese wine industry. In order to comply with EU standards, many of the country's monopolistic legislation that unfairly benefited co-operatives were overturned. Smaller growers and wine producers received {{millions of dollars of}} subsidies and grants from the EU to improve their vineyards and winemaking facilities. The stability brought by democracy and the European Union also encouraged more foreign investments, which brought expansions and upgrades of winemaking technology <b>and</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> Portugal. The Portuguese appellation system of Denominação de Origem Controlada (DOC) was also upgraded to be more in line with its French, Italian and Spanish counterparts.|$|E

[...] Lajoie said, [...] "He {{was one of the}} greatest fellows I ever knew, both as a baseball player and as a gentleman."

500|$|Vanger is {{a wealthy}} {{businessman}} who launches an extensive investigation into his family's affairs. Despite calling the Vanger family [...] "dysfunctional", Plummer {{said of the}} character: [...] "I love {{the character of the}} old man, and I sympathize with him. He's really the nicest old guy in the whole book. Everybody is a bit suspect, and still are at the end. Old Vanger has a nice straight line, and he gets his wish." [...] Plummer wanted to imbue the character with irony, an element he found to be absent from the novel's Henrik. [...] "I think that the old man would have it," [...] he opined, [...] "because he's a very sophisticated old guy [...] used to a great deal of power. So in dealing with people, he would be very good [...] he would be quite jokey, <b>and</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> seduce them." ...|$|E
500|$|Lin {{acknowledged}} the expectations and warned, [...] "I won't be an All-Star this year." [...] He was {{appreciative of the}} support, especially from the Asian-American community, but he preferred to concentrate on his play without all the attention when he had not [...] "proven anything to anybody". Smart saw that Lin was skilled at getting to the paint, but needed to learn to pass because, he said, Lin [...] "couldn't shoot the ball at all". The coach also noticed that Lin always arrived early for practice and left late. Lin studied and rehearsed Steve Nash's and other top point guards' pick-and-roll plays. Frank Hughes of Sports Illustrated wrote that Lin spoke with the occasional [...] "seeds of self-doubt", which he said was uncommon to hear in the NBA. Hughes also found it rare when Lin compared himself to the Phoenix Suns' then-backup point guard Goran Dragić. [...] "Neither of us is a freak athlete, but we're both effective <b>and</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> play the game," [...] Lin said. Lin and Stephen Curry, the 2009–10 runner-up Rookie of the Year, received more interview requests than any other Warrior. Team officials regularly denied requests for Lin to help him keep his focus. He was approached {{to be the subject}} of documentaries. Smart planned to take pressure off Lin since Lin had a tendency to be hard on himself and get frustrated, but the coach admitted that he once succumbed to the home crowd's wishes and put Lin into a game in the wrong situation.|$|E

Gladwell cites Mark Alpert as a prototypical Maven who is [...] "almost pathologically helpful", further adding, [...] "he can't help himself". In this vein, Alpert himself concedes, [...] "A Maven is {{someone who wants to}} solve other people's problems, generally by solving his own". According to Gladwell, Mavens start [...] "word-of-mouth epidemics" [...] due to their knowledge, social skills, and ability to communicate. As Gladwell states: [...] "Mavens are really information brokers, sharing and trading what they know".|$|E
2500|$|Chimpanzees {{exhibit a}} variety of population-specific tool use: termite-fishing, ant-fishing, ant-dipping, nut-cracking, and leaf-sponging. Gombe Chimpanzees fish for {{termites}} using small, thin sticks, but chimpanzees in Western Africa use large sticks to break holes in mounds and use their hands to scoop up termites. [...] Some of this variation {{may be the result}} of [...] "environmental shaping" [...] (there is more rainfall in western Africa, softening termite mounds and making them easier to break apart, than in the Gombe reserve in eastern Africa). Nevertheless, it is clear that chimpanzees are good at emulation learning. Chimpanzee children independently know how to roll over logs, <b>and</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> eat insects. [...] When children see their mothers rolling over logs to eat the insects beneath, they quickly learn to do the same. In other words, this form of learning builds on activities the children already know.|$|E

Ringer said of his role, [...] "My {{goal is to make}} sure I keep {{producing}} each chance I get and try to make sure I am being productive, And just continue to do what I can to get better." [...] Titans head coach Jeff Fisher said of Ringer [...] "He's got great run skills and he's in good shape, He's got a sense and a knack for pushing the ball north and south. Again we just finished the first day in pads, and he's probably had 10 reps, so we still have some time." [...] Ringer also said [...] "I am definitely doing a lot of watching, Different things that they do is the reason why they're successful in the NFL, so I am kind of watching and learning and seeing how they go about their business. ... I am asking questions and they've been very helpful with me." [...] Teammate Chris Johnson said of the other backs, [...] "Basically if you have the talent to make it here, you pretty much know how to read a defense <b>and</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> run a ball, So there are not a lot of things I can tell him as far as how to run the ball. ...
