40|$|The present article {{aimed to}} present a {{standardized}} protocol {{for the production of}} a chewable test material that has been used in masticatory efficiency and performance studies. This chewable material has advantages in respect to its physical properties when compared to other artificial and natural test foods. It is constituted by mixing condensation silicon (58. 3 % by weight), common plaster (10. 2 % by weight), alginate (12. 5 % by weight), solid vaseline (11. 5 % by weight), tooth paste (7. 5 % by weight), and catalyst paste (20. 8 mg/g), adding also three drops of mint essence. The mixed material is then inserted into an <b>acrylic</b> <b>mould</b> with perforations of 12 mm in diameter and 5 mm in height to produce rounded tablets with those measures after polymerization. It was named "Optocal - Brazilian version". A volume of 3 cm 3 is indicated for a chewing test, which corresponds to 12 tablets using the present methodology. The present protocol can make the production of this chewable material easier, helping in its standardization for studies on masticatory function...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to test the {{hypothesis}} that bonding to caries-affected dentin would yield strengths that are lower than bond strengths achievable when bonded to normal dentin. Dentin-bonding systems used in this study were fourth and fifth generation as well as self-etching primers. Materials and Methods: Forty-eight freshly extracted mandibular and maxillary molars were selected of which 24 were caries-affected teeth and the remaining were noncarious teeth. Random sampling was done with eight teeth in each group based on the bonding system used. In caries-affected teeth, the soft, stainable, caries-infected dentin was excavated using a caries detector dye whereas the hard, caries-affected, nonstainable dentin was retained. All the teeth were subsequently mounted in a suitable <b>acrylic</b> <b>mould.</b> Prepared teeth were restored with a single composite resin, using three different dentin bonding systems. These prepared specimens were transferred to a Hounsfield tensometer to measure the shear bond strength. The results obtained were analyzed using Anova, Student&#x 2032;s unpaired t-test, and Student Neuman Keulis test. Results: The results showed that the self-etching primer required the highest mean shear load compared to the fifth and fourth generation dentin-bonding systems in both normal dentin and caries-affected dentin. Conclusion: Bond strength to dentin depends on whether the dentinal tubule is open or occluded. Within the limitations of this study, it was observed that bond strength to caries-affected dentin was low compared to normal dentin...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} whether violet-laser diode (VLD) can be used as light-curing source. The ultimate (micro-) tensile strength (μTS) of three adhesives was determined when cured by VLD in comparison with curing by two different types of commercial LED light-curing units. One VLD (VLM 500) and two LED units (Curenos and G-Light Prima) were used to cure the adhesive resin of the two-step self-etch adhesives Clearfil SE Bond, Tokuso Mac Bond II, and FL-Bond II. A 0. 6 -mm thick <b>acrylic</b> <b>mould</b> was filled with adhesive resin and cured for 60 s. After 24 -h water storage, specimens were trimmed into an hourglass shape with a width of 1. 2 mm at the narrowest part, after which the μTS was determined (n= 10). In addition, the light transmittance of each adhesive was characterized using a UV-vis-NIR spectrometer. No significant difference in curing efficiency between VLD and LED were observed for both Tokuso Mac Bond II and FL-Bond II (p> 0. 05). For Clearfil SE Bond, the μTS of VLD-cured specimens was higher than that of the specimens cured by the LED Curenos unit (p< 0. 05). Spectrometry revealed that this marked difference must be attributed to a different light transmittance of Clearfil SE Bond for visible blue light versus for the lower area of UV and visible violet light. In conclusion, A GaN-based violet laser diode can be used as light-curing source to initiate polymerization of dental resins. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the Knoop microhardness (KHN) and chemical composition of high-viscous glass-ionomer cement (HVGIC) after 10 years of clinical service. MethodsSix HVGIC samples were cut from 10 -year ART restorations. The sections were embedded in <b>acrylic</b> <b>moulds</b> with their longitudinal profile exposed. KHN was determined by performing three sequences of five indentations at 10, 30, 50, 70 and 90 μm of HVGIC outer surface. For the control group (n= 6), HVGIC specimens were stored in distilled water for 24 months. Hardness measurements were taken at days 7, 30, 60, 120, 180, 360, and 720. For chemical analysis using SEM-EDX, 10 -year and control specimens were dehydrated and coated with carbon. Data were analysed using T-test and ANOVA/Tukey's test (p< 0. 05). ResultsA significant KHN increase was observed in the control group up to the 180 -day period. From this point the values stabilized and no more significant differences were found between the 10 -year and the control KHN values. No statistical differences were observed amongst the KHN from inner distances compared to the outer surface of the 10 -year HVGIC specimens. In one 10 -year specimen, SEM-images identified the transformation of HVGIC in an altered layer with no glass filler particles detectable, and raised Ca, K and P contents. ConclusionsKHN values of ten-year HVGIC specimens were similar to the control group values at 180 -day storage period. Except for one 10 -year specimen in that an altered layer could be seen, chemical composition was similar amongst the depths evaluated...|$|R

40|$|Nanofilled resin {{composites}} {{are recognized}} {{to combine the}} good mechanical strength of the hybrids and the best polish of the microfills. One of the mechanical properties {{that should be considered}} is compressive strength due to masticatory force on restoration. A resin composite is composed by organic polymer matrix, inorganic filler, coupling agent, and the initiator-accelerator system. Light activated resin composite polymerization is initiated by light cure unit. This process has complicated relationship with resin properties. One factor that can modulate the mechanical properties is exposure time therefore that should be watched the effect of exposure time on compressive strength of resin composite. For measuring the compressive strength, 5 specimens of each group were prepared in customized <b>acrylic</b> cylindrical <b>mould</b> of 8 x 4 mm and were exposured by light cure unit for 20 s, 40 s, and 60 s.

40|$|Aim: The rising {{demand for}} {{aesthetic}} adhesive restorations {{has led to}} the wide use of composites. Multilayer techniques are recommended for the success of these restorations. However, this technique of layering causes the problem of interlayer adhesion, thus supporting the influence of the oxygen-inhibited layer. This study sought to test the hypothesis that the oxygen-inhibited layer increases the shear bond strength of composite resin by allowing the resins on both sides to cross the interface and form an interdiffusion zone. Materials and Methods: A microhybrid composite resin, Charisma, and a nanofill composite resin, Solare, were used in this study. Cylindrical specimens of the composites of 5 mm diameter and 6 mm height were prepared and embedded in <b>acrylic</b> resin <b>moulds</b> after curing. Curing was done in an argon atmosphere to prevent the formation of the oxygen-inhibited layer.

The study aims were to assess the dimensional stability including thermal changes of three different denture base materials. Methods. Ninety patients were selected to construct complete dentures with different denture base materials. They were randomly divided into three groups: group 1, patients with cobalt chrome metallic base; group 2, patients with heat curing acrylic resin fabricated by injection moulding technique; and group 3, patients with denture bases fabricated by conventional heat curing acrylic resin. The dimensional changes were assessed using digital caliper. Results. After the twelfth month, injection <b>moulding</b> <b>acrylic</b> resin had significantly the highest dimensional change followed by the conventional heat curing acrylic resin. There {{were no significant differences in}} the dimensions between the three types of denture base materials at normal mouth temperature, while, after hot tea drinking at 45 °C, the dimensional change was significantly the highest in cobalt chrome metallic denture base group. Conclusion. Cobalt chrome metallic denture base has stable dimension compared to denture bases fabricated of acrylic resin but it was more affected by altered mouth temperature.

40|$|Statement of Problem: Researchers {{are often}} looking for {{appropriate}} treatments while considering esthetic aspects and health. In endodontically treated teeth afflicted with severe damage or complete {{loss of the}} coronal structure, a post is usually inserted in the root canal to provide intra-canal retention of the restorations. Therefore, it seems {{that it is necessary}} to investigate the stress distribution in the restored teeth with different post algorithms. Purpose: In this study, the effects of post geometry and its dimensions on the stress distributions and levels in the root of molar teeth repaired by post-core crown (Ceramic, Alumina and Nickel-chrome) were studied using finite element method. Materials and Method: An extracted intact mandibular second molar tooth was embedded in a cylindrical <b>acrylic</b> resin <b>mould</b> and then were sliced. The sections generated in this way were photographed and the images were transferred into the Solidworks software. After tooth modeling, Posts and crowns were designed. Then, the samples were exposed to a uniform distributed load of 240 N with the load angle of 45 degree which was applied over the occlusal area. In order to simulate the surrounding area of the tooth and also the periodontal ligament space, the bone was also modeled. Results: Numerical results revealed that in the prefabricated post restoration, there was a stress concentration in the cervical region. The maximum value of normal stress (32. 3 MPa) was seen in the parallel post with 1. 4 diameter (D 1. 4), and the minimum value (26. 7 MPa) was observed in the double tapered post (N 0. 1). It was observed that the increase in the modulus of elasticity from 100 to 300 causes an increase in normal stress from 69. 5 to 38. 5 MPa and in tensile stress from 69. 5 to 38. 5 MPa. Conclusion: Numerical analysis showed that the maximum stress concentration in post core crown restoration increased when the posts with 1. 4 mm diameter or post with double taper were used. The stress values decreased with the decrease in the post modulus of elasticity. The maximum stress in the residual dentin decreased by an increase in the post diameter. Besides, the maximum stress on the residual dentine changed irregularly by the change in the tapered post diameter. Also, it was found that crowns material did not have any considerable effect on the stress concentration...|$|R
40|$|Summary. -Up to 880 % of {{a single}} dose of methyl[14 C]methacrylate in rats is expired as 14 C 02 in 10 days (65 O % in 2 h), {{irrespective}} of the route of administration and of the specific labelling of the propylene residue of the molecule. The implications of this observation, and of the excretion of small amounts of [14 C]methylmalonate, [14 C]-succinate and probably of [14 C] 3 -hydroxyisobutyrate and 2 -formylpropionate, and {{of the formation of}} [14 C] normal, physiological metabolites that may be accounted for by anabolism both from 14 C 02 and from [14 C]acetate emergent from the citric acid cycle, are that the metabolic pathway concerned involves intermediary metabolism and relates to mitochondrial function. Present findings are discussed in relation to the imputations of a report of carcinogenic risk. METHYL METHACRYLATE and its homo-logous esters seem to be quite innocuous substances. Thus, Deichmann (1941) and Spealman et al. (1945) found that, in small laboratory animals, these substances were less acutely toxic than ethyl acetate with an s. c. LD 50 of 5000 mg/kg in rats, and that the most characteristic effects, caused by prolonged exposure to methyl methacryl-ate vapour, were degenerative changes of the liver. Chronic long-term toxicity testing of methyl methacrylate in dogs and rats by oral route (Borzelleca et al., 1964) failed to reveal an increased mortality amongst the animals, or any histological changes. The dogs were given gelatin capsules con-taining methyl methacrylate, in solution in corn oil, for a period of 2 years, in amounts equivalent to 10, 100 and 1000 - 1500 parts/ 106 in the diet, and the rats received concentrations of 6 - 7, 60 - 70 and 2000 parts / 106 in their drinking water. However, the present, widespread usage of methyl methacrylate polymer for <b>acrylic</b> sheet and <b>moulding</b> material, and a report (Singh, Lawrence and Autian, 1972) that its i. p. administration to female rats on Days 5, 10 and 15 of gestation caused haemangiomas in some of the pups, make {{a better understanding of the}} bio-logical fate of this monomer in mammals desirable...|$|R
40|$|The first {{approach}} utilises a {{thin film}} of <b>acrylic</b> that is <b>moulded</b> onto the outside of a polycarbonate substrate. It {{was found that the}} gate of the injection mould cavity must be of uniform cross section otherwise local shear heating can occur and melt the acrylic film. The injection gate must also be located entirely {{on one side of the}} mould cavity otherwise the film is punctured by the molten polycarbonate and free to float within the cavity. Any mixing of the two materials will lead to opaque components due the difference in the refractive indices. The film was found to improve the UV resistance of any component, acting as a protective buffer for the polycarbonate. A new variety of hardcoat was applied to film-backed samples to impart abrasion resistance and samples were found to outperform commercially available alternatives under recognised laboratory conditions. The film-backed samples also exhibited excellent impact resistance when impacted upon the film-face. However, similar components failed at extremely low energy levels when impacted from the non-film face because flaws in the acrylic film caused cracks to be initiated when the film was placed into tension. The level of adhesion between the film and the polycarbonate has been found to be critical and if the failure mechanism could be guaranteed, then intruder resistant glazing that could be broken from the inside in an emergency becomes a possibility. Such a product would address the identified consumer concern of being trapped in a vehicle. The second approach utilises simultaneous dual injection moulding (2 K), which has previously only been used to manufacture coloured components. A successful feasibility study was undertaken to demonstrate the concept of producing transparent components via such a process. This showed that much greater control is required for transparent applications otherwise the skin and core materials mix and opaque components are produced. The generally accepted academic principles associated with the process have been shown to be too simplistic and cannot be relied upon to guarantee good results. The ratio of viscosities of the skin and core materials appear to be more dominant than previously thought and the relative injection speeds of the two materials has a direct influence upon interfacial mixing and haze generation. It was also found that haze could be avoided if the refractive indices of the skin and core material were matched to within ± 0. 002, but this is impractical. A third area of research examined the feasibility of introducing structured glass fibres weaves into transparent components to improve rigidity. The study resulted in the construction of a transparent glass fibre pre-preg that could be moulded onto the outer surface of polycarbonate components. Flexural tests revealed that a single layer of glass fibre increased the flexural modulus of test samples by a factor of 3, whilst transparency and clarity were retained. Two patents have been filed as a direct result of this work...|$|R
