In July 1970, syndicated columnist Marquis Childs noted that Tydings' problems on the left stemmed from his support of <b>a</b> <b>crime</b> <b>bill</b> for the District of Columbia, which was perceived as repressive against African Americans. There was also criticism directed at the bill for writing into law the practices of preventive detention and no knock warrants.|$|E

This results in disaster for Wade as she is immediately fired from her lobbyist job for failing to achieve her objectives, as well as seemingly jeopardizing her political reputation.

5000|$|Following {{his visit}} to Buckingham Palace, Blair {{returned}} to Downing Street to make the formal announcement of the calling of the election. With the session of Parliament being shortened, the government needed the co-operation of the opposition parties in order to pass its legislation.

Others were drastically scaled back in order to gain the acceptance of the opposition: <b>a</b> major <b>crime</b> <b>bill</b> passed without <b>a</b> clause criminalizing [...] "incitement to religious hatred", and the proposal to allow super-casinos was passed but with a restriction that permits only one to go ahead, instead of the eight that had most recently been proposed.|$|R

5000|$|In 1992, Congress, in the {{aftermath}} of a spate of violent carjackings (including some in which the victims were murdered), passed the Federal Anti-Car Theft Act of 1992 (FACTA), the first federal carjacking law, making it <b>a</b> federal <b>crime</b> (punishable by 15 years to life imprisonment) to use a firearm to steal [...] "through force or violence or intimidation" [...] a motor vehicle that had been shipped through interstate commerce. The 1992 Act, codified at 18 U.S.C. § 2119, took effect on October 25, 1992. However, only a small number of federal prosecutions were imposed for carjacking the year after the act was enacted, in part because many federal carjacking cases were turned over to state prosecutions because they do not meet U.S. Department of Justice criteria. The Federal Death Penalty Act, part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, <b>an</b> omnibus <b>crime</b> <b>bill,</b> made sixty new federal crimes punishable by the federal death penalty; among these were the killing of a victim in the commission of carjacking.|$|R
5|$|Tierney first ran for Congress in 1994 against one-term Republican {{incumbent}} Peter G. Torkildsen, {{having won}} a competitive Democratic primary with {{a plurality of}} 33.8 percent. He ran on a platform promoting a stronger federal focus on drug abuse, federal aid to promote after-school programs, consideration of means testing for Social Security, and single-payer health care. A primary issue in the campaign was crime: Tierney criticized Torkildsen for his vote against <b>a</b> 1994 <b>crime</b> <b>bill,</b> and advocated stronger gun control, while Torkildsen criticized Tierney's positions on gun control and drug legalization. Tierney was defeated {{in the general election}} by 4%. Tierney successfully ran for Congress in 1996, defeating Torkildsen by a narrow margin and increasing his margin in a 1998 rematch. Over the next five elections, Tierney won with over 68% of the vote.

50|$|Clinton {{nonetheless}} {{was able}} to pass major legislation in 1993, including the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. Clinton supported the North American Free Trade Agreement, {{a free trade agreement}} with Canada and Mexico negotiated by President Bush but supported by many members of the Democratic Leadership Council. Despite opposition from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats, and supporters of Ross Perot, the bill passed both houses of Congress and came into force in 1994. Clinton also signed the Brady Bill, which imposed a five-day waiting period on handgun purchases, and the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which required large employers to allow their employees to take unpaid leave because of pregnancy or serious medical condition(s). In 1994, Clinton signed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, <b>a</b> major <b>crime</b> <b>bill</b> that included <b>an</b> assault weapons ban, an expanded federal death penalty, the Violence Against Women Act, and several other provisions.

How our society deals with crime is timely topic for us to examine. In the last few years there has been greater resort to demagoguery as part of the crime debate in our country. This should be disturbing to all who care about the Bill of Rights and about the fairness and integrity of the system of justice The Senate approved <b>a</b> major <b>crime</b> <b>bill</b> by <b>a</b> close vote in August, 1994.

The bill provides the death penalty for at least sixty offenses. Many crimes which previously could be punished by death only in the state courts are now punishable by death in the federal courts. The bill provides for a great deal of prison construction. Theoretically, it provides for 100, 000 police officers, although many people think in reality that only around 20, 000 will actually be put on the streets. Although nineteen assault weapons are banned, 650 semiautomatic weapons remain available for target practice, hunting and other purposes. Although Congress did not appropriate the thirty billion dollars needed to finance measures called for in the bill, it will be very expensive, and many think it is not the right approach to take with regard to crime...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} key {{findings from}} community panels about offence seriousness and how participants weighed {{the factors that}} render different offences more or less serious. The research was conducted {{as part of the}} Maximum Penalties project, a review by the Sentencing Advisory Council of the maximum penalties for 250 offences to be included in <b>a</b> new <b>Crimes</b> <b>Bill.</b> The findings indicate that community members have divergent views about the relative seriousness of offences. The judgment of offence seriousness is subjective and can be influenced by a range of factors. Judgments of offence seriousness by individual members of the community can vary according to each person’s experiences, perceptions and views. If the views of this group of respondents are representative of community thinking, it appears the community does not share a single set of common attitudes towards relative offence seriousness. However, despite the variation in attitudes to offence seriousness for some offences, there was consensus among participants that offences involving direct harms to people are considered the most serious. In particular, there was a high level of agreement among participants that offences involving the deliberate infliction of harm, sexually violent offences and sexual offences against children are among the most serious offences...|$|R
