5000|$|Dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria (also {{known as}} [...] "Reticulate <b>acropigmentation</b> of Dohi," [...] and [...] "Symmetrical {{dyschromatosis}} of the extremities") {{is a rare}} autosomally inherited dermatosis. It is characterized by progressively pigmented and depigmented macules, often mixed in a reticulate pattern, concentrated on the dorsal extremities. It presents primarily in the Japanese, but has also been found to affect individuals from Europe, India and the Caribbean.|$|E
40|$|Background. Reticulate <b>acropigmentation</b> of Kitamura (RAK) is an {{autosomal}} dominantly inherited dermatosis. Case Reports. Two {{patients are}} described with the clinical and histopathologic features of reticulate <b>acropigmentation</b> of Kitamura. Conclusions.

40|$|Background: Dohi's Reticulated <b>Acropigmentation</b> {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} dominant genodermatosis with high penetrance, characterized by small, irregular, hypo and hyperpigmented macules on the dorsal surface of the distal extremities. Case: The authors report a case of Dohi’s Reticulated <b>Acropigmentation</b> in a 61 years old female patient. The patient complained of spots on hands, feet and posteriorly face involvement since she was 7 years old. Conclusion: Dohi's Reticulated <b>Acropigmentation</b> is a rare clinical condition, which usually appear in childhood and commonly interrupt their onset before adolescence. The diagnosis is based on clinical data, physical examination and histopathological findings. The treatment is unsatisfactory and still no therapy is proposed...|$|E
40|$|A {{young girl}} {{developed}} numerous, tiny, depressed, pigmented, atrophic macules on the palmo-plantar and dorsal aspects of {{both hands and}} feet {{since the age of}} 4. Her brother also was found to have similar skin disease. The lesions were strictly confined to the hands and feet only suggesting the diagnosis of reticulate <b>acropigmentation</b> of kitamura. Its differentiating features from <b>acropigmentation</b> of Dohi and acromelanosis are described...|$|E
40|$|Dowling–Degos disease (DDD) and {{reticulate}} <b>acropigmentation</b> of Kitamura (RAK) {{are rare}} genodermatoses inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with variable penetrance. They {{are considered to}} be part of a spectrum of reticulate pigmentary dermatoses, characterized by the presence of hyperpigmented macules coalescing in a reticular fashion. The authors describe a 28 -year-old male patient having hyperpigmented macules on the axillae, neck and face, reticulate <b>acropigmentation</b> of dorsum of the hands, forearms and feet, palmar pitting, and comedo-like lesions over back. The patient showed the unique clinical as well as histopathological overlap of both the rare diseases (DDD and RAK), substantiating the hypothesis that they represent two different features of a single entity with variable phenotypic expression...|$|E
40|$|Reticulate <b>acropigmentation</b> of Kitamura (RAK) and Dowling-Degos Disease (DDD) {{are rare}} genodermatosis {{inherited}} as an autosomal dominant trait with variable penetrance. They {{are part of}} a spectrum of diseases with hyperpigmented macules coalescing in a reticular pattern, facial and palmoplantar pits, breaks in dermatoglyphics, comedo-like lesions and epidermoid cysts, and a unique histological picture of hyperpigmented digitate epidermal downgrowths. The authors describe the case of a 45 -year-old female with reticulate <b>acropigmentation</b> of the dorsa of the hands and feet, hyperpigmented macules on the axilla and around the mouth, and palmar pitting. Clinical and histological findings, together with a relevant family history, allowed the authors to consider this case an example of the rare event of an overlap RAK-DDD...|$|E

40|$|Reticulate hyperpigmentary {{disorders}} are {{a group of}} rare genetic pigmentary abnormalities which includes reticulate <b>acropigmentation</b> of Kitamura (RAPK), Dowling-Degos disease (DD), reticulate <b>acropigmentation</b> of Dohi (RAPD), Haber′s syndrome, and Galli-Galli disease. A 25 -year-old male presented with asymptomatic dark-colored lesions {{on his hands and}} feet with light-colored skin lesions involving the trunk since three years. Dermatological examination revealed hyperpigmented macules in a reticulate pattern involving the dorsa of the hands and feet, front and sides of the neck, axillae, periorbital region, and groin. Multiple pits were present over both palms, with breaks in dermatoglyphics. He also had multiple nonacne facial scars predominantly on the nose and malar areas. The patient had overlapping features of RAPK and DDD. In addition, he also had hypopigmented macules and acneiform facial scars. Such an overlap of features of reticulate pigmentation has not been previously reported in the literature...|$|E
40|$|Dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria (DSH) {{is a rare}} {{autosomal}} dominant genodermatosis, presenting in infancy or early childhood with areas of hyperpigmentation on dorsa of hands and feet. DSH has been reported mainly from Japan and only limited cases have been reported from other countries. This is the first report of an Iranian patient with this rare type of <b>acropigmentation.</b> Our patient&#x 2032;s family history was striking with the same disorder in her grandmother, mother, uncle and her two older sisters which reveal an {{autosomal dominant}} pattern of inheritance...|$|E

40|$|Dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria (DSH) is an {{autosomal}} dominant skin disorder. It is also called “reticulate <b>acropigmentation</b> of Dohi” or “symmetric dyschromatosis of the extremities”. The DSH locus {{has recently been}} mapped to chromosome 1 q 21 and pathogenic mutations were identified in the DSRAD gene encoding double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase in Japanese patients with DSH. We report here two novel point mutations, Q 513 X(1537 C>T) and R 916 W(2746 C>T) in the DSRAD gene identified in two Chinese families, respectively. These data suggest that mutations in DSRAD were also associated with DSH in Chinese. This is the first report on DSRAD as the causative gene of DSH in the Chinese population...|$|E
40|$|Reticulated {{pigmentation}} is {{a unique}} pigmentary change caused by a heterogeneous group of hereditary and acquired disorders. This pigmentation {{is characterized by a}} mottled appearance, with lesions that vary in size and pigmentary content. This review discusses the hereditary group of the reticulated pigmentation disorders, such as dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria, dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria, and reticulate <b>acropigmentation</b> of Kitamura. The clinical presentation and histopathological features often overlap, making diagnosis difficult. However, each of these hereditary conditions possesses a unique genetic mutation, and genetic analysis is thus more useful in the diagnosis of these conditions. This article delivers an update regarding the clinical features, detailed histopathological description, and genetic information concerning hereditary reticulate pigmentary disorders and aims to provide useful background for use by clinical dermatologists and histopathologists when approaching this group of hereditary disorders...|$|E

40|$|Dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria (DSH) (also called “reticulate <b>acropigmentation</b> of Dohi”) is a {{pigmentary}} genodermatosis of {{autosomal dominant}} inheritance. We have clarified {{for the first}} time four pathological mutations of the double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase gene (ADAR 1 or DSRAD) in four DSH pedigrees. In this paper, we report 16 novel mutations containing six missense substitutions (p. V 906 F, p. K 1003 R, p. G 1007 R, p. C 1036 S, p. S 1064 F, p. R 1078 C), two splice site mutations (IVS 2 + 2 T>G, IVS 8 + 2 T>A), six frameshift mutations (p. H 216 fs, p. K 433 fs, p. G 507 fs, p. P 727 fs, p. V 955 fs, p. K 1201 fs), and two nonsense mutations (p. R 426 X, p. Q 600 X) found in Japanese patients with DSH. We did not establish any clear correlation between the clinical phenotypes and the genotypes of ADAR 1 gene mutations in our examination of 16 cases plus four pedigrees. None of the different mutations identified in our studies of 20 cases suggested any founder effect. Furthermore, we did not identify any mutations in the ADAR 1 gene of three patients with dyschromatosis universalis hereditaria or three patients with acropigmentatio reticularis, indicating that the two diseases are completely different from DSH, although they have sometimes been suggested to be phenotypical variations of DSH...|$|E
