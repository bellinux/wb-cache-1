5|$|Andy Webster (b. 1982), footballer & Scotland {{international}} (22 caps to date) – {{grew up and}} {{was educated}} in Arbroath, prior to his departing for clubs further <b>afield,</b> and his parents still reside in the town. He captained Dundee United to Scottish Cup victory in May 2010.|$|E
5|$|Given {{that the}} {{matching}} vocabulary and astronomical content {{is drawn from}} throughout Polynesia, far <b>afield</b> from Easter Island, this supports the argument that rongorongo was not a recent, localized development; rather it {{was a product of}} thriving Polynesian trade and cultural interaction throughout the Pacific. There is additional evidence in favor of this theory, such as the identification of Polaris among the glyphs, which is only visible from the northern hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Highway 7 is an {{important}} trade and travel route linking Saskatoon with several of its bedroom communities such as Delisle and Vanscoy, as well as larger centres farther <b>afield</b> such as Rosetown and Kindersley. Its primary use, however, is by travelers heading for Calgary, Alberta and the Canadian west coast.|$|E
5|$|Potbelly sculptures are {{distributed}} along the Pacific slope of southern Mesoamerica from Chiapas in Mexico, through Guatemala to El Salvador, {{as well as}} in the Guatemalan highlands. A few examples have been found further <b>afield</b> in the Maya lowlands of Guatemala and Honduras. A ceramic potbelly figure was found as far away as Colha in northern Belize and has been dated to c.880600 BC, in the Middle Preclassic.|$|E
5|$|Some {{fragments}} of the priory travelled further <b>afield.</b> At Hardwick Hall near Sedgefield, a mock ruin was built incorporating sculptured stones brought from the priory. The priory's wealth became the stuff of local legends, one of which claimed an underground passage led from the priory to a cave under the hills in which a raven stood guard over a chest of gold.|$|E
5|$|The Grand National {{is always}} a major event for bookmakers, {{particularly}} in the United Kingdom. An estimated £300million in bets {{were said to have}} been placed on the 2011 race, including some from as far <b>afield</b> as Australia, Bermuda and Kazakhstan, with British troops in Afghanistan also joining in. It is estimated that nearly half of the adult population of the UK bets on the Grand National.|$|E
5|$|The Salvation Army served over 100,000meals and {{provided}} over 100,000ponchos, gloves, hard hats, and knee pads to rescue workers. Local residents and those from further <b>afield</b> {{responded to the}} requests for blood donations. Of the over 9,000units of blood donated 131units were used; the rest were stored in blood banks.|$|E
5|$|The {{significance}} of medieval Islamic science has been debated by historians. The traditionalist view holds that it lacked innovation, and was mainly important for handing on ancient knowledge to medieval Europe. The revisionist view holds that it constituted a scientific revolution. Whatever the case, science flourished {{across a wide}} area around the Mediterranean and further <b>afield,</b> for several centuries, {{in a wide range}} of institutions.|$|E
5|$|Aberdeen {{have rarely}} {{played in the}} same {{division}} as their geographically closest rivals: Peterhead, Brechin City, Montrose, Arbroath, Elgin City, and Forfar Athletic, so rivalries have tended to come from further <b>afield.</b> Currently, Aberdeen have a minor rivalry with Inverness Caley Thistle, {{due to the fact}} both Aberdeen and Inverness are the two largest settlements in the north of Scotland. This is known as the North derby and has arisen since Inverness were first promoted to the SPL in 2004.|$|E
5|$|After Paradise Interchange, the busway passes under Darley Road, {{then over}} the Torrens {{for the last}} time. The terrain becomes steeper as the busway {{proceeds}} up along the outflow creek and past the northwestern side of the Hope Valley Reservoir. It proceeds north under Grand Junction Road, then swings east and north again to enter {{the eastern side of}} the Tea Tree Plaza shopping centre precinct, where the guided busway ends at Tea Tree Plaza Interchange. Most buses continue on normal roads to service suburbs further <b>afield.</b>|$|E
5|$|Almost {{half of the}} {{economically}} active population of Frome commute to work outside the town (in Bath, Bristol, Warminster, Westbury or further <b>afield).</b> About 2,700 people commute into the town. A substantial part of the workforce has no formal qualifications and is poorly skilled, leaving them vulnerable {{to a decline in}} manufacturing work. There is no major local government employment in the town, and the principal public sector employers are the Primary Care Trust and the schools.|$|E
5|$|As part {{of their}} regular {{training}} activities, F/A-18 Hornets operate {{in different parts of}} Australia and the Asia-Pacific region. Regular deployments are made to Singapore and RMAF Butterworth in Malaysia as part of Integrated Air Defence System exercises. In addition, RAAF F/A-18s have participated in exercises in the Philippines, Thailand and the United States. These deployments have seen Australian fighter squadrons range as far <b>afield</b> as Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska, where they took part in Red Flag – Alaska exercises in 2008 and 2011.|$|E
5|$|Both {{species are}} nocturnal migrants. Most corn crakes migrate through Egypt, with smaller numbers {{crossing}} {{at the western}} end of the Mediterranean. It has been recorded in most countries between its breeding and wintering ranges, including much of west Africa, and those parts of southern Asia that lie between the east of the breeding range and Africa. Further <b>afield,</b> it has been recorded as a vagrant to Sri Lanka, Vietnam and Australia, the Seychelles, Bermuda, Canada, the United States, Greenland, and the North Atlantic islands.|$|E
5|$|Chetham's {{offers a}} year-round {{programme}} of concerts within the School grounds, in venues within Manchester including Manchester Cathedral, the Royal Northern College of Music, Band on the Wall, Bridgewater Hall and further <b>afield.</b> Regular recitals {{take place in}} churches and community spaces across Greater Manchester, and occasionally in London, at major festivals and internationally. Its senior ensembles include Chetham's Symphony Orchestra and Big Band, alongside many individual students, have won awards for their music, and many alumni have progressed to highly successful careers as professional musicians or in other sectors.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, the {{purchasing}} power of Byzantine merchants became such that it could influence prices in markets as far <b>afield</b> as Cairo and Alexandria. In reflection of their success, emperors gave merchants the right to become members of the Senate, that is to integrate themselves with the ruling elite. This had an end {{by the end of}} the eleventh century when political machinations allowed the landed aristocracy to secure the throne for a century and more. Following that phase, however, the enterprising merchants bounced back and wielded real clout during the time of the Third Crusade.|$|E
5|$|Focused only several {{kilometres}} {{below the}} surface, the earthquake resulted in significant shaking {{over a large}} portion of central-eastern South Island. Maximum ground motions registered at VIII (severe) on the Mercalli intensity scale in Christchurch, while strong shaking (MM VI) was felt in adjacent populated areas such as Rolleston and Lincoln. The landforms of Sumner recorded intensified shaking due to the effects of its topographic setting. Widespread lighter motions were observed throughout much of the remaining region, with slight property damage reported from as far <b>afield</b> as Dunedin. The earthquake was felt as far away as New Plymouth and Invercargill.|$|E
5|$|Further <b>afield,</b> {{the club}} has a rivalry with Bristol City, known as the Severnside derby, {{and to a lesser}} extent, Bristol Rovers. There is also a lesser rivalry with Welsh {{neighbours}} Newport County due to the proximity of the two Welsh cities. However, they have rarely played against each another since the 1980s due to Cardiff being in higher leagues. In total they have only ever played 20 football league games against each other. A survey by Football Fans Census in 2003 saw Swansea, Bristol City and Newport listed as Cardiff's main three rivalries, with Stoke City matching Newport in third.|$|E
5|$|It {{became the}} market centre {{for the area}} and also drew traders from further <b>afield</b> to its four annual fairs (now reduced to two). Cattle drovers {{bringing}} cattle, horses and sheep from Northumbria and Scotland regularly came to the town. The original cattle market was by the church, but sheep were sold on High Street until {{the early part of}} the 20th century. With the arrival of the railway the mart was built close to the station, but this later closed and today the cattle market is held in Applegarth Court.|$|E
5|$|Like {{all members}} of its family, the Pacific swift feeds {{exclusively}} on insects caught in flight. It tends to hunt higher than most of its relatives other than the white-throated needletail. The Pacific swift has a large population and extensive breeding area, and faces few threats from predators or human activities. It is classed as being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It has occurred as far <b>afield</b> as the US and New Zealand, {{and it is a}} very rare vagrant in Europe, where it has been recorded in Denmark, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the architects}} {{training}} and working in Douglas's office were influenced by him. Perhaps {{the best known of}} these were Edmund Kirby and Edward Ould. Kirby is best remembered for his Roman Catholic churches. Ould went on to design a number of buildings in Chester and further <b>afield</b> in a Douglas-like style, including notably Wightwick Manor and various buildings at Port Sunlight. Other architects who did not work in his office were also influenced by him; these include Thomas Lockwood, Richard Thomas Beckett, Howard Hignett, A. E. Powers, James Strong and the Cheshire County Architect, Henry Beswick.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Syrrhaptes {{are found in the}} steppes of central Asia. Their range extends from the Caspian Sea through {{southern}} Siberia, Tibet and Mongolia to northern and central China. They are normally resident, but Pallas's sandgrouse can be locally migratory and very occasionally is irruptive, appearing in areas well outside its normal range. This happened in 1863 and 1888, and a major irruption took place in 1908 when many birds were seen as far <b>afield</b> as Ireland and the United Kingdom where they bred in Yorkshire and Moray.|$|E
5|$|Selwood and Geelong {{finished}} {{the season with}} a 19-3 win-loss record to qualify for the finals series in second position on the ladder. Following consecutive wins against Hawthorn in the Qualifying Final and West Coast in the Preliminary Final, Geelong progressed through to the Grand Final against Collingwood. Selwood's performance in the final, during which he gathered a team-high 28disposals, laid 7tackles, and kicked 2goals, were recognised as he placed runner-up in Norm Smith Medal voting for the adjudicated best <b>afield</b> player. Geelong defeated Collingwood to record a 38point victory and earn Selwood his third premiership medallion in five seasons.|$|E
5|$|The Highlanders' {{franchise}} area {{consists of}} the region controlled by the North Otago, Otago and Southland Rugby Unions. Both Otago and Southland compete in the semi-professional ITM Cup (formerly the Air New Zealand Cup), and North Otago in the amateur Heartland Championship. However, given Otago and Southland's lack of success in the ITM Cup, the Highlanders have often looked further <b>afield</b> to sign players from. This {{is a reflection of}} Otago's historically large influx of people from distant lands during the early settlement period, particularly from the Celtic countries of Scotland and Ireland.|$|E
5|$|The {{fire spread}} {{quickly in the}} high wind and, by mid-morning on Sunday, people {{abandoned}} attempts at extinguishing it and fled. The moving human mass and their bundles and carts made the lanes impassable for firemen and carriages. Pepys took a coach back into the city from Whitehall, but only reached St Paul's Cathedral before {{he had to get}} out and walk. Pedestrians with handcarts and goods were still on the move away from the fire, heavily weighed down. The parish churches not directly threatened were filling up with furniture and valuables, which soon had to be moved further <b>afield.</b>|$|E
5|$|The idea of {{conveying}} {{a message}} through a periodically updated clock found an earlier {{expression in the}} Doomsday Clock. However, the innovation of the National Debt Clock was to feature a constantly running counter; it has since inspired similar projects elsewhere, both in the United States and further <b>afield.</b> In particular, {{it has become a}} national fixture shows that the U.S.'s increasing debt. By 1995, the New York Times reported that politicians were citing the clock to advocate for a reduction to the national budget. Various tracking counters of national debt are also kept online.|$|E
5|$|The league {{was formed}} in 1889 as the Birmingham & District League to cater for teams in Birmingham and the {{surrounding}} area, but soon became established {{as one of the}} strongest leagues outside the Football League itself, with teams from as far <b>afield</b> as Bristol and Wales taking part. After the Second World War it absorbed the rival Birmingham Combination to become firmly established as the leading league in the area, but a gradual decline in its status began in the late 1950s and it now operates at a much lower level than in its heyday.|$|E
5|$|The seas around Gibraltar {{continued}} to be dangerous {{for decades to come}} as Barbary pirate raids continued; although a small squadron of Spanish galleys was based at the port to counter pirate raids, it proved to be of limited effectiveness and many inhabitants were abducted and sold into slavery by the pirates. The problem worsened significantly after 1606, when Spain expelled the Moriscos;– Muslims who had converted to Christianity. Many of the expellees were evacuated to North Africa via Gibraltar but ended up joining the pirate fleets, either as Christian slaves or reconverted Muslims, and raided as far <b>afield</b> as Cornwall.|$|E
5|$|US Internet also {{provides}} wired fiber optic connections that were available, as of April 2014, to around 12,600 residents of Minneapolis. Connections ran {{as quickly as}} one Gbps for $99 per month, about half {{the price of a}} 25 Mbps connection from Comcast. Later that year, the company announced plans to bring its internet services farther <b>afield</b> to the broader Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area and nationally. US Internet announced in December of the same year that it would bring 10 Gbit/s service to Minneapolis making it the first municipality in the world to have access at that speed.|$|E
5|$|With {{the gradual}} {{growth of the}} {{electrification}} of the inner London suburban lines after 1915, the class tended to be used on stopping trains on the LSWR main line, and on services to Guildford and Reading. After {{the formation of the}} Southern Railway in 1923 the class gradually began to be used, further <b>afield,</b> notably in the west of England, but also on branch lines in Kent, and on the former South Eastern and Chatham Railway line between Redhill and Reading.|$|E
5|$|Wood has {{traditionally}} been used for fuel, especially in rural areas. In less developed nations {{it may be the}} only fuel available and collecting firewood is often a time consuming task as it becomes necessary to travel further and further <b>afield</b> in the search for fuel. It is often burned inefficiently on an open fire. In more developed countries other fuels are available and burning wood is a choice rather than a necessity. Modern wood-burning stoves are very fuel efficient and new products such as wood pellets are available to burn.|$|E
5|$|As {{a naturalist}} {{he had a}} great curiosity, observing the geography, geology, plants, animals, birds, reptiles, {{amphibians}} and fish around him and recording what he saw and heard about. He wrote acclaimed books including British Zoology, the History of Quadrupeds, Arctic Zoology and Indian Zoology although he never travelled further <b>afield</b> than continental Europe. He knew and maintained correspondence with many of the scientific figures of his day. His books influenced the writings of Samuel Johnson. As an antiquarian, he amassed a considerable collection of art and other works, largely selected for their scientific interest. Many of these works are now housed at the National Library of Wales.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2009 AFL season, Selwood was {{appointed}} to the club's seven-man leadership group at just 20years of age. After the 2008 Grand Final loss ended Geelong's previous season, Selwood and his teammates began their 2009 campaign by capturing the pre-season NAB Cup {{for the second time in}} four years. Selwood's 33disposals, 11clearances, and 2goals earned him the Michael Tuck Medal as the player adjudged best <b>afield</b> in this final. In round five, Selwood made his 50th senior appearance, setting a new VFL/AFL record for the highest percentage of wins inside 50games. His involvement in 46victories set a winning percentage of 92 percent. In addition, Selwood's 50th appearance coincided with the club's own record-setting effort for the most successful 50game stretch in VFL/AFL history. Geelong had won 47 out of 50games—Selwood had been involved in 46—eclipsing Essendon's return of 46wins and 4losses during their dominant stretch during the 1999–2001 seasons.|$|E
5|$|Blackcaps {{and other}} small birds are {{illegally}} trapped and hunted in large numbers in Mediterranean countries, particularly in Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Malta, Libya, Egypt and Cyprus, where they are considered as a delicacy. Despite hunting and natural hazards, the European population of the blackcap has been rising for several decades as the range extends northwards, for example to Scotland and Denmark. There are occasional nesting records from outside the main range, such as in northern Israel and the Faroes, and wandering birds may appear further <b>afield</b> in Iceland or on the islands of Arctic Russia. In the Baltic, {{the spread of the}} blackcap appears to have been helped by the availability of territories formerly occupied by the declining barred warbler.|$|E
5|$|Douglas {{designed}} some 500 buildings. He {{built at}} least 40new churches or chapels, restored, altered or made additions {{to many other}} churches, and designed fittings and furniture for the interiors of churches. He designed new houses, altered or made additions to others, and built various structures associated with those houses. Douglas's works also included farms, shops, offices, hotels, a hospital, drinking fountains, clocks, schools, public baths, a library, a bridge, an obelisk, cheese factories, and public conveniences. As his office was in Chester, most of his works were in Cheshire and North Wales, although some were further <b>afield,</b> in Lancashire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Scotland.|$|E
