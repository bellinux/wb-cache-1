5|$|Authors Lisa R. Baba, Jacqueline M. McGrath, and Jiexin Liu {{examined}} use of vibration {{delivery to}} infants to mitigate pain while doing heel stick procedures in a 2010 {{article for the}} Journal of Perinatal & Neonatal Nursing. Their sample size included 20 babies of age 35 weeks or more, and they tracked their subjects' levels of pain on the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale while giving mechanical vibration to alleviate discomfort for a heel stick procedure. Vibration was delivered using the Magic Wand, which they bought through Vibratex. They set the Magic Wand to the highest setting <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the heel of the infant for five seconds before administering the heel stick procedure. Their results found that oscillation sensations delivered to newborns who had previously had discomfort from neonatal heel pricks were able to deliver some relief. They wrote that additional research was indicated {{in the form of}} a randomized clinical trial with a greater sample size of newborns.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} {{was for the}} NWA World Heavyweight Championship, in which {{defending}} champion, Jeff Jarrett, fought Kevin Nash. During the match, since Jarrett couldn't use his trademark guitar, Jarrett used a similar instrument, a cello. Jarrett went to hit Nash with the cello, however it broke before he could swing it. Later, Nash grabbed the broken cello <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the canvass. He then followed by lifting up Jarrett onto his shoulders and dropping him onto the cello to perform what he dubbed the Jackknife Powerbomb. While lifting Jarrett, Nash accidentally knocked out the referee, according to the script. With the referee unconscious, no one could count the pinfall. Monty Sopp then made his debut in TNA and attacked Nash, {{which led to a}} fight between the two. After the conclusion to the brawl, referee's tried to remove Sopp from the ringside area. Sean Waltman then made his debut in TNA and attacked Jarrett, which also led to a fight between them. A while later the match came to an end, when Jarrett hit Nash in the groin, grabbed him, and tripped him, which caused him to fall and force his face into the canvass, which completed Jarrett's finishing maneuver the Stroke. Jarrett then covered Nash for the pinfall victory and to retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.|$|E

He dipped his finger in the blood and sprinkled it towards the Holy of Holies seven times, dipping once for each sprinkling.|$|E

25|$|Oral {{tradition}} {{indicates that}} Pohick Church was {{targeted by the}} British during the War of 1812 for its association with George Washington. One of the parishioners had carved a wooden dove, gilded it, <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> Washington's former pew, although some accounts state instead that it was affixed to the pulpit. According to the story, the sculpture was decapitated by a British soldier who also removed its wings, and was then thrown into the church courtyard, whence it was later retrieved. It was returned {{to the family of}} the sculptor, a Mr. Bowie, and passed down among his descendants before being returned to the congregation in 1988. Currently it is on display in the parish house of the church. Otherwise, it is recorded that the interior of the building remained largely intact until the time of the American Civil War.|$|E
25|$|The {{story in}} the Vishnu Purana goes that Durvasa, while {{wandering}} the earth {{in a state of}} ecstasy due to a vow he was observing, came by a Vidyadhari(a nymph of the air) and demanded of her a heavenly wreath of flowers she was wearing. The nymph respectfully gave the garland to the sage, whereupon he wore it on his brow. Resuming his wanderings, the sage came across Indra riding his elephant, Airavata, attended by the gods. Durvasa, still in his state of frenzy, threw the garland at Indra, who caught it <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> Airavata's head. The elephant was irritated by the fragrance of the nectar in the flowers, so it threw the garland to the ground with its trunk. Durvasa was enraged to see his gift treated so callously and cursed Indra that he would be cast down from his position of dominion over the three worlds, just as the garland was cast down. Indra immediately begged Durvasa's forgiveness, but the sage refused to retract or even soften his curse and went on his way. Because of the curse, Indra and the devas were diminished in strength and shorn of their lustre. Seizing this opportunity, the asuras led by Bali waged war against the gods. The gods were routed and turned to Brahma for help. Brahma directed them to seek refuge with Vishnu. Vishnu in turn, advised them to call a truce with the asuras and work together with them to churn the ocean of milk and obtain the Amrita (nectar of immortality), on the pretext of sharing it with them. Vishnu promised that he would ensure only the devas drank the Nectar and obtained immortality so they could once again defeat the asuras. The devas took Vishnu's advice and called their truce with the asuras and thus did the gods and demons begin planning their great enterprise.|$|E

Billboard magazine praised it as [...] "a strong blues item wrapped up in his usual powerful style and a great beat". However, [...] "Heartbreak Hotel" [...] was less-than-warmly received by the British music press. The New Musical Express wrote that, [...] "If you appreciate good singing, I don't suppose you'll manage to hear this disc all through".

The shark nearly sank the boat before Schleisser killed it with a broken oar. When he opened the shark's belly, he removed a [...] "suspicious fleshy material and bones" [...] that took up [...] "about two-thirds of a milk crate" [...] and [...] "together weighed fifteen pounds."

500|$|In October 1904, Smith {{traveled}} to the Winyah Sanitarium in Asheville, North Carolina for treatment of his worsening cough, a result of advanced tuberculosis. George E. Smith died at the sanitarium on February 1, 1905. His death was attributed to [...] "shattering of his nerves", instead of tuberculosis, due to his habit of never showing emotion. Smith was interred in Union Dale Cemetery in Pittsburgh, {{a short distance from}} his childhood home in Allegheny. His funeral occurred on February 5 during a snowstorm and was attended by many people. He was entombed in a stone mausoleum that reportedly cost $30,000 to build and was built to Smith's specifications seven years before his death. His mother later commissioned a statue in his likeness <b>and</b> <b>placed</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> top of the mausoleum.

500|$|In 1873 W.J. Maxwell and H.G.

The waterfall became known as [...] "Hell's Rapids", as the torrents break onto razor sharp rocks. Dr. Bliss, Mr. Maxwell and the other engineers recorded their names and the year on [...] "Maxwell's Column", a great limestone pillar some [...] from the entrance.

500|$|After her divorce, Victoria went to {{live with}} her mother at Coburg and at her house in the French Riviera. She and Ernst shared custody of Elisabeth, who spent six months of each year with each parent. Elisabeth blamed Victoria for the divorce and Victoria had a {{difficult}} time reconnecting with her daughter. Ernst wrote in his memoirs that Elisabeth hid under a sofa, crying, before one visit to her mother. Ernst assured the child that her mother loved her too. Elisabeth responded, [...] "Mama says she loves me, but you do love me." [...] Ernst remained silent and didn't correct the child's impression. Elisabeth died at age eight and a half of typhoid fever during a November 1903 visit to Tsar Nicholas II and his family at their Polish hunting lodge. The doctor advised the Tsar's family to notify the child's mother of her illness, but the Tsarina delayed in sending a telegram.

The piece premiered at the BBC Proms on August 27, 2010. Sara Bareilles covered the song as part of Billboards [...] "Mashup Mondays" [...] and performed it as part of her set list on the 2010 Lilith Fair Tour. As stated by a critic writing for the magazine, Bareilles put [...] "a piano-pop" [...] twist on [...] "Single Ladies" [...] and turned it [...] "into a slow, jazzy track, complete with creeping bassline and vocal harmonies".
