Devices with supported readers allow users to log in through fingerprint recognition. Credentials are stored locally and protected using asymmetric encryption.|$|E

5|$|The Octopus card uses {{encryption}} for all airborne {{communication and}} performs mutual <b>authentication</b> between {{the card and}} reader based on the ISO 9798-2 three-pass mutual <b>authentication</b> protocol. In other words, data communications are only established when the card and reader have mutually authenticated based on a shared secret access key. This means that {{the security of the}} Octopus card system would be jeopardized should the access key be exposed. A stolen Octopus card reader could be used with stolen Octopus software, for example, to add value (up to HK$1,000) to any Octopus card without authorization. Nevertheless, as of 2003, the Octopus card and system have never been successfully hacked.|$|E

40|$|Automated {{recognition}} of individuals {{can be performed}} using biometrics without any requirement of explicit knowledge of a PIN or a password. On the one side biometrics has given convenience to citizens as {{they do not need}} to memorize a bunch of passwords, but on the other side intra (inter) class variations within (between) biometric features makes biometric <b>authentications</b> untrustworthy. Therefore, decisions based on biometric <b>authentications</b> are made more reliable by using several biometric <b>authentications</b> performed on single or multiple biometric modalities (i. e. multi-biometric fusion). This paper describes a method to identify if a person tries to re-enrol him/herself in a database, when he/she is already enrolled. This is referred to as duplicate check. In this work, duplicate check is performed using two modalities: face and iris. The templates used during the duplicate check are compliant to the ISO/IEC 24745 - Biometric information protection. Such templates are known as protected biometric templates. The protected biometric templates used in this work are generated using the recently published irreversible transformation based on Bloom filters. Scores are calculated from face and iris Bloom filters based templates by comparison with their respective enrolment templates using the normalized Hamming distance. As a decision of the duplicate check, these scores from both modalities are fused with appropriate weighting factors in order to get improved performance compared to using single individual modalities. The presented scheme is experimentally validated using two public benchmark databases namely the LFW and the CASIA-Iris-Thousand databases for face and iris respectively...|$|R
