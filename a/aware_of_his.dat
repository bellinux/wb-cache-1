5|$|Hensley {{continued}} to travel around Tennessee, receiving a mixed reception {{from those who}} were <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> past. Some who knew him were willing to forgive him and welcome him back in a ministerial role, but he remained estranged from most of his family. His son Roscoe saw him preach in 1944. The younger Hensley was also a pastor by then, but had never seen his father conduct a service.|$|E
5|$|In August 1808, Wellesley {{entered the}} Peninsular War, landing at Mondego Bay, north of Lisbon, with 13,000–15,000 men. Just {{three weeks after}} landing, Wellesley {{defeated}} the French at the Battle of Vimeiro. <b>Aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> weak position, French général de division (divisional general) Junot called for an armistice and negotiations began which lead to the Convention of Cintra and his army's withdrawal from Portugal.|$|E

5|$|Hemingway's {{marriage}} to Hadley deteriorated {{as he was}} working on The Sun Also Rises. In early 1926, Hadley became <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> affair with Pfeiffer, who came to Pamplona with them that July. On their return to Paris, Hadley asked for a separation; in November she formally requested a divorce. They split their possessions while Hadley accepted Hemingway's offer of the proceeds from The Sun Also Rises. The couple were divorced in January 1927, and Hemingway married Pfeiffer in May.|$|E

6000|$|She looked pointedly at Rainiharo as she spoke, and {{the prime}} {{minister}} winced, for he had lately discovered that his own son was among the number of the [...] "praying people."

5|$|In {{order to}} show the {{differences}} between communication styles, Rosenberg started to use two animals. Violent communication was represented by the carnivorous Jackal {{as a symbol of}} aggression and especially dominance. The herbivorous Giraffe on the other hand, represented his NVC strategy. The Giraffe was chosen as symbol for NVC as its long neck is supposed to show the clear-sighted speaker, being <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> fellow speakers' reactions; and because the Giraffe has a large heart, representing the compassionate side of NVC. In his courses he tended to use these animals {{in order to make the}} differences in communication clearer to the audience.|$|E

The next morning, Lord Commander Jeor Mormont tells Jon that he is <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> attempt at desertion. Nevertheless, he orders Jon to join him in an expedition beyond the Wall, intended to counter the threat of the wildlings and the White Walkers, and to find the missing First Ranger, Benjen Stark.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{during his}} college tour, Chapman {{mentioned}} that a television audience member {{had written to}} the Pythons to complain about them having a gay member, adding that the Bible said any man who lies with a man should be taken out and stoned. With other Pythons already <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> sexual orientation, Idle jokingly replied that they had found the perpetrator and killed him. Both Sherlock and Tomiczek remained a constant in Chapman's life. In the mid-1980s, having resettled in Britain, the three moved to Maidstone, Kent.|$|E

Her father (Toshiro Mifune) is <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> daughter's affair with Hallsworth and does not disapprove. Hallsworth receives word of the invasion by the North Koreans, and he travels north in an attempt to locate his wife with the assistance of army sergeant August Henderson (Richard Roundtree). Henderson encounters Hallsworth's wife and fixes her vehicle's battery, and then reunites her with her husband.|$|E
5|$|These {{provisions}} covered both Cartledge-like {{situations and}} {{cases where the}} injured party, while <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> injuries, does not connect them to the true cause until {{more than three years}} after the injuries were sustained. The act had a limited retrospective effect - it covered injuries that had happened before the Act came into force if an action had not been brought. If a judgment had already been made in a case, the Act could not apply to it, meaning the Act actually had no effect on the Cartledge case itself.|$|E
5|$|A {{majority}} of the Privy Council {{moved out of the}} Tower before switching their allegiance. Becoming <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> colleagues' change of mind, Jane's father, the Duke of Suffolk, abandoned his command of the fortress and proclaimed Mary I on nearby Tower Hill. After he had left, his wife was told she could also go home, while Jane, Guildford, and the Duchess of Northumberland were not allowed to. Jane was later moved from the royal apartments to the Gentleman Gaoler's lodgings and Guildford was imprisoned in the Bell Tower. There he was soon joined by his brother, Robert. His remaining brothers were imprisoned in other towers, as was his father, who was for the moment the only prominent person to go to the scaffold; Mary was prepared to spare Jane's and Guildford's lives.|$|E

The paper envisaged a boycott from Rangers fans, similar to that experienced in Merseyside by the English edition of the paper by Liverpool F.C. fans after coverage of the Hillsborough Tragedy. The Sun had been made <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> blog posts titled 'The Incubator'.|$|R
5|$|As a mother, Lady Rosebery was {{presented}} with a dilemma: she was in fact already practically a mother to her husband who had no great feeling for a proximity to small babies. This was particularly evident in June 1880 when shortly {{after the birth of}} their first child Sybil, Rosebery wished to visit Germany for three months, to take a cure at a German spa (he was recovering from what is now thought to have been a nervous breakdown). His wife dutifully accompanied him. However, Rosebery, clearly <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> wife's frustrated maternal instincts, reported that Hannah savoured every detail of the daily letters from London concerning the baby, and that she never complained at the forced separation.|$|E
5|$|Both the soprano part, {{which covers}} two octaves and {{requires}} a high C, and the solo trumpet part, which at times trades melodic lines with the soprano {{on an equal}} basis, are extremely virtuosic. The Bach scholar Alfred Dürr assumes that Bach had an unusually gifted singer, adding that a female voice was unlikely in conservative Leipzig. According to Joshua Rifkin Christoph Nichelmann is a possible candidate because Bach being <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> capabilities accepted him willingly to the Thomasschule and Nichelmann matriculated into the school {{three weeks before the}} first performance. The trumpet part was probably written for Gottfried Reiche, Bach's principal trumpeter at the time. The scoring is unique in Bach's cantatas, but was frequently used by Italian composers such as Alessandro Scarlatti. Bach's son Friedemann Bach arranged the work by adding a second trumpet and timpani.|$|E
5|$|Dean {{was taken}} to a local police {{headquarters}} and kept in a cage overnight. North Korean troops were initially not <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> identity. Dean {{was taken to}} a prison camp in Suwon where he was given food and medical treatment, but he began suffering from diarrhea and dysentery. Dean was then transported to the main North Korean prisoner of war camp in Seoul with other American prisoners. He attempted to keep his identity a secret but he was quickly recognized by a South Korean administrator who had worked under him before the war. Dean was moved to P'yongyang and given a larger living quarters in an underground North Korean facility. He remained sick owing to poorly prepared food.|$|E

5|$|Having gained {{prestige}} {{from the}} constructions in the Loggia, Cairano {{received at least}} two commissions from the nobility of Brescia. Involved in {{the leadership of the}} new administration, they were certainly <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ability. There are papers dating back to 1496 that document Cairano's commission for the Tomb of Gaspare Brunelli, which, in 1500, was placed in the Brunelli chapel within the Church of St Francis. During the same period, the Caprioli family commissioned the tomb of Luigi Caprioli to be placed within their chapel in the church of San Giorgio, probably together with other sculptures, made probably in collaboration with the Sanmicheli workshop, to which is attributed the marble jamb decorated with candelabras.|$|E
5|$|He spreads poison {{and kills}} much {{livestock}} and many Frenchmen {{to prepare for}} an uprising, but is forced into exile as the French become <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> actions and begin to search for him. He returns after four years, but is captured and tied to a post to be lashed and burned {{in front of a}} massive black audience. While tied to the post, he metamorphoses into an insect and flies overhead before landing in the crowds. During the ensuing pandemonium he is again captured by ten men and burned in the fire. The slaves are certain that he has been saved and remain in defiant and jubilant spirits. The memory of Macandal is not extinguished in the flames. Ti Noel tells his children the stories he was told by Macandal, and they await his return many years later.|$|E
5|$|Kratos {{enters the}} Desert of Lost Souls, and Athena tells him Pandora's Box is {{hidden in a}} temple chained {{to the back of}} the Titan Cronos—a {{punishment}} by Zeus for Cronos' role in the Great War. Kratos summons Cronos, climbs for three days before reaching the Temple entrance, overcomes an array of deadly traps and an army of monsters, and eventually finds the Box. But Ares, <b>aware</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> former servant's success, kills Kratos as the latter is leaving the Temple. While harpies take the Box to Ares, Kratos falls into the Underworld. He battles his way through the fiery realm, and with help from the mysterious gravedigger, who tells him Athena is not the only god watching over him, he escapes and returns to Athens.|$|E
60|$|Gudrun paddled almost imperceptibly.

60|$|He obeyed {{the impulse}} to follow, and moved down the path, {{just out of reach}} of observation, he fancied.

It had been so long since he had mingled with a holiday company, he {{appeared}} as self-conscious as a boy.|$|R
