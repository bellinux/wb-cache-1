50|$|Lyle D. Goodhue (September 30, 1903 - September 18, 1981) was {{an internationally}} known inventor, {{research}} chemist and entomologist with 105 U. S. and 25 foreign patents. He invented the “aerosol bomb” (also {{known as the}} “bug bomb”), which was credited with saving {{the lives of many}} thousands of soldiers during World War II by dispensing malaria mosquito-killing liquid insecticides as a mist from small containers. The Bug Bomb became especially important to the war effort after the Philippines fell in 1942, when it was reported that malaria had played a major part in the defeat of American and British forces. After the war, this invention gave birth to a new international billion-dollar <b>aerosol</b> <b>industry.</b> A broad variety of consumer products ranging from cleaners and paints to hair spray and food have since been packaged in aerosol containers. Goodhue's other patents involved insect, bird and animal repellents; herbicides; nematocides; insecticides and other pesticides.|$|E
40|$|Source {{apportionment}} of PM 10 and PM 2. 5 samples {{collected in}} an industrial area of the Po Valley was performed by using the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model and a semiempirical calculation of five macro-source contributions. Samples were collected during four monitoring periods, January-February 2011, June 2012, January-February 2012, May-June 2012, {{resulting in a total}} of 720 samples (360 for PM 10 and 360 for PM 2. 5). PMF variables included major elements, ions, elemental carbon and organic compounds and minor and trace elements. In order to increase the selectivity of minor and trace elements as source tracers, a chemical fractionation methodology based on the elemental solubility was employed; it was thus possible to include the extractable, the residual or both thefractions of the minor and trace elements in the database. PMF resolved six factors for PM 10 (crustal matter, marine <b>aerosol,</b> <b>industry,</b> secondary/oil combustion, secondary nitrate/biomass burning/exhaust particles, brake/tyre wear/re-suspended road dust) and seven factors for PM 2. 5 (crustal matter, marine <b>aerosol,</b> <b>industry,</b> secondary nitrate, biomass burning, other secondary components, secondary sulphate/oil combustion). Mixing properties of the lower atmosphere were monitored by using natural radioactivity. The lack in the separation of some sources was shown to be due to their co-variation during periods of high atmospheric stability in the cold months. Seasonal variations of the source contributions were evaluated and discussed. PMF results were compared with those obtained by a semiempirical calculation method in which analytical results are grouped into five macro-sources (crustal matter, marine aerosol, secondary inorganic compounds, combustion products from vehicular emissions and organics). Although similar trends in the temporal variation of the main PM sources were obtained, the absolute magnitude of the concentrations varied in some cases, especially for crustal matter and marine aerosol sources...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to estimate aerosol sources using aerosol particle tracers. Identification of pollution sources includes receptor-modeling techniques based on the concentrations of aerosol components at a receptor site. Statistical methods such as Principal Component Analysis and Positive Matrix Factorization were employed to apportion sources of ambient particulate matter. In order to obtain quantitative source contributions Absolute Principal Component Analysis, APCA was performed. The experimental part of this work was devided in three parts: 1. Source apportionment of fine and coarse aerosol in the Athens Metropolitan area Two aerosol-sampling campaigns were conducted during March 2002 - December 2002 at three sites in the Athens Metropolitan area, during the cold and warm period. PM 10 and PM 2. 1 samples were collected simultaneously over a 24 h period. Black carbon concentrations (BC) were concurrently measured by means of an aethalometer. After gravimetric analysis the loaded PTFE membrane filters were subjected to microwave acid digestion and analysed for Cd, Pb, V, Ni, Mn, Cr, Cu, Fe, Al, Ca, Mg, K, and Na by atomic absorption spectrometry. In two out of three sites the water-soluble SO 4 2 - was also determined by ion chromatography. The main results of this study were: • Fine particles contributed to total particle mass about 70 % • There was not found any seasonal variation for metals nad water soluble • Cd, Pb, V, Ni, Cr, Cu and K showed diurnal variation with their maximum concentrations when traffic peaks • SO 4 2 - ions showed maximum concentrations during noon • Comparing the two models PCA and PMF, PMF was proved to be a useful tool in source apportionment studies • Sources of fine particulate matter were road dust, vehicles emissions, biomass burning, marine aerosol and oil combustion • Sources of coarse particles were road dust, soil and marine aerosol • Traffic through vehicles emissions and resuspension of road dust was the major contributor to particle mass levels 2. Trace metals concentrations in particulate matter in the urban site of Volos Aerosol sampling was performed over 24 h periods during May-October 2003 at the city of Volos in Central Greece. The size distributions of 7 Be, aerosol mass and trace metals were measured simultaneously using a six-stage Andersen cascade impactor. The obtained results were: • The most important aerosol sources were soil, marine <b>aerosol,</b> <b>industry</b> and motor vehicles • PCA and APCA could not clearly identify and quantify aerosol sources • PMF identified satisfactorily aerosol sources • Comparing aerosol sources in Volos and Athens the industrial activity was proved to be a significant source only in the case of Volos • 7 Be activity concentration displayed negative correlation with aerosol mass concentration and against concentrations of most of the determined metals 3. Metallic tracers concentrations in TSP for the period 1980 - 2004 TSP samples that cover the period 1980. 2004 were analysed in order to determine 11 metals, Cd, Pb, V, Ni, Cr, Mn, Cu, Fe, Ca, Mg and K. The pollution sources were estimated by means of PCA and PMF. • Pb showed a clear decenting trend • Pb, V and Ni, emitted by anthropogenic sources showed maximum concentrations during the warm season. Cr and Cu showed similar trend. • PCA was implemented in two different periods 1980 - 1990 and 1991 - 2004 but the obtained results were similar. The major aerosol sources for the period 1980 - 2004 were vehicles, oil combustion, soil and industry • PMF model resolved different sources for these periods. The first period 1980 - 1990 was characterized by motor vehicle emissions, road dust, soil and oil combustion while in the period 1991 - 2004 oil combustion, road dust and soil were the identified sources. • Pb could not be used as a tracer for motor vehicles emissions due to the comlete phase out of leaded petrol...|$|E

40|$|Very high {{concentration}} of suspended particulate matter (SPM) is observed at traffic junctions in India. Factor analysis-multiple regression (FA-MR), a receptor modelling technique {{has been used for}} quantitative apportionment of the sources contributing to the SPM at two traffic junctions (Sakinaka and Gandhinagar) in Mumbai, India. Varimax rotated factor analysis identified (qualitative) five possible sources: road dust, vehicular emissions, marine <b>aerosols,</b> metal <b>industries</b> and coal combustion. A quantitative estimation by FA-MR model indicated that road dust contributed to 41 %, vehicular emissions to 15 %. marine aerosols to 15 %, metal industries to 6 % and coal combustion to 6 % of the SPM observed at Sakinaka traffic junction. The corresponding figures for Gandhinagar traffic junction are 33 %, 18 %. 15 % 8 % and 11 %, respectively. Due to limitation in source marker elements analysed about 16 % of the remaining SPM at these two traffic junctions could not be apportioned to any possible sources by this technique. Of the observed lead in the SPM, FA-MR apportioned 62 % to vehicular emissions, 17 % to road dust, 11 % to metal industries, 7 % to coal combustion and 3 % to marine aerosols at Gandhinagar traffic junction and about a similar apportionment for lead in SPM at Sakinaka traffic junction.

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to further advance the state of the art in {{developing}} self-sufficient methods to predict the performance of an aerosol filter. The simulation methods developed in this study are based on first principles and consequently, they do not rely on empirical correction factors. These simulation methods can be used to predict the instantaneous collection efficiency and pressure drop of a filter under dust-loading conditions. In the current study, 3 -D micro- and macroscale CFD models are developed to simulate the service life of flat-sheet and pleated filters. These CFD micro- and macroscale models are also used to quantify the effects of a fiber’s cross-sectional shape on the performance of the resulting filter. As fiber manufacturing methods are rapidly advancing, these fibers are becoming more accessible. The filtration performance of trilobal fibers is compared with their circular counterparts under dust-loading conditions. Our results show that trilobal fibers do not outperform circular ones except in very limited conditions, revealing no advantage over circular fibers. In addition, a fast but approximate 2 -D model is developed to predict the filtration performance of flat and circular pleated filters. The predictions of the model are compared with predictions from the more sophisticated CFD models, as well as with experimental work in the literature. Our 2 -D model developed in this study is aimed at providing the <b>aerosol</b> filtration <b>industry</b> with a fast but fairly accurate method of designing pleated filters. With a CPU-time of practically zero, the developed model allows one to conduct a broad parameter study, altering the parameters that affect the filtration performance of pleated filters.

These correlations allow one to estimate the instantaneous pressure drop and collection efficiency of pleated filters effectively...|$|R
40|$|This study {{deals with}} solar {{irradiance}} forecasts {{of the next}} two to three days with respect to their application in solar energy industries, such as yield prediction for the integration of the strongly fluctuating solar energy into the electricity grid. During cloud free situations, which are predominant in regions and time periods focused on by the solar energy <b>industry,</b> <b>aerosols</b> are the main atmospheric parameter which determines ground level direct and global irradiance. Therefore, for an episode of five months in Europe the accuracy of forecasts of the aerosol optical depth at 550 nm (AOD 550) based on particle forecasts of a chemistry transport model (EURAD-CTM) is analyzed in a first step. It is shown that these aerosol forecast underestimate ground-based AOD 550 measurements by a mean of - 0. 11 (RMSE 0. 20). Using these aerosol forecasts together with other remote sensing data (ground albedo, ozone) and numerical weather prediction parameters (water vapor, clouds) a prototype for an irradiance forecasting system (AFSOL) is set up. Based on the five-month aerosol dataset its results are then compared to forecasts of the ECMWF and the MM 5 model, to Meteosat- 7 satellite data and to ground measurements.

40|$|An {{extensive}} {{literature review}} of published metalworking fluid (MWF) aerosol measurement data {{was conducted to}} identify the major determinants that may affect exposure to aerosol fractions (total or inhalable, thoracic and respirable) and mass median diameters (MMDs). The identification of determinants was conducted through published studies and analysis of published measurement levels. For the latter, weighted arithmetic means (WAMs) by number of measurements were calculated and compared using analysis of variance and t-tests. The literature review found that the major factors affecting aerosol exposure levels were, primarily, decade, type of industry, operation and fluid and engineering control measures. Our analysis of total aerosol levels found a significant decline in measured levels {{from an average of}} 5. 36 mg m− 3 prior to the 1970 s and 2. 52 mg m− 3 in the 1970 s to 1. 21 mg m− 3 in the 1980 s, 0. 50 mg m− 3 in the 1990 s and 0. 55 mg m− 3 in the 2000 s. Significant declines from the 1990 s to the 2000 s also were found in thoracic fraction levels (0. 48 versus 0. 40 mg m− 3), but not for the respirable fraction. The WAMs for the auto (1. 47 mg m− 3) and auto parts manufacturing industry (1. 83 mg m− 3) were significantly higher than that for small-job machine shops (0. 68 mg m− 3). In addition, {{a significant difference in the}} thoracic WAM was found between the automotive industry (0. 46 mg m− 3) and small-job machine shops (0. 32 mg m− 3). Operation type, in particular, grinding, was a significant factor affecting the total aerosol fraction [grinding operations (1. 75 mg m− 3) versus other machining (0. 95 mg m− 3) ], but the levels associated with these operations were not statistically different for either the thoracic or the respirable fractions. Across all decades, the total aerosol fraction for straight oils (1. 49 mg m− 3) was higher than for other fluid types (soluble[*]=[*] 1. 08 mg m− 3, synthetic[*]=[*] 0. 52 mg m− 3 and semisynthetic[*]=[*] 0. 50 mg m− 3). Fluid type was also found to be partly associated with differences in the respirable fraction level. We found that the total aerosols were measured by a variety of sampling media, devices and analytical methods. This diversity of approaches makes interpretation of the study results difficult. In conclusion, both the literature review and the measurement data analyzed found that decade and type of industry, operation and fluid were important determinants of total <b>aerosol</b> exposure. <b>Industry</b> type and fluid type were associated with differences in exposure to the thoracic and respirable fraction levels, respectively...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} aims at {{identifying}} and apportioning fine aerosols to their major sources in Paris (France) – {{the second most}} populated "larger urban zone" in Europe – and determining their geographical origins. It {{is based on the}} daily chemical composition of PM 2. 5 examined over 1 year at an urban background site of Paris (Bressi et al., 2013). Positive matrix factorization (EPA PMF 3. 0) was used to identify and apportion fine aerosols to their sources; bootstrapping was performed to determine the adequate number of PMF factors, and statistics (root mean square error, coefficient of determination, etc.) were examined to better model PM 2. 5 mass and chemical components. Potential source contribution function (PSCF) and conditional probability function (CPF) allowed the geographical origins of the sources to be assessed; special attention was paid to implement suitable weighting functions. Seven factors, namely ammonium sulfate (A. S.) -rich factor, ammonium nitrate (A. N.) -rich factor, heavy oil combustion, road traffic, biomass burning, marine <b>aerosols</b> and metal <b>industry,</b> were identified; a detailed discussion of their chemical characteristics is reported. They contribute 27, 24, 17, 14, 12, 6 and 1 % of PM 2. 5 mass (14. 7 μg m − 3) respectively on the annual average; their seasonal variability is discussed. The A. S. - and A. N. -rich factors have undergone mid- or long-range transport from continental Europe; heavy oil combustion mainly stems from northern France and the English Channel, whereas road traffic and biomass burning are primarily locally emitted. Therefore, on average more than half of PM 2. 5 mass measured in the city of Paris is due to mid- or long-range transport of secondary aerosols stemming from continental Europe, whereas local sources only contribute a quarter of the annual averaged mass. These results imply that fine-aerosol abatement policies conducted at the local scale may not be sufficient to notably reduce PM 2. 5 levels at urban background sites in Paris, suggesting instead more coordinated strategies amongst neighbouring countries. Similar conclusions might be drawn in other continental urban background sites given the transboundary nature of PM 2. 5 pollution...|$|R

40|$|Foshan {{is a major}} {{international}} ceramic center and the most polluted city in the Pearl River Delta (PRD). Here we present {{the results of the}} first long-term PM 2. 5 (particles b 2. 5 mu m) sampling and chemical characterization study of the city. A total of 2774 samples were collected at six sites from 2008 to 2014, and analyzed for water soluble species, elements and carbonaceous species. The major constituents of PM 2. 5 were sulfate, OC (Organic Carbon), nitrate, ammonium and EC (Elemental Carbon), which accounted for 50 %- 88 % of PM 2. 5. PM 2. 5 and the most abundant chemical species decreased from 2008 to 2011, but rebounded in 2012 - 2013. After 2008, the chemical composition of PM 2. 5 changed dramatically due to the implementation of pollution control measures. From 2008 to 2011, SO 42 - and NO 3 - were the two largest components; subsequently, however, OC was the largest component. The respective contributions of SO 42, NO 3 - and OC to the sum of water soluble species and carbonaceous species were 30. 5 %, 22. 9 % and 19. 9 % in 2008; and 20. 2 %, 16. 5 % and 30. 2 % in 2014. Distinct differences in nitrate and sulfate, and in mass ratio [NO 3 -]/[SO 42] imply that mobile sources tended to more important in Foshan during 2012 - 2014. The results indicate that pollution control measures implemented during 2008 - 2014 had a large effect on anthropogenic elements (Pb, As, Cd, Zn and Cu) and water soluble species, but little influence on crustal elements (V, Mn, Ti, Ba and Fe) and carbonaceous species. The PMF method was used for source apportionment of PM 2. 5. Industry (including the ceramic industry and coal combustion), vehicles and dust were the three most important sources and comprised 39. 2 %, 20. 0 % and 18. 4 % of PM 2. 5 in 2008, respectively. However, secondary <b>aerosols,</b> vehicles and <b>industry</b> were the three most important sources and comprised 29. 5 %, 22. 4 % and 20. 4 % of PM 2. 5 in 2014, respectively.

Industry, dust and vehicles contributed 36. 6 mu g m(- 3), 13. 9 mu g m(- 3), and 9. 2 mu g m(- 3) to the reduction of PM 2. 5, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Particulate matter (or aerosols) are {{particles}} {{suspended in}} the atmosphere. Aerosols {{are believed to be}} the most important pollutant associated with increased human mortality and morbidity. Therefore, it is important to investigate the relationship between sources of <b>aerosols</b> (such as <b>industry)</b> and the concentration of harmful aerosols at ground level. Furthermore, aerosols influence the climate system by scattering and absorbing solar radiation and by influencing cloud properties. The total climate effect of aerosols is poorly understood compared to the climate effect of greenhouse gases. Therefore, climate studies also benefit from a better understanding of aerosols. The goal of this thesis is to investigate the spatial distribution of aerosols over Europe with focus on the Netherlands. The aerosol life cycle and effects are calculated with numerical simulations. Performing numerical simulations of aerosols is very challenging, because, in contrast to gas molecules, each individual aerosol differs in size, composition and microphysical properties. Without simplifications, a model has to track each individual particle, which would take far too much computational time, even for modern supercomputers. The challenge is to design simplifications in such a way that the life cycle of aerosols and the effects of aerosols on human health and climate are still properly represented. Many model studies are supported by measurements. Both the measurements and the models can have different purposes. Using the correct combination of different models and observations is key for studies on aerosols. A different combination of models and observations is required to accomplish the different sub goals of this thesis. These sub goals are: Investigation of the aerosol life cycle over Europe Improvement of the understanding of gas-aerosol phase transition of ammonium nitrate and aerosol optics Improvement of representation of aerosols and their effects in models The life cycle of aerosols in Europe is investigated in chapter 3. The full life cycle of aerosols has been implemented in a global transport model. It is concluded that Europe is a net source of anthropogenic (man-made) aerosols and a net sink of natural aerosols. The most important sink of anthropogenic aerosols is removal by clouds and rain, while natural aerosols are removed predominantly by dry deposition processes. By comparing model results with observations, it is concluded that the largest uncertainties are caused by the parameterisation of wet removal processes and by missing emissions. In the Netherlands, emissions of nitrogen oxides and ammonia are high because of the high population density and intensive agriculture. After oxidation of nitrogen oxides to nitric acid, ammonium nitrate aerosols can be formed. This aerosol is special, because it can evaporate under warm and dry conditions and condense back to the aerosol phase under cold and moist conditions. Like the case of clouds, the phase equilibrium changes with altitude as the atmospheric temperature decreases with altitude. The phase of ammonium nitrate is poorly detected by many measurement instruments, because the gas-aerosol partitioning can change inside the instrument. Partly due to the scarcity of reliable measurements, the phase transition of ammonium nitrate is poorly implemented in large-scale models. Because ammonium nitrate aerosol and its phase transition is important for the aerosol budget of the Netherlands, this process has further been investigated in case studies. The goal of case studies is to gain detailed insight in the aerosol processes and, ultimately, to develop better parameterisations for large-scale models. These case-studies are performed with more detailed small-scale models. In these models, not the full aerosol life cycle is simulated but only the processes that are being investigated. A large advantage, however, is that these models have a higher resolution both in the spatial and the temporal domain. As a result, the important processes can be resolved more precisely. Chapter 4 presents a case study where the interaction between ammonium nitrate phase transition and mixing in the lower atmosphere (boundary layer) is investigated for a warm day in spring. During an intensive measurement campaign near the Cabauw tower in the Netherlands, measurements of ammonium nitrate have been performed. Importantly, the gas and the aerosol phases have been separated with a special instrument so that both concentrations are measured without errors due to phase transition inside the instrument. It is shown that the observed partitioning between gas and aerosol ammonium nitrate deviates significantly from the thermodynamic equilibrium. The hypothesised explanation for this mismatch is that aerosol-rich air from higher altitudes (where the aerosol phase is preferred due to lower temperatures) is transported to the surface, increasing the aerosol-phase fraction of ammonium nitrate at the surface. This implies that the thermodynamic equilibrium is not instantaneously restored at the surface. A simulation of ammonium nitrate partitioning in the boundary layer has been performed with a simplified column model. The match between model results and observations improved drastically when applying a delay timescale up to two hours for the gas-aerosol equilibrium. The interaction between turbulence and ammonium nitrate partitioning is further investigated in a more detailed model study (chapter 5). In this model, turbulent motions are explicitly resolved. As highlighted above, downward motions are associated with higher aerosol concentrations, because the phase equilibrium of ammonium nitrate is shifted towards the aerosol phase at higher altitudes. Therefore, turbulent motions induce a fluctuating concentration of aerosol ammonium nitrate with updrafts containing lower aerosol ammonium nitrate concentrations and subsidence motions containing enhanced aerosol ammonium nitrate concentrations. It is discussed that these fluctuations in observations may provide information about the speed of gas-aerosol partitioning, which is very difficult to measure directly. Throughout chapters 3 to 5, several ideas for model improvements have been posed. These ideas originate both from knowledge gained in the studies and from further challenges that are discovered. One such improvement for models is a computationally efficient and adequate representation of the optical properties of aerosols. Implementation of aerosol optics has been quite challenging, because the physics of aerosol optics is very complicated. Chapter 6 presents a package that allows easy implementation of aerosol optics in atmospheric models that represent aerosols. Aerosol modelling is a very challenging task and can be developed much further. In this thesis, important steps have been taken to improve knowledge about aerosols. Future research should proceed by unravelling remaining aerosol mysteries, such as those presented in the final chapter (7) of this thesis...|$|R
