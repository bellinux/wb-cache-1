5|$|Feminist economists <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> {{that agency}} is not {{available}} to everyone, such as children, the sick, and the frail elderly. Responsibilities for their care can compromise the agency of caregivers as well. This is a critical departure from the homo economicus model.|$|E
5|$|Discussion {{continues}} {{about the}} relative advantage or disadvantage of using the blades. Researchers and analysts <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that the research studies are done on level, stationary treadmills, and do not measure performance from starting blocks or on actual curved tracks. They also do {{not take into account}} differences in physiology between amputees and non-amputees, who have such factors as musculature, blade height and weight and differences in blood circulation patterns due to the history of their limb loss.|$|E
5|$|The {{inclusion}} of significant LGBT characters in modern speculative fiction television series {{has not been}} universal. For example, the Star Trek franchise's lack of same-sex relationships {{has long been a}} sore spot with LGBT fandom, some of whom have organised boycotts against the franchise to protest its failure to include LGBT characters. They <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that Gene Roddenberry had made statements in later life favourable to acceptance of homosexuality and the portrayal of same-sex relationships in Star Trek, but that the franchise's coverage has remained meagre.|$|E

25|$|Some {{consumers}} <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that government-enforced pasteurization law {{has been}} used as a tool for large business to shut out competition from smaller producers. See the case of the FDA's shut down of Goodflow Juice in 2008.|$|E

25|$|Funding for Tertiary Institutions {{has been}} criticised {{recently}} {{due to high}} fees and funding not keeping pace with costs or inflation. Some <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that high fees are leading to skills shortages in New Zealand as high costs discourage participation and graduating students seek well paying jobs off shore {{to pay for their}} student loans debts. As a result, education funding has been undergoing an ongoing review in recent years.|$|E
25|$|Brown consecrated Francis Schuckardt {{without a}} pontifical mandate (i.e. {{permission}} from the Pope), which is normally required by the Code of Canon Law under penalty of excommunication. However, traditionalists cite over a dozen historical instances where Bishops were legitimately consecrated {{in a period of}} sede vacante. Traditionalists <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> the superiority of the essential doctrine of Apostolic Authority over the changeable dictates of ecclesiastical law, and hold that Christ would not leave his flock without shepherds.|$|E
25|$|The authors <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> {{that the}} study's {{assessments}} strongly {{agree with the}} conclusions of earlier studies conducted by faculty at West Point, the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA), and the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA). All four studies concluded that the program suffered from multiple problems in its creation and implementation, which inhibited {{the effectiveness of the}} teams in the field. Yet, all agree that a high majority of commanders were extremely supportive of the teams and found them effective.|$|E

25|$|Critics during Sage’s {{lifetime}} frequently compared {{her work}} {{to that of}} Tanguy, who was better known, and usually assumed that, when their work had features in common, those features must have originated with him. More recent feminist scholars have stated that the influence more likely was mutual—what Judith Suther calls “a constant, usually unconscious interchange.” Suther and others <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> {{differences between the two}} artists: for example, the large architectural constructions that dominate Sage’s paintings are quite unlike the smaller biomorphic or metallic forms that people Tanguy’s landscapes.|$|E
25|$|Marlovians (as {{those who}} {{subscribe}} to the theory are usually called) base their argument on supposed anomalies surrounding Marlowe's reported death and on the significant influence which, according to most scholars, Marlowe's works had on those of Shakespeare. They <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> the coincidence that, despite their having been born only two months apart, {{the first time the}} name William Shakespeare is known to have been connected with any literary work whatsoever was with the publication of Venus and Adonis just a week or two after the apparent death of Marlowe.|$|E
25|$|Commentators <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that, {{even if the}} ruling's Lochner era legal {{analysis}} is appropriate and correctly applied, Mackay Radio is flawed due to the economic assumptions the Court made. Justice Roberts' opinion assumed perfect competition in labor markets, a lack of monopsony, no statistical discrimination, no information asymmetry, market rationality, and a legal regime which provided {{a level playing field}} and equal protection under the law. Some—and possibly all—of these assumptions are incorrect. Worse, however, the Mackay Radio decision fashioned strong incentives which made it rational for one bargainer (management) to refuse to cooperate and opt out of bargaining.|$|E

25|$|The network's {{defenders}} {{note that}} the CBC's mandate differs from private media's, particularly in its focus on Canadian content; {{that much of the}} public funding actually goes to the radio networks; and that the CBC is responsible for the full cost of most of its prime-time programming, while private networks can fill up most of their prime-time schedules with American series acquired for a fraction of their production cost. CBC supporters <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that additional, long-term funding is required to provide better Canadian dramas and improved local programming to attract and sustain a strong viewership.|$|E
25|$|On the pro-terraforming {{side of the}} argument, {{there are}} those like Robert Zubrin, Martyn J. Fogg, Richard L. S. Taylor and the late Carl Sagan who {{believe that it is}} humanity's moral {{obligation}} to make other worlds suitable for life, as a continuation of the history of life transforming the environments around it on Earth. They <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that Earth would eventually be destroyed if nature takes its course, so that humanity faces a very long-term choice between terraforming other worlds or allowing all terrestrial life to become extinct. Terraforming totally barren planets, it is asserted, is not morally wrong as it does not affect any other life.|$|E
25|$|Finally, the {{relative}} {{quality of the}} x86 architecture has been discussed. Critics of the switch say that x86 was a poor choice because of its lack of hardware registers compared to the PowerPC, {{and the lack of}} AltiVec (also known as Velocity Engine). Proponents have responded by saying that the x86 architecture has evolved greatly since the original 8086 was introduced, and that CPUs in general have combined RISC and CISC philosophies in their internal designs for some time, making the distinction obsolete. They <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that improved SSE could equal AltiVec, and that most programmers rarely deal with x86's peculiarities because the compiler does the work.|$|E

25|$|This {{system was}} {{designed}} {{to act as an}} incentive for utilities to improve their performance. According to MoWI, 14 out of the 20 regional UWSSAs fall into category A, 4 are classified as B while utilities in Babati and Lindi are in category C. The results of a study by Tobias A. Swai of the University of Dar es Salaam, however, indicated that Category A UWSSAs are the least efficient although they are self-sustaining. EWURA data <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that two out of the twenty regional utilities have an operating cost coverage ratio significantly higher than one, which means that they can sustain the current service level. Seven other utilities only just manage to keep their current operations running.|$|E
25|$|The {{series has}} also {{attracted}} some criticism from other pawnbrokers, who while conceding its entertainment value, {{claim that the}} series' focus on the extravagant vintage items brought into the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop are not typical of the average pawn shop, whose business is predicated on individuals on fixed income who bring in conventional objects {{in order to pay}} their bills, such as electronics, tools and jewelry. Corey Grigson and Charles Brown, who own a shop called Pawn Stars, estimate that their average loan to a customer is between $50 and $100. They <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> appraisals are handled by the staff, who rely on experience, reference works and research, and not the outside experts who are frequently seen on the show aiding the Harrisons.|$|E
25|$|There {{are those}} that insist that because the governments of China and Taiwan {{abandoned}} their claims for monetary compensation, then the moral or legal responsibility for compensation belongs with these governments. Such critics <b>also</b> <b>point</b> <b>out</b> that even though these governments abandoned their claims, they signed treaties that recognised the transfer of Japanese colonial assets to the respective governments. Therefore, to claim that these governments received no compensation from Japan is incorrect, and they could have compensated individual victims from the proceeds of such transfers. Others dispute that Japanese colonial assets in large proportion were built or stolen with extortion or force in occupied countries, as was clearly the case with artworks collected (or stolen) by Nazis during World War II throughout Europe.|$|E
