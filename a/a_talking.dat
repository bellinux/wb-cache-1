5|$|As Jesus vs. Santa {{became more}} popular, Parker and Stone began talks of {{developing}} the short into a television series. Fox refused {{to pick up the}} series, not wanting to air a show that included the character Mr. Hankey, <b>a</b> <b>talking</b> piece of feces. The two then entered negotiations with both MTV and Comedy Central. Parker preferred the show be produced by Comedy Central, fearing that MTV would turn it into a kids show. When Comedy Central executive Doug Herzog watched the short, he commissioned for it to be developed into a series.|$|E

5|$|CGI {{special effects}} {{for the series}} were {{provided}} by The Mill. The production team wanted <b>a</b> <b>talking</b> dragon, but {{they were worried about}} the lip sync and did not think it would be believable until they saw the first test. The Mill created a software that would read Hurt's facial muscles and incorporated it into the animation. Another concern was that the eyes would not convey the character, but this was corrected by the final version. Additional sound effects, such as the clanging chain, were added to give the creature weight. The knife Mary throws at Arthur was also completely CGI, though the shot of it hitting the chair was real.|$|E

To avoid audiences mistaking A.I. for a family film, no action figures were created, although Hasbro released <b>a</b> <b>talking</b> Teddy following the film's release in June 2001.|$|E
