On 2 March 1903, {{an article in}} The Washington Post reported that Merion had run aground shortly after leaving Queenstown while en route to Liverpool from Boston. The ship was freed from her perch near Chicago Knoll by the rising tide, but when she got underway again became stuck fast in almost the same spot. <b>At</b> <b>press</b> <b>time,</b> two British Admiralty tugs had been dispatched to free the ship. Almost exactly a year later, Merion collided with the steamer Clan Grant off Tuskar Rock on 30 March 1904 and was damaged.

500|$|Little {{is known}} about West Cohass {{subsequent}} civilian career until 1925. On 20 July, The Washington Post carried a news report that West Cohas had run aground on shoals off Sable Island. The French fishing trawler Labrador had run aground on the shoals {{on the morning of}} 19 July and had issued a distress call. The nearby West Cohas steamed to her aid, but became stranded on the rocks nearby and issued her own distress call. Lifesaving crews had been dispatched but could reach neither ship because of fog and waves. <b>At</b> <b>press</b> <b>time</b> the Canadian government buoy tender and several tugs were reported on their way [...] to aid both ships. There were no follow up reports to indicate how much damage West Cohas sustained, but she escaped the fate of the [...] Labrador, which was a total loss. West Cohas had been repaired and was back in service by November 1926, when The Wall Street Journal reported that she was to begin service carrying grain from Galveston, Texas, to London.|$|E
