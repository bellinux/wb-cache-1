On short notice I was able to reconstitute my intelligence support. The first two inspection teams were dispatched to Bahrain. I was set to arrive there on the 18th. I would be joined by my deputy chief inspector {{as well as several}} operations staff. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> veteran inspectors, requiring no additional training.

We have not forgotten what Jochen Peiper wrote to us from Landsberg Prison in 1952: [...] "Don't forget that the first Europeans killed in action were in the units of the Waffen-SS, that the one beaten to death during the post war period mostly were men from our ranks. They had become fair game because of their belief in the indivisibility of Western Europe. Remember these martyrs".|$|E

500|$|Brand New's second studio {{album was}} written in [...] "the year and-a-half or two years" [...] that they were touring the {{material}} off Your Favorite Weapon. According to drummer Brian Lane, [...] "Jesse [...] wrote {{a lot of the}} lyrics about different things than 'I just broke up with my girlfriend' for the new record," [...] as Lacey had written the songs on an acoustic guitar in his bedroom. Lane also explained that the band was now influenced by a range of different artists, [...] "All of us got exposed to a lot of different music that <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> listening to. For the first [...] we weren't in such close quarters for 24 hours a day. I think that {{has a lot to do}} with it." [...] Unlike their first album, it was said that a lot of time and concentration went into making the album.|$|E
500|$|The {{third and}} final session, in the evening on 15 October, {{produced}} four more recordings that completed the album— [...] "The Way Young Lovers Do" [...] "Sweet Thing", [...] "Ballerina" [...] and [...] "Slim Slow Slider". Davis expressed to Rolling Stone {{that there was a}} [...] "certain feel about a seven-to-ten o' clock session" [...] and that [...] "the ambience of that time of day was all through everything we played". Both [...] "Sweet Thing" [...] and [...] "Ballerina" [...] were originally scheduled for the session, but the search for a 'closer' consumed a considerable amount of time. [...] They attempted (and rejected) a number of songs until Morrison suggested [...] "Slim Slow Slider". [...] "I don't think we'd ever done [...] live," [...] recalls Payne. [...] " [...] had a book full of songs... I don't know why he decided to do it...And we were first doing it with the drums, with Richard Davis and Connie Kay and the guitar player and the vibe player and me and Van— <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> playing. Then I started playing soprano sax on the thing, and Lew said, 'OK, I wanna try it again. Start again. And I want just the bass, the soprano sax, and Van.'" [...] It was a successful take, but it also came with a very long coda, prompting Merenstein to make a large cut during the editing process. Many of the tracks on Astral Weeks would be subjected to edits (mainly to tighten the performances), but the one on [...] "Slim Slow Slider" [...] was easily the most substantial. [...] "I would estimate three, five minutes of instrumental stuff," [...] says Payne. [...] "We went through stages [...] we got to be avant-garde kind of weird, which is what you hear after the splice – all that weird stuff we're playing – but there was a whole progression to that." [...] According to Merenstein, before he cut it, the coda [...] "was a long, long ending that went nowhere, that just carried on from minute to minute...If it had [...] relativity to the tune itself, I would have left it there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Those with a {{distinctive}} talent for writing sometimes create short poems, called calaveras (skulls), mocking epitaphs of friends, describing interesting habits and attitudes or funny anecdotes. This custom {{originated in the}} 18th or 19th century after a newspaper published a poem narrating a dream of a cemetery in the future, [...] "and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> dead", proceeding to read the tombstones. Newspapers dedicate calaveras to public figures, with cartoons of skeletons {{in the style of}} the famous calaveras of José Guadalupe Posada, a Mexican illustrator. Theatrical presentations of Don Juan Tenorio by José Zorrilla (1817–1893) are also traditional on this day.|$|E

I was eager to get him and the President together in hopes of bringing about a reconciliation that would benefit them personally and the Republican Party. <b>All</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> at the Broadmoor Hotel in Colorado Springs for a meeting, which I saw as an opportunity to get them together ... for dinner, but whatever undercurrent existed remained, and they continued to be cool toward each other. President Hoover was one of the great Americans of this century. He was competent, compassionate, and a man of unequaled qualifications. The country paid an awful price when he was sacrificed by political caprice.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{reaching}} the statutory retirement age, {{he was relieved}} as CINCSOUTH by Admiral Horacio Rivero, Jr. and retired from the Navy effective February 1, 1968. At his retirement ceremony at his headquarters in Naples, Italy on January 31, 1968, Griffin asserted that the relatively peaceful Soviet posture in central Europe was a tactical move to cover a thrust of naval forces into the Mediterranean, and complained that France's recent withdrawal from NATO was tantamount to freeriding off the contributions of allies who met their treaty obligations. [...] "NATO's great shield of collective security has become so broad that it even covers those who say they no longer choose to contribute to its support, giving them freedom to pursue their policy of withdrawal, secure in the knowledge that, in a showdown, they would still share the benefits of its great protection. This is obviously a game which only a few can play, for if <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> to be so foolhardy, the alliance, as an effective institution, would cease to exist. Fortunately, this fallacy has found no imitators. And we may {{hope that it will}} be short-lived." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{his tenure}} on the court, Voelker wrote over 100 opinions, both {{majority}} opinions and dissents. In 1958, he authored {{what was the}} originally the dissent in the case People v. Hildabridle. That case centered around a nudist colony near Battle Creek. Local police on their own initiative investigated the colony even though local residents had not lodged any complaints. One officer swore out a warrant used to arrest the colony members. Chief Justice John R. Dethmers wrote the original majority opinion to uphold the convictions of the nudists. In the dissent, Voelker proclaimed [...] "the entire search-and-arrest process 'indecent—indeed the one big indecency we find in this whole case .... It seems {{that we are now}} prepared to burn down the house of constitutional safeguards in order to roast a few nudists. I will have none of it." [...] In an example of the humor used in his opinions, in noting the proclivities of the nudist, [...] "if eccentricity were a crime, then <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> felons." [...] This dissenting opinion was so convincing that it swayed Justice George Clifton Edwards, Jr., one of those in the majority, to change sides, converting the dissent to a majority. On Voelker's request, his opinion was published unaltered, starting with the words [...] "I dissent", an anomaly in published majority opinions of the court. In 1962, political scientist S. Sidney Ulmer noted that Voelker was the second-most influential member of the court in his short tenure.|$|E

2500|$|... "Leftie" [...] premiered {{publicly}} in March, 1882, at {{the literary}} and musical evening of The Pushkin Circle; on April 16 {{it came out}} in book form. The collection of sketches called Pechersky Antics was written in December, and published by Kievskaya Starina, in its February and April issues. By this time a large Russian Antics cycle began to take shape, in which Leskov implemented, as he saw it, Nikolai Gogol's idea (formulated in the Selected Passages from Correspondence with Friends) of [...] "extoling modest working men." [...] "It is wrong and unworthy to pick out the worst in the soul of the Russian man, so I embarked on my own journey looking for virtuous ones. Whoever I asked would reply to the effect that they knew no such saints, and that <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were</b> sinful, but they had met some decent men... and I just started writing about them," [...] he wrote in the preface to one such story ("Singlethought", Odnodum, 1879). A similar cycle of short stories involved legends of early Christianity, with plot lines taken from the [...] "prologues" [...] and Byzantine stories of the 10th and 11th centuries. The fact that some of these pieces ("Pamphalone", [...] "Beautiful Azu") were translated into German and praised by publishers, made Leskov immensely proud. What was new to the Russian reader in them was, as Mirsky noted, [...] "a boldly outspoken treatment of sensual episodes"; some critics accused the author of [...] "treating his moral subjects as nothing but pretexts for the display of voluptuous and sensual scenes." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of Reed's sore points {{resulting}} from that unauthorized re-editing {{was that the}} [...] "heavenly wine and roses" [...] melody was cut out of [...] "Sweet Jane". In the original recording, this part was intended to provide a perfectly flowing bridge to a full-fledged plagal cadence two-chord version of the chorus (earlier choruses in the song have a 4-chord riff). In Reed's initial solo performances, he would include the verse (see for instance American Poet), until 1973, when he would routinely leave it out, as the bridge fits less well in a more hard rock version (as heard for instance on Rock 'n' Roll Animal). However, the post-Reed, Doug Yule-led Velvets always performed the song with the verse included. A career-spanning retrospective of Reed's recordings with the Velvet Underground and as a solo artist, NYC Man (The Ultimate Collection 1967–2003), which Reed compiled himself, uses the shorter version. When asked about the shortened versions of [...] "Sweet Jane" [...] and [...] "New Age" [...] and Reed's long-standing claims that they were re-edited without his consent, Yule claimed that Reed had in fact edited the songs himself. [...] "He edited it. You have to understand at the time, the motivation was... Lou was, and <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>us</b> <b>were,</b> intent on one thing {{and that was to}} be successful and what you had to do to be successful in music, was you had to have a hit, and a hit had to be uptempo, short, and with no digressions, straight ahead basically, you wanted a hook and something to feed the hook and that was it. 'Sweet Jane' was arranged just exactly the way it is on the original Loaded release exactly for that reason—to be a hit! 'Who Loves The Sun' was done exactly that way for that reason—to be a hit." ...|$|E
