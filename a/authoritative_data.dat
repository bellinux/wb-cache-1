50|$|A {{system of}} record (SOR) or source system of record (SSoR) is a data {{management}} term for an information storage system (commonly implemented {{on a computer}} system running a database management system) that is the <b>authoritative</b> <b>data</b> source for a given data element or piece of information. The need to identify systems of record can become acute in organizations where management information systems have been built by taking output data from multiple source systems, re-processing this data, and then re-presenting the result for a new business use.|$|E
50|$|Database {{users and}} {{application}} developers {{can benefit from}} an <b>authoritative</b> <b>data</b> dictionary document that catalogs the organization, contents, and conventions {{of one or more}} databases.

Another important piece of information that a data dictionary can provide is the relationship between Tables. This is sometimes referred to in Entity-Relationship diagrams, or if using Set descriptors, identifying which Sets database Tables participate in.|$|E
