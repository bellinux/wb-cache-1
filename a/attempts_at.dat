These expeditions were launched southwards from Mexico and Guatemala, and northwards from Panama and Nicaragua; their rival captains clashed in Honduras, resulting in <b>attempts</b> <b>at</b> conquest of the natives being punctuated by battles between competing Spanish forces, and infighting within individual Spanish groups. The various Spanish groups also fielded indigenous auxiliaries to support their efforts.|$|E
5|$|After {{several more}} French <b>attempts</b> <b>at</b> {{conciliation}} had failed, in September 1664 Marguerite Louise left her apartment in Palazzo Pitti, refusing to return.

5|$|Alchemists {{thought of}} mercury as the First Matter {{from which all}} metals were formed.
