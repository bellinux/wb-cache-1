5|$|Government Ambulance Service – Operating {{separately}} from (although alongside) {{the fire and}} police service of the area, these ambulances are funded by local or national government. In some countries, these only tend {{to be found in}} big cities, whereas in countries such as the United Kingdom almost all emergency ambulances are part of a nationwide system under the National Health Service.

5|$|There are differing {{levels of}} {{qualification}} that the ambulance crew may hold, from holding no formal qualification to having a fully qualified doctor on board. Most <b>ambulance</b> <b>services</b> require at least two crew members to be on every ambulance (one to drive, and one to attend the patient), although response cars may have a sole crew member, possibly backed up by another double-crewed ambulance. It {{may be the case}} that only the attendant need be qualified, and the driver might have no medical training. In some locations, an advanced life support ambulance may be crewed by one paramedic and one EMT-Basic.|$|E

5|$|The upper tier is Somerset County Council. Also {{based in}} Taunton, {{the council has}} 58 councillors, each elected for a {{single-member}} electoral division.

They are represented by one Labour and one Liberal Democrat councillor.

5|$|The village {{falls within}} the non-metropolitan {{district}} of Sedgemoor, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. It was previously part of Axbridge Rural District. Sedgemoor is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.

5|$|Another {{issue is}} using {{standardized}} technology for communication with agencies in other countries. Norway {{is a member}} of the Schengen Agreement, which requires trans-border communication between law enforcement agencies. There were 27 different networks for the police, one for each police district. In Oslo, Akershus and Østfold, the police had also been using Enhanced Digital Access Communication System since 1994. There were 230 municipal fire department radio systems, and a manual mobile phone system for the health sector. The health network was built by the county municipalities between 1990 and 1995 and covers all parts of the health service, including paramedics, <b>ambulance</b> <b>services,</b> midwives and medical doctors. The various systems had different levels of coverage. In addition, Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) and Nordic Mobile Telephone (NMT450) telephones were being used where encrypted communication was necessary.|$|E
5|$|Private Ambulance Service – Normal {{commercial}} {{companies with}} paid employees, but often on contract {{to the local}} or national government. Private companies may provide only the patient transport elements of ambulance care (i.e. nonurgent or ambulatory transport), but in some places, they are contracted to provide emergency care, or to form a 'second tier' response. In many areas private services cover all emergency transport functions and government agencies do not provide this service. Companies such as Falck, Acadian Ambulance, and American Medical Response {{are some of the}} larger companies that provide such services. These organisations may also provide services known as 'Stand-by' cover at industrial sites or at special events. From April 2011 all private <b>ambulance</b> <b>services</b> in the UK must be Care Quality Commission (CQC) registered. Private services in Canada operate non-emergency patient transfers or for private functions only.|$|E

5|$|Response unit – Also {{known as}} a fly-car or a , which is a vehicle {{which is used to}} reach an acutely ill patient quickly, and provide on scene care, but lacks the {{capacity}} to transport the patient from the scene. Response units may be backed up by an emergency ambulance which can transport the patient, or may deal with the problem on scene, with no requirement for a transport ambulance. These can be a wide variety of vehicles, from standard cars, to modified vans, motorcycles, pedal cycles, quad bikes or horses. These units can function as a vehicle for officers or supervisors (similar to a fire chief's vehicle, but for <b>ambulance</b> <b>services).</b> Fire & Rescue services in North America often staff EMTs or Paramedics to their apparatuses to provide medical care without the need to wait for an ambulance.|$|E
5|$|The route had {{doubled its}} {{patronage}} since its introduction by 1953—the {{last year it}} was operated by DNL. From 1954 the route was taken over by Widerøe, who introduced smaller Noorduyn Norseman and de Havilland Canada DHC-3 Otter aircraft. The Widerøe seaplane service was flown on behalf of DNL and later Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) and remained until 1963. Varangfly—based in Kirkenes—was established in 1959 by general aviation enthusiasts from Kirkenes Flyklubb. The airline originally had two seaplanes, a two-seat Piper J-3 Cub and a five-seat Norsk Flyindustri C-5 Polar. Operations started on 17 June 1960. The company gradually developed services within scheduled, charter and air <b>ambulance</b> <b>services.</b> Varangfly later also bought an eight-seat land aircraft which was operated to Lakselv and Bardufoss, and to Ivalo Airport in Finland, where i corresponded with Finnair's service to Helsinki.|$|E
5|$|Use of {{the airport}} area as a {{civilian}} airport was launched by Varangfly director Odd Bentzen in 1964. After visiting Iceland he proposed a series of short and simple airports in Finnmark which could serve the airline's air ambulance service. A different proposal was launched in 1966 by several of the larger airlines, including Scandinavian Airlines System, Braathens SAFE and Widerøe, to establish a network of short take-off and landing airports in rural areas; Berlevåg was one of six original proposals for Finnmark. A county committee was established in 1966 to look into building small airfields in Finnmark, including Berlevåg. In the following years the municipality made investments to allow the airfield {{to be used for}} air <b>ambulance</b> <b>services.</b> Part of the motivation was Berlevåg's poor port conditions, which often forced seaplanes to land at Kongsfjord.|$|E
