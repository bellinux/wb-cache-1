40|$|Prior {{research}} has established that TV viewing and food marketing influence children's eating behavior. However, {{the potential impact}} of popular <b>TV</b> cooking <b>shows</b> has received far less attention. <b>TV</b> cooking <b>shows</b> may equally affect children's food selection and consumption by distributing both food cues and portion-size cues. In an experimental study, elementary school children were randomly exposed to a cooking show, that either did or did not display a portion-size cue, or <b>a</b> non-food <b>TV</b> <b>show.</b> Results showed that children used significantly more sugar on their pancakes, and consumed significantly more of the pancakes after watching <b>a</b> <b>TV</b> cooking <b>show</b> compared to <b>a</b> non-food <b>TV</b> <b>show.</b> However, observing <b>a</b> portion-size cue in <b>a</b> <b>TV</b> cooking <b>show</b> only influenced sugar selection in older children (5 th grade), but not in younger children (1 st grade). The findings suggest that food cues in <b>TV</b> cooking <b>shows</b> stimulate consumption by inducing food cravings in children. Actual portion-size cues only appeared to affect older children's food selection. status: publishe...|$|R

5|$|Movie {{director}} Kevin Smith {{has been}} a fan of the Degrassi series from the early 1990s, when he worked at a convenience store in Leonardo, New Jersey. Actor Jason Mewes was his co-worker at the store and also became a fan. Every Sunday morning at work, Smith and Mewes watched episodes of Degrassi Junior High and Degrassi High on Public Broadcasting Service. Smith enjoyed the earlier series and has acknowledged an infatuation with Stacie Mistysyn. He has also paid homage to Degrassi by referring to it in several of his films. He named a Clerks character Caitlin Bree after Mistysin's Degrassi character, Caitlin Ryan, wrote Shannen Doherty's character Rene wearing a Degrassi jacket throughout his Mallrats film, and had Jason Lee's character in Chasing Amy specifically mention Degrassi Junior High as <b>a</b> <b>TV</b> <b>show</b> he wants to watch, rather than going out. Smith and Mewes guest starred as themselves in the final three episodes of the fourth season. The plot for these episodes involves the pair working on Jay and Silent Bob Go Canadian, Eh!, a fictional feature film in the View Askewniverse, using Degrassi Community School as a filming location.|$|E
