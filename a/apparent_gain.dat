6000|$|... 29. The {{position}} in the Greek mind of Hermes as the lord of cloud is, however, more mystic and ideal than {{that of any other}} deity, just on account of the constant and real presence of the cloud itself under different forms, giving rise to all kinds of minor fables. The play of the Greek imagination in this direction is so wide and complex, that I cannot give you an outline of its range in my present limits. There is first a great series of storm-legends connected with the family of the historic Æolus centralized by the story of Athamas, with his two wives, [...] "the Cloud," [...] and the [...] "White Goddess," [...] ending in that of Phrixus and Helle, and of the golden fleece (which is only the cloud-burden of Hermes Eriophoros). With this, there is the fate of Salmoneus, and the destruction of the Glaucus by his own horses; all these minor myths of storm concentrating themselves darkly into the legend of Bellerophon and the Chimæra, in which there is an under story about the vain subduing of passion and treachery, and the end of life in fading melancholy,--which, I hope, not many of you could understand even were I to show it you (the merely physical meaning of the Chimæra is the cloud of volcanic lightning connected wholly with earth-fire, but resembling the heavenly cloud in its height and its thunder). Finally, in the Æolic group, there is the legend of Sisypus, which I mean to work out thoroughly by itself; its root is in the position of Corinth as ruling the isthmus and the two seas --the Corinthean Acropolis, two thousand feet high, being the centre of the crossing currents of the winds, and of the commerce of Greece. Therefore, Athena, and the fountain-cloud Pegasus, are more closely connected with Corinth than even with Athens in their material, though not in their moral, power; and Sisyphus founds the Isthmian games in connection with a melancholy story about the sea gods; but he himself is 'kerdotos andron', the most [...] "gaining" [...] and subtle of men; who having the key of the Isthmus, becomes the type of transit, transfer, or trade, as such; and of the <b>apparent</b> <b>gain</b> from it, which is not gain; and this is the real meaning of his punishment in hell--eternal toil and recoil (the modern idol of capital being, indeed, the stone of Sisyphus with a vengeance, crushing in its recoil). But, throughout, the old ideas of the cloud power and cloud feebleness,--the deceit of its hiding,--and the emptiness of its banishing,--the Autolycus enchantment of making black seem white,--and the disappointed fury of Ixion (taking shadow for power), mingle in the moral meaning of this and its collateral legends; and give an aspect, at last, not only of foolish cunning, but of impiety or literal [...] "idolatry," [...] "imagination worship," [...] to the dreams of avarice and injustice, until this notion of atheism and insolent blindness becomes principal; and the [...] "Clouds" [...] of Aristophanes, with the personified [...] "just" [...] and [...] "unjust" [...] sayings {{in the latter part of}} the play, foreshadow, almost feature by feature, in all that they were written to mock and to chastise, the worst elements of the impious [...] "'dinos'" [...] and tumult in men's thoughts, which have followed on their avarice in the present day, making them alike forsake the laws of their ancient gods, and misapprehended or reject the true words of their existing teachers.|$|E

40|$|Puberty is {{a crucial}} period for rapid changes in bone mineral, size, geometry, and microarchitecture. The mechanostat theory postulates that {{increased}} mechanical loading will affect bone phenotype and strength during development and in later life. Individuals with cystic fibrosis(CF) have {{an increased risk of}} developing osteoporosis and fragility fractures in young adulthood, which may be caused by poor growth. The aim was to investigate whether sex and disease status modified the relationship between: 1) puberty and bone, and 2) muscle and bone. This would contribute to the understanding of how sex(malesvs. females) and disease group(CFvs. controls) alters the relationship between bone and muscle in children and adolescents as they transition through puberty and who, on a population level, differ in the prevalence of osteoporosis and risk of fracture in later life. This observational study used novel imaging and muscle assessment techniques to measure bone and muscle parameters in White Caucasian children and adolescents, aged 8 to 16 years, living in the UK, with children with CF(n= 65) and controls(n= 151). Anthropometry and pubertal status were assessed. Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, peripheral quantitative computed tomography(pQCT), high-resolution pQCT, and jumping mechanography were used to measure bone and muscle outcomes. ANCOVA with Scheffé post hoc and multiple linear regression tests were performed. Data were adjusted according to the research aims and included covariates; sex, disease group, pubertal stage, age, quadratic age, height, weight, maximum force(Fmax), and maximum power(Pmax). Data are presented as beta-coefficient(%) and p-value, with the significance level set to p< 0. 05. In height adjusted analyses, among healthy participants, females had smaller bones and lower bone density compared to males. With pubertal maturation, females had lower <b>apparent</b> <b>gains</b> in the distal and proximal total area(Tt. ArandCSA), distal cortical porosity(Ct. Po) and proximal bone strength(SSI) but higher <b>apparent</b> <b>gains</b> in distal and proximal cortical bone density(Ct. BMD,Ct. TMD,vBMD). Females had consistently lower distal total area(total CSA) and density(totalvBMD), distal trabecular density(BV/TV) and number(Tb.

With increasing muscle force(Fmax), females had higher <b>apparent</b> <b>gains</b> in total body less head bone mineral(TBLH BMC) and bone area(BA), distal total and trabecular density(totalandtrabvBMD) compared to males. In contrast, with increasing muscle power (Pmax), females had higher <b>apparent</b> <b>gains</b> in distal total and cortical densities(D 100,Ct. BMDandCt. TMD), and distal trabecular thickness(Tb.

It occurs often in biological imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography (PET) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) because of their limited spatial resolution. Although partial volume effect and spillover refer to essentially the same physical problem, it is important to distinguish the outcome of these two different effects. For partial volume effect, the apparent loss of activity in the object is distributed across adjacent voxels, which are considered outside the object, resulting in increase in activity in these voxels. This increase in activity is referred to as spillover, whereas loss in activity is referred to as partial volume loss.|$|E
