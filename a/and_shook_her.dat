25|$|On May 3, 2006, Chen {{canceled}} {{plans to}} pass through the United States on his way to Latin America. He was hoping to stop by either San Francisco or New York City to refuel and stay overnight, but the US refused his request instead limiting him to a brief refuelling stopover in Anchorage, Alaska where Chen {{would not be allowed to}} step off the plane. Chen and Taiwan saw this as a snub and led to Chen's cancellation. The trip to Latin America will continue, however, without a US stopover. The US State Department claimed that the Alaska stopover offer was consistent with its previous accommodations. However, former Taiwan president Lee Teng-hui was granted a visit to Cornell University eleven years ago. More recently, in addition, Taiwan's leaders have in general been granted permission to stopover in the United States for brief periods before continuing on to other countries. This recent American stance is interpreted by Taiwan to be an expression of the increasing irritation the United States feels towards Taiwan and Chen's seemingly pro-independence gestures. Chen attended the inauguration of Ã“scar Arias, the president of Costa Rica, one of the few countries that recognized the Republic of China at that time. Laura Bush was also present to represent U.S. president George W. Bush. Chen seized the opportunity, approached her <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> hands, while Chen's aide produced a camera immediately for an impromptu photo-op. Chen's supporters saw this act as a step forward in Taiwan's struggle for diplomatic recognition, while his detractors claimed that it was a grave breach of international etiquette and put Taiwan to shame.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, Shimabukuro {{released}} his concert CD, Live, which captures him in performance at various venues around the world: New York, Chicago, Japan, and Hawaii. It peaked at number 5 in Billboards Top World Music Albums in 2009 and 2010, won the Hoku for Instrumental Album of the Year, garnered Shimabukuro {{the award for}} Favorite Entertainer of the Year, and won the Hawaii Music Award for Best Ukulele Album. In November 2009, he accompanied fellow Hawaii-born Bette Midler at the Royal Variety Performance. They performed a rendition of the Beatles song [...] "In My Life" [...] as the first of Midler's three-song set, and afterwards they met Queen Elizabeth <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> hand.|$|E
2500|$|A similar {{performance}} {{was done at}} Brixton Academy; Madonna wore a different T-shirt, with her son Rocco and daughter Lourdes' names printed on it. Jennifer Vineyard from Rolling Stone felt that [...] "She seemed too happy to harp on anything, grinning madly as she shimmied <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> hips to the throbbing bass and pounding beats", while Miranda Sawyer from The Guardian {{thought that it was}} the best performance from the concert. Around 3,000fans attended the concert in London, which was streamed over the internet. More than nine million people watched the concert according to Nicky Price, a representative for Microsoft's MSN, the webcast's producer. It became the most-viewed webcast of all time, beating Paul McCartney's performance of [...] "50s rock and roll classics" [...] at Liverpool's The Cavern Club in December 1999, which was viewed by an audience of about three million.|$|E

2500|$|Unusually {{for a first}} {{language}} learner, Genie never engaged {{in any kind of}} experimentation with language. Sometimes if Genie mastered an aspect of grammar she would not use it in everyday interactions, such as imperatives, and with many others, such as past tense or plural words, she only used the correct words or markers if separately and specifically asked. If someone asked Genie a yes or no question she often repeated part of the question or said [...] "no" [...] even if she clearly meant yes <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> head the correct way, which Curtiss concluded was Genie simply repeating the last word of the sentence. By contrast, she frequently understood and responded to highly complex questions that she could not on tests, especially sentences requiring some degree of inference and sentences performing both a locutionary and illocutionary act. Her comprehension of other complex sentences remained inconsistent, although beginning in November 1973 researchers recorded slow but noticeable improvement.|$|E
2500|$|With Democrats facing {{possible}} large {{losses in}} the 2010 midterm elections and President Obama struggling in opinion polls, idle speculation in Washington media circles concerning Obama's chances in the 2012 presidential election led {{to the notion that}} Clinton would take over as Obama's vice-presidential running mate in 2012 to add to his electoral appeal. Some versions of this idea had Vice President Biden replacing her as Secretary of State if Obama won. That it would ever happen was unlikely, but did not stop the chatter; when the job swap idea was mentioned in public to Clinton, she smiled <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> head. A couple of months later, Obama shot down the idea, saying the notion was [...] "completely unfounded" [...] and that [...] "they are both doing outstanding jobs where they are." [...] (In late 2011, however, with Obama's popularity on the decline, White House Chief of Staff William M. Daley did conduct some research into the idea of Clinton replacing Biden, but the notion was dropped when the results showed no appreciable improvement for Obama.) ...|$|E
60|$|When {{they told}} {{her that if she}} swore at God <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> fist at the sky she would {{certainly}} drop dead, she calmly stepped forward <b>and</b> <b>shook</b> <b>her</b> little fist up at the sun and swore, while the awe-stricken children cowered like a covey of partridges.|$|E

60|$|Then {{again she}} gazed at me with her wonderful, great eyes, <b>and,</b> <b>shaking</b> <b>her</b> {{glittering}} head a little, smiled and went.|$|R
