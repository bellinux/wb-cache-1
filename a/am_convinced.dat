5|$|I believe that, {{beyond a}} doubt, {{we are now}} facing the best {{opportunity}} we have had in 15 years to build a lasting peace in the Middle East. I <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> history will hold us responsible if we let this opportunity slip by... I now consider a permanent Middle East settlement {{to be the most}} important final goal to which we must devote ourselves.|$|E
5|$|It isn't a {{personal}} pain which has brought me here, {{as is the}} case in the majority of these people, but rather recognition of the symbolic nature of Katyń. Russians and Poles, tortured to death, lie here together. It seems very important to me that the truth should be spoken about what took place, for only with the truth can the new Soviet leadership distance itself from the crimes of Stalin and the NKVD. Only the truth can serve as the basis of true friendship between the Soviet and the Polish peoples. The truth will make a path for itself. I <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> of this by the very fact that I was able to travel here.|$|E
5|$|The total {{incompetence}} of the D.C. {{government in}} Washington, DC, {{has become an}} embarrassment to our entire Nation. This experiment in home rule is a disaster. All of us who serve in this Chamber, well over 95% of us, have held other positions in government. We have been mayors. We have been township trustees, State legislators, and the rest. I <b>am</b> <b>convinced,</b> Mr. Speaker, that there are well over 2,000 township trustees in my congressional district who with one arm tied behind their backs, could blindfolded {{do a better job}} of directing this city than the city council of D.C. It is high time that this experiment in home rule that has proven to be a disaster for our nation be terminated, that we return to some sort of logical government whereby the rest of us can function in this city.|$|E

In their strictmajority scenario, whenever {{more than half of}} the neighbors of a vertex v <b>are</b> <b>convinced</b> of a message, v itself also becomes convinced. The spreading proceeds asynchronously until no more vertices can <b>be</b> <b>convinced.</b> Following Chang and Lyuu [Chang and Lyuu, 2008], we derive lower bounds on the minimum number min-seed(n, p) of vertices that need to <b>be</b> <b>convinced</b> initially so that all vertices will <b>be</b> <b>convinced</b> at the end. Our main results are that min-seed(n, p) = Ω (min { n, p 2 n 2 }) and min-seed(n, p) = Ω (n 2 / 3) hold with high probability. We also consider the case of random seeds. For any sufficiently large constant d> 0 and any s ≤ n/(d ln n), we show that if one picks the set of seeds uniformly at random from the family of all s-sized sets, then with high probability, not all vertices will <b>be</b> <b>convinced</b> at the end. ...|$|R

5|$|Nobody {{has ever}} cut {{anything}} from Andrei Rublev. Nobody except me. I made some cuts myself. In {{the first version}} the film was 3 hours 20 minutes long. In the second — 3 hours 15 minutes. I shortened the final version to 3 hours 6 minutes. I <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> the latest version is the best, the most successful. And I only cut certain overly long scenes. The viewer doesn't even notice their absence. The cuts have in no way changed neither the subject matter nor what was for us important in the film. In other words, we removed overly long scenes which had no significance. We shortened certain scenes of brutality in order to induce psychological shock in viewers, {{as opposed to a}} mere unpleasant impression which would only destroy our intent. All my friends and colleagues who during long discussions were advising me to make those cuts turned out right in the end. It took me some time to understand it. At first I got the impression they were attempting to pressure my creative individuality. Later I understood that this final version of the film more than fulfils my requirements for it. And I do not regret at all that the film has been shortened to its present length.|$|E
25|$|Unless I <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> by the {{testimony}} of the Scriptures or by clear reason (for I do not trust either in the pope or in councils alone, since {{it is well known that}} they have often erred and contradicted themselves), I am bound by the Scriptures I have quoted and my conscience is captive to the Word of God. I cannot and will not recant anything, since it is neither safe nor right to go against conscience. May God help me. Amen.|$|E
25|$|LaHaye {{believed}} that the Illuminati is secretly engineering world affairs. In Rapture Under Attack he wrote:I myself have been a forty-five year student of the satanically-inspired, centuries-old conspiracy to use government, education, and media to destroy every vestige of Christianity within our society and establish a new world order. Having read at least fifty books on the Illuminati, I <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> that it exists and can be blamed for many of man's inhumane actions against his fellow man {{during the past two}} hundred years.|$|E

5000|$|Jesus doesn’t {{guarantee}} everlasting life {{to those}} who are 60% “sure” that He guarantees their eternal destiny. Jesus said, “He who believes in Me has everlasting life” (John 6:47).

When He asked Martha, “Do you believe this?” He was asking her if she <b>was</b> <b>convinced</b> that the person who lives and believes in Him will never die spiritually. <b>Being</b> <b>convinced</b> <b>is</b> certainty, not some percentage of certainty.

25|$|President Klaus Iohannis is a {{supporter}} of the fight against corruption in Romania. Since coming to power in November 2014, has sent several messages of support to prosecutors investigating sensitive cases against politicians accused of corruption. Making one of its important position was in February 25, 2016 {{at the annual meeting of}} the National Anticorruption Directorate: “From year to year the work of the National Anticorruption Directorate has become more effective as the number of cases investigated and complexity, as well as final decisions on confiscation and recovery of property from crime. You are a model of functional institution and created a performance standard. Through the work and achievements, you've earned the appreciation of the Romanian citizens who want to live in a just society, in a country without corruption, the institutions, elect to represent them and those who perform public functions are actually serving the people. The results obtained by you in fighting corruption, appreciated and beyond Romania's borders are a guarantee that the process of strengthening democracy and the rule of law in Romania are on track. I <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> that we will be increasingly more powerful in applying the constitutional principle that nobody is above the law and to align our established practice in countries with democracies that put the citizen at the center of any policy”, stated Klaus Iohannis.|$|E
25|$|We {{are entirely}} in accord in admitting the {{existence}} of God. How can I doubt His when I <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> of mine. Who so recognizes the effect recognizes the cause. To doubt God is to doubt one's own conscience, and in consequence, {{it would be to}} doubt everything; and then what is life for? Now then, my faith in God, if the result of a ratiocination may be called faith, is blind, blind in the sense of knowing nothing. I neither believe nor disbelieve the qualities which many attribute to Him; before theologians' and philosophers' definitions and lucubrations of this ineffable and inscrutable being I find myself smiling. Faced with the conviction of seeing myself confronting the supreme Problem, which confused voices seek to explain to me, I cannot but reply: ‘It could be’; but the God that I foreknow is far more grand, far more good: Plus Supra!...I believe in (revelation); but not in revelation or revelations which each religion or religions claim to possess. Examining them impartially, comparing them and scrutinizing them, one cannot avoid discerning the human 'fingernail' and the stamp of the time in which they were written... No, let us not make God in our image, poor inhabitants that we are of a distant planet lost in infinite space. However, brilliant and sublime our intelligence may be, it is scarcely more than a small spark which shines and in an instant is extinguished, and it alone can give us no idea of that blaze, that conflagration, that ocean of light. I believe in revelation, but in that living revelation which surrounds us on every side, in that voice, mighty, eternal, unceasing, incorruptible, clear, distinct, universal as is the being from whom it proceeds, in that revelation which speaks to us and penetrates us from the moment we are born until we die. What books can better reveal to us the goodness of God, His love, His providence, His eternity, His glory, His wisdom? ‘The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork.|$|E

500|$|During 1710 Horseburgh {{raised an}} action for {{wrongful}} imprisonment against {{two of the}} bailies, William Bell and Robert Vernour. An admission from Bell was issued on 28 October 1710 stating: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> of the rashness, illegality and unwarrantableness of our proceedings, having proceeded on idle stories;" [...] he also asked for forgiveness from God and Horseburgh, acknowledging he had maligned a guiltless person. His apology included that he thought Morton had been [...] "labouring under a melancholy distemper." [...] Horseburgh was awarded monetary recompense.|$|E
500|$|Darwin {{thought of}} natural {{selection}} by analogy to how farmers select crops or livestock for breeding, which he called [...] "artificial selection"; in his early manuscripts he referred to a [...] "Nature" [...] which would do the selection. At the time, other mechanisms of evolution such as evolution by genetic drift were not yet explicitly formulated, and Darwin believed that selection was likely {{only part of the}} story: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> that Natural Selection has been the main but not exclusive means of modification." [...] In a letter to Charles Lyell in September 1860, Darwin regretted {{the use of the term}} [...] "Natural Selection", preferring the term [...] "Natural Preservation".|$|E

500|$|La Poype de Vertrieu {{wrote his}} report and {{recommendations}} for the refitting of Marseillois on 24 December 1779; he found her a passable ship, but her high poop hindered her sailing when running, and he recommended improvements to the gun ports of the castles, which were obstructed and allowed only two guns on the quarterdeck {{and one on the}} forecastle to be used. Furthermore, substantial repairs on the rigging were needed, and she needed her hull heated to kill worms. La Poype de Vertrieu wrote [...] "it appears that Marseillois shall never be an exceptional sailor, but I <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> that she will give satisfaction".|$|E
500|$|In May 1836 Bennett {{travelled}} to Düsseldorf in {{the company}} of Davison to attend the Lower Rhenish Music Festival for the first performance of Mendelssohn's oratorio St Paul. Bennett's visit was enabled by a subsidy by the piano-making firm of John Broadwood & Sons. Inspired by his journey up the Rhine, Bennett began work on his overture The Naiads (Op. 15). After Bennett left for home, Mendelssohn wrote to their mutual friend, the English organist and composer Thomas Attwood, [...] "I think him the most promising young musician I know, not only in your country but also here, and I <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> if he does not become a very great musician, it is not God's will, but his own".|$|E
500|$|Visitors to Seeon {{included}} Prince Felix Yusupov, {{husband of}} Princess Irina Alexandrovna of Russia, who wrote, [...] "I claim categorically {{that she is}} not Anastasia Nicolaievna, but just an adventuress, a sick hysteric and a frightful playactress. I simply cannot understand how anyone can be in doubt of this. If you had seen her, I <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> that you would recoil in horror at the thought that this frightful creature could be a daughter of our Tsar." [...] Other visitors, however, such as Felix Dassel, an officer whom Anastasia had visited in hospital during 1916, and Gleb Botkin, who had known Anastasia as a child and was Tatiana Melnik's brother, were convinced that Tschaikovsky was genuine.|$|E

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed concern over a new government saying: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> that the forces that want to bring change and democratization in Egypt will also enhance peace between Israel and the Arab world.

500|$|Initially, Erdely {{stood by}} her story, stating: [...] "I <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> {{that it could}} not have been done any other way, or any better." [...] But on December 5, 2014, Rolling Stone {{published}} an online apology, stating that there appeared to be [...] "discrepancies" [...] in the accounts of Erdely's sources and that their trust in the accuser was misplaced. A subsequent tweet sent by Rolling Stone managing editor Will Dana offered further comment on Erdely's story: [...] "e made a judgement—the kind of judgement reporters and editors make every day. And in this case, our judgement was wrong." [...] On December 6, Rolling Stone updated the apology to say the mistakes in the article were the fault of Rolling Stone and not of its source, while noting that [...] "there now appear to be discrepancies in Jackie's account".|$|E
500|$|Positive {{comments}} {{came from}} functionalist architect Erich Mendelsohn in 1938, who wrote to Holden {{that he was}} [...] "very much taken and <b>am</b> <b>convinced</b> {{that there is no}} finer building in London." [...] Architectural historian Arnold Whittick described the building as a [...] "static massive pyramid ... obviously designed to last for a thousand years", but thought [...] "the interior is more pleasing than the exterior. There is essentially the atmosphere of dignity, serenity and repose that one associates with the architecture of ancient Greece." [...] Nikolaus Pevsner was less enthusiastic. He described its style as [...] "strangely semi-traditional, undecided modernism" [...] and summarised the result: [...] "The design certainly does not possess the vigour and directness of Charles Holden's smaller Underground stations." [...] Others have described it as Stalinist or as totalitarian due to its great scale.|$|E
