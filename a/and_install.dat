However, volume license customers, TechNet or MSDN subscribers and users of Windows 8 Enterprise must acquire standalone installation media for Windows 8.1 <b>and</b> <b>install</b> through the traditional Windows setup process, either as an in-place upgrade or clean install. This requires a Windows 8.1-specific product key.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Kappa Kappa Psi {{began an}} ambitious {{expansion}} program to reactivate old chapters <b>and</b> <b>install</b> new ones. The fraternity had been divided into 11 districts since 1941, which {{were led by}} a Grand Counselor (now called Governors). With the revitalization of the fraternity, these districts were reorganized and pamphlets were printed detailing the fraternity's purposes and history. District governors were charged with giving information to potential chapters. The expansion program was quite successful—in the ten years following the fraternity's reorganization in 1947, Kappa Kappa Psi more than doubled the number of installed chapters, growing from 45 chapters installed before the war to 98 {{by the end of}} 1957.|$|E

5|$|Although {{initially}} {{planned for}} an East Coast shoot, The Judy Garland Show was taped in Studio 43 at CBS Television City in Los Angeles. The network {{had gone to}} great expense to prepare the studio, including an estimated $100,000 to raise the stage <b>and</b> <b>install</b> a separate revolving stage. Garland's dressing room was a 110ft × 40ft trailer which had been decorated as a replica of her newly purchased Brentwood home. The corridor that led from her dressing room to the stage was painted to resemble the Yellow Brick Road from The Wizard of Oz.|$|E

The Naval Ordnance Laboratory handled the blast measurement tests, while the Naval Research Laboratory conducted the radiation measurement experiments, and Argonne National Laboratory did gamma ray measurements. Edgerton, Germeshausen, and Grier were contractors hired to design <b>and</b> <b>install</b> the timing and firing systems. Seven experimental weapon assemblies and six cores were delivered to San Pedro, California, and loaded on the weapon assembly ship USS Curtiss, in February 1948, but the Atomic Energy Commission only gave permission for the expenditure of three cores in the tests.|$|E

5|$|The Babe Ruth Birthplace Museum {{is located}} at 216 Emory Street, a Baltimore row house where Ruth was born, and three blocks west of Oriole Park at Camden Yards, where the AL's Baltimore Orioles play. The {{property}} was restored and {{opened to the public}} in 1973 by the non-profit Babe Ruth Birthplace Foundation, Inc. Ruth's widow, Claire, his two daughters, Dorothy and Julia, and his sister, Mamie, helped select <b>and</b> <b>install</b> exhibits for the museum.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} burglaries by a cat burglar {{take place in}} Springfield, even {{striking}} the Simpsons' house. Among the stolen items include Lisa's saxophone, Marge's pearl necklace, Bart's stamp collection, and the handheld television. In response, the residents of Springfield arm themselves <b>and</b> <b>install</b> security devices. A neighborhood watch group is formed, and the members elect Homer as their leader. The group patrols the streets, but its members only end up violating laws further than catching criminals, turning into vigilantes. When Homer is interviewed on news anchor Kent Brockman's Smartline, the cat burglar calls the show and informs Homer that he will steal the world's largest cubic zirconia from the Springfield museum.|$|E
5|$|Bisley and Henley {{had both}} been {{previously}} used as venues during the 1908 Games. Bisley hosted {{most of the}} shooting events while Henley hosted the rowing competition. Henley continues to host the Royal Regatta, which started in 1839, and remains in use as of 2010 for global competition, including the Diamond Sculls event. The Harringay Arena was built in 1928 and staged sporting events until its demolition in 1958. Built in 1891, the Herne Hill Velodrome hosted track cycling. After falling into disrepair by 2011, a modernization plan was implemented to make extensive structural repairs to the site <b>and</b> <b>install</b> a new track surface {{so that it could}} used by British Cycling, the national sport governing body.|$|E

5|$|By 1153, {{the castle}} {{garrison}} was running very low on food, and Roger {{made a deal}} with Stephen allowing him to leave the castle with his followers. Henry, the Empress' son and the future Henry II, then intervened, marching his forces to relieve the castle and placing Stephen's counter-castles under siege himself. King Stephen marched back from Oxford, and the two forces confronted each other on the meadows outside the castle. The result was an embryonic peace deal called the Treaty of Wallingford, leading on to the permanent Treaty of Winchester that would ultimately {{bring an end to the}} civil war <b>and</b> <b>install</b> Henry as king following Stephen's death in 1153. Brien, who had no children, chose to enter a monastery, and surrendered Wallingford Castle to Henry at the end of the conflict in 1153.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{moderation}} and clemency {{shown by}} Kantakouzenos in this settlement, {{it did not}} gain universal acceptance. Supporters of the Palaiologoi still distrusted him, while his own partisans {{would have preferred to}} depose the Palaiologoi outright <b>and</b> <b>install</b> the Kantakouzenoi as the reigning dynasty. Kantakouzenos' eldest son, Matthew, also resented being passed over in favour of John V, and had to be placated with the creation of a semi-autonomous appanage covering much of western Thrace, which doubled as a march against Dušan's Serbia. Of the remaining Byzantine territories, only the Zealots in Thessalonica, now an isolated exclave surrounded by the Serbs, refused to acknowledge the new arrangement, instead leading a de facto independent existence until Kantakouzenos conquered them in 1350.|$|E
5|$|In 1933 and 1934, the Century of Progress International Exposition {{was held}} in Burnham Park. In the mid-1930s, the Chicago Park District used funds from the federal Works Progress Administration to {{complete}} landfill operations <b>and</b> <b>install</b> landscaping at Promontory Point by renowned designer Alfred Caldwell, {{a professor at the}} Illinois Institute of Technology. In 1935, Mayor Edward Joseph Kelly explored the idea of a permanent fair in the park. The state passed a bill creating the Metropolitan Fair and Exposition Authority and allowed construction of Meigs Field, after Northerly Island lost out as the site for the United Nations. In 1948, Burnham Park hosted the Chicago Railroad Fair, proving the location's viability for conventions, which eventually led to the construction of the first McCormick Place in 1960.|$|E

5|$|Later queens {{also left}} their {{mark on the}} Rova through major {{construction}} projects. Queen Rasoherina had Marivolanitra relocated to Mahazoarivo {{to make room for}} Manampisoa ("Adding What is Pleasant"), built from 1865 to 1867 for use as her personal residence. A Protestant chapel (Fiangonana) was erected during the reign of RanavalonaII, who also ordered the exterior of the wooden Manjakamiadana to be encased in stone. Plans to build a private residence for RanavalonaIII were abandoned in 1896 at the time of French colonisation of the island. According to one source, partial electrification of the Rova may have been successfully tested on Christmas Day 1892. Following this experiment, Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony and Queen RanavalonaIII began working with a contractor to purchase <b>and</b> <b>install</b> the necessary equipment to expand electrification throughout the Rova, but this initiative was also interrupted by the advent of French colonisation.|$|E
5|$|Overcrowding was a {{major problem}} at many {{stations}} where interchanges were made with other Underground lines and efforts were made {{in a number of}} places to improve passenger movements. In 1914, work was carried out to provide larger ticket halls <b>and</b> <b>install</b> escalators at Oxford Circus, Embankment and Baker Street. In 1923, further work at Oxford Circus provided a combined Bakerloo and CLR ticket hall and added more escalators serving the CLR platforms. In 1926, Trafalgar Square and Waterloo received escalators, the latter in conjunction with expansion of the station as part of the CCE's extension to Kennington. Between 1925 and 1928, Piccadilly Circus station saw the greatest reconstruction. A large circular ticket hall was excavated below the road junction with multiple subway connections from points around the Circus and two flights of escalators down to the Bakerloo and Piccadilly platforms were installed.|$|E
5|$|Parsons Transportation Group {{was awarded}} a $138million {{contract}} in November 2011 to design <b>and</b> <b>install</b> CBOSS by October 2015. Parsons began physical work on CBOSS in September 2013, starting with the installation of a fiber optic line along the Caltrain right-of-way. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) approved Caltrain's plans in 2014 and Caltrain noted that CBOSS was due to enter revenue service {{by the end of}} 2015. Because Caltrain had multiple goals for CBOSS, including increased safety, improved operational efficiency, and ensured interoperability with other rail providers (Caltrain shares tracks with Union Pacific, Altamont Corridor Express, and Amtrak), implementation was challenging and Caltrain, the busiest commuter rail service on the West Coast, still had not fully implemented the system by the end of 2016.|$|E

5|$|Strickland did {{not take}} into account the swampy lowland and high water table that characterizes the terrain around New Orleans, and so during its career the New Orleans Mint {{building}} has encountered numerous structural problems from the shifting soil beneath its foundation. In the 1840s the building was reinforced with iron rods inserted between the floors. In 1854, the federal government hired West Point engineering graduate (and Louisiana native) Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard to fireproof the building, rebuild the arches supporting the basement ceiling <b>and</b> <b>install</b> masonry flooring. Beauregard completed the work in conjunction with Captain Johnson K. Duncan by 1859. During this period, the Mint's heavy machinery was converted to steam power so a smokestack (since demolished) was built at the rear of the structure to carry away the fumes.|$|E
5|$|The work to re-grade <b>and</b> <b>install</b> {{drainage}} on Peach and Sassafras Streets {{coincided with}} {{the building of the}} station from 1925 to 1927, and cost the city approximately $110,000. A temporary station was also erected at 14th and French Streets, and was used after the old Union Depot was demolished in 1925 until the completion of the new station. Union Station was dedicated on December3, 1927, in a ceremony presided over by the presidents of the New York Central and Pennsylvania railroads, the mayor of Erie Joseph Williams, and former mayor William Stern who helped initiate the project. The Griswold Plaza Post Office, {{on the north side of}} 14th Street, opened in 1932 along with the tunnel connecting it to Union Station.|$|E
5|$|Those {{accustomed}} to making repairs on solid state equipment are cautioned that vacuum tube gear contain potentially lethal voltages. The practice of discharging power-supply capacitors and keeping one hand {{in your pocket}} when working on powered-up gear are essential safety measures. Some older equipment directly connects the metal chassis {{to one side of}} the incoming AC line, a practice which results in the entire unit becoming electrified if the wall plug is inserted backwards. Many older radios, such as vintage receivers, are not safety-fused. Restorers generally replace the AC line cord with a more modern 3 wire plug <b>and</b> <b>install</b> an in-line or chassis mount fuseholder. The use of a common station ground connection to all equipment is encouraged. Those who collect, restore or otherwise use vintage radio equipment should also be aware of possible radioactive substances.|$|E
