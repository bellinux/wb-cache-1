6000|$|... [He {{turns and}} goes {{out into the}} hall. TENCH makes two {{attempts}} [...] to speak; but meeting his Chairman's gaze he drops his eyes, [...] and, turning dismally, he too goes out. ANTHONY is left alone. [...] He grips the glass, tilts it, and drinks deeply; then sets it [...] down with a deep and rumbling sigh, <b>and</b> <b>leans</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his [...] chair.] ...|$|R
60|$|The {{man looked}} hard at him, {{and then went}} quietly out; <b>and</b> Grant <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his seat with a soft laugh.|$|R
60|$|He {{saw that}} she did not grasp all he meant to convey, <b>and</b> he <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair with a laugh.|$|R
60|$|Heneage helped {{himself to}} a {{cigarette}} from Mason's case, <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Bultiwell {{thrust his}} hands into his {{trousers}} pockets <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair.|$|E
60|$|He lighted it {{carefully}} {{when it was}} brought to him <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair.|$|E
60|$|Brooke {{looked hard}} at him, <b>and</b> then <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair, <b>and</b> laughed {{when he saw}} that he was {{perfectly}} serious.|$|R
6000|$|... "We hiked into Monterey last winter, but we're ridin' out now, b 'gosh!" [...] Billy said as {{the train}} pulled out <b>and</b> they <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> their seats.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} better than nothing," [...] she said coldly, <b>and</b> then <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> her chair in a sudden fit of impatience with him and the whole situation.|$|R
60|$|The Colonel lit a cigar <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair. He {{was enjoying}} himself immensely.|$|E

60|$|They {{are in the}} act of ratifying {{the treaty}} of {{friendly}} move, by shaking hands upon it. They softly break off, light their pipes which have gone out, <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> their chairs. No doubt, a footstep. It approaches the window, and a hand taps at the glass. 'Come in!' calls Wegg; meaning come round by the door. But the heavy old-fashioned sash is slowly raised, and a head slowly looks in out of the dark background of night.|$|R
60|$|<b>And</b> John Stumpy <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> {{the rocker}} in a defiant fashion.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Bellew {{took his}} hand, <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> again <b>in</b> her corner. She was rather paler than usual, {{but it became}} her, and Captain Maydew thought {{he had never seen}} so charming a creature.|$|R
60|$|She {{closed her}} parasol <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> her {{corner of the}} seat. She seemed to be {{studying}} his expression.|$|E
60|$|He {{dabbed at}} his lips with his napkin <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair. Peterson stared dejectedly at the table.|$|E
60|$|Christine, who {{had been}} bending forward over her fan, now lifted herself up with a sigh <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> her chair.|$|E
60|$|Hezekiah changed ears, {{speaking}} at first slowly and awkwardly, but becoming more fluent as he warmed with his subject; while {{the expression of}} his listenerâ€™s face gradually changed from incredulous bewilderment to one of uncontrollable mirth. He became so uproarious that he was fain to push the captain away from him, <b>and</b> <b>lean</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair <b>and</b> choke and laugh until he nearly lost his breath, at which crisis a remarkably pretty girl appeared {{from the back of}} the house, and patted him with hearty good will.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{this is of}} the {{greatest}} importance," [...] broke in the little man called Brown. [...] "Why, her mother won't let them get engaged." [...] <b>And</b> he <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair in radiant rationality.|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{an astounding}} card," [...] he said, staring. [...] "I shall come and hear your sermons, if they're as amusing as your manners." [...] His voice changed a little, <b>and</b> he <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair.|$|R

60|$|Deane {{came down}} to earth again as the curtain fell. His {{companion}} drew a long, soft breath, <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> her seat.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, we're {{behaving}} shockingly, {{all three}} of us!" [...] Philippa declared, as she sipped her champagne <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> her seat.|$|E
60|$|Major Thomson seated {{himself before}} the desk <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> a little <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair.|$|R
60|$|Then he {{went into}} many details and brought {{in one of his}} assistants to verify some of the statements. Dick Rover listened {{carefully}} to all that was said, <b>and</b> then <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair <b>and</b> looked at the oil expert sharply.|$|R
60|$|Agent <b>and</b> bailiff <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the tonneau {{of their}} motor-car, {{half an hour}} later, with immense cigars in their mouths and a pleasant, {{rippling}} warmth in their veins. They had the sense of having drifted into fairyland. Their philosophy, however, met the situation.|$|R
60|$|Saxon {{burst out}} laughing, <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his seat {{with his long}} legs {{stretched}} straight out and {{his hands in his}} breeches pockets.|$|E
60|$|The Marquis {{crossed his}} legs <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> the vehicle. Mr. Wadham {{remained}} upon the pavement, gazing {{for a moment}} at his empty hand.|$|E
60|$|The elder man seated himself <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair, {{with his}} violin in his lap; then he {{surveyed}} his friend long and curiously.|$|E
60|$|Her {{long fingers}} stole into the {{cigarette}} box. She accepted a light from him <b>and</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> once more <b>in</b> her chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I bear him no malice," [...] replied Ashe good-humoredly, [...] "But I'm glad he's gone, because--well, because I don't {{want him}} to know how jolly right he is." [...] <b>And</b> he <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair <b>and</b> stared up at the roof of green leaves.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, of course, you hadn't asked him." [...] Mrs. Lapham crocheted in silence, <b>and</b> {{her husband}} <b>leaned</b> <b>back</b> <b>in</b> his chair <b>and</b> smoked.|$|R
