He removed a section of the fence for platform access after meeting with the MBTA, but disputed whether he was required to provide access and station facilities according to the terms of the 1960 land sale. Despite intervention by state legislators and a postcard campaign by residents, an agreement was not reached in 2014. In December 2014, the MBTA rejected a plan that would have created a pedestrian <b>access</b> <b>path</b> and a vehicle dropoff lane, alleging that the landowner had unfairly shifted property lines.|$|E

40|$|Precise data-flow {{analyses}} frequently model field <b>accesses</b> through <b>access</b> <b>paths</b> {{with varying}} length. While using longer <b>access</b> <b>paths</b> increases precision, their size must be bounded to assure termination, and should anyway be small to enable a scalable analysis. We present Access-Path Abstraction, {{which for the}} first time combines efficiency with maximal precision. At control-flow merge points Access-Path Abstraction represents all those <b>access</b> <b>paths</b> that are rooted at the same base variable through this base variable only. The full <b>access</b> <b>paths</b> are reconstructed on demand where required. This makes it unnecessary to bound <b>access</b> <b>paths</b> to a fixed maximal length. Experiments with Stanford SecuriBench and the Java Class Library compare our open-source implementation against a field-based approach and against a field-sensitive approach that uses bounded <b>access</b> <b>paths.</b> The results show that the proposed approach scales as well as a field-based approach, whereas the approach using bounded <b>access</b> <b>paths</b> runs out of memory...|$|R

We introduce the idea of <b>access</b> <b>paths</b> and <b>access</b> <b>paths</b> constraints.

25|$|An almost {{inaccessible}} cave, dubbed Yoram Cave, {{located on}} the sheer southern cliff face 100 m below the plateau, {{has been found to}} contain numerous plant remains, of which 6,000-year-old barley seeds were in such good state of preservation that their genome could be sequenced. This {{is the first time that}} this succeeded with a Chalcolithic plant genome, which is also the oldest one sequenced so far. The result helped determine that the earliest domestication of barley, dated elsewhere in the Fertile Crescent to 10,000 years ago, happened further north up the Jordan Rift Valley, namely in the Upper Jordan Valley in northern Israel. The Yoram Cave seeds were found to be fairly different from the wild variety, proof for an already advanced process of domestication, but very similar to the types of barley still cultivated in the region - an indication for remarkable constancy. Considering the difficulty in reaching the cave, whose mouth opens some 4 m above the exposed <b>access</b> <b>path,</b> the researchers have speculated that it was a place of short-term refuge for Chalcolithic people fleeing an unknown catastrophe.|$|E

The dedication meant that the final room in the tower was now complete and open to the public. [...] In 1967, the city of Alexandria changed the street layout around the memorial. [...] As part of this alteration, the memorial granted the city a [...] wide <b>access</b> <b>path</b> (or [...] "alley") between the memorial's access road and Park Road. [...] Since the back wall of the auditorium had never been faced with granite, the protruding steel reinforcing bars had rusted. [...] These were removed in 1968, as they were no longer fit for use. Finally, in 1970, the 40-year-old oil-burning heating plant was replaced with new natural gas-burning boilers, the city of Alexandria donated a back-up electrical generator to keep the tower lit in case of blackouts, additional lighting for the tower was installed, and additional landscaping work completed.|$|E

40|$|Conceptual Graphs (CGs) are {{a natural}} and {{intuitive}} notation for expressing first-order logic statements. However, the task of performing inference with a large-scale CG knowledge base remains largely unexplored. Although basic inference operators are defined for CGs, few methods are available for guiding their application during automated reasoning. Given the expressive power of CGs, this can result in inference being intractable. In this paper we show how a method used elsewhere for achieving tractability [...] - namely the use of <b>access</b> <b>paths</b> [...] - {{can be applied to}} conceptual graphs. <b>Access</b> <b>paths</b> add to CGs domain-specific information that guides inference by specifying preferred chains of subgoals for each inference goal (and hence, other chains will not be tried). This approach trades logical completeness for focussed inference, and allows incompleteness to be introduced in a controlled way (through the knowledge engineer's choice of which <b>access</b> <b>paths</b> to attach to CGs). The result o [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Identifying dependences {{present in}} the body of {{sequential}} program is used by paralleliz-ing compilers to automatically extract parallelism from the program. Dependence detection mechanisms for programs with scalar and static variables is well explored and have become a standard part of parallelizing and vectorizing compilers. However, detecting dependences in the presence of dynamic (heap) recursive data structures is highly complex because of the unbound and dynamic nature of the structure. The problem becomes more critical due to the presence of pointer-induced aliasing. This thesis addresses the aforementioned problem and gives a novel approach for depen-dence analysis of sequential programs in presence of heap data structure. The novelty of our technique lies in the two-phase mechanism, where the first phase identifies dependences for whole procedure. It computes abstract heap <b>access</b> <b>paths</b> for each heap accessing statement in the procedure. The <b>access</b> <b>paths</b> approximate the locations accessed by the statement. For each pair of statements these <b>access</b> <b>paths</b> are checked for interference. The second phase refines the dependence analysis in the context of loops. The main aspect of the second phas...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{number of}} {{frequent}} itemset discovery algorithms {{have been proposed}} {{in the area of}} data mining research. The algorithms exhibit significant computational complexity, resulting in long processing times. Their performance is also dependent on source data characteristics. We argue that a user should not be responsible for choosing the most efficient algorithm to solve a particular data mining problem. Instead, a data mining query optimizer should follow the cost-based optimization rules to select the appropriate method to solve the user's problem. The optimizer should consider alternative data mining algorithms as well as alternative data <b>access</b> <b>paths.</b> In this paper, we use the concept of materialized views to describe possible data <b>access</b> <b>paths</b> for frequent itemset discovery. ...|$|R
