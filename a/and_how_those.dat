5|$|Molecular {{biology is}} the study of biology at the {{molecular}} level. This field overlaps with other areas of biology, particularly those of genetics and biochemistry. Molecular biology is a study of the interactions of the various systems within a cell, including the interrelationships of DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>those</b> interactions are regulated.|$|E
5|$|The rise of Fascism in {{particular}} frequently encouraged greater state involvement. In Italy, {{between the end}} of the war and 1923 local groups and organisations had established their own local memorials in villages and towns. Not all villages agreed that memorials were appropriate, either for political or religious reasons. With the Fascist revolution, this process became more centralised; veteran groups were assimilated by the Fascist government in 1926, and a systematic attempt to construct suitable national and local memorials followed. In Germany, the political and economic chaos of the immediate post-war years discouraged the construction of civic war memorials and comparatively few civic memorials in their larger towns, mainly due to the shortage of funds in the inter-war German economy and political disagreements between local groups as to what to commemorate <b>and</b> <b>how.</b> <b>Those</b> memorials that were constructed were often built instead by local movements, representing particular factional interests. It was only after the rise of the German Nazi party to power in 1933 that substantial funding began to flow into construction programmes, controlled from Berlin.|$|E

In five forces analysis he identified the forces that shape the industry structure or environment. The framework involves the bargaining power of buyers and suppliers, the threat of new entrants, the availability of substitute products, and the competitive rivalry of firms in the industry. These forces affect the organization's ability to raise its prices {{as well as the}} costs of inputs (such as raw materials) for its processes.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} unite his {{theories}} about the soul and how it operated within the body, he adapted {{the theory of the}} pneuma, which he used to explain how the soul operated within its assigned organs, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>those</b> organs, in turn, interacted together. Galen then distinguished the vital pneuma, in the arterial system, from the psychic pneuma, in the brain and nervous system. Galen placed the vital pneuma in the heart and the psychic pneuma within the brain. He conducted many anatomical studies on animals, most famously an ox, to study the transition from vital to psychic pneuma. Although highly criticized for comparing animal anatomy to human anatomy, Galen was convinced that his knowledge was abundant enough in both anatomies to base one on the other.|$|E

500|$|The poem is, then, {{not merely}} about memory, but how {{memories}} are formed from subjective experience, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>those</b> memories compare to mechanically-reproduced recordings. In the poem, [...] "the mechanism" [...] is {{strongly associated with}} recording, which can replace subjective experience. Insomuch as memories constitute our identities, [...] "the mechanism" [...] thus represents {{the destruction of the}} self via recordings. Hence both cameras, as devices of recording, and guns, as instruments of destruction, are part of the same mechanism—dividing that (memory, identity, life) from this (recordings, anonymity, death).|$|E
500|$|Syntax is {{the rules}} and {{processes}} that describe how sentences are formed in a particular language, how words {{relate to each other}} within clauses or phrases <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>those</b> phrases relate to each other within a sentence to convey meaning. Khmer syntax is very analytic. Relationships between words and phrases are signified primarily by word order supplemented with auxiliary verbs and, particularly in formal and literary registers, grammatical marking particles. Grammatical phenomena such as negation and aspect are marked by particles while interrogative sentences are marked either by particles or interrogative words equivalent to English [...] "wh-words".|$|E

500|$|Cognitive ecology {{integrates}} {{theory and}} observations from evolutionary ecology and neurobiology, primarily cognitive science, {{in order to}} understand the effect that animal interaction with their habitat has on their cognitive systems <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>those</b> systems restrict behavior within an ecological and evolutionary framework. [...] "Until recently, however, cognitive scientists have not paid sufficient attention to the fundamental fact that cognitive traits evolved under particular natural settings. With consideration of the selection pressure on cognition, cognitive ecology can contribute intellectual coherence to the multidisciplinary study of cognition." [...] As a study involving the 'coupling' or interactions between organism and environment, cognitive ecology is closely related to enactivism, a field based upon the view that [...] "...we must see the organism and environment as bound together in reciprocal specification and selection...".|$|E
500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} miniseries a [...] "B", {{noting that the}} event [...] "loses steam when it {{moves away from the}} introspective {{personal}} elements of the past to detail Marceline and her friends' vampire hunting adventure in the present." [...] He also bemoaned the fact that only [...] "Everything Stays" [...] features flashbacks, arguing that [...] "rushing through those past events is a missed opportunity to offer a more comprehensive look at where Marceline comes from <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>those</b> circumstances have shaped her". With that being said, Sava was highly complimentary towards the voice acting, with praise being directed towards Olson and the actors who voice the villains; Sava wrote, [...] "The new characters' personalities are quickly solidified by the guest stars' expressive performances." [...] Eric Thurm of Pitchfork Media opined that Stakes [...] "includes all sorts of cool action sequences and, best of all, it focuses on the backstory of the show's most musical character: Marceline [...] But Stakes, as fun as it is, ultimately fails to fully deliver, mostly because of a lack of, um, stakes." ...|$|E
500|$|Another way {{in which}} {{languages}} convey meaning is through the order of words within a sentence. The grammatical rules for how to produce new sentences from words that are already known is called syntax. The syntactical rules of a language determine why a sentence in English such as [...] "I love you" [...] is meaningful, but [...] "*love you I" [...] is not. Syntactical rules determine how word order and sentence structure is constrained, <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>those</b> constraints contribute to meaning. For example, in English, the two sentences [...] "the slaves were cursing the master" [...] and [...] "the master was cursing the slaves" [...] mean different things, because {{the role of the}} grammatical subject is encoded by the noun being in front of the verb, and the role of object is encoded by the noun appearing after the verb. Conversely, in Latin, both Dominus servos vituperabat and Servos vituperabat dominus mean [...] "the master was reprimanding the slaves", because servos, or [...] "slaves", is in the accusative case, showing that they are the grammatical object of the sentence, and dominus, or [...] "master", is in the nominative case, showing that he is the subject.|$|E

500|$|Waters' {{lyrics to}} The Dark Side of the Moon {{dealt with the}} {{pressures}} of modern life <b>and</b> <b>how</b> <b>those</b> pressures can sometimes cause insanity. He viewed the album's explication of mental illness as illuminating a universal condition. However, Waters also wanted the album to communicate positivity, calling it [...] "an exhortation... to embrace the positive and reject the negative." [...] Reisch described The Wall as [...] "less about the experience of madness than the habits, institutions, and social structures that create or cause madness." [...] The Wall protagonist, Pink, is unable {{to deal with the}} circumstances of his life, and overcome by feelings of guilt, slowly closes himself off from the outside world inside a barrier of his own making. After he completes his estrangement from the world, Pink realises that he is [...] "crazy, over the rainbow". He then considers the possibility that his condition may be his own fault: [...] "have I been guilty all this time?" [...] Realising his greatest fear, Pink believes that he has let everyone down, his overbearing mother wisely choosing to smother him, the teachers rightly criticising his poetic aspirations, and his wife justified in leaving him. He then stands trial for [...] "showing feelings of an almost human nature", further exacerbating his alienation of species being. As with the writings of philosopher Michel Foucault, Waters' lyrics suggest Pink's insanity is a product of modern life, the elements of which, [...] "custom, codependancies, and psychopathologies", contribute to his angst, according to Reisch.|$|E
