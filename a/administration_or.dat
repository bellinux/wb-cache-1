5|$|A {{position}} paper {{published by the}} American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in 2007 warns {{that there is no}} valid medical reason to perform the procedure, which is not considered routine or accepted by the College; and it has not been proven to be safe or effective. The potential risks include sexual dysfunction, infection, altered sensation, dyspareunia, adhesions and scarring. The College position is that it is untenable to recommend the procedure. The procedure is also not approved by the Food and Drug <b>Administration</b> <b>or</b> the American Medical Association, and no peer-reviewed studies have been accepted to account for either safety or effectiveness of this treatment.|$|E

5|$|In about 1332 Ivan Alexander had crowned {{his eldest}} son Michael Asen IV co-emperor, perhaps to {{safeguard}} possession of the throne by his own family. He followed up this traditional association with the coronation of his younger sons Ivan Sracimir and Ivan Asen IV in 1337. Ivan Alexander may have intended the creation of two younger co-emperors to establish immediate control over important cities and regions, as Ivan Sracimir was eventually based in Vidin, and Ivan Asen IV perhaps in Preslav. Nevertheless, this was a marked departure from Byzantine practice, in which younger sons of the sovereign were made despotēs, whether they were charged with a territorial <b>administration</b> <b>or</b> not.|$|E
5|$|In the gubernatorial {{election}} of 1911, Republicans were divided {{as to whether}} they should celebrate Willson's <b>administration</b> <b>or</b> downplay it. His actions to quell the violence in the Black Patch Wars and his pardons to Taylor and Powers were both unpopular with many voters. The eventual candidate, Edward C. O'Rear, was lukewarm at best to Willson's administration. Willson was upset by this hesitancy and lent O'Rear only modest support on the campaign trail. Former governor Bradley also disagreed with O'Rear's selection and engaged in minimal campaigning. The failure of the party to unite behind their candidate gave Democrat James B. McCreary an easy victory.|$|E

5|$|The U.S. State Department, after {{closing the}} NTSB {{investigation}} {{on the grounds}} that it was not an accident, pursued an ICAO investigation instead. Commentators such as Johnson point out that this action was illegal, and that in deferring the investigation to the ICAO, the Reagan administration effectively precluded any politically or militarily sensitive information from being subpoenaed that might have embarrassed the <b>administration</b> <b>or</b> contradicted its version of events. Unlike the NTSB, ICAO can subpoena neither persons nor documents and is dependent on the governments involved—in this incident, the United States, the Soviet Union, Japan, and South Korea—to supply evidence voluntarily.|$|E
