2500|$|Both the cognoscenti and {{the public}} adored him. The {{librettist}} Paolo Rolli, a close friend and supporter of Senesino, commented: [...] "Farinelli has surprised me so much that I feel <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> hitherto heard {{only a small part}} of the human voice, and now have heard it all. He has besides, the most amiable and polite manners ...." [...] Some fans were more unrestrained: one titled lady was so carried away that, from a theatre box, she famously exclaimed: [...] "One God, one Farinelli!" [...] and was immortalised in a detail of Plate II of William Hogarth's [...] "A Rake's Progress" [...] (she may also appear in Plate IV of his series [...] "Marriage à la mode" [...] of 1745).|$|E
2500|$|Hall was a {{tall and}} muscular cricketer, [...] tall and bearing the [...] "physique and {{strength}} of a bodybuilder." [...] He had a graceful, classical action {{and one of the}} longest run-ups in Test cricket. A genuinely fast bowler, he was timed at [...] Hall was able to sustain pace and hostility for very long spells—during the Test against England at Lord's in 1963 he bowled unchanged for over three hours on the final day. While Hall was an aggressive fast bowler, he was not one to set out to injure the batsman. The England cricketer Ted Dexter—himself hit several times by Hall—said [...] "there was never a hint of malice in [...] or in his bowling". Hall himself said after one of his deliveries fractured Australian cricketer Wally Grout's jaw [...] "It made me sick to see Wal leaving and it made me sicker to hear some jokers in the crowd ranting on <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> intentionally hurt [...] ".|$|E
2500|$|Production of {{the song}} began in early 1986. Joel {{considered}} Ray Charles one of his idols. [...] "Ray Charles was my hero when I was growing up," [...] Joel recalled. [...] "As big of a pianist or as big of a star I could ever become, I could never be Ray Charles." [...] According to Joel, when Charles heard that Joel named his daughter, Alexa Ray, after him, Charles contacted him saying that he'd love to do a song with Joel, {{as long as he}} had the [...] "right song" [...] in mind. When writing the song, Joel tried to compose it in the style of Charles' hit, [...] "Georgia on My Mind", while also giving it a blues sound. Joel wrote the song over a single night. [...] "It was one of those rare songs, like [...] "New York State of Mind", that seem to come all at once - it seemed almost <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> heard it before." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the {{new year}} of 1942, Ryle took Wittgenstein {{to his home in}} Sussex to meet his wife who had been adamant to meet him. Ryle's son {{recorded}} the weekend in his diary;Wink is awful strange – not a very good english speaker, keeps on saying ‘I mean’ and ‘its “tolerable”’ meaning intolerable. The hospital staff were not told {{he was one of the}} world's most famous philosophers, though some of the medical staff did recognize him—at least one had attended Moral Sciences Club meetings—but they were discreet. [...] "Good God, don't tell anybody who I am!" [...] Wittgenstein begged one of them. Some of them nevertheless called him Professor Wittgenstein, and he was allowed to dine with the doctors. He wrote on 1 April 1942: [...] "I no longer feel any hope for the future of my life. It is <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> before me nothing more than a long stretch of living death. I cannot imagine any future for me other than a ghastly one. Friendless and joyless." [...] It was at this time that Wittgenstein had an operation at Guy's to remove a gall-stone that had troubled him for some years.|$|E

6000|$|... “It seems <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> lived {{this life}} always. The world {{of books and}} bookish folk is very vague, more like a dream memory than an actuality. <b>I</b> surely <b>have</b> hunted and forayed and fought all the days of my life.

6000|$|Mrs. Joyce {{stopped him}} as he was going up-stairs to his room. [...] "Victor, don't worry about me. While it looks <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> lost a good deal of money through Pettus, I am by no means bankrupt. I am just about where I was when I met your mother. She has not enriched me--I mean The Voices have not--neither have they impoverished me. It's just the same with Leo. She's almost exactly where she was when she came East. It would seem {{as if they had been}} playing with us just to show us how unsubstantial earthly {{possessions}} are." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No;--I {{left you}} <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> grounds for quarrelling; {{but there was}} no quarrel. I wrote to you, and tried to explain that." ...|$|E

6000|$|While thus one spoke, {{the other}} spirit mourn'd [...] With wail so woful, that at his remorse [...] <b>I</b> felt <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> died. <b>I</b> turn'd [...] Stone-stiff; {{and to the}} ground, fell like a corse.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{declared}} I couldn't {{remember any}} one. To {{the best of}} my recollection, I told them, there was no one served at all after ten o'clock. I wouldn't say for certain--it looked <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> might <b>have</b> had a reason." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{young lady}} was gracious also; but I {{am afraid that}} I cannot carry my praises of the family at Glenbogie any further.

60|$|Surprised, and {{a little}} uncomfortable at this {{evidence}} of intuition, I started to protest. It seemed to me then <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> always wanted her.|$|E

That's not the gospel I preached to you in Arundell Street, is it! I thought I was an {{advanced}} apostle of action; but <b>I</b> seem to <b>have</b> changed. I'm afraid I shall {{never be able to}} make clear what I do mean. I only know <b>I</b> feel <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> suddenly grown old. These things are such milestones. Already I am beginning to look on the time before Aline behaved so sensationally as terribly remote. To-morrow it will be worse, and the day after that worse still. I can see that you don't in the least understand what I mean." ...|$|R
500|$|Sibelius {{continued}} to make changes to {{the final version of}} the tone poem as he sailed across the Atlantic Ocean aboard the steamship SS Kaiser Wilhelm II and even during rehearsals in Norfolk, but these last-minute changes, Andrew Barnett argues, must have been relatively [...] "minor", as the orchestral parts had been copied before his departure from Finland. Sibelius was delighted with the new piece, writing to Aino, [...] "It's <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> found myself, and more besides. The Fourth Symphony was the start. But in this piece there is so much more. There are passages in it that drive me crazy. Such poetry". Neither the suite nor the Yale version of the tone poem was performed in Sibelius's lifetime, receiving their world premieres by Osmo Vänskä and the Lahti Symphony Orchestra on 19September and 24October 2002, respectively.|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} contain myself.

6000|$|... "No ship!" [...] he repeated, {{and seemed}} to forget my denial forthwith. [...] "I suppose," [...] said he slowly, [...] "we're both dead.

40|$|It is hard {{to recall}} my exact first {{encounter}} with Emily Dickinson. In some ways, <b>I</b> feel <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> always known her.

Throughout the years, Dickinson has grown with me, in me. In the summer of 2000, I began an independent study focusing on ED 2 ̆ 7 s fascicles. It was during that summer that I chose to focus on F. 18, {{by virtue of the}} fact that it contains 2 ̆ 2 After Great Pain, 2 ̆ 2 a poem which is the quintessence of my fascination with ED. I came to see this fascicle as a microcosm, a distilled version of ED 2 ̆ 7 s personal crises and her crucial relationship with the world...|$|R
