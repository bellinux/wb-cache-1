40|$|El reemplazo de la estepa graminosa nativa por montes de olivos (Olea europaea L.) en pequeños sectores del sur pampeano afectados al cultivo de trigo ha introducido una modificación drástica en la vegetación como factor pedogenético activo. El impacto de este cambio se evaluó en el horizonte A de los suelos predominantes (Paleustolles Petrocalcicos) bajo montes de olivos (LV 2) implantados hace aproximadamente 50 a��os y se lo comparó con el ocasionado por la rotación tradicional trigo (LV 3) -vegetación natural (LV 1). Se determinó: textura, densidad aparente (Da), pH, carbono orgánico (CO), nitrógeno total (Nt), fósforo disponible (Pd), CIC, bases intercambiables y, además, se estudió la organización micromorfológica. El efecto del cambio de vegetación es notable en las tres situaciones comparadas, no obstante, las {{variables}} químicas y la micropedología no reflejan disminución de la calidad del suelo a partir de la introducción de olivos. In small {{sectors of}} the southern Pampean region affected by wheat cultivation, the native grassland steppe {{has been replaced by}} Olea europaea L. mounts, which introduced a drastic modification of vegetation as an active factor of pedogenesis. The impact of this change was evaluated in the A horizons of the predominant soils (Petrocalcic Paleustolls) <b>under</b> <b>olives</b> mounts of approximately 50 years (LV 2) and has been compared to that derived after the traditional rotation wheat (LV 3) -native vegetation (LV 1). Chemical analyses were performed to analyze the variables commonly used in the evaluation of soil fertility: bulk density (Da), texture, pH, organic carbon (CO), total nitrogen (Nt), available phosphorous (Pd), CIC, exchangeable bases. Moreover, a micromorphological study was done. Increments of 90 % magnitude order in CO content, 70 % in Nt and > 100 % in Pd were detected <b>under</b> <b>olive</b> <b>trees</b> cultivation related to a high biomass of <b>olive</b> <b>trees</b> and grass vegetation in the epipedon and to the intense melanization that sustain C/N relationship in acceptable levels.

40|$|Traditional olive {{orchards}} {{account for}} {{a large share of}} the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>olives</b> in the EU, particularly in marginal areas, like those analysed in the OLIVERO project. In general, traditional olive growing can be described as a low-intensity production system, associated with old (sometimes very old) trees, grown at a low density, giving small yields and receiving low inputs of labour and materials. Though such systems are environmentally sustainable, their economic viability has become an issue, since EU policies favour more intensive and competitive systems. Orchards that have not been intensified seem to be threatened by the recent reform of the EU olive and olive oil policy, as income support has been decoupled from production. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify the present constraints to traditional olive growing, and to recommend some private and public interventions to prevent its abandonment. During the OLIVERO project, traditional olive production systems were identified and described in five target areas (Trás-os-Montes-Portugal, Cordoba and Granada/Jaen-Spain, Basilicata/Salerno-Italy, and West Crete-Greece). The causes and consequences of abandonment are discussed, based on the analysis of the costs and returns, which revealed that these systems are barely economically sustainable. Their viability is only assured if reduced opportunity costs for family labour are accepted, and the olive growing is part-time. Based on these results, recommendations are made to prevent the abandonment of traditional olive growing and to preserve its environmental benefits...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the impacts}} of the 2003 CAP reform on the production of Italian olive oil controlling for the regional differences in olive oil production {{as well as for}} the differences between years. Italian olive oil production time series data from the Farm Accountancy Data Network for the 2000 - 2010 period at regional level is used to examine the effect of the 2003 Fischler reform on the production of olive oil. Production costs and payments received by farmers to support their income are considered. The data were collected at micro level based on a sample of farms representative of the production systems in the country. In order to consider the differences in production among the regions, eight representative regions in terms of surveyed farms are considered: Liguria, Toscana, Umbria, Lazio, Campania, Calabria, Puglia and Sicilia. We found that the most important factors affecting the production of olive oil are the <b>area</b> <b>under</b> <b>olive</b> groves and labour productivity. Results also show no evidence that the level of payments have an impact to the level of production, however, the type of payments has. Future work should explore the impact of the 2003 reform into the technical and production efficiency of the Italian olive oil farmers. It would be interesting to link the measures introduced by the cross compliance and the management practices of the different farms to have a more complete picture of the various parameters influencing the production of olive oil...|$|R

These consisted of periodic applications of nutrient solutions containing either, 30 µmol/L FeEDDHA or not Fe. Tolerance was assessed by the chlorosis and growth parameters of plants grown without Fe, compared to those plants grown with Fe. Results show that there are differ-ences in tolerance among olive varieties and that tolerance is mainly determined by the genotype of the rootstock.

As far as literary sources are concerned, the main testimony belongs to Strabo, who mentions Aelius Aristides and Ephoros, as well as the lexicographers. Furthermore, a careful reading of the Delphic Hymns to Apollo illuminates the mythological connections that the Athenians tried to establish. Thus, Apollo is born <b>under</b> an <b>olive</b> <b>tree,</b> the sacred tree of the goddess Athena, a fact which reflects the Athenian supremacy over the Delian League and its treasury.

[...] He came back three days later to find Yogaswami still waiting for his master. Soon afterwards Yogaswami gave up his job and everything else, to follow Chellappaswami for the next five years. His life became filled with intense spiritual discipline and severe austerity. Following Yogaswami's ordination (sannyas diksha), his guru sent him away and never received him again. Chellappaswami died in 1911.1911-1961: Yogaswami spent years of intense tapas <b>under</b> the <b>olive</b> <b>tree</b> at Colombuthurai Road on the outskirts of Jaffna. His practice was to meditate for three days and nights in the open without moving about or taking shelter from the weather. On the fourth day he would walk long distances, returning to the <b>olive</b> <b>tree</b> to repeat the cycle. In his outward behaviour, Yogaswami followed the example of his guru, for he would drive away those who tried to approach him. After some years, he allowed a few sincere seekers to approach. As more and more devotees gathered around him, his austere demeanor relaxed. He was eventually persuaded to occupy a small hut in the garden of a house near his <b>olive</b> <b>tree.</b> This remained his 'base' {{for the rest of his}} life. Even here he initially forbade devotees to revere or care for him. Devotees would come to him for help in all their problems, usually in the early mornings and in the evenings. Day and night Yogaswami was absorbed in his inner worship. On one occasion, Yogaswami was seated in perfect stillness, like a stone. A crow flew down and rested several minutes on his head, apparently thinking this was a statue.|$|R
