5|$|Abstinence-only sex {{education}} does not reduce teenage pregnancy. Teen pregnancy rates are higher in students given abstinence-only education, {{as compared with}} comprehensive {{sex education}}. Some authorities recommend that those using abstinence as a primary method have backup method(s) available (such as condoms or emergency contraceptive pills). Deliberate non-penetrative sex without vaginal sex or deliberate oral sex without vaginal sex are also sometimes considered birth control. While this generally avoids pregnancy, pregnancy can still occur with intercrural sex {{and other forms of}} penis-near-vagina sex (genital rubbing, and the penis exiting from <b>anal</b> <b>intercourse)</b> where sperm can be deposited near the entrance to the vagina and can travel along the vagina's lubricating fluids.|$|E
25|$|According to a 2010 {{study from}} the National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior (NSSHB) that was {{authored}} by Debby Herbenick et al., although <b>anal</b> <b>intercourse</b> is reported by fewer women than other partnered sex behaviors, partnered women in the age groups between 18–49 are {{significantly more likely to}} report having anal sex in the past 90 days. Women engaged in <b>anal</b> <b>intercourse</b> less commonly than men. Vaginal intercourse was practiced more than insertive <b>anal</b> <b>intercourse</b> among men, but 13% to 15% of men aged 25 to 49 practiced insertive <b>anal</b> <b>intercourse.</b>|$|E
25|$|There are {{a variety}} of factors that make {{male-to-female}} <b>anal</b> <b>intercourse</b> riskier for a female than for a male. For example, besides the risk of HIV transmission being higher for <b>anal</b> <b>intercourse</b> than for vaginal intercourse, the risk of injury to the woman during <b>anal</b> <b>intercourse</b> is significantly higher than the risk of injury to her during vaginal intercourse because of the durability of the vaginal tissues compared to the anal tissues. Additionally, if a man moves from <b>anal</b> <b>intercourse</b> immediately to vaginal intercourse without a condom or without changing it, infections can arise in the vagina (or urinary tract) due to bacteria present within the anus; these infections can also result from switching between vaginal sex and anal sex by the use of fingers or sex toys.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Sex workers (SW) clients {{represent}} a bridge population for HIV transmission from high risk to low risk general population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional anonymous telephone survey {{was carried out}} at the AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Infections Helpline of National Institute of Health in Italy. The questionnaire was proposed {{on a voluntary basis}} to a sample of 119 subjects from helpline users. RESULTS: The 119 participants were all males, aged between 19 and 59 years and mostly accessed female prostitutes. Vaginal intercourses with SW were more frequently reported, followed by passive oral, active oral sex and active <b>anal</b> <b>intercourses.</b> Cumulatively, 86. 6 % and 84. 6 % of vaginal and <b>anal</b> <b>intercourses</b> were respectively reported as regularly protected by condom. DISCUSSION: The telephone interview allowed an eased access, a high response rate and a standardised evaluation of questions CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary a constant monitoring of the characteristics, behaviour, risk perception and testing of SW clients in Italian and other populations...|$|R
2500|$|Studies {{have shown}} that {{although}} there is a large market for vaginal microbicides in developing nations, rectal microbicides are stigmatized and less researched. No microbicide has yet been proven to effectively protect against the risks of unprotected <b>anal</b> <b>intercourses,</b> but advocates believe greater funding for research is needed since condom usage rates are so low. However, stigma and homophobia would potentially be barriers to individuals buying the product. The authors mention this is especially a concern in Caribbean countries where HIV prevalence is high but homosexuality is still illegal and highly stigmatized (See HIV/AIDS in the Caribbean.) ...|$|R

25|$|<b>Anal</b> <b>intercourse</b> is {{sometimes}} {{used as a}} substitute for vaginal intercourse during menstruation. The likelihood of pregnancy occurring during anal sex is greatly reduced, as anal sex alone cannot lead to pregnancy unless sperm is somehow transported to the vaginal opening. Because of this, some couples practice <b>anal</b> <b>intercourse</b> as a form of contraception, often {{in the absence of a}} condom.|$|E
25|$|Section 159 of the Criminal Code criminalizes every act of <b>anal</b> <b>intercourse,</b> but {{provides}} exceptions for {{a husband}} and wife, and any two persons 18 {{years of age or}} older. These exceptions do not apply if a third person is present, or if the <b>anal</b> <b>intercourse</b> takes place anywhere but in private. However, courts in Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, Nova Scotia, and Alberta have independently declared s. 159 to be unconstitutional as violations of the equality provision of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.|$|E
25|$|Anal sex or <b>anal</b> <b>intercourse</b> is {{generally}} the insertion and thrusting of the erect penis into a person's anus, or anus and rectum, for sexual pleasure. Other forms of anal sex include fingering, {{the use of}} sex toys for anal penetration, oral sex performed on the anus (anilingus), and pegging. Although the term anal sex most commonly means penile-anal penetration, sources sometimes use the term <b>anal</b> <b>intercourse</b> to refer exclusively to penile-anal penetration, and anal sex to refer to any form of anal sexual activity, especially between pairings as opposed to anal masturbation.|$|E

25|$|During male seminal emission, sperm is {{transmitted}} from the vas deferens into the male urethra via the ejaculatory ducts, which lie within the prostate gland.

40|$|Objective: To {{promote an}} {{innovative}} approach toward interventions for unprotected receptive sex behaviors among male sex workers(MSWs) by understanding sub-cultural features of their sex practice. Methods: A total of 420 MSWs aged 16 - 42 years were selected in Chendu, {{the capital city}} of Sichuan province,and surrounding areas by multiple regression models with cross-sectional design,and they were assigned to 3 groups {{in the context of their}} sub-cultural features: group 1,who openly admitted themselves as MSM;group 2 who admitted having sex with men,but refused to identify themselves as gay(with multiple sex orientation);group 3 who acquiesced in their identity as MSWs. Cross-sectional survey and multiple regression analysis were employed to assess sub-cultural context of high risk sex behaviors among different groups of MSWs. Results: Specific sub-cultural background of MSWs led them to take high risk receptive <b>anal</b> <b>intercourses,</b> whether in sex trade with regular(β= 0. 446,P 0. 000 1) and casual(β= 0. 524,P 0. 000 1) sex partners,or in non-commercial sex with regular(β= 0. 187,P 0. 05) and casual(β= 0. 226,P 0. 01) sex partners.

5000|$|Coitus interruptus (or [...] "pulling out"), {{in which}} the penis {{is removed from the}} vagina, anus, or mouth before ejaculation, is not safe sex and can result in STI transmission. This is because of the {{formation}} of pre-ejaculate, a fluid that oozes from the urethra before actual ejaculation, may contain pathogens such as HIV. Additionally, the microbes responsible for some diseases, including genital warts and syphilis, can be transmitted through skin-to-skin contact, even if the partners never engage in oral, vaginal, or <b>anal</b> sexual <b>intercourse.</b>|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) {{infection}} {{is a major}} cause of morbidity throughout the world. Parenteral exposure to infected blood accounts for the majority of cases. Sexual transmission is suggested by the higher prevalence of infection in sex workers and homosexual men. Sexual practices which contribute to HCV infection need to be identified. METHODS: The social and medical history, and HCV serostatus of 1058 homosexual men in the Pittsburgh arm of the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study were analysed. Multivariate analysis was used to determine risk factors for HCV seropositivity. RESULTS: 31 men were HCV seropositive by enzyme immunoassay and recombinant immunoblot assay (2. 9 %). They {{were more likely to be}} HIV seropositive (39 %) than the HCV seronegative men (19 %). Needle sharing and illegal drug use were the most important risk factors for HCV seropositivity. Statistically significant sexual factors (p < 0. 05) included a history of syphilis, rectal gonorrhea, <b>anal</b> insertive <b>intercourse</b> with ejaculation, and douche or enema use before <b>anal</b> receptive <b>intercourse.</b> The number of sexual partners was not a significant risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: HCV {{infection is}} associated with specific sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and sexual practices in the male homosexual population. The evidence of high risk behavior should be incorporated into ongoing educational efforts to decrease the incidence of STDs...|$|R
25|$|The anal sphincters {{are usually}} tighter than the pelvic {{muscles of the}} vagina, which can enhance the sexual {{pleasure}} for the inserting male during male-to-female <b>anal</b> <b>intercourse</b> because of the pressure applied to the penis. Men may also enjoy the penetrative role during anal sex because of its association with dominance, because it is made more alluring by a female partner or society in general insisting that it is forbidden, or because it presents an additional option for penetration.|$|E
25|$|Cunnilingus can {{be sexually}} arousing for {{participants}} {{and may be}} performed by a sexual partner as foreplay to incite sexual arousal before other sexual activities (such as vaginal or <b>anal</b> <b>intercourse)</b> or as an erotic and physically intimate act on its own. Like most forms of sexual activity, oral sex can be a risk for contracting sexually transmitted infections (STIs/STDs). However, the transmission risk for oral sex, especially HIV transmission, is significantly lower than for vaginal or anal sex.|$|E
25|$|In {{patients}} with HIV, infections {{may be more}} frequent, may cause prolonged bouts of dirty brown diarrhea, and may be more commonly associated with bacteremia and antibiotic resistance.

25|$|Co-infection of HIV and {{syphilis}} {{is probably}} a major reason behind resurgence in syphilis prevalence among {{men who have sex}} with men in China. It is hypothesized that the association observed between syphilis and HIV among MSM is probably due to similar risks associated with both infections. Analysis of data from a survey among MSM in seven Chinese cities reveal that the factors significantly associated with co-infection are older age, education up to senior high school, unprotected <b>anal</b> <b>intercourse,</b> recent STD symptoms, and incorrect knowledge about routes of transmission.|$|E
