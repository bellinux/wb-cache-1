2500|$|Westward Ho! had two {{platforms}} of 320 feet {{length and}} one foot <b>above</b> <b>rail</b> level, platform lighting, a passing loop of 8 chains allowing three coach trains to pass, a ticket office with waiting rooms and toilet, an 8-lever signal box and a 2-lever ground frame; a waiting room, refreshment room, bookstall, level crossing gates and a Concert Hall called the Station Hall. A siding {{ran to the}} Westward Ho! Gas Works. It was controlled by a two-lever ground frame, which was released by a key attached to the Westward Ho! to Appledore section of the train staff.|$|E
2500|$|The chief {{competitor}} of {{both these}} couplers, more popular among serious modellers, was the Magne-Matic, a magnetically released knuckle coupler developed by Keith and Dale Edwards, and manufactured by Kadee, a company they started. While they closely resemble miniature Janney couplers, they are somewhat different mechanically, with the knuckle pivoting {{from the center}} of the coupler head, rather than from the side. A steel pin, designed to resemble an air brake hose, allows the couplers to be released magnetically; the design of the coupler head prevents this from happening unless the train is stopped or reversed with a mated pair of couplers directly over an uncoupling magnet. An earlier, mechanically tripped version of the design had a straight pin extending down from the knuckle itself, which engaged a diamond-shaped mechanical [...] "ramp" [...] between the rails, which had to be raised <b>above</b> <b>rail</b> height when uncoupling was desired.|$|E
50|$|In Canada, only Montreal's Central Station and Quebec's Gare du Palais {{have high}} level {{platforms}} at 48 in <b>above</b> top of <b>rail.</b> Almost everywhere else, the platforms are 8 in <b>above</b> the <b>rail.</b>|$|R

2500|$|In 1936 six {{lightweight}} Wairarapa railcars, RM 4-9, {{were introduced}} between Palmerston North, Masterton and Wellington. [...] They were {{specifically designed for}} the Incline, and were built at the Hutt Workshops. They were named after historic Maori canoes: Maahunui, Mahuhu, Mamari, Matahourua, Mataatua and Arai-te-Uru. [...] Initially powered by [...] Leyland petrol engines, they were upgraded after several years to [...] diesel engines. [...] They had a single rear driving axle with 38½" [...] (978 mm) diameter wheels, necessitated by {{the need for the}} axle and final drive unit to have sufficient clearance above the Incline’s centre rail. [...] Because of the large rear wheels the floor of the passenger compartment was 52½" [...] (1334 mm) <b>above</b> <b>rail</b> level, more than [...] higher than normal. [...] They were rated for a maximum speed of [...] and expected to climb the Incline at 15-17mph, but actually managed only 10–12mph. They were withdrawn in 1955 when the Incline closed.|$|E

50|$|Since {{electrification}} generally predated double stacking in Europe and New Zealand, {{the overhead}} catenary {{is too low}} to accommodate it. Many bridges and tunnels are too low for double-stacking, by far too expensive to rebuild for this reason. However, India is building some freight-only corridors with the overhead wiring at 7.45 m <b>above</b> <b>rail,</b> which is high enough. In India (passenger), Pakistan (passenger), Finland, Russia, and Kazakhstan, 25 kV AC overhead wiring is at 6.5 m <b>above</b> <b>rail.</b>|$|E

50|$|Power was {{supplied}} at 480 V 60 Hz AC, in a corner-grounded Delta configuration, {{with the}} guide rail {{serving as the}} ground leg {{and the other two}} phases supplied on separate <b>rails</b> <b>above</b> the ground/guidance <b>rail.</b> The AC power was converted on board to power two 60 horsepower DC electric motors. The system used regenerative braking, converting the energy back through the DC motors to AC into the lines. Another <b>rail,</b> <b>above</b> the power <b>rails,</b> carried multiplexed frequency 'tones' that were decoded by the vehicles on-board controller into a 3-of-5 command sequence that was used to control all vehicle movement and station cycle functions. The heart of the on-board controller was a DEC PDP-8 minicomputer which interfaced with various vehicle subsystems via dual-redundant fail-safe vital relay logic.|$|R

50|$|There are {{substantial}} differences in platform height between eastern and southern/western rail systems, intercity and commuter rail. Eastern US rail stations serving the Northeast Corridor from Washington DC to Boston, have a platform height standard of 48 in <b>above</b> top of <b>rail.</b> Most intercity stations, {{particularly in the}} southern/western United States, use 8 in platforms, while southern/western US commuter rail systems use 25 in <b>above</b> top of <b>rail</b> platform heights.
