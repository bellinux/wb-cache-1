5|$|Sorabji first {{expressed}} interest in becoming a music critic in 1914, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> contributing criticism to The New Age in 1924, after it had published some of his letters to the editor. By 1930, Sorabji had become disillusioned with concert life and developed a growing interest in gramophone recordings, believing that he would eventually lose all reason to attend concerts. In 1945 he stopped providing regular reviews and only occasionally submitted his writings to correspondence columns in various journals. While his earlier writings reflect a contempt for the music world in general—from its businessmen to its performers—his later reviews {{tend to be more}} detailed and less caustic.|$|E
5|$|The Chief of Engineers, Major General Eugene Reybold, {{selected}} Colonel James C. Marshall to {{head the}} Army's {{part of the project}} in June 1942. Marshall created a liaison office in Washington, D.C., but established his temporary headquarters on the 18th floor of 270 Broadway in New York, where he could draw on administrative support from the Corps of Engineers' North Atlantic Division. It was close to the Manhattan office of Stone & Webster, the principal project contractor, and to Columbia University. He had permission to draw on his former command, the Syracuse District, for staff, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> with Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Nichols, who became his deputy.|$|E

5|$|On July 13, 2014, Lin was traded, {{along with}} a 2015 first and second round pick, to the Los Angeles Lakers in {{exchange}} for the rights to Serhiy Lishchuk. The Rockets made the move to clear cap space in their attempt to sign free agent Chris Bosh. The Lakers owed Lin $15 million for 2014–15, the final year of his contract, but only $8.3 million counted against their salary cap. His role was undefined with the Lakers, who were just 21–61 in his only season with the team. Lin moved into the starting lineup late in the preseason after an injury to Ronnie Price, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> the first 20 games of the season. However, he struggled in coach Byron Scott's offense, which was based on the methodical player and ball movement of the Princeton offense, while Lin was most comfortable dominating the ball while attacking off the pick-and-roll as he did in New York and Houston.|$|E

He addressed the soldiers and congratulated them on their victory and then proposed a new war, against the Galatian Gauls of Asia Minor. The pretext he used for the invasion was that the Galatians had supplied soldiers to the Seleucid army at the Battle of Magnesia. The principal reason for the invasion was Manlius' desire to seize the wealth of the Galatians, who had become rich from plundering their neighbours, and to gain glory for himself.|$|E

5|$|McBreen {{made his}} debut for the Mariners in 1–0 away win over Melbourne Heart on 5 August 2010, {{in which he}} was {{substituted}} for Nik Mrdja in the 90th minute. His first goal came nearly a month later when heading in Matt Simon's cross in the 50th minute of a 2–0 home win over Melbourne Victory on 3 September 2010. McBreen was sent off {{for the first time since}} returning to Australia with a second yellow card during the stoppage time of a 5–1 home defeat to Brisbane Roar on 28 November 2010, and returned from suspension as a 52nd-minute substitute for Adam Kwasnik in a 1–1 draw away to Perth Glory on 12 December 2010. With a second-placed finish in the 2010–11 A-League table the Mariners qualified for the finals series, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> in their 4–2 aggregate defeat to Brisbane Roar in the major semi-final and their 1–0 win over Gold Coast United in the preliminary final. McBreen came on as a 72nd-minute substitute for Simon in the 2011 A-League Grand Final at Lang Park on 13 March 2011, and after a 2–2 extra time draw he missed one of the penalty kicks as the Mariners lost the shoot-out 4–2. He made 31 appearances and scored five goals for the Mariners in 2010–11.|$|E
5|$|Narayan {{moved to}} Mysore {{to live with}} his family when his father was {{transferred}} to the Maharajah's College High School. The well-stocked library at the school, as well as his father's own, fed his reading habit, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> writing as well. After completing high school, Narayan failed the university entrance examination and spent a year at home reading and writing; he subsequently passed the examination in 1926 and joined Maharaja College of Mysore. It took Narayan four years to obtain his bachelor's degree, a year longer than usual. After being persuaded by a friend that taking a master's degree (M.A.) would kill his interest in literature, he briefly held a job as a school teacher; however, he quit in protest when the headmaster of the school asked him to substitute for the physical training master. The experience made Narayan realise that the only career for him was in writing, and he decided to stay at home and write novels. His first published work was a book review of Development of Maritime Laws of 17th-Century England. Subsequently, he started writing the occasional local interest story for English newspapers and magazines. Although the writing did not pay much (his income for the first year was nine rupees and twelve annas), he had a regular life and few needs, and his family and friends respected and supported his unorthodox choice of career. In 1930, Narayan wrote his first novel, Swami and Friends, an effort ridiculed by his uncle and rejected by a string of publishers. With this book, Narayan created Malgudi, a town that creatively reproduced the social sphere of the country; while it ignored the limits imposed by colonial rule, it also grew with the various socio-political changes of British and post-independence India.|$|E
5|$|Odubade was {{assigned}} the number 7 shirt {{ahead of his}} first game for Oxford. He subsequently made his debut a day after signing for the club, starting in a 3–0 defeat against Rushden & Diamonds at Nene Park, but was substituted after just 33 minutes with Rushden three goals up. He was an unused substitute in the club's next two matches, but returned to first-team action in Oxford's 1–1 draw against Cheltenham Town, coming on as a 59th-minute substitute. In the club's following game, he scored his first goal for Oxford in a 2–1 loss away to Wycombe Wanderers, having come on at half-time. He started one further match against Stockport County, but was an unused substitute for the club's last two matches of the 2005–06 season. Odubade played a total of 8 games throughout Oxford's 2005–06 campaign, scoring once, as the club were relegated to the Conference National. Under the new management of Jim Smith, Odubade started the 2006–07 campaign by appearing as a 60th-minute substitute in Oxford's 2–0 win against Halifax Town. Three days later, Odubade came on as a half-time substitute against Dagenham & Redbridge, and scored the only goal {{of the game in}} the 57th minute. He also scored in Oxford's 5–1 home victory against Northwich Victoria, again appearing as a substitute. He scored the winner in the club's 2–1 win against St Albans City, as well as scoring in Oxford's 5–1 away win at Forest Green Rovers in October 2006. Odubade's first 15 appearances of the 2006–07 season were made as a substitute, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> his first game of the season in Oxford's 1–1 draw against Altrincham. A week later, he was in the starting line-up once more, scoring twice in Oxford's 3–0 win against Cambridge United at the Abbey Stadium. He provided assists for goals in draws against Stevenage and Cambridge United respectively, before scoring in a 1–1 draw against Aldershot Town in February 2007. He scored Oxford's first goal after 11 minutes in the club's 3–1 away win against Tamworth. A brace against Dagenham & Redbridge in a 2–2 draw took Odubade's tally to 10 goals for the season. His 11th of the season followed shortly after, scoring a headed goal in a 2–0 away victory at St Albans City. Oxford failed to gain promotion back to the Football League after losing on penalties to Exeter City, although Odubade scored and assisted another during the two ties. Consequently, he was voted Oxford's Player of the Year {{at the end of the}} season. Odubade scored a total of 12 goals in 46 games during the campaign.|$|E

5|$|Sebastian Vettel's {{dominant}} run was derailed in Abu Dhabi {{when his}} car {{was found to have}} insufficient fuel after qualifying and he was subsequently moved {{to the back of the}} grid. As Lewis Hamilton led the race away from the start, Vettel started from pit lane and took advantage of a chaotic opening corner that saw Nico Hülkenberg, Paul di Resta, Romain Grosjean and Bruno Senna tangle; Hülkenberg was forced out, while di Resta and Grosjean pitted with damage. Vettel began to round up the HRTs, Marussias and Caterhams, but his early progress came at the expense of his front wing endplate when he made contact with Senna at Turn 8 switchback. He chose not to pit for the time being, as the race was interrupted by the intervention of the safety car. Nico Rosberg, who had been forced to pit with damage to his front wing, was in the process of overtaking Narain Karthikeyan as Karthikeyan's car began to fail and the Indian quickly slowed. Rosberg, caught unawares by Karthikeyan's troubles, was launched over the back of the HRT and into the barrier. During the safety car period, Vettel was forced to pit when he swerved to avoid Daniel Ricciardo and crashed into the polystyrene bollard marking the start of the DRS zone, further damaging his wing. Red Bull Racing took the opportunity to pit him early, with the downside being that Vettel would have to do 42 laps on the soft tyre when supplier Pirelli predicted they could only do 36. Meanwhile, Hamilton suffered another mechanical failure while leading the race, and was once again forced out, handing the lead to Kimi Räikkönen while Fernando Alonso inherited second. Vettel began to work his way through the field again, but was forced to make a second stop when his tyres started losing grip. He was saved by the second appearance of the safety car moments later, brought about when di Resta forced Sergio Pérez wide; as Pérez rejoined the circuit, he cut back across the front of Grosjean and the two made contact, which in turn forced Grosjean into the path of Mark Webber. Grosjean and Webber retired, whilst Pérez was given a stop-go penalty. When racing resumed, Räikkönen began to rebuild his lead over Alonso, who was being harried by Jenson Button; Button himself was being harried by Vettel in fourth. Button and Vettel's duel allowed Alonso to break free, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> chasing down Räikkönen in the last five laps. Räikkönen held on to secure his – and Lotus F1's – first victory of the season. Alonso was second, while Vettel caught and passed Button to complete the podium, keeping a ten-point championship lead in the process. With both Alonso and Vettel finishing on the podium with him, Räikkönen's win was not enough to keep him in contention for the World Drivers' Championship, leaving the title to be fought out between Alonso and Vettel over the final two races of the season.|$|E
5|$|The {{meeting on}} 17 January was crowded. Many {{attendees}} were not electors, as franchise {{was attached to}} land ownership in excess of £50, or yearly rental over £10, and the resulting roll was only about 160 names long, including absentee owners in England. There had been rumours beforehand that somebody would come forward to oppose Sewell. William Thomson was elected to chair the meeting. Sewell spoke at length about various issues: {{that he should be}} elected because of the service that he had given Canterbury as their representative when in financial crisis, that he even delayed his departure to England to resolve the issues, that he had no conflict of interest with the steam ship company that provided New Zealand's postal service with England, {{that he did not have}} land holdings in the North Island more valuable than holdings in Canterbury, that he gave qualified support to the Lyttelton Rail Tunnel project and he gave his reasons for leaving the Stafford Ministry so soon after his return to the colony last year. He disagreed with Stafford's government on some issues. The two most important disagreements were land policy, where Sewell wanted the land revenue to be retained by the provincial governments, rather than the southern provinces pay a high proportion of their revenue to enable purchase of land in the north, and native policy, where Sewell predicted that the land policy being pursued would result in strong conflict with Māori; in fact, the First Taranaki War started in March 1860. As a solution, Sewell suggested the possible separation of the North Island and the South Island into separate countries; this was the first time, as far as the editor of the Lyttelton Times was aware, that such a suggestion had been made in public by a politician. The politician who is today known to have favoured separation is Julius Vogel, <b>and</b> <b>he</b> <b>started</b> campaigning for this idea in 1862. The Lyttelton Times argued, against the objection of many, that such an idea had merit for further consideration.|$|E
