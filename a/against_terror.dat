25|$|The Mumbai attack also {{triggered}} {{a chain of}} citizens' movements across India.

The gathering of citizens at the Gateway of India in Mumbai was unprecedented and historic. From India Gate and Jantar Mantar in New Delhi to marketplaces and street corners all across the country, India witnessed candlelight vigils by the common people.
