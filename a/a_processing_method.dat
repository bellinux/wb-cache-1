5000|$|Homogenization is <b>a</b> <b>processing</b> <b>method</b> that is {{utilized}} {{to improve the}} quality of the sour cream in regards to the color, consistency, creaming stability, and creaminess of the cultured cream. [...] During homogenization larger fat globules within the cream are broken down into smaller sized globules to allow an even suspension within the system. At this point in the processing the milk fat globules and the casein proteins are not interacting with each other, there is repulsion occurring. The mixture is homogenized, under high pressure homogenization above 130 bar (unit) and at a high temperature of 60 °C. The formation of the small globules (below 2 microns in size) previously mentioned allows for reducing a cream layer formation and increases the viscosity of the product. There is also a reduction in the separation of whey, enhancing the white color of the sour cream.|$|E

5000|$|This is {{the method}} used for remote sensing the {{disasters}}. Detection of disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and explosions are quite complex in previous days and range of detection is inappropriate. But, it came to possibilities by using Multi temporal visualization of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. But to obtain the good SAR images perfect spatial registration and very precise calibration are necessary to specify changes that have occurred. Calibration of SAR is very complex and also a sensitive problem. Possibly errors may occur after calibration that involves data fusion and visualization process. Traditional image pre-processing cannot be used here due to the on-Gaussian of radar back scattering, but <b>a</b> <b>processing</b> <b>method</b> called [...] "cross calibration/normalization" [...] is used to solve this problem. The application generates a single disaster image called [...] "fast-ready disaster map" [...] from multitemporal SAR images. These maps are generated without user interaction and helps in providing immediate first aid to the people. This process also provides image enhancement and comparison between numerous images using data fusion and visualization process. This proposed processing includes filtering, histogram truncation and equalization steps. The process also helps in identifying the permanent waters and other classes by combined composition of pre-disaster and post-disaster images into a color image for better identity.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe surface {{magnetic}} resonance method (SNMR) {{is a valuable}} technique for hydrogeological studies, since it provides information on the porosity, hydraulic conductivity and water content. However the bad signal-to-noise ratio often encountered limits its application range. In particular, in suburban areas, strong powerline harmonics severely degrade the SNMR signals. The powerline fundamental frequency is subject to small variations in time that make high order harmonics filtering difficult using a classical notch filter without distorting the MRS signal. Harmonics cancellation using sinusoidal subtraction is an alternative, but requires a high accuracy of the instantaneous fundamental frequency value to be efficient. The power grid frequency being regulated we expect that the instantaneous frequency could be monitored with a good S/N ratio using a remote frequencemeter, synchronised with the SNMR device, and later used for processing. Based on this accurate instantaneous frequency measurement we developed <b>a</b> <b>processing</b> <b>method</b> based on the subtraction of a powerline harmonics model of constant amplitudes. We performed numerical experiments to quantify the efficiency of this method, and compare it with classical notch or multi-channel filtering. Studying real noise measurements, we encountered cases where harmonics amplitudes do not remains stable over time. We therefore proposed <b>a</b> <b>processing</b> <b>method</b> that include time-variant amplitudes in the powerline harmonics model. Amplitudes are modeled using a b-spline decomposition and estimated through an inversion procedure. A test on synthetic data is presented to assess the theoretical applicability of the method...|$|E
