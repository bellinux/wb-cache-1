40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of digital}} images {{has led to a}} growing problem how to organize these images {{in such a way that}} particular images can easily be retrieved or searched. Most images usually do not contain any meta-data that can be used for image retrieval or sorting. Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems use the query-by-example principle, which suffers from a number of limitations. If no query image is available, this technique cannot be used. In addition, useful sorting of images is not possible with CBIR systems. This paper presents an <b>automatic</b> image <b>sorting</b> technique that can help to organize large sets of images. Image retrieval can be accomplished by successively narrowing down the set of images by performing a consecutive image sorting and selection of image sub-sets.

40|$|A basic step {{to achieve}} a {{holistic}} recycling process for Construction and Demolition Waste (C&DW) is a relevant improvement in (<b>automatic)</b> <b>sorting</b> technologies. Hyperspectral- Imaging (HSI) is an outstanding candidate to support the process. Currently the biggest challenges with regard to C&DW detection cover the need of overlapping VIS, NIR and SWIR hyperspectral images in time and space, in particular for selectively recognition of contaminated particles. In the study on hand a new approach for HSI is described by exploiting VIS-NIR-SWIR spectral information in real time (350 Hz full frame rates). The contribution focuses on a development path for an industrial implementation in <b>automatic</b> <b>sorting</b> and separation lines for C&DW recycling. The main target is on the on-line detection and sorting of gypsum and stony items with organic contamination to close the recycling loops of gypsum (plaster to plaster), concrete (concrete to concrete) and ceramic materials (brick/ceramics to brick/ceramics) because of their exceptional potential for increasing sustainability by conserving construction resources...|$|E
50|$|Before recycling, most {{plastics}} are sorted {{according to}} their resin type. In the past, plastic reclaimers used the resin identification code (RIC), a method of categorization of polymer types, which {{was developed by the}} Society of the Plastics Industry in 1988. Polyethylene terephthalate, commonly referred to as PET, for instance, has a resin code of 1. Most plastic reclaimers do not rely on the RIC now; they use <b>automatic</b> <b>sort</b> systems to identify the resin, ranging from manual sorting and picking of plastic materials to mechanized automation processes that involve shredding, sieving, separation by rates of density i.e. air, liquid, or magnetic, and complex spectrophotometric distribution technologies e.g. UV/VIS, NIR, Laser, etc. Some plastic products are also separated by color before they are recycled. The plastic recyclables are then shredded. These shredded fragments then undergo processes to eliminate impurities like paper labels. This material is melted and often extruded into the form of pellets which are then used to manufacture other products.|$|R
