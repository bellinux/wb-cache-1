The tasks were designed to induce a strong, negative, mental attitude in the subjects. Once the subjects had done the tasks, the experimenters asked one group of subjects to speak with another subject (an actor), and persuade that impostor-subject that the tedious tasks were interesting and engaging. One group of subjects were paid twenty dollars ($20); a second group were paid one dollar ($1); and the control group were not asked {{to speak with the}} imposter-subject.|$|E
40|$|This {{classroom}} {{action research}} was aimed {{to find out}} if the use of Cooperative Integrated Reading and Composition (CIRC) Method could improve the writing ability of the second year students of SMAN 4 Pekanbaru. The participants were 31 students. The procedures applied were: (a) dividing students into pairs, (b) <b>asking</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> read to each other the story, (c) <b>asking</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> correct their teammates 2 ̆ 7 error, (d) <b>asking</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> answer the questions related to the story in team, (e) <b>asking</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> pronounce the difficult words listing, (f) <b>asking</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> find the meaning of the difficult words listing, (g) <b>asking</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> write a draft composition of narrative texts related to the passage, (h) <b>asking</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> edit one 2 ̆ 7 s another 2 ̆ 7 s work by using peer editing, (i) <b>asking</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> finish their writing based on their teammates 2 ̆ 7 revision. The data was collected by using of tests, observation sheets, and field notes. The level of achievement in this research was 85, based on the standard minimum criteria of achievement of English subject in SMAN 4 Pekanbaru. The research finding showed that the implementation of applying CIRC as the teaching method could improve students 2 ̆ 7 writing ability both at the first, second, and third cycle. Based on the data analysis that is obtained, the students 2 ̆ 7 score was improve from 60, 32 in the pre-test, to 74, 62 in post-test 1, to 83, 29 in post-test 2, and up to 87, 68 in post-test 3. Therefore, the implementation of CIRC method could improve students 2 ̆ 7 writing ability of the second year students of SMAN 4 Pekanbaru...|$|R

25|$|The {{anterior}} cingulate cortex activity increases when errors {{occur and}} are being monitored as well as having behavioral conflicts with the self-concept {{as a form of}} higher-level thinking. A study was done to test the prediction that the left frontal cortex would have increased activity. University students had to write a paper depending on if they were assigned to a high-choice or low-choice condition. The low-choice condition required student to write about supporting a 10% increase in tuition at their university. The point of this condition was to see how significant the counterchoice may affect a person's ability to cope. The high-choice condition <b>asked</b> <b>students</b> <b>to</b> write in favor of tuition increase as if it was their choice and that it was completely voluntary. EEG was used to analyze students before writing the essay as dissonance is at its highest during this time (Beauvois and Joule, 1996). High-choice condition participants showed a higher level of the left frontal cortex than the low-choice participants. Results have shown that the initial experience of dissonance can be apparent in the {{anterior cingulate cortex}}, then the left frontal cortex is activated, which also activates the approach motivational system to reduce anger.|$|E
