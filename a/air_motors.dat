5000|$|When {{lubricant}} pumps {{were first}} invented, {{they were used}} to pump oil and lightweight greases. Overtime, lubricant viscosity increased and lubricant pumps were stressed to the limits. The higher viscosity lubricants were required because cars were built to perform at higher RPM (Conley). One outcome of attempting to pump heavier materials was that seals would fail and the lubricant would leak into the <b>air</b> <b>motor.</b> By divorcing the pump tube from the <b>air</b> <b>motor,</b> a seal failure would simply cause grease to be leaked onto the ground, not into the <b>air</b> <b>motor.</b> Also, the new design allowed for easier repairs of the pump or the packings which were being [...] "eaten away" [...] by new materials and chemistry affecting the industry.

5000|$|The Capitol, North O Street and South Washington Railway was {{a street}} railway company in Washington, D.C. from 1875 to 1898. It was {{the sixth and}} final company to start during the horse car era. It {{operated}} on a loop, or [...] "belt," [...] around downtown and the National Mall. For that reason, and because of its long name, it was known colloquially as the Belt Railway. It {{changed its name to}} the Belt Railway in 1893. It expanded north and south on 11th street west to the boundaries of the city. In 1896 it attempted to use compressed <b>air</b> <b>motors</b> instead of electricity, a decision that sent them into receivership. In 1898, the company was purchased by the Anacostia and Potomac River Railroad and the company ceased to exist.|$|E
50|$|A type of {{pneumatic}} motor, {{known as}} a rotary vane motor, uses air to produce rotational motion to a shaft. The rotating element is a slotted rotor which is mounted on a drive shaft. Each slot of the rotor is fitted with a freely sliding rectangular vane. The vanes are extended to the housing walls using springs, cam action, or air pressure, depending on the motor design. Air is pumped through the motor input which pushes on the vanes creating the rotational motion of the central shaft. Rotation speeds can vary between 100 and 25,000 rpm depending on several factors which include the amount of air pressure at the motor inlet and {{the diameter of the}} housing. One application for vane-type <b>air</b> <b>motors</b> is to start large industrial diesel or natural gas engines. Stored energy in the form of compressed air, nitrogen or natural gas enters the sealed motor chamber and exerts pressure against the vanes of a rotor. This causes the rotor to turn at high speed. Because the engine flywheel requires a great deal of torque to start the engine, reduction gears are used. Reduction gears create high torque levels with the lower amounts of energy input. These reduction gears allow for sufficient torque to be generated by the engine flywheel while it is engaged by the pinion gear of the air motor or air starter.|$|E
50|$|Galling is {{adhesive}} {{wear that}} {{is caused by}} microscopic transfer of material between metallic surfaces, during transverse motion (sliding). It occurs frequently whenever metal surfaces are in contact, sliding against each other, especially with poor lubrication. It often occurs in high load, low speed applications, but also in high-speed applications with very little load. Galling is a common problem in sheet metal forming, bearings and pistons in engines, hydraulic cylinders, <b>air</b> <b>motors,</b> and many other industrial operations. Galling is distinct from gouging or scratching in that it involves the visible transfer of material as it is adhesively pulled (mechanically spalled) from one surface, leaving it stuck to {{the other in the}} form of a raised lump (gall). Unlike other forms of wear, galling is usually not a gradual process, but occurs quickly and spreads rapidly as the raised lumps induce more galling.It can often occur in screws and bolts, causing the threads to seize and tear free from either the fastener or the hole. In extreme cases, the bolt may lock up to the point where all turning force is used by the friction, which can lead to breakage of the fastener or the tool turning it. Threaded inserts of hardened steel are often used in metals like aluminium or stainless steel that can gall easily.|$|E

40|$|Hundreds of {{students}} each year enroll in IME 143 or IME 144, freshman-level machining classes, and complete an <b>air</b> <b>motor</b> {{to demonstrate the}} skills they have acquired {{on a variety of}} manufacturing processes. The <b>air</b> <b>motor,</b> however is useful only as a teaching tool in the classroom; once the students bring them home, the <b>air</b> <b>motor</b> becomes little more than a trophy at best. With the capabilities of the machining lab, a final project can be developed that can have a benefit to people in need while maintaining educational value. This project details a process plan for a manual water pump. The pump can be donated for use in developing countries where access to clean water is still in desperate need. The process for manufacturing the water pump had to be deconstructed into specific machining processes and balanced appropriately between the machines available to the classes. The machining lab has a number of different machines that enable students to use 14 different processes. Unlike a production environment, all processes have to be used and balanced to make use of lab time. This often meant using sub-optimal processes and/or procedures. The critical benchmark for implementing the water pump into the curriculum is the cost. Students in IME 143 / 144 pay lab fees, which cover the cost of materials for the quarter. The fees are $ 10 for IME 143 and $ 50 for IME 144. Based on rough estimates from these lab fees, the actual cost of the <b>air</b> <b>motor</b> is between $ 10 and $ 20. As designed currently, the water pump has a material cost of about $ 30. However, this project is larger and more complex. It is recommended that one pump be made for every two students bringing the per student cost to about $ 15, within the cost range of the <b>air</b> <b>motor...</b>|$|R
50|$|By 1888, Washington was {{expanding}} {{north of}} Boundary Street NW {{into the hills}} of Washington Heights and Petworth. Boundary Street was becoming such a misnomer that in 1890 it was renamed Florida Avenue. Climbing the hills to the new {{parts of the city}} was difficult for horses, but electric streetcars could do it easily. In the year following the successful demonstration of the Richmond streetcar, four electric streetcar companies were incorporated in Washington D.C. The Eckington and Soldiers' Home Railway was the first to charter, on June 19, 1888, and started operation on October 17. Its tracks started at 7th Street and New York Avenue NW, east of Mount Vernon Square, and traveled 2.5 miles to the Eckington Car Barn at 4th and T Streets NE via Boundary Street NE, Eckington Place NE, R Street NE, 3rd Street NE and T Street NE. Another line ran up 4th Street NE to Michigan Avenue NE. A one-week pass cost $1.25. In 1889, the line was extended along T Street NE, 2nd Street NE and V Street NE to Glenwood Cemetery, but the extension proved unprofitable and was closed in 1894. At the same time, an extension was built along Michigan Avenue NE to the B&O railroad tracks. In 1895, the company removed its overhead trolley lines in accordance with its charter and attempted to replace them with batteries. These proved too costly and the company replaced them with horses in the central city. In 1896, Congress directed the Eckington and Soldier's Home to try compressed <b>air</b> <b>motors</b> and to substitute underground electric power for all its horse and overhead trolley lines in the city. The compressed-air motors were a failure and in 1899 the company switched to the standard underground electric power conduit.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — The paper {{presents}} {{a mathematical model}} for vane-type <b>air</b> <b>motors</b> with arbitrary number of vanes. The paper starts from the working principles of the air motor and modeling approach. Then the mechanical geometry structure of <b>air</b> <b>motors</b> is analyzed in order to derive a generic mathematical description of the air motor. A complete dynamic process of the air motor system is derived based on the mechanical structure, orifice and other physics theory. The simulation results are presented with a typical set of air motor parameters. Due {{to the nature of}} the motor structure, the chamber volume changes are discontinuous which leads to discontinuous chamber pressure variations. The characteristics of the discontinuity present difficulties for applying advanced control theory to air motor control. Therefore, further approximations are carried out and the comparison of dynamic responses between the original model and the approximated model indicated that the approximation is accurate enough to be acceptable for control strategy development...|$|E
40|$|In industry, {{pneumatic}} actuating {{systems have}} been widely employed due to their distinct advantages. However, pneumatic actuators have rather low energy efficiency, around 23 - 30 % in general. The work described in this thesis is to study potential strategies for improvement of pneumatic actuator energy efficiency by recovering the exhaust air energy using a scroll-type air motor. The scroll-type air motor {{is a relatively new}} technology, and its unique compact structure determines that it can work at high energy efficiency. The mathematical models for vane-type <b>air</b> <b>motors</b> with arbitrary number of vanes and for scroll-type <b>air</b> <b>motors</b> are derived, which cover their thermodynamic process and responses. A complete mathematical model for the pneumatic-electrical system is developed. The simulation studies are carried for initial investigation of the working process for the electrical-pneumatic system and its dynamic responses. A closed-loop control strategy is proved to be essential. An experimental test rig for this system has been built in the laboratory, and the test results are described. The simulation study and the laboratory test results demonstrate that the proposed system is realistic for energy recovery while a proper control strategy is imposed and the overall system energy efficiency can be improved under reasonable constraint conditions.

50|$|On larger diesel {{generators}} {{found in}} large shore installations and especially on ships, a pneumatic starting gear is used.

The drum is offset inside a round casing so that the inlet air for starting is admitted at the area where the drum and vanes form a small chamber compared to the others. The compressed air can only expand by rotating the drum, which allows the small chamber to become larger and puts another one of the cambers in the air inlet. The <b>air</b> <b>motor</b> spins much too fast to be used directly on the flywheel of the engine; instead a large gearing reduction, such as a planetary gear, is used to lower the output speed.

40|$|Abstract — It {{is now a}} banal {{truth that}} the {{environment}} is being subjected to plenty of environmental hazards. These are attributable to pollution that has completely overwhelmed the environment {{which in turn is}} also responsible for bringing about atrocious changes to the environment. The principle reason behind this change is increased carbon emission. Every day, a huge amount of carbon is released in the air because of burning fuel which results in Global Warming. People are gradually realizing this concern and have gradually started to use alternative sources of energy. This paper is about a design of an application which will help facilitate a revolution in Bangladesh. In this design Four Vane <b>Air</b> <b>Motors</b> act as the prime mover. Vane <b>Air</b> <b>Motors</b> contain vanes within an air tight body onto which air at high pressure is passed. The vanes are directly connected to a rotating shaft and hence any force on the vanes causes a torque, which can rotate the shaft helping to drive any load connected to it. Not only does this solve an age old question of finding an energy efficient fuel source, it also proves that efficient fuel can also be environment friendly.

40|$|Advances in {{electric}} motors, electronics, {{and control}} systems have enhanced the capability and drivability of electric power mobility devices {{over the last}} 60 years. Yet, battery technologies used in powered mobility devices (PMDs) have not kept pace. Recent advances in pneumatic technology, primarily the high torque, low speed design of rotary piston <b>air</b> <b>motors,</b> directly align {{with the needs of}} PMD. Pneumatic technology has advantages over battery-powered technology, including lighter weight, lower operating costs, decreased environmental impact, better reliability, and increased safety. Two prototypes were created that incorporated rotary piston <b>air</b> <b>motors,</b> high-pressure air tanks, and air-pressure regulators. Prototype 1 was created by modifying an existing electric PMD. Range tests were performed to determine the feasibility of pneumatic technology and the optimal combination of components to allow the longest range possible at acceptable speeds over ideal condition s. Using a 1. 44 L air tank for feasibility testing, prototype 1 was capable of traveling 800 m, which confirmed the feasibility of pneumatic technology usage in PMDs. Prototype 2 was designed based on the testing results from prototype 1. After further optimization of prototype 2, the average maximum range was 3, 150 m. Prototype 2 is up to 28. 3 % lighter than an equivalent size electric PMD and can be fully recharged in approximately 2 minutes. It decreases the cost of PMDs by approximately 1, 500, because batteries {{do not need to be}} replaced over the lifetime of the device.
