5|$|SCI {{is present}} in about 2% of all cases of blunt force trauma. Anyone who has {{undergone}} force sufficient to cause a thoracic spinal injury is <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> other injuries also. In 44% of SCI cases, other serious injuries are sustained at the same time; 14% of SCI patients also suffer head trauma or facial trauma. Other commonly associated injuries include chest trauma, abdominal trauma, pelvic fractures, and long bone fractures.|$|E
5|$|Tuberculosis {{prevention}} and control efforts rely {{primarily on the}} vaccination of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases. The World Health Organization has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, and a small decrease in case numbers. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends screening people who are <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> latent tuberculosis with either tuberculin skin tests or interferon-gamma release assays.|$|E
50|$|Veterans {{under the}} age of 25 are <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> PTSD than {{veterans}} older than 25. Younger veterans with severe PTSD are <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> metabolic syndrome and suicide.|$|R
40|$|Can statin therapy {{be used in}} hyperlipidemic {{patients}} with baseline transaminase elevations? Although <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> mild-moderate increases in transaminases, {{patients with}} elevated baseline transaminase values are not <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> severe elevations compared with patients normal at baseline (SOR: C, disease-oriented outcomes) ...|$|R

5|$|The Mantoux {{tuberculin}} {{skin test}} {{is often used}} to screen people <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> TB. Those who have been previously immunized may have a false-positive test result. The test may be falsely negative in those with sarcoidosis, Hodgkin's lymphoma, malnutrition, and most notably, active tuberculosis. Interferon gamma release assays, on a blood sample, are recommended in those who are positive to the Mantoux test. These are not affected by immunization or most environmental mycobacteria, so they generate fewer false-positive results. However, they are affected by M. szulgai, M. marinum, and M. kansasii. IGRAs may increase sensitivity when used in addition to the skin test, but may be less sensitive than the skin test when used alone.|$|E

25|$|The {{extended}} Lussier {{family had}} been involved for years in trying to help him, and arranged for Weise to have care and psychiatric treatment for depression. Dr. Leslie Lundt, a psychiatrist, has commented that a parent's suicide put individuals <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> psychological problems, as does alcohol abuse in the family.|$|E
25|$|While {{there are}} no {{absolute}} contraindications for ECT, there is increased risk for patients who have unstable or severe cardiovascular conditions or aneurysms; who have recently had a stroke; who have increased intracranial pressure (for instance, due to a solid brain tumor), or who have severe pulmonary conditions, or who are generally <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> receiving anesthesia.|$|E
25|$|Some have blamed lenders for inappropriately {{approving}} {{loans for}} subprime applicants, despite signs {{that people with}} poor scores were <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> not repaying the loan. By not considering whether the person could afford the payments {{if they were to}} increase in the future, many of these loans may have put the borrowers at risk of default.|$|E

25|$|Apart from {{physical}} wounds or starvation, {{a large percentage}} of refugees develop symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or depression. These long-term mental problems can severely impede the functionality of the person in everyday situations; it makes matters even worse for displaced persons who are confronted with a new environment and challenging situations. They are also <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> suicide.|$|E
25|$|Estrogen {{replacement}} therapy {{such as the}} birth control pill, has been used since the condition was described in 1938 to promote development of secondary sexual characteristics. Estrogens are crucial for maintaining good bone integrity, cardiovascular health and tissue health. Women with Turner Syndrome {{who do not have}} spontaneous puberty and who are not treated with estrogen are <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> osteoporosis and heart conditions.|$|E
25|$|Patients with hip {{fractures}} are <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> future fractures including hip, wrist, shoulder, and spine. After {{treatment of}} the acute fracture, the risk of future fractures should be addressed. Currently, only 1 in 4 patients after a hip fracture receives treatment and work up for osteoporosis, the underlying cause {{of most of the}} fractures. Current treatment standards include the starting of a bisphosphonate to reduce future fracture risk by up to 50%.|$|E

25|$|AICD: Patients with NYHA class II, III or IV, and LVEF of 35% (without a QRS requirement) {{may also}} benefit from an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), a device that is proven to reduce all-cause {{mortality}} by 23% compared to placebo in patients who were already optimally managed on drug therapy. Patients with severe cardiomyopathy are <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> sudden cardiac death due to ventricular dysrhythmias. Although ICDs deliver electrical shocks to resynchronize heart rhythm which are potentially distressing to the patient, {{they have not been}} shown to affect quality of life.|$|E
25|$|Non-medical use of {{fentanyl}} {{by individuals}} without opiate tolerance {{can be very}} dangerous and has resulted in numerous deaths. Even those with opiate tolerances are <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> overdoses. Once the fentanyl is in the user's system, {{it is extremely difficult}} to stop its course {{because of the nature of}} absorption. Illicitly synthesized fentanyl powder has also appeared on the United States market. Because of the extremely high strength of pure fentanyl powder, it is very difficult to dilute appropriately, and often the resulting mixture may be far too strong and, therefore, very dangerous.|$|E
25|$|Complications with measles are {{relatively}} common, ranging from mild complications such as diarrhea to serious complications such as pneumonia (either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia), bronchitis (either direct viral bronchitis or secondary bacterial bronchitis), otitis media, acute brain inflammation (and very rarely SSPE—subacute sclerosing panencephalitis), and corneal ulceration (leading to corneal scarring). Complications are usually more severe in adults who catch the virus. The death {{rate in the}} 1920s was around 30% for measles pneumonia. People that are <b>at</b> <b>high</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> complications are: Infants and children aged <5 years, adults aged >20 years, pregnant women, and people with compromised immune systems, such as from leukemia and HIV infection.|$|E

50|$|Young {{workers are}} <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> {{occupational}} injury and face certain occupational hazards <b>at</b> a <b>higher</b> rate; this is generally {{due to their}} employment in high-risk industries. For example, in the United States, young people are injured at work at {{twice the rate of}} their older counterparts. These workers are also <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> motor vehicle accidents at work, due to less work experience, a lower use of seatbelts, and higher rates of distracted driving. To mitigate this risk, those under the age of 17 are restricted from certain types of driving, including transporting people and goods under certain circumstances.|$|R
50|$|Asian Americans are <b>at</b> <b>higher</b> <b>risk</b> <b>for</b> {{hepatitis}} B, liver cancer, tuberculosis, {{and lung}} cancer. The subgroup of Filipino Americans suffer health risks {{similar to that}} of African Americans and European Americans combined.|$|R
