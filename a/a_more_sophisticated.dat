5|$|After {{the success}} of Sputnik 1 in October 1957, Nikita Khrushchev, the Soviet leader, wanted a {{spacecraft}} launched on 7 November 1957, the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution. Construction had already started on <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> satellite, {{but it would not}} be ready until December; this satellite would later become Sputnik 3.|$|E
5|$|It's {{really a}} dance-off between <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> 'in-fashion' Destiny's Child versus a more 'street' Destiny's Child. And {{in the end}} a third Destiny's Child even more fierce takes over. It's {{a lot of hard}} work for us because we have to learn three {{routines}} for the same song. People will be shocked because it's different for us. They've never seen us really dance.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} years of the 1960s the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) {{considered}} new types of tactical transport aircraft to replace the RAAF's obsolete Douglas Dakotas. The Army wanted a simple and rugged aircraft that could be purchased immediately, and pressed for the acquisition of de Havilland Canada DHC-4 Caribous, but the RAAF regarded the Caribou as inadequate for the role and preferred <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> aircraft, leading to delays in the selection process.|$|E

5|$|On May 7, 2012, American {{officials}} {{claimed that}} they had thwarted another Al Qaeda plot that would have targeted a civilian passenger plane not unlike Northwest Airlines Flight 253. American officials stated that the attack would have involved <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> bomb, also planted in undergarments, {{and would have been}} deployed near the anniversary of the killing of Osama Bin Laden. Officials did not state whether any persons had been arrested or charged in their operation.|$|E
5|$|Polydopamine {{coatings}} {{can form}} on objects {{ranging in size}} from nanoparticles to large surfaces. Polydopamine layers have chemical properties that have the potential to be extremely useful, and numerous studies have examined their possible applications. At the simplest level, they can be used for protection against damage by light, or to form capsules for drug delivery. At <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> level, their adhesive properties may make them useful as substrates for biosensors or other biologically active macromolecules.|$|E
5|$|The Nile {{has been}} the {{lifeline}} of its region for much of human history. The fertile floodplain of the Nile gave humans {{the opportunity to develop}} a settled agricultural economy and <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated,</b> centralized society that became a cornerstone in the history of human civilization. Nomadic modern human hunter-gatherers began living in the Nile valley {{through the end of the}} Middle Pleistocene some 120,000 years ago. By the late Paleolithic period, the arid climate of Northern Africa became increasingly hot and dry, forcing the populations of the area to concentrate along the river region.|$|E

5|$|Aristotle, {{a student}} of Plato, {{observed}} an occultation of Mars by the Moon in 365 BCE. From this he concluded that Mars must lie further from the Earth than the Moon. He noted that other such occultations of stars and planets had been observed by the Egyptians and Babylonians. Aristotle used this observational {{evidence to support the}} Greek sequencing of the planets. His work De Caelo presented a model of the universe in which the Sun, Moon, and planets circle about the Earth at fixed distances. <b>A</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> version of the geocentric model was developed by the Greek astronomer Hipparchus when he proposed that Mars moved along a circular track called the epicycle that, in turn, orbited about the Earth along a larger circle called the deferent.|$|E
5|$|As the 18th century dawned, Sicilian architects were {{employed}} to create the new palazzi and churches. These architects, often local, were able to design in <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> style {{than those of the}} late 17th century; many had been trained in mainland Italy and had returned with a more detailed understanding of the Baroque idiom. Their work inspired less-travelled Sicilian designers. Very importantly, these architects were also assisted by the books of engravings by Domenico de' Rossi, who for the first time wrote down text with his engravings, giving the precise dimensions and measurements of many of the principal Renaissance and Baroque fa√ßades in Rome. In this way, the Renaissance finally came late to Sicily by proxy.|$|E
5|$|Business {{aviation}} {{has shown}} strong growth, although {{the numbers of}} aircraft on the UK register have declined. This reflects a shift away from turboprop aircraft towards foreign-registered business jets based in the UK, which {{are estimated to be}} growing in numbers. However, twin piston-engined aircraft numbers have declined significantly, reflecting pressures on the light air-taxi segment from increasingly flexible and cheaper scheduled services, and <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> corporate charter business. The amount of flight training conducted by UK schools has declined, largely at the hands of competition from foreign schools, which benefit from lower costs and better weather.|$|E

40|$|A {{wide range}} of {{nutritional}} disturbances {{may be found in}} patients with Crohn's disease. <b>As</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> tests become available to measure vitamin and trace element deficiencies, so these are being recognized as complications of Crohn's disease. It is important to recognize nutritional deficiencies at an early stage and initiate appropriate treatment. Otherwise many patients, experiencing what can be a chronic and debilitating illness, may suffer unnecessarily from the consequences of deprivation of vital nutrients...|$|R
5|$|Many of the {{earliest}} buildings were simple gabled rectangles, a style that continued to be built into the seventeenth century. Examples include Dunnottar Castle in the 1580s, Greenock (1591) and Durness (1619), These new buildings often had windows on the south wall and none on the north, which became a unique feature of Reformation kirks. There were continuities with pre-Reformation materials, with some churches using rubble, as at Kemback in Fife (1582). Others employed stone and a few added wooden steeples, as at Burntisland (1592). The church of Greyfriars, Edinburgh, built between 1602 and 1620, used a rectangular layout with a largely Gothic form, but that at Dirleton (1612), had <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> classical style.|$|E
5|$|Mendelssohn wrote some Singspiele {{for family}} {{performance}} in his youth. His opera Die beiden Neffen (The Two Nephews) was rehearsed {{for him on}} his 15th birthday. 1829 saw Die Heimkehr aus der Fremde (Son and Stranger or Return of the Roamer), a comedy of mistaken identity written in honour of his parents' silver anniversary and unpublished during his lifetime. In 1825 he wrote <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> work, Die Hochzeit des Camacho (Camacho's Wedding), based on an episode in Don Quixote, for public consumption. It was produced in Berlin in 1827, but coolly received. Mendelssohn left the theatre before {{the conclusion of the}} first performance, and subsequent performances were cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{different}} court systems existed. In Nejd, {{there was}} a simple system of single judges {{for each of the}} major towns. The judge was appointed by the local governor, with whom he worked closely to dispose of cases. In the Hejaz, there was <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> system, with courts comprising panels of judges. In 1925, Abdul Aziz Al Saud of Nejd conquered the Hejaz and united it with his existing territories to form the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932. In 1927, the king introduced a new court system to the Hejaz comprising general and summary courts and ordered that Hanbali fiqh should be used. However, Nejd's traditional system of judges was left in place in the face of conservative opposition from the Nejd religious establishment.|$|E
50|$|On 4 September 1959, Interrupter {{was renamed}} Tracer to {{eliminate}} confusion {{with some of}} her sister ships with similarly sounding names. Between 1959 and 1965, Tracer conducted patrols at sea, at various picket stations in the Western Contiguous Radar Line. The ship {{proved to be an}} efficient vessel and received awards for administrative and operational efficiency on several occasions. <b>As</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> early-warning systems came into operational use, the need for the AGR's diminished accordingly.|$|R

5|$|The Lord of the Rings {{contains}} {{several more}} supporting scenes, and has <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> plot structure, following {{the paths of}} multiple characters. Tolkien wrote the later story in much less humorous tones and infused it with more complex moral and philosophical themes. The {{differences between the two}} stories can cause difficulties when readers, expecting them to be similar, find that they are not. Many of the thematic and stylistic differences arose because Tolkien wrote The Hobbit as a story for children, and The Lord of the Rings for the same audience, who had subsequently grown up since its publication. Further, Tolkien's concept of Middle-earth was to continually change and slowly evolve throughout his life and writings.|$|E
5|$|The first farming {{people to}} settle {{in the region are}} {{associated}} with the Neolithic Starƒçevo culture, which flourished between 6200 and 5200 BC. There are several Starƒçevo sites in and around Belgrade, including the eponymous site of Starƒçevo. The Starƒçevo culture was succeeded by the Vinƒça culture (5500‚Äì4500 BC), <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> farming culture that grew out of the earlier Starƒçevo settlements which is also named for a site in the Belgrade region (Vinƒça-Belo Brdo). The Vinƒça culture is known for its very large settlements, one of the earliest settlements by continuous habitation and some of the largest in prehistoric Europe; anthropomorphic figurines such as the Lady of Vinƒça; the earliest known copper metallurgy in Europe; a proto-writing form developed prior to the Sumerians and Minoans, known as the Old European script, dating back to around 5300 BC.|$|E
5|$|The smash {{success of}} Docter's 2009 film Up {{encouraged}} those at Pixar to allow Docter to create another film with <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> story. Inside Out {{is the first}} Pixar film without input from co-founder and former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who died in 2011. In addition, the film did not have as much input from chief creative officer John Lasseter, who was focused on restructuring Walt Disney Animation Studios in Los Angeles {{at the time of}} its production. Executives at Disney and Pixar were positive at the proposal of making Inside Out, but acknowledged it would be difficult to market.|$|E

5|$|While {{financial}} backing was issued by NATO's Mutual Weapons Development Program to support {{development of the}} Pegasus engine, the British government were not forthcoming with funding. While HSA chose {{to go ahead with}} the P.1127 as a private venture, the Air Staff disagreed heavily over what requirements should be set out for a future RAF VTOL aircraft; some officers, such as the Chief of the Air Staff Sir Thomas Pike, advocated simplicity while others, such as the RAF operational requirements division, sought various performance demands of such an aircraft, particularly the capacity for supersonic flight. HSA was also interested in the prospects and feasibility of <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> development of the P.1127, knowing that a supersonic-capable VTOL aircraft would likely be more attractive to customers, there being a general perception at the time that supersonic aircraft held significantly more value their subsonic counterparts.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to dualism, monism {{does not accept}} any fundamental divisions. The fundamentally disparate nature of reality has been central to forms of eastern philosophies for over two millennia. In Indian and Chinese philosophy, monism is integral to how experience is understood. Today, the most common forms of monism in Western philosophy are physicalist. Physicalistic monism asserts that the only existing substance is physical, in some sense of that term to be clarified by our best science. However, a variety of formulations (see below) are possible. Another form of monism, idealism, states that the only existing substance is mental. Although pure idealism, {{such as that of}} George Berkeley, is uncommon in contemporary Western philosophy, <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> variant called panpsychism, according to which mental experience and properties may be at the foundation of physical experience and properties, has been espoused by some philosophers such as Alfred North Whitehead and David Ray Griffin.|$|E
5|$|The news of FreeSpace 2 {{being in}} {{development}} was confirmed in a chat on November 6, 1998. FreeSpace 2 {{was developed in}} less than one year. The Volition team revealed they had written up a story and will be targeting high-end hardware with dogfights for {{a greater number of}} ships and even larger and more deadly capital ships. The team set themselves the goals of setting new standards for both single-player and multiplayer space combat simulations, and started to modify the FreeSpace game engine for FreeSpace 2. This team was the same team which had worked on Descent: FreeSpace, plus several new members. In order to flesh out the story, Volition hired Jason Scott as a full-time writer before work even started. The linear mission structure was adopted as it was decided it would help the immersion factor of the story greatly. As the relations between the Terrans and Vasudans dominated the first game, it was decided to scale the focus down to a personal level with Admiral Bosch and his decisions to rebel. Scott's close work with the designers, and co-ordination of the voice recording process helped to tightly integrate the story into the missions, giving <b>a</b> <b>more</b> <b>sophisticated</b> feel to the story.|$|E
