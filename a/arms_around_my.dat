60|$|Minnie flung her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck, {{and kissed}} me over and over again.|$|E
60|$|She {{concluded}} with her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck, her face upturned to mine and temptingly close, her eyes greatly solemn and greatly promising.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, in {{that case}} we would all fall together," [...] {{returned}} the Ork. [...] "Get aboard, little girl; sit across my shoulders and put both your <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{came across}} the room to the couch where I was sitting talking to Emily, and put her <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck.|$|R
60|$|This puzzled {{me for a}} moment, but {{presently}} I {{began to}} think that the two might begin quarrelling again, and said so. Nick laughed and put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck.|$|R
6000|$|... "This Hugh Roger Littlepage," [...] cried Patt, {{throwing}} an <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck; [...] "not that Hugh Roger Littlepage. Do but add that, dearest uncle, and I will {{kiss you}} for an hour." ...|$|R
6000|$|Laws, it was {{out before}} I could think! And before I could budge she throws her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck {{and told me to}} say it AGAIN, say it AGAIN, say it AGAIN! ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{saw myself}} draw near her reverently and say, [...] "Margaret, he is dead, {{and that is}} why I have come back," [...] and I saw her put her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck as she often did long ago.|$|E
60|$|She put her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck, and I {{said that}} it would do admirably; but I had a certain sinking of the heart, for I saw how hard it was even for Eveleth to part with her property.|$|E
60|$|But my admonition was {{obviously}} unnecessary. The beautiful Leah showed {{not the slightest}} sign of fear. She rested her head against my shoulder and put one <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck. I was in raptures.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{accept your}} reproof, child, for boastfulness is hateful in a warrior. But get up, my love. What {{would happen if}} some one {{came into the room}} and found a little old hag sitting on my knee with her <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck?" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{caught my}} hand in his, and devoured it with kisses. His lips burned me like fire. He twisted himself {{suddenly}} in the chair, and wound his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> waist. In the terror and indignation of the moment, vainly struggling with him, I cried out for help.|$|R
60|$|He {{threw his}} <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck, bent me over his stomach to his breast, {{kissed me on}} both cheeks, hugged me four or five times, and then placed me in his own arm-chair. As soon as I had got well again, we began {{business}} at once.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{leave me}} to-day, Paul," [...] whispered {{my mother to}} me one morning. So I stayed, and in the evening my mother put her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck and I lay beside her, my head upon her breast, as I used to when a little boy. And when the morning came I was alone.|$|E
6000|$|It was by {{no means}} what I {{intended}} it to be, but it seemed luxurious to her. Tears dimmed her eyes as she stepped across the threshold, but when I said, [...] "Mother, hereafter my headquarters are to be in Chicago, and my home here with you," [...] she put her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck and wept. Her wanderings were over, her heart at peace.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bless your {{innocent}} heart, did {{you think}} you could hide any thing from me? Geordie couldn't keep a secret, and I'm only paying his debt, Pen dear, with the sort of interest women like," [...] Dick answered, with an audacious <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> waist and a brown beard close to my cheek.|$|R
5000|$|His {{connection}} with the chimps is evident when he teaches 11-year-old Cozi to climb a tree for the first time. [...] "Cozi never had been up a tree before, and I could feel he was nervous of falling but also elated by the new experience," [...] said Cussons. [...] "As he put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> shoulders for security, I felt then that, although we belonged to different species, Cozi saw me {{not just as a}} friend but a brother he trusted with his life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My brother! {{this is some}} incomprehensible raving," [...] pealed Isabel, {{throwing}} both <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> him;--"my brother, <b>my</b> brother!" ...|$|R
60|$|And {{the young}} Robber laughed in answer, {{and sought to}} knock at the gate. And {{as he did so}} the Hermit ran forward and caught him by the skirts of his raiment, and said to him: 'Stretch forth your hands, and set your <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck, and put your ear close to my lips, and I will give you what remains to me of the {{knowledge}} of God.' And the young Robber stopped.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, so that's it! I {{knew there}} was something. How glad--how glad I am!" [...] Then Sally threw her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck, and without reserve or {{restraint}} began to kiss me and love me. It {{must have been a}} moment of sheer gladness to feel that I was not disreputable, a moment when something deep and womanly in her was vindicated. Assuredly she was entirely different from what she had ever been before.|$|E
60|$|This was a {{compliment}} to me, but it showed what a sad pass Steele had come to. My regret was that I had no sympathy to offer him. I failed him there. I had trouble of my own. The feel of Sally's clinging <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck, the warm, sweet touch {{of her lips}} remained on mine. What Steele was enduring I did not know, but I {{felt that it was}} agony.|$|E
5000|$|Gracey said [...] "In {{my first}} varsity year, {{the night before}} we played Georgia Tech, Coach McGugin casually walked up {{to me in the}} lobby of our hotel, put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> soldier and sorta whispered, [...] "I was with some Atlanta newspapermen this {{afternoon}} and I told them you were the finest sophomore center I had ever coached. I hope that I haven't made it embarrassing for you" [...] We beat Tech, 49 to 7. Afterward I talked to seven other players and you know, Coach McGugin told them all the same thing he told me." ...|$|R
60|$|I stooped {{and kissed}} her lightly on the cheek. But {{suddenly}} her <b>arms</b> were wound <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck. With a strength which was amazing she held me to her.|$|R
5000|$|In 1988 Vaughn made {{headlines}} while visiting New York City when Vaughn, then 67, defended himself during an attempted mugging as Vaughn left his hotel in midtown Manhattan after midnight {{to get a}} newspaper. [...] Former professional prizefighter Vaughn hit the would-be mugger in the jaw leaving the mugger {{face down on the}} sidewalk. [...] "This fellow came up behind me, put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> waist, pinned my right arm to my side, and tried to remove my wallet," [...] says Vaughn. [...] "I hit him in the throat with my elbow. Then I kneed him in the groin and hit him in the jaw about five times. He was jackknifed on his face on the sidewalk as I walked away." [...] "On several occasions I've had to straighten people out," [...] Vaughn added.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's fine. Sally, {{you have}} ideas in your pretty little head. And once I thought it held nothing but--" [...] She {{put a hand}} on my mouth. [...] "I must go now," [...] she said and rose. She stood close to me and put her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck. [...] "One thing more, Russ. It--it was dif--difficult telling Diane we--we were engaged. I lied to Uncle. But what else could I have told Diane? I--I--Oh--was it--" [...] She faltered.|$|E
6000|$|... "'She's come to do light {{housekeeping}} for you,' Seth grinned. I let him rave, though afterwards I {{kept him}} throwing {{in the coal}} too fast to work his mouth very much. Why, say, when I got {{to the spot where}} I picked her up, and stopped the train for her to get off, she just flopped down on her knees, got a hammerlock with her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> knees, and cried all over my shoes. What was I to do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Like an angel! It seemed {{rather to}} be {{a relief to}} her mind, for she threw her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck, and asked if this was all that had lately made me unhappy.--But, poor girl," [...] added he, [...] "she cannot realize the change we must undergo. She has no idea of poverty but in the abstract; she has only read of it in poetry, where it is allied to love. She feels as yet no privation; she suffers no loss of {{accustomed}} conveniences nor elegancies. When we come practically to experience its sordid cares, its paltry wants, its petty humiliations--then will be the real trial." ...|$|E
6000|$|And {{the man who}} {{had been}} the child saw his daughter, newly lost to him, a {{celestial}} creature among those three, and he said, 'My daughter's head is on my sister's bosom, and her <b>arm</b> is <b>around</b> <b>my</b> mother's neck, and at her feet there is the baby of old time, and I can bear the parting from her, GOD be praised!' ...|$|R
5000|$|Conservative Central Office {{were not}} so sure. They were {{concerned}} that a local businessman with little fame or track record would struggle to beat the former MP and author and the World War II hero. Odds were given of 6:1 against the Conservatives winning. Harris was summoned to see Party leader Winston Churchill, which Harris realised was to dissuade him from standing. He later said, [...] "when he discovered how determined I was to win the seat, he put his <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> shoulders {{and said he would}} help me all he could." [...] Churchill toured the constituency, making speeches from the top of his car. Helpfully, his daughter Mary Soames was then in a Croydon maternity hospital giving birth to her son, Nicholas, bringing the campaign positive publicity. In the end, Harris triumphed with an 11,664 majority. A national newspaper the next morning ran the headline [...] "Oh what a beautiful morning". The song (from Oklahoma!) became his theme tune when touring Croydon.|$|R
60|$|Why should I try {{to recall}} his words? Nay! if I could, I would not set them down here! I felt every fiber of my nature glowing with delight as I listened; every chord seemed quivering with heart-stirring music. I {{had given up}} all idea of resistance. A strange drowsy peace had stolen in upon me. One of his <b>arms</b> was <b>around</b> <b>my</b> waist, and my hand was imprisoned in his. So we sat, and the moments became golden.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not {{the night}} I fear, but the day. I hate the sight of this [...] woman with whom I live, whom I call 'wife.' I shrink from the blow of [...] her cold lips, the curse of her stony eyes. She has seen, she has [...] learnt; I feel it, I know it. Yet she winds her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck, [...] and calls me sweetheart, and smoothes my hair with her soft, false [...] hands. We speak mocking words of love to one another, but I know her [...] cruel eyes are ever {{following}} me. She is plotting her revenge, and I [...] hate her, I hate her, I hate her!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He was, indeed," [...] {{admitted}} the Emperor. [...] "He was a tinsmith by trade and could make {{anything out of}} tin. When I returned to Nimmie Amee, the girl was delighted and threw her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck and kissed me, declaring {{she was proud of}} me. The Witch saw the kiss and was more angry than before. When I went to work in the forest, next day, my axe, being still enchanted, slipped and cut off my other leg. Again I hopped--on my tin leg--to my friend the tinsmith, who kindly made me another tin leg and fastened it to my body. So I returned joyfully to Nimmie Amee, who was much pleased with my glittering legs and promised that when we were wed she would always keep them oiled and polished. But the Witch was more furious than ever, and as soon as I raised my axe to chop, it twisted around and cut off one of my arms. The tinsmith made me a tin arm and I was not much worried, because Nimmie Amee declared she still loved me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I went to {{the biggest}} jewelry shop in town, and I bought a pair of diamond ear-rings, {{and put them in}} my pocket, and {{went to the}} house. 'What name?' says the chap who opened the door; and he looked like a cross 'twixt a {{restaurant}} waiter and a parson. 'Skeesicks,' said I. He takes me in; and pretty soon my wife comes sailin' into the parlor, and says, 'Excuse me; but I don't think I recognize the name.' She was mighty polite; for I had on a red wig and side-whiskers. 'A friend of your husband's from California, ma'am, with a present for your daughter, Miss--,' and I made as I had forgot the name. But all of a sudden a voice said, 'That's too thin;' and in walked Melindy. 'It's playin' it rather low down, father, to pretend you don't know your daughter's name; ain't it, now? How are you, old man?' And with that she tears off my wig and whiskers, and throws her <b>arms</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck--instinct, sir, pure instinct!" ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{suddenly}} {{her other}} <b>arm</b> was <b>around</b> <b>my</b> neck, her wet tear-stained face was pressed to mine. I scarcely knew how it happened, but I {{knew that she}} was in my arms, and my lips were pressed to hers. A sudden, beautiful wave of colour flooded her cheeks; she smiled gladly up at me. She gave a delicious little sigh of satisfaction and then buried her face on my shoulder. Almost at the same moment Ray entered the room.|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{set out on}} my Raleigh Sports... I arrived elated {{and full}} of {{anticipation}} but my joy was short-lived, all the doors were locked and barred {{and there was no}} sign of life. Without warning a side door flew open and a small powerfully built man came hurtling out of the gloom into the sunlight. A flapping empty sleeve hung where his right arm should have been. He poured a tirade of French at me before stepping back inside and slamming the door. I gave the door another swift kick and shouted in English that all I wanted was to see the famous track. The door slowly opened and the one-armed man stepped outside, but this time a broad smile covered his previously angry face."Anglais?" [...] he said, as if uttering some special password. He spoke in halting English. Did I know Wembley? He had ridden the London six-day there? He put his one good <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> shoulder and escorted me and my Raleigh into the stadium.|$|R
60|$|I came to in {{the midst}} of wild movement. All about me was the same movement. I had been caught up in a monstrous flood that was {{sweeping}} me I knew not whither. Fresh air was on my cheek and biting sweetly in my lungs. Faint and dizzy, I was vaguely aware of a strong <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> <b>my</b> body under the arms, and half-lifting me and dragging me along. Feebly my own limbs were helping me. In front of me I could see the moving back of a man's coat. It had been slit from top to bottom along the centre seam, and it pulsed rhythmically, the slit opening and closing regularly with every leap of the wearer. This phenomenon fascinated me for a time, while my senses were coming back to me. Next I became aware of stinging cheeks and nose, and could feel blood dripping on my face. My hat was gone. My hair was down and flying, and from the stinging of the scalp I managed to recollect a hand in the press of the entrance that had torn at my hair. My chest and arms were bruised and aching in a score of places.|$|R
