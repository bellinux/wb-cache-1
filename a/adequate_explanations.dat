This is responsible for providing <b>adequate</b> <b>explanations</b> for any ‘thing,’ or object that occurs in relation to a subject of knowing; of any representation possible there is always a possible question of 'why?' that one can address to it.

The objective {{of this study is}} to help reduce the number of avoidable medical malpractice lawsuits. This qualitative study could pave the way to future quantitative studies. The analysis of the qualitative data revealed that in the vast majority of medical malpractice lawsuits filed by patients and their families there were ① an occurrence of unexpected bad outcomes, ② inadequate explanation by the patient's physician, and ③ involvement of an instigator who encouraged the lawsuit. That is, the failure of a physician to provide an <b>adequate</b> <b>explanation</b> to a patient or the inappropriate conduct of a physician after unexpected bad results, with or without an instigator's involvement, is the main reason patients file medical malpractice lawsuits.
