5|$|Just {{before the}} 1934 season, Ruppert offered to make Ruth {{the manager of}} the Yankees' top minor-league team, the Newark Bears, but he was talked out of it by his wife, Claire, <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>business</b> manager, Christy Walsh. Shortly afterward, Tigers owner Frank Navin made a {{proposal}} to Ruppert and Barrow—if the Yankees traded Ruth to Detroit, Navin would name Ruth player-manager.

Navin asked Ruth to come to Detroit for an interview. However, Ruth balked, since Walsh had already arranged for him {{to take part in a}} celebrity golf tournament in Hawaii.
