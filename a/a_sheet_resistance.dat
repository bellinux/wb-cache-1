When the wafers are heated to approximately 1000 C, silicon is preferentially driven off along the edges, forming nanoribbons whose structure is determined by the pattern of the three-dimensional surface.

40|$|Among new {{flexible}} transparent {{conductive electrode}} (TCE) candidates, ultrathin Ag film (UTAF) is attractive for its extremely low resistance and relatively high transparency. However, {{the performances of}} UTAF based TCEs critically depend on the threshold thickness for growth of continuous Ag films and the film morphologies. Here, we demonstrate that these two parameters could be strongly altered through the modulation of substrate surface energy. By minimizing the surface energy difference between the Ag film and substrate, a 9 nm UTAF with <b>a</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>resistance</b> down to 6. 9 Omega sq(- 1) can be obtained using an electron-beam evaporation process.

Template-stripping procedure is further developed to transfer the UTAFs to flexible polymer matrixes and construct Al 2 O 3 /Ag/MoOx (AAM) electrodes with excellent surface morphology as well as optical and electronic characteristics, including a root-mean-square roughness below 0. 21 nm, a transparency up to 93. 85 % at 550 nm and <b>a</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>resistance</b> as low as 7. 39 Omega sq(- 1).

This qualitative diagnosis of an important distributed series resistance is completed using two quantitative diagnostic methods: the determination of the fill factor of the cell, and the measurement of the intersection of the V axis with the tangent to the I–V characteristic at the short-circuit point.
