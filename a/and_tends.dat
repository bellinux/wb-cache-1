5|$|It prefers basins {{and desert}} areas vegetated with Chinese {{tamarisk}} (Tamarix chinensis), brush, or poplar (Populus), along the peripheries of rivers {{that surround the}} mountains in the Taklamakan Desert. This distribution of the Yarkand hare is ring shaped. It also uses reed vegetation along rivers for shelter, <b>and</b> <b>tends</b> to avoid agricultural fields. About 200,000 individuals are estimated to inhabit the Tarim Basin.|$|E
5|$|There {{are fewer}} {{recorded}} bites from this species {{compared to other}} venomous species such as cobras and vipers as it is less aggressive <b>and</b> <b>tends</b> to avoid humans. If they do bite, it is usually in self-defense when accidentally grabbed. Most sea snake bites occur when fishermen attempt to untangle the snakes from their fishing nets.|$|E

The mouse suggests Thumbelina marry her neighbor, a mole, but Thumbelina finds repulsive {{the prospect of being}} married to such a creature because he spent all his days underground and never saw the sun or sky. The field mouse keeps pushing Thumbelina into the marriage, saying the mole is a good match for her, and does not listen to her protests.|$|E
5|$|Viva Piñata is a first-person life {{simulation}} game {{in which}} the player restores <b>and</b> <b>tends</b> to a neglected garden on Piñata Island. The player uses gardening tools, such as shovels and watering cans, to plough their garden, sow seeds, create ponds, and sculpt the garden to their liking. When certain requirements are fulfilled, the garden will attract a black-and-white outline of a given piñata species. After fulfilling additional requirements, the piñata will become a resident, changing into a full-color version.|$|E
5|$|Yttrium has {{no known}} {{biological}} role, {{though it is}} found in most, if not all, organisms <b>and</b> <b>tends</b> to concentrate in the liver, kidney, spleen, lungs, and bones of humans. Normally, as little as 0.5milligrams {{is found in the}} entire human body; human breast milk contains 4ppm. Yttrium can be found in edible plants in concentrations between 20ppm and 100ppm (fresh weight), with cabbage having the largest amount. With as much as to 700ppm, the seeds of woody plants have the highest known concentrations.|$|E

50|$|In gas {{discharge}} lamps, such as flashlamps, current density {{plays an important}} role in the output spectrum produced. Low current densities produce spectral line emission <b>and</b> <b>tend</b> to favour longer wavelengths. High current densities produce continuum emission <b>and</b> <b>tend</b> to favour shorter wavelengths. Low current densities for flash lamps are generally around 10 A∙mm−2. High current densities can be more than 40 A∙mm−2.|$|R
5|$|Skilful use of {{headwind}} {{and thermal}} updrafts along various {{sections of the}} hill is used to generate additional lift, creating pressure under the oversized skis and enabling athletes to effectively ride on a 'cushion of air'. A reasonable amount of headwind is favourable to a long jump as it {{has the effect of}} keeping the athlete aloft and delaying their descent back onto the hill, whereas a tailwind or no wind at all is highly unfavourable <b>and</b> <b>tends</b> to shorten a jump by pushing the athlete downwards towards the hill too early. In particular, the presence of a tailwind forms one of the most challenging aspects of clearing the knoll and achieving a competitive distance. A crosswind is just as challenging, as it can create dangerous instability in the air. Conversely, in ideal headwind conditions, an athlete can 'catch' an updraft along various points of the hill – which always involves some degree of luck – and use it to glide even further, making for an impressive visual effect for audiences.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantic Ocean has a moderating {{effect on}} {{temperature}} in Jersey, as water {{has a much}} greater specific heat capacity than air <b>and</b> <b>tends</b> to heat and cool slowly throughout the year. This has a warming influence on coastal areas in winter and a cooling influence in summer. The highest temperature recorded was 36.0°C (96.8°F) on 9 August 2003, and the lowest temperature recorded was −10.3°C (13.5°F) on 5 January 1894. By comparison, higher temperatures are found in mainland United Kingdom, which achieved 38.5°C (101.3°F) in Faversham, Kent on 10 August 2003. The impact of the Atlantic Ocean and coastal winds ensure that Jersey is slightly cooler than the southern and central parts of England during the summer months.|$|E
5|$|The bovids have various {{methods of}} social {{organisation}} and social behaviour, which are classified into solitary and gregarious behaviour. Further, these types may each {{be divided into}} territorial and nonterritorial behaviour. Small bovids such as the klipspringer, oribi, and steenbok are generally solitary and territorial. They hold small territories into which {{other members of the}} species are not allowed to enter. These antelopes form monogamous pairs. Many species such as the dik-dik use pheromone secretions from the preorbital glands and sometimes dung, as well, to mark their territories. The offspring disperse at the time of adolescence, and males need must acquire territories prior to mating. The bushbuck is the only bovid that is both solitary and not territorial. This antelope hardly displays aggression, <b>and</b> <b>tends</b> to isolate itself or form loose herds, though in a favourable habitat, several bushbuck may be found quite close to one another.|$|E

5|$|The {{relative}} position of eyes is highly variable within the species. For example, eye location ranges from being completely within the antennal scrobes to completely outside the scrobes. In {{some cases the}} eye itself is located outside the antennal scrobe, but the eye's fossa is well marked and confluent with the antennal scrobe. In most specimens, the antennal carina (ridge extending along the dorsal antennal region) bifurcates from the antennal scrobes and lies straight above the eyes. However, in specimens from Nicaragua, a strongly impressed antennal carina is present. In these specimens about 40% of the eye's area lies within the antennal scrobes. In the gyne, only ~1/6 of the eye lies within the antennal scrobes. A depression sometimes forms in the integument in {{the sides of the}} propodeum, below the propodeal spiracle and above the metapleural gland. The depth of this depression varies among specimens <b>and</b> <b>tends</b> to be deepest in larger specimens.|$|E
5|$|The sparsely-spotted stingaree, white-spotted stingaree, or Dixon's stingaree (Urolophus paucimaculatus) is {{a species}} of {{stingray}} in the family Urolophidae, common off the southern Australian coast. Preferring sandy flats and seagrass beds, this benthic ray can be found from close to shore {{to a depth of}} at least , <b>and</b> <b>tends</b> to occur deeper in the northern portion of its range. Reaching a length of , this species has a broad, diamond-shaped pectoral fin disc that is typically plain gray in color above with a V-shaped marking between the eyes. Individuals from southerly waters also generally exhibit a smattering of small, dark-edged white spots. This ray is further characterized by a distinctively bell-shaped curtain of skin between the nostrils. Its tail has a skin fold running along either side and a leaf-shaped caudal fin, but no dorsal fin.|$|E
5|$|The {{westerlies}} {{explain why}} coastal North America {{tends to be}} wet, especially from Northern California to Alaska, during the winter. Differential heating from the sun between the land which is quite cool and the ocean which is relatively warm causes areas of low pressure to develop over land. This results in moisture rich air from the Pacific Ocean to flow from the west, resulting in frequent rainstorms and wind on the coast. This moisture continues to flow eastward until orographic lift caused by the Coast, Cascade, Columbia and Rocky Mountains cause a rain shadow effect which limits further penetration of these systems and associated rainfall eastward. This trend reverses in the summer when strong heating of the land causes high pressure <b>and</b> <b>tends</b> to block moisture-rich air from the Pacific from reaching land. This explains why most of coastal North America in the middle latitudes experiences dry summers, despite abundant rainfall in the winter.|$|E
