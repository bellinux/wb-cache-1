50|$|The mascot of Paraná Clube is an <b>azure</b> <b>jay,</b> {{a common}} bird in Paraná state. The bird {{is also the}} symbol of Paraná state.|$|E
50|$|The club's logo has {{a stylized}} conifer cone format, in red, {{with a white}} contour, which conrains an <b>azure</b> <b>jay</b> and a white pine. The club's name is written in blue, as is the word Brasil. The word Clube is written in white.|$|E
50|$|It feeds {{extensively}} on the nut-like seeds of Araucaria angustifolia, {{but it is not}} strictly limited to this, since it also feeds on insects and fruit. As other corvids, <b>azure</b> <b>jays</b> are highly intelligent. Their communication is complex, consisting of at least 14 distinct vocalizations. They form groups of 4 to 15 individuals that are well organized in hierarchies. These groups remain stable for up to two generations.|$|R
50|$|The <b>azure</b> <b>jay</b> has a {{total length}} of {{approximately}} 40 cm and it weighs about 270 g, {{and is the}} largest South American corvid. Its plumage is intensely blue with a contrasting black head and upper chest. Males and females are similar, although the females typically are smaller.|$|E
50|$|The {{forest is}} {{a refuge for}} wild animals such as pacas, robust {{capuchin}} monkeys, pygmy brocket (Mazama nana) and ocelot (Leopardus pardalis), as well as species of birds such as the vinaceous-breasted amazon (Amazona vinacea), red-spectacled amazon (Amazona pretrei), scarlet ibis (Eudocimus ruber) and <b>azure</b> <b>jay</b> (Cyanocorax caeruleus).|$|E
50|$|The <b>azure</b> <b>jay</b> (Cyanocorax caeruleus) (Brazilian Portuguese: Gralha-azul - blue crow) is a passeriform bird of {{the crow}} family, Corvidae. It {{is found in}} the Atlantic Forest, {{especially}} with Araucaria angustifolia, in south-eastern Brazil (São Paulo to Rio Grande do Sul), far eastern Paraguay and far north-eastern Argentina. It is the state bird of Paraná.|$|E
50|$|It is {{also the}} habitat of a varied fauna: pampas deer (locally known as veado campeiro), maned wolves (lobo guará), cougars (onça-parda or suçuarana), bush dogs (cachorro-vinagre), ocelots (jaguatirica), pacas, howler monkeys (bugio), Atlantic titis (sauá), squirrels, and {{hedgehogs}} can still be found there. Birds of note are the <b>azure</b> <b>jay,</b> the toucan, the scaly-headed parrot (maitaca), the inhambu, the jacana, the seriema and the caracara.|$|E
50|$|The {{park was}} {{originally}} covered in mixed montane rainforest, {{but due to}} human exploitation little of the original coverage remains.It is presently {{in the process of}} regeneration.There are fragments of the original Araucaria Forest, which contain species such as Brazilian walnut (Ocotea porosa), Paraná pine (Araucaria angustifolia), yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis), cedar (Cedrela fissilis) and Brazilian oak (Roupala brasiliensis).Fauna include crab-eating fox (Cerdocyon thous), brocket deer (Mazama species), Brazilian squirrel (Sciurus aestuans), <b>azure</b> <b>jay</b> (Cyanocorax caeruleus), jacu (Penelope species) and endangered species such as lowland paca (Cuniculus paca) and oncilla (Leopardus tigrinus).|$|E
50|$|It {{is usually}} dioecious, with {{the male and}} female cones on {{separate}} trees. The male (pollen) cones are oblong, 6 cm long at first, expanding to 10 - 18 cm long by 15 - 25 mm broad at pollen release. Like all conifers it is wind pollinated. The female cones (seed), which mature in autumn about 18 months after pollination, are globose, large, 18 - 25 cm in diameter, and hold about 100-150 seeds. The cones disintegrate at maturity to release the approximately 5 cm long nut-like seeds, which are then dispersed by animals, notably the <b>azure</b> <b>jay,</b> Cyanocorax caeruleus.|$|E
40|$|The vocal {{repertoire}} of the <b>Azure</b> <b>Jay</b> Cyanocorax caeruleus (Vieillot, 1818) is approached from a quali-quantitative point of view. The qualitative analysis {{was carried out}} both {{in the field and}} in captivity: the quantitative analysis was made only in captivity. Social acoustic communication in the <b>Azure</b> <b>Jay</b> is achieved through the use of two types of call: basic and intermediate calls. Fourteen basic calls are identified and presented through sonograms: the sotto voce song (courtship call) is related only to courtship and the social call is interpreted as the song in the <b>Azure</b> <b>Jay.</b> The intermediate calls are recombinations of the basic calls uttered during an alteration in motivation level. Examples of them are presented through sonograms of vocalizations recorded during mobbing predators and intraspecific agonistic contexts. The social, social-alarm, contact, flight, proximity, threat and social identity calls were those most frequently uttered by daylight: the other calls represented around 15 % {{of the total number of}} utterances. The hypothesis of the evolution in American Jays, which tends to simplification of vocal repertoire (HARDY, 1961; 1969), is analysed; C. caeruleus seems to have a small actively-used repertoire...|$|E
