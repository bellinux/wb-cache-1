40|$|SRD {{tested a}} number of {{different}} length cavities during this past quarter. Continuous transmission was observed with cavity lengths from 65 to 12 cm. The 65 cm cavity was replaced with a 39 cm cavity for work performed during this quarter. Flue gas components were tested for background absorptions and any interference with the determination of accurate mercury concentrations. Sulfur dioxide was found to absorb fairly strongly in the region of the mercury transition, but the Cavity Ring-Down (CRD) instrument was still able to detect mercury at subparts-per-billion by volume (ppb) levels. <b>Additional</b> <b>flue</b> gases tested included H{sub 2 }O, CO, CO{sub 2 }, NO, NO{sub 2 }. None of these flue gas constituents showed any observable absorption in the ultraviolet region near the atomic mercury transition. Work was also initiated in speciation studies. In particular mercury chloride (HgCl{sub 2 }) was tested. A mercury signal was detected from a gas stream containing HgCl{sub 2 }. SRD was not able to determine definitively if there exists a spectral shift great enough to separate HgCl{sub 2 } from elemental mercury in these initial tests...|$|E
40|$|AbstractSteam {{demand is}} {{increasing}} for Oil & Gas projects, {{and in particular}} oil sands and extra-heavy oils thermal recovery schemes. Use of oil residues and bitumen can be a cost-effective solution for natural gas substitution in SAGD (Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage). However, use of such fuels gives rise to higher specific GHG emissions. Oxy-combustion technology is an elegant {{solution to this problem}} since oxygen allows complete combustion of very high viscosity and heavy fuels, and because it provides a concentrated CO 2 stream, for easier Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Air Liquide has acquired {{over the last two decades}} extensive industrial experience of full oxy-combustion for the glass, metals, cement and waste treatment industries. This expertise and extensive scientific knowledge have been used to develop an innovative oxy-burner technology, specific to steam and power production applications. This oxy-burner technology presents novel and differentiating features, which will be described in this paper. In particular, it features a direct oxygen injection into the burner, without external mixing of oxygen with the flue gas recycle, which provides <b>additional</b> <b>flue</b> gas recycle rate flexibility, and enables a safe handling of the oxygen. Air Liquide has demonstrated the performance of this oxy-burner concept through downscaled (1  MW) oxy- combustion tests in a dedicated cold-wall test-rig with flue gas recycle. Total will retrofit the air-fired boiler at its Lacq CO 2 Project (SW of France) with an intermediate size of this oxy- burner technology (four 8  MW oxy-burners). The paper presents: •the innovative oxy-burner technology, its challenges and novelties,•a description of the Air Liquide 1  MW oxy-combustion test rig and the test results obtained over a wide range of flue gas recycle rates,•the integration of the oxy-combustion system into Total’s existing 30  MWth boiler...|$|E

Flow through the multiple tubes is thus from front to back, and so the exhaust is at the rear. Multiple furnaces would share a single combustion chamber.|$|R
40|$|A high flame {{temperature}} oxy-combustion test facility {{consisting of a}} 5 MWe equivalent test boiler facility and 20 KWe equivalent IPRÂ® was constructed at the Hammond, Indiana manufacturing site. The test facility was operated natural gas and coal fuels and parametric studies were performed to determine the optimal performance conditions and generated the necessary technical data required to demonstrate the technologies are viable for technical and economic scale-up. Flame temperatures between 4930 - 6120 F were achieved with high {{flame temperature}} oxy-natural gas combustion depending on whether <b>additional</b> recirculated <b>flue</b> gases are added to balance the heat transfer. For high flame temperature oxy-coal combustion, flame temperatures in excess of 4500 F were achieved and demonstrated {{to be consistent with}} computational fluid dynamic modeling of the burner system. The project demonstrated feasibility and effectiveness of the Jupiter Oxygen high flame temperature oxy-combustion process with Integrated Pollutant Removal process for CCS and CCUS. With these technologies total parasitic power requirements for both oxygen production and carbon capture currently are in the range of 20 % of the gross power output. The Jupiter Oxygen high flame temperature oxy-combustion process has been demonstrated at a Technology Readiness Level of 6 and is ready for commencement of a demonstration project...|$|R
40|$|Integrated Chemical Looping Air Separation (ICLAS) {{offers an}} energy {{efficient}} and cost effective option for large-scale oxygen generation in oxy-fuel type power plants. Oxygen {{production in the}} ICLAS is achieved by reduction of oxidised metal oxides {{in an environment of}} steam/recycled flue gas (CO 2 -rich) using a dedicated reduction reactor. This paper provides the results of a thermodynamic investigation into the effect of flue gas impurities on the reduction of three metal oxide oxygen carriers (Cu, Mn and Co oxides) under conditions pertinent to an oxy-fuel coal-fired power plant. Relevant calculations were carried out using the Fact-sage 6. 1 thermodynamic equilibrium calculation software package. Different gas streams, namely crude/wet, dry, pure CO 2 and steam were considered in the simulations together with the <b>additional</b> hypothetical impure <b>flue</b> gas stream having larger concentrations of CO, SO 2 and NO. Effects of SO 2, NO, CO and O 2 contents of the flue gas on oxygen carrier conversion and oxygen decoupling process were investigated in detail. It was established that the successful reduction of metal oxides in the presence of flue gas impurities can only be achieved at higher temperatures due to increased partial pressure of O 2 and the formation of metal sulphates at temperatures less than 800 - 900 °C. This may increase the operating and capital costs of the CLAS based oxygen production...|$|R
40|$|After {{shutting}} down the Ignalina atomic power plant, Lithuania have received a huge blow to it‘s national energetic safety. Not only pressure from The European Union, but risen electricity and natural gas import dependency has forced Lithuania {{to search for a}} quick solution. Intuitive way to solve both of the problems was combined heat and power promotion and development. Lithuania was very quick to master the sophisticated biofuel burning technologies. At the beginning biofuel was used for water heating and steam supply to various technological processes. Not long after, international experience using biofuel for cogeneration has rooted down in Lithuania too. Nowadays these plants energy production prime cost is particularly cheap. To hop into the market it is necessary to find effectiveness increasing capabilities. In this study two different ways of heat pump integration into a regular biofuel CHP are examined. First one is based on full waste heat energy transformation of water steam cycle, second – <b>additional</b> <b>flue</b> gas cooling after the economizer and greater latent heat recovery. Detailed termodinamic and economic calculations have shown that because of very high compressor power and it‘s electricity consumption the first version heat pump actually lessens annual profit. A lot less heat quantity is in the flue gas after the economizer. Heat pump designed to cool them down and gather condensing water vapour heat is many times less powerful. This is because of high coefficient of performance (COP= 9. 899), which is only possible when having low temperature difference between low grade heat pool and heat pump condensator condensing temperature. This kind of heat pump does not require high investment costs and increases annual profit by 264 thousand € or 13, 5 %...|$|E
