5|$|Shultz and Godson {{note that}} {{manipulated}} groups involve both official departments of the Soviet state, {{as well as}} non-governmental organizations which lack independence from the state control itself. Specific goals exported by covert Soviet government channels and groups in the Western world were financed by Soviet intelligence operations. These covert operations were coordinated so <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> maximum impact related to major international incidents.|$|E
5|$|Weizsäcker {{joined the}} CDU in 1954. Some years later, Helmut Kohl {{offered him a}} safe seat for the 1965 elections, even going so far <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Chancellor Konrad Adenauer write two letters urging him to run, but Weizsäcker declined, due to {{his work in the}} German Evangelical Church Assembly, wanting to avoid a {{conflict}} of interest. However, he {{became a member of the}} Bundestag (Federal Diet) in the 1969 federal elections, serving until 1981.|$|E
5|$|As {{she grew}} older Betsy {{suffered}} from numerous illnesses, the exact natures {{of which are}} not recorded but which {{are known to have}} caused William great concern. William began to become paranoid that Betsy would marry and leave his service, in 1835 going as far <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> her sign an affidavit that she would never leave him. In 1843 his older brother Charles, a successful planter in Java, returned to England after over 30 years abroad. William became deeply suspicious that Betsy was becoming too close to Charles, a suspicion intensified when Charles took her on a visit to Holland and the Rhine; Charles returned to Java in 1845. In around 1844 Betsy struck up a close relationship with the pen manufacturer and art collector Joseph Gillott, one of William's regular customers who owned some of his pictures. Gillott was married with children, and the closeness of their relationship caused William concern. In 1848, William retired to York leaving Betsy alone in his London apartment; although aware that Betsy was considering marriage he was confident that he could persuade her to come to York and live with him in his retirement. Betsy did eventually join him in York, and was present at his death.|$|E

25|$|Soon, {{many teams}} caught on with {{different}} colored jerseys. The Pirates even went <b>as</b> far <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> a rotation of which jerseys to wear, matching white pinstriped, gold, and black pants to wear with jerseys {{of the same}} color. The white pinstripes were later phased {{out in favor of}} solid white.|$|R
5|$|Because males emerge {{earlier than}} females, the males compete for mating territories {{surrounding}} the nests {{in which the}} females are located. During a fight, the males risk damaging their wings or appendages by butting and grappling. Another defense technique is to grab another male and carry it high into the air, which {{is thought to be}} a demonstration of strength. As a general rule, the larger the male the more predominant he is in battles. Age influences the success in the defense and security of territory; the younger the wasp the greater the chance of a successful takeover of territory. Some small males even engage in non-territorial mating tactics, and delay their emergence so <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a fairer chance of survival.|$|E
5|$|Gouty {{patients}} are, generally, either old men or men {{who have}} so worn themselves out in youth <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> brought on a premature old age—of such dissolute habits none being more common than the premature and excessive indulgence in venery and the like exhausting passions. The victim goes to bed and sleeps in good health. About {{two o'clock in the}} morning he is awakened by a severe pain in the great toe; more rarely in the heel, ankle or instep. The pain is like that of a dislocation and yet parts feel as if cold water were poured over them. Then follows chills and shivers and a little fever... The night is passed in torture, sleeplessness, turning the part affected and perpetual change of posture; the tossing about of body being as incessant as the pain of the tortured joint and being worse as the fit comes on.|$|E
5|$|He was {{appointed}} Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in 1669 on Barrow's recommendation. During that time, any Fellow {{of a college}} at Cambridge or Oxford was required to take holy orders and become an ordained Anglican priest. However, {{the terms of the}} Lucasian professorship required that the holder not be active in the church (presumably so <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> more time for science). Newton argued that this should exempt him from the ordination requirement, and Charles II, whose permission was needed, accepted this argument. Thus a conflict between Newton's religious views and Anglican orthodoxy was averted.|$|E

25|$|A 1989 USMC {{study found}} that single-seat fighters were well suited to air-to-air combat {{missions}} while dual-seat fighters were favored for complex strike missions against heavy air and ground defenses in adverse weather—the question being not so much <b>as</b> <b>to</b> whether a second pair of eyes would be useful, but <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>having</b> the second crewman sit in the same fighter or in a second fighter. Single-seat fighters that lacked wingmen were shown to be especially vulnerable.|$|R
5|$|Males perch after {{emerging}} from their nest. They pick out an area {{close to a}} nest with females inside and guard the territory around it so <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{a better chance of}} mating. They tend to perch on many different substrates such as stumps, pebbles, wood, weeds, grass blades and low tree branches. Males assume an alert posture, ready for a challenge from another male, or from a predator. One study by a behavioral ecologist, John Alcock, showed that a large majority of the marked wasps returned to the same perch day after day, and two males swapped between two different sites. The species rarely perches on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Time Inc was {{the title}} for the {{concluding}} two-part story-arc <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> originally been written by Robert Holmes for episodes 13 & 14 when commissioned on 4 February 1986. However, Holmes was unable {{to work on the}} script past the first part due to his untimely death on 24 May 1986. Script editor Eric Saward was tasked with completing the story, his version of the script ending with the Doctor and the Valeyard locked in battle in the time vortex and no clear victor. This was disapproved by series producer John Nathan-Turner as being too down-beat and would end the show on an inconclusive moment should the BBC decide to cancel the series. The final episode was subsequently commissioned from Pip & Jane Baker by Nathan-Turner after Saward quit as script editor following the rejection of his proposed ending.|$|E
5|$|By 1957, {{the arms}} were redrawn by Alan Beddoe so <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> red leaves {{and to change}} the royal crown from one of a Tudor design to one more {{resembling}} St. Edward's Crown, as preferred by Queen Elizabeth II. To mark the 1982 patriation of the Canadian constitution, which finally ended {{the last vestiges of}} British authority over Canada, a McGill University student named Bruce Hicks proposed to Secretary of State Gerald Regan that the motto of the Order of Canada be placed around the shield in order to bring these royal arms into line with other royal arms, many of which have been displayed in Canada during French, Scottish, and English colonisation, where those countries' highest national order of honour appears around the shield of the arms (the British arms displayed the Order of the Garter), the Scottish royal arms the Order of the Thistle, and the royalist arms of the French Regime the Order of the Holy Spirit and Order of Saint Michael). While unsuccessful in this first attempt, Hicks continued his campaign and was joined by a number of other amateur and professional heraldists. As a journalist in the parliamentary press gallery in Ottawa in the late 1980s and early 90s, Hicks strategically recast the change as something worth doing to commemorate the 25th Anniversary of the Order of Canada in 1992, an idea that was endorsed by the Advisory Committee on the Order of Canada.|$|E

40|$|Risk {{factors for}} herpes zoster (HZ) are poorly defined. An age-matched, case-control study was {{conducted}} to assess the effect of physical trauma on HZ, using Medicare data. HZ cases were 3. 4 times as likely <b>as</b> controls <b>to</b> <b>have</b> experienced trauma in the week before HZ onset, but the magnitude of the association between trauma and HZ declined over time. Cases who had cranial HZ were> 25 times as likely <b>as</b> con-trols <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had cranial trauma in the week before HZ onset. Therefore, recent trauma can be a trigger for HZ...|$|R

25|$|To {{be in the}} star's {{habitable}} zone, any suspected planet around Alpha CentauriA {{would have}} to be optimally placed about 1.25AU away – about halfway between the distances of Earth's orbit and Mars's orbit in the Solar System– so <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> similar planetary temperatures and conditions for liquid water to exist.
