500|$|Not all viewers {{were taken}} with Dalton. Jay Scott of The Globe and Mail was entirely dismissive. [...] "The new Bond {{has been widely}} {{described}} in feature stories as {{a throwback to the}} Ian Fleming original (studying the Fleming novels, Dalton was pleased to discover that Bond was a human being, he says), <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> true, if the Fleming original lacked charm, sex appeal and wit. Timothy Dalton's Bond is a serious bloke who swallows his words and approaches his job with responsibility and humanity, and eschews promiscuity – Dirtless Harry. You get the feeling that on his off nights, he might curl up with the Reader's Digest and catch an episode of Moonlighting – he'd try to memorize the jokes – before nodding off under the influence of Ovaltine. The British reviews of The Living Daylights have been laudatory, perhaps because this Bond is the most British of all, if British is to be understood as a synonym for reserved".|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly writer Whitney Pastorek {{described}} the episode as [...] "kind of cute tonight, {{and kind of}} flat in places, and kind of sad." [...] Pastorek {{said one of the}} most interesting aspects of [...] "Golden Ticket" [...] was the relationship between Michael and Dwight: [...] "After their respective failed romances with Holly and Angela, Michael and Dwight may be coming to the awkward realization that the most successful relationship in either of their lives is with one another, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> causing a little tension." [...] Travis Fickett of IGN said [...] "Golden Ticket" [...] was a [...] "solid offering", but felt it lacked any big moments and fit too much of a status quo mold he feels other recent episodes had fallen into. Fickett said it was [...] "fun to watch Michael squirm" [...] both when he thought he was in trouble, and when he was robbed credit for his good idea; he also liked when Jim encouraged Dwight not to take the fall for Michael, and when the others in the office rallied around Dwight when David Wallace gave Dwight credit for the success.|$|E

[...] In the process it releases methane that was previously adsorbed to the coal surface <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> recovered. [...] Again the sale of the methane {{can be used to}} offset the cost of the CO2 storage. Release or burning of methane would of course at least partially offset the obtained sequestration result – except when the gas is allowed to escape into the atmosphere in significant quantities: methane has a higher global warming potential than CO2.|$|E

[...] Significantly, even the keyboard parts are played live in the studio, with The Quietus noting that the [...] "interplay between electronics and amps is comparatively untouchable." [...] Spin noted that [...] "here more than on any previous Neurosis LP, he [...] commandeers his bandmates' sustained chords and snail-paced tempos and fills the space with smartly tinted textures," [...] which reference Joy Division, Ennio Morricone, and Jarboe.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, {{where the}} band had found success with Laid, reviews for Wah Wah were more favourable, despite the {{commercial}} {{failure of the}} album in the country. Dimitri Ehrlich of Entertainment Weekly graded the album [...] "B+", saying the album shows [...] "James at its most inspired and unpredictable" [...] and called the album [...] "a joyride of a record." [...] The Harvard Crimson said [...] "Wah Wah is not ear candy, like much of Laid; it's meant to get inside your head, <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> {{a bit more than}} you're in the market for when you slap down your money at HMV." [...] Rolling Stone were also favourable to the album.|$|E
2500|$|On 1 June 2012, the FPB {{announced}} that the classifiers assigned to 'The Spear' had rejected a complainant's call for the painting to be rated X18 (placing it within the category of legal pornographic works that must [...] "be passed by the FPB before they are released on the market", <b>and</b> <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>be</b> distributed only by licensed distributors, who are required to obtain proof of age), but had decided on a 16N rating for the original, undefaced and uncensored, painting, meaning that measures should {{be put in place}} to prevent access to it and to images of it by those under the age of sixteen, and to advise [...] "sensitive adult viewers" [...] over sixteen that it contains nudity (but not explicit sexual content, which would have been designated by an S in the rating). [...] In its press statement announcing the classification, the FPB referred at length to its statutory authority and responsibilities, in particular its role in [...] "promoting the safety of children"; and explicitly denied that it had been influenced by political figures or had acted beyond its jurisdiction, saying that [...] "We believe that reports to the contrary have been specifically designed to defame the Film and Publication Board, question its integrity, competence, credibility as well as formulate as a reality the false notion that the state seeks to silence and censor the media by all means possible and with total disregard for accepted procedures and principles". [...] In reply to questions, FPB chief operations officer Mmapula Fisha said that The Spear differed from other works of art containing nudity, and merited the 16N classification, because [...] "The artwork has forced society to revisit its painful history". [...] After the classification was announced, the Goodman Gallery was reported to be seeking legal advice, but to have said they [...] "felt it would {{have a significant impact on}} freedom of artistic expression", a criticism also made by commentators not involved in the case, while others expressed concern about political censorship. [...] The full report of the classification committee responsible for assessing The Spear was subsequently made available online. [...] The classification was open to appeal.|$|E
