2500|$|The other {{tribunal}} is the Apostolic Penitentiary. This tribunal has no {{jurisdiction in}} {{what is known as}} [...] "the external forum," [...] meaning cases and events which are publicly known, only matters of the [...] "internal forum," [...] which involve entirely confidential and secret matters, including (but not limited to) what is confessed in the Sacrament of Penance. It primarily deals with cases that arise only within the confessional and which by their nature are private, confidential or whose facts are secret. Such cases are normally brought before the court by a person's confessor, who writes up the relevant facts of the cases, but only what is absolutely necessary, using standardized Latin pseudonyms. The confidentiality of the person, and the priest's <b>absolute</b> <b>obligation</b> to preserve the secrecy of the Sacrament of Penance, are still in force in such cases. This court, under the authority of the Cardinal Major Penitentiary, who acts in the Pope's name, answers the confessor and empowers him to impose a penance and lift a penalty. For instance, the act of desecrating the Eucharist is one which incurs an automatic excommunication for the person who so acts (an excommunication from the moment of the act, which no court need actually meet to impose), and the power to lift this excommunication is reserved by the Pope to himself. Should this person then approach a priest in confession, repentant, and explain his act {{and the fact that he}} acted in secret, the confessor would write to the tribunal laying out the simplest outline of facts, keeping the person's identity secret, and would most likely be empowered to lift the excommunication and impose some private act of penance on the person.|$|E

Anything called Raymond was at present so welcome to Mervyn that he felt himself under <b>absolute</b> <b>obligations</b> to Robert for having left the field clear. When no longer prejudiced, the sight of Robert's practical labours struck him more and more, and his attachment grew with his admiration.|$|R

60|$|Is, then, the {{difference}} between the Just and the Expedient a merely imaginary distinction? Have mankind been under a delusion in thinking that justice is a more sacred thing than policy, and that the latter ought only to be listened to after the former has been satisfied? By no means. The exposition we have given of the nature and origin of the sentiment, recognises a real distinction; and no one of those who profess the most sublime contempt for the consequences of actions as an element in their morality, attaches more importance to the distinction than I do. While I dispute the pretensions of any theory which sets up an imaginary standard of justice not grounded on utility, I account the justice which is grounded on utility to be the chief part, and incomparably the most sacred and binding part, of all morality. Justice is a name for certain classes of moral rules, which concern the essentials of human well-being more nearly, and are therefore of more <b>absolute</b> <b>obligation,</b> than any other rules for the guidance of life; and the notion which we have found to be of the essence of the idea of justice, that of a right residing in an individual, implies and testifies to this more binding obligation.|$|E

I meant to get to work upon this whatever office I was given in the new government. I could have begun my plan from the Admiralty or the War Office quite as easily as from the Education Office. I am firmly convinced it is hopeless to think of reforming the old public schools and universities {{to meet the needs of}} a modern state, they send their roots too deep and far, the cost would exceed any good that could possibly be effected, and so I have sought a way round this invincible obstacle. I do think it would be quite practicable to side-track, as the Americans say, the whole system by creating hardworking, hard-living, modern and scientific boys' schools, first for the Royal Navy and then for the public service generally, and as they grew, opening them to the public without any <b>absolute</b> <b>obligation</b> to subsequent service. Simultaneously with this it would not be impossible to develop a new college system with strong faculties in modern philosophy, modern history, European literature and criticism, physical and biological science, education and sociology.|$|E

This being admitted, it is at least a primâ facie consequence that the duty of voting, like any other public duty, should be performed under the eye and criticism of the public; every one of whom has not only an interest in its performance, but a good title to consider himself wronged if it is performed otherwise than honestly and carefully. Undoubtedly neither this nor any other maxim of political morality is absolutely inviolable; it may be overruled by still more cogent considerations. But its weight is such that the cases which admit of a departure from it must be of a strikingly exceptional character.|$|R

The aim is to analyse the relevant legal regulation of the Loan Contract in detail, and to emphasize its interpretations issues, which are followed by the proposal of appropriate solutions. Furthermore, some other legal institutes {{closely related to the}} Loan Contract are also described (e. g. the Loan Contract under the Civil Code, loan business terms, security etc.). In the first chapter, the general concept of the loan is described, its essential importance in the free market economy, and its definition in the legal sense. The second chapter provides the history of the origin and evolution of the loan, from its formation under the Roman law to the changes in the contemporary legal regulation. The following third chapter aims to compare the Loan Contract under the Commercial Code with the Loan Contract under the Civil Code. The subject of the fourth chapter is the analysis of the fundamental principles which serve as guidelines for the Loan Contract structure. In the fifth chapter, the relevant legal regulations are addressed, the purpose and meaning of the loan business terms, and the legal character of the Loan Contract as an <b>absolute</b> commercial <b>obligation.</b> The [...] ...|$|R
40|$|After {{revelations of}} {{participation}} by psychiatrists and psychologists in interrogation of prisoners at Guantánamo Bay and Central Intelligence Agency secret detention centers, the American Psychiatric Association and the American Psychological Association adopted Position Statements absolutely prohibiting their members {{from participating in}} torture under any and all circumstances, and, to a limited degree, forbidding involvement in interrogations. Some interrogations utilize very aggressive techniques determined to be torture by many nations and organizations throughout the world. This paper explains why psychiatrists and psychologists involved in coercive interrogations violate the Geneva Conventions {{and the laws of}} the United States. Whether done with ignorance of professional ethical obligations or not, these psychiatrists and psychologists have crossed an ethical barrier that may best be averted from re-occurring by teaching medical students and residents in all medical specialties about the ethics principles stemming from the 1946 – 1947 Nuremberg trials and the Geneva Conventions, together with the Ethics Codes of the World Medical Association and the American Medical Association; and, with regard to psychiatric residents and psychological trainees, by the teaching about The Principles of Medical Ethics With Annotations Especially Applicable to Psychiatry and the Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct, respectively. In this way, all physicians and psychologists will clearly understand that they have an <b>absolute</b> moral <b>obligation</b> to "First, do no harm" to the human beings they professionally encounter...|$|R

50|$|Ross gives a list {{of seven}} prima facie duties, which he does not claim is all-inclusive: fidelity; reparation; gratitude; non-maleficence; justice; beneficence; and self-improvement. In any given situation, any number of these prima facie duties may apply. In the case of ethical dilemmas, they may even {{contradict}} one another. Someone could have a prima facie duty of reparation, say, a duty {{to help people who}} helped you move house, move house themselves, and a prima facie duty of fidelity, such as taking your children on a promised trip to the park, and these could conflict. Nonetheless, there can never be a true ethical dilemma, Ross would argue, because one of the prima facie duties in a given situation is always the weightiest, and over-rules all the others. This is thus the <b>absolute</b> <b>obligation</b> or absolute duty, the action that the person ought to perform.|$|E

For the existence of the company and contract types associated with the enterprise is critical for a legal anchoring of these institutes.

In this article, presented as a reply to an article by Steven Greer, I investigate the above questions {{in the context of}} the case law of the European Court of Human Rights. Drawing on Gäfgen v Germany, I construct a hypothetical case of conflicting absolute rights, which cannot be resolved by the existing strands of legal reasoning in the case law of the Court. Instead, I argue, recourse must be had to moral reasoning. In discussing one of moral philosophy’s deepest conundrums—the Trolley Problem—I rely on the distinction between negative and positive obligations and between direct and indirect agency to unravel the dilemma. Translating the moral argument into legal reasoning, I conclude that in cases of conflicts between <b>absolute</b> rights, negative <b>obligations</b> principally trump positive obligations...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{begins by}} {{outlining}} Emmanuel Levinas's radical conception of ethics. Levinas invokes/declares an <b>absolute</b> and primary <b>obligation</b> {{of responsibility to}} the human Other, whom he figures hyperbolically as invoked by the epiphany of the encounter with ‘{{the face of the}} Other’. This encounter with alterity founds not only ethics, but subjectivity itself, in Levinas’ conception. I apply Levinas's concept to the refusal of responsibility, of unqualified hospitality and asylum, exercised by the Australian Government under John Howard. The essay argues that the rich and varied response of Australian theatre and performance to this refusal was, however, broadly ethical. Its form of politics was to produce affective rather than ideological transformations in the audience. I examine a selection of performance and theatre work that uses different performance strategies to explore how this was achieved. The essay also outlines Levinas's objection to art conceived as representation of the face of the Other, and his delineation of the ethical mode of embodied discourse he calls ‘the saying’, which can be seen in moments of performance as an embodied, affective and interactive mode. 11 page(s...|$|R
50|$|Vacherot {{was a man}} of high {{character}} and adhered strictly to his principles, which were generally opposed to those of the party in power. His chief philosophical importance consists in {{the fact that he was}} a leader in the attempt to revivify French philosophy by the new thought of Germany, to which he had been introduced by Victor Cousin, but of which he never had more than a second-hand knowledge. Metaphysics he held to be based on psychology. He maintains the unity and freedom of the soul, and the <b>absolute</b> <b>obligation</b> of the moral law. In religion, which was his main interest, he was much influenced by Hegel, and appears somewhat in the ambiguous position of a sceptic anxious to believe. He sees insoluble contradictions in every mode of conceiving God as real, yet he advocates religious belief, though the object of that belief have but an abstract or imaginary existence.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the wedding}} ceremony, Orthodox Jews {{believe that a}} woman should only show her hair to her husband. According to the Mishnah in Ketuboth (7:6), hair {{covering}} is not an obligation of biblical origin. It discusses behaviors that are grounds for divorce such as, [...] "appearing in public with loose hair, weaving in the marketplace, and talking to any man" [...] and calls these violations of Dat Yehudit, which means Jewish rule, as opposed to Dat Moshe, Mosaic rule. This categorization suggests that hair covering is not an <b>absolute</b> <b>obligation</b> originating from Moses at Sinai, but rather is a standard of modesty that was defined by the Jewish community. In Berakhot 24a), the rabbis define hair as sexually erotic (ervah), and prohibit men from praying in sight of a woman's hair. The rabbis base this estimation on a biblical verse: [...] "Your hair is like a flock of goats" [...] (Song of Songs 4:1), suggesting that this praise reflects the sensual nature of hair.|$|E

When Khrushchev himself ordered the tanks into Budapest, Hungary, Hobsbawm finally spoke up, publishing a letter of protest. But he did not leave the Party.

The thesis is composed of eight chapters {{and each of them}} dealing with different aspects of the credit or the Loan agreement. Chapters describes the term "credit" and the difference between his legal and economic sense for society. It's necessary mention different kinds of credits, his meaning, ways of categorizations and basic principles used in credit contracts. In loan agreement I begin with a short historical introduction, his origin and evolution. Most important part of my thesis examines relevant Czech legislation of the credit contract, his meaning in system of law, necessary and unnecessaty part of loan agreement, diferrent kind of legal security of provided money and the special possition of bank like a creditor. Credit contract is regulated in § 497 - § 507 in Czech Commercial code n. 513 / 1991. Under the loan agreement, the creditor obligates to provide to the debtor, at his request, certain amount of money, and the debtor obligates to repay the provided money and pay interest. Interest in this contract is a price that the crediton is fain to allow the money. Loan agreement is one of the <b>absolute</b> commercial law <b>obligations</b> which means that the [...] ...|$|R

It concludes that the two best objections to PB are that it requires a conception of human well-being and is committed to the existence of impersonal reasons.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to critically assess the current status of the legal regime governing the international carriage of goods by sea, with the main focus being on the implied terms which form the foundation of international shipping law in general, and on the doctrine of deviation in particular.

In light of: The development of transport vessels, liberty clauses, different types of charterparties, and held cover clauses? (ii) Should the rule against unjustified deviation be treated any differently from other implied shipping terms?

Should there not be some degree of flexibility in the judicial approach to the law on deviation? (iii) Do we need harmonisation, unification and interpretation of deviation rules?

40|$|Toxic {{currency}} {{options are}} defined {{on the basis}} of the opposition to the nature (essence) of an option contract, which is justified in terms of norms founded on the general law clause of characteristics (nature) of a relation (which represents an independent premise for imposing restrictions on the freedom of contracts). So-understood toxic currency options are unlawful. Indeed they contravene iuris cogentis regulations. These include for instance option contracts, which are concluded with a bank, if the bank has not informed about option risk before concluding the contract; or the barrier options, which focus only on the protection of bank’s interests. Therefore, such options may appear to be invalid. Therefore, performing contracts for toxic currency options may be qualified as a criminal mismanagement. For the sake of security, the manager should then take into consideration filing a claim for stating invalidity (which can be made in a court verdict). At the same time, if the supervisory board member in a commercial company, who can also be a subject to mismanagement offences, commits an omission involving lack of reaction (for example, if he/she fails to notify of the suspected offence committed by the management board members acting to the company’s detriment when the management board makes the company conclude option contracts which are charged with absolute invalidity) the supervisory board member so acting may be considered to act to the company’s detriment. In the most recent Polish jurisprudence and judicature the standard of a “good host” is treated to be the last resort for determining whether the manager’s powers resulting from criminal regulations were performed. The manager of the exporter should not, as a rule, issue any options. Issuing options always means assuming an obligation. In the case of currency put options it is an <b>absolute</b> <b>obligation</b> to purchase a given amount in euro at exchange rate set in advance. On the other hand issuing call options confers an <b>absolute</b> <b>obligation</b> to deliver to the other party to the option contract a specified amount in euro at exchange rate set in advance. This latter position (short call) means unlimited loss in the case of appreciation of euro. This was the situation faced by some Polish exporters in the second half of 2008 who in the middle of 2008 issued the most risky call options for banks and, thus, they bought a currency risk from the banks. Issuing any option always means also buying someone other’s risk, in exchange for a relatively small option premium which might trigger a relatively huge and actually unlimited risk of losses, if the assumed forecast does not come true. This is not the economic analysis of law to be relied on any more in respect of the cost of preventing the risk of loss being higher or lower than the amount of damage. The manager of an exporting company, unlike the speculator who sells options (buys risk), usually has no knowledge of financial engineering, which is essential to safely manage such excessive risk through creating a hedging portfolio...|$|E
40|$|Jean-Francois Lyotard’s {{inquiry into}} the logic of obligation, {{culminating}} {{in his discussion of}} ethical phrases in “Le Differend”, is deeply indebted to Emmanuel Levinas’s reading of that logic and his articulation of a radically new modality of ethics. Both thinkers deploy a strategy of argumentation and a rhetoric of phrases whose performative contradictions are deliberate and affirmed. Levinas {{is one of the major}} figures in the twentieth century European philosophical tradition to have produced a substantive reconfiguration of ethics based upon the idea of an asymmetrical human relation rather than upon mutual obligation. The resulting ethics, outlined in texts such as “Totality and Infinity” and “Otherwise than Being, or Beyond Essence”, is one of hyperbolic responsibility beyond norms and duty and outside formal rules and pragmatics. In this paper I will analyse Lyotard’s arguments concerning the logic of <b>absolute</b> <b>obligation</b> – the ‘phrases of pure prescription’ - through a detailed reading of his relatively unknown essay on Levinas entitled “Levinas’s Logic”. Lyotard’s short commentary demonstrates considerable interpretative insight and originality in its attempt to identify the different levels of language and meta-language operative, but often unstated, in Levinas’s texts. However, as Lyotard himself recognises, such analysis risks doing considerable violence to Levinas by betraying the ethical signification of his thematization. His careful analysis of Levinas’s rhetorical strategy of deliberate logical contradiction represents a sophisticated response to Jacques Derrida’s early influential commentary ‘Violence and Metaphysics’. Derrida’s commentary is marked by its critical claims regarding Levinas’s efforts to articulate a philosophical ethics in a purified rhetoric beyond the speculative reach of the Hegelian dialectic. As I demonstrate in this paper, central to Lyotard’s own interpretative efforts is an urgent recovery of Levinas’s ethics from such an allegedly reductive reading...|$|E
40|$|Virginie Barral, Le d??veloppement durable en droit international: Essai sur les incidences juridiques d???une norme ??volutive (Bruxelles: Bruylant, 2015), ISBN: 9782802752066 Sustainable {{development}} was elaborated essentially {{within the framework}} of the United Nations and has, since its consecration at the Rio Summit in 1992, widely penetrated both conventional and general international law. Sustainable development lays down a general objective for the international community to achieve, and requires, to this end, the integration of economic, social and environmental considerations. Its intrinsically evolutive nature means that it easily adapts to changing circumstances and to the diversity of situations it is intended to govern. Aimed at reconciling a priori opposing interests through their integration, one of the primary functions of sustainable development is to be found in the influence it exerts on the interpretative process. Its flexibility and malleability make it, in this context, a convenient legal tool granting the judge a significant margin of appreciation. Sustainable development???s evolutive nature can thus authorise a dynamic interpretation of norms; legitimise a balancing exercise in case of conflict; and sometimes even open the door to treaty revision. Sustainable development remains however primarily addressed to States rather than judges, and thus intends to directly constrain the behaviour of legal subjects. Although it may not impose on States an <b>absolute</b> <b>obligation</b> to develop sustainably, it does lay down at least a relative obligation. States must strive to achieve the objective of sustainable development, and in so doing they must adopt a range of measures deemed necessary to its achievement according to the particular set of circumstances. The indeterminate and variable character of the measures necessary for the achievement of sustainable development also narrows down over time and with jurisprudential developments, and the core features of what sustainable development looks like are being slowly identified. As a result, the international judge is today sufficiently well equipped to establish a violation of the obligation to strive to achieve sustainable development...|$|E
40|$|The {{fleeting}} {{glimpse of}} ‘the {{beauty of the}} impossible’ in John Burnside’s poetry is often shadowed {{by a sense of}} threat and vulnerability that underlies this lyric moment. Burnside remarks that ‘the lyrical impulse begins at the point of self-forgetting’, and his poetry and prose have shown a deepening fascination with the ethics of retreat and (self) obliteration. The interplay of risk and responsibility, withdrawal and obligation in Burnside’s work from the late 1980 s will be traced in relation to Jacques Derrida’s notion of the poematic, articulated in the essay ‘Che cos’è la poesia?’ (‘What is poetry?’). Derrida likens the poem to le hérisson, or hedgehog, able to turn in on itself for protection but in that act exposing itself to the risk of obliteration. Whilst the poem can retreat self-defensively, turning ‘its pointed signs toward the outside’, but it is also obliged to scuttle precariously across the thoroughfares of language. A poem is a ‘learning-by-heart’; on the one hand it yearns ‘to retain by heart an absolutely unique form … pure interiority, independent spontaneity’, yet on the other it appeals to the customary, the familiar and the shared. This double movement characterises that which Derrida terms the poematic. Intimate and singular, the poem is also ‘obliged to address itself to someone’, acting like an ‘imparted secret, at once public and private, absolutely one and the other’. The poematic marks both a retreat into ‘pure’ self-containment, and a countervailing exposure to distress and contamination; in its encounter with the other, the poem opens itself up to danger, but also to the possibility and surprise of the unprecedented and of the future. This essay will show how a Burnside lyric longs for concealment, purity and privacy, but its singularity is counterpointed by the <b>absolute</b> <b>obligation</b> to open out to the other, with all the attendant risks of adulteration. As such, Burnside’s work stands as an exemplary instance {{of the way in which}} modern lyric courts the crisis of encounter rather than stages the poetics of withdrawal...|$|E
40|$|Introduction For a {{significant}} {{period of time}} (the late 1950 s [...] 1980 s), a lack of capital freedom was a major obstacle to {{the progress of the}} internal market project. The free movements of goods, persons and services were achieved, and developed, primarily through the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). On the other hand, the Court played a (self-imposed) limited {{role in the development of}} the free movement of capital. It was through a progressive series of legislation that the freedom was finally achieved. John Usher has noted that the consequence of this is that ‘free movement of capital thus became the only Treaty “freedom” to be achieved in the manner envisaged in the Treaty’. For this reason, the relationship of the Court and legislature in this area is of particular importance in the broader context of the internal market. The rest of this chapter is split into four sections and will attempt to describe (and account for) the differing relationships between the legislature and the judiciary during the different stages of capital liberalisation. Section 2 will deal with the situation under the original Treaty of Rome. Section 3 will examine a single legislative intervention: Directive 88 / 361. It was this intervention that contained the obligation for Member States to fully liberalise capital movements. It is therefore the most important contribution to the completion of the internal market in the capital sphere. An examination will be made of whether the interpretation of the Directive demonstrates a changed (or changing attitude) of the Court towards the EU legislature. Section 4 will examine the changes brought about by the Treaty on European Union in 1993. It was at Maastricht that the Member States finally introduced into the Treaty framework an <b>absolute</b> <b>obligation</b> to liberalise capital movements. Finally, Section 5 will consider the Treaty of Lisbon and the possibility of future interventions by the legislature. By looking at the patterns that run through the different parts, this chapter will attempt to engage with the question of whether the approaches were products of their historical context, or whether they can be applied to other areas within the capital movement sphere...|$|E
40|$|We may {{be given}} to {{understand}} that the story of the three caskets in The Merchant of Venice has a remarkable affinity with a folk tale of marriage proposal involving difficult questions in which a beautiful princess puts riddles to a suitor who will lose his life on the spot in case he turns out to be incapable of solving them. While in the Shakespearean canon the initial portion of Pericles most exactly fits in with this motif, our story seems to be a disguised and yet impressive variation upon it. Considering that they are deprived of the opportunity of begetting legitimate heirs thereafter, the lifelong celibacy to which Portia subjects unsuccessful suitors corresponds, in a symbolic way, to the deadly disaster that awaits the losers of the game in the folk tale {{as well as in the}} Shakespearean romance. The supposedly puzzling inscriptions attached to the caskets manifest themselves as difficult questions in the tale of marriage proposal in question. Each suitor actually addresses himself to deciphering them one by one. What is crucial with this schematized picture is that riddling is latent in the controversial episode of a song about "fancy" being sung. As is notorious, only Bassanio, the hero of this story, with whom Portia has fallen in love at first sight, is blessed with this vitally important musical design. By appropriately taking the cue offered in the shape of a sort of a riddle, he succeeds in choosing the correct casket. Portia proves inventive enough to solve her own dilemma where her desire to break the rule of the game and her <b>absolute</b> <b>obligation</b> to follow it clash with each other. Since she did not directly inform Bassanio of the correct casket, she is no way to blame. Riddling functioned as a clever stratagem to circumvent the strange will of the late lord of Belmont. At any rate, Bassanio wins, growing aware of the entrapping danger of deceptive. ornament, which ironically enough, he assumes himself, masquerading as something of a prince, while he is in actuality financially nothing, even less than nothing, as he has avowed to Portia. This nothing will organically relate to the nothing to which Antonio, his benefactor is to be financially brought, causing the pound of flesh court to be held...|$|E
40|$|Emmanuel Lévinas {{proposes to}} uncover the basis of meaning for human existence, and, therefore, to provide a ground for the notion of justice that applies to every human being. Lévinas 2 ̆ 7 s most radical stance is that {{morality}} is not {{the product of the}} self 2 ̆ 7 s personal structure or development, but that rather morality is an election, a being-called, and that call is from a level beyond the self. It is the call of the other human being, the evidence for which is the everyday event of human discourse. The radical nature of Lévinas 2 ̆ 7 s thinking is that this event of election takes place at a level prior to cognition, prior in fact to any ontological structure. It is a metaphysical event, and so, he says, the ethical is the metaphysical. Ethics is first philosophy. This remarkable position provides a possible resolution to the conflict between the triviality of the accidental events of life and the search for intrinsic, or absolute, meaning, and therefore intrinsic, or <b>absolute</b> <b>obligation.</b> If each human being has, simply by virtue of his existence, inalienable rights, then worth is somehow a fact, and I am obliged to that other person as a matter of fact. In other words, Lévinas solves Hume 2 ̆ 7 s query as to how any number of facts can generate an obligation by stating that obligation is itself a fact, a part of existence itself. This dissertation is an attempt to show that Lévinas has correctly identified the source of moral obligation and that he has therefore provided a ground for justice as we ordinarily understand that term. The author hopes that he has at least raised an issue that needs to be faced by any philosophy proposing to identify a ground for justice. Lévinas never intended to say either that he was the first or that he is the only person to identify this priority of the ethical over the true, and he frequently cited the works of others where the same thought is found [...] Plato, Aquinas, Descartes, Kant and others among them. If this dissertation makes any serious contribution, it may perhaps only be to bring one to a greater appreciation of the depth of our philosophical tradition and the hope that tradition can bring {{to the question of the}} meaning of human existence.
