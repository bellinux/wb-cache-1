5000|$|Series C and D, {{produced}} in 1913 and 1914 respectively, were roughly of 100 cars each.

The <b>axle</b> <b>tracks</b> were also widened front and rear—1.45 m instead of the previous 1.35 m ...|$|R
50|$|The Lancia Jota (from the Greek letter iota) is {{a series}} of truck and bus chassis {{produced}} by Lancia between 1915 and 1935. The original 1915 Jota was the first true Lancia truck; throughout the following two decades it was made {{in a number of different}} series and variants, each identified by a progressive Greek numeral prefix added to the name, from Djota to the last Eptajota. While <b>axle</b> <b>tracks,</b> wheelbase and equipment gradually grew, the original layout and 4,940 cc four-cylinder petrol engine were retained.|$|R
2500|$|Like its B5 predecessor, visually, the B7 RS4 {{differs from}} its related B7 S4, by having even wider flared {{front and rear}} wheel arches (fenders), {{to allow for a}} wider <b>axle</b> <b>track.</b> [...] Over the B7 A4, it also {{includes}} two larger frontal side air intakes (for the two additional side-mounted coolant radiators). [...] The trim on the saloon and roof rails on the estate are chrome as standard but can also be found in black with the addition of the Optic Pack which includes a black front grill, all exterior trim and black roof rails on the estate version. [...] The B7 RS4 also includes an optional adaptive headlights to complement the standard [...] "Xenon Plus" [...] (Bi-Xenon) High Intensity Discharge (HID) headlamps, which swivel around corners in conjunction with steering wheel movements. [...] Also standard are daytime running lights (DRLs), found within the main headlamp housings, identical to its related B7 A4 and S4, and use a conventional tungsten filament bulb. [...] An acoustic parking system with front and rear sensors is also a standard fitment. [...] Unique carbon fibre interior trims, along with a lap timer within the central Driver Information System (DIS), aluminium pedal caps and footrest, and RS 4 logos complete the look.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>axle</b> <b>track</b> in {{automobiles}} and other wheeled vehicles which {{have two or}} more wheels on an axle, is {{the distance between the}} centerline of two roadwheels on the same axle.

50|$|The 1Z was {{powered by}} the Tipo 61 4,940 cc side valve, {{monobloc}} head inline-four cylinder engine, with 70 hp at 2,200 rpm.The chassis was a conventional ladder frame with solid axles on semi-elliptic leaf springs; brakes were on the transmission and on the rear wheels. The transmission was a Tipo 105 4-speed gearbox with a multi-plate dry clutch.Main differences from the Theta's mechanicals were wider <b>axle</b> <b>tracks,</b> and tyres and metal disc wheels more suited to military use.The vehicle had {{a top speed of}} 60 km/h and could carry 2.2 tons of cargo.|$|R
5|$|Aurion {{takes its}} doors, windows, roof panels, body sides (except front quarters) from the Camry XV40. However, the other panels are unique {{from the regular}} Camry. This {{component}} sharing also means that Aurion has the same wheelbase, front and rear <b>axle</b> <b>tracks,</b> and interior dimensions. Interior design also largely parallels the Camry. Notable differences include the redesigned upper dashboard portion and restyled centre console, plus the substitution of the Australian Camry's hand-operated parking brake with a foot-operated equivalent (as shared with the Camry for Japan and North America). The reasoning behind this component sharing strategy was to reduce costs and to allow the car to be built alongside the Camry, thus simplifying the manufacturing process.|$|R
2500|$|The Camry {{sold in the}} {{majority}} of Southeast Asia, China, and Taiwan {{is referred to as the}} [...] "prestige Camry" [...] by Toyota officials in Japan. The prestige Camry is a rebadged Toyota Aurion (XV40), a regional product designed in Australia and based on the regular Camry. Although front and rear fascias are unique to the Aurion, the body sides including doors and rear quarters, the greenhouse, and roof are interchangeable with the regular Camry. This component sharing also means that Aurion has the same wheelbase, <b>axle</b> <b>tracks,</b> and interior dimensions. From the inside, the Aurion also shares a common interior design with the Camry, including an almost identical lower dashboard, but gaining a redesigned upper dash portion and revamped center console.|$|R

Other changes include retractable rear spoiler and the rear apron with diffuser fins, 265/35R19 front tyres with 19x9.5 inch AMG light-alloy wheels and AMG 20x11.5-inch light-alloy wheels with 325/30R20 tyres (Dunlop Sport Maxx GT tyres), 6-piston front calipers with 390x36mm discs and 4-piston calipers with 360x26mm discs.|$|E
5000|$|Starting with 1954 Lancia {{also built}} light {{commercial}} bodies on the Appia chassis, replacing the analogous {{versions of the}} earlier Ardea.Three models were offered: the Furgoncino panel van (chassis code C80 or C80S for left hand drive), Camioncino pick-up (C83 or C83S), and an ambulance based on the Furgoncino, the Autolettiga (C86 or C86S). In respect to the saloon, all had shorter final drives, lower horsepower engines, widened <b>axle</b> <b>tracks,</b> up-sized 16" [...] wheels and larger tyres—and consequently bodywork altered to accept these modifications.With {{the introduction of the}} second series Appia in 1954 all three models received upgrades similar to the saloon's, while keeping the body style almost untouched. Commercial variants were not upgraded to third series specifications, as during 1959 they were phased out in favour of a forward control full-fledged van using Appia drivetrains, the Lancia Jolly.|$|R

While the W212 E-Class sedan is built at the Sindelfingen plant, the E-Class C207 coupe is built in the Bremen plant alongside the W204 C-Class. Mercedes-Benz is defensive about this relationship, clarifying the original reports by reporting that the C207 shares approximately 60 percent of its mechanical components with the W212. However, this includes powertrain and other technologies that are shared with the E-Class but does not alter the fact that the fundamental structure is W204 derived.

50|$|Despite the 100 and 105 bodies {{being very}} similar, {{there are some}} {{exterior}} visual indications between both models.

The 100 models have almost flat wheel designs, while the 105 models have dished wheels. This difference allows both versions to retain similar wheel tracks, despite the 100 having a relatively wider <b>axle</b> <b>track</b> to allow for the IFS system.|$|E
