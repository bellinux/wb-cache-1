5|$|Benchley {{filled in}} for P. G. Wodehouse at Vanity Fair at the {{beginning}} of 1916, reviewing theatre in New York. This inspired staff at the Tribune magazine to creativity for articles (such as arranging for the producers of The Thirteenth Chair to cast Benchley as a corpse), but the situation <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> deteriorated as the pacifist Benchley became unhappy with the Tribunes position on World War I, and the Tribune editors were unhappy with the evolving tone and irreverence of the magazine. In 1917, the Tribune shut down the magazine, and Benchley was out of work again. When a rumored opening for an editorial position at Vanity Fair fell through, Benchley decided he would continue freelancing, having {{made a name for himself}} <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>magazine.</b>|$|E

Cassandre, the most eminent poster artist in France at the time, replacing the former cover favorite, Erté.|$|E
25|$|After {{moving to}} Moscow, Pisemsky joined The Russian Messenger {{as the head}} of the {{literary}} department. In 1866, on the recommendation of Interior minister Pyotr Valuyev, he became a local government councilor, the job providing him the financial independence he was craving for. Being now a well-paid author and a thrifty man, Pisemsky was able to build his fortune enough to enable him to leave work both <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> and the government office. In the late 1860s he bought a small piece of land on Borisoglebsky Lane in Moscow and built himself a house there. All seemed well, but only on the face of it. Troubled Seas (1863) and Russian Liars (1864) were his last critically acclaimed works. Then came the political drama The Warriors and Those Who Wait (1864) and the dramatic dilogy Old Birds (1864), and Birds of the Latest Gathering (1865), followed by the tragedy Men Above the Law, as well as two historical plays, full of melodramatic turns and naturalistic elements, Lieutenant Gladkov and Miloslavskys and Naryshkins (both 1867).|$|E

Through their re-printing of her lunchtime remarks and short verses, particularly in Adams' column [...] "The Conning Tower", Dorothy began developing a national reputation as a wit. One of her most famous comments was made when the group was informed that famously taciturn former president Calvin Coolidge had died; Parker remarked, [...] "How could they tell?" ...|$|E
500|$|Two of Sterns editors, Koch and Schmidt, {{lost their}} jobs because of the scandal. Both complained {{strongly}} when told that their resignations were expected, pointing out that they had both wanted to sack Heidemann in 1981. A settlement of 3.5million DMs (c. $1million) was provided {{to each of them}} as part of the severance package. The staff <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>magazine</b> were angry at the approach taken by their managers, and held sit-ins to protest at the [...] "management's bypassing traditional editorial channels and safeguards". The scandal caused a major crisis for Stern and, according to Esser and Hartung, the magazine [...] "once known for its investigative reporting, became a prime example of sensation-seeking checkbook journalism". Sterns credibility was severely damaged and it took the magazine ten years to regain its pre-scandal status and reputation. According to the German Historical Institute, the scandal was also [...] "instrumental in discrediting the tendency toward an 'unprejudiced' and euphemistic assessment of the Third Reich in West German popular culture".|$|E
