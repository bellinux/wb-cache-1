500|$|After Mars' {{sister in}} Los Angeles played Mars' demo for Mike Lynn, (the A at Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment), Lynn summoned [...] Mars to Los Angeles. In 2003, shortly {{after graduating from}} high school at the age of 17, Mars moved to Los Angeles, California to pursue a musical career. He adopted his stage name from the {{nickname}} his father gave him, adding [...] "Mars" [...] at the end because: [...] "I felt like I didn't have [...] pizzazz, and <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> say I’m out of this world, so I was like I guess I'm from Mars." [...] Moreover, the adoption of his stage name was also due to [...] "the music industry tried to pigeonhole him as another Latino artist, and even convinced him to sing in Spanish." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson stated {{several times}} that [...] "Billie Jean" [...] {{was based on the}} groupies he and his {{brothers}} encountered while part of The Jackson 5. [...] "Billie Jean is kind of anonymous. It represents <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>girls.</b> They used to call them groupies in the '60s." [...] He added: [...] "They would hang around backstage doors, and any band that would come to town they would have a relationship with, and I think I wrote this out of experience with my brothers when I was little. There were a lot of Billie Jeans out there. Every girl claimed that their son was related to one of my brothers." [...] The reason for this was due to the fame of the Jackson 5, and wanting to have their money {{in order to have a}} way of living.|$|E
500|$|For {{the role}} of Laila, Zoya wanted someone with an [...] "accent", who {{would be willing to}} do scuba diving, and was a half Indian and half Caucasian girl. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> were auditioned for it in New York and London. Later, in a party, she met Katrina Kaif, and chose her. Her role was {{reportedly}} described as [...] "a free- spirited girl, a wanderer at heart and a bohemian gypsy by nature." [...] Zoya had wanted to work with Kalki ever since seeing her in Dev D and That Girl in Yellow Boots. She felt that Kalki would fit the bill for the character of Natasha, since she had [...] "the sense of comedy, but not over the top." [...] Ariadna was chosen for {{the role of}} Nuria, since she was liked for her work in the 2009 Spanish film Eloise. The full cast of the film was confirmed by April 2010.|$|E
5000|$|... "When {{you wish}} for {{something}} hard it comes true," [...] his mother told Luv Kumar. But what she did not tell him was to be careful what he wished for. Luv kumar not knowing this wished for <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>girl</b> friends. That’s how the story starts. The film is told as an autobiographical narrative {{in the voice of}} Luv Kumar.|$|R

500|$|A {{spinster}} {{for many}} years, Mavis resisted the advances of men, often {{too shy to}} allow dating to progress beyond {{the initial stages of}} courtship. Ian Randall comments that [...] "Many a man has been smitten with Mavis Riley, but unfortunately she always seemed to attract the drippier of the male species". In 1976 a love interest was introduced for Mavis in the form of Derek Wilton (Peter Baldwin), {{but it was more than}} a decade before the couple finally married in 1988, after simultaneously jilting each other four years earlier. Barbara Knox, who plays Rita, said, [...] "She [...] was quite a tough little character. You know, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> would have gone through with , and she stuck to her guns and said 'No, no this isn't right.' Again, dithering and weepy, but she was tough enough to do it. That scene [...] is reflective of the two of them. That was the essence of the friendship, they stuck up for each other and [...] great friends, all the way through." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{month before}} {{she made her}} debut on-screen, Toyah was {{described}} as being Janice's (Vicky Entwistle) fourteen-year-old illegitimate daughter, who would become [...] "the scourge of every Weatherfield Comprehensive teacher". During {{an interview with the}} Daily Record's Polly Graham, Taylor stated [...] "Toyah's gobby and cocky and makes her parents' life a misery. But it's brilliant playing her, it's more fun than playing somebody nice." [...] Graham explained that both Toyah and her stepsister, Leanne (Jane Danson) were well known to the police for under-age drinking and burglary. Taylor said that she hated her character's clothes, as they were too revealing for her. She explained [...] "In the beginning, the clothes that Toyah wore were terrible. I was very conscious of my bum hanging out from these tiny mini-skirts. There are <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> who wear those tarty skirts, but I never felt comfortable in that sort of thing." [...] Taylor also disliked Toyah's make-up, which was initially bright pink lipstick, a lot of black eyeliner and no foundation.|$|E
2500|$|Often {{girls who}} take racy photos of {{themselves}} [...] "want to be admired, {{want someone to}} want them. A {{lot of them are}} lonely and starved for attention. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> believe they {{have no choice but to}} pose in this way. There are also the thrill seekers who do it because it's 'edgy and cool.'" ...|$|E

He has also said, [...] "Girls going crazy are better than some guy in a bar waiting to fight you outside after you're done playing".|$|R
2500|$|In April 2017, the TNT started [...] "The Philological Faculty", another series {{directed}} by Fedor Stukov. This {{is an attempt}} to repeat the success of “Univer” and try to creatively reckon with the problem of the philological faculties of the country teaching mostly girls. The story takes place in a University group where three boys find themselves among <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>girls.</b> Fyodor Stukov has been the director of the series, and a famous pop artist and humorist Efim Shifrin was invited to play the part of the teacher: ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with music website Hollywood Unlocked, {{when asked about the}} initial direction for her music, Cardi B said, [...] "When I first started rapping [...] I liked certain songs from Khia and Trina, and they [...] fighting songs. I haven't heard fighting songs for a very long time," [...] crediting the two female rappers for her aggressive rap style. She continued saying [...] "a lot of girls they can not afford red bottoms, <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> they can not afford foreign cars [...] but I know that every girl has beef with a girl [...] I know that every bitch don't like some bitch, and it's like 'that's what I wanna rap about.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Autumn Reeser portrays Taylor Townsend (season 4, {{recurring}} season 3), {{introduced in}} Season 3 as a neurotic perfectionist student. Her character's initial personality {{was referred to}} by many critics as similar to the character Tracy Flick from the film Election. Taylor begins the series as a recurring villain before eventually becoming the second female lead in the fourth season. Autumn Reeser's performance was critically acclaimed. She reflected back on the character during a 2010 interview, saying [...] "I feel like there's <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> out there who could really relate to her, who hadn't seen themselves on TV in that way. I loved that about her. I loved that she made no apologies for who she was even though she wasn't what all the magazines said was OK. She was like, [...] "I'm still valid. And I'm awesome. And I know I'm odd, and that's OK." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an interview, Dappy {{described}} the song as being [...] "up-tempo, fast, party music" [...] {{as well as}} being [...] "Up-to-date and about Facebook and stuff." [...] The song lyrics follow a theme of infatuation and disappointment with each member describing their own personal experience of how they met someone they thought was 'The one' and how the person left before {{they were able to get}} the phone number. References by Dappy include how he searched on Facebook for the woman he never got a phone number from. Tulisa's story includes how she wore a [...] "LBD" [...] and [...] "Bang bang shoes" [...] when leaving her date for a moment to go to the ladies bathroom at a club and on return discovering he left her without his phone number. Despite the lyric in the song referring to searching for someone you are in love with on Facebook, in an interview with Hollyoaks, Dappy said that that is not something he does: If I want to get in touch with someone, I'll just ring them, man. <b>A</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> might be trying to find me on Facebook, but they won't. They'll find a fake one.|$|E
2500|$|Reviewers {{and critics}} have differing views {{on whether the}} film {{represents}} feminist issues. Historically, among the [...] "top 200 worldwide box-office hits ever ($350million and up), not one has been built around a female action star". Manohla Dargis sees Katniss Everdeen as a female hero following in the lineage of [...] "archetypal figures {{in the literature of}} the American West" [...] such as Natty Bumppo, as well as characters portrayed by American actors such as John Wayne and Clint Eastwood. Katniss is also seen as defying normative gender roles: she exhibits both [...] "masculine" [...] and [...] "feminine" [...] traits equally. Dargis also notes that Katniss is a female character with significant agency: [...] "Katniss is a fantasy figure, but partly what makes her powerful—and, I suspect, what makes her so important to <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> and women—is that she's one of the truest feeling, most complex female characters to hit American movies in a while. She isn't passive, she isn't weak, and she isn't some random girl. She's active, she's strong and she's the girl who motivates the story." [...] Similarly, Shelley Bridgeman of The New Zealand Herald wrote that because the characteristics of [...] "athleticism, strength, courageousness and prowess at hunting" [...] are not given to a male protagonist, but to Katniss, her character is an abrupt departure from the stereotypical depiction of women as being innately passive or helpless. Mahvesh Murad of The Express Tribune said that the film's triumph is [...] "a young female protagonist with agency", comparing her with Joss Whedon's Buffy Summers.|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson {{presented}} [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] {{in a short}} {{live acoustic}} performance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on March 2, 2015, and explained how she co-wrote the song. She revealed that the song's lyrical content had also made it {{hard for her to}} perform it live, saying [...] "It's not even the sad parts of it because I'm not there. I'm not in that place anymore, like where I'm sad about it. I'm in a very forgiving place about it and everybody's human. But I think I get really choked up because I just realize how lucky I am... And <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>girls</b> that grew up with their daddy issues and with not having that figure in their life, you know, take a very different road, and I just feel lucky that I'm not that girl." [...] To promote the album, Clarkson had also performed the song in a stripped-down performance as part of her set list during her Piece by Piece Tour. On February 25, 2016, she performed [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] in a live performance a year after its release on the fifteenth season of American Idol. Her rendition of the song was met with a standing ovation from the audience and critical acclaim from music critics— with Olivia Waring Metro praising it as poignant while USA Todays Erin Jensen describing it as a [...] "heartfelt performance that we just can't get enough of". On March 3, 2016, Clarkson appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show where she discussed her American Idol performance and closed the program with a rendition of the song.|$|E

5000|$|Despite the song's {{innocent}} and catchy pop stylings, the tune {{is based on}} Gilder's experiences witnessing child prostitution. [...] "I've seen <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> young <b>girls,</b> 15 and 16, walking down Hollywood Boulevard with their pimps. Their home environment drove them to distraction so they ran away, only to be trapped by something even worse.

They are people welcome in country houses, but travelling third class, and devilishly perplexed about how to tip the servants, how to pay if they lose at bridge, and so forth. We enlist them, we send them out on demand, carefully selecting our agents to meet the circumstances in each case. They go down and disentangle the amorous by--well, by entangling them. The lovers are off with the old love, the love which causes all the worry, without being on with the new love--our agent. The thing quietly fizzles out.' ...|$|E
50|$|Take a {{negative}} instance. A Mahommedan Guider comes to England and addresses <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>Girl</b> Guides on religion, {{in the course}} of which she quotes Mahomet as the one divine teacher. This {{in spite of the fact}} that her audience are believers in Christ. How would you regard her action? As tactless, as insulting, as fanatical? At any rate it wouldn't be exactly polite or in accordance with our laws of courtesy. Yet I have known Christian Guiders as well as Scouters do exactly the same thing with Jews or Hindoos or people of other beliefs present, and these on their part have sat under it, too polite to raise objections but none the less made uncomfortable by it. Once, at a mixed gathering at a 'Scout's Own' a speaker carefully avoided much reference to Christ and was accused by some there of 'denying Him'. His defence was that he was rather following Christ in that he was showing Christian deference to the feelings of others who, equally with himself, were sons of one Father, under whatever form they rendered homage to God.|$|R

Another of his ships, the Crusader, brought out some 376 emigrants, mainly agricultural workers. Duncan's new settlers were long regarded as of the finest quality.
